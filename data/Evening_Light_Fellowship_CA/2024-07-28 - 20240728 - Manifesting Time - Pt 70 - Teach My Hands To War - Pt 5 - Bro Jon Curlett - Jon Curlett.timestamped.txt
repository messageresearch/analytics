[34:16] many sick today Lord we pray a special
[34:18] Grace to them Lord that healing virtue
[34:20] would flow through your word Lord that
[34:22] it would raise us up Lord that we'd have
[34:24] a testimony of your goodness and Grace
[34:26] Lord bless your people now now we pray
[34:28] in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen
[34:32] amen God bless you turn if you would to
[34:33] Ephesians
[34:34] 3 certainly not feeling very well we've
[34:37] got a house of pestilence back at my
[34:39] place there Blanca has been very sick
[34:42] and I said last night I said Lord just
[34:43] preserve my voice I'll preach if I can
[34:45] preach so I'm here this morning I have a
[34:47] voice I don't have much else but I have
[34:49] a voice so I say praise the Lord for
[34:51] that I'm thankful that he kept that amen
[34:53] Blanca had virtually lost her voice just
[34:56] a day or two ago and if I on the same
[34:58] trajectory I shouldn't have a voice now
[34:59] but I do and so I'm here and I want to
[35:01] be faithful to my calling amen certainly
[35:04] appreciate that song service amen our
[35:06] hope is in the Lord very much lines up
[35:08] with the the word we have this morning
[35:10] certainly want to uh thank the trustees
[35:12] the deacons the the uh musicians the
[35:15] Sunday School people the youth leaders
[35:18] the audiovisual people the cleaners I
[35:20] know we're going to have a business
[35:21] meeting at the end of the service but I
[35:22] just wanted to say over the pulpit and
[35:24] publicly how much I appreciate each one
[35:26] that does these things and it takes time
[35:28] and it takes effort and I know a lot of
[35:30] us are busy and yet we do it as a
[35:32] sacrifice as a part of our role in the
[35:34] body and so I just appreciate each one
[35:35] of you the faithful tithe payers the
[35:37] attendees each and every one amen God
[35:40] bless you richly Ephesians 3 verse
[35:44] 14 says for this cause I bow my knees
[35:47] unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[35:49] of whom the whole family in Heaven and
[35:51] Earth is named that he would Grant you
[35:54] according to the riches of his glory to
[35:56] be strengthened with might by his spirit
[35:59] in the Inner Man amen God bless you you
[36:01] can have your seats this morning and
[36:03] we're continuing our adoption series on
[36:04] manifesting time and I want to we're
[36:07] continuing again our thought on teach My
[36:08] Hands to War and I want to take a a
[36:10] subtitle this morning of strength and
[36:11] due season and we just read what Paul
[36:14] said and he said we'd be strengthened
[36:15] with might by the holy spirit in the
[36:17] Inner Man and we've spoken already over
[36:20] many of these Services how the battle is
[36:21] in the inside amen the the battle we
[36:23] Face the greatest battle going on now is
[36:26] for the minds of men men Lord the Lord
[36:28] takes the heart he takes the soul and
[36:30] Satan takes the mind and the mind is
[36:32] that Gateway between your soul and the
[36:33] rest of your body to your spirit to your
[36:35] emotions to your very flesh and these
[36:37] different things so that battle is to
[36:39] open that up from the soul side so that
[36:41] faith can come out so that the word can
[36:43] come out and so when it does that then
[36:45] we can win the battle amen but there's a
[36:46] reason we have to guard our thoughts so
[36:49] closely and it takes real commitment to
[36:50] do that you know we have to be real real
[36:53] real intent on what we're thinking about
[36:55] because when we just sit down guess what
[36:57] thoughts start to come to us pretty
[36:58] easily and we have to stop and say where
[37:01] are these thoughts coming from and if
[37:02] they're not coming from a place that is
[37:04] based on the word then we need to stop
[37:05] it and say okay I need to change my
[37:07] thoughts and I need to be intentional
[37:09] about these things because everything we
[37:11] see and hear today is intent on dragging
[37:13] away our Focus From the things of God
[37:15] Amen it's out there to to seduce us it's
[37:17] there to entice us it's to bury us under
[37:19] a load of commitments it's to stress us
[37:21] out amen and the the Overcomer has to be
[37:23] able to push those things away and focus
[37:26] on what the word of God says about about
[37:27] him amen it's to stay centered on the
[37:29] word of God for our day and its purpose
[37:31] for our day if you look in Revelation 3
[37:33] what is the condition of the of the
[37:35] unbeliever of the almost Overcomer it's
[37:38] a lukewarm condition half in half out
[37:40] half committed half not committed am me
[37:42] half Christian half not Christian
[37:44] lukewarm being pulled in two directions
[37:46] at one time and and no way to make a a a
[37:49] clear Road or a clear path in what
[37:51] they're going in their life but I want
[37:53] you to take this thought this morning
[37:55] anden I don't ever want to preach a
[37:56] sermon that beats us down amen I want to
[37:59] challenge us every day I want to
[38:01] challenge us to see where we're at and
[38:03] and to see what God would have for our
[38:04] lives as we read that quote a couple
[38:06] Services ago to come in and see those
[38:07] little things that we do and those areas
[38:09] of our life where we need to be
[38:10] bolstered but I want to give us some a
[38:13] shot of Faith this morning and Isaiah
[38:15] said this he says Thou will keep him in
[38:18] perfect
[38:19] peace now if you look in the original
[38:21] Hebrew That Word Perfect is not even
[38:24] there the word that is there is Shalom
[38:28] thou will keep him in Shalom that word
[38:31] is completeness soundness the literal
[38:33] translation is all as well so you will
[38:36] keep this person in this in the in a
[38:38] state of mind that says all is well what
[38:42] whose mind is stayed on thee it's not
[38:46] one way one day one day the next and one
[38:48] day here and one moment here and there
[38:49] but if we can keep our mind stayed on
[38:52] him then Shalom comes down amen all is
[38:54] well there is a place of perfect peace
[38:56] and perfect rest for the bride amen she
[38:59] will keep him in Shalom perfect peace
[39:02] whose mind is stayed on the why because
[39:04] he trusteth in thee trusty in the Lord
[39:07] forever for in the Lord Jehovah is
[39:10] Everlasting strength this world is
[39:13] completely intent on taking away our
[39:15] peace and our rest that's why we have to
[39:18] have a promise for it is because the
[39:19] world is trying to take it away you look
[39:21] at the politics today you look at the
[39:23] financial systems you look at the cost
[39:24] of living the filth the sensuality the
[39:28] perversion the intent the focus of this
[39:30] world I was telling my wife I watched
[39:32] just a a short portion of the Olympic
[39:34] opening ceremony in France and I should
[39:36] have known better I should have known
[39:38] better because typically they do these
[39:40] great Majestic things with performers
[39:42] and and and massive fireworks and Feats
[39:45] of Strength and just something to really
[39:47] wow you but it's remember what Paris is
[39:49] it's it's Satan's seed of power in
[39:51] Europe remember what the prophet of God
[39:53] said he said he came from Paris and he
[39:55] says he came and he made Hollywood his
[39:57] headquarters in America but it was full
[39:59] of Filth they they they they were
[40:01] showing uh you know they they Blended
[40:03] all of the perversion that is here today
[40:06] not here but in this world and they put
[40:08] it into an opening ceremony to the point
[40:11] where they recreated the last supper
[40:14] with drag queens trans people and
[40:15] children and you say what does that have
[40:17] to do with anything see Satan is trying
[40:20] to get us distracted he's trying to get
[40:22] us up in arms that's half the battle
[40:24] that Christians are facing today is
[40:25] they're getting up in arms about trying
[40:27] to fix what's here rather than getting
[40:28] up in arms and saying I want to get out
[40:29] of here cuz what did that make me
[40:31] realize church I am not here I'm not
[40:33] from here I'm a pilgrim I'm a stranger
[40:36] this world is not my home I'm just a
[40:38] passing through as the song says there's
[40:40] nothing about this world that draws
[40:42] me you know there I I think maybe when
[40:45] we're younger before we give our hearts
[40:47] to the Lord this can seem like a bit of
[40:48] an Eden it can seem like a place where
[40:50] we can make it work but the further you
[40:52] go in life the further you go in the
[40:53] word the more you mature you realize I
[40:55] cannot live here I cannot work here I
[40:58] cannot be here and identify with
[41:00] anything that's here hallelujah amen
[41:02] we're here to get out we are not here to
[41:03] fight the system we're not here to
[41:05] correct the man we are here to go in a
[41:07] resurrection and Rapture and every
[41:09] thought we have every day ought to be
[41:11] focused on what does he have for me in
[41:12] his word what is my word for my season
[41:14] what is it that he's trying to do in my
[41:16] life today amen there's a bride that's
[41:18] getting ready to leave amen there's a a
[41:21] bride that has recognized this is not
[41:22] her home and she's getting herself ready
[41:24] the bride had made herself ready she's
[41:27] preparing to go in a resurrection in the
[41:29] Rapture so the question is not will
[41:31] there be struggles there are will there
[41:33] be battles there are will we face
[41:35] opposition we will every single day but
[41:37] the question is how will we face those
[41:38] things how will we go through them
[41:40] that's what we want to answer as we go
[41:42] through this today I want to share a
[41:43] quote with you just to set us up because
[41:45] with all the distractions we Face
[41:47] there's a battle to be fought and
[41:48] there's a battle to be won to keep the
[41:50] mind in the right place prophet of God
[41:52] says this he says if you want angels to
[41:54] appear to you keep your mind on on God
[41:58] and off the things of the
[42:01] world th this is very simple
[42:03] Church there's nothing hard about what
[42:05] I'm preaching this morning keep your
[42:07] mind on God and off the things of the
[42:09] world go about your business go to your
[42:12] church go to your washing of dishes
[42:15] wherever you are keep your mind on him
[42:17] all day and all night long then God will
[42:20] do something you're drawing close to him
[42:23] you got the world shut out it's just you
[42:26] and he together I've said it so many
[42:28] times but it Bears repeating the more
[42:30] you think on him the more he draws near
[42:33] remember what happened on the road to
[42:35] emus they said and as they spoke dwelt
[42:38] on these things as they spoke on these
[42:40] things Jesus himself Drew near well when
[42:43] you think on him when you dwell on him
[42:45] when you you show him appreciation when
[42:47] you show him love what happens is he
[42:48] comes into the room he comes into the
[42:51] situation but here's the thing if I've
[42:53] been focused on the things of the world
[42:55] it's that much harder to draw close to
[42:57] him and think on the things of God
[42:58] because remember what that story is that
[43:00] of that Indian that came to brother
[43:01] brand and he said I've got two dogs
[43:03] inside of me inside of me fighting one
[43:05] of them's a white dog and one of them's
[43:06] a black dog one of them's good and one
[43:08] of them's bad and he says which one wins
[43:09] he says whichever one I feed the most
[43:11] and we can sit here and we say where is
[43:13] God where is God and God is saying
[43:14] when's the last time you try to talk to
[43:16] me when's the last time you spend time
[43:18] with me what is your focus day by day
[43:20] because if it's all about this world
[43:22] guess what then your heart is not close
[43:23] to God and you're going to fight more
[43:25] and more to try and get him back whereas
[43:27] if we can keep our mind stayed on him he
[43:29] draws closer so much more easily anden
[43:32] our mind goes naturally to those
[43:34] things sometimes we're so focused on the
[43:38] situation and the problems that we want
[43:40] him to deal with that we don't actually
[43:43] start talking to him about anything else
[43:45] and all we are is is going to him for
[43:47] our needs rather than encouraging our
[43:50] relationship with him you know for me I
[43:52] found and this is just me that when I
[43:55] leave those things behind when I take my
[43:58] needs and I just say I'm going to put
[43:59] them away and Lord I'm just going to
[44:01] thank you for what you've done in my
[44:03] life I'm thanking you for what you're
[44:05] doing I'm thanking you for the answers
[44:06] you've given I'm thanking you for the
[44:08] leadership I'm thanking you for the days
[44:10] of sun that we've had here for the last
[44:11] couple of weeks whatever it is a heart
[44:14] of appreciation what it does is it
[44:16] allows us to lay those things aside and
[44:18] now God come in and do something about
[44:20] it rather than us sitting there and
[44:21] trying to force the answer and trying to
[44:23] force the situation sometimes we're
[44:25] trying to get so we're trying so hard to
[44:27] get somewhere with God in the
[44:29] conversation that he's locked out of the
[44:30] conversation
[44:32] completely I'm speaking from experience
[44:34] where we want to do all the talking and
[44:36] then we just want him to move God wants
[44:38] to talk God wants to have a relationship
[44:40] he wants a back and forth you know they
[44:43] they say that women that are trying to
[44:44] get pregnant that are really struggling
[44:46] with it what happens is they they they
[44:48] try and get pregnant and they go through
[44:49] these treatments and hormones and
[44:51] fertility things and all these different
[44:53] things and then in the end a lot of them
[44:55] can't even get pregnant and so what they
[44:57] do is they say well that's it and I'm
[44:59] going to either not have a child or I'm
[45:01] going to go look at adoption and they
[45:03] stop
[45:04] trying and then they get pregnant
[45:07] because what happens they're trying so
[45:09] hard to make it happen that it stresses
[45:12] the body out and they can't actually get
[45:14] pregnant their own works are locking
[45:16] down the reaction that their body's
[45:18] supposed to have and as soon as that
[45:19] stress goes away as soon as they have no
[45:22] expectation of themselves they get
[45:24] pregnant why it's that stress it's that
[45:27] trying these different things we can get
[45:29] to that place with God where we're
[45:30] trying so hard to make him do it that we
[45:33] don't give him any room any latitude to
[45:34] do it the way he wants to do it we're in
[45:37] a we're in a right now Society aren't we
[45:40] I want to pray and I want it to happen
[45:41] right now I want to have a need and then
[45:43] I want him to meet it right then and
[45:45] that's not the God that he promised us
[45:46] he's Jehovah Gyra he sees the need and
[45:48] he meets the need but he does it always
[45:50] in his own time with his perfect will he
[45:52] continues he says just keep him on your
[45:54] mind keep thinking about him how lovely
[45:57] he is how sweet he is of his
[46:01] promises see don't focus on your need
[46:03] start thinking about the attributes of
[46:05] God that you need think about what it is
[46:07] that makes him God because that's what
[46:09] you're coming to him for in the first
[46:10] place if you're sick get this on your
[46:13] mind he was wounded for my
[46:14] transgressions he was bruised for my
[46:16] iniquity the chastisement of my peace
[46:18] was upon him and with his stripes I was
[46:20] healed he says keep your mind centered
[46:23] like that something will happen to you
[46:25] all of a sudden there'll be something
[46:27] drawn nigh to you catch this an
[46:30] anointing will come on you and out of
[46:32] that chair you'll go he says draw nigh
[46:34] unto the Lord and He will draw nigh unto
[46:37] you what what happens is the anointing
[46:39] of God comes down to make his word live
[46:43] that's why you dwell on the word because
[46:45] in the word there is power and there's a
[46:46] holy ghost that comes behind it to make
[46:48] it live amen and it's in each and every
[46:51] one of us that it does this that's why
[46:53] you need to have it so it'll work in you
[46:55] to produce the word you listening to the
[46:57] sick seal yesterday and I came across
[46:58] this beautiful quote and you know we
[47:01] know we're in a mind battle and and the
[47:02] only way to overcome in every age is to
[47:05] catch the anointing for your age it's
[47:07] the only way to overcome you cannot do
[47:09] it by works you can't do it by
[47:11] discipline you've got to come under the
[47:13] anointing for your age because that's
[47:15] what the Overcomer does is it takes the
[47:17] word under that anointing and it
[47:18] produces it amen we're talking about
[47:21] teach My Hands to War and we see these
[47:23] great mind battles but today we're
[47:25] facing battles that they've never faced
[47:26] before before we have similarities sure
[47:29] but today we're facing battles that have
[47:30] never been failed faced before and I
[47:32] know that because we've got a different
[47:33] anointing than anyone's had before it's
[47:35] a different struggle it's a different
[47:37] trial remember what it was there was
[47:39] four beasts there was four powers that
[47:41] were spread across seven Church ages one
[47:43] under each of the first four seals to
[47:45] counteract what Satan was doing and that
[47:46] anointing comes on the Overcomer on the
[47:48] True Believer for that day and you
[47:51] cannot fail with that anointing that
[47:53] anointing is there to make sure we don't
[47:54] fail praise the Lord this morning
[47:57] but brother I would say this he says
[47:59] today we stand here by your grace I am
[48:03] here by his grace church but he says and
[48:05] it's not because it's a special people
[48:08] we are special in that he chose us we
[48:09] are not special in of ourselves he says
[48:12] but it's because just like the day of
[48:14] the lion or the ox or the man it's the
[48:17] eagle time it's the anointing of the
[48:19] hour it's the time that we're living in
[48:22] it's the working of the holy spirit for
[48:24] this particular time to prove that Jesus
[48:28] is not dead that's what we're under
[48:30] right now they had a line anointing in
[48:32] Paul's day then they moved into the ox
[48:34] anointing under the the Dark Ages and
[48:36] then they came under the man anointing
[48:37] under Martin Luther to bring them out
[48:39] through the wisdom of man but now it's
[48:41] the eagle time and it's where we fly
[48:43] above all the situations where we see
[48:45] the truth for what it is where the book
[48:48] is completely open and it takes us
[48:50] completely from here into glory and
[48:51] Eternity
[48:53] amen what's our battle our battle is to
[48:55] catch the anointed for this age to come
[48:58] under the word for our age and let it
[49:00] carry us through the trials take us
[49:02] through the battles that we're facing
[49:03] and so our battle is to catch it and
[49:05] then yield to it amen surrender
[49:08] ourselves to it to let it do the work
[49:10] amen that that's why a modern
[49:12] Pentecostal anointing won't work because
[49:15] they're all about the gifts they're all
[49:16] about speaking in tongues they're all
[49:18] about signs and wonders that is not the
[49:20] overcoming for this age the overcoming
[49:21] for this age is get out of your lukewarm
[49:24] condition and you can be all on fire in
[49:26] the service but then you can't go out
[49:27] and live it why you're in a lukewarm
[49:29] condition even under the gifts and the
[49:31] signs and the Wonders the anointing for
[49:33] this age takes us out of it it does not
[49:35] leave us where we are amen signs and
[49:37] wonders didn't work for Israel on the
[49:38] way to Canaan signs and wonders didn't
[49:40] work for Judas and it won't work today
[49:43] it's a part and parcel of the Christian
[49:45] experience but it is not the end point
[49:47] the end point is a resurrection and
[49:49] Rapture today that's where we're at amen
[49:51] our our purpose is to fulfill the word
[49:53] for our day that's why we're here to
[49:55] fulfill the word for our day and that's
[49:57] what overcoming is overcoming is to
[49:59] fulfill the word for your day and what
[50:01] is the word for our day don't be
[50:03] lukewarm be quick to repent be quick to
[50:06] align yourself with what God's revealing
[50:07] in his word get back to the full word
[50:09] and he'll do the rest under the
[50:10] anointing of the Holy Ghost for this
[50:12] age let's come back to our opening
[50:15] scripture Paul says this that he would
[50:17] Grant you according to the riches of his
[50:19] glory to be strengthened with might by
[50:21] his spirit in the inner man that Christ
[50:24] May dwell in your hearts how by faith
[50:27] faith means believing is required even
[50:30] when there's evidence that says it's not
[50:32] true Faith believes regardless of
[50:35] evidence so what's happening here is by
[50:37] faith and he says that ye been rooted
[50:40] and grounded in love amen the basis for
[50:42] our faith is that he first loved us amen
[50:45] that he gave his life for us that he
[50:46] made a way through Calvary that he has a
[50:48] Redemptive work ongoing he says that he
[50:50] may dwell in Your Heart by faith and
[50:52] that ye been rooted and grounded in love
[50:55] brother says this he says now don't fear
[50:58] have faith wait just a moment see so
[51:01] your spirit can be in the right position
[51:03] to catch the anointing of God faith he
[51:07] say faith triumphs it knows no defeat
[51:09] it'll walk right over everything
[51:12] remember faith is a revelation of God's
[51:14] will for you personally amen faith is
[51:17] when God shows you something that it's
[51:19] yours it's for you you're part of it and
[51:21] because you know that you know that you
[51:24] know that you know that it's for you
[51:25] there's something Rises up in you and it
[51:27] says okay I'll take it and you walk
[51:29] forward in that Faith amen and you say
[51:31] it's mine and from that moment nothing
[51:33] nothing can can move you from that when
[51:35] it's a true personal revelation from God
[51:37] now we spent a lot of time on that in
[51:39] this series that adoption is based on
[51:41] finding the will of God for your life
[51:43] that means a lot of waiting it means a
[51:44] lot of prayer it's a daily thing that we
[51:46] do it takes work and effort it takes
[51:48] commitment it takes it it takes us
[51:50] setting aside things that we think are
[51:51] important to focus on the thing that's
[51:53] most important which is what does he
[51:54] want me to do with my day amen but when
[51:57] we found it and you know you found it
[52:00] then nothing can shake that Revelation
[52:01] from your life he continues he says that
[52:04] we may be able to comprehend with all
[52:06] saints that word comprehend means to
[52:09] know by experience not head
[52:12] knowledge anden you don't know Christ by
[52:14] head knowledge you know Christ by
[52:15] experience you know a living God by a
[52:17] living God experience that we may be
[52:19] able to comprehend that we may know by
[52:21] experience with All Saints what is the
[52:23] breadth the length and depth and height
[52:26] and to know know the love of Christ
[52:27] which passeth that word is surpasses
[52:29] which exceeds knowledge see head
[52:33] knowledge the love that we experience is
[52:35] not just up here but it's a day-by-day
[52:37] thing that we experience in Christ that
[52:39] ye might be filled with all the fullness
[52:42] of God that's what an anointed one is is
[52:45] one that is filled with the fullness of
[52:47] God he says now unto him that is able to
[52:50] do exceeding abundantly above all that
[52:53] we ask or think exceeding abundantly
[52:56] there's not a better phrase for the
[52:57] believer exceeding that means greater
[53:00] than everything and abundantly means
[53:02] greater than greater than
[53:05] anything it's a superlative it's far
[53:07] above whatever we could imagine he says
[53:09] that he could do exceedingly abundantly
[53:11] above all that we ask or think how
[53:15] according to the power that worketh in
[53:17] us what's the power that works in us
[53:19] it's the anointed word by the Holy Ghost
[53:22] that's what's inside of each and every
[53:23] one of us amen it's added to us we never
[53:26] had it we don't have this power in
[53:27] ourselves that's why he had to come back
[53:29] on the day of Pentecost and give it to
[53:31] us to make the word live amen he gave a
[53:33] power inside of us now he
[53:37] says why why did he have to give us
[53:39] power because we needed more than we had
[53:42] that's for sure amen we needed more than
[53:44] we had it's added to us we didn't have
[53:45] it from the start but I want to circle
[53:47] around and really spend this service on
[53:49] this idea of catching the anointing for
[53:52] your age and for your life because we
[53:54] are all under the same anointing if
[53:56] we're true Born Again Sons and Daughters
[53:57] of God we by one Spirit by one Spirit
[54:01] we're all baptized into the body of
[54:03] Christ Paul said and so we're under the
[54:04] Same Spirit we under the same anointing
[54:06] and that anointing is here to make the
[54:08] word of God for this day live it's to
[54:10] make it a reality for our day it's not
[54:12] here to build Ministries it's not here
[54:13] to build men it's not here to build
[54:14] churches or programs none of these
[54:16] things but it's here to make the word
[54:17] live that's all it's here to do
[54:20] amen now Paul says unto him that's able
[54:23] to do exceedingly abundantly above all
[54:26] that we ask or think according to the
[54:28] power that worketh Us in other words
[54:29] he's saying there's more
[54:31] available that's a wonderful thing you
[54:34] know if I if you went to the bank and
[54:37] you drew out
[54:38] $110,000 and they said there's more
[54:40] available what would you do I'll take
[54:42] some more then what if somebody told you
[54:45] there is no
[54:47] limit how much would we take out
[54:51] Church mortgages would be paid off new
[54:54] vehicles all around we'd stop working
[54:58] praise the Lord Brother Grant praise the
[55:00] Lord he says there's more available than
[55:03] what you've asked there's more available
[55:05] than what you've thought there's more
[55:07] available than what you've imagined
[55:09] Hallelujah this morning there's more
[55:11] available than we've ever experienced
[55:12] yet church then you can ask or think but
[55:16] that doesn't mean don't ask and that
[55:18] doesn't mean don't think just don't
[55:20] limit God by your asking or limit him by
[55:22] your thinking amen you can ask badly you
[55:25] can ask WR ly but you can never ask too
[55:28] much you cannot outspend God you can't
[55:31] wear him out amen don't ever let the
[55:33] size of your need or your request stop
[55:36] you from asking he says there's way more
[55:38] here than you ever have need of church
[55:40] every need
[55:43] supplied Jesus said hitherto you have
[55:45] asked nothing in my name ask and ye
[55:48] shall receive that your joy may be full
[55:52] you know as I was thinking on this I
[55:53] think if we're honest maybe this is me
[55:56] being honest sometimes we get in the
[55:58] mindset of if he'll just do what he said
[56:01] that's more than we could ask or
[56:03] think because what we're asking for is
[56:06] Supernatural when we we we're looking at
[56:09] situations when we're looking at people
[56:11] when we're looking at problems we think
[56:13] if he'd only do what he promised I would
[56:15] be mind
[56:16] blown but that's a guarantee he already
[56:20] promise that there's a Beyond his
[56:22] promise that is available to us amen
[56:26] well what happens we get beaten down we
[56:28] get depressed we and what do we do we
[56:30] forget everything that God has done we
[56:33] forget everything he's doing we forget
[56:34] the good reports we forget the healings
[56:36] the provision all of those things and so
[56:38] the great battle comes up and we say
[56:40] here we go again got to face another one
[56:43] on my own just one more thing to deal
[56:45] with and we completely forget that he's
[56:47] done abundantly and exceedingly above
[56:49] what we've asked or thought before and
[56:51] he can do it again and he will do it
[56:52] again if we ask Satan loves to magnify
[56:55] the situation he loves to magnify our
[56:57] flaws and our faults and he raises
[56:58] doubts and he makes us think it's not
[57:00] for us why because it hasn't happened
[57:03] yet that's the that's the greatest
[57:05] weapon Satan has is time because you
[57:07] haven't received what you've asked for
[57:08] yet he says it's not for you that's a
[57:10] lie from the pits of hell and so what
[57:13] happens is we get to the point where we
[57:15] say I won't
[57:17] ask or I'm not worthy to
[57:20] ask and Satan's defeated
[57:23] us that's not how we're supposed to be
[57:25] we're not supped supped be crestfallen
[57:27] depressed oh woe is me I'm a little
[57:30] nothing no you're an ordained elected
[57:33] child of God Amen and you have access to
[57:36] the abundantly to the exceeding
[57:37] abundantly that he talked about amen
[57:40] church if we're feeling that way we need
[57:41] a f fresh baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm
[57:44] just being honest this morning if we're
[57:45] in that place we need a fresh baptism of
[57:47] the Holy Ghost we need to get to the
[57:49] Altar and cry out to God we need to put
[57:51] aside our commitments we need to put
[57:52] aside our chores go into our room and
[57:54] get down on our face before God and say
[57:55] God I need more than what I've got amen
[57:57] I need an exceedingly abundantly above
[57:59] what I've had listen if they did it
[58:01] right after the day of Pentecost we can
[58:02] do it today say Lord there's more of you
[58:05] available I'm definitely standing in a
[58:07] need this morning amen that there's more
[58:08] of you amen I don't care how long it's
[58:12] been I don't care if God hasn't answered
[58:14] be certain of God his word Can't Fail
[58:16] his promises can't fail but the believer
[58:19] believes and stays there until he does
[58:20] it now I want to take this to the Bible
[58:22] this morning as we ought to Amen to
[58:25] because so often what happens is the
[58:27] reality of the anointing comes in a way
[58:29] that we're not expecting it comes by the
[58:31] word but so often it doesn't come the
[58:33] way that we're expecting and so often
[58:35] what happens then is we build a box
[58:36] around God's answer and it hinders Us in
[58:39] receiving or recognizing what God's
[58:41] trying to do amen and as we talked about
[58:43] Satan's weapon so often is time and he
[58:46] he he leverages time to make us think
[58:48] that God's not going to answer but we
[58:50] know God's got his timing and his timing
[58:52] is perfect he's an ontime God he does it
[58:55] perfectly every single time time amen
[58:57] but let's walk through this today to see
[58:59] what it looks like to receive the
[59:00] anointing for your day to receive the
[59:02] strength of the anointed
[59:03] word now this is speaking of Jesus and
[59:06] he's back in Nazareth his hometown it
[59:08] says and there was delivered unto him
[59:09] the book of the prophet Isaiah and when
[59:11] he had opened the book he found the
[59:12] place where it was written the spirit of
[59:14] the Lord is upon me because Heath
[59:17] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[59:19] poor he has sent me to heal the
[59:21] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[59:22] the captives and recovering of sight to
[59:24] the blind to set at Liberty
[59:26] them that are bruised he says to preach
[59:29] the acceptable year of the Lord and he
[59:31] closed the book and he gave it again to
[59:33] the minister and sat down and the eyes
[59:36] of all of them that were in the
[59:37] synagogue were fastened on him and he
[59:39] began to say unto them this day is this
[59:43] scripture fulfilled in your ears now
[59:46] those words were written by Isaiah
[59:47] hundreds and hundreds of years of ago
[59:49] and Jesus comes to his own Hometown and
[59:52] he says this scripture is fulfilled here
[59:55] today right
[59:57] now it's no longer prophecy it's reality
[1:00:01] the word when it came out of Isaiah's
[1:00:02] mouth was not for Isaiah it was for the
[1:00:04] Messiah to come and do and Jesus now
[1:00:06] comes in and what is he he's the
[1:00:08] anointed word made flesh it takes the
[1:00:11] anointed word off the page and now it
[1:00:13] comes in flesh and he says the anointed
[1:00:15] word is here today what was spoken of is
[1:00:17] now a reality in my flesh today the
[1:00:19] anointed word is being fulfilled in your
[1:00:23] midst what the people in that synagogue
[1:00:25] do tried to kill him they rejected the
[1:00:28] word but here's the thing Church there
[1:00:31] were people that were crying out for
[1:00:33] that anointed one no matter what there
[1:00:35] were brokenhearted people there were
[1:00:37] people that were in captivity there were
[1:00:39] people that were blind there were people
[1:00:41] that were bruised that were hurt that
[1:00:42] were offended that were cast out and
[1:00:44] they were crying out for this Messiah
[1:00:47] however he might come they did not put a
[1:00:48] box around the word they said whatever
[1:00:51] the word for my day is I want to receive
[1:00:53] it I don't want to miss it and so these
[1:00:55] religious people are pushing it all away
[1:00:57] but these other ones in their condition
[1:00:59] in their bruised Fallen sinful hurt sick
[1:01:03] condition were crying out for this
[1:01:04] anointed word to come their way so that
[1:01:06] this word will become a reality in their
[1:01:09] life in their fallen condition in their
[1:01:11] needy condition they're crying out for
[1:01:13] him and we see this picture of a man by
[1:01:17] the pool of salom and the prophet of God
[1:01:19] puts it this way he says a little old
[1:01:21] fellow laying down there laying by the
[1:01:23] pool of Bethesda been laying there for
[1:01:25] 30 28 years with an infirmity in his
[1:01:27] body praying with all of his heart how
[1:01:30] long oh Lord how
[1:01:33] long how long's it going to
[1:01:36] take what's the
[1:01:39] delay he says and Jesus was led by the
[1:01:42] Holy Spirit right down to where he was
[1:01:44] and healed him says when the rest of
[1:01:46] them were thinking about their diseases
[1:01:49] and things and he went away from them
[1:01:52] and never said a word what is it the
[1:01:54] anointed word came to somebody who would
[1:01:56] receive it the way it
[1:01:58] came the others he says were focused on
[1:02:00] their diseases they were focused on the
[1:02:02] pool but this one caught a hold of
[1:02:04] something else and the spirit of God
[1:02:05] leads Jesus there now catch this man
[1:02:08] catch this scene because he's in a scene
[1:02:11] of Divine Healing his entire life and
[1:02:14] he's got no
[1:02:15] healing he's seen Miracle after Miracle
[1:02:19] person after person gets in that pool
[1:02:21] and gets healed and he's sitting there
[1:02:23] and he has none of it
[1:02:26] he kept missing it he didn't have the
[1:02:28] strength he didn't have the speed to be
[1:02:30] first he couldn't see that Ripple in the
[1:02:32] water and jump in before anybody else
[1:02:34] did and everyone that would help him had
[1:02:35] forsaken him it's just him there but
[1:02:39] Church he's staying where healing
[1:02:41] is that's the faith that he had he kept
[1:02:45] praying and even though he's impotent
[1:02:46] the scripture says though he has no
[1:02:48] strength of his own he had no way of
[1:02:50] getting to where he needed to be what
[1:02:52] happened when you can't go to him he
[1:02:54] comes to you Hallelujah and the anointed
[1:02:57] word comes to one
[1:03:00] man one faithful person that was looking
[1:03:03] for
[1:03:05] it not just the anointing the anointed
[1:03:08] one the Christ the anointed word for his
[1:03:10] day see here's the thing Church the pool
[1:03:13] had Miracles when the angel came down
[1:03:15] Miracles would happen but it was only
[1:03:17] one at a time and it was random and it
[1:03:20] was based on who could get there first
[1:03:22] and he had no opportunity but he stayed
[1:03:24] there per Adventure one day he might be
[1:03:26] able to get in there and do it what's he
[1:03:29] doing his faith never left him out of
[1:03:31] that place of healing he stayed where
[1:03:33] healing was even though he never got
[1:03:36] it never leave the word never leave the
[1:03:40] place of your healing never leave the
[1:03:41] place of your promise if you stay there
[1:03:43] then the anointing will come to that
[1:03:44] word and it'll meet you right there amen
[1:03:47] that man never lost hope he never lost
[1:03:49] faith decade after decade after decade
[1:03:51] of pain no healing perhaps he wondered
[1:03:54] if he'd never if he'd ever get healed
[1:03:57] but then one day what happened his faith
[1:03:59] drew the anointed word to him amen and
[1:04:03] then the anointed one for his age simply
[1:04:04] said rise take up your bed and walk and
[1:04:08] all he was left with was to make the
[1:04:10] attempt based on what he said and
[1:04:12] strength came to his legs and he stood
[1:04:14] up picked up his bed and walked away
[1:04:18] Hallelujah when you can't do it it'll
[1:04:20] come to you and it'll give you the
[1:04:21] strength that you have need of he says
[1:04:23] you want to S God to send the power upon
[1:04:26] you go to praying and believing we do a
[1:04:31] lot of praying how much believing do we
[1:04:32] do he says the Holy Ghost will bring it
[1:04:35] to you healing salvation whatever you
[1:04:38] have need of God will bring it to you
[1:04:40] you I'm reminded of that woman that that
[1:04:42] came to the well in Samaria and it was
[1:04:43] the middle of the day when things get
[1:04:45] hot it was the sixth hour that's that's
[1:04:47] noon and all the women would come early
[1:04:49] in the morning because that's when it
[1:04:50] was cool but she wasn't allowed to walk
[1:04:52] with them she was an adulterous she was
[1:04:53] a fornicator she was an outcast she
[1:04:55] messed up her life badly five different
[1:04:57] marriages five different divorces and
[1:04:59] now she sh shacked up common law with a
[1:05:01] man and so she can't walk with the good
[1:05:03] women she can't walk with The Godly
[1:05:05] women she can't walk with the ones that
[1:05:07] are received by everyone else she's
[1:05:09] completely broken her life is a mess she
[1:05:12] has bad decision after bad decision
[1:05:14] stacked up on
[1:05:16] another and her life is so Twisted now
[1:05:19] like spaghetti that nobody can untie it
[1:05:21] no man no woman no Ministry can untie it
[1:05:23] she's completely overtaken not only that
[1:05:26] she's a Samaritan she's half Jew she's
[1:05:28] half Gentile she's an outcast from those
[1:05:30] that the word is coming to we
[1:05:33] think and now after Decades of bad
[1:05:36] living perhaps she's now an outcast from
[1:05:38] her own people she's someone to be
[1:05:39] shunned but she comes here that day now
[1:05:42] notice here's the thing church this
[1:05:44] woman is under a
[1:05:47] burden but in that burden there's a
[1:05:51] call because what's happened here and is
[1:05:54] there's a cry in her for that Messiah to
[1:05:56] come and somehow in her past she learned
[1:06:00] that there's a messiah coming and yet in
[1:06:03] her great teaching in her proper raising
[1:06:06] she has come out of it and she's
[1:06:08] completely messed up her life but yet
[1:06:10] there's a cry inside that says if the
[1:06:12] Messiah could come my way he'd get it
[1:06:15] all figured out all my mistakes all my
[1:06:18] failures all my flaws he'd fix it all
[1:06:21] for me in her condition there's a cry
[1:06:24] that's there Amen in her absolute
[1:06:26] inability to get out of her own way she
[1:06:28] says there's somebody that can make a
[1:06:30] way for me out of this day after day
[1:06:32] week after week year after year she
[1:06:34] trudges on that walk of shame where
[1:06:36] everybody sees her and they say There
[1:06:37] She Goes Again children don't ever talk
[1:06:40] to her husband what are you looking
[1:06:43] at day after day hot sweaty frustrated
[1:06:48] annoyed the Walk of Shame to get her
[1:06:52] water what was it it was Jacob's Well if
[1:06:54] you remember it was deep it never went
[1:06:57] dry but here's the thing Jacob's
[1:06:59] experience wasn't enough for her she had
[1:07:01] to have the experience Jacob had which
[1:07:03] is to meet a living God she needed to
[1:07:06] meet the god of her day amen can you
[1:07:08] imagine her mindset as she's walking up
[1:07:09] to this
[1:07:11] well hot sweaty her hair is clinging to
[1:07:16] her you sisters know that you know when
[1:07:17] you get sweaty and it's just tendel of
[1:07:19] hair I'll lie to you the back of your
[1:07:21] neck is just so hot you got these heavy
[1:07:23] jars on your in your hands
[1:07:26] and you're walking up and you're just
[1:07:27] frustrated you're tired you're sick of
[1:07:30] doing this walk and we'll see as we get
[1:07:31] into the scriptures she hates this walk
[1:07:34] to get water every day but she has to do
[1:07:36] it to live but we see Church One day
[1:07:40] things were different at the well that
[1:07:41] she'd walk to every day one day Jesus is
[1:07:43] waiting for her there now the scripture
[1:07:46] says and I love this the scripture says
[1:07:49] Jesus said he must needs go through
[1:07:53] Samaria now here's the thing
[1:07:56] I cried when I read this that word needs
[1:07:59] we say it means necessary but if you
[1:08:01] look a little deeper it says it was
[1:08:05] inevitable that he would go
[1:08:07] there that a child of God in a fallen
[1:08:13] condition but yet ready to receive the
[1:08:15] word it was
[1:08:17] inevitable that God would come her way
[1:08:20] with the anointed word for her day it
[1:08:22] was inevitable there was nothing could
[1:08:25] stop it she couldn't stop it he was
[1:08:28] coming whether she was ready for him or
[1:08:30] not Hallelujah when you're a child of
[1:08:34] God there is an inevitability that he
[1:08:36] will come your way with the word that'll
[1:08:38] take you out of your current condition
[1:08:39] amen hallelujah he can't lose a one of
[1:08:43] us Church we're engraved in the palms of
[1:08:44] his hands we're talking about strength
[1:08:46] and due season today because this is so
[1:08:48] critical about where we're at we're
[1:08:50] looking for we're expecting rapturing
[1:08:52] Faith below that would be healing Faith
[1:08:54] below that would be provisional faith
[1:08:56] and and these different things but this
[1:08:58] woman in all of her frustrations her
[1:08:59] despair her shame and all of her
[1:09:02] disappointments she can't get away from
[1:09:04] herself and yet God Has Come her way to
[1:09:08] meet her exactly where she's at God has
[1:09:11] to come her way because that's the only
[1:09:13] way that's ever going to get her out of
[1:09:15] where she's at amen so many people in
[1:09:18] that day received his gifts received his
[1:09:21] healing received his kind words but they
[1:09:24] always missed out on the Great greatest
[1:09:25] thing was to receive he
[1:09:28] himself they took everything he gave but
[1:09:30] they didn't receive him and in the end
[1:09:32] they crucified him they missed out on
[1:09:34] that greatest blessing they didn't
[1:09:35] receive the anointed word for their day
[1:09:38] and yet here's a little
[1:09:39] prostitute a messed up
[1:09:42] woman and the anointed word comes to her
[1:09:45] let's read this as we go together this
[1:09:47] morning watch the progression of this
[1:09:49] conversation I just love it it's so
[1:09:50] beautiful one of my favorite portions of
[1:09:52] the entire scripture is this story
[1:09:55] says now Jacob's Well was there Jesus
[1:09:57] therefore being wearied with his journey
[1:09:59] sat thus on the well and it was about
[1:10:00] the six hour he's
[1:10:02] tired he's tired but he's still there
[1:10:06] and there came a woman of Samaria to
[1:10:08] draw water and Jesus saith unto her give
[1:10:10] me a drink for his disciples were gone
[1:10:12] away into the city to buy meat then
[1:10:14] saith the woman of Samaria unto him how
[1:10:17] is it that thou being a Jew askest drink
[1:10:19] of me which am a woman of Samaria for
[1:10:21] the Jews have no dealings with
[1:10:23] Samaritans now catch this lesson one the
[1:10:25] word of God is not bound by our
[1:10:29] traditions we need to get off of our
[1:10:31] high horses sometimes we're not here to
[1:10:34] poke we're not here to point fingers
[1:10:37] we're here to serve we're here to spread
[1:10:39] the gospel we're here to show there's a
[1:10:41] way out of this mess amen Jesus is
[1:10:45] Anointed to speak to this woman and
[1:10:46] that's why he's there and he's going to
[1:10:48] talk to her no matter what she
[1:10:50] thinks but catch the start of this
[1:10:52] conversation what is it social issues
[1:10:54] segregation world affairs perhaps as it
[1:10:56] would matter to them but Jesus answered
[1:10:58] and said unto her if thou knewest the
[1:11:00] gift of God and who it is that sayth to
[1:11:03] thee give me a drink thou wouldest as
[1:11:05] have asked of him and he would have
[1:11:07] given thee Living Water see watch Jesus
[1:11:09] now okay he's connected with her I'm a
[1:11:11] little different but she has no clue how
[1:11:13] different then he brings up the word he
[1:11:15] says there's a gift that's here and you
[1:11:16] don't recognize it I'm a gift to you you
[1:11:18] think I'm a Jew I'm not a Jew I'm a gift
[1:11:20] to you if you can only recognize
[1:11:23] it it says and the woman saith unto him
[1:11:25] sir thou Hast nothing to draw with and
[1:11:28] the well is deep from whence then hast
[1:11:30] thou that Living Water she's saying
[1:11:31] listen you can't even get water yourself
[1:11:33] and you're telling me you're going to
[1:11:33] give me Living
[1:11:35] Water art thou greater than our father
[1:11:37] Jacob which gave us the well and drank
[1:11:39] thereof himself and his children and his
[1:11:41] cattle see she doesn't have a clue
[1:11:42] what's going on doesn't stop the
[1:11:45] word says Jesus answered and said unto
[1:11:48] her whosoever drinketh of this water
[1:11:50] shall thirst again but whosoever
[1:11:52] drinketh of the water that I shall give
[1:11:54] him shall never thirst but the water
[1:11:56] that I give him shall be in him a well
[1:11:59] of water springing up unto Everlasting
[1:12:02] Life Church if people don't get it the
[1:12:04] first time that's okay just keep talking
[1:12:06] just keep sharing just keep opening up
[1:12:09] and see if they'll get it
[1:12:11] eventually the woman said unto
[1:12:16] him sir give me this water that I thirst
[1:12:21] not neither come hither to draw church
[1:12:23] God knows how to get our attention
[1:12:25] he has a conversation with her that he
[1:12:27] would never have had with anyone else he
[1:12:28] can only have it with her cuz she's the
[1:12:30] only one coming in the middle of the day
[1:12:31] what happened Jesus goes straight to her
[1:12:33] desire he goes straight to her problem
[1:12:36] what is it now the anointed word is
[1:12:38] Discerning the life she's still has no
[1:12:41] clue what's going on but there's
[1:12:43] something about this that's keeping her
[1:12:45] engaged long enough for for her to get
[1:12:47] what she needs right the word is
[1:12:49] Discerning her life and she doesn't even
[1:12:51] know it yet then it says Jesus saith
[1:12:53] unto her go call thy husband and come
[1:12:54] here
[1:12:55] see now the word's going to the source
[1:12:57] of the problem he's discerned her need
[1:12:59] but now he's digging down to what's
[1:13:01] really causing it and she has a choice
[1:13:03] here she can get
[1:13:05] offended she can walk away in a huff
[1:13:07] because he has no business talking to
[1:13:08] her about that or she can respond
[1:13:13] truthfully you know what think I think
[1:13:15] made the difference Jesus
[1:13:18] attitude he has nothing to prove no acts
[1:13:21] to grind he's not trying to pin her down
[1:13:25] he's just having a calm collected
[1:13:27] conversation with
[1:13:29] her catching her
[1:13:31] spirit and just letting it go where it's
[1:13:33] going to go he knows what's coming now
[1:13:37] catch what happens now Jesus says it the
[1:13:39] right way the woman answered and said I
[1:13:41] have no
[1:13:43] husband Jesus said unto her thou has
[1:13:45] said well I have no husband what she
[1:13:47] said was
[1:13:48] true but it was
[1:13:53] incomplete he said for the thou Hast had
[1:13:55] five husbands and he whom thou now Hast
[1:13:58] is not thy husband in that said thou
[1:14:01] truly he says you're right what you said
[1:14:03] was technically correct but here's the
[1:14:05] real answer you've had five and now
[1:14:09] you're living with somebody that isn't
[1:14:10] your husband so you're right you don't
[1:14:11] have a husband as far as you're there
[1:14:14] and now she's got another decision does
[1:14:16] she crumble in
[1:14:17] embarrassment does she again go away in
[1:14:20] a huff in a tantrum or does she admit
[1:14:22] the
[1:14:23] truth that shows the character of a true
[1:14:26] son and daughter of God is when they can
[1:14:27] admit the truth even when it's
[1:14:30] hurting the woman said unto him sir I
[1:14:34] perceive that thou art a prophet she
[1:14:37] didn't say you don't understand how hard
[1:14:39] my life's been she doesn't say you don't
[1:14:40] understand I was abused as a child you
[1:14:42] don't understand my daddy left when I
[1:14:44] was four this is a classic woman with
[1:14:47] classic daddy issues something in all
[1:14:49] probability had happened in her life
[1:14:51] earlier that helped drive her down this
[1:14:53] road but she doesn't have any of this
[1:14:54] when it comes out she instantly
[1:14:56] recognizes now aha there's more
[1:15:00] happening here than I
[1:15:02] thought and what does she see Church she
[1:15:05] sees the opportunity she sees the
[1:15:08] potential that if there's a man of God
[1:15:10] that's talking to me there's a purpose
[1:15:12] why he's talking to me amen what happens
[1:15:15] now her faith and her hope Collide she
[1:15:19] says you're a
[1:15:21] prophet prophets do things with women
[1:15:23] like me and not the things that everyone
[1:15:26] else wants to do with me prophets come
[1:15:28] to women that need help to help them
[1:15:32] Hallelujah she said now watch this she
[1:15:34] says you're a prophet answer me
[1:15:36] something I've got a word question our
[1:15:38] fathers worshiped in this mountain and
[1:15:40] you say that in Jerusalem is the place
[1:15:41] where a man ought to worship see she's
[1:15:44] saying there's she sees there's
[1:15:45] discernment here and that means that she
[1:15:47] can get some answers that have been Str
[1:15:48] bothering her for a while so she latches
[1:15:50] on to this man this Prophet she wants to
[1:15:52] know what options she has she wants to
[1:15:54] know how to worship God properly it says
[1:15:57] and Jesus saith unto Heroman believe me
[1:15:59] the hour cometh when you shall neither
[1:16:00] in this mountain nor yet at Jerusalem
[1:16:02] worship the father ye worship ye know
[1:16:04] not what and we know what we worship for
[1:16:06] salvation is of the Jews but the hour
[1:16:08] cometh and now
[1:16:11] is the truth will set you free when the
[1:16:15] true worshipper shall worship the father
[1:16:17] in spirit and in truth for the father
[1:16:20] seeketh such to worship him see church
[1:16:22] he has completely dismantled everything
[1:16:23] that held her back well you say I've got
[1:16:25] to go to your church you got to sit
[1:16:27] under this ministry you got to go to
[1:16:28] this Temple you got to do this he says
[1:16:29] lady you're completely missing it
[1:16:32] there's coming a time and it is right
[1:16:34] now where you can worship Him in spirit
[1:16:36] and in truth wherever you
[1:16:37] are he's setting her free he says God is
[1:16:41] a spirit and they that worship Him must
[1:16:43] worship Him in spirit and in truth now
[1:16:46] catch this the woman saith unto him I
[1:16:48] know that Messiah cometh which is called
[1:16:51] Christ when he is come he will tell us
[1:16:54] all things church that ought to make a
[1:16:56] shout this morning that a woman in her
[1:16:58] condition completely covered in sin
[1:17:01] completely covered in shame completely
[1:17:03] covered in Fallen nature can latch on to
[1:17:06] the word and say when the anointed word
[1:17:09] comes my way he'll tell me what you're
[1:17:10] telling me right
[1:17:13] now she's Bound in bad
[1:17:16] decisions Bound by a past she can't undo
[1:17:19] and yet she latches on she says the
[1:17:21] Messiah will do what you're doing right
[1:17:22] now
[1:17:25] all the Pharisees missed it and this
[1:17:28] little Fallen
[1:17:29] woman hot sweaty
[1:17:32] frustrated catches sight of something
[1:17:34] and says Messiah will do what you're
[1:17:36] doing right here what is a church there
[1:17:38] was still something in her soul I didn't
[1:17:41] have it in my notes I had it I took it
[1:17:44] out but there was something in her
[1:17:47] soul and when that light flashed across
[1:17:49] it we'll read it in a second that light
[1:17:51] flashed across it something that was
[1:17:53] buried so deep under filth and sin and
[1:17:57] mistakes and bad decisions came to life
[1:18:01] and that was something she didn't know
[1:18:02] was there but yet it was always there
[1:18:04] along and as soon as the anointed word
[1:18:06] came her way she said this is for me I
[1:18:09] recognize something here this is
[1:18:10] different than anything I've ever heard
[1:18:13] before she knew the sign of the Messiah
[1:18:15] she knew the message he would bring she
[1:18:17] knew how to identify him and so despite
[1:18:19] this looking like any other man she says
[1:18:22] the Messiah the anointed one has he just
[1:18:25] walked into my
[1:18:26] life says and Jesus saith unto her I
[1:18:29] that speak unto thee am
[1:18:33] he everybody else is asking him that
[1:18:35] question and he almost never answers it
[1:18:37] but when there's one that will receive
[1:18:39] it he'll tell you right away I'm him
[1:18:41] this is it you've got it it says and the
[1:18:44] woman left her water pot and she went
[1:18:46] her way into the City and sayth to the
[1:18:48] men come see a man which told me all
[1:18:50] things that ever I did is not this the
[1:18:52] Christ is this not the anointed word is
[1:18:54] it this what we've been looking for In
[1:18:56] the Flesh isn't it here isn't this the
[1:18:58] day of our
[1:18:59] visitation it says then they went out of
[1:19:01] the city and came onto him and we see if
[1:19:03] we contined Jesus stayed for two more
[1:19:05] days and many believed on him and they
[1:19:07] said we came out because of what you
[1:19:09] said but we believe because of what he
[1:19:11] said to
[1:19:12] us we can't go by somebody else's
[1:19:15] experience but it brings us in so we can
[1:19:16] listen and get our own experience with
[1:19:18] the anointed word
[1:19:20] ourselves he says watch that woman watch
[1:19:23] these Pharisees trained up and up you
[1:19:24] see they said that man is be this man is
[1:19:27] be elub he's a devil but look when the
[1:19:29] light flashed across that little
[1:19:31] predestinated seed there when it struck
[1:19:33] that real seed of God that was before
[1:19:35] the foundation of the world probably her
[1:19:38] name was put on the Lamb's Book of light
[1:19:40] when it struck that quickly she
[1:19:42] recognized it in her condition she
[1:19:46] recognized it Hallelujah in that Fallen
[1:19:50] condition in the difficulty she was
[1:19:52] facing in the sweatiness in the tired in
[1:19:55] all of these things in that yet it came
[1:19:57] to life under that anointed word
[1:20:00] hallelujah that's what we're looking for
[1:20:02] is for God to anoint his word so that we
[1:20:04] can latch on to it in whatever condition
[1:20:06] we're in this
[1:20:07] morning why he says she was ordained
[1:20:10] before the foundation of the world
[1:20:12] Church it does not matter where you are
[1:20:14] this morning to those that are listening
[1:20:17] to those that were praying for whether
[1:20:19] it's kids whether it's loved ones
[1:20:20] whether it's spouses whether it's people
[1:20:22] in other churches it does not matter how
[1:20:24] sick we are doesn't matter how tired we
[1:20:26] are doesn't matter how depressed we are
[1:20:28] how broken we are how unsure we are he
[1:20:31] will find you in your condition and he
[1:20:34] will give you the word that'll take you
[1:20:36] all the way through it amen that doesn't
[1:20:37] matter a single bit what we're like
[1:20:39] right now what matters is will we
[1:20:41] recognize and receive that anointed word
[1:20:43] when it comes our
[1:20:45] way we're in the final Gentile age we're
[1:20:48] in the Le ofan age in Revelation 3 all
[1:20:50] that's left now is resurrection and
[1:20:52] Rapture and we say can we do do it I say
[1:20:56] we can do it because he said we're going
[1:20:58] to do it he said there's going to be an
[1:20:59] overcomer there's going to be a reward
[1:21:01] there's going to be a people that leave
[1:21:03] this earth without seeing death amen
[1:21:05] that's not an event the Rapture is not
[1:21:07] an event it's a process we see it with
[1:21:09] Enoch scripture says that Enoch got a
[1:21:11] body change but it was a process because
[1:21:13] he walked with God he didn't just walk
[1:21:15] with God he walked and he walked and he
[1:21:18] walked and he walked and he walked and
[1:21:20] then one day he got a rapturing
[1:21:22] revelation I please him he's had happy
[1:21:24] with where I am I've wrapped myself in
[1:21:27] his righteousness I'm under his blood
[1:21:29] and he's ready to take me to rule and
[1:21:30] reign with him all he's doing brother
[1:21:33] Braham said what happened is he that
[1:21:34] foot came up and it didn't touch the
[1:21:36] ground and he said I might as well just
[1:21:37] take the next one and he just started
[1:21:39] walking up and he went right into
[1:21:42] Glory it's a
[1:21:44] process the Rapture is a process of
[1:21:46] building up our character and our faith
[1:21:49] so that we're fit to rule and reign with
[1:21:50] him and then we get a glorified body
[1:21:52] that takes away every of the last
[1:21:53] vestiges of sin that we have in our life
[1:21:56] I want to take one more example this
[1:21:58] morning are we
[1:21:59] good because we're talking about
[1:22:01] receiving a body change and I want us to
[1:22:04] see the progression here because we we
[1:22:06] we focus on the anointed word but you've
[1:22:07] got to you've got to see that the word
[1:22:08] is Anointed from start to finish you
[1:22:10] have an anointed word promise then you
[1:22:12] have an anointed word season and then
[1:22:14] you have the anointed word itself coming
[1:22:16] to you now we look in in Abraham and
[1:22:18] Sarah's life here and in Genesis 12 it
[1:22:20] says the Lord said unto Abram get thee
[1:22:22] out of thy country and from thy kindred
[1:22:24] from thy Father's House unto a land that
[1:22:26] I will show thee and I will make of thee
[1:22:28] a great nation and I will bless thee and
[1:22:30] make thy name great and thou shal be a
[1:22:32] blessing so here's the word promised now
[1:22:34] his family will be a great nation now
[1:22:37] church is this an anointed word is this
[1:22:38] the anointed word When God says it it's
[1:22:42] anointed right then the anointing
[1:22:44] doesn't come later it's anointed from
[1:22:46] the start amen because it's a word
[1:22:49] that's given with power to produce it
[1:22:51] the scripture says that my word will not
[1:22:53] return to me void that means it's
[1:22:55] anointed from the start to go out and
[1:22:57] produce what God Said Amen there is as
[1:23:00] much anointing on that right there in
[1:23:02] Genesis 12 as there ever would
[1:23:04] be there's no difference see what is is
[1:23:07] we catch it and we think that it's
[1:23:09] bigger and it's better and it's greater
[1:23:10] but it's always been there we're just
[1:23:12] catching it when it comes to us so
[1:23:14] Abraham leaves his family mostly in he
[1:23:15] country and he walks around a while and
[1:23:17] he finally separates from lot and does
[1:23:19] exactly what God asked him to do and so
[1:23:21] God comes down in Genesis 15 and he
[1:23:23] confirms the promise and he says now
[1:23:24] Abraham said behold thou Hast given me
[1:23:26] no seed and L one born in my house is my
[1:23:29] air he says God you said I was going to
[1:23:31] have I was going to be a great nation
[1:23:33] and you haven't given me a kid and now
[1:23:35] I've got a servant that's going to
[1:23:37] inherit everything if I die right now
[1:23:40] elazar will get
[1:23:42] it and behold the word of the Lord came
[1:23:45] unto
[1:23:46] him okay word promise Word season and an
[1:23:49] anointed word in flesh the word of the
[1:23:52] Lord came unto him saying this shall not
[1:23:53] be thine heir but he that shall come
[1:23:55] forth out of thine own bowels shall be
[1:23:57] thine air so here we have the anointed
[1:23:59] word has come forth said you're going to
[1:24:00] be a father of many nations you're going
[1:24:02] to be a blessing to all these people now
[1:24:04] he says you will father this child
[1:24:06] yourself see we have a generic word
[1:24:09] promise now he's making it personal to
[1:24:10] Abraham Abraham you're going to have a
[1:24:12] part to play in this right it's totally
[1:24:15] personal it's truly personal to Abraham
[1:24:17] now he's got a part to play the word is
[1:24:20] revealing his
[1:24:21] portion the word is revealing what he's
[1:24:23] supposed to do
[1:24:25] and then in Genesis 17 God said to
[1:24:27] Abraham as for Sarah thy wife Thou shalt
[1:24:30] not call her name Sarah but th but Sarah
[1:24:32] shall her name be and I will bless her
[1:24:35] and give thee a son also of her yay I
[1:24:38] will bless her and she shall be a mother
[1:24:39] of Nations Kings of people shall be of
[1:24:41] her so now there's a further revealing
[1:24:43] of the word of the bride's
[1:24:46] portion not just Abraham now now his
[1:24:49] family now his wife now his spouse is
[1:24:51] being lumped in with it see the
[1:24:53] revealing of the word word is getting
[1:24:54] more and more
[1:24:56] personal then Abraham fell upon his face
[1:24:59] and laughed and said in his heart shall
[1:25:01] a child be born unto him that is 100
[1:25:03] years old and shall Sarah that is 90
[1:25:06] years old bear so Abraham's doubt is
[1:25:08] based on what the passage of time
[1:25:11] they're at 24 years and so and some
[1:25:14] change here he's about to be 100 and he
[1:25:16] says God this is
[1:25:18] crazy I'm going to be 100 Sarah's 90 the
[1:25:22] promise of God has gotten stale that's
[1:25:24] what he's saying Lord we've gone too
[1:25:26] long we've gone too
[1:25:29] far but God
[1:25:31] said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a
[1:25:33] son indeed and thou shalt call his name
[1:25:36] Isaac and I will establish my Covenant
[1:25:38] with him for an Everlasting Covenant and
[1:25:41] with his seed after him he says but my
[1:25:43] Covenant will I establish with Isaac
[1:25:45] which sh Sarah shall bear unto thee at
[1:25:47] this set time in the next year Sarah
[1:25:50] will produce a child at 90 years old we
[1:25:52] have the word promise we have the word
[1:25:53] promis personal and now we have a Word
[1:25:56] season he says this time next year
[1:25:58] you'll have a
[1:26:00] son then we come to Genesis 18 word
[1:26:03] promise Word season now it's got to be
[1:26:05] anointed word in
[1:26:07] flesh says then the Lord appeared unto
[1:26:09] him in the plains of
[1:26:10] mamory and he sat in the tent Door In
[1:26:13] the Heat of the day what is it Church it
[1:26:15] says the Lord the anointed one amen it's
[1:26:19] God veiled in flesh and he lifted up his
[1:26:21] eyes and looked and lo three men stood
[1:26:23] by him and when he saw saw them he ran
[1:26:24] to meet them from the tent door and
[1:26:26] bowed himself toward the ground and said
[1:26:28] my Lord he only talks to
[1:26:30] one he says now if I have found favor in
[1:26:33] thy sight pass not away I pray thee from
[1:26:35] thy servant and so they come in and he
[1:26:37] he he's preparing a meal it says and
[1:26:39] they said unto him where is Sarah thy
[1:26:41] wife and he said behold she's in the
[1:26:42] tent and he said they're wondering but
[1:26:46] there's only one here and it says and he
[1:26:49] said I personal pronoun promise Giver
[1:26:53] anointed
[1:26:54] word I will certainly return unto thee
[1:26:58] according to the time of life and lo
[1:27:00] Sarah thy wife shall have a son and
[1:27:02] Sarah heard it in the tent door which
[1:27:04] was behind him now Abraham and Sarah
[1:27:06] were old and well stricken in age and it
[1:27:08] had ceased to be with Sarah after the
[1:27:09] manner of women therefore Sarah laughed
[1:27:12] within herself she did not laugh out
[1:27:14] loud she chuckled
[1:27:16] inside and said after I'm waxed old
[1:27:18] shall I have pleasure my Lord being old
[1:27:20] also she's like this ain't happening
[1:27:26] yeah and the Lord said unto Abraham
[1:27:30] wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I
[1:27:32] have shy Bear Child which am old is
[1:27:35] anything too hard for the Lord at the
[1:27:37] time appointed I will return unto thee
[1:27:42] now we've got the anointed word The
[1:27:44] promis Giver is right there and he says
[1:27:46] now the word's going to be made flesh in
[1:27:49] you it's not just outside of you now
[1:27:51] it's got to come into you and you're
[1:27:53] going to produce the promised word for
[1:27:55] your time for your age for your season
[1:27:57] for you
[1:28:00] personally is anything too hard for the
[1:28:03] Lord at the time appointed Church
[1:28:05] there's a time appointed I will return
[1:28:07] unto thee according to the time of life
[1:28:09] and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah
[1:28:11] denied saying I laughed not for she was
[1:28:15] afraid she knew who that was
[1:28:18] then he's talking like that she realizes
[1:28:22] uhoh the anointed word just discerned
[1:28:24] what was going on inside of me what she
[1:28:26] said was truthful from an outside
[1:28:28] perspective but see God goes straight to
[1:28:31] the heart and he sees what's in there he
[1:28:33] says no she laughed for she was afraid
[1:28:35] but he said nay but thou did laugh now
[1:28:37] catch what happened remember the woman
[1:28:39] at the well said Messiah will tell us
[1:28:40] these things it's not that he's telling
[1:28:43] her Doctrine on where to worship it's
[1:28:44] that Messiah will come and discern the
[1:28:46] thoughts and the intents of the heart
[1:28:48] for the purpose of setting the people
[1:28:50] free and so what happens is when Christ
[1:28:52] comes by way of that woman at the well
[1:28:54] what is it he comes and he gives the
[1:28:56] secrets of the heart and he tells her
[1:28:58] the truth of the matter and she says I'm
[1:29:01] just like Sarah he's doing what he did
[1:29:03] to Sarah and that's what made her
[1:29:05] recognize it it wasn't his doctrine that
[1:29:07] did it it was when he went into her life
[1:29:09] and he showed her what needed to be done
[1:29:10] there God's with Abraham and he he
[1:29:13] perceived Abraham's lack of belief
[1:29:15] earlier on and then he perceived it with
[1:29:17] Sarah even though she said nothing he
[1:29:18] says why did Sarah laugh and Sarah says
[1:29:20] I didn't laugh and she didn't laugh out
[1:29:21] loud but she laughed in her heart and
[1:29:23] the word you see is a discerner then of
[1:29:26] what's going on on the inside and if the
[1:29:28] anointed word comes our way Church it
[1:29:30] will surely do the same thing and the
[1:29:32] only question we have to ask is will we
[1:29:34] be
[1:29:35] honest or will we say no I didn't no I'm
[1:29:38] not that way no that's not my
[1:29:42] problem or will we say I know Jehovah's
[1:29:45] here I know the discerner is here I know
[1:29:48] the anointed word is
[1:29:50] here I love reading these things because
[1:29:53] as I said the word cannot return to God
[1:29:55] void Sarah laughed and she had doubt
[1:29:58] Abraham laughed and he had doubt they
[1:30:00] tried so many ways to make it happen on
[1:30:02] their own and all they did was make a
[1:30:03] big
[1:30:06] mess but that word promise was
[1:30:09] given that God said the season for the
[1:30:11] Fulfillment of the word is here then the
[1:30:13] anointed word came in flesh to her and
[1:30:15] he says Abraham it's time for you to get
[1:30:17] the reality of what we've been talking
[1:30:18] about all this
[1:30:21] time God's saying now is the time and
[1:30:24] Abraham and Sarah say we got
[1:30:27] nothing every opportunity we had is
[1:30:30] behind
[1:30:31] us and now you're saying it's the
[1:30:35] time why because the power is in the
[1:30:38] word not in me power is in the word it's
[1:30:40] not in you that's my rest is on what he
[1:30:43] said not on what I am not on what I do
[1:30:46] Sarah never could have children if you
[1:30:48] look in the scriptures her body just
[1:30:49] wasn't built for it it wasn't right she
[1:30:51] was always incapable of having a child
[1:30:53] and so God didn't fix her body God gave
[1:30:55] her a new
[1:30:57] body and here's the thing I would
[1:30:59] imagine with Sarah here's a thing God
[1:31:03] knows how to do a work you think you
[1:31:05] don't have faith when God's done you'll
[1:31:07] have faith because Sarah and I don't
[1:31:09] know if it happened
[1:31:11] overnight for her and for Abraham I
[1:31:13] genuinely don't know the scripture
[1:31:14] doesn't tell us but all we know is Sarah
[1:31:16] went from an old woman that couldn't
[1:31:19] have children to the point where the
[1:31:22] king of guar aimc chooses a 90-year-old
[1:31:25] woman as the most beautiful woman he's
[1:31:27] ever seen women if that wouldn't give
[1:31:29] you faith I don't know what
[1:31:31] is
[1:31:34] amen they did a
[1:31:36] poll on what attracts men to women and
[1:31:38] women to men based on age and for women
[1:31:42] they're attracted to men roughly at the
[1:31:43] same age they are you know what women
[1:31:45] men are attracted to women 21 to 23
[1:31:48] their entire life Sarah got a 21y old
[1:31:51] body as a 90-year-old
[1:31:54] and the King took her and tried to make
[1:31:56] her his wife until God stopped him
[1:31:58] amen I'm guessing that gave Sarah a
[1:32:01] little bit of confidence that God was
[1:32:02] going to do a work can you imagine she
[1:32:04] went to bed wrinkled and
[1:32:06] old maybe
[1:32:09] chubby completely out of shape nothing
[1:32:13] where it was supposed to
[1:32:15] be and she wakes up the next
[1:32:18] morning and Abraham's left the tent
[1:32:21] because he's convinced that another
[1:32:22] woman has come into his bed
[1:32:26] what will the anointed word do for us
[1:32:28] church if it can change Sarah's body it
[1:32:31] can take us out of this pest house amen
[1:32:35] hallelujah her experience with the
[1:32:38] Living God is what gave her
[1:32:39] faith look at what the scripture says as
[1:32:41] we start to close through faith also
[1:32:45] Sarah herself received strength to
[1:32:48] conceive
[1:32:50] seed her experience with God gave her
[1:32:53] faith to prod produce the word promise
[1:32:55] God never said I'm going to give you a
[1:32:57] new body God said I'm going to give you
[1:32:58] a son and that included the new body
[1:33:01] with it though he never told her and she
[1:33:04] wakes up one day maybe it took days who
[1:33:06] knows I like to think it happened in in
[1:33:08] a moment in a twinkling of an
[1:33:12] eye that's the
[1:33:14] type but
[1:33:16] regardless something changed and all of
[1:33:19] a sudden she realized this is really
[1:33:21] going to happen
[1:33:24] she received strength in due season to
[1:33:26] conceive seed she never could before and
[1:33:29] was delivered of a child when she was
[1:33:31] past age because she judged him faithful
[1:33:33] who have promised you might say what
[1:33:36] does this have to do with teach My Hands
[1:33:37] to War we're learning how to wait we're
[1:33:42] learning how to trust we're learning how
[1:33:44] to keep our mind centered on the things
[1:33:45] of God we've got to find our word our
[1:33:49] our word promise we've got to find our
[1:33:52] Word season and then we've got to say I
[1:33:55] need that word to be anointed in my life
[1:33:58] amen scripture says every bit of the
[1:34:00] word of God is given by inspiration it's
[1:34:02] profitable for Doctrine for reprove for
[1:34:04] correction and instruction and
[1:34:05] righteousness but there's a portion
[1:34:07] that's just for us and nobody else can
[1:34:09] fulfill it we're in the end of the
[1:34:10] church ages we're in Revelation 3 and
[1:34:12] the lean Church age we've got to
[1:34:14] overcome
[1:34:15] lukewarmness get in or get
[1:34:17] out that's really what he's saying I
[1:34:20] want you to get in or I want you to get
[1:34:22] out but I don't want you to stay in the
[1:34:24] middle there where you're not any good
[1:34:25] to
[1:34:26] me we're in Revelation 10 in the open
[1:34:28] book we're not in Revelation 10:7 Church
[1:34:31] we're in Revelation
[1:34:33] 108 and he said unto John take the book
[1:34:36] and eat it and thou must prophesy you
[1:34:39] must speak the word and it has to come
[1:34:41] into effect in your life it can't stay
[1:34:43] with the mighty angel now it's got to
[1:34:45] come down into the bride it's got to
[1:34:46] come down into the people of of an end
[1:34:48] time rapturing message amen we're in
[1:34:51] Malachi 4 where our h hearts are being
[1:34:54] turned back to the original faith of the
[1:34:56] Pentecostal fathers not a Pentecostal
[1:34:58] move not Pentecostal signs and wonders
[1:35:01] but the original faith that kept them in
[1:35:03] tune with the Holy
[1:35:05] Ghost we're in 1 Thessalonians 4 at the
[1:35:08] time of the Resurrection The Rapture
[1:35:11] amen we're in Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ
[1:35:14] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:35:18] we see all these people we see Sarah and
[1:35:20] Abraham and many Heroes of the faith and
[1:35:23] they held on that portion of the word
[1:35:24] and they just kept
[1:35:27] walking scripture says Abraham called
[1:35:29] those things that were not as though
[1:35:31] they were and those things that were as
[1:35:32] though they were not his confession was
[1:35:34] the word is
[1:35:35] true and he just walked day by day and
[1:35:38] we see the faults we see the flaws we
[1:35:41] see the Disobedience we see the trying
[1:35:42] to make it happen but not a single thing
[1:35:45] stopped that word from coming to pass in
[1:35:46] their life and that word was settled
[1:35:49] sometimes I think it showed their faith
[1:35:51] that they tried to make it happen cuz
[1:35:52] they believed it was going to happen and
[1:35:54] they thought maybe I can make it happen
[1:35:56] we can't make it happen we can't make it
[1:35:58] happen but if we'll yield to it and
[1:36:01] trust God he brings it to pass in our
[1:36:03] life
[1:36:04] amen scripture says this as we close the
[1:36:07] musicians can come wait on the Lord be
[1:36:11] of good courage and he shall strengthen
[1:36:14] thine
[1:36:15] heart wait on the Lord that's the trial
[1:36:17] of our faith the scripture says the
[1:36:18] trial of faith worketh it produces
[1:36:20] patience be of good courage and he shall
[1:36:23] there's a certainty with the word shall
[1:36:26] it means it's going to happen it's
[1:36:27] inevitable he shall strengthen thine
[1:36:29] heart wait I say on the Lord he says and
[1:36:33] I'll say this my brother he'd come from
[1:36:35] Glory this afternoon to set any one of
[1:36:37] you free that's right he will come down

[1:36:45] this morning to make you
[1:36:49] right that's not just your body that's
[1:36:52] your mind
[1:36:54] remember Jesus came to heal the
[1:36:57] brokenhearted those that were
[1:37:00] bruised it's not just the physical it's
[1:37:02] the mental it's the it's the emotional
[1:37:04] side it's the entire thing he's here
[1:37:06] with healing in his wings he says he'll
[1:37:08] come to heal you this afternoon to make
[1:37:10] you right just let him find one sincere
[1:37:12] heart that he can get into he will come
[1:37:15] any time any hour of the night I'm so
[1:37:18] thankful we have a doctor that'll come
[1:37:20] anytime he says oh I'm so happy for that
[1:37:23] to know that he's my refuge and strength
[1:37:25] the very present help in the time of
[1:37:28] trouble amen God bless you let's stand
[1:37:30] together if we
[1:37:32] would wait on the Lord be of good
[1:37:34] courage and he will strengthen thine
[1:37:36] heart wait I say on the lord it's a
[1:37:38] trial of our faith it's a hardest thing
[1:37:39] for the Believers the waiting the
[1:37:41] uncertainty the not seeing the not
[1:37:44] knowing except that something in your
[1:37:46] heart tells you but this is what
[1:37:48] believers do they
[1:37:50] believe amen that's what Overcomers do
[1:37:52] is they overcome and they do it by faith
[1:37:54] that he's going to do the work amen that
[1:37:56] he's got a redeeming work he's got a
[1:37:58] healing work he's got a leading work
[1:37:59] he's got a rapturing work that's going
[1:38:01] on whether we see it or not and
[1:38:03] sometimes the only thing we can have is
[1:38:05] that cry in our heart but I'm thankful
[1:38:07] it's there that when it looks so far
[1:38:10] beyond anything I've ever experienced so
[1:38:12] far beyond anything I've ever preached
[1:38:13] when it's so far beyond anything that
[1:38:15] I've seen anybody else do yet there's a
[1:38:17] cry there there's a longing in my heart
[1:38:19] to be with him and there's a cry that's
[1:38:21] going to take us there and it brings
[1:38:22] that anointed word to us and it brings
[1:38:24] it into our bodies it brings it into our
[1:38:26] flesh it brings our our our very nature
[1:38:29] subject to what's going to happen by
[1:38:31] that anointed word
[1:38:32] amen I pray God help us keep our minds
[1:38:36] seted on him amen that we'd spend our
[1:38:39] days and we have so much Satan is a
[1:38:41] master of filling our days but I'll tell
[1:38:44] you if we take stock of how we're
[1:38:46] spending our time I believe we can do a
[1:38:47] little more for him I believe we can do
[1:38:49] a lot more for him amen that we can we
[1:38:52] can have that tension day by
[1:38:54] day I love how brother R said to the he
[1:38:57] said to the sisters he said whether
[1:38:58] you're washing your dishes Brothers
[1:39:00] whether you're about your work it
[1:39:01] doesn't matter keep your mind centered
[1:39:03] on him and he'll draw near to you and
[1:39:04] he'll give you strength to face your day
[1:39:06] he'll give you strength for your heart
[1:39:07] to hold on to those things that you're
[1:39:09] you're holding before the throne of
[1:39:10] grace amen amen let's bow our heads
[1:39:14] together Heavenly
