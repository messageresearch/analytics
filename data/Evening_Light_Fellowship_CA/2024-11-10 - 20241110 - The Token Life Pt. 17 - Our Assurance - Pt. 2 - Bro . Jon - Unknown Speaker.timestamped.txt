[18:54] amen praise the
[18:57] lord we get
[18:59] to see each other one more
[19:02] time
[19:04] amen I was attending Services here when
[19:07] we had your when you had your dedication
[19:10] meetings and uh I managed to get in the
[19:13] first two and I went home that Thursday
[19:16] night and to my brother's place I was
[19:18] there by myself and
[19:20] uh I made myself a coffee and a sandwich
[19:24] and and
[19:26] uh I felt a little
[19:29] something going on here and I thought
[19:31] well it's a heartburn maybe I ate
[19:33] something or something you know and it
[19:36] was 10:00 at night
[19:38] and so I made my sandwich had my coffee
[19:43] and and I decided to go to bed but I
[19:46] couldn't get I couldn't get comfortable
[19:48] at
[19:49] all CU it just going on in my chest
[19:53] there and
[19:55] uh
[19:57] so I got up got dressed and went to the
[20:01] kitchen table and so I thought well
[20:04] something's going on in my chest I don't
[20:06] know I have no idea what it is
[20:08] but I phoned the ambulance and they came
[20:12] two young
[20:13] girls and
[20:15] uh she laid me in the stretcher and in
[20:19] the ambulance right out in front of the
[20:20] house there and she says you're having a
[20:23] heart
[20:24] attack
[20:27] so so they put the lights and all that
[20:30] stuff on and the way we went and and
[20:33] ended up one of my arteries was 100%
[20:36] blocked
[20:38] and and they they did the procedure
[20:42] right away and or tried to and
[20:48] um put a tried to put a stint in
[20:51] there right and it was too blocked they
[20:54] couldn't do it so they did some kind of
[20:56] a uh you go ahead have your seat for a
[20:59] moment and uh and
[21:03] uh they did some kind of electric
[21:05] procedure where they blasted you know
[21:08] electric pulse I guess or something like
[21:11] that but anyways it was 100% blocked so
[21:14] it ended up it's 80% blocked after that
[21:18] procedure
[21:19] so I'm thinking Lord uh am I just living
[21:24] on 20% of
[21:27] my original
[21:31] capabilities or what my heart should be
[21:34] putting out 100% And it's only putting
[21:35] out 20% now cuz the other 80% still
[21:39] blocked so I say whatever the Lord has
[21:43] in store for me it's it's been working
[21:46] well ever since you know and uh I've
[21:50] been exercising a little bit through
[21:53] walking and watching my food intake and
[21:56] that sort of thing but uh
[21:59] but
[22:01] uh that was in August and I went home
[22:05] and I was using my nephew's car while I
[22:09] was here before the heart
[22:12] surgery and uh he's 65 he was a
[22:16] professor at the University here
[22:19] Memorial
[22:20] University he's a physicist so he he he
[22:25] rose to Great Heights in the world
[22:29] and very popular man with his students
[22:32] and and his co-workers and so
[22:35] on and uh and he he he helped a lot of
[22:41] uh people out during his lifetime you
[22:45] know 65 years and uh I could go through
[22:50] his life at that's that's not important
[22:54] this morning now but uh he did live a
[22:56] good life and and after I went back home
[23:00] I found out that uh he just got
[23:04] diagnosed with the liver cancer and
[23:07] pancreatic
[23:10] cancer so it uh kind of put a death
[23:13] sentence on them you
[23:27] know so
[23:29] I text him
[23:31] and and it was it was in the time when
[23:35] brother John Andy's back at West there
[23:38] was
[23:39] having some meetings they have summer
[23:42] meetings at
[23:43] the in in uh Lyon Washington they it's a
[23:48] fair type of thing and they have a booth
[23:51] set up where they they witness all what
[23:55] God has done in our generation you know
[23:57] and all that that on all the Miracles
[23:59] that took place in different individuals
[24:02] lives there Brothers and Sisters in
[24:05] Christ and
[24:08] uh so uh Rick was dealing that's my
[24:12] nephew Rick was dealing
[24:14] with this uh was all brand new to him
[24:18] and he wasn't expecting that I don't
[24:21] believe nobody's expecting that right so
[24:24] he
[24:26] uh he was dealing with it and night and
[24:28] I text him and I said you know realizing
[24:32] his condition and so on I and I told him
[24:35] I have these testimonies that I can
[24:38] forward to you you know of the healing
[24:43] virtue of God's
[24:45] grace that a person
[24:48] can grasp you know and and be
[24:54] healed but uh he didn't he didn't want
[24:56] to have that at the moment and he said
[24:59] he was just dealing with the issues at
[25:01] hand the cancer and so on and just hold
[25:06] off he just told me to hold off on
[25:08] it and now I come down to his funeral to
[25:13] his memorial service you know and that's
[25:16] how quick life you know you never know
[25:20] that scripture life is a vapor you know
[25:23] it's here in a moment's time it's like a
[25:25] cloud going over your life and it is
[25:29] gone in a moment in a
[25:32] blink and uh
[25:36] so I thank the Lord for you know we
[25:40] can't go until the purpose of God is
[25:43] fulfilled in our lives
[25:45] and and uh so just remembering his
[25:50] family his wife had two
[25:54] children and his siblings my sister Mary

[27:17] Refuge
[27:20] amen if you cross reference that in your
[27:22] schoolfield

[41:31] Lord Lord it's our prayer this
[41:34] morning Lord that as we've come into
[41:36] your presence Lord into this building
[41:38] dedicated to your
[41:40] worship Lord that as your word would now
[41:42] come forth Lord that we'd be able to
[41:44] feed on it Lord that this wouldn't just
[41:46] be a church experience Lord that this
[41:49] just wouldn't be a a ritual or a habit
[41:51] Lord but it would be a time where we
[41:53] feed Lord and we get filled up on the
[41:55] good things of God Lord that we take it
[41:58] in Lord so that it can produce itself
[42:00] inside of us Heavenly Father each one
[42:03] Lord we're asking you to come by your
[42:05] word this morning Lord that it would
[42:07] have the preeminence in our midst this
[42:09] morning Lord not just the word Lord but
[42:11] the spirit of the word Lord that we
[42:13] would be Lord the spirit would connect
[42:15] with the spirit within us Lord and it
[42:16] would produce itself all over again we
[42:19] pray Lord and in doing so it would push
[42:21] out everything contrary to your word
[42:24] Lord that it would push out every doubt
[42:26] every fear Lord every concern every
[42:28] worry every stress every sickness Lord
[42:31] everything that would come up against
[42:33] that Kingdom within us Lord we pray your
[42:35] word would have full control this
[42:37] morning Lord Jesus Lord forgive us for
[42:39] our shortcomings Lord forgive me where I
[42:42] fall Lord forgive me where I fail
[42:44] forgive me where I won't move Lord but I
[42:46] pray that you'd help me to do better
[42:48] today and tomorrow Lord as we walk this
[42:50] path with you Lord strengthen us for
[42:53] battle Lord give us courage Lord give us
[42:55] Faith to take you at your word we pray
[42:58] Lord for we ask these things in Jesus
[43:00] Christ's name amen and amen amen God
[43:03] bless you turn if you would to Hebrews
[43:06] chapter 13 Hebrews chapter 13 and verse
[43:09] 20 amen good to be here this morning
[43:11] sure blowing a gale out there feels like
[43:13] newf land again amen but we're certainly
[43:16] glad to be here good to see brother Jim
[43:18] douly he uh he he just dropped in on us
[43:22] this morning no advaned warning which
[43:24] means he probably didn't want to preach
[43:27] and honestly in his condition we
[43:28] probably wouldn't push him to do it but
[43:30] it's good to see him looking fit and
[43:31] healthy amen we thank the Lord for
[43:33] sparing him amen sister Melody and
[43:35] brother Kingsley are back home of course
[43:37] with their their young son again and uh
[43:41] similar to what it was with Josh and
[43:42] Michelle we won't see Sister Sister
[43:44] melody or their boy for about a couple
[43:47] months until they get the baby fully
[43:49] vaccinated that's just the way they do
[43:51] things so um she'll be home for a while
[43:54] we may see brother Kingsley from time to
[43:55] time but my wife will send out an email
[43:58] to the sisters on how they can help if
[44:00] they want to help concerning their
[44:01] dietary needs their preferences those
[44:03] different things but they're also
[44:05] waiting on her mother to come into the
[44:07] country and they're waiting on a visa to
[44:09] be approved for her so we want to pray
[44:11] that that'll come through and she'll
[44:13] stay for at least six months usually
[44:14] it's for a year I don't know if they'll
[44:16] get a visa for that long but once her
[44:18] mother comes in she will kind of take
[44:19] over those things but if you want to
[44:21] help then my wife is the one to talk to
[44:23] about that amen amen Hebrews chapter 30
[44:27] and verse 20 says this now the God of
[44:29] Peace that brought again from the dead
[44:31] our lord Jesus that great Shepherd of
[44:34] the sheep through the blood of the
[44:36] Everlasting Covenant make you perfect in
[44:39] every good work to do his will working
[44:42] in you that which is well pleasing in
[44:44] his sight through Jesus Christ to whom
[44:47] be glory forever and ever amen God bless
[44:50] you you can have your seats again this
[44:52] morning we're continuing the series on
[44:54] the Holy Ghost and we started a a subt
[44:57] topic of our Assurance last service on
[44:59] Wednesday night and we're going to
[45:01] continue that thought this morning and
[45:02] we talked last service how that God came
[45:04] down to deliver Israel in Egypt to
[45:07] redeem them to take them out of slavery
[45:09] and into Liberty and he did so under a
[45:11] promise amen God judged Egypt and he
[45:14] brought the plagues on Egypt and he kept
[45:15] Israel safe from those first nine
[45:18] plagues but on the 10th plague which was
[45:19] death God said you've got to come
[45:21] through this one and you have to do what
[45:23] I tell you to do in order to be safe and
[45:25] so God made a provided way for them so
[45:28] that they they could get through it but
[45:30] they had to take his way they couldn't
[45:31] come their own way they had to take God
[45:33] had his word and it was a new way it was
[45:36] something they'd never done before
[45:37] something they'd never been taught
[45:38] before but they did it in faith because
[45:41] God said it to do it and if they did it
[45:43] that way then they'd be okay and God
[45:44] required them to kill a perfect lamb and
[45:47] take the blood of that lamb and put it
[45:48] on the lentil on the doorpost on the
[45:51] front door of their home and it was a
[45:52] public testimony and me that was where
[45:54] God drew the dividing line was will you
[45:57] will you admit that you're a Believer
[45:58] and will you commit to being a Believer
[46:00] not just in the privacy of your own home
[46:02] but to the people walking down the
[46:03] street to the ones that are outside that
[46:05] could persecute you for it in these
[46:07] different things and so the testimony
[46:09] was that they believe the word of God
[46:11] Amen that's really what that blood
[46:12] testified is that they believed the word
[46:14] of God Amen and we read this scripture
[46:17] in Exodus 12:13 where we get this this
[46:20] thought on the token in our Assurance
[46:21] this morning it says and God said and
[46:23] the blood shall be to you for a token
[46:26] upon the hous is where you are and we
[46:28] taught that a token is something that
[46:30] proves that a price has been paid amen
[46:33] we don't really do it these days because
[46:34] everything's digital but in the old days
[46:36] if you were going by bus then you would
[46:38] have a token or you could have if you
[46:40] you were going on a train you'd have a
[46:42] token and it was just a piece of metal
[46:44] that would show that you had paid the
[46:46] price and so God says this is the token
[46:48] this is the proof that the price is paid
[46:51] is the blood on your doors he says and
[46:53] when I see the blood when I see the
[46:55] token I will pass over you and the
[46:58] plague shall not be upon you to destroy
[47:00] you when I smite the land of Egypt so
[47:03] God said that blood is the token that's
[47:05] what I'm looking for I need to see that
[47:07] the price has been paid I need to see
[47:09] the proof that you believe and you've
[47:11] obeyed my word and if I see that you
[47:13] can't be touched by this plague you
[47:15] can't be touched by my judgment amen and
[47:17] God required that token you couldn't
[47:19] take the blood of another animal and it
[47:21] would work you couldn't take the blood
[47:22] of an imperfect lamb it had to be
[47:24] exactly the way God said to do it it or
[47:27] God couldn't recognize it amen if it
[47:29] wasn't done according to his word you
[47:31] couldn't hold him to his Covenant you
[47:33] couldn't hold him to his promise amen
[47:36] but we know that everything that was
[47:37] done in the Old Testament is a type it's
[47:39] a shadow it's pointing to something
[47:42] coming down the road it's a
[47:43] representation of what's coming under
[47:45] the new testament which is the New
[47:47] Covenant amen under the Old Testament
[47:49] things were imperfect it was a temporary
[47:52] Confidant it was a temporary agreement
[47:54] for Humanity amen until God would come
[47:57] down as our savior and pay that full
[47:59] price and the blood of those lambs and
[48:01] goats and Bulls couldn't pay the price
[48:04] but it could cover the sin amen it
[48:06] couldn't pay the price for sin but it
[48:08] would cover that sin but the problem was
[48:10] the sin Deb kept building up and
[48:12] building up and building up amen but
[48:14] when Christ came and died for our sins
[48:17] he didn't cover the sin he paid for the
[48:19] sin he erased the sin he separated it
[48:22] from us amen he was a perfect human he
[48:24] lived a perfect life he was a perfect
[48:27] sacrifice for our sins and he gave his
[48:29] own life voluntarily so that our sin
[48:32] debt could be paid it was amazing
[48:34] yesterday as I was listening to a
[48:37] Catholic priest don't ask me why I was
[48:39] listening to a Catholic priest but I was
[48:41] listening to him and he said now they
[48:43] believe he says Protestant Protestants
[48:45] believe that Christ became sin he says
[48:49] but we believe that his work was so
[48:51] perfect that God accepted it versus our
[48:54] sin but the scripture says he became sin
[48:58] who knew no sin see God came down in
[49:01] flesh and he took our place he literally
[49:04] became you and I so that we could become
[49:07] you and him amen and in doing so he
[49:10] fulfilled the law how do you fulfill the
[49:12] law remember what a covenant is a
[49:15] covenant is a contract and what was
[49:17] required to fulfill that contract was a
[49:20] life for a life amen that's the promise
[49:23] God had made God said there has to be a
[49:25] life for a life so when he came came
[49:26] down and with his perfect love his
[49:29] perfect life he shed his blood and gave
[49:32] his life for us he fulfilled the
[49:34] contract that means you are not held to
[49:36] that contract anymore you're not held to
[49:38] a contract of where your conduct is what
[49:40] God's judging you by now God's judging
[49:43] you by did you do what my word says
[49:46] because your sin is not what holds him
[49:47] back now what holds him back is whether
[49:49] you'll take him at his word amen so he
[49:52] moved us forward when Christ died for us
[49:54] and shed his blood he paid the price he
[49:57] fulfilled the law he fulfilled the first
[49:59] contract and now he opens up and that
[50:01] blood opens up a way now to the New
[50:03] Covenant the New Testament the new
[50:06] contract with God Amen and we went from
[50:08] law now to Grace law means you had to do
[50:11] it Grace says you have to receive it
[50:14] that's the difference between the two
[50:15] now Paul talks about this in Hebrews 10
[50:17] and we're going to spend most of the
[50:18] service in Hebrews 10 this morning he
[50:20] said for the law having a shadow of good
[50:23] things to come in other words it wasn't
[50:25] what was coming but was it was a
[50:27] reflection of it but it wasn't it it was
[50:30] pointing to good things it was pointing
[50:31] to an effective solution he says and not
[50:34] the very image of the thing so it was
[50:36] not the the actual thing it was a shadow
[50:38] of the actual he says that that law can
[50:42] never with those sacrifices which they
[50:44] offered year by year continually make
[50:46] the comers there unto perfect so the
[50:49] people that came and offered sacrifices
[50:51] year after year after year in perfect
[50:54] agreement with the law could not not be
[50:56] made perfect it couldn't do that work
[51:00] that's because the law was not there to
[51:01] make them perfect the law was there to
[51:04] cover them until they could come to a
[51:06] place of being made perfect so jumping
[51:08] to verse four it says for it is not
[51:11] possible that the blood of bulls and
[51:13] goats should take away sins that was
[51:15] what was required the sins had to be
[51:17] divorced from The Sinner and if the
[51:20] sinner has no sin then is it a sinner
[51:22] anymore
[51:23] no that's where you can come into
[51:25] Perfection is when the sins are divorce
[51:27] from the believer and then Christ is
[51:29] born between Verses 4 and N if we could
[51:31] put it that way and he's the answer to
[51:33] sin amen he's the one that will conquer
[51:36] sin completely see we didn't need a
[51:38] covering we needed a conqueror amen
[51:40] that's really what we needed we needed
[51:41] something that could take us Beyond sin
[51:44] in our lives and so Christ comes and he
[51:46] says in verse 9 then said he lo I come
[51:49] to do thy will o God he takes away the
[51:52] first that he may establish the second
[51:54] he's taking away the first Covenant
[51:57] the law that he may establish the second
[51:59] Covenant the second testament the second
[52:02] agreement amen and now he says in verse
[52:05] 10 by the which we are all are Will by
[52:09] the which will we are Sanctified through
[52:12] the offering of the blood of the body of
[52:14] Jesus Christ once for all now I want to
[52:17] break that down because he says by the
[52:19] which will we are because he did what
[52:22] was required we are Sanctified we are
[52:26] cleansed we are made pure through the
[52:28] offering of the body of Jesus Christ
[52:30] once for all that means it doesn't have
[52:33] to ever be done again it was done once
[52:36] it's a finished work amen it's a
[52:38] complete work you don't have to do it
[52:40] anymore you don't have to worry or Fred
[52:42] about your life you can move on into the
[52:45] grace of the New Covenant amen he says
[52:48] and every priest standeth daily
[52:50] ministering and offering often times the
[52:52] same sacrifices which can never take
[52:54] away sin so under the law the ministry
[52:57] was there over and over day and day and
[52:59] they had to be diligent if they didn't
[53:02] offer those sacrifices people
[53:05] died people were separated eternally
[53:07] from God they had to be diligent but it
[53:10] was just an a covering for sin they had
[53:12] a purpose God had called them God had
[53:15] placed them but they were just in a
[53:16] holding pattern they were just holding
[53:19] back the wrath of God by those
[53:21] sacrifices cuz Redemption couldn't move
[53:24] forward until the sin debt was paid amen
[53:26] Redemption was at a standstill all
[53:28] throughout the Old Testament yes God was
[53:30] moving towards it but it couldn't do
[53:32] anything it was just keeping them safe
[53:34] until God could do something about it
[53:36] but then we come to verse 12 he says but
[53:38] this man after he had offered one
[53:41] sacrifice for sins
[53:44] forever sat down on the right hand of
[53:46] God from henceforth expecting till his
[53:49] enemies be made his foot stol for by one
[53:53] offering he had perfected had have
[53:56] perfected past tense how long Church
[54:01] forever he has perfected it's a finished
[54:05] work Forever Until the End of Time all
[54:09] of them that are Sanctified do you
[54:11] realize what we just said church that we
[54:13] are in this little bubble of time but in
[54:15] the eyes of God we are perfect we are
[54:19] cleansed we are saved we are glorified
[54:22] we are Justified everything that we have
[54:25] need of that we're looking for in this
[54:26] life is already done in God's eyes when
[54:30] Christ died and paid the price that was
[54:32] it it was a finished work for you and I
[54:34] now we just have to walk through the
[54:36] script this morning by faith and say
[54:38] Lord I'm trusting you that that was a
[54:41] perfect work for me for my family for my
[54:43] house for my church family that's what
[54:46] we're looking for this morning amen when
[54:48] Christ offered himself it was a total
[54:51] and complete work done done done amen
[54:55] that's my rest this morning is it's a
[54:57] finished work of Calvary amen everything
[54:59] we have need of this morning is found in
[55:01] the offering of Jesus Christ at Calvary
[55:04] everything that we have need of Amen
[55:06] notice it's not just it doesn't say by
[55:09] one
[55:10] death it says by one offering cuz he
[55:13] didn't just come and give his life but
[55:15] he gave so much more amen he offered his
[55:18] body he offered his back he offered his
[55:20] head and his face as an offering he
[55:23] offered his very Spirit to us as part of
[55:26] a total offering that day at Calvary
[55:28] amen so it's not just the body it's not
[55:31] just the blood remember what it says in
[55:33] Isaiah 53 it says surely he hath borne
[55:36] our griefs and carried our sorrows he
[55:40] took our place it says yet we did esteem
[55:43] him stricken smitten of God and
[55:46] afflicted for he was wounded for our
[55:51] transgressions his death was not for
[55:53] that his wounding was for my
[55:55] transgressions says he was bruised for
[55:57] our iniquities when I do something and I
[56:00] know not to do it that's why he stood
[56:02] there and let them punch him repeatedly
[56:04] in the face it says the chastisement of
[56:07] our peace was upon him and with his
[56:10] stripes we are healed see he had to do
[56:13] so much more than give his life he had
[56:15] to go there and stay at the whipping
[56:17] post he had to let them press the Thorns
[56:19] into his head he had to let them pull
[56:21] the beard from his face he had to let
[56:23] them punch him and mock him and say who
[56:25] punched you if you're Prophet tell us
[56:27] why so that you and I could be healed we
[56:30] could be forgiven that it could cause
[56:32] God to look past us when we do that
[56:34] which we ought not to do and then he
[56:36] gave his life amen that's what happened
[56:39] at Calvary amen when Christ offered
[56:41] himself in the flesh he held nothing
[56:43] back he gave everything he had Body Soul
[56:47] and Spirit for you and I this morning
[56:50] amen and he exchanged places with you
[56:52] and I so that we could become him as he
[56:55] took our place amen
[56:58] why that offering was to be our total
[57:00] Deliverance it was our Perfection it was
[57:03] our maturing it was taking us back into
[57:06] relationship and position with God Amen
[57:09] Jesus Christ is the open door for our
[57:12] Redemption that's what he is he the open
[57:14] door to bring us back upon that path
[57:17] that takes us all the way back to the
[57:18] beginning amen when he died at Calvary
[57:21] he gave everything he had so we could
[57:23] receive it that's why he gave it up as
[57:26] so that you and I could receive it this
[57:27] morning and take it all the way back
[57:30] into the presence of God and every bit
[57:31] of pain and every bit of suffering he
[57:33] went through even to his very death was
[57:35] so that you and I could stand today as
[57:37] free sons and daughters in Christ
[57:40] receiving the blessings of God
[57:42] Amen remember he became us so we could
[57:46] become him amen there was an exchange
[57:48] there he took on sinful flesh so that we
[57:50] could take on his Perfection and be
[57:52] accepted in the presence of God that's
[57:54] why Hebrews 10:14 says he has perfected
[57:58] forever he has perfected forever because
[58:01] God dwelt in that flesh and he turned it
[58:03] around and said now God can dwell in you
[58:05] that's our Perfection amen Perfection
[58:08] was in Christ and when he came and gave
[58:09] himself at the cross that Perfection
[58:11] came over to you and I and now we get to
[58:13] have exactly what he has amen Paul said
[58:16] it's forever he has perfected forever
[58:19] Hallelujah forever you know what that
[58:22] takes the worry out of it doesn't it
[58:24] that takes the performance out of it
[58:26] that takes the Fring out of it this
[58:28] morning it means it's not working it's
[58:31] not it's not relying on Jonathan klette
[58:34] this morning it's already been done by
[58:36] Jesus Christ amen that's my rest this
[58:39] morning remember what Paul said in
[58:41] Romans 8 he says this there is therefore
[58:44] now no
[58:45] condemnation to them which are in Jesus
[58:49] Christ no condemnation I don't have to
[58:53] walk around with a with a conscience
[58:55] that's that that that that's active all
[58:58] the
[58:58] time listen he gives me a conscience to
[59:01] bring me to repentance but when I have
[59:03] repented and insincerity insincerity
[59:07] okay this is not something to be messed
[59:08] around with God help us but insincerity
[59:11] when we mess up we go and we say Lord
[59:14] Jesus I am sorry and we put it under the
[59:17] blood and we say help me not to do it
[59:18] again and we can go forward as if we
[59:21] never did it because in his eyes we
[59:23] never did it in the first place amen
[59:27] but he says there are no there's
[59:28] therefore now no condemnation to them
[59:30] which are in Christ now watch what
[59:33] defines that that that phrase to them
[59:35] that are in Christ amen is it to people
[59:37] that go to
[59:39] church is it to people that say they're
[59:42] Christians no those that are in Christ
[59:45] he says are those who walk not after the
[59:49] flesh but after the spirit those these
[59:52] are those that live the life of Christ
[59:55] and are led by the SP Spirit of Christ
[59:57] that's what determines those who are in
[59:58] Christ Jesus now catch this verse two he
[1:00:01] says for the law of the spirit of life
[1:00:04] in Christ Jesus has made me free from
[1:00:07] the law of sin and death now the law of
[1:00:09] sin and death could only
[1:00:11] condemn the law of sin and death could
[1:00:13] only condemn but he says now there's a
[1:00:15] different law here and it's the law of
[1:00:18] the spirit of life and there's a whole
[1:00:20] sermon in itself here but I'll just keep
[1:00:21] it short this morning it's not a law
[1:00:24] where you have to do it or else
[1:00:27] this is the law of life not only life
[1:00:30] but the spirit of life amen so it's not
[1:00:33] legalistic but what it means is that the
[1:00:35] life in you will Express itself so Paul
[1:00:39] says for the law of the life that's in
[1:00:41] me will Express itself that's what's
[1:00:43] made me free from the law of sin and
[1:00:45] death I'm not bound by sin because I've
[1:00:47] been set free from sin I've been born
[1:00:49] again I'm a new creation a new creature
[1:00:51] in Christ and there's a life inside of
[1:00:53] me that's producing something and I
[1:00:55] couldn't stop it if I
[1:00:57] tried that's the beauty of being born
[1:00:59] again is you're a new creation and what
[1:01:02] you are is what you will
[1:01:04] produce sheep don't try and produce wool
[1:01:07] they just produce wool That's the Law of
[1:01:10] the spirit of life of a sheep and so
[1:01:12] when you have the law of the spirit of
[1:01:14] the life of God what does it produce it
[1:01:16] produces God all over again that's the
[1:01:19] life that's inside amen why we don't
[1:01:21] have to have any condemnation because
[1:01:23] we've been set free from sin we're a new
[1:01:25] creat creature in Christ by the Spirit
[1:01:27] dwelling in US amen and it's power it's
[1:01:30] sin cleansing power it's overcoming
[1:01:32] power this morning if you have the Holy
[1:01:34] Ghost amen we're going to dwell on that
[1:01:36] much more in a future service but I want
[1:01:38] to read a little later in Romans 8 so
[1:01:40] you can see where you're living in
[1:01:41] Christ today I don't church I'm sick and
[1:01:44] tired of putting things off to the
[1:01:46] future if we're in the end times and we
[1:01:49] are then that means God's wrapping up
[1:01:52] everything that means god is looking to
[1:01:55] fulfill his total and complete word in
[1:01:57] you and I this morning so what are we
[1:01:59] waiting for I say be it unto me
[1:02:02] according to Thy word amen so let's see
[1:02:05] what Paul says not what you will be what
[1:02:07] you are amen he says in Romans 8:28 we
[1:02:11] know this scripture by heart I'm sure
[1:02:13] and we know that all things say it with
[1:02:15] me this morning all things all
[1:02:19] things brother John it's tough this
[1:02:21] morning isn't it brother Garfield it's
[1:02:23] tough but all things work together for
[1:02:26] our good this morning brother John my
[1:02:28] children are out it's for your good you
[1:02:32] say how can that be it's for their good
[1:02:35] look at Rahab what a life she lived and
[1:02:39] yet she was in the perfect place that
[1:02:41] when they came she could put the token
[1:02:43] on the door and out of that entire city
[1:02:46] of unbelievers her and her family were
[1:02:48] saved God put her in the perfect place
[1:02:51] at the perfect time to produce himself
[1:02:55] that's it all things are working for
[1:02:58] good all things work together for good
[1:03:02] to them that love God to them who are
[1:03:05] the called according to his
[1:03:07] purpose for whom he did Forno he also
[1:03:10] did predestinate to be conformed to the
[1:03:13] image of his son that he might be the
[1:03:15] firstborn among many Brethren that's you
[1:03:17] and I many Brethren is you and I this
[1:03:19] morning he's the first we the we the
[1:03:21] ones that come behind him he says now
[1:03:23] moreover he says not just those that He
[1:03:25] pred he says he doesn't stop at
[1:03:27] predestination whom he did predestinate
[1:03:30] them he also called so if God has
[1:03:32] ordained you to be saved if God knows
[1:03:35] you as his child then he's going to call
[1:03:37] you the greatest thing you can have this
[1:03:40] morning is a call to God because there
[1:03:42] are people walking around this Earth
[1:03:44] that have nothing in them to be drawn to
[1:03:47] God and if he doesn't call you scripture
[1:03:50] says no man can come to me except the
[1:03:52] father draw him
[1:03:53] first when God is p on you church that
[1:03:57] is the greatest evidence you have that
[1:04:00] you are a child of
[1:04:01] God at the
[1:04:04] start amen but we got to go through the
[1:04:06] complete process because sometimes what
[1:04:08] people get caught up in is the feeling
[1:04:10] of the call rather than the call itself
[1:04:13] because at some point the call gets
[1:04:15] difficult and that's where we see if
[1:04:17] there's really a deep calling to the
[1:04:18] Deep if there's something inside us
[1:04:19] being drawn back to God Amen so he said
[1:04:23] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:04:25] he also called and whom he
[1:04:27] called them he also Justified this is
[1:04:32] not future tense this is all past tense
[1:04:36] and whom he justified them he also
[1:04:39] glorified so this is already done the
[1:04:41] offering of Christ perfected us forever
[1:04:44] that was a finished work at Calvary that
[1:04:46] redeemed us that redeeming work put us
[1:04:48] back into perfection in God's eyes but
[1:04:51] we're stuck down in this little bubble
[1:04:53] of time and we've got to go through this
[1:04:54] process of being redeemed but the work
[1:04:56] is already finished in God's eyes amen
[1:04:59] and it's through the blood of Jesus
[1:05:00] Christ that he can't see our sin he
[1:05:03] can't see our faults he can't see our
[1:05:04] failures amen through that veil of blood
[1:05:07] all God can see is a Justified
[1:05:09] Sanctified glorified people that's where
[1:05:12] you're sitting this morning hallelujah
[1:05:16] amen God's not waiting as we said a few
[1:05:19] Services ago God's not waiting to see
[1:05:22] how you'll do before he moves from
[1:05:24] justification to sanctification
[1:05:26] ification and sanctification to the
[1:05:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost and from there
[1:05:30] into glorification he's not waiting on
[1:05:32] that God starts a work because he's
[1:05:34] going to finish a work and God doesn't
[1:05:35] start it if he's not going to finish it
[1:05:38] amen it's already there amen that's
[1:05:40] through a perfect sacrifice of Jesus
[1:05:42] Christ and because God knows it's a
[1:05:44] finished work he declares it in his word
[1:05:47] that's the Declaration of it he says
[1:05:49] what then what shall we then say to
[1:05:51] these things if God be for us who can be
[1:05:54] against us that ought to has change the
[1:05:56] way that we
[1:05:57] testify or confess maybe is a better
[1:05:59] word that when things are difficult when
[1:06:02] things are hard when things are tight
[1:06:04] when life isn't so easy when we're
[1:06:06] failing in sickness and health when it
[1:06:08] struggles in our marriage whatever it
[1:06:10] might be we ought to be able to say if
[1:06:13] God is for me who can do anything to me
[1:06:17] amen that's the that's what that
[1:06:18] scripture is saying if God's for us who
[1:06:20] can do anything ain't nobody can be God
[1:06:23] the only way anything can touch you this
[1:06:26] morning is because God lets it in there
[1:06:28] to help you produce some character to
[1:06:31] prove who you are that's the only thing
[1:06:33] it's not there to overcome you it's
[1:06:35] there to prove you that you are an
[1:06:38] overcomer
[1:06:39] amen if God is for us this morning why
[1:06:43] do we
[1:06:44] fret why do we
[1:06:46] worry listen I'm not saying you don't
[1:06:48] get weary in the
[1:06:50] battle but I'm saying why are we
[1:06:54] worrying where we're human we're
[1:06:57] flesh we get tired but why are we
[1:07:01] worried if he's for us nothing can hold
[1:07:05] us back except he allows it for a period
[1:07:08] of time and everything's only for a
[1:07:10] season it's only for a portion of time
[1:07:14] amen that doesn't mean we have to sit
[1:07:17] back by no means do I preach that amen
[1:07:20] we don't sit on our couch and say I'm a
[1:07:21] Believer and God's going to take me all
[1:07:22] the way to a resurrection and Rapture no
[1:07:24] we've got to be active in the the
[1:07:25] kingdom of God but the simple fact is
[1:07:27] this if you are about his business then
[1:07:30] God will take you through no matter what
[1:07:32] amen Paul said all things work together
[1:07:34] for our good all things work together
[1:07:36] for our good and that's the rest that I
[1:07:37] have and that's the rest you have this
[1:07:39] morning as a Believer he's working all
[1:07:41] things for my good everything amen if we
[1:07:44] could only sit back and remind ourselves
[1:07:46] of
[1:07:47] that I think that probably be one of the
[1:07:49] best scriptures you can put on your
[1:07:50] fridge when you go home today all things
[1:07:53] work together for good to them who are
[1:07:54] the called according to his purpose so
[1:07:57] whether things are good in your eyes or
[1:07:59] bad in your eyes you can read that and
[1:08:01] say but he's in it
[1:08:03] nonetheless we've been speaking about
[1:08:05] our Assurance this morning and God's
[1:08:07] trying to tell us I've got this I've got
[1:08:10] this it's already done it's already
[1:08:12] finished what you worrying about what's
[1:08:15] the struggle what's the fight here yes
[1:08:18] you've got to battle but let me let you
[1:08:20] know he's letting you know the victory
[1:08:22] is already assured the answer's on the
[1:08:25] way way amen God's in
[1:08:28] control don't worry just sit back and
[1:08:31] say Lord I believe Lord I believe
[1:08:36] amen it's like brother Hank said so you
[1:08:39] know last year when I was there he said
[1:08:41] we're just in a movie The Script is
[1:08:43] written and what's the script Church the
[1:08:45] script is the word of God and it's
[1:08:47] written and all God has there us as
[1:08:51] actors to write out something that's
[1:08:52] already declared from start to finish
[1:08:55] he's saying you're the good guys you're
[1:08:57] the Overcomers you're the children of
[1:08:59] God just keep doing what's written in
[1:09:01] the script and you'll make it all the
[1:09:03] way to the end don't worry about it
[1:09:05] don't deviate
[1:09:07] amen so he said for by one offering he
[1:09:10] hath perfected forever them that are
[1:09:13] Sanctified he says whereof the Holy
[1:09:16] Ghost also is a witness to us that we
[1:09:19] whereof means of this so in other words
[1:09:21] it means the Holy Ghost is also a
[1:09:23] witness to us of this of what what
[1:09:25] what's the Holy Ghost a witness to us of
[1:09:28] it's a witness that we are perfected
[1:09:31] amen not just perfected perfected
[1:09:34] forever amen not just a temporary thing
[1:09:37] the Holy Ghost is the evidence it's the
[1:09:39] proof that we are perfected forever in
[1:09:42] other words the Holy Ghost is the token
[1:09:45] amen it's the proof that the offering
[1:09:48] has been made the offering has been
[1:09:51] applied and the offering has been
[1:09:53] accepted amen it's proof that we're in a
[1:09:56] New Covenant now that we're in a new
[1:09:58] testament amen what's a witness for why
[1:10:02] do we need Witnesses you know if you've
[1:10:04] ever been in a car accident you need a
[1:10:06] witness because otherwise it's them
[1:10:08] against you but what you're looking for
[1:10:10] is that second witness that will confirm
[1:10:12] what happened man that's what a witness
[1:10:14] is for it's used to confirm something I
[1:10:17] remember when I lived in Alberta and I
[1:10:18] was out hunting with with my hunting
[1:10:20] partner out there and we are coming home
[1:10:22] and we are on this long straight road
[1:10:25] and you You Could See For Miles and
[1:10:27] probably about a kilometer away maybe
[1:10:29] 3/4 of a kilometer away I saw something
[1:10:31] come out of the ditch and it was tall it
[1:10:34] was completely black it was very smooth
[1:10:38] very agile and it came up and it crossed
[1:10:41] the a a two-lane road in about three or
[1:10:43] four
[1:10:44] strides okay so I'm about like I said
[1:10:47] 750 maybe a th000 meters away so it
[1:10:50] walked like a man it acted like a man
[1:10:51] but it was way bigger than a man okay
[1:10:54] I'm not I'm not trying toe prach some
[1:10:55] strange Doctrine this
[1:10:58] morning but I wasn't sure what I
[1:11:01] saw and so I didn't say anything and
[1:11:04] then my hunting buddy looked over me he
[1:11:05] said did you see
[1:11:08] that and I said I didn't
[1:11:11] say yes here's what I saw I said what
[1:11:14] did you see because see you can't put
[1:11:17] words into a witness's mouth it has to
[1:11:20] testify on its own and so I said what
[1:11:23] did you see and he described the exact
[1:11:26] thing that I had just said and we looked
[1:11:28] at each other and then he put his foot
[1:11:29] down on the accelerator and we got there
[1:11:31] in a hurry to see if we could see this
[1:11:32] thing and when we got there it had
[1:11:34] completely disappeared now I'm not
[1:11:36] preaching that I believe in a Sasquatch
[1:11:38] or Bigfoot but that's the only thing
[1:11:39] that made sense there it was the
[1:11:40] weirdest thing and if you know me I'm
[1:11:42] not into these things at all but this
[1:11:45] thing crossed the road in three or four
[1:11:47] steps and then disappeared gone and it
[1:11:50] didn't have a whole lot of places to
[1:11:51] hide either we couldn't believe it
[1:11:53] anyways we still talk about to this day
[1:11:55] but if he wasn't there I wouldn't have
[1:11:58] said anything about it but he was a
[1:12:00] witness and of his own mouth without me
[1:12:03] prompting him he told me exactly what I
[1:12:05] had seen with my own two eyes that's
[1:12:08] what a witness is there is to confirm
[1:12:11] Paul says the Holy Ghost is a witness to
[1:12:14] us it's a confirmation to us that what
[1:12:18] we believe has happened has actually
[1:12:21] happened that's what it is amen it's the
[1:12:24] second Witness that's required for
[1:12:26] anything to be proven the scripture says
[1:12:28] out of the mouth of two or three
[1:12:29] Witnesses let a thing be established I
[1:12:31] witness I've received it and the Holy
[1:12:33] Ghost Witnesses I've received that what
[1:12:35] the New Covenant the new the the the new
[1:12:38] contract the New Testament amen that
[1:12:40] Holy Ghost is a con it's a confirmation
[1:12:43] it's an
[1:12:44] assurance that I have passed from Death
[1:12:47] unto life
[1:12:49] amen it's the assurance that I become a
[1:12:52] new creation that you become a new
[1:12:54] creation a new creature in Christ now
[1:12:56] remember when Israel was getting ready
[1:12:57] to leave Egypt the blood was proof of a
[1:13:00] price that was paid but until that price
[1:13:03] was put on the
[1:13:04] door it didn't do them any good amen the
[1:13:08] Covenant of God the promise of God was
[1:13:10] only effective if they did what God had
[1:13:13] said to do in his Covenant amen they
[1:13:15] couldn't say when that death angel came
[1:13:17] down God knows my
[1:13:20] heart that doesn't work anymore Church
[1:13:23] it never really worked
[1:13:25] but you can't say God knows my heart I
[1:13:27] lived a good life that did not turn away
[1:13:30] the death angel what turned away the
[1:13:32] death angel was the blood on the door
[1:13:35] that was the only thing that worked God
[1:13:37] didn't say when I see your heart I'll
[1:13:39] pass over you God didn't say when I see
[1:13:41] your good works I'll pass over you God
[1:13:43] said when I see the token of the blood I
[1:13:46] will pass over you and until that was
[1:13:48] there the Covenant had no effect on you
[1:13:51] you can say I read it I believe it I
[1:13:53] accept it but until that blood was on
[1:13:55] the door you had no you had no assurance
[1:13:58] that the that the death angel was going
[1:14:00] to pass
[1:14:02] amen but remember in the Old Testament
[1:14:04] it's just a shadow and the blood the
[1:14:07] token back then was just protection from
[1:14:10] judgment that's all it did it was
[1:14:12] protection it was holding back the wrath
[1:14:14] of God but now we come into Hebrews 10
[1:14:16] and we see a different effect of the
[1:14:18] blood now we see a different effect of
[1:14:20] the Holy Ghost as the token for our life
[1:14:22] amen because now it's not just
[1:14:24] protection from the wrath of God because
[1:14:26] the blood completes the the law it
[1:14:28] fulfills the law it pushes the wrath of
[1:14:30] God away completely but now it's not
[1:14:32] just protection but it's
[1:14:34] access amen the token the Holy Ghost is
[1:14:37] access amen the blood of God was the key
[1:14:40] that open the door to Redemption and now
[1:14:43] that gives us the spirit that takes us
[1:14:45] along the path all the way back to God
[1:14:48] Amen that's what allows us to come back
[1:14:50] into relationship the blood opens the
[1:14:51] door but it's the spirit that takes us
[1:14:53] in if I can put it that way way now we
[1:14:56] see from the scripture that the Holy
[1:14:57] Ghost is proof positive that's what it
[1:14:59] is a witness is proof positive that God
[1:15:02] has accepted the sacrifice of Christ
[1:15:05] amen and it shows him you that he has
[1:15:08] accepted your sacrifice of what
[1:15:11] faith faith simple belief in his word
[1:15:14] amen that you've repented you've been
[1:15:16] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:15:18] then as a confirmation that you have
[1:15:20] followed his word he fulfills the rest
[1:15:22] of his word by giving you his very own
[1:15:24] spirit and now you're on the road back
[1:15:26] we're on the road to we're on the boat
[1:15:27] to China as brother Mark says we're
[1:15:29] going back and nothing's going to get us
[1:15:30] off the boat it's going to go all the
[1:15:31] way through so he said whereof the Holy
[1:15:34] Ghost also is made a witness to us for
[1:15:37] after that he had said before remember
[1:15:40] God fulfills his word God doesn't just
[1:15:43] come up with a bunch of new stuff he
[1:15:44] says the Holy Ghost is a witness to us
[1:15:47] and this is because he said he was going
[1:15:49] to do it there's nothing new happening
[1:15:50] in other words when it comes to the Holy
[1:15:52] Spirit it was prophesied before in
[1:15:54] Ezekiel 3
[1:15:55] six amen he said he put his new spirit
[1:15:58] in them and and we'll cover that in a
[1:16:00] moment but if you want to see where
[1:16:02] you're supposed to be today you've got
[1:16:03] to find it in the
[1:16:05] word because Paul's saying we're in the
[1:16:07] time of Ezekiel 36 we're in the time of
[1:16:10] Joel 228 that was the day of Pentecost
[1:16:13] that was their message for their day and
[1:16:14] if they had tried to continue on in the
[1:16:16] law which is what he was trying to get
[1:16:18] them out of in Hebrews right in Hebrews
[1:16:20] 4 he's trying to get them away from the
[1:16:22] Sabbath and into Christ who is our
[1:16:24] Sabbath trying to to get them away from
[1:16:25] a day and get them into the
[1:16:27] Eternal all these different things he
[1:16:29] was trying to get them away from death
[1:16:31] and bring them into life and it's
[1:16:34] through the Holy Ghost amen and he's
[1:16:35] saying there is a prophecy given that
[1:16:38] this Holy Ghost would come upon you and
[1:16:40] if you can accept that this is your day
[1:16:42] and your message then you can have what
[1:16:44] God has for you today it's that simple
[1:16:46] we've got to know the day we're living
[1:16:48] in so we can know the message we're
[1:16:49] supposed to be sitting under so we can
[1:16:51] know what we're supposed to be doing and
[1:16:52] receiving it all goes together
[1:16:55] and he says for this for after that he
[1:16:57] had said before this is the Covenant
[1:17:00] that I will make with them after those
[1:17:01] days so he had a covenant under the law
[1:17:04] but there's a covenant coming now that's
[1:17:05] different he says that that I will make
[1:17:08] with them after these days sayeth the
[1:17:09] Lord I will put my laws into their
[1:17:12] hearts and in their minds will I write
[1:17:14] them so God said it back in Ezekiel 36
[1:17:17] and that made it a promise and a
[1:17:19] covenant When God says anything it's a
[1:17:21] covenant cuz God can't lie amen we cover
[1:17:24] that last time but he had to fulfill his
[1:17:27] first Covenant before he could enter
[1:17:29] into the second Covenant you can't have
[1:17:31] two contracts that are contrary to one
[1:17:33] another simultaneously you've got to
[1:17:35] satisfy the first before you can go into
[1:17:36] the second and then he says and their
[1:17:39] sins and iniquities will I remember no
[1:17:41] more remember what Paul said perfected
[1:17:43] Forever This is the Fulfillment of it or
[1:17:45] this is the the prophecy of it he says
[1:17:48] now where where there is remission now
[1:17:50] where remission of these is there is no
[1:17:52] more offering of sin that word remission
[1:17:55] means full forgiveness and full
[1:17:57] separation so he says where there's full
[1:17:59] forgiveness and Liberty you don't have
[1:18:01] to keep coming back and begging God to
[1:18:03] forgive
[1:18:04] you amen the Roman Catholics will preach
[1:18:07] you got to pre you got to say a bunch of
[1:18:08] hail marries listen you go once and it's
[1:18:11] done and you don't have to hail Mary or
[1:18:14] anybody else there's only one mediator
[1:18:16] between God and man and that is the man
[1:18:18] Jesus
[1:18:19] Christ amen you don't have to pray your
[1:18:22] family out of purgatory there there is
[1:18:25] no such a thing me you don't have to
[1:18:27] come back and forth you don't have to
[1:18:29] pay a price Christ paid the price you
[1:18:31] just have to take that payment that's it
[1:18:35] that's it amen everything else is false
[1:18:37] religion Christ paid the complete price
[1:18:39] so that we can accept it and move
[1:18:41] forward with God Amen we don't have to
[1:18:43] keep coming back to things in our past
[1:18:45] we don't have to do
[1:18:47] it now what is this supposed to do for
[1:18:49] us verse 19 says having therefore
[1:18:51] Brethren boldness to enter into the
[1:18:55] holiest by the blood of Jesus he's
[1:18:56] talking about the holy of holies in the
[1:18:58] temple and that was the place where the
[1:19:00] Ark of the Covenant was that's where the
[1:19:02] the the Mana was that's where Aaron's
[1:19:04] Rod was the Almond rod and that was
[1:19:06] where the dwelling place of God Was His
[1:19:07] shikina glory the presence of God was
[1:19:10] there in that Temple and only one person
[1:19:13] could come twice a year into that twice
[1:19:16] on the same day and it was the high
[1:19:18] priest so one person on one day of the
[1:19:20] year could go into the holiest of holies
[1:19:22] and he had to come in with blood for
[1:19:24] himself to cover his own sins and then
[1:19:26] if God accepted that then he would go
[1:19:28] out and then he would come in again with
[1:19:29] blood for the s for the sins of the
[1:19:31] people and he would pour it over on the
[1:19:33] altar uh or the seat that was on the Ark
[1:19:36] of the Covenant and he would turn the
[1:19:38] Judgment seat into a Mercy Seat but the
[1:19:41] presence of God was there and if you
[1:19:42] came in and you were not the high priest
[1:19:45] if you came in and you didn't have blood
[1:19:47] or you came in aside from that one day
[1:19:49] of the year God struck you dead
[1:19:52] immediately it was judgment to enter the
[1:19:55] presence of God and then Paul comes here
[1:19:58] in verse 19 and he says have boldness to
[1:20:01] enter the holiest what they could only
[1:20:04] enter one person once a year he says
[1:20:06] everybody can go in and you can come in
[1:20:09] boldly you can come in with expectation
[1:20:12] you don't have to be cringing and
[1:20:14] looking around and is he going to kill
[1:20:15] me come in because he's invited you in
[1:20:18] when Christ died that day of Calvary he
[1:20:21] tore the veil to say what it's open it's
[1:20:26] open you don't have to go through a man
[1:20:28] you don't have to go through a Ministry
[1:20:30] Christ has opened the way through his
[1:20:32] sacrifice
[1:20:34] amen he says enter into the holiest by
[1:20:37] the blood of Jesus but what does that
[1:20:39] look like he says by a New and Living
[1:20:43] Way which he hath consecrated for us
[1:20:47] through the veil that is to say his
[1:20:49] flesh so Paul's saying there's a new way
[1:20:51] of living and you've never lived this
[1:20:53] way before Jews amen you've never done
[1:20:56] this before he says you might have lived
[1:20:58] good by the law but this is not legalism
[1:21:00] now but this is a new way it's a living
[1:21:03] way and it's not your life now but it's
[1:21:06] another life inside of you that's going
[1:21:08] to produce this what is it it's the Holy
[1:21:11] Spirit the witness inside of us that we
[1:21:13] passed from Death unto life that's our
[1:21:15] witness that's our token that's our
[1:21:18] assurance that we passed from death into
[1:21:20] life and we can come into the presence
[1:21:22] of God freely and with boldness amen
[1:21:25] that's our Assurance of life is that we
[1:21:27] have the Holy Spirit living inside of us
[1:21:29] Paul says in Galatians he says I'm
[1:21:31] crucified with Christ he says I died
[1:21:32] just like he did now did Paul die just
[1:21:35] like Jesus
[1:21:36] did
[1:21:38] no Paul's speaking here he's still alive
[1:21:42] but he's saying I've Crucified My Flesh
[1:21:44] I've crucified my mind I've crucified
[1:21:46] everything he's also saying that I was
[1:21:48] in him when he
[1:21:51] died I was in him
[1:21:55] but then he says this nevertheless I
[1:21:58] live there's a New and Living Way yet
[1:22:01] not I but Christ liveth in me and the
[1:22:05] life which I now live where in the flesh
[1:22:09] I live by the faith of the Son of God
[1:22:11] who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:22:14] it's a New and Living Way and he says
[1:22:16] it's by Christ Living In Me by the Holy
[1:22:18] Spirit brother Bram says this he says
[1:22:20] God is your joy God is your strength he
[1:22:24] he says knowing the message knowing the
[1:22:26] truth that's our sufficiency now he is
[1:22:29] my all sufficiency in him all things I
[1:22:32] have need of are in him that's our
[1:22:35] strength My Help Cometh From The Lord he
[1:22:38] says you Christians Look to Him for your
[1:22:40] joy Look to Him for your strength Look
[1:22:43] to Him for your happiness he is my peace
[1:22:45] he is my joy he is my love he is my life
[1:22:48] he says that's a covenant the token upon
[1:22:52] the door amen so when you receive the
[1:22:54] Holy Spirit into your soul it's not just
[1:22:57] an experience in a church service amen
[1:22:59] it's not just a confession of your heart
[1:23:01] and your mouth amen but when it's a true
[1:23:03] dying out of self and Christ is living
[1:23:06] inside of you that's the greatest event
[1:23:09] you will have in this flesh until you
[1:23:11] get a body change because it's deity
[1:23:14] what condescending to live in flesh
[1:23:18] again amen it's the greatest thing
[1:23:21] because you passed now from death into
[1:23:23] life oh this breath can go out of this
[1:23:25] body but you just go directly into what
[1:23:28] a glorified one a Celestial one first
[1:23:31] and then you'll come back in the
[1:23:31] resurrection you'll pick up this Earthly
[1:23:33] body and it'll be glorified amen now you
[1:23:35] have access to the tree of life now you
[1:23:38] have access to the full word of God now
[1:23:40] you have access to the presence of God
[1:23:42] the person of God if we could put it
[1:23:43] that way and what does it do Paul says
[1:23:45] it changes your
[1:23:47] approach because now we have boldness
[1:23:50] instead of
[1:23:52] fear now we have confidence
[1:23:55] and Assurance instead of worry and doubt
[1:23:59] that's what the Holy Ghost does for us
[1:24:00] amen it changes our attitude because not
[1:24:03] only has he forgiven you but now you
[1:24:05] have an assurance that what you're a
[1:24:07] part of him that you always were a part
[1:24:09] of him and that he's bringing you back
[1:24:11] to him amen it's all wrapped up in one
[1:24:14] big thing but watch how Paul finishes
[1:24:16] this portion in Hebrews we're speaking
[1:24:18] on our Assurance this morning and let's
[1:24:20] see what Paul says that we should have
[1:24:22] he says in having an high priest over
[1:24:24] the house of God let us do what draw
[1:24:29] near with a True Heart in full Assurance
[1:24:34] of Faith he says having our hearts
[1:24:37] sprinkled from an evil conscience and
[1:24:39] our bodies washed with pure water and I
[1:24:41] want to break that down a bit this
[1:24:42] morning he says draw near he's saying
[1:24:44] don't hold back don't let anything hold
[1:24:47] you back from the presence of God used
[1:24:50] to be it was death to go in now the
[1:24:53] spirit of God is driving you back to it
[1:24:55] so don't push
[1:24:57] back don't hold back don't let this hold
[1:25:01] you back from that don't let this hold
[1:25:04] you back from that and we'll address how
[1:25:06] he does that in in a little bit but he
[1:25:08] says get close to God Access is made
[1:25:10] available this is where life is get
[1:25:12] close to God don't pull
[1:25:15] back but watch the qualifier here Paul
[1:25:19] doesn't say everyone should approach him
[1:25:22] confidently he says draw draw near with
[1:25:25] a True
[1:25:26] Heart amen I'm telling you I've seen an
[1:25:29] awful lot of people speaking confidently
[1:25:31] about what God supposedly telling them
[1:25:33] and giving them and they're 100%
[1:25:36] contrary to the word of
[1:25:39] God I sharing some things recently with
[1:25:41] some some folks at our home and we're
[1:25:43] seeing the twisting of scriptures to
[1:25:45] massive proportions to where they are
[1:25:48] calling what the scripture says is good
[1:25:50] as evil and what the scripture says is
[1:25:52] evil is good it's happened we're already
[1:25:55] here been here for a long time amen but
[1:25:58] people are trying to get others to
[1:25:59] believe their Ministry to accept their
[1:26:02] gift and in that give them their
[1:26:04] power give them their money give them
[1:26:07] their rights and all it's doing is
[1:26:09] building up the kingdom of a man or a
[1:26:12] woman as the case may be but Paul says
[1:26:15] you got to come into His presence with a
[1:26:16] true heart I look that up and it's
[1:26:19] beautiful it says a true heart is that
[1:26:21] which has not only the name and
[1:26:24] resemblance he says but it's the real
[1:26:27] nature corresponding to the name in
[1:26:31] every respect corresponding to the idea
[1:26:34] signified by the name it's true and
[1:26:36] genuine now that's kind of fancy words
[1:26:38] what's he saying he's saying you've got
[1:26:39] to come in to the presence of God with
[1:26:43] the nature of God a lot of people call
[1:26:45] themselves Christians this morning but
[1:26:47] he says you can't come in because you
[1:26:49] have the name you have to come in
[1:26:50] because you have the nature and there's
[1:26:52] only one way you get that nature it's by
[1:26:54] the indwelling presence of the holy
[1:26:56] spirit
[1:26:57] amen you have to have the nature of God
[1:27:00] to come into His presence Paul's saying
[1:27:02] when you have the Holy Spirit you can
[1:27:04] come into God's presence because you're
[1:27:05] coming in as he
[1:27:08] is amen so how do we approach it he says
[1:27:12] with full Assurance of Faith amen why
[1:27:17] because if he's changed our life he's
[1:27:20] changed our attitude he's changed our
[1:27:22] desires he's changed our Focus Focus
[1:27:24] he's changed our
[1:27:26] approach he's changed everything so why
[1:27:29] would we not expect him to keep
[1:27:32] changing why would he we expect him to
[1:27:34] not keep
[1:27:35] working to keep producing himself in our
[1:27:38] lives to keep us growing and maturing of
[1:27:40] meeting our needs in these different
[1:27:42] things
[1:27:43] amen that's what he does and then he
[1:27:45] says in verse 23 let us hold fast the
[1:27:48] profession of our faith without wavering
[1:27:50] you go into his presence and you get
[1:27:52] Faith
[1:27:54] and more faith and more faith and Paul
[1:27:57] says when you go
[1:27:59] out keep saying what you said in there
[1:28:02] keep saying what you said in there in
[1:28:04] church we have all Faith don't we in
[1:28:06] special meetings we have all Faith but
[1:28:09] he says now you've got to keep you got
[1:28:11] to keep that Faith now when you walk out
[1:28:13] you got to keep that profession that
[1:28:15] confession upon your lips let your mouth
[1:28:18] keep saying what your experience was and
[1:28:21] it'll produce the word again in your
[1:28:22] life
[1:28:25] but what is what is the reason that we
[1:28:27] can have
[1:28:29] faith he says for he is faithful that
[1:28:34] promised he didn't say I was faithful he
[1:28:38] said he was
[1:28:39] faithful that's my rest I'm up and down
[1:28:42] church and maybe the ups and downs are
[1:28:44] getting a little flatter by God's grace
[1:28:46] but I'm still up and down and sometimes
[1:28:49] I feel like I'm a little bit in and out
[1:28:51] but that's not my rest my rest that Paul
[1:28:53] said is that he is faithful that
[1:28:56] promised that's my rest this morning
[1:28:59] amen what is our Assurance we have the
[1:29:01] spirit of God in us as a witness that
[1:29:03] we're a part of him but what does that
[1:29:05] Holy Spirit do it points us back to the
[1:29:09] promises of God it points us back to the
[1:29:11] word of God not some ISM not some f not
[1:29:14] some fancy idea not some uh you know uh
[1:29:18] Prosperity Doctrine it points us back to
[1:29:20] the richness of the true word of God and
[1:29:23] says he promise you can rest your life
[1:29:25] on it you can rest your soul on it you
[1:29:27] can rest your finances on it you can
[1:29:29] rest your family on it you can rest your
[1:29:30] job on it you can rest your education on
[1:29:33] it you can rest your very being on that
[1:29:35] because he's promised who faithful Paul
[1:29:38] saying stick with it stick with it don't
[1:29:41] back away don't let circumstances push
[1:29:44] you back raise a standard of the word
[1:29:46] and say you promised you promised and
[1:29:49] I'm staying here until you give me what
[1:29:52] you promised
[1:29:54] That's The believer's Stance you said it
[1:29:57] I believe it and I'm not going to move
[1:29:59] by God's
[1:30:00] grace having done all to stand
[1:30:04] stand we've done so much work Paul says
[1:30:08] ye did run
[1:30:09] well what hindered you don't let it push
[1:30:13] you
[1:30:15] back we work so hard to grow in Christ
[1:30:19] don't let Satan knock us back with
[1:30:21] circumstances just proves that he sees
[1:30:24] the work that's going on
[1:30:27] Amen but we come into His presence under
[1:30:30] those conditions with a True Heart a
[1:30:32] changed life a changed nature and that
[1:30:34] gives us confidence that he'll receive
[1:30:36] us and then what does the spirit do it
[1:30:38] always points us to the word of God
[1:30:41] Scripture says he'll lead you into all
[1:30:43] truth that's what the spirit of God does
[1:30:45] it leads you into all truth and it's a
[1:30:48] changing truth amen because we read in
[1:30:50] last in our last service that God cannot
[1:30:52] lie he's not a man that he should
[1:30:56] lie and so I can sit there and I can
[1:30:59] sayl I'm trusting you don't
[1:31:01] lie that's it every single day amen our
[1:31:04] rest is that he promised it and
[1:31:06] therefore he will do it so we see then
[1:31:09] from this that the purpose of the holy
[1:31:11] spirit is to draw us into the presence
[1:31:14] of God to open the word to our
[1:31:18] lives so that I can produce the word
[1:31:21] that's what he's trying to do get us
[1:31:23] into his presence so we can read the
[1:31:24] word of God the promises of God and then
[1:31:26] bring our life into alignment with it
[1:31:28] amen remember what he said in Ezekiel he
[1:31:30] said I will cause you to walk in my
[1:31:32] statutes I'll cause you to live by my
[1:31:35] word amen and that's what the holy
[1:31:38] spirit's doing in our lives amen so
[1:31:40] we'll be living by the word whether
[1:31:41] we're in training whether we're in
[1:31:43] testing whether we're in persecution
[1:31:45] whether we're in character development
[1:31:46] but also whether we're in healing
[1:31:48] Deliverance leadership provision all
[1:31:50] those things it's all the word of God
[1:31:52] producing our life amen because it's not
[1:31:54] just causing us to change but it's
[1:31:56] leading us into the realities of the
[1:31:58] word of God every single day that's what
[1:32:00] the holy spirit's trying to do amen
[1:32:02] everything we have need of is found in
[1:32:04] Christ the word amen it's all through
[1:32:06] him it didn't start at Calvary amen The
[1:32:09] Book of Revelation says that it was the
[1:32:10] lamb slain before the foundation of the
[1:32:12] world God knew what was going to happen
[1:32:15] God had a plan God had a remedy God had
[1:32:17] a solution prepared before we ever
[1:32:19] needed it
[1:32:22] amen so God knew everything from start
[1:32:24] to finish and he made a plan to get us
[1:32:26] back to him but that Redemption plan
[1:32:28] wasn't put into effect until Christ came
[1:32:31] everything was in a holding pattern up
[1:32:33] till then but I want you to see
[1:32:35] something here before we go too far as
[1:32:37] we go into the last third of this
[1:32:39] service
[1:32:40] perhaps Christ came and he shed his
[1:32:43] blood and we claim that blood don't we
[1:32:46] we claim that blood we claim that blood
[1:32:48] for different things it's for
[1:32:49] forgiveness of sins for instance but the
[1:32:51] blood is not the complete answer answer
[1:32:54] it's not just the blood see the blood of
[1:32:57] Christ opens up the way for this
[1:32:59] Covenant but the blood is not the
[1:33:01] Covenant it's the blood of the Covenant
[1:33:03] but it's not the Covenant amen the blood
[1:33:06] of Jesus shows us that the price was
[1:33:08] paid but that's what starts or initiates
[1:33:10] the New Covenant it's the door it's the
[1:33:12] access to the New Covenant but remember
[1:33:14] what a covenant is a covenant is a
[1:33:17] promise or an agreement
[1:33:20] amen we'd say today it's a contract
[1:33:22] that's a the modern word be a contract
[1:33:24] it's a it's a it's a it's a promise to
[1:33:26] do something or to exchange something
[1:33:29] and it's an illegal document if you sign
[1:33:30] a contract then it's enforceable they
[1:33:33] can take you to court and they can force
[1:33:35] you to do what you said you were going
[1:33:37] to do that and God's covenant to us was
[1:33:39] not that he would shed his blood
[1:33:42] only God's covenant to us according to
[1:33:45] Ezekiel 36 was that he'd change us the
[1:33:48] Covenant is that he'd change us amen the
[1:33:50] mechanism is the blood the blood is the
[1:33:53] way to do it everything comes through
[1:33:55] the blood amen God was trying to get us
[1:33:56] to a place where we could live uh a life
[1:33:59] that was pleasing to him so I want to
[1:34:01] read this in Ezekiel 36 so we can see
[1:34:03] what the Covenant is he says then will I
[1:34:05] sprinkle clean water upon you and ye
[1:34:07] shall be clean from all your filthiness
[1:34:09] and from all your Idols will I cleanse
[1:34:11] you that's justification that's removal
[1:34:13] of your sins and that's what the blood
[1:34:15] does the blood is a cleansing effect
[1:34:17] amen then he says a new heart also will
[1:34:20] I give you and a new spirit will I put
[1:34:22] within you and I will take take away the
[1:34:24] Stony heart out of your flesh and I will
[1:34:26] give you a heart of Flesh this is
[1:34:27] sanctification it's a changing of your
[1:34:29] desires and it's giving you a nature
[1:34:31] that can get along with God Amen it's a
[1:34:33] nature that's teachable that's trainable
[1:34:35] it's not stubborn it's not pushy it's a
[1:34:38] life-changing experience but it's not
[1:34:39] life
[1:34:40] itself amen you want to get to this
[1:34:43] point but this is not the end of the
[1:34:45] contract this is not the end of the
[1:34:47] Covenant the end of the Covenant is
[1:34:49] verse 27 he says and I will put my
[1:34:52] spirit within you you and cause you to
[1:34:55] walk in my statutes and you shall keep
[1:34:57] my judgments and do them everything
[1:34:59] verse 25 and 26 is to get you to verse
[1:35:02] 27 that's the Covenant the Covenant is
[1:35:05] I'll put my spirit within you Amen to be
[1:35:08] filled with the spirit of God to be led
[1:35:10] by the spirit of God and to be put into
[1:35:12] action by the spirit of God to live
[1:35:15] according to the word of God and unless
[1:35:17] you get to verse 27 you have not
[1:35:20] received the
[1:35:22] Covenant you're on the away but you're
[1:35:25] living under your
[1:35:26] privileges that's God's covenant that's
[1:35:28] God's full Covenant he'll take away your
[1:35:30] sins he'll change your nature and then
[1:35:33] he'll put himself in that's the full
[1:35:35] contract that's Clause 1 2 and
[1:35:37] three you'll see
[1:35:41] here he didn't say I'm going to give you
[1:35:43] the blood he said I'm going to give you
[1:35:45] my spirit how does he give us the spirit
[1:35:48] through the blood the blood's the
[1:35:50] mechanism it's it's the Catalyst it's
[1:35:52] the thing that starts this whole thing
[1:35:54] amen but God's covenant is that he would
[1:35:56] change you and so this morning we have a
[1:35:58] right by contract if we are children of
[1:36:01] God to go to God and say God I need you
[1:36:03] you know we sang that song fill my cup
[1:36:05] Lord what are we saying we're saying God
[1:36:08] I need more of you and we can do that by
[1:36:10] contract he promised to put his Spirit
[1:36:14] within us so the only thing that's
[1:36:16] holding him back is
[1:36:18] who this guy that's the only thing
[1:36:21] holding him back as much as I open he'll
[1:36:24] fill as much as I let him empty out
[1:36:27] he'll fill with his spirit amen as much
[1:36:29] as I let him work in my life that's how
[1:36:31] much he'll
[1:36:34] work God didn't say I'll give you my
[1:36:37] blood God said I'll give you my spirit
[1:36:38] but the blood is what brought us
[1:36:41] that amen he shed his blood and the life
[1:36:44] of that blood is what comes back on us
[1:36:46] if he didn't shed the blood we can't get
[1:36:48] the life from it amen he had to shed
[1:36:50] that amen he didn't promise US blood
[1:36:52] alone but he promised us life and more
[1:36:54] abundantly Christ said amen life and
[1:36:56] more abundantly and so that God said we
[1:36:58] come from a law
[1:37:00] way to a living way a living way and
[1:37:04] that's by the spirit amen it's by the
[1:37:07] spirit and we'd be changed from the
[1:37:08] inside light inside out our our covenant
[1:37:11] is for new
[1:37:12] life a living way eternal life not just
[1:37:15] a sin cuffing amen now in the book of
[1:37:18] Exodus God made a promise he made a a
[1:37:20] covenant a contract to the Israelites
[1:37:22] and he says if you put put the blood of
[1:37:24] the Lamb on the doorpost death can't
[1:37:26] touch you and God gave them a way to
[1:37:27] bypass judgment but remember what Paul
[1:37:29] said it's just a type it's just a shadow
[1:37:31] it's just pointing to something amen and
[1:37:34] God ordained all sorts of sacrifices and
[1:37:36] God ordained all sorts of blood
[1:37:37] offerings for things that they dealt
[1:37:39] with if they had committed sin if they
[1:37:40] were unclean if they were sick if they
[1:37:42] had touched a h a dead person's body if
[1:37:46] they had come in contact with a gentile
[1:37:47] all these things all these little issues
[1:37:50] with
[1:37:51] life God had a sacrifice for it
[1:37:54] but when Christ died at Calvary that
[1:37:56] contract was fulfilled and now you
[1:37:57] didn't have to do that amen now there's
[1:37:59] a new covenant a new contract between
[1:38:01] man and God and it's completely by grace
[1:38:04] and now it's a contract that brings you
[1:38:05] into a new spirit a new birth a new
[1:38:10] creation that's what's God's promised
[1:38:12] here amen as we read in Ezekiel and he's
[1:38:14] going to do it the way he did the first
[1:38:16] one by
[1:38:17] Blood by Blood amen the blood is the
[1:38:20] thing that signs the contract it's the
[1:38:23] one that puts the contract into action
[1:38:25] it's the one it's the stamp of approval
[1:38:27] of God's contract is the blood that was
[1:38:29] shed God said when I see that blood I'll
[1:38:32] pass over you
[1:38:34] amen we would say today that the blood
[1:38:37] is the payment it's what ratifies it
[1:38:41] it's the one that signs off on that
[1:38:43] contract it's a part of it but it signs
[1:38:46] it off and in Hebrews
[1:38:48] 13 this is our opening scripture as we
[1:38:50] start to close he says now the God of
[1:38:52] Peace that brought again from the dead
[1:38:54] our lord Jesus that great Shepherd of
[1:38:56] the sheep through the blood of the
[1:38:58] Everlasting Covenant it's a part of it
[1:39:01] but it's not it it's a part of it it's
[1:39:03] not everything the blood's the mechanism
[1:39:05] for what God's trying to do and what is
[1:39:07] that Covenant going to do church it's
[1:39:09] going to make you perfect in every good
[1:39:13] work to do his will what did E Ezekiel
[1:39:15] say to cause you to walk in my statutes
[1:39:20] this Covenant is going to bring you into
[1:39:21] alignment with the word of God and what
[1:39:23] does it say it's doing it's working in
[1:39:26] you the Covenant is working in you that
[1:39:28] which is well pleasing in his sight
[1:39:31] through Christ Jesus to whom be glory
[1:39:33] forever and ever this Covenant is
[1:39:36] producing The Life of Christ back in us
[1:39:39] again making us what acceptable and
[1:39:41] pleasing before God I'm going to wrap it
[1:39:44] up with a rather long series of quotes
[1:39:45] this morning from the message a token he
[1:39:47] says now in Hebrews 13:20 it's called
[1:39:49] the Everlasting Covenant he says why
[1:39:52] wasn't it called Eternal Covenant
[1:39:54] because that it wouldn't be eternity
[1:39:56] when we're redeemed it's all over then
[1:39:58] it's Everlasting which means it's for a
[1:40:00] certain amount of time till time is out
[1:40:02] there'll never be another one when time
[1:40:04] runs out we won't need any Covenant but
[1:40:06] until the time runs out we need the
[1:40:08] Covenant he says God's bloodbound
[1:40:11] promise promise makes us free from sin
[1:40:14] amen there's no sin in him sin sell for
[1:40:16] flesh worship him and show forth his
[1:40:19] promised power God's bloodbound token
[1:40:22] bound Covenant people have the spirit of
[1:40:24] Jesus Christ in here that he that
[1:40:26] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:40:28] shall he do also he's saying what
[1:40:31] displaying the Covenant see the New
[1:40:33] Testament means the New Covenant the Old
[1:40:36] Testament was the old under the lamb
[1:40:38] that the life could not come back on the
[1:40:40] believer the life of a natural lamb
[1:40:42] couldn't come back on us he says the New
[1:40:44] Testament was the Lamb of God and his
[1:40:46] life comes back on us it's the blood's
[1:40:49] life blood is life in the New Testament
[1:40:51] see the life is from the blood of the
[1:40:54] Lamb which means the New Testament the
[1:40:56] New Covenant the life is it but it's
[1:40:59] through the blood he says that God said
[1:41:02] after those days will I write my laws
[1:41:04] upon the fleshly tables of their hearts
[1:41:06] see not upon the Stony tables with the
[1:41:08] Lamb's blood which you had to say yeah I
[1:41:11] got the blood over here now what does it
[1:41:13] say to do he says he's saying that under
[1:41:16] that he says under the blood of the
[1:41:17] natural lamb you'd accept that and then
[1:41:19] you'd say well what am I supposed to do
[1:41:20] now and it was la la la la law he says
[1:41:24] but now it's upon the tables of your
[1:41:26] heart see the spirit Covenant will I
[1:41:29] make with the people see the blood what
[1:41:32] it released the spirit it released the
[1:41:34] life out of it and that brings us into a
[1:41:36] living way not just a covering but it's
[1:41:39] a living way he says and it displays his
[1:41:43] power John 14:12 says he that believeth
[1:41:46] on me the works that I do shall he do
[1:41:48] also Christ said lo I come to fulfill
[1:41:50] what's written of me in the book in the
[1:41:53] the word of God that's the same thing
[1:41:54] we're going to do he says and the same
[1:41:56] thing we are doing he says New Testament
[1:41:58] is New Covenant New Life shows that
[1:42:00] Jesus has met every requirement for us
[1:42:03] that God required to make us back truly
[1:42:06] Sons and Daughters of God under the
[1:42:08] blood where there is no more
[1:42:10] condemnation he says Romans 8:1 says
[1:42:13] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:42:14] to them that are in not those who are
[1:42:17] believing it but those who are in Christ
[1:42:20] Jesus that walk not after the flesh but
[1:42:22] after the SP spirit and he says and my
[1:42:24] word is spirit and life you can't say
[1:42:27] you're walking according to the Holy
[1:42:29] Spirit and be living contrary to the
[1:42:30] word of God that's what he means he says
[1:42:33] there's no more condemnation we're free
[1:42:35] from sin we're free from the cares of
[1:42:37] the world no condemnation he says why to
[1:42:40] them that have been by one Spirit
[1:42:42] baptized into one body there the blood
[1:42:45] of the Lamb has been applied the god of
[1:42:48] Heaven has accepted you his life is in
[1:42:50] you and you are sons and daughters of
[1:42:53] God he says your character is God's
[1:42:56] character he says what is that a little
[1:42:58] pushover no sir God's a god of judgment
[1:43:01] he's a god of correctness it must be on
[1:43:04] the line it must be in line with the
[1:43:05] word nothing else will do that's the
[1:43:08] kind of character you are because you're
[1:43:10] the character of your
[1:43:12] father now watch remember what Paul says
[1:43:15] you got to come in with a true heart he
[1:43:17] says the life now watch when the life is
[1:43:19] taken for the blood see the life itself
[1:43:22] is taken the blood was applied and the
[1:43:24] life could not come on the believer then
[1:43:26] for the life of an animal but see
[1:43:28] instead of a human being he's speaking
[1:43:30] of Christ it was a super super super
[1:43:32] human being see and that makes the human
[1:43:35] now not only a human being but he's a
[1:43:38] son and daughter of God of the super
[1:43:40] super super super life that was in him
[1:43:43] it comes back upon you and changes you
[1:43:46] from a sinner and the things of the
[1:43:48] world a church member see where we can't
[1:43:51] rely on the fact that we go go to
[1:43:54] church amen church membership isn't how
[1:43:57] we get into heaven it's not it has
[1:43:59] nothing to do with it he says it gets
[1:44:02] you it changes you from a church member
[1:44:04] and a denominational goer to a born
[1:44:07] again Christian filled with the spirit
[1:44:09] and he says what does this look like
[1:44:11] it's the life of God just flowing from
[1:44:13] you like Sparks from an anvil what's an
[1:44:17] anvil an anvil is a big piece of metal
[1:44:19] that a blacksmith uses to shape metal
[1:44:24] and what do you do with metal to shape
[1:44:25] it you beat it you pound it you heat it
[1:44:30] up and what happens is as you're
[1:44:32] striking that metal with your Hammer he
[1:44:34] says it's the sparks flying what is it
[1:44:37] it's Christ in you producing himself and
[1:44:40] it's a constant work it's a constant
[1:44:42] work and there's pressure with it and
[1:44:44] there's there's trials and there's tests
[1:44:46] and there's all these different things
[1:44:48] he says but it's like Sparks from an
[1:44:49] anvil as you walk full of virtue and
[1:44:52] love and gentleness and as the holy
[1:44:55] spirit's moving and speaking oh my there
[1:44:57] you are he says and with hearing the
[1:44:59] message watching the pillar of fire and
[1:45:02] the Blessed assurance that I've passed
[1:45:05] from Death unto life he says note
[1:45:08] therefore there's no condemnation at all
[1:45:12] but he says if our hearts condemn us not
[1:45:14] then we can have our petition he's
[1:45:16] quoting scripture he says see we know
[1:45:18] but if sin is in our heart then it
[1:45:20] condemns us we might as well not not
[1:45:23] even
[1:45:24] start you can't go into God's presence
[1:45:27] and ask for something if you've got
[1:45:28] condemnation in your heart if your
[1:45:30] conscience is bothering you you can't do
[1:45:32] it because what doubt will be there you
[1:45:35] don't know where you're standing you
[1:45:36] don't have Assurance but remember what
[1:45:38] he says he says if our hearts don't
[1:45:40] condemn us then we know that he hears us
[1:45:42] and we can have what he says but then
[1:45:44] Paul says but if our hearts condemn us
[1:45:48] if we go into his presence and there's
[1:45:50] something hanging over us Paul didn't
[1:45:52] say you got to get out he said God is
[1:45:55] greater God is greater than our
[1:45:58] condemnation and he knows all things in
[1:46:01] other words God can get you through it
[1:46:03] God can clear your conscience God can
[1:46:05] take that thing that's hanging over you
[1:46:07] away so that you can come in with full
[1:46:10] confidence listen we've got a conscience
[1:46:12] for a reason but the answer to the
[1:46:14] conscience is always what repentance and
[1:46:18] if you repent and put it under the blood
[1:46:19] now you can come in with full confidence
[1:46:23] in other words God will get you past
[1:46:25] whatever you need to get past amen
[1:46:27] through forgiveness if needed and a
[1:46:29] cleansing of your conscience he says
[1:46:31] you've got to get free from sin and the
[1:46:34] only way you can get free from sin is
[1:46:36] get in him that's the only covering
[1:46:38] there is for sin is Christ because
[1:46:41] remember you can be justified you can
[1:46:42] accept the blood of Calvary that pays
[1:46:44] for your sin but your nature hasn't yet
[1:46:47] changed and so you can't get away from
[1:46:48] your
[1:46:49] conscience you got to deal with the
[1:46:51] conscience and that's only by a New
[1:46:53] Birth by the Holy Spirit you got to get
[1:46:56] in Christ and there's only one way he
[1:46:57] says remember the Covenant blood is not
[1:46:59] recognized without the token you cannot
[1:47:02] you will not you say well I've been
[1:47:03] Sanctified from things he says that's
[1:47:05] not the token he says it's the spirit is
[1:47:08] the token the spirit of Christ upon you
[1:47:10] he says believe it now look he says the
[1:47:13] word assures us of the promise remember
[1:47:16] what we read where he says he is
[1:47:18] faithful who promised it he says now
[1:47:20] look the word assures us of the promise
[1:47:23] the word assures us of the promise
[1:47:25] because it the Holy Spirit that's the
[1:47:28] living word amen my words are spirit and
[1:47:30] life because it is the promise the word
[1:47:33] is the promise the word is God and the
[1:47:36] word is ours and we become the word and
[1:47:39] the word becomes us if you abide in me
[1:47:41] and my word is in you then see it just
[1:47:44] becomes one great big family see it
[1:47:48] assures us because why he says well it's
[1:47:52] part of us
[1:47:53] see it becomes part of us and it assures
[1:47:56] us the
[1:48:00] promise he says the token is the sign
[1:48:03] that the purchase has been made and it's
[1:48:05] been accepted he says now you can't get
[1:48:08] the token from the railroad Fair until
[1:48:10] you pay the price and the only way
[1:48:12] you're going to pay the price is pay it
[1:48:16] there's no other way to pay something
[1:48:17] except to pay it he says that's right
[1:48:19] and what he says what's the price you've
[1:48:22] got to pay what's the price that I've
[1:48:23] got to pay he says our payment is to
[1:48:26] believe it accept it full obedience to
[1:48:30] the whole word of God will entitle you
[1:48:33] to the Token full obedience to the word
[1:48:36] of God will get you the Holy Spirit
[1:48:39] that's what he's saying full obedience
[1:48:41] not the part of it as far as your
[1:48:43] denomination goes but all of it full
[1:48:46] obedience to the word which is Christ
[1:48:48] brings you into Christ now listen to
[1:48:51] what he says here now what if you just
[1:48:53] all in but your feet are hanging out he
[1:48:56] says most of us are all most all of us
[1:48:59] in but the heart is hanging out see the
[1:49:01] hearts in the world yet but we don't do
[1:49:04] that he says full complete obedience
[1:49:07] puts you and the word as one he says you
[1:49:11] believe it every bit and all of it's in
[1:49:14] you and you watch it working through you
[1:49:17] see the holy spirit is not something
[1:49:19] that I control it's something that
[1:49:21] controls me
[1:49:23] I'm not trying to create I'm not trying
[1:49:25] to produce I'm not trying to make things
[1:49:28] happen he says you watch it working
[1:49:30] through you I've got to get myself out
[1:49:32] of the way and let God have
[1:49:35] control that's my rest is that he's got
[1:49:38] it all in control and I'm not trying to
[1:49:39] force it amen I'm not trying to make
[1:49:42] things happen it's all him he says you
[1:49:44] don't go around with a bunch of carrying
[1:49:46] on see you're a Christian no matter what
[1:49:48] anybody says they'll never touch you
[1:49:50] you're in Christ you're as safe as can
[1:49:52] be When Death knocks at the door it has
[1:49:54] no hold see not at all why it's just
[1:49:57] stepping out of here into there age
[1:50:00] means not a thing you've passed from age
[1:50:02] you're in eternity because you're in him
[1:50:04] and he is eternal that's why we don't
[1:50:07] worry if we're going to die that's why
[1:50:09] we don't worry as we see ourselves
[1:50:11] getting older and grayer and things
[1:50:13] starting to
[1:50:14] slip that's why brother brother brother
[1:50:17] Jim du is not worried about heart
[1:50:19] attacks this morning he's passed from
[1:50:21] Death unto life anden he knows that if
[1:50:24] he passes from here he's got a greater
[1:50:25] thing waiting for him over there and
[1:50:27] then it's going to bring him back here
[1:50:29] that same Spirit it'll lift him up into
[1:50:30] the presence of God that's our rest this
[1:50:33] morning he says it doesn't mean a thing
[1:50:37] whether you're young old middle AG or
[1:50:40] whatever you are okay that's all of us
[1:50:42] pretty ugly short fat what it doesn't
[1:50:47] matter a thing praise the Lord amen you
[1:50:50] don't go around he says it doesn't you
[1:50:53] don't go around and all these other
[1:50:55] things you have passed from that you're
[1:50:57] dead your life is hidden in God through
[1:51:00] Christ you're sealed in there by the
[1:51:01] holy ghost walking in Christ the only
[1:51:04] object you see is Christ that's
[1:51:09] all he's not looking at
[1:51:12] me why should I be looking at me let
[1:51:15] your word be born in me look at him
[1:51:19] Church everything we have need of is in
[1:51:20] Christ the word I'm going to close with
[1:51:23] a scripture and one small
[1:51:24] quote I took this from Hebrews 6 and I
[1:51:27] read this in my devotions the other
[1:51:28] morning that just jumped out of me and I
[1:51:30] I loved what the Amplified says and it's
[1:51:32] a bit wordy but I want you to just
[1:51:34] listen to this this morning as we close
[1:51:35] out it says accordingly God also in his
[1:51:39] desire to show more convincingly and
[1:51:42] Beyond doubt to those who were to
[1:51:45] inherit the promise the unchangeableness
[1:51:47] of his purpose and
[1:51:50] plan he's trying to convince us he's got
[1:51:52] this all in control he's trying to
[1:51:54] convince us it's all going to plan that
[1:51:56] he's got a purpose in all of this he
[1:51:58] said he intervened with an oath and this
[1:52:02] was so that by two unchangeable things
[1:52:05] his promise and his oath see for men we
[1:52:09] need to say it and then we need to swear
[1:52:12] it and he would say in those days that's
[1:52:15] how they confirmed it is they would give
[1:52:17] a promise and then they confirm an oath
[1:52:18] and they'd say you know let me be as
[1:52:20] this animal we've sacrificed if I don't
[1:52:22] do my part and that's the thing that
[1:52:24] satisfies men is not just when we give a
[1:52:27] promise but when we give an oath to back
[1:52:28] it
[1:52:29] up and God said this is the only way
[1:52:31] they're going to accept it is if I do it
[1:52:33] the way they do it so he says I am going
[1:52:34] to do it I'll give them my promise which
[1:52:36] I'm going to do no matter what but then
[1:52:38] I swear it by an oath he says in which
[1:52:41] it is impossible for God ever to prove
[1:52:43] false or deceive us we who have fled to
[1:52:46] him for Refuge might have this great
[1:52:49] thing mighty indwelling strength and
[1:52:54] strong encouragement to grasp and hold
[1:52:57] fast The Hope appointed for us and set
[1:53:01] before
[1:53:03] us this confident Assurance we're
[1:53:06] preaching on our Assurance this morning
[1:53:08] this confident Assurance we have as an
[1:53:11] anchor of the
[1:53:13] Soul watch this description church I
[1:53:16] cried when I saw this it cannot
[1:53:20] slip and it cannot not break down under
[1:53:25] whatever pressure Bears upon it
[1:53:29] Hallelujah I'm going to read that again
[1:53:31] he says it this confidence Assurance we
[1:53:35] have as an anchor of the Soul this is
[1:53:38] the Covenant of God to you sealed by the
[1:53:41] holy spirit that it cannot
[1:53:46] slip listen we slip we fall we fail this

[1:54:06] cannot it is impossible that it can
[1:54:08] break down whatever pressure Bears upon
[1:54:12] it Hallelujah he says a safe and
[1:54:16] steadfast hope that enters the very
[1:54:19] certainty of the presence of God within
[1:54:23] the holy place that's not out there
[1:54:26] church know ye not that ye are the
[1:54:29] Temple of the Holy Ghost this steadfast

[1:54:37] on our lives that's the witness we have
[1:54:40] this morning that's the Assurance as
[1:54:42] something keeps holding me when I can't
[1:54:43] even hold
[1:54:45] myself that's what lifts me up
[1:54:48] again he never fell I fell he never
[1:54:51] failed I failed but he's standing there
[1:54:54] and he never slips and he never fails
[1:54:56] even when I do
[1:54:58] Hallelujah this confident
[1:55:01] Assurance he says prove all things the
[1:55:03] Bible
[1:55:04] said I can't make him do it but he
[1:55:08] promised to do it he says that's where I
[1:55:11] hold it he promised that he would do it
