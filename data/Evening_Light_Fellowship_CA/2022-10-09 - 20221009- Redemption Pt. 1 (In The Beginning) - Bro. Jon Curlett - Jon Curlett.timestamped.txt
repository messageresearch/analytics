[54:39] let's bow our heads
[54:43] Heavenly Father
[54:46] Lord you sent us a seventh angel with a
[54:48] message
[54:49] Gordon how many times did he tell us
[54:52] only believe
[54:53] or that if we could believe all things
[54:55] were possible Lord
[54:56] not to believe just anything Lord but if
[54:59] we could believe what you've said
[55:00] what if we believe what you promised
[55:02] Lord then it would come to pass in our
[55:04] lives and Lord we're asking for a
[55:06] greater Faith this morning Lord that we
[55:08] would step into a higher plain Lord a
[55:10] greater rest Lord a greater peace Lord a
[55:14] greater trust in you Lord that your word
[55:16] would have the the full preeminence in
[55:18] our life Lord God Lord that out of us
[55:20] will flow the very manifestation of the
[55:22] things that we read and and talk about
[55:24] Lord God but may not just stay in our
[55:26] hearts or maybe but may it come out into
[55:28] our lives we pray Lord for those around
[55:30] us to see that you are alive and well
[55:32] Lord grant us your grace this morning as
[55:34] we Minister Lord may it be you that
[55:37] speaks or may you set me aside
[55:38] completely Lord that you would touch the
[55:40] lives and hearts of the Believers here
[55:42] Lord and online Lord and anyone that
[55:44] might hear it later Lord we pray that
[55:45] your holy spirit will just reach into
[55:47] their hearts and souls Lord we pray Lord
[55:49] to give them something of Eternal value
[55:51] in Jesus Christ's name we're asking it
[55:53] [Music]
[55:55] amen God bless you thank you musicians
[55:57] man if you'll turn your scriptures to
[55:59] Exodus 15 and while you're you're
[56:01] turning there I want to do a quick
[56:02] update I spoke with Brother David Nash
[56:04] Our the missionary we've been supporting
[56:06] and he'd sent me some pictures over the
[56:08] last few days so this is him in the the
[56:11] center the the old white guy and uh on
[56:14] the left we have brother Eric and then
[56:15] on the right we have uh brother Eli and
[56:17] those are both translators that have
[56:19] worked with him while he's there and he
[56:20] told me in 19 days of travel he says
[56:23] I'll have done 18 services in one
[56:24] wedding
[56:25] so call it a service every day on
[56:28] average so certainly he's had his work
[56:30] cut out for me for him rather and he
[56:33] wanted to send some pictures of the
[56:34] services so this is one of the the
[56:36] services I believe in in the Panama area
[56:39] one of the churches he went to and then
[56:41] this is another one and if you look at
[56:42] the outside that is the outside of the
[56:44] church and then on the inside is is what
[56:46] they have so very simple it's not a
[56:48] fancy Thing by any means no air
[56:50] conditioning no no special Comforts or
[56:52] anything like that but that's where they
[56:53] preach amen that's what it means to go
[56:55] into the mission field it's certainly
[56:56] not about Comfort he sent me pictures I
[56:58] refused to put them up of his feet and
[57:00] what they look like after hiking through
[57:02] the mountains to get where they needed
[57:04] to go and he's covered in welts and
[57:06] insect bites and these different things
[57:07] from where he had to go you know so he
[57:09] says if you have any young preachers
[57:11] that have an itch to preach he says send
[57:12] them here we'll give them something to
[57:14] itch you know it's I said we want to
[57:16] encourage them Brother David not
[57:18] discourage them
[57:19] but anyways it's not it's certainly not
[57:21] a life of of ease or or pleasure High
[57:23] pay or anything but they're out there
[57:25] for the souls amen and then this is the
[57:27] the last set of services they just had
[57:28] this this last weekend in a couple
[57:31] different churches there and uh you know
[57:33] maybe 40 50 people not much different
[57:35] than what we have but uh just thankful
[57:37] that God's using them that the people
[57:38] are responding amen and that the word is
[57:40] hitting the mark amen Exodus chapter 15
[57:43] Exodus 15 and verse 9 and this is the
[57:46] song of the redeemed if you look in in
[57:48] if you've got the uh the same Bible I do
[57:51] then it says there that it's Redemption
[57:53] completed by Blood and by power and
[57:55] though this is the song of the redeemed
[57:58] amen verse 9 says the enemy said I will
[58:01] pursue
[58:02] I will overtake
[58:04] I will devoid divide the spoil my lust
[58:08] shall be satisfied upon them I will draw
[58:11] my sword my hand shall destroy them
[58:15] that it's blow with thy wind the sea
[58:17] covered them they sank as lead in The
[58:20] Mighty Waters who is like unto thee O
[58:22] Lord among the gods who is like thee
[58:25] glorious in Holiness fearful and Praises
[58:28] doing wonders thou stretched out thy
[58:31] right hand and the Earth swallowed them
[58:34] thou in thy mercy has led forth the
[58:37] people which thou Hast redeemed thou
[58:39] Hast guided them in thy strength unto
[58:42] thy holy habitation amen God bless you
[58:45] you may have your seats this morning and
[58:47] we're going to be starting a new series
[58:49] this morning and this is one that's been
[58:51] kind of waiting in the wings for for
[58:53] maybe as much as as three years and I've
[58:56] just been dwelling on things and kind of
[58:57] compiling things as I've went through
[58:59] different things and and certainly the
[59:01] ministers amongst us will know that when
[59:03] you're studying for something sometimes
[59:04] you you see something you say that's so
[59:06] good but I don't have enough to preach
[59:07] on it so you stick it over in another in
[59:09] another page in another file and you
[59:11] just you just kind of stash these things
[59:13] over there and this is what's been been
[59:14] happening on the the sermon and the the
[59:17] series that we're gonna to start here
[59:18] and of course back when this was coming
[59:20] to me
[59:21] in the beginning I didn't have the
[59:23] opportunity to minister kind of in
[59:24] consecutive Services the way I do here
[59:26] and so I feel like the Lord has really
[59:28] opened up this opportunity for me and
[59:29] and even to show me things that I've
[59:31] never seen before Amanda that's where
[59:33] you want to preach from is not just a
[59:34] place of comfort but a place of newness
[59:36] a place of Revelation to see what God is
[59:38] doing in this age amen and I want to
[59:40] start this series on Redemption amen and
[59:42] it's such a huge topic because when you
[59:44] look at it everything that that that is
[59:46] the Christian walk is tied into
[59:47] Redemption this entire book is a book of
[59:50] redemption amen it's the great plan of
[59:52] God to bring us back to what we were and
[59:54] and what he intended in the beginning
[59:56] and so everything everything can be tied
[59:58] back to Redemption it'd be almost
[1:00:00] impossible to look at this Bible and not
[1:00:02] tie what you read in some form or way
[1:00:04] back to Redemption amen and we know
[1:00:06] we're in a fallen condition and then
[1:00:08] we're nowhere in a follow condition
[1:00:09] because we know that we know there's a
[1:00:11] right and we know there's a wrong and
[1:00:13] and yet we don't always do what's right
[1:00:14] and we know that that in our souls
[1:00:16] there's something that's crying out and
[1:00:17] yet our body and even our spirit at
[1:00:19] times is fighting against it and it's
[1:00:21] resisting it's so we know we're not
[1:00:22] where we ought to be and then we know
[1:00:24] we're not in that condition we're not in
[1:00:25] the original condition we're in because
[1:00:27] we're seeking something that we don't
[1:00:29] have amen and it's not money and it's
[1:00:31] not houses and it's not vehicles and
[1:00:32] it's not careers but it's something far
[1:00:34] bigger and far greater than that and
[1:00:36] what we're doing is we're seeking back
[1:00:37] to our origin amen amen the prophet said
[1:00:40] that origin is Destiny amen and what
[1:00:42] we're doing is we're reaching we're
[1:00:43] reaching forward to that which is behind
[1:00:45] us if that makes sense Amen to what we
[1:00:47] were we're reaching forward to it
[1:00:48] because we're coming back out of time
[1:00:50] and into eternity and that's the great
[1:00:52] story of redemption in the self and so I
[1:00:54] want to start this this series on
[1:00:56] Redemption I just want to take a title
[1:00:57] this morning of in the beginning because
[1:00:59] we want to understand how God works and
[1:01:01] we want to understand the laws and the
[1:01:03] principles of God when it comes to
[1:01:05] Redemption because if we don't get that
[1:01:06] right then we'll twist what Redemption
[1:01:08] looks like and it'll turn into what we
[1:01:09] see in Parenthood and marriages and all
[1:01:11] these different things today where
[1:01:13] they've twisted up what it means to
[1:01:14] truly love what it truly means to to do
[1:01:16] what's best for somebody or something
[1:01:18] amen and we then the other thing is we
[1:01:20] want to understand how God works so that
[1:01:22] we don't get in his way amen as parents
[1:01:25] we can certainly appreciate what happens
[1:01:26] when we're trying to do something and
[1:01:28] our children come and they want to help
[1:01:30] us and then what do they do they get in
[1:01:32] the way and they just keep tripping us
[1:01:33] up and they keep knocking things over
[1:01:34] and breaking things and making it worse
[1:01:36] than the way it was before you even
[1:01:38] started amen we don't want to get in
[1:01:40] God's way because it doesn't bother God
[1:01:42] God's got all the time in the world Amen
[1:01:44] he's he's residing in eternity and and
[1:01:46] he's in no rush but the only one that
[1:01:48] hurts when we get in his way is US amen
[1:01:50] we're the ones that pay the price when
[1:01:51] we get in his way because we hold him
[1:01:53] back from doing the things that he's
[1:01:55] supposed to be doing so in doing this we
[1:01:57] certainly want to get with the program
[1:01:58] amen and I started with that General
[1:02:00] scripture in Exodus and we're going to
[1:02:02] come back to it in a future service but
[1:02:04] I I just wanted to focus on this this
[1:02:06] verse 13 here because this is really the
[1:02:08] meat of redemption right here and it
[1:02:10] says Thou in thy mercy has led forth the
[1:02:13] people which thou Hast redeemed thou has
[1:02:16] guided them in thy strength unto thy
[1:02:18] Holiness you notice there there's a lot
[1:02:20] of thousands and thighs and there's no
[1:02:21] eyes
[1:02:22] amen and that's the great story of
[1:02:24] redemption is that it's it's not about
[1:02:25] you that's doing anything it's about
[1:02:27] somebody else and it says Thou amen amen
[1:02:29] the the whole start of this is who thou
[1:02:31] who is thou it is Jehovah God it is The
[1:02:34] Great I Am it is the Lord God it's the
[1:02:36] self-existing one that's what we're
[1:02:38] talking about when it comes to
[1:02:39] Redemption here is it's not just some
[1:02:41] some person that's just a little bit
[1:02:43] bigger a little bit better a little bit
[1:02:45] gooder somebody has a little more than
[1:02:46] we do but we're talking about The Great
[1:02:48] I Am we're talking about God the Father
[1:02:50] himself amen and he says Thou and thy
[1:02:53] mercy has led forth the people which
[1:02:55] thou Hast redeemed amen I want you to
[1:02:58] catch that there is a particular people
[1:02:59] that's going to be redeemed because we
[1:03:02] look at this situation this is right
[1:03:03] after the Red Sea and there were those
[1:03:05] that were redeemed and then there was
[1:03:07] everybody else amen and what happened to
[1:03:09] everybody else in the verses preceding
[1:03:11] that is that they died amen that the
[1:03:13] works of God destroyed them that but
[1:03:15] there was a people that came through the
[1:03:16] very same situation that went through
[1:03:18] the very same Waters and it did not
[1:03:20] destroy them but it saved them so our
[1:03:22] saving is their destruction our Mercy is
[1:03:25] their judgment amen we want to be on the
[1:03:27] mercy side we want to be counted with
[1:03:29] those that are the redeemed amen and we
[1:03:31] see here that they are redeemed brother
[1:03:33] Brown talks about an exodus he says in
[1:03:35] Exodus has to bring you out and it has
[1:03:36] to bring you in and it's the same thing
[1:03:38] for Redemption as it takes you out of a
[1:03:40] condition and it brings you into a
[1:03:42] condition it takes you out of a place
[1:03:43] and it brings you back to your original
[1:03:45] place it takes you out of your out of
[1:03:47] your walking in a strange place and it
[1:03:49] brings you home is what it does
[1:03:50] redemption brings you out of something
[1:03:52] so it can bring you into something now
[1:03:55] Psalms 107 says oh give thanks unto the
[1:03:57] Lord for he is good and his mercy
[1:04:01] endureth forever amen we're looking to
[1:04:03] his goodness we're looking to his Mercy
[1:04:05] why because when ours gives up his
[1:04:07] continues when we think that we've done
[1:04:09] enough when we think that that's as far
[1:04:11] as I need to go yet his mercy and his
[1:04:13] goodness goes above and beyond that it
[1:04:15] reaches far higher and it reaches far
[1:04:16] deeper than we as humans could ever
[1:04:18] imagine and you cannot you're never
[1:04:21] warranted you're you never deserve it
[1:04:23] this is what this is all about is his
[1:04:25] goodness and his grace is far beyond
[1:04:27] anything we could say or do that would
[1:04:28] pull us away from him he says let the
[1:04:31] redeemed of the Lord say so say so what
[1:04:33] that he is good and his Mercy endures
[1:04:35] forever whom he hath redeemed from the
[1:04:38] hand of the enemy and gathered them out
[1:04:40] of the lands from the East and from the
[1:04:42] west and from the north and from the
[1:04:44] south amen so I want you to realize
[1:04:46] today that the redeemed are not gathered
[1:04:48] because they're perfect or beautiful or
[1:04:50] complete or amazing but they are
[1:04:53] redeemed because God is good and his
[1:04:55] Mercy endures forever amen this is the
[1:04:58] the very the the very Viewpoint of
[1:05:00] redemption is that it is not about the
[1:05:02] one receiving it but it is a reflection
[1:05:04] of the one that's giving it amen and
[1:05:06] that's what we'll see in this in the
[1:05:08] theme of redemption throughout this
[1:05:09] entire thing it is a process of Grace
[1:05:12] because Redemption is required for those
[1:05:15] that are unworthy for those that have
[1:05:17] wasted things for those that have
[1:05:18] spoiled things for those that are
[1:05:20] imperfect for those that have made wrong
[1:05:22] decisions for those that have gotten
[1:05:23] them into trouble for those that have
[1:05:25] ruined what God gave to them in the
[1:05:27] first place Redemption is for the
[1:05:29] imperfect amen so if you're sitting
[1:05:31] there and you're saying well I don't
[1:05:33] need Redemption then you're in a layout
[1:05:34] of seeing condition because that's what
[1:05:36] they said is I don't need anything I've
[1:05:38] got what I need and I'm good to go from
[1:05:40] where I am amen the beauty of redemption
[1:05:42] is that you can be in any condition as
[1:05:44] long as you don't believe you don't need
[1:05:46] it
[1:05:47] if you don't need it then you're never
[1:05:49] going to get redeemed but if you need it
[1:05:51] then you are a qualified person for
[1:05:53] Redemption amen if you are out from what
[1:05:56] you're supposed to be if you're away
[1:05:57] from your original position if you lack
[1:05:59] any portion of that which God has for
[1:06:01] you then you are a candidate for
[1:06:03] Redemption this morning
[1:06:06] coming back to this verse 13 it says
[1:06:08] Thou Hast guided them in thy strength
[1:06:10] amend the Redemption process is not done
[1:06:12] based on my strength not based on my
[1:06:14] discipline on my my ability to stay in
[1:06:17] line
[1:06:18] but rather it's a reflection of my
[1:06:20] inability to do it in somebody who is
[1:06:21] greater than all of those things amen
[1:06:23] that he's greater than my mistakes it is
[1:06:25] his strength that is going to perform
[1:06:26] the Redemption that we require he says
[1:06:29] he has guided them and thy strength unto
[1:06:31] thy holy habitation amen Redemption
[1:06:34] always takes you somewhere and we look
[1:06:36] at this scripture and it says that there
[1:06:37] is a holy habitation there's a place
[1:06:39] where God will dwell and that's where
[1:06:41] Redemption takes you is the place that
[1:06:43] God dwells
[1:06:44] amen it what it always Redemption always
[1:06:48] involves a relocation amen you can never
[1:06:51] stay where you are and say I'm redeemed
[1:06:53] because it means you're out you're to be
[1:06:55] redeemed you have to be outside of where
[1:06:56] you're supposed to be so it always
[1:06:58] involves a change it always involves a
[1:07:00] move it always enchant entails of
[1:07:03] relocation otherwise you're not in the
[1:07:05] Redemption process so if we're sitting
[1:07:07] here this morning and we're saying I'm
[1:07:08] in the process of redemption and nothing
[1:07:10] has changed in your life and you haven't
[1:07:12] made any movements then you're not in
[1:07:14] the process of redemption
[1:07:15] I'm not saying it's not available I'm
[1:07:17] saying you haven't been started in the
[1:07:19] process because if you're staying where
[1:07:21] you are then something's wrong because
[1:07:22] Redemption always moves you to something
[1:07:25] Psalms 132 says and this is the holy
[1:07:28] habitation it says for the Lord had
[1:07:30] chosen Zion he had desired it for his
[1:07:34] habitation this is my rest forever here
[1:07:37] will I dwell for I have desired it now
[1:07:40] this is Abraham's Royal seed promise
[1:07:42] because we're talking about Zion because
[1:07:44] remember for Abraham he said what I am
[1:07:47] thy shield and I am thy exceeding great
[1:07:49] portion amen Abraham's promise was not a
[1:07:52] land the promise of a lamb was to
[1:07:54] Abraham's seed but the promise to
[1:07:55] Abraham was I I am amen that's what
[1:07:58] we're looking for sorry Redemption is
[1:08:00] not a land that's why we're pilgrims and
[1:08:02] strangers here is because our promise is
[1:08:04] not a land that is here but our promise
[1:08:06] is a reunion with Christ with God the
[1:08:09] Father amen it is a reunion back to the
[1:08:11] Oneness that we had in the very
[1:08:12] beginning so this is Zion and Zion is
[1:08:15] always the elect the true church and
[1:08:17] today will be the bride of Christ amen
[1:08:19] but if you know anything about Zion Zion
[1:08:22] is a portion of Jerusalem did you know
[1:08:24] that Zion is the two easternmost Hills
[1:08:27] of Jerusalem so what you have is you
[1:08:29] have a big book
[1:08:33] and you have a portion in the book
[1:08:35] and the portion in the book is Zion and
[1:08:37] the big picture is Jerusalem put your
[1:08:40] spiritual caps on we're not going to go
[1:08:41] there this morning but it's saying that
[1:08:43] there's a place and we'll get into the
[1:08:45] scripture shortly there's a place called
[1:08:46] Jerusalem and that's where what God's
[1:08:49] chosen her but he says in the middle he
[1:08:51] says there's an elect
[1:08:53] and that's the ones that are in a
[1:08:54] special place and he calls it Mount Zion
[1:08:56] and then so Zion is a portion of
[1:08:58] Jerusalem now Isaiah 4 and we're
[1:09:00] teaching this morning he says in that
[1:09:02] day shall the branch of the Lord be
[1:09:04] beautiful and glorious and the fruit of
[1:09:06] the Earth shall be excellent and calmly
[1:09:08] for them that our Escape of Israel it
[1:09:11] says and it shall come to pass that he
[1:09:13] that is left in Zion
[1:09:15] left in Zion to him that overcometh to
[1:09:19] the one that's still standing when it's
[1:09:21] all said and done that's who this is for
[1:09:23] he says and he that remaineth in
[1:09:26] Jerusalem amen so there are those that
[1:09:29] stay remember what happened in when the
[1:09:31] Jews were scattered right and they left
[1:09:33] the Homeland for those that will come
[1:09:35] back that's where they're going to get
[1:09:37] the blessing amen Israel is only truly
[1:09:39] blessed when they're in the land of
[1:09:40] Israel because that is their inheritance
[1:09:42] that's their inheritance Abraham's Royal
[1:09:45] seat their inheritance is God but then
[1:09:47] you have the natural seed and their
[1:09:48] inheritance is the land of Israel so he
[1:09:51] says those that come back to Jerusalem
[1:09:53] those that will come back to the
[1:09:54] Homeland they're going to get a blessing
[1:09:56] he says they'll be called holy even
[1:09:58] everyone that is written among the
[1:10:01] living in Israel when the Lord shall
[1:10:03] have washed away the filth of the
[1:10:04] daughters of Zion Zion needs to be
[1:10:07] cleaned up the bride needs to be cleaned
[1:10:09] up because she's out of a gentile Nation
[1:10:11] I mean she's out of all the rest of the
[1:10:12] nation she needs to be cleaned up
[1:10:14] there's no Purity in her there's no
[1:10:16] Purity in her we need the righteousness
[1:10:17] of Christ amen so she is the one that's
[1:10:20] dirty and then it says and shall have
[1:10:22] purged the blood of Jerusalem from the
[1:10:24] midst thereof by the spirit of judgment
[1:10:26] and the spirit of burning so you see the
[1:10:30] Jews had to be forgiven for the
[1:10:32] crucifixion of Christ
[1:10:34] so what there is a judgment first of
[1:10:36] what it has to be purged from the blood
[1:10:38] of Christ it has to be purged from what
[1:10:41] they did there has to be a forgiveness
[1:10:42] there and remember that Paul says I
[1:10:44] can't come to you anymore now I'm going
[1:10:46] to the Gentiles you've turned it down
[1:10:47] you turned him down then you turn the
[1:10:49] message that followed he says I'm
[1:10:50] turning to them they have to be judged
[1:10:52] by Blood and what have we seen by the
[1:10:53] Jews ever since they've been judged by
[1:10:55] Blood they've been persecuted they've
[1:10:57] been destroyed they've been spread
[1:10:58] across the world they've been judged by
[1:10:59] Blood even to the millions that were
[1:11:01] killed during the during the second
[1:11:03] world war in those times right what is
[1:11:05] it they were purged by Blood and then it
[1:11:08] says by the spirit of burning the
[1:11:09] prophet of God points out he says that's
[1:11:11] when the 144 000 now come back and they
[1:11:13] receive their Messiah and they receive
[1:11:15] the same message that we have and that
[1:11:18] is the baptism of the Holy Ghost to
[1:11:20] restore them to the union of Christ
[1:11:22] amen so they've got to be judged for
[1:11:24] what they did and then they've got to
[1:11:25] get the same holy ghost that we do
[1:11:26] because you can't be a part of the you
[1:11:28] can't be a part of the elect unless you
[1:11:29] have the Life of Christ in you amen
[1:11:30] they've got to receive the Same Spirit
[1:11:33] it says and the Lord will create upon
[1:11:34] every Dwelling Place of Mount Zion and
[1:11:37] upon her assemblies a cloud and a smoke
[1:11:39] by day and The Shining of a flaming fire
[1:11:41] by night for upon all the glory shall be
[1:11:45] a defense and there shall be a
[1:11:47] tabernacle for a shadow in the daytime
[1:11:49] from the Heat and a place of refuge and
[1:11:51] a covert from the storm and from rain
[1:11:54] now we see a prophetic fulfillment to
[1:11:56] this in the Book of Revelation where
[1:11:58] John has a preview of the bride of
[1:11:59] Christ and this is in Revelation 21.
[1:12:01] John says I saw a new Heaven and a new
[1:12:04] Earth for the first Heaven and the first
[1:12:06] Earth were passed away and there was no
[1:12:08] more sea now it says a new Heaven and a
[1:12:10] new Earth but we know that the globe
[1:12:12] itself is not destroyed
[1:12:13] right it's just burned by fire we know
[1:12:15] that because it says that it was it was
[1:12:17] burned up and it says even the elements
[1:12:19] of the air burned up amen there's a
[1:12:21] total cleaning there's a total
[1:12:23] Destruction of anything that was tainted
[1:12:25] or touched by sin so everything is
[1:12:27] destroyed even the elements you know we
[1:12:28] talk about pollution in the air guess
[1:12:30] what the fire is going to burn so hot
[1:12:32] and so heavy it'll burn up the pollution
[1:12:33] there will be nothing left of sin here
[1:12:35] so when we're looking at newness here
[1:12:38] it's that the the original part is still
[1:12:40] there but everything that's touched by
[1:12:42] sin is destroyed
[1:12:43] and I John saw the holy city New
[1:12:46] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[1:12:49] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[1:12:52] her husband
[1:12:53] and I heard a Grace voice out of Heaven
[1:12:55] saying behold the Tabernacle of God is
[1:12:58] where with men this is the holy
[1:13:00] habitation now and he will dwell with
[1:13:03] them they shall be his people and God
[1:13:05] himself God himself shall be with him
[1:13:08] and be their God and God shall wipe away
[1:13:11] all tears from their eyes and there
[1:13:13] shall be no more death nor sorrow no
[1:13:15] crying neither shall be any more pain
[1:13:18] for the former things are passed away
[1:13:20] Hallelujah that the former things are
[1:13:22] going to be passed away with all that's
[1:13:24] happened to us and all that's happening
[1:13:26] and all that's gone on it'll all be
[1:13:28] passed away and he sat upon the he that
[1:13:31] sat upon the throne said behold I make
[1:13:34] all things new
[1:13:36] he didn't say I make all new things he
[1:13:40] says I make all things new because we
[1:13:43] think of new and we think well it's it's
[1:13:45] brand new it's just come into existence
[1:13:47] it's come into creation but the word new
[1:13:49] here is pointing back that I make things
[1:13:51] the way they used to be I make them as
[1:13:54] if they've never made a mistake you
[1:13:56] didn't do it in the first place I'm
[1:13:58] bringing you back to the original way it
[1:14:00] was when Adam and Eve first walked in
[1:14:02] the garden when they had a the the cool
[1:14:04] of the evening and God walked amongst
[1:14:06] them amen he says I make all things new
[1:14:08] I restore it back I redeem it back I put
[1:14:12] it to the way it was supposed to be in
[1:14:13] the first place
[1:14:14] I make all things new I'm not not I make
[1:14:17] all new things
[1:14:18] he's what he's restoring us back he's
[1:14:20] redeeming us back to where we were
[1:14:22] supposed to be amen that's why God can
[1:14:24] wipe away all tears
[1:14:27] that's why he can wipe away all tears
[1:14:29] nothing exists to point you to the pain
[1:14:31] and the suffering and the hurts and the
[1:14:32] bad decisions and the wrong this and the
[1:14:35] horrible that everything temporal
[1:14:36] everything touched by sin is destroyed
[1:14:38] and what he does is he restores it back
[1:14:40] to the way it was supposed to be
[1:14:42] now that's a quick picture that's just a
[1:14:44] quick picture of the Redemption plan of
[1:14:46] God that's where he's taking us amen but
[1:14:48] there's a lot that had to happen
[1:14:49] because he spent four thousand years
[1:14:51] giving them the law
[1:14:53] and the law achieved absolutely nothing
[1:14:55] except it kept them to the point where
[1:14:57] Redemption could Truly Come it kicked
[1:14:59] the can down the road it didn't pay the
[1:15:01] price of sin but it paid the the
[1:15:03] interest on sin and as it built up and
[1:15:05] built up and built up then after four
[1:15:07] thousand years Christ came amen and
[1:15:09] that's when the Plan of Redemption was
[1:15:10] truly set in motion was when Christ
[1:15:12] comes down the fullness of God in
[1:15:14] sinless flesh and he gives his life for
[1:15:16] us
[1:15:17] but that's when it starts but then
[1:15:20] there's a whole Plan of Redemption
[1:15:21] because he's got Abraham's Royal seed he
[1:15:23] still has to pull in he's got the
[1:15:25] natural Seed of Abraham but he's looking
[1:15:26] for a royal seed now he's got to fulfill
[1:15:28] the prophecy of there's another I'm
[1:15:30] going to make a people out of those that
[1:15:31] weren't to people that he was going to
[1:15:32] pull in once from all these different
[1:15:34] nations and whatnot so he's got to
[1:15:36] redeem everything back and he's got a
[1:15:38] roughly 2 000 years to do it right so he
[1:15:41] starts this big plan and we see that
[1:15:43] even though they were brought under a
[1:15:45] law we see grace interwoven all
[1:15:47] throughout that amen it's a beautiful
[1:15:49] thing because I've been reading and even
[1:15:51] sharing some of these these laws and
[1:15:53] there's some really crazy laws that he
[1:15:54] gave
[1:15:55] and it was always eye for eye tooth for
[1:15:57] tooth life for life
[1:15:59] and that's all the law could give you
[1:16:00] was that you could get your revenge
[1:16:03] but it never satisfied anything it never
[1:16:05] restored anything all it did was it made
[1:16:07] the other person pay the price that they
[1:16:09] made you pay and that's not where we
[1:16:10] want to go is it no it we come into the
[1:16:13] New Testament of Grace we come into the
[1:16:15] law of Christ and he says if they smoke
[1:16:17] you on this cheek then turn and give
[1:16:18] them the other one if they take your
[1:16:19] Coke give them your cloak if they force
[1:16:21] you to walk a mile then you walk too
[1:16:23] it's a completely different way of
[1:16:24] responding to the things that people do
[1:16:26] and say to us amen
[1:16:28] and then what happens is we come into
[1:16:30] this first church age and guess what we
[1:16:33] see yet another falling away don't we
[1:16:35] now the true church never Falls away God
[1:16:37] in every age has somebody that's
[1:16:39] faithful
[1:16:40] so we have that we have a second Adam
[1:16:42] comes in Christ The Perfect Adam and
[1:16:44] we'll get into this in much much more
[1:16:45] detail later not this service but we
[1:16:47] have a second Adam comes and he does his
[1:16:49] job perfectly and what's he doing he's
[1:16:51] calling out now with second Eve he's
[1:16:53] calling back the woman and what happens
[1:16:55] is she goes into the first age and most
[1:16:56] of them fall away
[1:16:58] remember we we mentioned this in the
[1:17:00] last service in Revelation 2. he says
[1:17:02] nevertheless he's talking to the first
[1:17:03] age the Ephesian Church age nevertheless
[1:17:05] I have somewhat against thee because
[1:17:07] thou has left thy first love
[1:17:10] what did Eve do left her first love
[1:17:14] he says you've done the exact same thing
[1:17:15] Eve did remember therefore from whence
[1:17:18] Thou Art fallen and repent and do the
[1:17:21] first works or else I will come unto
[1:17:23] thee quickly and will remove that
[1:17:25] Candlestick out of his place except I'll
[1:17:27] repent
[1:17:29] everything that this message has brought
[1:17:31] us is tied back to this Redemption plan
[1:17:33] and we'll get into this in great depth
[1:17:35] as we go through this amen but we see it
[1:17:37] all the way from the tine-up of loose
[1:17:39] ends all the way to the Seven Seals in
[1:17:41] the opening of the book everything in
[1:17:42] between is redemption Redemption
[1:17:44] Redemption Amen to what bring us to the
[1:17:47] place where we recognize the Redeemer
[1:17:48] even amongst us working in our very
[1:17:50] midst his very presence amen but he says
[1:17:52] here in Revelation 2 he says remember
[1:17:55] from whence Thou Art fallen in other
[1:17:56] words remember where you used to be
[1:17:58] remember what you used to have remember
[1:18:01] what you used to do remember the
[1:18:03] blessings of God remember the presence
[1:18:04] of God remember the sweetness of staying
[1:18:07] in line with the word of God he says you
[1:18:09] used to have something and you've lost
[1:18:10] it and what happened is we had a Prophet
[1:18:12] come in this age and what did he do he
[1:18:14] reminded us that we'd lost something
[1:18:16] didn't he because I've been going on for
[1:18:18] 1950 years and the church had completely
[1:18:21] forgotten almost what they used to have
[1:18:24] they didn't know that there was healing
[1:18:25] they didn't know there was Deliverance
[1:18:27] they didn't know there were signs and
[1:18:28] wonders they didn't know you could walk
[1:18:30] a life that was worthy of the Gospel it
[1:18:32] had all Fallen away in an awful way and
[1:18:35] then this messenger comes and he says
[1:18:36] it's all available to us now because
[1:18:38] we're in the last time we're in the end
[1:18:40] times we're in the times of restoration
[1:18:42] in the fullness of times the fullness of
[1:18:44] redemption comes through as well for us
[1:18:46] amen and so we've got to go even Beyond
[1:18:48] them we're coming to a Redemption that
[1:18:50] even redeems these bodies that we're in
[1:18:52] amen that gives us glorified bodies in
[1:18:54] these different things so the message if
[1:18:56] nothing else reminded us of what the
[1:18:57] first church had
[1:18:58] because he did the exact same works not
[1:19:01] only of the Apostles he did the exact
[1:19:02] same works of Christ himself which is
[1:19:04] what the apostles were doing right so he
[1:19:06] reminded us that all of these things he
[1:19:08] reminded us of what he we had fallen
[1:19:10] away from
[1:19:12] so it's shelters the first church that
[1:19:14] has to remember where you've fallen from
[1:19:15] it so last church has to remember what
[1:19:17] everyone's falling back from so that we
[1:19:19] can remember it and do the first works
[1:19:21] as Paula said and we come into the lay
[1:19:23] to see in church age in Revelation 3 and
[1:19:25] it says as many as I love I rebuke and
[1:19:28] chasten be zealous therefore and repent
[1:19:31] what did the prophet do what was one of
[1:19:33] the very first things that He restored
[1:19:35] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:19:39] baptism in the name of Jesus Christ why
[1:19:41] because if you're going to do the first
[1:19:42] works you better do them right and the
[1:19:44] first works are what repent Acts 2 38
[1:19:47] repent be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:19:49] Christ for the remission of sins and you
[1:19:51] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:52] so he comes in and he preaches what
[1:19:54] godhead he preaches water baptism and
[1:19:57] then he comes along and he preaches a
[1:19:59] message called the token and says you
[1:20:00] can do those right but until you get
[1:20:02] this then you're still not into the new
[1:20:04] birth you still don't have what's
[1:20:05] required you've got to come the way they
[1:20:07] did you've got to do the first works and
[1:20:09] you have to do them right otherwise you
[1:20:11] have no place in this Kingdom
[1:20:13] amen
[1:20:14] what was it he was laying out the first
[1:20:16] Works remember he says how can you teach
[1:20:18] Pentecostal baby Supernatural things if
[1:20:20] they won't do the first works then
[1:20:21] they're never going to step into the
[1:20:22] full Redemption that God has offered
[1:20:24] so we've got to do that you raised in
[1:20:26] the message doesn't matter you still got
[1:20:28] to do the first Works you've got to
[1:20:29] repent
[1:20:30] and you've got to be baptized the right
[1:20:32] way and you've got to receive the Holy
[1:20:34] Ghost
[1:20:35] and receiving the Holy Ghost is not
[1:20:37] receiving this message receiving the
[1:20:38] Holy Ghost is receiving the person of
[1:20:40] Christ in your life and he'll Quicken
[1:20:42] every bit of truth that's in this
[1:20:43] message to you after that amen
[1:20:46] I see a lot of Zeal today
[1:20:49] but I've said it before and the prophet
[1:20:50] says in the church age book he says the
[1:20:52] Zeal of the laodicean church is to
[1:20:54] repent
[1:20:55] man we have Zeal for the signs we have
[1:20:57] Zeal for the Wonders we have Zeal for
[1:20:59] the preaching of the word we have Zeal
[1:21:00] for the the worship and the praise and
[1:21:01] these different things we want
[1:21:03] leadership and we want guidance but how
[1:21:04] many of us want to repent
[1:21:07] because repent means to recognize that
[1:21:09] I'm not where I used to be
[1:21:12] not where I used to be yesterday but
[1:21:13] where I used to be in the beginning and
[1:21:15] what is it that's holding me back what
[1:21:17] is it that's keeping me from stepping
[1:21:18] back up into the place that Christ
[1:21:20] really has ordained for his bride to be
[1:21:22] in this age amen why what's the problem
[1:21:24] the laodicean condition resist
[1:21:26] repentance
[1:21:27] that's what he tells him to do it is
[1:21:29] because they're resistant to it it's not
[1:21:31] what comes naturally to them
[1:21:33] so for the bride of Christ I'm going to
[1:21:35] guarantee you that you're going to face
[1:21:36] resistance to repent because that's the
[1:21:39] spirit of the age is not to repent to
[1:21:41] believe that you're okay and this entire
[1:21:42] world is telling people you're okay the
[1:21:44] Way You Are
[1:21:46] everything there's doing and saying
[1:21:48] today is you're okay the way you are and
[1:21:50] you know what this message you know what
[1:21:51] this Bible says you're not good the way
[1:21:53] you are and you'll never make it the way
[1:21:54] you are and you must repent and you must
[1:21:56] be born again and that's the only way
[1:21:58] you're going to be good in the End Amen
[1:22:03] like I said I've been dwelling on some
[1:22:05] of these things that I know it sounds
[1:22:06] simple now but we get into the depth of
[1:22:07] it
[1:22:08] and some of it has just never jumped out
[1:22:10] until even the last few months
[1:22:12] but it's a beautiful thing because I
[1:22:14] believe as we go through this when you
[1:22:15] get into Redemption means then you'll
[1:22:18] see Deliverance you'll see healing
[1:22:20] you'll see the infilling of the Holy
[1:22:22] Spirit and then you'll see a a complete
[1:22:24] change in lives you'll see families
[1:22:26] change guess what it'll do it'll take
[1:22:27] pressure off of you
[1:22:30] because Redemption isn't about what you
[1:22:31] do it's about what the Redeemer does and
[1:22:33] it'll take pressure off you to be
[1:22:35] something that you can't be without him
[1:22:36] anyways right it'll reduce the stress in
[1:22:39] your life because you'll be looking to
[1:22:41] the promise and you'll be looking to the
[1:22:42] Redeemer that's fulfilling it not to you
[1:22:44] who has failed every time you've tried
[1:22:45] to do it in yourself amen so these are
[1:22:48] all things that I'm looking for amen
[1:22:49] where if we can let God go let ourselves
[1:22:52] go and let God have his way let him do
[1:22:54] the work in us then we'll see so such a
[1:22:56] greater effect in US amen
[1:22:58] but before we jump into those great
[1:23:00] things we have to understand where we
[1:23:02] were first
[1:23:03] if we understand where we were then we
[1:23:05] can understand what we're supposed to
[1:23:06] come back to and so we want to go back
[1:23:08] to in the beginning because that's our
[1:23:10] point of restoration
[1:23:11] our point of restoration is not time our
[1:23:13] point is in the beginning
[1:23:14] because that's where he's taken us back
[1:23:16] is to in the beginning to me and I want
[1:23:18] to start with this law of redemption
[1:23:20] that Moses wrote Because it's a that
[1:23:22] that's the foundation for all of this is
[1:23:23] it's God putting into words what this
[1:23:25] entire Plan of Redemption looks like
[1:23:27] and we look we're going to look in
[1:23:29] Deuteronomy 7 for this and we look here
[1:23:31] and it's amazing because in Deuteronomy
[1:23:33] 7 the children of God have not yet
[1:23:35] received the land
[1:23:38] they're going into the land of promise
[1:23:40] and God is already giving them a law of
[1:23:43] redemption which means that what God
[1:23:45] sees that they're going to lose it
[1:23:47] they're walking into a land of promise
[1:23:49] and God says I see failure ahead for the
[1:23:51] children of Israel before they've even
[1:23:53] received the land I'm putting a law in
[1:23:55] place so that when they mess up they'll
[1:23:57] have an opportunity to get their
[1:23:58] inheritance back to get back the land
[1:23:59] that I'm giving them amen
[1:24:01] so in Deuteronomy 7 verse 9 says know
[1:24:04] therefore that the Lord thy God he is
[1:24:06] God the faithful God which keepeth
[1:24:08] Covenant and mercy with them that love
[1:24:10] him and keep his Commandments to a
[1:24:12] thousand Generations so God says the
[1:24:14] problem coming is not going to be me
[1:24:16] because I do what I say I do every
[1:24:18] single time
[1:24:19] and repaireth them that hate him to
[1:24:21] their face to destroy them he will not
[1:24:23] be slacked to him that hateth him he
[1:24:25] will repay him to his face Thou shalt
[1:24:28] therefore keep the Commandments and the
[1:24:30] statutes and the judgments which I
[1:24:31] command thee this day to do them
[1:24:33] wherefore it shall come to pass if you
[1:24:35] hearken to these judgments and keep and
[1:24:38] do them that the Lord thy God shall keep
[1:24:40] the unto thee the Covenant and the mercy
[1:24:42] which he swear unto thy fathers and he
[1:24:45] will love thee and bless thee and
[1:24:47] multiply thee God's laying out all the
[1:24:49] blessings available to them he says he
[1:24:51] will also bless the fruit of thy womb
[1:24:53] the fruit of thy land thy corn thy wine
[1:24:55] thine oil the increase of thine kind the
[1:24:57] flocks of thy sheep in the lamb which he
[1:24:59] swear unto thy fathers to give thee Thou
[1:25:02] shalt be blessed above all people there
[1:25:05] shall not be Faith male nor female
[1:25:06] Barren among you or among your cattle
[1:25:08] and the Lord will take away from the all
[1:25:11] the all sickness and will put none of
[1:25:13] the evil diseases of Egypt which thou
[1:25:15] knowest upon thee but will lay them upon
[1:25:17] all that hate thee
[1:25:20] and thou shalt consume all the people
[1:25:23] which the Lord thy God shall deliver
[1:25:24] thee thine eye shall have no pity upon
[1:25:26] them neither shalt thou serve their gods
[1:25:28] for that will be a snare unto thee this
[1:25:31] is sounding really good I wouldn't mind
[1:25:33] being under this Covenant
[1:25:37] if Thou shalt say in thine heart these
[1:25:39] nations are more than I how can I
[1:25:41] dispossess them
[1:25:43] look at your own life is there something
[1:25:45] you're facing saying this is way bigger
[1:25:47] than I am
[1:25:48] read this next verse he says Thou shalt
[1:25:50] not be afraid of them but Thou shalt
[1:25:52] well remember what the Lord thy God did
[1:25:54] unto pharaoh and unto all Egypt the
[1:25:56] great Temptations with China I saw and
[1:25:58] the signs and the Wonders and the mighty
[1:26:00] hand and the stretched out arm whereby
[1:26:02] the Lord thy God brought thee out so
[1:26:04] shall the Lord thy God do unto all of
[1:26:07] the people of whom Thou Art afraid
[1:26:09] moreover the Lord that God will send the
[1:26:12] Hornet among them until they that are
[1:26:14] left and hide themselves from thee to be
[1:26:16] destroyed
[1:26:18] Thou shalt not be afraided at them for
[1:26:20] the Lord thy God is among you a mighty
[1:26:22] God and terrible and the Lord thy God
[1:26:24] will put out those Nations before thee
[1:26:26] little by little thou mayest not consume
[1:26:28] them at once lest the beasts of the
[1:26:30] field increase upon thee and the Lord
[1:26:32] thy God shall deliver them unto thee and
[1:26:34] thou shalt shall destroy them with the
[1:26:36] mighty destruction until they be
[1:26:38] destroyed and he shall deliver their
[1:26:40] kings unto thine hand and thou shalt
[1:26:42] destroy their name from under Heaven
[1:26:44] there shall be no man be able to stand
[1:26:46] before thee until thou Hast destroyed
[1:26:49] them
[1:26:50] so he's laying out the promise he's
[1:26:52] laying out the prophecy of God for when
[1:26:54] they come into Canaan amen you read a
[1:26:57] promise like that and you got to go in
[1:26:58] with some confidence
[1:27:00] you got to believe you've just come out
[1:27:02] of Egypt you've just seen God take you
[1:27:04] out with a mighty hand he's LED you up
[1:27:06] to the Red Sea parted that with his
[1:27:08] mighty hand walked you through closed it
[1:27:10] up on the Egyptians the next day he's
[1:27:12] feeding you Angel's food on the ground
[1:27:14] and every day thereafter and then he
[1:27:16] gives you this
[1:27:18] and you say what could possibly go wrong
[1:27:22] what could possibly go wrong he is every
[1:27:25] need supplied
[1:27:26] and then he says when we get there he's
[1:27:28] going to push everybody out and nobody
[1:27:30] will be able to stand before us we'll
[1:27:32] have great families we'll have great
[1:27:34] flocks great herds great crops we'll
[1:27:36] have great homes we'll have no problems
[1:27:38] no issues no sickness nothing's going to
[1:27:40] come against us in that land
[1:27:42] but you go back to the beginning says if
[1:27:44] you keep my keep my Commandments
[1:27:48] if you took God at his word as an as an
[1:27:51] Israelite then you were set for life he
[1:27:54] said to a thousand Generations
[1:27:56] thousand Generations
[1:28:01] but the law of redemption is only
[1:28:03] required if something's going to be lost
[1:28:05] and before he ever gets there he gives
[1:28:07] them all of these promises
[1:28:10] and before he ever gives it
[1:28:12] he says you're going to fall
[1:28:15] before I ever give you this land he says
[1:28:16] I know you're going to fall
[1:28:19] Deuteronomy 31 says then the Lord said
[1:28:21] unto Moses behold Thou shalt sleep with
[1:28:24] thy fathers and this people will rise up
[1:28:26] and go a whoring after the gods of the
[1:28:28] strangers of the land whether they go to
[1:28:30] be among them and will forsake me and
[1:28:32] break my Covenant which I made with them
[1:28:34] then my anger shall be kindled against
[1:28:36] them in that day and I will forsake them
[1:28:39] and I will hide my face from them and
[1:28:41] they shall be devoured and many evils
[1:28:43] and troubles shall fall shall befall
[1:28:45] them so that they will say in that day
[1:28:47] are not these evil come upon us because
[1:28:49] our God is not among us
[1:28:51] they blame it on God
[1:28:53] they don't say because we put God out
[1:28:55] from amongst us they say because God's
[1:28:57] left us
[1:28:59] and I will surely hide my face in that
[1:29:01] day for all the evils which they have
[1:29:03] wrought in that they are turned unto
[1:29:05] other gods now therefore write ye this
[1:29:07] song for you and teach it to the
[1:29:09] children of Israel put it in their
[1:29:11] mouths that this song may be a witness
[1:29:12] for me against the children of Israel
[1:29:15] for when I shall have brought them into
[1:29:17] the lamb which I swear unto their
[1:29:18] fathers with that floweth with milk and
[1:29:20] honey and they have eaten and then and
[1:29:23] filled themselves and waxed some fat so
[1:29:25] he says when I've done everything I
[1:29:26] promise to do
[1:29:28] then they'll turn onto other gods and
[1:29:30] serve them and provoke me and break my
[1:29:32] Covenant
[1:29:33] and it shall come to pass when many
[1:29:35] evils and troubles are befallen them
[1:29:37] that this song shall testify against
[1:29:39] them as a witness for it shall not be
[1:29:41] forgotten out of the mouths of their
[1:29:42] seed for I know their imagination which
[1:29:44] they go about even now before I have
[1:29:48] brought them into the land which I swear
[1:29:51] so this is Deuteronomy this is just
[1:29:53] before Joshua they're just about to go
[1:29:55] in the land and he's given them the
[1:29:57] promise then he said they're not going
[1:29:58] to stick with it they're never going to
[1:30:00] get the full benefit of it
[1:30:04] the great Jehovah Jireh though
[1:30:06] he looks he sees the problem
[1:30:10] and then he always makes a way
[1:30:12] he makes a promise they fall from the
[1:30:14] promise they fall into idolatry they
[1:30:16] fall away from God and yet he still
[1:30:17] always makes a way for them amen what
[1:30:19] are you saying because remember we'll go
[1:30:21] back to it in a moment Leviticus is
[1:30:23] where he gives the law of redemption
[1:30:24] Leviticus comes way before Deuteronomy
[1:30:26] Deuteronomy is the last thing before
[1:30:28] they go into the land and yet even
[1:30:30] before he even tells them they're going
[1:30:32] to fail he puts a law there of
[1:30:33] redemption so that there's a way for
[1:30:35] them to come back to what they need to
[1:30:36] have
[1:30:37] amen
[1:30:38] look at this Psalms 103. the Lord is
[1:30:41] merciful and gracious
[1:30:43] slow to anger and plenteous and mercy he
[1:30:46] will not always chide neither will he
[1:30:49] keep his anger forever
[1:30:51] he had not dealt with us after our sins
[1:30:53] nor rewarded us according to our
[1:30:56] iniquities for as the heaven is high
[1:30:58] above the Earth so great is his Mercy
[1:31:00] toward them that fear Him for as far as
[1:31:03] the East is from the West so far hath he
[1:31:06] removed our transgressions from us like
[1:31:08] as a father pitieth his children so the
[1:31:11] Lord pityth them that fear Him for he
[1:31:14] knoweth our frame he remembers that we
[1:31:17] are dust
[1:31:21] God knows the Fallen condition
[1:31:24] if Adam and Eve couldn't hold it in the
[1:31:26] beginning he knows we're not going to
[1:31:27] hold it when we're out from under that
[1:31:29] perfect place
[1:31:30] right it's The Human Condition is to
[1:31:32] fail and yet it says he remembers we're
[1:31:34] just dust
[1:31:35] right we're not what we ought to be
[1:31:38] and so every time he makes a way he
[1:31:40] makes a away amen and so when hard times
[1:31:42] fell on them and hard times can only
[1:31:45] come to Israel when they fell away from
[1:31:47] God as long as they stay with him they
[1:31:48] were fine so he made a way for when
[1:31:50] those Hard Times came when they got
[1:31:52] themselves into trouble see Israel the
[1:31:54] land of Canaan was their possession
[1:31:57] and that's what they look for remember
[1:31:58] when even even Jesus was there and the
[1:32:01] disciples are coming talking to him they
[1:32:03] said when are you going to restore the
[1:32:05] kingdom
[1:32:06] for the land of Israel for the majority
[1:32:08] of Israelites all they wanted was the
[1:32:10] Kingdom of Israel they wanted the Throne
[1:32:11] of David restored right yes it would be
[1:32:14] under Messianic rule but they wanted the
[1:32:16] land it was always about the land for
[1:32:17] them because Abraham's promise was what
[1:32:20] I'll give thy seed a land
[1:32:22] I'm going to give them a land full of
[1:32:24] milk and honey and these different
[1:32:25] things but as I pointed out earlier
[1:32:26] Abraham's Royal seed it was I am thy
[1:32:28] great portion I am thy great Shield I'm
[1:32:31] going to give you me but he says your
[1:32:32] people now your natural seed they're
[1:32:34] going to get a land and so everything
[1:32:35] about them was for the land and so God
[1:32:37] brings them into a land of promise and
[1:32:39] he says you're going to have problems
[1:32:40] here so he says I'm going to give you a
[1:32:41] law that'll let you get your land back
[1:32:43] even after you lose it
[1:32:46] he put something in there amen and the
[1:32:48] amazing thing is because in it for
[1:32:49] Israel because it's about the land guess
[1:32:51] what everybody's fighting over over
[1:32:53] there the land
[1:32:55] right nobody's looking for anything else
[1:32:57] listen I've never been to Israel but
[1:32:59] I've seen pictures it might have been
[1:33:01] Lush back then I don't know but today it
[1:33:03] really ain't Lush the the Jews have done
[1:33:05] an amazing job with it they've got the
[1:33:07] best water technology in the world
[1:33:08] everyone if they want to know how to do
[1:33:10] the best you can with water they go to
[1:33:12] the they go to the Jews they go to
[1:33:13] Israel for it they've turned a desert
[1:33:15] into a relative Oasis but it's still a
[1:33:17] desert today and yet everybody's
[1:33:19] fighting for it it's got minimal oil as
[1:33:21] far as they know minimal oil and gas
[1:33:23] these different things it can grow
[1:33:25] certain things but it's still not that
[1:33:27] great today and yet everybody's wanting
[1:33:29] to destroy it why because that is their
[1:33:31] inheritance what's Satan trying to do
[1:33:33] today he's trying to destroy our
[1:33:35] inheritance he's trying to destroy a
[1:33:36] land he's trying to keep us off the
[1:33:37] things that God has given us amen so we
[1:33:40] see the natural in Israel and then we
[1:33:41] see the spiritual in the bride and the
[1:33:43] chosen Church of Christ amen
[1:33:46] so we want to look at this law of
[1:33:47] redemption
[1:33:48] this is Leviticus 25. and he says the
[1:33:51] land shall not be sold forever
[1:33:54] for the land is mine
[1:33:56] in other words you can't give away what
[1:33:58] isn't your stone in the first place
[1:34:01] he says the land is mine he says I'm
[1:34:03] letting you be caretakers for it yes
[1:34:05] you're going to have titles and you're
[1:34:06] going to have Deeds but I own I own the
[1:34:08] title deed to everything I'm giving you
[1:34:10] so he says you can't give it away
[1:34:12] forever it's not up to you you're not
[1:34:14] allowed to sign away your land see today
[1:34:16] if I wanted to sell my house when I sell
[1:34:18] my house I sell it forever
[1:34:20] but he said in Israel you're not allowed
[1:34:21] to sell it away he says there's a time
[1:34:23] limit to how far you're allow how long
[1:34:25] you're allowed to be away from your
[1:34:26] inheritance
[1:34:27] and it was the Jubilee year right it was
[1:34:29] every 50th year
[1:34:31] he says what your managers he says
[1:34:34] you're strangers and sojourners with me
[1:34:37] so in other words this is not a place
[1:34:39] where you're supposed to get super
[1:34:40] comfortable even though it's a land for
[1:34:42] you yet your pilgrims and strangers as
[1:34:44] we see in other places of the scripture
[1:34:45] right every member of every tribe of
[1:34:48] Israel was given except for a couple we
[1:34:51] know but you know what I mean the ones
[1:34:52] that received it everybody got a piece
[1:34:54] of land he says that peace is yours
[1:34:55] forever
[1:34:56] we're setting types now
[1:34:58] each and every one of us has something
[1:35:00] that's given to us we're given a piece
[1:35:02] of the Lamb we're giving a piece of the
[1:35:03] world we're giving a peace of God
[1:35:04] whatever type you want to take however
[1:35:06] you want to talk about it he says you
[1:35:08] can't give away what's yours what's
[1:35:10] given to you it's only for you to sit on
[1:35:12] it and you can give it to somebody else
[1:35:14] and let them try and work it and they
[1:35:15] may get the benefit out of it but the
[1:35:17] benefit is meant for you not for them
[1:35:19] only you are supposed to have this thing
[1:35:21] indefinitely right what is it God owns
[1:35:25] the title of deed and he gives men the
[1:35:26] right to hold it on their own but it
[1:35:28] still belongs to him
[1:35:30] and we see that and and just in a
[1:35:32] looking forward and got and when they
[1:35:34] fell in the Garden of Eden brother Brown
[1:35:35] says what Adam held the title D and then
[1:35:37] he lost it and so what did it do went
[1:35:39] back to God and we see the the the exact
[1:35:42] type right here God says listen you
[1:35:44] might have it but it really belongs to
[1:35:45] me you're just caretakers in the land
[1:35:47] that I've given you he says in in all
[1:35:50] the land of your possession you shall
[1:35:52] Grant a Redemption for land so in other
[1:35:54] words there's no land that's exempt from
[1:35:56] redemption in Israel
[1:35:59] put it to your own life
[1:36:01] there's nothing in the bride of Christ
[1:36:04] that is exempt from Redemption
[1:36:07] do you know what that means today
[1:36:09] everything
[1:36:11] that is under that Redemptive Covenant
[1:36:13] belongs to us nothing's exempt
[1:36:16] your family's not exempt your job's not
[1:36:19] exempt your finances aren't exempt your
[1:36:21] walk with Christ certainly isn't exempt
[1:36:22] your church is an exempt the ministry is
[1:36:24] an exempt nothing here is exempt from
[1:36:27] the law of redemption everything can be
[1:36:29] restored by the law of redemption it's
[1:36:30] what he's saying here amen
[1:36:33] If thy brother be wax and poor and has
[1:36:37] sold away some of his possession and if
[1:36:39] any of his kin come to redeem it then
[1:36:42] shall he redeem that which his brother
[1:36:43] sold
[1:36:44] how does a man lose under a law of
[1:36:48] prosperity
[1:36:49] because he'd given him a law of
[1:36:50] prosperity he said if you follow my
[1:36:52] Commandments he says you're going to
[1:36:53] have everything you'll ever need and
[1:36:54] then some so how do you lose it what
[1:36:56] happens he gets away from serving God he
[1:36:58] gets away from the word and the law of
[1:36:59] God that's how he loses it so a brother
[1:37:01] doesn't wax poor because God's blessing
[1:37:04] him he whacks his poor because he
[1:37:06] stepped away from the things of God
[1:37:08] right and we say brother because the men
[1:37:10] held the titles in but let's talk about
[1:37:12] people the only way you get poor in the
[1:37:14] eyes of God is when you step away from
[1:37:16] the things of God right you're not poor
[1:37:18] because God makes you poor you're poor
[1:37:19] because you step away from the things
[1:37:21] that he's offered amen
[1:37:23] so the only way that you can get away
[1:37:25] from the things of God the goodness of
[1:37:27] God is if you get away from God himself
[1:37:28] that was the thing if you kept his
[1:37:30] Commandments you kept your land and all
[1:37:31] the blessings that came with it you
[1:37:33] stepped away from God and everything
[1:37:34] started to go to pieces
[1:37:36] when things start to go to Pieces
[1:37:37] sometimes we need to check up and say
[1:37:39] did I step away from God
[1:37:40] right
[1:37:43] who can get you out
[1:37:45] says under the law of redemption he says
[1:37:47] your brother or your close family
[1:37:50] can get you back
[1:37:52] you need a near Kinsmen
[1:37:54] you need somebody that's closely related
[1:37:56] to you to do this work it's not just a
[1:37:58] stranger a stranger can't walk up and
[1:38:01] redeem you it had to be a close King had
[1:38:04] to be somebody in relation to you amen
[1:38:07] what does he do
[1:38:09] let's say I fell
[1:38:11] I fall
[1:38:13] and I sell my home
[1:38:15] who's the only one that can redeem it in
[1:38:17] my family
[1:38:18] my brother Nathan
[1:38:20] right
[1:38:21] so who pays the price
[1:38:24] Nathan
[1:38:25] who gets to land me
[1:38:28] what kind of a person is going to sign
[1:38:30] on to that deal
[1:38:32] when you look at what it costs to buy a
[1:38:34] home today three four hundred thousand
[1:38:36] dollars
[1:38:38] why would anybody ever spend that kind
[1:38:41] of money
[1:38:42] on a person that keeps failing and
[1:38:44] failing and failing and deserves to be
[1:38:46] right where they are
[1:38:49] what kind of a character do you have to
[1:38:51] have to be a redeemer to put your money
[1:38:54] on the actions of somebody that got
[1:38:57] where they did by their poor actions
[1:38:59] where in all probability by human nature
[1:39:02] in the next five to ten years they're
[1:39:03] going to be right where they were in the
[1:39:05] beginning and you'll have lost your
[1:39:06] three to four hundred grand they'll have
[1:39:07] sold the house again taken and
[1:39:09] squandered the benefit of it and you
[1:39:11] paid the price and then they have
[1:39:12] they've just walked away from it as if
[1:39:14] it was nothing
[1:39:17] redeemers are special people
[1:39:19] even in those days redeemers were
[1:39:21] special people and we see it in the
[1:39:22] story of Ruth remember the the nearer
[1:39:24] Kinsman says I can't do it otherwise I'm
[1:39:26] going to ruin my own inheritance I'm
[1:39:28] going to put too much risk I'm going to
[1:39:29] take too much away from what I have and
[1:39:31] therefore I refuse to redeem it
[1:39:33] but Boaz was willing to do it amen the
[1:39:36] redeem gets the property the benefit the
[1:39:37] restoration and the other person pays
[1:39:39] the price
[1:39:40] you've got to value that person a whole
[1:39:42] lot
[1:39:43] to put that kind of money down when I
[1:39:44] start talking three or four hundred
[1:39:46] thousand dollars that's what we're
[1:39:47] talking about Redemption that's what it
[1:39:49] would look like in the natural for us
[1:39:50] today
[1:39:51] what is it He Paid a Debt he did not owe
[1:39:54] I owed a dad I could not pay I needed
[1:39:56] somebody to wash my sins away right and
[1:39:59] now I'm singing a brand new song because
[1:40:00] he paid a price
[1:40:03] and the question is what are we going to
[1:40:04] do with it what are we going to do with
[1:40:06] it amen
[1:40:10] take someone that believes you're going
[1:40:12] to stay the course
[1:40:14] because guess what if Nathan doesn't
[1:40:16] believe that I'm going to change my ways
[1:40:17] then he ain't going to redeem me is he
[1:40:19] no matter how much he might love me he's
[1:40:21] not going to redeem me if it's just
[1:40:22] going to be a waste of his money and his
[1:40:24] time and effort right he's got to have a
[1:40:26] faith that I'm going to do the right
[1:40:27] thing this time
[1:40:29] verse 26 says if a man have none to
[1:40:31] redeem it and himself be able to redeem
[1:40:34] it then let him count the years of the
[1:40:36] sale thereof and restore the over plus
[1:40:38] unto the man to whom he sold it that he
[1:40:40] may return to his next possession return
[1:40:42] unto his possession so this is relating
[1:40:43] to the law of Jubilee man the Jubilee
[1:40:46] year was every 50 years so what happened
[1:40:48] is if you got into hard times then you'd
[1:40:50] sell your property and what they do is
[1:40:52] they count how many years were left
[1:40:54] until the Year of Jubilee because at the
[1:40:55] Year of Jubilee everything came back
[1:40:57] everything came back no matter what no
[1:40:59] matter how good or bad you were on the
[1:41:01] 50th year then you got everything back
[1:41:03] that was yours from from the original
[1:41:05] disbursement they had in the beginning
[1:41:07] so he says if you get the money back if
[1:41:09] by somehow you get the money to redeem
[1:41:11] your property says you go and you got to
[1:41:13] pay that guy the portion of the years
[1:41:15] that are left so if I get if I sold my
[1:41:17] land in the 40th year and there's 10
[1:41:18] years left and that man uses it for two
[1:41:21] years and then I come back and I say
[1:41:22] I've got the money to pay you back I've
[1:41:23] got to pay him back 80 percent of what
[1:41:25] he gave me because he lost 80 percent of
[1:41:27] the time left the remaining eight years
[1:41:28] so he says you can do it yourself or you
[1:41:30] can come up with the money but how many
[1:41:32] people can come up with the money when
[1:41:33] they've lost everything they own
[1:41:35] what's the possibility of it happening
[1:41:37] about zero
[1:41:39] maybe you're lucked into it maybe you're
[1:41:41] stumbling through the desert ready to
[1:41:43] die and you fell into a gold you know a
[1:41:45] gold mine or something like that but
[1:41:47] generally speaking you can't redeem
[1:41:49] yourself because you've lost everything
[1:41:50] it takes to to produce any sort of money
[1:41:52] in your life amen
[1:41:54] it says in verse 28 but if he not be
[1:41:56] able to restore it to him then that
[1:41:59] which is sold shall remain in the hand
[1:42:01] of him that have bought it unto the Year
[1:42:03] of Jubilee and in the Jubilee it shall
[1:42:05] go out and he shall return unto his
[1:42:07] possession
[1:42:08] so at the 50th year no matter what you
[1:42:10] get your property back and any
[1:42:12] improvements that were done to it
[1:42:13] you didn't get the animals and all those
[1:42:15] things that was his but the property
[1:42:17] itself the land and any improvements
[1:42:18] he'd done to it it all came back to you
[1:42:20] in the 50th year listen God always makes
[1:42:23] a way that's what the Jubilee is because
[1:42:25] when man can't do it yet God always sets
[1:42:28] a time where he does it for you amen the
[1:42:30] Jubilee man no matter if you were good
[1:42:31] bad and different if you're walking with
[1:42:33] God not walking with God he always gives
[1:42:36] you a chance to come back and step back
[1:42:38] under the blessing of God to come back
[1:42:39] to your original inheritance amen what
[1:42:42] is it God was offering you a chance to
[1:42:45] make a change
[1:42:47] because listen when it comes to the year
[1:42:49] Jubilee if you hadn't gotten it back and
[1:42:51] your family hadn't gotten it back then
[1:42:53] what was he doing God had given you a
[1:42:54] chance to see what your leadership
[1:42:55] looked like
[1:42:56] the benefits of living under your life
[1:42:58] your way of thinking or the influence of
[1:43:00] another as it may be if you didn't have
[1:43:03] your land when the land of Jubilee came
[1:43:04] that was a time to reflect and say how
[1:43:06] did I get here and what am I going to
[1:43:08] change because now I'm getting it all
[1:43:09] back and last time I had it all I wasted
[1:43:11] it how did I waste it who was I
[1:43:14] listening to what was I doing that
[1:43:16] caused me to lose it because I'm going
[1:43:18] to lose it again if I don't if I don't
[1:43:19] change the way that I'm doing things
[1:43:21] amen
[1:43:22] and it was every 50 years and guess what
[1:43:24] he said you get 70. so everybody got a
[1:43:27] chance
[1:43:28] in their lifetime
[1:43:30] that's Grace
[1:43:31] Jubilee is Grace
[1:43:33] he says that you could go free no matter
[1:43:35] what you were in whether you're in
[1:43:36] slavery in bondage your family yourself
[1:43:38] it didn't matter everything got to go
[1:43:40] free if you chose to on the Year of
[1:43:42] Jubilee and that's the grace that he
[1:43:44] built in even to this what's he saying
[1:43:46] God offers all of us a chance
[1:43:48] scripture says that God is not willing
[1:43:50] that any should perish
[1:43:52] right second Peter 3 9 says the Lord is
[1:43:54] not slack concerning his promise as some
[1:43:57] men count slackness but is
[1:43:58] long-suffering to us word not willing
[1:44:00] that any should perish but that all
[1:44:03] should come to repentance the first
[1:44:06] works what so they can step back into
[1:44:09] the plan of God and the will of God
[1:44:11] under the alignment and authority of the
[1:44:13] word of God and that's where the
[1:44:14] blessings are going to come out amen
[1:44:15] listen God's Redemption is meant for his
[1:44:18] children
[1:44:19] because he's coming to redeem abroad
[1:44:21] he's not coming to redeem everybody but
[1:44:23] he's coming to redeem a bride but he
[1:44:25] still offers a piece of the pie to
[1:44:26] everybody that is for whosoever will
[1:44:29] John 3 16 is for everyone
[1:44:33] they'll get eternal life but they won't
[1:44:34] be in the city
[1:44:35] but he still offers them a chance to
[1:44:37] come back
[1:44:38] to take the opportunity to take the
[1:44:41] Jubilee and go free
[1:44:42] not the way that the bride goes free but
[1:44:44] yet they could still have it
[1:44:46] they still had the opportunity amen
[1:44:49] and they receive it by what free moral
[1:44:51] agency
[1:44:52] listen we think we have choices the
[1:44:53] bride of Christ we don't because we're
[1:44:55] predestinated to it we're for Destiny to
[1:44:57] it he's got he won't lose any
[1:45:00] when he says he won't lose any that
[1:45:02] means that we aren't we it's not reliant
[1:45:04] on us it can't be because we lose every
[1:45:06] single time and we see it time and time
[1:45:08] to the scripture the greatest of men the
[1:45:10] greatest of women they still fail time
[1:45:11] and time again so it's not by our choice
[1:45:13] it's by his choosing and his
[1:45:15] predestination and it's his power but
[1:45:17] this is the grace of God embedded into
[1:45:19] the uh into the law that was there God
[1:45:23] always offers a reset
[1:45:25] God offers that one time get out of jail
[1:45:28] card
[1:45:30] and you know what sometimes I get out of
[1:45:32] jail card is me and you
[1:45:35] that's what people are seeing is they're
[1:45:36] seeing Christ they're seeing to get out
[1:45:38] of jail card they're seeing the Jubilee
[1:45:40] in you and they get to choose do I take
[1:45:42] it or do I turn it down
[1:45:43] so often we're looking to something
[1:45:45] outside of us but sometimes where they
[1:45:46] get out of jail card that people are
[1:45:48] looking for to take them out of where
[1:45:49] they are into something that God has at
[1:45:51] so much greater amen what is it the
[1:45:53] purpose of the reset was not to give
[1:45:55] them their land
[1:45:57] the purpose of the reset was to get them
[1:45:59] back into communion with God
[1:46:01] to get them back to where he could bless
[1:46:03] them
[1:46:03] the land wasn't the blessing God was the
[1:46:06] blessing the land was under his benefit
[1:46:07] then amen you're looking to get back to
[1:46:10] him and then he would bless the land but
[1:46:12] if you focused on all you focused on was
[1:46:14] the land then God was going to go by the
[1:46:15] wayside each and every time amen
[1:46:18] so the question is would you go with
[1:46:19] what you had in your own leadership and
[1:46:21] your own guidance would you come back
[1:46:22] and submit yourself and say Lord I'm
[1:46:24] going to come back under the preaching
[1:46:25] of the word I'm going to come back under
[1:46:26] the law because that's where the
[1:46:28] blessing really is
[1:46:32] God's Jubilee was a chance to say I
[1:46:34] messed up I'm going to take the
[1:46:36] opportunity not to come back to my land
[1:46:37] to come back to him
[1:46:39] amen
[1:46:42] you can't be in the promise and be out
[1:46:43] of your inheritance
[1:46:47] it's that simple
[1:46:49] you can't be doing the things of God and
[1:46:50] be out of your inheritance
[1:46:52] because that's what He blesses you with
[1:46:53] is within your inheritance that's where
[1:46:55] he wants you to be is in your
[1:46:56] inheritance so if you're not seeing the
[1:46:58] blessings of God by the word then you're
[1:46:59] in a problem
[1:47:00] you've got an issue because he always
[1:47:02] blesses you when you're where you're
[1:47:04] supposed to be in your inheritance amen
[1:47:07] we get our inheritance back but the
[1:47:09] grace is not there to give us the land
[1:47:10] it's to give us him again
[1:47:12] it's to bring us back to the place where
[1:47:13] he can bless us amen
[1:47:16] sometimes we think it's all about us
[1:47:18] that he does these things that he gives
[1:47:20] us these things because of who we are
[1:47:22] but he gives them to us because of who
[1:47:24] he is
[1:47:25] and we're the benefactor for it amen
[1:47:27] because remember our righteousness is as
[1:47:29] filthy rags right there's nothing good
[1:47:31] we can say or do to deserve this in fact
[1:47:33] he tells them this Deuteronomy 9 he says
[1:47:36] Hear o Israel Thou Art to pass over
[1:47:38] Jordan this day to go to possess Nations
[1:47:40] greater and mightier than thyself
[1:47:44] think of it as a good person
[1:47:47] there are gooder people there are
[1:47:49] mightier people in their flesh than many
[1:47:52] of us believers
[1:47:55] if you were to compare us before we got
[1:47:57] saved to them what they are now many of
[1:47:59] them were better than us
[1:48:03] I can say it
[1:48:06] there's people that are better than you
[1:48:07] is what he's saying
[1:48:09] cities greed and fenced up to heaven a
[1:48:12] people great and Tall the children of
[1:48:14] the anakims whom thou knowest and of
[1:48:15] whom thou has hurt say who can stand
[1:48:17] before the children of anak understand
[1:48:19] therefore this day that the Lord thy God
[1:48:22] is he which goeth before thee as a
[1:48:24] consuming fire he shall destroy them and
[1:48:27] he shall bring them down before thy face
[1:48:29] so shalt thou drive them out it's
[1:48:32] hilarious he says it's going to go
[1:48:33] before your face and you're going to
[1:48:34] drive them out in everything we read
[1:48:36] before that was what he did
[1:48:39] wasn't them doing it he says I'm gonna
[1:48:42] do it and they're going to fall before
[1:48:44] your face and you're going to drive them
[1:48:45] out
[1:48:46] his work but it looks like it's
[1:48:47] happening by us
[1:48:49] let's not get too caught up in ourselves
[1:48:51] he says and Destroy them quickly as the
[1:48:53] Lord has said unto thee speak not thou
[1:48:56] in thine art after that the Lord thy God
[1:48:58] had cast them out from before thee
[1:49:00] saying for my righteousness the Lord
[1:49:03] hath brought me in to possess this land
[1:49:05] he says and for the but for the
[1:49:07] wickedness of these nations the Lord to
[1:49:10] drive them out from before thee
[1:49:12] not for thy righteousness or for the
[1:49:15] uprightness of thine heart thus thou go
[1:49:16] to possess their land but for the
[1:49:18] wickedness of these nations the Lord thy
[1:49:20] God to drive them out from before thee
[1:49:22] and that he may perform the word which
[1:49:24] the Lord swear unto thy fathers Abraham
[1:49:26] Isaac and Jacob
[1:49:28] notice now because the world looks at
[1:49:30] this and they say God's in there and he
[1:49:31] says kill the women and the children not
[1:49:33] just the men and what kind of a
[1:49:34] righteous God could do that and he says
[1:49:36] here I did it because of their
[1:49:37] wickedness they were killing their own
[1:49:39] children
[1:49:40] was that what they were doing and the
[1:49:41] cup of the amorites was full he says
[1:49:43] this is the time now to pay back what
[1:49:45] they've been doing all these hundreds of
[1:49:46] years right so he's going in there but
[1:49:48] he says I'm giving you the land but I'm
[1:49:49] judging them and I'm giving you them
[1:49:51] their land because they're under
[1:49:52] judgment not because you're so perfect
[1:49:55] not because you're so great not because
[1:49:57] you have a heart after God's Own Heart
[1:50:00] he said so don't get lifted up in
[1:50:01] yourself with these things
[1:50:03] he says this is by election
[1:50:05] not because you're good
[1:50:08] you might say well I wasn't one of those
[1:50:09] people brother John I didn't test him in
[1:50:11] the wilderness I didn't cause him you
[1:50:12] know who we were we were the ones they
[1:50:14] were driving out
[1:50:15] that's our heritage we were Canaanites
[1:50:17] we were Gentiles we are out the
[1:50:19] scripture says we are aliens from God
[1:50:22] so no matter how good we think we are
[1:50:24] unless we had the grace of God we'd be
[1:50:26] the ones that were being driven out
[1:50:27] before the Israelites time and time and
[1:50:28] time again
[1:50:29] amen he says understand therefore that
[1:50:32] the Lord thy God giveth thee not this
[1:50:34] good land to possess it for thy
[1:50:36] righteousness for thou art has
[1:50:38] stiff-necked people
[1:50:42] I Can Be Stiff necks sometimes
[1:50:44] amen sometimes Pride takes hold
[1:50:46] sometimes I think it's me that's doing
[1:50:48] things
[1:50:51] we blend just into these scriptures just
[1:50:53] fine at times we've got our own place of
[1:50:54] stiff neckedness our own place of uh of
[1:50:58] Pride our own place of refusal to bow
[1:51:00] down our own what is it sometimes
[1:51:03] refusing to acknowledge that we can't
[1:51:05] even do it
[1:51:07] that's the pride that kills us the most
[1:51:08] is when we think it's on our basis that
[1:51:10] I've got the strength I've got the
[1:51:12] discipline I've got the goods I've got
[1:51:14] the background I've got the family I've
[1:51:15] got the ministry whatever it is and we
[1:51:17] take him out of the picture completely
[1:51:19] it makes us stiff-necked and he's got to
[1:51:21] break us down so that we realize that
[1:51:23] it's him and us that does all of these
[1:51:24] things amen
[1:51:26] remember and forget not how thou
[1:51:29] provokes the Lord thy God to wrath in
[1:51:31] the wilderness from the day that thou
[1:51:32] didst apart out of the land of Egypt
[1:51:34] until you came into this place ye have
[1:51:37] been rebellious against the Lord also in
[1:51:40] horribly provoke the Lord to wrath so
[1:51:42] that the Lord was angry with you to have
[1:51:44] destroyed you
[1:51:46] I hope we're not there I don't believe
[1:51:48] we are I believe under this Grace this
[1:51:51] is not the place that we want to be
[1:51:52] found amen because God's speaking to a
[1:51:54] mixed multitude
[1:51:55] they're about to go into Israel now
[1:51:57] that's about he's speaking to what
[1:51:59] happened with a mixed multitude if I can
[1:52:01] put it that way because remember they're
[1:52:02] going into into Jordan and it's supposed
[1:52:04] to be only the best of the best going in
[1:52:06] but yet it's still a mixed multitude
[1:52:07] because we see Aiken going in there and
[1:52:09] we see the different ones that mess up
[1:52:11] not too long after it amen but he's
[1:52:13] speaking to a people that what
[1:52:16] couldn't do it
[1:52:17] couldn't stay in the law even in the
[1:52:19] wilderness even without the influence of
[1:52:22] the of the the outside tribes and these
[1:52:23] different things even with the pillar of
[1:52:25] fire in their midst every night and the
[1:52:28] cloud by day they couldn't do it even
[1:52:30] with the Manna From God they couldn't do
[1:52:31] it because it wasn't in them to do it
[1:52:34] wasn't in them to do it it's Grace that
[1:52:36] it's in us to do it
[1:52:38] it's Grace that it's in us to do it amen
[1:52:40] that we can recognize the pillar of fire
[1:52:42] amen that we can feed on the word that
[1:52:44] he's given to us and that we can submit
[1:52:46] ourselves to it and let it have a
[1:52:47] working in our life and not get caught
[1:52:48] up in Pride because we think that it's
[1:52:50] something we're doing in ourselves amen
[1:52:53] what is the law of Redemption all about
[1:52:55] it's reminding us we do have a land
[1:52:58] we do have an inheritance we do have a
[1:53:01] place that's just for us and nobody else
[1:53:02] is supposed to take that place remember
[1:53:04] we read in that that last service I
[1:53:06] believe or the one before where brother
[1:53:07] Brown said nobody can take your place
[1:53:11] what does it mean to be in the body of
[1:53:13] Christ it means to get to your piece of
[1:53:15] land to get to your inheritance to get
[1:53:17] to your position and get connected into
[1:53:19] that body so that when everybody's in
[1:53:21] their place now the body can stand up
[1:53:23] with power and authority because the
[1:53:25] head comes down and the body is United
[1:53:27] together everyone in their position and
[1:53:29] God can start to work in them amen
[1:53:32] amen let's just stand together if we
[1:53:33] would
[1:53:35] the thing about the law of redemption is
[1:53:37] that it's not just about the land
[1:53:39] the the land was always to bring them
[1:53:42] back to what the god that gave them the
[1:53:43] land in the first place and we'll see
[1:53:45] that that's what this Redemption is
[1:53:46] about as we move through these things is
[1:53:48] that it's not just about the gifts
[1:53:50] it's not about the healing it's not
[1:53:52] about the Deliverance it's not about the
[1:53:53] good things of God only but it's about
[1:53:55] the person of God himself amen it's
[1:53:57] bringing us back into relationship and
[1:54:00] that's what we're going to touch in as
[1:54:01] we go into the next service amen you
[1:54:03] notice here he didn't promise that it
[1:54:05] wasn't going to be hard
[1:54:06] and say we wouldn't face opposition
[1:54:09] didn't say that we wouldn't have to
[1:54:11] labor
[1:54:12] didn't say that there wouldn't be
[1:54:13] influences out there trying to get in
[1:54:14] that we wouldn't have to keep our eyes
[1:54:16] peeled you know that we wouldn't have to
[1:54:18] set a guard about our homes but he says
[1:54:20] if you'll stay with my Commandments
[1:54:22] he says if you'll stay with what I've
[1:54:24] told you to do he says not a single one
[1:54:26] of them will conquer you no one will
[1:54:27] overcome no sickness
[1:54:30] nothing he said death can't come your
[1:54:32] way
[1:54:33] if you'll just stay with what I've told
[1:54:34] you to do amen let's bow our heads here
[1:54:38] Heavenly Father
[1:54:41] Lord we see so much interwoven in the in
[1:54:44] your word this morning Lord
[1:54:45] amen Lord we see mercy and Grace
[1:54:48] Lord we see judgment as well
[1:54:50] Lord and smack dab in the middle of it
[1:54:52] is an unworthy people Lord that can't do
[1:54:54] a thing about it without your grace in
[1:54:56] our lives Lord without the life of the
[1:54:58] Holy Spirit within us Lord we don't have
[1:55:00] a hope
[1:55:01] but Lord you've given us a spirit that
[1:55:03] makes us cry Abba Father Lord to reach
[1:55:06] out to you
[1:55:07] Lord to reach out to the one that has
[1:55:09] all the money
[1:55:10] all the authority all the power
[1:55:14] Lord that can do anything
[1:55:16] Lord that can do anything even that
[1:55:18] changes from a stiff-neck people Lord
[1:55:20] into fleshly tables of Hearts wherewith
[1:55:23] your word can be written in our lives

[1:55:32] you have Lord set aside for each and
[1:55:34] every one of us Lord and may we not just
[1:55:37] come back for the landlord but may we

[1:55:41] great and exceeding portion that we seek
