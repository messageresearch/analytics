[45:02] Jesus no offense and I'm sure you're not
[45:05] offended and trust that you brought
[45:07] Jesus with you hey man glad to have
[45:09] again our brother Chad with us and the
[45:11] family and of course sister Lily
[45:13] praise the Lord or bless her a man and I
[45:17] I thought I was looking at it and I said
[45:20] yeah I said that's brother cater sitting
[45:22] there a man I guess he'd be pretty old
[45:26] now very old but our brother looked like
[45:31] him from behind there and so we welcomed
[45:36] our brother cater hey man so it's good
[45:39] so it's going back in time a lot but
[45:43] again God ordained it god predestinated
[45:46] it God knew about it
[45:47] a man so we thank the Lord for it praise
[45:50] the name of the Lord and so we welcome
[45:54] of course our brother Stephen coffee and
[45:57] sister Sarah a man I think she was here
[46:01] and when the family was here yes I
[46:04] remember
[46:05] so god bless her it's nice to have her
[46:07] with us and our brother Stephen to
[46:09] minister the word so we're trusting that
[46:11] God is going to minister to us what we
[46:13] need that has been that's been my prayer
[46:16] and as I've thought about it our brother
[46:19] coming to minister and since he's been
[46:22] here I've been praying Lord I said I
[46:23] pray you anoint him and I said what will
[46:26] come forth will be what we need and
[46:29] again it's what we need not as a group
[46:31] but as individuals a man that God is
[46:34] going to minister to you as a son and
[46:37] daughter by the grace of God and on over
[46:40] all as the bride of the Lord Jesus
[46:41] Christ
[46:42] so the grace of God I pray to be with
[46:45] our brother Stephen amen we appreciate
[46:48] his ministry when he was here the last
[46:50] time and we're and we know that we're
[46:52] going to appreciate the ministry again
[46:54] and again we're believing that it's not
[46:56] brother Steven coffee it's the Holy
[46:58] Ghost it is Christ in the form of the
[47:01] Holy Ghost praise the name of the Lord
[47:04] he wouldn't leave us he wouldn't forsake
[47:06] us a man I trust you don't think that's
[47:09] because he meets my physical needs no
[47:12] he's here to meet our spiritual needs a
[47:14] man and then according to the spiritual
[47:17] you bless you physically a man that's
[47:19] his promised in his word so praise God
[47:22] for the for the Ministry of the word and
[47:25] let's appreciate it
[47:27] let's feed on it let's hunger and thirst
[47:30] because the hour is coming when it's
[47:31] going to it's going to fade away it's
[47:34] going to pass away
[47:35] oh yeah the hour is coming when when
[47:37] when we won't be allowed to minister
[47:39] what we're ministering we won't be
[47:41] allowed to preach what we're preaching
[47:42] not by any means our brother Stephen
[47:45] won't be allowed to travel and minister
[47:47] and what he preaches so we pray the
[47:50] grace of God that we're going to
[47:52] appreciate what we hear tonight amen
[47:55] that it's going to it's going to do what
[47:56] God has ordained it to do and God has
[47:59] ordained Ian to do and what is that and
[48:01] that is to increase our faith a man and
[48:04] nun and just increase our faith is to
[48:07] make sure that we have the faith that
[48:08] pleases God amen
[48:10] that our brothers going to minister that
[48:12] word and faith comes by hearing the word
[48:15] and I trust we're hearing in our souls
[48:17] not in our heads
[48:18] Amen by the grace of God and the faith
[48:21] comes by hearing the word on the inside
[48:23] of the inside
[48:24] amen in your soul not in your head you
[48:28] can hear it all with your with your
[48:30] natural ears but let him better than
[48:32] hear nine tears God's not interested in
[48:36] your ears he's interested only in the
[48:38] ear of the soul that in that I wasn't
[48:41] here hear what the Spirit is saying amen
[48:44] let him that I've been here and hear I
[48:46] hear what the Spirit is going to say
[48:47] tonight through our brother Steven amen
[48:50] thank God for bringing the brother our
[48:51] way amen and what I will look forward to
[48:55] his ministry again in the future and as
[48:57] the Lord leads amen and we'll pray for
[49:00] our brother Steven and for sister Sarah
[49:02] as becoming a part of the ministry a man
[49:06] it's a tremendous challenge a man and
[49:10] it'll become more more a reality of
[49:13] course as they get older and the longer
[49:15] that they are in the ministry
[49:16] so God God's grace to them is my prayer
[49:19] and for me it's been over fifty years a
[49:22] long time it's hard to believe you know
[49:25] that I was taught I was talking and
[49:27] ministry to brethren that words that
[49:29] were in the in the ministry for 50 years
[49:32] and more now they're gone now
[49:34] we're taking their place a man see
[49:37] exactly what the Prophet said you young
[49:39] ministers he says got to take our place
[49:41] and he's you got to take this message on
[49:43] to the coming of the Lord by the grace
[49:46] of God onto the revelation of his coming
[49:49] for his right
[49:50] praise the name of the Lord so god bless
[49:52] you I want you to stand we're gonna sing
[49:54] only believe as our brother Steven comes
[49:57] to to the minister of the word of God
[49:59] amen this is not a Creed this is the
[50:02] word in the beginning was the word and
[50:05] the Word was with God and the Word was
[50:07] God
[50:08] a man so he'll get himself out of the
[50:11] way and it'll be Christ in our brother
[50:14] Steven and he be ministering to his sons
[50:17] and daughters praise the name of the
[50:19] Lord not not just natural human beings
[50:22] with spiritual amen now that I come from
[50:25] this hospital or that era that womb were
[50:28] that womb we come from the womb of the
[50:30] word by the grace of God amen we are new
[50:33] creatures in Christ Jesus and then and
[50:37] that's why that's what he's looking at
[50:38] he's that new creature and that's why
[50:41] our brother has come tonight the Lord
[50:43] has brought our brother for the minister
[50:45] to that new creature in Christ amen
[50:48] because that's the one that needs the
[50:50] word that's the one that needs the faith
[50:53] and his own real thirsting for it to get
[50:55] us out of time and into eternity
[50:57] so the grace of God be with us amen this
[51:01] thing only believed as our brother comes
[51:03] and being prayer for him and for one
[51:06] another to receive the word hear what

[54:25] in the presence of the Lord and we're
[54:28] certain that the presence of the Lord is
[54:29] here tonight you believe that a man you

[54:43] musicians we're thankful for him you
[54:46] know what why you're standing I'd like
[54:48] to invite you to turn with me to the
[54:49] book of second Peter if you would and
[54:52] I'll let's read a scripture before
[54:55] before you can be seated there I'd like
[54:59] to read 2nd Peter chapter 3 and I'd like
[55:02] to read a portion of Scripture there 2nd
[55:12] Peter chapter 3 and let's start at verse
[55:18] 3 knowing this first that there shall
[55:23] come in the last days scoffers walking
[55:26] after their own lusts and obviously when
[55:28] we know that wouldn't we hear the word
[55:31] do we see the words the last days that
[55:33] means now and saying where is the
[55:38] promise of his coming for since the
[55:40] father's fell asleep all of these things
[55:42] continue as they were from the beginning
[55:44] of creation for this they willingly are
[55:46] ignorant of that by the Word of God the
[55:49] heavens were of old and the earth
[55:50] standing out of the water and in the
[55:52] water whereby the world that was being
[55:55] overflowed with water perished but the
[55:58] heavens and the earth which are now by
[56:00] the same word are kept in store reserved
[56:02] unto fire against the day of judgment
[56:05] and perdition of ungodly men but beloved
[56:08] be not ignorant of this one thing that
[56:11] one day is with the Lord as a thousand
[56:13] years and a thousand years as one day
[56:15] and the Lord is not slack concerning his
[56:18] promise as something
[56:19] count slackness but is long-suffering to
[56:22] us-ward in other words he is not slow in
[56:25] fulfilling his promise he's not he's not
[56:29] out of kilter with what he said it to be
[56:32] his time he's not slow he's got it right
[56:35] on according it to his time but his
[56:38] long-suffering to us-ward not willing
[56:40] that any should perish but that all
[56:42] should come to repentance but the day of
[56:45] the Lord will come as a thief in the
[56:47] night and the which the heavens shall
[56:49] pass away with a great noise and the
[56:50] elements shall melt with a fervent heat
[56:52] and the earth also in the world's and
[56:54] there in the works that are therein
[56:55] shall be burned up seeing them that all
[56:59] these things shall be dissolved what
[57:03] manner of persons ought you to be in all
[57:04] holy conversation and godliness looking
[57:08] for the hastening to the coming of the
[57:10] day of God wherein the heavens being
[57:12] fire and shall be dissolved and the
[57:14] elements shall melt with fervent heat
[57:15] nevertheless we according to his promise
[57:18] look for new heavens and new earth
[57:19] wherein dwelleth white righteousness
[57:22] wherefore beloved seeing that you look
[57:24] for such things be diligent that you may
[57:27] found of him in peace without spot and
[57:30] blameless let's pray
[57:32] gracious Heavenly Father we are so
[57:34] thankful for this place to come in and
[57:37] worship you we are so thankful for your
[57:40] love and for your mercy and the grace
[57:42] that you have extended to us the Lord it
[57:45] is by that grace that we all stand in
[57:47] this room tonight we say that we believe
[57:48] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it
[57:51] is upon the same grace and faith that we
[57:53] accept that blood that was shed on our
[57:55] on our behalf and we stand here and put
[57:58] our hands in the blood of Jesus Christ
[57:59] and say Lord if not for grace where
[58:02] would we be and so Lord tonight I pray
[58:04] that you would bind our hearts and our
[58:05] minds together on the basis of your word
[58:08] and nothing less the basis of your word
[58:10] and if there be any need tonight if
[58:12] there need any encouragement that
[58:14] anybody needs any instruction any
[58:17] guidance anything Lord we know that you
[58:20] can give it and so I give myself into
[58:23] your hands and I ask that we would all
[58:24] give ourselves into your hands the best
[58:26] way that we know how and that you would
[58:28] have your way and in the name of the
[58:31] Lord Jesus Christ we pray this
[58:32] amen and amen you can be seated thank
[58:35] you well it is uh again wonderful to be
[58:39] here tonight and it's wonderful to be
[58:40] with you and it's been a long time since
[58:44] the last time I was here the last time I
[58:46] was here I was an unmarried single man
[58:50] as my father would say suave debonair
[58:53] independently wealthy and now I'm
[58:55] married and I hope have all of that and
[58:58] a wife so I I'm very thankful for my
[59:02] wife and I'm very thankful that she
[59:04] loves to travel and she comes with me
[59:07] and I think behind every good man
[59:10] there's a good woman in my case I just
[59:12] have a good woman but I'm very thankful
[59:15] for and I'm very very thankful that we
[59:18] could both come and be with you and I
[59:21] hope that this weekend is I hope this
[59:25] weekend will be a blessing to you I'm
[59:27] not a very good not a very good minister
[59:30] but the few fish and a few loaves that I
[59:34] have I'll just give it into the hands of
[59:36] Jesus and I think that who can do
[59:38] wonders wonders with it if if we allow
[59:41] him and your 50% of the of the gift and
[59:46] I can put all that I have into his hands
[59:50] but unless you are willing to receive it
[59:52] and it's just gonna sit there and I
[59:55] think it'd be a shame for us to come out
[59:57] of this weekend with with the Lord still
[59:59] having things in his hand that he would
[1:00:00] would have given us if we would just
[1:00:02] have pulled so it's nothing that's
[1:00:05] nothing in me it's you that's gonna
[1:00:07] receive and I believe that so we move
[1:00:10] ourselves out of the way and we allow
[1:00:11] the Holy Spirit to move and I think that
[1:00:12] he'll speak to you I really believe that
[1:00:13] and no matter what it is or no matter
[1:00:16] how odd it is I was moved a little bit
[1:00:20] different than I normally am and that
[1:00:22] you may hear things that I've said
[1:00:24] before but I was moved in a little bit
[1:00:26] of a different direction this this this
[1:00:29] weekend for some reason and I I hope
[1:00:33] that it'll be a blessing to you and I'm
[1:00:34] not saying it to anybody
[1:00:36] I don't preach like that I don't don't
[1:00:37] preach at people I preach to people and
[1:00:40] I preach with people because many times
[1:00:43] are preaching to myself
[1:00:45] but I just would ask you to pull and
[1:00:48] we'll see how the Lord moves and
[1:00:50] whatever I say it's because it's on my
[1:00:52] heart to say it's not directed to
[1:00:53] anybody or anything like that I think
[1:00:55] that's the way it should be done what
[1:00:59] I'm thankful to be here and my family
[1:01:00] sends you greetings by the berry from
[1:01:02] Hickory Bible Tabernacle sends you
[1:01:04] greetings and he we came from 80 degree
[1:01:08] weather
[1:01:08] I guess about 30 degrees here 25 Celsius
[1:01:12] so um you can't have it we're going back
[1:01:15] to it you can keep what you have but all
[1:01:20] the saints down there in Hickory and the
[1:01:22] southeast and they send their greetings
[1:01:24] and they said to say hello and the
[1:01:26] family dearly loves you and they all
[1:01:29] wish they could be here they all really
[1:01:30] they're really jealous when I say I'm
[1:01:32] going to new flame I'm going to preach
[1:01:33] and they say man I wish I was really
[1:01:35] going with you they they wish they could
[1:01:36] come so thankful for that thankful for
[1:01:39] the hospitality the wonderful
[1:01:41] hospitality oh brother Matt his family
[1:01:42] and the paul and thankful for that good
[1:01:47] to meet brother cars from the sisters
[1:01:48] sharing this afternoon we had some great
[1:01:50] fellowship good time together and I hope
[1:01:53] to meet all of you if I haven't and uh
[1:01:55] but I think I think I will and let's
[1:01:58] let's give it a shot anyways and I love
[1:02:02] you for each and every one of you know
[1:02:03] I'm very thankful to be here I just want
[1:02:05] to say - I'm very thankful for brother
[1:02:07] Paul and I don't know if you know this
[1:02:08] or not it because it might not get get
[1:02:10] said here but the our daily strength
[1:02:14] devotionals that are out there those are
[1:02:17] those those would not be in existence if
[1:02:20] it wasn't for brother Paul and I don't
[1:02:22] know if you know how much of a big of a
[1:02:24] part he plays in it but he's the one who
[1:02:27] coordinates all of the efforts of the
[1:02:28] entire team in order for that to get out
[1:02:31] and those those affect have affected the
[1:02:35] lives of tens of thousands of people all
[1:02:38] across the world all over the place and
[1:02:41] it's sound it's nothing do to anyone man
[1:02:44] but it's a it's a group effort and
[1:02:46] brother Paul is largely in part that
[1:02:49] that is the reason it sits in existence
[1:02:51] so I'm really really thankful for
[1:02:53] brother Paul in his
[1:02:55] his willingness to participate in that
[1:02:59] and give it freely of his time you know
[1:03:01] we don't we don't make any money off of
[1:03:02] it and he gives that but he volunteers
[1:03:05] his time for that so I'm very thankful
[1:03:06] for that
[1:03:06] and if you use that you should pat him
[1:03:08] on the back and say thank you so uh very
[1:03:11] thankful for that
[1:03:13] well let's get into the word that's what
[1:03:18] we're here for
[1:03:20] you know I was reading this passage of
[1:03:24] Scripture a while back and it really
[1:03:29] pressed upon my heart and I've spoken
[1:03:31] from this passage of Scripture before
[1:03:33] but maybe maybe we can look at it in a
[1:03:36] different light and I want to kind of go
[1:03:37] through three different topics
[1:03:42] throughout the weekend we'll see how the
[1:03:43] Lord leads but I want to start with this
[1:03:45] and I kind of want to bring us all on
[1:03:46] the same page and I kind of want to
[1:03:48] start from this scripture and he's
[1:03:52] saying this this has affected me very
[1:03:56] much so I was thinking about brother
[1:03:58] Adam on the way up and after I was
[1:04:00] reading this I was thinking about
[1:04:01] brother Adam and I can remember as a
[1:04:04] small child about eight years old
[1:04:08] seven somewhere along the lines of that
[1:04:10] we lived in Logan Ohio and it was it got
[1:04:14] pretty cold there but it was a January
[1:04:16] day and a member of the church there
[1:04:19] that my father had pastored had had a
[1:04:22] fire in the house and we had heard about
[1:04:27] it and then the family packed up the we
[1:04:30] packed up the van and we drove out to
[1:04:32] their house and I remember coming over
[1:04:34] there was a field behind their house and
[1:04:36] they had a beautiful just a regular home
[1:04:39] there not very big but a regular home
[1:04:40] and you kind of came up over a hill and
[1:04:43] then their house was there and then the
[1:04:44] field and we went over there quite often
[1:04:47] but then we went this one time they said
[1:04:48] they had a fire I didn't hear anything
[1:04:50] else about it but I remember just as a
[1:04:52] small child going up over the top of the
[1:04:54] hill and going and cresting the top of
[1:04:56] the hill and all you could see was the
[1:04:59] field the house was burned completely to
[1:05:02] the ground and there was there was
[1:05:04] nothing left in the house not one single
[1:05:07] possession that
[1:05:08] had was was left and I remember thinking
[1:05:11] as a small child this it I guess it just
[1:05:15] dawned on me for the first time you have
[1:05:18] that experience as a child but it just
[1:05:20] dawned on me for the first time that
[1:05:22] this life really isn't lasting because
[1:05:25] it's the first time I'd ever seen
[1:05:26] anything like that something someone's
[1:05:28] entire life just gone and this was the
[1:05:32] case for this family and they had to
[1:05:34] start from scratch there was nothing
[1:05:35] that they had left in the world there
[1:05:38] was nothing and they got out with their
[1:05:40] lives and that was it and I began to
[1:05:41] think about brother Adam and all that
[1:05:44] his family is going through and then I
[1:05:45] was thinking of this scripture and Paul
[1:05:48] says he Peter in his second letter here
[1:05:52] he's saying to them seeing that all
[1:05:55] these things are going to be dissolved
[1:05:58] anyways seeing that they're all going to
[1:06:01] be gone anyways and they're gonna the
[1:06:03] the earth itself is going to melt with
[1:06:05] fervent heat seeing that this is all the
[1:06:08] case then what what kind of a people
[1:06:12] ought we to be because he's saying this
[1:06:15] now to the people who are in the last
[1:06:17] days in the last days scoffers shall
[1:06:19] come and they shall be saying well
[1:06:21] where's the promise of his coming and
[1:06:22] then he says he goes on to say well
[1:06:24] seeing all these things are going to
[1:06:25] happen in the last days then what kind
[1:06:28] of people should we be he says what
[1:06:30] manner of people ought ye to be and he
[1:06:36] says and in if you look at it in the
[1:06:39] different versions it says that what
[1:06:43] manner of people are you to be in a holy
[1:06:47] conversation and godliness and what that
[1:06:49] means is what what kind of people should
[1:06:50] you be in a pattern of Christian living
[1:06:53] that sets you apart in your daily living
[1:06:56] so what kind of a daily pattern should
[1:06:58] you be what kind of a person should you
[1:07:00] be in in that time not just in church or
[1:07:04] around believers but what kind of a
[1:07:07] pattern should you set what should we be
[1:07:10] all of this is going to be dissolved all
[1:07:12] that we see is going to be gone so
[1:07:16] knowing that that all of this is going
[1:07:18] to happen what kind of people should we
[1:07:19] be brother Branham he says in 1950
[1:07:22] I know my Redeemer liveth he says see
[1:07:25] God has a purpose and he says he had
[1:07:28] everything working to that purpose and
[1:07:30] all today no matter how indifferently
[1:07:33] seemed to be at times and how strange
[1:07:36] things goes and how church gets in this
[1:07:39] condition and in that condition it's all
[1:07:42] in the divine prompt purpose of God to
[1:07:45] mold us and make us in his own way he
[1:07:49] says all of that we see no matter what
[1:07:52] the church gets into this condition or
[1:07:54] to that condition or which way you see
[1:07:56] the bride going or which way you see
[1:07:58] yourself going personally he says it's
[1:08:01] all working according to the purpose the
[1:08:04] divine purpose of God God has a purpose
[1:08:07] in all of this we see it in in Jeremiah
[1:08:09] 29:11 he has a plan to prosper you and
[1:08:13] and he cares about you and he knows
[1:08:15] exactly where you're at he's got a
[1:08:17] purpose for you in 1965 for the random
[1:08:21] he says this rapture which is coming to
[1:08:23] pass and anything that God has in in in
[1:08:25] the line of his word there's always
[1:08:28] something going to come and upset that
[1:08:30] if they can and it's Satan's purpose to
[1:08:33] do that you see God has a purpose for
[1:08:36] your life and we hear that well often
[1:08:38] but then we also know that Satan has a
[1:08:40] purpose and his purpose is to thwart the
[1:08:43] plan of God
[1:08:44] so as the plan of God is working in
[1:08:47] perfect coherence with His Word and
[1:08:48] perfect coherence with his thoughts that
[1:08:50] were in the beginning
[1:08:51] Satan is right there to try to disrupt
[1:08:53] that any way that he can and we know
[1:08:56] that in the last state he'll do that in
[1:08:58] ways that are so close to the elect that
[1:09:01] it we are so close to the truth that it
[1:09:03] would deceive the elect if possible so
[1:09:06] we have the overarching plan of God and
[1:09:08] purpose of God that is not working out
[1:09:10] just for the bride itself but it's
[1:09:12] working out in your life as well and you
[1:09:15] have to believe that but you also have
[1:09:17] to believe and you cannot discount that
[1:09:19] Satan has a purpose as well to thwart
[1:09:22] that purpose of God
[1:09:24] so he's working in tandem and he's a
[1:09:27] step behind the purpose of God in your
[1:09:29] life and you have to believe those two
[1:09:31] things the objective for the believer is
[1:09:36] is not so much to understand in in place
[1:09:41] the details of God's purpose as it is to
[1:09:45] surrender to the leading of the Holy
[1:09:46] Spirit to work out his purpose within
[1:09:49] your life it's not so much for us to be
[1:09:51] able to grasp the doctrine and to
[1:09:53] understand it and to place it ourselves
[1:09:55] as it is for us to surrender to the Holy
[1:09:58] Spirit so that he can place it according
[1:10:01] to his purpose and plan when we get it
[1:10:03] the other way around we mess ourselves
[1:10:05] up and we mess everything else and we
[1:10:07] allow Satan an avenue to get in there
[1:10:09] and to work his purpose in your life you
[1:10:12] have to understand it's not your ability
[1:10:14] to place it and to to line everything up
[1:10:17] even doctrinally or figure everything
[1:10:19] out in your life you're not always going
[1:10:21] to be able to do that it is more
[1:10:23] important that you surrender to the
[1:10:24] leading of the Holy Spirit because sons
[1:10:27] and daughters are led by the Spirit of
[1:10:28] God so we have to surrender to that and
[1:10:32] allow the purpose of God to work in our
[1:10:34] lives rather than try to figure out and
[1:10:36] place everything that is going to happen
[1:10:38] both doctrinally and personally it's
[1:10:41] just going to get you in heap of trouble
[1:10:42] I think it would be good then for us to
[1:10:46] go just just as we start out this series
[1:10:49] of beatings I think it would be good to
[1:10:50] go all the way back to the beginning and
[1:10:52] just kind of lay things out though so
[1:10:54] that we can see our place in God's
[1:10:56] purpose because we have a ministry that
[1:11:00] has allowed us to step back from it all
[1:11:03] and to see it laid out so we don't have
[1:11:06] to place it anymore we have to just
[1:11:09] surrender to the leading of the Holy
[1:11:10] Spirit and as we step back from from the
[1:11:13] whole span of time that we have we can
[1:11:16] see the Holy Spirit placing things in
[1:11:17] order so that we can see our place in
[1:11:19] the span of time so that we can see who
[1:11:22] we are in Christ and what he was doing
[1:11:25] from the very start to the very finish
[1:11:26] and when we when we better understand
[1:11:30] what God is doing through that way
[1:11:33] through the leading of the Holy Spirit
[1:11:34] and by revelation in him
[1:11:36] placing us into that by by his
[1:11:38] revelation to us rather than trying to
[1:11:40] figure it out then we can better grasp
[1:11:44] what we are to do in the present so when
[1:11:47] we when we understand the the the span
[1:11:49] of time as a whole according to the
[1:11:51] revelation of that God has given us then
[1:11:53] we can better place ourselves in the
[1:11:55] present moment isn't that right it gives
[1:11:59] us the ability when we when we
[1:12:01] understand the larger pictures by
[1:12:03] submitting ourselves to the Holy Spirit
[1:12:05] then it gives us the ability to more
[1:12:09] clearly grasp the present and to more
[1:12:11] clearly live it with a delivered with
[1:12:14] abandon and to live it with a courage
[1:12:17] and to live it with a fearless
[1:12:19] determination that God's purpose will
[1:12:21] take take precedence in our life because
[1:12:24] God has a purpose but Satan also has a
[1:12:26] purpose so far greater is it for us just
[1:12:29] to surrender to his leading so that he
[1:12:31] can place us into his purpose and allow
[1:12:33] us to see it from start to finish in the
[1:12:37] very beginning of time now I believe I
[1:12:39] read this exact same quote the last time
[1:12:41] I was here but I'll read it again
[1:12:42] because it's great 1963 in crisis and
[1:12:46] mystery of God revealed one of my
[1:12:48] favorite services and I find myself
[1:12:51] going back to it and I I don't even I I
[1:12:57] find myself coming back to John chapter
[1:13:00] 1 and crisis and mystery of God revealed
[1:13:03] and I kind of wish part of me could just
[1:13:05] get beyond that but I can't it just keep
[1:13:06] I keep going back to it and I think well
[1:13:09] rapture out of here before I get out of
[1:13:11] it but in 1963 he says this which which
[1:13:16] has which blew my mind the first time I
[1:13:18] heard it and it continues to do so God's
[1:13:21] plan he says it was first to express
[1:13:25] himself completely God in Christ second
[1:13:29] to have the preeminence by this in his
[1:13:32] church which is his body the bride till
[1:13:36] he could have the preeminence to express
[1:13:38] himself through them all right and
[1:13:41] thirdly to restore the kingdom to it's
[1:13:44] rightly position
[1:13:46] it fell by sin in the first Adam back to
[1:13:49] where he walked in the cool of the
[1:13:50] evening with his people and talked with
[1:13:52] them and fellowship with him in the very
[1:13:58] beginning there was God there was God it
[1:14:04] was just him and then his brother
[1:14:06] branham explains it in the in the co D
[1:14:08] book and a couple other places he says
[1:14:09] out of that came the Sun there was a
[1:14:14] little halo of light a little a little
[1:14:16] light and it came out in in John 1:18 it
[1:14:20] says and in Christ was Jesus was in the
[1:14:23] bosom of the Father it came from God
[1:14:26] everything that was in God was poured
[1:14:29] into the son and everything that that
[1:14:31] was was in God's mind everything that
[1:14:35] God was he pulled it from his very own
[1:14:37] heart that is why Christ is the heart of
[1:14:39] God is because he pulled it from his
[1:14:42] very own bosom and that became Christ
[1:14:44] that became the Godhead and it pleased
[1:14:46] the father that in him should all the
[1:14:48] fullness dwell so everything that God
[1:14:51] was was now in Christ we know that to be
[1:14:53] very true I doubt I'll say anything that
[1:14:55] you haven't heard before but like Peter
[1:14:57] says I bring you into remembrance of
[1:14:59] these things so I'm just gonna preach
[1:15:00] what's on my heart everything that God
[1:15:03] was was then poured into him Christ and
[1:15:08] everything that he everything that that
[1:15:11] that was and that is was brought into
[1:15:14] existence by him all things were created
[1:15:18] by him and for him and it was not God at
[1:15:21] the beginning it was Christ that God
[1:15:23] poured himself into and everything that
[1:15:27] God was it came down and it was that
[1:15:32] that brooded over the face of the earth
[1:15:34] which was just a void so the spoken word
[1:15:37] was the original seed and he spoke
[1:15:38] something and it came to existence
[1:15:40] everything that we see everything that
[1:15:42] was was brought into existence by him
[1:15:46] it was nothing less so as the the the
[1:15:51] the the world was there in in in all of
[1:15:54] its void the scripture says in Isaiah 55
[1:15:57] my words shall not return unto me void
[1:15:59] without having something in it without
[1:16:02] having accomplished what it was set out
[1:16:04] to accomplish so the word was there in
[1:16:07] the beginning because God was the word
[1:16:09] and the Word was God so he was there in
[1:16:13] the beginning and then the the earth was
[1:16:16] there with all of the potential in it to
[1:16:20] bring out the seeds of the oak trees and
[1:16:23] the pine trees and everything that was
[1:16:24] inside of it it was laying there
[1:16:26] with the potential to produce all of
[1:16:29] that and it was the Holy Spirit that
[1:16:31] came down and brooded over the face of
[1:16:34] the earth
[1:16:34] it was the same Christ that God poured
[1:16:37] himself into everything that was in that
[1:16:39] net debt brought forth life was because
[1:16:42] Christ came down and brooded over top of
[1:16:44] it and the life came out of it it had to
[1:16:47] lay in the presence of the Sun in order
[1:16:50] for it to bring out its potential it's
[1:16:54] the exact same way at the beginning as
[1:16:56] it is right now it's the exact same God
[1:16:59] and he came down and he brooded over the
[1:17:01] face of the earth and he created
[1:17:03] everything that was now everything that
[1:17:05] he created was for him because the earth
[1:17:09] was the Lord's footstool now at that
[1:17:12] time in the very beginning after there
[1:17:14] was there was nothing but just him in
[1:17:17] all of his existence he poured himself
[1:17:19] into Christ and then everything that we
[1:17:21] see everything that was on the earth was
[1:17:23] brought into existence by the person of
[1:17:26] the Lord Jesus Christ and he brooded
[1:17:28] over that any product into existence for
[1:17:29] himself and then as we go down through
[1:17:32] the days of creation we see that he he
[1:17:34] had the plants and the animals and
[1:17:36] everything that was and he molded them
[1:17:38] and shape them into existence and then
[1:17:39] he created man and he built man and
[1:17:42] formed man in his own image and at that
[1:17:45] point in time it was it was in the mind
[1:17:49] of God now if we could look at this it
[1:17:53] says and just for the sake of time
[1:18:01] I'll read it he says in 1965 in Satan's
[1:18:06] Eden now that's the way God was in the
[1:18:09] beginning every son of God and every
[1:18:10] daughter of God was in God at the
[1:18:13] beginning you don't remember it now but
[1:18:16] you were there he noted and he wanted
[1:18:20] you to become so he could contact you
[1:18:23] speak with you love you and shake your
[1:18:26] hands so he says you are with God at the
[1:18:29] beginning so he created man and if you
[1:18:32] go back in Genesis and uh if you look at
[1:18:36] it he created man in his own image
[1:18:39] created hehe male and female and then he
[1:18:43] creates Adam so he had the the spirit
[1:18:46] the theophany and he had that that image
[1:18:48] of you before before the foundation of
[1:18:51] the world and then he creates Adam
[1:18:53] specifically out of the dust of the
[1:18:56] earth so he creates mankind and that's
[1:18:59] when you were in God at the very
[1:19:01] beginning you were with him before the
[1:19:03] foundation of the world and you were in
[1:19:05] God's mind then you have to believe that
[1:19:09] because he says you don't remember it
[1:19:11] so you're believing something that you
[1:19:13] don't remember so what you're doing is
[1:19:16] you're walking on water as many times
[1:19:20] where you say oh well we've got to come
[1:19:22] out you've got a step out in faith
[1:19:23] you're already stepped out in faith your
[1:19:27] ass your your way of what you're looking
[1:19:30] back at the boat is what you're doing
[1:19:32] you're already on the water because of
[1:19:35] what you believe and where you stand in
[1:19:37] your faith against culture and
[1:19:39] everything that you are you you have
[1:19:41] been walking on water since your
[1:19:44] ascending oh there goes so don't think
[1:19:47] for a minute that you have to step out
[1:19:48] on to the water you're on the water you
[1:19:51] just have to keep your eyes on Christ he
[1:19:55] says you were there with him before the
[1:19:57] foundation of the world even though you
[1:19:59] don't remember it you need to believe it
[1:20:02] whether or not you remember it or not
[1:20:03] that's where you were in Christ and then
[1:20:05] he creates Adam and we know that Adam
[1:20:08] manot male and female everything that
[1:20:11] the woman was and that the man was was
[1:20:13] in in one in the same so it wasn't two
[1:20:15] separate beings it was one male and
[1:20:18] female in one being Adam so he created
[1:20:21] him in his own image now what he did is
[1:20:25] that he realized that that man was alone
[1:20:27] and he says what I'm gonna do is he
[1:20:29] needs fellowship because he was created
[1:20:31] in God's image so the reason that God
[1:20:33] created heaven was because he wanted to
[1:20:37] fellowship with Adam Adam needed
[1:20:39] fellowship because he was created in
[1:20:41] God's image so he pulled from Adam of a
[1:20:44] rib and he created Eve and so the two
[1:20:47] had fellowship now what was created then
[1:20:51] was perfect it was heaven if you were to
[1:20:56] ask every single person in this room
[1:20:58] what is heaven like to you you'd
[1:21:00] probably each one of you have a
[1:21:01] different image you'd have a different
[1:21:03] idea of what heaven is whether on this
[1:21:05] earth or something out of this earth you
[1:21:09] you have some kind of an idea some of
[1:21:10] you have a beach some of you have
[1:21:12] Florida some of you have the beach with
[1:21:15] Newfoundland you know kind of a half and
[1:21:17] a half between Florida and and
[1:21:18] Newfoundland which actually turns out to
[1:21:20] be North Carolina but you have some sort
[1:21:23] of an idea of what heaven is everybody
[1:21:26] has that you have a different theory or
[1:21:28] a different thought of what heaven is
[1:21:30] this was heaven God created heaven and
[1:21:34] he came down and he brooded over the
[1:21:37] face of the deep and everything that was
[1:21:39] in heaven came up because of him it was
[1:21:42] the Lord's footstool it was the Lord's
[1:21:44] Dominion and that was not a million
[1:21:47] miles off somewhere that was on this
[1:21:49] earth it was here and so many times we
[1:21:53] forget that fact heaven was right here
[1:21:55] it wasn't a million miles away it wasn't
[1:21:58] on some other earth
[1:21:59] it wasn't on earth two or three it was
[1:22:01] on this earth it was heaven it was
[1:22:04] harmony and God could come down and
[1:22:07] commune with his people and have
[1:22:08] fellowship with him like he intended it
[1:22:10] to be before the foundation of the world
[1:22:13] that is what he wanted with you that is
[1:22:16] what he wanted with Adam and Eve and
[1:22:17] that's what he had
[1:22:19] it was perfect Communion and fellowship
[1:22:21] and relationship with them you cannot
[1:22:25] have a fellowship with someone until you
[1:22:28] have a relationship with them fellowship
[1:22:31] is a sharing of interests and a sharing
[1:22:33] of activity and things like that
[1:22:35] relationship is a share shared knowledge
[1:22:37] and shared interaction so I can't
[1:22:40] fellowship with you until first I get to
[1:22:43] know you I know your name I shake your
[1:22:45] hand I say hallo brother how are you
[1:22:46] doing and then we begin to talk then we
[1:22:49] can go and have an experience together
[1:22:50] then we can go fishing or go hunting or
[1:22:52] something like that and be in fellowship
[1:22:53] it's the exact same way with God you
[1:22:56] can't be in fellowship with him until
[1:22:58] first you have a relationship with him
[1:22:59] Adam and Eve were brought into
[1:23:01] relationship with them and they were in
[1:23:03] fellowship with him this was this was
[1:23:06] perfect
[1:23:07] this was everything that God wanted it
[1:23:09] to be he could he could come down and he
[1:23:14] could sit on top of the Himalayas and
[1:23:19] look down over the valleys and say how
[1:23:21] beautiful this is he could I could you
[1:23:24] know fly across the American Plains and
[1:23:26] say how beautiful this is
[1:23:27] this was God's Dominion the presence of
[1:23:30] God consumed this earth that we are now
[1:23:33] standing on it's the exact same one we
[1:23:36] have this figment of our imagination out
[1:23:38] there as it was somewhere out there it
[1:23:40] was right here
[1:23:41] this was God's Dominion it was his place
[1:23:44] of fellowship it was his place of
[1:23:46] communion
[1:23:48] it was his it was his footstool brother
[1:23:52] Branham he says in 1965 in Satan's Eden
[1:23:55] God at one time had the earth under his
[1:23:58] control he says he set it into its orbit
[1:24:01] he put it out and then there just
[1:24:03] skipping down he says finally when he
[1:24:05] got it all made and finally arrived
[1:24:07] he put his headquarters on earth in a
[1:24:10] beautiful spot laying East of Eden
[1:24:11] called the Garden of Eden and God made
[1:24:14] the world's headquarters in the Garden
[1:24:17] of Eden in Egypt right east of the
[1:24:19] garden was the headquarters and over the
[1:24:20] whole situation
[1:24:22] he put his son and his son's wife over
[1:24:25] all of it that's right and what and
[1:24:27] that's what God did he put them in full
[1:24:28] control so he says Adam you have the do
[1:24:32] over all of the earth he says this is my
[1:24:35] this is my place and I give it to you
[1:24:39] everything that we think about of heaven
[1:24:41] of it being in harmony and unity and and
[1:24:44] the beauty of it and the majesty of it
[1:24:46] and then just just that relaxing feeling
[1:24:49] that we get when we think about heaven
[1:24:51] that's what it was and it was all right
[1:24:54] here everything that was so beautiful
[1:24:57] about God was right here in order to
[1:25:06] express himself he expressed himself
[1:25:09] first in Christ so that he could have
[1:25:12] complete preeminence in the being of the
[1:25:14] Lord Jesus Christ and then secondly was
[1:25:21] to express himself through Christ in you
[1:25:24] and he had that he had expressed himself
[1:25:27] through Christ because man was was was
[1:25:30] in dominion over his heaven over his
[1:25:33] creation everything was there it was a
[1:25:36] beautiful place but the scripture also
[1:25:39] says in Isaiah 14 and 12 how art thou o
[1:25:42] Lucifer who aren't fallen from heaven so
[1:25:46] there was God but there was also Satan
[1:25:49] there was God in all of his majesty
[1:25:52] but then there was also Satan and Satan
[1:25:55] was set below God but he had all of the
[1:25:57] the beauty and the qualities that God
[1:25:59] had given him and he fell and there was
[1:26:01] a we know from revelations 12 which is
[1:26:04] actually a very controversial chapter of
[1:26:06] the Bible but Satan fell from heaven and
[1:26:14] we know that in Psalms 115 is 16 it says
[1:26:18] that the heaven even the heavens are the
[1:26:20] Lord's but the earth he has given unto
[1:26:22] the children of men the earth and all of
[1:26:26] that it was and all of its beauty and
[1:26:28] all of its Majesty was in God's control
[1:26:31] he gave it to the Dominion of mankind
[1:26:33] and because mankind wanted to go their
[1:26:36] own way they forfeited it to Satan so
[1:26:41] because of the fall because of the the
[1:26:44] sexual act in the Garden of Eden
[1:26:46] man forfeited it to Satan so because and
[1:26:52] and this is the way it's been ever ever
[1:26:53] since it was the way it was in Israel
[1:26:55] it's the way it is to now it's the way
[1:26:57] it is in the hearts of of mankind all
[1:26:59] across the earth 1952 in God's way that
[1:27:02] God that's that's been me God's Way
[1:27:05] that's been made for us he says man has
[1:27:07] always wanted to make his own way in the
[1:27:10] Garden of Eden God made man so he didn't
[1:27:12] have to shift for nothing God made him
[1:27:14] perfect but man wanted his own way he
[1:27:17] wanted to tamper and he wanted to find
[1:27:20] out and as soon as he fell we've we've
[1:27:23] went through that this week and he's
[1:27:24] going through the different things in
[1:27:25] the scripture he made himself a religion
[1:27:27] and he didn't wait for God to take him
[1:27:30] to make him one he made himself one God
[1:27:35] and when we say this often that God
[1:27:37] we're against the system we're not
[1:27:39] against the people but God God is is is
[1:27:43] the the designer of the most intricate
[1:27:45] and delicate systems that mankind will
[1:27:48] ever see or ever experienced if you just
[1:27:52] take the human body alone but you take
[1:27:54] nature you take the oceans you take the
[1:27:57] the Stars and everything else and you
[1:27:59] look at the intricacy of the design and
[1:28:02] the system that it goes through and even
[1:28:04] just the body of the human body on a
[1:28:06] daily basis in the sleep cycle and
[1:28:08] everything that it goes through it's
[1:28:10] it's an astley intricate system God is
[1:28:13] the designer of the most amazing systems
[1:28:15] you could possibly imagine it's when man
[1:28:18] makes his own system to put God into
[1:28:20] that's when we have the trouble and we
[1:28:22] know that to be the truth but what we
[1:28:24] need to do then is by surrendering to
[1:28:26] the Holy Spirit because the sons and
[1:28:28] daughters of God are led by the Spirit
[1:28:30] we surrender ourselves to God's system
[1:28:33] and that system works itself out
[1:28:35] according to his own word so when we
[1:28:37] surrender ourselves to the Holy Spirit
[1:28:39] we allow the Holy Spirit and the Word of
[1:28:41] God which is the seed we allow the Holy
[1:28:43] Spirit which is the water to water the
[1:28:45] seed and it brings out the system of God
[1:28:47] because there's life in the seed and it
[1:28:50] can't help anything but just give forth
[1:28:52] life
[1:28:53] sister Sarah and I keep a garden because
[1:28:55] we have 25 degree weather down there and
[1:28:58] we keep a garden and I love to garden I
[1:29:00] absolutely love it
[1:29:01] my grandfather was a gardener my noble
[1:29:03] uncle was a gardener a man of the soil
[1:29:05] and I just I loved to garden so III
[1:29:10] sister Sarah and I were you know hoeing
[1:29:13] the rows and everything like that and in
[1:29:14] laying our seed just as humble folk that
[1:29:17] we are and it just astounds me and in
[1:29:23] sister amber or sister Kim had done the
[1:29:25] the tomato seedlings and the in brother
[1:29:28] Matt sister Amber's kids had their
[1:29:29] seedlings in they're very healthy plants
[1:29:32] very fruitful plants and they were
[1:29:35] growing up in the little seedlings there
[1:29:36] and it just astounds me that you can and
[1:29:41] I didn't tell my wife this but I
[1:29:42] actually we had about ten seedlings
[1:29:45] there have one kind of a plant and I
[1:29:47] actually dug one up every two weeks or
[1:29:49] every two days and I looked at the seed
[1:29:52] to see if what when what shape it was
[1:29:54] just because I wanted to see so I dug it
[1:29:56] up and it's amazing how you water the
[1:29:58] seed and then you you you look at it and
[1:30:00] it's just bringing forth life out of
[1:30:02] nowhere and and all of a sudden now
[1:30:05] there's a large chute out of the ground
[1:30:07] out of nothing out of thin air
[1:30:09] it's a beautiful plant and it goes up to
[1:30:11] be a beautiful squash plant or tomato
[1:30:13] plant or whatever it is it's amazing to
[1:30:15] me there's a system and an underlying
[1:30:17] law to that Jesus rose because he
[1:30:21] submitted himself to his own law there
[1:30:24] was a law of nature there's a law of the
[1:30:26] earth there's some other law that that
[1:30:29] that coordinates everything that happens
[1:30:31] to us there's God's law and and God did
[1:30:34] not come to diminish the law he came to
[1:30:37] fulfill the law so when we have when
[1:30:39] when we subject ourselves to the law of
[1:30:41] God which the holy spirit operates then
[1:30:44] we bring forth the same life that was on
[1:30:46] the inside of us if that seed is inside
[1:30:49] of us it's as simple as that you
[1:30:50] committed to the right atmosphere that's
[1:30:53] what God brings forth out of it it's the
[1:30:56] light that was on the inside of the seed
[1:30:58] and that's what God was doing in the
[1:31:00] beginning was creating the atmosphere
[1:31:02] that that man
[1:31:03] exist in then they began to use their
[1:31:06] own intellectual reasoning and begin to
[1:31:08] just a debate on the basis of the word
[1:31:11] and Satan deceived and we know all of
[1:31:14] the aspects of that and Men forfeited it
[1:31:16] right there they subjected themselves to
[1:31:19] their own law instead of the law of God
[1:31:21] if they would have kept it on Christ
[1:31:25] would have been there and in Christ was
[1:31:28] the life of them that was on the inside
[1:31:29] of them as the tree of life in the
[1:31:31] Garden of Eden and yet they forfeited it
[1:31:34] because they wanted to go their own way
[1:31:35] that was the worst mistake that Israel
[1:31:37] ever made is because they chose to go
[1:31:39] their own way instead of submitting
[1:31:41] themselves to the law of God if the same
[1:31:46] spirit that raised Jesus from the dead
[1:31:49] dwells in you it shall also quicken your
[1:31:51] mortal body and that is not something
[1:31:53] that is going to happen because we are
[1:31:55] going to be resurrected
[1:31:57] we are quickened now so as that spirit
[1:32:00] that dwells inside of you it quickens
[1:32:02] your mortal body and it brings you to a
[1:32:04] place where you are in heavenly places
[1:32:06] in Christ Jesus right now as you stand
[1:32:08] and all of the promises of God are there
[1:32:12] for you to have and to to grab hold of
[1:32:14] as a carrier of God Himself because the
[1:32:18] same spirit that raised Jesus Christ
[1:32:20] from the dead it shall and it has
[1:32:22] quicken your mortal body you're baptized
[1:32:24] and born again with the Holy Ghost you
[1:32:26] will be resurrected you are quickened
[1:32:29] with him and you are sitting in heavenly
[1:32:31] places in Christ Jesus with them right
[1:32:32] now as you sit mankind wanted to go
[1:32:37] their own way as a result every siren
[1:32:41] that you've ever heard has been caused
[1:32:44] everything that you've ever heard
[1:32:47] uh-uh-uh-uh-uh and the news of a murder
[1:32:49] of of a kidnapping of all of these
[1:32:51] different things of all of the
[1:32:53] immorality of all of the filth of this
[1:32:55] world and everything that is in it is
[1:32:57] because man chose to go his own way it's
[1:33:02] all the result of men forfeiting the law
[1:33:05] of God and submitting himself had all
[1:33:07] his
[1:33:08] and choosing rather his own direction
[1:33:10] which is which is is perfectly capable
[1:33:13] of doing because we are creatures that
[1:33:16] have the ability to think because we are
[1:33:17] on the basis of free moral agency
[1:33:19] hopefully I'll get into that in in
[1:33:20] another sermon Satan's purpose remember
[1:33:25] God has a purpose and he has a law
[1:33:26] that's riding out all of these things
[1:33:28] but Satan has a purpose as well Satan's
[1:33:31] purpose from Eden was to make himself
[1:33:33] his own ledin and exalt himself above so
[1:33:37] the stars of God would worship Him the
[1:33:39] sons would worship Him and he has
[1:33:40] absolutely carried it out now and he's
[1:33:43] done this and brought it into the church
[1:33:45] because of the fall we live in in the
[1:33:49] midst of Satan's II mankind they
[1:33:53] forfeited God's Eden and the heaven that
[1:33:56] they were in existence in and all of
[1:33:58] these all of the things that they had
[1:34:00] and all the blessings that they
[1:34:01] experienced they forfeited that and now
[1:34:05] Satan took preeminence on the earth and
[1:34:08] it was no longer God's Dominion it was
[1:34:10] now Satan's Dominion so the Spirit of
[1:34:12] God literally it stepped back from the
[1:34:16] earth and it said this is no longer my
[1:34:18] Dominion it is still his footstool
[1:34:20] because the scripture says that the
[1:34:22] earth is the Lord's and it is his
[1:34:23] footstool and it is it is all his but he
[1:34:27] stepped back because man chose to go his
[1:34:29] own way and he allowed Satan an avenue
[1:34:32] to get into his mind because Eve is no
[1:34:34] less like like you and me she was no
[1:34:36] less like you and me she had five
[1:34:39] avenues to the spirit realm and it was
[1:34:41] that that that Satan got to and messed
[1:34:43] with and caused the fall it's the exact
[1:34:46] same thing with you and me and so Satan
[1:34:48] because God lifted off of the earth and
[1:34:51] said this is no longer my Dominion Satan
[1:34:54] moved in there and grabbed a hold of it
[1:34:56] so then it became Satan's Dominion it
[1:34:59] was no longer gods it was no longer
[1:35:01] heaven heaven and earth were completely
[1:35:03] and horrendously ripped apart because
[1:35:08] before all of that heaven and earth were
[1:35:11] one in the same it was from the
[1:35:14] beginning it says that God created a
[1:35:16] harmony and everything that was was in
[1:35:18] existence
[1:35:19] perfect unity and harmony with God man
[1:35:22] with in fellowship with him
[1:35:23] it was heaven and earth back like a same
[1:35:26] there was no heaven up there and earth
[1:35:28] down there there was no difference in
[1:35:30] dimension Dominion necessarily it was it
[1:35:33] was God himself and it was the earth and
[1:35:35] it was it was the Lord's Dominion
[1:35:37] it was everything in one just like God
[1:35:39] wanted it to be and then swim man
[1:35:42] forfeited that by using their own
[1:35:45] intellect and by using their own
[1:35:46] reasoning and everything like that not
[1:35:48] that we shouldn't use your own reasoning
[1:35:50] in our own intellect we bring it to God
[1:35:52] as it says in Isaiah let us come
[1:35:54] together and reason together you bring
[1:35:57] all the intellect and wit that you have
[1:35:58] to to believe in him there's so many
[1:36:00] people who say well you're blindly
[1:36:03] believing in faith no we're not belong
[1:36:06] to believing I know exactly what I'm
[1:36:08] believing in and I have more certainty
[1:36:10] of that than I do of this and I have
[1:36:12] faith in that and that's how I have
[1:36:14] faith in the in the unfailing realities
[1:36:17] of God which is a greater reality than
[1:36:19] what I have because this will fade away
[1:36:21] that will not so I'd rather put my faith
[1:36:25] in something that I am certain of that
[1:36:27] lifts me from from what I can see to
[1:36:30] what I am in living by faith and when we
[1:36:33] do that we lift off of the present world
[1:36:35] and the present troubles and we leave it
[1:36:37] all behind because we're in heavenly
[1:36:39] places in Christ Jesus we are putting
[1:36:41] ourselves by faith into the Lord Jesus
[1:36:44] Christ himself so you lift above all of
[1:36:46] the things in and then you're not any
[1:36:48] longer walking by what you see you're
[1:36:50] walking by faith we do not walk by
[1:36:53] things that are seen but we walk by the
[1:36:54] unseen and when a man of forfeited that
[1:37:00] heaven and earth were just ripped apart
[1:37:03] and now it was no longer heaven on earth
[1:37:06] it was Satan's Eden it was Satan's
[1:37:09] Dominion and he moved down into the
[1:37:11] hearts of men and he caused
[1:37:14] Cain to kill Abel and he caused all of
[1:37:17] these different things
[1:37:19] it was Satan's Dominion that has not
[1:37:22] changed since that time we are still
[1:37:26] living in the midst of Satan's Eden
[1:37:29] we're still here it's this earth
[1:37:32] now all that we see in all that time has
[1:37:35] allowed us to create we have created for
[1:37:37] ourselves so we look at ourselves in
[1:37:39] this existence we walk by and the vast
[1:37:42] majority of the world walks by the scene
[1:37:44] what they can see with their senses but
[1:37:47] God did not give man the senses to
[1:37:50] contact God with he gave them faith to
[1:37:53] contact God with and so many times
[1:37:55] especially with young people they get
[1:37:57] that mixed up and they try to contact
[1:37:59] God with their fleshly senses with the
[1:38:01] five senses and then when they try to do
[1:38:04] that they can't reach God they create
[1:38:06] their own religion which is what Saint
[1:38:08] wanted to do back in the very beginning
[1:38:10] so with the senses we try to reach out
[1:38:12] to God because it's in us to worship a
[1:38:15] God because that's what we were created
[1:38:17] to do we were created for fellowship so
[1:38:20] we try to create something and we we
[1:38:22] conjure up sign of a vegetable offering
[1:38:25] to offer him and to give to him and that
[1:38:28] is what what is innately India in us to
[1:38:30] do but that was not the way God intended
[1:38:32] it to be that's why he gave us faith to
[1:38:35] contact the heavenly realm but we are in
[1:38:39] the midst of Satan's eating and now here
[1:38:41] we are according to the scripture that
[1:38:42] we can see in Laodicea so what what
[1:38:46] happened now is that God wanted to have
[1:38:48] fellowship and we see from Christ as a
[1:38:50] mystery of God revealed the three
[1:38:52] purpose of God isn't it wonderful to say
[1:38:54] yeah there's three and three things that
[1:38:56] God had in his purpose you think of the
[1:38:58] complexity of the scripture it's so
[1:39:00] simple
[1:39:01] God is not simple God is the most
[1:39:04] complex thing you'll ever even
[1:39:05] comprehend and you'll never be able to
[1:39:07] fully comprehend him he's complex he's
[1:39:11] not simple at all he wraps himself in
[1:39:14] simplicity and he reveals himself in a
[1:39:18] it's so beautiful to me we try to make
[1:39:21] it so complex the worst thing that you
[1:39:23] can do is make it complex it's so simple
[1:39:26] to me so everything that that that that
[1:39:31] was was ripped apart there was no way
[1:39:35] for man to get back into fellowship
[1:39:37] because the law was set in place because
[1:39:39] there was a law that God had he wanted
[1:39:42] to see the blood and it was my
[1:39:43] revelation now man couldn't could
[1:39:45] not have received the revelation of that
[1:39:49] by their own ability God had to give it
[1:39:52] to them so Abraham Moses all of the men
[1:39:55] from that time until Jesus came every
[1:39:58] man had to have a revelation directly
[1:40:00] from God
[1:40:01] God had to tell them this is what I want
[1:40:03] you to do you must do it or else you
[1:40:05] will forfeit your your covenant with you
[1:40:07] in order to receive the Covenant you've
[1:40:10] got to into a circumcise you've got to
[1:40:13] do this in order to have this there was
[1:40:15] always something there was a condition
[1:40:16] there that had to be met because that's
[1:40:18] the way God works he says you've got to
[1:40:21] do this there's a consequence to this
[1:40:23] you know I've put you on the basis of
[1:40:25] free more agency but there's a
[1:40:27] consequence to choosing wrong and we
[1:40:30] reap the consequences of our decisions
[1:40:31] so there was no way for a man to get
[1:40:34] back to God because it was it was
[1:40:38] forfeited for us to get back into that
[1:40:41] fellowship now we could have a
[1:40:43] relationship with him and we Moses
[1:40:46] himself was called the friend of God God
[1:40:48] came down and communed with him and was
[1:40:50] there with him and the presence of God
[1:40:52] was it amazes me the presence of God
[1:40:57] Himself was down on the mountain it was
[1:41:00] the presence of God was on that mountain
[1:41:02] and then people they couldn't even look
[1:41:05] at the mountain it was so strong and
[1:41:07] they said Moses you talked to God
[1:41:08] because we did we can't even look at the
[1:41:10] mountain they would die if any animal
[1:41:12] touch the mountain they died and in law
[1:41:14] and Moses walked right up into the midst
[1:41:16] of it he walked right into the raw power
[1:41:19] of Almighty God that was on that
[1:41:21] mountain
[1:41:23] he had he had a relationship with God
[1:41:26] but there was no way for them to come
[1:41:28] back into complete fellowship with God
[1:41:30] because they forfeited it so the blood
[1:41:33] of bulls and goats go it would bring a
[1:41:35] recompense of sin they could not afford
[1:41:38] fit that they could not shake that it
[1:41:39] was just it was - it's just not able to
[1:41:41] be done
[1:41:51] in the Old Testament we see that the
[1:41:56] Lord established from the first Bible
[1:41:59] the heavens he established the temple
[1:42:02] the temple changed everything because
[1:42:05] there was no way for God to commune with
[1:42:08] his people and for his people to come
[1:42:10] and commune with him unless they sit
[1:42:12] unless he specifically came down to them
[1:42:14] and said you do this and you'll you'll
[1:42:16] reap this so he came to Abraham and he
[1:42:18] says you get you and your family and
[1:42:20] these people and you do this and you're
[1:42:22] circumcised and I'll come down to you
[1:42:24] and you'll have an everlasting covenant
[1:42:25] with me and to your seed your spiritual
[1:42:27] seed when the temple came God told Moses
[1:42:31] to place the temple in the place all of
[1:42:32] the ordinances and you want to talk
[1:42:34] about a system there was no system like
[1:42:37] the temple everything had to be in
[1:42:39] perfect order everything had to be
[1:42:40] placed exactly like God wanted it the
[1:42:43] the the the priest had to wear this
[1:42:45] particular garment he couldn't wear this
[1:42:47] you couldn't touch that he couldn't do
[1:42:48] this he couldn't say that he had to have
[1:42:50] this type of blood this kind of animal
[1:42:52] it was it was crazy
[1:42:53] can you imagine worshipping like that
[1:42:56] but he allowed this in order for the the
[1:43:01] offering that he required to be met I'm
[1:43:04] trying to make it as simple as possible
[1:43:06] now because this can get really complex
[1:43:10] he set in order a way for man to commune
[1:43:15] with him so he set the way for the blood
[1:43:19] to be paid so that the man could stand
[1:43:22] atone for his sin because man had
[1:43:25] forfeited at the garner vini
[1:43:28] and God had only allowed certain people
[1:43:30] that he revealed to to receive that
[1:43:32] blessing of the Covenant and to come
[1:43:34] back into that relationship he sent
[1:43:37] forth the order and the in the way of
[1:43:39] the temple so that man could come back
[1:43:42] into fellowship with him because when
[1:43:45] you brought your offering and when you
[1:43:47] went through the process that the temple
[1:43:49] had in the wilderness then you were then
[1:43:52] back in communion with God because you
[1:43:54] were brought back into a fellowship that
[1:43:56] was on the basis of the blood of the
[1:43:58] of the lamb and and the the doves and
[1:44:01] all of the things that you sacrificed
[1:44:02] you were fellowshipping with God through
[1:44:04] the temple so now they were atone for
[1:44:07] their sin for their healing they were
[1:44:09] redeemed by their per their practice of
[1:44:13] faith in the temple I doubt there was
[1:44:15] anybody or I'm sure there were but the
[1:44:17] the process of the temple had to be done
[1:44:20] by faith it was not something that you
[1:44:22] could just do and just get by with it
[1:44:24] God still looked on the heart of man
[1:44:26] Samuel said that even before there was
[1:44:28] the what there was he says
[1:44:30] God looks on the heart of man and you're
[1:44:32] looking on the countenance of it God
[1:44:34] still looked on the heart of a man back
[1:44:37] in that day so it was no less like it
[1:44:39] like it is now God still looks at your
[1:44:41] heart and he has always looked at the
[1:44:43] heart of man so God allowed by faith he
[1:44:46] allowed them to place their faith in the
[1:44:48] blood of that lamb and when they brought
[1:44:50] it and it was sacrificed then they were
[1:44:52] redeemed and they were brought into a
[1:44:54] fellowship with Christ through the
[1:44:56] process of the temple heaven and earth
[1:44:59] came back together again through the
[1:45:03] temple because now God could come down
[1:45:06] and commune from the Holy of Holies he
[1:45:09] could stand in there and the priests
[1:45:11] could come in and put the blood and then
[1:45:13] on the day of atonement and the whole
[1:45:14] camp was atone for their sin and for
[1:45:16] their healing
[1:45:18] so now heaven and earth were brought
[1:45:20] back together in the temple that was
[1:45:25] only a foreshadow of as we know Christ
[1:45:31] when Christ came heaven and earth came
[1:45:35] back together again because it was the
[1:45:39] fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:45:41] not now him having a relationship with
[1:45:44] his people
[1:45:44] it was now him inside of his people
[1:45:48] because Christ came down and the blood
[1:45:51] of Jesus Christ was shed and because of
[1:45:53] the cross everything that we had
[1:45:56] forfeited was now brought back together
[1:45:58] in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:46:00] now the amazing thing about this and
[1:46:02] this is what I want you to see in 1965
[1:46:05] it is the rising of the Sun the spirit
[1:46:07] left him in the Garden of Gethsemane he
[1:46:09] had to die a man
[1:46:11] friends he didn't have to do that that
[1:46:13] was God God anointed that flesh which
[1:46:16] was human flesh he allowed himself to be
[1:46:19] submitted to the law that was overriding
[1:46:22] him Jesus had the power he said in John
[1:46:25] 4 the Aaron McGarry said this at the
[1:46:26] men's meeting and this is amazing to me
[1:46:29] he says Jesus had the power to raise up
[1:46:31] and to put down yet
[1:46:33] he could have risen himself from the
[1:46:35] dead but he chose not to he chose to
[1:46:38] submit himself to the Holy Spirit and
[1:46:40] the word is what rose him from the dead
[1:46:42] because the word said I shall not allow
[1:46:45] my Holy One to see corruption so he
[1:46:47] didn't have to do anything the law that
[1:46:49] was overriding him that's what that's
[1:46:51] what rose him from the dead all he had
[1:46:54] to do was submit himself to the leading
[1:46:56] of the Holy Spirit which was inside of
[1:46:58] him even though he had the authority and
[1:47:00] the power to raise himself up and to put
[1:47:03] himself back down and to raise himself
[1:47:04] up again and yet he chose to surrender
[1:47:07] himself to the Father which was inside
[1:47:10] of him because all of the all that the
[1:47:12] father was was in Christ and Christ was
[1:47:15] made flesh and dwelt among us the word
[1:47:18] the logos everything that God was came
[1:47:21] back together in heaven and earth were
[1:47:24] overlapping now it's not heaven on earth
[1:47:26] again they overlapped in the form of
[1:47:29] Jesus Christ so it was not this is not
[1:47:33] heaven on earth this is not the
[1:47:34] Millennium this is not what we're
[1:47:36] experiencing like that
[1:47:37] this was just an overlapping of heaven
[1:47:40] and earth he says if he if he didn't if
[1:47:44] he de went up there as God he'd have
[1:47:48] never died that kind of a death
[1:47:49] you can't kill God but he didn't have to
[1:47:53] do it but remember he went there with
[1:47:55] you in him by listening to me he went
[1:47:59] there with you in him see he had never
[1:48:02] separated the bride from the groom he
[1:48:06] came down to people and he says this is
[1:48:09] what I want you to do and this is the
[1:48:10] Covenant that you must do to have
[1:48:11] fellowship with me through the temple
[1:48:13] they could offer their sacrifice and
[1:48:15] they could they could lay their faith in
[1:48:17] the blood of Jesus of the Lamb
[1:48:18] and then they would be atone for their
[1:48:20] sin that was their Redemption when Jesus
[1:48:22] Christ came he hadn't broke God had not
[1:48:25] broken himself up from groom and bride
[1:48:28] yet he was one in the same
[1:48:30] just like God created Adam in his own
[1:48:33] image he was male and female together
[1:48:35] when Jesus was on the cross he was male
[1:48:39] and female together because it was the
[1:48:41] fullness of the Godhead bodily so even
[1:48:44] though you were in the fray mind of God
[1:48:47] before the foundation of the world he
[1:48:50] went back into Christ was the Holy Ghost
[1:48:53] down through the ages Jehovah of the Old
[1:48:55] Testament Jesus of the new the Holy
[1:48:56] Ghost down throughout all of the ages so
[1:48:59] he was in Jesus Christ
[1:49:00] the person of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:49:02] there which is the beauty of the Godhead
[1:49:05] he was Jesus Christ the Word made flesh
[1:49:07] he where he was the word and everything
[1:49:10] that God was was poured into Christ and
[1:49:12] then he became flesh now all that was in
[1:49:15] God was he in the Sun because the the
[1:49:17] the he said when you have seen the
[1:49:19] father you have seen me because I am the
[1:49:21] father are one
[1:49:22] so everything that God was was he in
[1:49:24] Jesus Christ he hadn't separated the
[1:49:27] male from the female yet so because and
[1:49:29] you say well then how could I been in
[1:49:31] the foundation of the world if I was in
[1:49:33] Christ because he was Christ in the
[1:49:35] before the foundation of the world it
[1:49:37] was God that created you in his own mind
[1:49:40] and then it was God that stepped into
[1:49:42] flesh and heaven and earth overlapped
[1:49:44] again in the form of Jesus Christ at
[1:49:46] that moment in time you are on the cross
[1:49:49] with him this brings a greater
[1:49:51] understanding of Galatians 2:20 when it
[1:49:53] says I was crucified with Christ it is
[1:49:56] no longer I that live when you are born
[1:49:58] again in your barrier baptized in the
[1:50:00] name of the Lord Jesus Christ you have
[1:50:02] you stepped into him you stepped into
[1:50:05] that long line of eternity that never
[1:50:07] had a beginning and they will never have
[1:50:08] an end so when Christ was on the cross
[1:50:11] you were there because it was all in one
[1:50:14] and then when he in it he goes on to say
[1:50:17] he says so when God looked down upon the
[1:50:20] body of Christ he saw both male and
[1:50:23] female and it was all redeemed in that
[1:50:25] one body so when you step into Christ
[1:50:28] Jesus today and
[1:50:30] he received the baptism of the Holy
[1:50:31] Spirit then you are stepping into that
[1:50:33] same eternity that same stream of life
[1:50:36] that was there on the cross and it was
[1:50:38] there before the foundation of the world
[1:50:39] he hadn't broken it up yet so when he
[1:50:42] ascended on high and he came back there
[1:50:44] were little licks inand in tongues of
[1:50:46] fire on all the different people
[1:50:47] he broke himself up into a mini membered
[1:50:50] pride and then that little that seed
[1:50:53] that was on the inside of you that God
[1:50:54] placed there the Holy Spirit came down
[1:50:56] and then the two became one and then the
[1:50:59] life came up out of you that's exactly
[1:51:02] what happened to Peter that's exactly
[1:51:04] what happened to you and me it's got to
[1:51:06] happen in the life of every single
[1:51:08] believer if you profess to be a believer
[1:51:10] heaven and earth has overlapped inside
[1:51:13] of you because it was Christ and it was
[1:51:16] Christ that was on the cross and it was
[1:51:18] that it was in the temple that heaven
[1:51:20] and earth overlapped that God could
[1:51:21] commune with his people and have
[1:51:23] fellowship with him once again and it
[1:51:25] was in Jesus Christ said that went on
[1:51:27] the cross that the same was so heaven
[1:51:30] and earth overlapped it says in uh in
[1:51:36] 1st Corinthians 3:16 he says dude do you
[1:51:39] and I don't have it he says do you know
[1:51:41] that you are the temple of God that your
[1:51:44] body is a temple for the Lord you are
[1:51:47] the temple so now having an earth
[1:51:49] overlapped in the form of Jesus Christ
[1:51:51] but when you stepped into Christ then
[1:51:54] heaven and earth overlapped in you so
[1:51:57] that is why grace is now here on the
[1:51:59] earth is because you are here so this is
[1:52:03] still Satan's Eden but heaven and earth
[1:52:05] are overlapping inside of every single
[1:52:07] one of his believers because Jesus
[1:52:09] Christ is alive today you are alive
[1:52:12] because he lives we live and it's
[1:52:15] because that heaven and over in an earth
[1:52:16] overlapped that you are still here that
[1:52:18] the earth is still here
[1:52:20] that grace is still on the earth is
[1:52:21] because you and Christ are made one in
[1:52:24] one flesh you are flesh of his flesh and
[1:52:26] bone of his bone and because he was the
[1:52:28] same on the cross that the propitiation
[1:52:31] for our sins was paid and then you step
[1:52:34] into that and all you have to do is to
[1:52:36] surrender yourself to the law that
[1:52:39] for rides you there's nothing else you
[1:52:41] have to do that's why it's not of works
[1:52:43] lest any man should boast it is by fears
[1:52:46] by grace that through faith in Jesus
[1:52:48] Christ you are saved so when you step
[1:52:51] into that stream of eternity you are
[1:52:53] heaven and earth overlapping right as we
[1:52:55] sit that is how you can be quickened out
[1:52:58] of this mortal body right as we speak
[1:53:00] remember you're going to be resurrected
[1:53:02] you are quickened right now if the same
[1:53:04] spirit that raised up Jesus from the
[1:53:06] dead raised him up and it will quicken
[1:53:09] your malla body just as like he did it's
[1:53:12] the same thing that happens when you are
[1:53:13] healed it's the same thing that that
[1:53:15] happens when you are saved isn't that
[1:53:18] beautiful
[1:53:20] heaven and earth overlaps in the temple
[1:53:23] of God and you are the temple of God
[1:53:25] he's a mini member Godhead in in a mini
[1:53:28] member he's a mini member the Godhead in
[1:53:32] the bride 19:55 and Joe the doormats
[1:53:40] laid out the welcome mat tonight God's
[1:53:42] plan of redemption through the Opera
[1:53:44] offering up of the blood of the Lord
[1:53:46] Jesus Christ once for all to cleanse the
[1:53:49] guilty unworthy sinner and to bring him
[1:53:54] into reconciliation with God and restore
[1:53:56] him back into the Garden of Eden with
[1:53:58] his wife and his loved ones never to die
[1:54:00] no more never to be sick never to be to
[1:54:03] have a heartache or to be a funerals or
[1:54:06] no more graves to be dug Oh God
[1:54:09] no more weary no more nothing it's all
[1:54:11] over washed in the blood of the Lamb
[1:54:13] with his perfect assurance that Jesus
[1:54:15] Christ once come under his blood were
[1:54:18] safe from the Angel of Death it cannot
[1:54:20] touch us Romans 3:25 whom God hath set
[1:54:25] for them for to be a propitiation for
[1:54:27] through the faith in his blood to
[1:54:29] declare his righteousness for the
[1:54:30] remission of sins that are past through
[1:54:33] the forbearance of God to declare I say
[1:54:36] at this time his righteousness that he
[1:54:38] might be the that he might be just and
[1:54:40] the justifier of him which believe
[1:54:43] believeth in Jesus
[1:54:50] I don't know if anything that's more
[1:54:51] amazing than that when I when I go over
[1:54:55] seas which I don't go often and you know
[1:55:00] there's a lot of people they say they go
[1:55:01] overseas and yeah I'm doing a work in
[1:55:03] doing a work in Africa you know we're
[1:55:05] going over there we're doing it we're
[1:55:06] doing a great work I'm going over here
[1:55:08] and I'm you know we're seeing great
[1:55:09] success we're doing a lot of work
[1:55:11] well yeah but I kind of don't like to
[1:55:14] say that and I don't like I don't
[1:55:15] believe that because I go over and many
[1:55:19] times the countries that I go to anyways
[1:55:20] they look up to culture or they look up
[1:55:23] to the the gray-headed one so the the
[1:55:26] guy who is the oldest and the guy who
[1:55:27] has the most children he's the one that
[1:55:29] gets this respect and he's the one that
[1:55:30] gets the authority given to him so me a
[1:55:33] young fella coming in and in preaching
[1:55:35] to him I have to be very careful and I
[1:55:36] have to be very diplomatic in a way that
[1:55:38] I approach them because they can just
[1:55:40] say well who are you to be telling us
[1:55:42] what what you think but the more and
[1:55:44] more I go overseas I realized that we're
[1:55:46] just spreading the gospel so that people
[1:55:49] can catch it and then they're the ones
[1:55:51] that do the work in the country it's not
[1:55:54] us that comes back to say well we're
[1:55:55] doing a great work in this country in
[1:55:56] this country no no you just went brought
[1:55:59] the gospel they're the ones that are
[1:56:00] doing the work they're the ones that
[1:56:02] live there every day we're the ones that
[1:56:04] go through the hardships of Laodicea and
[1:56:05] where we live they go through the
[1:56:07] hardships of layer to see it and there
[1:56:08] and where they live we're just going
[1:56:10] over to be an encouragement however when
[1:56:12] we when we go I always find that when
[1:56:17] you're introducing the message to people
[1:56:19] who have never believed the message
[1:56:20] before I always like to say listen I'm
[1:56:26] not selling you anything I've got good
[1:56:29] news
[1:56:29] this stuff is great this is good stuff
[1:56:33] hear me out
[1:56:34] and then you'll begin to just explain it
[1:56:36] and just say no this is what happened
[1:56:38] now this is um this is what I believe
[1:56:40] according to the scripture now this is
[1:56:42] why half of the denominational world
[1:56:44] doesn't believe that then I'll go
[1:56:45] through the history and everything like
[1:56:46] that and lay it out and then there they
[1:56:48] have to make their own decision you
[1:56:49] can't convince anybody of the of the
[1:56:52] truth you can't give somebody a
[1:56:53] revelation God has to do that you just
[1:56:54] have to go and be the body that God can
[1:56:56] give it to them through so I find myself
[1:57:00] more and more saying this is not this is
[1:57:04] not and especially more so as people are
[1:57:06] leaving the message and we encounter
[1:57:08] more people who are coming against it I
[1:57:10] find myself saying what what do you
[1:57:13] think you're leaving if you think you're
[1:57:17] leaving a man-made religion where
[1:57:19] brother branham is is the centerpiece of
[1:57:21] it and then everything else stems off
[1:57:23] from that then you you missed the whole
[1:57:24] thing what did you even think you were
[1:57:27] in this whole thing is the revelation of
[1:57:32] Jesus Christ to you personally that's
[1:57:35] the message to me and when I go overseas
[1:57:37] I'm not speaking well where we want you
[1:57:39] to come into our faith we want you to
[1:57:41] come into our religion you're doing more
[1:57:43] harm than you are good what you need to
[1:57:45] do is say I have good news
[1:57:47] God is sending out a message in this
[1:57:49] last day and it's that you are or you
[1:57:52] can sit in heavenly places in Christ
[1:57:54] Jesus and you are made alive and there's
[1:57:57] nothing you have to do except to submit
[1:57:58] yourself to the Holy Spirit this is what
[1:58:01] the Holy Spirit is this is how you
[1:58:02] surrender yourself this good news its
[1:58:05] grace why is it that zerubabbel the only
[1:58:07] thing that he could say to the headstone
[1:58:09] as it descended down on top of the
[1:58:11] pyramid is grace grace unto it is
[1:58:13] because it's nothing less but the grace
[1:58:16] of God that has submitted itself to you
[1:58:18] and given you the opportunity to see who
[1:58:21] you are in Jesus Christ that's what the
[1:58:24] message is to me it's not something that
[1:58:26] you are simulating - it's God that you
[1:58:28] get into and it's an individual affair
[1:58:31] it's not the church that doesn't end
[1:58:33] collectively it's in the individual that
[1:58:35] God comes to it's in the individual that
[1:58:38] having an earth overlap because Jesus
[1:58:40] Christ himself is inside of you that's
[1:58:44] why that's that's that's the good news
[1:58:46] that we have that's the gospel in it's
[1:58:49] good news it's not something that we
[1:58:50] should be ashamed to say it's not
[1:58:52] something that we should be ashamed to
[1:58:53] share you should say hey man this is
[1:58:56] this is good stuff this is awesome and
[1:58:58] this is where I'm at in my life you show
[1:59:01] me something better and I'll come and
[1:59:02] follow it heaven and earth overlaps
[1:59:10] inside of you isn't that the most
[1:59:12] amazing thing right now you are sitting
[1:59:15] in heavenly places in Christ Jesus the
[1:59:17] problem is is that you've got to go to
[1:59:19] work Monday morning so you get up and
[1:59:22] you go back out into Laodicea and you
[1:59:23] face the world that is without and so
[1:59:27] that the mind can be some cook become so
[1:59:30] bogged down with all the different cares
[1:59:32] of this life which are necessary we wish
[1:59:35] they weren't but they are necessary and
[1:59:37] it behooves us just to step back and say
[1:59:40] it was Christ in the beginning and
[1:59:43] because God had separated male from the
[1:59:45] female yet when Jesus was on the cross I
[1:59:47] was crucified with him and when you
[1:59:50] place yourself into the blood of Jesus
[1:59:52] Christ and you see yourself you see your
[1:59:55] identification in there that is what God
[1:59:57] is looking for and to me that is the
[1:59:59] baptism of the Holy Spirit is when you
[2:00:01] see your identification in that when
[2:00:03] Peter before he went out to the gate
[2:00:06] beautiful he was there in the upper room
[2:00:07] and he they caught the revelation when
[2:00:10] he before this he was saying people came
[2:00:13] up to a Peter and he said do you know do
[2:00:15] you know Jesus Jesus I thought I saw you
[2:00:17] with him he's like no I don't even know
[2:00:18] who he is
[2:00:19] go away from me I don't even know who he
[2:00:21] was he was ashamed he was embarrassed of
[2:00:23] it not any it not because of any
[2:00:24] ill-will he just didn't know how to
[2:00:26] react he didn't have an identification
[2:00:28] of what was going on in what had
[2:00:30] preceded as a result of that of the time
[2:00:34] it was only after he received the
[2:00:37] baptism of the Holy Spirit in the upper
[2:00:39] room that he and John were walking
[2:00:41] through the up to the gate beautiful and
[2:00:42] they were walking along and they were
[2:00:43] going in the temple to preach and they
[2:00:45] had just saved 3000 Souls and they came
[2:00:48] up and they were walking in and the guy
[2:00:49] says alms alms for the poor can you can
[2:00:51] you give me something and Peter looks at
[2:00:53] him and I love what the scripture says
[2:00:54] it says John and Peter fastening their
[2:00:56] eyes upon upon it they looked and you
[2:01:00] can just see Peter and he's there and he
[2:01:03] says and he looks at John and the
[2:01:06] scripture says he looks back he says
[2:01:09] listen pal I don't have any money but
[2:01:12] such as I have I'll give it to you
[2:01:16] do you see the difference as before you
[2:01:19] were saying no I don't I don't know he
[2:01:20] didn't have an identification as to who
[2:01:22] he was but after that he says I've got
[2:01:24] something that I can give to you this is
[2:01:28] now what I possess as a result of having
[2:01:31] the revelation having the identification
[2:01:33] of the baptism of the Holy Spirit so I
[2:01:36] know who I am now and I know that he'll
[2:01:38] do the same for you because I am a part
[2:01:40] of him you can be a part of him also so
[2:01:43] he had the identification and that's
[2:01:45] what allowed him to be healed and that
[2:01:47] man to rise up and go and the Lord acted
[2:01:49] on the basis of that identification
[2:01:51] it wasn't upon Peters beckoning call
[2:01:54] Lord heal this man he says rise up and
[2:01:56] walk in the name of Jesus Christ I give
[2:01:58] this to you this is all I've got but I
[2:02:00] give it to you and the Lord acted on the
[2:02:02] basis of his identification in the Word
[2:02:04] of God there was no scripture there was
[2:02:06] no Bible like they had he hadn't even
[2:02:08] written his letters yet it was on the
[2:02:11] basis of who he knew he was in the Lord
[2:02:14] Jesus Christ and that's exactly the same
[2:02:17] thing that's got to happen in the life
[2:02:19] of every single believer you've got to
[2:02:22] know this is who I am in Christ Jesus
[2:02:24] and this is where I'm going this is what
[2:02:27] happened to me this is why I am here
[2:02:29] this is everything this is good news
[2:02:32] that's what that's something that you
[2:02:34] can share 1955 a hidden life in Christ
[2:02:42] brother branham he says then days he
[2:02:45] dwelt in his tabernacle and today he
[2:02:48] dwells in you as his tabernacle but we
[2:02:52] must make this place a dwelling not an
[2:02:55] outer court place or the first holy
[2:02:57] place but we must live with God in the
[2:03:00] holiest of Holies a consecrate and
[2:03:02] hidden life alone quiet with God heaven
[2:03:09] and earth were once together and then
[2:03:12] they were driven apart horrendously
[2:03:15] ripped apart and the whole process and
[2:03:20] the whole plan of redemption is to bring
[2:03:24] them back together again
[2:03:28] but the ban him he says some he says in
[2:03:31] many places but particularly he says in
[2:03:36] the future home of the heavenly
[2:03:37] bridegroom in the earthly bride in 1964
[2:03:40] now he's called the church through
[2:03:42] justification he called it through
[2:03:44] sanctification and then he filled it
[2:03:46] with the Holy Ghost and fire and he took
[2:03:49] it through a process he's got a system
[2:03:52] he's got a law that things have to abide
[2:03:54] by he says he took it through a process
[2:03:56] that he himself the Holy Spirit Himself
[2:03:59] the son of God could dwell in the human
[2:04:02] heart now it has to go through that
[2:04:05] before he can come into it God came
[2:04:09] three times Jesus came three times he
[2:04:12] came first to redeem his bride he comes
[2:04:15] secondly to get his bride and thirdly he
[2:04:18] comes with his bride all that heaven was
[2:04:21] on this earth it was ripped apart and
[2:04:23] now we live on this earth
[2:04:26] Satan's Eden but God's purpose was to
[2:04:29] bring us into fellowship and humanity
[2:04:32] now the reason that he allowed that to
[2:04:35] happen is because Adam would have never
[2:04:38] known what it was like to be redeemed
[2:04:41] had he not fallen so he allowed the
[2:04:44] world to get into the place that it is
[2:04:45] to express himself as a redeemer to
[2:04:48] express himself as a father to express
[2:04:51] himself as a healer and a redeemer and
[2:04:53] all of the things that's inside of God
[2:04:55] we know that he allowed all of this to
[2:04:57] happen so that he could show himself
[2:05:00] complete in us by that fulfilling his
[2:05:03] second purpose which was to if through
[2:05:06] Christ express himself completely
[2:05:08] through his bride he was one on the on
[2:05:11] the cross and he in the e be pulled
[2:05:13] apart and now you are the bride of Jesus
[2:05:16] Christ and now is the union of the of
[2:05:20] the bride with the groom as the visible
[2:05:22] brought Union of the bride of Jesus
[2:05:23] Christ in Ephesians 1:10 that in the
[2:05:27] dispensation of the fullness of times he
[2:05:30] might gather together in all things in
[2:05:32] Christ both which are in heaven and in
[2:05:34] earth and even in him so now God's
[2:05:36] purpose now is to bring all
[2:05:39] this back to what it was in the
[2:05:41] beginning in the Garden of Eden so just
[2:05:43] now as a foreshadow just now input in
[2:05:47] potential God you you are as the temple
[2:05:50] of God the overlapping of heaven and
[2:05:53] earth but that's not God's purpose is to
[2:05:56] allow us to live like this he wants to
[2:05:58] bring us back into full communion and
[2:06:00] fellowship and so he says in 1965 the
[2:06:05] rapture were right there ready now the
[2:06:08] only thing the church coming out has got
[2:06:10] to lay before the Sun to ripen and the
[2:06:12] great combine will come by after a while
[2:06:14] the wheat will be burned in the stocks
[2:06:16] but the grain will be gathered into its
[2:06:17] garner you know the only reason that you
[2:06:19] bring character to heaven with you you
[2:06:21] don't bring anything else you don't
[2:06:22] bring your boats your cars your your
[2:06:24] your books your your Bible you don't
[2:06:26] bring anything with you to heaven except
[2:06:29] your character because in Revelations he
[2:06:32] says in it says that as he says he saw
[2:06:39] they are in Daniel chapter 7 he saw
[2:06:42] Christ and then he saw thousands and
[2:06:45] thousands ministering unto him he sees a
[2:06:49] group of people ministering to Jesus
[2:06:53] Christ and that is post millennium
[2:06:56] because Jesus Christ comes remember
[2:06:58] first to redeem his bride he comes
[2:07:02] second to get his bride and that's where
[2:07:04] we the fulfillment of Ephesians 1:10
[2:07:07] that in the dispensation of fullness of
[2:07:09] times you might gather all that are
[2:07:11] together both things that are in heaven
[2:07:12] and which are on earth together in him
[2:07:15] so he's bringing everything back
[2:07:17] together in him and now that's when we
[2:07:20] step back into Christ we are in him
[2:07:22] potentially as what what brother Branham
[2:07:24] said the resurrection is is to take
[2:07:26] place the quickening it is taking place
[2:07:30] as everybody on the same page so now
[2:07:33] post millennium he comes back and Daniel
[2:07:35] sees which he could not release until
[2:07:38] the end he could not reveal until the
[2:07:39] end which is now we see now that Christ
[2:07:42] comes back many ministering unto him
[2:07:45] brother Branham says in the church age
[2:07:47] book the character which is the only
[2:07:49] thing that you bring with you to heaven
[2:07:51] is not a gift it's not something that's
[2:07:55] given to you like I said I'm never I'm
[2:07:57] not saying anything that you most likely
[2:07:59] haven't heard before it's not a gift
[2:08:01] it's the only thing you bring with you
[2:08:04] to heaven and remember now we're going
[2:08:06] to heaven just as Daniel saw to be
[2:08:10] ministering with Christ to judge in the
[2:08:14] white throne judgment post millennium so
[2:08:17] after all of this has brought back
[2:08:18] together in Christ we come back with him
[2:08:21] and we Minister with him in heavenly
[2:08:23] places and we do that as his queen as
[2:08:27] bride and groom so the reason that we
[2:08:30] need the character then is to rule and
[2:08:33] reign with him and the reason that
[2:08:36] character is not a gift is because it's
[2:08:38] your victory it's a victory it's not a
[2:08:42] gift so when you go through life and you
[2:08:45] go through this as Peter said in his
[2:08:47] first letter he says just this brief
[2:08:49] moment of time we call life in this
[2:08:52] brief moment of of troubles in this
[2:08:54] brief moment of of things we shouldn't
[2:08:56] be so worried about what we see but
[2:09:00] because of the things that we have a
[2:09:02] revelation of because of the things that
[2:09:05] we we see by faith we can rise above all
[2:09:08] of the things that happen to us and all
[2:09:10] of the difficulties and the troubles and
[2:09:12] the trials and the people and everything
[2:09:14] that happened we can rise above all that
[2:09:16] and we can look and we say this is where
[2:09:18] I am going I'm going on the other side
[2:09:20] because Christ's purpose was to bring it
[2:09:23] all back together again so that heaven
[2:09:25] and earth could exist on this earth
[2:09:27] we're not going off somewhere he's
[2:09:30] pulling us off the earth in the rapture
[2:09:33] and his company is bringing us together
[2:09:34] and what happens then
[2:09:36] well if Christ has to bring us through
[2:09:38] justification and sanctification in the
[2:09:41] baptism of the Holy Spirit
[2:09:42] then he's got to bring the earth through
[2:09:44] the same process because the earth was
[2:09:46] forfeited by mankind so the flood was
[2:09:50] the justification by water it was
[2:09:52] completely justified and surrounded in
[2:09:55] water and all the sin was was flooded
[2:09:56] out of it through Christ he was
[2:09:59] sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:10:01] because now earth in heaven now
[2:10:03] overlap in the form of Jesus Christ and
[2:10:05] then to you and then after we go he's
[2:10:09] got to have he's got to purge the earth
[2:10:11] with with fire with an all-consuming
[2:10:13] fire as we read in 1st and 2nd Peter
[2:10:16] chapter 3 he says but the day of the
[2:10:19] Lord will come as a thief in the night
[2:10:20] in the heavens in there they shall burn
[2:10:22] with a fervent Heat
[2:10:23] that's post millennium so it's got to
[2:10:27] happen where it all consumes and it's
[2:10:29] all burned up because we've got to be
[2:10:31] away from the earth when that happens
[2:10:33] because we are the only grace that the
[2:10:35] earth will ever see so because we are
[2:10:38] here
[2:10:39] heaven and earth overlapping God can't
[2:10:41] destroy the earth and fully redeem it
[2:10:44] you've got to be pulled away from it so
[2:10:46] we come together in Christ interactor he
[2:10:49] pulls us away and then it's completely
[2:10:51] consumed in fire at that point we we we
[2:10:54] reign with him and rule with him as king
[2:10:56] and queen we are brought that the
[2:10:59] completeness of our fellowship is made
[2:11:01] known at that point in time and then
[2:11:04] after that in Revelations
[2:11:06] 21 to 34 and he says in I John saw the
[2:11:09] holy city a New Jerusalem coming down
[2:11:12] from God out of heaven prepared as a
[2:11:15] bride adorned for her husband and I
[2:11:18] heard a great voice out of heaven saying
[2:11:20] behold the tabernacle of God is with men
[2:11:22] and he will dwell with him and they
[2:11:25] shall be his people and God himself
[2:11:28] shall be with them and be their God and
[2:11:31] God shall wipe away all tears from their
[2:11:34] eyes and there shall be no more death
[2:11:38] neither sorrow nor crying neither shall
[2:11:42] there be any more pain for the former
[2:11:44] things are passed away
[2:11:47] can you imagine John standing and seeing
[2:11:51] all of this he says this is what we're
[2:11:54] going to it seems it seems that that
[2:11:59] would be worth attaining if it meant
[2:12:02] boiling in a pot of oil for a few hours
[2:12:06] he was able to see this and you see what
[2:12:10] it did to John he was raised up with it
[2:12:14] was just like with the wings of eagles
[2:12:16] he was raised up beyond all of the
[2:12:18] things that he could see all of the
[2:12:19] things that was going on and he could
[2:12:21] see that is my hope that is the victory
[2:12:24] that is the that is that is where I am
[2:12:26] going to that's why it's good news not
[2:12:30] because of me and what I can do in this
[2:12:32] present time that it eliminates that
[2:12:35] should eliminate the idea of works in
[2:12:38] your mind it should wipe it completely
[2:12:40] away because it's not what you do here
[2:12:43] that enables you to get that it's you
[2:12:46] stepping into Christ that you can look
[2:12:48] and say that is where I am going to that
[2:12:51] is my hope in the Lord Jesus Christ and
[2:12:53] nothing less that is how that I can can
[2:12:55] I can get up every morning and go to bed
[2:12:57] every night and do the same again and
[2:12:59] again and again is because that is what
[2:13:01] I am looking forward to that is my hope
[2:13:04] in the Lord Jesus Christ is because God
[2:13:06] is going to bring heaven and earth back
[2:13:08] together again just like it was in the
[2:13:10] beginning of time so there's no more
[2:13:12] sorrow there's no more sickness there's
[2:13:13] no more death there's no more dying it's
[2:13:17] just us in Christ that is what his
[2:13:20] purpose is that is what his goal is for
[2:13:23] you and Satan's purpose is to try to
[2:13:28] interrupt the the relationship that you
[2:13:33] have between you and Christ right now
[2:13:36] because this is the only place that
[2:13:39] Satan will have dominion so because he
[2:13:43] placed us in Satan's even we build the
[2:13:47] character needed to rule and reign with
[2:13:49] him so we know where we're going the
[2:13:53] whole idea is for God to bring us back
[2:13:56] into fellowship with him that's what we
[2:13:59] are coming to that's what we are in is
[2:14:01] fellowship with him it's not association
[2:14:04] to an ax or a religion it's not
[2:14:06] something like that it's a fellowship
[2:14:08] it's a relationship that he wants us to
[2:14:10] come to and you first have to know God
[2:14:13] by an experience in order to have a
[2:14:15] fellowship with him but you must
[2:14:18] coming to fellowship with him but the
[2:14:21] Bannerman says it try to wrap it up
[2:14:27] he says there's lots of bypasses and
[2:14:31] this that a says always as long as I do
[2:14:33] this he said that's not it
[2:14:35] he says you've got to find God in a
[2:14:38] personal relationship and experience and
[2:14:40] if you can claim you have it and still
[2:14:44] live for the world then there's
[2:14:45] something wrong the devil has detoured
[2:14:49] you on the wrong scripture so this very
[2:14:53] closely aligns works because we so often
[2:14:57] look look to works it's what we can do
[2:14:59] because that's innately our our nature
[2:15:02] we want to do something to achieve that
[2:15:04] to have that he says you've got to find
[2:15:07] God in a relationship and an experience
[2:15:10] that's how you find him so it's not
[2:15:13] something that you bring to the table
[2:15:15] that enables you to have access to that
[2:15:17] it's something that he draws you to it's
[2:15:21] not you finding the Holy Spirit it's the
[2:15:23] Holy Spirit finding you because we were
[2:15:26] in the mind of God before the foundation
[2:15:27] of the world so right there you can be
[2:15:32] at ease if you're if you're trapped in
[2:15:35] your mind be set at ease by this it's
[2:15:39] not what you do that places you into it
[2:15:41] it's you surrendering yourself to the
[2:15:44] law that is overriding the whole thing
[2:15:46] which is the Holy Spirit and when you do
[2:15:51] that then he can find you
[2:15:53] he places you into that he gives you an
[2:15:55] identification with it he gives you the
[2:15:58] Holy Spirit to live day after day after
[2:15:59] day after day after day he gives you the
[2:16:02] knowledge and the understanding and the
[2:16:03] progressive revelation to be where
[2:16:05] you're at I mean some of you have been
[2:16:07] in the message more than I've been alive
[2:16:09] and he's allowed you to come in and to
[2:16:11] grow and to grow in the knowledge of
[2:16:13] grace and in faith and he's allowed you
[2:16:16] to do that by His grace that's nothing
[2:16:18] but the Holy Spirit leading you
[2:16:19] step-by-step you've got to surrender
[2:16:23] yourself daily to that that is
[2:16:26] fellowship
[2:16:30] remember now relationship is the act of
[2:16:34] being connected so you can know God you
[2:16:37] can know the scripture you can have an
[2:16:40] intellectual conception of it you can
[2:16:42] also have an intellectual conception of
[2:16:43] the message of our day know it backwards
[2:16:46] and front words but it's only this is
[2:16:49] just a seed it's just words on paper
[2:16:51] until you surrender yourself to the Holy
[2:16:54] Spirit so that the the bride can become
[2:16:58] one with his groom again because the two
[2:17:00] were separated so in order for you to be
[2:17:03] the overlap of heaven and earth on this
[2:17:04] on this in this Satan's Eden
[2:17:07] you've got to surrender yourself to that
[2:17:12] he says in 1960 in the unfailing
[2:17:15] realities of the Living God that's what
[2:17:17] the world needs today that Creed's and
[2:17:20] fashions and all of these things we need
[2:17:23] the realities of God we need the
[2:17:26] realities of God and so many times
[2:17:30] because by works we try to place
[2:17:33] ourselves in that whether through
[2:17:34] emotion which is not a bad thing it's a
[2:17:37] good thing to try to to raise your hand
[2:17:40] even when you don't have a reason to and
[2:17:42] that right it's a good thing to read
[2:17:44] your Bible even though you don't
[2:17:45] understand what you're reading it's a
[2:17:47] good thing to understand the message
[2:17:49] even though you don't have a really
[2:17:50] understanding of it better you
[2:17:52] understand that than anything else
[2:17:53] although it'll make your miserable if
[2:17:55] you don't have a true revelation of what
[2:17:57] it is what you need to have is the
[2:18:04] reality of God in your life nowadays I
[2:18:09] find so many especially young people
[2:18:10] they say I'm brother Steve I understand
[2:18:14] what you're saying but I don't see the
[2:18:16] reality of God in my life so I get what
[2:18:20] you're saying and I can I can conceive
[2:18:22] it but I I don't I don't have the
[2:18:25] realities of God in my life do you
[2:18:29] realize it's it's not by works lest you
[2:18:34] should boast in it
[2:18:35] it's by grace that through faith you are
[2:18:39] saved and it's faith that places you
[2:18:43] into the Holy Spirit so that the law of
[2:18:45] God can work on the basis of his own
[2:18:47] word so true Fellowship is abiding in
[2:18:53] His Word and allowing the word to abide
[2:18:55] in you and you in it and then also
[2:18:58] giving the Holy Spirit the preeminence
[2:19:00] to act on the basis of His Word in your
[2:19:02] life
[2:19:03] that's what genuine fellowship is is is
[2:19:07] is operating on the basis of the word
[2:19:10] and that's what that's what the prophet
[2:19:12] of Malachi Ford did is he pointed us to
[2:19:14] the faith of the Pentecostal fathers a
[2:19:16] faith that abided in the word a faith
[2:19:19] that had an experience an eye and an
[2:19:20] identification with the Word of God
[2:19:22] which was Christ Jesus I said such as I
[2:19:25] have I will give to you so you see such
[2:19:28] as I have I am taking in the Word of God
[2:19:30] and I am allowing the Holy Spirit to
[2:19:32] operate on the basis of that alone not
[2:19:35] on my thinking not on my reasoning not
[2:19:37] on my abilities not on my works not on
[2:19:40] anything else but the Word of God and
[2:19:42] the Holy Spirit in operation in my life
[2:19:45] that is genuine fellowship Satan's goal
[2:19:48] and his purpose is to get in between
[2:19:51] that so he'll get through work through
[2:19:53] the avenues of the spirit realm to get
[2:19:55] you to be thinking differently about the
[2:19:57] word or to believe the word in its
[2:19:59] fullness and not allow the preeminence
[2:20:01] of the Holy Spirit to move in your heart
[2:20:02] so he is his something is in the way
[2:20:05] whether it be lost or a spirit or
[2:20:07] something in your home or a lack of a
[2:20:09] fully applying the token that would
[2:20:11] disallow the Holy Spirit to act on the
[2:20:13] basis of the word it's only when you
[2:20:15] apply the token that the two become one
[2:20:18] remember it's only when the token wasn't
[2:20:20] was was it was paid for when it was
[2:20:22] bought when it was purchased for us that
[2:20:24] heaven and earth overlapped again in the
[2:20:26] form of Jesus Christ and it's only the
[2:20:28] same that it happens in you when you're
[2:20:30] born again and filled with the Holy
[2:20:31] Spirit at Christ and you become one you
[2:20:34] are flesh of his flesh and bone of his
[2:20:36] bone you never had a beginning you'll
[2:20:37] never have an ending we were there in
[2:20:39] the beginning we are going back to
[2:20:41] heaven
[2:20:42] on this earth and it happens and what's
[2:20:47] going on right now is he's bringing you
[2:20:50] and me into fellowship don't think for a
[2:20:54] second that you're not walking on water
[2:20:57] you you are out in the middle of the
[2:21:01] deep is where you are when you are
[2:21:05] operating on the basis of the word and
[2:21:08] allowing the Holy Spirit to bring it to
[2:21:11] bring it forth in your life you are
[2:21:13] allowing the seed to grow inch by inch
[2:21:15] just just a little bit by a little bit
[2:21:17] it's pulling things up from the Word of
[2:21:19] God and the water is down on top of it
[2:21:21] it's growing into a mighty tree you're
[2:21:23] developing the character and the life
[2:21:25] that you have that you will go on the
[2:21:27] other side with remember the character
[2:21:30] is the life of Christ that is on the
[2:21:31] inside of you when you are born again
[2:21:33] and you were sealed with the Holy Ghost
[2:21:35] that little seed came to life with a
[2:21:37] little spark of life that grew up in the
[2:21:39] seed but now as you water it and as you
[2:21:41] grow and as you live and as you face the
[2:21:43] day-to-day grind because that's where
[2:21:47] the Christian really lives when you face
[2:21:49] the day-to-day grind that is where
[2:21:51] character is being developed and built
[2:21:53] and that character is the life of Christ
[2:21:55] in you the seed of God that will go back
[2:21:58] to him just like it came from him you
[2:22:01] see that it's not that via that you do
[2:22:03] anything it's he inside of you that you
[2:22:05] place that and you surrender yourself to
[2:22:07] that fellowship so that God can bring
[2:22:10] out of you all that he wants to bring
[2:22:12] out of you so that he can bring it back
[2:22:13] together again just like it was in the
[2:22:15] beginning that is such a beautiful thing
[2:22:18] to me I don't say I do I hope I I hope I
[2:22:22] can't get any more simple than that
[2:22:25] that's that's fellowship that's the
[2:22:29] purpose of God for you and for me so we
[2:22:33] think of purpose in again young people
[2:22:35] have and I think old people have a hard
[2:22:37] time with what is my purpose in life
[2:22:39] what am I supposed to do and especially
[2:22:40] down a down our way we have a lot of
[2:22:44] young people they're always you know
[2:22:45] what do I do for a career what is my
[2:22:46] what is my purpose and what is my life
[2:22:48] and I say this is the purpose of God for
[2:22:51] your life this is God's perfect will for
[2:22:53] you who you marry who
[2:22:55] we know where you work and your career
[2:22:57] in your life and your house and although
[2:22:59] those things those are just bringing you
[2:23:01] into step with this those are just the
[2:23:03] footsteps that you take to get to this
[2:23:05] but this is the perfect will of God for
[2:23:08] your life and when you submit yourself
[2:23:10] to this and allow the Holy Spirit to
[2:23:13] operate in your life on a daily basis
[2:23:15] and he's a sensitive being you have to
[2:23:18] invite him in you have to create an
[2:23:20] atmosphere for him when you do that on
[2:23:22] the daily basis that's fellowship
[2:23:24] because it's only on the basis of his
[2:23:27] word and on the unmoving of his Holy
[2:23:29] Spirit that life can exist and grow and
[2:23:32] be fed and happen
[2:23:37] heaven and earth were one in the same on
[2:23:40] this earth and then they were
[2:23:43] horrendously ripped apart and it hasn't
[2:23:47] been the same since but because of Jesus
[2:23:50] Christ
[2:23:52] they both overlap in you and it's only
[2:23:57] just a brief moment in time while we lay
[2:24:00] in the presence of the Sun and grow and
[2:24:02] ripen and riping right the ripening
[2:24:05] season is different than the growing
[2:24:06] season the the stock grows but the fruit
[2:24:09] ripens and the fruit is on the vine so
[2:24:12] as we go through that we develop
[2:24:16] character which is the only thing that
[2:24:17] comes with us and some sweet day that
[2:24:22] you are coming back together never to
[2:24:24] separate again that thought but
[2:24:30] fellowship allows you just to rise above
[2:24:34] the bills the auto trouble the hard
[2:24:39] things like a fire a death all of those
[2:24:45] things and it allows you to rise above
[2:24:48] it and to say some sweet day I'm going
[2:24:52] home
[2:24:53] that is the hope that we have and we fix
[2:24:56] her eyes on that would you buy our heads
[2:25:00] with me let's close their brother Gerald
[2:25:03] if you'd like to come
[2:25:04] the musicians would like to come and
[2:25:06] I'll turn it over to you and you can
[2:25:07] sing for us but let's just bow our heads
[2:25:09] and let's pray
[2:25:21] Heavenly Father let's just all pray
[2:25:26] together
[2:25:28] Heavenly Father when we step back like
[2:25:34] that and we see the whole spans of time
[2:25:35] right in front of us and we see a great
[2:25:39] mystery like that now that we were in
[2:25:41] you and Christ and Galatians 2:20 I was
[2:25:45] crucified with you I was there with you
[2:25:47] that portion of you came back inside of
[2:25:50] me and now I live quickened in heavenly
[2:25:54] places in Christ Jesus Heavenly Father
[2:25:59] that is a reality of you amen we might
[2:26:02] not always feel the presence of God like
[2:26:04] we desire to geez
[2:26:06] we might not always have miracles
[2:26:08] happening every day although there are
[2:26:10] we might not have amazing camp-meeting
[2:26:14] experiences all the time but this fact
[2:26:17] is a reality of you this fellowship that
[2:26:22] we have although we might not feel like
[2:26:25] it is it is a reality of you man and
[2:26:29] because we have faith in it it is a
[2:26:31] greater reality than anything we
[2:26:32] experience in this life is all the
[2:26:35] things in this life are just gonna pass
[2:26:37] away a man but your word will never pass
[2:26:39] away and your word is in us so Heavenly
[2:26:46] Father teach us to come into fellowship
[2:26:50] with you and if there's anyone that
[2:26:53] hasn't it doesn't even have a
[2:26:54] relationship with you then give them
[2:26:56] that you pull on them just as hard as
[2:26:59] you can you can make them miserable
[2:27:01] until they respond because there's
[2:27:04] nothing greater than coming into
[2:27:06] Christ's presence it's good news and we
[2:27:10] thank you for it and if there's some who
[2:27:13] have wavered in their fellowship with
[2:27:14] you then bring them back into it yes
[2:27:18] allow them dish to wipe everything clear
[2:27:20] clear the flue and just abide with you
[2:27:25] and if there's those who are in
[2:27:27] fellowship with you bring them higher
[2:27:30] and we may not let the devil just beat
[2:27:35] us up but that we could just step higher
[2:27:38] and say Lord some sweet day we're all
[2:27:41] going home this is your purpose this is
[2:27:45] what you intended from the beginning and
[2:27:47] it's that that we submit ourselves to as
[2:27:50] the body of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:27:52] tonight or as Christians as believers we
[2:27:55] submit ourselves to that granite father
[2:27:59] that you bring us into fellowship how we
[2:28:01] love you and how we think and in the
[2:28:03] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[2:28:05] amen amen god bless it's the name of the
[2:28:12] Lord I could preach it was a tremendous
[2:28:20] foundation amen
[2:28:22] to go on and on and on because why we're
[2:28:27] not we're not involved with natural
[2:28:28] things Hurley things but eternal a man
[2:28:32] this is what our brother brought out I I
[2:28:35] believe he had the truth I believe it
[2:28:37] was very clear I believe it was God
[2:28:39] hidden and revealed and simplicity a man
[2:28:42] by the grace of God that we come from
[2:28:44] eternity we're going back to eternity I
[2:28:46] trust we have that confirmation that
[2:28:48] identification in us a man's for the
[2:28:51] token life of the blood of our Lord
[2:28:53] Jesus Christ a man that's good so this
[2:28:58] is enough to go on for another two hours
[2:29:00] I'm sure or more so but I'm gonna leave
[2:29:03] it as it is because I believe that God
[2:29:07] has spoken
[2:29:07] Amen the Lord has spoken it wasn't our
[2:29:11] brother Steven it was the Lord oh I
[2:29:13] believe that was all my heart was the
[2:29:15] Holy Ghost a man taking the word and the
[2:29:19] truth and bring it down on this level
[2:29:22] praise the name of the Lord each that's
[2:29:23] the truth there he was right when he
[2:29:26] said that there are those that take take
[2:29:28] the message and they make it complicated
[2:29:29] and that is the truth they go off with
[2:29:31] this doctrine and that dr. another
[2:29:33] doctrine and then they make
[2:29:34] denominations have those doctrines but
[2:29:37] you got to get get into the simplicity
[2:29:39] of it of why God did what he did
[2:29:41] and you know what did what is God doing
[2:29:43] now what God did what is God doing and
[2:29:45] what is God going to do just just bring
[2:29:48] it down to simplicity it's God that
[2:29:50] worketh in me it's not me to live this
[2:29:53] crazy live within me a man that that's
[2:29:56] the confirmation again on what our
[2:29:57] brother was ministering a man and
[2:30:00] without him I can do nothing but see
[2:30:03] that again by the grace of God II knew
[2:30:05] it all before the foundation of the
[2:30:07] world he saw it all before the
[2:30:09] foundation of the world and he come a he
[2:30:11] comes to his knee like any reveal he
[2:30:13] reveals what they need to know in their
[2:30:15] day an hour to get back they may because
[2:30:17] we are his sons and his daughters Amen
[2:30:20] by the grace of God and we're going to
[2:30:22] recognize God we're gonna recognize his
[2:30:24] word a man and I believe it was God
[2:30:27] tonight ministering to us through our
[2:30:28] brother Stephen coffee a man it was able
[2:30:31] as the Lord ministering to his elect
[2:30:33] ministering to his bride giving us
[2:30:35] understanding so we're gonna let go let
[2:30:38] God have his way brothers what we let
[2:30:40] God do ya old I want to do this I want
[2:30:43] to do that I can I can do nothing
[2:30:45] without him just make sure you got him
[2:30:48] and then is revelation in you and
[2:30:51] instead it's Christ living living out
[2:30:53] his life through you by grace a man
[2:30:56] this is that's wonderful I like I like
[2:30:59] what he brought up concern he Adam Adam
[2:31:00] God made Adam he made a male and female
[2:31:03] a man and when Jesus came he was male a
[2:31:07] female yes that's good praise the name
[2:31:09] of the Lord hallelujah see the first
[2:31:13] Adam the second Adam a man but by the
[2:31:16] grace of God the first he fell but that
[2:31:19] God permitted it God knew was going to
[2:31:21] happen but the second one through the
[2:31:24] second one he's gonna bring Redemption
[2:31:26] and turn it all back again praise the
[2:31:28] name of the Lord that that's good
[2:31:30] that's why I pray God did you recognize
[2:31:33] yourself in the second Adam a man
[2:31:36] because in him we'll all live by the
[2:31:39] grace of God a man anytime at heaven and
[2:31:43] earth overlapping praise the name of the
[2:31:45] Lord I trust you got the revelation of
[2:31:47] God of all that was separated now
[2:31:50] brings back together again for the glory
[2:31:52] of God amen as what he has what he
[2:31:56] allowed in the beginning the separation
[2:31:58] at a ESA man that's right
[2:32:01] what was it was revealed himself a man
[2:32:04] that's exactly he got it right in line
[2:32:07] with the Word of God and the revealed
[2:32:09] word that God allowed it and God
[2:32:11] permitted it to reveal himself a man and
[2:32:14] that one that was going to respond would
[2:32:16] be the ones that was like him a man that
[2:32:19] would have his DNA in them would have
[2:32:23] his character and it you know they know
[2:32:25] you know I know that you're born of this
[2:32:28] man or this woman because you look this
[2:32:30] way you act this way you might talk a
[2:32:32] certain way but let's get out of the
[2:32:34] natural into the spiritual so that we're
[2:32:37] going to reflect him that were born of
[2:32:39] by the Holy Ghost
[2:32:41] a man said oh I thought you were
[2:32:45] somebody so-and-so's son
[2:32:47] no I'm the son of God I'm born to the
[2:32:50] Lord Jesus Christ by the grace of God
[2:32:52] and so on because now that's the nature
[2:32:54] he's going to focus on that's the nature
[2:32:56] is going to reflect to the world
[2:32:58] it's Jesus a man you know and and when
[2:33:02] it comes to the natural mother or father
[2:33:04] no no that was born and see him yeah
[2:33:07] that's how I was doomed with their
[2:33:10] nature but now he gave me his nature
[2:33:12] amen praise the name of the Lord that's
[2:33:15] good so consider what our brother is
[2:33:18] preached tonight again amen

[2:35:12] was born
[2:35:13] well I guess I was one of them and
[2:35:17] believers that believe the message
[2:35:19] longer than he then he's been around
[2:35:20] physically you know but again not
[2:35:23] spiritually he's been around a long time
[2:35:25] spiritually by the grace of God but
[2:35:28] physically so the Amen so we thank the
[2:35:32] Lord that for for God anointing him and
[2:35:35] using him to minister to us again Nepal
[2:35:39] as I quoted earlier apologized to you
[2:35:41] young ministers going to take this
[2:35:43] message on to the coming of the Lord and
[2:35:45] he said you got to fill my shoes you got
[2:35:49] to feel he said brother bevels shoes and
[2:35:50] he said because he said we're getting
[2:35:52] old we're gonna go on but he said you
[2:35:54] got to take it off well I didn't realize
[2:35:57] I'd be here at almost 70 years old and
[2:36:01] that I did to be sit and listen to our
[2:36:05] brother Stephen and to minister to me so
[2:36:09] but again there's a there is a
[2:36:11] generation just taking the word on
[2:36:13] the bride on to the coming of the Lord
[2:36:15] taking them right onto the reality of
[2:36:17] the coming taking them right onto the
[2:36:20] reality of the Resurrection the reality
[2:36:22] of the rapture brother sister I pray
[2:36:24] grace that we believe it a man don't
[2:36:27] don't just think is something going to
[2:36:29] happen let's let's see what what's
[2:36:32] happening let's see what God is doing by
[2:36:35] the grace of God and that's why many are
[2:36:37] going to miss it because they failed to
[2:36:40] see what God was doing a man in their
[2:36:42] day they missed the resurrection they
[2:36:45] missed the rapture when it was when God
[2:36:47] was was bringing it to pass a man
[2:36:50] through the revealed word of the hour
[2:36:51] they missed it because they didn't
[2:36:53] recognize it because to them was all
[2:36:55] future future future God's gonna do this
[2:36:57] God's going to do that the Papa said
[2:36:58] God's waiting on you knowing that he
[2:37:01] said that one never comes to the
[2:37:02] resurrection he said the dead in Christ

[2:51:28] I loved the water I loved the one about
[2:51:31] the water and I'll tell you why it
[2:51:33] struck me because a week ago I told
[2:51:37] about a journalist and a week ago I was
[2:51:40] in Halifax and I was coming back on
[2:51:43] Friday it was a beautiful day in Halifax
[2:51:45] and when I got to the airport and called
[2:51:47] Brenda and I said what's the weather
[2:51:49] like and she said it's really windy here
[2:51:51] so right away turbulence right comes to
[2:51:53] my mind and got on the plane and we're
[2:51:56] sitting on the runway and Halifax the
[2:51:57] pilot comes on which is really unusual
[2:51:58] he said really windy and say Jonas I
[2:52:01] said I don't know what it means it's
[2:52:02] really bad because I know what it's like
[2:52:03] I've come in like that sometimes and
[2:52:06] then when we got further up where we got
[2:52:10] flying then coming across and the
[2:52:12] copilot came out and said it's really
[2:52:13] windy in st. Johns I said it's gotta be
[2:52:16] bad so I said Lord I said if you I
[2:52:19] started praying I said lord if you can
[2:52:22] calm the sea that tried to drown you the
[2:52:26] devil tried to drown his brother branham
[2:52:27] said I'm just above to see you can calm
[2:52:31] the wind and when we started getting
[2:52:34] close to st. John's it it shook a little
[2:52:37] bit and then BOOM smooth as silk got to
[2:52:41] the runway and dropped anchor there at
[2:52:44] the gate you know and it's just over the
[2:52:48] froth the plane said a rocking again on
[2:52:50] the runway when I was coming off the
[2:52:52] game-type the wind was blowing right
[2:52:53] across right it was really windy but it
[2:52:56] wasn't windy when we were flying
[2:53:00] so the same as the water right amen amen
[2:53:04] it's wonderful praise the Lord I'm
[2:53:08] following Jesus man it's one step at a
[2:53:11] time I don't have the number praise the
[2:53:14] Lord I just want to thank God for that
[2:53:16] he answers prayers the same yesterday
[2:53:18] today and forever
[2:53:19] you know I'm following Jesus what is
[2:53:29] that water
[2:53:38] praise the Lord Amen sorry what that
[2:53:41] that is that there's always confusion

[2:53:45] at a time it's six or seven hundred and
[2:53:48] some-odd I'm following Jesus one step

[3:11:29] wonderful to worship the Lord amen I was

[3:11:39] Carson if you would come and close in
[3:11:41] prayer tonight remember to pray for the
[3:11:44] service tomorrow night for brother
[3:11:45] Stephen as he brings the Word of God
[3:11:47] amen and just thinking you know and this
[3:11:51] was the Icebreaker right
[3:11:52] can't wait Lamar Lee he meant so let's
[3:11:56] pray for brother Steven pray one for
[3:11:58] another and let's come back to tomorrow
[3:12:02] night expecting anticipating and when
[3:12:05] you do I can tell you it makes my job a
[3:12:07] lot easier and it would make the
[3:12:08] preacher job a lot easier too amen
[3:12:11] because we come expecting that to meet
[3:12:13] with each other but to meet with God so
[3:12:16] I thank God I just think God over 38
[3:12:21] years ago I would not have been here
[3:12:23] I would never considered being here it
[3:12:27] just took a power far greater that which
[3:12:30] was controlling me at the time a power
[3:12:32] far greater and I on I can say this that
[3:12:36] that after I came to the Lord there was
[3:12:40] a a guy I used to work with in the bank
[3:12:44] many years ago you'll remember this old
[3:12:47] friend and he hadn't seen me in years
[3:12:50] and I had come to the Lord and he he
[3:12:53] came to he was brought into this place
[3:12:55] where I was working and hey Singh oh he
[3:12:57] said haven't seen it a lot of time he
[3:12:58] said you and I got to go out on the town
[3:13:00] after work and and one of the guys that
[3:13:04] I worked with you know all about me he
[3:13:06] said above this religious now and after
[3:13:10] about 20 minutes of pure laughter on his
[3:13:12] gun his face you know he just left to
[3:13:14] kill himself and I looked at the other
[3:13:18] guy and he I'll take care of it
[3:13:20] and he took him off to the side and he
[3:13:22] said he's not kiddin you know so that's
[3:13:25] what I was thinking about when you
[3:13:27] speaking about it much being older all
[3:13:31] the things that we went through all that
[3:13:32] God has done for us what our young or
[3:13:34] old what he's taking us out of what he's
[3:13:36] brought us into this is where I want to
[3:13:39] be this is where I wanna be
[3:13:41] amen let's just sing I was born you see
[3:13:45] that's what I'm saying I was born to be
[3:13:48] this right all of us we were born to be
[3:13:51] this a place for God to dwell to be
[3:13:53] pleased to dwell in us right better
[3:13:56] Stephen preached it tonight
[3:13:58] right thank God in the believer this is
