[58:30] The position we stand in. It's the most

[1:00:12] Let your
[1:00:14] people
[1:00:17] again. How many would say that's your
[1:00:20] heart's
[1:00:22] desire? Just a real desire to have a
[1:00:25] special touch from the presence of the
[1:00:27] Lord. And we know that he's here to do
[1:00:30] the exceedingly abundantly above all
[1:00:32] that we could ask or even imagine or
[1:00:35] think. And uh we just feel his presence
[1:00:38] uh so real among us. And it's just good
[1:00:41] to be with believers, brothers and
[1:00:43] sisters of uh precious like faith.
[1:00:47] Uh I I don't know if I don't know if you
[1:00:51] can you can hear exactly what I hear in
[1:00:55] the office, but uh you guys sound like
[1:00:57] angels and uh just enjoyed the worship
[1:01:01] so much and uh just uh such an
[1:01:05] atmosphere created. I believe in this
[1:01:08] atmosphere that God can do anything. I
[1:01:12] believe that God can fill with the Holy
[1:01:14] Ghost. He can refill with the Holy
[1:01:16] Ghost. He He can pour out revelation. He
[1:01:19] can heal the sick and afflicted. I
[1:01:22] believe he can rapture us right now,
[1:01:25] right here, right now in this service. I
[1:01:28] I believe that the limits are taken off
[1:01:30] of God's people that we can believe for
[1:01:32] anything. How many would like to just
[1:01:35] lift your hands and maybe you've got a
[1:01:37] special request on your heart? Why don't
[1:01:40] you just make it known? And why don't we
[1:01:42] just uh surrender ourselves for the word
[1:01:45] right now and say, "Be it unto me
[1:01:48] according to thy word." Father, as the
[1:01:51] songs have been sung, the music has been
[1:01:55] played, the atmosphere is created.
[1:01:59] Father, we feel your presence and we
[1:02:01] know that you're here among us. You
[1:02:04] promised you would be, Lord. Father, we
[1:02:07] believe that we brought you with us,
[1:02:10] Lord. Now, Father, I pray a real special
[1:02:14] outpouring of your spirit upon your
[1:02:17] people for this service. Father, you're
[1:02:20] still the word, the discerner of the
[1:02:23] thoughts and intents of the heart. And
[1:02:26] oh God, I pray that you go to the very
[1:02:28] heart and and search the heart, know
[1:02:32] exactly what each request is. I pray
[1:02:35] that you would minister to every need,
[1:02:38] Lord. Deliver from every spirit of
[1:02:40] oppression, every spirit of
[1:02:43] depression, Lord, every every spirit of
[1:02:46] sickness and discouragement and fear. I
[1:02:50] pray God that you would bring
[1:02:52] encouragement and revival.
[1:02:55] Lord, as we know that we're in the
[1:02:57] spirit of of revival in this last days,
[1:03:01] I pray that you would revive every
[1:03:03] heart. Lord, as these services have been
[1:03:07] set aside for uh this weekend, I pray
[1:03:11] that you would bring such a a moving of
[1:03:13] your spirit to revive every heart. It
[1:03:17] doesn't matter the age, Lord. We just we
[1:03:20] just invite you to come. We invite you
[1:03:24] to take supreme authority and just to
[1:03:28] have preeminence over this service,
[1:03:30] Father. And Lord, move as you seem fit,
[1:03:34] Lord. And God, we would just we we would
[1:03:38] be so pleased if you would just have the
[1:03:41] preeminences and be glorified among us,
[1:03:44] Father.
[1:03:46] Oh God, I pray Lord that you would bless
[1:03:50] every officer, bless our pastor here and
[1:03:53] his family. Oh God, I pray that every
[1:03:57] every member of the body of Christ,
[1:04:00] there's no big ones among us. There's no
[1:04:03] little ones among us. We're all the same
[1:04:06] in Christ. And oh Lord Jesus, we would
[1:04:09] just ask that you would breathe upon us
[1:04:12] this evening. No Lord, just lift us up a
[1:04:17] little higher into that realm, Lord,
[1:04:20] where we can see that all things are
[1:04:23] possible, Lord. Maybe there's some
[1:04:25] situations in people's lives that it
[1:04:28] just are hard to see clearly right now.
[1:04:32] I pray that your spirit would lift them
[1:04:34] above it, Lord. Help them to see it.
[1:04:37] just help them to see the blessings of
[1:04:40] your promises and the realities of your
[1:04:43] presence. Father, we would ask it in the
[1:04:46] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And
[1:04:52] amen. I think that uh the songs have
[1:04:56] been sung and uh we'll just go right
[1:04:59] into the word and uh maybe we'll have uh
[1:05:02] another special for tomorrow. And um but
[1:05:07] we'll turn to second
[1:05:09] Timothy the uh first
[1:05:14] chapter. And uh again, we just want to
[1:05:19] uh say how much we appreciate appreciate
[1:05:22] the invitation to be here and uh
[1:05:25] appreciate your pastor and uh just uh
[1:05:28] getting reacquainted with uh brother
[1:05:31] Jonathan and uh all these years uh you
[1:05:35] know I think it was back in
[1:05:38] 2008 2009 where we met and uh just had a
[1:05:43] wonderful time of fellowship back then
[1:05:45] and uh we've we've just uh we picked up
[1:05:49] right where we left off. It's been a
[1:05:51] wonderful time of fellowship. And uh
[1:05:54] again, we bring greetings from uh our
[1:05:57] pastor, brother Wayne Lawson, and uh and
[1:06:00] the home church there, True Life
[1:06:02] Tabernacle. And also I bring greetings
[1:06:06] from my wife, uh Sister Laura, and she
[1:06:09] would have loved to have come. Uh but uh
[1:06:12] you know uh our daughter has had some uh
[1:06:16] little bit of health problems and uh it
[1:06:18] was just uh best that she stayed home to
[1:06:21] uh be with her and and uh you know uh we
[1:06:25] just uh God knows everything, doesn't
[1:06:28] he? And uh he's he's everything is
[1:06:31] running right on schedule and on time
[1:06:34] and we just trust him. And uh you know,
[1:06:37] we just uh had such a wonderful time uh
[1:06:41] around breakfast this morning and um the
[1:06:44] food was wonderful. I tell you uh you
[1:06:47] sisters can cook and uh that was just a
[1:06:51] wonderful meal and uh so enjoyed the
[1:06:55] wonderful time of fellowship and uh you
[1:06:58] know I I've just been really blessed to
[1:07:01] hear about the history and how the
[1:07:04] church was started and uh just the
[1:07:07] vision for the church and and uh how
[1:07:10] that God has used uh this assembly to uh
[1:07:14] to spread the message and uh then to see
[1:07:17] uh how God has blessed you with this uh
[1:07:20] beautiful building and um you know uh
[1:07:24] you can't outgive God. I I know I I'm
[1:07:28] convinced of that. And uh but you know,
[1:07:32] even greater than uh just the the
[1:07:35] blessings of of having a bigger building
[1:07:38] and what how God's blessed you all, but
[1:07:41] also there's an eternal reward. And uh
[1:07:44] you know, I I believe you uh you cast
[1:07:48] your bread upon the water, it'll return.
[1:07:51] and uh and God has uh I believe that
[1:07:54] there's eternal rewards waiting on the
[1:07:57] other side for this church and all of
[1:07:59] your labors and your efforts and it's
[1:08:01] not in vain. And I I see that there's uh
[1:08:06] uh just you know your your pastor and
[1:08:10] and uh his vision, his love for the
[1:08:12] message of this hour. You're you're a
[1:08:15] blessed uh assembly. uh see uh some of
[1:08:18] these, you know, see these young people
[1:08:21] raising up and uh I just I think that
[1:08:24] it's a tremendous uh vision uh when you
[1:08:29] know the vision's not just going off the
[1:08:31] scene with the elders, but it's
[1:08:33] continuing on with the next generation.
[1:08:36] And I say God bless you for that. And uh
[1:08:40] you know, it's it's no telling what God
[1:08:42] will do. And uh I believe that God's
[1:08:45] still saving. I believe that there's
[1:08:47] still souls to be won uh in the
[1:08:50] community and uh I I believe that uh
[1:08:54] eternal life is what the prophet said.
[1:08:56] It's living for others. Isn't that
[1:08:58] right? And uh so may God just continue
[1:09:02] to bless you is our heart's desire and
[1:09:06] as you labor in his kingdom. But uh
[1:09:10] second Timothy uh the first chapter and
[1:09:14] uh we'll just uh begin uh with verse
[1:09:19] 7 and uh then we would like to also turn
[1:09:23] over to Revelations
[1:09:25] uh the third
[1:09:28] chapter and uh but second Timothy 1 and
[1:09:31] verse 7 uh for God hath not given us the
[1:09:35] spirit of fear but of power and of love
[1:09:40] and of a sound mind.
[1:09:42] Be not thou therefore ashamed of the
[1:09:46] testimony of our Lord, nor of me his
[1:09:49] prisoner, but be thou partaker of the
[1:09:52] afflictions of the gospel, according to
[1:09:56] the power of God, who hath saved us, and
[1:10:00] called us with an holy calling, not
[1:10:03] according to our works, but according to
[1:10:06] his own purpose and grace, which was
[1:10:09] given us in Christ Jesus. before the
[1:10:13] world began. Isn't that beautiful? But
[1:10:15] is now made manifest by the appearing of
[1:10:20] our savior Jesus Christ, who hath
[1:10:23] abolished death and hath brought life
[1:10:26] and immortality to light through the
[1:10:30] gospel. Now, Revelations the 3r
[1:10:35] chapter
[1:10:36] and we're just going to
[1:10:40] uh begin
[1:10:43] reading the 20th
[1:10:49] verse. And we know that at the end of
[1:10:51] each church age, it spoke of the
[1:10:55] overcomer and a blessing upon the
[1:10:58] overcomer. And of course we know that
[1:11:00] this is the Leoysian church age. So
[1:11:03] we're reading the end verse 20. Behold,
[1:11:07] I stand at the door and knock. If any
[1:11:10] man hear my voice and open the door, I
[1:11:14] will come into him and will s with him
[1:11:18] and he with me. To him that overcomemeth
[1:11:22] will I grant to sit with me in my
[1:11:25] throne, even as I also overcame, and am
[1:11:29] set down with my father in his throne.
[1:11:32] He that hath an ear, let him hear what
[1:11:35] the spirit saith unto the churches. And
[1:11:38] may God add his blessings to the reading
[1:11:40] of the word. You can be
[1:11:42] seated. for just a text. I would like to
[1:11:47] uh speak on the spirit of revival. And
[1:11:50] brother Brandham uh would preach the
[1:11:53] sermon, how can I overcome? And this is
[1:11:56] where I'm going to draw my text is out
[1:11:59] of this sermon. But brother Brandham
[1:12:02] would say my subject this morning, how
[1:12:05] can I overcome? He says, 'Now, I chose
[1:12:08] this because that I think that it's a
[1:12:11] time that we should never let the spirit
[1:12:13] of revival die. We've got to keep in
[1:12:16] revival constantly, revived every day.
[1:12:21] Paul said he had to die daily, that
[1:12:23] Christ could live, and we must never let
[1:12:27] that revival die within us. Brother
[1:12:30] Brandham would go on and say that how he
[1:12:34] was crossing an old log the other day
[1:12:36] and how that he was uh he was down in a
[1:12:41] wash or a hollow and he had jumped upon
[1:12:43] this log. He says on the outside it
[1:12:46] looked good. Looked like a big old beach
[1:12:49] log. But when I jumped on it, oh, a
[1:12:52] great chunk of it fell off and it was
[1:12:54] real rotten and dirty. I said that's the
[1:12:57] way Christians are becoming. They've
[1:13:00] been dead in sin and trespasses so long
[1:13:03] till become dirty they they can handle
[1:13:07] no weight at all. They don't know what
[1:13:10] the overcoming means. And I begin to
[1:13:12] think of this text then overcome. Keep
[1:13:16] life in you. When life went out that's
[1:13:19] what brought that log to that condition.
[1:13:22] And it made it worse than ever when it
[1:13:25] laid in the branch where the water was.
[1:13:28] And there you take a Christian that's
[1:13:30] supposed to be a Christian, let the life
[1:13:32] of God go from him. And the experience,
[1:13:35] the joy of serving Christ and living in
[1:13:38] a church where such is going on, he
[1:13:41] rottens twice as quick, right? Living
[1:13:44] right under. If we are trying to follow
[1:13:46] the message of the hour or at least this
[1:13:49] part of the message, we should live
[1:13:51] constantly in the life of Christ. If it
[1:13:55] don't, you lay around and know that
[1:13:58] these things that you're supposed to do
[1:14:00] and don't do it. The Bible said, "He
[1:14:02] that knoweth to do good and doeth it
[1:14:04] not, to him it's sin." Then you become
[1:14:07] doy, rotten when you're se separated
[1:14:10] from the life of God. So strive with all
[1:14:14] that's in you to stay in the life of
[1:14:17] Christ that you would be fruitbearing.
[1:14:20] And I think that is a beautiful reminder
[1:14:24] that in everything that we are going
[1:14:26] through and seeing in this hour of gross
[1:14:29] darkness, but yet we are to live in the
[1:14:33] spirit of revival. And uh we understand
[1:14:37] that uh revival is not adding new
[1:14:40] members to the church, but it is
[1:14:43] reviving that which you already have.
[1:14:46] And so to live in the spirit of revival
[1:14:51] is to die daily that the life of Christ
[1:14:55] can have preeminence in our lives every
[1:14:58] day. And and we're we're living in the
[1:15:03] atmosphere of the supernatural.
[1:15:06] uh the true Christian, the true
[1:15:09] overcomer is living beyond uh just the
[1:15:13] outer court or the holy place. But the
[1:15:17] real overcomer has broke through the
[1:15:20] veil into the holiest of holies. And
[1:15:23] that is the atmosphere of the
[1:15:26] supernatural where the shikina glory is,
[1:15:30] where the spirit of God is, where life
[1:15:33] can take place, where that which was
[1:15:37] once dead can be revived, can be
[1:15:40] refreshed, can can blossom and bring
[1:15:43] forth fresh fruit. And so that is the
[1:15:47] age and the hour that we're living in.
[1:15:50] The true overcomer is to break through
[1:15:54] the veil of his own humanity, his own
[1:15:58] mind, his own thinking, and just uh just
[1:16:02] a church experience, if you will, and
[1:16:05] break through every traditional barrier
[1:16:09] and anything that the devil would try to
[1:16:11] hold us back and and keep us just
[1:16:14] earthbound creatures and break through
[1:16:16] that barrier into the presence of the
[1:16:19] Almighty God. And and that's what we
[1:16:23] desire. Amen. Is to be in the presence
[1:16:26] of God. Not just not just uh once a
[1:16:30] week, two times a week, but every single
[1:16:34] day walking in the presence of God.
[1:16:37] Amen. And so we are a word bride. Amen.
[1:16:42] Aren't you glad to be identified as a
[1:16:45] word bride? And we've been separated
[1:16:48] from just a uh just a church of of
[1:16:52] traditions and and just uh formalities.
[1:16:56] But we are a word bride. And the prophet
[1:17:00] of God would say that we are we have
[1:17:03] come into a word revival. and everything
[1:17:08] that God has promised for this age. Uh
[1:17:12] we are under expectation that God is
[1:17:15] here to fulfill his word. I it's not an
[1:17:19] intellectual revival. Notice how the
[1:17:21] prophet of God and broken sistns he
[1:17:24] would say not as I'm trying to support
[1:17:26] ignorance but I'm trying to tell you the
[1:17:29] difference. Education can never bring
[1:17:32] life. It takes the spirit of God to
[1:17:35] bring life. And that life must not come
[1:17:38] out of just the intellectual revival.
[1:17:41] It's got to come out of the Bible. Word
[1:17:45] revival. And that word is the same
[1:17:48] yesterday, today, and forever. And when
[1:17:52] it falls today and quickens, you get the
[1:17:55] same results you did in Acts two.
[1:17:58] Exactly. It always has and it always
[1:18:02] will be because it's the spirit of God
[1:18:06] that conditions the atmosphere. Amen.
[1:18:09] The prophet of God, Amen, would say it
[1:18:12] takes the spirit of God to bring the
[1:18:16] atmosphere. And it takes atmosphere to
[1:18:20] do things. That's the reason you men are
[1:18:23] always taught bring your children here.
[1:18:26] Brother Brandon would go ahead and say
[1:18:28] that that's why I brought my daughter
[1:18:31] Becky here because she is needing the
[1:18:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost. So, Brother
[1:18:38] Brandham brought his daughter to a place
[1:18:42] where there was an atmosphere for his
[1:18:44] daughter to receive the Holy Ghost.
[1:18:47] Well, if we are in if we're a word bride
[1:18:51] and we are living in a word revival,
[1:18:55] then the church of the living God, the
[1:18:57] place that is consecrated and dedicated
[1:19:01] for God is the place where an atmosphere
[1:19:05] where births can take place, where the
[1:19:08] supernatural can be made manifest. Amen.
[1:19:11] And that's what we've come for. Ain't
[1:19:13] that right? That's why we gather
[1:19:15] together is to put our licks of fire
[1:19:18] together. Amen. You elders who have been
[1:19:21] standing for this message all of these
[1:19:24] years, you you don't want the vision to
[1:19:27] die with you. But you've come to carry
[1:19:30] on the vision that the next crop can
[1:19:33] come and be filled with the same Holy
[1:19:35] Ghost that has brought you into a real
[1:19:39] personal reality with God. That's what
[1:19:42] this word revival is all about because
[1:19:45] Jesus said my word is spirit and it is
[1:19:51] life. Now the prophet of God and things
[1:19:54] that are to be he would say we must live
[1:19:57] by the word because the bride is a part
[1:20:01] of the bridegroom like any wife is a
[1:20:04] part of her husband. Therefore we must
[1:20:07] be that word bride. And what is that
[1:20:11] word bride? The manifestation of this
[1:20:15] hour. The bride not a creed or a
[1:20:17] denomination, but a living oracle of
[1:20:20] God. A living attribute of God
[1:20:23] displaying to the world the attributes
[1:20:26] of God in the formation of the bride
[1:20:29] that's to be expressed in this hour that
[1:20:32] we're now living. The prophet would say
[1:20:34] in the masterpiece, he would say it's
[1:20:37] the word living. and in action, the
[1:20:40] Bible bride, not some man-made bride. In
[1:20:45] the sermon, things that are to be, he
[1:20:48] would say, "And you are nothing but the
[1:20:51] manifestation of the gene of life that
[1:20:54] was in God as a son of God." Now you're
[1:20:58] expressed after his word has come in you
[1:21:02] to light up this age. You are the
[1:21:06] expressing God's life in you because you
[1:21:10] are a son or a daughter of God. And the
[1:21:14] prophet would ask the
[1:21:16] congregation, you get what I mean? See,
[1:21:19] you are now made, you're sitting in this
[1:21:22] church tonight. Now, I want to address
[1:21:25] us tonight. You are sitting in this
[1:21:28] church tonight because your duty is to
[1:21:31] express God to this nation and this
[1:21:35] people and this neighborhood where you
[1:21:38] associate wherever you are. God knew
[1:21:41] that you would be here because you have
[1:21:44] to be one of his genes or his
[1:21:47] attributes. Well, isn't that a beautiful
[1:21:49] thing? Because we find that we were in
[1:21:54] him before the foundation of the world.
[1:21:57] But God knew that you would be here
[1:21:59] under this message to hear this message
[1:22:03] and to express the word for this hour to
[1:22:06] the community around us. Wherever you
[1:22:09] go, a written epistle manifesting Jesus
[1:22:13] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[1:22:16] forever. Then if anyone would ask you,
[1:22:19] where's the revival? Where's the bride's
[1:22:21] revival? Where is there a church that is
[1:22:24] manifesting the power of God in the
[1:22:26] power of his resurrection? And can you
[1:22:29] show me where that place is? You can
[1:22:32] stand there and say, "I am the revival."
[1:22:35] Amen. You don't have to go. I It's not
[1:22:38] just a certain building. It's not just a
[1:22:40] certain address, but you are the
[1:22:43] revival. And so we find the importance
[1:22:47] of living in the spirit of revival
[1:22:51] because wherever you go, you never know,
[1:22:54] amen, when you're expressing that light
[1:22:57] and there will be a predestinated seed,
[1:23:00] amen, that that light shining through
[1:23:02] you comes across their path and that
[1:23:05] light calls out and says, "Show me where
[1:23:07] the revival is." Oh, if I can see God
[1:23:11] that is not just a historical God, but a
[1:23:14] living God in action, you can say,
[1:23:16] "Don't look any further. When you see
[1:23:18] me, you see God in action." When you see
[1:23:22] me, you see the revival fires of the
[1:23:25] Holy Ghost burning in my life. Isn't
[1:23:28] that what this message is all about?
[1:23:31] It's it's a it's to keep the life of God
[1:23:34] flowing within us as individuals. You
[1:23:38] see, it's a it we're we're living under
[1:23:41] a restoration message. Ain't that right?
[1:23:44] It's a message of restoration. And
[1:23:48] Elijah was a restoration prophet. And so
[1:23:52] when when he made that great challenge
[1:23:55] by a vision, not in his own might, not
[1:23:59] in his own efforts, but he he it was a
[1:24:02] he called a Mount Carmel showdown. And
[1:24:05] he and he was going to prove that who's
[1:24:08] God was God. And he told all of the
[1:24:10] prophets, those false prophets of Baal,
[1:24:13] to begin to call upon God. And whoever's
[1:24:17] God answers by fire, let him be God. And
[1:24:21] all throughout the morning into the heat
[1:24:23] of the day, they're screaming and crying
[1:24:26] and cutting themselves. And and but
[1:24:29] there's nothing going on. And there is
[1:24:31] Elijah saying, "Cry out a little bit
[1:24:34] louder. Maybe your God's on vacation."
[1:24:37] He knew what was going to happen. He was
[1:24:40] there by vision. He was there by thus,
[1:24:43] saith the Lord. He knew that God it was
[1:24:48] just waiting the right time that he that
[1:24:52] he would begin to restore the right
[1:24:54] worship and begin to restore the right
[1:24:58] sacrifice and begin to place everything
[1:25:01] in its right proper position for the
[1:25:04] fire of God to fall down. And when he
[1:25:06] said, "Oh Lord, I have done this at thy
[1:25:10] command." And then the fire fell from
[1:25:13] heaven. And then the people responded,
[1:25:16] "Lo, the Lord, he is God. The Lord, he
[1:25:20] is God." Regardless of what Ahab did,
[1:25:24] regardless of that Jezebel system,
[1:25:27] regardless of leading the children of
[1:25:30] Israel into idolatry, but there was a
[1:25:33] prophet that said everything back into
[1:25:35] order that the people could come back
[1:25:38] into the spirit of revival and see the
[1:25:40] power of omnipotence coming among the
[1:25:43] children of Israel again. I say, amen.
[1:25:47] is the same Elijah, the same spirit of
[1:25:50] Elijah that's coming this day. And it's
[1:25:53] not a Mount Carmel showdown. It's a
[1:25:55] Mount Zion showdown. It's a people that
[1:25:58] has been put into position, put back
[1:26:01] into scriptural order for the fire of
[1:26:04] God to fall. And this is not taking us
[1:26:07] back into just another church age. It's
[1:26:10] taking us into the rapture. is taking us
[1:26:12] into the body change uh into the
[1:26:14] marriage and the marriage supper of the
[1:26:16] lamb. Oh church, we are living in the
[1:26:20] spirit of revival where the pillar of
[1:26:22] fire is restored among us. The headship
[1:26:25] of Christ is over the church leading us
[1:26:28] back to the garden of Eden.
[1:26:31] Praise be the name of the Lord. No
[1:26:34] wonder the prophet says to the
[1:26:36] overcomer, "Don't let the spirit of
[1:26:39] revival ever die. Die daily that the
[1:26:43] spirit of Christ could have
[1:26:45] preeminence." Praise the name of the
[1:26:48] Lord. Amen. You see Malachi 4 says that
[1:26:53] I before the uh great and dreadful day
[1:26:56] of the Lord that Elijah shall come and
[1:27:00] restore the faith of the children back
[1:27:05] to the faith of the apostolic fathers.
[1:27:08] We find that in Revelations 10 and1 says
[1:27:11] that all Revelations 10:1 the mighty
[1:27:15] angel comes with an open book. We find
[1:27:18] that at this same time, Revelations
[1:27:21] 10:7, that the mysteries of the entire
[1:27:24] Bible would be revealed. We find that
[1:27:27] the prophet of God would say that this
[1:27:29] messenger of Malachi 4 in Revelations
[1:27:32] 10:7 is going to do two things. One,
[1:27:35] according to Malachi 4, he will turn the
[1:27:38] hearts of the children to the fathers.
[1:27:40] two, he will reveal the mysteries of the
[1:27:43] seven thunders in Revelations 10, which
[1:27:46] are the revelations contained in the
[1:27:48] seven seals. It will be these divinely
[1:27:52] revealed mystery truths that literally
[1:27:54] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:27:56] Pentecostal fathers. Exactly. So, we
[1:28:00] find again, now I'm talking about a word
[1:28:03] revival. I'm talking about a word bride.
[1:28:07] Amen. Joel 2 and 25. I will restore to
[1:28:12] you the years that the locust hath eaten
[1:28:15] and the cankerworm and the caterpillar
[1:28:18] and the palmer worm my great army which
[1:28:21] I sent among you. We find that in the
[1:28:25] restoration of the bride tree. Amen. The
[1:28:28] prophet of God would say, "If four
[1:28:31] messengers of death killed the tree,
[1:28:34] four messengers of life restores the
[1:28:37] tree." Do you get it? For God said, "I
[1:28:41] will restore it." He's going to restore
[1:28:44] it. How? By four death messengers killed
[1:28:48] it. Then four life messengers will
[1:28:50] restore it. What was the first? Martin
[1:28:52] Luther justification. What was the
[1:28:55] second? John Wesley by sanctification.
[1:28:58] What was the third? Pentecost with the
[1:29:00] restoration of the gifts, the Holy
[1:29:02] Ghost, baptism of the Holy Ghost. What
[1:29:05] was the fourth? The
[1:29:07] word. Hallelujah. Amen. Brother Brandham
[1:29:10] would again say in the last days of
[1:29:13] Malachi 4, Elijah is to come with the
[1:29:17] very word. The word of the Lord came to
[1:29:21] the prophet in the evening lights is to
[1:29:24] come forth to restore and bring back
[1:29:27] what turned the hearts of the children
[1:29:30] back to the faith of God forth light.
[1:29:33] Amen. So we find that just as the moon
[1:29:38] reflects the sunlight, the moon has no
[1:29:42] uh no light of her own, no glory of her
[1:29:46] own. But the moon is only uh reflecting
[1:29:50] the light of the sun. And so the moon
[1:29:54] has been put in position by the word of
[1:29:57] God to reflect the light of the sun. And
[1:30:01] I tell you friends, uh amen, sometimes
[1:30:04] we see just a quarter of the moon, don't
[1:30:06] we? And then as it goes along, we see
[1:30:09] half of the moon. And then as time goes
[1:30:13] on, we see three quarters of the moon.
[1:30:16] But you see, we are moved unto the full
[1:30:20] reflection of the vindicated word of the
[1:30:22] hour. Not just partial light, not just
[1:30:25] quarter light, not just justified, not
[1:30:29] just sanctified, not just the
[1:30:31] restoration of the gifts, but we have
[1:30:34] come back into position, full position
[1:30:38] to reflect the fullness of the risen
[1:30:41] resurrected word. The same word that
[1:30:44] went into the grave has been
[1:30:46] resurrected. Hallelujah. Resurrected in
[1:30:49] the fullness of his power. Resurrected
[1:30:52] in his healing with healing in his
[1:30:54] wings. Resurrected to deliver the
[1:30:56] oppressed. To encourage the discouraged.
[1:30:59] To lift up those that are downtrodden.
[1:31:02] Amen. To bring a revival to those uh
[1:31:04] that are crying out with a real thirst
[1:31:07] within your heart saying, "God, refill
[1:31:10] me with the Holy Ghost. I need a
[1:31:12] renewing. I need a refreshing. I need a
[1:31:14] rebaptism. I need to know that I know
[1:31:17] that I've been sealed into the day of
[1:31:18] redemption. I tell you friends, we are
[1:31:21] reflecting the fullness of his power.
[1:31:26] Hallelujah.
[1:31:29] You're right. I don't need a mic, do
[1:31:32] I? If y'all need to turn me off or
[1:31:34] whatever you need to do, I get you too
[1:31:36] excited. I know I do.
[1:31:40] I tell you friends, restored back. The
[1:31:43] prophet of God and the masterpiece says,
[1:31:46] "Now at the harvest time, the seed is
[1:31:50] back to its original life." Back to the
[1:31:55] Bible. Back to its original life. Back
[1:31:59] to the Bible. Amen. the prophet of God
[1:32:02] and it's the rising of the sun says
[1:32:04] there has been churches churches brides
[1:32:07] brides churches brides brides but there
[1:32:10] has got to come one hallelujah there has
[1:32:14] to come a real bride there must come one
[1:32:18] that's not only got the mechanics but
[1:32:21] the dynamics of it makes that church
[1:32:24] live move in the power of his
[1:32:27] resurrection we know the quote how the
[1:32:30] prophet of God says, "What good is it to
[1:32:32] have a Cadillac and it's got the
[1:32:34] fanciest wheels and it's got leather
[1:32:37] seats and it's got diamond studded
[1:32:40] steering wheel? Everything is perfect
[1:32:42] mechanically wise, but it doesn't have a
[1:32:45] spark. The gasoline is in the tank, but
[1:32:49] it doesn't have a spark to make to prove
[1:32:52] that that gasoline is real gasoline.
[1:32:56] That gasoline is the pure octane of the
[1:33:00] of of that gasoline to to to to take it
[1:33:03] down the road. Amen. But you see what it
[1:33:06] needs when that little spark then the ga
[1:33:09] then it proves what you put in the tank
[1:33:11] is real
[1:33:13] gasoline. Hallelujah. But if you put
[1:33:16] gasoline in the car and it's got water
[1:33:19] in it and you've got a spark, it'll
[1:33:22] sputter. Amen. You'll go down the road
[1:33:24] and p putt putt putt backfire and
[1:33:27] everything else. Hallelujah. You see
[1:33:30] what is the spark to do? It is to prove
[1:33:34] that the mechanics is
[1:33:36] right. Hallelujah. We don't need
[1:33:40] education to prove the mechanics. We
[1:33:43] don't need greater education to prove
[1:33:46] the mechanics. We don't need a man
[1:33:50] greater preachers to prove the
[1:33:52] mechanics. But when he, the spirit of
[1:33:55] truth, comes, he will anoint the
[1:33:58] mechanics to prove the spirit of revival
[1:34:02] is here moving in the church to prove
[1:34:05] that the word is in the
[1:34:08] bride. The intelligence has entered into
[1:34:11] the bride and we have thus sayeth the
[1:34:15] Lord. We know what he wants done with
[1:34:18] the word.
[1:34:20] Praise the name of the
[1:34:22] Lord. He wants you to be his hands. He
[1:34:25] wants you to be his mouthpiece. He wants
[1:34:28] to be you to be his temple, his body,
[1:34:30] his tabernacle. He redeemed you for this
[1:34:36] purpose. And in this age, we've been
[1:34:39] restored back into position where every
[1:34:43] believer has a right to the tree of
[1:34:45] life.
[1:34:47] Uh that's the greatest thing that I
[1:34:48] could tell you young people. You have a
[1:34:50] tree. You have a right. It is your
[1:34:52] Godgiven privilege to eat of the tree of
[1:34:56] life. You say, "Oh, if I only knew where
[1:35:00] the tree of life was. If I only knew
[1:35:02] what the tree of life is." The tree of
[1:35:05] life is
[1:35:06] Christ. And he is the
[1:35:09] word. Not just the letter because the
[1:35:12] letter kleth, but the spirit gives life.
[1:35:15] And so he is the word and he is the
[1:35:19] spirit to anoint the word. And when you
[1:35:22] are eating the word and you're saying,
[1:35:24] "Oh God, I want to know you. Show
[1:35:27] yourself to me. Reveal yourself to me.
[1:35:29] Oh God, fill me with the Holy Ghost.
[1:35:32] Revive my spirit." Then he, the Holy
[1:35:36] Ghost, is there to quicken that word.
[1:35:39] And that is the tree of life.
[1:35:43] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:35:45] You see, God don't have any
[1:35:47] grandchildren. How many's heard that one
[1:35:49] before? God doesn't have any
[1:35:52] grandchildren. He has sons and daughters
[1:35:55] of God. Amen. We find that the rich
[1:35:59] young ruler, he he was raised right. His
[1:36:03] mama, his daddy raised him right. Taught
[1:36:06] him the the things of God and and and
[1:36:09] taught him the commandments and and he
[1:36:11] had a good church experience. Amen. But
[1:36:15] yet he was still desiring eternal life.
[1:36:20] Amen. Why did he go to his preacher, his
[1:36:22] priest, and ask him for eternal life?
[1:36:25] Because he knew his preacher didn't have
[1:36:26] it. But he found that there was
[1:36:29] something different about Jesus. because
[1:36:32] she did not speak with just traditions
[1:36:35] and and and fundamentals but there was a
[1:36:38] life there was a power that he was
[1:36:40] reflecting and emanating that he was not
[1:36:43] imminating the church creed he was not
[1:36:46] reflecting the power of Jewish
[1:36:49] religion he was reflecting
[1:36:53] God Jesus said I know where I come from
[1:36:57] and I am here to do my father's
[1:37:00] will I do nothing except the father
[1:37:03] first show it. Hallelujah. So he knew
[1:37:07] that Jesus had contact with the
[1:37:11] supernatural and he said give me eternal
[1:37:14] life. Oh, praise the name of the Lord.
[1:37:17] But you see, amen. When Jesus told him,
[1:37:20] you got to go and and there's there's
[1:37:23] there's one thing that you haven't done.
[1:37:25] You got all the fundamentals just right,
[1:37:28] but there's something that you're
[1:37:29] lacking. You've got one thing that you
[1:37:31] still got to do and that is you got to
[1:37:34] sell out and take up your cross and you
[1:37:37] got to follow me. I tell you friends,
[1:37:41] amen. We've got to stay in the life.
[1:37:44] Amen. We've got to sell out to
[1:37:46] everything. Amen. We've got to give up
[1:37:49] everything. I'm not saying we got to
[1:37:50] live on the streets and we got to be
[1:37:52] beggars and poppers and we can't we
[1:37:54] can't have a good paying job. I'm not
[1:37:56] saying any of that. I'm saying you've
[1:37:58] got to give up the love of the world
[1:38:01] because if you love the world or the
[1:38:03] things of the world, the love of God is
[1:38:05] not in you yet. We're too late. The
[1:38:09] coming of the Lord is at hand. But there
[1:38:11] is those that are hungering and
[1:38:13] thirsting for reality. And to you, I
[1:38:16] say, you shall be filled.
[1:38:20] If there is a thirst for God, then that
[1:38:22] means there is a God to fill you and to
[1:38:26] quench that
[1:38:27] thirst. It's scriptural. You shall be
[1:38:31] filled. Praise the name of the Lord. You
[1:38:35] see, we were born in
[1:38:37] sin, shaped in iniquity. We come into
[1:38:41] the world speaking lies, sinners by
[1:38:44] nature. Amen. That's why Jesus said you
[1:38:47] must be born
[1:38:49] again because without the new birth you
[1:38:54] can't even you can't even see the
[1:38:56] kingdom of
[1:38:57] God. That word see means you can't
[1:39:00] understand the kingdom of
[1:39:02] God. And so there was Jesus in full
[1:39:07] display. The power of God on full
[1:39:11] display. the very thing that they had
[1:39:13] been looking back at what a what what
[1:39:15] Abraham and Moses and all of these
[1:39:20] scriptures and yet there he was the word
[1:39:23] made flesh and they couldn't see him and
[1:39:26] Jesus is saying the reason you can't see
[1:39:28] me is because it takes a real
[1:39:32] supernatural experience with me that's
[1:39:35] why Jesus said that the world isn't
[1:39:38] going to be able to see me but you're
[1:39:40] going to be able to see
[1:39:42] Because God knows that there is a
[1:39:46] predestinated those that God forneew and
[1:39:49] predestinated to be
[1:39:52] believers. As I said last night to meet
[1:39:55] the challenge and say yes Lord I believe
[1:40:00] it. You shall see
[1:40:04] God because the Holy Ghost is for you.
[1:40:08] The Holy Ghost is for the spirit of
[1:40:11] truth shall come to those who are crying
[1:40:14] for
[1:40:15] reality, longing for
[1:40:17] life, longing to see God and to dwell in
[1:40:21] the tabernacle of God and to feel his
[1:40:23] presence and to see his presence and to
[1:40:26] see to see his glory. Amen. Not in just
[1:40:30] not in just church but everyday life. To
[1:40:33] see the power of God on display in their
[1:40:35] life. You see, that's why the the Holy
[1:40:39] Ghost is the sixth
[1:40:41] sense and because it opens the unseen
[1:40:44] world to you and it brings
[1:40:47] reality. What other people can't see,
[1:40:49] yet the Holy Ghost brings a reality.
[1:40:52] Again, the world won't see me, but
[1:40:54] you're going to see me because I'm going
[1:40:56] to be manifested. You're going to see my
[1:40:59] glory. You're going to see the sick
[1:41:01] healed and those that are bound
[1:41:03] delivered. You're going to see the
[1:41:05] alcoholic saved and totally delivered.
[1:41:08] Not because of some 10step program, but
[1:41:11] because of the power of the Holy
[1:41:13] Ghost. You're going to see me. And
[1:41:16] others are going to say, "Ah, there's
[1:41:18] nothing to that." But to those that are
[1:41:21] predestinated to believe, you're going
[1:41:23] to see it.
[1:41:25] And you're not just going to keep it on
[1:41:26] the shelf or keep it with your pastor,
[1:41:28] but and not just keep it in the Bible or
[1:41:31] with the prophet, but you're going to
[1:41:32] see these signs shall follow them that
[1:41:36] believe. And it's not what you're trying
[1:41:38] to manufacture or work up or make
[1:41:41] happen. It's just simply you're writing
[1:41:43] on the promises of God as a word bride.
[1:41:48] You know that it's a scriptural promise
[1:41:50] for this last days.
[1:41:53] You see, it's again supernatural
[1:41:55] atmosphere that brings results. It's an
[1:41:58] atmosphere of believing. It's an
[1:42:00] atmosphere of expecting God to fulfill
[1:42:03] his word. Amen. If you young people
[1:42:06] would get into the atmosphere of just
[1:42:08] believing that God can do it. Amen.
[1:42:11] You're I I'll just say this. There's so
[1:42:13] much pressure upon you young people of
[1:42:15] this age. There's things that that even
[1:42:18] me as a 42 year old man, I I I I I it's
[1:42:22] hard for me to even understand what
[1:42:25] you're going through. We're facing so
[1:42:27] much demonic influence and demonic
[1:42:30] pressure. But I just want to say as a
[1:42:32] witness of one who has come in contact
[1:42:35] with the power of almighty God that if
[1:42:38] you surrender your life and you come
[1:42:40] with that real heartfelt desire to see
[1:42:44] God regardless of what you're going
[1:42:47] through, regardless of the pressures in
[1:42:49] your life, regardless if your mom or
[1:42:52] daddy seem to understand you, regardless
[1:42:55] if your pastor seems to understand you,
[1:42:57] I'd want to say there is a God that
[1:43:00] understands. you. There is a presence of
[1:43:03] almighty God that wants to encourage you
[1:43:06] and strengthen you and to envelop you in
[1:43:09] his presence. He wants to be your
[1:43:15] God. He wants you to know that you're
[1:43:18] sealed away unto the day of
[1:43:20] redemption. He wants you to understand
[1:43:23] him. He wants to reveal himself to you.
[1:43:26] And that's not just to the young. It's
[1:43:28] to the elder. It's to every one of us.
[1:43:32] God has come in this hour to be
[1:43:35] understood by his people. You see, it's
[1:43:38] an atmosphere of believing that this
[1:43:41] promise is unto you and to your children
[1:43:45] and to as many as the Lord our God shall
[1:43:48] call. Then if there's something calling
[1:43:51] to your heart, the Holy Ghost is for
[1:43:53] you. Hallelujah. It's not whether I can
[1:43:57] convince you enough. you know the desire
[1:44:00] of your heart and I'm saying if there's
[1:44:02] a deep calling into the deep and there's
[1:44:05] something pricking your heart then I'd
[1:44:07] say the Holy Ghost is for you but let's
[1:44:10] just take it a little bit further maybe
[1:44:12] you've been a Christian for 20 years 30
[1:44:14] years 40 years 50 years and you need a
[1:44:18] real refreshing of the Holy Ghost David
[1:44:21] did not say let me be saved again he
[1:44:25] said restore unto me the joy of thy
[1:44:29] salvation. Oh friends, sometimes we go
[1:44:32] days and weeks and months uh and it can
[1:44:35] even turn into years. Uh and what we
[1:44:38] need, we've not lost our salvation, but
[1:44:41] we need a restoring of the joy of what
[1:44:46] has been about all of these
[1:44:49] years. Why do we believe this message?
[1:44:51] Why are we standing for this vindicated
[1:44:53] word? Why do we believe that the angel
[1:44:56] of the Lord took his picture over our
[1:44:58] prophet? Why do we believe seven angels
[1:45:01] took his picture of there on Sunset
[1:45:04] Mountain? What is it? Here's a joy that
[1:45:07] has been brought into the heart of the
[1:45:09] real true elect in this day to know we
[1:45:13] passed from death unto life.
[1:45:19] Hallelujah.
[1:45:20] Not man-made, not worked up, but it's
[1:45:24] the joy of our
[1:45:27] salvation. Am I yelling too much? Am I
[1:45:30] hurting your ears? You forgive me. I'm
[1:45:34] sorry. I'm be beside myself. Oh, God, I
[1:45:38] love you. You see, every
[1:45:41] generation has the right to their own
[1:45:43] revival,
[1:45:46] to eat of the original mana.
[1:45:49] Every preacher, every mama, every boy,
[1:45:54] every girl has a right to go into the
[1:45:56] Holiest of Holies and eat of the
[1:45:59] original mana. You don't have to just
[1:46:02] worry about the mana that's falling on
[1:46:04] the
[1:46:05] outside. Hallelujah. They get stagnated
[1:46:08] and stale and full of wiggle tails. You
[1:46:11] know what that is?
[1:46:12] Wiggle. Have you ever been I ever every
[1:46:16] every once in a while, you know, you can
[1:46:17] go into a pantry and something that's
[1:46:19] sealed off and closed up and and and
[1:46:21] it's been there long enough, you'll find
[1:46:25] little what I call wiggle tails. And
[1:46:28] you're thinking, "How in the world did
[1:46:30] they get in there?" You see, that's the
[1:46:33] reason that Israel was taught, don't
[1:46:37] just try to store up mana and try to
[1:46:40] carry it over to the next day.
[1:46:42] You only take enough for what you can
[1:46:45] eat for this day because God's got
[1:46:47] something else for you
[1:46:49] tomorrow. Which was a type of the seven
[1:46:52] church ages that every age had a new
[1:46:56] message. But in this
[1:46:58] day, this word was not taking us into
[1:47:03] just another church age. But this
[1:47:06] message was taking us into the holiest
[1:47:08] of
[1:47:09] holies where the veil shut behind you
[1:47:13] where there was blood upon the mercy
[1:47:15] seat where the shikina glory came to
[1:47:18] identify with the sacrifice where the
[1:47:21] Aaron's rod which was dead cut off from
[1:47:24] the life source but in the presence of
[1:47:27] the holiest of holies they was bringing
[1:47:30] forth fruit.
[1:47:32] That's the spirit of revival that we
[1:47:35] have been brought
[1:47:38] into. And we are dying daily to stay in
[1:47:43] that
[1:47:44] life. You see, we've got to because
[1:47:48] we're under a pressure like we've never
[1:47:50] been
[1:47:51] under. I'm not talking about
[1:47:53] government. I I'm not talking about
[1:47:55] threats of shutting our churches down.
[1:47:58] I'm not talking about this great great
[1:48:00] squeeze where people hate us and and
[1:48:03] we're and we're running for our lives.
[1:48:06] I'm talking about spirits of
[1:48:08] oppression. Spirits that are trying to
[1:48:10] keep you from revelation. Spirits that
[1:48:14] are trying to keep you from your prayer
[1:48:15] life. Spirits trying to keep you, Amen,
[1:48:19] discouraged and stressed and nervous.
[1:48:22] And you don't know what you don't you
[1:48:24] don't even know why you're so nervous.
[1:48:27] so much tension and stress and and chaos
[1:48:30] and yet everything seems to be fine.
[1:48:32] It's the spirit of the
[1:48:34] age and Satan is wanting to take us from
[1:48:38] the life of God. He's wanting to keep us
[1:48:41] from his presence. He's wanting to keep
[1:48:44] us, amen, from that daily consecrated
[1:48:47] walk with God. He doesn't want us to be
[1:48:50] able to bear up under the pressure. He
[1:48:52] wants to take our joy. He wants to take
[1:48:55] our peace. He wants to take our
[1:48:57] satisfaction in
[1:49:01] Christ. It's not just in the United
[1:49:04] States. It's not just in Canada. It's
[1:49:07] around the
[1:49:09] world. It's a spirit of the last days
[1:49:13] trying to make us neurotics and nervous
[1:49:16] and tense. But I say there is a spirit
[1:49:19] of revival.
[1:49:22] I say that the Holy Ghost is still being
[1:49:25] poured out to refresh you because he
[1:49:28] promised in the last days it'll be word
[1:49:31] upon word here a little, there a little,
[1:49:34] and it'll be word upon word upon word,
[1:49:36] sale upon sale, gene upon gene. And in
[1:49:40] the last days, he would pour out the
[1:49:42] spirit of refreshing. And it would be
[1:49:45] straight from the presence, the throne
[1:49:47] of God. And it will refresh us in the
[1:49:49] time of real
[1:49:53] need. Hallelujah. Am I preaching to
[1:49:57] someone? A refreshing. He knows what we
[1:50:01] have need of. And in the time of great
[1:50:04] need, to be refreshed, to be renewed, to
[1:50:07] be encouraged. God promised to pour out
[1:50:10] the Holy
[1:50:12] Ghost. It'll be the very thing that
[1:50:14] refreshes us. like in a a hot hot I know
[1:50:19] now I know you don't know what I'm
[1:50:21] talking you know what those that Texas
[1:50:23] heat amen when you're sweating and
[1:50:26] you're working and you poured out and it
[1:50:28] seems like you're you just salt all over
[1:50:31] you sweat stained all over your clothes
[1:50:34] amen you just go outside sometimes in
[1:50:36] the humidity and you just break out into
[1:50:38] a
[1:50:39] sweat I'm talking about that southern
[1:50:42] humidity and southern heat and it can be
[1:50:45] miserable
[1:50:46] and you're just thinking, you don't want
[1:50:47] Coke, you don't want Pepsi, you don't
[1:50:50] want orange juice, you just want a good
[1:50:54] cold drink of refreshing water and say,
[1:50:58] "Oh yes, if I could just down me some
[1:51:01] good old refreshing water and you just
[1:51:04] feel like like you can live. Oh, that's
[1:51:07] what God has provided us in this day is
[1:51:10] refreshing water." And if you're
[1:51:12] thirsting for the water, if there's a
[1:51:14] painful thirst for the water, I'm
[1:51:16] talking I'm talking about through the
[1:51:18] Holy Ghost fil, but there's still a a
[1:51:21] thirst, a longing for more of
[1:51:24] God, that it's for you. It's for you.
[1:51:29] Oh, praise the name of the Lord. You
[1:51:32] see, the prophet of God would say that
[1:51:34] any birth is a mess.
[1:51:38] I don't care what it's at. If it's in
[1:51:40] the pig pin or a hospital, a birth is a
[1:51:43] mess. So is the new birth. It'll make
[1:51:46] you do things you didn't think you would
[1:51:47] do. It'll make you get down at the altar
[1:51:50] and cry and scream and wash the pain off
[1:51:52] your face and raise your hands, praise
[1:51:54] God, speak in tongues, and all kinds of
[1:51:56] things. The new birth will do that
[1:51:58] because it's God's provided way to be
[1:52:01] born again. You have to die. You have to
[1:52:05] die before you can be reborn. Any seed
[1:52:08] has to die before it's regenerated
[1:52:10] again. Unless it dies, it abides alone.
[1:52:13] A man has got to die to his own
[1:52:15] thinking. He's got to die to the
[1:52:18] thinking of anything but God's word and
[1:52:21] come his way, God's way. That's God's
[1:52:24] ground. We don't meet him on our
[1:52:27] thoughts. We meet him on what he said
[1:52:30] do. That's God's provided way for it.
[1:52:33] People dodge it. They don't want it. But
[1:52:35] it's true just the same. It'll produce
[1:52:38] it produces death and you have to die.
[1:52:41] Die to your thinking. Again, that's
[1:52:44] God's provided way for this day. In 64
[1:52:47] again, the prophet and why in 63 he
[1:52:49] says, "But before you can ever get
[1:52:52] right, you have to come through that
[1:52:55] mess." Hallelujah. It's a mess, but it
[1:52:58] brings life. I tell you, sometimes we
[1:53:02] need that even in our refreshing. Amen.
[1:53:05] Just come back to that real simplicity
[1:53:09] and say, "Lord, renew me and refresh
[1:53:12] me." Sometimes in the spirit of revival,
[1:53:16] you got to start digging down in your
[1:53:18] life. Sometimes there's things that's
[1:53:20] blocking the spirit of revival. Amen. We
[1:53:24] find that one of the kings, Ahab's sons,
[1:53:28] amen, a backsliden king, and he got a
[1:53:32] couple more kings, Jehoshaphat. And it's
[1:53:34] just coming to my mind. Amen.
[1:53:36] Jehoshaphat and another king. And they
[1:53:39] they went seven days journey, amen,
[1:53:42] through the desert. And they're going to
[1:53:43] go attack Moab. Amen. They're going to
[1:53:46] go take back the land that belonged to
[1:53:49] Israel. Amen. They went seven days
[1:53:53] journey, but they ran out of water. And
[1:53:56] there they are in the heat in the
[1:53:59] desert, and they're thinking they're all
[1:54:01] going to perish, and they're all going
[1:54:03] to die. Amen. But it was about that time
[1:54:06] that Jehoshaphat says, "Surely there's a
[1:54:09] prophet somewhere." And one of the men
[1:54:12] said that
[1:54:14] Elisha lives in such and such a place
[1:54:17] right over the way. And they said, "Go
[1:54:20] get him." And so they went and got
[1:54:23] Elijah. Amen. Which had uh the same
[1:54:26] anointing that was on Elijah is now upon
[1:54:30] Elisha. And Elijah comes before the king
[1:54:34] and the kings and and he gets all worked
[1:54:38] up and gets angry. Amen. Because of of
[1:54:42] of Ahab's son. Amen. There. and he sees
[1:54:46] him and says, "If I would have known it
[1:54:48] was you, I wouldn't have even come." He
[1:54:51] said, "But because of Jehoshaphat, I'll
[1:54:54] come. Someone give me a
[1:54:56] minstrel." Hallelujah. They get him a
[1:54:59] minstrel and he begins to play. I like
[1:55:01] what the prophet says. He says, "Maybe
[1:55:03] you can't be the prophet, but maybe you
[1:55:06] can be the
[1:55:07] minstrel." Oh, praise the name of the
[1:55:10] Lord. Maybe you can bring be the
[1:55:13] minstrel that changes the atmosphere
[1:55:16] because the atmosphere needed to be
[1:55:18] changed so the prophet could could see a
[1:55:21] word from the Lord and speak. And I tell
[1:55:24] you friends, uh, if you can't be the
[1:55:26] preacher, if you can't be the song
[1:55:28] leader, if you can't be the trustee, if
[1:55:30] you can't be the pastor, then just be a
[1:55:32] minstrel and be a vessel that can bring
[1:55:36] forth praise and glory and honor and
[1:55:38] create an atmosphere that the word of
[1:55:41] God can come forth and speak to your
[1:55:43] needs, speak to your life. I tell you,
[1:55:47] all of a sudden, the word came to Elijah
[1:55:50] and he says, "Make this valley full of
[1:55:54] ditches." And as as those men begin to
[1:55:58] get their shovels out and they begin to
[1:56:01] dig and the prophet of God would Amen
[1:56:03] would begin to just bring it out, you
[1:56:06] know, in a in a story and and say that
[1:56:09] maybe they're digging down a little bit
[1:56:10] and maybe they hid an old can and maybe
[1:56:14] it's tobaca or something. Maybe it's
[1:56:15] some cigarettes or maybe it's some some
[1:56:18] worldliness, whatever that is. And you
[1:56:20] got to dig it out because as d as deep
[1:56:23] as you can dig is as much water as you
[1:56:26] can have. That's a promise. Amen. If you
[1:56:30] find there's some pride, get it out.
[1:56:32] Don't stop there. Don't stop on top of
[1:56:35] that pride and say, "Well, I can't go
[1:56:36] any further." Dig it out. You go down
[1:56:39] and you find there's some jealousy
[1:56:41] that's sitting there. It jealousy is a
[1:56:42] spirit. You got to dig it out. Get rid
[1:56:45] of it. Because if you get rid of it,
[1:56:48] you're going to have more of the Holy
[1:56:49] Ghost in your life. You go down and find
[1:56:52] there's some envy there. There's some
[1:56:54] Amen. There's some things in your life.
[1:56:56] But I tell you, when you surrender it
[1:56:58] all to God, it becomes an unlimited
[1:57:01] revival of the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:57:05] flowing through your life. That's what I
[1:57:08] want. I want the spirit of revival to
[1:57:12] have
[1:57:13] preeminence that everything is out of my
[1:57:15] heart and out of my life and God is
[1:57:19] having the liberty to just keep pouring
[1:57:21] it in, pouring it in, pouring it
[1:57:25] in. Do you realize the prophet of God
[1:57:28] says purgatory? He said, "I believe in
[1:57:29] purgatory." He said, "Not the way the
[1:57:31] Catholics were. Not the way the
[1:57:34] Catholics preach it." He says, "But I
[1:57:36] believe in purging our souls daily by
[1:57:40] the blood of Jesus Christ to keep the
[1:57:43] spot of sin off of our garments. You've
[1:57:47] got to die daily and stay covered by the
[1:57:51] blood of Jesus Christ." Remember the
[1:57:54] prophet of God says you were saved
[1:57:57] before the foundation of the world.
[1:57:59] Amen. The blood of Jesus does not save
[1:58:01] you. You are already saved. The blood of
[1:58:04] Jesus keeps you
[1:58:08] clean to keep the move of the Holy Ghost
[1:58:12] flowing in our lives to keep the word
[1:58:16] fresh in our lives that we can feed
[1:58:19] daily upon that shoe bread. Hallelujah.
[1:58:25] Can I go a little bit further? You see,
[1:58:28] the only way to overcome is by the Holy
[1:58:31] Ghost.
[1:58:33] When you can look at the scripture and
[1:58:34] say greater is he that is in me than he
[1:58:38] that is in the
[1:58:40] world. What is that which is greater is
[1:58:44] God. You see and how can I overcome?
[1:58:47] Brother says overcome means to stand the
[1:58:50] test. He says that's what the old saints
[1:58:53] did. They stood the test. You got to
[1:58:57] stand the test like Jesus did amidst all
[1:59:00] of his enemies. He stood the test.
[1:59:02] Everything he was tested against, he
[1:59:05] stood it. In the very face of sickness
[1:59:08] and him being Messiah, he healed them.
[1:59:11] In the face of death, he brought it back
[1:59:13] to life. In the face of Calvary, his own
[1:59:16] death, he defeated it by surrendering
[1:59:18] himself. Why? By the word said, you
[1:59:21] destroy this temple and I'll raise it up
[1:59:23] in three days. The word said so. And in
[1:59:26] the presence of death, he defeated it.
[1:59:29] He overcome death. In the presence of
[1:59:31] hell, he defeated hell and overcome
[1:59:33] hell. In the presence of the grave, he
[1:59:36] overcome the grave. All by the word and
[1:59:39] humility. There's the real man. There's
[1:59:43] the one to make your example. He
[1:59:45] defeated everything. Overcome it. Look,
[1:59:49] temptation was for him. You know that
[1:59:52] the Bible said he was tempted in all
[1:59:54] points like we are, yet without sin. He
[1:59:57] was tempted by drinking. He was tempted
[2:00:00] by women. He was tempted by everything
[2:00:03] that could be tempted by. He was tempted
[2:00:05] by everything that we are. He was a man
[2:00:09] and yet you couldn't put a mark on him.
[2:00:12] That's the real
[2:00:15] overcomer because he had his
[2:00:18] place where he was overshadowed by the
[2:00:21] Holy Ghost. And immediately after
[2:00:24] receiving the Holy Ghost, the spirit led
[2:00:26] him into the wilderness to be temp
[2:00:28] tempted by the
[2:00:30] devil. The prophet of God says that that
[2:00:34] what the very same temptation that Eve
[2:00:37] faced in the
[2:00:39] garden, the very thing that she was
[2:00:42] faced with and she reasoned and doubted
[2:00:44] the word of God and it threw the whole
[2:00:46] human race under a curse.
[2:00:49] Jesus came right back under that same
[2:00:52] temptation and stood there and said, "It
[2:00:55] is written. It is written. It is
[2:00:57] written." What was he doing? He was
[2:01:00] showing how a true Holy Ghost believer
[2:01:03] overcomes in this age. Because not in
[2:01:06] Luther's age, not in Wesley's age, not
[2:01:08] the Pentecostal age, but this age, we
[2:01:11] are faced with the same temptations. The
[2:01:14] pride of life, the lust of the flesh,
[2:01:16] the lust of the eyes. We are faced with
[2:01:20] the same
[2:01:22] temptation and we overcome. Listen young
[2:01:26] people, listen church, we overcome by
[2:01:30] the word. We are a word bride. We are we
[2:01:36] see our position in the
[2:01:39] word and without that we'll be swept
[2:01:44] away. Without that, without his word
[2:01:48] made life to us, we'll just
[2:01:51] rot. Hallelujah. We'll look good on the
[2:01:54] outside, but we'll just rot away because
[2:01:58] we can't take the pressure. Oh, brothers
[2:02:00] and sisters, I cannot convey that
[2:02:02] enough. the power, the grace of God that
[2:02:05] has been given to the church to be able
[2:02:07] to stand up under the
[2:02:10] pressures by the spirit of
[2:02:14] God bringing this word word by word and
[2:02:19] quickening to our hearts. You see,
[2:02:22] overcoming now you got to overcome means
[2:02:25] to recognize the devil in every one of
[2:02:27] his tricks. Oh, the devil, he's a
[2:02:30] deceiver, isn't he? He's tricky. He's a
[2:02:34] shyer. He's sly. But you got to
[2:02:36] understand, you got to recognize the
[2:02:38] devil. And you got to recognize all of
[2:02:40] his
[2:02:41] tricks. Lots of people says there is no
[2:02:44] devil. It's just a thought. Don't you
[2:02:47] believe that? There is a real devil.
[2:02:50] He's just as real as you are or anybody.
[2:02:52] A real devil. And you must recognize him
[2:02:54] real. You must know he's a devil. Then
[2:02:58] the same time that you recognize him and
[2:03:00] know that he's a devil and he's against
[2:03:03] you. Elders, can I get a witness? He's
[2:03:06] against
[2:03:08] us. Young people, you found out he's
[2:03:11] against you. Every gun from hell is
[2:03:16] pointed at
[2:03:17] you. He's the real devil. He's a real
[2:03:20] power and he's against you. But at the
[2:03:23] same time, you realize he's a real devil
[2:03:26] and there's a real power and he's trying
[2:03:28] to destroy you. Then you recognize that
[2:03:32] to overcome, you must recognize that the
[2:03:34] God in you is greater and mightier than
[2:03:38] he
[2:03:39] is. That the one that's in you has
[2:03:42] already overcome
[2:03:45] him. And by his grace, you are more than
[2:03:48] a match for him. There is real
[2:03:51] overcoming. When you
[2:03:53] recognize the very moment that you
[2:03:56] recognize, yes, the devil's real. Yes,
[2:03:59] he's a real power. Yes, he's trying to
[2:04:02] destroy me. But greater is he that is in
[2:04:05] me than he that's in the world. That's
[2:04:07] the moment you've already overcome.
[2:04:10] You can still be facing pressure, still
[2:04:13] be facing spirits of oppression,
[2:04:15] depression, anxiety, nervousness, every
[2:04:19] kind of spirit from hell. But when you
[2:04:22] realize that greater is the Holy Ghost
[2:04:25] that's in you than the than that demon
[2:04:28] that's against you, you have already
[2:04:34] overcome. The prophet of God says,
[2:04:36] "You've come too late to tell me there's
[2:04:38] not a real devil.
[2:04:41] He says there are two powers and that's
[2:04:42] God's power and Satan's
[2:04:44] power. He says I He says I run headlong
[2:04:49] into him every
[2:04:51] day. Don't tell me there's no devil
[2:04:54] because I know
[2:04:55] better. It says I have to fight with him
[2:04:58] every day so I know there's a devil. And
[2:05:00] you must be trained when you meet him.
[2:05:02] Not trained in psychology, not trained
[2:05:04] in education, but trained by the Holy
[2:05:06] Spirit. God's power in his word to make
[2:05:09] it
[2:05:10] manifest. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:05:13] You see, Jesus broke through the veil.
[2:05:15] Now, let's just talk about our overcomer
[2:05:17] for just a few moments.
[2:05:20] Jesus broke through the veil, the mighty
[2:05:23] conqueror, and he broke into the holiest
[2:05:26] of holies. He sacrificed himself for us.
[2:05:30] Even when in the garden of Gethsemane
[2:05:33] his his sweat turned into great drops of
[2:05:35] blood because his because he was in such
[2:05:39] great agony and truly that's where he
[2:05:41] died was when he was in that garden.
[2:05:44] That's where he died to himself, died to
[2:05:47] his will, died to his humanity. Father,
[2:05:50] let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless,
[2:05:52] thy will be done. And he did it for you
[2:05:53] and I. And when he went to the Calvary,
[2:05:57] Amen. And the veil was rent. the temple
[2:06:00] veil, the veil in the natural which was
[2:06:04] keeping only the high priest could go
[2:06:06] into beyond that veil once a year. And
[2:06:09] anyone else that tried to go into the
[2:06:11] presence of God would die because there
[2:06:14] was a curse upon the human race. But God
[2:06:17] in his mercy had been giving a type that
[2:06:20] when the high priest would take the
[2:06:22] blood of an innocent sacri a sacrifice
[2:06:25] and and he would go beyond the veil into
[2:06:28] the holiest of holies and he would offer
[2:06:31] the blood of that innocent substitute
[2:06:35] for the sins of the whole congregation.
[2:06:38] And when the shikina glory dropped down
[2:06:40] upon that uh into that holies of holies,
[2:06:43] he was identifying recognizing that
[2:06:46] covenant and declaring that their sins
[2:06:49] were rolled ahead, forgiven another
[2:06:52] year. But it was only prophecy, only a
[2:06:56] foreshadow of when the true lamb of God
[2:07:00] was offered up as a sacrifice and he
[2:07:03] broke through the
[2:07:05] veil. Hallelujah.
[2:07:08] And God, as a witness, God took his
[2:07:12] sword and cut the veil from the top to
[2:07:16] the
[2:07:17] bottom, showing that it wasn't a man
[2:07:19] that was doing it. It wasn't a man that
[2:07:22] was redeeming you. It was not a man with
[2:07:24] all of his creeds and dogmas and
[2:07:26] traditions and psychology redeeming you.
[2:07:30] It was the pure blood of God that was
[2:07:35] shed on Calvary that broke through the
[2:07:38] veil to declare you are holy.
[2:07:43] You the curse of sin has been broke off
[2:07:46] of your life. It used to be death to go
[2:07:49] into the holiest of holies. Now is death
[2:07:51] not to go into the holiest of
[2:07:53] holies because God rich in mercy
[2:07:56] restored us back into the presence of
[2:07:59] God that we can stay continually in the
[2:08:02] spirit of
[2:08:05] revival. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:08:08] You see, redeem is to buy
[2:08:10] back. Amen. And we're purchased by the
[2:08:13] blood of
[2:08:14] God. And you are not your own because
[2:08:17] you have been brought bought with a
[2:08:19] price. I've got a lot of scriptures
[2:08:21] here, but I can't go into them for sake
[2:08:23] of time. But you see, Paul would say
[2:08:26] that know ye not that your body is the
[2:08:28] temple of
[2:08:30] God, the temple of the Holy Ghost which
[2:08:34] is in you, and you are not your
[2:08:37] own. You are
[2:08:40] God's. What is he declaring? That the
[2:08:44] curse of the fall has been taken off of
[2:08:48] your life.
[2:08:50] Amen. I know sometimes the devil tries
[2:08:53] to beat us up with generational
[2:08:55] curses and say, "Well, you know, my my
[2:09:00] great greatgrandfather and my
[2:09:02] grandfather and my daddy and now I've
[2:09:06] got
[2:09:06] it." And he tries to he tries to
[2:09:10] convince you that you're
[2:09:14] cursed. Hallelujah.
[2:09:17] He tries to convince you you've got to
[2:09:19] have sugar diabetes because it runs in
[2:09:21] your family.
[2:09:23] While the doctor, you go to the doctor
[2:09:24] and the doctor tries to say, "Well, your
[2:09:26] symptoms are these. Do you have do you
[2:09:28] have any history in your family that
[2:09:32] that that they have heart attacks? They
[2:09:35] have cancer. They What is he doing? He's
[2:09:38] trying, Amen. to go through your life
[2:09:41] and and and and if they've got it, it's
[2:09:43] a good it's a good evidence that you've
[2:09:46] got
[2:09:48] it. And the devil will sell you that.
[2:09:53] And the moment that you believe that,
[2:09:56] then you are signing for a curse.
[2:10:01] But the blood of Jesus Christ destroyed
[2:10:04] the
[2:10:06] curse. By one man's disobedience, we
[2:10:10] fell under the curse. But one by one
[2:10:13] man's obedience, the curse was broke off
[2:10:16] of our life
[2:10:18] forever. And now the Holy Ghost has been
[2:10:22] has res has returned to the believer to
[2:10:25] bear witness. The covenant is
[2:10:28] enforced. The covenant which is the
[2:10:31] spotless lamb of God, Jesus Christ. The
[2:10:34] covenant between God and man, the
[2:10:37] covenant is in full
[2:10:39] strength. The Holy Ghost is here to
[2:10:42] enforce the covenant, declaring you do
[2:10:46] not belong to the devil. You are not
[2:10:48] under a curse. You are under life.
[2:10:53] Thank you, Lord.
[2:10:56] Hallelujah.
[2:10:58] You don't have to fear death. For if the
[2:11:01] same spirit that raised Christ from the
[2:11:03] dead dwell in you, it shall also quicken
[2:11:06] your mortal
[2:11:08] body. You don't have to fear cancer. You
[2:11:11] don't have to fear sugar diabetes. You
[2:11:13] don't have to fear depression. You don't
[2:11:14] have to fear some hormone problems. You
[2:11:17] are under a sentence of
[2:11:20] life. Thank you, Lord. And as long as
[2:11:24] Satan can get you to believe that you're
[2:11:26] still fallen, can get you to believe
[2:11:28] that you've got to just sign up for it
[2:11:31] and accept it, then that is the moment
[2:11:34] that you are back under a curse. But to
[2:11:37] that elected, there is a revival for
[2:11:41] you. Come out of that
[2:11:43] curse. Come out of that thing that the
[2:11:46] devil has got you signing your name for
[2:11:49] it. Send it back to send her and say, "I
[2:11:53] refuse to sign for it. I am a
[2:11:55] bloodbought bornagain son and daughter
[2:11:58] of God. I name is written on the lamb's
[2:12:01] book of life. I am healed. I am
[2:12:04] delivered. I am filled and sealed unto
[2:12:07] the day of
[2:12:10] redemption." Don't you accept no
[2:12:12] generational curse in your
[2:12:15] life? Refuse to accept that thing.
[2:12:19] The blood of Jesus Christ breaks the
[2:12:21] yoke of sin. Breaks the yoke of
[2:12:24] condemnation.
[2:12:26] Hallelujah. It was the devil that
[2:12:29] enticed Israel to sign up for
[2:12:33] law. It was something that they could
[2:12:35] do. I tell you friends, it's the devil
[2:12:38] that always will come to the real true
[2:12:41] elect, Abraham's seed and then talk you
[2:12:45] back into going after works and well,
[2:12:49] I've got to do this and if I don't do it
[2:12:50] just right, then I'm not a son of God.
[2:12:52] And and we get our check our little our
[2:12:55] little checklist and I've done this and
[2:12:58] I've done that and I've done that. Let
[2:13:00] me remind you that's what that's what
[2:13:02] that rich young ruler, he checked them
[2:13:05] all off. I've done it ever since I was a
[2:13:07] youth. I know church order. I don't chew
[2:13:10] gum in church. I don't pass notes in
[2:13:12] church. I know everything just right. I
[2:13:15] know how. But the prophet of God did not
[2:13:18] send church order to bind up the Holy
[2:13:20] Ghost. He came to protect the church
[2:13:23] from a bunch of carnal
[2:13:26] impersonations. But that does not mean
[2:13:28] we cannot allow the Holy Ghost to have
[2:13:30] preeminences in our church service. I
[2:13:32] say let the tears roll. Let this not
[2:13:35] come. Let a Holy Ghost uh move of God
[2:13:39] come and know that we've been born
[2:13:43] again.
[2:13:44] Hallelujah. Don't be scared of it. If
[2:13:47] there's if there's just one of you that
[2:13:49] needs a new birth, don't you be scared
[2:13:51] of the new
[2:13:52] birth. Hallelujah. No one's going to
[2:13:55] mock you. You're among friends. No one's
[2:13:58] going to ridicule you and say you're a
[2:13:59] holy roller. Especially when the prophet
[2:14:01] of God preached a sermon of why I am a
[2:14:04] holy roller. Hallelujah. We believe in
[2:14:07] the power and the moving of the Holy
[2:14:09] Ghost. Praise the name of the Lord. Am I
[2:14:11] out of order? Maybe I'm out of order.
[2:14:13] Hallelujah. But I believe it. I believe
[2:14:16] in life. I believe that's what our young
[2:14:19] people need. I believe that's what every
[2:14:22] one of us needs. Amen. A refreshing and
[2:14:25] renewing and a fresh visitation for the
[2:14:27] presence of Almighty God.
[2:14:30] Hallelujah. Amen. The Holy Ghost, when
[2:14:33] it comes, it'll enforce that you're no
[2:14:36] longer in the pawn
[2:14:38] shop. Hallelujah. When we were sold
[2:14:41] under sin, we were sold in Satan's pawn
[2:14:44] shop. Hallelujah. And the devil could
[2:14:47] the devil could mock us. He could
[2:14:50] ridicule us. He could laugh at us. He
[2:14:53] could tell us all kinds of things
[2:14:56] because because we were sold under sin.
[2:14:59] But when Jesus Christ redeemed us, he
[2:15:02] took us out of the pawn shop.
[2:15:04] Hallelujah. You know why you can redeem
[2:15:07] something out of the pawn shop? Because
[2:15:08] it once belonged to you. Praise the name
[2:15:11] of the Lord. Why did Jesus go by Samaria
[2:15:15] to the woman at the well? because she
[2:15:17] was in Satan's pawn shop and she was
[2:15:20] sold under sin and she had five husbands
[2:15:23] and the one she was living with was not
[2:15:25] even her husband and the and the rel she
[2:15:27] was a religious outcast and no one else
[2:15:30] wanted to be around her but here come
[2:15:32] the
[2:15:33] redeemer. Hallelujah. That light had
[2:15:36] been coming across rocks and become
[2:15:39] coming coming across this dirt. the
[2:15:41] Pharisees, the Sadducees, just a whole
[2:15:44] bunch of religious mess and they
[2:15:46] couldn't receive the light. But when
[2:15:48] Jesus, the revealed word, come across
[2:15:52] her path and discern her heart and told
[2:15:55] her that she was a real daughter of God,
[2:15:58] instantly she came to life.
[2:16:01] Why? Because she was redeemable.
[2:16:05] Hallelujah. And even though the devil
[2:16:08] put a generational curse on her life,
[2:16:11] yet God, our kinsman redeemer, broke
[2:16:14] that off of her
[2:16:16] life. I tell you friends, mas, daddies,
[2:16:20] you don't have to carry over
[2:16:21] generational curses on your
[2:16:24] children. I'm just going to stay on it
[2:16:26] just a little bit longer. Amen. You that
[2:16:29] thing that you're struggling with, let
[2:16:30] it die with you. Don't Don't you pet
[2:16:34] that thing. Don't pet spirits. Don't try
[2:16:36] to don't don't don't don't sign for
[2:16:38] anything and say, "Well, I've just got
[2:16:39] to put up with it." I say, "Let us die
[2:16:42] to it. Die to temper. Die to jealousy.
[2:16:45] Die to envy. Die to gossip. Die to
[2:16:48] Leona. Die to every spirit that's trying
[2:16:51] to keep you lukewarm and bound and
[2:16:54] trying to say you're not going to make
[2:16:55] the rapture. Die to that thing. You are
[2:16:57] a daughter of God. You are a son of God.
[2:17:00] You are redeemable. or you would never
[2:17:03] be under the presence of God saying, "Oh
[2:17:05] God, I've longed for you, my
[2:17:09] Messiah."
[2:17:11] Hallelujah. Amen. You see, we're not
[2:17:14] under a curse any longer. Amen. The
[2:17:16] prophet of God, I'm just skipping way
[2:17:19] ahead. Amen. Look what Look what Paul
[2:17:22] said. By one
[2:17:24] offering, he hath perfected forever them
[2:17:30] that are sanctified.
[2:17:32] Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness
[2:17:36] to us. That's what the Holy Ghost is. It
[2:17:39] is bearing witness that you are already
[2:17:44] perfect. Oh, praise the name of the
[2:17:47] Lord. If you're under law, you're under
[2:17:49] a curse. If you're trying to just
[2:17:52] perform religious re uh uh Christianity
[2:17:56] by just works, it's dead works and
[2:17:59] you're under the curse. But Jesus came
[2:18:02] under the law and he not did not do away
[2:18:05] with the law. He magnified the law,
[2:18:08] fulfilled the law and he become a curse
[2:18:10] for you and I that he could declare you
[2:18:14] are perfect.
[2:18:16] He took your place that you can take his
[2:18:19] place. Oh, you understand your position
[2:18:22] in Christ Jesus. There is therefore now.
[2:18:25] Say now. Ain't that a beautiful word?
[2:18:28] Not future tense. Now we are the sons of
[2:18:31] God. There is no condemnation now to
[2:18:35] them who are positionally placed in
[2:18:38] Christ who is our
[2:18:40] life refreshing us, rejuvenating us,
[2:18:44] restoring us, making love to
[2:18:48] us. There's no condemnation because
[2:18:51] we're not under the law of sin and death
[2:18:52] any longer. The law of sin and death
[2:18:55] cannot influence this flesh to make us
[2:18:58] disbelieve the word.
[2:19:00] But we are already pregnantated with the
[2:19:03] Holy Ghost and we have already been
[2:19:06] quickened to
[2:19:07] life. I said it last night, I'll say it
[2:19:10] again. Our imagination says, "Oh, it
[2:19:13] gets all wild on us." Our reasoning
[2:19:16] tries to talk us out of the promises of
[2:19:20] God. What we
[2:19:22] see tries to make us disbelieve. Satan
[2:19:26] has a right to every one of our senses.
[2:19:30] You heard me
[2:19:32] right. Satan has a right to try to
[2:19:35] anoint every one of your senses. That's
[2:19:38] why when you see something contrary to
[2:19:40] the word, you don't believe it. When you
[2:19:44] hear something contrary to the word, you
[2:19:46] don't believe it. When reasoning comes
[2:19:49] and tries to talk you out of the word,
[2:19:51] you don't believe it. When your
[2:19:53] imagination goes wild and you start all
[2:19:56] kinds of things I we can go a long ways
[2:19:59] in imagination. Don't believe it if it's
[2:20:02] contrary to this word. The word is your
[2:20:05] absolute. It's your typost and it's the
[2:20:08] typost of the soul and the soul has
[2:20:12] broke through the veil.
[2:20:15] Now, I'm closing, but
[2:20:19] remember remember the prophet of God
[2:20:21] said the
[2:20:22] China, he says when when when the
[2:20:25] Chinese came over to the United States,
[2:20:28] it says they couldn't speak English, but
[2:20:29] they were very good
[2:20:31] laundrymen. And he said, so they had to
[2:20:34] come up with some way to to do laundry
[2:20:38] and and and write out a receipt. He
[2:20:41] said, "So what they would do is they
[2:20:43] would take a piece of paper and then
[2:20:46] they would tear this piece of paper a
[2:20:49] certain
[2:20:51] way and then they would give you
[2:20:55] one." I'm going to give you a piece of
[2:20:57] paper, give you one, and then they would
[2:21:00] go and then they would do the work of
[2:21:02] the kinsmen. I mean, they would go over
[2:21:04] here and do the work of the laundrom.
[2:21:07] And they would scrub that laundry and
[2:21:09] make sure that it's white and clean and
[2:21:12] and then when the laundry was ready and
[2:21:15] it was ready to be
[2:21:17] claimed, you had to come back with that
[2:21:19] piece to dovetail together. And so when
[2:21:22] you come back to claim your laundry, it
[2:21:25] had to come back and it had to dovetail
[2:21:28] perfectly
[2:21:29] together. Oh, what was it? You see, on
[2:21:33] Calvary, Jesus, when he did the work of
[2:21:35] the kinsman redeemer, he was going to
[2:21:37] break the curse of sin off of our life.
[2:21:40] God tore him into at Calvary. And he
[2:21:44] took his body to be to to be at to sit
[2:21:47] at the right hand of the father to be
[2:21:49] our high priest, our intercessor. And
[2:21:52] there he is as our kinsman, redeemer,
[2:21:54] interceding on our behalf. But then he
[2:21:57] sent back his spirit to confirm the
[2:22:00] covenant to every heart of every
[2:22:03] believer, every gene seed of God that
[2:22:06] was in his thinking before the
[2:22:08] foundation of the world. So you receive
[2:22:11] the Holy Ghost and we've been waiting
[2:22:13] the son of God. Amen. He's been doing
[2:22:16] the work of the kinsman redeemer. Son of
[2:22:18] God seven church ages. But in the day
[2:22:21] when the son of man is to be revealed,
[2:22:23] when the lamb takes the book and opens
[2:22:25] the seals, he's going to do the work of
[2:22:28] claiming. What is he doing? He's coming
[2:22:31] to claim his church, the one that he's
[2:22:34] cleansed and redeemed and taken the spot
[2:22:37] of sin off of your life. No
[2:22:39] condemnation. You're already judged.
[2:22:42] You're clean. You're pure. You're holy.
[2:22:46] So when he, the mighty angel, which is
[2:22:50] the spirit of truth, comes down and he
[2:22:54] comes in the form of his word and he
[2:22:57] begins to claim you. And he says,
[2:22:59] "You're mine. I claim you. I bought you
[2:23:03] with a price. Those hands are my hands.
[2:23:06] That body is my body. Your soul is my
[2:23:09] soul." Amen. My soul. And every one of
[2:23:11] you begins to claim you and says, "You
[2:23:13] don't belong to the devil. You don't
[2:23:15] belong to Leosa. There's an open door.
[2:23:19] There's a door of entrance into heavenly
[2:23:21] places.
[2:23:24] Break free of your imagination. Break
[2:23:27] free of your reasoning. Break free of
[2:23:30] these earthbound senses and break into
[2:23:33] that sixth
[2:23:34] sense. Let the Holy Ghost take you into
[2:23:38] your position.
[2:23:42] Hallelujah. where you see yourself in
[2:23:45] the vindicated message of the hour, the
[2:23:48] word that's been revealed for this day,
[2:23:51] and say, "That's who I am. That's my
[2:23:53] position. That's where I stand." And
[2:23:56] right there in your position, God
[2:23:59] promised to send open the windows of
[2:24:02] heaven and just keep pouring out
[2:24:05] blessings of
[2:24:06] refreshment. Blessings of
[2:24:10] refreshing. Oh, praise the name of the
[2:24:12] Lord. You see, the prophet of God, I'm
[2:24:15] closing. Oh, oh my goodness. The prophet
[2:24:20] of God says, you know what it does when
[2:24:22] this revelation breaks upon your soul
[2:24:24] and you see the word being fulfilled?
[2:24:26] What was promised? It brings
[2:24:28] stimulation, doesn't it? Stimulation of
[2:24:33] joy. When you see it, your soul, you see
[2:24:36] it this day. We've been waiting for this
[2:24:38] day for the seals to break over our
[2:24:41] life, to claim us. We can't be lost.
[2:24:43] There is absolutely no way that we can
[2:24:46] be
[2:24:47] lost. There is absolutely hear me. It's
[2:24:51] the words of a vindicated prophet. There
[2:24:53] is no way this bride can
[2:24:56] fail. You say, "What about Eve? What
[2:24:59] about the Pentecostal church?" God knew
[2:25:03] they would
[2:25:05] fall. God allowed them to fall.
[2:25:09] But in this age, he predestinated you
[2:25:12] not to fall. You are predestinated to
[2:25:16] this glorious stand. You are
[2:25:18] predestinated to the adoption of
[2:25:20] children to stand in your position with
[2:25:23] your shoulders back and get and say,
[2:25:25] "Satan, you have no power. You have no
[2:25:27] authority. You have no dominion in my
[2:25:30] life. I'm a son of God. Get your hands
[2:25:33] off of my family. Get your hands off of
[2:25:35] my mind. Get your hands off of my wife.
[2:25:37] Get your hands off of my children. Stand
[2:25:39] there as under that supreme authority of
[2:25:43] the vindicated word of God.
[2:25:48] That's what stimulates you. That's the
[2:25:50] joy of our
[2:25:52] salvation. That's the refreshing. That
[2:25:55] word just keeps refreshing. Refreshing.
[2:25:58] We just meditate upon the word, thinking
[2:26:00] on the word, thinking about the
[2:26:02] promises, and God just keeps refreshing
[2:26:04] us and keeps pouring out his spirit upon
[2:26:06] our
[2:26:07] life. Hallelujah. The prophet and the
[2:26:09] mighty God unveiled before us. And I'm
[2:26:11] closing with this. And so that is where
[2:26:13] the people tried to blindfold so many
[2:26:17] people by the traditions of the elders
[2:26:20] as it was then. And you fail to see why
[2:26:24] that the people are so elated and so
[2:26:27] enthused. And these conventions are such
[2:26:30] an oddball, such a strange thing to
[2:26:32] other people is because they see they
[2:26:35] broke through those barriers. They broke
[2:26:38] through those veils into the presence of
[2:26:40] God where they see the manifested
[2:26:43] promise of this hour made manifest
[2:26:45] before the people. They see what God
[2:26:49] promised.
[2:26:50] This word bride sees what God
[2:26:54] promised.
[2:26:56] Hallelujah. We broke through the veils.
[2:26:58] What is those veils? Those veils of
[2:27:01] tradition. Hearing those testimonies, it
[2:27:04] blessed my soul so much hearing those
[2:27:05] testimonies. How this church began and
[2:27:07] you broke through those veils. You come
[2:27:09] out of that Roman Catholic church and
[2:27:12] come to accept the message of the hour.
[2:27:14] You were breaking through the veil.
[2:27:17] Hallelujah. Amen. And each one of us as
[2:27:20] we come to our own revival, I had to
[2:27:22] break through
[2:27:23] veils. Things that were trying to
[2:27:26] interpret interpret the scripture a
[2:27:28] certain way, a certain a certain taint
[2:27:30] to it. Amen. I had to come through that
[2:27:33] veil and come under the headship of a
[2:27:35] vindicated word prophet for this day.
[2:27:38] Hallelujah. But when I broke through the
[2:27:41] veil, then it become a revival to my
[2:27:44] soul. It become a stimulation of joy. It
[2:27:48] become an outpouring of the Holy Ghost.
[2:27:50] You say, "You don't have bad days. Oh, I
[2:27:52] have plenty of them." You don't have
[2:27:54] pressure. I've got plenty of them. You
[2:27:56] don't have nervousness and and and and
[2:27:59] spirits try to give get a hold of you
[2:28:01] every day almost. But I know whom I have
[2:28:05] believed. I broke through the veil
[2:28:07] that's keeping me out of his presence.
[2:28:09] And now I'm in his presence with the
[2:28:12] veil closed behind me. And it's just me
[2:28:15] and God. As I said last night, Enoch was
[2:28:18] my type. I'm not a type of Enoch. And
[2:28:20] Enoch after 65 years old, he walked with
[2:28:25] God for 300 years. Justification,
[2:28:28] sanctification, the baptism of the Holy
[2:28:30] Ghost, and a Enoch was not for God took
[2:28:33] him.
[2:28:35] It's the catching away time of the
[2:28:37] bride.
[2:28:39] We've already went through
[2:28:41] justification, sanctification, the
[2:28:43] baptism of the Holy Ghost. The rapture
[2:28:45] is upon
[2:28:47] us. Let the musicians come. I got to
[2:28:51] stop. Oh, it's just flooding my soul.
[2:28:56] Hallelujah. Enoch had this testimony
[2:28:58] that he pleased God. And without faith,
[2:29:02] it is impossible to please God. And the
[2:29:05] seals were open to give us rapturing
[2:29:08] faith that we can please God. We can
[2:29:11] walk with God and say, "Yes, Lord,
[2:29:13] you're coming for me." A bride without
[2:29:15] spot, without wrinkle, not looking at
[2:29:18] yourself. Not looking at your humanity.
[2:29:20] Not falling under despair and
[2:29:23] condemnation. You're above it.
[2:29:26] You're above it.
[2:29:29] Reasoning can't get you down. You're
[2:29:31] above it.
[2:29:36] Oh, people get so scared when they see
[2:29:39] the signs of the time and an American
[2:29:42] pope now and so many things happening in
[2:29:44] politics and my goodness and people
[2:29:48] talking about the coming of the Lord and
[2:29:49] all of and oh, people get so
[2:29:53] weary,
[2:29:54] scared and then they start going back
[2:29:57] under the
[2:29:59] curse. the
[2:30:01] curse their
[2:30:03] flesh and they start saying, "Oh, oh no,
[2:30:07] I don't know if I'll make it.
[2:30:11] I as long as you're look to your
[2:30:15] humanity, there's not one of us will
[2:30:17] ever make the rapture."
[2:30:22] But when you please God by faith, you
[2:30:25] are taking what God has given us through
[2:30:27] his word in this hour and you're
[2:30:30] standing on it. If I only knew my
[2:30:34] position, the message of the hour has
[2:30:35] revealed your

[2:36:09] Oh, I
[2:36:11] once was
[2:36:14] lost, but now
[2:36:20] Oh, I was blind.
[2:36:24] But now,
[2:36:28] oh, just keep playing that. Now, if
[2:36:31] there's anyone that needs
[2:36:33] prayer, I just want to open it up to
[2:36:35] you.
[2:36:37] If you feel like you need to come and
[2:36:40] we'll help you pray. Maybe sickness in
[2:36:43] your
[2:36:44] body. Maybe there's a situation in your
[2:36:46] life that just seems like you can't get
[2:36:48] over
[2:36:49] it. Maybe there's
[2:36:51] something just like a generational curse
[2:36:54] that just keeps holding you
[2:36:56] back. I want you to know, friends,
[2:36:59] again, by the blood of Jesus and by the
[2:37:01] power of the Holy Ghost, every
[2:37:04] generational curse is broke. You can be
[2:37:07] set free.
[2:37:09] You are free by the power of God.
[2:37:13] If you'd like to go ahead and just come
[2:37:15] and take a hold of your redemptive
[2:37:18] rights, you're welcome to.
[2:37:21] There's someone
[2:37:23] that someone that you've not received
[2:37:26] the Holy Ghost yet. I just want you to
[2:37:29] know it's for you.
[2:37:31] You don't have to leave this service
[2:37:33] without it because it's your promise.
[2:37:37] God promised that he would fill you. And
[2:37:40] you don't have to beg.
[2:37:43] All you have to do is just come boldly
[2:37:45] before his throne of grace and say,
[2:37:47] "Father, cover me with your
[2:37:50] blood. You promised to fill me with the
[2:37:53] Holy Ghost. It's your promise." Friends,
[2:37:56] it is that simple as just opening your
[2:37:59] heart and saying, "Lord, I receive your
[2:38:02] spirit. Feel me." You don't have to beg.
[2:38:06] You don't have to work anything up. You
[2:38:09] don't have to try to manufacture
[2:38:11] anything. Just open your heart and
[2:38:13] receive it and God will fill you. It's
[2:38:16] for you young people.
[2:38:18] I want I just want to
[2:38:20] say you young
[2:38:23] people, you're not the future
[2:38:25] generation. You are the
[2:38:27] generation. You're not the one that
[2:38:29] we're waiting on to come someday. God
[2:38:32] has raised you up for such a time as
[2:38:34] this.
[2:38:36] God has God has brought you here by his
[2:38:40] grace to listen to this
[2:38:43] message to fill you with his
[2:38:46] spirit that you that you can be a
[2:38:50] reflection of his
[2:38:52] light to your friends at
[2:38:55] school, to the friends that you play
[2:38:57] with, in your neighborhood where you
[2:39:01] work. God's God's brought you here in
[2:39:04] this season for such a time as
[2:39:07] this. And I tell you, you're a blessed
[2:39:11] generation. I say, God bless you, young
[2:39:13] people. I say, God bless you, elders,
[2:39:16] for standing for this message.
[2:39:19] Thank you for staying
[2:39:21] faithful, staying Thank you for creating
[2:39:25] an atmosphere that the Holy Ghost can
[2:39:27] have its way. That the message is not
[2:39:30] just a dead letter or just another
[2:39:32] denominational system, but this word is
[2:39:35] alive. I I want to salute you. I want to
[2:39:38] say thank you. Thank
[2:39:43] you because that there is a church that
[2:39:45] is standing for the word in this
[2:39:48] hour. God is alive and
[2:39:51] well. And whatever your heart's desire
[2:39:54] is, you can receive
[2:39:56] it. Maybe it's a nervous
[2:40:00] condition. How many times in the prayer
[2:40:02] lines, Brother Brandham would say, "Now
[2:40:05] what you've got, you've got a nervous
[2:40:06] condition and it seems like you can't
[2:40:08] get over it.
[2:40:10] and people are telling you you just need
[2:40:13] to get over it. He said, "But you
[2:40:15] can't." He said, "But you've been
[2:40:17] waiting for a place for solid ground
[2:40:20] just to put your
[2:40:22] feet and get a hold of yourself." He
[2:40:24] said, "That time is
[2:40:26] now." Maybe you're in a real nervous
[2:40:29] condition in life, but I just want to
[2:40:31] say that this can be your service. that
[2:40:35] from this point on you can get your feet
[2:40:37] under you, settle your nerves, and you
[2:40:40] can be
[2:40:41] free. The power of God is here to heal
[2:40:45] you. Do you believe that, saints? Do you
[2:40:48] believe that he's the same yesterday,
[2:40:50] today, and
[2:40:51] forever? I believe it with all of my
[2:40:54] heart. I I've been in meetings where
[2:40:58] seen mighty, mighty, mighty
[2:41:00] deliverances. I wasn't around when the
[2:41:02] prophet was here.
[2:41:04] But I'm around when Jesus Christ is
[2:41:06] still alive and he's still moving and
[2:41:09] he's still manifesting his word. If
[2:41:12] you'd like to just bow your
[2:41:15] hearts, maybe you want to just lift your
[2:41:18] hand and say, "Remember me, Brother
[2:41:20] Jonathan. I need
[2:41:22] prayer. God knows your heart. God knows
[2:41:25] every
[2:41:26] condition. Lord Jesus, your children's
[2:41:30] hands are up before
[2:41:32] you. Father, you've not given us the
[2:41:34] spirit of fear, but of love and power
[2:41:38] and sound
[2:41:39] mind. And Father, we're stepping before
[2:41:42] your throne of
[2:41:44] grace, Father, asking petition of
[2:41:48] thee, Father, that you would bring
[2:41:51] refreshing,
[2:41:53] renewing, restoration.
[2:41:57] Father, as we have
[2:41:59] preached on the spirit of revival and
[2:42:02] how that that we're living in an hour
[2:42:05] that we must we must keep the spirit of
[2:42:09] revival
[2:42:11] alive. We've got a purpose in our hearts
[2:42:13] to stay in the life all the
[2:42:16] time. Maybe there's someone grown a
[2:42:19] little bit
[2:42:20] cold. Why? It's not that they're
[2:42:23] sinning. It's not that they they even
[2:42:26] love the
[2:42:27] world, but maybe they just grown a
[2:42:31] little cold and maybe they need to trim
[2:42:33] their lamp a little bit. That I pray, oh
[2:42:37] God, that you would come in
[2:42:38] mercy and that you would go to that
[2:42:41] heart and that you would rekindle the
[2:42:44] flame. Cut away the worldliness, Lord.
[2:42:47] Cut away the
[2:42:50] coldness. And I pray, oh God, that you
[2:42:52] would
[2:42:54] just just trim trim back the wick, Lord,
[2:42:57] and let the fire burn burn brighter than
[2:43:00] ever
[2:43:01] before. When they come in contact with
[2:43:04] anyone, even just
[2:43:06] strangers, our strangers are able to see
[2:43:09] that they're the revival.
[2:43:12] It's not in the Baptist, Presbyterian,
[2:43:14] Pentecostal, some denomination, non-a
[2:43:17] non
[2:43:18] non-denominational, but it's a just a
[2:43:20] personal individual relationship with
[2:43:25] God. Lord Jesus, I pray that you would
[2:43:28] just bless every young person. Father,
[2:43:30] my heart, you just stirred my heart for
[2:43:32] these young people. And I know, Lord,
[2:43:35] that you love them. I know you wanted me
[2:43:38] to tell them that that you love them and
[2:43:41] that you care for them and that you know
[2:43:44] what they're facing and what they're
[2:43:46] going
[2:43:47] through. Lord Jesus, I pray that you
[2:43:50] would just wrap your loving arms around
[2:43:52] them. Let them feel your
[2:43:54] embrace. Let them recognize your
[2:43:57] presence. Stir their souls, Lord.
[2:44:00] Regardless of what they're going
[2:44:02] through, I know they're facing great
[2:44:05] obstacles, great pressures. All hell has
[2:44:08] been poured out in this age. But Lord
[2:44:11] Jesus, as all hell's been poured out,
[2:44:14] all heaven has been poured out as well.
[2:44:18] And we can honestly say that greater is
[2:44:21] he that is in us than he that is in this
[2:44:23] world.
[2:44:25] Lord Jesus, we don't have to knuck down
[2:44:28] for the devil.
[2:44:30] We don't have to sign up for what he's
[2:44:33] telling us that we
[2:44:35] have. We can we can come under the
[2:44:38] influence of the Holy Ghost right now.
[2:44:40] And I believe every generational curse
[2:44:43] is is falling off of our lives. We're
[2:44:45] free of it.
[2:44:47] Lord, if we could just get just get that
[2:44:50] Holy Ghost strength, Holy Ghost courage
[2:44:53] to to just put our shoulders back and
[2:44:56] say,
[2:44:58] "Satan, you've had
[2:45:00] enough. From this day on, I'm
[2:45:03] free. I declare freedom over the devil.
[2:45:06] I declare freedom over this generational
[2:45:09] curse. I'm not under the law of sin and
[2:45:13] death any longer. I'm under the law of
[2:45:15] the spirit of liberty.
[2:45:18] Lord
[2:45:19] Jesus, we just we just give invite and
[2:45:23] welcome you to move from this day forth.
[2:45:26] Just continue the work, continue to
[2:45:28] flow, continue to just refresh and
[2:45:32] restore the joy of our
[2:45:34] salvation. We ask it in the name of the
[2:45:37] Lord Jesus
[2:45:39] Christ. Amen. And
[2:45:42] amen. You know, could we sing this song?
[2:45:46] Greater is he that is in
[2:45:49] me. Greater is he that is in
[2:45:54] me. Greater is he that is in me than he
[2:45:59] that is in the world. Oh, greater is he
[2:46:05] that is in
[2:46:07] me. Greater is he that is in me.
[2:46:13] [Music]
[2:46:25] Oh, happy.
[2:46:28] [Music]
[2:46:35] [Applause]
[2:46:41] [Music]
[2:46:52] I've heard it
[2:46:54] [Music]

[2:47:09] you know. I know your name. I know who
[2:47:12] you are. I know what your need is. And
[2:47:16] I'm here to answer the need. Amen.
[2:47:21] He's Jehovah Gyra, the God that sees the
[2:47:24] need, Lord Jesus, and provides.
[2:47:28] It's not just letting you know he sees.
[2:47:31] He lets you know he sees. So, he lets
[2:47:33] you know he provides as well. Lord
[2:47:35] Jesus,
[2:47:37] it's an opportunity.
[2:47:40] And your part is to say, "I believe. I
[2:47:43] receive.
[2:47:46] I heard my name called
[2:47:48] and I'm coming to get my
[2:47:51] blessing." Remember what he said in the
[2:47:53] first service. He says, "Grace is the
[2:47:55] word of promise being preached to you,
[2:47:58] but you got to put your name behind it."
[2:48:01] Amen. Let's sing this. You are more than
[2:48:05] enough for me. Let your faith go to
[2:48:08] work. Don't look at circumstances. Don't
[2:48:11] look at history. Don't look at family.
[2:48:13] Amen. Look to the word and say, "Lord,
[2:48:15] I'm trusting you this morning, this
[2:48:16] evening." Amen. Let's sing it
[2:48:22] together.

[3:12:45] rest. And you dwell on what he has told
[3:12:48] you. Until he gives
[3:12:51] it. Thou keep him in perfect
