And I keep falling in love with him. Over and over and over [music] and over again. I keep falling in [music] love with him. Over and over and over and [music] over again.

My Lord and [singing and music] I I keep falling in love with him over and over and over [music] and over and I keep [music] falling in love with you over and over [music] and over again. I keep falling in love with him over [music] and over and over and over again. He [music] gets sweeter and [singing] sweeter as the days [music] go by. Oh, what a [singing] love between my Lord and I. I keep [music] falling in love with him over and over and over and over [music and singing] again. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're thankful we've got a love in our hearts that keeps growing. Lord, the scripture says at the end that the love of many will wax cold. Lord, it'll be indifferent to you, to your word, to your spirit, Lord. Lord, we're so glad we've got a call that brings us here, Lord. Not just to this building, but it brings us to your presence day by day, Lord. That calls us, Lord, to a place, Lord, where we're satisfied, where we're content, where we're safe, Lord. And so, we just want to thank you this morning for your goodness. We want to thank you for your grace, Lord. We want to thank you for keeping us safe another week, Lord. We want to thank you for bringing us back here, Lord, to hear your word one more time, heavenly father. Lord, we're here to be changed. Lord, we're here to be drawn closer to you, Lord. And we want to walk out those doors this morning, Lord, closer to you and more like Christ than we've ever been in our life before, heavenly father. So, I pray you grant it this morning, Lord. I pray you give us victory this morning, Lord, in the hearing and receiving of your word. We pray over asking you all these things in Jesus Christ's name. We give this service now to you. In his name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn if you would to Genesis chapter 1 this morning. Good to see each one that was willing and able to make it out. Amen. I wanted to thank everyone for the specials and the help and the support for the special meetings this last week. Certainly enjoyed having brother Puy here and and on the way to the airport he said, you know, it's been such a blessing for him. He said, "You guys have been a blessing for me." Uh and so I'm just thankful for that. You want a a minister to come and and and not just give a blessing but receive a blessing. So he was very thankful for that. And then top of that now we announced we've got our next set of special meetings and those will be January 9th through 11th. So we got six short weeks, five weeks I guess from now and brother Aaron Oglesby will be coming up with his wife and uh and he'll be ministering for us. This is kind of a a rebooking of a rebooking from when he first booked to come to uh to preach for our camp this year that got cancelled. So we'll be remembering those as they come up as well. We'll have a fellowship with that of course as as usual. We've got the Christmas concert next Sunday and the fellowship afterwards. So, please remember that each family's been asked to to do something. It can be give a testimony. It can be read a scripture. It can be uh say a poem. You can sing, you can play, you can do whatever you want, but just something that would edify the local body. And we've certainly got many prayer needs this week. We've got Sister Nadine, and she's doing better by God's grace. The doctor's prognosis is she should recover without issue, but she's still got a ways to go. So, we want to remember her, especially sister Cassie as well. She's got a lot going on. And then this on top of it, trying to help her mom and be there for her. It's a lot of stress for anyone to carry. So, we just ask the Lord to be with her. Brother Ron Snow as he's recovering. Sister Beverly as well. Amen. That God would just touch them. Each one had a wonderful time this week and a rough week in some ways and a wonderful time in others. On Monday, I had a young man come to my door that was selling something and and I already had what he was he was selling, but we just talked for a little bit and he was trying to sell me internet and uh and uh I he said I said, "No, you can't. I don't want TV. I just internet. If you quote me internet, I I'll listen." He says, "Well, why don't you want TV?" I said, "Because I don't have a TV." I said, "Well, we have a TV, but it my boys play Minecraft on it." I said, "We don't we're not attached to anything. We don't watch things like that on it and whatnot." He said, "Well, what do you do with your time?" time. I said, "Well, jobs. I'm an engineer by day and I'm a pastor nights and weekends." And and he told me, he said, "Well, I I've decided I've gonna, you know, I think I would like to become a Christian. I've been going back to church." He told me where he was going and these things. And so, he started asking me questions, you know, and he said, "You know, do you do you think I'm a Christian?" I said, "Well, what's a Christian? What does it mean?" And we went through this. Anyways, we were talking for about 15 20 minutes. And then I said, "Listen, do you just want to come in and sit down?" So, we sat him down. We fed him some of Elsa's cinnamon buns that she'd made and we gave him a glass of milk and we sat and we talked for two hours about the Lord. So, that was a wonderful thing. Amen. That was a wonderful opportunity. And then he texted me the next day with some follow-up questions. And then Wednesday night, I was laying in bed and he was texting me again about the scriptures he was reading and wanted some clarity on it. So, we thank the Lord for that. You know, brother Mark was sharing with me, you know, some things and you know, how the Lord calls people severally. It's one here, it's one there, and we don't know. All we're here to do is to be a witness. Amen. Of the things he can do. Selena got an opportunity to witness this week as well. I've got some things that I want to talk about that in even in my notes this morning. But we thank the Lord for the opportunity to share Christ. Amen. That there are hungry hearts out there. There are seeking hearts. And if they can just come to a place where the open word is that maybe God can do something with their life. Amen. Brother Matt, do you want me to just switch to this mic or All right, let's do that. I'll just turn this off if that's okay and I'll be the pulpit. That's not usually a problem for me. Amen. Can I just take it off completely, brother Matt? Would that be okay? All right, let's turn to Genesis chapter 1. You're already there, I'm sure. Genesis chapter 1. Amen. And we'll read here. It says, "In the beginning, in the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. And God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. And God saw the light that it was good. And God divided the light from the darkness. And God called the light day. And the darkness he called night. And the evening and the morning were the first day. Amen. God bless you. You can have your seats this morning. I want to continue our series on a position of dominion on overcoming. And we we've taken the first of a number of things. And today I want to take the first part of the first victory. Amen. And uh we're going to start this today. There's too much to handle in a service. I didn't want to overload everybody but the la the first service on the series remember we spoke about the first battle and that was when Satan tried to get humanity tried to get Eve to walk away from the word of God and he succeeded. Now, that was speaking of the first human battle, but today I want to step back even beyond that because there's a battle that happened before that here on earth. And it sets the pattern for all other battles. And we've kind of just read about it here this morning. And now last service we spoke on the first enemy. And we saw that our victory and our overcoming have to be as Christ overcame himself. That's what it says in Revelation 3. As I overcame, so you also must overcome to sit with me on our on my throne. And so we saw that Christ had to overcome himself. Satan was not who he had to overcome. Satan's already been defeated, church. It's Jesus that had to defeat himself. He had to defeat the man. He had to defeat the human flesh. And it's the same thing we're facing today. Amen. We have to overcome our personal temptations, our personal trials to overcome. And when we overcome ourselves by the power of the Holy Ghost inside of us, that's when we can have the victory. And what is the victory? To produce the word that's written about you. Get yourself out of the way so that the word can come forth. And I've said this before and I keep saying it because I think it's relevant and we need it. We blame Satan for a lot of things that we do to ourselves. We blame Satan for a lot of things that we decide on our own. And and many people today we're looking around and we're blaming everyone and everything else for what's happening in our life. And I was providing some counsel this week and somebody had asked somebody, you know, uh why did God allow a bad thing to happen to me? And my response was that's not the question you need to ask. The question is, why would God be interested in your life when you're not interested in him? Why would God be interested in you when you want him only to keep you from the bad things, but you don't want the good things that he has? You don't want anything God has for you except what you want from him. That that that's a gold digger. That's what that is. That that's somebody that's taking advantage of someone. You don't want God. You just want the blessings of God without God himself. You want God without the relationship that comes with them. And people want to blame God for bad things, but they never give him credit for the good things. Why did God allow a bad thing, but why? They don't say, "Well, God allowed a good thing to me either." People want to blame everybody but themselves. Amen. And people don't even realize what good is anymore. They think what they want is good. But what God never said, "I won't let bad things happen to you." God said one thing. He says, "All things will work for good to them that are the called according to my purpose." So his promise is not that bad things won't happen. It's that whenever things happen, it's because he's allowed them and he'll use them for our good. Amen. Now, Satan is our adversary and he's a good adversary. He's our enemy. Don't ever forget it. But he cannot touch us unless God allows it. He cannot do a thing in our life unless he unless God allows it. But the thing is, so many times, and this is good, this is odd to preach to believers, but it's the truth. And we'll get into this not so much today, but in the future parts of this service or or this series, is that too many times we're allowing Satan in. We're opening up the door. We're inviting the conversation. We're opening up the window. We're the ones giving him access. He has no access to us unless God allows it or unless we give it to him. Amen. We're a free moral agent and those sorts of things. And so we look at how we make our money, how we spend our money, how we spend our time, the people we are around, the things that we watch, the things that we read, the music we listen to. All these things are access points. And if we look at those things, if we dwell on those things, if we focus on those things, we're opening the door for Satan. But if we've got the word guarding our life, then that's what keeps him out. Amen. By the power of the Holy Ghost. But Satan is always looking for an access point. He's always waiting. He's always looking. and he's very patient and he's trying to get something. He's throwing things at us, trying to get it to stick to our lives by way of our own decision. He throws it, but it won't stick if we don't take it. We talk about that box of rattlesnakes, that sickness, that hardship, whatever it might be. Satan comes and he offers you something and what do you do? You give it back. You say, "I don't want that box of rattlesnakes." If he can get you to hold on to it, everything that happens after that is your fault, not his. Because you accepted the box of rattlesnake. But I don't want to focus on that this morning. That's your pastoral uh uh reminder this morning. It's it's a little uh exhortation this morning. But today, I want to focus on victory. Amen. I want to focus on the first victory. And I want you to be encouraged this morning because I want to overcome. I want you to overcome. Amen. And I want to overcome the way that Christ did. Amen. Because there's a prize that comes with it. And that's to rule and reign with him eternally. So I want to be one of those overcomers. But that means there's a battle to fight. There's a battle to win. And it starts here. And it starts now. And I want to take us all the way back to the beginning of time in our opening scripture because we're going to get into this thought of how that we overcome. And if we see how God overcame, how God got the victory, then we'll see how we do it. And I'm going to be preaching something maybe not so much this service, but the the next couple it'll seem very familiar. But I find the problem with familiarity is that too many people don't really know what it means. We've heard the phrases. We've heard the quotes. We've heard the scriptures. We've heard it said so many times. I'll just say what it is. We overcome by the word. We say that, but what does that really mean? What does that look like? And I want to show what that means this morning. What's really going on so that we can see how God works and how God works so that we can see how God works inside of our life. Now, we go back to our opening scripture says, "In the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth." And brother Brand would say, "Period." We don't know how long it was until verse verse number three. Okay? God created the heaven and the earth. Period. It could have been billions of years that it sat in the form that was in. It says, "And the earth was without form. It was in confusion. It was chaotic. It was meaningless. It had no evident purpose. It was desolate." It says, "And it was void. It was empty and ruins." Now, catch this. It says, "And darkness." Darkness there means misery, destruction, death, ignorance, sorrow. In other words, there is no life there. There is no good. There's no benefit there. The whole thing is in darkness was upon the face of the deep. So you notice here the whole earth is covered in water. There's no way for life to even come forth out of this. There was no land sticking out of this. Okay. Now, now I want you to consider the original uh uh status, the original uh way that the earth was. Amen. The condition of the earth then in no way reflected what God intended it to be. Okay, put your spiritual thinking caps on. If we were to look at the earth visually, there's no light, so we can't even see what's there. But if we were to look at it and describe the earth, would we say this was going to be a land of of life and beauty and growth and peace and calm? No. There is nothing about the earth here that reflects the intentions of God when you look at it. It was dead. It was dark. was devoid of any hope. But listen to this. Amen. We're preaching on the first victory this morning. And here it comes. It says, "And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters." Amen. This is where the first victory starts to happen. I want you to see something here. The spirit of God moved. It did not form a massive hurricane or a tornado the size of Newfoundland and come down and just start churning up the waters and moving the land around and separating the clouds out and redistributing the earth so that it came into shape. It didn't do that. The scripture says that the spirit of God moved upon the face of the earth. Church, all God has to do is move. It doesn't have to be big. It doesn't have to be apparent. All he has to do is move and things start to happen. Okay? We look at the whole earth and we say out of that is going to come life and greenery and animals and a and just a a beautiful garden that reflects the very nature of God. And what's going to start it? A move of God. The spirit of God moving. Church, that's all it takes in our relationships with wi with with the people that we're dealing with, with the situations that we're dealing with. We look around this morning. We've got things that have looked dark for a long time. We've got relationships that haven't been repaired. We've got children that haven't been saved. We've got sicknesses that haven't been healed. We've got things that have been bugging us for years. We've got deliverance that hasn't happened. And we look at it and visually it seems like nothing's going on. But what matters is, is the spirit of God moving or not? Because if it's moving, something's got to change. something's going to change. The question is, will we hold on until then? That's what he's asking us to do. It says here that the the spirit of God moved and that word there is hovered. And and it goes back to the idea of a mother bird that's brooding over her eggs. And what she's doing is she's setting the right atmosphere by her presence to keep them warm so that the warmth will bring life to those eggs and it'll produce ones just like the mother. In other words, church, the spirit of God moving sets the atmosphere for life. It sets the atmosphere for something to come forth. But watch how it moves now. Watch how it works. This is critical. I'm setting up your foundation for the understanding of how God brings victory into our lives. Amen. We hear so much. Get the Holy Spirit. That's the most critical thing, church. Get the Holy Spirit. That's the new birth. But what happens when you get the Holy Ghost? It starts to move. And watch how it moves. Watch how it operates. The Holy Ghost starts moving over the darkness and the lifelessness and the hopelessness. And in that moment, nothing changes. Nothing changes. It looks exactly the way it did before it moved. Are you hearing me this morning? Is God moving? Yes. Can you see something? No. Can you see the results yet? No. But watch what follows. The moving of the spirit. Because remember, when God moves, he moves with purpose. I loved how brother Billy read those quotes about Wormwood and Gabriel coming to to God, standing on the banisters of heaven, watching those three Hebrew children, and he's saying, "Lord, are you seeing what's going on? I can go down and I can move the water and I can move the winds and I can do this and that." And God said, "No, I'm going to go down myself." It looked like God was not moving, but when he moved, things started to happen. whether they realized it or not. And the moment they stepped into that fire, it had no effect on them. Why? Because he was there just in time. Okay? He's moving with purpose. God's here to make a lasting change. That's what God wants. God's here for the eternal, not for the temporal. So when he moves, things change for good. And watch it says this. And God said, "Let there be light." So when the spirit of God moves, what does he do? He brings the word. He brings the word. Okay, that's the evidence of the spirit of God moving is it brings the word. That's how you know it's the Holy Spirit is the word comes with it. It's not just emotions. It's not just feelings. It's not just shouting and hollering and dancing and clapping and all these things, but it brings the word with it. That's why you see denominations fail is the spirit comes, they say, and no word comes with it. You just get a good time. And it is a good time, but that's all that comes with it. And that's why there's no change. The word comes with the spirit. Okay, watch what he h what happens. He says, "Let there be light." Colon. Now remember church, scripture is written exactly the way it is with purpose. God said, "Let there be light." And then there's a pause. There's a period of time. Amen. In other words, there was a gap between the spoken word and the manifested word, between what God saying it and it being produced. There's a gap and then and there was light. The spirit of God moves. Spirit of God speaks the word space of time and then the word of God comes into reality. And that's the way that God works. Amen. The spirit of God moves. The word is spoken. There is a pause where we may not see anything, but it doesn't mean the spirit's not moving. And that's the trial of our faith. As I've said many times, is the gap between the speaking and the occurring. That's the trial of our faith. That's what holds us there. Amen. It's move, speak, let it work, believe it whether you can see it or not, and then the reality comes in. That's the way that God brings victory. Amen. That pause can be a split second or it can be 25 years. Abraham and Sarah 25 years between the spoken word and the manifested word. Was God working any less in Abraham and Sarah's life? No. Preserving them, keeping them, protecting them, leading them, guiding them, taking them exactly to the place where they would know it was God and God alone that did it. And through it all, the scripture says that Abraham ignored everything else, called the things that were as though they were not, the things that were not as though they were, and was strong giving fa in faith. That's the way he walked. Amen. What's the first thing that God created? We preached on this before, so I won't go into the depths of it here, but the first thing that God created was light. And that was not the sun, the moon, and the stars, remember? Because those were created on the fourth day. But here he's creating the attribute of light, the nature of light itself. And that nature and that attribute was a reflection of himself. As we preached before, this was God creating a pillar of fire for himself to dwell in. And every bit of light after that was just a physical manifestation of the supernatural element of God, of the very attribute and nature of God. Amen. That's what he was he was doing when he produced the sun, moon and stars was just something that reflected his own nature. God was creating his own dwelling place. We sing that song how great is our God and it says he wrapped himself in light. That's exactly what he did here. Brother would say this. He says so first he first was God Jehovah and out of him he says now let's just picture now as a little drama so you can get it. Let's see coming out of space where there's nothing. Let's make it a little white light, just a mystic light like a halo. And that was the logos that went out of God in the beginning. That was the son of God that came out of the bosom of the father. That was what was in the beginning was the word. The word was with God and the word was God. He says, "And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us." In the beginning was God and then out of God came the logos, a part of God that went out of God. So that light was the logos of God, the expression of God, the physical manifestation of God made visible to us. And everything comes out of that supernatural light. We'll get into it as we read the scriptures. Everything comes out of that light. Brother Brand would say we come from it and we go back to it. It all comes from that supernatural light. Amen. Because that's the word expressed and everything that we are, everything that we have comes from the expression of the word. It's the starting point of everything. Brother Ram says it this way. He says, "God said over this dark, gloomy, dismal, mossy world that stood here without light, he said, let there be light." And it wasn't light until that word was manifested. Then it was light. In other words, saying the words, "Let there be light," doesn't mean we have light. Can you put yourself there this morning? Saying we have it, doesn't mean it's there, but it means it's going to be there. It may not be there already, but it's going to be there. Amen. We have the word, but we didn't have the product of the word all the time. Amen. The word itself was not light when it was spoken, but it was power to produce the light. That's exactly what it is. Amen. It took the word being manifested for light to actually exist. Until it happened, we didn't know what light was. It had no definition. Amen. But when the word of God was spoken, it meant that light was coming whether we liked it or not, whether we wanted it or not. Whether we believed or not, it didn't matter. The word went out and it said, "Let there be light." And so light had to come forth. Amen. But until it came forth. It was just a promise. It was just a potential. But because it's the word of God, not the word of man, it was a certainty. And so whether it took a billion years or whether it took a second, it doesn't matter. It was going to happen. Amen. Light was a certainty because God said it. So what we need today is what? Not just the spoken word, not just the written word, but we need the reality of the word because that's where the overcoming is. We've got to take it in our hearts by faith, but it's got to come out and produce itself for us to actually have what we're talking about. We believe by his stripes we are healed. But we need it, don't we, Sister Brenda? We got to have it in our in our in our ears and in our jaws. That's what the reality of it is. That's the victory. the the the when it's spoken, it's the potential, but it's the reality that's the victory. That's what we're looking for in our lives. Amen. We look at this, the spoken word, what does it do? The written word, it gives us faith. Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word. That's what Paul said. So, hearing the word gives us faith to walk and trust God even when we don't see anything changing. But when is victory? Victory is when our faith has been made sight and we have what we believe. We've had what we've talked about. We've had what we've held on to. And it finally comes out. When it becomes the word manifested, that's when our victory comes. Okay? We need light to live and have a full life. That's why Newfoundlanders are some of the hardiest people in the world because we get so little light yet we live so sun so little sunlight. It's getting better and better every year. I hate to say bring on climate change, but it seems to be doing wonders for sunshine. But the we need light to live and have a full life. You can live without light, but it's a miserable existence. You know, they've got these fish down. If you go real low into the ocean, then they've got animals there that have no eyes. They've got them in caves where they don't have them either. They are completely blind because they don't need it because there's no light. Now, those fish, they live a life, but they're missing so much because they can't see. They don't know what they're missing because that's all they've known. It's our natural condition. We don't know what we're missing because we're blind to the light. Amen. They exist, but they're not really living life. Amen. Now, watch this. We're speaking of the first victory. And I want to catch the foundation of why God brought light first. Brother says, "Well, there was a time when the world was laying in utter darkness. It was without form and was void. And it was all covered with water and was laying there in the dark, dismal, gloomy atmosphere." Anybody ever have a dark, dismal, gloomy atmosphere from time to time? [laughter] That's the human condition. Guess what? God's here to take us out of the human condition. Praise the Lord. But sometimes we have days where it just seems like the cloud follows us everywhere we go. It says, "And the spirit of God moved upon that water and said, "Let there be light." He said God had a reason to do that. For down beneath that water, there were seeds that he had planted and it had to have that sunlight to make it live. The purpose of God's creation was to bring life. To bring life that already had potential by seed form, but it needed to have reality. How? By the light. By the life of God. God didn't create light and step into it just to have it. He did it because that's the overcoming power. That's what brings life out of death. That's what brings life out of darkness. God pre God created light to produce the rest of his purpose and plan and bring it into reality. That's the reason that he did it. Okay? It started with light. When light came, victory was imminent. That's the beauty of it. When light came, it meant that everything else was going to follow that life needed. Now, watch this victory. Here's the first victory. We have to catch this this morning. It says God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness. God called the light day, the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day. Says God divided the light from the darkness. It means he made a difference between them. He separated them. He distinguished one from the other. He severed them from each other. The first victory that ever happens in scripture that is when God moved, he spoke and then what he spoke became reality and that reality had a lasting eternal effect. Okay, that's the first victory. The reality of what God said came forth and it defined something here. And we see that he gave light the attribute that where it was darkness could not coexist. That may not seem like much to us today because we say duh. Everybody knows that if you have light, darkness can't be there. Why? Because God divided them. God said light and darkness can be not cannot be in the same place at the same time. And that is his attribute. It's his design. That's the way that he made it. Amen. We take it for granted that light defeats darkness. But that's the very attribute and nature that God gave light. Let me say it this way. If darkness was a person, if darkness was was a disease, if darkness was a a power with consciousness, darkness wasn't worried when God said, "Let there be light." Church, Satan isn't worried when you speak it. You catch what I'm saying this morning? You know, it brought to mind in that I think it was the first or the second uh in the in the chosen series where Nicodemus comes to Mary Magdalene. And you know what he tries to do? He tries to cast out those demons by theology. And you know what happened? He left. The demons didn't do anything because there was no reality in Nicodemus's life. We can say the words all day long. Satan doesn't care. But let me say this. Hallelujah. What made darkness start to tremble? What made darkness start to cry out? What made darkness start to run? church. It was when that smallest of lights started to flicker. And they said, "We can't be here. We've got to go. We can't be in the same place." And they went running at the smallest of lights. And it grew and it grew into this massive pillar of fire where God would dwelt. Church, darkness didn't lose its power. It lost its right to exist. Hallelujah. Put it on. Put your spiritual thinking caps on. When light comes, darkness doesn't lose its power. It loses its right to exist. It cannot stay where light is. This is the victory. In other words, it wasn't the spoken word that got the victory. It was the manifested word that was the victory. Amen. That's what happened here. It was the reality of the word that overcame darkness. The spoken word was the certainty, but the reality was the victory of it. It was the product of the word that moved darkness out of the way. This is what it says in the book of John. It says, "In the beginning was the word. The word was with God and the word was God. We just saw this. God spoke the word. The word became reality. God stepped into his own creation to express himself fully. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him. That's why I said all things come from light. All things go back to light. And with him was not anything made that was made. In him was life. And the life was what? The light of men. Now notice that life is by light. It's eternal light. It's eternal life. God's life. God's attributes being expressed. It says in verse five, "And the light shineth, present tense, it's still shining." The light is still shining in darkness. And it says, "And the darkness comprehended it not." So when light started shining at the beginning, it never stopped shining. And since then, darkness, it says, comprehended it not. The literal translation there is, and darkness did not overcome it. Why? Because God divided the two. They could not exist simultaneously. So I would say it this way. It's not that light darkness did not overcome it. It's that light overcame darkness. That's what we're saying this morning. Light overcame darkness. Light always beats darkness. Darkness is a defeated enemy. If you're in the dark, you can defeat him today with light. It doesn't change. Doesn't matter where you go. Doesn't matter how thick, how heavy that darkness is. If you've got light, you've defeated darkness every single time. What couldn't darkness overcome? The manifestation, the reality of the word. Amen. When the word became reality, darkness couldn't win. That smallest little flicker. Amen. Are you hearing me this morning? You say, "I'm just a little Christian." Brother John. It doesn't matter. The littlest light defeats darkness. Do you ever go into uh you know sometimes the kids will get these um these uh little stickers and they have you know they're they're luminescent and that hey dad come here I want you to show my sticker and that you know they put it on their paper and then they say let's go into the closet. Well church that little sticker with its luminance as little as it is you go into a completely dark closet and you turn that on. Guess what? You can see things in the closet by the little light of that luminescent sticker. You know you have a smartwatch. There's not much light on this, but you go into a closet and you just flip that watch and guess what? You can see everything. We've got a a fire a smoke alarm in our bedroom and in the middle of the night when everything's dark, that tiny little green annoying light, you can see everything in your room that you need to see. Why? Light defeats darkness. You don't have to be big. You just have to be light. And then darkness can't stay there. Amen. The first victory was when God expressed himself by the spoken word and it became reality. And the victory he got then is the victory he has now. Light always beats darkness. This is a very simple concept this morning. And I don't have a long service for you this morning either. Been fighting the flu and I just had to keep it short to make sure that my voice would survive. But I want you to catch this foundation. Light defeats darkness. manifested word destroys Satan. We could put it another way. He says, "Now remember, light comes by the spoken word of God." God said, "Let there be light. There was no light." And he said, "Let there be light and there was light." He says, "That's a proof." What's he doing, church? He's saying if he spoke his word and it happened, then there's your proof. Believe him for the same thing today. He says, "Now what if he just said it and no light came?" Well, then we don't know whether it's true or not. We don't know whether he's all right. We don't know whether he's God or not because he just said let there be and there wasn't. See, so then when God speaks and we see it is, then that's the light that shines forth the truth of the word. See, there is light and life. Now I want to ask you something. When that light came forth on the first day, did the earth have victory? Did did plants just spring forth? Did animal life come forth? Did land come forth? Did everything just happen as soon as the light hit? Did everything did the earth just just come into full bloom and and to its full potential? No. All that happened was light. That's it. But light brought imminent victory. When the light hits, things start to change. When God expresses himself, that's when things start to change. Amen. So the the the the process have been started. I don't know if you've ever done this. I've done it on cliffs before where you take a rock as big as you can handle because you want the boom to be big and you take it to the edge of a hill or a cliff and then you just push it over. Once it's gone, church, is there any stopping that rock? Remember Daniel saw a rock that had been hewed out without hands. And when it started rolling, it destroyed everything in its path. There's no stopping a rock once it starts to roll down a hill. When the light comes, it's like that rock that rolls over the hill. Victory is imminent. It's going to do what it's supposed to do. You catching what I'm saying? Light and darkness cannot coexist. And so the victory we're looking for today is to take that absolute attribute. What? That the spoken word produces the manifested word. And that's what takes us to victory. If God said it, God will do it. If God said we're going to be there, we're going to be there. If God said I'm healed, then I'm going to be healed. If God said I'm going to be delivered, I'm going to be delivered. If God said I'm going to be saved, I'm going to be saved. If God said I'm going to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost, I'm going to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost. If God said I'm going to be spotless and without wrinkle, I'm going to be without I'm going to be spotless and without wrinkle. That's the absolute of the word of God. That's the absolute of the light. Amen. Brother Bram says this. God said, "Let there be light." And that was the word. He says, "But now there is light. It isn't the word. It's the light." You see, God's not up there. God God didn't give us this word so we could just read it. God gave us this word so we could be it. The purpose of the spoken word is that it would be manifested. That it would become a reality. Amen. He says now there's he says now there's light. It isn't the word. It's the light. See what I mean? Now it isn't just a written word to us. It's a reality. He says we are in him. Now we're enjoying. Now we behold him. Now we see him. The word manifesting himself. He says it's hid out there because why? It's veiled in human flesh. What's God trying to do? Get the word to express itself in flesh. Again, that's what he's trying to do. That's what shakes the devil. What shakes the devil is not the spoken word. What shakes the devil is the manifested word. It's sons and daughters of God that are the word, not just talking about the word. That's what God's looking for in our lives today. That's what destroys kingdoms. That's what puts away darkness. That's what gives lasting victory is when the word becomes a reality, not just the theology. That's what God's trying to do. Amen. The word spoken in faith has power, but the victory comes when the word is made manifest. That's what takes away the darkness. That's what wins the battle in the end. Now, watch how you watch how this progresses. We have light in the beginning, and it separates light from darkness. It overcomes darkness. It defeats darkness. However way you want to say it, light beats darkness. It's like rock, paper, scissors. Some things are absolute. Light beats darkness every single time. And yet the world fell into a fallen condition after this. Why? Because they got away from the light. They got away from the absolute of the word of God. They spiraled into a life of separation from God into disobedience, self-reliance, self-righteousness. And they were further away from God than ever. By the time that Jesus came, they were more religious than ever, but they were outside of God's will and way. They were living in total darkness. Blind leading the blind. And that's what Jesus called them. And you know what? We've got the exact same thing today. Revelation 3 for the Leodysian church age says they're miserable, wretched, poor, blind, and naked. And they don't know it. So we're dealing today with a people with a world that's in the exact same self-righteous condition of blindness, of darkness. So what's the solution? Bring the light. That's the only thing we can do. That's the only thing God can do. God's answer to darkness is send the light. That's the Macedonian call. Send the light. We're in darkness. We need a man that can turn on the lights. I've been listening. I listened to that message, finished it this week. There's a man that can turn on the lights. And that's where we get much of the inspiration for this. There's a man that can turn on the lights. Amen. Not just the word light, but the reality of the word. That's what Christ was. He wasn't the written word. He was the manifested word. Brother says this. He says, "So the word of God began to separate the light from the darkness from the beginning, and so does it remain until this day." God doesn't change his pattern. If God got a victory one way, he'll keep getting the victory that way. He sets the same pattern. And how does he do it? He separates the light from the darkness by the reality of his word. Church, that's why I believe what we have today is right? Because it works. It doesn't just sound like it works. It works. I'm different today than I was last year, than I was 10 years ago, than I was was when I was a young teenager. Why? Because the word works. It brings a reality with itself. Amen. And it's what? The manifestation of the word, not just the speaking of the word. I can say all day long, I'm a flashlight, but until I become a flashlight, darkness doesn't have to worry about me. I can say all day long, I'm a Christian, but until Christ comes in and produces Christ, then Satan doesn't have to worry. But as soon as Christ comes in, light and darkness can't coexist. And so Satan has to go. Amen. That's when he starts to worry. Listen to Jesus own words. Now he says, "I am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness." Abide in darkness. So they don't have to remain. They don't have to dwell. They don't have to continue or endure in darkness. In other words, Jesus came to take us into light. Take us into life. We would say it that way. So what does Jesus do? Jesus starts to do the same thing that the spirit of God did in the first place. Set an atmosphere. He starts to go around and he starts to set an atmosphere. He did exactly what the light did in the beginning. He started moving waters. He started changing situations. He started shaping land. He started bringing seeds to life. That's what the light does. He started changing the status quo. Church, when you meet him, you'll never be the same. Whether you go to the right hand or to the left, whether you go with him or you walk away from him, you'll never be the same again. That's what he came to do. He started breaking down traditions. Jesus started digging in the muck. Hallelujah. He started digging in the muck. What? So that those seeds that have been buried for so long could feel the warmth of his light, of the presence of the manifested word, and so that they could come forth. And in seeing who he was, they could start to see who they were. and they could start to produce something they never even realized. Jesus did a lot of talking. But church, he walked the talk. Why? Because he was the manifested word. He was the He wasn't just there to talk about victory. He was the victory. He was the victory. Remember, he walked up to to to that that madman of Gera. And the demons know who he is. They know what's coming before he says anything. And they say, "Listen, just let us go peacefully. Don't cast us out. We'll go someplace else if you let us go where we want. Where do you want to go? Go in the pigs. He says, "All right, go into the pigs." And what they do? They went over the cliff and they died. They knew who he was. Jesus didn't have victory theology. He was victory walking in leather. That's what he was. He was the reality. He was the He was the manifest of victory. Amen. Like I said, do you see Nicodemus going in there and trying to cast out with his theology and there's nothing there because all he's got is ideas. And then Jesus comes and in a moment changes her life. Mary Magdalene became one of the greatest witnesses of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Amen. See the problem is we look so often at what Jesus did and we want to do what he did. But the thing is we've got to be what he is so we can do what he did. And that's the hard part. That's the hard part is we got to be who and what he is in order to do amen. We got to go from saying I am a flashlight to being a flashlight. We can't do the works of Christ until we're the same expression. We got the same source. We've got the same life, the same light inside of us. That's our victory right there. Brother Ram continues. He says, "So it is in every way, every age, the word made manifest, come to life. Is the light of that age there, the word made manifest. That's why when that young man comes to my door, I'm so eager to talk to him. Not because of what I don't have, but because of what I do have." When Peter and John came to the gate, beautiful such as I have give I thee. What am I there to give him? I'm not there to give him a church experience. I'm there to give him Christ. I'm there to give him light. I'm there to give him life. That's what we're looking for. He says there the word may manifest. They're the light of that age. You young sisters, when you walk around in your modest dress, you're a light. Brothers, when you hold yourself back from certain things, when you don't laugh at things, when you don't look at things, you don't engage in things, you're a light whether you realize it or not. And if people could only recognize that, they could come to Christ. But so often they don't. He says, just like it was in Genesis 1 when God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. When God said, "There will be a son and there was a son." He says, "When God said in Joel 2:28, it shall come to pass in the last days I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh. Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy upon my handmaids and maidservant while I pour out of my spirit. Your young men shall see visions. Your old men shall see dreams. He's saying what? It's going from spoken to reality, spoken to manifested, spoken to the real deal. He says, "And all these things that he promised when it the Holy Ghost fell was the light upon that word. When the word was made manifest, then it became light. See, we say and we believe and this is we'll be getting there in this series. We overcome by the word of God. That's how we overcome. That's how Jesus overcame. But we have to realize the overcoming is not in the speaking. The overcoming is in the reality. You got to have something. Brother Bman, I don't have the quote with me. We'll read it next service maybe. He says, "You can't come and bluff. You've got to have Christ inside. That's the light. That's the life. That's the overcoming that's inside of us. Amen. Amen. The word is our anchor. But there has to come a day where our faith becomes sight. Remember, the last victory is death. The last thing we conquer is death. But there's a whole bunch of more things have to happen before then. And it's by believing in the word, holding on to it by faith, and then we get the reality of it. That's really the victory. Faith holds us until the victory. Faith held Abraham until Isaac was born. Faith held Jesus on the cross laid down his life until the word could raise him up again. It's the reality that's the victory. But it's faith in the word that holds us there in the moment. Amen. The spoken word holds us until the manifested word gives us victory when it's it's expressed. See, the problem is so many times we refuse the spoken word. We refuse the written word. Now, I'm not speaking to us, you know, as a church or anything like, but but I'm speaking in general. People refuse the written word, the spoken word. And when they refuse that, they refuse victory because that's where it is. That's where the victory is, is through the word of God. Amen. You can't win if you don't accept the word. You can't win if you don't accept the word. The word gives us the prescription to overcome everything in this world, especially this guy. That's where our prescription is. It lies inside the word. And I think that's why most people won't accept it. They don't want to surrender. They don't want to change. They just want the blessing. But that's not the way it works. Something has to has to be defeated for something to have victory. And it starts internally. It doesn't start with somebody else. Says this, "For God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved." God values life. God wants to show mercy above all else. He that believeth on him is not condemned. But he that believeth not is condemned already because he had not believed in the name of the only begotten son of God. And this is the condemnation. He says this is what's going to condemn you in the end. That light has come into the world and men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil. He says, "For everyone that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved. But he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds might be made manifest that they are rotten and God. Remember what Jesus said. He said, "Be ye doers of the word and not hearers only." We come to church and we hear. It's when we go out the question is do we do? That's what God's looking for. That's the real problem. This is where true humility shows itself. Can we be corrected by the word of God to the point that it changes what we do? &gt;&gt; That's a hard thing to do sometimes, isn't it? You realize you've been doing something wrong. You realize you've missed the work. You missed the mark. And the word comes forth. And the question is, will pride rise up and say, "Well, it doesn't matter. It's just one time." Or will it say, "Be it unto me. I surrender." If we can't be corrected by the light of the word of God, no matter what we say or do, we're living an evil life. Come on, church. That's it. That's it. If we cannot do it, remember what Jesus said to the parable of the two to the two sons. The father said, "Go into my vineyard and work today." And one of them said, "Yes, father, I'll do it." The other one said, "No, I won't." And then he said, "The one that said he would didn't, and the one that said he wouldn't did." He said, "Which one loved him?" They said, "The one that did it." It's the doer. Remember what brother Billy said this last weekend? He said, "You are a composite of all the decisions you make." Doers of the word receive the reality of the word. Hearers only of the word turn into religious people only. That's where you end up. No victory, lots of knowledge. Maybe lots of outward commitment, but no victory because you got to be doers to get the manifestation. You've got to apply it. You got to let it come in. Jesus says here, "Men love darkness rather than light because what they were doing was evil. And when light comes, it'll reprove you if you're doing wrong. This is the house of correction. Remember, correction is not slapping you around and giving you a spank. It's telling you right from wrong. That's why this is the corre house of correction. It shows us the true path that God wants us to walk. Amen. And so what? If you don't want to walk that path, you don't want to be in life because it will tell you you're wrong. And now you got to make a choice. And you have to obviously and clearly decide which way you're going to go. Selena was witnessing to a lady this week at the stables and and it's the first question so many people ask about people that go to church. What does your church believe about alternate lifestyles? And Selena said, "Well, that's a that's it's not a it's a hard question because you want to know if we're for or against it." She said, "But what our answer is, come as you are and let God change you into what pleases him." She said, "It's no different. Homosexuality. You can be a liar, an adulterer, a murderer, a cheater, a liar, gossiper, come on. All sorts of things. We don't care how you come in. What matters is how you go out." Amen. And so she said, "We believe in the changing power, the transformative power of God in a person's life." That's what we believe in. We are not for or against those things. We are for the transformational power of Christ. Of course, we don't believe in those things, but we're not against the sinner. We're for the word of God. We're here to give life. We're here to give mercy. We're here to give grace. So the the very call of the bride even at the end of it all is come come see a man come meet a man come as you are drink of the waters of life freely that's our call that's our gospel it's not you have to be cleaned up you have to be a certain way to come no just come and let it do the work we'll turn you into a we'll turn you into a Christian rather than just a religious person but people don't want to change. People want affirmation. That's the age we're living in. Affirmation. And guess what? The gospel of this age is not self-affirming. What is it? Look at look at the deodosian rebuke. You say you're this, this, this, and this. He says, you say you're rich and increased with goods, have need of nothing. But yet I tell you, you're wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked, and don't know it. And then it gives them a remedy. People don't want the remedy. They just want the affirmation. What a horrible place to be in that you see light and you say I'd rather be in darkness. You know, I was thinking about this the other day when Jesus was talking to the rich young ruler. And remember he comes running, he says, "Master," he says, "All the right things." And he says, "What must I do to have eternal life?" And Jesus starts to quote, "Love, you know, love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind and love your neighbor as yourself and honor your mother and your father." And he says, "Hey, I've done all this since I was a youth." And then the scripture says something very interesting. It says, "And Jesus beholding him loved him." And what did love do? Love said, "You lack one thing. Sell all that you have, give it to the poor, take up your cross daily, and follow me, and you'll have riches in heaven." Love went straight to what he needed to change. Light came. light Shawn personally, specifically directly into that young man's life, that sincere young man, and it said, "You only need to change one thing, bud. Just one thing." I've said this before. I pray to God he could come and say, "You only need to change one thing, John. I would love that." But yet, this man went away sorrowful because he was very wealthy and he couldn't let it go. But love gave him light and he said, "I'd rather go back to knowing to hoping I've got eternal life rather than knowing it." What a horrible place to be. Church, we want to be affirmed if we're doing something right. Absolutely. Everybody loves a pat on the back, but we ought to also want to be corrected if we're not right. Because that's the desire of a child of God's heart. Amen. That's why we come to church. This is a house to wake us up. Get our eyes open. Take away those blind spots. My wife and I, we talk so much about blind spots. You know, as a pastor, I see lots of blind spots. And you know what that tells me? I've got them. From the oldest to the youngest, we all have blind spots. And that's why we need light. That's why we need to come to church. That's why we need the preaching of the word, the hearing of the word, time spent in his presence because it shows us our blind spots and it brings light so we can get ourselves out of darkness. That's what it's supposed to do. And I'll tell you this, we're forgetful people. Scripture says we're forgetful hearers. And that's why we need it all the more today than we've ever needed it before. Because this is a time of gross darkness. We'll get into this next service. It's a time when everything's murky, gloomy. And we need bright lights. I'll tell you this, God's always got a people that's looking for his word. I marvel when I look through the scriptures and I see the way that God moves. You know, brother Mark, you talked about the the God severally picking this one and that one. You look at Rahab. You talk about the the the hand of God reaching down. This is a prostitute in a heathen nation that is under judgment by God. and he reaches down sovereignly and he picks her and her family up and he says, "There you go. Kill the rest." You look at Ruth, a Moabitis, serving a god that killed their children by putting them through the fire. And out of that, God reaches down and just pulls one daughter of God woman at the well. You talk about broken. I'm betting by that point in her life, she wasn't even allowed to go to church. Pastor got tired of her. Never listens to him. Keeps messing up the same way. She's not fit for society. She's not fit for church. She's not fit for nothing. And then what happens? The light comes her way. Digs down through the muck that she's created and pulls her out. And in a moment, she realizes, I'm a child of God. That's what light does. That's the victory that we're talking about. Remember what we read earlier that God had seeds that were planted and the light was necessary to get those seeds to produce what they are. That's what God's got us here for. Amen. They could feel the light. They could have the warmth of the light and it could do a work in their life. Jesus said it this way. The people which sat in darkness saw great light. Again, brother Mark, it reminds me of you sitting under a mushroom. You say, right? You don't know anything. This young man that came to my house, he was raised Roman Catholic. And you know what? He knew nothing. Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You know what I say? We've got to witness. That's the kind of people God goes to because they don't have anything to hold them back. I pray God's grace for the young man. For each one that we get to witness to. People which sat in darkness saw great light. And to them which sat in the region and shadow of death, light is sprung up. I'll tell you this. Rahab isn't wasn't there to hear that. But I'll tell you this. You ever read that to Rahab, she say that's me. You say that to Ruth, she say that's me. You say that to Zakius, that's me. Didn't know it until the light came. Sat in darkness. sat in the region and the shadow of death and yet light is sprung up. Church, you can't go so far that he can't reach you. You can't get so broken, so failed, so sick, so miserable, so buried that the light of God can't find you. And I love how the prophet of God talks about, he says, you get that little blade of grass to start growing, it'll crack concrete to get to light. That's the power of the light. Amen. That woman at that well had completely destroyed her life. And yet in a moment she came to a reality. I'm a daughter of God. She had no clue. That's the beauty of it. She had no clue until the light came and all of a sudden something sprung forth. Quickly that light brought her to life. She said, "Is this not the very Christ?" She went in testifying. As we start to close, Brother Brham says this. I've used this quote before, but it's such a beautiful thing. We talk about gifts. We talk about the blessings of God. This is it. He says, "The real gift is your soul down in there." See that was born of God and that controls the whole thing to the word of God and the will of God. He says and there you grow up. See then you're a son and daughter of God. You're a child of God. There was a lot of seeds sitting down in that earth when light came and then he pulled the water back and he raised the the earth up so they could start to feel that warmth. But it's when you come to life that's when you find out who you really are. Otherwise, you're just in darkness and death. There's nothing there. But when you come to life, something changes. You start to realize there's more to me than I thought there was. Amen. We so often look for change. Amen. There's things I want to change in my life. There's things I want the victory over. There's things I don't like about my personality. There's things I don't like about my first reaction. And I'm saying, Lord, help me to have that better reaction. Help me to respond the way that you do. Help me not to take things personally. help me to act in love always. Amen. But what is it that's going to do that? It is not my desire. It's going to be his presence. That's the only thing that's going to do it. It's what? When the light comes in and it brings to life the reality of Christ that he buried in me from the very beginning. That's our victory. That's what we're looking for. Amen. We don't become a child of God. We always were a child of God. You know what? We do become a Christian Christlike because that's a process. Brother Brand would say we're born a baby in Christ and then we grow into his image, into his nature, into his attributes. And in the end, what people can see is Christ in us, the hope of glory. But we don't start that way. And that's the thing. I'm in the process. Anybody else in the process this morning? Amen. Nine of us. Praise the Lord. We're in a process. And guess what? when that seed when life comes forth. I was weird. I don't know why I did this when I was young, but you know, we used to do the the napkins and you put the little uh um was it beans or peas? I think it was beans, was it? You put a bean in there and then you you you just water the napkin. It was in uh elementary school. And then you you put it in there and all you did was you put it in the in the sill of the window and the light shone on it. and water and light will cause that bean to decompose and out of that will come a sprout that would eventually produce a bean plant. I'll tell you this, call me weird, I sniffed it one time. Now, I don't know if you've ever sniffed a bean that's turning into a real plant. Guess what? It stinks. Don't do it. Not recommended. Zero stars out of five. It stinks. And you know what? When life starts, it causes a mess. It causes stinky things. Why? Because the old nature is breaking up. There's a divorce that's happening. There's a death that's happening. And when death happens, messes and stinks occur with it. And so often what we're worried about is the stinks and the messes rather than the life that's coming out of it all. And so we hold back. But we've got to go through that process. We've got to let the light do the work. to manifest what God's placed inside of our lives. That's what victory is this morning. Let's stand together. That's what victory is. We can we can stand here and we can say, "Listen, Brother John, victory is is I won't smoke and I won't drink and I won't fornicate. I won't look at bad things on my uh my phone or my computer. I won't read bad books and I'll go to church and I'll read my Bible and I'll pray." We say that's what overcoming is. That's not. Those are all good things and don't ever, you know, go against those things. But that's not what overcoming is. Overcoming is life. That's what it is. Overcoming is life. Amen. So, the real overcoming is when Christ is in you and he starts to live through you. That's what overcoming looks like. Amen. And so, your very desires are caught up now in what he wants you to do. And what happens is those things just die away. those things just fall away because you don't have time, you don't have desire, you don't have inclination, you don't have energy for it even because your life is lost inside of him. And so when that seed rots away, sometimes you say, "Well, I got the Holy Ghost. Why am I still dealing with things?" Cuz things have to rot. &gt;&gt; Things have to die away. But I'll tell you what happens when things rot. They just become a part of the environment around you and they're gone. They're gone. And you can't even go pick them up once they're rotted. They stink for a while and they make us uncomfortable for a while. But that's just the sign of life that's coming out of yours, coming out of you. Don't worry about the stink. Say, "Lord, I see changes. Lord, I see life coming out. Lord, I've got victory in a new area this week. Lord, thank you for victory. I got a tremendous victory this week. I was so thankful for it. You know what my victory is? It's Jensen. He came to me yesterday and he didn't say anything. He just stuck his chin up like this. He had an inch and a half gash from when he fell down in church when he fainted. He couldn't talk right. He couldn't move his mouth. And in two weeks, church, a gash that showed his jaw through it, it was so deep is almost completely gone. And he's down playing hockey and he's fighting with his brother and he's running around with his dog as if nothing happened. Church, that's victory. That's victory. Praise the Lord for that. What is it? By his stripes, we are healed. &gt;&gt; So, what do we do with Sister Nadine now? We've got a testimony. God heals concussions. God heals cancer. God heals broken hearts. God leads. God guides. God provides. So, what do we say? The light did it before. The light can do it again. The word says it. I believe it. Lord, I'm just going to trust you and wait for it. And let let what? Victory come forth out of our faith. Scripture says, "Faith is the victory that overcomes the world." Why? Because it holds us in place until God produces the thing we've been believing. Amen. That's the victory he's looking for. I say, "Lord, help my faith to hold. Lord, help my faith to stay strong." When I can't see the spirit moving, I've got to believe that by your word, it's moving anyways. and the results are coming soon. Amen. Let's bow our heads. Lord Jesus, Lord, we're here for victory this morning. Lord, we're here for faith this morning, Lord. And I trust we can be encouraged, Lord, that as you've shown us from the beginning, light defeats darkness every time, Lord. When Satan tries to put in when the powers of the enemy come against us, Lord, when life comes at us, Lord, we've got a greater life. We've got a supernatural life. Lord, we've got an eternal life that pushes back and says, "Not today." Lord, I pray you hold us. Help us to trust you, Lord. Lord, the scripture says, "They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They'll rise up with wings as eagles. They'll walk and not be weary. They'll run and they'll not faint." And then says, "Teach me, Lord. Teach me, Lord, to wait." Lord, I pray you help us to strengthen ourselves in the waiting time. Lord, that the spirit of God will raise up a standard, pouring in more of your word, more of your spirit, Lord, to let us hold fast while we wait for the reality of what we believed. Lord, we believe we're an overcoming bride by your word. Lord, we believe we're a spotless, sinless bride by your blood. And Lord, we're here this morning saying, Lord, we want to have the reality of that every single day. Lord, lift our eyes a little higher. Lord, strengthen feeble knees and weary hands. Lord, help our mouth, Lord, to confess the things that you say. Lord, and let our life produce our confession. We pray. Lord, bless your people, Lord. We're missing many today, Lord. We ask a special grace to them, those that are sick, Lord. We want to remember Sister Dadine in particular. Heavenly Father, Lord, that you would reach down into her situation, Lord, with Sister Cassandra as she's helping her. Lord, may you just be with them, Lord. Give us wisdom and how to help as well. Lord, let us be your hands and feet. We pray. Lord, those that are sick as well, Lord, Sister Beverly, Brother Ron, Lord, the different ones. We pray your mercy and grace this morning. In Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen. Amen. Let's sing that song. He's in the house. 11:37. Little girl was lying [singing] there. The people all were weeping. They just laughed at Jesus when he said she's only sleeping. As he took her by the hand, [music] she began [singing] to live again. Some began to praise [music and singing] the Lord. And some began to say, "He's in the house. [music] Death has to flee." [music] Now there [singing] is light where darkness used [music] to be. Now there is hope. There's no more doubt. [singing] [music] Praise his name. Oh, praise [music and singing] his name. He's in the house. [music] We were like [singing] that little girl dead in all our sins. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Jesus touched this heart of mine and gave me life again. [music] I am just a house of clay. [music] But ever since that blessed day, there's a light that shines in me [music] for all the world to see. [singing] He's in the house. [music] Death has to flee. Now there is light. [music] Where darkness used to be. Now there is [music] hope. There's no more doubt. Praise [music] his name. Praise [singing] his name. [music] He's in the house. [music] We were like that little girl dead in all our sins. Till Jesus [music] touched this heart of mine and gave me life again. [music] I am just a house away. But ever since [music] that blessed day, there's a light that shines in me for all [music] the world to see. He's in the house. [music] Death has to flee. Now there is light where darkness used to [music] be. Now there is hope. There's no more doubt. [music] Praise his name. Praise [music] his name. He's in the house. Death [music] has to flee. Now there is light [music] where darkness used to be. Now there [singing] is hope. There's [music] no more doubt. Praise his name. Praise his [music] name. He's in the house. [music] The little girl was lying there. The [music] people are weeping. They just laughed at [music] Jesus when he said she's only sleeping. And as he took her by the [music] head, she began to live again. [music] Some began to praise his name. Some began to say, [music and singing] "He's in the house. Death has to flee. Now there [music and singing] is light. Where darkness used to be, now there [music] is hope, there's no more doubt. Praise his name. [music] Praise his name. He's in the house [music] where death has to flee. Now there is [music and singing] light where darkness used to be. Now there is hope. There's [music] no more doubt. Praise his name.

[singing] Praise his name. Praise his [music] name. He's in the house. You look at that story in the scripture. Gyrus says, "Lord, my daughter's sick. Will you come heal her?" Jesus says, "I'll go." They're on the way there. And on the way there, he's interrupted by a woman with a blood issue. She's healed. And he says, "It's according to your faith that you got that." Then they continue on the way. And the servant comes and he says to Gyrus, he says, "Your daughter's dead. Don't bother him anymore." You know what Jesus said? Jesus said, "Be not afraid, only believe." She's dead, dark, beyond hope, lifeless. He says, "Be not afraid, only believe." He said elsewhere, "If thou can't believe, all things are possible." And that we've been praying for a lot of things. I think this is the year I've prayed more than ever. &gt;&gt; That's a good thing. means I'm going to the right place. But I'll tell you this, church. We're facing situations that haven't moved. We're facing hardships, lost ones, brokenness, besetting sins, people that can't seem to get the victory, and it seems hopeless. I say this this morning, be not afraid, only believe. And then you hold fast to what God has said. Let him do the work. I was listening to brother Steven Coffee just briefly this morning preaching to brother Aaron Mciris and he was saying you know there's a work we've got to do and that's a we've got to resist and that's a flesh work that's a natural resistance that's a a mental resistance but it's got to be by the spirit that we overcome sometimes that's the problem is we're trying to do it all instead of letting him do it in us we resist it's him that makes the devil flee if thou can't Believe this morning all things are possible. Then we're going to sing that song. I know we've just sung it, but my hope is in the Lord. His tender mercies come with every rising on that one. I stand in awe within the presence of [music] the Lord. In whom the wisdom of the ages [music] lies. For whom the raging [music] of the sea subsides. The living [music and singing] sacrifice. The only source of life, [music] my [singing] hope is in the Lord [music] from this [singing] time on and ever more. Oh [music] my hope is in [singing] the Lord forever [music] more. Lord and his tender mercies [singing] come with every [music] rising sun to meet the [singing] sinner in his brokenness [music] to offer healing [singing] and forgiveness. [music] Hallelujah. And those [singing] who trust in him will find their hearts [music] at rest. My hope is in the Lord. [music] From this time [singing] on and ever more. [music] Oh my hope is in [music] the Lord forever more. And I stand in all within [music] the presence of the Lord. In whom the [singing] wisdom of the ages [music] lies. for whom the raging [music] of the sea subsides. The living [music] sacrifice, the only source of life, [music] my hope is in the Lord.

[music] Oh my hope is in [singing] the Lord [music] forever more. [music] My hope is in [singing] the Lord. From this time on [music] and ever more. All my hope [music] is in [singing] the Lord. Lord, one more time. [music] Oh, my hope is in the Lord from this time [music and singing] on and ever more. Oh, my hope [music] is [singing] in the Lord forever more. [music] He is able, more than able, 7:21 to accomplish what concerns me today. He is able more than a to accomplish [singing and music] what concerns me today. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord for he [music] is able. Praise your name. Thank you Lord. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord Jesus. [music] Hallelujah. Thank you Lord. Praise your name. Glory. Thank you Lord. Hallelujah. He is able. [music] Hallelujah. Thank you Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. Hallelujah. Praise his name. Hallelujah. [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you Lord Jesus. [music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. to make me what he wants me to be. Sing it again. And he is able, more than a [music] to accomplish what concerns me today. [music] He is aable, more [music] than a. He can handle [music] anything that comes my way. He is aable, [music] more than a to do much more than I could [music] ever dream. He is able, more than [singing] a.
