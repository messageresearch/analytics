[36:46] I know you're drawing [music]
[36:50] me to yourself.

[37:00] Amen. Hallelujah. [singing and music]

[37:12] Curse me

[37:22] to the father's
[37:26] man.
[37:27] Hallelujah.

[38:30] You [music] gently call me into your
[38:35] [singing] presence,
[38:38] guiding me by [music]
[38:41] your [singing] Holy Spirit
[38:44] and teach me, [music] dear Lord,
[38:48] to live all my life
[38:52] to [music]

[38:59] I'm captured by [music]
[39:03] your holy [singing] calling.
[39:06] Set [music] me aart.
[39:09] I know you're drawing [music]
[39:12] [singing]
[39:13] me to yourself.

[39:25] Amen. Praise the Lord. Take me
[39:30] to Lord [music]
[39:32] me.
[39:38] Fail me.
[39:40] [music] I give my [singing] life
[39:45] to the father's
[39:48] hand. [music]
[39:51] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. [music]
[39:55] and call me
[39:59] guide. [music]
[40:02] Lead me, walk beside
[40:07] me. [music]
[40:09] I give my life
[40:13] to the [singing] potters.
[40:16] [music] Take me, Lord me, use me.
[40:20] Hallelujah.
[40:22] [music]
[40:23] or take me
[40:27] on. [music]
[40:33] [music]
[40:37] I give my life
[40:41] [music] to the potter [singing]
[40:44] hand.
[40:46] [music]
[40:51] &gt;&gt; [music]
[40:51] &gt;&gt; Call me,
[40:55] guide me,
[40:58] [music]
[40:58] lead me, walk beside [singing]
[41:03] me.
[41:05] I give my life
[41:09] to the potter's [music and singing]
[41:12] hand.
[41:19] Amen. Heavenly Father, Lord, that's
[41:22] certainly our prayer tonight.
[41:25] Lord, that you could take your word,
[41:28] Lord. You could quicken it by your
[41:29] spirit [music] and you could mold us,
[41:31] Lord, into the very image that you had
[41:33] of us before the foundation of the
[41:34] [music] world, Lord God. Lord, we want
[41:37] to step into the heavenly kingdom, Lord.
[41:39] We want to step back into eternity. We
[41:41] want to step back into your thoughts,
[41:42] into your will, and into your way,
[41:44] heavenly father. Lord, and that's why
[41:46] we've gathered tonight, Lord, is to let
[41:47] your word do a [music] work, Lord. that
[41:49] your spirit would take it, Lord. That it
[41:52] would make it live in us, Lord. That it
[41:53] would just stir our hearts and stir our
[41:55] souls, Lord. That it would move from the
[41:57] eternal, Lord, into the temporal, Lord,
[41:59] and change these bodies, Lord. Change
[42:01] these minds and bring them into
[42:03] subjection to you, Lord. We pray you
[42:05] take this service, Lord. That you would
[42:07] speak to your [music] people, your bride
[42:08] that's gathered, Lord. May you just
[42:10] minister on this Wednesday night, Lord.
[42:11] Encourage us for our walk, Lord. Correct
[42:14] us, give us direction. Lord, lead us and
[42:16] guide us. we pray. Heavenly Father, in
[42:18] your name we ask and pray it. Amen.
[42:21] Amen. God bless you. Turn if you would
[42:22] to Psalms chapter 143.
[42:26] Psalms 143. Amen. God bless you. Good to
[42:30] see each one that's made it here
[42:31] tonight. Certainly getting colder out
[42:33] there and darker.
[42:35] Amen. But we trust there's sunshine and
[42:38] warmth coming sometime ahead in six
[42:40] months or so, maybe.
[42:43] Amen. Unless you happen to get away and
[42:44] go south somewhere.
[42:46] Amen. Psalms 143 and verse one says,
[42:50] "Hear my prayer, O Lord. Give ear to my
[42:53] supplications, but watch how David says
[42:55] this." In thy faithfulness, answer me,
[42:59] and in thy righteousness. Let's go to
[43:01] verse eight. He says, "Cause me to hear
[43:04] thy loving kindness in the morning, for
[43:06] in thee do I trust. Cause me to know the
[43:09] way wherein I should walk, for I lift up
[43:12] my soul unto thee." Verse 10, teach me
[43:15] to do thy will, for thou art my God, thy
[43:19] spirit is good. Lead me into the land of
[43:23] uprightness. Amen. God bless you. You
[43:24] can have your seats tonight. And we're
[43:26] continuing our Wednesday night series on
[43:29] teach us to pray. And I want to take a a
[43:31] thought tonight on the the right
[43:33] approach. And this is going to be pretty
[43:34] simple stuff, but I think when we're
[43:36] getting into prayer, it ought to be
[43:37] simple stuff because everybody's
[43:39] supposed to be able to pray and pray
[43:41] effectively and know how they're
[43:43] supposed to pray. But we're going to dig
[43:44] into this tonight and see where it kind
[43:46] of applies to our lives. And I want to
[43:48] start with the quote that we ended with
[43:50] last service. And it kind of gives us a
[43:52] kick, I think, in the pants and or the
[43:54] skirt as the the need may be. But we
[43:56] sometimes we need a wake up. Sometimes
[43:59] we God just needs to kind of come along
[44:00] and give us a little tap, give us a
[44:02] little kick to get us out of our
[44:04] doldrums, to get us out of our our
[44:06] channels and our grooves and our ruts
[44:07] that we get into. And this was supposed
[44:10] to kind of knock us out of the idea of
[44:11] saying a prayer and getting into the
[44:13] idea of praying, communing with God,
[44:16] having fellowship with God. And brother
[44:17] Brown would say this. He says, "Quit
[44:19] your formal worship."
[44:22] Quit your formal worship.
[44:24] What's he talking about? doing the same
[44:27] thing the same way every time.
[44:31] Prescriptive worship. This is the way
[44:34] we're going to do it. And this can be a
[44:35] real challenge for a preacher. It can be
[44:36] a real challenge for a song leader that
[44:39] we're just going to do it the same way
[44:40] every time. We're going to sing the song
[44:43] all the way through and then we're going
[44:44] to repeat one verse and we're going to
[44:46] repeat the chorus once and then we're
[44:47] going to move on to the next song. Or we
[44:48] we can only sing a song three times
[44:50] otherwise the people will get tired or
[44:52] it gets repetitive. No, we can't do
[44:53] that. We don't have to sing every
[44:56] service, have two slow songs, a fast
[44:58] song, a sort of fast song, and then two
[45:00] slow songs as the pastor comes up. We
[45:02] can have a song service that's all fast
[45:03] songs from start to finish. And we can
[45:05] have one that's all slow songs. We can
[45:06] have hymns on time. We can have more
[45:08] modern song. There's no prescription to
[45:10] this. But the idea of what he's getting
[45:12] at is we become prescriptive. And what
[45:14] we do is we get away from the leading of
[45:16] the spirit. That's formalism is getting
[45:19] out of the leadership of the Holy
[45:20] Spirit. He says, "Quit your formal
[45:22] worship and get into fellowship with him
[45:25] once." He says, "Stop this going to
[45:27] church on Sunday." Again, formality
[45:30] and saying a little prayer every night
[45:32] before you go to bed. He says, "And
[45:35] really get out." In other words, get
[45:38] away from that formality. Get away from
[45:39] the tradition. Get away from the
[45:41] distractions and come into fellowship.
[45:43] He says, "My, you'll hurry up and wash
[45:45] the dishes so you'll get back to
[45:47] fellowship again." What does fellowship
[45:49] look like? reading the word and talking
[45:51] with him. That's what we need.
[45:55] He says that's what the world needs
[45:56] today, Christian friend. That's what you
[45:58] need. That's what I need. That's what
[46:00] the whole world needs is back to
[46:03] fellowship to fellowship with him and
[46:06] know him. Amen. So, we saw there that
[46:08] fellowship with God hinges on two
[46:09] things. Reading your Bible, reading the
[46:11] word, and praying. And that's the
[46:13] personal portion of your walk with God.
[46:16] That's the personal portion of your
[46:18] fellowship. And you determine how often.
[46:22] You determine the effectiveness.
[46:25] You determine how far you want him to
[46:27] go. God doesn't determine that. You
[46:29] determine that because you're the one
[46:30] that has to give him the time. You're
[46:32] the one that has to give him the
[46:33] attention. You're the one that has to
[46:34] give him the priority. And fellowship is
[46:37] something that's in our hands. It's in
[46:39] our hands. Amen. You come to church and
[46:42] you listen to the preacher for an hour,
[46:43] an hour and a half on a bad day, uh,
[46:45] twice a week. And that's good. And you
[46:47] have to do that. But the rest of the
[46:49] week, what you do with your time and in
[46:51] growing your relationship with God,
[46:53] that's purely in your hands. Amen. I
[46:56] can't make you get grow in relationship
[46:58] with God. You have to grow in
[47:00] relationship with God. And you've got to
[47:02] be on speaking terms with God, if I can
[47:03] put it that way. And that's what prayer
[47:05] is about. Amen. And that's what this
[47:07] series is all about. Showing the
[47:09] approach and the purpose of prayer and
[47:11] how it's effective in our lives and what
[47:13] God's trying to do in our lives. and
[47:15] then how God's using that to make us
[47:16] effective in other people's lives and in
[47:19] situations and these things. And we've
[47:20] got a a lot of ground to cover in this
[47:22] series. Not tonight. I'm not going to
[47:23] preach long tonight by God's grace, but
[47:25] we've got a lot to cover because there's
[47:27] a lot of questions. Why do we pray and
[47:29] what's God trying to do with it? But the
[47:30] primary element is that he's restoring
[47:33] fellowship. It's personal relationship
[47:36] with him that matters. Amen. And if
[47:38] you've got that, he'll take you all the
[47:40] way through. Amen. Now, when Jesus was
[47:42] here 2,000 years ago, his disciples came
[47:44] to him. They said, "Teach us to pray."
[47:47] And I'm taking inspiration from that on
[47:49] this series when they said, "Teach us to
[47:50] pray." They're what what are they
[47:52] saying? It's not that they didn't have a
[47:53] way of praying. But they said, "Teach us
[47:55] how to pray effectively.
[47:58] Teach us the way that would please God,
[48:00] that would make God hear our prayers.
[48:02] Show us the right way to do that." And
[48:04] listen to what Jesus says. And we're
[48:05] going to just spend our time here this
[48:06] night this night and hopefully kind of
[48:08] expound on it as we go. And Jesus before
[48:10] he tells them how to pray, he tells them
[48:12] how not to pray. Because what? There's a
[48:15] lot of traditions. There's a lot of of
[48:17] leanings that people take. And watch
[48:19] what he says here in Matthew 6.
[48:22] But when ye pray, use not vain
[48:24] repetitions as the heathen do, for they
[48:27] think that they shall be heard, for
[48:28] there are much speaking. Now, I think we
[48:30] could preach all night just on this
[48:32] thought because you'll see today people
[48:34] that just want to go on and on and on
[48:39] to appear spiritual,
[48:41] thinking that the longer they go, the
[48:43] further they're going to get with God.
[48:45] Amen. But Jesus said, "I'm going to do
[48:48] it." Don't be wordy when you pray. Don't
[48:51] say things in the longest possible way.
[48:54] Don't say it 18 different times, just
[48:57] with different words. What was I just
[48:59] doing there? I was expounding that out.
[49:02] I was making it longer than it had to
[49:03] be. He says, "You don't need to do this
[49:05] with God. Don't do it." He said, "The
[49:06] heathen do that thinking that the longer
[49:08] they say something, the more of God's
[49:10] attention and blessing and response
[49:13] they're going to get." God is not about
[49:15] length. Like anything of God, it's about
[49:19] quality, not quantity. You'll find that
[49:21] with God. Amen. It's not about these
[49:23] these things. Amen. And so, that's not
[49:25] the way to pray. Jesus isn't against
[49:27] praying a long time. Jesus prayed a lot.
[49:30] We're talking about the man here. He was
[49:31] what? He was trying to get connected to
[49:33] the God that was within him. And he
[49:35] prayed a lot. Paul prayed a lot. Job
[49:38] prayed a lot. David prayed a lot. It's
[49:40] not about whether or not you're praying
[49:42] a long time. It's about what are you
[49:43] saying when you pray. That's what he's
[49:46] getting down to. Amen. It's about the
[49:47] content, not the length that we have.
[49:49] And it's about the sincerity that we
[49:51] have. Not about putting on a show for
[49:53] God or for others.
[49:55] for God or for others. Church, it
[49:57] doesn't impress me if you get up here
[49:59] and pray for 10 minutes. If we ask you
[50:02] to come up and pray, that doesn't
[50:03] impress me. Now, if you pray for 10
[50:05] minutes anointed with quality to it, a
[50:07] sincerity to it, praise the Lord. But
[50:09] I'll tell you what, we've had people
[50:10] come in and they pray and they they you
[50:12] couldn't get them out of the pulpit fast
[50:13] enough because it was about them. It
[50:15] wasn't about God. And they were trying
[50:17] to impress people with their
[50:18] spirituality, how long they can pray.
[50:20] That is not what we're talking about. In
[50:21] fact, Jesus would warn his disciples. He
[50:24] said, "Then in the audience of all the
[50:25] people, he said unto his disciples,
[50:27] Beware of the scribes, which desire to
[50:29] walk in long robes, and love greetings
[50:32] in the markets, and the highest seats in
[50:34] the synagogues, and the chief rooms, the
[50:36] chief seats at feasts." He says, "Which
[50:39] devour widows houses." So they'd use the
[50:41] law to take away widows houses. And
[50:44] watch this, "For a show make long
[50:47] prayers." He said, "The same shall
[50:49] receive greater damnation."
[50:53] because they're teaching people to do
[50:55] something God doesn't want to do.
[50:57] They're getting people to put on a show,
[50:59] to put on a facade, to have an image of
[51:02] spirituality rather than being truly
[51:04] spiritual, rather than being truly
[51:06] sincere, rather than talking about what
[51:08] God really wants to hear.
[51:11] The longer we go, the more it is about
[51:12] us.
[51:17] He said, "You don't need to repeat those
[51:19] things with God. You don't impress him
[51:20] with those things." You might impress
[51:21] some people, shallow people, people with
[51:25] a lack of discernment, but you won't
[51:26] impress God. So don't go down that way.
[51:28] But re watch why he says this, and this
[51:30] is such a beautiful thing. Watch why
[51:32] Jesus says you don't need to do that. He
[51:35] says, "Be ye not therefore like unto
[51:38] them. For your father knoweth what
[51:41] things you have need of before you ask
[51:43] him." Church, I love that God's aware of
[51:46] our situations. God knows what's going
[51:48] on. God not only sees it but his very
[51:51] name Jehovah Gyra means it's God who
[51:54] sees the name the need and prepares an
[51:57] answer for it before you ask. That's the
[52:00] nature of God is that in seeing all
[52:03] things in understanding what's going
[52:05] through our life, he has an answer
[52:07] already prepared before you ask him. So
[52:10] you don't have to
[52:12] beat down his door by telling him
[52:15] everything and droning on and on. Amen.
[52:17] He knows what we need before we ask. But
[52:19] here's the thing. He says he knows what
[52:22] things you have need of.
[52:25] We don't often know what we have need
[52:27] of. We know the need, but we don't know
[52:29] what we have need of. We don't know what
[52:30] will actually fix the problem. I
[52:32] guarantee you, Brother Matt knows a
[52:33] whole lot about this. A client brings
[52:35] you in and he says, "Uh, you know, Matt,
[52:37] I've got a problem with this equipment
[52:38] and here's the problem." Matt goes in
[52:40] there. I guarantee you most of the time
[52:42] it's not what they think. A lot of times
[52:43] I would say it's not what they think.
[52:45] Sometimes it's really obvious, but you
[52:46] dig deeper and you find out where the
[52:48] real problem is. That's where the need
[52:50] is. The need is not the the symptom. The
[52:53] need is what's causing the symptom.
[52:55] Anyone that's been in medicine, I'm not,
[52:57] but when doctors go, we turn medicine
[52:59] into treating symptoms instead of
[53:01] treating the root cause. And God knows
[53:03] the root cause. God knows what we really
[53:05] have need of. Amen. So we don't have to
[53:08] go to God in prayer and prescribe our
[53:10] need. What we have to do is describe our
[53:13] situation
[53:15] because he already knows what's at the
[53:17] root of it. He knows what we have need
[53:19] of. So what we do is we're coming in
[53:20] prayer and we're giving him the
[53:22] situation. We're committing the
[53:24] situation, the circumstances, the
[53:26] thoughts, the the the whatever it might
[53:28] be. And that's the beauty of a true
[53:30] father is that he'll give you what you
[53:32] need, not what you ask for. He'll give
[53:35] you what's really going to benefit you
[53:37] rather than what you really want in your
[53:39] heart. Amen.
[53:42] We have real and physical needs. That's
[53:44] just a a part of being human on this
[53:46] earth. Amen. And we can pray to God for
[53:48] those things and we can provide for
[53:49] them. But remember what Paul said. He
[53:51] says, "I've never seen the righteous
[53:53] forsaken nor his seed begging bread."
[53:56] God always provides for you. I'm a
[53:57] testimony of that. Amen. I've made lots
[54:00] of money and I've made very little
[54:01] money, but I've never had to bake bread.
[54:03] I've always had what I needed. Sometimes
[54:06] down to the last second, but I always
[54:08] had what I needed. Amen. But we have to
[54:10] see things in the priorities that God
[54:13] sees them in rather than going in
[54:15] because this flesh rises to the top and
[54:18] it wants to dominate our prayer lives.
[54:20] And let me tell you, church, this flesh
[54:22] is the last thing we ought to be praying
[54:23] about. That's the last thing we ought to
[54:26] be praying about. We'll get into this as
[54:27] we go through this and watch what Jesus
[54:29] would say. Now, we're we're reading from
[54:31] Matthew 6, but this is after he teaches
[54:33] him to pray. He says, "Now take
[54:35] therefore therefore take no thought,
[54:37] saying, what shall we eat or what shall
[54:39] we drink or with wherewith all shall we
[54:41] be clothed? For after all these things
[54:43] do the Gentiles seek." Who's a Gentile
[54:45] here tonight? All of us. That's what
[54:48] this world focuses on.
[54:52] So, guess what the influence of this
[54:53] world is, church? to try and get us to
[54:56] focus on that. And that can bleed into
[54:58] our prayer life where that's all we're
[55:00] praying about
[55:02] what we just talked about here. He says,
[55:04] "For all these things do the Gentiles
[55:06] seek. What are we going to eat? What are
[55:07] we going to drink? What will we be
[55:09] clothed? What are we going to do to pay
[55:10] rent? How are we going to get to our
[55:11] work?" He says, "For your heavenly
[55:14] father knoweth that you have need of all
[55:16] these things. But seek ye first
[55:19] something else. Don't be like the rest
[55:21] of He says, "Seek ye first the kingdom
[55:23] of God and his righteousness, and all
[55:26] these things shall be added unto you."
[55:30] Now, for those of you that weren't here,
[55:31] I'm going to repeat a testimony we heard
[55:34] on Saturday night at the prayer meeting
[55:35] because Sister Becky gave us a wonderful
[55:38] testimony, and I I so enjoyed it, and
[55:40] and I hope I get this right, Sister
[55:42] Becky. She had a deadline to deliver
[55:44] some ideas to her employer on Thursday
[55:48] morning. So, she was a it was Wednesday
[55:52] afternoon and she had to have some
[55:54] ideas, some some creative ideas and she
[55:56] didn't have them by Wednesday afternoon.
[55:59] So, in her natural,
[56:01] she said, "Well, I'm probably not going
[56:03] to go to church then because I've got
[56:06] something that's due on Thursday
[56:08] morning." The meeting was first thing
[56:09] Thursday morning. But she said something
[56:12] inside her said, "No, go to church."
[56:16] Church, what is that? That ain't God or
[56:18] sorry that's not Satan. That's the Holy
[56:20] Spirit. That's the Holy Spirit that
[56:22] rises up. It raises a standard and says,
[56:24] "How about you try me first? How about
[56:27] you try me first?" And so she committed
[56:30] in her heart to go to church. She
[56:31] reached out to brother Mark and Sister
[56:32] Moren said, "Hey, can you pick me up for
[56:34] church tonight?" And she said, "If I
[56:37] have to stay up till midnight to get
[56:39] this done, that's what I'll do instead."
[56:42] Okay. Now, let's put ourselves in her
[56:44] shoes tonight. What is our natural way
[56:47] of praying
[56:49] from a fleshly standpoint? Our fleshly
[56:52] way of praying would say, "Lord, give me
[56:54] those ideas now so I can go to church
[56:58] tonight."
[57:00] Or, "Lord, help me get those ideas so
[57:02] I'm ready for work tomorrow morning."
[57:05] But if you look at the priority there,
[57:07] what is it? The priority is give me what
[57:09] my work says
[57:12] rather than give me what you said.
[57:15] Okay.
[57:17] Well, what did Jesus say to do? He said,
[57:20] "Seek ye first the kingdom.
[57:22] Seek after that which is eternal rather
[57:24] than that which is natural." Amen. The
[57:28] Jesus is trying to get us off this this
[57:30] total uh idea of just being so caught up
[57:35] in what are we going to have tomorrow?
[57:38] How are we going to be provided for? How
[57:40] are we going to make it through? And so,
[57:42] how do we get those things? How do we
[57:43] get something to eat and drink and
[57:45] clothe? Well, we work for it.
[57:48] So, if I can put it this way, this is
[57:50] Matthew 6 uh 31 and this is the Jonathan
[57:55] Klet edition of the scripture. I hope
[57:56] it's okay. Said, "Therefore, take no
[57:58] thought, saying, I must work to eat and
[58:01] be clothed." Is that a fair description?
[58:05] So, rather than worry about what you're
[58:06] going to eat and drink, I've just
[58:07] replaced that and said worry about work
[58:09] because that's how we get all of those
[58:10] different things.
[58:12] Jesus is saying, "Don't get worked up
[58:14] over your physical needs." He's that
[58:16] he's telling us not to be worried about
[58:18] our jobs or our businesses or our
[58:20] careers so much that they do they
[58:22] dominate our lives and our time and our
[58:25] decisions and our priorities. Amen. That
[58:27] can't be why we do things.
[58:30] But Sister Becky said instead, she said,
[58:32] "Lord, I'll go to church and I'll give
[58:34] up my time to do what you want me to
[58:37] do." God bless her for that. That's the
[58:39] kind of attitude God can bless.
[58:42] That's something God can work with. When
[58:44] you say, "I'm going to give you the
[58:45] priority." God says, "Hey, I can work
[58:47] with a child that's doing that." And
[58:49] what happened after that? Those of you
[58:51] that were here know she committed to
[58:53] going to church. And she did that. And
[58:55] later that evening before she had to
[58:57] stay up and do the extra work,
[59:00] she got an email saying the meeting's
[59:02] been moved till 3 p.m. So now she has
[59:05] the entire next of next of her workday
[59:08] to get all these ideas.
[59:11] Amen.
[59:13] She got to have her cake and eat it,
[59:14] too.
[59:16] Church, do you see what prayer is
[59:18] supposed to do? Prayer is supposed to
[59:21] take us and bring us closer to him and
[59:24] his word, not satisfy the flesh. Not
[59:27] give us what the flesh needs, give us
[59:29] what the spirit needs, give us what the
[59:30] soul needs. Feed the eternal rather than
[59:33] feed the natural. Amen. And that gives
[59:36] him something that he can bless,
[59:38] something he can respond to, something
[59:40] he can take and use
[59:42] because we're stepping into his word
[59:45] rather than stepping into our fleshly
[59:46] nature. He's not looking to bless those
[59:49] things. We and we can step into his word
[59:51] and give him things in proper priority.
[59:54] That's when he can bless us. Amen. That
[59:56] that that testimony from Sister Becky so
[59:58] blessed me because it showed the simp
[1:00:00] simple way to find favor with God.
[1:00:04] Simply give him first place. It's that
[1:00:08] simple. Give him first place and all of
[1:00:10] those things. Amen. What Sister Becky
[1:00:12] needed was more time. What was the
[1:00:14] temptation?
[1:00:16] The temptation was I need more time, so
[1:00:19] I'll take God's time.
[1:00:22] Church, that's not your time to take.
[1:00:25] It's like tithing. There's a portion
[1:00:27] that belongs to him, and we don't get to
[1:00:30] take it for ourselves when we want to.
[1:00:32] That's the way it works. Amen. How easy
[1:00:37] is it? It seems like the easiest thing
[1:00:39] we have these days is we take away from
[1:00:41] God and we say, "Lord, forgive me. Lord,
[1:00:44] grant me grace. Lord, grant me mercy."
[1:00:47] The thing is, you're taking away your
[1:00:49] grace and mercy by taking away your time
[1:00:51] with him.
[1:00:53] And it becomes easier and easier the
[1:00:55] more you do it the more you take. And
[1:00:57] you'll waste your time and take his.
[1:01:01] Amen. Can I be a pastor tonight?
[1:01:04] When we take away from him, we're not
[1:01:06] cheating him. We're cheating ourselves.
[1:01:08] We're actually losing and those things.
[1:01:10] So, what did Sister Becky do? She
[1:01:12] committed her time to God.
[1:01:16] And God said, "I'll give that right back
[1:01:18] to you. In fact, I'll give you more time
[1:01:20] than you were going to have." And you
[1:01:22] didn't have to lose sleep and you could
[1:01:24] have rest that night. I hope you got
[1:01:25] some rest that night. Amen. What'd she
[1:01:29] do? She said, "Lord, I'm going to make
[1:01:30] you the first priority, church. You
[1:01:32] can't outgive God. You cannot outgive
[1:01:36] God with your time, your energy."
[1:01:38] Listen, I'm not asking you for your
[1:01:40] money, but you give him your tithes and
[1:01:42] watch what he does. Church, I'm a I'm a
[1:01:44] testimony. Many brothers in here have
[1:01:46] testimonies of it. I was talking with a
[1:01:48] brother the other day, and we were kind
[1:01:50] of talking about, boy, you look at what
[1:01:51] you give at the end of the year, and
[1:01:52] that's a chunk of money.
[1:01:55] That's a new car sitting in your
[1:01:56] driveway. That's a nice vacation sitting
[1:01:59] in your driveway. Not a new car based on
[1:02:02] one year's ties, church. It's a car
[1:02:04] payment. Ain't nobody making that kind
[1:02:06] of money here. I don't think. [snorts]
[1:02:09] But you know what I'm saying? You look
[1:02:10] at that and the carnal mind says, "What
[1:02:12] could you do with that extra money?" You
[1:02:15] know what? I'm doing just fine without
[1:02:17] it. I'm doing just fine without it. And
[1:02:19] look what the Lord has blessed us with
[1:02:21] because of that. The grace and the favor
[1:02:23] that we have. Why? Because we're giving
[1:02:24] him something to use. Amen. We can't
[1:02:26] give him too much. We can't give him too
[1:02:28] much time, too much priority.
[1:02:31] We can't become too fanatical for him to
[1:02:34] spend time with him. By that, I mean,
[1:02:35] amen. Watch what Brother Bram says here.
[1:02:37] Because God will never leave you
[1:02:39] forsaken. You commit it to him. You give
[1:02:41] him first priority. He'll never forsake
[1:02:43] you. He, Brother Bam, says, "Seek ye
[1:02:44] first the kingdom of God." Have you ever
[1:02:46] witnessed that to be the truth? He says,
[1:02:48] "Put God first. Pay your tithes first.
[1:02:52] Pay God." He says, "Pray first at
[1:02:54] morning. Pray all through the day. Give
[1:02:57] God the first place in everything.
[1:02:59] What'll happen? You'll be a witness,
[1:03:03] church. I want to be a witness of God. I
[1:03:05] want to be a witness of Jesus Christ
[1:03:07] daily in my life. How do I get there?
[1:03:09] Give him first. Put God first. Amen. I
[1:03:13] have told you before how I used to wake
[1:03:15] up in the morning, first thing I do is
[1:03:16] look at my phone and check my messages.
[1:03:18] And then a Holy Ghost anointed preacher
[1:03:20] came and what did he do? He pinned me to
[1:03:22] the wall. Brother Dwayne Far came and he
[1:03:24] preached. I'll tell you what, he pinned
[1:03:25] a lot of us to the wall. Just cuz you're
[1:03:27] a preacher or a minister doesn't get you
[1:03:29] out of the out of the crosshairs. God
[1:03:31] knows how to nail you down. And he
[1:03:32] nailed me down. And since that time, I
[1:03:34] said, "Yes, Lord, that's me. You've got
[1:03:36] me." And since that time, when I get up
[1:03:38] in the morning, what I do is I set two
[1:03:39] alarms. I set an alarm to wake me, and
[1:03:42] then I set an alarm to get me out of
[1:03:44] bed. And in between two of those is my
[1:03:46] morning wake up prayer time.
[1:03:49] So, it's only 10 or 15 minutes, but
[1:03:52] that's my time to wake up and spend just
[1:03:55] a little time with him. And what is that
[1:03:57] for, church? It sets the tone for my
[1:03:59] day. It reminds me whose child I am. It
[1:04:03] reminds me who my daddy is. It reminds
[1:04:05] me what's important. It sets my mind on
[1:04:08] him before it sets my mind on everything
[1:04:10] else. And then from there, I get up, I
[1:04:12] shower, I I listen to a message while
[1:04:14] I'm getting ready. Then I go downstairs,
[1:04:16] I read my Bible, and I pray. And then I
[1:04:18] come up and eat some breakfast. And what
[1:04:20] does that do, church? That sets me in a
[1:04:22] channel that God comes first. That I
[1:04:26] have given him priority and my day is in
[1:04:29] his hands. Whether it's a good day or a
[1:04:32] bad day.
[1:04:34] Brother Bob called me and gave me a good
[1:04:35] testimony on Monday. And I needed that
[1:04:36] cuz Tuesday I had a bad day. My water
[1:04:39] heater blew up at just out of nowhere.
[1:04:41] And so I had to fix that all up on
[1:04:43] Tuesday night. I was glad I'd studied
[1:04:44] late on Monday cuz I had no time on
[1:04:46] Tuesday to do it because I was trying to
[1:04:47] get the hot hot water heater all built
[1:04:50] up again in the house and everything.
[1:04:53] But guess what? Whether the hot water
[1:04:55] heater blows up or I get a promotion, it
[1:04:59] matters not. My day is in his hands.
[1:05:02] I've committed myself into his hands.
[1:05:04] I've given him priority and I trust that
[1:05:06] all things that happen are for my good.
[1:05:10] And so in the good times we praise his
[1:05:11] name and in the bad times do the same.
[1:05:13] Because we're in an attitude of
[1:05:14] fellowship,
[1:05:16] not just running to him every time we
[1:05:17] have a need.
[1:05:20] It's a nice thing at the end of the day
[1:05:21] say, "Lord, thank you for a good day."
[1:05:24] It's also a nice thing to say, "Lord,
[1:05:25] thank you for a not so good day, but we
[1:05:27] got through it anyhow."
[1:05:29] Because guess what? There's probably
[1:05:30] more of those than there are days where
[1:05:31] it was just all sunshine and roses.
[1:05:35] But what did he say? Put God first. You
[1:05:37] put God first. That's when you'll be a
[1:05:39] witness
[1:05:41] because God's got the priority in your
[1:05:43] life. What's going to come out is what
[1:05:44] has the priority. Christ is a priority.
[1:05:47] You'll become a witness of a
[1:05:48] supernatural God. Brother say this. He
[1:05:51] says, "Now all things ought to be
[1:05:52] considered prayerfully first. Seek ye
[1:05:55] first the kingdom of God and his
[1:05:56] righteousness and all these other things
[1:05:57] will be added." He says,"I positive sure
[1:06:01] this morning if men and women could only
[1:06:03] get into the position of where their
[1:06:06] soul, their thinking, their attitude
[1:06:09] will be perfect in the sight of God,
[1:06:12] that would be one of the most powerful
[1:06:14] churches that ever existed.
[1:06:17] Anybody interested in being a powerful
[1:06:19] church?
[1:06:21] Is anybody interested in being a
[1:06:23] powerful church?" Nine of us. Praise the
[1:06:26] Lord.
[1:06:28] How do we get there?
[1:06:30] Prayerful consideration.
[1:06:34] Taking all things before the Lord.
[1:06:36] That's how become you become powerful.
[1:06:38] Because in yourself, you're not
[1:06:39] powerful. But when you're standing on
[1:06:41] the word, when you're standing in his
[1:06:42] will, when you're in the line of duty,
[1:06:46] nothing that's no weapon that's formed
[1:06:48] against you can prosper. Amen. That's
[1:06:50] when you're going to be a witness for
[1:06:52] God. And so, if I could set a theme for
[1:06:54] prayer, I think it's this. seek ye first
[1:06:57] the kingdom of God. Amen. That's what
[1:07:00] Jesus said about it. Amen. It's to to
[1:07:02] focus on our heavenly kingdom, not our
[1:07:04] earthly kingdom, and those things that
[1:07:06] are of eternal value, not just temporal
[1:07:08] value in our lives. And so Jesus
[1:07:10] continues with them. He says, "Now after
[1:07:12] this manner, therefore pray ye." So
[1:07:14] here's how you ought to pray. Our
[1:07:16] Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be
[1:07:19] thy name. Now, I want to say this before
[1:07:21] we get rolling too far. We don't pray by
[1:07:23] formula. Okay? Don't walk out of this
[1:07:25] service and and and go with a checklist
[1:07:28] and then when you get up in the morning
[1:07:29] or whenever you you take your time with
[1:07:31] God, don't go through the checklist.
[1:07:33] That's not what he's trying to do. He's
[1:07:34] showing you an approach. He's showing
[1:07:37] you the attitude. He's showing the the
[1:07:39] the mindset that we ought to approach
[1:07:41] God with. Amen. And so prayer, first of
[1:07:43] all, is communion and fellowship with
[1:07:45] God. Church, you don't always have to
[1:07:48] ask God for something when you're
[1:07:49] praying.
[1:07:51] Think of it this way, brothers. If every
[1:07:54] time our wives came to us, all she
[1:07:56] wanted was something, how would we feel
[1:07:59] about that?
[1:08:01] We probably feel a little used at times,
[1:08:03] more so when we get a little down, a
[1:08:05] little wore out. But there's times,
[1:08:07] praise the Lord, where our wives come
[1:08:09] and they don't want to ask for anything.
[1:08:11] They just want to hug us. They just want
[1:08:13] to tell us how amazing we are, how
[1:08:15] thankful they are for the hard work that
[1:08:16] we put in every week. Is that right,
[1:08:18] Brother Matt?
[1:08:20] Thank you. Got to help me tonight.
[1:08:24] There's times where she doesn't want to
[1:08:27] do anything except be with us. And those
[1:08:29] are wonderful times. Sometimes she just
[1:08:32] wants to talk. She doesn't want to ask
[1:08:34] of anything. She doesn't want to take
[1:08:36] anything. She just wants to talk. She
[1:08:38] just wants to connect. It's okay to do
[1:08:40] that.
[1:08:41] I had a really good day on Monday. And I
[1:08:44] said, "Lord, thank you for a good day.
[1:08:46] Thank you for your goodness. Thank you
[1:08:48] for your provision. Thank you for the
[1:08:50] sunshine."
[1:08:52] And that's it. I didn't sit there. This
[1:08:54] was at the end of the day, you know.
[1:08:56] Now, now I lay me down to sleep prayer.
[1:08:58] It's not a long one, but it's a sincere
[1:08:59] one. But I just said, "Lord, thank you.
[1:09:03] Thank you." And I was just so thankful
[1:09:06] for his grace for that day. That's the
[1:09:08] way we can come in. We don't always have
[1:09:10] to go in with an intention to get
[1:09:12] something from him. Amen. But Jesus is
[1:09:15] trying to get us into this attitude or
[1:09:16] this approach to God because the right
[1:09:18] approach, the right attitude will get
[1:09:20] you somewhere. And we'll see that as we
[1:09:22] go further into this, the attitude of
[1:09:24] approaching God. Amen. But the first
[1:09:26] thing that matters here is one thing.
[1:09:29] Our father which art in heaven, hallowed
[1:09:30] be thy name. In other words, there's
[1:09:33] only one God in this equation. You're
[1:09:35] God. I'm not. Our father which art in
[1:09:39] heaven. In other words, there's
[1:09:40] something that's higher than us. There's
[1:09:42] a being that we're talking to. the
[1:09:44] omnipresent, omnipresent, omniscient
[1:09:47] creator of heaven and earth, an eternal
[1:09:50] being that we are talking to. And his
[1:09:52] ways are higher than our ways. His
[1:09:54] thinking is higher than our thinking.
[1:09:56] His knowledge is greater than our
[1:09:58] knowledge. Amen. His understanding is
[1:10:00] above ours. And so when we go into this,
[1:10:03] we go into it with one thing in mind. We
[1:10:06] are here to receive, not to tell. We're
[1:10:09] not going to force his hand. We're here
[1:10:11] to have him tell us what rather than us
[1:10:15] tell him what. Amen. We can tell him
[1:10:17] what's going on, but we're not there to
[1:10:19] direct him. Amen. We can we can uh uh we
[1:10:23] can describe,
[1:10:25] but we can't prescribe.
[1:10:28] We don't go to a doctor and tell him
[1:10:30] what's wrong and then tell him what to
[1:10:31] do to fix us. Amen. When we go to our
[1:10:34] Lord and Savior, when we go to Almighty
[1:10:36] God, we tell him what's wrong, but we
[1:10:38] don't tell him how to fix it. You know
[1:10:41] how you know your kids are really
[1:10:42] learning and maturing?
[1:10:45] When they come to you and they ask for
[1:10:46] advice
[1:10:48] or wisdom or experience
[1:10:52] instead of money or permission. Because
[1:10:54] isn't that what kids normally want? They
[1:10:55] want money or permission. But you'll
[1:10:58] notice that they're growing and maturing
[1:10:59] when they want what you can give them
[1:11:03] that will lead them further in their
[1:11:05] life rather than just resources to do
[1:11:07] what they want to do.
[1:11:09] It's the same thing with God. When we
[1:11:10] come to him and we expect him to share
[1:11:13] with us his wisdom, his knowledge, his
[1:11:16] foresight, his depth,
[1:11:20] rather than try and push ours on him,
[1:11:21] that's when we're going to get a long
[1:11:22] ways with God. Okay, here's what he
[1:11:26] says. Our father which are in heaven,
[1:11:27] you're above us. As in you're in a
[1:11:29] you're in a higher plane than we are.
[1:11:31] Hallowed be thy name. That word hallowed
[1:11:33] means sanctified, consecrated. And what
[1:11:36] he's saying is, let your name be kept
[1:11:39] clean.
[1:11:40] Now, church, how does God's name be kept
[1:11:42] clean or be made dirty?
[1:11:46] Let me ask you this. How could the
[1:11:48] Curlet name be made clean or dirty?
[1:11:52] By the way, that those whose name is
[1:11:54] Curlet act?
[1:11:57] So, the hallowing of the Curlet name is
[1:11:59] based on the conduct of Jonathan and
[1:12:01] Samuel, God help us, and Blanca and
[1:12:03] Jensen.
[1:12:05] And our name goes up or down based on
[1:12:07] how we act and me of course. And of
[1:12:10] course Selena sitting in front. But we
[1:12:12] don't worry about her so much.
[1:12:15] Amen. That's what raises up the name or
[1:12:17] that's what lowers the name. That's what
[1:12:20] lowers the name. So it's no different
[1:12:21] with God. Who is the name of God? Our
[1:12:24] Lord Jesus Christ. That's the revelation
[1:12:26] of God for this for this time and for
[1:12:28] this people. Amen. And so who is named
[1:12:31] Christ? Who bears the name of Christ?
[1:12:34] You and I do. We are Christians. We bear
[1:12:37] the name of Christ. What we do, good or
[1:12:39] bad, reflects on him. And so the first
[1:12:42] thing that we're asking is that through
[1:12:45] us, God will be raised up. God will be
[1:12:48] sanctified. God will be consecrated. God
[1:12:50] will be glorified by the lives that we
[1:12:52] live day by day. So the first thing we
[1:12:56] come in is we say, "God, you are God and
[1:12:59] I am not." And the second thing is let
[1:13:01] my life glorify and consecrate you
[1:13:06] above all else. Amen. The first priority
[1:13:10] is that his name is magnified in our
[1:13:13] lives. Okay.
[1:13:15] Remember then what does he say once
[1:13:18] that's done? He says, "Thy kingdom come,
[1:13:22] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[1:13:25] heaven." His kingdom his will. Where's
[1:13:27] our will, church? lost in his will.
[1:13:31] That's where our will is. Amen.
[1:13:32] Remember, there's two kingdoms on earth.
[1:13:34] There's the kingdoms of this earth and
[1:13:35] then there's the heavenly kingdom. The
[1:13:37] earthly kingdom for now is controlled by
[1:13:39] Satan. Remember, he went to Jesus. He
[1:13:41] says, "I'll give you all the kingdoms of
[1:13:42] this earth. They belong to me. If you
[1:13:44] bow down and worship me, I'll give them
[1:13:45] to you. You don't have to die for them.
[1:13:47] You don't have to redeem them. I'll just
[1:13:48] give them to you." So everything related
[1:13:50] to politics and economies and society is
[1:13:52] tied to Satan. So what we have here on
[1:13:54] earth today as a civilization in no way
[1:13:58] reflects the kingdom of heaven. It's the
[1:14:00] exact opposite. Nothing here on earth
[1:14:02] reflects that. Amen. But remember what
[1:14:04] Jesus said. He said what the kingdom of
[1:14:06] God is where? Within you. Okay? And he
[1:14:10] was pointing to what? The reality of a
[1:14:12] God that's working within us that's
[1:14:15] living within us to produce his purpose,
[1:14:18] his way, his time. And our prayerful
[1:14:21] request to God therefore is God have
[1:14:24] your way in this earth. Remember we did
[1:14:27] a ser a series a long time ago on thy
[1:14:30] kingdom come. Go back and listen to it.
[1:14:32] I I dwelt on this a whole lot more if
[1:14:34] you're bored this weekend or want
[1:14:35] something to listen to. Amen. But what
[1:14:37] is it doing? Our prayerful request is
[1:14:40] God have your way in this life as
[1:14:42] opposed to have our way in this life.
[1:14:46] He's got a kingdom and with that kingdom
[1:14:47] comes a will and that is supposed to be
[1:14:49] happening in our life. Brother Abraham
[1:14:51] says this. He says God's kingdom is not
[1:14:53] of this earth. God's kingdom is in our
[1:14:55] hearts. It's the spiritual kingdom that
[1:14:57] we're born into. Jesus said the kingdom
[1:14:59] of God comes but not without violence.
[1:15:01] And the kingdom of God is within you.
[1:15:03] The Holy Spirit, God's kingdom moving in
[1:15:06] the man governing and controlling him.
[1:15:09] That's the kingdom. So what is it that
[1:15:12] defines the kingdom of heaven coming?
[1:15:14] Thy will be done.
[1:15:16] That's how you know the kingdom of
[1:15:17] heaven has come into you is that it's
[1:15:19] his will being done in your life. So,
[1:15:21] it's a separating out of our will and a
[1:15:24] unifying in of his will. That's what his
[1:15:27] kingdom coming does. Amen. And we'll see
[1:15:29] through as we go through these things,
[1:15:31] our fleshly desires do not line up with
[1:15:33] thy kingdom come, thy will be done. Our
[1:15:36] flesh has to be crucified for his
[1:15:38] kingdom to come and our and his will to
[1:15:40] be done. But as it comes to prayer, a
[1:15:43] first request of God when it comes to
[1:15:46] asking him for something is Lord, let
[1:15:48] your kingdom live in me and let your
[1:15:51] will flow through me. That's what we ask
[1:15:53] for in prayer. You say, "I want
[1:15:55] something from God. Ask for his will."
[1:15:57] That's what Jesus told us to do. And
[1:15:59] what does that look like? Jesus showed
[1:16:01] it usself in the in the garden. The man,
[1:16:04] the humanity, the flesh body said, "If
[1:16:06] it be possible, let this cup pass from
[1:16:09] me. Nevertheless, not my will but thine
[1:16:12] be done. And he laid his life down
[1:16:14] willingly because that was the will of
[1:16:16] the father. And it's no less for us.
[1:16:18] Amen. He sought the father's will, not
[1:16:20] his own. And that's a standard for us.
[1:16:23] But watch what the father's will is. And
[1:16:24] I love this when I was studying it. It
[1:16:26] was completely new to me. We spoke
[1:16:28] earlier about seek ye first the kingdom
[1:16:30] of God. And watch how Jesus closes this
[1:16:32] expression because church, God never
[1:16:34] takes something away without giving you
[1:16:36] something greater than what he took. And
[1:16:39] he's not taking it. He's asking you to
[1:16:41] give it. You give it up. Remember he
[1:16:43] talked to the disciples. He says,
[1:16:44] "Except you, you know, leave your mother
[1:16:46] and your father and this and that." And
[1:16:47] they said, "Hey, we've done all those
[1:16:48] things. What are we going to get?" He
[1:16:49] says, "You'll get it here and you'll get
[1:16:50] it in the kingdom to come. More than
[1:16:52] what you gave with eternal benefits and
[1:16:55] consequences. Seek ye first the kingdom
[1:16:57] of God." Then we say, "Lord, let thy
[1:17:00] kingdom come. Let thy will be done."
[1:17:01] Watch what Jesus says about this. It's
[1:17:03] so beautiful. He says, "And seek not ye
[1:17:05] what ye shall eat or what you shall
[1:17:07] drink. Neither be ye of doubtful mind.
[1:17:10] For all these things do the nations of
[1:17:12] the world seek after, and your father
[1:17:14] knoweth that you have need of these
[1:17:15] things. God knows we have natural needs,
[1:17:17] and God has promised to provide for
[1:17:19] them. But rather, so in contrast to what
[1:17:22] everyone else is doing, he's saying,
[1:17:23] "Seek ye the kingdom of God, and all
[1:17:25] these things shall be added unto you.
[1:17:27] Fear not, little flock, for it is your
[1:17:30] father's good pleasure to give you the
[1:17:33] kingdom." So our prayer life is supposed
[1:17:35] to be drawing us into the kingdom of
[1:17:37] heaven life. Amen. Not getting us cozy
[1:17:39] in the kingdoms of this earth. Okay?
[1:17:42] That's the simple truth. But what is it
[1:17:44] God's good pleasure to give us? Good
[1:17:47] jobs, lots of money, big career, lots of
[1:17:50] influence. No. God's good pleasure is to
[1:17:52] give us the kingdom. What? The kingdom
[1:17:55] of heaven. Amen. And he says here it is
[1:17:58] God's good pleasure. The original phrase
[1:18:00] there is he is well pleased. So we could
[1:18:03] say here for he is well pleased to give
[1:18:06] you the kingdom. And it's the exact same
[1:18:08] phrase he said when Jesus came out of
[1:18:11] the water and he said this is my beloved
[1:18:14] son in whom I am well pleased.
[1:18:18] He's saying the same thing about you as
[1:18:20] he said about Jesus Christ. In other
[1:18:22] words, when he says it's your father's
[1:18:24] good pleasure to give you the kingdom,
[1:18:26] what he's saying is it is your father's
[1:18:28] good pleasure to dwell in you.
[1:18:32] So, what are we are supposed to be
[1:18:34] praying? Amen. That's the great thing
[1:18:35] that God has for you tonight. And that's
[1:18:37] what ought to be at the top of our
[1:18:39] prayer list is, Lord, make me your child
[1:18:41] more than I've ever been. Lord, fill me
[1:18:44] with your spirit more than I've ever had
[1:18:46] it. Lord, fill me with your spirit cuz
[1:18:48] I've never had it. Lord, let my life
[1:18:51] reflect the kingdom life inside of me.
[1:18:53] Amen. Refresh my mind. Refresh my
[1:18:56] attitude. Refresh my reproach. refresh
[1:18:58] my tongue so that your kingdom life can
[1:19:01] express itself through my life.
[1:19:03] Listen to this. And this is Jesus trying
[1:19:05] to show God's regard towards us and what
[1:19:07] his attitude is towards us when we're
[1:19:09] asking him for something. And he says,
[1:19:11] "And he said unto them, which of you
[1:19:13] shall have a friend and shall go unto
[1:19:14] him at midnight and say unto him,
[1:19:16] friend, lend me three loaves?" Now, I'm
[1:19:18] trying to think who's the the late night
[1:19:19] person amongst us. And I think it's got
[1:19:21] to be Brother Vichel. He's nodding his
[1:19:23] head. So, let's put this into names.
[1:19:26] Brother Vichel comes. Now, I'm the one
[1:19:28] that goes to bed moderately because my
[1:19:30] wife gets up early, so I've got to go to
[1:19:31] bed decently as well. So, it's now
[1:19:34] midnight. We've been in bed for 2 hours
[1:19:37] and a knock comes at our door and
[1:19:40] Brother Vichelo is there and he says,
[1:19:42] "Brother John, I've got friends over. I
[1:19:44] need three bags of chips."
[1:19:48] That's what he's talking about here.
[1:19:49] Okay.
[1:19:53] Lend me three loaves.
[1:19:55] For a friend of mine in his journey has
[1:19:57] come to me and I have nothing to set
[1:19:58] before him. That's believable. Bachelors
[1:20:01] rarely have food. He says, "For he from
[1:20:04] within shall answer and say, so from my
[1:20:06] inside the house, I'm not even going to
[1:20:07] open the door to brother Vichel. Trouble
[1:20:10] me not. The door is now shut and my
[1:20:12] children are with me in bed." They're
[1:20:14] not in his bed. He means they're all in
[1:20:16] bed, their own beds. I cannot rise up
[1:20:19] and give thee. You're going to have to
[1:20:20] go find chips from somebody else,
[1:20:21] brother Vichel.
[1:20:23] But he says, "I say unto you, though he
[1:20:26] will not rise and give him because he is
[1:20:28] his friend." In other words, Vashel, my
[1:20:30] friendship with Vichel will not get me
[1:20:32] out of bed.
[1:20:34] Okay, I love you, brother V. This is not
[1:20:36] enough to do it. He says, "Yet because
[1:20:39] of his importunity, he will rise up and
[1:20:43] give him as many as he needs."
[1:20:46] So he says, listen, friendship won't get
[1:20:48] you out of bed. What it will be will
[1:20:50] that brash tactless action will so scald
[1:20:55] you it'll get you out of bed just so you
[1:20:58] can get rid of this guy. You have no
[1:20:59] words for him. You have nothing you
[1:21:01] could say that would reveal to him how
[1:21:03] much you hate having to get out of bed
[1:21:04] and give him his chips. But you'll give
[1:21:06] him his chips just so he'll go away.
[1:21:09] Okay. Do we have the picture tonight?
[1:21:12] Can you see my face with brother Vichel
[1:21:15] knocking on my door at midnight asking
[1:21:16] for chips?
[1:21:19] I would probably lose my salvation.
[1:21:23] Okay, are you with me?
[1:21:26] Okay, now watch what's happening here.
[1:21:29] Watch the carryover. Jesus is setting a
[1:21:31] foundation for us speaking to God and
[1:21:34] asking. Okay. And I say unto you, ask
[1:21:37] and it shall be given you. Seek and you
[1:21:39] shall find. Knock and it shall be open
[1:21:41] to you. And the church said, Amen.
[1:21:44] Praise the Lord. But you got to see what
[1:21:46] he's talking about.
[1:21:47] He says, "For everyone that askketh
[1:21:51] receiveth,
[1:21:53] and he that seeketh findeth, and to him
[1:21:56] that knockketh it shall be open."
[1:21:58] Church, that's such a beautiful
[1:21:59] scripture. But you got to see what he's
[1:22:01] talking about
[1:22:03] because we can turn that into jobs and
[1:22:05] houses and careers and money and this
[1:22:08] and that and the other thing. That ain't
[1:22:10] what he's talking about. Stay with me.
[1:22:13] If a son shall ask bread of any you that
[1:22:15] is a father, will he give him a stone?
[1:22:18] Jonathan comes to me says, "Dad, I'm
[1:22:19] hungry. Am I going to go down to the
[1:22:20] beach and get him a big pebble?" No. I'm
[1:22:23] going to give him what he needs to
[1:22:24] satisfy his hunger. Or if he asks for a
[1:22:27] fish, will he give for a fish? Give him
[1:22:29] a serpent. Ain't going to happen. Or if
[1:22:31] he shall ask for an egg, shall he offer
[1:22:33] him a scorpion? He's saying, "Listen,
[1:22:34] somebody has a need. What are you going
[1:22:36] to do? You're going to give them what
[1:22:38] will satisfy their need as long as it's
[1:22:39] within your power."
[1:22:41] So everything is leading up to verse 13.
[1:22:45] He says, "If ye then being evil, know
[1:22:48] how to give good gifts to your children,
[1:22:51] how much more shall your heavenly father
[1:22:53] give what?
[1:22:55] The Holy Spirit to them that asking
[1:22:58] him." What's he saying, church? If you
[1:23:00] ask for the Holy Ghost, you'll receive
[1:23:02] it. If you'll seek the Holy Ghost,
[1:23:04] you'll find it. If you'll knock on his
[1:23:05] door until he gives you the Holy Ghost,
[1:23:07] then the door will be opened and you'll
[1:23:09] receive it. Why? because it is the
[1:23:11] father's good pleasure to give you the
[1:23:13] kingdom. He's desiring to live in you.
[1:23:16] He's desiring to express himself through
[1:23:18] you. So when your hearts cry, when your
[1:23:21] souls cry, when your prayer is, Lord,
[1:23:23] give me your spirit, that's what you're
[1:23:25] going to get.
[1:23:28] That's what he's trying to give us.
[1:23:29] Amen. It's his father's good pleasure.
[1:23:32] He's well pleased to dwell in you. He's
[1:23:34] well pleased to be invited into your
[1:23:36] life. And when you go seeking for a
[1:23:37] church, it's because he wants to be in
[1:23:39] there.
[1:23:40] It's because he's placed the cry in your
[1:23:41] heart for him to dwell in there. He
[1:23:43] said, "Our kingdom is of above. See,
[1:23:45] we're free, born again.
[1:23:49] See, act like up there, you're delegates
[1:23:52] from there." He's saying, "We're from a
[1:23:53] heavenly kingdom. Start acting like it."
[1:23:56] When you're an ambassador from Canada,
[1:23:58] you got to act in a way that reflects
[1:24:00] where you come from.
[1:24:03] He said, "I said we're citizens here
[1:24:04] living here in the flesh, but our
[1:24:06] spirits, we're pilgrims and strangers.
[1:24:08] We're foreign to the world now, even our
[1:24:10] own nation. For we have accepted the
[1:24:12] invitation when it knocked at our heart
[1:24:14] to become part of him and his word. He
[1:24:16] says, "And the word fixes us, makes us
[1:24:18] live, and makes us act like Christians."
[1:24:21] What's God trying to do, church? Get us
[1:24:23] to the place where the kingdom of God is
[1:24:25] expressed through our lives by the power
[1:24:27] of the Holy Spirit. And that's the
[1:24:30] greatest thing we ought to be praying
[1:24:31] for. Not just to get it, but to keep it
[1:24:34] there. Not just the seal of your soul,
[1:24:37] but the spirit, the anointing of it.
[1:24:40] That'll keep you refreshed in his
[1:24:41] presence. That'll give you overcoming
[1:24:43] power. That'll keep your attitude right.
[1:24:45] That'll keep you coming back to him
[1:24:47] instead of the things that this world is
[1:24:48] trying to offer. That'll set such a love
[1:24:50] in your heart that you don't want
[1:24:51] anything to do with what Satan throws
[1:24:53] your way. Amen.
[1:24:57] How? by prayerfully seeking him, taking
[1:25:00] all things to him, dwelling on what he
[1:25:02] has for us rather than what we want for
[1:25:06] us. That is all temporal. Amen. Prayer
[1:25:09] is not about me and what I want or what
[1:25:11] you and you want. Prayer is a time for
[1:25:13] us to get on God's page to get what he
[1:25:16] has promised for this time in the
[1:25:18] season. That's what we're supposed to be
[1:25:20] doing. Amen. That means we've got to be
[1:25:22] humble.
[1:25:23] We've got to be quiet. We've got to wait
[1:25:26] on him. And when he gives us an answer,
[1:25:30] be satisfied with the answer and stay
[1:25:32] with it. Amen.
[1:25:35] Then and only then do we progress to our
[1:25:38] natural needs. Watch how he puts it.
[1:25:42] Give us this day our daily bread. In
[1:25:47] Luke it says, give us day by day our
[1:25:50] daily bread. So prayer is an expression
[1:25:54] then of faith.
[1:25:58] Because what you're saying to him, I
[1:26:00] have the natural needs. And so, Lord,
[1:26:03] give me today what I need today.
[1:26:07] It doesn't say, "Give us this day our
[1:26:08] tomorrow bread. Give us today what we
[1:26:11] have need of. Give us what we need right
[1:26:14] now." Amen. Why? That shows that we
[1:26:17] trust him. It shows that God does all
[1:26:19] things well. That he's an ontime God.
[1:26:21] Amen. And prayer like this shows us,
[1:26:24] Lord, we're trusting you.
[1:26:25] Lord, our lives are in your hands. We're
[1:26:27] not getting there by the sweat of our
[1:26:29] brow, but we're getting there by your
[1:26:30] provision when we put you first in our
[1:26:32] life.
[1:26:35] We pray like this. It's saying, "Lord, I
[1:26:38] know you're my provider.
[1:26:40] Lord, I know the blessings I get, the
[1:26:43] provision I get, the food, the clothes,
[1:26:46] the shelter, the vehicle, whatever it
[1:26:48] might be, it's in your hands, and I'm
[1:26:50] trusting you for And when we pray like
[1:26:52] this, we're saying, "Lord, it's you that
[1:26:55] makes it happen.
[1:26:57] You're the one that grants me that
[1:26:59] favor, church." Because our flesh craves
[1:27:01] certainty.
[1:27:02] Our flesh craves stability. And so, our
[1:27:05] flesh doesn't just want to look at
[1:27:06] today. It wants to look at tomorrow and
[1:27:08] next week and next month and next year.
[1:27:10] And believe me, I'm not saying that we
[1:27:12] shouldn't look ahead. We're supposed to
[1:27:14] consider the end to store up for the
[1:27:16] future in these things. We're supposed
[1:27:17] to save. We're not supposed to be in
[1:27:19] massive amounts of debt. We're not
[1:27:20] supposed to be in debt at all, frankly.
[1:27:23] But I'm not saying you can't look
[1:27:24] forward to tomorrow for retirement or or
[1:27:27] putting things away for for tough days
[1:27:29] or or loss of a job or sickness or these
[1:27:31] different things. I'm not talking about
[1:27:32] that. But the flesh loves to always have
[1:27:35] something that we can rely on.
[1:27:38] Money in the bank, food in the pantry.
[1:27:42] Amen. A cushion. A fallback plan. a
[1:27:46] fallback plan just in case. We love to
[1:27:50] have that. And Jesus said, "Focus on
[1:27:53] today and leave tomorrow to him."
[1:27:58] Remember in the wilderness, how did God
[1:28:00] feed them? When they went out of Egypt
[1:28:02] and they they went around the wilderness
[1:28:04] for all those years, for 40 years they
[1:28:06] did it.
[1:28:09] How did God feed them? Day by day. He
[1:28:12] fed them with mana. And he put down mana
[1:28:14] in the morning. They go out, they gather
[1:28:16] it, they'd eat it that day. The next
[1:28:17] morning they wake up, all the mana went,
[1:28:20] nothing left. Next morning they wake up,
[1:28:23] mana again. Give us this day our daily
[1:28:26] bread. Now, you had some people,
[1:28:28] remember, and they said, "Listen, I hate
[1:28:30] getting up early and getting my mana.
[1:28:33] So, I'm going to get twice as much today
[1:28:35] so I don't have to get up tomorrow so I
[1:28:37] can sleep in." And what happened the
[1:28:39] next day? It had worms all in it because
[1:28:42] it was only a daily bread. The exception
[1:28:44] was on Friday morning. When you woke up
[1:28:47] on Friday morning, you got to gather for
[1:28:49] two days because the next day was the
[1:28:52] Sabbath for them and they weren't
[1:28:53] supposed to do anything on that day. So
[1:28:55] God would supernaturally preserve it
[1:28:57] over two days. But it was daily bread.
[1:29:00] They couldn't gather man up for the for
[1:29:01] the lean years, for the lean weeks, for
[1:29:04] the lean days. It was day by day that
[1:29:06] they got it. Daily bread means daily
[1:29:08] faith. Daily bread means daily trust.
[1:29:12] Amen. And we don't sacrifice our
[1:29:15] spiritual bread for our natural bread.
[1:29:18] Then you catch that everything up to
[1:29:19] this point is spiritual. And then God
[1:29:21] gets to the natural.
[1:29:24] Where does God want us focused, church?
[1:29:26] Natural or spiritual.
[1:29:30] We can be all settled when we have our
[1:29:33] daily natural bread and we're completely
[1:29:36] starving for spiritual food.
[1:29:40] Why? Because that's where we're focused.
[1:29:42] When this flesh is satiated, we think
[1:29:44] we're blessed. And that couldn't be
[1:29:46] further from the truth. Amen. Sometimes
[1:29:48] God provides for us to fulfill our
[1:29:50] kingdom duties and we end up taking that
[1:29:53] and turning it into our earthly kingdom
[1:29:55] benefits.
[1:29:57] Amen. We can so focus so much on his
[1:29:59] provision for us rather than what that
[1:30:02] provision allows us to do. I I remember
[1:30:05] being out west
[1:30:07] and I saw brothers that were away from
[1:30:10] home. They're out in the oil field and
[1:30:12] they're doing these long shifts, you
[1:30:14] know, three weeks on and three weeks off
[1:30:15] or three weeks on and one week off and
[1:30:18] these different things and they would
[1:30:19] leave their kids at home. They leave
[1:30:20] their wife at home and she's struggling
[1:30:22] away there. And after a while, God gave
[1:30:25] them a job because they desired to be at
[1:30:27] home. God gave them a job at home and
[1:30:32] they came back and all of a sudden now
[1:30:33] they're making church and the family
[1:30:35] starts to flourish and things start to
[1:30:36] go real well. And then all of a sudden
[1:30:38] what happened is you start to see them
[1:30:39] working overtime and working weekends
[1:30:42] and missing church and you're scratching
[1:30:44] your head because you're saying,
[1:30:45] "Brother, you wanted to get back and now
[1:30:48] what are you doing?
[1:30:50] You're taking God's provision, which was
[1:30:52] to keep you in your kingdom place, and
[1:30:55] you're using it because you want a
[1:30:56] bigger house. You want to get a second
[1:30:59] car. You want to go on a nice vacation.
[1:31:01] You want to have a quad and a side by
[1:31:03] side like all the other hunters do. You
[1:31:05] want to have a new ve, you know,
[1:31:06] whatever it might be. And what happened
[1:31:08] is they took their kingdom provision and
[1:31:10] they turned it into an earthly an
[1:31:12] earthly seeking.
[1:31:16] What was it? They weren't seeking daily
[1:31:19] bread. They were seeking lifestyle
[1:31:20] instead of eternal life.
[1:31:23] Amen. They got caught up in themselves
[1:31:25] and they abused the provision of God
[1:31:29] because they turned it into something
[1:31:30] else and all of a sudden they're missing
[1:31:32] church. And guess what happens? The
[1:31:34] family just starts to spiral right back
[1:31:35] down again.
[1:31:37] I've seen it. It never works out.
[1:31:41] Brother would say it this way. He says,
[1:31:42] "It was Moses who was living peacefully,
[1:31:44] marrying the shake of Midian's daughter,
[1:31:46] Zapora. And while he was out there
[1:31:48] hurting the sheep, one day on the back
[1:31:49] side of the desert was a familiar old
[1:31:51] path he was walking down hurting the
[1:31:53] sheep at peace. He says, "Israel was in
[1:31:55] bondage under slavery, he was thinking
[1:31:57] on his ways. This is not my job as a
[1:31:59] sheep herder. God called me to be a
[1:32:01] preacher." He says, "How do I know that
[1:32:02] I'm not preaching to a man or woman
[1:32:04] that's called to the mission fields, and
[1:32:06] yet you're selling that birthright for a
[1:32:07] morsel of bread?" He says, "Come to
[1:32:10] yourself. Think on your ways. See what
[1:32:12] will it gain you? What will you prosper
[1:32:14] by if you gain the whole world and lose
[1:32:16] your soul? He says, "What have you done?
[1:32:18] Think on your ways." Now, I don't think
[1:32:20] I'm talking to a bunch of brothers here
[1:32:22] that are supposed to be preaching,
[1:32:25] but when we look around at our lives and
[1:32:27] we look at this church, mostly we're
[1:32:29] single income families.
[1:32:31] Amen.
[1:32:33] And that's it seems like so many times
[1:32:35] we're trying to make bricks without
[1:32:36] straw.
[1:32:38] You almost have to make two jobs to get
[1:32:40] the income needed to survive these days.
[1:32:42] And that's the pressure that Satan has
[1:32:44] ratcheted down on us all the time. And
[1:32:46] brothers, we feel it, don't we?
[1:32:49] Those of us that aren't retired, we feel
[1:32:51] it, don't we?
[1:32:53] Cuz we got to make the money. And then
[1:32:55] the pressure shifts to the sisters cuz
[1:32:57] they've got to preserve the money. They
[1:32:58] got to stay on budget.
[1:33:01] That ought to be a four-letter word,
[1:33:03] budget.
[1:33:05] Bug g.
[1:33:07] Because it we hate budgets. You got to
[1:33:10] stretch $1 to do the work of two. You
[1:33:13] almost got to be Superwoman or Sister
[1:33:15] Betty, right?
[1:33:18] You just got to shop so carefully.
[1:33:20] You've got to be so so careful with
[1:33:22] every penny, it seems, you know, and it
[1:33:25] can be such a stress.
[1:33:28] And we can think, I've got to do more.
[1:33:30] I've got to do more. What did Jesus say?
[1:33:33] Just say, Lord, give me my daily bread.
[1:33:36] Give me my daily bread. Brothers, let me
[1:33:39] ask you this question. Are we working so
[1:33:42] hard for our daily bread that we've
[1:33:45] forgotten about our God, our family, and
[1:33:48] our church?
[1:33:51] Have we given so much to our job that we
[1:33:55] come in and we're falling asleep, we're
[1:33:58] tired, we're cranky, or we're not even
[1:34:00] here.
[1:34:03] And we can be present here, but not
[1:34:05] present here. Amen. You can come so wore
[1:34:09] out from putting everything you've got
[1:34:11] into everything else that you might be
[1:34:13] giving time to God, but he's not really
[1:34:15] getting any quality time. Amen.
[1:34:18] Well, we say, "I'm working for my
[1:34:20] family."
[1:34:22] Are we working for our family? Are we
[1:34:24] working for our daily bread? When we got
[1:34:27] enough, why do we keep on working?
[1:34:29] If we have what's sufficient, then why
[1:34:31] do we keep pushing? Is it provision that
[1:34:33] we're seeking? Or is pride pushing us?
[1:34:36] Is security pushing us? Is image pushing
[1:34:39] us? Are the Joneses next door pushing
[1:34:41] us? What is it that drives us so often?
[1:34:44] Are we trying to make money or make it
[1:34:45] to heaven?
[1:34:48] As fathers, as men, we're called to
[1:34:50] provide and lead, not just provide. And
[1:34:55] for so many of us, what comes naturally
[1:34:57] is making the money and putting in the
[1:34:59] hours. What doesn't come so naturally is
[1:35:01] the leading the family, the leading the
[1:35:04] church, working with the local body.
[1:35:06] Amen. We're called to be present
[1:35:09] in our family's lives. We're called to
[1:35:12] be available. We're supposed to be a
[1:35:14] complete example
[1:35:16] of a balanced Christian. That's what
[1:35:19] we're supposed to be. Amen. And that's a
[1:35:21] that's a life where faith collides with
[1:35:24] reality and faith wins.
[1:35:27] because otherwise reality will just come
[1:35:29] and beat us around because Satan will
[1:35:31] make it seem like we have no choice.
[1:35:34] But we do. We always have a choice,
[1:35:38] brothers.
[1:35:39] Paul would say, "Listen, let your
[1:35:41] moderation be known unto all men. The
[1:35:44] Lord is at hand." In other words, keep
[1:35:47] your balance, especially because the
[1:35:50] days are getting short and everyone else
[1:35:52] is out of balance. In that time, that's
[1:35:54] when you need to be most in balance.
[1:35:56] Brothers, if we're workaholics,
[1:35:59] what are we going to get? Workaholic
[1:36:02] families. If we're exercise, we'll get
[1:36:04] exercise. If we're shopaholics,
[1:36:08] we'll get shopaholics.
[1:36:11] But if we're Christians, we'll get
[1:36:13] Christians by God's grace. Amen. We
[1:36:17] ought to be showing the balance of a
[1:36:18] faithful believer, not an over
[1:36:20] overachiever financially.
[1:36:24] We're not all called to be rich.
[1:36:25] Clearly,
[1:36:27] Jesus said, "It's almost impossible for
[1:36:30] a rich man to go into the heaven."
[1:36:32] Easier for a camel to go through the eye
[1:36:34] of a needle than a rich man. And yet,
[1:36:35] we'll seek riches. We'll seek after
[1:36:38] those things. You know, I look around
[1:36:40] and I believe this goes. I believe the
[1:36:42] scripture supports it. Most of our lives
[1:36:44] are pretty frugal and simple. I'm not
[1:36:46] looking around seeing a bunch of people
[1:36:47] living high on the hog here.
[1:36:51] Amen.
[1:36:55] But we've got to keep that in balance.
[1:36:59] We don't have to get ahead. We have to
[1:37:01] get to heaven.
[1:37:04] Amen. Look at what Paul did.
[1:37:08] Paul, remember he's talking to the
[1:37:10] Corinthians. He says, "Listen, I never
[1:37:11] took your money cuz people accused me of
[1:37:13] wanting your money and this and that the
[1:37:14] other." He said, "I've always taken care
[1:37:16] ofselves and there was other churches
[1:37:17] that wanted to support me and I did
[1:37:18] that, but I never took it from you. So
[1:37:20] nobody could claim that." And what did
[1:37:21] he do? Sometimes he had to lay down his
[1:37:23] his Bible and he had to pick up some
[1:37:25] thread and he had to do some tent
[1:37:26] making. Paul wasn't afraid to work,
[1:37:30] right? But there's a time to pick it up
[1:37:31] and there's a time to lay it down.
[1:37:33] There's a time to say, "We've got enough
[1:37:36] and we're going to just stop here and
[1:37:38] we're going to commit the rest of our
[1:37:39] time. We're going to commit our gifts.
[1:37:40] We're going to commit our resources into
[1:37:42] kingdom purpose rather than trying to
[1:37:44] get further ahead." Amen. But I want to
[1:37:46] say this. I believe we have frugal
[1:37:49] lives, but they ought not to be frugal
[1:37:50] spiritually. Because I'll tell you this,
[1:37:52] God is not trying to be frugal with us.
[1:37:55] Hallelujah. God's not trying to be
[1:37:57] frugal with us. God's wanting to pour
[1:37:58] out his blessings, but he's wanting to
[1:38:00] pour out what is best for us rather than
[1:38:03] all these temporal things that we tend
[1:38:05] to get focused on. Amen. So many times
[1:38:08] we're focused on the flesh and trying to
[1:38:09] satisfy the flesh, trying to trying to
[1:38:11] make things easy. And and that's a
[1:38:13] natural thing to do, church, but our
[1:38:15] faith gets used up on those things that
[1:38:17] God has already promised to take care
[1:38:19] of.
[1:38:20] And if we could just commit it to him
[1:38:22] prayerfully, we could move on to the
[1:38:24] kingdom purpose instead of getting
[1:38:26] caught up in this earthly purpose. Amen.
[1:38:29] Our faith needs to be focused on what he
[1:38:31] promised us
[1:38:33] for this day.
[1:38:35] That's to get a bride ready for a
[1:38:37] rapture. Our prayer ought to be, Lord, I
[1:38:41] hope I'm getting ready today. Lord, make
[1:38:43] me a little more ready. Lord, put the
[1:38:44] garment on a little tighter. Lord, let
[1:38:46] me reflect you a little more today.
[1:38:48] Amen. We've got lots of promises in the
[1:38:50] scripture for our health, for our
[1:38:52] emotions, for our finances, for all
[1:38:54] these different things, and I don't want
[1:38:55] to min diminish those. Amen. But
[1:38:57] remember, we're supposed to prosper even
[1:38:59] as our souls prosper. Amen. God's love
[1:39:03] is based on our spiritual growth, not
[1:39:05] blessing us naturally. Amen. If God's
[1:39:07] given us a promise, church, and we have
[1:39:09] need of it, we ought to pray about it.
[1:39:11] We ought to go in expectation and faith
[1:39:13] to God that he would give us that. Amen.
[1:39:15] And it's an expression of faith alone.
[1:39:18] Not just will, not just desire, but
[1:39:20] faith because he says, "I've given it to
[1:39:23] you." That's our promise. Healing is our
[1:39:26] promise. That's the children's bread. We
[1:39:28] don't ever have to stop saying, "Lord,
[1:39:30] I'm here for healing. Lord, I'm here for
[1:39:33] deliverance. I'm here for direction. I'm
[1:39:36] here for guidance. I'm here for the
[1:39:37] fruits of the spirit." Those are all
[1:39:39] promised to us. Amen. That's what he
[1:39:43] wants to pour out us. Amen. But when we
[1:39:45] go to him, we say, "Lord, here's your
[1:39:47] promise. Here's my faith. I'm putting it
[1:39:49] in your hands. Now, in your time, in
[1:39:51] your season, you give it to me." Because
[1:39:54] he's got to have character with all of
[1:39:55] it. It's not just blessings. The
[1:39:58] greatest blessing is a character we can
[1:39:59] take with us.
[1:40:03] So many times our prayer is to ask God
[1:40:06] to move.
[1:40:08] And it can't be that way when we tell
[1:40:10] him how to move. We can say, "Lord,
[1:40:12] please move." But we can't tell them do
[1:40:14] it now or do it this way or do it that
[1:40:16] way. We're just saying Lord by your word
[1:40:19] I'm trusting what you said by your word.
[1:40:21] You're going to move now. I give it into
[1:40:23] your hands. We've said it before. We're
[1:40:25] going to get into brother R talk about
[1:40:27] prayer is the greatest weapon. But I've
[1:40:28] read the quote before where he says the
[1:40:30] the the ability to commit a thing into
[1:40:32] the hand of God is one of the greatest
[1:40:34] weapons given to a Christian. Just lay
[1:40:36] it in his hands. Prayer is a time to lay
[1:40:39] it in his hands. Okay.
[1:40:42] But look at this. We're talking about
[1:40:44] God not being frugal with his blessings.
[1:40:46] He says, 'We think we'll exhaust his
[1:40:47] bountiful blessings. We think, will I
[1:40:49] ask God to give me my daily bread? I
[1:40:51] shouldn't ask him too many things. Oh
[1:40:53] my, he says, could you imagine a little
[1:40:54] fish about that long, way out in the
[1:40:56] middle of this ocean, saying, wait, I
[1:40:57] better drink of this water sparingly. I
[1:40:59] might run out someday. Could you imagine
[1:41:01] a little mouse about that big under the
[1:41:03] great garners of Egypt, saying, "I
[1:41:05] better allow myself to want a half a
[1:41:07] grain of wheat a day. I might run out
[1:41:09] before the next harvest."
[1:41:11] He says, "My just multiply that by a
[1:41:13] hundred billion and you try to exhaust
[1:41:15] God's goodness and mercy."
[1:41:18] He says he's trying to force his way
[1:41:20] into you everything he can.
[1:41:26] Ask abundantly that your joys may be
[1:41:29] full. He says he wants his people to be
[1:41:32] happy asking great things, believing for
[1:41:36] great things. Can we say amen to that?
[1:41:38] But what are great things is great
[1:41:41] things. I want a $100,000 a year job,
[1:41:43] $150,000 a year job. I want a half
[1:41:45] million home. I saw a really nice home
[1:41:47] for 1.2 million up in King William
[1:41:48] Estates today. Lord, I'd like to have
[1:41:51] that estate, please.
[1:41:54] Money in the bank,
[1:41:57] new Subaru in the driveway.
[1:42:00] Is that the great things he's talking
[1:42:02] about? No. It's the promises of God he's
[1:42:06] talking about. He says, "You are a city
[1:42:09] set on a hill." High ambitions,
[1:42:11] expectations. He says, "Well, mercy, if
[1:42:14] we see the blind receive its sight
[1:42:16] tonight, I want to see the dead raised
[1:42:19] tomorrow night." He says, "Yes, sir. And
[1:42:22] I just keep on believing for greater
[1:42:24] things." What a greater manifestation of
[1:42:28] God in our lives. A greater expression
[1:42:30] of the promises of God in our lives. Not
[1:42:33] the things that make this flesh
[1:42:34] comfortable. the things that make this
[1:42:36] flesh want to get out of here. That's
[1:42:38] what an experience of God will do. It'll
[1:42:40] set your eyes on things that are higher.
[1:42:43] It'll set your eyes on things that are
[1:42:44] not temporal, but things that are
[1:42:47] eternal. Amen.
[1:42:49] Church, can I ask us tonight, what are
[1:42:51] you asking for in your prayers?
[1:42:54] What requests are you making known to
[1:42:56] God? And let me say this, if it's
[1:42:58] something you can buy, you're wasting
[1:43:01] your time.
[1:43:06] If it's something you can buy, you're
[1:43:08] wasting your time because that's not a
[1:43:11] priority for God because what he has for
[1:43:13] you is without money and without price.
[1:43:16] You can't buy it, but it is worth more
[1:43:18] than anything else you could ever buy.
[1:43:20] Amen.
[1:43:22] We're wasting valuable time if what
[1:43:25] we're asking for is something we can
[1:43:26] buy. Let's raise our sights a little
[1:43:28] higher. Let's say, Lord, what does your
[1:43:31] word say is meant for me today? What
[1:43:35] does your word promise for the church of
[1:43:37] this age? Lord, what does your word say
[1:43:40] about the bride for this age? And start
[1:43:42] reading those scriptures that will take
[1:43:43] us into eternity rather than those that
[1:43:46] will tie us down by ease and comfort in
[1:43:48] this life.
[1:43:50] Amen. Let's pray for lost souls. Let's
[1:43:53] pray for Martha and Anna and David and
[1:43:57] Sharon and Jenna
[1:44:00] and Naomi
[1:44:02] and Michaela.
[1:44:05] Let's pray for our colleagues, our
[1:44:07] co-workers.
[1:44:10] Let's pray for people that can't seem to
[1:44:11] make up their mind where they're going.
[1:44:14] Let's pray for healing.
[1:44:16] Let's pray for revival. Let's pray for
[1:44:19] the Holy Ghost to move in our services.
[1:44:22] Pray that the Lord would anoint your
[1:44:23] pastor so that you could receive what
[1:44:25] he'd have to say. So that he'd say what
[1:44:28] you need. Amen.
[1:44:31] Pray for God to pour out the gifts on us
[1:44:34] that would edify the body.
[1:44:37] That we would be healthy. Amen. That
[1:44:39] would bring a miracle of God's word
[1:44:41] working in our midst on a daily basis.
[1:44:44] That we'd have a testimony that we can
[1:44:46] share. Amen. Leave the daily bread to
[1:44:48] him and focus on the spiritual blessings
[1:44:52] he wants for us. And through it all,
[1:44:54] let's remember this, church. We aren't
[1:44:55] perfect.
[1:44:57] Amen. We're going to fail him. We're
[1:45:00] going to fail each other. We're going to
[1:45:02] disappoint ourselves.
[1:45:04] Amen. We are not flawless in our
[1:45:06] actions. We're flawless through the
[1:45:09] blood. Amen. We're perfect through the
[1:45:11] blood. Amen. But there's a remedy.
[1:45:13] There's a provision made in our prayer
[1:45:15] life. And Jesus says it this way. And
[1:45:17] forgive us our debts.
[1:45:20] In Luke, it says sins. Forgive us our
[1:45:22] sins as we forgive our debtors. As we
[1:45:24] forgive those that sin against us. And
[1:45:26] the point isn't whether it's debt or
[1:45:28] whether it's sin. The point is what
[1:45:30] you're asking of him. You need to be
[1:45:32] giving to somebody else. The way that
[1:45:34] you approach him is the way that you
[1:45:36] need to let other people approach you.
[1:45:38] The attitude you're asking him to take
[1:45:39] with you is the attitude you're
[1:45:41] offering.
[1:45:43] your offering to the person that did
[1:45:45] exactly to you what you just did to him.
[1:45:48] Amen. It brings us into a position of
[1:45:51] equality
[1:45:53] that we're all sinners. We've all come
[1:45:55] short of the glory of God. Amen. And the
[1:45:58] focus here is not so much of what we've
[1:46:01] done, but it's what we owe because of
[1:46:03] what we did. And isn't that where we
[1:46:05] hold things against each other so much?
[1:46:08] It's not so much that I ignored brother
[1:46:10] Bob. is that he feels I need to give him
[1:46:12] an apology for ignoring him. I owe him
[1:46:14] an apology. I can't take back what I did
[1:46:17] or what I didn't do. But I owe him
[1:46:19] something because of what I did. Guess
[1:46:21] what? We owe Christ because of what
[1:46:23] we've done.
[1:46:25] By the law, we owe him our life.
[1:46:28] But by grace, we owe him our repentance
[1:46:31] and a request that we would not do it
[1:46:33] again. So if I've offended brother Bob,
[1:46:37] what I owe him is an apology.
[1:46:42] But I can't take back what I've done.
[1:46:44] It's already done. The hurt's already
[1:46:46] there. But if he's asking God to forgive
[1:46:48] him, he's got to forgive me as well.
[1:46:50] Even if I don't come and do it.
[1:46:54] And that takes the Holy Ghost. That's
[1:46:56] why we've got to pray, "Thy kingdom come
[1:46:58] before we get to this stage." Because
[1:46:59] it'll take the Holy Ghost to give us the
[1:47:01] same attitude he has towards us as we
[1:47:03] would have for other people if we're
[1:47:05] sitting in a right place with him. Amen.
[1:47:07] Jesus said, "Make sure you're asking,
[1:47:09] you're offering what you're asking."
[1:47:12] Because a bride's always in a position
[1:47:14] of grace and mercy. And you get into
[1:47:17] this place, church, and it'll take you
[1:47:18] out of criticism, judgment, damnation,
[1:47:22] people getting what they deserve. and
[1:47:25] it'll take you to a place, Brother Bram
[1:47:27] says, you'll pray for them and you'll
[1:47:28] put yourself in their shoes and you'll
[1:47:30] realize what's going on in their life.
[1:47:32] That's what I love about our prayer
[1:47:33] meetings. We get to walk in each other's
[1:47:34] shoes just for a little brief moment. We
[1:47:37] see the hardships. We see the struggles,
[1:47:39] but we also see the testimonies. And we
[1:47:42] see what God can do when we give things
[1:47:43] to him. Are we as gracious with each
[1:47:45] other as we want God to be with us?
[1:47:50] I say, "Lord, help me. [laughter]
[1:47:52] Lord, help me.
[1:47:56] when our rights rise up, when offenses
[1:47:59] come, and they will come, right?
[1:48:03] To say, "Lord, let me quash my right to
[1:48:07] an apology.
[1:48:09] Let my quash my right to push them away.
[1:48:14] Let me quash my right to harbor these
[1:48:16] feelings."
[1:48:17] and just say, "Lord, help me forgive
[1:48:20] them as quickly, completely, and easily
[1:48:24] as you forgive me." Amen. Can we pray
[1:48:26] that tonight? I say, "Lord, help us to
[1:48:29] be like that. Help me hold my tongue.
[1:48:32] Help me push down my rights for their
[1:48:35] sake."
[1:48:37] Their sake. Because that's what he's
[1:48:38] doing for us. It's for our sake, not for
[1:48:40] his. Amen.
[1:48:42] Then how does he finish?
[1:48:45] Lead us not in temptation, but deliver
[1:48:48] us from evil. For thine is the kingdom.
[1:48:51] This all belongs to him.
[1:48:54] Lead us not in temptation. Lord, don't
[1:48:57] let us fall.
[1:48:59] Lord, hold us up with thy strong right
[1:49:01] hand. Lord, anchor us to you, Lord. Tie
[1:49:05] us to you so that when temptation comes,
[1:49:08] we can stand. We can pass the test. We
[1:49:12] can stay on the right path. Amen. Lord,
[1:49:15] don't let us give in.
[1:49:17] Lord, keep us from a time of temptation.
[1:49:20] Our cry here is, Lord, don't let us be
[1:49:22] led away by our own desires.
[1:49:26] Keep us focused on what you would have
[1:49:27] for us
[1:49:29] and take us there and we know we'll make
[1:49:31] it through just fine. Amen. God bless
[1:49:33] you. Let's stand this evening.
[1:49:37] Amen.
[1:49:40] I'm not setting you up with a formula.
[1:49:42] I'm setting you up with an approach.
[1:49:45] I'm setting you up with a motive and an
[1:49:46] objective. Why am I praying to my God
[1:49:51] and Father tonight? Amen.
[1:49:56] Jesus wasn't trying to put us in a box.
[1:49:58] He was trying to get us out of our box.
[1:50:01] Trying to open up a door to where we
[1:50:03] could have fellowship. Amen. But it
[1:50:05] comes from realizing that in this
[1:50:06] equation,
[1:50:08] we are less than the one we're talking
[1:50:10] to.
[1:50:12] and he lifts us up and he elevates us
[1:50:15] and he sets us in heavenly places. Amen.
[1:50:18] But he's still God. And what he has for
[1:50:21] us is greater than anything we could
[1:50:23] ever come up with on our own. Any need,
[1:50:26] any desire, any plan, any insight,
[1:50:30] nothing compares to what he has. And so
[1:50:33] when it comes to prayer, he's trying to
[1:50:34] get us to see, hey, what I've got for
[1:50:36] you is better than what you think you
[1:50:38] need.
[1:50:40] So come to me and ask for my will.
[1:50:43] Ask for my spirit.
[1:50:45] Ask for my direction. And commit your
[1:50:48] daily ways to me and watch me prove
[1:50:51] myself and make me a witness.
[1:50:54] Amen. Can we do that?
[1:50:59] Don't pray for things you can buy. Pray
[1:51:02] for the things he freely offers his
[1:51:05] children because he's trying to get us
[1:51:07] into eternity with him. Amen. Back to
[1:51:10] full fellowship, full dominion, full
[1:51:12] authority, eternal life. Amen. God bless
[1:51:16] you. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly
[1:51:18] Father,
[1:51:20] Lord, such a simple message tonight,
[1:51:24] but Lord, I pray it struck our hearts,
[1:51:27] Lord, that when we approach you,
[1:51:31] Lord, we have our needs, we have our
[1:51:32] thoughts, we have our opinions, we have
[1:51:34] our desires,
[1:51:36] Lord, but in the end, the cry of our
[1:51:37] heart, Lord, ought to be to get closer
[1:51:40] to you, Lord, and to be found walking in
[1:51:42] your will, to be walking in your way,
[1:51:46] Lord, because we know the greatest
[1:51:47] blessing ing us to walk in the path that
[1:51:49] you've chosen for us. Lord, I pray you
[1:51:52] give us faith to do that. Lord, that we
[1:51:54] lay down control, that we lay down our
[1:51:57] plans, our desires, Lord, that we would
[1:52:00] surrender all those things and run them
[1:52:01] through your word. Lord, I'm prayerfully
[1:52:04] seek what you would have for our lives,
[1:52:06] each one. Heavenly Father, Lord, I pray
[1:52:08] for this church, Lord. I'm thankful for
[1:52:10] the people that you've gathered here.
[1:52:12] I'm thankful for the building you've
[1:52:13] given us, Lord. But we've got a hell to
[1:52:16] shine and we've got a heaven to gain.
[1:52:18] Lord, I pray you help us to resist every
[1:52:20] temptation that Satan would throw at us,
[1:52:23] Lord, by prayerfully considering our
[1:52:25] ways, Lord. That we would bring all
[1:52:27] things subject to your word, Lord. And
[1:52:30] having found your will, Lord, let us
[1:52:31] stay there, Lord, with joy and
[1:52:33] contentment, knowing that you do all
[1:52:35] things well, heavenly father. Bless your
[1:52:37] people, Lord. Bless them in their
[1:52:38] sincerity, Lord. I pray you make us more
[1:52:41] sincere day by day. Lord, that we would
[1:52:43] desire to be closer to you, Lord, with
[1:52:46] everything that we have. Lord, make this
[1:52:48] world, Lord, just so distasteful to us,
[1:52:52] Lord, that we've got nowhere to go but
[1:52:53] to you. We pray, bless your people now,
[1:52:56] we ask, heavenly father, in Jesus
[1:52:57] Christ's name. Amen.
[1:53:02] in the presence of Jehovah. 871.
[1:53:13] In and out of situations,

[1:53:28] And all day long I struggle [music]
[1:53:35] for the answer [music] to my needs.
[1:53:42] And then [singing] I come into [music]
[1:53:44] his presence
[1:53:49] and all my [music and singing] questions
[1:53:51] become clear.
[1:53:57] And for [music] that sacred
[1:54:01] moment,

[1:55:12] Through [music] his love, the Lord
[1:55:15] proided
[1:55:17] [music]
[1:55:20] a place for us to rest. [music]
[1:55:28] A place to find [music] the
[1:55:31] answer
[1:55:35] in the [music] hour [singing] of
[1:55:38] distress.
[1:55:42] Now there's [singing] never [music]
[1:55:44] any reason
[1:55:49] for you to give up in despair. [singing]
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:55:57] &gt;&gt; Just [singing] slip the way and ring
[1:56:01] his name [music]
[1:56:04] and he will surely meet you there
[1:56:08] [music]
[1:56:13] in the presence [music]
[1:56:21] [music] of the Lord. over

[1:57:34] for the answer [music] to my needs.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; But then I come into his presence
[1:57:48] and all [music] my [singing] questions
[1:57:51] become clear.
[1:57:57] And for that sacred [music] moment,

[2:08:39] Lord, we have so much to be thankful

[2:08:43] you, Lord, for the word that was spoken
[2:08:45] tonight. And Lord, you've touched so
[2:08:47] many hearts, Father, through Brother
[2:08:49] John's ministry, Lord, thus far. And I
[2:08:51] know, Lord, that you've you've touched
[2:08:53] me in many ways, Lord. And Father, I
[2:08:56] just pray that you continue, Lord, to
[2:08:58] help us, Father, to lay ourselves aside
[2:09:00] and that you have complete preeminence
[2:09:02] in every part of our lives, Lord.
[2:09:05] Father, does as the brother said, Lord,
[2:09:07] there's a heaven to gain here. There's a
[2:09:09] hell to shine. And we see Lord that the
[2:09:11] enemy is out there as a roaring lion
[2:09:13] seeking whom he may devour. But Lord,
[2:09:16] there's a greater one there that's in
[2:09:18] us, Father, than he that's in the world.
[2:09:20] And Lord, we just want to yield to you,
[2:09:22] Lord. Let you, Father, take control of
[2:09:24] our lives.
[2:09:26] Father, by grace, Lord, if we could just
[2:09:28] become more and more subject, Lord, to
[2:09:30] your leadership to be able to hear the
[2:09:32] still small voice, Lord, that speaks,
[2:09:34] Father, and guiding us and keeping us,
[2:09:37] Father, away from this world, Lord, and
[2:09:39] focused upon the things of your word,
[2:09:42] Lord, which lifts us up in faith and
[2:09:44] gets us ready for that change. Father, I
[2:09:46] pray, pour your spirit out upon us all.
[2:09:50] Father, lead us and guide us in paths of
[2:09:52] righteousness, Lord, that we might,
[2:09:53] Father, by grace reflect the very life
[2:09:55] of Christ in every part of our lives,
[2:09:57] Lord, each and every day, Father, given
[2:10:00] you the preeminence. So be with us
[2:10:02] tonight, Lord, as we go. May you touch
[2:10:05] those that weren't here, Father. And I
[2:10:07] pray, Lord, that you would just by grace
[2:10:10] find a way, Lord, to bring them, Father,
[2:10:12] back into your presence, Lord. Father,
[2:10:14] the time is so short, Lord. is there's
[2:10:17] there's Lord that rapture is just about
[2:10:19] to take place and we don't want to leave
[2:10:21] anybody behind. So Lord bless us we pray

[2:10:27] humbly lord that you would just touch
[2:10:29] each and every one father and just

[2:10:41] too hard for the lord to do lord help us
