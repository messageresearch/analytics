[43:15] [Music]
[43:15] [Applause]
[43:26] hey man praise the Lord I trust it's a
[43:30] Amen to us a man that we believe it that
[43:33] we song the truth a man we did sing a
[43:37] lie
[43:37] we song the truth a man it's a
[43:40] confession of our faith in the Lord
[43:42] Jesus Christ a man to God be the glory a
[43:47] man and invite us to be conscious of
[43:52] something that's going on right now and
[43:54] will take place in Israel a man the
[44:00] prophet of God preached the message in
[44:03] 1964 entitled the Feast of the trumpets
[44:07] a man and he said it's the seventh seal
[44:11] to the Gentile bride
[44:13] he said the seventh trumpet is to Israel
[44:17] what significance does a tell well there
[44:20] are some Christian Jews in Israel and
[44:23] they will be observing the Feast of
[44:27] Trumpets this this weekend a man on
[44:31] Sunday and the and they're going to is
[44:34] going to be like a prayer meeting but
[44:36] it's I understand it's going to be
[44:38] public a man and they're going to get
[44:40] together for the Feast of Trumpets and
[44:42] for the for praying for the seed of God
[44:47] around the world amen
[44:49] and it's they say the Messiah of Israel
[44:52] ministries will gather with others from
[44:57] all nations and we'll have a feast of
[45:00] trumpets for you in Jerusalem and it
[45:04] says beginning at 7 a.m. on to 4 p.m.
[45:08] Israel time a man on the 29th of
[45:11] September so brother we thank God for
[45:15] what he's done for us but it's the
[45:18] confirmation that God is moving and God
[45:20] is God is doing something in Israel and
[45:22] we know the problem of God warned us
[45:25] that God is going to move from the
[45:26] Gentiles back to the Jews a man and I
[45:30] believe we've come to that time and
[45:32] we've come to that prophecy brother
[45:34] sister we've seen it and we see it
[45:36] everywhere now
[45:38] man and and there's just less and less
[45:40] and less happening in among the Gentiles
[45:43] but there's there's there's a moving of
[45:46] the Spirit of God among the Jews a man
[45:49] that the Gentiles are having less and
[45:51] less experiences with God but the Jews
[45:54] are having more experiences with God
[45:55] because I've already told you about
[45:57] those that have gone beyond the curtain
[45:59] of time a man truth gone beyond the
[46:03] curtain of time and come back and
[46:04] they've told what they seen and not only
[46:07] that in just a little while ago maybe a
[46:10] couple years ago there they go to the I
[46:13] think it was the tomb of Elijah in
[46:16] Israel and there this particular time
[46:20] they had a rabbi there in a wheelchair
[46:23] and he was a very old man and they they
[46:27] wheeled him up pushed him up toward the
[46:29] tour to the tomb of Elijah a man and he
[46:33] reached out and he touched the tomb of
[46:34] Elijah and he prophesied a man he did
[46:38] there and he had never done it before
[46:39] but the anointing had struck him and has
[46:43] struck the others everybody was
[46:45] absolutely amazed and and in a sense of
[46:48] a fear of God a man because it was it
[46:51] was so sobering and any any smoke in the
[46:55] name of the Lord a man to warn the
[46:58] people concerning what God was going to
[47:00] do in Israel and I don't I don't I don't
[47:03] doubt but for a moment now that that may
[47:05] be the rabbi might be gone on himself a
[47:07] man to his reward a man but goddess
[47:11] goddess left left them without a not
[47:14] without a witness a man that he what
[47:17] he's doing in Israel a man so brother I
[47:21] tell you this if all what we have seen
[47:24] in the Gentile world is causing us to
[47:26] look up what he's doing in Israel ought
[47:29] to cause us to look up a man because I
[47:32] tell you if they're that close to
[47:34] receiving the anointing of the prophet
[47:37] Elijah and the prophet Moses and the
[47:40] witness of the prophet Elijah and the
[47:41] prophet Moses brother how close are we
[47:43] to the rapture of course are we to their
[47:46] to the Gentile resurrection of the Bride
[47:49] of Christ
[47:49] a man so it is more serious than
[47:52] we think and it and it is alternatives
[47:55] later than what we think a man it is
[47:57] much later so brother-sister let let's
[48:00] not let's not wait for this to happen
[48:01] that to happen it be too late but it
[48:04] definitely too late but let's believe
[48:07] it's what God has done let's believe
[48:09] that the prophecy is being fulfilled
[48:11] regarding what God has promised in these
[48:13] last days for the trilogy juice a man
[48:17] Revelation chapter 11 a man is is
[48:20] concerns llege in the juice revelation
[48:23] 10 in the OVA the seven seals as the
[48:25] gentiles but the sounding of the seven
[48:27] trumpets is the juice a man and it says
[48:30] that the Feast of Trumpets begins
[48:32] September the 29th at sundown Amen so
[48:37] brother the fact that they had they
[48:40] haven't highlighted this in in other
[48:41] years but just now this year their eye
[48:44] lighting it a man so I believe that it's
[48:47] it's it's significant and brother it's
[48:51] only the elect is going to recognize
[48:52] what God has done and the elect are
[48:55] gonna recognize what God is doing a man
[48:58] so brother let's be on our guard and
[49:00] let's be on our toes that were there
[49:03] brother were not going to miss the
[49:05] significance of the seals father praying
[49:07] grace that the Jews are not going to
[49:10] miss the significance of the Feast of
[49:12] Trumpets a man so the grace of God to us
[49:15] and the grace of God to Israel the grace
[49:19] of God to the 144,000 a man who God is
[49:23] going to call out during the Great
[49:25] Tribulation some brother if the Great
[49:27] Tribulation is that close how close is
[49:30] the resurrection how close is the
[49:32] rapture a man we better focus on that we
[49:35] better get out of here a man no wonder
[49:38] the prophet of God said that God is
[49:39] waiting on us a man there wondering
[49:42] maybe in Israel why this and why that
[49:44] and why something else but then there's
[49:46] a generation that does know God is
[49:48] waiting on the Gentile bright a man
[49:51] we're waiting on God we're not waiting
[49:53] on God to do this this is this because
[49:55] that'll be too late if we're we're here
[49:57] when he does that for the Jews but
[49:59] brother no doubt there might be somebody
[50:00] in Israel is waiting for God to finish
[50:02] with the Gentiles a man because this
[50:05] right area in the
[50:06] the word in the Old Testament where God
[50:08] promised to call out of the Gentiles a
[50:10] people for his name a man a bride for
[50:13] his name to provoke Israel to jealousy a
[50:16] man who I believe Israel is coming to
[50:18] that so brother listen there there
[50:21] there's confusion politically but God is
[50:23] straightening everything out spiritually
[50:25] a man and it's going to be according to
[50:28] his word according to the prophecy oh
[50:31] yeah we don't know what's going to
[50:33] happen politically because we know right
[50:35] now there there's a contention between
[50:37] the two the two that are that are that
[50:40] got a lot of votes but the one is one is
[50:44] opposing the other they're trying to get
[50:46] together they're trying to make an
[50:48] agreement that maybe they should we
[50:50] should form the government but there
[50:53] still haven't reached that agreement a
[50:55] man but we know that God is doing
[50:59] something spiritually praise the name of
[51:01] the Lord there's confusion politically
[51:04] but I tell you this God is sending
[51:07] everything in order spiritually he did
[51:10] it for us through the old me list of the
[51:12] of the fields he said it for us through
[51:16] the revealing of his word a man
[51:18] revelation 10 and he's doing it for the
[51:20] Gentiles the sounding of the seven
[51:23] trumpets a man so the grace of God to
[51:26] Israel a man from being prayer a man for
[51:31] the hundred and forty-four thousand the
[51:33] grace of God to the to the prophet
[51:36] Elijah and a blabbity Moses and the
[51:38] prophet of God said it could be those
[51:41] two prophets themselves coming back or
[51:45] he said it could be two men with their
[51:47] spirit now the proud of God did wanted
[51:51] well for a while he thought maybe that
[51:53] that God would use him to do that and he
[51:56] would go back go to the Jews but you
[51:58] know the the the story about the Prophet
[52:02] was landed in a certain place and he
[52:04] thought about changing his flight and
[52:06] going to Israel but the Lord called him
[52:08] aside and says no you stay out of Israel
[52:11] and he said because why because they're
[52:14] only going to relieve and receive and
[52:16] listen to a Jewish prophet a man
[52:19] and so the prophet of God wouldn't got
[52:21] back on his plate and went on to where
[52:22] he was going somewhere else
[52:24] a man so God had given him a revelation
[52:27] there so I pray God is giving us the
[52:29] revelation we need now a man and I know
[52:32] that there are Christians that go to
[52:33] Israel and and they think God is going
[52:36] to use them for this and use them for
[52:37] that and there are believed message
[52:39] believers and there are message
[52:42] preachers that that have ministered in
[52:45] Israel and I've seen them and they they
[52:48] have been at a church they started a
[52:50] church in Israel brothers sister that's
[52:52] contrary to the Word of God that is not
[52:55] God a man because they're only going to
[52:58] believe they're Jewish prophets a man he
[53:01] wouldn't let the Prophet go there so
[53:02] he's not going to let us go and minister
[53:05] to the Jews you're gonna live your life
[53:07] but when I when it comes through in in
[53:10] Israel but we're not ordained to go in
[53:12] and witness to the Jews because
[53:13] certainly Jesus witness witness witness
[53:15] no brother they got they got two
[53:18] prophets ordained to come and give them
[53:20] the revelation of the Messiah that they
[53:22] need a man so I pray God that we've
[53:25] received the revelation of the Messiah
[53:27] that we need a man and it is the water
[53:30] it is our is invisible union of the
[53:32] Gentile bride with with the heavenly
[53:36] bridegroom our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[53:39] God Elvis to believe it God Elvis in to
[53:42] see it you know what God is doing a man
[53:46] not what God has done what's God doing
[53:48] in your life hey man what's God doing in
[53:52] our life what's God doing in this church
[53:54] a man it is the you know it is the
[53:56] invisible union of the heavenly
[53:58] bridegroom and the earthly bride the
[54:01] Gentile bride by the grace of God amen
[54:03] were entered into a witness with our
[54:06] Lord Jesus Christ and that wellness is
[54:08] bringing the rid of the rug the
[54:09] revelation and the faith of the
[54:12] Resurrection and the faith of the
[54:14] rapture do we want to get out of here a
[54:17] man by the grace of God it's time to go
[54:20] amen but by the grace of God a man we're
[54:25] going to claim the promise amen so the
[54:29] God God's grace to us
[54:32] a man just and just so he going to the
[54:37] word before we going to the word to
[54:40] thank you for your prayers while myself
[54:42] and sister Betty was traveling to the
[54:44] barren Peninsula and again you know it
[54:48] sure certainly proves that uh as I have
[54:53] explained to a gentleman one time
[54:55] concerning it and I said a pastor I said
[54:58] it's not eight to four nine to five not
[55:02] by any means I said it's 24/7 I said
[55:05] because no matter what the hour what the
[55:07] time I said he's there I said ready to
[55:10] to answer ready to do this ready to do
[55:13] that a man and so he can be called on
[55:15] any time and and you I felt that as it
[55:21] were when we were fellowship me with
[55:23] different ones in our trip and the pool
[55:26] was their spiritual a man and the pastor
[55:30] was of course ready to give his his
[55:33] testimony and his witness even to aunt
[55:36] Betty's birthday she was celebrating
[55:40] their 95th birthday and I must say she
[55:43] was doing very good and she was very
[55:45] pleased that we were there and surprised
[55:48] that we were there she wasn't expecting
[55:50] us but I did witness to some of the
[55:53] other seniors concerning going from time
[55:56] to eternity because to them maybe this
[56:00] one their mate was gone
[56:02] that one the mate was gone somebody else
[56:04] was gone and to them it was up there in
[56:06] the graveyard no I said they're not in
[56:08] the graveyard
[56:09] I should they go from time to Eternity
[56:12] if they were there believe that faith
[56:14] and I and I would explain it to him and
[56:17] so on and so it was something that they
[56:19] never heard before and I remember that
[56:22] when I when I was ministering up to the
[56:24] Salvation Army Glenbrook Lodge to senior
[56:27] citizens and I was explaining certain
[56:29] things and after I finished I remember I
[56:32] went I was going through the home and
[56:34] this senior the elderly woman she was in
[56:39] her 90s I would say she's going on to
[56:41] her reward and she came over and she
[56:44] said excuse me
[56:45] she said I've got to thank you she said
[56:48] for what you said and what you explained
[56:50] she said I never heard that before
[56:54] but she said I believe it's the truth
[56:56] she says that's exactly she said
[56:59] according to the word a man so appraised
[57:02] the Lord it got a gave her the
[57:04] revelation she needed to go from time to
[57:06] eternity
[57:07] praise the Lord a man and as so others
[57:11] of course that I ministered to in
[57:13] viewers they they caught the revelation
[57:16] I think they believed it a man and God
[57:18] God blessed them and also to continue to
[57:21] pray for Aunt Betty and she's doing very
[57:23] good but her daughter Jessie was there
[57:27] but she didn't look too good and her
[57:32] daughter was with her Kimberly and
[57:35] Kimberly sort of kept her arms around
[57:37] her to keep her up and to keep her
[57:40] walking she had she had to have help so
[57:44] we pray the grace of God to Jesse and
[57:46] she said well she said yes she said I
[57:49] would like that you keep praying for it
[57:51] for me she said and I said we will and I
[57:54] said the church is praying for you to
[57:55] all she said thank you thank you so
[57:58] God's grace to Jesse at this time a man
[58:01] and when we visited her before we left
[58:04] in her home that she was lying down and
[58:08] she was still feeling the weakness and
[58:10] as I said before she's lost a hundred
[58:14] pounds and maybe looking at her you
[58:18] wouldn't think that but she was a very
[58:20] heavyset person and she did lose a
[58:23] hundred pounds so God's grace to her a
[58:26] man to make her call him and her
[58:29] election shore by grace amen
[58:33] and also to remember in prayer sister
[58:35] Betty's brother heard and his wife Jean
[58:38] and they have changed quite submit some
[58:42] since the last time that we had seen
[58:45] them about a year ago and it's totally
[58:48] two different people
[58:50] oh yeah they look totally different so
[58:54] the grace of God to her and the grace of
[58:57] God to Jean and
[58:58] even in our fellowship with them there
[59:00] was there were times when the spiritual
[59:03] came and I and I would say something
[59:07] just about the Lord and about the Word
[59:10] of God and also when we went again to
[59:14] our sister Betty's other brother Roy and
[59:17] his wife Phyllis and our conversation I
[59:21] must say was more spiritual with them
[59:23] than we have had at any time before yeah
[59:27] and so we pray the grace of God to bless
[59:30] them a man and I believe that they're
[59:33] they're focusing more and more on the
[59:35] Lord they're focusing more and more on
[59:37] the spiritual by the grace of God amen
[59:40] so I pray the anointing of the Holy
[59:42] Ghost be with them and give them his
[59:44] leadership
[59:46] amen and also to ask you to remember and
[59:51] keep in prayer sister Eileen's husband
[59:56] Heber and I did explained to brother
[1:00:00] Mark that we did we did visit the
[1:00:02] cemetery in Buren our cemetery there and

[1:00:22] I didn't know that and he had painted
[1:00:25] the fence and he must have been keeping
[1:00:27] keeping the the ground mold and because
[1:00:31] the grass needed to be mowed again but
[1:00:34] it had been mowed down through the
[1:00:37] summer for sure amen because it wasn't
[1:00:40] wasn't all that high and so on so we
[1:00:42] thank the Lord for Ebers work we thank
[1:00:47] the Lord for the bird not only that we
[1:00:49] met his daughter we didn't meet Heber
[1:00:52] but we met his daughter and she told us
[1:00:53] that there are times when when her
[1:00:56] father goes to the cemetery and there's
[1:00:59] a bench he got a bench there and he'll
[1:01:01] sit on the bench for two or three hours

[1:13:33] not ashamed of the gospel of Christ a
[1:13:36] man I trusted it's the truth for all for
[1:13:41] all of us not ashamed of the gospel not
[1:13:45] what's out there in a denomination but
[1:13:48] with the gospel that God has revealed to
[1:13:50] us through the Ministry of a prophet I
[1:13:53] am not ashamed of that gospel not
[1:13:57] ashamed of that revelation of Jesus
[1:13:59] Christ for it is the power of God unto
[1:14:04] salvation to everyone that believeth to
[1:14:09] the Jew first and also to the Greek a
[1:14:13] man it is the power of God unto the
[1:14:18] resurrection and the rapture 4 verse 17
[1:14:22] for therein is the righteousness of God
[1:14:25] revealed from faith to faith as it is
[1:14:30] written the just shall live by faith and
[1:14:34] we're going from faith to faith to faith
[1:14:37] God is leading his sons and daughters
[1:14:39] from faith to faith to faith this
[1:14:42] revelation that revelation that
[1:14:44] revelation till we come to the full and
[1:14:46] complete revelation of God a man in our
[1:14:51] Lord Jesus Christ the just shall live by
[1:14:54] that faith for the wrath of God is
[1:14:58] revealed from heaven against all
[1:15:01] ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[1:15:06] who hold the truth in unrighteousness
[1:15:11] amen
[1:15:14] that's not all it in unrighteousness but
[1:15:18] in the righteousness of God the
[1:15:20] revelation of the righteousness of our
[1:15:21] Lord Jesus Christ a man that has been
[1:15:24] imputed to us by grace because that
[1:15:30] which may be known of God is manifest in
[1:15:33] them for God
[1:15:36] noted unto them for the invisible things
[1:15:41] of him from the creation of the world
[1:15:44] are clearly seen a man we're seeing what
[1:15:49] the religious world doesn't see we're
[1:15:52] understanding where they don't
[1:15:53] understand we're hearing what they're
[1:15:54] not hearing amen
[1:15:56] it is the grace of God and it is the
[1:15:59] faith that pleases God for the invisible
[1:16:02] things of him from the creation of the
[1:16:05] world are clearly seen being understood
[1:16:09] by the things that are made even his
[1:16:14] eternal power and Godhead hallelujah
[1:16:18] amen even as eternal power and Godhead
[1:16:22] so that they are without excuse because
[1:16:25] that when they knew God they glorified
[1:16:29] him not as God a man neither were
[1:16:35] thankful but became vain in their
[1:16:38] imaginations and their foolish heart was
[1:16:42] darkened professing themselves to be
[1:16:46] wise they became fools god help us
[1:16:54] that we're going to be spiritual not
[1:16:57] just religious having this revelation
[1:16:59] that revelation this understanding that
[1:17:02] understanding a man brother and they
[1:17:04] become fools in the eyes of God amen and
[1:17:07] it says that which may be known of God
[1:17:09] is manifest in them for God has showed
[1:17:12] it unto them for the invisible things of
[1:17:15] him from the creation of the world are
[1:17:17] clearly seen being understood by the
[1:17:19] things that are made even his eternal
[1:17:21] power and Godhead so that they are
[1:17:23] without excuse a man for doing what they
[1:17:27] do and believe in what they believe in
[1:17:28] the way that they believer there without
[1:17:30] excuse a man because of the extent of
[1:17:33] the revelation that God has given them
[1:17:35] but they're doing what's right in their
[1:17:37] own eyes not the eyes of God by the eyes
[1:17:40] of man a man in verse again
[1:17:44] 21 because that when they knew God they
[1:17:47] glorified him not as God they knew God
[1:17:50] Amen but they didn't glorify Him as God
[1:17:53] and today they know God but they don't
[1:17:56] glorify Him as God because it is in a
[1:17:59] church and in its this revelation that
[1:18:02] revelation this idea that idea this
[1:18:04] Creed or that dark that doctrine but
[1:18:07] it's a revelation of God they glorified
[1:18:11] him not as God my brother's sister is a
[1:18:14] challenge to our faith you know God that
[1:18:16] are you are you glorifying him as God
[1:18:18] are you gonna worship as God amen
[1:18:21] and it says neither we're thankful I
[1:18:26] meant a lot of believers that are not
[1:18:28] glorifying God is gone now worshiping
[1:18:30] God is gone and they are not thankful oh
[1:18:34] yeah well the Lord did is the Lord did
[1:18:37] that but lets ever ever grateful and a
[1:18:39] thankful heart a man that's ever
[1:18:42] grateful and thankful spirit for what
[1:18:44] God has done and what God is doing that
[1:18:47] by the grace of God we are here tonight
[1:18:49] there by the grace of God we are still
[1:18:51] looking and believing for the
[1:18:52] resurrection and the rapture amen
[1:18:55] that is the grace of God a man is not
[1:18:58] we're not over there like religion and
[1:18:59] and going into a church every every a
[1:19:01] you know every service and oh yeah I'll
[1:19:03] praise the Lord Amen you know thank you
[1:19:05] preach it again preach it again yeah but
[1:19:08] are you going over there and live in it
[1:19:09] are you going out there and and looking
[1:19:12] for it a man with the spirit of it what
[1:19:14] expecting the Resurrection expecting the
[1:19:16] rapture amen
[1:19:17] hey man but as they again they're in the
[1:19:21] early early church they were looking for
[1:19:23] the resurrection looking with a raptor
[1:19:25] even in that day even at that hour a man
[1:19:28] and the Bible tells us said that every
[1:19:30] day they got together a fellowship
[1:19:32] around the Word of God not foolishness
[1:19:34] the Word of God amen
[1:19:36] and there was their generation after
[1:19:38] generation of their generation brother
[1:19:40] than when God had a revival they did
[1:19:42] this we got in a rib eye where the
[1:19:43] people got together and fellowship not
[1:19:45] just in a church a man sometimes do it
[1:19:48] just in someone's house or go here go
[1:19:50] there and and so on but but the thing
[1:19:53] the important thing was that the Holy
[1:19:56] Ghost was in control God was in control
[1:19:58] amen and no matter where you met them
[1:20:01] how you made them
[1:20:02] no matter what it was that everything
[1:20:04] was spiritual their thoughts are
[1:20:06] spiritual their conversation was
[1:20:07] spiritual they were praising the Lord
[1:20:09] they will thankful to the Lord amen
[1:20:11] they loved the Lord amen amen and the
[1:20:14] anointing of God was there to bless them
[1:20:16] praise the name of the Lord brother and
[1:20:19] I and this is this is the anoint us on
[1:20:21] the bride in these last days and the
[1:20:24] father God mentioned these Saints and
[1:20:25] what it was like there with me and he
[1:20:28] was like but he said now he said I know
[1:20:30] he said it's not like it used to be but
[1:20:32] he sure there there are those here that
[1:20:34] know that and he said those here that
[1:20:36] don't know it it's because you haven't
[1:20:38] experienced it Amen that's right
[1:20:41] it's a J that you don't know but by
[1:20:43] their generation
[1:20:44] then and what it was like and the
[1:20:46] anointing that was there the power of
[1:20:48] God that was there and the pressures
[1:20:50] that was there amen
[1:20:51] but he said there are those here that do
[1:20:53] know it but he said you don't know it
[1:20:55] Amen the problem of God knew it and he
[1:20:57] said those that there that do know what
[1:20:59] he said we won't know and you will know
[1:21:01] but not not not experience it amen and I
[1:21:05] said oh lord thank you I said that's
[1:21:07] what I told the church just recently I
[1:21:09] saw that what the atmosphere was like
[1:21:10] but in that the atmosphere is not like
[1:21:12] that now you don't see you don't feel
[1:21:13] that anointing one time you did he
[1:21:16] invited us and it was there 50 years ago
[1:21:19] it was there 40 years ago when we first
[1:21:21] came to this word in this master a man
[1:21:23] and the anointing was with us as we
[1:21:25] gathered together but the anointing was
[1:21:27] also out there a man God was moving by
[1:21:30] his spirit out there but now because why
[1:21:33] they got more and more to religion or
[1:21:35] gone out of it why now the Spirit of God
[1:21:38] is only in the bright anybody and the
[1:21:40] only ones got any experience is the few
[1:21:43] that are the Bride of Christ that are
[1:21:46] going in a rat rapture by the grace of
[1:21:48] God amen this is why that we the world
[1:21:52] feels so dead because it is spiritually
[1:21:55] dead amen
[1:21:57] but by the grace of God the life is in
[1:22:01] the bright Amen brother they were dead
[1:22:03] in the days of Jesus and just think all
[1:22:05] that saw his miracles all they saw his
[1:22:08] signs and wonders and some maybe that
[1:22:10] even experience it amen and here they
[1:22:12] were saying crucify inclusive
[1:22:14] and it was pilot the political leader
[1:22:19] here he was he was saying listen he said
[1:22:22] I find no fault in him he said he said
[1:22:26] let me release our dear leader release
[1:22:28] him unto you a man
[1:22:30] no they certainly released this one a
[1:22:32] murderer
[1:22:33] oh yeah depositor what he hasn't done
[1:22:37] anything and even pilots wife sent that
[1:22:41] send that message to pilot
[1:22:42] she should have nothing to do with that
[1:22:44] just man for she suffered said things
[1:22:47] I've even had reamed through the night a
[1:22:50] man so don't do nothing with him
[1:22:52] Eddie and he didn't want to do any with
[1:22:54] him buddy certain but no I shouldn't
[1:22:57] have he we did what God wanted him to do
[1:22:59] really in a sense why because he was
[1:23:02] what he was predestinated to do what he
[1:23:04] was doing anyway
[1:23:06] because he had the lay down his life for
[1:23:08] you and me he volunteered and that's why
[1:23:11] when Pilate talk talk talk he wouldn't
[1:23:13] answer wouldn't say honey oh I didn't
[1:23:16] say nothing oh come on come on defend
[1:23:18] yourself defend your sensor for it amen
[1:23:26] and he wouldn't he just held his peace
[1:23:28] god help us brother hey man
[1:23:31] by the grace of God in this hour in this
[1:23:34] age that we're good we're not gonna miss
[1:23:35] it because brother Lee they crucified
[1:23:38] him now they're gonna crucify you and me
[1:23:40] no matter what you do I trust you're not
[1:23:43] going to compromise amen no not going to
[1:23:47] compromise because listen you compromise
[1:23:50] you're lost
[1:23:52] amen but as he laid down his life so we
[1:23:55] lay down our lives for the Gospels sake
[1:23:58] for Jesus sake amen
[1:23:59] grace of God be with us in this hour for
[1:24:03] the glory of God for therefore our
[1:24:06] salvation
[1:24:07] just think they knew God but they didn't
[1:24:10] worship Him as God they knew about him
[1:24:12] but the elders what do they do and Bible
[1:24:16] says they held the truth in
[1:24:17] unrighteousness a man either forms of
[1:24:22] godliness and they're saying and only
[1:24:24] that we won't read it on down but it all
[1:24:26] goes down to tell you the sin that comes
[1:24:28] in
[1:24:28] oh yeah and now that's that sinners come
[1:24:32] back into the churches oh yeah in fact
[1:24:36] no not not Jews only a few days ago that
[1:24:38] they said they'd they married two
[1:24:40] couples in a certain Church lesbians
[1:24:48] yeah yes another one went and went and
[1:24:51] went into a church
[1:24:52] Eddie was not long ago two days ago
[1:24:54] again and they went into a certain
[1:24:58] church yeah Christian's so-called
[1:25:00] Christian denominational Church and what
[1:25:02] to do married a gay couple what and
[1:25:09] that's that's the judgment of Christ
[1:25:11] because why because of their unrighteous
[1:25:15] faith amen
[1:25:17] because they said rather God is revealed
[1:25:23] from heaven against all ungodliness and
[1:25:26] unrighteousness of men who hold the
[1:25:30] truth they hold the truth in
[1:25:32] unrighteousness you better hold it in
[1:25:37] righteousness hey man I rights his
[1:25:40] attitude and a righteous spirit you're
[1:25:42] taking your stand for him amen
[1:25:47] again verse 24 the invisible things of
[1:25:50] him from the creation of the world are
[1:25:51] clearly seen being understood by the
[1:25:54] things that are made even his eternal
[1:25:57] power and Godhead so that they are
[1:25:59] without excuse a man the world without
[1:26:03] his ghost in light of what God has
[1:26:05] revealed because that when they knew God
[1:26:08] they glorified him not as God neither
[1:26:11] we're thankful but became vain in their
[1:26:13] imaginations and their foolish heart was
[1:26:17] darkened brother they knew god they knew
[1:26:22] this they knew that but their heart was
[1:26:24] darkened
[1:26:25] they knew it in their heads but not in
[1:26:28] their heart professing themselves to be
[1:26:31] wise they became fools and changed the
[1:26:37] glory of the uncorruptible God into an
[1:26:40] image
[1:26:42] made like to corruptible man and to
[1:26:44] birds and four-footed beasts and
[1:26:48] creeping things God blesses words you
[1:26:52] may be seated
[1:26:57] it's going back to the messages that we
[1:27:01] have been ministering on for the last
[1:27:04] number of weeks
[1:27:07] concerning hearing the thing airing the
[1:27:10] Word of God and hearing the revelation
[1:27:12] the way that God wants us to hear it and
[1:27:16] seeing the revelation the way that God
[1:27:20] wants us to see it a man they were
[1:27:24] hearing it but apparently not seated the
[1:27:27] way that that God wanted to see it and
[1:27:30] to get them to do what God wanted them
[1:27:33] to do
[1:27:33] brother it's the same thing with us in
[1:27:36] the hearing of the word in this hour God
[1:27:38] wants us to hear it in a certain way and
[1:27:40] God wants us to see it in a certain way
[1:27:42] because God is wanting us to do a
[1:27:45] certain thing amen and what God wants us
[1:27:48] to do in this hour is the resurrection
[1:27:51] and the rapture he wants us to have that
[1:27:53] faith that it's going to bring the
[1:27:55] resurrection and the rapture into a
[1:27:57] physical manifestation a man so that it
[1:28:00] is no longer just the promise in the
[1:28:01] Word of God but rather God is raising up
[1:28:04] a generation that is going to bring it
[1:28:06] into manifestation and that's why again
[1:28:09] he said that the dead in Christ are
[1:28:11] waiting on us a man what waiting on us
[1:28:14] not now waiting on God no the waiting on
[1:28:16] us the waiting for a generation to rise
[1:28:19] that's going to have the faith of the
[1:28:21] rapture a man and if we got the faith of
[1:28:24] the rapture we're going to have the
[1:28:25] faith of the Resurrection amen
[1:28:28] because Jesus he had the faith of the
[1:28:29] Resurrection and he had the faith of the
[1:28:31] rapture because he laid his life down
[1:28:33] and he picked it up again and the bride
[1:28:35] is laying her life down but she's
[1:28:37] picking it up again
[1:28:38] he made it is for the glory of God we're
[1:28:41] going to pick it up in resurrection and
[1:28:43] rapturing faint amen
[1:28:45] it's just not leaning it down for
[1:28:47] religion it's not just raining downward
[1:28:49] for this doctrine or that doctrine is
[1:28:51] leaning
[1:28:52] down for what for the purpose that God
[1:28:54] wants us to lay it down and to pick it
[1:28:57] up for the purpose that God wants us to
[1:28:59] pick it up
[1:29:00] what is it that God wants to do and
[1:29:02] again we've got are we going to
[1:29:04] recognize and believe and know that we
[1:29:07] are we are not back here in Luther's
[1:29:08] hour Luther's ager or even even in the
[1:29:11] age of the first church age no know what
[1:29:14] God did thing is one thing but what God
[1:29:16] is doing now is another and what God did
[1:29:19] in Luther's age Wesley sage and the end
[1:29:22] and the Pentecostal type and that was
[1:29:25] one thing but God that God is doing
[1:29:26] something else
[1:29:27] amen no go ahead as I have said God
[1:29:31] didn't do away with that no God God was
[1:29:33] adding to it God God took justification
[1:29:36] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:29:38] Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit
[1:29:39] amen but that's not that's not the end
[1:29:42] that's not the finish of it because why
[1:29:45] because God had a motive and objective
[1:29:47] in doing what he did he said I will
[1:29:49] restore say the Lord a man and he knew
[1:29:53] that in the indian day in the first
[1:29:55] church they said what he gave then the
[1:29:57] enemy came in and the enemy was going to
[1:29:59] head to it take away from it a man and
[1:30:02] the church went from one from the light
[1:30:04] into darkness a man and there are those
[1:30:08] Church ages where the darkness came in
[1:30:10] and the darkness came in by God said I'm
[1:30:12] going to restore saith the Lord
[1:30:14] and he and he brought and he brought the
[1:30:17] light through Luther Andrew Wesley and
[1:30:19] for the Pentecostals but again the
[1:30:22] public arts of the year here in this
[1:30:24] last stage he said it went into total
[1:30:26] darkness
[1:30:27] a man absolute total darkness and again
[1:30:31] it's like I said about when I was in
[1:30:32] there in the school that time and they
[1:30:35] do recognize you know the church ages
[1:30:38] they recognize this happened and that
[1:30:40] happened something else happened and but
[1:30:42] they don't recognize me about the church
[1:30:44] last Church age what you and I
[1:30:46] recognized as I said the teacher the
[1:30:48] Bible teacher said to me in the school
[1:30:50] and not me but to the students now he
[1:30:52] said what church age are we in he says
[1:30:55] anybody here know what church age we're
[1:30:56] in and nobody knew but me by the grace
[1:30:59] of God a man and so I wouldn't wouldn't
[1:31:03] answer I was just waiting for somebody
[1:31:05] else
[1:31:06] answer until he asked the question two
[1:31:08] or three times and finally I just raised
[1:31:11] my hand and he saw he said okay he said
[1:31:14] what church or what Serge's are we in
[1:31:16] and I said I said we're even allowed to
[1:31:18] see interchange it is the last row
[1:31:21] change all he said you were right he
[1:31:24] said exactly right but he recognized
[1:31:26] that and then there are others they
[1:31:28] would recognize that but they don't
[1:31:30] recognize the condition of the last sir
[1:31:33] change they don't recognize that they
[1:31:35] might go into the scripture there and
[1:31:37] read it but again it's not having the
[1:31:39] effect on them and no more than a the
[1:31:42] effect on those here in the in the book
[1:31:44] of Romans a man and he's got the
[1:31:47] revelation of God but you're not
[1:31:49] worshiping God you don't worship Him as
[1:31:51] God and you got this revelation but he
[1:31:54] said you're not doing this you got this
[1:31:56] revelation but you're not doing that
[1:31:58] exactly it was just just religion a man
[1:32:02] oh they believe this when they believe
[1:32:04] that so also in the in the last church
[1:32:06] age a man and it says concerning again
[1:32:10] the last 13 excuse me and he said oh
[1:32:16] they they three that tells you what
[1:32:19] they're thinking but it also gives you
[1:32:21] the revelation of what God knows amen
[1:32:24] because in the last search age they felt
[1:32:26] they were all right they believed that
[1:32:28] God was with them God was in them God
[1:32:30] was around them God was blessing them oh
[1:32:32] yeah because we got where we're rich and
[1:32:34] increased with Goods and we have need of
[1:32:36] nothing and brother don't you ever judge
[1:32:38] your life that way no way don't you say
[1:32:41] what I believe I believe everything is
[1:32:43] fine I am rich and increased with Goods
[1:32:45] and I've been blessed with this I've
[1:32:46] been blessed with that brother no no no
[1:32:49] you could have all of that because jesus
[1:32:51] said but but he said you don't know that
[1:32:53] you are wretched miserable poor blind
[1:32:55] and naked and the sad part he says you
[1:32:59] don't know it a man that's the spirit of
[1:33:03] the load of C&H a man the deception of
[1:33:06] the load of C&H they feel this but God
[1:33:09] by God has seen this brothers one thing
[1:33:13] to see there for you to see this but how
[1:33:15] does God see it one thing for you to
[1:33:17] think
[1:33:18] look at look at all my again looking to
[1:33:20] the mirror of the word a man and listen
[1:33:24] and the Bible says again that he looks
[1:33:26] into the mirror of the word but he
[1:33:28] forgets what he sees a man many have
[1:33:33] looked into the mirror of the word of
[1:33:34] the revealed word for this iron for this
[1:33:36] age but brother and you're first they
[1:33:40] did they saw themselves and they humble
[1:33:42] themselves oh I believe the message and
[1:33:44] so on but they came to the place where
[1:33:48] they forgot what they saw in the mirror
[1:33:51] amen they praise the name of the Lord
[1:33:54] for the grace of God to us who don't
[1:33:56] forget hey man they looked they saw and
[1:34:00] maybe they did this they did that or

[1:34:07] know the way I should dress and so on
[1:34:10] and the brothers go do this to do this
[1:34:12] to this but amen but after a while they
[1:34:16] forget every - every old my brother
[1:34:19] every generation every transience
[1:34:22] they looked into the mayor of the Word
[1:34:24] of God a man and there are those that
[1:34:26] remembered but there are those that
[1:34:28] forgot hey man
[1:34:30] those that remember their faith took
[1:34:32] upon the glory and those that forgot
[1:34:34] their faith took him on to hell amen
[1:34:37] like the rich young ruler lifted up his
[1:34:39] eyes in hell being in torment amen and
[1:34:42] remember he kept he kept all the

[1:34:48] youth oh no no as I said nobody here can
[1:34:51] say that knowing I'm a a teammate but
[1:34:54] see his motive and his objective wasn't
[1:34:56] right he'd ever had a Holy Ghost or a
[1:35:00] seat of God motive an objective no no he
[1:35:03] wanted for this reason for that reason
[1:35:05] he want to give the glory to himself but
[1:35:06] not the glory to Jesus amen

[1:42:19] sees us religiously but see what God
[1:42:22] sees us amen
[1:42:24] I trust brother that we're going beyond
[1:42:27] what he was seeing here in the first
[1:42:29] church age or the last church age
[1:42:31] wretched miserable poor blind naked and
[1:42:38] they're probably God I lied to the fact
[1:42:40] and don't know it
[1:42:42] he says that that'd be pretty that had
[1:42:45] to be pretty well gone there that'd be
[1:42:47] pretty well insane to know a person out
[1:42:51] there and and and naked and don't know
[1:42:53] he's naked he's the same when we see
[1:42:57] that those things going on in the world
[1:42:59] out there that's insanity
[1:43:00] the Prophet said the world's gone insane
[1:43:03] and brother we've lived to see the
[1:43:05] insane world amen it is insane the way
[1:43:10] people think the way people act the way
[1:43:12] people dress it's insanity and what
[1:43:15] they're putting the emphasis on in this
[1:43:16] life it's insanity
[1:43:18] god help us amen
[1:43:22] that we're going to hear the word of God
[1:43:24] the way God wants us to hear it see it
[1:43:27] the way God wants us to see it amen and
[1:43:29] we'll live the life that Jesus lived he
[1:43:33] laid down his life for the gospel sake
[1:43:36] for the words sake what but for our sake
[1:43:40] yes but we were identified in the word
[1:43:43] amen the seed of God the sons and
[1:43:46] daughters of God amen so we lay down our
[1:43:48] lives for one another we're not living
[1:43:50] for ourselves there's so many believers
[1:43:52] they're just living for themselves
[1:43:54] that's all they just you just believe
[1:43:57] this and this it's just religion you
[1:43:58] know like in Romans chapter one there
[1:44:00] they got the religion and they they got
[1:44:02] there they got their righteousness but
[1:44:04] it's become hard righteousness because
[1:44:07] they're not they're not yielding to it
[1:44:09] there
[1:44:10] no no no oh they believe this but then
[1:44:14] oh I believe God yeah but they're not
[1:44:16] worshiping God and if you worship God
[1:44:20] you go to worship in the morning noon
[1:44:22] and night you're devoting your life to
[1:44:25] Him morning noon and night
[1:44:27] I don't know you god help us brother but
[1:44:31] he but a proves if you're not doing it
[1:44:33] it proves that you haven't heard it the
[1:44:35] way God here or is it ears that or the
[1:44:38] way that God wants you to hear it and
[1:44:40] you're not seeing it the way God wants
[1:44:42] you to see him you're maybe Herot the
[1:44:44] way that you want to hear it see it the
[1:44:46] way you want to see it or the way men
[1:44:48] want you to see it so they could say oh
[1:44:50] we got so many believe in this message
[1:44:53] some years ago they said oh yeah there's
[1:44:56] two million around the world that
[1:44:58] believes his message yeah I said they're
[1:45:02] believing in their heads I said how many
[1:45:03] are believing it in their hearts it's
[1:45:05] not going to be two million going to
[1:45:07] rapture a man no no but the more and
[1:45:13] more religious they got the more and
[1:45:15] more denominational they got the more
[1:45:18] and more people came to identify with
[1:45:19] the message but the probably God said
[1:45:23] again there might be weld he said 500
[1:45:25] not even one time he said one or two
[1:45:26] hundred and they like this just like he
[1:45:30] told that sister and he said God asked
[1:45:32] me to or someone asked him the her
[1:45:35] sister about picking out so many people
[1:45:38] on the earths they were warming but how
[1:45:40] many people would be there for the
[1:45:41] rapture and that's when he told us
[1:45:43] history says sister if God asked me to
[1:45:45] pick out he would dozen or so something
[1:45:48] like that he said I'd be scared to death
[1:45:51] he said I'd have it be so hard to pick
[1:45:54] the fight number why because he was he
[1:45:58] was recognizing that even the old ones
[1:46:00] were losing their experience he said
[1:46:04] when I went our old brothers and sisters
[1:46:06] he said are losing their experience and
[1:46:08] and they're getting dry in their in
[1:46:10] their testimony he said it's serious
[1:46:14] yeah he was experiencing that and as I
[1:46:18] said he was experiencing that he even in
[1:46:20] his own church
[1:46:23] yeah yes because even this message right
[1:46:30] here in 1965 random tire Michael Wright
[1:46:36] and I have heard but now I see that was
[1:46:41] life Tabernacle but it was it was
[1:46:43] professing believers yeah
[1:46:46] and in 1965 I think was 65 that a
[1:46:50] brother branham had preached so many a
[1:46:52] couple of servants there first in
[1:46:54] Shreveport and was on the phone and many
[1:46:57] others were listening to it in other
[1:46:58] churches and after he fretted for these
[1:47:00] preachers that particular sermon they
[1:47:03] called brother more Jack more and they
[1:47:06] said brother he said don't let William
[1:47:10] Brennan preach tomorrow night he's don't
[1:47:14] let him bridge after he preached a
[1:47:16] certain message that it was so heard
[1:47:17] they couldn't take it no more and so
[1:47:20] brother Jack Moore went to the hotel
[1:47:22] looking for brother Branham I couldn't
[1:47:25] find him any but and I sure if that was
[1:47:30] the situation then but they had put
[1:47:33] brother Ram in a certain hotel and and
[1:47:35] it was an expensive hotel and he felt
[1:47:37] that it wasn't it wasn't right for a
[1:47:39] Christian to be in such an expensive
[1:47:42] hotel and so he he went and he got
[1:47:45] himself into another hotel yeah cheaper
[1:47:48] one I told her brother of the head and
[1:47:51] he even even went flying on a plane he
[1:47:53] said you don't fly off a rock he said
[1:47:56] the first-class issue fly down to the
[1:47:58] last class he says as a Christian he
[1:48:03] said you're not into the best he said
[1:48:04] you take the least yeah amazing
[1:48:08] absolutely amazing and the brother was
[1:48:11] shocked when I when I told that oh he's
[1:48:13] I never heard that before
[1:48:15] oh yes I said it's just sits there are
[1:48:17] the tapes I said that's what he
[1:48:19] mentioned and you know where he was if
[1:48:21] he was talking about that when he flew
[1:48:24] from India he was in India and he was
[1:48:27] flying from India and that's where he
[1:48:29] was sitting right at the back he said
[1:48:32] that's what Christian said amen
[1:48:35] the name of the Lord no Christmas today
[1:48:38] want the best Christmas today want
[1:48:41] number one Chris yesterday want upfront
[1:48:43] Chris yesterday he want recognition and
[1:48:46] so on all brother if price is living in
[1:48:49] you you don't want it hey man no no no
[1:48:53] you're gonna take you take the least
[1:48:56] brother and again if you're hearing it
[1:49:00] the way God wants you to hear it see it
[1:49:01] the way God wants you see it you'll have
[1:49:03] that attitude amen
[1:49:05] you'll have that spirit amen because the
[1:49:07] word is gonna produce that kind of a
[1:49:09] life in you as it was in Christ brother
[1:49:13] they were thinking that Messiah was
[1:49:14] going to come here mister I will come
[1:49:16] there to Messiah be there no no born
[1:49:19] born in a manger
[1:49:21] born in a bird yeah they thought maybe
[1:49:25] be born in with any in in a in one in a
[1:49:28] house of the priesthood in the temple no
[1:49:34] not by any means he was born in a barn
[1:49:38] oh but but they went to the hotel but
[1:49:44] there was no room there and surely God
[1:49:47] could have arranged for it if he wanted
[1:49:49] it oh yeah there's no problem no but
[1:49:53] they couldn't no can't get him okay
[1:49:55] that's where Joseph was going and Mary
[1:49:58] was going May they felt that way with
[1:50:00] God you know all well this the Lord so
[1:50:03] you know we should be in the best no you
[1:50:06] go into the scriptures more often than
[1:50:09] not he was down to lowest and he started
[1:50:13] with somebody up there he put him down
[1:50:15] there
[1:50:15] amen you talk about but but the Apostle
[1:50:18] Paul he started up there but he ended up
[1:50:21] down there
[1:50:23] amen he ended up in prison he laid down
[1:50:27] his life praise the name of the Lord
[1:50:29] where brother Jesus started the in the
[1:50:32] he started in the manger in the burn but
[1:50:37] he's the king of kings and Lord of lords
[1:50:40] everybody so brother Wiegel the same way
[1:50:44] we're not exalted here we're exalted in
[1:50:47] glory anyway we're gonna sit with him in
[1:50:50] his strong in glory by the grace of God
[1:50:53] but we sit with him in strong now the
[1:50:56] revealed word but I tell you this we're
[1:50:59] not going to be recognized we're not
[1:51:01] gonna be honored he wasn't so we want a
[1:51:04] man but we're going to glory by the
[1:51:07] grace of God so brother we got to hear
[1:51:10] it the way God wants us to hear it we
[1:51:12] gotta say it the way God wants us to see
[1:51:14] it amen and not only that but you got to
[1:51:18] have the right motive and the right
[1:51:19] objective in your heart
[1:51:21] amen for the glory of God yes for the
[1:51:25] salvation of our souls but for the glory
[1:51:28] of God amen the right motive and a right
[1:51:32] objective brother that revelation
[1:51:35] brother has said we know that Abel heard
[1:51:38] of the way God wanted him to hear saw
[1:51:40] the way God who wanted him to see it
[1:51:42] Amen but it cost him his life yeah he
[1:51:47] had a right motive and a right objective
[1:51:49] oh yeah he didn't he didn't compromise
[1:51:52] with Cain even when Cain was arguably
[1:51:54] then left out there in the garden
[1:51:56] somewhere
[1:51:56] amen Cain was arguing with with Abel way
[1:52:01] because Abel's sacrifice was accepted
[1:52:04] hey man I believe that the pillar far
[1:52:08] came down and he received his sacrifice
[1:52:10] and here's came there with all that he
[1:52:12] had there and he felt maybe you know the
[1:52:14] Lord should bless me for this McCall
[1:52:16] that I have done and all that and all
[1:52:18] that Abel did was Winona and got this
[1:52:20] lamb and killed it and shed blood
[1:52:22] everywhere even on himself amen but Cain
[1:52:26] fell to hold this I've got a good
[1:52:29] sacrifice here amen brother
[1:52:31] that's the sacrifice of most
[1:52:33] denominational churches after
[1:52:34] Thanksgiving Day you ever notice that
[1:52:39] you iive in a mini a church and brother
[1:52:43] on Thanksgiving Day oh they got all got
[1:52:46] their the altars lined
[1:52:48] we're fruit and vegetables everything
[1:52:51] else that they've grown and so on oh
[1:52:53] yeah I see
[1:52:54] that many years yeah that was I thought
[1:52:58] that was Cain's offering I said they
[1:53:01] need Abel's offering amen
[1:53:04] need to have that revelation your soul
[1:53:06] by the grace of God brother
[1:53:08] it's like Abel had the right motive and
[1:53:11] the right objective amen
[1:53:13] it wasn't just to please God no no it
[1:53:17] was to restore fellowship with God amen
[1:53:22] it's one thing the place God
[1:53:24] hey man and brother and again God came
[1:53:26] down and talked to came and and God said
[1:53:29] this the king this decane oh yeah II
[1:53:30] just think God talk to King amen but we
[1:53:36] have no record in anywhere that God was
[1:53:37] talking to Abel it was by faith that
[1:53:41] Abel offered a more excellent sacrifice
[1:53:43] now Cain at an excellent one and we can
[1:53:47] offer an excellent one but God's looking
[1:53:49] for the more excellent amen
[1:53:52] the one that God wants the one that God
[1:53:55] is looking for a man to show his
[1:53:57] influence in your life in your
[1:54:00] revelation in your faith amen so brother
[1:54:04] Abel laid down his life oh yeah
[1:54:09] thank the Lord and yet when when he went
[1:54:11] Cain went out there and argue with Abel
[1:54:13] Abel wasn't gonna compromise Abel knew
[1:54:16] that he had done what was right he done
[1:54:19] what what he needed what for and it
[1:54:21] wasn't it wasn't as I said just to
[1:54:22] please God but to restore his fellowship
[1:54:24] with God amen Abel repented and he
[1:54:30] offered the blood sacrifice because he
[1:54:33] wanted Rafael oshit restored a man and
[1:54:37] brother Christ came to restore that
[1:54:39] fellowship for you and me brother it's
[1:54:46] to establish it well what about it's not
[1:54:48] it's not to give us a relationship we
[1:54:50] got a relationship I'm born with it
[1:54:55] I'll come into this world seed of God
[1:54:58] sons and daughters of God but born in
[1:55:02] sin so the Redeemer came to bring us
[1:55:07] back into
[1:55:08] with the father whereby be old what
[1:55:11] manner of love the father has bestowed
[1:55:12] upon us whereby we can now say abba
[1:55:15] father father father father Amen
[1:55:20] hallelujah amen brother what the
[1:55:25] relationship is restored we were cut off
[1:55:27] by seeing a man but he knew that you
[1:55:31] were his son you knew that you were his
[1:55:32] daughter and he swear he brought the
[1:55:34] Redeemer down to a man that what for to
[1:55:37] shed the blood perfect blood to take
[1:55:41] away your seat not only that just thank
[1:55:44] God
[1:55:44] oh just say that that tracker bike was
[1:55:48] so perfect that God don't even remember
[1:55:53] your seeing God you know no we do the
[1:55:57] devil is gonna bring it back to your
[1:55:59] remembrance in your mind but I tell you
[1:56:02] no man can lay a charge against God's
[1:56:05] elect because why because Jesus through
[1:56:08] through what he did the sin was cast
[1:56:11] into the sea of forgetfulness
[1:56:13] oh we're not so forgetful but God is
[1:56:18] hallelujah he did it in such a way just
[1:56:21] think God he forgot it God don't
[1:56:25] remember my sin know if your feet if he
[1:56:27] recognizes your faith brother and your
[1:56:29] faith puts it into action in your life
[1:56:31] oh yeah hallelujah and now somebody say
[1:56:37] go to the Lord and say Lord he's guilty
[1:56:39] of this guilty guilty what what do you
[1:56:43] mean
[1:56:43] I don't see it you see one thing God
[1:56:48] sees another and it's based on that
[1:56:50] person's faith with brother I trust our
[1:56:54] faith will be as strong as that person
[1:56:59] as real as that person thank God they
[1:57:05] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:57:09] God
[1:57:10] amen God give us the faith that pleases
[1:57:14] him God give us the faith the brother
[1:57:17] for that we are sinners saved by grace
[1:57:23] we're saved not will be saved we are
[1:57:26] saved
[1:57:27] amen and that God has put all sin
[1:57:32] obvious seed in the sea of forgetfulness
[1:57:36] amen brother
[1:57:40] sister do you hear the word the message
[1:57:45] the way God wants you to hear do you see
[1:57:47] it the way God wants you to see it is it
[1:57:49] God or is it you in your head with a lot
[1:57:53] of so-called believers I tell you this
[1:57:54] it's all in her head
[1:57:56] yeah as I said one time when I was back
[1:58:00] years ago and I was ministry noon I'm
[1:58:03] not necessarily ministering but somebody
[1:58:06] else had ministered not me I wasn't
[1:58:08] ministering then and in another church
[1:58:12] and all I guess there was two or three
[1:58:15] hundred in the church church was
[1:58:17] practically full and of course there was
[1:58:20] an altar call and and usually back then
[1:58:23] at the end of the service everybody
[1:58:25] would come up around the altar and
[1:58:26] worship and worship and worship at the
[1:58:29] end of the after the sermon was preached
[1:58:31] and I remember I was on the platform
[1:58:34] there and I just I was on the side of
[1:58:36] the platform side of the bow pit and
[1:58:38] that the pastor at the time was still
[1:58:40] behind the pulpit and I was too here but
[1:58:43] everybody was worshiping worshiping
[1:58:44] worshiping and praising the Lord and and
[1:58:47] I remember opening my eyes and as I said
[1:58:50] I saw a couple of sisters there I said
[1:58:56] Oh Lord I said there's a problem I said
[1:59:00] they don't have the anointing of your
[1:59:03] spirit now they were worshiping they
[1:59:06] were praising God but there was
[1:59:10] something there at least the Lord was
[1:59:12] showing me and revealing to me Oh I said
[1:59:18] Lord I said they're not believers I said
[1:59:21] they're going back into the world
[1:59:24] what led you to believe that well it's
[1:59:27] just something the Lord revealed to me
[1:59:29] because they look like believers they
[1:59:31] activate believers they were dressed
[1:59:33] like believers but again I was in
[1:59:36] contact with a spirit yeah with that
[1:59:41] person's spirit and time fortune said
[1:59:51] but it was maybe I don't know maybe two
[1:59:53] or three four years later but they were
[1:59:55] ended up in the world and they might be
[2:00:00] gone on somewhere now they'd they'd be I
[2:00:03] guess as olds I am or older yeah but
[2:00:07] again I was just young man they're
[2:00:09] standing on the platform just worshiping
[2:00:13] you know to God be the glory
[2:00:16] it's not me it's not me it's the Lord
[2:00:21] and like I said just other things the
[2:00:24] Lord has revealed to me and showed me
[2:00:27] giving me the understanding God Ellis
[2:00:30] brother I want to keep hearing things
[2:00:33] the way God wants me to hear it I want
[2:00:36] to keep seeing it the way God wants me
[2:00:37] to see it and Lord by the grace of God I
[2:00:40] want the right motive and a right
[2:00:42] objective amen and basically what is the
[2:00:46] right motor and right objective no
[2:00:47] matter what you're doing it's all for
[2:00:50] the glory of God you know whatever you
[2:00:55] do is for the glory of God the life you
[2:00:58] live is for the glory of God amen
[2:01:01] what you're saying the witness you give
[2:01:04] that whatever you reflect it's for the
[2:01:06] glory of God the right motive and a
[2:01:08] right objective for God's glory you're
[2:01:10] giving God the preeminence amen they're
[2:01:15] not giving premise to this one this one
[2:01:17] this one give God the preeminence not my
[2:01:20] will Lord didin be done that's giving
[2:01:23] God the preeminence by the grace of God
[2:01:26] it is doing God a service according to
[2:01:29] his will not your will it's his will
[2:01:33] amen
[2:01:35] but it's a generation that's doing God a
[2:01:37] service without his will and this was
[2:01:42] the the message the Prophet preached on
[2:01:45] in 1965 again in Wrentham Tabernacle in
[2:01:51] July of 1965 doing God to service
[2:01:55] without his will
[2:01:57] amen so if you're going to hear it see
[2:02:03] it the way God wants you to do it and
[2:02:04] you're going to have the right motor but
[2:02:06] objective all for the glory of God
[2:02:08] giving God the preeminence
[2:02:10] amen you will do God a service according
[2:02:14] to his will amen
[2:02:16] you're not gonna do what you want to do
[2:02:17] you're gonna do what God wants you to do
[2:02:19] you're gonna follow God's leadership not
[2:02:22] your leadership you're gonna follow Holy
[2:02:24] Ghost leadership not human leadership
[2:02:26] don't go by your feelings no don't go by
[2:02:30] your intellect and your reasoning no no
[2:02:34] we're going by faith you got a-you cast
[2:02:36] down reasoning oh yeah you're going by
[2:02:39] faith what God reveals to you God want
[2:02:41] me to do this God want me to go there
[2:02:43] God want me to do this and so on
[2:02:44] oh yeah you're doing it's not and again
[2:02:47] it's not you the leaves as Christ that
[2:02:49] liveth in you amen
[2:02:52] and what would Jesus do this what would
[2:02:55] Jesus do if he was in control he would
[2:03:01] certainly come together with the Saints
[2:03:02] for he said where I have gathered two or
[2:03:04] three together my name there I am in the
[2:03:08] midst you know it says where two or
[2:03:13] three are gathered together in my name
[2:03:14] is where I am as the original where I
[2:03:16] have gathered them is not man gathering
[2:03:19] himself is Christ gathering them he says
[2:03:23] there am I in the midst by the grace of
[2:03:26] God amen so brothers sister are we doing
[2:03:32] this according to his will and for his
[2:03:35] glory for his honor for his phrase to
[2:03:37] give preeminence to him why are we doing
[2:03:40] it not only this coming to church but
[2:03:43] other things you do as I've said before
[2:03:45] even your job you got to have
[2:03:48] have the leadership of God in your job
[2:03:50] what is the will of God I'm doing the
[2:03:53] will of God oh yeah don't think seed and
[2:03:58] unfortunately we live in a world where
[2:04:02] intellectually people choose this job
[2:04:04] choose this job you know all because
[2:04:07] they're trained this way they're trained
[2:04:08] that way
[2:04:09] you don't go by that you go by Holy
[2:04:12] Ghost leadership yeah you know Lord you
[2:04:21] want me to do this you want me to do
[2:04:22] this you want me to do that yes yes son
[2:04:24] yeah it's not explained before the way
[2:04:28] all the way that God has made me this
[2:04:30] way this way and I wondered I I do she
[2:04:33] prayed and I talked to the Lord about it
[2:04:35] and said Lord is it do you want me to do
[2:04:36] this you know what's the purpose and so
[2:04:40] on now sometimes God would tell me to
[2:04:42] purpose other times he wouldn't I had to
[2:04:45] go on and follow his leadership yeah so
[2:04:50] brother let's make sure that we're gonna
[2:04:55] do God a service with his will not
[2:04:58] without his will according to the will
[2:05:01] of God not contrary to the will of God
[2:05:04] amen so we'll get more and more into
[2:05:07] this later but it let me just leave this
[2:05:10] quote these quotes with you again and he
[2:05:13] said we're in the end time and now the
[2:05:16] Lord bless you richly I get started on
[2:05:19] that and I and forget about time and
[2:05:23] we're going to fade pretty quickly into
[2:05:27] eternity
[2:05:27] anyhow well he was talking about the
[2:05:30] length of his sermon he said when I get
[2:05:33] started on this he's I forget about time
[2:05:34] so does your pastor and I I got a I got
[2:05:40] a watch but I rarely look at it yeah and
[2:05:45] I did I I've looked at that one up there
[2:05:48] man but again we're dealing with eternal
[2:05:54] issues
[2:05:57] so brother don't lead time control you
[2:06:01] forget it
[2:06:03] as I said there was a time when oh yeah
[2:06:06] when the anointing was there he will
[2:06:07] ieave when I was in the Salvation Army
[2:06:09] that's a young man Oh
[2:06:13] on Sunday night not 9 o'clock no 12
[2:06:23] o'clock yeah
[2:06:25] one o'clock yeah that's when the service
[2:06:30] would end oh yeah they go in worship
[2:06:34] praise the Lord
[2:06:34] of course they used to have testimony
[2:06:36] meetings and then they go preacher
[2:06:38] preach the message and and then and to
[2:06:41] get into altar call then people other
[2:06:44] people get up around the altar and
[2:06:45] praise and worship the Lord then they
[2:06:47] give maybe might sometimes I have a
[2:06:50] Jericho March and and as I told you I
[2:06:54] was sitting in the front seat in the in
[2:06:58] the pew there anyway end and and they
[2:07:02] would they would March they were march
[2:07:04] down they walk across the front of the
[2:07:06] foot in front of the altar they would go
[2:07:08] down the other aisle want open to the
[2:07:10] best of you will come around again and
[2:07:11] again and they were singing onward
[2:07:13] Christian soldiers marching as to why
[2:07:16] they go and go and go and I remember
[2:07:18] having to pull my legs in because I was
[2:07:20] sitting in the front seat I had to pull
[2:07:22] my legs in when they were going to went
[2:07:23] around the corner and so on so but again
[2:07:26] that was that was a that was a Sunday
[2:07:28] evening service and it would go on to
[2:07:30] 12:00 or 1:00 o'clock at night and again
[2:07:33] in the morning again they'd be there
[2:07:35] 10:30 for to pray for a half hour and
[2:07:37] the service start at 11:00 and the
[2:07:40] search will go on to maybe two o'clock
[2:07:42] yeah two o'clock and then we'd be go
[2:07:45] home and going to have a dinner and then
[2:07:47] we had to come back for Sunday school
[2:07:49] what yeah come back for Sunday school
[2:07:52] and then this Sunday school we would be
[2:07:54] in Sunday school until 4:00 4:30 we'd go
[2:07:56] home and get supper come back for a
[2:07:58] service and evening 6:30 yeah oh yeah it
[2:08:02] was all gone it was the Lord it was the
[2:08:04] Lord amen it was giving free MS to the
[2:08:08] Lord and they loved the Lord
[2:08:10] so brother they weren't considered a
[2:08:13] weren't thinking about time they were
[2:08:15] into eternity oh yes and he said work
[2:08:20] and he said he said I get started on
[2:08:23] that and forget about time he said we're
[2:08:26] going to fade pretty quickly into
[2:08:28] eternity
[2:08:28] anyhow well your spirit is right and
[2:08:31] your attitude is right your motive is
[2:08:32] right your objective is right we're
[2:08:34] going into eternity amen so he said God
[2:08:41] is sovereign excuse me as we see here
[2:08:52] David Dunn in the scripture reading of a
[2:08:55] first chronicles 13 but do God does not
[2:08:58] give us merits on good intentions no no
[2:09:03] there's only one way to serve God and
[2:09:06] that's by doing his will at his command
[2:09:10] there's not your idea it's God's Amen
[2:09:15] not your intentions and he said you
[2:09:19] might have good intentions but he said
[2:09:22] God does not give us merits on good
[2:09:25] intentions now he said there's only one
[2:09:29] way to serve God that's by doing his
[2:09:31] will at his command and God being
[2:09:34] sovereign he said there's no one to tell
[2:09:36] him what to do or how to do it he said
[2:09:39] he does it the way he wants to do it and
[2:09:42] because he knows the right way to do it
[2:09:45] and that makes me feel good and not to
[2:09:48] make us all feel good and I'm sure it
[2:09:51] does for one would have it coming in
[2:09:54] this way and one whatever going that way
[2:09:56] and the other another way but one great
[2:09:58] thing about God he has not left us now
[2:10:02] without knowing what's the truth and how
[2:10:05] to do it he wouldn't be just he wouldn't
[2:10:10] be just to punish us for doing something
[2:10:12] that we didn't know how it was going to
[2:10:15] be done and then let us stumble into
[2:10:17] something he is not that kind of a god
[2:10:20] he's a God that speaks a word and
[2:10:22] expects his children to believe
[2:10:24] and therefore he knows what's the best
[2:10:26] and when to do it and how to do it and
[2:10:29] we have our ideas but God knows a man
[2:10:35] brother sister we had our ideas but
[2:10:39] sometimes our ideas are not right I'll
[2:10:45] finish with this old brother listen what
[2:10:49] time are we living him yeah we're seeing
[2:10:54] what he didn't see well he may have seen
[2:10:57] it but he didn't tell it he told some
[2:10:59] things but he also said when I go to my
[2:11:02] grave he said there's a lot of things he
[2:11:04] knew he said that he God has showed him
[2:11:06] revealed to him he said when I go to my
[2:11:08] grave it'll be in my heart he wouldn't
[2:11:11] tell us so brother what we're seeing I
[2:11:14] believe he saw oh yeah he saw it again I
[2:11:21] know that it's not doesn't have the
[2:11:25] effect on many a believer because they
[2:11:28] don't see it as even brother Jareau sees
[2:11:30] it because they don't they don't realize
[2:11:32] what it was like 50 years ago and what
[2:11:35] it's like now and our young generation
[2:11:41] right here our young sisters and
[2:11:42] brothers god bless him it's wonderful
[2:11:46] sisters to have you with us to be to
[2:11:50] have you they're paying attention to the
[2:11:52] word and so on but pray grace that God
[2:11:56] have give them the revelation of what
[2:11:57] the world was fifty years ago to what it
[2:12:00] is now and God gave them the revelation
[2:12:02] of how serious the world is now compared
[2:12:06] to what it used to be like I said this
[2:12:09] is not the world I lived in this is not
[2:12:10] the world my definitely my father lived
[2:12:12] in he wouldn't want to live in it and my
[2:12:15] grandmother grandfather no no it's like
[2:12:17] I said if they came back and saw this
[2:12:18] world they said let's go back again
[2:12:20] forget it we're not going to stay here
[2:12:22] no they wouldn't want to stay if they're
[2:12:25] in glory and they came back eating the
[2:12:28] fellowship with with saints and so on
[2:12:30] and they saw the world the way
[2:12:32] everything is going and even the way
[2:12:33] so-called churches are going and it
[2:12:35] so-called believers
[2:12:36] so-called Christians no they said we're
[2:12:39] going home goodbye and they'll go on
[2:12:42] back to glory they would they definitely
[2:12:45] wouldn't want to stay no wonder Jesus
[2:12:48] said how long shall I be with you see
[2:12:51] that's that's the confirmation that if
[2:12:53] Saints came from eternity they go they
[2:12:56] go back oh yeah Jesus I thought finally
[2:13:00] Jesus got the faith brother I trust and
[2:13:03] the brighter get that faith Jesus came
[2:13:06] to that revelation and he got that faith
[2:13:08] what faith with that he said I am no
[2:13:10] more in the world what no more in the
[2:13:16] world that was John 17 and yet what did
[2:13:21] he do because he was no more in the
[2:13:23] world he prayed for those that the
[2:13:26] father had given him who were still in
[2:13:28] the world he said I pray not for this
[2:13:32] and this and I pray for those that you
[2:13:34] have given me out of the world now why
[2:13:37] because he knew he was on his way out
[2:13:40] praise the Lord so the bride ought to
[2:13:44] have the same feeling oh yeah that
[2:13:47] you're sure you're more in touch with
[2:13:49] eternity than you are with time and
[2:13:51] because you are more in touch with
[2:13:53] eternity then you feel I am no more in
[2:13:57] the world hallelujah praise the Lord the
[2:14:03] resurrection of the rapture is getting
[2:14:04] more and more and more real to us by the
[2:14:07] grace of God a man is not oh this is
[2:14:14] going to happen tomorrow I've got to do
[2:14:15] this tomorrow gotta do that tomorrow or
[2:14:17] they're gonna do this no what's God
[2:14:19] going to do where we ought to be more
[2:14:24] conscious of what God's going to do not
[2:14:27] what man is doing praise the Lord
[2:14:31] God knows what's best God knows when to
[2:14:34] do it how to do it he said oh brother
[2:14:40] listen what time are we living in what's
[2:14:42] the age what's the hour that we're
[2:14:45] living it's not time for these things
[2:14:47] that we are that they are talking
[2:14:50] about that's past he said judgment is on
[2:14:54] hand now and you can see it breaking you
[2:14:58] remember the rock on the mountain
[2:15:00] judgment hour you remember the
[2:15:02] revelation or the vision of the bride
[2:15:04] just keep her instead don't let her get
[2:15:07] out of step and as I said in my visit to
[2:15:12] one of the malls and I saw her I thought
[2:15:18] it might have been a year after it since
[2:15:19] I was deeper there before but I said
[2:15:21] that last visit such different
[2:15:26] everything was different the people were
[2:15:29] different they were acting different
[2:15:31] they were looking different I said
[2:15:34] Lauren I said insanity has taken over
[2:15:37] oh I said Lord it wasn't like this when
[2:15:41] I was here a few months ago or a year oh
[2:15:44] my lord I said we're closer to the end
[2:15:47] and what people believe I said god help
[2:15:49] us God have mercy Lord I said I said and
[2:15:53] surely I said the resurrection the
[2:15:55] rapture is right right at hand amen
[2:16:01] like I said before that I've been
[2:16:04] walking sometimes who win among people
[2:16:07] and I've looked Oh who's that I thought
[2:16:14] it might be somebody that I fellowship
[2:16:16] with years ago and they were gone on why
[2:16:19] yeah and finally I would get close
[2:16:24] enough they all told us not there yeah
[2:16:26] but you got to be in the spirit to be
[2:16:30] able to recognize because the dating
[2:16:32] crisis the Prophet said the dead in
[2:16:33] Christ going to appear to the living
[2:16:35] Saints yeah but we got to have that
[2:16:38] faith to bring them on the scene well
[2:16:42] yeah the dead in Christ is going to
[2:16:43] appear to us that's right
[2:16:45] and then this is we're going to get
[2:16:48] caught right into into our theophany
[2:16:50] bodies and then all of us are going to
[2:16:52] caught up in the glorified bodies and we
[2:16:54] look up oh there's Jesus yeah there's
[2:16:59] Jesus we're going to rise to meet him
[2:17:01] it's gonna be real I pray copy we
[2:17:04] believe it is not a fairy tale
[2:17:07] definitely not a fairy tale it's real so
[2:17:12] I pray grace that we'll have that faith
[2:17:14] that we believe we believe the
[2:17:18] resurrection we believe the rapture so
[2:17:21] if somebody that you know appears to you
[2:17:26] will you recognize them that they come
[2:17:29] back from eternity they'll get out of
[2:17:32] that them as I said they're right there
[2:17:33] in that dimension and if we get to the
[2:17:37] faith they we get growing faith mature
[2:17:39] and faith and we get strong in faith to
[2:17:42] finally all they recognize it and all
[2:17:44] that they feel the pull from that
[2:17:47] dimension to this one all y'all don't
[2:17:49] feel the pull I trust we're gonna feel
[2:17:51] the pull they'll field of Vulcan and
[2:17:53] they'll appear to the living Saints amen
[2:17:57] praise the name of the Lord
[2:18:00] well when Jesus arose many of those that
[2:18:05] written that were gone they arose they
[2:18:08] went into the city appeared after many
[2:18:10] well when that when the saints of God
[2:18:13] come back from the grave not grave but
[2:18:15] from their dead in Christ not in the
[2:18:17] grave and it's in our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:18:20] and they come back and to appear to the
[2:18:23] living Saints I trust were going to have
[2:18:25] the spiritual revelation to recognize
[2:18:27] who they are as sons and daughters of
[2:18:30] God and cotton and chain and will be
[2:18:34] changed into glorified bodies God make
[2:18:39] it real to us amen
[2:18:41] so that nothing is going to distract us
[2:18:43] from it amen
[2:18:45] so when you grow it again and you're
[2:18:47] among a crowd of people just be on your
[2:18:49] guard because you might see somebody
[2:18:51] that you know and somebody that knows
[2:18:53] you amen but be in the spirit so you'll
[2:18:57] recognize them amen
[2:19:00] let's Stan
[2:19:05] praise the Lord amen
