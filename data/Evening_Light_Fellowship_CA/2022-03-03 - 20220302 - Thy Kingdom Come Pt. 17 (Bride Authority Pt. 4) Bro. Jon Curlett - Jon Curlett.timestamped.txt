[44:15] matt i may have sent you the wrong one
[44:18] it's uh
[44:20] i might have sent you the wrong one i
[44:21] might have to send that to you real
[44:22] quick
[44:23] give me a second
[44:28] there we go
[44:46] yep should be first timothy 2 would be
[44:48] our opening scripture there we go
[44:49] wonderful praise the lord
[44:51] all right first timothy 2 god bless you
[44:54] amen i hadn't heard about brother gerald
[44:56] till just now so we definitely want to
[44:58] keep him in our minds amen
[45:01] at no age is it good to fall and strike
[45:02] your head but especially as you get
[45:03] older things get more brittle and and
[45:05] whatnot so we're just trusting
[45:07] god's grace to be with him amen
[45:09] 1st timothy 2. sister elsa had a
[45:12] wonderful question for me last service
[45:13] and this is where we answer it so it's
[45:15] good to hear the young people listening
[45:17] you know it's that's pretty young to be
[45:18] asking him a question of the minister
[45:20] because she thought she caught me in in
[45:23] a bit of a trap because i said one thing
[45:25] and she said but what about this and so
[45:27] i said if you'll come to church next
[45:28] wednesday we'll give you the answer so
[45:30] that's what we're going to do this
[45:31] evening amen god bless you first timothy
[45:33] 2 11
[45:34] it says let the woman learn in silence
[45:36] with all subjection not just be
[45:39] in silence but to learn in silence
[45:41] there's a purpose in the silence but i
[45:43] suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp
[45:45] authority over the man but to be in
[45:47] silence for adam was first formed then
[45:50] eve and adam was not deceived but the
[45:52] woman being deceived was in the
[45:54] transgression amen god bless his word
[45:56] you may be seated this evening
[45:58] amen we want to continue with the fourth
[45:59] part of this series i'm on the kingdom
[46:02] um bride authority in the thy kingdom
[46:04] come series and this will be the last
[46:05] one that i i speak on authority by god's
[46:07] grace as far as i know
[46:09] but uh we just want to close this out
[46:11] and last not last service but the last
[46:13] service of this topic we were talking
[46:14] about knowing your position and knowing
[46:16] the boundaries of your position and that
[46:18] there's there's power and there's
[46:19] authority as long as you stay within the
[46:21] boundaries that god has laid out for you
[46:22] amen and we know that there are things
[46:24] that god told men to do and there are
[46:26] things that god told men not to do and
[46:27] there are things that he told women to
[46:29] do and there's things that he told women
[46:30] not to do and there's many things that
[46:32] are not you're not supposed to or you
[46:34] shouldn't but they are hard cut clear do
[46:37] not do them amen and we see one of those
[46:39] things today is certainly the way our
[46:40] women dress amen and the way the men
[46:42] dress and the scripture is very clear on
[46:43] that it says a woman's not supposed to
[46:45] wear garments that pertain to a man but
[46:47] says a man's also not supposed to wear
[46:48] the garments that pertain to a woman and
[46:50] it's an abomination in god's sight and
[46:52] guess what god never changes right so we
[46:54] don't come into this age and we say well
[46:56] it's acceptable now to do it therefore
[46:57] it's not an abomination it's an
[46:59] abomination because god said not to do
[47:00] it not because society said not to do it
[47:02] at that time so with with men and women
[47:05] alike there are things that you cannot
[47:06] do and be in the will of god they just
[47:09] because of your gender in the scripture
[47:10] there are things we're not allowed to do
[47:11] and then there are things that we're
[47:12] supposed to do and we want to make sure
[47:14] that we don't step into those areas
[47:16] where he says don't do it because you're
[47:17] never in god's will to be outside of his
[47:19] word amen when he says don't do it we
[47:21] don't do it and we know for the sisters
[47:23] there was two things that they were not
[47:25] supposed to do that were major ones and
[47:27] this is uh paul of course taking this
[47:29] into the new testament church because as
[47:30] soon as we cross from from law into
[47:32] grace there's this tendency to start
[47:34] pushing away all of the things that you
[47:36] used to do right well it's a new it's a
[47:38] new covenant covenant we're in a new
[47:40] place he says there's neither male nor
[47:41] female bond or free you know june or
[47:44] greek none of these things so all of
[47:45] this has gone away and paul comes back
[47:46] and says no no no we're still in sin
[47:49] even though we're under the blood even
[47:50] though we have the the spirit of christ
[47:52] in us yet there are still positions and
[47:55] places for men and women to hold inside
[47:57] the body and we've got to make sure we
[47:58] don't cross that over amen no matter
[48:00] what we're under amen so we saw the
[48:02] first thing that they were not supposed
[48:03] to do was teach and that word teaches
[48:06] meaning to what handle the word of god
[48:08] in an instructive manner
[48:10] now that's meaning formally and
[48:12] informally but the big focus is on the
[48:14] formal side of things so they're not
[48:15] supposed to sit down and teach a class
[48:17] where they are handling the word they're
[48:19] not supposed to get up on the platform
[48:21] they're not supposed to get behind a
[48:22] pulpit they're not supposed to go any of
[48:24] these places and teach amen as we read
[48:26] in second timothy 2 11 it says let the
[48:28] women learn in silence not just be in
[48:30] silence but they're to learn and they're
[48:32] supposed to stay quiet even with what
[48:33] they learn until they come to a place
[48:35] where they are given authority to speak
[48:37] now a woman is never given authority to
[48:39] speak behind the pulpit she's forbidden
[48:41] to do that but she's given authority to
[48:43] speak in other areas and places and ways
[48:46] as the ministry or as the elders of the
[48:48] church or as the brothers of the church
[48:49] or as her husband or her father
[48:51] depending on her age and marital
[48:53] status would give her but there are
[48:55] things she's never allowed to do and one
[48:56] of those is that a woman's never allowed
[48:58] to preach in the church it's absolutely
[49:00] forbidden to her right brother brahm
[49:02] says the reason why is because she
[49:04] persuaded adam out of the will of god
[49:06] and caused him to do something that he
[49:08] should not have done and by it caused
[49:09] death to the whole human race that's why
[49:12] the bible forbids her to teach or to
[49:14] preach or to handle god's word in any
[49:16] manner
[49:17] he says and if all this wasn't bad
[49:19] enough a whole lot of you he's speaking
[49:20] to women took the idea that you could
[49:22] invade the pulpits and the church
[49:24] offices that god reserved for men and
[49:26] men only he says oh i touched a sore
[49:28] spot then didn't i because he's what
[49:30] he's preaching in a place where you have
[49:32] women preachers you have women
[49:34] missionaries you had all these different
[49:35] things going on and they're sitting
[49:37] there and he's trying to get them back
[49:38] in alignment with the word the opening
[49:40] of the word was to get us in alignment
[49:41] with the word not to give us a head full
[49:43] of ideas and swell us up with the
[49:45] egotistical idea that we know everything
[49:47] and we have a great revelation but it
[49:48] was to restore us back to a life that
[49:50] could be lived by the word right because
[49:52] that would have been lost through all
[49:54] those years is they could no longer live
[49:55] the word because the word had been so
[49:57] polluted by the ministries of men and by
[49:59] denominations in these things
[50:01] he says well show me a pla one place in
[50:03] the bible where god ever ordained any
[50:05] woman to preach or take authority over a
[50:07] man and i will apologize for what i've
[50:09] said you can't find that i'm wrong i'm
[50:11] right for i stand with the word and in
[50:13] the word he says if you were spiritually
[50:16] rich you would know that is true that's
[50:17] a hard statement to say he says if
[50:19] you're spiritually rich you know that's
[50:21] true that is nothing true but the word
[50:23] paul said i suffer not a woman to teach
[50:25] nor to usurp authority over the men
[50:28] you can't possibly take a place amongst
[50:30] the fivefold ministry of ephesians 4 and
[50:32] not take authority over men sister you
[50:35] better listen to that word it was not
[50:37] the spirit of god manifesting in a
[50:39] spirit-filled life that told you to
[50:41] preach because the spirit and the word
[50:43] are one now he's pointing to five full
[50:45] ministries so it was not the the spirit
[50:47] of god manifesting in a spirit-filled
[50:49] life that told you to preach teach
[50:51] evangelize do missions work any of those
[50:53] things right fivefold ministry is
[50:55] exclusively for the men now you can
[50:57] support you can be in support right i am
[51:00] an assistant pastor i'm a minister my
[51:02] wife supports me in that role and she
[51:04] supports me very greatly but she never
[51:06] gets up here and speaks right it's a
[51:08] it's a more silent role
[51:10] critical but it's a silent role she's
[51:12] not in a speaking role she's in a living
[51:14] and supporting role
[51:15] he says they say the same thing so
[51:18] therefore somebody made a mistake
[51:20] somebody was fooled wake up before it's
[51:23] too late satan fooled eve your mother
[51:26] and he is fooling the daughters now he
[51:27] says may god help you
[51:30] so he he leaves no doubt there as to
[51:32] whether a woman can get up into a pulpit
[51:34] and preach teach evangelize go out in
[51:36] the world
[51:37] but the thing is as soon as they they
[51:39] say well i'm not in the pulpit then they
[51:40] start to think that they can do it but
[51:42] he says no no no you're taking a
[51:43] five-fold ministries position when you
[51:45] go out and preach teach evangelize or
[51:48] any one of these things you're not
[51:49] supposed to do it that is supposed to be
[51:51] for the men alone but a sister elsa
[51:53] asked me she said well your wife was on
[51:55] the plane and that man sat next to her
[51:57] and she told him the word of god
[51:59] isn't that wrong based on what you're
[52:01] saying and i said no no a woman is
[52:03] absolutely allowed to testify of what
[52:05] god has done she's allowed to give a
[52:06] testimony she's allowed to point to the
[52:09] scriptures if somebody comes to her and
[52:11] asks
[52:12] then she can answer but you'll notice my
[52:14] wife did not go up to him and say
[52:17] have you met the lord jesus christ have
[52:18] you accepted him as your savior did you
[52:20] know god sent a prophet malachi 4 and
[52:22] this agent did you know that the godhead
[52:24] is do you know what that means and have
[52:26] you heard of serpency she didn't do that
[52:28] did she he asked a question she
[52:30] responded to it and our sisters have
[52:31] that opportunity they can respond to a
[52:33] question that's been given to them amen
[52:35] but that doesn't mean again you answer
[52:37] that question you go out into a big
[52:38] forum and do it you answer one on one
[52:40] that's what you're supposed to do you're
[52:41] not supposed to go out to the world and
[52:43] answer the question you go answer the
[52:44] person that asked the question amen it's
[52:47] a one-on-one ministry for women if we
[52:48] wanted to put it that way it's not meant
[52:50] to be a group thing it's not meant to be
[52:52] a big thing it's supposed to be small
[52:54] specific and personal that's really what
[52:56] they're meant to be amen
[52:57] the second thing is brother brandon
[52:58] mentioned here she is not to usurp
[53:00] authority that means they're forbidden
[53:02] to take control over to direct or
[53:04] otherwise be the boss of men so they
[53:06] can't take that
[53:08] they can't take it but they can be given
[53:10] it and we're going to go into the
[53:11] scriptures tonight to see where they are
[53:12] given authority and you will literally
[53:14] see women bossing men around in the
[53:16] scripture with full scriptural authority
[53:18] with the full authority of god with the
[53:20] full authority of the prophet of the age
[53:21] or whatever it might be but they have to
[53:23] be given it they cannot presume to take
[53:25] it and that's the thing is that so often
[53:28] you think well i'm just going to do this
[53:29] so i'm just going to do that no you have
[53:31] to be given authority to do it and you
[53:33] have to be given authority by the
[53:34] headship that has authority over that in
[53:36] the first place because sometimes what
[53:38] you do is you'll go find a brother
[53:40] you'll go find somebody and say can i do
[53:41] this and they say yes and they have no
[53:43] authority over what you're talking about
[53:44] you've got to go to the authority over
[53:46] that and say can i do it and that
[53:48] authority is not god
[53:50] god has put men in those positions to
[53:52] guard those positions in those places
[53:54] and so only that man is supposed to give
[53:55] it to you because otherwise what you'll
[53:57] get is men doing exactly what brother
[53:58] brown said well god told me to do it the
[54:00] holy spirit told me to do it listen if
[54:02] you're bypassing the authority that god
[54:04] has put in place then god can't god
[54:05] can't be doing saying two things at one
[54:07] time one of you is wrong and brother
[54:08] brahm says sister somebody's made a
[54:10] mistake somebody was fooled satan fooled
[54:12] your mother eve and he's fooling her you
[54:14] his daughters now i mean that's hard to
[54:17] say that's hard to say but we're seeing
[54:18] especially in this age of social media
[54:21] where we're seeing sisters get into that
[54:22] place and they're literally stepping
[54:24] into a five-fold ministry position
[54:25] without realizing it why because satan
[54:27] has fooled them and they think that
[54:29] god's telling them to do it and it's
[54:30] satan every single time because they
[54:32] have no authority to speak to an open
[54:34] audience like that it is supposed to be
[54:36] specific one-on-one and in response to a
[54:38] request not in a ministry an outward
[54:40] ministry like that
[54:42] brother bram says this he says on over
[54:43] in second timothy the third chapter he
[54:45] said i suffer not a woman to teach her
[54:47] to usurp authority over man but to be in
[54:49] silence you see and it isn't right for
[54:51] the women to preach that's true now i
[54:53] know i've seen some women that were real
[54:55] preachers listen to this
[54:57] real preachers they could preach too
[54:59] like amy mcpherson and many of those
[55:01] women there
[55:03] now if you stop there you get in trouble
[55:06] he says but put your hand on them just
[55:08] for a little what's he saying he's
[55:09] saying still them for a moment
[55:11] see how they respond
[55:14] he said i know people could speak with
[55:16] tongues this morning sitting right in
[55:18] this church if that but if there is no
[55:20] interpreter there dare not do so see you
[55:23] got to remember them women was born
[55:25] under a certain line your birth has a
[55:27] lot to do with it it's your name it's
[55:29] all about you you see you have a makeup
[55:31] to it no matter what it is so he says
[55:34] these things follow families often times
[55:37] or bloodlines or ministries follow
[55:40] through the father and the daughter can
[55:41] get a taste of that and she thinks that
[55:43] she's called to minister because why
[55:45] there's a gift sitting there and he says
[55:47] listen there's people in this church
[55:48] could stand up right now and speak in
[55:50] tongues because they have a gift but
[55:52] because they keep the gift in order he
[55:54] says they dare not do it unless there
[55:56] was an interpreter here
[55:58] right the gift is there but they're only
[56:00] supposed to use it in a certain way and
[56:01] at a certain time listen this this was
[56:04] an interesting thing he says i could get
[56:05] out here and pull a trigger on a gun and
[56:07] kill a man this morning but i dare not
[56:09] do it
[56:10] i was talking to a brother in this
[56:11] church one time and he was down the
[56:13] states and of course in the states you
[56:14] know everybody's got a gun
[56:16] you know he was talking to a brother and
[56:18] the brother said sure if any man came
[56:19] after my my wife my kids i'd shoot him
[56:21] dead
[56:22] he's prepared he's he's got a nature and
[56:25] he's got a willingness to commit
[56:26] violence for the sake of his family even
[56:28] to the point of taking a man's life now
[56:30] some of us can't do that and some of us
[56:32] can and brother braham says i'm one of
[56:34] those guys that could take a man's life
[56:35] if i had to
[56:37] that's the prophet of god that's malachi
[56:38] 4 telling you i could have no problem
[56:41] killing a man today amen he says but i
[56:44] dare not do it
[56:46] why because he's not supposed to do it
[56:48] the ability to do it the there's men
[56:51] that are gifted in killing you see it in
[56:53] wars you see these men you see
[56:55] alvin york didn't want to kill but when
[56:56] killing had to be done who got it done
[56:59] alvin york and you see these men that
[57:01] did great feats of they were by nature
[57:04] quiet unassuming men in many cases but
[57:06] the minute that bravery was called for
[57:08] the the minute that violence was called
[57:10] for to right or wrong what did they do
[57:12] they stepped into violence willingly and
[57:14] they committed acts of great violence
[57:15] and they committed death
[57:17] on people because the situation
[57:18] warranted it they had an ability to step
[57:21] into that and then step right back out
[57:22] and move on with life so brother i'm
[57:24] saying he says i have the ability to
[57:26] kill a person and not sit there and
[57:28] worry about it too much it ran in his
[57:30] life and we remember you see when he
[57:31] tells his testimony how many times did
[57:33] he try and kill somebody
[57:34] right he was going to kill that's what
[57:36] he's saying is i have that ability in my
[57:38] carnal flesh i have the ability to do
[57:40] something he says but i dare not do it
[57:43] he says but i can do it all right sure
[57:46] he says i could kill a man the same as
[57:48] you could kill a squirrel but you ain't
[57:49] supposed to do that
[57:51] see that's the same thing you've got to
[57:53] watch those things
[57:55] now that you do not he says this is the
[57:58] commandments of the lord so so often the
[58:00] the struggle is that we're capable we're
[58:02] capable of doing this and you'll see
[58:03] this in families guess what chances are
[58:06] if the father is a speaker then everyone
[58:08] else there's going to be a couple in the
[58:09] family that are going to be good
[58:10] speakers as well but that doesn't make
[58:12] you a preacher whether you're a man and
[58:14] especially if you're not a woman the
[58:15] ability to speak is not what makes you a
[58:17] preacher you know what makes you a
[58:18] preacher what makes you a creature a
[58:20] preacher is the ability to catch the
[58:23] thought of god and bring it to the
[58:25] people and set everything else aside
[58:27] right it's to catch the thought of god
[58:29] and leave yourself out of it that's what
[58:30] makes you a preacher it is not the
[58:32] ability to speak well it is not the the
[58:34] ability to rightly divide the word is
[58:36] not the ability to memorize scripture
[58:37] it's not the ability to get up and
[58:39] inspire
[58:40] it is to take the word of god to catch
[58:42] it and take it to the people that's all
[58:45] that's all a a real preacher is as he
[58:47] can catch the mind of god set himself
[58:49] aside enough that god could speak and he
[58:52] could bring it to the people that's what
[58:53] makes him it's not the greatest speaker
[58:55] our prophet was not a great speaker
[58:57] looking on him carnally you know you
[58:59] compare him to somebody like barack
[59:00] obama perhaps the greatest speaker of
[59:02] the modern presidency in the last five
[59:04] or 10 or 20 years right
[59:06] barack obama could certainly preach a
[59:08] sermon but he couldn't preach a sermon
[59:10] could he why no inspiration he couldn't
[59:12] catch the mind of god but he could
[59:14] deliver a great sermon i guarantee you
[59:16] if he put his mind and his gift to it
[59:18] right brother brown says just because
[59:19] you think you have a capability does not
[59:21] make you
[59:22] somebody that's supposed to be in that
[59:24] position any more than having a hockey
[59:25] stick makes you a great hockey player
[59:27] right having the tool doesn't make you
[59:28] there right doesn't make you wayne
[59:30] gretzky just because you got wayne
[59:31] gretzky's stick right wayne gretzky was
[59:34] wayne gretzky and there's never going to
[59:35] be another one like him
[59:37] right so these sisters they can't teach
[59:39] which is preach which is step into a
[59:41] five-fold ministry position and they
[59:43] can't usurp authority over men now those
[59:45] are two massive massive barriers in our
[59:47] sisters lives that's a tough thing to
[59:49] say to a sister that you can't do that
[59:50] because in this world they're screaming
[59:52] the exact opposite of that day in and
[59:54] day out day in and day out but remember
[59:57] it has nothing to do with capability
[59:59] sisters maybe that's a something that
[1:00:01] that can help you is it has nothing to
[1:00:02] do with whether or not you're good or
[1:00:04] bad at something
[1:00:05] but that's a comfort because you're
[1:00:06] going to be asked to do things you're
[1:00:07] not good at and you're going to be asked
[1:00:09] to do things you are good at right nuts
[1:00:11] brothers are the same it's not all fun
[1:00:12] and games being in the position of total
[1:00:14] responsibility is it brothers there's
[1:00:16] times where we probably wish we could
[1:00:17] sit back and let somebody else make the
[1:00:18] hard decision take the fall if the
[1:00:20] decision's wrong carry the burden
[1:00:22] shoulder that burden instead of us but
[1:00:24] we have to do it because the scripture
[1:00:26] tells us to do it not because we're
[1:00:27] always feeling capable or we always know
[1:00:29] the right thing to do right we've got to
[1:00:31] be willing to take the fall and trust
[1:00:32] romans 8 28 that he'll work it out for
[1:00:34] our good even when we mess up
[1:00:36] right so our sisters have to have grace
[1:00:38] because they're working with fallen men
[1:00:39] just as we're working with fallen women
[1:00:41] and so we're both trying to work
[1:00:42] together to come out to a godly response
[1:00:44] and all of these things amen amen
[1:00:47] so what brother branham has said here
[1:00:48] and what the scripture says scripture
[1:00:50] says is for a woman
[1:00:52] formally informally it doesn't matter
[1:00:54] when you start to handle the word of god
[1:00:56] then you're off the word
[1:00:57] in an instructive manner that's the
[1:00:59] that's the the big line that we've got
[1:01:01] to put them there and if we take it to
[1:01:03] revelations
[1:01:05] it shows the end result of a woman that
[1:01:07] does that and this is revelation 2 20 it
[1:01:09] says notwithstanding i have a few things
[1:01:11] against thee because thou sufferest that
[1:01:14] means you allow you permit you don't
[1:01:16] restrain and you let them alone because
[1:01:19] you suffer that woman jezebel which
[1:01:22] calleth herself a prophetess
[1:01:24] she calls herself a prophetess didn't
[1:01:25] say she was says she calls herself one
[1:01:28] you let her get away with it she's off
[1:01:30] the word and says what did she do with
[1:01:32] it you allow her to teach now that's the
[1:01:35] exact same word that paul used there
[1:01:37] that we read in timothy to say that
[1:01:38] women aren't allowed to do it he says
[1:01:40] you've let her do what i told you not to
[1:01:42] do
[1:01:43] he says and she's doing what she's going
[1:01:46] to teach and to seduce so she's going to
[1:01:48] deceive she's going to lead astray she's
[1:01:50] going to cause you to wander she's going
[1:01:52] to lead you away from the right
[1:01:54] that's what that's word seduce means so
[1:01:56] to seduce my servants to commit
[1:01:58] fornication that's both physical and
[1:02:00] natural evidence of the natural sin
[1:02:02] remember of the first sin what did eve
[1:02:04] do it was spiritual sin first and it was
[1:02:07] physical sin next right it was unbelief
[1:02:09] that was followed by a physical
[1:02:10] manifestation of that very thing
[1:02:12] so this is the end result as i've said
[1:02:14] before this is the end result of eve's
[1:02:16] ministry if she wasn't put in subjection
[1:02:19] because satan took what a church
[1:02:21] denomination a woman and he brought her
[1:02:23] all the way to this and this is what
[1:02:25] that ministry looks like this is a
[1:02:26] woman's ministry taken to its full
[1:02:27] fruition
[1:02:28] it says causes my servants and to seduce
[1:02:31] my servants to commit fornication and to
[1:02:33] eat things sacrificed to idols that's
[1:02:35] spiritual fornication right where you
[1:02:38] what get off the word of god for the
[1:02:39] sake of what makes you feel good for the
[1:02:41] thing that makes sense to you for the
[1:02:43] thing that is bringing you ease of life
[1:02:44] whatever these different things
[1:02:46] but the thing is he says
[1:02:48] she calls herself a prophetess
[1:02:50] but there is a prophetess in scripture
[1:02:53] there's more than one amen it's not that
[1:02:54] you can't be a woman and be a prophetess
[1:02:56] but it was what this woman did as a
[1:02:58] prophetess that took her into trouble
[1:03:01] because you can be a prophetess in the
[1:03:02] scripture we're going to talk about a
[1:03:04] couple of them brother brahm says this
[1:03:05] now then the circumcision of the old
[1:03:07] testament was in the flesh but in this
[1:03:09] new testament joel said i'll pour out my
[1:03:11] spirit upon all flesh and your sons and
[1:03:13] your daughters shall prophesy now the
[1:03:15] word prophesy does not mean to teach so
[1:03:18] he's saying this is not in contradiction
[1:03:19] to what paul has told us in timothy
[1:03:22] that prophesy means to either tell an
[1:03:24] experience under inspiration or foretell
[1:03:27] something that's fixing to take place
[1:03:29] and we know there were prophetesses in
[1:03:30] the old testament they never could speak
[1:03:33] out in the building speak out in the
[1:03:35] church in the congregation as a teacher
[1:03:38] but she anna and many of them in the
[1:03:39] temple they were prophetesses and miriam
[1:03:42] was a prophetess or something like that
[1:03:44] listen to this she had the spirit on her
[1:03:48] that's true but she had her limitations
[1:03:50] of place
[1:03:51] women can be prophetesses today
[1:03:54] absolutely but not teachers and so forth
[1:03:57] behind the platform so he's absolutely
[1:03:59] same five full ministry that's men only
[1:04:02] you do he says you make the bible
[1:04:04] contradict itself the bible can say one
[1:04:06] thing here and another thing over here
[1:04:08] it's got to say the same thing all the
[1:04:09] time or it isn't the word of god see
[1:04:11] your sons and daughters shall prophesy
[1:04:14] means they shall either foretell or
[1:04:15] testify he says now you look that up and
[1:04:17] you get the bible dictionary and see if
[1:04:19] that isn't right so the scripture
[1:04:20] doesn't forbid a woman to be spiritual
[1:04:22] praise the lord
[1:04:24] right
[1:04:25] this is this is where that there's
[1:04:26] neither bond or greek male or female
[1:04:28] junior or you know bond or free june or
[1:04:31] greek and these things it doesn't forbid
[1:04:32] women to be spiritual and we'll get into
[1:04:34] what brother branham says here about
[1:04:35] women
[1:04:37] they are often more spiritual
[1:04:41] right men put on our humble hats this
[1:04:42] evening they are oft times more
[1:04:44] spiritual
[1:04:45] the problem is that sensitivity to
[1:04:47] spirituality means that they are
[1:04:48] sensitive to any kind of spirit not just
[1:04:50] the holy spirit so if they're under the
[1:04:52] influence of the holy spirit oftentimes
[1:04:54] they can lead in understanding and
[1:04:56] feeling what's going on
[1:04:58] but that they've got to be careful
[1:04:59] because they can be fooled the other way
[1:05:01] just as easily as eve was amen
[1:05:03] but what women are absolutely allowed to
[1:05:06] have all of the gifts as in the gifts of
[1:05:08] the spirit
[1:05:09] right they are allowed to use those
[1:05:11] gifts within the tabernacle within the
[1:05:13] church within the congregation but as
[1:05:15] with men they have to be proven
[1:05:17] right they don't just get to get up and
[1:05:18] start doing things remember brother
[1:05:20] branham talked about every time he'd go
[1:05:22] to finish a service and he'd go to call
[1:05:23] the people up this woman kept standing
[1:05:25] up and she was speaking in tongues right
[1:05:28] and he says you watched her and he said
[1:05:29] you'd watch her and she'd start getting
[1:05:30] her clothes ready and everything like
[1:05:32] that he says what was it that wasn't the
[1:05:34] holy spirit that was a gift but she
[1:05:36] wasn't keeping it subject to the order
[1:05:38] of the word and he says she went to get
[1:05:41] up and he said sit down
[1:05:43] i think he said he might have even said
[1:05:44] shut up he said sit down and shut up why
[1:05:47] because she was getting out of the order
[1:05:49] of the service she had a gift he never
[1:05:51] disputed that but he says you've been
[1:05:52] taught wrong and you think that you just
[1:05:55] to get up and do that and you're
[1:05:56] interfering with the movie the holy
[1:05:57] spirit he said she did it for service
[1:05:59] after service after service until he had
[1:06:01] to intervene and say you're out of order
[1:06:02] sister but she had a gift
[1:06:05] right and they saw this hey this is not
[1:06:06] exclusive to women how many times did
[1:06:08] men get up and they get up and they
[1:06:09] prophesy in the middle of a church
[1:06:10] service or something brother brown says
[1:06:12] you're not supposed to interrupt the
[1:06:13] going forth of the word right so all of
[1:06:16] those gifts have to be subject but they
[1:06:17] are absolutely available to anyone in
[1:06:20] the church male or female
[1:06:22] women are supposed to be spiritual
[1:06:24] you're a member of the bride of christ
[1:06:25] we're all supposed to be spiritual it's
[1:06:27] not exclusive to men and i think
[1:06:28] sometimes we've forgotten that in the
[1:06:29] message is that women are supposed to be
[1:06:31] as spiritual as the men
[1:06:33] just in a different way and in a
[1:06:34] different position but they're supposed
[1:06:35] to be spiritual
[1:06:36] because why we're all going in a rapture
[1:06:39] right that sister sitting next to you is
[1:06:40] supposed to be just as spiritual as you
[1:06:42] are supposed to have the holy ghost the
[1:06:43] same as you are supposed to be led by
[1:06:44] the holy spirit same as you are so we
[1:06:46] don't want to limit them in those things
[1:06:48] right
[1:06:49] but here's the thing they have to be
[1:06:51] proven and the proving of that is when
[1:06:53] they do what they don't use that gift
[1:06:55] for themselves that's what that sister
[1:06:56] was doing in brother graham's meeting
[1:06:57] where she was making a show of herself
[1:06:59] she was getting her clothes ready she
[1:07:00] wanted to look perfect she wanted to
[1:07:02] stand up and put on a show
[1:07:04] it wasn't for the sake of the people it
[1:07:05] was for the sake of her so what is it a
[1:07:07] person doesn't use their gifts to
[1:07:09] promote themselves but what do they do
[1:07:10] they humbly present themselves to god
[1:07:13] and then god inspires the use of that
[1:07:15] gift in their life for the benefit of
[1:07:17] the body not for the benefit of
[1:07:19] themselves look at jesus when did jesus
[1:07:21] ever use his gift for himself
[1:07:23] he didn't he used it for somebody else
[1:07:25] every single time brother branham how
[1:07:26] many times was brother branham sick did
[1:07:28] brother brown lay hands on himself did
[1:07:29] brother brown declare himself to be
[1:07:31] healed did brother brown claim the gift
[1:07:33] of faith and say i'm healed he had to go
[1:07:35] through that battle the same as
[1:07:36] everybody else did because it was for us
[1:07:39] not for him amen same thing now brother
[1:07:42] brahm says this he's talking about women
[1:07:44] being spiritually he says anyhow women
[1:07:46] is real receptive to spirits
[1:07:48] have you ever noticed in the service a
[1:07:50] lot of times who goes off first
[1:07:52] the sisters
[1:07:53] right they'll start worshiping they'll
[1:07:55] start crying they'll start shouting
[1:07:56] they'll start shrieking they'll start
[1:07:58] yelling they'll stop praising the lord
[1:07:59] speaking in tongues even a lot of times
[1:08:01] who is at first it's the women because
[1:08:03] it says there he says they're real
[1:08:05] receptive to spirits plural
[1:08:08] that's the flip side
[1:08:10] any spirit not just the holy spirit he
[1:08:13] says and then if you don't watch he says
[1:08:14] watch who the mediums are on the street
[1:08:16] it's madame so-and-so see you know you
[1:08:18] get these women with a familiar spirit
[1:08:20] or the you know fortune tellers and
[1:08:21] these different things he says but then
[1:08:23] the gospel should keep the women lined
[1:08:25] up and in her place see so then she's
[1:08:27] but she's more receptive to the spirit
[1:08:29] many times than men are and if you look
[1:08:32] in the scripture how many times do you
[1:08:33] see women catching something when the
[1:08:35] men are completely oblivious to it
[1:08:37] right how many times do you see jesus
[1:08:39] coming to a woman
[1:08:41] out of out of what we would consider her
[1:08:43] place going to a woman that's of ill
[1:08:45] repute and these different things and
[1:08:46] knowing that they were going to catch
[1:08:48] who he was that's why god sends them to
[1:08:50] those that's why he was led to those
[1:08:52] women was because they would catch it
[1:08:54] amen you look at mary of bethesda she
[1:08:56] was the one caught in adultery with the
[1:08:58] men they picked on her they let the man
[1:09:00] go
[1:09:01] right
[1:09:03] makes me wonder if they didn't know the
[1:09:04] man
[1:09:06] you know we don't know the scripture
[1:09:07] side i really want to ask that one when
[1:09:09] we get over to heaven lord what two
[1:09:11] things who is the man as in was he
[1:09:14] somebody that was known or did they let
[1:09:15] him go because they didn't want to you
[1:09:16] know get him in trouble and two what did
[1:09:18] you write in the stock right in the in
[1:09:20] the dirt there because whatever it is he
[1:09:22] wrote and then he said let he that's
[1:09:24] without sin cast the first stone
[1:09:25] whatever it was caused the oldest to the
[1:09:27] youngest to turn away and not throw a
[1:09:28] thing but maria bethesda she should have
[1:09:30] been stoned and she recognized not only
[1:09:33] who he was but she recognized where he
[1:09:35] was going which was to his death and she
[1:09:38] anointed his feet and meanwhile peter
[1:09:40] the one that has the great revelation is
[1:09:42] saying lord forbid this have ever
[1:09:44] happened and jesus says get thee behind
[1:09:46] me satan that's right a a prostitute if
[1:09:49] we want to call that have more spiritual
[1:09:51] discernment than peter the man that's
[1:09:53] going to speak on the day of pentecost
[1:09:55] right
[1:09:56] the woman with the issue of blood walks
[1:09:58] up and all she says in her mind is if i
[1:10:01] can but touch him i'll be made whole she
[1:10:03] touches him and she walks away and he
[1:10:05] stops and says virtue's gone out of me
[1:10:08] how many men touched him that day how
[1:10:09] many people touched him that day but it
[1:10:11] was a woman that came up and touched him
[1:10:14] that's right she knew who he was she
[1:10:17] believed on it and she acted on it amen
[1:10:20] what do we have the woman at the well
[1:10:22] this is a woman of ill fame five
[1:10:23] husbands the sixth man she's living with
[1:10:25] is not her own husband she comes to the
[1:10:27] well he talks to a woman that is a
[1:10:29] samaritan first shouldn't have even been
[1:10:32] talking to her by cultural standards and
[1:10:34] then two she's an outcast woman two
[1:10:36] strikes against her
[1:10:38] and he talks to her and in a short
[1:10:41] conversation she catches what the
[1:10:43] priests and pharisees call the devil was
[1:10:45] actually the messiah
[1:10:47] why
[1:10:48] she was receptive to the holy spirit
[1:10:51] there was something there that resonated
[1:10:53] in her and she caught it when a man that
[1:10:55] has studied the scriptures like caiaphas
[1:10:57] would stand there and call him a
[1:10:58] blasphemer because he couldn't recognize
[1:11:01] who he was look at anna the prophetess
[1:11:03] okay here's a woman that's a prophetess
[1:11:06] by inspiration she catches who this baby
[1:11:09] is he's not even doing anything he's
[1:11:11] laying in his blankets and his mama's
[1:11:12] arms going goo gaga and she says this is
[1:11:15] the messiah
[1:11:16] why she was sensitive to the moving of
[1:11:18] the holy spirit she was led to go there
[1:11:21] that day to see that baby and recognize
[1:11:23] that this is a messiah and it was a
[1:11:25] fulfillment of what the desire of her
[1:11:27] heart to see him
[1:11:28] an amazing thing right look at this
[1:11:30] syrophoenician woman needing healing for
[1:11:33] her daughter
[1:11:34] she goes up and what does he do he calls
[1:11:36] her a dog
[1:11:38] today's sisters today brothers i don't
[1:11:40] care what gender you are if you went up
[1:11:42] to somebody that you believe was
[1:11:44] spiritual and they called you a dog what
[1:11:45] would you do
[1:11:47] how many of us would respond the way she
[1:11:49] did but she knowing and believing who he
[1:11:52] was she humbled herself under his
[1:11:55] offensive comment and said yay lord
[1:11:57] because he said what she wanted healing
[1:11:58] he says it's not me to give the
[1:12:00] children's bread to the dogs
[1:12:02] called her a dog
[1:12:04] and she says yay lord but the dogs still
[1:12:06] eat the crumbs from off the table
[1:12:08] why she knew who she was talking to and
[1:12:11] she was willing to do whatever it took
[1:12:12] to get healing for her daughter and what
[1:12:14] did he do that very hour her daughter
[1:12:16] was healed amen why they were receptive
[1:12:19] to what the moving of the spirit they
[1:12:21] were receptive to the word of god amen
[1:12:24] but what those gifts and that deserving
[1:12:26] sisters doesn't pull you out from under
[1:12:28] scriptural headshit
[1:12:30] right
[1:12:31] and we've seen it and i've known women
[1:12:33] that have great spiritual gifts great
[1:12:35] insight great wisdom but it can't pull
[1:12:37] you out from the word authority that
[1:12:38] you're put under and that is your
[1:12:40] husband or your father right if it pulls
[1:12:42] you out then it's not the holy spirit
[1:12:44] doing it and it can't be amen
[1:12:46] no matter the gift you imagine i don't
[1:12:48] believe we have a prophetess in here at
[1:12:50] least not yet but if you ever get that
[1:12:52] spirit on you it does not allow you to
[1:12:54] step outside of the word it will always
[1:12:56] bring you to the word amen and it will
[1:12:58] never cause you to take authority to
[1:12:59] yourself that isn't given you
[1:13:01] amen now we're going to start walking
[1:13:03] through a couple of these and this is
[1:13:05] all for sister elsa these were my notes
[1:13:06] from from previous but sister elsa
[1:13:08] listen up closely this is for you amen
[1:13:10] so we're going to start with miriam a
[1:13:12] prophetess so this is proving that women
[1:13:13] can have spiritual gifts old testament
[1:13:15] and new right so if we look in exodus 15
[1:13:18] it says then saying moses and the
[1:13:20] children of israel this song unto the
[1:13:21] lord and spake saying i will sing unto
[1:13:24] the lord for he hath try and triumph
[1:13:26] gloriously the horse and his rider has
[1:13:28] he thrown into the sea
[1:13:30] now i want you to see who who started
[1:13:32] this worship this is not in the
[1:13:33] congregation they're standing on the on
[1:13:35] the banks of the red sea but who starts
[1:13:37] it the prophet of god
[1:13:39] moses starts it the people join in but
[1:13:41] then what happens
[1:13:43] miriam didn't jump up front and start
[1:13:45] the worship
[1:13:47] a man started it
[1:13:49] but what happens is miriam gets under
[1:13:51] the anointing of worship and all of a
[1:13:53] sudden what does she do it says and
[1:13:55] miriam the prophetess the sister of
[1:13:57] aaron took a timbrel in her hand and all
[1:13:59] the women went out after her with
[1:14:01] timbrels and with dances so brother bram
[1:14:03] says she got in the spirit
[1:14:06] right this isn't in the congregation
[1:14:07] she's not out of order they are
[1:14:10] literally outside and something happens
[1:14:12] and miriam says i gotta worship. brother
[1:14:14] brown puts it this way he says after the
[1:14:16] taskmasters had drowned moses got in the
[1:14:18] spirit that was to start it
[1:14:20] then miriam got in the spirit and miriam
[1:14:22] grabbed a tambourine and down the bank
[1:14:24] she went a beating this tambourine and
[1:14:26] dancing did you ever hear of such and
[1:14:28] down the banks she went beating the
[1:14:29] tambourine dancing and here come the
[1:14:31] daughters of israel following her
[1:14:33] dancing and moses got in the spirit and
[1:14:36] began to sing a song in the spirit
[1:14:38] brother he says if that's not an
[1:14:39] old-fashioned holy ghost meeting i've
[1:14:41] never seen one in my life
[1:14:43] but what it's in a proper place she's
[1:14:46] not leading the congregation out in the
[1:14:48] church she's leading them outside the
[1:14:49] church she's responding in spontaneous
[1:14:52] worship to an event that's happened
[1:14:53] there amen amen and it's what the spirit
[1:14:56] of worship on miriam and brother braham
[1:14:57] says that was the holy spirit falling on
[1:14:59] her that caused her to do that right she
[1:15:01] had to express it moses never forbade
[1:15:03] her and said hey you're a woman you're
[1:15:04] not allowed to do that
[1:15:06] what they all followed and all the women
[1:15:08] followed after her and they had a
[1:15:10] wonderful time on the banks of the red
[1:15:11] sea
[1:15:12] right
[1:15:13] but i want you to catch something here
[1:15:14] because it's an important lesson in
[1:15:16] headship because as far as we know
[1:15:17] miriam never married you'll see there
[1:15:19] that it said that it was miriam the
[1:15:21] sister of aaron it did not say the
[1:15:24] daughter of a man which means that the
[1:15:25] father and mother were probably dead at
[1:15:26] that point and she's never listed as
[1:15:28] having a husband
[1:15:30] and so i want you to catch something
[1:15:31] here because she lacked one of the
[1:15:32] scriptural boundaries or barriers that
[1:15:34] would have kept her from getting into
[1:15:36] trouble and that was a husband or a
[1:15:37] father that was still alive in numbers
[1:15:40] 12 it says emiriam and aaron spoke
[1:15:41] against moses because of the ethiopian
[1:15:44] woman whom he had married for he had
[1:15:46] married an ethiopian woman now notice
[1:15:48] who speaks out just miriam no her and
[1:15:52] aaron both speak out
[1:15:54] against the prophet of god
[1:15:56] and they said had the lord indeed spoken
[1:15:58] only by moses had not had he not spoken
[1:16:02] also by us
[1:16:03] and the lord heard it you never you see
[1:16:07] these things uh those of you that aren't
[1:16:08] on social media won't see it but you
[1:16:09] have these things that says only god can
[1:16:11] judge me
[1:16:12] this is what only god can judge me looks
[1:16:14] like here it says and the lord heard it
[1:16:16] amen what motivated their comments about
[1:16:18] his wife though it was that they had an
[1:16:21] inferiority complex or they were unhappy
[1:16:23] with how much god was using moses as
[1:16:25] compared to them or how much recognition
[1:16:27] moses got as opposed to them
[1:16:29] they spoke against moses and his wife
[1:16:31] but the root of it was they said didn't
[1:16:33] god doesn't god use us as well
[1:16:35] that was the root so they're saying one
[1:16:37] thing but the root is something
[1:16:38] completely different and they said
[1:16:40] aren't we the same as moses
[1:16:42] don't we have the same rights don't we
[1:16:44] have the same recognition
[1:16:46] and it's not true was it
[1:16:48] it says now mo the man moses was very
[1:16:50] meek above all the men which were upon
[1:16:52] the face of the earth moses wrote that
[1:16:53] about himself
[1:16:55] under inspiration
[1:16:57] and the lord spake suddenly unto moses
[1:16:59] god dropped down boom moses we got
[1:17:02] something to deal with
[1:17:04] and under aaron and under miriam he said
[1:17:06] come out e3 into the tabernacle of the
[1:17:09] congregation and they three came out now
[1:17:11] lotus he brings them into the church
[1:17:13] into the congregation for one thing and
[1:17:15] what is that judgment
[1:17:17] amen when we come to church it's a
[1:17:18] serious thing because it is brother
[1:17:20] brahm says it is grace if you receive it
[1:17:22] and it's judgment if you don't and he
[1:17:24] brings them in he says you've got to
[1:17:25] stand in the church for this because
[1:17:27] this is a church matter that we're
[1:17:28] dealing with right it's not a joke when
[1:17:31] we come into service is it
[1:17:33] we can't take anything that comes over
[1:17:34] the pulpit lightly
[1:17:36] it says and the lord came down in the
[1:17:37] pillar of the cloud and stood in the
[1:17:39] door of the tabernacle and called aaron
[1:17:40] and miriam and they both came forth now
[1:17:43] here's the thing they said does not god
[1:17:44] speak through us now god's speaking to
[1:17:46] them
[1:17:47] that's a scary thing when god calls you
[1:17:49] in says now i'm going to speak to you
[1:17:50] but you're not going to like it so much.
[1:17:52] and he said hear now my words if there
[1:17:55] be a prophet among you i the lord will
[1:17:57] make myself known unto him in a vision
[1:17:59] and will speak unto him in a dream
[1:18:02] my moses my servant moses is not so who
[1:18:04] is faithful in all mine house with him
[1:18:07] will i speak mouth to mouth even
[1:18:09] apparently and not in dark speeches in
[1:18:11] the similitude of the lord shall he
[1:18:13] behold
[1:18:14] wherefore were ye not afraid to speak
[1:18:16] against my servant moses
[1:18:18] i cringe when i see what people say
[1:18:19] about ministry sometimes and again you
[1:18:21] see it mostly on social media but
[1:18:22] sometimes it's in conversation listen
[1:18:25] take a lesson from this you better watch
[1:18:27] out who you're talking to and who you're
[1:18:29] talking about because what the hope is
[1:18:31] that they won't respond
[1:18:33] right moses never called aaron and
[1:18:34] miriam and said hey i heard what you
[1:18:36] were talking about what is it god called
[1:18:38] them in and god dealt with them
[1:18:40] sometimes i think you'd be better off
[1:18:41] dealing with the men
[1:18:42] it's a scary thing amen but listen he
[1:18:45] says when i talk to moses you ever see
[1:18:48] even brother branham will say i'm seeing
[1:18:49] something and he'll say i don't know
[1:18:51] what it means remember how many times
[1:18:53] the brother himself have a dream or
[1:18:54] vision he'd say i'm not sure what it
[1:18:56] means i'm waiting for the lord to reveal
[1:18:57] it he says listen with moses that's how
[1:19:00] i deal with prophets
[1:19:01] he says with moses oh i'm different he
[1:19:03] says i speak mouth to mouth moses sees
[1:19:06] my mouth moving when i talk if we can
[1:19:07] put it that way he couldn't see the face
[1:19:09] he saw the similar tube but he said with
[1:19:11] moses there's no hidden things
[1:19:13] everything's obvious when i talk to him
[1:19:14] i make it very clear what i'm talking
[1:19:16] about moses doesn't have to wonder what
[1:19:18] i meant what i'm getting at where this
[1:19:20] is going when i'm done talking with him
[1:19:22] when i talk to moses everything is
[1:19:23] crystal clear and then he walks out and
[1:19:25] he gives you it why because moses was
[1:19:27] god to the people and he had to have
[1:19:29] clarity right he couldn't wonder about
[1:19:31] he had to get come out and speak as god
[1:19:33] to the people
[1:19:34] he says what this is a man that's
[1:19:36] different than any one of you you have
[1:19:38] gifts you have a gift of prophecy he
[1:19:41] says he's a prophet there's a difference
[1:19:43] between a gift of prophecy and a prophet
[1:19:45] he says he's a prophet i use you but
[1:19:47] he's in a position that you don't have
[1:19:49] anything close to amen right
[1:19:51] it says and the anger of the lord was
[1:19:53] kindled against them and he departed
[1:19:56] and the cloud departed from off the
[1:19:58] tabernacle and behold miriam became
[1:20:00] leprous
[1:20:01] while white as snow and aaron looked
[1:20:03] upon miriam and behold she was met she
[1:20:06] was leprous why only miriam why wasn't
[1:20:09] aaron struck
[1:20:10] aaron said the same things as miriam
[1:20:13] why is miriam the one that's leprous
[1:20:15] and aaron said unto moses i'll ask my
[1:20:17] lord i beseech thee lay not the sin upon
[1:20:19] us wherein we have done foolishly and
[1:20:22] wherein we have sinned aaron admitted
[1:20:23] hey we both did this isn't this wasn't
[1:20:25] miriam only this was both of us don't
[1:20:28] put it all on her
[1:20:30] says let her not be as one dead of whom
[1:20:32] the flesh is half consumed when he
[1:20:33] cometh out of his mother's womb and
[1:20:35] moses cried unto the lord saying heal
[1:20:37] her now oh god i beseech thee
[1:20:40] moses wasn't offended that's a beautiful
[1:20:41] thing
[1:20:42] right as men if you're in the ministry
[1:20:45] that's a beautiful thing to respond
[1:20:46] somebody starts to tear you down
[1:20:48] somebody starts to criticize you
[1:20:50] something's probably going to happen to
[1:20:51] them at some point they're going to wish
[1:20:52] they hadn't said it and our attitude
[1:20:54] want to be ought to be like christ was
[1:20:55] on the cross right father forgive them
[1:20:58] they didn't recognize what they were
[1:20:59] doing moses could have gone for the
[1:21:01] throat goodness said sorry had enough of
[1:21:04] you you're just like the rest miriam go
[1:21:06] ahead and die no he says lord i beseech
[1:21:08] you heal her
[1:21:09] right
[1:21:10] lay not the sin upon it oh sorry
[1:21:13] and the lord said unto moses if her
[1:21:14] father had but spit in her face should
[1:21:16] she not be ashamed seven days he said
[1:21:18] look what she did if she'd if her father
[1:21:20] had spit in her face she'd have been
[1:21:22] ashamed for seven days because of what
[1:21:24] he did to her and now she does the same
[1:21:26] thing to you
[1:21:27] he says she spit in your face is what
[1:21:29] she did he says therefore let her be
[1:21:31] shut out of the camp from the camp seven
[1:21:33] days and after that let her be received
[1:21:35] in again and miriam was shut out from
[1:21:37] the camp seven days and the people
[1:21:38] journeyed not till miriam was brought in
[1:21:40] again and you know what after this we
[1:21:41] don't see anything from miriam
[1:21:43] god never as far as we know as recorded
[1:21:45] in the scripture we see very little from
[1:21:47] miriam and she dies not long after this
[1:21:49] why because she got out of her position
[1:21:51] she got out of her place and we'll cover
[1:21:52] it a bit where brother brahm says he
[1:21:54] says and when they come in before god
[1:21:56] god said don't you fear god
[1:21:58] said that to the high priest and the
[1:21:59] miriam the prophetess said if there be
[1:22:01] any a man among you who's spiritual or
[1:22:03] prophet i the lord will make myself
[1:22:04] known to him i'll speak to him in
[1:22:06] visions reveal myself in dreams to him
[1:22:08] and so forth if he's a spiritual or a
[1:22:09] prophet but he said my my servant moses
[1:22:12] i speak lip to ear with him said don't
[1:22:14] you fear god
[1:22:15] in other words you talk about moses
[1:22:18] you're talking about me
[1:22:20] why moses was in the god position amen
[1:22:23] right aaron was moses prophet moses
[1:22:25] wasn't the prophet aaron was the prophet
[1:22:27] moses was god to the people he says
[1:22:29] you're talking about me if you can't
[1:22:31] respect moses you don't respect me
[1:22:34] ouch
[1:22:36] she didn't realize that did she
[1:22:39] said haven't i proved among you that
[1:22:40] he's my servant and you have no
[1:22:42] reverence for him at all
[1:22:44] what that would be for a lesson of be a
[1:22:47] lesson for the people of this day no
[1:22:49] respects no honor now he said and
[1:22:52] because you didn't do that that's the
[1:22:54] reason you got leprosy that's the reason
[1:22:57] these things has went said because you
[1:22:58] ought to have known that this was my
[1:23:00] servant you do know it so when you say
[1:23:03] something against him you're saying it
[1:23:05] against me what he said the problem was
[1:23:07] he says you didn't show respect and you
[1:23:08] didn't show honor and that's what got
[1:23:10] you in trouble
[1:23:12] he says but what he was trying to get to
[1:23:15] them was this you've got to respect what
[1:23:18] i do
[1:23:19] and that was the attitude of god in that
[1:23:20] day and god can't change god wants us to
[1:23:23] respect what he's doing he demands it
[1:23:25] said you either respect that or
[1:23:26] something else is going to happen
[1:23:28] so ask the question why miriam but not
[1:23:31] aaron
[1:23:32] they both said it they both discussed it
[1:23:33] they both did something they shouldn't
[1:23:35] but guess what aaron was in a position
[1:23:37] of spiritual authority
[1:23:39] didn't give him a right to do what he
[1:23:40] did but he had authority to speak
[1:23:43] miriam had no authority to speak unless
[1:23:45] she was speaking as thus saith the lord
[1:23:47] what happened was in her mind miriam
[1:23:49] said i'm a prophetess therefore i have a
[1:23:52] right to speak and she forgot that she
[1:23:55] was only supposed to speak as god moved
[1:23:57] her to speak she didn't have thus saith
[1:23:59] the lord but in her mind she got it
[1:24:00] flipped around to where she said i'm
[1:24:02] allowed to speak as a man would and god
[1:24:04] judged only her for it
[1:24:06] aaron was wrong but god judged miriam
[1:24:09] for it
[1:24:10] that's a scary place right
[1:24:12] what was it she was linking her gift of
[1:24:15] her gift which was of god to her
[1:24:17] comments and her right to comment which
[1:24:19] was not of god right she's a prophetess
[1:24:22] god comes to her and dreams and visions
[1:24:23] and tells her to say and do things and
[1:24:25] she does it and so she linked that to
[1:24:27] what she was saying and god said no no
[1:24:28] you're not allowed to do that you can't
[1:24:30] tie me in with what you say here because
[1:24:32] i didn't tell you to do it
[1:24:33] right
[1:24:34] god put moses in that place moses didn't
[1:24:36] choose it moses didn't want it moses was
[1:24:39] put in there by god god gave moses his
[1:24:41] wife she was a hot-tempered woman wasn't
[1:24:43] she but she saved his bacon as well
[1:24:45] didn't she when they're on the road to
[1:24:47] moses and she said thou bloody husband
[1:24:49] do i have to do this she circumcised the
[1:24:51] boys because he hadn't done it the angel
[1:24:52] of the lord would have killed him right
[1:24:54] god had given him a wife that he needed
[1:24:56] to keep him out of trouble to help them
[1:24:58] to help them
[1:24:59] right and they criticize that god says
[1:25:01] you're not allowed to do it especially
[1:25:02] to my prophet you've got to pay a price
[1:25:04] now you say brother jonathan you're
[1:25:06] picking on the women
[1:25:07] let me tell you what the prophet said i
[1:25:09] don't have to i feel i don't have to
[1:25:10] defend it this is brother branham now
[1:25:12] speaking of his own wife because
[1:25:13] remember he said her issue was one of
[1:25:15] what respect and honor
[1:25:18] there was something come up he's
[1:25:19] speaking of his wife and she was so
[1:25:21] nervous she could hardly hold herself
[1:25:22] together people at the house all night
[1:25:24] long and like night before last evening
[1:25:26] at one o'clock in the morning here were
[1:25:27] people in around the house around the
[1:25:29] windows and everything so then she was
[1:25:31] real nervous and she said something to
[1:25:32] me snappy that she ought to have said it
[1:25:36] see she said then bill you're always
[1:25:38] gone and i have to take care of these
[1:25:40] children myself
[1:25:42] she said you're never here we can't make
[1:25:44] our decisions together you're either out
[1:25:46] or gone and she started crying went in
[1:25:50] and shut the door now let me stop right
[1:25:52] there
[1:25:53] has anything that she said there
[1:25:56] factually incorrect
[1:25:58] is it wrong
[1:26:00] in terms of the facts of life their
[1:26:02] marriage the raising of kids has is
[1:26:04] there anything there that she said that
[1:26:06] was incorrect
[1:26:07] no brother branham was constantly gone
[1:26:09] brother bonham didn't get to be a father
[1:26:12] and a husband the way most of us men do
[1:26:14] why because he was always out preaching
[1:26:16] he had a call to go and preach the
[1:26:18] entire world he he was supposed to go
[1:26:20] around the world seven times he had to
[1:26:21] bring a gift of healing and these
[1:26:23] different things to the whole world that
[1:26:24] was his primary focus and so his wife
[1:26:27] all the pressure builds up on her and
[1:26:29] she snaps out but nothing she said is
[1:26:31] factually wrong he wasn't there she was
[1:26:34] under a lot of stress she was raising
[1:26:36] the kids by herself all these different
[1:26:37] things
[1:26:38] now watch how the prophet responds just
[1:26:40] like moses
[1:26:42] right then i said oh poor little fellow
[1:26:45] i said my i ought
[1:26:47] and i started out so he was just fine
[1:26:50] he's she's right he said you know poor
[1:26:52] thing she's just so so tired and so worn
[1:26:54] out now listen what it says he says and
[1:26:56] it said
[1:26:58] what's that the holy spirit
[1:27:00] read numbers 12. he says um
[1:27:03] he says
[1:27:05] a different one there i replaced that
[1:27:06] that's why i put it in brackets because
[1:27:08] he references the wrong the wrong book
[1:27:10] and wrong thing but it's read numbers
[1:27:11] 12. it says it was when miriam rebuked
[1:27:14] moses for marrying an ethiopian girl be
[1:27:16] better that her father had spit in her
[1:27:17] face and do this and i went back in and
[1:27:19] i said sweetheart you said the wrong
[1:27:21] thing
[1:27:22] and she was crying
[1:27:24] she had a right to cry
[1:27:26] right he's not saying you're wrong honey
[1:27:28] that that the words you're saying are
[1:27:30] incorrect he says but you said the wrong
[1:27:32] thing honey god is going to make you pay
[1:27:34] for that you shouldn't have done that
[1:27:36] i'm all tore up myself you shouldn't
[1:27:38] have said that and she said well bill i
[1:27:41] get so tore up
[1:27:42] and i just turned and walked back
[1:27:44] because i know she wasn't in any mood to
[1:27:46] receive it so i went back out and the
[1:27:48] next examination about a month after
[1:27:50] that showed the tumor
[1:27:52] what was it she criticized what a man in
[1:27:55] his ministry and god judged her for it
[1:27:58] even
[1:27:58] though he was exactly what she said
[1:28:02] never there didn't get to make any
[1:28:04] decisions with them can you imagine
[1:28:06] sisters you're trying to go to sleep and
[1:28:07] you got people coming in a house walking
[1:28:09] around you know the shadow crossing over
[1:28:11] your window and you're you know how
[1:28:13] horrible would that be cars going in and
[1:28:15] out doors closing you know perhaps
[1:28:17] people crying in in the living room
[1:28:19] while your husband's praying with them
[1:28:20] and talking to them these different
[1:28:21] things right just tearing up your life
[1:28:24] but what was it she
[1:28:26] she was led there god god gave her to
[1:28:29] brother branham as a wife and what
[1:28:31] happened was for one moment
[1:28:33] she got selfish
[1:28:35] that's all and she forgot that she had
[1:28:37] to respect that man in his position and
[1:28:39] god judged her for it because he said
[1:28:41] that's my prophet and you don't talk to
[1:28:43] my prophet that way
[1:28:44] he didn't correct her he just said you
[1:28:46] shouldn't have said it the way you said
[1:28:47] it you shouldn't have done that right
[1:28:49] what is it she made it about herself and
[1:28:51] god judged her for it that's what that's
[1:28:53] what miriam did she made it about
[1:28:54] herself does god not also use me does
[1:28:56] god not also care about me and then she
[1:28:58] said something she ought not to
[1:29:01] second first corinthians 14 says let
[1:29:03] your women keep silence in the churches
[1:29:05] for it is not permitted unto them to
[1:29:07] speak but they are commanded to be under
[1:29:08] obedience is also saith the law and if
[1:29:11] they will learn anything let them ask
[1:29:12] their husbands at home for it is a shame
[1:29:14] for women to speak in the church
[1:29:16] listen to this what came the word of god
[1:29:18] out from you or came unto you only isn't
[1:29:21] this the very thing that miriam was just
[1:29:22] saying doesn't god speak to us as well
[1:29:24] brothers shouldn't we be allowed to
[1:29:26] stand up and and preach and teach and
[1:29:28] say these things in the church he says
[1:29:29] no sisters you're not to do that you're
[1:29:31] not supposed to step into that he said
[1:29:33] he didn't say god doesn't come to you
[1:29:36] but he says that has nothing to do with
[1:29:37] it because that's the thing that got
[1:29:38] miriam in trouble if any man think
[1:29:40] himself to be a prophet or spiritual let
[1:29:42] him acknowledge that the things that are
[1:29:44] right unto you are the very commandments
[1:29:45] of the lord so paul ties the very
[1:29:47] attitude of miriam
[1:29:48] and aaron to the new testament church
[1:29:50] says women don't get under that and men
[1:29:53] don't do the same thing he says listen
[1:29:55] if you think you're spiritual then you
[1:29:56] better acknowledge me as the prophet of
[1:29:57] god and that what i say is true
[1:29:59] otherwise you have no standing in these
[1:30:00] churches because you're getting off the
[1:30:02] the inspired word amen
[1:30:04] and then he says what don't criticize
[1:30:06] because your gift isn't being used or
[1:30:08] because your gift is not yet apparent
[1:30:10] remember brother branham says you know
[1:30:12] that they had that ministers meeting and
[1:30:13] they were going to set a trap and they
[1:30:14] were going to they're going to try and
[1:30:16] get them on godhead i believe it was
[1:30:17] right and what did he say he says i told
[1:30:19] him he says if you can't if you what do
[1:30:22] you say he says if you can't help me
[1:30:24] then keep off my back right he says get
[1:30:26] off my back and let me do it if you're
[1:30:28] not gonna if you're not gonna stand up
[1:30:29] here and correct me and you can't
[1:30:30] correct me then get off my back and let
[1:30:32] me do the job that god called me to do
[1:30:33] that's right right
[1:30:34] what's he saying don't hold me back
[1:30:36] because you're jealous
[1:30:37] right
[1:30:38] get out of my way let me let me keep
[1:30:40] working and then you can do what you
[1:30:41] want to do when god starts using you
[1:30:43] right
[1:30:44] amen
[1:30:46] you don't want to start criticizing
[1:30:47] someone that's doing a work for god now
[1:30:48] let me stop there and say this sisters
[1:30:50] that doesn't mean you're not allowed to
[1:30:51] express frustration
[1:30:53] doesn't mean you're not allowed to say
[1:30:55] that you're unhappy it's not that you're
[1:30:56] not allowed to share these things with
[1:30:58] your husband
[1:30:59] right but there's a way to do it isn't
[1:31:01] there and us men guess what the first
[1:31:04] sign of trouble is usually with our wife
[1:31:05] because why she's a reflection of us and
[1:31:08] our life and the way we're living so
[1:31:10] when we see weakness when we see despair
[1:31:12] when we see difficulty in our wives then
[1:31:14] what is it it's because chances are
[1:31:15] we're out of our place something's not
[1:31:17] quite right in the home something's not
[1:31:19] quite right in the marriage something's
[1:31:20] not quite quite quite right in the
[1:31:21] family and she's the first one to
[1:31:23] reflect that so us men and this is
[1:31:25] something i had to learn uh especially
[1:31:28] is that you can't just tune that out
[1:31:30] if your wife is is is continuously in a
[1:31:33] difficult place it means there's a
[1:31:35] problem with the leadership in the home
[1:31:37] and you've got to take a real uh you
[1:31:39] know really look in and take inventory
[1:31:41] of where you're at and say lord what's
[1:31:43] going on here now listen if we listen to
[1:31:45] our wives and sit down long enough half
[1:31:46] the time they'll tell us what it really
[1:31:48] is but there's usually a root problem
[1:31:50] that they may not understand they're
[1:31:51] getting the effect of it but they may
[1:31:52] not know where that's at i remember my
[1:31:54] brother was telling me and
[1:31:56] there was a young lady in their church
[1:31:58] and she was having problems with
[1:32:00] promiscuity and and these different
[1:32:02] things in rebellion and the the the
[1:32:04] minister went to the house
[1:32:05] and as soon as he got in the house he
[1:32:07] realized and he took the father aside
[1:32:09] and he says how long have you been
[1:32:10] addicted to pornography
[1:32:13] and the man just looked at him
[1:32:15] because the problem with the daughter
[1:32:16] had nothing to do with the daughter and
[1:32:17] had everything to do with the headship
[1:32:18] in the house
[1:32:19] right and so it's the same thing with
[1:32:21] our wives a lot of times what are they
[1:32:22] remember women are very receptive to
[1:32:25] spirits so guess what if you're under
[1:32:27] the holy spirit in every aspect they're
[1:32:29] going to be receptive to that but if
[1:32:30] you're not they're going to catch that
[1:32:32] real quick and it'll manifest in them
[1:32:33] just as quick as you can imagine it
[1:32:35] right because why they're meant to
[1:32:37] they're a part of us
[1:32:38] right they're part of us and they're
[1:32:39] gonna they're gonna manifest that so if
[1:32:41] you see something in your wife you don't
[1:32:42] like change what you're doing because
[1:32:44] she's just reflecting what you're doing
[1:32:45] if you don't like your wife it's because
[1:32:46] of you not because of her
[1:32:48] and the sisters said amen
[1:32:50] right so what god's grace to you sisters
[1:32:53] because you're working with fallen men
[1:32:55] right to have grace and to keep that
[1:32:57] respect and honor when we trip up and
[1:32:59] it's not a case of if it's when
[1:33:02] it's when right and anybody that's been
[1:33:05] married for more than a week knows that
[1:33:07] right usually you're perfect for about
[1:33:08] the first week
[1:33:10] then after that you make a misstep right
[1:33:12] but what god help you to keep your
[1:33:13] attitudes right and then for us brothers
[1:33:15] what is it god help us to stay humble
[1:33:17] and gracious that we'd be able to sit
[1:33:19] and listen and change the way we're
[1:33:21] doing things amen
[1:33:24] so miriam was she's an inspiration she's
[1:33:26] an inspiration for worship and then what
[1:33:28] she's a lesson in staying in headship
[1:33:30] not letting that gift run ahead of you
[1:33:32] and get you into trouble but all the
[1:33:33] others we're going to talk about here
[1:33:35] tonight every single one of them stays
[1:33:36] in their position and they have a
[1:33:37] wonderful effect holder
[1:33:40] second kings 22 she was a prophetess it
[1:33:42] says so hilkiah the priest and the
[1:33:44] haikum and akbor and shafin and assahya
[1:33:46] went on to holder the prophetess the
[1:33:48] wife of shalom the son of tikvah the son
[1:33:51] of harass keeper of the wardrobe now she
[1:33:54] dwelt in jerusalem at the college and
[1:33:56] they communed with her and she said unto
[1:33:58] them thus saith the lord god of israel
[1:34:00] tell the man that sent you to me. so the
[1:34:02] king had sent them he said he found the
[1:34:04] scrolls and he found things in there
[1:34:05] that were not voting well for israel
[1:34:07] he's like are we going to get judged on
[1:34:09] this so he says go ask holder the
[1:34:11] prophetess to give us a word from the
[1:34:12] lord so they go to a prophetess they go
[1:34:15] to a woman to get a word from the lord
[1:34:17] and what does hold us say now it says
[1:34:19] there that she was she was uh
[1:34:21] she was in the uh the college she dwelt
[1:34:24] in the in jerusalem in the college
[1:34:25] that's not a college like we talked
[1:34:27] about today that's the second quarter or
[1:34:28] the lower quarter that's just a place in
[1:34:30] the city okay this does not mean that
[1:34:32] she was you know studying with the
[1:34:33] priesthood or anything like that don't
[1:34:35] get that in your mind that's not what it
[1:34:36] was it's a geographical location it's
[1:34:38] not a place of study right but when she
[1:34:41] answers you notice what she says she
[1:34:42] doesn't say now i have studied those
[1:34:44] very same scrolls as a student of the
[1:34:46] scripture here is what's going to happen
[1:34:49] what does she say
[1:34:50] thus saith the lord tell the king this
[1:34:53] what god had given her a word and that's
[1:34:55] all she repeated and holder does not go
[1:34:57] and expand on it and add her opinion and
[1:35:00] never predict no no no she says thus
[1:35:02] saith the lord now notice she is the
[1:35:03] wife of a man
[1:35:05] so she's under headship her headship is
[1:35:07] listed she says thus saith the lord
[1:35:09] gives it and then walks away and she's
[1:35:11] done with it right she doesn't start a
[1:35:13] podcast
[1:35:14] right she doesn't start up a big social
[1:35:16] media campaign of this is what holder
[1:35:18] the prophet has to say for today she
[1:35:20] only speaks when the lord comes to her
[1:35:22] and says thus saith the lord and that's
[1:35:24] the only thing that she'll go with amen
[1:35:27] she has no spiritual authority
[1:35:30] she's not teaching
[1:35:31] all she is is a microphone and any gift
[1:35:34] of prophecy is just that i'm not talking
[1:35:36] about a position of prophet i'm talking
[1:35:37] about a gift of a prophet or prophecy
[1:35:39] all you are is a microphone and so when
[1:35:42] god's not speaking then what do you do
[1:35:44] shut up because what's the problem matt
[1:35:46] will tell you this anybody that's worked
[1:35:47] with electronics you know what the
[1:35:48] problem is with a microphone when it has
[1:35:50] electric noise inside of it when it's
[1:35:52] not built quite right a cheap one what
[1:35:55] it has is what it has a sensitivity to
[1:35:57] feedback it's not well shielded and so
[1:35:59] what do you do on a cheap microphone the
[1:36:01] closer you get to certain sources the
[1:36:02] more it squawks and make noises right
[1:36:05] so what a good microphone well shielded
[1:36:07] to be from outside influence including
[1:36:10] your own you only make a sound when god
[1:36:12] speaks for you and that's what she was
[1:36:14] amen she wasn't out there battling with
[1:36:16] the priest she wasn't out there duking
[1:36:17] it out with doctrine she wasn't out
[1:36:19] there teaching she wasn't out there
[1:36:20] holding services right she was silent
[1:36:23] unless she had thus saith the lord
[1:36:25] that look at deborah and deborah
[1:36:27] prophetess the wife of lapidoth she
[1:36:29] judged israel at that time so she's a
[1:36:31] prophetess she is a wife so she's still
[1:36:33] under headship and she's a judge
[1:36:36] and she dwelt no notice where she dwells
[1:36:39] she dwelt under the palm tree of deborah
[1:36:41] between rama and bethel and mount
[1:36:43] ephraim and the children of israel came
[1:36:45] up to her for judgment she's not in the
[1:36:47] temple she's not preaching she's not
[1:36:49] teaching she is a prophetess so she
[1:36:51] speaks thus saith the lord as the word
[1:36:53] of the lord comes to her
[1:36:55] and she's still in headship to her
[1:36:56] husband
[1:36:58] okay so she's under full spiritual
[1:36:59] authority as god has put it in her life
[1:37:02] amen and you notice she's not in the
[1:37:04] church she's also not in city hall
[1:37:07] where is she she's outside the city
[1:37:09] under a tree
[1:37:11] so if you want to talk to deborah does
[1:37:13] she come to you or do you come to her
[1:37:16] they come to her so a man could come to
[1:37:19] her and by coming to her and asking her
[1:37:22] what's he doing he's giving her
[1:37:23] authority to speak if he two men come to
[1:37:25] her or families or whatnot they would
[1:37:27] come to her and they give authority to
[1:37:29] her to judge by asking her to do it she
[1:37:31] is not presuming to do it she's not in a
[1:37:33] voted position or anything like this but
[1:37:35] rather that people come to her and by
[1:37:37] coming to her they give her authority to
[1:37:39] do what she's doing
[1:37:40] now again she doesn't have a podcast she
[1:37:42] doesn't have a regular newspaper that
[1:37:44] she sends out of this is what the judge
[1:37:46] deborah said no no as they come to her
[1:37:48] she deals with them one-on-one with
[1:37:50] their situations one-on-one and they're
[1:37:52] giving her authority to deal with it
[1:37:53] based on her reputation for being a
[1:37:55] prophetess for speaking the word of the
[1:37:57] lord and the wisdom that she shows in
[1:37:59] her judgment so she has earned a place
[1:38:01] of judgment she's earned a place of
[1:38:04] political authority that's what it is
[1:38:06] there and the prophet of god says this
[1:38:08] she's a gifted woman but she's a gifted
[1:38:10] woman still under headship and it's only
[1:38:12] when people give her authority that she
[1:38:14] would speak with authority brother brahm
[1:38:16] says to top it all off this man said a
[1:38:17] woman was a judge in the bible if that's
[1:38:19] not authority over man and this
[1:38:21] businessman that was healed right here
[1:38:23] in the church not long ago his wife said
[1:38:24] brother brown that always puzzled me i
[1:38:26] said why sister how would that puzzle
[1:38:27] you she said well here's a woman judge
[1:38:30] he says that's politics not the church
[1:38:32] that don't have nothing to do with the
[1:38:34] church paul said let them be under
[1:38:35] obedience is also saith allah she was
[1:38:37] under obedience she couldn't be out
[1:38:39] there doing it unless her husband
[1:38:40] allowed her
[1:38:43] right and the law can't put a woman up
[1:38:44] to be a priest can't put it up you've
[1:38:46] never seen a woman high priest you've
[1:38:48] never seen a woman a priest nowhere in
[1:38:49] the bible you've never seen a woman a
[1:38:51] preacher in the bible certainly some of
[1:38:52] them was prophetesses and so forth
[1:38:54] miriam and the different ones so brother
[1:38:56] brahm said politics is not a place for a
[1:38:58] woman in any regard because here he says
[1:39:00] she's in a place of political power but
[1:39:03] she's not in politics she wasn't voted
[1:39:04] in as judge she didn't have the popular
[1:39:06] vote she didn't put her name up for
[1:39:08] election she wasn't in the city she
[1:39:10] wasn't in the mayor's office or anything
[1:39:11] like that they came to her directly
[1:39:14] one-on-one brother brown says this he
[1:39:16] says a woman ain't got no no business in
[1:39:18] politics she's got no business over any
[1:39:20] authority in the church her place is a
[1:39:22] man's queen at home outside of that she
[1:39:24] has nothing and we know that to be the
[1:39:26] church the truth i know that sounds
[1:39:28] old-fashioned but i'm responsible
[1:39:31] so it hasn't changed since brother brahm
[1:39:32] left the scene either so the ministry is
[1:39:34] responsible to say the same thing and i
[1:39:36] know that after my going away from this
[1:39:38] earth them tapes and then books will be
[1:39:40] living on and many of you young children
[1:39:42] will find in the days to come that this
[1:39:44] is exactly the truth because i speak it
[1:39:47] in the name of the lord what's he saying
[1:39:50] thus saith the lord
[1:39:52] amen we better listen
[1:39:55] now
[1:39:56] he says women have no place in politics
[1:39:58] what about men
[1:40:00] what about men in politics
[1:40:04] it's a big big conversation these days
[1:40:06] isn't
[1:40:06] it he says we can't look at democracy it
[1:40:10] was right but it's run it's lived its
[1:40:12] life kings lived their life and kingdoms
[1:40:14] and dictators and all have lived their
[1:40:15] day democracy was the best thing they
[1:40:17] had
[1:40:18] was
[1:40:19] he says but it's so polluted through
[1:40:21] politics it's rotten to the core no
[1:40:23] hopes on it at all you're just like
[1:40:25] trying to build on a charred city that's
[1:40:27] burnt to smolders you can't build it
[1:40:29] it's ruined and gone and it has to be
[1:40:31] that way it must come that way and the
[1:40:33] bible says it will be that way satan is
[1:40:35] the ruler of every nation every kingdom
[1:40:38] belongs to satan and he rules them
[1:40:39] according to his own way of ruling but
[1:40:42] did not he offer them to the son of god
[1:40:43] one day these are mine i do with them
[1:40:46] whatever i want to all the kingdoms of
[1:40:48] the world that's the reason they fight
[1:40:50] and kill a murder so if you think the
[1:40:51] conservatives are better than the
[1:40:52] liberals or vice versa you're wrong
[1:40:56] right if you think the republicans are
[1:40:58] better than the democrats or vice versa
[1:41:00] you're wrong why because satan is
[1:41:02] controlling them all you know the lie
[1:41:04] that believers have believed
[1:41:05] that any one of those parties is somehow
[1:41:07] good
[1:41:08] right they're all bad
[1:41:10] one might be less bad and make our lives
[1:41:12] a little easier because we're not so
[1:41:13] oppressed in what we believe it's more
[1:41:15] accepted but here's the thing satan is
[1:41:17] controlling all of them
[1:41:19] god allows it
[1:41:21] but it's satan that controls all of them
[1:41:23] so whether you're a republican or a
[1:41:24] democrat you're affiliated with satan's
[1:41:26] party whether you're an ndp liberal
[1:41:29] conservative people's party green party
[1:41:31] whatever they're all controlled by satan
[1:41:33] and as much as you might admire some of
[1:41:34] those politicians because there are some
[1:41:36] in there that seem to be decent people
[1:41:38] right we're not taking anything about it
[1:41:40] but the system is controlled by satan so
[1:41:42] you're not winning by voting in any one
[1:41:43] or the other right you think you picked
[1:41:45] the right guy because they aligned they
[1:41:47] say a couple things like two corinthians
[1:41:50] right trump gets up and he reads his
[1:41:52] bible he calls it two corinthians listen
[1:41:53] no no christian calls it two corinthians
[1:41:56] but what did he do he fooled a bunch of
[1:41:58] people into thinking it i got an email
[1:41:59] from a brother a good brother an older
[1:42:01] brother a man i love and respect and he
[1:42:04] was he was extolling the virtues this is
[1:42:06] a message believer extolling the virtues
[1:42:08] of donald trump and i sent him a number
[1:42:10] of these quotes and i haven't heard back
[1:42:11] from him since
[1:42:13] why because i told him it's all satan's
[1:42:14] kingdom
[1:42:16] and what did that mean it meant that he
[1:42:17] had to accept that he was extolling the
[1:42:19] virtues of satan's kingdom
[1:42:22] you can't do it there's not not a one of
[1:42:24] them good there's not a one of them good
[1:42:26] and it's a waste of our time listen what
[1:42:28] it is is we're trying to make our life
[1:42:30] here a little easier
[1:42:31] right we agree a little more with one
[1:42:33] side or the other so we say we'll get
[1:42:34] them in and that'll make life easier
[1:42:35] listen we're not getting out of here
[1:42:37] going in a rapture by making it easier

[1:43:14] the world belongs to me and jesus never
[1:43:16] debated with him the world is controlled
[1:43:18] by the devil and every man that works
[1:43:20] for the government if he ain't a
[1:43:21] christian he's of the devil and working
[1:43:23] for the devil these nations will all

[1:43:43] a place that's dedicated to satan's
[1:43:45] satan's kingdom politics is no different
[1:43:48] right you get caught up in it you spend
[1:43:50] time in it i was talking to some of the
[1:43:52] brothers i i i don't listen to the news

[1:43:56] and just some different things are going
[1:43:58] on i said i'm going to try and
[1:43:59] experiment on myself and for a week i
[1:44:01] listen to the news every morning going
[1:44:02] in while driving selena to work and you
[1:44:05] know what changed
[1:44:06] did the news change
[1:44:08] did the world change no you know who
[1:44:10] changed john cruz
[1:44:12] for the better nope
[1:44:14] i got frustrated angry
[1:44:18] right grumpy
[1:44:20] right a couple people were spoken out of
[1:44:22] existence on the road
[1:44:24] right
[1:44:25] why because i'm sitting there and i'm
[1:44:26] getting frustrated because i'm listening
[1:44:28] to them put a spin on things that i know
[1:44:30] not to be true
[1:44:31] and i know that there's more to it and
[1:44:33] they won't say that and so i'm saying
[1:44:35] there and all i'm doing is building up
[1:44:36] rage
[1:44:38] frustration disappointment
[1:44:40] guess what you can get fear and you're
[1:44:42] the same way
[1:44:43] you can get depression inside you the
[1:44:44] same way what is it that's one week of
[1:44:46] me listening to it and yet we can quote
[1:44:48] more about american politics sometimes
[1:44:50] than we can quote our bible
[1:44:52] right it ought not to be it's satan's
[1:44:54] kingdom it's a total and absolute waste
[1:44:57] of our time amen
[1:44:59] amen we've got enough in our life going
[1:45:01] on
[1:45:01] to not get tied into this sort of thing
[1:45:03] amen and if you dwell on it you feed on
[1:45:05] it you're just getting sucked into
[1:45:06] satan's vortex that's all it is satan's
[1:45:08] vortex right you're supposed to be
[1:45:10] reading the signs and saying it's going
[1:45:12] home time
[1:45:13] right that ought to be what's happening
[1:45:15] here is we got to be looking up and
[1:45:16] saying our redemption draws nigh that's
[1:45:18] that's what we ought to do when we hear
[1:45:20] them being so crazy in the news when we
[1:45:22] hear about these things going on guess
[1:45:24] what we've got gog and magog starting to
[1:45:25] move over in europe don't we right
[1:45:27] russia and china russia's made a move
[1:45:29] china's thinking about making a move
[1:45:31] they say yeah right what's it doing it's
[1:45:33] testing to see how the world will
[1:45:34] respond and guess what if they act like
[1:45:37] wimps guess what's going to happen gag
[1:45:38] and magog are going to start ratcheting
[1:45:40] it up aren't they because they're going
[1:45:41] to know they can put one over on the
[1:45:43] world and that's going to lead to what
[1:45:45] tribulation right this is a test this
[1:45:47] isn't it this is just a little push you
[1:45:49] know what we ought to be saying
[1:45:51] going home time
[1:45:52] right the bible tells us the prophet
[1:45:55] told us this
[1:45:56] what did he say was going to destroy
[1:45:58] wrong
[1:45:59] russia that's right
[1:46:00] what's going to give russia the
[1:46:01] confidence to do that doing something
[1:46:03] like this
[1:46:05] and then the next thing and then the
[1:46:06] next thing and all of a sudden brother
[1:46:07] brown says when they go down for what
[1:46:08] that oil
[1:46:10] right that energy whatever it might be
[1:46:12] right maybe he saw a pipeline i don't
[1:46:14] know what brother bram saw he said oil
[1:46:16] maybe he saw a pipeline maybe it's
[1:46:17] natural gas
[1:46:18] they're finding all sorts of things in
[1:46:20] israel did you know that not only that
[1:46:21] they control land that's key to getting
[1:46:23] some of that stuff out
[1:46:25] what is it we ought to be looking at
[1:46:26] this and not saying let's fix it
[1:46:29] let's take our country back
[1:46:30] let's take our province back let's take
[1:46:32] our rights back listen we don't have any
[1:46:34] rights
[1:46:35] we've lost them a long time ago they've
[1:46:36] got everything they need to shut this
[1:46:38] church down and anyone that remotely
[1:46:39] preaches the word of god in canada they
[1:46:41] call it hate speech that's right right
[1:46:43] so it's all there they're just waiting
[1:46:45] to implement it listen if the world can
[1:46:46] turn against russia in the drop of a hat
[1:46:48] you think they can't turn against
[1:46:49] believers they already have they just
[1:46:51] haven't acted on it the way they have
[1:46:52] with russia but if they're convinced
[1:46:54] that they're doing the right thing
[1:46:55] remember the scripture says they'll turn
[1:46:56] you into the authorities thinking what
[1:46:58] that they're doing god asserts that
[1:47:00] they're doing the right thing we ought
[1:47:01] to be saying this is time for us to be
[1:47:04] getting out of here amen amen if
[1:47:07] anything
[1:47:08] if you think a certain party is wrong
[1:47:11] vote them in because it'll make things
[1:47:13] worse faster and we'll get out of here a
[1:47:15] little quicker
[1:47:18] don't take that seriously
[1:47:20] right
[1:47:21] amen but we ought to we got to get
[1:47:22] uncomfortable and guess what i'm i'm
[1:47:24] still pretty comfortable in my life
[1:47:26] right i'm not comfortable with the world
[1:47:28] but guess what they haven't taken my job
[1:47:30] away they haven't frozen my bank
[1:47:31] accounts listen you think they can't do
[1:47:33] it to you
[1:47:34] you think they can they can't freeze
[1:47:36] your bank account just like they did
[1:47:37] rushes
[1:47:38] they can do that at the drop of hat look
[1:47:40] what they did to the convoy protesters
[1:47:42] at the drop of a hat they said it's
[1:47:43] wrong boom we're gonna take all of your
[1:47:45] assets we're gonna freeze it so you
[1:47:47] can't do what buy or sell
[1:47:50] right that's tribulation we'll get out
[1:47:52] before that but don't think that the
[1:47:53] squeeze isn't going to come down on us
[1:47:55] politically it's got to happen right
[1:47:57] so if they can do it to russia they can
[1:47:58] do it to a believer all day long amen
[1:48:01] they can do it to a convoy protester
[1:48:03] they can definitely do it to a believer
[1:48:05] right
[1:48:07] listen to this we've got phoebe
[1:48:10] romans 16. i commend them to you phoebe
[1:48:12] our sister which is a servant of the
[1:48:14] church which is at sancria
[1:48:16] so that servant there means she's does
[1:48:18] what administrative functions she's
[1:48:20] handling errands that type of thing the
[1:48:22] the root of that word servant there
[1:48:24] means to kick up dust
[1:48:26] you know what that means
[1:48:27] she got stuff done
[1:48:29] she wasn't a she wasn't a talker she was
[1:48:31] a doer
[1:48:32] you know what we've all got people like
[1:48:33] that in our lives and our families in
[1:48:35] this church and what is it they don't
[1:48:37] talk very much but you want something
[1:48:38] done you know the brother or sister to
[1:48:40] go talk to don't you this is what phoebe
[1:48:42] was
[1:48:43] he says what i command that you receive
[1:48:45] her in the lord as become a saints and
[1:48:48] that you assist her in whatsoever
[1:48:49] business she had need of you for she had
[1:48:52] been a sakura of many and of myself also
[1:48:54] so in other words she's helped everybody
[1:48:56] in the church there where paul was
[1:48:57] including paul himself so he says when
[1:48:59] she comes to you she's acting in my name
[1:49:02] and my authority and i'm telling you to
[1:49:04] give her what she asks of you
[1:49:06] so this is a woman going to a
[1:49:08] church going to brothers ghost goes to
[1:49:11] the saints that are in the city and he
[1:49:13] says she has authority to come and ask
[1:49:15] you and whatever she asks of you you
[1:49:17] need to give it to her
[1:49:19] why for the benefiting of the church
[1:49:21] body he says she's a good person we
[1:49:23] trust her she's proven herself so when
[1:49:25] she comes give her whatever she asks for
[1:49:28] does that mean she can't ask the men no
[1:49:30] she gets to go ask the men guess what if
[1:49:32] she needs to set something up if she
[1:49:33] needs money if she needs help she needs
[1:49:35] muscle whatever it is she needs
[1:49:37] introductions he says whatever it is you
[1:49:38] need to give it to her because she's
[1:49:40] there to help the body amen
[1:49:43] don't constrain her give her whatever
[1:49:44] she asks for so she has lots of
[1:49:47] authority but it's been given to her now
[1:49:49] she walked in and all right guys this is
[1:49:52] what i want
[1:49:53] what did they have said
[1:49:55] who are you
[1:49:56] right i guarantee you phoebe was
[1:49:59] probably one of those ones that
[1:50:01] maybe she had a bit of a you know
[1:50:03] people that are due or sometimes they
[1:50:04] can be a bit brusque you know
[1:50:06] what because they get things done
[1:50:09] but when she walked in and that that
[1:50:11] prophet had said this is somebody that
[1:50:12] i've sent to help you out then she could
[1:50:14] ask and they would give it to her
[1:50:16] she's in her place she didn't take it it
[1:50:18] was given to her and in that she was
[1:50:20] able to do it tremendous work
[1:50:22] enough that paul acknowledges her in the
[1:50:24] scriptures
[1:50:25] there's a lot of women acknowledged in
[1:50:27] paul's ministries and we'll see that as
[1:50:28] we get into the next service lord
[1:50:29] willing that when they step into their
[1:50:31] place they can be a tremendous blessing
[1:50:33] not only to the church body but to the
[1:50:34] community and the families around
[1:50:36] right so i have these beautiful examples
[1:50:39] of women that play big roles in the
[1:50:40] scripture and yet they stay perfectly in
[1:50:42] headship
[1:50:44] that's the beauty of it is that there's
[1:50:45] lots available whether you're married
[1:50:47] whether you're single there's lots of
[1:50:48] things that women can do but you have to
[1:50:50] stay within the lines of headship that
[1:50:51] they were that are given to us amen they
[1:50:54] were able to receive that authority and
[1:50:55] not abuse it but use it for the kingdom
[1:50:57] of god that's what this whole series is
[1:50:58] about is will you do what the kingdom of
[1:51:00] god wants you to do with your body with
[1:51:02] your gifts with your life and these
[1:51:03] different things amen but what they
[1:51:05] didn't get there overnight
[1:51:06] phoebe didn't get that sort of authority
[1:51:08] and commendation from paul because she
[1:51:10] did something real good she did this
[1:51:12] time and time and time again deborah
[1:51:14] didn't get a a a reputation for being a
[1:51:16] a wise woman
[1:51:18] by just having one great uh you know
[1:51:20] court case or something like that but
[1:51:22] over time she developed what a trust and
[1:51:24] a and a respect with the people that
[1:51:27] allowed her to help them in a way that
[1:51:29] any other woman probably couldn't have
[1:51:30] right
[1:51:32] but there is a place where women have a
[1:51:34] special place to teach and that's with
[1:51:35] the children and that's with each other
[1:51:38] and that is not something that men give
[1:51:39] to them it's something that god gives to
[1:51:41] them it's a scriptural authority that's
[1:51:43] given to them your husband has no right
[1:51:44] to say you're not allowed to teach my
[1:51:46] kids you're not allowed to teach our
[1:51:47] kids those different things but rather
[1:51:49] the scripture gives them authority
[1:51:51] psalms 127 3 says lo children are in
[1:51:53] heritage of the lord and the fruit of
[1:51:56] the womb is his reward
[1:51:58] says my son hear the instruction of thy
[1:52:00] father
[1:52:01] and forsake not the law
[1:52:04] of thy mother
[1:52:06] so the law
[1:52:07] mother's word is law of times we get
[1:52:10] daddy's word is law scripture says
[1:52:12] mother's word is law
[1:52:14] for they shall be an ornament of grace
[1:52:16] unto thy head and chains about thy neck
[1:52:20] so in the end this is jewelry around the
[1:52:22] mother's neck
[1:52:23] is when what the children respond to
[1:52:26] that law and the instruction of the
[1:52:28] father
[1:52:28] proverbs 22 6 says train up a child in
[1:52:31] the way he should go and when he is old
[1:52:33] he will not depart from it
[1:52:35] proverbs 23 hearken unto thy father that
[1:52:37] begat thee and despise not thy mother
[1:52:40] when she is old to the older sisters i
[1:52:42] say your job is not over
[1:52:44] it's never over until you leave this
[1:52:47] earth you are still there to help if
[1:52:49] they will receive it guide and instruct
[1:52:51] and advise you and give advice to your
[1:52:53] children
[1:52:54] scripture says don't do it when she's
[1:52:55] old
[1:52:56] keep listening because guess what she's
[1:52:58] ahead of you in the game
[1:53:00] you better listen it's to your benefit
[1:53:03] buy the truth and sell it not also
[1:53:05] wisdom and instruction and understanding
[1:53:07] the father of the righteous shall
[1:53:09] greatly rejoice and he that begetteth a
[1:53:11] wise child shall have joy of him thy
[1:53:13] father and thy mother shall be glad and
[1:53:16] she that bear thee shall rejoice
[1:53:19] she does that
[1:53:20] and you receive it then she's going to
[1:53:21] be a happy mama
[1:53:24] deuteronomy 6 hear o israel the lord our
[1:53:26] god is one lord and thou shalt love the
[1:53:28] lord thy god with all thine heart and
[1:53:29] with all thy soul and with all thy might
[1:53:31] and these words which i command thee
[1:53:33] this day shall be in thine heart and
[1:53:35] thou shalt teach them diligently unto
[1:53:37] thy children and shall talk of them when
[1:53:40] thou sittest in thine house and when
[1:53:42] they'll walk us by the way and when
[1:53:43] they'll lie us down and when they'll
[1:53:45] rise and stop
[1:53:47] brothers and sisters alike when we rise
[1:53:49] up what are we telling our kids
[1:53:50] throughout the day when we're walking
[1:53:51] with them what are we telling them when
[1:53:53] we lay down what are we telling them
[1:53:55] scripture says we're supposed to what
[1:53:57] teach them all these things
[1:53:59] it says what and thou shalt bind them
[1:54:01] for a sign upon thine hand and they
[1:54:03] shall be as frontlets between thine eyes
[1:54:05] you know what frontlines are they used
[1:54:06] to call them blinders and on a horse
[1:54:08] what they do is they block everything in
[1:54:10] their peripheral vision so that all they
[1:54:11] were focused on was where the the person
[1:54:14] that was in control of them was guiding
[1:54:15] and was was pointing them so the horse
[1:54:18] couldn't see anything but what was right
[1:54:19] in front of him
[1:54:20] right that's what it's supposed to be
[1:54:21] for us is that god puts what says
[1:54:24] dismiss everything else just go where i
[1:54:26] point you and stay focused on that
[1:54:29] right amen and thou shalt write them
[1:54:32] upon the posts of thy house
[1:54:34] and on thy gates brother brown says this
[1:54:36] he says to you little mothers here this
[1:54:37] morning that's been real mothers and i
[1:54:39] know there's many of you i think every
[1:54:41] one of you let me tell you something god
[1:54:43] bless you you're the fifth gospel i
[1:54:45] think
[1:54:46] let me tell you what now for your
[1:54:48] children just a little thing remember
[1:54:50] when moses was a little boy it was a
[1:54:52] mother who gave him his instruction it
[1:54:54] was a godly mother who took little moses
[1:54:56] on her knees and said moses and taught
[1:54:58] him all
[1:54:59] she was his teacher rather under pharaoh
[1:55:01] and said now all these things said moses
[1:55:03] someday you're going to deliver the
[1:55:04] children of israel you're the boy that's
[1:55:06] called keep yourself pure and unspotted
[1:55:08] from the world for you're the one you're
[1:55:10] the one he says what that was mama why
[1:55:12] because daddy was out there in the mud
[1:55:13] pits all day wasn't he
[1:55:15] so mama was the one sitting at home
[1:55:17] teaching him he says no other place do
[1:55:18] we know wherever went to any seminary
[1:55:21] any teaching at all he ever got he
[1:55:23] stayed right in pharaoh's palace which
[1:55:24] was a heathen but his mother taught him
[1:55:27] that's a real mother
[1:55:29] she taught him the precepts of the lord
[1:55:31] she told him how he must be holy she
[1:55:33] told him how and what he must live and
[1:55:35] how what ma what god must do and would
[1:55:38] do for him and it stuck with moses all
[1:55:40] the days of his life and any good true
[1:55:43] loyal mother that'll take her little
[1:55:44] babies instead of send them to picture
[1:55:46] shows and dances and so forth like that
[1:55:49] and she'll put them on her lap and teach
[1:55:50] them about the lord jesus christ amen
[1:55:53] sisters you feel you got a gift to
[1:55:55] preach or teach there's your
[1:55:56] congregation
[1:55:58] it's right there
[1:55:59] listen brother brown says this exactly
[1:56:01] he says there's nothing god could give
[1:56:03] any man any sweeter than a wife a real
[1:56:05] wife but when she gets anything beyond
[1:56:07] that she's out of what her place that's
[1:56:10] exactly right god never intended women
[1:56:11] to work in any of these places and do
[1:56:13] them kind of things like that these
[1:56:15] women there to have children and raise
[1:56:16] their children now we're talking to the
[1:56:17] married women not the singles now
[1:56:20] he says they're all little preachers
[1:56:22] who's he talking about kids
[1:56:25] the little boys
[1:56:27] no he's talking about the women he says
[1:56:29] there's your women preachers okay you
[1:56:31] want to see in the message where women
[1:56:32] preachers fit here they are they're all
[1:56:34] little preachers every one of them and
[1:56:36] they have their their own pastoral
[1:56:38] duties at home with their kitties
[1:56:41] bringing up their children
[1:56:43] there's women preachers for you
[1:56:45] you've got a congregation ready supplied
[1:56:48] right for you you've got a captive
[1:56:50] audience as we've talked about that's
[1:56:52] for you to preach to that's for you to
[1:56:54] teach to that's for you to evangelize to
[1:56:57] right all the things that the fivefold
[1:56:59] ministry is supposed to do that's what a
[1:57:00] mother can be doing with their very kids
[1:57:01] there what are you doing introducing
[1:57:03] them to christ right by a life first by
[1:57:06] word second then what do you do you lead
[1:57:08] them to them then you help guide them in
[1:57:10] it until the point where they can go
[1:57:11] away and join right in alongside of you
[1:57:13] what is it you do you do the full
[1:57:15] five-fold ministry right there in your
[1:57:16] home
[1:57:18] with a captive audience that god has
[1:57:19] called you to do
[1:57:21] that's your place literally to preach to
[1:57:23] those little kids day in and day out
[1:57:25] he says the first preacher that ever
[1:57:27] gets a child is a mother there's five
[1:57:29] gospels matthew mark luke john and
[1:57:31] mother and a mother should be a
[1:57:33] spirit-filled woman who can teach her
[1:57:35] children and teach them to pray and to
[1:57:37] know about god and so forth
[1:57:40] now brothers that doesn't mean we
[1:57:42] abdicate all of the teaching to our
[1:57:43] wives does it
[1:57:44] that's something that we've got to
[1:57:45] remember is just because we go out the
[1:57:46] door for work every morning and she's
[1:57:48] sitting there doing this throughout the
[1:57:49] day doesn't mean that we come home and
[1:57:51] we presume she's done it all that ought
[1:57:52] to be us we ought to be able to lead
[1:57:54] them in devotions we ought to lead them
[1:57:55] in family prayer we have to be able to
[1:57:57] go with needs before the lord we ought
[1:57:58] to be able to pray and put them down at
[1:58:00] night when they go to sleep right don't
[1:58:02] just place it all on the mothers we got
[1:58:03] to lead them as well we're supposed to
[1:58:05] be spiritual leaders in the family so
[1:58:06] she gets more time but we've got to make
[1:58:08] sure that we're still leading
[1:58:09] spiritually not just physically within
[1:58:11] the home
[1:58:13] amen we don't want to give that all over
[1:58:14] to the mothers for sir for sure
[1:58:16] so let me ask you sisters have you been
[1:58:18] preaching
[1:58:19] if so was it to your kids because that's
[1:58:22] where you're given authority in the
[1:58:23] scriptures if you're an agent woman
[1:58:25] you're there to teach the younger women
[1:58:26] and we've talked about that but if
[1:58:27] you're married guess what god has given
[1:58:30] you a place to preach your heart out day
[1:58:32] in and day out in fact you ought to have
[1:58:34] nothing left to preach to anybody else
[1:58:36] by the time you're done with your
[1:58:37] children because that's your
[1:58:38] congregation
[1:58:39] right that's why minister that's why
[1:58:41] pastors often times they don't want to
[1:58:42] leave they're so tired out from
[1:58:43] preaching to their own congregation
[1:58:45] right that's what we want the mothers to
[1:58:47] be we ought to be so tired out from
[1:58:48] preaching to our own little congregation
[1:58:50] that when we go out we don't want to
[1:58:52] preach to anybody else we're preached
[1:58:53] out
[1:58:54] you know what after a service is done i
[1:58:56] don't want to go in there and go go to
[1:58:57] another church and preach why because
[1:58:59] i'm preached out that's what brother
[1:59:00] brown i'm saying listen you're the fifth
[1:59:02] gospel you're the one that those
[1:59:03] children are looking to so often to help
[1:59:05] teach them and guide them that way amen
[1:59:07] and what we've read the scriptures and
[1:59:08] it says that what you won't be ashamed
[1:59:10] you won't be fearful
[1:59:12] right you won't you know you talked
[1:59:14] about you know not being in amazement
[1:59:15] and these different things you won't be
[1:59:17] distrustful of what god's doing in your
[1:59:19] life because you see him working in the
[1:59:21] young people in the children that he's
[1:59:23] given you and sometimes they come late
[1:59:25] don't they
[1:59:26] i think we've we've all got families
[1:59:27] where maybe one person or another is out
[1:59:29] or we we have extended family that are
[1:59:31] like that you say well what's going to
[1:59:32] happen
[1:59:33] listen he said what when they're old
[1:59:34] they won't turn away from it right
[1:59:36] sometimes they've got to go through like
[1:59:37] the prodigal son don't they they've got
[1:59:39] to come to themselves at some point and
[1:59:41] realize guess what being with the pigs
[1:59:42] ain't all it was cut up to be
[1:59:44] listen we talked last service about how
[1:59:46] satan comes in gradual i was thinking
[1:59:48] about after the prodigal son you talk
[1:59:49] about gradual because he went from
[1:59:51] wealthy
[1:59:52] tons of friends lots of influence having
[1:59:55] a great time to eating with the pigs in
[1:59:57] pretty short order and i get i guarantee
[1:59:59] you along the way he didn't realize
[2:00:00] exactly what was happening but satan got
[2:00:02] him all the way down into the pig pen
[2:00:03] before he came to himself and said
[2:00:05] listen even the servants
[2:00:07] at my father's house live better than
[2:00:09] i'm living right now and he came to
[2:00:11] himself and sometimes that's what our
[2:00:12] children have to do isn't it they have
[2:00:13] to get down with the pigs and realize
[2:00:16] this really wasn't what i was looking
[2:00:17] for
[2:00:18] and then they come back they come to
[2:00:19] their senses and they come back what
[2:00:21] when they're old when they come to
[2:00:22] maturity they realize that there's
[2:00:24] something else for them amen amen
[2:00:26] sisters you want a rewarding career
[2:00:28] here you go
[2:00:29] this is what god has called women to do
[2:00:31] this is womanhood for men for for a
[2:00:34] believer is as a mother amen we're not
[2:00:37] all called to that and we'll get into
[2:00:38] that in a couple services from now lord
[2:00:40] willing we're not called up but if god
[2:00:41] has given you a marriage then generally
[2:00:43] that means god's going to give you
[2:00:44] children and you have a complete
[2:00:46] ministry lying in front of you for the
[2:00:47] next 20 30 40 years even all the way
[2:00:50] till you're old the scripture says that
[2:00:51] you're still not supposed to stop being
[2:00:53] that mother amen what is it god's gonna
[2:00:55] bless you in ways that he wouldn't
[2:00:56] otherwise because why the holy spirit
[2:00:58] has given you the authority to do
[2:01:00] everything that you do as a mother amen
[2:01:02] when your husband has trusted you and
[2:01:04] he's entrusted these things you have
[2:01:05] children it's the holy spirit that
[2:01:07] empowers a woman to step into this role
[2:01:09] even of a woman minister in her own
[2:01:11] family that she's going to take that
[2:01:12] word she's going to put it on her lips
[2:01:14] she's going to put it on her life and
[2:01:15] guess what as we all know as parents
[2:01:17] there's nothing that's going to test
[2:01:18] your relationship with god as much as
[2:01:19] having a kid
[2:01:21] right your marriage is put through way
[2:01:22] more stress with those kids isn't it and
[2:01:25] as soon as they come through and they
[2:01:26] hit the teenage years and all of a
[2:01:27] sudden they start getting ideas and they
[2:01:29] start thinking they're smart and they
[2:01:30] know better and that may go on for
[2:01:32] decades sometimes what is it it's going
[2:01:34] to put a strain on you and what's it
[2:01:35] going to do it's going to pull you
[2:01:36] closer to god as well isn't it once you
[2:01:38] get a family that'll pull you closer to
[2:01:40] god because you realize very quickly the
[2:01:42] limitations of your own skills your own
[2:01:44] ideas your own understanding your own
[2:01:46] education your own experience and you
[2:01:48] need supernatural help and that sort of
[2:01:49] thing it'll bring a power of the holy
[2:01:51] spirit in your life that you didn't have
[2:01:52] before that i guarantee you why because
[2:01:54] the word says that's where you're
[2:01:55] supposed to be amen let's stand if we
[2:01:58] would
[2:01:59] it's a powerful thing
[2:02:00] when you realize that you're doing what
[2:02:02] god has told you to do amen
[2:02:04] it is it's a powerful thing and whether
[2:02:05] it's the church you attend whether it's
[2:02:07] the ministry you have whether it's the
[2:02:09] spouse you have the job you have the
[2:02:11] function you might fulfill within this
[2:02:12] church when you realize that that that's
[2:02:14] what god has called you to do
[2:02:16] then that's a powerful thing because you
[2:02:18] know that all of heaven is behind you so
[2:02:20] our sisters as tough as it is sometimes
[2:02:22] to sit behind those boundaries and see
[2:02:24] some of the faults and failures and
[2:02:26] abuses and mistakes yet know that god
[2:02:28] has given you a place where that holy
[2:02:30] spirit can have free reign in your life
[2:02:32] and if you can only trust and wait god
[2:02:34] will bless you in a way that you would
[2:02:36] never have if you try and force those
[2:02:37] things yourself amen us men have to do
[2:02:40] the same thing so often we think a
[2:02:42] decision has got to be made it's got to
[2:02:43] be made and we try and jump in there and
[2:02:46] sometimes god's just saying hold on a
[2:02:47] second son
[2:02:48] you got to rest too
[2:02:50] right it's not we we focus on the women
[2:02:52] because it says if you're sarah's
[2:02:53] daughters then you're going to have that
[2:02:54] rest you're going to have that trust but
[2:02:56] listen us men have to have that as well
[2:02:58] don't we we've got to be able to sit
[2:02:59] there and say lord we're depending on
[2:03:01] you and we're not going to force the
[2:03:02] situation amen and when we do what when
[2:03:05] we're in our word position we have
[2:03:07] spiritual authority then to hold back
[2:03:09] anything
[2:03:10] while we wait for god to give us the
[2:03:12] answer that we're looking for amen amen
[2:03:14] god bless you let's bow our heads
[2:03:17] heavenly father
[2:03:19] lord once again your word challenges us
[2:03:21] lord not just the sisters but even us
[2:03:24] brothers lord as members of the bride
[2:03:26] lord that we want to stay in the
[2:03:28] position that you've set for us
[2:03:30] lord that as you've given us authority
[2:03:31] lord we would use it for your benefit
[2:03:33] for your kingdom's benefit
[2:03:35] and lord that we would learn to wait and
[2:03:36] trust
[2:03:37] lord that we would learn to give all of
[2:03:39] our energy to the things that you put in
[2:03:41] front of us lord that we would lord set
[2:03:43] it as blinders as frontlets before our
[2:03:45] eyes so that we're not distracted
[2:03:46] heavenly father it's a distracting world
[2:03:49] right now lord satan is a master
[2:03:51] distracter lord but we pray that you
[2:03:52] would give us an unction of the holy
[2:03:54] spirit lord that has a word foundation
[2:03:56] lord for whatever calling or ministry or
[2:03:59] lord thing that we find we're going to
[2:04:00] focus our energy on may we find it first
[2:04:03] in the word lord and then by inspiration
[2:04:05] follow into it so that you can use us we
[2:04:07] pray lord bless our sisters
[2:04:09] lord how we love and appreciate lord
[2:04:11] their willingness lord to submit
[2:04:13] themselves lord in a time when the world
[2:04:15] is screaming at them to break chains
[2:04:17] lord to break boundaries glass ceilings
[2:04:19] lord whatever it might be lord yet
[2:04:21] they're staying with your word and we
[2:04:23] pray that you would help us to be worthy
[2:04:24] of the trust and honor and respect that
[2:04:26] they give us
[2:04:27] lord that you would help us as men to be
[2:04:29] humble lord above all things that we
[2:04:31] would put their their needs lord above
[2:04:33] our own even lord as you did for us lord
[2:04:35] and may your love throw flow through
[2:04:37] each one of us lord that we would humble
[2:04:39] ourselves to each other lord under your
[2:04:41] word we pray lord bless us now we ask in
[2:04:43] jesus name we pray
[2:04:45] amen amen

[2:29:08] we want to just sing that a couple of
[2:29:10] times and i supported david to close in
[2:29:13] prayer tonight and remember
[2:29:15] to pray for the needs that were
[2:29:16] mentioned earlier i didn't realize
[2:29:17] brother gerald had been injured so in a
[2:29:20] fall so we want to remember him
[2:29:22] tonight as well and sister betty of
[2:29:25] course
[2:29:26] and all those that were with him
[2:29:28] with us tonight
[2:29:30] so grace to each one may god minister to
[2:29:32] each and every need and continue to pray
[2:29:34] for the saints in ukraine and
[2:29:37] and the innocent people have suffered
[2:29:38] because of
[2:29:40] because of a
[2:29:41] dictator because of a politician
[2:29:44] and so that's just
[2:29:46] that's why i couldn't agree more and the
[2:29:49] quotes i've seen in america what brother
[2:29:51] brandon said about politics uh
[2:29:54] you only said about one-fifth of them
[2:29:58] but uh
[2:29:59] it's so it's just so true
[2:30:01] and so may god just
[2:30:03] touch the innocence
[2:30:05] and protect them all and especially the
[2:30:07] saints of god
[2:30:08] and
[2:30:09] remember of course
[2:30:10] sister laura collins as well
[2:30:13] and let's all hold on in faith
[2:30:15] and you know i just say this about faith
[2:30:18] and
[2:30:19] um
[2:30:20] i've been listening some messages this
[2:30:22] week and and one my
[2:30:24] brother and uh
[2:30:26] he gave a testimony
[2:30:28] uh
[2:30:29] something that happened to brother andre
[2:30:30] head and we know brother andre head of
[2:30:32] course he was he was here a few years
[2:30:34] ago and i'm sure we'd love to have him
[2:30:36] back
[2:30:37] uh but as you know he's a minister a
[2:30:41] missionary
[2:30:42] and he was called he was he was heading
[2:30:45] over to
[2:30:46] the jungles around venezuela
[2:30:49] and uh
[2:30:51] i don't know if anybody heard this but i
[2:30:52] only heard it last night and
[2:30:55] brother uh
[2:30:57] the topic that the brother was preaching
[2:30:58] about was was about faith of course
[2:31:00] about knowing
[2:31:02] knowing where you stand what influence
[2:31:04] you're really under right and uh he said
[2:31:08] he said brother andre was was being led
[2:31:10] to go over there into the jungles and
[2:31:13] he said where he was going was where
[2:31:15] there were tribes there were cannibals
[2:31:18] tribes of indians that were cannibals so
[2:31:20] he said you have to know that god is
[2:31:22] sending you and brother andre invited
[2:31:24] somebody else to go with him and he said
[2:31:26] nope not going
[2:31:28] right he said you got to know and when
[2:31:30] he got over there
[2:31:32] uh he was he went in with his
[2:31:34] interpreter and and others that went in
[2:31:36] with them into the deepest jungles in
[2:31:38] there
[2:31:39] and he
[2:31:41] um
[2:31:42] when he got in there he was preaching
[2:31:44] for to these indians for two or three
[2:31:46] days
[2:31:47] and he said on the third day
[2:31:49] an indian came up with him with a
[2:31:50] container of
[2:31:52] some liquid in it
[2:31:54] and he took it and he stood in front of
[2:31:57] brother andre and he and he took that
[2:31:59] glass or whatever it was and he threw it
[2:32:02] on the ground and smashed it in front of
[2:32:04] him but andre said well
[2:32:06] what's this about
[2:32:07] and the indian said for the past three
[2:32:09] days he said you've been drinking this
[2:32:12] he said i've been trying to kill you and
[2:32:14] poison you with this stuff and he said
[2:32:15] you've been drinking it
[2:32:17] and he fell to his knees and asked him
[2:32:19] to lead him to the lord
[2:32:22] all right it's in knowing what god
[2:32:25] has for you and if he's if he's leading
[2:32:27] you he'll look after you
[2:32:29] i mean that's that's scripture
[2:32:31] manifested right there right i mean it's
[2:32:33] just absolutely wonderful
[2:32:36] so you know let's let's just trust the
[2:32:39] lord here right now
[2:32:41] i mean the devil might be doing this to
[2:32:43] sister laura collins but
[2:32:45] uh you know
[2:32:46] if we pray and believe together there's
[2:32:48] nothing can stand in the way of that
[2:32:50] these are the promises of god that are
[2:32:52] given to the children of god
[2:32:54] so let's believe tonight for her and and
[2:32:56] believe for brother evan and believe for
[2:32:58] brother gerald but i believe for all for
[2:33:01] each other
[2:33:02] no matter what the need is god is
[2:33:04] greater than any need and we believe
[2:33:05] that the devil got nothing he got
[2:33:07] nothing
[2:33:09] i was born to be a dwelling place

[2:33:13] was born
