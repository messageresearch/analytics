[1:04:29] go in to hear the prophet of god
[1:04:32] amen
[1:04:34] in matthew 22 and verse 1.
[1:04:40] and jesus answered and spake unto them
[1:04:43] again by parables
[1:04:45] and said the kingdom of heaven
[1:04:48] is like unto a certain king
[1:04:51] which made a marriage for his son
[1:04:55] and sent forth his servants
[1:04:57] to call them that were bidden to the
[1:04:59] wedding
[1:05:01] and
[1:05:02] they would not come
[1:05:04] amazing
[1:05:06] and again he sent forth other servants
[1:05:09] saying tell them which are bidden
[1:05:12] behold i have prepared my dinner
[1:05:15] amen
[1:05:17] my oxen and my fatlings are killed and
[1:05:20] all things already come unto the
[1:05:24] marriage praise the lord
[1:05:27] but they made light of it don't make
[1:05:29] light of the word
[1:05:31] don't make later what god has done and
[1:05:33] what god is doing amen
[1:05:36] and it says but but they made light of
[1:05:39] it and went their ways one to his farm
[1:05:42] and another to his merchandise
[1:05:45] don't let the natural things of life
[1:05:47] catch
[1:05:48] your attention amen let's give our
[1:05:51] attention to the spiritual the revealed
[1:05:54] word of god amen the word that's been
[1:05:56] ordained and predestinated to give us
[1:05:59] the faith we need
[1:06:01] amen what is the faith you feel you need
[1:06:04] amen what is the faith that god wants us
[1:06:07] to have amen god's looking for looking
[1:06:09] for
[1:06:10] to see in you and in me
[1:06:12] amen brother
[1:06:14] it's amazing but let's be on our guard
[1:06:16] because the faith that god is looking
[1:06:18] for in you and in me is resurrection and
[1:06:22] rapturing faith
[1:06:23] amen because amen because that's the
[1:06:26] thing that god has ordained and god has
[1:06:28] predestinated amen to bring the past now
[1:06:31] in these last days so be on your guard
[1:06:34] be on your toes believe the word
[1:06:37] amen but believe the word that god has
[1:06:40] revealed believe the word that god is
[1:06:42] revealing amen brothers look for that
[1:06:45] word to come to pass
[1:06:47] look let's be expecting the resurrection
[1:06:50] let's be expecting the rapture
[1:06:53] by the grace of god amen
[1:06:56] and it says verse 6 and the remnant took
[1:06:58] his servants and entered them spitefully
[1:07:02] and slew them or entreated them
[1:07:04] spitefully and slew them
[1:07:08] but when the king heard thereof he was
[1:07:11] wroth and he sent forth his armies and
[1:07:14] destroyed those murderers and burned up
[1:07:17] their city
[1:07:19] and then said he to his servants the
[1:07:22] wedding is ready
[1:07:25] but they which were bidden were not
[1:07:28] worthy
[1:07:30] grace to us
[1:07:32] go ye therefore into the highways and as
[1:07:36] many as ye shall find bid to the
[1:07:39] marriage
[1:07:41] so these servants went out into the
[1:07:43] highways and gathered together all as
[1:07:46] many as they found
[1:07:48] both bad
[1:07:49] and
[1:07:50] good
[1:07:52] and the wedding was furnished
[1:07:55] with guests
[1:07:57] and when the king came in to see the
[1:07:59] guests he saw there a man which had not
[1:08:02] on a wedding garment
[1:08:05] and he saith unto him friend
[1:08:08] how camest thou in ether not having a
[1:08:10] wedding garment
[1:08:12] and he was speechless
[1:08:14] amen
[1:08:15] brother make your calling and election
[1:08:17] sure make sure you got the wedding
[1:08:19] garment
[1:08:20] amen praise the name of the lord
[1:08:24] regard called unto a marriage supper of
[1:08:26] the lamb by the grace of god
[1:08:29] and verse 12 and he saith unto him
[1:08:32] friend how came us thou in hither not
[1:08:34] having a wedding garment and he was
[1:08:36] speechless and then said the king to the
[1:08:39] servants bind him and and foot and take
[1:08:42] him away and cast him into outer
[1:08:44] darkness and there shall be weeping and
[1:08:47] gnashing of teeth
[1:08:49] for many are called
[1:08:51] but few
[1:08:52] are chosen
[1:08:54] amen and the message the prophet is
[1:08:56] going to minister on is one in a million
[1:09:01] amen
[1:09:02] brother is not the impression that we
[1:09:04] were left with down through the ages in
[1:09:06] one revival after another and we thought
[1:09:08] oh not one in a million there's gonna be
[1:09:10] a million in a billion amen maybe that
[1:09:13] out of this age of that age and that age
[1:09:15] there's gonna be a million amen that
[1:09:17] god's gonna choose that god's going to
[1:09:19] call to the marriage supper of the lamb
[1:09:21] no
[1:09:22] many are called but few are chosen
[1:09:25] amen because god's looking at your heart
[1:09:29] the call goes forth by the word the call
[1:09:31] goes forth through the word but god's
[1:09:33] looking at your response to the word
[1:09:36] god's looking at your your feeling
[1:09:38] concerning the word amen your attitude
[1:09:40] toward the word
[1:09:42] oh praise the lord i understand this
[1:09:44] brother when it comes oh well this
[1:09:46] brother he's got all these good deeds he
[1:09:48] does this he's good he's good what is it
[1:09:51] in his heart amen because a person can
[1:09:54] be as good as anything when it comes to
[1:09:56] the
[1:09:56] the things of the flesh they do this
[1:09:58] they do that but brother what about any
[1:10:00] what the love of god in their heart do
[1:10:02] they really really really have it in
[1:10:05] their heart do they really appreciate
[1:10:06] the word in their souls do they really
[1:10:08] appreciate god in their hearts amen do
[1:10:11] they really appreciate one another in
[1:10:13] their hearts amen so brother that's what
[1:10:15] god's looking at right now he's looking
[1:10:18] at your heart amen it's not your head
[1:10:21] and and not necessarily what even what
[1:10:24] even what i'll say and and i'll all
[1:10:26] respond and all i'll react and so i know
[1:10:30] looking for a reaction but he he wants
[1:10:33] to see it in the heart
[1:10:35] he wants to hear it in the heart amen so
[1:10:38] brother we're going to praise the lord
[1:10:40] is it is it out of our heads or out of
[1:10:42] our hearts
[1:10:43] amen amen so i pray grace brother when
[1:10:46] we praise the lord we're responding to
[1:10:48] the word amen amen amen out of the heart
[1:10:52] that's what god's looking for
[1:10:54] amen because too many it's just out of
[1:10:57] their heads
[1:10:59] oh yeah intellectually
[1:11:00] but brother god wants it spiritually
[1:11:02] from your soul
[1:11:04] amen
[1:11:05] it shows that amen brother i'm not into
[1:11:08] this physically i'm into it spiritually
[1:11:10] praise the lord
[1:11:12] you you bring the physical subject to
[1:11:15] the spiritual
[1:11:16] amen don't let the physical take control
[1:11:18] the spiritual
[1:11:20] no no you let the spiritual take control
[1:11:22] the physical
[1:11:24] amen let's believe god out of our hearts
[1:11:27] oh no brother not just out of the head
[1:11:30] because there's many that believe god
[1:11:31] under their heads but they're they're
[1:11:33] going to hell
[1:11:34] oh yeah
[1:11:35] but god's looking for the faith in the
[1:11:38] heart grace to us
[1:11:41] this is why brother that in these last
[1:11:43] days there's going to be one in a
[1:11:45] million
[1:11:46] why because one in a million
[1:11:50] believe in the heart
[1:11:52] others just got it in their heads
[1:11:55] others got it in their in their bodies
[1:11:57] in their physical beings oh yes i
[1:11:59] believe this oh thank you lord wonderful
[1:12:01] i feel this i we're not going by
[1:12:03] feelings we're going by faith
[1:12:05] not what you feel
[1:12:07] is what you sense in your heart your
[1:12:09] soul
[1:12:10] by the grace of god
[1:12:11] amen
[1:12:13] so again he said
[1:12:15] then said the king to the servants
[1:12:17] bind him and foot
[1:12:20] those that were those that never had the
[1:12:22] proper garment a wedding garment
[1:12:24] bind them hand and foot and take them
[1:12:26] away and cast them into outer darkness
[1:12:29] and there shall be weeping and gnashing
[1:12:31] of teeth for many are called but few are
[1:12:36] chosen and we trust by grace we're
[1:12:38] numbered with the chosen
[1:12:40] amen
[1:12:42] he has called but chosen
[1:12:46] from among all that god is called we
[1:12:49] that brother god recognizes
[1:12:52] our faith in our hearts
[1:12:55] not not oh lord i believe this i believe
[1:12:57] that no you do you you believe it so
[1:12:59] does the devil
[1:13:01] but brother god's looking for faith in
[1:13:03] the heart
[1:13:04] amen
[1:13:05] so god help us to believe from the heart
[1:13:08] and as we go into the word we pray grace
[1:13:11] to
[1:13:12] hear it from the heart and in your heart
[1:13:15] and the lord
[1:13:16] by grace that the lord will give us the
[1:13:18] faith of the revealed word in your heart
[1:13:21] you're going to really appreciate this
[1:13:23] not in your head but in your heart
[1:13:26] amen
[1:13:27] so grace as we go into one in a million
[1:13:30] april 24
[1:13:31] 1965
[1:13:33] so god bless you you may be seated

[1:14:13] to meet our lord jesus and see him over
[1:14:15] there
[1:14:16] he promised that he would be wherever
[1:14:18] two or three was together together he
[1:14:20] would be there and i'm sure that i
[1:14:23] met him this morning as i come up the
[1:14:25] steps
[1:14:26] here in this auditorium when all the
[1:14:28] people with great anticipations waiting
[1:14:30] for the breakfast and the speaking and
[1:14:33] it's good to be gathered here with you
[1:14:35] and uh to the radio audience there's so
[1:14:38] many in here there i had to go down the
[1:14:40] next floor and speak to a few and
[1:14:42] seen so many requests
[1:14:45] heart trouble and different ailments
[1:14:47] of their bodies and we're here now to
[1:14:50] pray for the sick and the afflicted
[1:14:53] justice got top the steps i'm looking at
[1:14:55] the old gentleman now he came up to me
[1:14:57] and said
[1:14:58] brother brown years ago he said he had
[1:15:01] heart trouble so bad that he they
[1:15:03] thought he was going to die
[1:15:05] i had prayer for him and
[1:15:07] grace of god healed him and here he is
[1:15:09] this morning way in his 80s just
[1:15:11] rejoicing
[1:15:12] so
[1:15:13] that makes us take new hope
[1:15:15] and now i'm certainly soliciting the
[1:15:17] prayers of the people out in the
[1:15:20] radio land as well as here

[1:15:25] europe down into africa and around all
[1:15:28] meetings and uh
[1:15:30] this is going by a vision so it's going
[1:15:32] to be a great meeting there i'm sure
[1:15:35] i've felt for years that the lord has
[1:15:37] warned me to come back the little humbly
[1:15:39] humble ministry that he gave me
[1:15:42] i don't think he's quite finished with
[1:15:43] it yet over there it seemed like there
[1:15:45] might be a soul somewhere that i could
[1:15:48] catch in the gospel net the one that
[1:15:50] he's given me to
[1:15:51] sing for the people a way of in divine
[1:15:54] healing praying for the sick
[1:15:56] and i certainly solicit your prayers for
[1:15:59] you people hearing them or out in the
[1:16:02] radio audience i don't have time to
[1:16:05] take a text and preach which i expect
[1:16:08] you to after a few minutes here in the
[1:16:11] the
[1:16:11] auditorium but just to
[1:16:14] speak and
[1:16:16] to you a few moments to get acquainted
[1:16:17] and to the people out in the land i'm
[1:16:19] going to have
[1:16:20] prayer for those out there right away
[1:16:22] and you're here also
[1:16:25] and i'm certainly glad to meet all these
[1:16:26] fine new friends that i
[1:16:28] have never met before just come in
[1:16:30] contact with them this
[1:16:32] morning we've been having great times
[1:16:36] in the services and other places
[1:16:38] i don't get out too much anymore it's so
[1:16:41] busy we just
[1:16:44] got to keep the
[1:16:45] road hot between jeffersonville indiana
[1:16:48] and tucson arizona where we moved out
[1:16:51] there a few years ago
[1:16:53] by a vision of the lord that sent us out
[1:16:56] there to not knowing where i was going
[1:16:59] and many of you heard clifton's i spoke
[1:17:02] to you a little before left in a phoenix
[1:17:04] meeting of a vision that had come of
[1:17:06] seeing seven angels in a cluster
[1:17:09] i know to the radio audience perhaps
[1:17:11] many of you are not full gospel
[1:17:13] and this may seem a little mysterious to
[1:17:16] you which it would to me
[1:17:19] but there is
[1:17:21] anyone who can explain anything you
[1:17:24] don't have to accept it anymore by faith
[1:17:26] it's things that we cannot explain that
[1:17:29] we have to accept by faith we cannot
[1:17:31] explain god no man can explain god
[1:17:35] he's sovereign he's great mighty we just
[1:17:39] we just accept it
[1:17:40] because we know he's there and then by
[1:17:43] our faith in accepting it he brings a
[1:17:46] response back to us as a baptism of the
[1:17:48] holy spirit which i'm just going to
[1:17:50] speak to you about in a few moments a
[1:17:53] year on god's way
[1:17:56] our place of worship and the only place
[1:17:59] that you can worship him the only place
[1:18:01] he'll ever meet you they've got is one
[1:18:03] church one place one time one people and
[1:18:06] all that god meets and it's i hope that
[1:18:08] the lord blesses the message to your
[1:18:11] heart
[1:18:12] now
[1:18:13] coming to tucson
[1:18:15] it was strange
[1:18:17] those visions speaking to you in the
[1:18:19] name of the lord not one of them as i
[1:18:21] ever can recall
[1:18:23] blast anyone else they could recall any
[1:18:26] time that he ever did say anything but
[1:18:28] what was the truth it always happens
[1:18:31] just the way he says it will happen
[1:18:33] and he's supposed to according to the
[1:18:35] scriptures return to us in this last
[1:18:38] days and this type of ministry
[1:18:41] that'll be after the baptism of the
[1:18:44] spirit and speaking in tongues and
[1:18:46] divine healing and so forth these things
[1:18:48] the capping of the pentecostal message
[1:18:52] is what we're speaking of today
[1:18:55] this ministry of the
[1:18:57] christ himself impersonated among his
[1:19:00] people with the very same things that he
[1:19:03] did when he was here on earth
[1:19:05] in his body the bride which is part of
[1:19:07] him
[1:19:08] doing the same things his husband and
[1:19:11] wife are king and queen just before the
[1:19:13] marriage ceremony this week the lord
[1:19:16] willing i wish to speak some on that out
[1:19:19] in uh our campaign here at the embassy
[1:19:22] hotel
[1:19:23] and
[1:19:24] kind of get acquainted and my humble way
[1:19:27] of doing it the
[1:19:28] the time and the hour that we're living
[1:19:32] if a person don't know which way to go
[1:19:35] what to do or how to turn
[1:19:37] you're not walking by faith anymore
[1:19:39] you're just guessing
[1:19:40] you're pursuing
[1:19:42] and pursuing is to it
[1:19:44] to advance
[1:19:45] without
[1:19:46] official authority
[1:19:48] so if we haven't got the real official
[1:19:51] authority to know
[1:19:53] what god said would take place in this
[1:19:55] hour how are we ever going to face this
[1:19:58] hour
[1:19:59] and we've got to face it knowing
[1:20:01] by faith in his word the things that's
[1:20:04] supposed to be happening now and the
[1:20:06] condition of the nations the condition
[1:20:08] of the people condition of the church
[1:20:10] and so forth we got to know that and
[1:20:12] then how to walk out to face it
[1:20:15] if you don't know how to do that you're
[1:20:17] just
[1:20:18] just what we used to call kind of
[1:20:20] haphazardly just jumping hoping to be
[1:20:22] here hoping this and hoping that and
[1:20:24] will it be but
[1:20:25] god don't want us to do that he wants us
[1:20:27] to know what he has said about this day
[1:20:30] and then meet it by faith because he
[1:20:32] said it would be that way and we we know
[1:20:34] your truth then because you haven't got
[1:20:36] some person's word for it you got his
[1:20:38] word of what we must do and we're hoping
[1:20:41] that our heavenly father will will grant
[1:20:44] this to us this week
[1:20:46] now i'm sorry that i cut off of what i
[1:20:48] was saying a few moments ago
[1:20:51] about coming to tucson
[1:20:53] and
[1:20:54] i thought myself that it was the end of
[1:20:57] my life i thought no one could ever
[1:20:59] stand that shock of that condition that
[1:21:01] happened in that vision that morning
[1:21:03] about 10 o'clock at home that would ever
[1:21:06] be able to live after that well i come
[1:21:09] to tucson making arrangements with uh my
[1:21:12] son for my wife and
[1:21:15] and children to go with him after i was
[1:21:18] gone because i thought it was my end
[1:21:21] and i and phoenix demanded meetings
[1:21:23] before it happened i told you just how
[1:21:25] it would happen
[1:21:26] well
[1:21:27] a few months after that
[1:21:29] i was up in sabina canyon one morning
[1:21:31] which is just north of tucson i was up
[1:21:33] there to pray
[1:21:35] and while i was praying
[1:21:37] i had my hand up in the air and saying
[1:21:39] father i pray thee that thou will and
[1:21:42] somehow
[1:21:44] help me give me strength for the hour
[1:21:46] that i'm now facing
[1:21:48] and if my work is finished here on earth
[1:21:50] then i must come to you and it's not as
[1:21:52] i regret coming but i know that you'll
[1:21:54] take care of my family and i i'm just
[1:21:57] asking for strength for this hour and
[1:21:59] something struck my hand
[1:22:01] now radio audience this may seem strange
[1:22:03] i have said but it's the truth and god
[1:22:06] is my judge
[1:22:07] i looked at my hand and there was a
[1:22:09] sword uh had a sheath over the handle
[1:22:12] part and the handle itself was made of
[1:22:15] pearl this looked like kind of a
[1:22:17] gold-like guard over the handle part and
[1:22:20] the the knife itself looked rather like
[1:22:22] it was kind of shiny like
[1:22:24] oh something like chrome or something
[1:22:27] glistening in the sun
[1:22:28] now it's about 10 or 11 o'clock in the
[1:22:30] morning way on top of a mountain you can
[1:22:32] imagine how a person uh feel that i'm in
[1:22:36] my right mind would feel standing there
[1:22:39] with a sword from nowhere people for
[1:22:41] miles and miles holding that in your
[1:22:43] hand i felt of it tucked and waved the
[1:22:45] blade back and forth and why it was a
[1:22:47] sword and i looked and i said well now
[1:22:48] how could that ever happen here i am
[1:22:51] standing here
[1:22:52] right here and no one around for miles
[1:22:55] and miles and where did that come from
[1:22:57] i said well i i suppose maybe it's
[1:23:00] the lord telling me it's my end time and
[1:23:03] a voice spoke and said this is the sword
[1:23:05] of the lord
[1:23:07] and i thought well a sword then is sent
[1:23:10] for like a king tonight you know how i
[1:23:13] used to do in england and different
[1:23:15] places i thought that's what that is for
[1:23:18] tonight
[1:23:19] and uh i thought well maybe i'm supposed
[1:23:21] to lay hands on people over i had all
[1:23:24] kinds of human mind can be all messed up
[1:23:26] you know you don't know
[1:23:28] our minds is finite his is infinite so
[1:23:32] and as it then it left my hand and i
[1:23:35] didn't know where it went just
[1:23:37] disappeared
[1:23:38] well if a person didn't understand a
[1:23:40] little bit about spiritual things you
[1:23:42] you'd go crazy like that you'd be
[1:23:44] standing there wondering what happened
[1:23:46] and he said the vision is not your end
[1:23:49] time it's for your ministry that sword
[1:23:52] is the word
[1:23:53] the seven seals will be open those
[1:23:55] mysteries of and then two weeks after
[1:23:58] that or two months rather after that i
[1:24:00] was up in the mountain with a bunch of
[1:24:01] friends
[1:24:02] when it happened
[1:24:04] seven angels just as clear as you're
[1:24:06] standing here came sweeping down from
[1:24:07] heaven the rocks in the mountains rolled
[1:24:10] out and down the hills and people
[1:24:12] standing there was screaming and going
[1:24:14] on in order dust flying everywhere and
[1:24:16] when it was he said return to your home
[1:24:19] now will be each angel will be one of
[1:24:22] the seals of the seven seals which is on
[1:24:24] tape and the book will be out pretty
[1:24:27] soon then now it's kind of
[1:24:29] grammarized as you know my grammar is
[1:24:31] not very good people wouldn't
[1:24:34] you just have to be people that love me
[1:24:35] and know how to understand me on my
[1:24:37] grammar but uh some theologian is
[1:24:39] grammarizing for me and um
[1:24:42] taking out all the the uh well maybe i
[1:24:45] said the wrong word there i don't even
[1:24:47] know
[1:24:48] so i heard someone laughing so i guess
[1:24:50] that grammarize wasn't right
[1:24:53] but
[1:24:54] like the dutchman you take me for what i
[1:24:56] mean and not what i say baby and it's uh
[1:24:59] just uh three minutes now i'm told until
[1:25:02] the uh closing of the program now you
[1:25:05] dear people out in a radio land and use
[1:25:08] it sick and needy here in the audience
[1:25:10] would you just lay your hands on each
[1:25:12] other now while we have this word of
[1:25:13] prayer for the sake now jesus said his
[1:25:16] last commission to the church
[1:25:18] these signs shall follow them that
[1:25:21] believe
[1:25:22] them
[1:25:23] them that believe if they lay their
[1:25:25] hands on the sick they shall recover
[1:25:28] their heavenly father we're
[1:25:31] like children today we're obeying what
[1:25:34] you said do
[1:25:35] we are laying hands upon all these
[1:25:37] telephone requests
[1:25:39] thou seest them out in the land out
[1:25:41] there how they're needy the suffering
[1:25:44] you see those here that are needy
[1:25:46] suffering and we are committing them to
[1:25:49] thee dear god
[1:25:50] with this faith in thy word
[1:25:53] that thou hast said these signs
[1:25:57] shall
[1:25:58] follow them that believe
[1:26:00] if they lay their hands on the sick they
[1:26:02] shall recover
[1:26:04] granted lord in jesus christ's name amen
[1:26:10] [Music]
[1:26:15] thank you brother
[1:26:17] it's certainly a grand privilege to be
[1:26:19] back again
[1:26:21] on the broadcast to speak to some of our
[1:26:23] friends out
[1:26:24] and the radio land as well as present
[1:26:27] here
[1:26:28] and we're
[1:26:30] certainly extending this invitation to
[1:26:32] you to come to the embassy hotel
[1:26:35] tomorrow afternoon
[1:26:36] to be prayed for and not only that
[1:26:40] but to bring the ones that sinners and
[1:26:42] those who are backslidden if we just
[1:26:45] have
[1:26:47] a prayer for the sick and we do see god
[1:26:50] constantly doing great miracles but
[1:26:52] that's secondarily
[1:26:54] the main thing is to be saved filled
[1:26:57] with god's spirit which i'm going to
[1:26:59] speak to you about just in a few moments
[1:27:01] here
[1:27:02] and
[1:27:02] the sufficiency how that we must be
[1:27:05] filled with god's spirit and divine
[1:27:08] healing usually draws an attention to
[1:27:10] people
[1:27:11] and brings them in the presence of god
[1:27:13] when god does something
[1:27:15] that they know is on
[1:27:18] well it's
[1:27:19] not understood we cannot mechanically
[1:27:22] show how it's done god does it in his
[1:27:25] own great way
[1:27:27] then that attracts the attention of the
[1:27:29] people to know that there's a presence
[1:27:31] of a power somewhere that can do
[1:27:33] something as beyond human understanding
[1:27:37] and that causes them to look to the lamb
[1:27:40] of god
[1:27:41] and always divine healing
[1:27:43] i've been told and i believe myself that
[1:27:46] about between 60 maybe 70
[1:27:49] of our lord's ministry was on divine
[1:27:52] healing
[1:27:54] and he did that to attract the people
[1:27:56] then when they were there he said except
[1:27:59] you believe i am he you will perish in
[1:28:02] your sin
[1:28:03] now
[1:28:04] divine healing is a great drawing card
[1:28:07] to get people to look to the lord jesus
[1:28:10] and dr ff boss which many of your was a
[1:28:14] friend to and knew him
[1:28:17] and his ministry meant so much to me as
[1:28:19] a young minister
[1:28:20] i started out in my meetings now i run
[1:28:22] into brother bosworth
[1:28:24] he used to say divine healing
[1:28:26] it's a cruel little statement now
[1:28:28] he says divine healing is the bait on a
[1:28:31] fish hook
[1:28:32] that you never show the fish the hook
[1:28:36] you show you the bait
[1:28:37] and then he
[1:28:38] just adds the bait and gets on the hook
[1:28:41] so
[1:28:42] that's what we try to do that's our
[1:28:45] uh we our
[1:28:46] aim is to get people to the lord jesus
[1:28:49] christ and he's the same yesterday today
[1:28:52] and forever so if he was a healer in the
[1:28:54] days gone by he's the healer today
[1:28:58] uh just a personal testimony before i
[1:29:01] pray for the sick out in the radio land
[1:29:04] it was a few days ago i was setting up
[1:29:08] in a mountains where a great thing had
[1:29:10] taken place before
[1:29:12] a 15 or 20 breath are in there where the
[1:29:14] angel lord came so
[1:29:16] down and great light flying like a comet
[1:29:20] bursting around through the mountains
[1:29:22] and rocks flying for 200
[1:29:24] feet or more across there cutting the
[1:29:26] top of the trees out and i was standing
[1:29:28] right under and told him just a few
[1:29:29] months before it happened it would be
[1:29:31] there and what would happen frankly it
[1:29:34] was told the day before and all these
[1:29:36] men running under trucks and everything
[1:29:38] trying to get away they didn't know why
[1:29:39] it's taken place and he spoke and said
[1:29:42] what would take place
[1:29:43] right immediately afterwards sitting on
[1:29:46] this certain rock there right where he
[1:29:48] had appeared
[1:29:50] i had a friend that was with us
[1:29:53] that had come down from up minnesota his
[1:29:56] people are here this morning and i'm not
[1:29:58] sure but what he may be here on some of
[1:30:00] the other floors
[1:30:01] it was donovan works
[1:30:03] and a fine young fellow lutheran that
[1:30:06] had just given his life to christ and
[1:30:08] been filled with the spirit
[1:30:10] very humble german boy
[1:30:12] about 30 years old
[1:30:14] family two three little children he
[1:30:17] moved down to tucson just being
[1:30:18] neighbors with me were
[1:30:20] three or four hundred moved in to be
[1:30:22] neighbors so we i'm glad to have such
[1:30:25] neighbors as that they followed me
[1:30:28] always from south africa and everywhere
[1:30:30] around this to be near to see the
[1:30:33] with me and to be with me and enjoy the
[1:30:36] pleasures of the lord such a humble
[1:30:38] fellow i never
[1:30:40] noticed him very much of course the
[1:30:41] people i know and associate with are
[1:30:44] just like my own brother sister i watch
[1:30:46] them and see if i think they're getting
[1:30:48] out of line and take them out to one
[1:30:51] side and talk with them because i love
[1:30:52] them we want to live in glory together
[1:30:55] and sometimes maybe in the meetings you
[1:30:57] think i speak harsh to you that isn't
[1:30:59] from
[1:31:00] that isn't the cause that i don't love
[1:31:02] yet but it does come from my heart
[1:31:04] because i i it must be just one way
[1:31:07] there's only one way to serve god
[1:31:09] and we must stay in his way no matter
[1:31:11] what our thoughts is his way
[1:31:13] and i noticed donovan on the right
[1:31:16] tip of his ear
[1:31:18] was swollen perhaps three times its size
[1:31:21] and looked very red well not thinking
[1:31:23] maybe that there in the desert uh for a
[1:31:26] few days that where we've been maybe he
[1:31:28] had gotten some cactus in his ear
[1:31:31] but uh taking a hold of his hand i found
[1:31:33] out it was a cancer
[1:31:35] so i said to donovan i said donovan uh
[1:31:39] have you
[1:31:40] how long has that been on your ear just
[1:31:42] can't throw him off like i
[1:31:45] didn't know i said
[1:31:46] how long has i been on there at donovan
[1:31:48] he said brother branham about six months
[1:31:51] he said i said why didn't you mention it
[1:31:52] to me he said oh seems so busy so i
[1:31:55] didn't want to to do it said i just
[1:31:58] thought maybe sometime the lord might
[1:32:00] tell you
[1:32:01] so uh i said do you realize what it is
[1:32:03] he said i have a good idea i said that
[1:32:06] is right
[1:32:07] and the second morning no more than that
[1:32:11] holding the boy by the hand the second
[1:32:14] morning there wasn't even a scar on his
[1:32:16] ear
[1:32:17] it was all completely gone
[1:32:20] so many times we pressed
[1:32:23] and trying to get to this that er see
[1:32:26] [Music]
[1:32:28] it's
[1:32:29] these signs shall follow the believer
[1:32:32] it didn't say if they pray for the sick
[1:32:34] if they lay hands on the sick
[1:32:37] they shall recover
[1:32:39] we must have faith ourselves in what
[1:32:41] we're doing
[1:32:42] all right
[1:32:43] so now
[1:32:45] donovan is probably here you'll meet him
[1:32:46] he'll be here if he isn't here this
[1:32:48] morning on some of the other floors
[1:32:49] you'll meet him and he'll know the
[1:32:51] testimony
[1:32:52] and what more could i say as believe
[1:32:54] luke or john once said uh the world
[1:32:57] couldn't conhold

[1:34:22] [Music]
[1:34:30] well this is three times for me up here
[1:34:32] this morning
[1:34:36] and you know
[1:34:37] they're just told that we got to
[1:34:39] vacate the building in about 12-14
[1:34:41] minutes or something
[1:34:42] and
[1:34:43] the management said this on the other
[1:34:45] floor then they can't serve any meals
[1:34:50] our meals lengthened out we have many
[1:34:52] courses you know
[1:34:54] so we're very
[1:34:56] very glad that we have had this great
[1:34:59] spiritual gastronomical jubilee you know
[1:35:02] i would call it this morning here with
[1:35:04] this fine bunch a man i'd like to
[1:35:07] to make mention that we are
[1:35:09] the services again tomorrow afternoon or
[1:35:12] the embassy now we will be praying for
[1:35:15] the sick there and expecting god to meet
[1:35:17] with us and
[1:35:18] i've come to put in my part my ministry
[1:35:21] into making all that we can this meeting
[1:35:24] to be a success
[1:35:26] not a success because it's our meeting a
[1:35:28] success of people finding jesus christ
[1:35:32] that's a success any meetings no matter
[1:35:34] how much we praise god how many great
[1:35:37] things that we see him do how many times
[1:35:39] he speaks to us in the spirit and so
[1:35:42] forth unless
[1:35:43] there's something accomplished some
[1:35:45] souls brought into the kingdom
[1:35:47] and uh brothers carrying out we just
[1:35:50] made a
[1:35:50] real statement just now about what he
[1:35:53] thought about these days that we're
[1:35:55] we're living in i truly believe that
[1:35:57] with all my heart that we're living just
[1:35:59] at the closing time just in a
[1:36:02] just in the evening shadows the sun is
[1:36:06] far advanced
[1:36:09] and when we see things taking place the
[1:36:11] way they are today
[1:36:12] why it's hard telling what another
[1:36:14] generation would bring
[1:36:17] a few days ago just let me give you a
[1:36:19] little insight something
[1:36:21] uh they made an analysis throughout
[1:36:23] arizona where i live of all the schools
[1:36:26] that gave the children unknowingly to
[1:36:27] them
[1:36:28] a mental test
[1:36:30] and guess what including high schools
[1:36:32] and
[1:36:33] and grammar school there was 80 percent
[1:36:36] of the children suffering with mental
[1:36:38] deficiency
[1:36:40] seventy percent of them was television
[1:36:43] watchers
[1:36:45] the evils it just slipped up on us and
[1:36:47] we don't
[1:36:48] you wonder why it comes you can hear the
[1:36:49] voice of god screaming out against it
[1:36:51] yet here we we find ourselves webbed
[1:36:54] into it
[1:36:55] let me give you a
[1:36:57] shocking something
[1:36:59] see not all this says unto me lord lord
[1:37:02] will enter in but the one that doeth the
[1:37:04] will of my father his will is his word
[1:37:08] we can be ever so religious
[1:37:11] have great time shouting jumping in
[1:37:13] these meetings which we're
[1:37:15] i don't
[1:37:16] i don't want to be critical
[1:37:19] but i have a
[1:37:20] a duty to do to god
[1:37:22] and that duty is to be sincere
[1:37:25] and to say what he wants me to say
[1:37:29] and i'm i'm certainly grateful for the
[1:37:30] california chapter who's bore with me
[1:37:33] and and my convictions if i don't speak
[1:37:35] my convictions i'm a hypocrite
[1:37:38] i'm not i'm not even honest with you and
[1:37:40] if i can't be honest with you how will
[1:37:41] be honest with god
[1:37:43] because i'll see you and talk to you of
[1:37:44] course we do to god too but we got to be
[1:37:47] really sincere and honest with one
[1:37:49] another
[1:37:50] we are
[1:37:51] certainly in a
[1:37:52] a
[1:37:53] horrible horrible age
[1:37:56] and
[1:37:57] did you ever stop just let me give you
[1:37:59] just a little analysis
[1:38:01] not all that saith unto me lord lord
[1:38:03] will enter therein but the one that
[1:38:05] doeth the will of my father
[1:38:07] jesus said on earth man shall not live
[1:38:09] by bread alone but by every word
[1:38:12] every word not just
[1:38:14] now and then a word but by every word
[1:38:18] it was one word
[1:38:20] misbelief by gods of god's commandments
[1:38:22] that caused death sorrow and ever
[1:38:24] sickness and heartache
[1:38:26] to miss god's word one word
[1:38:28] if he'd taken the human race into death
[1:38:31] by this misbelieving one word surely
[1:38:34] surely but he said it would happen
[1:38:37] satan said surely it won't but it did so
[1:38:40] we've got to keep every word of god and
[1:38:43] if the human all this suffering and
[1:38:44] things that went on the human race by
[1:38:46] misconstruing or
[1:38:49] are misbelieving one word how we going
[1:38:51] back by missing one if it's cost all
[1:38:54] this price even the life of his son
[1:38:58] many are called you're chosen
[1:39:01] many are called few are chosen
[1:39:05] i can't take a text from this but
[1:39:06] because we haven't got time but just to
[1:39:08] leave something with you
[1:39:12] let us think of i went one day with
[1:39:14] brother shakarian you know when his high
[1:39:16] breeding cattle
[1:39:18] and i've seen the
[1:39:20] the in the laboratory where brother
[1:39:22] shakarian take him in and they
[1:39:25] in the sperm
[1:39:27] of the male cow uh just uh a little like
[1:39:30] a little instrument matched them
[1:39:33] and took up a bunch of that sperm and
[1:39:37] put it under this glass that magnified
[1:39:39] it hundreds of times
[1:39:41] and there was
[1:39:43] little germs jumping in that and that
[1:39:45] sperm which we know the germ comes from
[1:39:48] the male and the eight from the female
[1:39:51] and i asked the chemist there and i said
[1:39:53] what's that making that little jump like
[1:39:55] he said that's uh that's little bulls
[1:39:57] and calves
[1:39:59] see i said in that little drop he said
[1:40:01] yes
[1:40:03] i said perhaps then in the entire spurn
[1:40:06] there would be a million of them he said
[1:40:08] oh yes
[1:40:10] now watch close
[1:40:12] now
[1:40:13] when
[1:40:14] this
[1:40:15] great thing takes place
[1:40:18] there's one egg waiting for one germ out
[1:40:21] of that million
[1:40:24] and there's no one can tell which germ
[1:40:26] that is or which age that is
[1:40:28] if you'd watch the natural birth it's
[1:40:30] more of a mystery than the
[1:40:32] than the
[1:40:33] virgin birth
[1:40:35] because in the sperm
[1:40:37] there's one in there that's
[1:40:39] predestinated
[1:40:41] to live
[1:40:43] and the rest of them will die
[1:40:45] and it isn't the first one meets it's
[1:40:47] the first one that comes together
[1:40:49] with the egg
[1:40:51] maybe the egg may raise up from the back
[1:40:53] of the spur in the middle of the sperm
[1:40:54] the germ may do the same they the germ
[1:40:57] crawls into the egg and little tails
[1:40:59] drop off of it and there starts the
[1:41:00] spine
[1:41:02] there's only one
[1:41:04] and that whole load of a million that's
[1:41:07] going to make it
[1:41:09] only one
[1:41:11] and that's determined by some unknown
[1:41:13] forced demand
[1:41:16] that you're everyone alike
[1:41:18] every one of those germs are just a
[1:41:20] light same thing an animal same thing in
[1:41:22] man it's determined where it's going to
[1:41:24] be boy girl redheaded blackhead or white
[1:41:26] is determined by god
[1:41:30] all of them look the same naturally
[1:41:32] but there's one in there that's ordained
[1:41:34] to life
[1:41:36] one in a million
[1:41:39] yet all of them alike
[1:41:43] when israel left egypt there was
[1:41:46] approximately two million people
[1:41:50] left at the same time
[1:41:52] every one of them heard the message of a
[1:41:54] prophet
[1:41:56] every one of them saw the pillar of
[1:41:59] every fire
[1:41:59] of us baptized the moses in the red sea
[1:42:04] every one of them shouted in the spirit
[1:42:07] beat the tamarins and run up and down
[1:42:08] the bank with maryam when moses sang in
[1:42:11] the spirit
[1:42:12] there everyone drank from the same
[1:42:15] spiritual rock
[1:42:17] they everyone eat fresh manna every
[1:42:19] night
[1:42:20] every one of them
[1:42:22] but there was two
[1:42:24] made the land
[1:42:26] one out of a million
[1:42:31] what was the test
[1:42:32] they all drinking the same rock they all
[1:42:34] eat the same spiritual man as we eat
[1:42:36] this morning
[1:42:39] but the word test proved him
[1:42:41] when it comes to the time of katie
[1:42:43] sparnia when they start over into the
[1:42:45] promised land
[1:42:47] and they could not go over until they
[1:42:48] was tested by the word
[1:42:51] and all the
[1:42:53] the other
[1:42:54] ten came back and said we can't make it
[1:42:56] the people are like
[1:42:57] we're like grasshoppers to them they're
[1:42:59] great walls cities the opposition is too
[1:43:02] great but joshua and caleb steal the
[1:43:04] people
[1:43:05] they say we're more than able to do it
[1:43:08] why god said before they left the
[1:43:11] promised land i've given you the land
[1:43:13] i'll give it to you it's yours
[1:43:16] but there were
[1:43:17] one out of each million
[1:43:21] there's approximately 500 million
[1:43:24] so-called christians in the world today
[1:43:27] and each day ends a generation
[1:43:31] and now what if the rapture would come
[1:43:34] today
[1:43:35] and 500 people universally would be
[1:43:37] taken in the rapture
[1:43:40] you never know or even see in the paper
[1:43:42] them going
[1:43:45] and the coming of the lord is a secret
[1:43:48] coming
[1:43:50] you'll come and steal away you'll be
[1:43:52] such a minority
[1:43:54] so just like it was in the days when the
[1:43:56] disciples asked jesus why does the
[1:43:59] scribe say that that elias must first
[1:44:01] come he said he's already come
[1:44:05] and you never knew it
[1:44:07] did you ever think what the people did
[1:44:09] they went right on believing that
[1:44:13] elias was coming
[1:44:15] and he was right among them
[1:44:16] and they didn't know it
[1:44:19] so will it be in the coming of the son
[1:44:21] of man he'll do with him just the same
[1:44:23] thing
[1:44:24] the spirit of god is here
[1:44:26] well what are we going to do with it are
[1:44:28] we going to eat manna and so forth and
[1:44:30] not continually move up as we grow
[1:44:34] did you ever notice a seed
[1:44:36] as
[1:44:37] the reverend pitts was speaking a few
[1:44:39] moments ago
[1:44:41] and how seed goes into the ground
[1:44:44] many seeds are there in the ground
[1:44:47] when god moved upon the water with the
[1:44:50] light
[1:44:50] and light brought forth
[1:44:53] the first
[1:44:56] presence of god
[1:44:59] spoken
[1:45:00] light chained by god's word
[1:45:03] and god's word is the only thing that
[1:45:05] still brings light
[1:45:08] and when the waters went back the seed
[1:45:11] is already in the earth
[1:45:13] and the light only brought forth the
[1:45:15] seeds that
[1:45:16] remain with germ in them
[1:45:19] come forth god making his creation
[1:45:23] and now on easter morning there was
[1:45:25] another light struck the earth when the
[1:45:27] holy spirit was given
[1:45:29] and it's given
[1:45:31] to bring
[1:45:32] life
[1:45:33] to those seeds that god by his
[1:45:35] foreknowledge knew
[1:45:37] that would be here on the earth as he
[1:45:40] knew the first natural seed he knows
[1:45:41] where the spiritual season your body was
[1:45:43] laying here right down on the earth when
[1:45:45] god first brought the earth into
[1:45:47] existence we are a part of the earth we
[1:45:49] were laying there
[1:45:50] and by his foreknowledge he knew exactly
[1:45:53] who would love him and who would serve
[1:45:54] him and who would not
[1:45:56] his foreknowledge tells that
[1:45:58] if it doesn't then he isn't god he can't
[1:46:00] be god without being infinite and if
[1:46:02] he's infinite he knows all things amen
[1:46:05] so you see people making their blunders
[1:46:07] they stumble at it they run at it they
[1:46:09] think this and that but it doesn't work
[1:46:11] right we see it but there is a working
[1:46:14] right
[1:46:16] that's to find god's perfect will and
[1:46:18] standing in
[1:46:20] what god calls you for
[1:46:22] as brother jack said a few moments ago
[1:46:25] about down here at the the persian
[1:46:27] square
[1:46:29] all the confusion
[1:46:32] one this away in one that way and about
[1:46:34] the theologians and so forth that you
[1:46:36] want to know some theology go down there
[1:46:40] i guess that's just about like it is the
[1:46:42] hyde park in london
[1:46:44] i was down there everybody has his own
[1:46:46] idea it's a it's a conglomeration of
[1:46:51] of a modern day
[1:46:52] world in babylon
[1:46:54] amen
[1:46:56] but did you notice
[1:46:57] as brother pitts went on with his lovely
[1:47:00] message this morning to us
[1:47:02] as he began to walk out of the park
[1:47:08] there he found
[1:47:10] a little easter lily
[1:47:14] in the midst of all the confusion
[1:47:17] as he brought it to us that had no way
[1:47:19] to say yes or no
[1:47:22] it was a life of god shining in it in
[1:47:25] the midst of all the confusion
[1:47:28] it was there in its radiance because god
[1:47:31] had ordained it to be there
[1:47:34] in the midst of all the conflict no one
[1:47:36] was noticing it
[1:47:39] they didn't see the spiritual
[1:47:41] application of it
[1:47:43] and so easily today amongst all of our
[1:47:45] great gatherings and groups and churches
[1:47:48] and denominations and so forth
[1:47:50] one pulling this away we must be
[1:47:52] baptized and be presbyterian we must be
[1:47:54] this side of the other
[1:47:56] in the midst of all of it there is a
[1:47:58] growing flower
[1:48:00] there is a power of god right among us
[1:48:02] being raised right up in the midst of
[1:48:04] all of us
[1:48:07] let's just stop and behold it a few
[1:48:08] minutes
[1:48:09] and watch it this week and see it unfold
[1:48:12] right before us
[1:48:14] we believe god will do it don't you
[1:48:15] [Music]
[1:48:17] i see it we ought to be downstairs but
[1:48:19] now
[1:48:20] so let's pray each one of us
[1:48:25] dear god
[1:48:29] when we bow our heads
[1:48:31] in thy presence we are
[1:48:35] feel that we are so insufficient
[1:48:39] to ask
[1:48:41] but you promised us that if we would
[1:48:43] come you would not turn us down
[1:48:48] and these rude
[1:48:51] statements that's just been made
[1:48:54] by no means to be a doctrine
[1:48:56] one out of a million
[1:48:58] but just
[1:49:00] to kind of remember
[1:49:03] or you said straight is the gate
[1:49:06] and narrow is the way that leadeth unto
[1:49:09] life and few there will be that'll find
[1:49:12] it
[1:49:14] or many are called
[1:49:17] but few are chosen
[1:49:21] o eternal father
[1:49:24] send the gospel light across this city
[1:49:28] through this coming week of convention
[1:49:30] and if there be any seed
[1:49:34] somehow by your own great wise province
[1:49:38] like
[1:49:39] trying to illustrate it in the spurn of
[1:49:41] the male and female may they roll into
[1:49:44] the convention
[1:49:46] may the holy spirit give them life
[1:49:51] we realize that
[1:49:53] the time is perhaps later than we think
[1:49:55] it is
[1:49:58] we pray god that as we come here just
[1:50:01] believing that
[1:50:03] maybe there is something here that could
[1:50:05] be done that would help the people or or
[1:50:08] catch that last sheep
[1:50:12] we know when the sheep
[1:50:14] fold is full then the shepherd will
[1:50:17] close the door
[1:50:20] as it was like in the days of noah
[1:50:23] when the last member of the family was
[1:50:26] brought in god closed the door
[1:50:30] and they beat and pounded but
[1:50:33] it was too late
[1:50:36] dear god they had the opportunity
[1:50:39] you said i am that door to the sheephole
[1:50:44] and how striking the song
[1:50:47] from the poet
[1:50:48] are not ninety and nine enough for thee
[1:50:52] but no
[1:50:54] there was one more
[1:50:58] he might be a little black sheep or he
[1:51:00] might be a little nobody
[1:51:03] might be the little
[1:51:05] her he
[1:51:07] we don't know where they are but that
[1:51:09] last one must come in
[1:51:13] and then the door will be closed
[1:51:17] oh
[1:51:18] god who knows all things
[1:51:22] search our lives this morning and send
[1:51:24] us
[1:51:25] wherever that we could go that we might
[1:51:28] find that last one that the door will be
[1:51:31] closed
[1:51:32] and the shepherd inside with the sheep
[1:51:37] granted lord if there
[1:51:39] be that one here today
[1:51:43] if that one that's supposed to come in
[1:51:45] all the father has given me will come to
[1:51:48] me
[1:51:50] and no man can come except my father has
[1:51:53] drawed him
[1:51:54] and if there be a tug or a little
[1:51:56] feeling
[1:51:58] that this might be the hour for somebody
[1:52:02] here in this audience here are
[1:52:03] downstairs or wherever they may be may
[1:52:06] they answer yes lord
[1:52:11] i am that little wandering one that's
[1:52:14] wandered away
[1:52:15] it's fallen off all my life i i felt
[1:52:19] that i should come but today i'm hanging
[1:52:22] on the side of the peak
[1:52:25] i can't go up or down i can go no way
[1:52:29] oh may the great shepherd come
[1:52:31] reach down with tender hands and bring
[1:52:33] that one safely in
[1:52:36] place it up on his shoulders and bring
[1:52:38] it safely back
[1:52:42] maybe there is one here laura that's
[1:52:44] sick
[1:52:45] in a similar condition that the doctor
[1:52:47] said there's nothing can be done
[1:52:51] he tried hard to rescue it but
[1:52:54] he could not rescue it
[1:52:57] it's beyond his reach there's there's
[1:52:59] nothing that he can do his medicine or
[1:53:01] his knife cannot get to it
[1:53:05] oh lord
[1:53:07] there's nothing too far for your great
[1:53:09] arm
[1:53:13] and your word is your arm
[1:53:16] so we pray dear god that this morning
[1:53:18] while we are talking to thee that thou
[1:53:21] will reach down and pick that one up
[1:53:23] that's sick it cannot help itself out of
[1:53:26] the reach of all scientific
[1:53:28] uh matters
[1:53:30] away from the doctor
[1:53:32] may they be healed
[1:53:36] granted lord
[1:53:38] as we think of david as he
[1:53:40] was given a charge over a few sheep
[1:53:44] just a few
[1:53:46] but
[1:53:48] one day a bear come in and
[1:53:50] got that one little sheep and tuck it
[1:53:53] out and would have eaten up
[1:53:58] like a cancer would eat up a body
[1:54:01] our
[1:54:02] huge line
[1:54:05] but david not too well equipped
[1:54:09] with a a rifler and not a swordsman but
[1:54:12] with only a slingshot he went after that
[1:54:16] sheep
[1:54:18] and when he found
[1:54:20] the animal that was about to kill the
[1:54:23] little sheep he slew it with the
[1:54:25] slingshot
[1:54:27] just a simple little
[1:54:30] weapon with a piece of leather and a
[1:54:32] string and
[1:54:33] but he had confidence in it
[1:54:36] we have no great
[1:54:39] genius among us lord
[1:54:41] we're simple people
[1:54:43] with a simple little prayer
[1:54:46] but we're coming this morning after
[1:54:49] father's sheep
[1:54:53] that
[1:54:54] woman
[1:54:56] that has walked the streets miserably
[1:54:59] smoking cigarettes
[1:55:01] trying to find
[1:55:02] peace through the cigarette
[1:55:05] that man who has smelt the glass
[1:55:09] and tries to set it back
[1:55:12] but the enemy
[1:55:14] holds him tight
[1:55:16] that boy or girl that's tried to do
[1:55:19] right
[1:55:20] just can't find strength to break away
[1:55:22] from the wrong thing
[1:55:24] we come in the name of the lord jesus
[1:55:28] to claim that sheep this morning
[1:55:31] we defy the enemy
[1:55:33] because it's a simple thing a slingshot
[1:55:35] of prayer but we're coming to bring that
[1:55:38] one back to the father's home
[1:55:42] that we might give an account of those
[1:55:44] things that's been committed to our
[1:55:46] hands
[1:55:47] may the power of god now strike faith
[1:55:50] down in the hearts of the people
[1:55:52] and may that lost soul return this
[1:55:54] morning may the temptations of this life
[1:55:57] turn him away
[1:55:59] let him go
[1:56:01] may he find himself
[1:56:04] safely upon the master's shoulders being
[1:56:07] carried back to safety again
[1:56:10] we asked it in jesus name
[1:56:12] amen
[1:56:16] god bless you all
[1:56:18] i'll see you tomorrow i'll turn this
[1:56:19] service to brother chicarion
[1:56:22] this
[1:56:23] i hope that you
[1:56:25] that i found more grace than the sight
[1:56:27] of god and before you to believe that
[1:56:29] i'd stand here
[1:56:30] to tell you something that was wrong
[1:56:33] i was past my 56th birthday the other
[1:56:35] day
[1:56:38] this isn't just an old man's message
[1:56:40] i believe this since i was a little boy
[1:56:43] and if this isn't true i've been the
[1:56:45] most foolish person god had on the earth
[1:56:48] i've given my entire life for this cause
[1:56:51] and may i say this with sincerity if i
[1:56:53] had ten thousand lives i
[1:56:56] never changed my opinion
[1:57:00] now
[1:57:01] healing is in reach of every person
[1:57:05] remember healing is in you
[1:57:09] god placed in the peach tree every peach
[1:57:12] that would ever be in it when he planted
[1:57:15] it in the garden
[1:57:17] see you just the peach tree of the apple
[1:57:20] tree the fruit tree just has to grow
[1:57:22] from drinking the water in the earth
[1:57:25] now each one of you
[1:57:28] has those potentials in you to deliver
[1:57:31] you or it is god since you've been
[1:57:34] planted into christ
[1:57:37] by baptism
[1:57:38] not water baptism spiritual baptism
[1:57:41] you don't come into christ by water
[1:57:42] baptism by spiritual baptism tomorrow
[1:57:44] afternoon the lord willing i'm speaking
[1:57:47] on that how and what is the real
[1:57:50] application of it we have in the
[1:57:52] afternoon so we'll interfere with any of
[1:57:54] your services
[1:57:56] now look
[1:57:57] each one of you here is standing as
[1:57:59] believers
[1:58:01] see then the life that was in christ is
[1:58:04] in you
[1:58:07] okay if you could just sit it's a
[1:58:08] devil's business keep you blocked off
[1:58:10] from that keep you blinded
[1:58:12] penis let you be blind and that's see
[1:58:14] you don't know where you're going then
[1:58:16] a man that's blind cannot tell where
[1:58:18] he's going
[1:58:19] he's got to seek
[1:58:21] the understanding from somebody who can
[1:58:25] see
[1:58:28] until we can understand somebody's got
[1:58:31] to tell us what's truth and christ died
[1:58:35] for you and you are transplanted from
[1:58:38] the world into christ and everything you
[1:58:41] have need of is right in you by the
[1:58:43] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:58:45] isn't that right
[1:58:47] now the only thing you have to do is
[1:58:48] just start drinking from that as the
[1:58:50] tree drinks it begins to push out its
[1:58:52] leaves its buds pushes out its fruit
[1:58:55] each year the fruit's not in the ground
[1:58:58] the fruit is in the plant
[1:59:01] how many understand that say amen
[1:59:04] the fruit is in the plant and every
[1:59:07] plant
[1:59:08] has to drink from his fountain
[1:59:11] as a rain comes down gives that plant
[1:59:14] life to drink from and as it drinks it
[1:59:17] grows
[1:59:19] it's growing up until it comes to the
[1:59:21] full blood just like the church has
[1:59:23] to bloom out in this age
[1:59:26] and as we drink we grow
[1:59:28] if the plant refuses to drink then the
[1:59:31] plant cannot grow
[1:59:33] and if you just believe it
[1:59:35] now individually of course you know how
[1:59:37] the lord does show different things of
[1:59:39] what you've done and what you should not
[1:59:41] have done and so forth in the meeting
[1:59:44] was hoping that the holy spirit would
[1:59:46] fall upon us this morning and do such
[1:59:48] as we stood by kept waiting i think it's
[1:59:51] a nervous part thinking it downstairs to
[1:59:53] hold us out of here see but
[1:59:55] they're wanting us we're late now but
[1:59:57] believe this with all your heart please
[1:59:59] do if i if i found grace in your sight
[2:00:02] as a truthful person
[2:00:04] believe this
[2:00:06] i'll put your hands on each other now
[2:00:09] look now the bible didn't say these
[2:00:11] signs will follow william brown
[2:00:13] didn't say the follower or roberts only
[2:00:16] didn't say the father brother copper or
[2:00:17] somebody these signs shall follow damn
[2:00:20] plural
[2:00:21] that believe
[2:00:23] if they lay their hands on the sick they
[2:00:26] shall recover
[2:00:28] it's that power of god that's in you
[2:00:31] that brings to life
[2:00:33] to the person you got your hand on the
[2:00:36] life giving source of the holy ghost
[2:00:39] dear god
[2:00:41] in the name of jesus christ in this
[2:00:44] crucial moment
[2:00:46] when the church
[2:00:47] may they stand at this second without
[2:00:50] nervousness
[2:00:51] may the power that raised up christ from
[2:00:54] the grave quicken
[2:00:55] to them just now the truth of the gospel
[2:00:59] that jesus commission was if they lay
[2:01:01] hands on the sick they shall recover may
[2:01:04] ever demon power ever sickness every
[2:01:08] disease every affliction every
