that the name of the Lord is a strong tower the righteous run into it and they are saved and Lord we know there's no name given on Earth or under Heaven by which men can be saved except that of the Lord Jesus Christ and Lord we're gathered here in that name today Lord as Christians we're identified with Christ we are christ-like and it's because of your goodness and your grace Lord your life-changing power Lord that you came and you sought us out and you put a call in our heart that said that's me that sounds like home Lord and then you did a work in our lives that made us live a life that was pleasing to you but Lord we're not out of here yet and so we've come in once again Lord to hear your word to strengthen us Lord to encourage us to correct us Lord to draw us closer to you Heavenly Father Lord to make the very shine and draw of this world just fade away Heavenly Father Lord as we speak tonight and as we hear Lord may we just draw closer to you we pray Lord bless your people under the hearing of your word we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray it amen amen God bless you if you would turn to Second Timothy chapter four and we welcome sister Delfina back from her trip to Alberta for the Chad's here on a Wednesday night praise the lord it's a rare treat it's funny Wednesdays usually is when we have our least and I think that's the most we've had in a while just with the different things travel and sickness and whatnot so it's good to have him here and then of course we've got sister Betty sitting back there as well so praise the lord it's good to see her and brother Gerald with her amen I believe they announced that brother Dwayne Fair will be here next weekend and it's his anniversary weekend he or week he's coming in on his anniversary and he was hoping to get somewhat of a break so I said how many are you willing to do how many services will you preach he says I'm your servant I'll preach as many as you want and I said you'll preach three services so I took full advantage of that it's been about six months since we've been able to bring somebody in so I believe the Lord will bless us with a visiting minister so pray keep him in prayer he's got a lot going on this weekend and then of course he flies out Monday and he's gonna or Tuesday and he'll spend a couple days with his wife here alone and then he'll he'll meet up with us and come Minister but keep him in prayer keep the services in prayer amen that God will just bless and anoint them amen I meant second Timothy 4 verse 2. this is Paul speaking to Timothy he says preach the word be instant in season out of season reprieu reprove rebuke exhort with all suffering and Doctrine for the time shall come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables amen God bless his word you may be seated amen welcome my friend Roy sitting back there as well it meant good to see him again amen I wasn't quite sure if we were going to take another service on on this little mini-series I've been doing and I had lots of notes but I just wasn't sure and so anyways as I sat down and was praying about it and and just started reading through it I said I just felt led to go in it so we're going to continue this this this and this will be the final service on the characteristics of a seduction and the characteristic characteristics of a seduction and I know last service I shared a lot of things about myself about the calling of the ministry and the the pressures and the influences that can come along those ways and I share those things why so that you understand we're not above it we're not above the seduction of Satan we're not above the seduction of men that were not above these influences that are out there that are trying to get us away from the will and the word of God and he'll do it to each and every one of us and so if he'll do it at the at the minister level he'll do it at the father level he'll do it at the mother level he'll go all the way down to the children he has no no mercy for age or for gender he's looking for every single one that professes who is a Christian and he's going to go for them and he's going to try and get them to get out of that will of God and we know Satan doesn't have to go looking for where we are does he all he has to do is he has to come look where the preaching of the word is and there he knows that in some somewhere in there there's going to be a believer it might not all be Believers but he knows if you're sitting under the preaching of the word somewhere then you're looking to become a Christian or you're looking to be a Christian and so he knows where to place his attack amen listen he doesn't have to wonder who's in and who's out he'll know just by the very attribute of where you're sitting tonight whether you profess to be a real Christian or not it's that simple if Christian will sit under the hearing of the word they've got to because that's how they're fed that's how they they grow in Grace and these different things but I want you to understand something that when you come in these doors potentially this is where you'll face some of the biggest attacks Satan is here in every service trying to distract you trying to get you to twist something trying to get you offended at something trying to get you bothered by something trying to distract you from getting what God has for you in each and every service the prophet of God will put it this way he says remember today that every person leaving this door this back door out here either leaves with the mark of God or the mark of the end the apostate Church you say Oh Brother Brad him I go he says that doesn't have to do one thing to do with it the devil goes to church he's very religious the Bible said so in fact it says in the scripture that at the end he sits in the temple of God being worshiped as God by people that think they're worshiping God in the first place so Satan is not only trying to take the place of God but he's in a religious place and he is a religious spirit that's trying to infect the Believers that's what he is is he's a religious spirit we're talking about seduction and a seducing Spirit as far as we're concerned is a religious spirit that is the greatest deception we'll face it's not something physical it's not something mental but it's something religious that's trying to get us away from what it means to truly be a son or a daughter of God and listen one of the simplest seductions that Satan has is he says because you've showed up to church today you're good as if somehow showing up here is the check mark that proves that you are a son or a daughter of God and that's all you really need to do this week but listen going to church sitting under the preaching of the word wherever that might be is our reasonable service that's just Basics that's just Basics that's no different than reading your Bible and praying and these different things that is expected of a child of God so the fact that you do it does not make you a child of God but a child of God will do it it's just the nature of a Believers to sit under the hearing of the word because it does something for them that they can't get from anything else there's something special that happens when the word of God is going forth he says listen here men and women now my friends and Christian friends if the only thing that you know about is just simply coming to church you stop that right now stop just thinking you're all right if you've got an imaginary mind and say well I believe I'm saved and you see that you're always picking fusses or you're always griping about something there's something wrong with you if you see you just can't keep enmity out of your heart he says if you see there is something like that he says there's a seducing Spirit there's an enticing Spirit there's a problem if all you're saying is I'm going to church and I'm okay and then he says you're just causing trouble every time else you come to church and you're a Christian and you walk out the door and you're no longer a Christian what happens something isn't happening in church that's happening in your life it's supposed to be consistent in these things I was talking to a brother about this topic this week and he said I guess you're going to spiritual seduction next and I said yes that's exactly where we're going because that's all that's left and I want to repeat to you spiritual seduction means that a religious spirit will try and get on a child of God and if he can do that it makes you think that you're doing what you're supposed to be doing it makes you think that you're more than you are it makes you think you're right with God and you're actually walking away from God on a daily basis whether it's one step a day or five steps a day or whether you're running it doesn't matter a religious spirit it twists your mind to make you think that you're okay with God listen I read that quote because brother Brown's warning us he's saying don't relax just because you're in church don't relax because you're in a good church don't relax because you're sitting under a good Ministry that stays with the word he's saying keep your guard up because that is not what's going to make you a believer a Believer will do it but that's not what it's all about you've got to be on your guard because Satan will now come in here and you sit under the hearing of the word and what he's trying to do is he's trying to intercept it between it hit the time it hits your ear and it goes through your mind and gets to your heart if he can stop it here and put a Twist or add a word or take it away or just make it not quite the way it's supposed to be then by the time it comes down to your heart it loses its power because it's not original it's not pure it's not complete you need the full word of God to have the full Victory we're looking for a full restoration of the word in this hour and that's what came to us because we needed a full restoration to have the full effect because through 2000 years since Christ died what happened was he built up the church under the the baptism of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost and then they fell from their first love and they went down down down and the power went out of the church not just to live it but to prove it they lost everything and there were only a few Witnesses in the Dark Ages and these different things but now through Luther and Wesley and coming back into Pentecost and now the bride age what he's doing is he's restoring the fullness of the word so that he can have the fullness of the word where in our lives if Satan can stop it right here and never let it get here so that it comes out of your life you're under a religious spirit and he's got you fooled because you're saying amen but amen amen means so be it that means it's got to come out of you not just into you amen is not saying I agree with that a man is saying I agree with it enough to let it have an effect in my life that's what we're looking for these days amen the word we read before in in previous Services is an All or Nothing proposition you're either in or you're out if you're half in you're out if you're three quarters in you're still out you've got to be all in or all out like we said there's no drunk sober man you're either drunk or you're sober and there is no middle ground there is no middle ground in these things listen we had to have this Bible opened up to us because Christ said I am the way the truth and the life and what do they do on the day of Pentecost they showed them the way and when they accept they saw the way they accepted the truth and that truth LED them into life and that's what we've got to do is we've we have a message we've been given an end time message and we look at it and we say that's the way and then we say that's truth and I believe it but will it become life because if it doesn't become life we're under a religious spirit no I'm not saying that if you don't have life today that you're not a child of God I'm just saying there's more for you and there's more for me that's where we're at amen is we've got to look at our lives and say are we being restored back to what it really means to be a full child of God a son or a daughter of God listen it's all Christ he said I'm the way the truth and the life it's all Christ whether whether he's revealing himself to you as an unbeliever as a new believer or as a fully seasoned believer it's all Christ and he's restoring us back to reflect him to reflect the word that he's given us in this agent in this time but I want us to see how Satan seduces us spiritually because I want to bring it right home you know me even if we're preaching on Mysteries we want to bring it back to where it affects us we don't just want to have an intellect of it an intellectual conception of it but we want a reality in our lives every single day so I want to talk about our personal walk today and and just maybe shine up the armor and sharpen up the sword a little bit this evening to just see where we're at because I don't want this to be a service where we look around at everyone else amen I want to look at myself and believe me in studying this and reading through it in that you do a lot of introspection because that's what the word is supposed to do you understand even in communion the idea is that you judge yourself so that nobody else has to jump you judge you so that God himself doesn't have to judge you because you're taking the word and you're running your life through it as a filter and then you say that needs to be adjusted that needs to be changed and that's what the preaching of the word is doing is showing us where we need change sometimes it's affirming and that's good but we're mostly here to be corrected to be told what's right so that we can come to God for those changes so Paul starts with Timothy and he says preach the word be instant in season out of season what does that look like brother John it says reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and Doctrine and Paul's talking to Timothy says Timothy you've got to be focused you got to know what it means to be a minister and this is what it means to be a minister Timothy this is what I need you to do until you can't do it anymore and he's saying preach it and preach it straight preach it all don't leave anything out he says and go until they've got it that word reprove means to convict to tell of one's fault to bring to light and to expose how many of us want that no we don't want that do we but if you want to be right with God you've got to go for it you've got to be willing to sit under preaching that will do that rebuke we think of that as what we do to our children we they do something or they're not acting right and we rebuke them we're we're sharp with them and the word means to censure or admonish sharply or to correct he says Timothy you've got to convict them and then you've got to admonish sharply you've got to correct them then he says exhort so this now switches it and that means to beseech to entreat to plead to beg so the preacher can't be beating you all the time he's got to be begging he's got to be pleading he's got to be standing in the Gap he's got to be pulling you to the word as well sometimes he's got to use a carrot and sometimes he's got to use a stick but it can't be all stick and it can't be all carrot because it's got to be reproved and rebuke and exhort all of it's got to go together how long Timothy how long do you do this he says with all long-suffering that that means with patience with endurance with constancy with steadfastness with perseverance do it and do it and do it and do it he gives him no else for if you're tired if you're worn out if you're weary if you're offended if you're sick he says do it and do it and do it and do it because that's what a preacher does is he preaches the word keep going Timothy keep going how or with what what do you preach about he says with all long-suffering and all Doctrine in other words teach it all Timothy don't leave it out preach the Mysteries preach Faith preach Deliverance preach healing preach correction preach all of these things don't leave it out give them the full package and lay it in their laps so they know what they're supposed to do he says don't ever slack because it's unpopular stay with it I pulled this up in the Amplified Bible and this is great because the standard scripture is often not so easy to understand but in the Amplified it says preach the word keep your sense of urgency stand by be at hand and ready whether the opportunity seems to be favorable or unfavorable in other words whether it is convenient or inconvenient whether it is welcome or unwelcome you as a preacher of the word are to show people in what way their lives are wrong correction shows you what's right and now it's up to them to compare that to where they are I'm not here to tell you where your life's wrong I'm here to tell you what's right and then you can judge yourself where your life is whether it's right or wrong he says and convince them rebuking and correcting warning and urging and encouraging them being on flagging and inexhaustible impatience and teaching that's a preacher that's a man I want to hear somebody that'll give me the straight goods and give me the whole package and leave nothing out whether he knows I'm going to like it or not that's how you know he's a real preacher is he'll tell you whether you'd like it or not but it's got to be the truth it's got to be in the right context and it's got to be with the right attitude the right motive and objective that's what it's about and Timothy was was a favorite of Paul's and Paul Paul had ordained Timothy and he was a special one to him but he's saying Timothy you got to do it all or you're not going to be effective and you can't die out you can't you can't quit you can't slow down for any reason he says you've got to go go go but I want to jump back because that's second Timothy 4 if we look at second Timothy 3 he tells him why you've got to do the whole package and he says here in verse 16 of second Timothy 3 he says all scripture is given by inspiration of God that is our absolute and that's why it's our absolute set we believe that everything in here is correct it's that simple and that is our absolute and so whether you're from the coffee family the curlette family from the the Collins family or the Walsh legger family it doesn't matter when we come together this is our absolute not what I think and not what you think this is what we go back to and where there's conflict we go back to this not to whose friend is is whose friend or who's got influence or who's in an office this is where we go back to resolve conflict if there's a difference of opinion this is the absolute so he says Timothy all of scripture is given by inspiration of God he says and it's profitable that means it's good for growth it's for our benefit it's good for us what is it profitable for what's it good for for Doctrine now we love Doctrine because of times it's attached to teaching it's attached to the Mysteries it's attached to all these things and it's easy for us to absorb intellectually Doctrine is simple for most Believers to accept but then he says it's also profitable for reproof now that's not so fun anymore because doctrine's a whole lot easier to take but he says it's it's anointed its purposes for reproof as well and for correction you know what happens when people don't want correction they keep saying preach the doctrine but don't look at my life but it's good for correction too brothers and sisters he says them for instruction and righteousness now that sounds wonderful instruction and righteousness I'd love to have a class on instruction in righteousness 101 but you know what that word means it means if you look at it in the original word it means nurture instruction and chastisement it is the whole training of children so it will this word is given it's inspired and it's profitable to take you from a nobody in Christ to a fully mature adult in Christ it's good for the whole thing so whether you're a babe in Christ whether you just come to him whether you've been with him for 20 years or whether you've been on with them for your entire life and you're ready to cross over to the other side this word is good for you from start to finish and it'll keep you growing and moving forward he says why that the man of God may be perfect perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works listen if you'll take the doctrine if you'll take the proof if you'll take the correction if you'll take the instruction in righteousness then you'll be perfect meaning mature and you'll be furnished you'll be built up you'll be you'll be blessed with you'll be given the things that make you able to do what God wants you to do it says you'll be thoroughly furnished unto all good works good works are not things that we think are good because there's only one good and that's God good works meaning you're doing his will not what you think is good but what he wants you to do that is good and that doesn't always look good to the world but it's in his eyes that we it's him we answer to not to the world we don't answer to social media we don't answer the world opinion we don't answer to politics we answer to the word of God Amen I read that quote in this first series on this service where brother Bram said that if we come to church for anything less than the growing God we've misled ourselves and we fooled ourselves into why we're here listen I want to say if something touches you today and it's an area of your life that's sensitive or it's private or you don't think that I ought to be saying anything about it let me just say that's what we're here for and anything I say today if it touches you that way I'm not picking on anybody I've got enough to deal with on myself to try and go pick on somebody but I do have to preach the full word and that means it's going to be uncomfortable for me at times it's going to be uncomfortable for you at times but I've still got to preach the full word like he told Timothy do amen so I want to read that quote again he says that's what we come to church for is to find out where our faults are and the things that we might better ourselves by if we come to church for any other objective than this I'm afraid we won't get too much out of coming to church we must come to find out our weaknesses find our bad places and see how little we are and then I said he says and put our trust in somebody that's strong that's what takes the sting out of it amen I've said it many times don't run from conviction conviction is of god conviction tells you what is right it shows you where you're wrong and then it shows you how to get from wrong to right God always gives you a way of Escape he always shows you the path he always opens the door for you to go from wrong to right Satan on the other hand will give you condemnation condemnation tells you where you're wrong how it's your fault how you can't do anything about it and it leads you to a place where you quit that's what condemnation does is because it doesn't give you a way out it doesn't show you the grace of God it doesn't show you the mercy of God it doesn't show you that there's power to change you from wrong to right but conviction will do that and it's there to tell us that we need to go someplace else that's what it's there for amen listen Satan wants us to quit conviction is there to tell you I care about you enough to let you know that there's a higher plane than where you're at today but at the end of this when Paul is telling Timothy to preach the full word he says here's why Timothy he says for the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lusts they shall Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn their ears turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned into fables so we have two things happening here and it's forming the perfect seduction because the perfect seduction is when somebody wants what the other person's offering it's the perfect sales job is when your product sells itself listen when it's 25 or 30 degrees in the middle of August you don't have to work to sell ice cream you say I've got ice cream and people will hand you money they'll throw their money at you to get your ice cream why because you're offering what they already want you don't have to convince them that ice cream will cool you off that it'll feel good that it'll taste good they're going to buy it now more likely in Newfoundland what you're looking for is a hot latte because it's cold and it's windy and it's raining it's wet and guess what in the middle of the winter Starbucks does a booming business because everyone wants their hot drink they don't have to work to sell in Starbucks in the winter because everybody wants to be warm and so the perfect seduction here is that people want ministers they want teachers they want speakers to say what they want to hear and those men are perfectly willing to do it so it's a perfect seduction the problem is one of them doesn't know that what they want is going to hurt them and the other one's already damned in the first place so they want what the other person has but they don't realize the damage it's going to cost it's going to cause them amen so it says that what's going to happen to these people and these are not people out in the world these are professing Christians this is the word it's for believers it's for professing Christians it's not talking about the world it's saying that people that want to be Christians are going to go there and they won't take the full of the fullness of the word of God they'll only go so far into it and then they'll say that's far enough and they'll take enough to make them feel that they're a Christian and satisfy their religious inclination or obligation that's all it is is it's just scratching an itch but it's not solving the actual problem they won't take enough to change them they won't get uncomfortable that's the problem with it and that's how you recognize it is if you'll stop short of the word of God because you're uncomfortable then a religious spirit has seduced you and made you stop this is a highly uncomfortable Christian walk listen Jesus said they're going to throw you out of their their synagogues you're going to be beaten you're going to be bruised you're going to be kicked out of here you're going to be rejected and in the end they're going to kill you that was the promise to the to the apostles and do we think it's going to be any different the scripture says if we're going to reign with him we've got to suffer with him and we're going to face persecution and we're going to lose opportunities and our jobs will be affected in our relationships and even things within families will be effective because we've taken a stand for the word of God because it's something that's inside of us what's the driving force for these people their own lust their own desires their own preferences their own mindsets they're seeking an affirming voice rather than a correcting voice that's always the problem is if you're going to listen to people that agree with you you're never going to change and you're never going to really find the truth either listen if they can get a minister to say you're all right brother you're all right sister you're just fine where you are here's the hook God understands that's one of the greatest seductions you're ever going to hear church God understands where you're at God understands but he won't leave you in that condition listen he he's a he's a high priest he's an intercessor that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities he knows what it's like to be faced with temptation but he doesn't leave us in that place he doesn't give us an excuse for our weakness he says I can help you with that I can make a change in your life so God understands your heart he understands where you're at but he won't leave you there he's always drawing you to what he says in his word is the correct place to be listen to this he says are you born again are you born again tonight he says does your life cope with his word now that cope we don't mean like a coping mechanism something that that allows you to endure something or deal with something that word cope is if you look oh we don't have any Trim in here but if you're ever doing trim work you cope it you've got to cut it at a certain angle so that the two pieces will fit together perfectly he says does your life fit perfectly into the word does it dovetail with the word he said Do Your Action does your action does your life does your dressing does your behavior does your spirit does your faith all cope with the word of God he says then that shows the life in you is living Christ what is one of the greatest seductions you'll hear is God sees your heart and it's said in a way that makes you think that whatever you do is okay as long as what's in your heart is good we talked about Saul didn't we Saul had good intentions but he didn't obey the word of God fully and it cost him his kingdom amen listen the scripture says that God looks at the heart of a man he judges by our heart but he tells us he says buy your fruit you will know them because what's in will always come out I've read it in my devotions this morning where Jesus said what goes into US is not what defiles us but what comes out because he says out of the inside of you what's inside of you that's what causes you to do murderers and adulteries in line and all these different things he says there's something inside of you that's pushing you to do those things it's not the food you eat that's gonna going to cause you to fall away from God it's the thing that's in your heart already that's what's going to hurt you and James he says does a fountain send forth at the same place Sweet Water and bitter can your life produce Christ in something else simultaneously it can't it's got to be one or the other you're either in or you're out you're either Christian or you're not you're either a Believer or you're not so you can't say my heart is right and my actions are not something's wrong there Something's Happened to twist you into thinking that because you had a good intention then everything you do is going to be okay listen if God's in your heart God's going to come out of your life if disobedience is in your heart then Rebellion will come out of your life it's what we saw with Saul listen we think Rebellion means you're actively working against God listen Saul was 95 in compliance with the word of God I I picked that number listen he killed all of the the people except one and he killed all of the animals that he was ordered to except the good ones he just kept a few but he said but Samuel when he came to when the prophet came to him he said Saul you are in Rebellion because you didn't go all the way you did most of it but you didn't do all of it and that's where Rebellion lies in US is when we'll only go so far and say the rest doesn't matter and then God sees my heart that's what Saul said don't you understand why I did this don't you see my heart Samuel I did it so that we could sacrifice to God and Samuel said God doesn't want sacrifices God wants obedience God just wants obedience you're making this Grand gesture but he didn't ask for a grand gesture he just wants you to do what he asks you to do hey man listen in Saul's Rebellion he decided in his head that God didn't require full obedience to what God had said that's literally what he said that's literally what he thought and that's what he acted on is God didn't really mean it that way he's leaving it up to me he's giving me the option as to what I do here listen Jeremiah says the heart is deceitful Above All Things but John my heart's right your heart's not right this is right that's how you know your heart's right is what does the word say about what's in your heart but he says the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it in other words who can really know it who can really say what it is or it isn't listen you can have good intentions and still be wrong I've done it I'm sure we all have I've done it where you do something with the even the right motive and objective but it was categorically wrong according to the word maybe not a hundred percent wrong but just five percent Wrong five percent wrong is still wrong but you keep saying if you keep saying well look at my heart look at my heart I didn't mean it I meant well I meant well as if that excuses us from doing something that's wrong no wrong is still wrong it is what it is listen I was reading in Leviticus last night I don't know if anybody's read Leviticus lately but it's a it's a tough read but you know why it's a tough read is because it's so repetitive and it's repetitive because it's going into the offerings for everything that you have to do if you do something wrong and it didn't matter how rich or how poor you are there was always an offering you could make there was already always an offering you could afford to make things right between you and God but I was reading in Leviticus 5 and it's talking about the trespass offering now the trespass offering is what you do when you do something ignorantly you did something and you didn't know it was wrong or you did it without knowing you did it in the first place because back then they had issues where if you touch certain animals or certain things you could be defiled and you had to make that right it was very complex very stressful I'm sure but literally the trespass offering is before when you realize that you had messed up no matter your good intentions or your ignorance or your your you weren't doing anything on purpose it said you still had to go make it right and it starts out and it says you you know you can do a a bull or you can do a lamb or a goat and all these things but it says at the lowest end it says if you can't afford any of that it said take some fine flower it says and you've got to take that and you've got to go burn it as an offering but it says you can't add oil to it and you can't add frankincense to it now if you look in the other offerings if you look at the the the the wave offering that the offering if you if you wanted to give something to God he would say add oil to it add frankincense to it what he was saying was something you've given to me I'm going to add myself to it and it will be a blessing and the oil always represents the Holy Ghost it represents deity and frankincense is a sweet smell but when it comes to a time where you made a mistake and you didn't know it he says when you come to make it right don't try and spiritualize it don't try and add God into it don't try and say well the Lord led me to do it and that's why I did it and I was fooled no he says leave me out of it don't try and make it look better than it is don't try and cover it up don't try and make it sound or smell okay he says just let it be what it is and burn it and get it over with it is what it is don't try and blend God into your mistake so often as Believers that's what we'll fall back into is we'll try and blend a certain element of spirituality into what we did why because we're trying to get ourselves off the hook wrong is wrong if it's wrong by the word we're wrong no matter what we can't add God into our mistake he's outside of it he's outside of it amen listen I remember in Edmonton I think I was told this story many times but for the sake of Good Intentions bad actions one of my children wrote the word love l-o-v-e on the side of my car with a rock good intentions wrong wrong wrong wrong wrong sometimes we think we're loving and it ain't love it's just something we think it's just a feeling it's just an emotion it's not according to the word and then we sit back and say well my intention was right listen if it's wrong it can't be of God it can't be of God and it's that simple and we have to be able to do that we have to be able to just say I was wrong do you know what the sermon of my title of my first sermon was I am wrong that's the way I started my Ministry with I am wrong because remember brother Bradham said he said that the spirit of the laodicean age the final age is to repent because they have a religious spirit and that's what we're on guard against in all of this and that's what we're coming to in the service today amen but Paul said to Timothy he says lust desires preferences whatever you want to call it that's what get us in trouble because we can't pick and choose the word so you know what we do is we'll leave where the full word is preached and we'll go find a preacher that will only preach what we want to hear because we can't say I don't want to hear that so what we do is we go find somebody that won't preach it so that we don't have to just flat out say I don't want to hear that kind of preaching that's what we do that's how you pick a teacher that's how you show you have an itching ear is that you will refuse to hear somebody that preaches the full thing and go and pick somebody that preaches what you like but that's not the full word it's got to be the whole thing it's got to be the whole thing amen listen like I said we know better than to say yeah I don't like the fact that he's preaching from the whole scriptures so we just go find a minister that focuses on the things that we like and believe me there's plenty of it out there amen some people just want to hear about the promises of God some people just want to hear the Mysteries some people just want practical preaching some people just want Doctrine some people just want a minister that shouts the whole time some people want Evangelical Services all the time some people just want Lonnie Jenkins up here all the time not a single one of those is wrong in and of itself but if that's all you're getting out of it then you're going to be stunted in your growth because you're not taking the full word of it amen and you can look back and say well I like this church I like this ministry or this is the way it used to be or no no no you've got to take the full package and that's why we have a five-fold Ministry not a one-fold ministry that's why we bring in other Ministries so that you'll get something that I can't give you and I've got to be okay with the idea that I can't give you anything and then a pastor is to feed you day to day week to week but there's an entire fivefold Ministry out there that's here to bring us everything that we need and God has anointed them to bring it to us not just me not just the pastor not just the the team that's here amen listen I love a good shouting service I love a service where it's all worship and and praise and the and the people are enthusiastic and they're feeling blessed and and they're worshiping and thanking God for good things listen I love having Joe Adams up here and he preaches faith and faith and faith and Faith until you think you could walk on water and we've seen the benefits of that but we can't have Joe Adams all the time then you put up ilani Jenkins now I know he can't come up anymore but you put on Alani Jenkins and you're enthralled with the depth and the greatness of the word of God and and the carefulness of how he put things together and that teaching it just solidifies you and you understand finally who you are and why you are the way you are in these different things but then you go sit down in a brother Ron Spencer meeting and he preaches on battles and he preaches on Victory and when you're out there you're looking around for that demon that's been bugging you for the last year and you just want to punch it until it can't talk and you're ready to go and you're all fired up and then maybe you go to camp and brother Danny steaman's there and he preaches a service that's so completely takes away your barriers that are holding you back and you find yourself at the altar weeping and repenting and getting cleaned out and scoured out and you don't care about it you don't care that you're bubbling snot out of your nose and your face is red and all these different things why because the word of God is being preached in its fullness across the entire Spectrum that's why we have all these different men that's why we don't focus on one style or one Ministry or one church and these things is because God's got a full group of men that are anointed to defeat us to bring us to that Perfection to bring us to a resurrection and a Rapture amen listen this word is full of so many good things so many good things why were we limit it to just the one thing or two things or or things that we like there's so much in there and it's all good for us it all has an effect listen I'm excited when I get to sit there I haven't sat down yet in this church yet I'm excited to have a minister come because I can sit there and he can preach at me because I've got to listen to myself preach most of the time but if I can sit there and he can he can touch my life and God can get personal with me and God can walk into that service and say all right son I see you've got some complexes building up I see you've got some pride working in see you've got some issues in your relationships I see you got some knots in your fishing line and if I can sit there and receive it he'll resolve those things that's what makes him personal that's what makes him a personal God is when he gets personal with me that's what I want I don't want a God that just stands around and talks to everyone else I want a God that works in my life I want a God that comes and sits next to me in my Pew and says I think you're important enough to send a man from three or four thousand kilometers away to talk to you about this today that's the kind of God that I believe in that's the kind of God that I serve is he's personal because he gets personal because he doesn't leave me unchecked because he doesn't leave me unchanged he doesn't leave me unchallenged but he comes in and he looks at me and he says that's not going to work you got to come up to a higher plane amen listen it's not all going to be shouting services listen we like our our pizza and we like our burgers and our Pops and our chips but sometimes I've got to sit there and I've got to eat spiritual cauliflower and broccoli and worst of all brussels sprouts but that's what's going to keep me growing that's what's going to keep me healthy is not the stuff I like it's the stuff I don't like that's usually going to do me the most good so often we're looking for what tastes good going down no it's what's got something packed into it that's going to do the body good when it's finally digested amen listen we can't be here to satisfy our taste buds we've got to say what does the body need not what does the mouth want because otherwise we're being led by lust rather than what is actually supposed to be in our body listen we have a pregnant lady in our midst I guarantee you she's eaten some weird things in the past eight months you know why because God has built into her the ability to Crave what her baby needs what her body needs I had a friend in high school that she wasn't pregnant in high school but when she she finally got married and had a child she liked pickles dipped in chocolate pudding now you say what in the world could she have needed maybe it was the salt content maybe who knows but that was needed for her and it was the only thing that would satisfy and while she was pregnant she liked it but as soon as she was done pregnancy she didn't want pickles and chocolate pudding but for the moment that was exactly what she needed and she would eat it and she would enjoy it and it would have the effect that she was looking for in our life church I say that to say this don't run from God don't run from the preaching of the word don't run from the personal portion of your service tonight run to it don't run away from it let's not have shame or pain or embarrassment listen only you really know only you really know I think sometimes people think that whoever's preaching knows something I think most of the time we don't have a clue we don't even realize what we're saying sometimes you know my wife will tell me after service who so-and-so is probably not feeling very good that was a that's like I don't even know don't even realize it most of the time don't even realize it so nothing's personal here from my side of things but look at this the prophet would say the Holy Spirit guarded the tree of life until the atonement was made and now the holy spirit is running people to the Tree of Life Adam and Eve was trying to get to the tree of life he says now their children are trying to stay away from the Tree of Life the Holy Spirit was guarding it but now it's bringing them to it he says and they refuse they refuse to hear the holy spirit's voice because the same adversary that caused them to sin in the beginning is keeping them away from the Tree of Life he says in Jesus Christ is the Tree of Life notice they refuse refusal is a choice it's a choice scripture says choose life that you may live behold I put before you now a choice living or dying choose life that you might live we sing that song many times amen and Satan has seduced them to hear a different voice and what is it he's wanting you to get to the place where it only affirms you but it never corrects or changes you if all you want to do is come in and have us Pat you on the back you're not going to grow you're not going to change and you're going to get left behind in your Christian walk amen I love it when the older folks will come up after a service and say that touched my life you know why because it tells me that they're still growing they're still Towing the line they're still battling they're still in it to grow because we grow until we're gone we grow until we're gone there's no point where we get to sit down and say that's it I'm done listen Paul only said that just before he died he says I have run my course I've finished my race he says and now I'm ready for the for the for the for what awaits me on the other side and until that point Paul was continuing to push Paul is continuing to press second Corinthians 3 says now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty Church what does liberty mean to you tonight freedom to do anything freedom to be yourself that's what the world says today be yourself don't be yourself please otherwise you'll look like what the world looks like today and it ain't pretty don't be yourself that's what this Liberty is Paul says this Liberty this is what it does this is what it says it is but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of God are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord the Liberty he's talking about changes you into the image of Christ it sets you free this is a liberty that sets you free from influence it sets you free from your DNA it sets you free from your Traditions it sets you free from your pains from your hurts from your offenses it sets you free to grow it sets you free to change it sets you free to surrender to the word so that it can develop you into what you're meant to be amen in Isaiah 28 scripture says Whom Shall he teach knowledge and whom shall we make to understand Doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts he said for precept must be upon precept precept upon precept line upon line line upon line hear a little in their world little so in other words it's a building process and once he's got one thing established once he's got you grounded in One Thing Once he's got it where it won't move then he adds the next bit to it and then when that's established he does the next bit and it's one thing on top of another we talk about the stature of a perfect man and we start at the bottom with faith and knowledge and virtue and these different things brother Mark really helping with that when he said it's not it's not building you up in a pyramid it's building you out like a tree so you're expanding in in diameter as you grow up and you're adding those things and as you add them they help you to grow taller and taller they help you to mature to the point where you can bear and support fruit that's what the word of God is doing is it's growing us out and it's growing us up at the same time what is getting you to the place where you're going to be able to be used of God to be able to produce the fruit of the Holy Spirit love joy peace patience kindness all these different things look at Philippians 3. this is Paul he's speaking to of himself and he says Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended another this is the prophet of the age okay in other words he's saying I'm not there yet I don't have everything I'm supposed to have in my life I'm not everything I ought to be the prophet of the age is saying that so we ought to be able to say the same thing I'm not what I ought to be yet but I'm on the road there but I'm on a path I'm on a journey to go there but what does he do he says but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth under those things which are before getting those things which are behind burning all the bridges not watching your back Trail forsaking the things of the world even forgetting what happened in your Christian walk yesterday so that you don't hold on to it and keep yourself from going and for what he has today sometimes you've got to let go of that experience so you can have a new one because God wants to have a daily walk he wants to have a daily relationship not just a once a life once a week meeting and then he's looking to keep you moving and growing but Paul he says after all those things after I forget those things he says I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus the prophet of the age says I press once I've stopped forgetting I press Paul what are you doing today I press Paul you've got signs and wonders you've healed the dead you you you you've healed the sick you've raised the dead you've been almost killed multiple times you've been delivered out of this you've been delivered out of that Paul you're a great believer and yet I press I press and I press and I press why because there's something inside of me that says there's more there's something inside of me that says come up higher there's something that says you've got to keep going you can't stop you can't rest on your laurels you've got to keep moving forward and he says what am I going forward to the prize of the mark of the High Calling brother Branham would say he said he it is the highest ambition of a Christian is to do this and he says it's living for that great event the resurrection and the rapture Paul says until I have a resurrection until I'm a part of that Rapture nothing's going to stop me from pushing forward and a seducing Spirit the grand seduction will stop you from pressing it'll say you're good you're okay you don't have to try anymore you don't have to give up anymore you don't have surrender you don't have to Humble anymore you can stay where you're at you're at the peak of Christianity don't do anything else and it's a religious spirit you've got to keep pressing and pressing and pressing and pressing listen why your current condition is not raptured and the condition of the prize of the mark of the High Calling is raptured so until you're raptured or until you go on a resurrection keep pressing that's how we know we got to keep pressing we ain't raptured yet we haven't taken a body change we haven't gone to the other side amen that prize is to what to go in a Rapture of Resurrection seduction is always tied to satisfaction we speak of it physically where somebody wants intimacy from somebody else and they'll do whatever they want to get it but Paul said this perfect seduction is happening when the people have an inch and they want the ministry to scratch it so let me let me get you to realize this the grand seduction comes through the ministry that's the scary thing we're talking about here a religious spirit will come through the ministry and that's why you have to hold every Minister that comes up here accountable to this not to his gift he may see visions and dreams and he may he may heal the sick and do all the things that we have seen at different times perhaps but he is held accountable to this no matter what he's got to be held accountable to this listen you talk about slick and Sly basically the grand seduction of of Satan is to put the man up here under a spirit to tell you what you want to hear and if he can if he can pollute this up here then he'll pollute the rest of everybody that's listening to it that's why he targets the ministry so much because the influence that they have the impact they have is so much greater than most people will have on believers who do you trust more than a minister you'll tell things to a minister you won't tell to anybody else and Satan wants to get in there and break that trust and get that man to say something that he's not supposed to say or refuse to say something that he should say prophet of God says your church puts up with it your preacher is afraid to say anything afraid you won't pay your tithes anymore that's the reason that's the trouble he says my goodness how are you going to preach to a bunch of buzzards unless you get them converted and right with God to begin with they'll root their nose in dead stuff all the time what you need is a dumping out an old-fashioned Revival sweep from coast to coast and get men and women right with God let loose the things of the world let loose the petty soft soft pedaled preaching he says amen preach the gospel God said so if you love the world or the things of the world the love of God is not even in you that scripture is all you need to figure out where your heart is at it's so simple what do you love what do you love to do and where do you put your time and if it's something of the world then there's a problem he says people can jump up and down and shout all night long and speak in tongues like poor and peas on a dry cowhide and then walk right out the next morning with enough temper to fight a buzzsaw go right on out and tell something in the church that'll cause the whole church to be broke up it's nothing in the world but an enticing demon Spirits he says you want to come back to the word where God is Purity God is Holy amen he says that's right it's enticing Spirits versus the word of God what is it if a man won't preach the whole counsel of the word of God if he won't preach the full word of God if he won't give Doctrine and reproof and correction and nurturing and righteousness the people will always be stunted in their growth that's the effect because you need it all to be at all you need it all to be at all amen it keeps them from going into full maturity that's what Paul was saying to Timothy he says and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables the other scripture says elsewhere that they'll believe a lie and be damned by it having their conscience here with a hot iron the people will turn away their ears from the church truth they refuse to hear it they may get offended they may get tired they may get weary and when they get weary they get sick of it and then they go find somebody that'll tell them what they want to hear or the way they want to hear it sometimes it's not the content it's the delivery scripture doesn't talk a whole lot about how you're supposed to preach it just tells you what you're supposed to preach if you look around at the ministry that's why we have so many very gifts so many different ways of delivering it is because God has a beautiful garden of ministers that are out there to meet the needs of all of us and there's things that I might not be able to say to you that another Minister can come in and you can hear it from him and that's God's grace to you through that man that man is a gift to you to do those things listen don't get me wrong we need a balanced diet I spoke of that a few Services ago where I said I'm pretty good if you just tell me what to do I'll do it I'm okay with orders but not everybody's okay with just orders we need a lot of encouragement and and we need soothing and all of these things amen that's why we have to bring in these outside Ministries and that's why I've got such a focus on bringing in fivefold ministries because I know I can't do it on my own I'm not anointed to do it on my own more to the point I'm here to feed you day to day but we've got men out there that are meant to come in and make a difference as well now just as we start to close here tonight I want to I'm just going to touch on a few things that that we can kind of look out for and it's a pretty wide net that I'll cast here and and it's just to show you the varied approach that Satan takes and again we're not focused on anybody here as in I'm not personally he says now another thing that has taken place I believe and think that any man that's got an experience with God or a woman is bound to get a little emotional I just believe it that's right he says but you know what they've adopted emotionalism for the baptism of the Holy Ghost they just get a lot of noise and there's nothing in it he said you live just as holy as you live noisy then you'll be all right emotions is certainly all right then he says Bali exercise profit of little but enticing Spirits has got over into the Holiness group of people and they've got them to just resting upon because they can shout or because they can dance or because they can make emotion then he talks about that the the false prophets that came before aab and he says that old fellow down there the chief of all of those prophets the preachers he was so sure he was right he made himself a pair of horns and danced all around and make a bigger commotion and he was going to push the other Assyrian army right out of the country but it was a lie it was God's word it said different amen see you can be emotional right he says but you got the right kind of emotion moving your emotion in other words God's got to be inspiring your emotion David danced before the Lord and his wife laughed at him and God looked down out of heaven and said David you're a man after my own heart why his motives were right his life was right behind it so just because we can be emotional don't mean we're saved because we go to church don't mean we're saved he says don't believe those enticing spirits a real spirit of God a real word of God is the truth of God which is a seed of God which will produce God in your life and you'll be Godly saintly and holy now listen don't look at your life and say I'm not all of those things yet therefore I'm wrong no a seed when it starts to grow go through a process so the idea is are you different today than you were yesterday are you different this week than you were last week are you different this month than last month are you different this year than last year what matters is are you changing in the right direction not are you perfect not are you fully mature yet but are you going in that right direction seed implies a process and so that means changes will be seen if a seed is growing there's an effect that's happening and it's changing how that looks now listen us Canadians so you Americans you don't have to listen you for the next few seconds we're not done to be a shouting group this service to the to a contrary uh testimony this morning or this evening but Canadians aren't known to be a shouting group so I think we're okay to say this okay so brother Brown was saying live live as holy as you live noisy as loud as you shout he says let your life be as holy as as Sanctified to God as your shouting is okay we don't generally have to we don't we're not a big focus on shouting we have it we don't have it it is what it is you know but I'll let me take it to where we we do live and that is let's talk like we live let our conversation be a true reflection of where we're at he said actions speak louder than words no matter what you're saying your life speaks so loud till they can't hear your testimony as I said this morning said just jump as high as you live see your actions speak louder than your words and you might as well just come out and say it because your own words speak your own life speaks your words no matter what it is your actions speak of what you are so I'm not here to say don't shout I believe we need more shouting listen you get the Holy Ghost you'll shout at some point listen you get the Deliverance you're looking for you'll shout some time you see the provision of God you see the healing of God you see the grace of God in your life in a moment it'll cause you to shout it's got to happen listen it will come along with it because with relationship always comes emotion but he's saying let's not pretend the relationship is so high that the emotion is is where it's at today let's live let's have our emotions reflect where we are in our relationship amen listen if you're if you're waiting for my preaching style to make you shout that's not going to do it if you're responding to my voice or the way I deliver it that's not what it's about but it's when you realize that God is here and he's talking to you personally that ought to make us shout that ought to make us say Amen that ought to make us say praise the Lord because that's what is Supernatural is not my delivery it's God coming in and touching your life that's what we shout about that's what we praise about in these things what is it because in that that's the power of God through the Holy Spirit quickening the word to come in and touch your life personally that's what makes a show because it's what the shout of the king and the camp we recognize his presence by what's happening in the worship in the preaching and all of these things that's the personal God that we're looking for but he takes us and he's talking about highly emotional worship and he's talking about churches full of it and that's why I say I don't feel like I'm pointing this at us but it's a caution for us because he'd say amongst a lot of people where we find emotions and so forth there become tattalings and backbitings and all kinds of ungodly things why because people that are susceptible to emotion in here are susceptible to emotion out there too and emotion will often lead us to say and do things that we ought not to do so he's saying if you're emotional without the anointing here you're going to be annoyed you're going to be emotional without the anointing out there and it's going to cause problems he says brother that's sulfuric acid in the church it's demon power he says it's the spirit of men and women who get among one another it's a natural human spirit it's not as Godly Spirit he says and try and push off and say this is not right and that's not right and that's not right he's talking about people that are going around calling out other people now same well brother so-and-so is not right and brother sisters or sister so-and-so is not right and look what she's wearing and look what he's doing or not doing in these different things he says if you'll Chase it down nine times out of ten times it's the very person making the stir that's not right he says amen God hates Discord among brethrens so I'm not telling you go look for who's causing problems I'm saying when you're causing problems stop and say am I doing it to get the light and the spotlight off of me because what he's saying is so often what happens is you've got an issue in your life and you don't want anyone to find out about it or focus on it so you go find somebody else's issue to put in the spotlight in hopes that you won't have to deal with yours and he says it's a what it's a religious spirit it's Satan it's sulfuric acid working on us that tries to get us to hide from the light so don't go around looking for the people causing problems go around and say am I causing problems am I acting up what causes me to do this why did I get so worked up today or why did I do that or why did I say that is there something that's inside of me that's off I can say that when I'm troubled internally when when something's off and I know I've got to deal with it I'm harder on the people around me why because I'm refusing to deal with what God's trying to fix inside of me and I turn harsh with other people and he's saying that's the tendency be reverent be holy love God and stand by him and as long as you know your life is divvying up with the Bible this is a long list now with purity of heart purity of thought love towards your brother trying your best to up build the kingdom of God doing all those things dressing right living right talking right going right places then you can have all the emotions you want to and everybody will believe it that's it but like I said don't not shout don't stop shouting because your life isn't perfect shout when he makes the change shout when you see growth shout when you see the answer shout when you see him working in your life listen sometimes we need to shout because we need change that's a part of worship Praises is is thanking him for what he's done worship is is is dwelling on what he is and sometimes we've got to worship for who he is and what he's promised to do before he ever does it and you can shout in the storm you can shout in a downtime you can shout when it seems like things aren't going right because you're believing the promise and you're thanking him for what he's done even though you can't see it amen let's look at another seducing Spirit now I've seen this one a lot and we have it in natural life not just in spiritual life it's human nature to do this done on myself many times he says how do you let go because this is what the Christian walk is about is Letting Go amen it's about letting the letting God have preeminence in your life he says how do you let go so many people are wondering today saying well brother Branham how do you let go I know you've heard a lot of theology on it let go a lot of people just work up a sweat trying to let go if I'm with this and and somebody says let go it's supposed to be that simple but he says you're sitting there and you're how do I let go how do I let go tell me brother how do I let go let go it's supposed to be like that but he says you put so much work into trying to do it just do it he says but look at what he says it looks like he says many people this is people working up a sweat trying to let go many people come around and say I was going to go on a 40-day fast so I can do something he said you don't need a 40-day fast you need to let go of the world and all these devilish things and take God's word in your heart you got to be taught how to do that you don't do it by jumping up and down neither do you do it on a 40-day fast you do it by a surrendered heart to almighty God what is it he says seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness not the kingdom of God and a little noise not the kingdom of God and a little emotion not the kingdom of God and a little this or that but God and his righteousness and all these other things will be added to you he says put it first so often what happens if you go to camp meetings or youth meetings or special services many times something happens in a service and people come out and they start to make these big promises and these big commitments and I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that and it's going to be this way and it's going to be that way and they start to do all of these things and you come talk to them a week or two or three or a month later and nothing's there they come out and because they want big impact or they believe in big impact or they want big changes or a big Ministry or something that really stands out and is noticeable they go and they do something big and impactful they make an extreme change and they say that's what's going to make the difference amen they look for extreme expressions of spirituality 40-day fast my wife did a a water fast one time for 21 days I think or something do you know what it takes to do a 40-day fast you can't do it physically very easy you need to be driven to it you need to be called to do something like that but he says we'll do these extreme things will commit to fasting for a few days or commit to doing more of this and more of this and we'll do these big grand gestures for God but we won't read our Bible and pray every day the results do not come from grand gestures the results come from consistent obedience consistent surrender that's what gets you there anything in life your spiritual walk with Christ that's how you get there if you want to control your weight it's consistent obedience you want your relationships to go well it's consistent focus on it it's doing the right thing constantly that's what gets you the results it's not a one moment thing now there's a one moment change the new birth is an experience in a moment but from then it's this constant thing that's going on and on and God works in those things and God does those things but he does it through a surrendered heart not through grand gestures if God wants you to go on a fast he'll tell you to go on a fast if God wants you to go somewhere and do something he'll open the door you don't have to sit there and say I'm going to do this for you and I'm going to do that for you just say Lord I'm willing to do whatever you ask me to do and pretty soon you'll find that that's what gets you into action it's because you're willing and surrendered not because you're the one that's making the grand gestures you don't have to put anything on you just have to surrender and be obedient and be willing and the rest will follow that's what he says seek ye first the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is the will of God for you here and now that's it seek that and everything else will be added everything else will follow through in Acts 13 or acts 4 verse 13 now this is after the day of Pentecost and this is the priests looking at Peter and John it says and when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus they noticed they were unlearned and they were ignorant and then they took notice that they had been with Jesus why am beholding the man which was healed standing with them they could say nothing against it why because the proof that they have been been with Jesus was right there the proof was in the pudding it was not in their delivery of their sermons but it was in the power of the Holy Ghost to do what Christ did in his ministry and it was standing in front of them and they could not say anything against it because the evidence defeated anything they could say they had a man there that had been healed that everybody knew had been lame for all of his life he was standing there what made the difference for Peter and John it wasn't Seminary it wasn't theology it was a new birth it was an experience with God that changed their life instantaneously listen Paul said what I I'm worried that you'll be beguiled away from the Simplicity that is in Christ it's not rocket science it's simple consistent obedience to the word of God that's it obedience will lead you to what God has for you every single time simple obedience like I said our inclination is to make the grand gestures rather than simply do what God asks us to do that's that's the human mentality let's make a big let's make a big thing out of it rather than just do the little things that he's asked us to do listen Peter and John weren't smart men they weren't educated they they aren't polished as far as we know but they were real Believers and they were real men of God because they had a new birth brother Brown said you're not even converted until you have the Holy Ghost that's what it is you're changed and you're changed and nothing of the old man is left you're a new creature you're a new creation in Christ Prophet God will put this way as as we're closing he says this let me be a brother let me live the example of what Christ said a man should be let me be a brother to a brother a brother to a sister let me be a minister to the ministers let me be an example of examples let me show to the world that this word is Christ he says the only way I can do it is to come into him because I can't do it myself and you can't do it but let the word in you become one then it lives itself out you are a walking Epistle of Jesus Christ when he's got total control of you to make every word if he comes this way and says I want to do this and you say no no I don't believe that see you're not in the word yet see full now watch fully now fully obedience to the whole word of God entitles us to the token when we pay when we pray we must have the token to present with our prayer amen God bless you if you stand Church we're not going anywhere without the Holy Spirit we're not achieving anything without the Holy Spirit we can sit under the preaching of this message all day every day and an angel could come in and blow a trumpet in our ear and we still wouldn't go in a Rapture if we don't have the Holy Ghost he's coming for a bride that's got oil in her vessel he's coming for a bride that's ready that she's prepared amen Jesus said my sheep know my voice and I know them and they follow me and a religious spirit is trying to get you to tune into another voice it's trying to get you to recognize something that isn't the word of God as if it is the word of God how do you fight that how do you fight that how do you know what's God or not how do you know when the holy spirit's truly leading you you've got to know what that voice first said you've got to know what he's already said to hear what he's saying today so you've got to get to the place where this becomes the first thing that rolls off of your lips and that puts a filter up in your mind whenever anything comes across your way you've got to know this inside and out you've got to be able to say it is written in every situation you're facing so that you can try every spirit every leading every unction every urge you have if you can pull it through this from front to back you know that's the Holy Spirit and if you can't it's a religious spirit trying to make you think it's God and it's leading you to destruction it's leading you to death it's leading you to a place that'll stunt your growth amen listen I'm not here to look at you I'm here to look at myself and tonight what I'm saying is look to yourself look inwardly that's what we're supposed to do we're supposed to judge ourselves we're not supposed to be looking around at other people we're supposed to look in and say Lord what needs to change has a religious spirit got in and told me it's okay to live with this thing has a religious told me it's okay to have this Habit to have this friendship to go these places to do these things to dress this way whatever it might be as something got in and told me something and this has clearly told me not to do it that's how you know a religious spirit has access into your life and we're all fighting it we're all fighting it none of us is exempt from it and remember we've got to know what did the voice say the first time all scripture is given by God it's inspired by God this is where we go back to amen not what I say not what an elder says we go back to this and that's how we know whether we're listening to the right voice amen let's bow our heads together Heavenly Father Lord we're thankful Lord that you sent a warning to us Lord that you gave us a filter that you gave us a a compass that points due north every time and Lord the scripture says that the the way is so easy that even a fool won't air in it Lord but we've got to be dwelling on your word we've got to be seeking it we've truly got to want to see your truth Heavenly Father Lord I'm praying your grace to keep us Lord from being seduced Lord from a religious spirit Lord that would let us stay in our current condition Lord may we not just be here to be petted or told we're good Lord but may we rise to the challenge of the preaching of the word Lord May Faith take hold Lord and may we be honest with ourselves Lord may we stand before you Lord if we've done it ignorantly Lord may we not make excuses and Lord if we've done it willfully may we repent Lord and ask your grace to not do it again Lord It's So Sly it's so slick out there Lord we pray that you will guard and keep us each one Lord let our hearts be tender towards the word Lord let our let our let our minds be quick to take on the mind of Christ Lord to surrender our will and and Desires in these things Lord that your word would have full effect we pray Lord bless us now we pray
