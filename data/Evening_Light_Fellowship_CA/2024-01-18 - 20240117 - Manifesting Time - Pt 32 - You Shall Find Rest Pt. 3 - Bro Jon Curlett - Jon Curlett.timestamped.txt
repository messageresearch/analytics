[41:18] that being clothed we shall not be found
[41:20] naked for we that are in this Tabernacle
[41:23] do grown being burdened not for that we
[41:25] will be unclothed but clothed upon PA
[41:28] that mortality will be swallowed up of
[41:30] life this literally means that the
[41:32] mortality we have will be completely
[41:34] devoured by God's life if you're
[41:36] devoured there's nothing left to you and
[41:38] all that's left is the thing that
[41:39] devours you amen so that's the only
[41:40] thing is left he says the thing I
[41:42] desires that only God's life remains
[41:44] that everything else in me would be
[41:46] would be destroyed that would be
[41:47] devoured he says now he that hath
[41:49] wrought us for the self- saafe thing is
[41:51] God he says the one that's ordained this
[41:53] is God who had also given unto us the
[41:55] earnest the down payment of the spirit
[41:58] therefore we are always confident
[42:00] knowing that whilst we are at home in
[42:01] the body we are absent from the Lord
[42:05] amen God bless you you can have your
[42:06] seats this evening and I want to take a
[42:08] third and final service on this thought
[42:10] of uh you shall find rest and because I
[42:13] want to take us into maybe a bigger
[42:15] picture and the the full depth and
[42:16] breadth of what it means when we talk
[42:18] about this Capstone this charity this
[42:20] agape love this this perfect love this
[42:23] holy ghost that we've been talking about
[42:25] and we see here in Corinthians that Paul
[42:27] isn't talking about death in a in a in a
[42:29] in a in a sorrowful way in an unhappy
[42:32] way in a dreading way Paul's looking
[42:34] forward to passing on anden Paul's in a
[42:37] place where where he's looking and he he
[42:39] he's he he's in a he's in house you know
[42:42] he's in in a house uh he's kept in a
[42:45] prison in a home there for a while and
[42:47] and and he's he's got a death sentence
[42:50] hanging over him and he's he's got
[42:51] problems with his health and he doesn't
[42:53] get Fellowship the way he wants Paul
[42:55] didn't have a whole lot to stick around
[42:56] in this life for you know but yet so
[42:58] many times we look at death as a bad
[43:00] thing and no matter how bad it is here
[43:03] most people would rather be here than
[43:04] move on because they don't know what
[43:05] awaits them over there but Paul's got
[43:08] the earnest he says he says we have an
[43:09] Earnest he says and this gives us
[43:11] confidence that it's better to be over
[43:13] there than here because here we only get
[43:14] a taste we only get a sip we only get a
[43:17] little bit of it but over there we get
[43:18] the whole thing we get everything that
[43:20] God has promised for us amen and he says
[43:22] we Gran he said earnestly this isn't a
[43:25] put
[43:28] this isn't something that we we just say
[43:29] oh I don't want to be here anymore I
[43:32] wish I was you know I wish I was over
[43:34] there than here Paul says we earnestly
[43:36] grown it's a sincere thing it's a
[43:37] genuine thing he says Desiring to be
[43:40] clothed upon with our house our
[43:42] glorified body which is from Heaven Paul
[43:44] knew the last thing holding him back was
[43:46] this body his character had been
[43:48] developed God had put the the the the
[43:50] spirit of God inside of him he had
[43:52] eternal life inside of him but this
[43:54] stinking flesh was the last thing that
[43:55] was was holding them back and he says I
[43:57] want to be clothed upon with the
[43:58] glorified thing I want to get what God
[44:00] has waiting for me I don't want this
[44:02] thing that that fails and and causes
[44:04] problems Paul said in this dwells no
[44:06] good thing but he says if I can get rid
[44:08] of this then I can have what I've been
[44:10] looking for all this life I can lay my
[44:12] weapons down I can take my peace I can
[44:14] take my rest why because he had a
[44:16] foretaste and we know that Paul also
[44:18] went to go beyond the curtain of time
[44:20] and he saw what awaited there but even
[44:22] in the Holy Ghost as Believers we have a
[44:24] foretaste of what we're going to
[44:26] experience on the other side when we get
[44:28] there amen there's a simple contentment
[44:30] there's a simple rest that comes with
[44:32] knowing we're in his plan we're in his
[44:34] purpose we're in his will we're walking
[44:36] the road that he would have for us we're
[44:38] in his presence brother R would preach a
[44:40] message called the unrecognized presence
[44:42] of Jesus Christ just to know you're in
[44:45] his presence ought to bring us a special
[44:46] peace but when we get to the other side
[44:48] not the way they are now but when we all
[44:50] get to the other side we'll be in his
[44:52] presence and we never separate we're
[44:54] never separated from him ever ever more
[44:56] amen but why do we have this feeling why
[44:58] is it that we can feel at rest that that
[45:01] when a Believer is passing over they
[45:03] aren't freaking out they're not
[45:04] panicking they're not struggling they're
[45:06] not striving to hold on to that last
[45:08] breath or make this right or or try and
[45:11] do this or they're expressing all their
[45:12] regrets but why are they at
[45:14] peace because their lack of peace is
[45:17] here we're pilgrims and strangers here
[45:20] why because there's a Holy Ghost Inside
[45:22] of us that reminds us we're pilgrims and
[45:24] strangers we don't have have contentment
[45:26] the way the world has here we don't have
[45:28] peace the way the world has here we
[45:29] don't fit in here these ways amen if
[45:32] it's the holy spirit that makes the
[45:33] difference on whether we're satisfied
[45:35] here or whether we're satisfied somebody
[45:37] somewhere else because if we don't have
[45:38] the Holy Ghost we get satisfaction out
[45:40] of this we get fed by the things of this
[45:42] world we seek after the things of this
[45:44] world and if there's any contentment to
[45:46] be had we get it here because you're not
[45:48] going to be content over there as you
[45:50] face the Judgment amen so we have a
[45:53] discontentment here compared to the
[45:55] world in that the thing things that
[45:56] satisfy them don't satisfy us and the
[45:58] rest that they have whatever it looks
[45:59] like is not a rest that we're looking
[46:01] for because we're pilgrims and strangers
[46:03] there's something that's calling us out
[46:05] of this world and one day we were
[46:06] offered that opportunity and we took it
[46:10] and we said I'd rather what's over there
[46:12] like Moses that that he chose not to to
[46:14] to have the pleasures of sin for a
[46:16] season but he esteemed what the
[46:17] reproaches of Christ greater riches and
[46:20] there's something in us that that has
[46:21] cued us to that that has called us to
[46:23] that and we respond to that and in that
[46:25] there there's a rest that there's
[46:26] something better that awaits for us it's
[46:28] not here it's over there that we're
[46:30] going to get it amen but if we've got a
[46:32] thirst for the things of this world
[46:34] there's only one thing can satisfy it
[46:36] can only there's only one thing that can
[46:37] take that away and that's the holy
[46:39] spirit it's the only thing that can do
[46:41] it otherwise we're we're running to and
[46:43] fro we're we're we're chasing our tail
[46:45] we're we're always looking for that
[46:46] thing that's ever in front of us and
[46:48] we're never getting it because as soon
[46:49] as we get it there's one more carrot in
[46:51] front of us that we're trying to get and
[46:53] it's a constant one-upmanship of trying
[46:55] to get more and more and more and you're
[46:57] never satisfied you'll find people that
[46:59] finally decide to just lay everything
[47:01] down and say I'm happy with what I've
[47:02] got they are truly the happiest people
[47:04] in the world because they're not running
[47:06] after something that's
[47:07] unobtainable but we have our our
[47:09] treasure is not here our treasure is
[47:11] over there our rewards over there so we
[47:13] don't have to seek things we don't have
[47:14] to strive for things we don't have to
[47:16] push and pull we don't have to look
[47:18] forward to everything that's there our
[47:20] our great treasur is on the other side
[47:22] amen that's why I've said over this
[47:23] pulpit and and I I like like to say
[47:26] things about what I deal with so that it
[47:27] lets you know that if you deal with
[47:29] something it's okay and where I said
[47:31] that if I'm looking to make big
[47:32] purchases all the time it's because I'm
[47:34] falling away in my walk why because I'm
[47:36] seeking contentment where contentment
[47:39] can't be found and I know that by now I
[47:41] know that the big job the big pay the
[47:43] nice car the nice house the beautiful
[47:45] wife that is not where our satisfaction
[47:47] is our satisfaction is found when we
[47:50] find our place in Christ I am more
[47:53] satisfied working harder than I've ever
[47:55] worked here than I've ever been in my
[47:57] life why because I know I'm in his will
[48:00] I know that he's with me I know that
[48:02] he's helping me I know that he's walking
[48:04] with me he's teaching me he's training
[48:06] me and in that is the greatest peace
[48:08] I've ever had because I know that he's
[48:10] in it that's where it is amen but if I
[48:13] if I'm going and I'm always looking at
[48:15] this and I want this and I want that
[48:16] what is it because there's a
[48:18] satisfaction that hasn't been satisfied
[48:20] there's a contentment that hasn't
[48:21] reached inside of me and I need to
[48:23] satisfy that and for the believer the
[48:25] only thing that will satisfy is to get
[48:27] in the presence of God it's to find your
[48:29] place in his word amen and if I haven't
[48:31] been feeding my soul the way I ought to
[48:33] if I haven't been spending time with God
[48:35] what happens is I try and seek
[48:36] contentment elsewhere and all I really
[48:38] need to do is literally sit down read my
[48:40] Bible for a while and talk to God about
[48:42] some things and it'll all go away that's
[48:44] just me though that's just me so don't
[48:46] judge me if I buy a new car in the next
[48:47] few years okay my youngest car I told my
[48:50] wife my youngest car is 11 years old
[48:52] today I'm going to need one at some
[48:54] point the way Newland beats cars up you
[48:56] know but but my point is I can that's a
[48:58] trigger for me I know if I'm doing that
[49:00] then something's off and I find each of
[49:02] us tend to have triggers some of us eat
[49:03] a
[49:05] lot some of us read a lot of different
[49:07] books some of us will will go out and
[49:09] we'll we we'll play a lot of sports and
[49:11] we'll spend a lot of time with certain
[49:12] friends or we're always trying to keep
[49:13] busy or something it's because we
[49:15] haven't got that rest we're looking for
[49:17] but there's a rest for the believer amen
[49:19] but I I wanted to read this because I
[49:21] said that that phrase that if you've got
[49:23] a thirst for the things of the world the
[49:24] only thing that will overcome it's the
[49:25] Holy Spirit Jesus said love not the
[49:28] world nor the things that are in the
[49:29] world for If any man Lov the world the
[49:31] love of the father is not in him now
[49:33] that word love there is the same word as
[49:35] Charity in second Peter 1 and it's it
[49:37] means divine love it's agape love it's
[49:40] the Holy Ghost so he says if any man
[49:42] loves the world the Holy Ghost is not in
[49:45] him that doesn't mean you can't be
[49:47] tempted that doesn't mean you you know
[49:48] bright shiny things or fast things or be
[49:51] no no no that's not we're talking a love
[49:52] a seeking after something that you're
[49:54] chasing after after that's what we're
[49:56] talking about he says for all that is in
[49:59] the world all that's an absolute
[50:02] everything in the world the lust of the
[50:04] flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride
[50:06] of life is not of the father but it's of
[50:08] the world that's why I say when I'm
[50:10] looking at things that are in the world
[50:12] it means that I'm suppressing something
[50:14] else or I'm not feeding the right thing
[50:16] in my life and that's why I'm chasing
[50:17] after it that's why I'm looking after it
[50:19] and if I never buy it that doesn't
[50:21] change the fact that I'm seeking after
[50:23] it amen and I've got to get my
[50:24] priorities straight and I've got to get
[50:25] back to where my source of
[50:27] joy and contentment is but we're talking
[50:30] about the big picture this evening and
[50:32] I'm not going to keep you too long
[50:34] tonight but Paul said we only get the
[50:36] earnest here we only get the down
[50:38] payment of the holy spirit in this body
[50:40] and he said in Romans 8 he says not only
[50:42] they but ourselves also which have the
[50:45] first fruits of the spirit even we
[50:47] ourselves grown within ourselves waiting
[50:50] for the adoption to with the Redemption
[50:52] of our body we're going to get into
[50:54] adoption when I come back from Vancouver
[50:56] Lord willing but he says even here we're
[50:58] still groaning he says we're we're we're
[51:00] sighing with grief we're saddened by our
[51:02] current state of affairs or life where
[51:05] we're at it's a sad State of Affairs why
[51:07] he says because I know what awaits us
[51:09] and I know what I have now and there is
[51:11] no comparison to be made amen he says
[51:15] Paul had had no nothing to look forward
[51:17] to in life except death he knew when he
[51:20] went to Caesar he was going to die he
[51:22] knew that but it took years and years
[51:25] years for that to happen he wrote
[51:26] beautiful letters and the Holy Spirit
[51:28] used them and and he got to still
[51:30] fellowship and he actually they believe
[51:32] got to leave prison for a bit and travel
[51:34] and then come back again and and these
[51:36] different things so he had some respit
[51:37] but in general he was he was bound by
[51:39] the the the issue he had in his body and
[51:41] they think he he had issues with his
[51:43] eyes and then he was limited in
[51:45] fellowship and he's always under that
[51:47] potential stress of of losing his head
[51:49] at any moment you know but Paul says I'm
[51:52] groaning for it I'm groaning for the
[51:54] change of the full adoption because the
[51:57] adoption we have here is only a taste
[52:00] it's only a little bit because our full
[52:01] adoption is the Redemption of our body
[52:04] it's when we lose this one thing that's
[52:05] really holding us back amen but I want
[52:08] to take it a take a look at the big
[52:10] picture because we're following the same
[52:12] path as Christ we started with Paul but
[52:15] remember the scripture says that Jesus
[52:16] was the firstborn among many Brethren
[52:19] that means we've got to follow his path
[52:22] that means as it worked for him so it's
[52:24] supposed to work for us so his
[52:25] experience is supposed to be our
[52:27] experience his Revelation is supposed to
[52:29] be our Revelation his path is our path
[52:32] how he did it is is how we're supposed
[52:34] to do it we're supposed to follow the
[52:36] exact same trajectory as Jesus Christ
[52:38] did on this earth now we know he was
[52:40] filled with the spirit at the Jordan
[52:42] River when he came to be baptized of
[52:44] John and the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[52:46] was the
[52:47] identification that he was the son of
[52:49] God that's when they knew without a
[52:51] shadow of a doubt that's when he knew
[52:53] without a shadow of a doubt cuz because
[52:55] Jesus had only believed unto this he
[52:57] said yes I have to be about the the my
[52:59] father's work but until there was a
[53:01] confirmation he was walking by faith and
[53:04] we have to do the exact same thing amen
[53:06] but there's an identification that's
[53:08] reserved only for the children of God
[53:10] and that's the baptism of the Holy
[53:12] Spirit remember the scripture says
[53:14] because ye are
[53:16] Sons because you are not you are because
[53:20] but because you are he says God has sent
[53:23] forth the spirit of his son in your
[53:24] heart crying Abba Father it's because
[53:27] you're a child of God that you can
[53:29] receive the Holy Spirit and that's the
[53:31] power of God in you to become a child of
[53:33] God to actually produce what's inside of
[53:35] you amen but under Christ on his walk in
[53:39] this earth we see there the path for a
[53:41] child for a son or daughter of God under
[53:43] the New Covenant of Grace and it's
[53:45] always by the indwelling of the Holy
[53:46] Spirit that's the grace of God to us is
[53:49] that we can have his Spirit he couldn't
[53:50] do it before because our sins were only
[53:52] covered they weren't erased but as we
[53:54] said last service he became our sin we
[53:57] are no more sin there's no judgment
[53:59] there's no condemnation there's nothing
[54:01] Satan can do there's nothing God can do
[54:03] to restore you back to a sinful
[54:05] condition you have already been replaced
[54:07] with Christ he died that's it there's
[54:09] nothing that can be done you're you're
[54:11] sinless this evening nothing can happen
[54:14] but something has to happen now to make
[54:15] you live because you're dead and yes you
[54:18] have no sin and these things but
[54:20] something's got to make you live the
[54:21] life that God wants you to live and
[54:23] that's under the Grace Covenant by the
[54:25] holy spirit so we see what happened to
[54:27] Jesus in Mark 1 it says and it came to
[54:29] pass in those days that Jesus came forth
[54:32] from Nazareth of galile and was baptized
[54:34] of John and Jordan and straight way
[54:36] coming up out of the water he saw the
[54:38] heavens opened and the spirit like a
[54:40] dove descending upon him and there came
[54:43] a voice from Heaven saying Thou Art my
[54:45] beloved Son in whom I am well pleased
[54:48] catch this this is for Jesus to know he
[54:53] didn't say he is he said Thou Art it's
[54:57] the identification for the son or
[54:59] daughter of God that you are a child of
[55:01] God I don't get the Holy Ghost so you
[55:04] know I get the Holy Ghost so I know it's
[55:06] my seal it's my Assurance it's my it's
[55:09] my settlement that I'm going to make it
[55:11] because he's identifying me with him
[55:14] he's not identifying me with you he's
[55:15] identifying me with him amen that's why
[55:18] he gives it so don't let anybody tell
[55:20] you you don't have the Holy Ghost it's
[55:22] your seal it's your experience it's your
[55:25] Assurance amen and if your life matches
[55:27] up with the word I don't care what
[55:29] anybody says you're going to make it why
[55:31] because the Life of Christ is rolling
[55:33] through you I was talking with somebody
[55:35] recently and a and they were saying you
[55:37] know it seems like we focus so much on
[55:39] getting our young people to shout and to
[55:41] dance and to worship and what about the
[55:44] hidden life what about the settledness
[55:46] what about the victory that happens when
[55:48] you walk out of those special meetings
[55:50] on the Monday morning do you still have
[55:52] the victory cuz if youve got the victory
[55:54] you'll have it in church and you'll have
[55:55] it outside of church amen that's what it
[55:57] is it's for you settle it in your heart
[56:00] make your calling election sure that's
[56:02] what Paul said and when you've settled
[56:03] it don't ever walk back on it you hold
[56:07] fast to that cuz that's God's seal
[56:09] that's God's Assurance to you that's God
[56:11] telling you you are my son you are my
[56:13] daughter and I've sealed you and you're
[56:14] going to make it all the way to the
[56:16] other side amen but we see that Jesus
[56:18] gets this clear statement and it's a
[56:20] it's a Vindication of who he is and what
[56:22] he is and he goes near through his
[56:24] Ministry them for about 3 years and we
[56:27] see near the very end now as Jesus is
[56:29] coming to the end of his ministry and
[56:31] there's this little
[56:33] verse that that that that's just the key
[56:35] to this whole thing because you got to
[56:37] see that What's Happening Here is not
[56:39] the big story it's what happens
[56:42] afterwards that's the big story this is
[56:44] all preparation for us to rule and reign
[56:46] with Christ you've got to have your
[56:48] character developed here you've got to
[56:50] be able to to to surrender yourself to
[56:53] the Holy Spirit here because we're going
[56:54] to to rule and reign with him for a
[56:56] thousand years and then we're going to
[56:57] be in eternity with him amen he's got to
[56:59] know that he can trust us so this is our
[57:02] proving time and it's our testing time
[57:04] and it's the holy spirit that does the
[57:05] complete work in The Believer it's a
[57:08] tutor and it's a seal and it's a guide
[57:10] and it's all of these things that we
[57:11] have need of Amen but this is Jesus now
[57:14] near the very end he's about to go in
[57:17] and be crucified in these things this is
[57:19] the upper room I believe it says Jesus
[57:21] knowing that the father had given all
[57:23] things into his hands now catch this and
[57:26] that he was come from God and that he
[57:29] went to God Amen we're not just born by
[57:31] happen stance we're not here because
[57:33] Mommy and Daddy decided they wanted a
[57:35] baby we're not just here by luck we're
[57:37] not just here by by by some little event
[57:40] in the cosmos but we are foreordained to
[57:43] be here but we come from somewhere and
[57:46] we go from somewhere and it's the holy
[57:47] ghost that tells us where we come from
[57:49] and it's the holy ghost that tells us
[57:51] where we're going amen we come from God
[57:54] and we're returning to God and Christ as
[57:56] he nears the end of this ministry says
[57:58] I'm going to be returning back to God
[58:00] now I've got a work to do here he had a
[58:02] mediatorial work on this Earth he had a
[58:05] redeeming work but after that he's going
[58:07] to have a judging work and then he's
[58:09] going to have a kingly work so what he
[58:12] did here Was preparing him for the next
[58:13] stage and that'll take him into the next
[58:15] stage and it's no different for us that
[58:17] God is taking us through this to prepare
[58:19] us for the next stage of our life and
[58:22] the next life will be a thousand years
[58:24] it's a Time and then after that we
[58:25] really step into eternal life we don't
[58:28] die for a thousand years it's it's
[58:29] proving that we're restored Back to Eden
[58:31] but eternity really happens after the
[58:33] the the millennial Reign but Jesus is
[58:36] headed for crucifixion now and his
[58:38] understanding his Revelation is that he
[58:40] came from God and he's going back to God
[58:43] what's returning to God the holy spirit
[58:47] it's the holy spirit in that body that
[58:48] body is not returning to God that body's
[58:50] just it's just a body he could have used
[58:53] anybody that's not it but it's the holy
[58:55] spirit in him which is the god that made
[58:57] him the God man is now returning back to
[59:00] Heaven amen why he was here to pay a
[59:03] Redemptive price and then all that is of
[59:05] God has to come back to God because God
[59:07] doesn't die God doesn't diminish God
[59:09] doesn't scatter the pieces and just let
[59:11] them lay where they are everything that
[59:13] comes from God has to go back to God
[59:16] that's the principle that we're talking
[59:17] about amen God's Eternal God can't
[59:19] diminish or fade away everything he has
[59:22] has to come back to him everything he is
[59:24] has to come back to him that's why we
[59:26] know we have eternal life by the holy
[59:27] spirit is because we are going back to
[59:29] him we're a part of God Amen so we know
[59:33] that in the end Jesus is crucified and
[59:36] he dies and he's resurrected and he's
[59:37] taken back into heaven but before he
[59:40] leaves he gives the promise of a return
[59:42] and this is in John 14 the very next
[59:44] chapter and he says to the disciples let
[59:46] not your heart be troubled you believe
[59:49] in God believe also in me now you can't
[59:51] say they aren't one and read that
[59:53] scripture because you can't believe in
[59:55] God and another
[59:56] one God's the only one that's true You'
[59:59] got to believe what's there amen he says
[1:00:02] in my father's house are many mansions
[1:00:03] if it were not so I would have told you
[1:00:06] I go to prepare a place for you and if I
[1:00:09] go and prepare a place for you I
[1:00:12] personal pronoun will come again and
[1:00:15] receive you unto myself that where I am
[1:00:18] there you may be also now that's the
[1:00:20] resurrection and the
[1:00:21] Rapture but he says and whether I go ye
[1:00:24] know the way you know how by the same
[1:00:27] experience by the same word by the same
[1:00:29] Holy Spirit we've got to go the same way
[1:00:31] he goes because we came the same way he
[1:00:34] came just we skipped our perfect body
[1:00:37] but we're still coming by the Holy Ghost
[1:00:38] and we're still going by the Holy Ghost
[1:00:40] amen we get the same take the same word
[1:00:42] put it with the same Spirit it gives us
[1:00:43] the same results eternal life amen
[1:00:46] restoration back in the presence of God
[1:00:48] then he jumps to verse 16 and says I
[1:00:50] will pray the father and he shall give
[1:00:52] you another comforter there that he may
[1:00:54] abide with you forever see if the
[1:00:57] comforter comes that restores you back
[1:00:59] to Eternal
[1:01:00] Fellowship he says even the spirit of
[1:01:03] Truth see it sounds like he's talking
[1:01:04] about somebody else here even the spirit
[1:01:07] of Truth whom the world cannot receive
[1:01:09] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[1:01:10] him so the spirit of Truth he says the
[1:01:12] world doesn't know it but he says but ye
[1:01:15] know him for he dwelleth with you that's
[1:01:18] him right there at that moment this is
[1:01:20] him Christ the Holy Spirit embodied in
[1:01:23] flesh he dwells with you and future
[1:01:26] tense he shall be in you and then he
[1:01:28] makes it clear I will not leave you
[1:01:31] comfortless I will come to you it's one
[1:01:33] and the self-same person time and time
[1:01:36] again God above us God with us and then
[1:01:38] God coming back in US amen Jesus had
[1:01:41] read the word and he believed the word
[1:01:42] all the way up until this up until he
[1:01:44] got the Holy Ghost even before he was
[1:01:47] given the fullness of the spirit and yet
[1:01:48] he was sinless in all things before he
[1:01:51] got the Holy Ghost he was the second
[1:01:53] Adam and he may he had had the same
[1:01:55] choices and he made the right choices
[1:01:57] the scripture says he was tempted in all
[1:01:59] points in all ways as we were yet
[1:02:02] without sin he never gave in the
[1:02:04] temptation but the Temptation was there
[1:02:07] amen he lived a perfect life and it was
[1:02:10] by staying with the word amen now he's
[1:02:13] telling the disciples I'm going back to
[1:02:15] prepare for you and you've got to come
[1:02:17] the same way I've come don't worry about
[1:02:19] it he says I'm going to come and lead
[1:02:21] you back he calls it the spirit of truth
[1:02:23] but he says I'm going to come back I
[1:02:25] will not leave you comfortless I will
[1:02:27] come to you so it's him returning we
[1:02:29] know that the holy spirit is Jesus
[1:02:31] because when that Pillar of Fire knocked
[1:02:33] Paul off of his horse he said Lord who
[1:02:36] are you and he said I am Jesus why he
[1:02:39] had returned back to his original
[1:02:41] condition he had returned back to the
[1:02:43] pillar of fire it's what the dwelling
[1:02:45] place of the Holy Spirit the visibility
[1:02:46] of the holy spirit in a body of fire so
[1:02:49] we've got to walk the same road that
[1:02:51] Jesus did we've got to do it by the same
[1:02:53] revelation we got to see ourselves in
[1:02:55] the word we've got to believe it and
[1:02:57] then God confirms it in our life by the
[1:02:58] Holy Spirit to make it live within us
[1:03:00] amen that's the Dynamics that we've
[1:03:02] talked about so I want to take us back
[1:03:04] to the first experience of this when we
[1:03:06] go back to the day of Pentecost when the
[1:03:09] Holy Spirit was given to the Believers
[1:03:11] and walk from there because again I'm
[1:03:12] trying to let us see the big picture of
[1:03:14] what it means to have the Holy Ghost not
[1:03:16] just in this life but the life to come
[1:03:19] now in Acts 2 it says and when the day
[1:03:20] of Pentecost was fully come they were
[1:03:23] all with one Accord in one place brother
[1:03:26] B would talk about
[1:03:28] Unity Unity of
[1:03:30] purpose when we come here for the same
[1:03:32] reason we'll get the results because
[1:03:35] we'll come in the unity of the word
[1:03:36] we'll come here for the right reason and
[1:03:38] God can do these things and what is it
[1:03:40] they were there in obedience simple
[1:03:42] obedience brought the Holy Ghost there
[1:03:45] they stayed there until it did the work
[1:03:47] it promised it says and suddenly there
[1:03:49] came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing
[1:03:51] Mighty Wind and it filled all the house
[1:03:53] where they were sitting and there
[1:03:55] appeared unto them clothing tongues like
[1:03:57] as of fire and it sat upon each of them
[1:04:00] and they were all filled with the Holy
[1:04:03] Ghost and began to speak with other
[1:04:05] tongues as the spirit gave them
[1:04:07] utterance now I want you to catch what
[1:04:09] brother brandham says here because it's
[1:04:11] the most beautiful thing I think if we
[1:04:13] can realize what it means when God gives
[1:04:15] you the Holy Ghost brother Ram says
[1:04:18] according to scripture in the upper room
[1:04:20] waiting suddenly a sound like a rushing
[1:04:22] wind that was upon them that was the
[1:04:25] Holy Spirit like a wind a supernatural
[1:04:27] wind then they
[1:04:30] noticed the wind not the wind caused
[1:04:33] them to notice what was happening it
[1:04:34] says and out in there was a little
[1:04:36] tongues of fire 120 of them and began to
[1:04:40] settle down and set upon each of them
[1:04:44] what was it he says the pillar of fire
[1:04:47] which was God himself dividing himself
[1:04:51] among his people coming into the people
[1:04:55] he said Jesus had the whole thing he had
[1:04:58] the spirit without measure we get it by
[1:05:00] measure cuz we're adopted children his
[1:05:02] life his eternal life was coming in now
[1:05:07] what happened he says then they were all
[1:05:09] filled with the Holy Ghost so we look at
[1:05:12] this drama in the upper room and this is
[1:05:13] not just a a good meeting this isn't
[1:05:15] just a big Revival this is literally the
[1:05:19] almighty God dividing himself into the
[1:05:22] believer's lives
[1:05:25] God taking what he is and pouring a
[1:05:28] little bit into each and every one of us
[1:05:30] that's what happens when you get the
[1:05:31] Holy Ghost God is placing a portion of
[1:05:35] himself in
[1:05:36] you and he says what was it it is
[1:05:39] eternal life coming into you thing about
[1:05:43] eternity is it doesn't go away you can
[1:05:46] cut eternity in half and it's still
[1:05:47] eternity you can cut eternity into a
[1:05:49] million pieces and it's still eternity
[1:05:51] there's no ending to it it's infinite
[1:05:54] amen God's putting a portion of himself
[1:05:57] he's separating himself out and he's
[1:05:59] putting it into people brother Braham
[1:06:01] says if we could only receive this truth
[1:06:05] now just a moment if we could realize
[1:06:06] what this scripture means that he that
[1:06:09] is in you is greater than he that's in
[1:06:11] the world we can't understand that yet
[1:06:14] we say we believe
[1:06:16] it he says and we know it's true but we
[1:06:19] really don't understand it isn't that
[1:06:21] interesting we can know something's true
[1:06:23] but we don't have the full impact of it
[1:06:25] we don't understand what it means he
[1:06:27] says what is in you that's greater it's
[1:06:30] Christ the Anointed God that was in
[1:06:32] Christ is in you what that means is you
[1:06:36] are no different than Christ except in
[1:06:38] the
[1:06:41] amount I want you to think about that
[1:06:44] because we would give anything to sit
[1:06:48] and have a conversation while Christ
[1:06:50] walked this Earth in a body amen I'd
[1:06:53] love to have a CH with brother brandham
[1:06:55] but I'd really want to chat with Jesus
[1:06:56] Christ because he makes all things
[1:07:00] clear and yet when you walk this Earth
[1:07:04] people have an opportunity to meet Jesus
[1:07:08] Christ just in a lesser form that's what
[1:07:12] he's saying he's saying God is walking
[1:07:15] the Earth all over again Heen he says
[1:07:18] then if he's in you it's not you anymore
[1:07:20] living it's him living in you see it's
[1:07:23] not you're thinking and what you think
[1:07:25] about this it's what he said about this
[1:07:28] then if he's in you he absolutely would
[1:07:30] not deny what he said he couldn't do it
[1:07:33] but he would keep what he has said and
[1:07:35] he's trying to find that person that he
[1:07:38] can vindicate himself through see he
[1:07:42] vindicates himself to so that he can
[1:07:44] vindicate through he's trying to find
[1:07:46] someone that will yield themselves he
[1:07:48] says now it's he that is greater than
[1:07:50] you is in you is greater than he that's
[1:07:52] in the world God in you like he was in
[1:07:54] Jesus Christ because what all God was he
[1:07:58] poured into Christ and all Christ was he
[1:08:00] poured into the church see that's God in
[1:08:03] you he that's in you it's not just an
[1:08:08] experience it's not just a a Hocus Pocus
[1:08:11] it's not just a a spiritual thing it is
[1:08:14] literally God in you living in mortal
[1:08:18] flesh again that's what we're talking
[1:08:20] about here people say I've got the Holy
[1:08:22] Ghost and nothing changes in their life
[1:08:23] I'm sorry you can't have it that doesn't
[1:08:27] make any sense because if almighty God I
[1:08:29] don't care about how small a portion is
[1:08:32] if it's just you know the the smallest
[1:08:34] amount of liquid you could get and you
[1:08:36] put that inside of you and that's
[1:08:37] almighty God it will change this Mortal
[1:08:40] body it will change your mindset it'll
[1:08:42] change your attitude it'll change your
[1:08:43] approach it'll change your words it'll
[1:08:45] change your desires it'll change the way
[1:08:47] you live your life there's no way you
[1:08:49] can have God inside of you and live the
[1:08:51] way you were you can't do it
[1:08:54] amen we better see a change and brother
[1:08:56] Bram saying that change is going to line
[1:08:58] up with the word of God
[1:09:00] 100% amen Holy Spirit can't deny the
[1:09:04] word of God now Paul comes along and the
[1:09:07] beauty thing with Paul is that he has
[1:09:09] the exact same experience without ever
[1:09:10] being in the room upper room he gets the
[1:09:13] same baptism of the Holy Ghost he
[1:09:16] prophesies he speaks in tongues signs
[1:09:18] and wonders follow him but yet he wasn't
[1:09:21] a part of the original group and what
[1:09:22] was it it was God proving once again
[1:09:25] that it's for as many as the Lord Our
[1:09:27] God shall call there's no time
[1:09:29] limit right there's no bloodline limit
[1:09:33] it doesn't matter where you are he can
[1:09:35] fill you with the Holy Spirit at any
[1:09:36] time it's his Sovereign will remember
[1:09:39] when I read that where where we went
[1:09:40] through and and some people got it
[1:09:42] before they were baptized some got it
[1:09:43] afterwards and all brother R would say
[1:09:45] is God is Sovereign it's up to him it's
[1:09:48] up to him we preach stature of a perfect
[1:09:50] man and then God will go and give it to
[1:09:51] Raw heathens like that right
[1:09:54] it's God's Sovereign Grace and his
[1:09:57] deciding time when he does it it's not
[1:09:58] up to me and it's not up to you amen but
[1:10:01] it has the same effect and that's the
[1:10:02] point is Paul had the exact same thing
[1:10:04] he had the same Revelations his life
[1:10:06] lined up with it he lined up with the
[1:10:08] word as soon as he got the Holy Ghost
[1:10:10] amen but Paul would say we've only got
[1:10:13] the first fruits that means we've only
[1:10:15] got the first portion of the big portion
[1:10:17] that's available that's all we've got
[1:10:19] here as great of a meeting as you could
[1:10:21] have the supernatural the healing the
[1:10:24] discernment the Deliverance the
[1:10:25] provision whatever we want to talk about
[1:10:28] however great it is here this is the
[1:10:30] smallest portion we'll ever
[1:10:33] have it only gets better from here it
[1:10:36] only gets better from here this is the
[1:10:38] least amount of the Holy Ghost we're
[1:10:39] ever going to have and what's happening
[1:10:42] as we walk towards the resurrection and
[1:10:43] the Rapture is that it's overcoming and
[1:10:46] it's filling up and it's pushing out and
[1:10:47] what we're seeing is a greater and
[1:10:49] greater manifestation of what's in us
[1:10:50] but the fullness of the manifestation is
[1:10:52] when we get a new body
[1:10:54] and that's really the peak of all of
[1:10:55] these things amen but what we have today
[1:10:57] is great as it may be it is the least
[1:11:00] that we're ever going to have you know
[1:11:01] addicts today when they're hooked on a
[1:11:03] drug or a habit they get a little bit
[1:11:05] and it makes them want just a little bit
[1:11:06] more and just a little bit more and a
[1:11:09] little bit more and a little bit more
[1:11:11] why because as soon as they lose that
[1:11:13] feeling they got to have it back
[1:11:15] again sometimes we get that way
[1:11:18] sometimes we get that way because we
[1:11:19] pull back and sometimes we get that way
[1:11:22] because God pulls back
[1:11:24] and what is it it's reminding you
[1:11:27] there's a satisfaction that's available
[1:11:29] there's something that's good for you
[1:11:30] there's something that gives you
[1:11:31] contentment there's something that feeds
[1:11:33] the inside of the Soul there's something
[1:11:34] that that quenches that thirst and that
[1:11:36] satisfies that hunger that's inside of
[1:11:38] us amen and then sometimes what happens
[1:11:40] is we pull back and then hard times hit
[1:11:42] and hard decisions hit and sickness hits
[1:11:44] and family issues hit and church issues
[1:11:47] issues hit and all these different
[1:11:48] things and all of a sudden we're we're
[1:11:50] screaming out oh there's a place where I
[1:11:51] can go there's something something I
[1:11:54] have and it reminds us that we're a
[1:11:55] child of God and we've got a source
[1:11:57] we've got a token that we can take into
[1:11:59] these things amen why because we've had
[1:12:01] it before and we know that it's
[1:12:03] available over and over and over again
[1:12:05] it's that refreshing that we talked
[1:12:06] about we're talking on you shall find
[1:12:09] rest and I'm trying to show you how
[1:12:11] great a thing it is when God gives you
[1:12:12] the Holy Ghost because it's a piece of
[1:12:15] himself and when you realize you've got
[1:12:17] the key to eternal life you've got the
[1:12:20] token for your healing you've got the
[1:12:22] token for the salvation of you and your
[1:12:24] family inside of you it changes the way
[1:12:28] we look at situations amen you know when
[1:12:31] somebody does something well the world
[1:12:34] would call it amazing but whatever you
[1:12:36] know you get some athlete that comes
[1:12:38] from St John's and he wins a Stanley Cup
[1:12:40] he comes back and they give him the key
[1:12:42] to the city there is no actual lock but
[1:12:44] they give him a key to the city and it's
[1:12:45] to signify the city's yours we're at
[1:12:48] we're we're here to do whatever you want
[1:12:50] to do when God gives you the Holy Ghost
[1:12:52] it's the key to every promise he's
[1:12:54] placed in the scriptures nothing held
[1:12:57] back nothing held back from the believer
[1:12:59] amen what is it it's a magnet that's
[1:13:01] what it is it's a magnet that's pulling
[1:13:03] us back and it's as it's as irresistible
[1:13:06] as a real magnet you know when when I
[1:13:08] was in high school Mr hotter he'd have
[1:13:10] this big magnet he had a big u-shaped
[1:13:12] magnet it had a little Gap about an inch
[1:13:14] wide then he had this little wing nut
[1:13:16] wasn't it Matt and he had a little w a
[1:13:18] big wing nut actually of some sort and
[1:13:20] the test was could you pass that piece
[1:13:22] of metal through that magnet without it
[1:13:24] going from side to side it was the most
[1:13:26] powerful magnet he had it could easily
[1:13:27] hold like 10 or 15 pounds of metal it
[1:13:29] was quite powerful and the thing is you
[1:13:31] had you're just your two little thumbs
[1:13:32] and you're trying to pass it through
[1:13:34] without it being drawn over to one side
[1:13:36] of the magnet or the other that's what
[1:13:37] the Holy Ghost is like there's something
[1:13:39] drawing us all the time amen that's
[1:13:43] what's pulling us back I want to take us
[1:13:45] back to Psalm 27 this is the rapture uh
[1:13:48] scripture that brother brandham used and
[1:13:50] he said the Lord is my light and my
[1:13:52] salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is
[1:13:55] the strength of my life of whom shall I
[1:13:58] be afraid church this is perfect rest
[1:14:00] this is the rapture message this is the
[1:14:02] perfect rest why there's no fear because
[1:14:05] perfect love casts out all fear right if
[1:14:08] we could walk through life
[1:14:10] saying Who Shall I Fear and why should I
[1:14:14] be
[1:14:16] afraid life would change wouldn't
[1:14:18] it because we Know Who Holds Tomorrow we
[1:14:22] know whose Palm we're in
[1:14:24] we're in a place of perfect rest because
[1:14:26] he's given us his holy spirit he says
[1:14:28] when the wicked fell even my enemies and
[1:14:30] my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh
[1:14:34] they stumbled and
[1:14:35] fell doesn't stop the the event but it
[1:14:39] changes the attitude of the person in it
[1:14:42] he says though an host should encamp
[1:14:43] against me though an entire Army should
[1:14:46] Camp against me my heart shall not fear
[1:14:49] and though War should Rise Against Me In
[1:14:51] This Will I Be confident he said one
[1:14:55] thing have I desired of the
[1:14:57] Lord just one thing in my heart brother
[1:15:00] John that I will seek after that I may
[1:15:03] dwell in the house of the Lord all the
[1:15:06] days of my life to behold the beauty of
[1:15:08] the Lord and to inquire in his
[1:15:12] Temple it's a beautiful thing when
[1:15:14] you've got one desire and the only
[1:15:16] person you can ask it for is
[1:15:18] God when you can go with a pure heart
[1:15:20] and you can say Lord this is my desire
[1:15:23] and it's to be in your presence it's to
[1:15:25] ask and be answered it's to see the
[1:15:28] beauty of how you do
[1:15:30] things that's a wonderful place to be
[1:15:32] when that is the one thing we desire
[1:15:34] above all else in our lives what's the
[1:15:37] effect of it he says for in the time of
[1:15:38] trouble he shall hide me in his
[1:15:42] Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle
[1:15:45] shall he hide me he shall set me upon a
[1:15:50] rock this is the rapture message
[1:15:53] scripture that brother Bram used and
[1:15:54] this is the fullness of the rest that
[1:15:57] when all around my soul gives way he
[1:15:59] then is All My Hope and stay whether
[1:16:00] it's here or whether it's there whether
[1:16:03] it's now whether it's
[1:16:05] tomorrow whatever comes our way our rest
[1:16:08] is in him and what we have here is just
[1:16:10] a taste of that perfect rest when he
[1:16:12] takes us into his Tabernacle amen we go
[1:16:14] to dwell in his place right now he's
[1:16:17] dwelling in us but now we're going to be
[1:16:18] gathered back in Christ and that's going
[1:16:20] to be the Perfection of our rest Paul
[1:16:22] would talk about it in in in 1
[1:16:24] Corinthians 12 he says for as the body
[1:16:27] is one and have many members and all the
[1:16:30] members of that one body being many are
[1:16:32] one body so also is Christ we look at
[1:16:34] our body I've got all these different
[1:16:36] parts I've got fingers and none of the
[1:16:37] fingers are the same some of them are
[1:16:38] left hand some are right hand and I've
[1:16:40] got feet and legs and organs and all
[1:16:42] these things but yet it's all one body
[1:16:44] he says the body of Christ is the same
[1:16:46] way it's a bunch of individual pieces
[1:16:48] but it's still one body he says for by
[1:16:51] one Spirit we're all baptized into one
[1:16:54] body whether we be Jews or Gentiles
[1:16:56] whether we be Bond or free and have been
[1:16:58] all made to drink into one spirit for
[1:17:01] the body is not one member but many and
[1:17:05] we saw that on the day of Pentecost when
[1:17:07] God took his body and he divided it out
[1:17:10] into individual members and he poured
[1:17:12] his Spirit out into each and every one
[1:17:13] of us God divided himself up into the
[1:17:16] body of Believers and they're now the
[1:17:17] word today they're Christ today and I've
[1:17:20] said that before it chokes some people
[1:17:22] but we are Jesus Christ being revealed
[1:17:26] today if they didn't recognize the
[1:17:28] fullness how many do you think are going
[1:17:30] to recognize the little bit that each
[1:17:31] one of us is it's not going to be many
[1:17:35] but the Chosen Few that do it realize it
[1:17:38] why because there's something inside of
[1:17:39] them that responds there's a word inside
[1:17:42] of them that when the Holy Spirit
[1:17:43] flashes across from your life your life
[1:17:48] it catches them and it Sparks something
[1:17:51] and they say huh what was that like the
[1:17:54] woman at the
[1:17:55] well doesn't matter the condition
[1:17:58] they're in if there's a seed inside of
[1:18:00] it when the Holy Ghost walking their way
[1:18:03] in your flesh comes it triggers
[1:18:05] something and they start to realize
[1:18:06] there's more and they start to ask and
[1:18:09] they start to dig into these things and
[1:18:11] all of a sudden what you have is what a
[1:18:13] child of God realizes who they are and
[1:18:15] it's because the Holy Spirit passed
[1:18:17] their away just like Christ did in his
[1:18:19] day and in his time he'd walk by he he
[1:18:22] walk by by Peter and Andrew and he said
[1:18:25] come follow me and they did why the word
[1:18:28] in them recognized the word there maybe
[1:18:31] not completely but something in them
[1:18:33] compelled them to go and in time they
[1:18:36] realized what had happened he walks by a
[1:18:38] tax collector and says come follow me
[1:18:40] and he just walks up and
[1:18:42] leaves why something inside of them
[1:18:45] responding to that it's a seed that's
[1:18:48] quickened when the word comes its way
[1:18:50] and it's the holy ghost that opens those
[1:18:52] things up amen the purpose of the holy
[1:18:55] spirit is to secure us to seal us to
[1:18:58] Anchor us to finalize the process to get
[1:19:00] our souls back to Eternity that's what
[1:19:02] God's interested in is the soul amen
[1:19:04] it's the down payment it's the earnest
[1:19:05] it's the security that keeps us until we
[1:19:08] cross over to the other side it's the
[1:19:10] assurance that we come from God and that
[1:19:12] we're going back to God but I want you
[1:19:14] to catch this because in Ephesians 1 it
[1:19:15] says having made known unto us the
[1:19:17] mystery of his will according to his
[1:19:20] good pleasure which he had purposed in
[1:19:22] himself it's all in him it's his from
[1:19:25] start to finish it's his goodness it's
[1:19:27] his grace it's his will it's his purpose
[1:19:29] it's his word it's his calling it's his
[1:19:31] election I rest in that because that
[1:19:34] means I can't mess it
[1:19:37] up I can mess up my my dayto day I can
[1:19:40] mess up my experience but I can't mess
[1:19:42] up the effect because he's already
[1:19:44] declared it it's his purpose it's his
[1:19:46] will and he's determined it by himself
[1:19:48] he says that in the dispensation of the
[1:19:50] fullness of times when it's all said and
[1:19:52] done he says he might gather together in
[1:19:55] one all things in Christ so he's trying
[1:19:59] to take everything that was scattered
[1:20:01] and bring it back everything that's
[1:20:03] Christ he's trying to gather it back
[1:20:04] into one and catch what he says both
[1:20:07] which are in heaven and which are on
[1:20:09] earth even in him so there's a portion
[1:20:11] of Christ in heaven there's a portion of
[1:20:14] Christ in Earth and he says it's all
[1:20:15] part of one big body and he's trying to
[1:20:17] gather it all back together when in the
[1:20:19] dispensation of the fullness of times at
[1:20:21] the end times when time is no more
[1:20:23] that's when he gathers it all together
[1:20:25] it says in whom also we have obtained an
[1:20:28] an inheritance being predestinated
[1:20:30] according to the purpose of him who
[1:20:32] worketh all things after the counsel of
[1:20:34] his own will so the purpose is to take
[1:20:37] us over the effect is to make us live
[1:20:39] this word amen it's the Dynamics it's
[1:20:41] the it's the life of this word to not
[1:20:44] only have the letter and the
[1:20:45] understanding in our mind but it's to
[1:20:47] have the life that lives it the
[1:20:48] revealing of the word through you and
[1:20:50] through I amen we don't just know the
[1:20:52] word but we have have to live the word
[1:20:53] we have to become the word we have to be
[1:20:55] the word amen because we're supposed to
[1:20:57] be the flesh the the word made flesh
[1:20:59] today that's that's a high order be the
[1:21:03] word made flesh
[1:21:04] today but that's what happens when
[1:21:06] Christ lives inside of you is you live
[1:21:08] the life that he did Brother Braham says
[1:21:10] this because God has a witness God
[1:21:13] always has a
[1:21:14] witness and people can like it or they
[1:21:16] can lump it but God always has a witness
[1:21:18] and they don't get to choose it God
[1:21:20] chooses the witness people can accept it
[1:21:22] or take it but brother R says you're
[1:21:24] believing unto eternal life this is as a
[1:21:26] you know you come and you get baptized
[1:21:28] he says but when the Holy Spirit comes
[1:21:30] it is eternal life you receive it right
[1:21:34] then and that's why Paul could say you
[1:21:36] know if the same spirit that dwelt in
[1:21:38] Jesus Christ dwells in you it'll Quicken
[1:21:40] this Mortal body it's already
[1:21:43] quickened because the Holy Spirit the
[1:21:45] eternal life of God is inside of you you
[1:21:47] know we speak of of Charity and and all
[1:21:50] these things and we know that's the Holy
[1:21:52] Spirit and we we know that the fruit of
[1:21:53] the holy spirit is joy and love and
[1:21:55] peace and all of these things but in its
[1:21:57] purest form the holy spirit is eternal
[1:22:01] life that's what it is and everything is
[1:22:04] contained inside of that it's God
[1:22:05] himself and therefore it cannot die
[1:22:07] cannot F fade away or or any of these
[1:22:10] things Paul would talk about it in
[1:22:11] Romans 8 he says for I am
[1:22:14] persuaded I don't care where you're at
[1:22:17] tonight I am persuaded Paul said and if
[1:22:20] you have the Holy Ghost be persuaded of
[1:22:21] the same thing that neither death nor
[1:22:24] life nor angels nor principalities nor
[1:22:28] powers nor things present nor things to
[1:22:30] come what you're going through today
[1:22:31] what you're going to go through tomorrow
[1:22:33] what the government does what your what
[1:22:35] Your Boss does what the ministry does
[1:22:38] what Satan does nothing is going to have
[1:22:42] an
[1:22:43] effect he says neither height nor
[1:22:46] depth whether you get high in God
[1:22:48] whether you go down Into the Depths nor
[1:22:50] any creature shall be able to separate
[1:22:53] us from the love of God which is in
[1:22:55] Christ Jesus our lord that word love
[1:22:57] literally is agapo love it's the Holy
[1:23:00] Ghost he says nothing shall be able to
[1:23:03] separate us from the Holy Ghost which is
[1:23:05] in Christ Our
[1:23:06] Lord You're sealed it's a finished work
[1:23:09] he doesn't take it back once you've got
[1:23:12] it you're good to go all the way through
[1:23:14] why why can't it separate us because
[1:23:17] once it's in us we're sealed to the day
[1:23:18] of our Redemption and it's taking us it
[1:23:21] made us a part of God it confirmed we
[1:23:23] were a part of God and whatever is of
[1:23:24] God has to return back to God now I want
[1:23:28] to show what this looks like when it's
[1:23:30] all said and done because I want us to
[1:23:32] have a rest about what happens when this
[1:23:35] all is over if we go by way of the grave
[1:23:38] of a if a truck runs us over on our way
[1:23:40] home tonight whatever it might be that
[1:23:43] there's a rest that waits for us and
[1:23:45] it's the most beautiful thing you could
[1:23:46] ever imagine now I shared uh the vast
[1:23:49] majority of this at at sister Edna
[1:23:51] Brenton's funeral some of you were there
[1:23:53] some of you weren't but I want to share
[1:23:55] this because this is the essence of what
[1:23:56] the Holy Ghost is and we know that
[1:23:59] brother bradam lost his wife at the the
[1:24:01] tender age of 21 she was in the Primal
[1:24:03] life newly married she had a two
[1:24:05] children there and she was dying in the
[1:24:07] hospital and I want you to see the state
[1:24:10] she's in because we got to remember she
[1:24:12] crossed over and brother brandham called
[1:24:14] her
[1:24:15] back so she's been over to the other
[1:24:17] side she knows what's waiting there amen
[1:24:19] we're talking about you shall find rest
[1:24:22] brother B says I walked to the door
[1:24:25] opened the door and there she laid all
[1:24:26] covered up like this a blanket sheet
[1:24:28] pulled up over her face I jerked the
[1:24:30] sheet down and my heart was just
[1:24:32] breaking I put my hand on her her
[1:24:34] perspiration on her forehead kind of
[1:24:36] felt sticky and I said hope hope honey I
[1:24:39] said speak to me once just speak one
[1:24:41] time won't you and I was shaking her he
[1:24:44] said friends if I live a hundred years
[1:24:47] I'll never forget what happened those
[1:24:49] two big brown eyes looked up at me she
[1:24:52] was so weak she couldn't say nothing she
[1:24:55] was
[1:24:57] smiling she took her finger and she
[1:24:59] motioned and I got down she said why did
[1:25:02] you call me honey she's leaving a
[1:25:05] husband she's leaving two children
[1:25:07] behind and all she's asking is why did
[1:25:10] you call me
[1:25:11] back in our carnality we would be
[1:25:14] striving to stay behind a mother does
[1:25:16] not want to leave her children she might
[1:25:18] leave her husband under duress but
[1:25:19] she'll never leave her
[1:25:21] children
[1:25:23] amen everything she had to live for was
[1:25:25] right here and she says 'why did you
[1:25:27] call me back and I said ' I don't know
[1:25:29] she said oh I was in another land it was
[1:25:32] so peaceful I wasn't suffering she said
[1:25:35] great big birds like a great Orion there
[1:25:37] was a man dressed in white one on each
[1:25:39] side taking me to my home he said oh
[1:25:41] friend there's a land somewhere she said
[1:25:44] Oh Billy I love you so
[1:25:46] much but that didn't hold her back she
[1:25:49] says I'm going away and I want you to be
[1:25:51] a good boy she was 21 I was 23 now watch
[1:25:54] what she tells him to do she says you
[1:25:57] know that Holy Ghost we've been talking
[1:25:59] about she said promise me something
[1:26:02] Billy that you will preach that message
[1:26:05] until you die she said for it's real she
[1:26:09] said it's wonderful she said I must go
[1:26:12] back don't think I'm beside myself for
[1:26:14] I'm not she said but I know what I'm
[1:26:16] talking about she said for Israel what
[1:26:19] the Holy Ghost she says keep preaching
[1:26:22] the Holy Ghost cuz it's real it's
[1:26:25] wonderful she had already crossed over
[1:26:28] and and then he calls her back and she
[1:26:30] has no fear about going back over again
[1:26:33] that's all she wants to do she's happy
[1:26:36] she's smiling she says I'm going back
[1:26:38] Bill keep doing what you're doing cuz
[1:26:41] it's worth it but I'm going back there
[1:26:42] it's way better there than it is here
[1:26:45] amen she had already tasted what the
[1:26:47] Holy Ghost was in a way that we only get
[1:26:50] to see on that other side watch he says
[1:26:53] will you promise me that you will preach
[1:26:55] the baptism of the Holy Spirit until
[1:26:59] you're gone from this
[1:27:01] Earth because the whole revelation of
[1:27:03] the holy spirit is found in eternal
[1:27:06] life I said I promis that she said take
[1:27:08] care good care of the children said take
[1:27:10] care of Billy catch that take good care
[1:27:13] of the children then she says take good
[1:27:15] care of Billy shanon Rose was about to
[1:27:18] go she kissed me and she said I'm going
[1:27:22] what happened she was stepping into the
[1:27:26] fullness of the new
[1:27:29] birth she was stepping into what she'd
[1:27:31] only had a down payment for before she'd
[1:27:34] only had a taste of the Holy Spirit
[1:27:37] she'd only had a taste of what it means
[1:27:39] to have eternal life inside of her she
[1:27:41] couldn't be there in this body that she
[1:27:42] had she had to go and get another body
[1:27:44] and she was a place where it's not just
[1:27:45] a down payment but she's she's drinking
[1:27:48] from the fountain amen she's got as much
[1:27:50] she's living in the Overflow as that
[1:27:52] song says now we know that settled
[1:27:54] brother Bam's heart and he was so you
[1:27:57] know at peace with where she was because
[1:27:59] of what she said but of course he'd lost
[1:28:01] his wife and there's nothing more brutal
[1:28:04] I think than losing a a young spouse
[1:28:06] like that and then a young child but we
[1:28:08] know God doesn't leave us comfortless
[1:28:11] and after a while what happens God takes
[1:28:12] brother brandom and he he takes them
[1:28:14] beyond the curtain of time and he gets
[1:28:16] to experience what she experienced
[1:28:19] before he ever goes over for real
[1:28:22] right and after he goes there all
[1:28:25] brother Brandon wants to do is get back
[1:28:27] there I told a story I think at sister
[1:28:31] Edna Brenton's funeral and it was
[1:28:32] brother Isaiah Brooks that experienced
[1:28:34] it and he got into a car wreck with
[1:28:36] other brothers in the car and he knew he
[1:28:39] was going to die and he says as we're
[1:28:40] rolling and going through the breakage
[1:28:43] of the car he said the the Holy Spirit
[1:28:45] just swept over me and he says and I was
[1:28:47] at perfect peace perfect rest and then
[1:28:51] the car came to AR restr and he didn't
[1:28:53] die and he was depressed if I've got the
[1:28:57] story right for weeks for months after
[1:28:59] that because all he wanted was to
[1:29:01] experience that perfect rest that he had
[1:29:03] had in that moment because it was a rest
[1:29:05] that was going to take him all the way
[1:29:06] into
[1:29:07] Perfection amen but brother brandom goes
[1:29:10] beyond the curtain of time and he comes
[1:29:12] back with this experience and he's so
[1:29:14] inspired he's so overwhelmed he he's so
[1:29:16] focused on it because it was such a
[1:29:19] revelation to him he was so he was en
[1:29:21] raptured with what he saw it was it was
[1:29:22] so amazing to him he said it was
[1:29:24] something that I have not got the
[1:29:26] vocabulary I haven't got the words to
[1:29:29] say perfection wouldn't touch it superb
[1:29:32] wouldn't even touch it he said you just
[1:29:34] have to be there scripture says I had
[1:29:36] not seen and ear had not heard neither
[1:29:39] has entered into the heart of the man
[1:29:41] the things that God has prepared for
[1:29:42] them that love him but what God sends a
[1:29:45] prophet over and now here's the spirit
[1:29:47] of God revealing to us as best we can
[1:29:49] have in our words and language what it
[1:29:51] looks like over over there he says I
[1:29:53] looked around and then I thought what is
[1:29:55] this okay here's the question what is
[1:29:57] this and then I looked real good and I
[1:29:59] said I can't understand this and I Heard
[1:30:01] a Voice then that spoke to me that was
[1:30:03] in the room said this is what you
[1:30:05] preached was what the Holy
[1:30:09] Ghost this is perfect love and nothing
[1:30:13] can enter here without it why because
[1:30:16] this is a gathering together in one all
[1:30:19] that were in
[1:30:20] Christ that's only who it's for there's
[1:30:23] a Heavenly portion and there's an
[1:30:25] Earthly portion and over there's the
[1:30:26] Heavenly portion and they get the first
[1:30:29] taste but the scripture says they
[1:30:31] without us can't be made perfect because
[1:30:34] they need us to complete the
[1:30:36] body
[1:30:38] amen so Heaven's not just a place this
[1:30:42] paradise this this place of waiting is
[1:30:44] not just a place it's the Fulfillment of
[1:30:47] the fullness of the Holy Ghost amen it's
[1:30:50] the it's the mystical body of Christ
[1:30:52] waiting for the full adoption which is
[1:30:54] not just a a a Celestial body but it's a
[1:30:56] glorified body brother set up there they
[1:30:59] can't eat they can't do anything they're
[1:31:01] just in a in a state of perfection but
[1:31:03] we've got to come and get a glorified
[1:31:05] body so we can go to the marriage supper
[1:31:06] of the lamb and then we get to eat then
[1:31:08] we get to do things that that a natural
[1:31:10] body can Jesus had it remember he could
[1:31:12] eat and and he could do these things but
[1:31:15] he couldn't do it at first he could only
[1:31:16] do it
[1:31:18] later right but this is the Fulfillment
[1:31:21] of everything that we believed it's the
[1:31:23] fullness of the down payment we put a
[1:31:27] down payment on a house and when we pay
[1:31:28] the house off we get the whole house but
[1:31:29] we think we got the whole house no we
[1:31:31] don't we only own as much as we paid off
[1:31:33] and until we pay it off the bank owns it
[1:31:35] don't they but we've got a down payment
[1:31:38] here where God says I'm going to give
[1:31:39] you the house and then one day he gives
[1:31:41] us the house amen and it's a glorified
[1:31:44] body it's a full restoration it's a
[1:31:46] Perfection of our relationship with
[1:31:48] Christ brother brah says this now catch
[1:31:50] this okay this is in 19 this is in the
[1:31:54] fifth seal under the opening of the word
[1:31:57] the the full opening of the word brother
[1:32:00] brahs had signs and wonders brother
[1:32:01] brahs had experiences we couldn't even
[1:32:04] fathom W with angels with the
[1:32:06] supernatural with healings with
[1:32:08] discernment with prophecies all of these
[1:32:11] things and he says and I thought my if I
[1:32:16] had only knew this before I came here I
[1:32:19] would make people come here they can't
[1:32:21] afford to miss this it was beyond
[1:32:24] anything he'd ever preached beyond
[1:32:27] anything he'd ever imagined beyond
[1:32:29] anything he'd ever experienced we're
[1:32:31] talking about a man that has seen demons
[1:32:34] come and go that could see the
[1:32:36] supernatural in front of him that God
[1:32:39] Almighty stepped into and spoke into a
[1:32:41] microphone and said this is not William
[1:32:42] brandom that's how great his experience
[1:32:45] was and he says this is what it's all
[1:32:48] about he said now in here we neither eat
[1:32:51] eat drink or sleep we're all just
[1:32:54] one what is it it's the gathering
[1:32:56] together in one all that are in Christ
[1:32:59] he says well it isn't perfect it's
[1:33:01] beyond perfect it's not Sublime it's
[1:33:04] beyond Sublime there's no name that you
[1:33:06] can't think there aren't words in the
[1:33:08] vocabulary to say it he says you've just
[1:33:10] arrived that's all the world says you've
[1:33:12] arrived when you make you know $150,000
[1:33:15] a year and your house is paid off and
[1:33:17] you have no debt and you've got a
[1:33:18] million dollars in your retirement
[1:33:19] account right you've arrived or you get
[1:33:21] that big promotion or you know you you
[1:33:23] sign your first big uh contract as a as
[1:33:26] a an athlete or something like that
[1:33:28] you've arrived right where you don't
[1:33:30] have to think about spending money you
[1:33:31] just spend it that's what they think
[1:33:33] you've arrived brother Braham says this
[1:33:34] is when you've arrived you've arrived
[1:33:37] you've made it this is it there's
[1:33:38] nothing
[1:33:39] better I thought my isn't this wonderful
[1:33:42] oh my and I was afraid of it why was I
[1:33:45] afraid of dying to come to this prophet
[1:33:47] of God said he was afraid of
[1:33:50] dying he says well well this is
[1:33:52] perfection plus Perfection plus
[1:33:55] Perfection oh he says this is
[1:33:58] wonderful notice he says over there
[1:34:00] we're all just one here we have our
[1:34:03] little divisions we have our little
[1:34:04] problems we have our little
[1:34:07] disagreements sometimes here we're big
[1:34:09] ones one here one there but he says
[1:34:11] there we're just all one amen if You'
[1:34:14] got the Holy Spirit and I've got the
[1:34:15] Holy Spirit we're both going to be there
[1:34:18] so we better start getting used to each
[1:34:19] other here Amen brother Bob
[1:34:22] sometimes we get so stuck on our
[1:34:25] differences but you know there's a
[1:34:26] special bond when we get together not
[1:34:29] just here you know when I was in when I
[1:34:32] was in in BC you know and it doesn't
[1:34:34] matter uh you when I was in BC there
[1:34:37] were so many Believers there that you'd
[1:34:39] go to the grocery store and you'd see
[1:34:40] somebody and you knew they were a
[1:34:42] Believer and you didn't even know them
[1:34:43] and yet you had an affinity with them
[1:34:45] you just love to see them and you see
[1:34:47] somebody from your church driving or
[1:34:49] anything and it made your day to see
[1:34:50] another believer why because you're
[1:34:52] coming from God and you're going back to
[1:34:54] God you're part of the same group you're
[1:34:56] part of the same family and there's a
[1:34:58] connection there whether you have the
[1:34:59] same Hobbies whether you have the same
[1:35:01] background it's why we can go all over
[1:35:03] the world and people from all over the
[1:35:04] world can come to us and we just fit why
[1:35:08] because we're of the same spirit amen
[1:35:10] that's why I can move to New fin land
[1:35:12] where I have no family and yet feel at
[1:35:15] home because I do have family brother
[1:35:18] Bob is as much my brother as Nathan is
[1:35:22] and I've got to look at it that way and
[1:35:24] that's why I can have the satisfaction
[1:35:25] of family and yes with family there are
[1:35:28] blood relationship and so it's closer
[1:35:30] but there's a satisfaction that comes
[1:35:32] with being around those that have the
[1:35:33] Holy Ghost because it's just a
[1:35:35] representation of what's about to happen
[1:35:36] up there as we go into Glory we get to
[1:35:40] experience that little bit of being one
[1:35:42] here that's what we get that's why we
[1:35:44] come to church is to get our licks of
[1:35:46] fire together and we get a taste of the
[1:35:48] atmosphere that awaits us when we cross
[1:35:49] over to the other side it's just a
[1:35:51] little part of Heaven that we get here
[1:35:53] amen and we can't get over there if
[1:35:55] we're separated here you know I I I
[1:35:59] think I said this in the in the in the
[1:36:00] funeral that brother Brandon was
[1:36:02] surprised at he says you're you'll be
[1:36:05] surprised who makes it over
[1:36:06] there and my feeling is he was surprised
[1:36:09] who he saw over
[1:36:11] there you
[1:36:14] know God judges the heart my discernment
[1:36:18] doesn't put you in or put you out and
[1:36:19] your discernment doesn't put me in or
[1:36:20] put me out
[1:36:22] amen but I'll tell you this if we've
[1:36:24] only got a taste of it over here that
[1:36:26] means we ought to have a taste of the
[1:36:27] unity that comes with the Holy Ghost as
[1:36:29] well amen that we ought to be able to
[1:36:31] look past our differences brother brah
[1:36:32] says we ought to be able to bitterly
[1:36:35] disagree with somebody and still love
[1:36:37] them that's what the little portion we
[1:36:39] have here Amen brother Bob was sharing a
[1:36:42] quote with me there a while back where
[1:36:44] brother Bram said that Above All Things
[1:36:45] he'd rather the church had brotherly
[1:36:47] love and never experienced Divine
[1:36:49] Healing in the service was it something
[1:36:50] like that now we don't have to pick and
[1:36:53] choose we don't have to pick and choose
[1:36:55] we ought to have healings in the church
[1:36:57] and we ought to have brotherly love but
[1:36:58] he says if I had to pick one I'll take
[1:37:00] brotherly love over the supernatural
[1:37:01] doing healings in the
[1:37:03] church that's an amazing thought why
[1:37:06] because that's what the Holy Ghost is is
[1:37:07] its Unity above all else it's Unity it's
[1:37:10] a Oneness because it's Eternal it comes
[1:37:12] from God and it goes to God Amen and so
[1:37:14] sometimes our flaw you know in in
[1:37:17] thinking and I've I've heard it preach
[1:37:19] for a lot of my life in different places
[1:37:21] is that this Capstone of Charity comes
[1:37:22] at the end of a believer's life how are
[1:37:24] you going to live a life of Christ if
[1:37:25] you don't have the love of Christ in you
[1:37:28] in really in hind side it made no sense
[1:37:30] everybody's waiting for the Capstone as
[1:37:32] if it's at the end of their life it's
[1:37:34] that if that's not in your life you're
[1:37:35] not going to live a Christian Life in
[1:37:36] the first place because you're not even
[1:37:37] going to have the love that is required
[1:37:39] to get you through the differences
[1:37:41] that's going to make you patient that's
[1:37:43] going to make you look past somebody
[1:37:44] that didn't go the same path you did
[1:37:46] that doesn't quite believe the way you
[1:37:48] do now listen I talk with a a very
[1:37:51] well-known Minister a while back he said
[1:37:53] John don't worry if you preach the wrong
[1:37:55] thing he says I did
[1:37:56] it he says don't worry if you make
[1:37:58] mistakes I did it he says don't worry
[1:38:01] about it God will straighten it out and
[1:38:02] there's Grace for
[1:38:05] it so you got to have patience for me
[1:38:07] and I've got to have patience for
[1:38:09] you but I'm looking at the Holy Ghost
[1:38:11] I'm not looking at the flaws and what
[1:38:14] happens is when we get cold and when we
[1:38:16] get away from God our way what we forget
[1:38:18] is we forget to see the Christ in others
[1:38:21] when we pull away from him we can't see
[1:38:22] him as well in others usually the most
[1:38:24] judgmental person is the one that's
[1:38:26] furthest away from Christ in their
[1:38:28] walk that's hard but it's true the most
[1:38:31] judgmental people are usually the ones
[1:38:33] that are coldest in their true
[1:38:34] relationship with
[1:38:35] Christ
[1:38:37] amen sometimes we want everyone else to
[1:38:39] be perfect as if we ourselves are
[1:38:42] perfect there's none
[1:38:45] perfect not even me as much as I'd like
[1:38:48] to think it that's right Amen brother
[1:38:50] Paul
[1:38:52] that Paul's confirming amen but we're
[1:38:55] judged by God it's him that decides and
[1:38:57] when he gives us the Holy Ghost that's
[1:38:58] all the Judgment I care
[1:39:00] about what he's judged us
[1:39:03] ready and so he gives it to us but after
[1:39:07] this is all said and
[1:39:08] done and brother bram's gone over and
[1:39:10] he's experienced what's over there he
[1:39:12] says I am more determined than ever in
[1:39:14] my life that it takes perfect love to
[1:39:17] enter
[1:39:18] there there is no jealousy
[1:39:22] why because the only thing you take is
[1:39:24] your character and jealousy is not found
[1:39:26] in the character of a son or daughter of
[1:39:27] God he says there was no tiredness
[1:39:30] praise the Lord I'm tired I'm tired here
[1:39:34] tonight he said there was no death
[1:39:37] sickness could never be in there
[1:39:39] mortality could never make you old he
[1:39:41] says over there they could not
[1:39:47] cry he says it was just one Joy
[1:39:51] we're talking about you shall find rest
[1:39:54] Church no jealousy no tiredness no death
[1:39:59] no sickness no mortality he says you
[1:40:03] can't even cry over there it's too
[1:40:05] wonderful he says it's just one Joy
[1:40:10] where's your rest church that he has
[1:40:12] confirmed himself to you and he who
[1:40:15] started the work will be faithful to
[1:40:19] complete it he doesn't finish something
[1:40:21] he's not going to he doesn't start
[1:40:22] something he's not going to finish and
[1:40:24] that's a satisfaction that comes with
[1:40:25] the believer amen when you're filled
[1:40:27] with the spirit and you know that you
[1:40:30] know and that's really that has to be
[1:40:32] settled you've got to know and when you
[1:40:34] know that you know that you know that
[1:40:36] you've got it everything else just
[1:40:38] starts to fade away and then when Satan
[1:40:40] Rises up when hard times come When
[1:40:42] Trials Come hard decisions come when the
[1:40:44] money leaves the bank when the sickness
[1:40:45] comes in whatever it is you say I've got
[1:40:48] a rest I've got a peace I've got a
[1:40:50] source I've got a life I've got a
[1:40:52] strength I've got a token I've got an
[1:40:53] assurance and all you do is brother Ram
[1:40:55] says you go back and you take that
[1:40:56] before God and you say I'm here standing
[1:40:59] on your word because you gave me a token
[1:41:03] that I could ride this train all the way
[1:41:05] to Eternity all the way to my healing
[1:41:07] all the way to my Deliverance all the
[1:41:09] way to my guidance all the way to my
[1:41:10] provision whatever it is you told me you
[1:41:14] chose me you confirmed me you gave me
[1:41:16] this token and all I'm doing is I'm
[1:41:19] reminding you of what you gave me and
[1:41:21] the purpose it's for and I'm here to
[1:41:23] claim what belongs to me brother Braham
[1:41:26] says and so it is with every believer in
[1:41:27] God the musicians can come if we have
[1:41:30] need of Salvation or healing we rest our
[1:41:33] Eternal Soul our body upon God's Eternal
[1:41:37] promise and just take a hold of God's
[1:41:40] word and perfectly satisfied and call
[1:41:44] those things which are not as though
[1:41:47] they were and nurse away on God's
[1:41:49] promise God you promised it I believe it
[1:41:54] he says and hold to it amen God bless
[1:41:57] you let's stand and me this Capstone
[1:42:00] we've been talking about for so long
[1:42:01] it's the Holy Spirit itself this isn't
[1:42:04] for the future it's for now it's for
[1:42:07] here and it's for you and it's your
[1:42:11] source of healing it's your source of
[1:42:12] strength it's your source of Joy love
[1:42:14] peace all of these things that we have
[1:42:16] need of in our lives that's what he gave
[1:42:18] us when he gave us the Holy Ghost but
[1:42:20] it's to take us to a place where there
[1:42:22] is only rest there is only peace there's
[1:42:25] only joy you can't even cry over there
[1:42:28] that makes me want to cry here that over
[1:42:31] there I won't be able to
[1:42:33] cry
[1:42:34] amen but there's a hunger for that
[1:42:37] there's a thirst for that Paul says I'm
[1:42:38] groaning for that but that means we got
[1:42:41] to get into his
[1:42:42] presence to remind ourselves to press
[1:42:46] daily as to why it is we do the things
[1:42:50] we do the life we live the words we say
[1:42:53] the words we hold
[1:42:54] back the way things go we've got to be
[1:42:57] reminded of what's coming and that comes
[1:42:59] by getting into his presence on a daily
[1:43:01] basis amen but I'm ready to go and lay
[1:43:04] my weapons down I'm looking for a day
[1:43:06] where I don't have to sit there and
[1:43:07] struggle and fight and wonder what's
[1:43:08] around the next curve I remember when I
[1:43:11] moved here I think I've said it before
[1:43:12] and things were real easy when I first
[1:43:14] got here work they said you got a real
[1:43:16] long Landing Strip take your time they
[1:43:19] didn't work me hard and brother jald
[1:43:21] wasn't working me hard and it was just
[1:43:22] easy going and brother Joe said John he
[1:43:24] says that light at the end of the tunnel
[1:43:26] he says that's a
[1:43:28] truck because it is day in and day out
[1:43:31] what is it God's bringing things our way
[1:43:33] to grow us to mature us to test us to
[1:43:36] prove us and to prove his word in our
[1:43:38] life sometimes it's light at the end of
[1:43:40] the tunnel and sometimes it's a
[1:43:42] truck amen but through it all he brings
[1:43:45] us to rest and then we can have rest in
[1:43:47] the time of the storm I've quoted that
[1:43:49] song before says sometimes he calms the
[1:43:51] storm and other times he calms his child
[1:43:53] amen amen let's enter into that rest
[1:43:56] Heavenly
[1:43:58] Father Lord what a promise you've given
[1:44:01] us Lord what a token what an assurance
[1:44:05] Lord what a seal what a promise you give
[1:44:08] us Lord when you give us your Holy
[1:44:11] Spirit and Lord Brother Braham
[1:44:13] says we believe it but we don't really
[1:44:17] understand it and Lord we're trying to
[1:44:19] get us our elv to see Lord by Your Word
[1:44:22] what it is you've given us when you gave
[1:44:24] us the Holy Ghost Lord that it can bring
[1:44:26] us into your presence Lord that it can
[1:44:29] bring us into your word it can bring us
[1:44:31] into the realities of the word in each
[1:44:34] and every one of our Lives Lord Lord
[1:44:37] we're seeking a greater reality Lord I'm
[1:44:39] seeking a greater reality Lord I'm
