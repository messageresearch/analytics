praying that we find the strength of the Lord sing and again it's not in running but entrusting oh it's not in running but in restings [Music] amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we appreciate your affirmation Lord your confirmation this evening or for this message Lord that we're bringing or we're thankful for your goodness Your Grace Lord your presence Lord your promise that you never leave us or forsake us heavenly father so Lord we've come in once again to hear from you Lord you know each need you know each heart you know each life Heavenly Father though we're asking you to speak once again Lord that you would touch each one Lord that we would know that Lord we've been in your presence Lord that your Holy Spirit has spoken Lord and it's had an effect in each and every one of our lives but remembering those that aren't here remembering especially Lord Brother Paul and Sister Kim home Lord and brother Joe out at Hibernia brother Chad on the roads or just praying a special Grace to them Lord we pray Lord just be with us now we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you thank you sister Maureen it's like we're gone old school back to just one one musician but uh certainly appreciate it hey man we're gonna read from Matthew chapter 7 this evening Matthew chapter 7 and just trusting the lord to bless and we're going in a bit of a different direction this evening as you'll see Matthew 7 very familiar scripture this is Jesus speaking he says ask and it shall be given you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened for what man is there of you whom if his son asks bread will he give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he give him a serpent if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him amen God bless you can have your seats this evening and as I said I'm taking a bit of a diversion away from our regularly scheduled program on manifesting time and I've had this thought on my heart for quite some time and just felt to bring it tonight and and Lord willing perhaps again on Sunday to finish it out but just to bring an encouragement to the people and and just to give us some understanding as well in some of these things so I want to take a title tonight of when God answers amen when God answers and I'm starting with this wonderful verse in Matthew 7 and Jesus sets us up beautifully for what our expectations should be when we go to him in prayer amen when we go to him with the need and I like it when I read a scripture where God tells me how to set my expectation and then when he gives the absolute that he gives here in this scripture amen it sets me up for expectation we ought to be an expectation amen we've got a living God we've got a God that hears we've got a God that answers and so we have to have an expectation that he is going to do something about our situation and really what we want to talk about tonight is how he responds to situations how he responds to prayers and and God's approach and God's power and God's anointing these different things that that he has at his disposal and the things he set up so if we go back to Matthew 7 he says this ask and it shall be given you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you it says for every one that's our absolute everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be open now if we look through those scriptures if you want to see your part in it your part is to ask your part is to seek and your part is to knock that's the only thing that he asks us to do ask seek and knock he's the one that gives he's the one that helps us find and he's the one that opens the doors for us but we're the ones that have to ask we're the ones that have to seek and we're the ones that have to knock now brother brother Brandon would say this because he'd mention these this this phrase ask seek and knock so many times that we see here in Matthew 7 and he would say this he says look at Nicodemus coming to him Nicodemus was a scholar coming to a man that had no diploma he was an aristocrat coming to a pauper he was an old teacher coming to the youth he says see the difference he says but when he came he came with an open heart seeking the truth with all that Nicodemus had with all that he had learned with all of his education his Prestige his position when he came to Jesus he came with an open heart seeking truth and brother Brown comes right behind it and he says you come that way he says just come the same way with an open heart seeking truth seek and you'll find knock it'll be opened ask and you shall receive he says that's it that's the basis that Jesus said to come on so that's why we need a prophet as he comes and he puts context into this because otherwise we have this spiritual buffet in the scriptures where we can ask anything and get anything and that that's not the way God is God is not a Genie in a Bottle where we just with the prayer go up and we rub the bottle and God pops up and he says what would you have me do for you today that that's not the way it is he's not a doting grandfather amen he's a father that knows what's best for us and so what the scripture is trying to get us to do and what the prophet's saying is he's saying this is a means to an approach to get something from God but you've got to come the right way and he says that's with an open heart not with what you know or what you just believe or think in your carnality but this is you coming with an open heart to seek the truth to seek what is right in the situation amen so he's not it's not pointing us to a place where we just go and ask for things it's not where we we we go to to ask for the good things of John but it's where we go for the ask for the good things of God Amen so there's a there's a perspective that comes with this amen and the prophet saying here he said this is to find out what God says not what you say it's to find out what God thinks not what you think is to find out what God knows not what you know amen we're looking for a higher Consciousness we're looking for a higher understanding we're looking for a higher revelation of what's needed to answer our prayer not just to come in and say this is what I want you to do but to come in and say Here's Where I Am What do we do about it if I could put it that way but as I was studying this those those words about asking and knocking resonated with me about that Parable that Jesus would would talk about that widow woman who has gone through a rough time and she was seeking relief from a judge and he was the scriptures calls us the parable of the unjust judge and I want to take us back into it to catch the details this evening just quickly it says and he spoke a parable unto them to this end in other words he said here's why he said this Parable he says that men ought oh okay there's a real reason behind this brother John he's saying the reason I'm telling you this is so that you will always pray he says and not to faint so don't just pray but he says pray and don't faint pray and don't be weak about it pray and don't lose hope don't lose confidence that God's going to answer but he says we are always to pray and not to feign don't let circumstances overwhelm us but go to the one who has the answer or the response to that circumstance amen Jesus is setting the context here he says here's what you're supposed to get out of this parable and he says saying there was in the city a judge which feared not God neither regard to man what we'd say is this man was his own man he didn't answer to God he didn't believe in God he couldn't be influenced he did things the way he thought they ought to be done he was beyond influence you couldn't bribe him you couldn't pay him you couldn't influence them you couldn't do any of these things he did what he felt was right he says and there was a widow in that City and she came to him saying avenge me of my adversary and he would not for a while he didn't think she should he should do anything about it but afterward he said within himself though I fear not God nor regard man in other words I'm not doing this because she's making me doing it and I'm not doing it because God's making me doing it and I'm not doing it because man's making me doing it but he says yet because this Widow troubleth me foreign nobody makes me do anything and I'm not doing it because of her but I'm doing it because she's going to get to me eventually he says because this Widow troubles me I will Avenger lest by her continued coming she weary me so in other words that widow woman kept bothering him every time he walked out of his Courthouse she ambushed him and she said what about my situation what about my problem what about this person that's bugging me when are you going to help me out and she went and she sat outside of his office and she got his phone number she kept calling him through the night she wouldn't let him go and after a day or two he said enough's enough I don't care what the problem is I'm sick and tired of dealing her with her so I'm going to give her relief and this is an unjust man right even though I can't be influenced she's having an impact on me right he says I will avenge your lest by her continually continual coming she wearing me and then the Lord said hear what the unjust just judge saith he says and shall not God avenge his own elect which cried day and night unto him oh that's that's the part that he told us to do remember we ought to pray always but then he says though he bear along with them though he waits though he holds back though it seems like nothing's changing he says yet they cry day and night unto him that's what he's saying keep calling keep crying keep believing keep trusting even if you don't see a single thing moving remember brother Brown would talk about that scripture that says speak to the mountain and if you don't have doubt in your heart then it'll be moved into the ocean and brother Adam says you might not see it he says but just when you spoke it and you believed he says one little grain of sand from that mountain moved into the ocean it started moving you just couldn't tell and he says it'll keep moving until that ocean that thing that mountain that things in front of you is in the ocean brother Ram says this he says if you notice in the scriptures where it says seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened he says actually that's not knock like knock him once and it'll be open he that doesn't just say well I went out Lord here I am you want me no that's not it he that seeketh he that knocketh continuation and in the tape it says brother Branham knocks and knocks and knocks he says it has to compare with the rest of the scriptures see the like the unjust judge and the widow she constantly knocked on his door she was persistent if he turned her away today tomorrow she was on his hands again that's the way you want to get God he says be on his hands every morning every night every day all the time constantly he says just keep seeking keep asking keep knocking don't just knock a little while and get tired and go away just keep standing there and say Lord I'm here and I'm not going to leave I'm on your hands now I'm going to stay right here you're getting tired of listening oh that sounds like a bit of an attitude here's the attitude he says I'm having a great time knocking because I know you're coming God help us to have that kind of an attitude I'm knocking and I like being here because I know you're going to open the door at some point you know it's like a child when they know their birthday's coming and you ask them what do you want for your birthday they don't hold back do they because they know they're going to get a present now they that they don't know what present but they know they're going to get at least one present and so they give you a smorgasbord of options right a boil go all the way from a dirt bike or a quad all the way down to a candy bar and he'll give you everything in between because pair Adventure this would be the year of the dirt bike right but they ask unafraidly because you've said it's your birthday what do you want and what he's saying here is God has invited us not just invite us he's commanded us to come to him with our needs to come with him with our request to come with him with our situations and he says but when you get there don't just walk away be persistent in letting him know you're waiting for his answer that you're expecting him to make the answer not you to make the answer that you don't have to force it but he's going to work the situation out right he says amen that's when something happens he says he has to get you off his hands see so he comes out to answer you he says now Faith finds us God help us to be resilient in times of delay amen that's what we need to do because so often what happens is we will we'll be good for a day or two or a week or maybe even a month but as soon as it starts to drag out we must you know what we say that's what I've said must not be the Lord's will if you've got an unction on your heart for something stick with it if the unction goes fine walk away Lord maybe I missed your will and I shouldn't no no but if there's an unction there to approach God then keep approaching God don't let that burn out don't let that die out just because you don't see it happening doesn't mean you missed his will like we said last service the delay of the promise is not even a reflection of God's will or our faith it's a reflection of God's Sovereign choice of when it happens and that and that alone amen but but what the prophet's trying to get us to see is that you'll work if you work inside the intentions of scripture that's where the power is because what it does is all of a sudden it puts you into the place where you're working with God rather than trying to tell God what to do we're not here to tell God what to do we're not here to tell God what to do but rather we're to go to him and say Here's my issue here's my problem here's my situation here's your promise I'm here to claim it and now it's up to him to produce it amen what it puts you in a place to receive rather than to be disappointed but you know sometimes we don't know what to do there's situations I I'm praying about in my own life and in other people's lives and I don't know all the facts and so I don't know how to pray specifically there are things where I know exactly what I'm supposed to be praying for and there are things where I don't have a clue but you know what we've got an answer in the scripture for that and that's in Romans 8 and this is a very familiar scripture 8 28 is of course the one we always know but I like to go before it because it again it gives us the context and it says as for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what a man seeth why does he yet hope for in other words if you can see it that's not hope you can see it there's nothing to Hope about it's there he says but if we hope for that we see not for what we can't see then doing with patience wait for it so in other words if you're hoping for something and it's not apparent that it's coming patience is our response patience is our response right not frustration not fear but simple trust brother Josh's song serves today was perfect simple trust that the answer is on the way that's the response of the believer it says but what likewise the spirit also helps our infirmities oh he's going to talk about our infirmities he's going to talk about something that that's in us that doesn't quite work or doesn't quite function he says for we know not what we should pray for as we ought so this is Paul speaking to us naturally now because in the spirit we can pray certain things and we'll know what to do but he says as humans we don't know the Rights and Wrongs and the ins and outs of situations and we don't know what to what to do and Paul says this is an infirmity a weakness a problem because we know that we're supposed to go to God with things but he says you don't always know how to approach you don't even know what to say you don't know what to ask for but look what he says here's the here's the answer but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered the the and I found this this certainly over the last couple of months and where I've been praying and I just say Lord I don't know what to ask I don't know what to pray and I'll say I've got a a maybe an idea here I've got some insight here and I think this and I assume that and if all those things are true then this is probably the way I need to pray but I don't know I don't genuinely know I don't have first-hand experience in all these things and so I say Lord I've got to place that in your hands and you know that's perfectly acceptable in fact that's wisdom because otherwise you can end up praying against the will of God and that's not what we're supposed to be doing if you don't know put it in his hands but Paul says there's a mechanism here and he says it's the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings that cannot be under and he that searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the spirit because he makes intercession for the Saints according to the will of God so in other words the holy spirit is the thing that goes and prays for us it brings the need to God in a way that God will accept it now look what the Amplified says it says here it says so to the Holy Spirit comes to our Aid and bears us up in our weakness for we do not know what prayer to offer or how to offer it worthily as we ought but the spirit himself goes to meet our supplication and pleads in our behalf with unspeakable yearnings and groanings Too Deep for utterings sometimes you're just so burdened with something and you don't know what to do with it do this hand it over and say Lord take it just take it you see the burden and the only way to relieve it is for you to have your will in the situation so you lay it there but don't worry if you can't explain it don't worry if you can't put it into the right words that's okay lay it in his hands it says the spirit himself goes to meet our supplication and pleads in our behalf with unspeakable yearnings and groanings to deep for utterance and he who searches the hearts of men knows what is the mind of the Holy Spirit what his intent is because the spirit intercedes and pleads before God on behalf of saints according to and in harmony with God's will so catch that thought Church you're praying and you're seeking and you're needing an answer a provision or Deliverance but you don't know how to approach it you don't know the ins and outs of the situations you aren't sure how to sort the situation out and so Paul says you pray but when you pray the Holy Spirit takes that and it translates it into the will of God now I'm not saying that you're praying for it to rain in the whole and God's will is for it not to Reign and so the Holy Spirit takes what you're praying and flips at 180. no no no no no if you're praying opposite the will of God God will deal with you directly on that but if you don't know what to pray and you place it in his hand he says the Holy Spirit takes that and literally turns that prayer into a prayer for the will of God and it literally can be the trigger for God to do something that's an amazing thing to see that when we don't know what to do yet our prayer is still effective because the Holy Spirit takes it and automatically places it in alignment with the will of God now this isn't a get out of prayer free card we ought to seek we ought to ask we ought to knock we're supposed to be looking for truth in the situation but if we don't know what it is then hold our peace and leave it in God's hands until he gives us a revelation or an understanding of these things but we're about to read verse 28 and most of us know Romans 8 28 by heart but but we we look at that so often as God's going to work everything out but what he says is this is really a response to those that don't know how to work it out right it's for when we don't know how to pray or ask that this is a response to and here's the scripture we know well it says for we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are thee called according to his purpose the Amplified says we're assured and we know that God being a partner in their labor all things work together and are fitting into a plan for good to and for those who love God and are called according to his design and purpose that's a wonderful thing that's a wonderful fallback for me when I don't know what to pray to say Lord you can take that prayer and turn it into action you can turn it into something that'll make an event change or make a person change or that'll bring a healing or whatever it might be amen we are able to say Lord I'm laying it in your hands and I'm trusting you regardless we come back to Matthew 7 here and it says or what man is there of you whom if his son has spread will he give him a stone your your son your daughter comes in they say Mom I'm hungry Dad I'm hungry we give him food don't we now we may not give them the food they want but we give them food we don't give them a stone he says or if he asks the fish will he give him a serpent nobody wants to eat a snake he says we'll give him what something that's good for him he says if ye then being evil he's speaking of our base nature know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him so the thing I want to ask now then is what is good for me and as I'm preaching this evening I want you to think on that thought what is good for me because we often have ideas of what is good for me is what I'm asking for Romans 8 28 says all things work together for good what because God works it out so the answer for what is good for me is whatever God gives me what God's answer is always good if we can put it that way whatever God says that's good whatever God gives is good God's timing is perfect God's Gift God's answer God's response is always perfect but the problem is that so often the answer isn't what we expect and so we end up disappointed the prayer has been answered in terms of the need but because it didn't come the way we expected we're disappointed or sometimes we even miss the whole thing amen because what our expectation is not that God will just answer but that God will answer in a particular way and that's where we get disappointed and all of a sudden we're not satisfied or happy we've got our answer or we have the answer but it's not our expectation and so we miss out on it let me tell you Naaman the leper got a nice little surprise when he went for healing didn't he he has this little slave girl and she says all that that there is a prophet here because if they had a prophet or then then he could heal my master and and her testimony convinced Naaman to go and seek out Elisha for healing so faith of A Sort brought name into Elisha desperation perhaps and he rolls up to Elisha's house and Elisha doesn't even come out to see him a captain a general in the in the Syrian Army and the prophet won't even give him a personal meaning but rather he sends his servant out and his servant says go bathe in the River Jordan seven times and you'll be healed so so the Cure of Naaman is a supernatural cure that's been offered but Naaman wasn't expecting it to be cured that way and he almost missed his healing didn't he because remember what happened he said there ain't no way I'm doing it that's a dirty River and the servant said listen if he told you to do something tough you'd have done it this is easy but Naaman had to get his shots and he said well the rivers we got back home are so much cleaner but God had a way provided and thank God for naming sermons servants because they came and they said listen just do it like what do you lose yeah you might feel embarrassed you might feel dirty but this is what they've told you to do and in the end Naaman did it and the scripture says his skin was like a babies that's how much that was how perfect God's God's healing was for him but yet in naaman's eyes God's answer to this to his issue was completely wrong it was degrading it didn't seem right it didn't it had no logic behind it there's no special powers there's no special cleanliness in the Jordan River nothing made sense but God's answer was go dip yourself seven times in the Jordan River and after the seventh time you'll be clean and when he did it he was clean and just to show that God's provided way is not something that always appeals to our ego doesn't appeal to our our appearance it doesn't appeal to our position our placing or any of these things but if we'll obey him he always meets the need but you've got to find out what he wants us to do amen and that comes by what the word the full word that that's the problem so many times is when we're looking for things we go and we look up the portion that agrees with what we want in the situation rather than taking it from Genesis to Revelation amen we don't go to the word seeking affirmation we go to the word seeking truth and then we place our affirmation behind that as opposed to put it behind us we get behind the word the word doesn't go behind us we follow the word it's the thing that goes ahead of us amen brother Brown would say this he says that was God at the beginning he says and that's God today he cannot change he's the same God he says he heals by faith that's the way he said it at the beginning that's the mark he laid down not by your salvation not by your goodness not by your money not by your affiliation with church but by your faith that's what it is if you can't believe it he will make himself known that he's here he will make himself known that he's alive he will make himself known that he's the god of Pentecost he will make himself known in his church that he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever but he will never touch you until you touch him first that's right he will show himself but you've got to do it by what faith you got to take him at his word he says Moses had an understanding that he was to be the deliverer from the teaching of his mother and he trained himself in military might to do so but it failed see he had the understanding he had the education but that didn't work so he had to forget it all and come to the simple thing of taking God at his word and then he delivered his people the people he says yes sir God delivers by what faith in his word he always has so I want to spend some time this evening and we're not going to be long tonight but I want us to be able to recognize God when he moves because we know how he moves amen I want us to be able to rejoice when we see God moving because we know it's God moving amen and so then we can be a part of it rather than sitting on the sidelines wondering where is God Amen why because we're so busy looking over here because that's what we expect him to do and not realizing that he's right over here doing the thing we asked just in a way different than what we'd asked same effect same outcome but he's doing it his way instead of our way and so we're looking the wrong way and we completely miss the supernatural brother Brian says this he sends a savior but what does he send a savior for then he says I want to drop a little something here that'll help you there is a predestinated people that's going to receive it he says that was when he come the first time that will be when he comes the second time no matter what the church got to think about it he doesn't send it in vain somebody will receive it he says there's somebody going to get it that's all it but not the political world or the political Church whatever it is but when you cry out and God sends it somebody's going to receive it that's right so I pray we receive it if we prayed for it let's not pray for it and somebody else receive it let's not pray for it and somebody else recognize it everyone was screaming crying out for delivering then Moses come and they didn't believe him for the for the longest while they prayed for a messiah and what they wanted and I didn't go in here because of time my brother I would say they wanted a messiah to deliver them from the Romans but that's not what the Messiah was supposed to do and so they missed their Messiah because it didn't come the way they wanted he says this you think you ain't got no thing coming God has done expressed his thoughts you ain't got no right to think let the mind that was in Christ be in you and he purposed and did the will of God he said if I do not the works of God then don't believe me see you ain't got nothing coming he's the one does the thinking let his mind be in you you just think the same and that's his word he says how are you going to think different he's already expressed his thoughts to us but we want to do our thinking I think they ought to do this he says but here's God's thoughts in the Bible we ain't got no right to take different from that that's God's thoughts expressed to us we see and find the world falling apart and we're crying for something he says let's receive it the answer has been given the message has been given the spirit is speaking to the church he says you're crying out for God he was talking about peace in this and again for the sake of uh of brevity I didn't put it all in there but he says everybody's seeking peace and so they're looking to politicians and they're looking to education and they're looking for this and they're looking for that he says God's given the answer and you're too busy trying to think your way through it instead of receiving what God has already sent your way it's the same thing today we look at it I I shopped again today in in dominion and the prices keep going up and up and up and we say well if we can just get a conservative government that'll cut this tax and cut this and free a Breezer no it's gone to hell in a handbasket brother Brown said she's off the skids and she ain't coming back it's going down and we might have blips of good and blips of bad but the trend is always down because it's Satan's Eden our answer is to get out not to get through it it's to get out there's no surviving this world in the sense of that nothing's coming back amen what is it the problem is that when God sends his answer people either didn't recognize it or they didn't like it I've been reading in John and and Jesus is there and he does these wonderful Miracles and all the priests are doing is trying to suppress the information that God is in their midst out of jealousy they were trying to suppress the Messiah and then he dies and is resurrected of course they don't believe that and then the the disciples come and you see them in the book of Acts and they're doing the very same thing trying to threaten trying to suppress the power of God the answer of God the gospel that he's given the good news because it challenges their position it challenges what they thought which is he has to involve me that was the priest Folly he had to come to us he did come to you just like he came to everyone else and you didn't see him you didn't recognize him because you were of a different father Jesus said but I want to compare our expectations to how God does things and we're going to go back to Ezekiel 1 here and this is a perhaps a strange scripture for this but I think you'll see where I'm going as we get into this a little bit it says and I looked and behold a whirlwind came out of the North a great cloud and a fire unfolding itself brother Brown would say when they they did that movie on the Ten Commandments he says they got the color right and they got the shape it's a fire that turns in on itself he says and a brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof is the color of amber out of the midst of the fire and this is the Throne of God it's The Mercy Seat it's also the Judgment seat and also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures and this was their appearance they had the likeness of a man and everyone had four faces and everyone had four wings and their feet were straight feet and the soul of their feet was like the soul of a cast foot and they sparkled like the color of burnished brass and they had the hands of a man under the wings on their four sides and they had four and the four had their faces and their wings their wings were joined one to another they turned up when they went they went everyone straight forward as for the likeness of their faces they forehead the face of a man the face of a lion the face on the right side therefore had the face of an ox on the left side they four also had the face of an eagle he says thus were their faces and their wings were stretched up where two wings of everyone were joined one to another and two covered their bodies and they went everyone straight forward now you've got four different points four different sides and he says they all went straight forward and that doesn't make a lot of sense but we'll explain in a minute he says wither the spirit was to go they went and they turned not when they went so this is the key scripture to capture here in other words they only went in One Direction at any time right they weren't operating simultaneously but if the eagle was leading they went in the direction of the eagle if the lion was leading they went in the direction of the line if the man was lean they went there and if it was the ox they went that way but based on where the spirit will go you have four beasts four anointings four powers as we'll get into this and they go in One Direction they're not fighting they're not contrary one to another but they're always working together but the leader is the primary power or anointing okay it says As for the likeness of the living creatures their appearance was like burning coals of fire and like the appearance of lamps and went up and down among the living creatures and the fire was bright and out of the fire went forth lightning and the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning they ran and returned oh they're coming and going they're doing something and then they're coming back they're doing something and coming back and it's like this one man through there one minute they're not and there's a light that happens every time they do it now Ezekiel doesn't say this is the throne or The Mercy Seat but John doesn't it it gives us a better understanding perhaps of what's going on so if we go in Revelation 4 and 6 it says but Before the Throne there was a sea of glass like under Crystal and in the midst of the throne and round about The Throne were four beasts full of eyes before and behind and the first Beast was like a lion the second like a cat the third had a face as a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle you notice the eagle is flying it's in action it's moving now brother Brown would spend a lot of time talking about this and for the sake in time I'm going to condense it down quickly so we can understand that in the Old Testament they had four banners they had four tribes that were on either side of the Tabernacle the Tabernacle was in the center of the camp of Israel when they were in the desert and that was where the presence of God was that was where the word was that was the Shekinah Glory that was where the pillar of fire and the pillar of cloud hung in the camp so God was in the middle and you had four standards you had Judah which was the lion you had Reuben which was the man you had Ephraim which was the ox and you had Dam which was the eagle and brother Brown would say this he'd say now Reuben was the man he was the first one the weakest one of the bunch now I want to stop here because he doesn't say he's weak he says he's the weakest but don't let you think that's weak because it's God's power this is a power that guards God and it's a power that goes out from God he says it's the weakest and he gives us the reason why but he doesn't say it's weak it's just not as strong as the others and we'll see this as we go further into it this service and the next he says didn't Jacob say so in Genesis 49 Reuben Thou Art the first of my strength but like water you went up on my couch and defiled my couch he said live with his father's concubine see that's the immorality of the human being you see the animal doesn't have immorality the lion none of these things has that but the man does he runs with the next man's wife and so forth he's saying the problem with a man anointing is that men are easily corrupted they can turn to their own lust they can turn to their own desires and that's what trips them up every time but God can use a man anointing God can use a man to do things but that's not the most powerful anointing but it's still one of God's anointings one of God's powers he says now this down here Dan was an eagle and Reuben was the man's face ephraims the ox and the that's the way they camped in the Bible now if you'll notice Dan is the head of three tribes Judah is the head of three tribes ruins the head of three tribes and Ephraim is the head of three tribes three fours is twelve it's the Twelve Tribes of Israel see each one with their banner and the banner of Judah was a lie in the band of Reuben man the banner of Ephraim and ox and the banner of damn was an eagle he says now look back here what John said and one had the face let's read here now just see if it isn't the same thing that was like in heaven it says the first Beast was like a lion Judah second beast was like a calf that's a young Ox third Beast was the face of a man and the fourth Beast was a flying eagle just exactly the tribes of Israel camped around guarding their Earthly guards of the right to the ark okay so I'm just trying to wrap this up quickly brother but I'm saying what Ezekiel Saw is the same thing that John saw so he says they're connected somehow he says oh Hallelujah don't you see it hear Mercy The Mercy Seat nothing could come anywhere around it without Crossing those tribes Crossing what the lion crossing the man the intelligence of the man crossing the Workhorse as an ox or crossing the eagle the swiftness of it see the heaven the Earth is between and all around you see they were guards and above it was the pillar of fire he said brother nothing touched that Mercy Seat without the approach you had to come through one of those anointings you had to come through one of those guards you had to come through one of those Powers now if you read the Seven Seals you read the seven Church ages you understand that those beasts were the literal anointings of God to meet the challenge for every age okay as Believers as message Believers we ought to know that this is the key to where we're going today God answered Satan's challenge by four different anointings by four different powers amen and nothing's changed today it's the same thing in the Old Testament what John What was seen in the Old Testament what Ezekiel Saw what the Israelites typed out John salm in the New Testament so God's been doing this all along and we'll see it certainly as we go through this how the how that this works and brother man would say this he says the first one we find out was the lion that was the first Beast that went forth to meet the challenge of that day he says the lion of the tribe of Judah after him come the next beast and we find out the next Beast was an ox which is a beast of burden a sacrificed in the days of the Roman Cathedral the church died out sacrificed the next to come was a man was a beast with the face of a man and that man was the reformers men's education Theology and so forth he says and the last Beast was to fly the last piece that was to come the Bible said it was a flying eagle it says hallelujah the prophet said in this day it shall be light you'll notice it can be dark on Earth but it can be light in the heavens and only the eagle can go to where there's light in a time of Darkness because it can Fly Above the Clouds and then it can go where no other bird can go but I want you to stop and consider this what the prophet's saying is you can't uh you can't fight the anointing of your age if you want to overcome you can't say I want to I want to overcome this way when God has already given a power to overcome so the first church age he says was a lion and we saw that in the Acts of the Apostles they came out with the power of a lion and nothing stood before them but a transition quickly to a sacrifice because they all died they were all persecuted and then they were all martyred and then the church goes into the Dark Ages and they die out and the anointing for that day was to die and you couldn't say well I'm going to take this Bible and I'm going to confound them I'm going to show the world how silly they are because it didn't matter they just laughed at you threw you into the pit with lines or threw you into the arena with Gladiators and they killed you anyways what you said wasn't going to change anything because that was not God's response God's response was that you would lay down your life and the thing is they were anointed to do it and it got to the place where they would willingly give their lives you didn't have to take it but they would willingly Place their heads on The Chopping Block they would walk up to be burned they would give themselves to the animals they didn't fight it because they were anointed to respond the way that God had anointed them to do it but if you fought that anointing or you didn't have that anointing you weren't going to overcome you'd be screaming and kicking and crying the whole time because you weren't anointed to give your life but now you come to Martin Luther's day and Wesley's day and the reformers it wasn't time to give your life it was time to stand up and use the the truth use the intelligence use the logic the theology brother Brown would say of the scriptures to confound and literally this was the that was the weakest power he said was the power of man and yet it broke the back of the Catholic Church why because God was in it that's the point is to catch the anointing and be under it amen so if you fought the anointing you'd never get anywhere in that age because you were outside of God's way of doing things brother I would say those four beasts they had four faces one had the face like a a man the other one had a face like an ox Like an Eagle like a lion he says they never went backwards they couldn't go backwards look they could not go backwards because every way they went they were going forward I probably should have picked her up put a picture up here because they're all facing outwards from the Throne of God any Direction they go us forward so you think well the Lion's backing up no it's just the bear going forward or whichever one is on the opposite side right they're always going forwards he says if they went this way they were going like a man if they went this way they were going like a line if they went this way they were going like an eagle they went this way they were going like an oxy they couldn't going back be go backwards they were going forward all the time why because God doesn't back up God's answer is always move forward you never see God saying call a retreat we call a retreat Joshua had to call a retreat because they got out of the will of God but God's answer is always go forward it's hold or go forward it's never go backward God's response is always press the battle keep going forward he would say this he says now the beast in the Bible represents power and you notice these beasts were not out of Yonder in the lake or in the sea somewhere coming up but they were at the Throne of God and they were worshiping God these four beasts means four powers that come up out of the earth and those four powers were the four gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John and he says one doesn't contradict one another you look at the approach that they're they take and and again we won't we won't go into it for the sake of time but Luke is way different than John John's a prophetic eye he sees in a way different he starts out in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God the Word was God Luke's a physician he's a teacher he's an intellectual one and so he's bringing the facts and you see these different ones and they're different approaches but he says they don't contradict one another now catch this he says as the gospel Goes Forth like a lion it's Stern and it's bold the gospel is brave like a lion it's a king like a lion he says if it goes never seen movement we're seeing something happening it goes towards a man's face it's cunning insured like a man if it goes the eagle it's got the Swift wings and the high heights see what I mean if it goes like the ox it's the Workhorse that can pull the work Ox that can pull the burden of the Gospel so he's saying in every aspect it's the word moving in power it's God moving in power under a specific anointing or characteristic he says the four beasts was the four powers which were Matthew Mark Luke and John he says the four gospels that ring out in the presence of God so they speak and they move this is God moving in some form or fashion and it's an anointing of his choice he says if you notice they had eyes in front and in the back everywhere it went it reflected they seen everywhere they were going he says and that's the power of the gospels as it goes out wow so that means sometimes God's using a man anointing sometimes he's using an ox anointing sometimes an eagle and sometimes a lion he says it's got the sureness of a man it's got the swiftness of an ego it's got the power the pulling power the bird and bear like an ox it's got the sterness and boldness of a lion see it's the four gospels which are the four powers of the Revelation the fourth chapter so these are the powers within God's word they're the powers within God's Own anointing and they go out from the Throne of God to perform the word of God that's what they do so you've got to work within the anointings that are there amen our anointing is an eagle anointing and that's an anointing to fly away egos don't stick around to fight they would they just take off and they head for the heights because they can go higher than any other bird notice the problems don't cease to exist in the eagle anointing the problems don't go away the eagle goes away problem's still there but they've got an anointing that raises them up above it amen and we're under that anointing because we're in a resurrection in a Rapture season it's the fly out of here it's to go above our problems rather than go through them or to die to them or under them brother I would say this way he says every time a religious power went forth to meet the challenge of the political power of the world when the lion raised up the religious power it went to meet the Roman power and then when come the sacrifice hour of the ox went because he's the sacrifice beast of the Lord then comes the reformers down through the church Ages come to the face of a man and the reformers has been since Luther Wesley Calvin on down the Pentecostal age but in the last message that went forth there came a flying eagle he says it's Eagle time reveal time the word of God May manifest the word of God proved he says o children walk into this baptism of the Holy Spirit come in and believe it with all your heart and God will fill you so that's the anointing we're under but remember we're speaking about when God answers because he sends them out he sends out an anointing he sends out a power to produce the word so God can choose which one he answers with in our different lives because none of these single anointings is the full expression of God's power but together combined they express the way that God works or the way that God has elected to work if I could put it that way together they show us how God responds to what Satan's doing down here on Earth if anybody uses them individually as the need arises and as he deems the best response so Brian would say brother Brian would say this way he says in Matthew Mark Luke and John these gospels are standing there guarding and and again I didn't put the whole thing in here but he says they're guarding the Acts of the Apostles they're determining how the holy spirit is going to move they're guarding the moving of the Holy Spirit remember we read the Scripture it says that they moved as the spirit went forth so the Holy Spirit moving God moving is through one of these channels it says the wisdom of a man the power of a lion the work of an ox and the swiftness of an eagle so I've read that at a couple different ones there just to to set that and this is just before the breach this is in the breach between the seven Church ages and the Seven Seals and this is right before he's about to preach the seals so he's preaching this under traditional inspiration but now he comes into the fifth seal which I'm going to read now and remember brother Branham didn't preach those under inspiration he wrote them because the angel told him what to say he didn't have to sit there and wonder okay am I catching the thought of God the angel came down and brother Branham wrote it out line by line word by word and he preached directly from what the angel told him to say because brother Brown said remember he said if I he says I'd studied it and I'd studied and I'd looked at it all and I put it together he says I would have preached it wrong if I went up with what I had come up with dead wrong but that angel came down and told him what every single one of those seals meant I was talking to brother Kingsley doing our Bible study and I was reading the the Seven Seals and I I said does this mean anything to you no I said doesn't mean anything to me either without a prophet there's nothing in there there's people got portions of it but nobody got it all and nobody could place it in time and in season and then show us where we're inside of it as well it took a profit and that prophet got it because an angel came and stood over his shoulder and said this is what it means write it down and he told him where to start and he told him where to stop and he obeyed that's why we know the things that we know today but look at what he says now he's preaching this so the angel told him what I'm about to tell you this is the highest Authority you can get from a Prophet this is thus saith the Lord he says we find out in the church ages that those four beasts meaning four powers was gathered around the acts of the Apostle just the way that the Tabernacle in the wilderness he says how we drew it out here and showed this just exactly they were watching over this the lamb and the word now what's the purpose of these four beasts he says to perform the word just as they did the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy place in the wilderness and so forth so these four anointings are God are from God are there to perform the word of God they're to anoint people there to intervene in situations they're the counterbalancer the antidote they are God's response to what Satan's trying to do to kill us to destroy us to mess things up so under these four anointings if we could look at these way these four powers God always brings a response so you know what that tells me sometimes God comes by the powers of man's Wisdom sometimes God's answer is through what we would say is a man's Wisdom sometimes God Answers by the raw power of a lion through the pure power of the Supernatural and he overwhelms he just destroys whatever's in front of him nothing stands in front of a lion he's the king of the beasts and so he just walks in and he just scatters everything and sometimes God Answers by way of sacrifice and of giving you the power to Bear the burden of the Gospel and that's just a supernatural as the lion anointing and then he said sometimes God answers Us by just taking us right above the situation problem doesn't change but he takes us to a place where it doesn't matter we're literally so secure we're so at re at rest so at peace that nothing happens and we're just taken to a Heavenly place and what happens happens and whether it goes the way we want it or not it doesn't matter because we're above the situation we've got our eyes set on something else amen but here's the problem we always want the raw power of the lion or the FlyAway capability of the eagle don't we humanly that's what we want we want to either Fly Above the situation get away from it or we want God to destroy it we got want God to just come in and just brah like the Hulk or Superman just come in and and wreck everything and just make it go the way that we want to but God has four ways of responding not the two that we love that means sometimes he's going to work through a man and sometimes he's going to work by giving you power to just carry the burden amen there are anointings their powers and no matter the situation the power that he gives you will anoint you for the situation and it's God's choice God's Sovereign Choice God's Sovereign will that determines how he answers in every situation that we face in our life and you'll know by the anointing that's on you to handle the situation there are situations I've had in my life and I know it's happened in yours where you literally speak the word and it happens that's a lie in anointing there's situations where somebody had a conversation with us they're situations where medicine has done it and that's the word that's the wisdom of a man and then there's been times where nothing changed except that we suddenly just Shrugged into the into the braces we we we settled into the harness and we just kept walking when everybody else would have fallen behind us and then there's those ones where you just get in the presence of God and he lifts you up to a point where it doesn't matter and every one of those is just as Supernatural as the other because they're an anointing from God to take you through the situation gonna close with a scripture and then just just a bit of a long quote here Matthew 6 8 says this for your father knoweth what things ye have need of before you ask him these Powers were here these anointings were here before I ever took Breath of Life on this Earth before you ever did it before your situation never came God has already prepared a way to answer a way to anoint a way to intervene on our behalf amen listen to these quotes we've got four here before we close he says now that's the only way I've always found it that I can get anything from God is to take him at his word oh that's wonderful Brother John and believe it the way he sends it oh that's where we trip up isn't it he says now if we do not take it just the way that we think it is we've built God as an idol he's got to answer just according to our ways or well it's just no good he didn't answer us God answers in many ways he answers in Peculiar ways times and everything is odd he says we'll take for instance Moses Moses was 80 years old he was almost you might think too old for God to deal with brother Branham led a woman to Christ at the age of 92. and he saw her on the other side remember when he went beyond the curtain of time and she said my precious brother says who are you young beautiful woman she said I was 92 years old when you led me to the Lord it's never too late until you're gone he says he was always you might think too old for God to deal with he was an old man unexpected in his age to be dealt with with God another thing he was under Mount Orab an unexpected Place God met him at an unexpected age at an unexpected place in an unexpected way God didn't meet Moses the way he usually met men he said he met Moses in an unusual way in the way that he chose to meet Moses in nobody ever had a burning bush experience before there there is no precedent in scripture to say hey if you want to meet God look for the burning bush no God chose how to reveal himself to Moses he says that's the way he answers our prayer in the way that he thinks is best and his way is always right can we say that together and his way is always right do we believe it God help us to believe it his way is always right if we ask for anything and it doesn't happen just the way we think that God ought to let it happen then that makes us lose and fall back he says let's ask God stand firm on the word say it's true and just receive it the way he sends it that's the way you've got to believe God he says it may come disguised it may come in another way around about that way he says but no matter what way it comes if we have asked we shall receive that's the anchor that's the resting place of the Christian is I have asked and he says if you ask you shall receive if you knock it'll be opened if you seek you'll find so believe that you're going to get it but don't tell him how to do it he says God said so that settles it forever if God says so now when you get to taking God like that and believing now Moses what if he said I prayed for God to make me a military man and here he is in a burning bush it don't make any difference how God appeared to him just so he appeared that's all that matters here as long as God comes and answers and as long as we recognize it to be God amen God bless you let's stand this evening yeah I'm reminded of that that story and I think it's a it may be a Chinese Parable I don't know of a of a man and an older man and uh you know he's he has a son and and uh they're out and they managed to catch a wild horse a wild stallion and and the the the the the village comes up and they say oh how wonderful how blessed you got a stallion you know a wild horse and you know you didn't have to pay any money for it and the man said maybe so maybe not and so a few days later the sun was out in the in the Corral and he was or the you know in the the area there and he was trying to break the stallion he was trying to get it to a place where he could ride it and it threw him off and broke his leg and all the villagers gathered around and said oh what poor luck that's horrible and the man said well maybe so maybe not and then the next week the emperor soldiers came through and they were conscripting all of the able young men to come and fight in the war but because the sun had a broken leg they didn't take him and all the people said well you're so blessed and he said maybe so maybe not why because we never know what's going to happen next we never know what God has in store and so we can look at things and we can say this ain't what I asked for or this isn't what I would expect but as a child of God we've got Romans 8 28 to fall back on that he works everything for our good and so whether it's going the way we expect it or not expected whether it's moving whether it's not moving whatever the situation is we can say blessed be the name of the Lord that's what job said Joe was the wealthiest man on the earth and when everything went down the gutter all job could say the Lord gives the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord and it says and job did not do foolishly he didn't curse God foolishly in flare up this isn't what I wanted this is what I asked this isn't the way I told you to do it God how arrogant we can get sometimes without thinking it in all sincerity trying to tell God what to do as opposed to saying Lord here's my need I need an answer will you give me the answer and when you ask you'll receive when you'll seek you'll find and when you'll knock he'll open up the door but he'll do it in his way amen not ours but we're going to take this in the next service and we're going to go into some examples in the scriptures and and even things that brother Brandon would say about this so we can understand that sometimes we've literally got the very blessing the very answer we've been looking for and we don't even realize that God did it and it was just as Supernatural as if he came down from heaven and did it in our midst or something like that amen let's just pray together if we would Heavenly Father Lord You're a wonderful God Lord and you're wonderful because you don't hide these things from us Lord but you open your word and you send a prophet our way Lord
