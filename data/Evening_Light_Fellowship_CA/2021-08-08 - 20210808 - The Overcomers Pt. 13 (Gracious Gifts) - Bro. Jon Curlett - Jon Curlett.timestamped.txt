[44:47] things happen when we all gather

[44:51] dad wanted to pass on thanks to the
[44:53] church for prayers
[44:54] for each one of you he said he felt

[45:33] and we prefer our brother or sister over
[45:35] ourselves amen
[45:37] that's what he did
[45:39] amen the first fruits the first at the
[45:41] second adam you know the the first of
[45:43] many brethren he sacrificed everything

[45:56] ephesians 4 we're going to continue
[45:58] of course on our overcomer series this
[46:00] morning
[46:01] we read this last time but we're going
[46:02] to go a couple extra verses this morning
[46:04] and then ephesians 4 verse 4 says there
[46:06] is one body and one spirit even as ye
[46:09] are called in one hope of your calling
[46:12] one lord one faith one baptism one god
[46:15] and father of all who is above all and
[46:18] through all and in you all amen amen in
[46:21] you all
[46:22] amen not just to the men behind the
[46:24] pulpit not just to the gifted ones that
[46:26] we see walking around but it is in you
[46:28] all amen this is to the overcomers this
[46:30] is to the church of the living god this
[46:32] is to the bride of christ each and every
[46:34] one male or female amen no matter where
[46:36] you're from no matter the color of your
[46:38] skin amen this has nothing to do with it
[46:40] if you have the holy ghost he is in you
[46:42] all amen
[46:43] but unto every one of us
[46:46] again every one of us
[46:48] is given grace according to the measure
[46:50] of the gift of christ
[46:52] wherefore he saith when he ascended up
[46:54] on high he led captivity captive and
[46:57] gave gifts unto men amen you can have
[47:00] your seats may the lord bless the
[47:01] reading of his word this morning
[47:02] amen as i said we're going to continue
[47:04] in our series on the overcomers and i
[47:06] want to take a title of gracious gifts
[47:09] this morning amen we're going to talk
[47:10] about the five-fold ministry but we're
[47:12] not just going to limit it to the
[47:13] five-fold ministry as you'll see as we
[47:15] go through amen but we're starting to
[47:17] get a transition now in this series
[47:18] where we've talked a lot about the
[47:19] preparation we've talked a lot about the
[47:21] the surrender we've talked a lot about
[47:23] the character development we've talked a
[47:25] lot about finding the will of god in
[47:26] these things and now we're starting to
[47:28] make the transition to where you know
[47:30] and you believe and god has said now is
[47:32] the time and now it's time to go in and
[47:34] really start doing your part amen that
[47:36] we don't just have a joshua here like we
[47:38] did then a great general a one man to
[47:40] lead us a prophet as it were but now
[47:42] we've got individual jobs to do and
[47:44] that's where we're going to start to
[47:45] take this as we go because we see that
[47:47] moses in his ministry his anointing was
[47:49] spread out over what a number of men to
[47:51] help him out in the ministry and when
[47:52] joshua leaves he commissions every one
[47:54] of those people he says go out and do
[47:56] the works that i did go and do the exact
[47:58] same thing that i did and you'll have
[47:59] success as long as you live your life
[48:01] the way that i live as long as you keep
[48:03] that word in your mouth as long as you
[48:04] meditate on it as long as you don't turn
[48:06] from the from the right or to the left
[48:07] just go straight with it he says you'll
[48:09] have the same success and you'll
[48:10] complete the work that god got me to
[48:12] start in this land of canaan amen
[48:14] but amen we're not here just to be
[48:16] sitting in our houses we're not here we
[48:18] talk about separation from the world
[48:20] we're not here to sit in our houses and
[48:21] say well i'm separate from the world and
[48:23] then god doesn't give us the holy ghost
[48:25] so that we'll sit around and do nothing
[48:26] but he's given it to us to operate in us
[48:28] so that we can be him to a dying world
[48:30] amen that they can have a witness that
[48:32] christ is alive and well today that he
[48:34] didn't just die on a cross he didn't
[48:36] just raise i mean it's a tremendous
[48:38] thing to say he raised but he is still
[48:39] alive forever more amen and he's living
[48:41] in a multi-member bride in this day and
[48:43] age amen
[48:45] amen so we want to be able to find our
[48:47] place in christ and we know that 2000
[48:49] years ago jesus christ was the fullness
[48:51] of the godhead bodily and then after
[48:53] that what happened he poured everything
[48:55] that he was into a church body amen he
[48:57] pulled it poured it into a multi-member
[48:59] body called the mystical body of christ
[49:01] and that is who we are amen if you have
[49:03] the holy ghost in this age you are part
[49:05] of the members
[49:06] of the body of christ and then you have
[49:08] to be the reflection that he was in your
[49:10] part and your portion for this age
[49:13] brother branham said
[49:15] when we saw christ that was the most of
[49:16] god we could ever see in one person i
[49:18] mean that was the fullness in a perfect
[49:20] body he wasn't in a sin body and then
[49:22] you say well what about brother branham
[49:24] or something like that no he's still in
[49:25] a sim body he still had he still had
[49:27] fleshly desires he still had issues he
[49:28] still had complexes and if you look
[49:30] closely and you're looking for you'll
[49:32] see it in the things that he says from
[49:33] time to time he himself says it you know
[49:35] we're not going in and being critical
[49:37] but he brings out his mistakes over the
[49:39] pulpit many times he says oh i made a
[49:40] mistake here i meant this or i didn't
[49:42] quite have the revelation i've got to
[49:43] correct it now on these different things
[49:45] christ never made a mistake he never had
[49:46] a flaw he never had a failure in his
[49:48] life he was the perfect god amongst us
[49:51] amen and well that's the the most we'll
[49:52] ever see in one person but now we've got
[49:54] to be able to see him in portions in
[49:56] each and every one of us amen
[49:58] brother branham said this he says by one
[50:00] spirit we're all baptized into one body
[50:02] and that body is christ which is the
[50:04] royal seed of abraham and heirs to
[50:06] everything that's in it amen everything
[50:08] that was in god god poured into christ
[50:11] everything that was in christ he poured
[50:13] into the believer amen god above us god
[50:16] with us and god in us everything every
[50:19] promise in the book is yours if you can
[50:21] believe it if you have faith enough to
[50:24] accept it and believe it now amen
[50:26] brother braham showing us he said it was
[50:27] god above us god the father god with us
[50:30] in a man called jesus christ now he says
[50:32] we have god in us which is the holy
[50:33] spirit and there is no distinction
[50:35] between those three we do not have three
[50:37] gods we have what three manifestations
[50:39] of god and so when he comes in us we
[50:41] have yet another manifestation of god
[50:43] amen we don't just look to a christ of
[50:45] 2000 years ago and say there was god in
[50:47] flesh but we have to be able to look to
[50:49] each other and look into yourself i mean
[50:51] it's so much easier to see it in your
[50:52] brother and sister sometimes but you
[50:54] have to be able to look in the mirror
[50:55] and say there is christ now amen there
[50:57] is the word being made manifest and look
[51:00] past the faults and look past the
[51:01] failures and say yet it is still christ
[51:03] within me amen that it is the the
[51:05] perfect word inside of me and the only
[51:07] thing that's hindering it is this this
[51:08] fleshly veil amen
[51:10] amen brother branham says again he says
[51:13] oh god if the world could only see this
[51:16] that god and man are one
[51:19] now he's not talking about himself here
[51:21] and we'll cover this in detail as we go
[51:23] further he says if the world could only
[51:25] see that god a man or one guess what
[51:26] it's not just the world has to see it we
[51:28] have to see it amen the church of the
[51:30] living god has to see it the super sign
[51:32] was that first man that god could come
[51:35] into all that god was he poured into
[51:37] christ and all that christ was he poured
[51:39] into the church now listen he says super
[51:42] sign god and man together that was to be
[51:45] the super sign of the last day when the
[51:48] entire bible was to be fulfilled in the
[51:50] last days and again we want to put that
[51:53] on brother branham but he doesn't say
[51:54] that he pushes it all the way to the
[51:56] rest of us amen just like joshua it
[51:58] doesn't stop with joshua but it has to
[52:00] continue in the bride because if you are
[52:02] of him then the same works that he does
[52:04] you'll do also and brother branham how
[52:06] many times did he say the same works
[52:07] that christ did you do also he didn't
[52:09] say i do he was already doing it but he
[52:11] said you've got to do the same works not
[52:13] just ministry but laity amen the whole
[52:15] church is supposed to be doing the works
[52:17] of christ whatever it might be your
[52:19] portion for that age amen and so what
[52:21] the nominal world has missed christ in
[52:23] christ the word christ the word you have
[52:25] to look at it as the word not christ the
[52:27] man but christ the word and the nominal
[52:29] world has missed him in every age that
[52:31] he's come you asked them where was he
[52:33] ten thousand or a thousand years ago 500
[52:35] years ago they can't point you to him
[52:37] even the church today even the lutheran
[52:39] church wouldn't say that luther was
[52:41] christ for his day would they
[52:43] they just say he was just another
[52:44] believer that you know they they don't
[52:46] recognize that was christ for their day
[52:48] and then wesley comes along and it's the
[52:50] same thing and then the pentecostal age
[52:51] that was god for their day and now he's
[52:53] in what he's in us and that is the last
[52:55] time we are the final sign brother
[52:57] branham's ministry was the last global
[52:59] sign they'll get where they could see it
[53:01] on tv they could see it on video and
[53:02] these different things we have that now
[53:04] but the the gifts are not the same as
[53:06] they were before that was their final
[53:07] sign to say god's here and he's calling
[53:09] out a bride and now it's the bride's
[53:10] turn to just say we're the called out
[53:12] ones amen and we're we're him now and
[53:14] that's the only place you're ever going
[53:16] to see him or find him yes sir brother
[53:18] brown continues he says now lord let it
[53:20] be known that thou art god and i have
[53:22] called this audience together at your
[53:24] command this is a message called the
[53:26] sign of the messiah now and i'm standing
[53:28] here not to be seen or not to try to be
[53:31] acting big or doing something different
[53:34] but it's because it's a commission
[53:35] charged me by an angel and confirmed by
[53:38] your word
[53:39] let it be known tonight that your jesus
[53:41] christ the son of god that raised from
[53:43] the dead and you live in your church in
[53:46] your people to perform and carry out the
[53:49] same ministry you had when you were here
[53:52] in the body of flesh again he's not
[53:54] pointing to me he says i'm not here to
[53:56] make something big of me but lord you
[53:58] dwell in your church in your people to
[54:01] do the same things that you were doing
[54:02] while you were here on earth amen the
[54:04] same ministry not just in a prophet not
[54:07] just in a five-fold ministry if we could
[54:08] put it that way but he says you dwell in
[54:10] your people which is all inclusive amen
[54:13] each and every one of us we have
[54:15] different body parts amen if we look at
[54:16] our bodies we have different parts they
[54:18] do different things it's the same in the
[54:19] body of christ we don't criticize our
[54:21] finger amen because it can't chew food
[54:24] no that's the function for something up
[54:26] here but it brings food to the mouth so
[54:27] it can eat and without it the mouth
[54:29] would have a really tough time getting
[54:30] food because you'd have to plop your
[54:32] face down in your plate and you'd make a
[54:33] big mess of it but that hand now can
[54:35] bring it to your mouth and then that
[54:37] will bring the energy right back to the
[54:38] hand to keep feeding the body in these
[54:40] different things so everyone has a
[54:41] different portion everyone has a
[54:43] different role and every part has to be
[54:45] doing what it's supposed to do in order
[54:47] for the body to function efficiently and
[54:49] perfectly amen and the lovely thing is
[54:51] that god has a divine order for all of
[54:53] this amen we don't sit here and choose
[54:55] it but god has made a divine order he
[54:57] has placed in the body all the needs
[54:58] that it has need all the gifts that it
[55:00] has need of all the abilities all the
[55:03] talents all of those things are there so
[55:05] that the body can do what it needs to do
[55:07] amen
[55:08] what is it doing it's getting the body
[55:10] ready for a rapture that's the only
[55:11] thing we're here in life that's the only
[55:12] thing that that's brother brahm said
[55:14] what do you see next he says the only
[55:15] thing i see is a resurrection a rapture
[55:17] there's nothing left to be fulfilled
[55:19] and then ephesians 4 will continue it
[55:21] says there is one body one spirit even
[55:23] as you are called and one hope of your
[55:25] calling one lord one faith one baptism
[55:27] one god and father of all who is above
[55:29] all and through all and in you all now
[55:31] let's set one thing straight we said
[55:32] this last service but let's say it again
[55:34] god is in control amen in everything
[55:36] that he's going to say from this point
[55:38] on in the scripture he's reminding us at
[55:40] the very beginning this is god amen it's
[55:42] not me saying this it is god saying this
[55:44] it is god bringing it to you and
[55:46] everything that he brings from this
[55:48] point on that i'm talking to you about
[55:49] it's going to be god operating in it if
[55:51] it's a true gift if it's a true
[55:52] anointing if it's a true man if it's a
[55:54] true woman if it's a true child of god
[55:56] god is going to be the one that's in
[55:57] control amen
[56:00] god's the only one running the show
[56:02] he's the only one running the show and
[56:03] the true believer amen
[56:07] listen to this brother brahms says god
[56:08] never intended the church to be run by
[56:11] men
[56:11] god runs his church and he runs it
[56:14] through gifts of the spirit
[56:16] the gifts of the spirit is in the church
[56:19] to correct the spirit
[56:21] that's your natural spirit i mean that's
[56:23] the human spirit right that's your
[56:25] personal ideas and thoughts and memories
[56:28] and all these different things it's
[56:29] there to correct that human nature
[56:31] that's in you
[56:32] he's got five ministerial officers in
[56:34] his church the first of them is apostles
[56:36] or missionaries missionaries the highest
[56:38] calling there is the apostle the word
[56:40] missionary means one cent the apostle
[56:42] means one cent he says why they ever
[56:44] chose to be called a missionary i don't
[56:45] know but they are apostles that's all
[56:48] right
[56:49] apostles prophets teachers evangelist
[56:51] pastors now that's the elected offices
[56:55] of god to his church now let me stop
[56:57] there because we see that word elected
[56:59] and we think well we elected a pastor we
[57:02] elect the ministry but that's not what
[57:03] he's talking about he's saying that's
[57:04] elected by god that was ordained by god
[57:08] before the foundation of the world amen
[57:10] and you look in the scriptures and talks
[57:11] about isaiah and he says i knew you
[57:13] before you're born in jeremiah and i
[57:15] knew you before you were formed in your
[57:16] mother's belly then and i ordained you
[57:18] to be a prophet unto this and that the
[57:20] ministry is ordained before the
[57:21] foundation of the world and you can't
[57:23] make a man a minister and you can't make
[57:25] a man not a minister amen that is the go
[57:28] the working of god amen and it has to be
[57:30] there so you don't elect a pastor god
[57:32] creates a pastor amen you don't elect an
[57:34] evangelist god creates an evangelist you
[57:36] don't elect an apostle you don't elect a
[57:38] prophet they are whether you accept them
[57:40] or not amen
[57:42] amen so a man cannot be elected into an
[57:44] office by people he either is or he
[57:46] isn't and it is god's doing not his
[57:48] doing that's going to do it amen now the
[57:50] people's thoughts are ideas about that
[57:52] man sure it's going to have an impact
[57:54] but it doesn't determine whether or not
[57:55] that man is gifted in the ministry amen
[57:58] i've seen people do it they'll put a man
[58:00] behind the pulpit that wasn't meant to
[58:02] be there
[58:03] and all of a sudden what happens is the
[58:04] church comes to a screeching halt
[58:06] because that man was not ordained for
[58:08] that position doesn't mean he's not a
[58:09] minister for instance but maybe he's not
[58:11] a pastor and then so he comes in he
[58:13] tries to pastor and what he's doing is
[58:15] he's blowing up the church because an
[58:16] evangelist will come in he'll stir up
[58:18] the waters and then he's getting all the
[58:20] trash out but you get a church that's
[58:21] always constantly being riled up and
[58:23] they never get settled and then they
[58:24] have to be established on the word so
[58:26] you get an evangelist behind the pulpit
[58:27] that's not going to work very long for a
[58:29] pastor the church will be up in arms and
[58:31] you'll have a you'll have an altar call
[58:32] every service but you'll never have any
[58:34] any stability they won't know who they
[58:36] are they'll be constantly questioning it
[58:37] because his goal is to keep sin out of
[58:39] the camp rather than to establish the
[58:40] people amen which is the work of a
[58:42] pastor and a teacher they establish the
[58:44] people the evangelist comes in and gets
[58:46] sing kicked out so you have a very clean
[58:48] church but they'll have very shallow
[58:49] roots and then that's not the best thing
[58:51] when the storms of life come amen
[58:53] amen
[58:55] so we've got to be careful in these
[58:56] things amen other times people see a
[58:58] charisma they see a gift to speak they
[59:00] see a man that's very gifted in the word
[59:02] that knows the word and i've met many
[59:04] men in my life that are very very deep
[59:06] into the word they can quote scripture
[59:07] they can quote quotes they can tell you
[59:09] that the page they can tell you the
[59:10] paragraph number and they know the
[59:12] mysteries of god they have a deep
[59:13] understanding not just intellectually
[59:14] but by life experience amen and people
[59:17] look at them and they say you should be
[59:19] a minister and that man if he's not
[59:21] careful he'll sit there and he'll start
[59:22] to think about it and all of a sudden he
[59:24] says you know what i should be a
[59:25] minister and he gets up behind the pulp
[59:27] but in the words his brother mark likes
[59:29] to say they come over and they drop flat
[59:30] right there because he's not anointed
[59:32] doesn't mean he doesn't know the word
[59:34] amen doesn't mean he can't be a help
[59:35] using the word in the body but he is not
[59:37] a minister in it and you see it very
[59:39] quickly the words come over the pulpit
[59:40] and the people don't receive it because
[59:42] it's him it's not the lord that's
[59:43] anointed it amen
[59:45] god chooses the men for the ministry and
[59:46] he chose them before the foundation of
[59:48] the world amen when i stood up here in
[59:50] november and those three brothers
[59:52] ordained me they did not say this makes
[59:55] john a minister what they were doing was
[59:57] they were recognizing the gift and they
[59:59] were affirming that they believe it to
[1:00:01] be a gift and they were saying and we
[1:00:03] will use this now in the local body all
[1:00:05] they were doing was giving recognition
[1:00:07] to what god had already done to work in
[1:00:08] him and and that's then to show the
[1:00:10] people that there is a support not only
[1:00:12] of the pastor before the elders of the
[1:00:14] church to say that this is a gift that's
[1:00:15] been brought here by god and we need to
[1:00:17] use it and we need to heed it and let
[1:00:19] god grow it and let it be for the
[1:00:21] edification of the body amen they didn't
[1:00:23] make me a minister i was a minister
[1:00:24] before i ever stepped up here but the
[1:00:26] recognition of them now gives me
[1:00:28] authority to stand behind this pulpit
[1:00:31] and what preached to you as a man of god
[1:00:33] that's all they're doing is they're
[1:00:34] saying we're going to allow him in here
[1:00:35] we recognize what god's doing in his
[1:00:37] life and that's to our benefit and we're
[1:00:39] going to use it now in the local body
[1:00:40] amen amen
[1:00:43] but this is not just about a five-fold
[1:00:45] ministry we're talking about today i
[1:00:46] want to settle that because we're going
[1:00:47] to be talking about the five-fold
[1:00:48] ministry but there's so many things that
[1:00:50] we're ascribing to the five-fold
[1:00:52] ministry alone and it was never meant
[1:00:54] only for the five full ministry amen it
[1:00:56] was meant for every child of god the
[1:00:58] same rights the same power the same
[1:01:01] authority the same privileges of a child
[1:01:03] of god are given to each one different
[1:01:05] gifts but listen the gift of healing is
[1:01:07] not only for one man amen that the gift
[1:01:09] of casting out demons is not only for
[1:01:11] ministry that can be anyone that does it
[1:01:13] can be a mom sitting at her home it can
[1:01:15] be a dad sitting at his desk wherever it
[1:01:17] might be those things are given to the
[1:01:19] church collectively and we'll read a
[1:01:20] quote where brother brahm talks about it
[1:01:22] here he says listen he says then in each
[1:01:25] local church
[1:01:27] in each local church amen what we have
[1:01:30] needed for our day-to-day work is
[1:01:33] already here
[1:01:34] and if it's not here god will bring it
[1:01:36] here
[1:01:36] right he says then in each local church
[1:01:38] there's nine spiritual gifts that come
[1:01:41] among the people that is knowledge
[1:01:42] wisdom gifts of healing working in
[1:01:44] miracles speaking with tongues
[1:01:46] interpretation of tongues and all these
[1:01:48] things go in each local body and every
[1:01:51] person in the church has an individual
[1:01:53] ministry
[1:01:54] every person in the church your body has
[1:01:57] nothing in it that's not needed
[1:01:59] and just like that the local body has
[1:02:01] nobody here that isn't needed and if you
[1:02:03] think you're not needed then you don't
[1:02:05] understand something yet amen you need
[1:02:07] god to open your eyes and say you do
[1:02:08] have a purpose you do have a benefit you
[1:02:11] know you're young people you think well
[1:02:12] i'm just a young kid what can i do hey
[1:02:14] you can help the other young people i
[1:02:15] mean you can encourage them you can be
[1:02:17] friends with them you can bring them
[1:02:18] into the fold you can you can be a
[1:02:20] witness to the the kids in your school
[1:02:21] these different things no matter your
[1:02:23] age amen you've got a ministry if you
[1:02:25] have the holy ghost because god gave you
[1:02:27] the the holy ghost to do what be dynamic
[1:02:29] i mean not to be static but to be
[1:02:31] dynamic to be moving to doing things
[1:02:32] that he's wanting you to do amen
[1:02:35] and then often what i feel is we've we
[1:02:37] rely too much on the men behind the
[1:02:39] pulpit and what happens is they turn
[1:02:40] into a crutch for the people and the
[1:02:42] people don't develop their own faith
[1:02:43] they don't develop their own stability
[1:02:44] they don't develop their own roots what
[1:02:46] happens is they just say well i'm just
[1:02:47] going to run to the gifted man of god
[1:02:49] right and that was never what god
[1:02:50] intended amen he intended you to walk by
[1:02:52] what faith right to step out in faith to
[1:02:55] speak in faith to believe what he has
[1:02:57] said and to move according to that amen
[1:02:59] and then the men of god there will see
[1:03:00] what they're they're there to do to to
[1:03:02] kind of encourage that amen
[1:03:05] amen but we all have a common ministry
[1:03:07] and and uh i was reading some things
[1:03:09] from brother lonnie jenkins the other
[1:03:10] day and he touched on this and i thought
[1:03:12] it was worthwhile to bring to the church
[1:03:14] and this is second corinthians 5.
[1:03:17] verse 16 says wherefore henceforth now
[1:03:19] we know no man after the flesh yea
[1:03:21] though we have known christ after the
[1:03:23] flesh yet now henceforth know we him no
[1:03:25] more what he's saying is jesus christ
[1:03:27] and the body's gone he's not here for us
[1:03:29] to know to touch to feel to talk to in
[1:03:31] the same way he says therefore if any
[1:03:33] man be in christ he is a new creature
[1:03:35] old things are passed away behold all
[1:03:37] things are become new and all things are
[1:03:40] of god who had both reconciled us to
[1:03:42] himself by jesus christ and had given to
[1:03:44] us the ministry of reconciliation amen
[1:03:47] amen paul's saying the ministry that we
[1:03:49] have now is one of reconciliation
[1:03:51] brother bam talks about it like the pawn
[1:03:52] shop you're standing in the pawn shop
[1:03:54] and what happens was christ goes in and
[1:03:56] redeems you and takes you out and he
[1:03:57] says the ministry now is to bring you
[1:03:59] back to your proper position which it
[1:04:00] was in eden amen where you walked with
[1:04:02] him you had full authority eternal life
[1:04:04] and constant communion with god amen he
[1:04:06] says to wit that god was in christ
[1:04:08] reconciling the world unto himself not
[1:04:11] imputing their trespasses unto them and
[1:04:14] had committed unto us the word of
[1:04:15] reconciliation so he says christ did it
[1:04:18] and now we are coming we have the exact
[1:04:20] same word of reconciliation and that's
[1:04:21] to bring the people back to their
[1:04:23] original place he says now then we are
[1:04:26] ambassadors for christ as though god did
[1:04:28] beseech you by us we pray you in
[1:04:31] christ's dead
[1:04:33] be reconciled to god
[1:04:38] amen
[1:04:42] he says and have given us the ministry
[1:04:43] of reconciliation and then he says the
[1:04:45] word of reconciliation
[1:04:47] and that's our common call
[1:04:49] each and every one of us is looking to
[1:04:51] what get the last one in aren't we
[1:04:53] because when the last one comes in we
[1:04:54] can go amen so we're looking to get
[1:04:56] everyone brought in that can be brought
[1:04:57] in and to do that we have to reconcile
[1:04:59] them we have to show them not who they
[1:05:01] were you know what they look like when
[1:05:03] they see in the mirror those sorts of
[1:05:04] things but we have to show them their
[1:05:06] eternal amen we have to show them what
[1:05:08] they were before they ever came into a
[1:05:09] realization before they ever came into
[1:05:11] this body of flesh that they were a part
[1:05:13] of the word that god has a seed inside
[1:05:15] of them and he's looking to grow that
[1:05:16] into him amen
[1:05:18] so that's our common goal now that word
[1:05:20] reconciliation means restoration to
[1:05:23] favor
[1:05:24] restoration to favor because when we
[1:05:26] were in sin and trespasses he gave his
[1:05:28] life for us but we did not have favor
[1:05:30] with him amen it's under the shed blood
[1:05:31] that we get that favor when we get the
[1:05:33] holy ghost that's a sign that he's
[1:05:35] recognized what we've done as he asked
[1:05:37] amen and now he's given us something to
[1:05:38] take us into a rapture he's put he's put
[1:05:40] the earnest of our of our rapture inside
[1:05:43] of us and that's what an eternal part of
[1:05:44] god his very life within us
[1:05:47] so the question is are we in the
[1:05:48] ministry of reconciliation
[1:05:50] now that's a little difficult for a
[1:05:52] sister to say yes to because it happens
[1:05:54] primarily by what the preaching of the
[1:05:56] word the primary
[1:05:57] tool that god uses for these things is
[1:05:59] the preaching of the word amen faith
[1:06:01] comes by hearing and hearing comes by
[1:06:03] the word amen that word hearing means
[1:06:05] understanding it means a revelation of
[1:06:06] god's will amen that comes by hearing
[1:06:08] the word so the majority of that is done
[1:06:10] by a five-fold ministry it's not done
[1:06:12] necessarily by you and your jobs you can
[1:06:14] testify to these things but you're not
[1:06:16] ministering that so how do you get into
[1:06:18] a ministry of reconciliation well the
[1:06:20] thing is you put your shoulder to the
[1:06:21] wheel of somebody that's doing the
[1:06:22] ministry of reconciliation amen that's
[1:06:24] what you're doing here this morning is
[1:06:26] you're putting your shoulders to the
[1:06:27] wheel and you're saying i'm going to get
[1:06:29] in there and i'm going to support the
[1:06:30] man of god in the preaching of the word
[1:06:32] he's going to help build me up and i can
[1:06:33] go in and help build somebody else up as
[1:06:35] well when i go out amen i'm rejuvenated
[1:06:37] i'm strengthened i've got courage i've
[1:06:39] got boldness i've got a word and due
[1:06:40] season to give the person that next
[1:06:42] crosses my path amen but you've got to
[1:06:44] be able to support the one that's here
[1:06:46] in the first place amen that's what he
[1:06:47] said is you got to put your shoulder to
[1:06:49] the wheel behind somebody that's doing
[1:06:51] that work already amen
[1:06:54] amen if you can't do it support somebody
[1:06:56] else that is
[1:06:58] and brother paul shared a sermon on
[1:06:59] brother perry greens the other day and i
[1:07:00] was listening to that and he said you
[1:07:02] know i figure in order to criticize what
[1:07:05] someone's doing you at least need to
[1:07:06] have done more than them
[1:07:08] you know because we can get really
[1:07:10] critical
[1:07:11] can we and especially when it comes to
[1:07:13] ministry and even worse sometimes
[1:07:15] minister to minister any and i thought
[1:07:17] what he said was very good he says if
[1:07:18] you haven't done more than them don't
[1:07:20] criticize because you don't have the
[1:07:22] experience to even criticize them to see
[1:07:24] what it's like to walk the path they've
[1:07:25] walked to see the pain they go through
[1:07:27] the sacrifice they go through the
[1:07:28] criticism they have to face from
[1:07:30] unbelievers much less believers so he
[1:07:32] said don't criticize unless you've done
[1:07:33] more than the person you're criticizing
[1:07:35] i think most of us would be very very
[1:07:37] quiet the rest of our lives amen
[1:07:40] certainly about those that are ahead of
[1:07:41] us in life's path amen
[1:07:43] now i mentioned i wanted to clarify
[1:07:44] something i mentioned something in in
[1:07:46] service a while back ago where i said
[1:07:48] you know i was talking about being at
[1:07:49] your post of duty
[1:07:51] and i you know we've got people
[1:07:52] listening and streaming our services
[1:07:54] regularly and that wasn't aimed at them
[1:07:56] by any means you know they're in a place
[1:07:58] where they don't have a church they
[1:07:59] can't attend a church and so we
[1:08:01] understand those things amen but when we
[1:08:03] talk about being at your post of duty
[1:08:04] i'm talking about people that can and
[1:08:06] don't i mean that's what that's what
[1:08:08] that was for is people that have a local
[1:08:10] church that have a local pastor two
[1:08:12] pastors three pastors and they choose
[1:08:14] not to go to any one of those because
[1:08:15] something's wrong there because god
[1:08:17] can't be wrong so it means you're either
[1:08:19] not where you're supposed to be
[1:08:21] as in you're in the wrong place you're
[1:08:22] living in the wrong place because god's
[1:08:24] provided two three four pastors in the
[1:08:26] area and you say well i can't go there
[1:08:28] well then neither you're wrong or god's
[1:08:29] wrong and guess what god ain't wrong so
[1:08:31] you're either in the wrong place or you
[1:08:32] need to be in one of those churches
[1:08:33] whether you want to or not amen because
[1:08:35] god has provided for you and that means
[1:08:38] that if you're not be if you're choosing
[1:08:39] not to go there then there's an issue
[1:08:41] with you it's not with him amen
[1:08:43] listen to this
[1:08:45] this is brother brown he's talking about
[1:08:47] the queen of sheba and she's she was
[1:08:48] wondering about solomon's great gift of
[1:08:50] wisdom
[1:08:51] it said but that little queen wanted it
[1:08:52] she wanted to go there and experience it
[1:08:54] but the first thing she wanted to know
[1:08:56] was
[1:08:57] it's scriptural or not she studied all
[1:08:59] the scriptures and then she said i'm
[1:09:01] going to do another thing i'm a queen
[1:09:02] and if that message is right i'm going
[1:09:04] to support it and she laid in camels
[1:09:06] with gold and myrrh and frankincense and
[1:09:07] all kinds of costly apparel and such she
[1:09:10] said if it's right if that god is the
[1:09:12] real god then i'm going through with
[1:09:14] this thing
[1:09:15] then i'm through with this thing i've
[1:09:16] been serving and i'm going to support it
[1:09:18] with everything i've got
[1:09:20] now that it is not a man that it is not
[1:09:23] solomon's gift of wisdom that it is god
[1:09:26] in a man she's not there to support a
[1:09:28] man she's there to support man in the
[1:09:30] the god that's inside of the man amen
[1:09:32] and so what happens when we sit back and
[1:09:34] we say well i won't go to church because
[1:09:35] i don't agree with the pastor or the
[1:09:37] pastors is we sit there and we stream
[1:09:39] from somebody else and we take and we
[1:09:41] take and we take and we take and you
[1:09:43] know what happens to people that only
[1:09:44] take yeah they get selfish
[1:09:47] they get selfish and what they do is
[1:09:48] they deprive the local body of their
[1:09:50] lick of fire of their experience of
[1:09:53] their support of their fellowship and so
[1:09:55] they turn self-righteous eventually and
[1:09:57] critical to the point where almost
[1:09:59] nobody can ever minister to them because
[1:10:01] the scripture talks about his iron
[1:10:02] sharper than iron amen and that's what
[1:10:05] fellowship that's what's going to a
[1:10:06] local body is going to do is it's going
[1:10:07] to sharpen you up because people will
[1:10:09] hold you accountable to the word you
[1:10:10] don't get to sit in your house all
[1:10:12] comfortable listening to services day
[1:10:14] after day after day amen what'll happen
[1:10:16] is even the one you're listening to will
[1:10:17] eventually become no good to you amen
[1:10:19] you've got to be a part of a local body
[1:10:21] amen if it's at all possible amen
[1:10:24] critical and self-righteous is the end
[1:10:25] of people that sit at home and don't
[1:10:27] support anybody amen it's not the place
[1:10:29] we want to be
[1:10:31] brother brahm continues he says that's
[1:10:33] the attitude listen god's not concerned
[1:10:35] so much about your money but he wants
[1:10:38] you to support him with all you are amen
[1:10:42] amen he don't want 10 of your money that
[1:10:45] doesn't mean stop paying ties
[1:10:47] amen but he says that's not his goal is
[1:10:50] to get you to pay ties
[1:10:52] he gets you to pay tie so he can bless
[1:10:53] you
[1:10:54] that's why he gives you a tithe he gives
[1:10:56] you an option for thai so that he can
[1:10:57] bless you it's not to bless him it's to
[1:10:59] bless you
[1:11:00] amen so much as he wants your time your
[1:11:03] talent your testimony and all that you
[1:11:06] are to be given into his hands so he can
[1:11:08] control you he wants to be your lord not
[1:11:11] only your savior but your lord lordship
[1:11:14] to govern you
[1:11:15] amen not just your money but he wants
[1:11:17] the rest of you as well amen god wants
[1:11:19] the whole package
[1:11:20] right
[1:11:21] and it's for your good and it's for the
[1:11:23] good of the brother and sister sitting
[1:11:24] next to you and those pews amen
[1:11:26] listen to this we need anointed ministry
[1:11:28] amen every church needs it and i feel
[1:11:30] for those that haven't found it yet or
[1:11:32] are struggling to find it amen it's
[1:11:34] god's grace if they can find it but
[1:11:35] listen god has a way to provide and this
[1:11:37] is luke 10 2. i mean there's not
[1:11:40] you know you start talking about you
[1:11:42] know ministers inside of canada and
[1:11:45] bringing somebody in or something like
[1:11:46] that there's not many available you know
[1:11:48] we we have a dearth of ministers so to
[1:11:50] speak there's not a ton of them out
[1:11:51] there and jesus said it was going to be
[1:11:53] this way in luke 10 2. he says therefore
[1:11:55] said he unto them the harvest truly is
[1:11:57] great but the laborers are few
[1:12:00] amen he said he said he'd send what his
[1:12:01] angels to harvest what are angels
[1:12:04] messengers ministry
[1:12:06] he says pray ye therefore the lord of
[1:12:08] the harvest that he would send forth
[1:12:10] laborers into his harvest amen we're at
[1:12:13] our harvest time this is the end of all
[1:12:15] things amen and so we need those
[1:12:17] laborers we need the ministry to be
[1:12:18] going through and what harvesting the
[1:12:20] people as they come to maturity amen
[1:12:23] bringing them up to that maturity so
[1:12:24] that when the rapture comes they're
[1:12:25] ready to go amen but those that are
[1:12:28] watching online that don't have a pastor
[1:12:30] let me say it to you this way he has
[1:12:32] told you how to get a pastor he's told
[1:12:34] you how to get a ministry and he says
[1:12:36] pray ye
[1:12:37] pray ye
[1:12:39] right who's ye that's the laity that's
[1:12:41] the congregation that needs a minister
[1:12:43] to come in he says pray ye to who the
[1:12:45] lord of the harvest the one that ordains
[1:12:47] these men the one that prepares him
[1:12:49] specifically for a chosen body
[1:12:52] right he says pray to him and then
[1:12:54] expect it because there's a need there
[1:12:56] for it if you've got a harvest that
[1:12:57] needs to be taken pray that he's going
[1:12:59] to send somebody in to handle it amen
[1:13:02] there is a lord of the harvest and
[1:13:03] there's somebody ready but you got to
[1:13:05] pray and you got to pray and you got to
[1:13:07] pray and you got to pray and in the
[1:13:08] meantime don't walk away stay and pray
[1:13:10] stay and pray stay and pray until what a
[1:13:13] laborer comes to help you with the
[1:13:14] harvest amen i love how the word gives
[1:13:16] us he shows us the need and he shows us
[1:13:18] how to get it how to get an answer right
[1:13:20] he didn't say oh there's going to be
[1:13:21] there's not going to be enough ministers
[1:13:22] and some people aren't going to make a
[1:13:24] rapture no he says pray
[1:13:25] pray pray pray pray pray pray and then
[1:13:28] somebody will come in amen he's not
[1:13:30] going to leave you without somebody to
[1:13:32] help you through this amen he's prepared
[1:13:34] somebody but he's looking for you to do
[1:13:35] something and that's pray to the lord of
[1:13:37] the harvest amen
[1:13:39] amen let's continue with this idea that
[1:13:41] christ is the head of the church amen
[1:13:44] ephesians 4 7 says but unto every one of
[1:13:46] us is given grace according to the
[1:13:48] measure of the gift of christ wherefore
[1:13:51] he saith when he ascended up on high he
[1:13:53] led captivity captive and gave gifts
[1:13:55] unto men amen we have different measures
[1:13:57] of grace and that's in proportion to the
[1:13:59] gift of christ himself christ was the
[1:14:01] great gift amen he was the great gift
[1:14:04] that was that was god himself
[1:14:05] sacrificing everything that he could for
[1:14:07] us and then as we read he poured all of
[1:14:09] that into the church so he separates
[1:14:11] christ separates himself into all the
[1:14:13] little portions that are the individuals
[1:14:15] in you know ellie has a portion and josh
[1:14:17] has one and kingsley has one sister
[1:14:19] maureen brother mark and everyone in
[1:14:20] here when he gives you the holy ghost he
[1:14:22] gives you a portion of god and he's
[1:14:24] ordained you to do that to do something
[1:14:26] for him from before the foundation of
[1:14:28] the world amen
[1:14:30] but paul's saying look it's grace to you
[1:14:33] that he gave it to you in the first
[1:14:34] place amen so whatever you have that is
[1:14:37] godly that is spiritual that is of
[1:14:39] eternal value is god's grace to you amen
[1:14:42] amen and then he says after that he gave
[1:14:45] gifts to men
[1:14:46] so there's a different proportion based
[1:14:49] of grace based on the proportion of god
[1:14:51] that you have and some of us have more
[1:14:53] of god to express amen we talked about
[1:14:56] that before some of us have a more
[1:14:58] difficult life some of us face
[1:15:00] family issues we face health issues we
[1:15:02] face financial issues we face mental
[1:15:04] issues all marital issues whatever it
[1:15:06] might be we face these things and it's
[1:15:08] the grace of god that rises up within us
[1:15:10] that gives us what we have need of to
[1:15:12] meet the challenge for our particular
[1:15:14] life amen but he's also talking about
[1:15:16] look there are different levels of gifts
[1:15:19] so let me put it this way we've got
[1:15:20] brother gerald here and we've got me so
[1:15:22] brother gerald can preach better than me
[1:15:24] and it's more grace to him
[1:15:27] that he can do that because it's more
[1:15:29] grace required to operate something of
[1:15:32] god in a way that is effective to people
[1:15:34] because for it to be effective god has
[1:15:37] to get less of you into the picture and
[1:15:39] more of him into the picture and that
[1:15:41] takes grace because there's nothing in
[1:15:43] us that's human that would want to
[1:15:45] minimize ourselves when something
[1:15:46] supernatural is coming over the pulpit
[1:15:48] amen so it is more grace to him to
[1:15:51] operate that way so that more of god can
[1:15:53] come out like we said before the grace
[1:15:55] is there to minimize man and maximize
[1:15:58] god in that gift amen and the greater
[1:16:00] the gift that means there's more of god
[1:16:02] and less of you and it's grace grace
[1:16:04] grace from start to finish to do those
[1:16:05] sort of things amen brother branham said
[1:16:08] my gift is to get myself out of the way
[1:16:11] that was grace so that brother adam
[1:16:13] would get to the point where he didn't
[1:16:15] even know the words that he was speaking
[1:16:17] nor could he can remember them after he
[1:16:19] spoke them because god was so completely
[1:16:21] using his body his mind his lips that he
[1:16:24] was he was effectively unconscious in
[1:16:26] that moment he'd say
[1:16:28] was it right what he said
[1:16:30] was it right he didn't even know he
[1:16:32] wasn't even aware of it that's how
[1:16:34] separated he was from his faculties when
[1:16:36] god used him amen that's a gift
[1:16:40] and that's grace that's to him to so
[1:16:42] separate himself that way so that god
[1:16:44] could use him in that way amen
[1:16:47] listen amen that's what you want an
[1:16:49] anointed minister
[1:16:51] get a man that can pull himself back
[1:16:53] amen that it isn't about him and then
[1:16:55] it's not about building himself up it's
[1:16:57] not putting on a show like brother bram
[1:16:58] says i'm not here to make something big
[1:17:00] about myself but to completely pull
[1:17:02] myself out of the way so that god can
[1:17:04] come through in a way that he's never
[1:17:05] come through before amen god help us
[1:17:07] god help us listen
[1:17:09] let's take paul's words for don't take
[1:17:10] my word for it let's go back to the
[1:17:12] scripture paul says this first
[1:17:13] corinthians 15 10 he says but by the
[1:17:16] grace of god i am what i am
[1:17:18] amen amen he is the prophet to the age
[1:17:21] he's the prophet to the gentiles he is
[1:17:23] the word carrier for that age nobody
[1:17:26] gets to correct paul
[1:17:28] right the holy spirit gave paul
[1:17:30] everything that we have in the new
[1:17:32] testament effectively right peter has to
[1:17:35] run it by paul you could put it that way
[1:17:36] right peter had to get corrected by paul
[1:17:38] peter who has the keys to the kingdom
[1:17:40] still had to be corrected by paul that's
[1:17:42] that's how tight got that paul is with
[1:17:44] god okay and he says but by the grace of
[1:17:48] god i am what i am
[1:17:50] and his grace which was bestowed upon me
[1:17:52] was not in vain
[1:17:54] but i labored more abundantly than they
[1:17:57] all he says then all the apostles then
[1:17:59] all of the believers then all of the
[1:18:00] disciples he says i worked harder than
[1:18:02] all of them you say that doesn't sound
[1:18:04] very meek
[1:18:06] listen to the next one he says yet not i
[1:18:09] but the grace of god which was with me
[1:18:11] paul says look i did more than any of
[1:18:13] you nobody can touch me
[1:18:16] and we think arrogance
[1:18:18] arrogance i did more than anybody
[1:18:21] i spoke in more tongues
[1:18:23] i did more signs and wonders
[1:18:25] i have an angel that follows me around
[1:18:28] nobody can touch my ministry and he says
[1:18:30] i've worked harder than any one of you
[1:18:33] i've been more diligent i've put more
[1:18:34] time in i've been i've been whipped more
[1:18:37] times than any of you
[1:18:39] right i've sacrificed more nobody can
[1:18:41] touch my ministry
[1:18:43] and then he says what
[1:18:45] not i but the grace of god which is in
[1:18:47] me you think he's talking about himself
[1:18:49] there you know that we have something to
[1:18:51] do well i'm more diligent i spend more
[1:18:53] time in the message i spend more time
[1:18:55] studying paul says whatever you've done
[1:18:58] he says it is all by grace
[1:19:01] amen so you say oh well this brother is
[1:19:03] very disciplined that's why he is where
[1:19:05] he is no it's the grace of god to him
[1:19:07] amen this brother has a gift of this and
[1:19:09] that it's because he fasts and he prays
[1:19:11] it no no no paul says it is all grace he
[1:19:13] says the grace of god which was what
[1:19:16] with me it's grace from start to finish
[1:19:19] amen so if you think you're something
[1:19:21] big
[1:19:22] think again because it's grace that
[1:19:24] started it's grace is going to finish it
[1:19:26] and you can't do a thing about it amen
[1:19:28] you can't add to it and you can't take
[1:19:30] away from it amen amen if you think that
[1:19:32] you've got anything of eternal value in
[1:19:34] this flesh in and of yourself you've got
[1:19:35] a real you need to rethink it amen there
[1:19:38] is nothing we can add to this but it is
[1:19:39] what god has done and it is what is god
[1:19:42] will do
[1:19:43] it's all by grace it's all by grace from
[1:19:44] start to finish amen
[1:19:46] he continues in first corinthians three
[1:19:48] he says now he that planteth and he that
[1:19:51] watereth are one so he's talking about
[1:19:53] the gifts because who goes in first it's
[1:19:54] always a missionary isn't it in those
[1:19:56] days it would be a missionary would go
[1:19:57] in first an apostle would go in and they
[1:19:59] would do what they'd preach they'd go in
[1:20:01] the marketplace they'd get beat up
[1:20:02] thrown in jail whatever it was but
[1:20:04] eventually a church would start there
[1:20:06] and they would plant and they says he
[1:20:08] that water so then you get the
[1:20:09] evangelists come in and the teachers and
[1:20:11] eventually they get a pastor there he
[1:20:12] says they're watering the work that the
[1:20:14] first one started he says they are one
[1:20:16] that what that means is that they are
[1:20:18] equal
[1:20:19] they are equal there is no great ones
[1:20:21] amongst us amen when it comes to the
[1:20:23] ministry he says the one that plants the
[1:20:24] one that waters doesn't matter they're
[1:20:26] all equal in terms of god amen he says
[1:20:30] and every man shall receive his own
[1:20:32] reward according to his own labor
[1:20:35] and then so we answer to god for what we
[1:20:37] do and what we don't do and how we do it
[1:20:40] now he says for we are laborers together
[1:20:43] with god so he's talking about the five
[1:20:44] full ministry we are laborers together
[1:20:46] with god so god is working with us to do
[1:20:48] the work
[1:20:50] but he says ye
[1:20:52] are god's husbandry
[1:20:54] ye
[1:20:55] are god's building amen so we are doing
[1:20:58] the work with god but we don't get to
[1:21:00] claim you amen so brother gerald
[1:21:03] serving here for 40 years does not get
[1:21:06] to say this is mine
[1:21:08] that's what paul's saying he's saying ye
[1:21:10] are god's husbandry that husbandry it
[1:21:12] means i've got a mark down here
[1:21:14] somewhere
[1:21:15] what is it what do you say yes he says
[1:21:17] god's husbandry is his garden his field
[1:21:20] his cultivation so this is all god's and
[1:21:23] all you have is brother gerald that is
[1:21:25] working with god to do what to grow it
[1:21:28] but your gods amen the pastor doesn't
[1:21:30] own the people you can leave this church
[1:21:32] and go to another church
[1:21:34] and that's not that shouldn't be a
[1:21:35] problem to the pastor because you're
[1:21:36] god's building you're god's husbandry
[1:21:38] you're his working you're his people and
[1:21:41] all you have is a five full ministry
[1:21:42] that's there to do what to help it
[1:21:44] to move as god will move him to move to
[1:21:46] help that thing to be successful to be
[1:21:48] to be a healthy church amen
[1:21:51] verse 10 says according to the grace of
[1:21:53] god which is given to me as a wise
[1:21:56] master builder so paul says i'm the
[1:21:58] master builder i'm setting the
[1:21:59] foundation for all of the ages amen this
[1:22:01] is paul's foundation here
[1:22:03] perfect light to start and he says i'm
[1:22:06] setting a foundation and it's god's
[1:22:07] grace to me to be a master builder
[1:22:10] i have laid the foundation and another
[1:22:13] builds thereon
[1:22:15] what happens sometimes we get real
[1:22:16] sticky about oh well i started it and
[1:22:18] now somebody else taken the credit for
[1:22:19] it paul says look i i started it and
[1:22:22] everyone's going to build on it that's
[1:22:23] okay
[1:22:24] that's the purpose he's supposed to as a
[1:22:26] prophet the age he's there to set that
[1:22:28] foundation so that what comes afterwards
[1:22:30] is going to stand the test of time
[1:22:32] he says but let every man take heed how
[1:22:34] he built it thereon for other foundation
[1:22:37] can no man lay than that which is laid
[1:22:39] which is jesus christ he laid a
[1:22:41] foundation of jesus christ amen
[1:22:43] amen he preached christ amen and in the
[1:22:46] resurrection the power and these things
[1:22:48] he said i didn't come to you with fine
[1:22:49] words swelling words he said by came in
[1:22:51] power and demonstration of the spirit to
[1:22:53] show you what jesus christ the same
[1:22:54] yesterday today and forever because he
[1:22:56] knew that if he didn't do that then they
[1:22:58] build it up on him
[1:23:00] and then they build it up on his gifts
[1:23:01] they build it up on his ideas and it
[1:23:03] will crumble and fall but he says no
[1:23:05] build it on christ amen and he says make
[1:23:07] sure anything you build on is built on
[1:23:09] christ amen amen that's what brother
[1:23:12] branham could say he says i've only
[1:23:14] preached what paul preached amen because
[1:23:16] what he preached was what jesus christ
[1:23:18] was saying yesterday today forever he
[1:23:19] took it back to paul he didn't create
[1:23:21] new doctrine he took it back to what
[1:23:22] paul brought to us because that was what
[1:23:24] the holy spirit brought to the gentile
[1:23:26] church amen
[1:23:28] amen
[1:23:29] what happened the ones that didn't build
[1:23:31] on christ what happened yeah right
[1:23:33] within 60 odd years they were what
[1:23:35] denominationalized right
[1:23:37] you had the start of nickelodeon-ism and
[1:23:39] all of a sudden you had a bunch of men's
[1:23:40] ideas to got to the point where they
[1:23:42] wouldn't even allow john to come and
[1:23:44] preach in their church
[1:23:45] i mean you got a you got a man that that
[1:23:47] that that was close to christ that has
[1:23:49] the visions of the of the ending of the
[1:23:52] world
[1:23:53] and they won't allow him to come preach
[1:23:54] in their church that's where it got to
[1:23:56] was because what men got in and they set
[1:23:58] up their own programs their own
[1:23:59] platforms and they built something that
[1:24:01] wasn't on christ and it all has crumbled
[1:24:02] and fallen and then you've got a
[1:24:03] denominational world today
[1:24:07] amen amen so to who is to who were these
[1:24:09] gifts given it says wherefore he saith
[1:24:11] when he ascended up on high he led
[1:24:13] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[1:24:16] men
[1:24:16] and he gave some
[1:24:19] not everyone he gave some apostles
[1:24:23] he gave some prophets and some
[1:24:26] evangelists and some pastors and
[1:24:29] teachers
[1:24:30] we don't have all five of those here
[1:24:32] today do we
[1:24:33] we've got two we've got a pastor and
[1:24:35] we've got an evangelist right now
[1:24:36] right but we have access to those others
[1:24:39] don't we
[1:24:40] we can fly them in
[1:24:42] we could stream them if we chose to do
[1:24:43] something like that but they are
[1:24:44] available to us but he says look i give
[1:24:47] some this
[1:24:48] so there's a couple of things here
[1:24:50] there's two ways to look at this because
[1:24:51] he gave
[1:24:52] thought he gave men five different gifts
[1:24:54] amen so you can be an apostle you can be
[1:24:56] a prophet you could be an evangelist a
[1:24:58] pastor or a teacher and those are gifts
[1:25:00] that he gave to men he gave to fivefold
[1:25:02] ministers amen so he gave something down
[1:25:05] to them distinct gifts that were for use
[1:25:08] in the body
[1:25:09] but the other side of this is that they
[1:25:11] weren't just given to the men but the
[1:25:13] men themselves are now a gift to the
[1:25:15] body of christ amen because he gave some
[1:25:18] apostles he gives some of us an apostle
[1:25:20] to bring us in he gives some of us a
[1:25:22] prophet amen the people that started you
[1:25:24] know the early church they were
[1:25:25] listening to brother mark in these ones
[1:25:27] they're listening to what a prophet
[1:25:29] right they're reading a prophet and that
[1:25:31] was their access to god at that point
[1:25:33] and then they come in and they sit in
[1:25:34] under a pastor and the church gets
[1:25:35] started in these different things but
[1:25:37] the starting point was one person or
[1:25:38] another and guess what not everybody can
[1:25:40] take an apostle some people need a
[1:25:42] teacher some people need a pastor
[1:25:44] because they've got life problems that
[1:25:45] he needs to address and they see god in
[1:25:47] that then they get an evangelist that
[1:25:49] comes in and he just he just sparks
[1:25:51] their conscience and they're like whoa i
[1:25:52] really need to make a change and they
[1:25:53] realize they're not where they they
[1:25:55] should be and they give their life to
[1:25:56] christ and so we all if we looked at our
[1:25:58] testimonies some of us came in under
[1:26:00] evangelism some of us came in under
[1:26:01] pastoral work some of us came in under
[1:26:03] listening to tapes
[1:26:05] right whatever it might be each one of
[1:26:07] us was given a gift of a man in the form
[1:26:09] of a ministry to bring us in and then
[1:26:11] once we're in then he gives us a gift of
[1:26:13] a man or man to keep us feeding and
[1:26:15] growing and then so we have a gift given
[1:26:17] to men and then those men themselves are
[1:26:19] gifts to the bride of christ to grow
[1:26:21] them amen
[1:26:22] and that's why i call this gracious
[1:26:23] gifts is because paul says every one of
[1:26:26] us what we have is grace to us
[1:26:28] and then if you can accept what we have
[1:26:30] it's grace to you as well amen
[1:26:33] it's grace to those men that they can
[1:26:34] even operate under those gifts and not
[1:26:36] get swelled heads
[1:26:38] and then because you will see things
[1:26:39] that happen in those services and i can
[1:26:41] even say for myself not knowing what
[1:26:43] happens in a service not knowing
[1:26:44] situations somebody comes and says you
[1:26:46] went right into my life you went right
[1:26:48] into a situation i don't know i know you
[1:26:50] don't know anything about now i could
[1:26:52] sit back and say oh yeah that's amazing
[1:26:54] wow i'm great no i don't have a clue i
[1:26:56] didn't have a clue so why would i get
[1:26:58] swelled up about it but what happens is
[1:27:00] if you start listening to those things
[1:27:01] and dwelling on it you'll get a swelled
[1:27:03] head because you'll think well i got in
[1:27:05] the spirit right i put the time out no
[1:27:07] no it's grace brothers and sisters it is
[1:27:09] grace from start to finish amen and god
[1:27:11] help us if we ever start to look to
[1:27:13] ourselves instead of the one that
[1:27:14] anointed us in the first place amen
[1:27:16] amen i'm trying to get our heads in the
[1:27:18] right place when it comes to ministry
[1:27:19] not because we're not in the right place
[1:27:21] but we want to keep a level ahead with
[1:27:22] these things because when gifts come in
[1:27:24] amen when god starts moving we tend to
[1:27:26] turn to the men rather than the god that
[1:27:28] sent them in and that's always the
[1:27:30] problem with the church amen
[1:27:32] so what why do they come
[1:27:34] verse 12 says for the perfecting of the
[1:27:36] saints for the work of the ministry and
[1:27:38] for the edified of the body of christ
[1:27:41] amen let's start with that perfecting of
[1:27:42] the saints i mentioned this before i'll
[1:27:44] say it again because not everyone was
[1:27:45] here i was listening to brother jason
[1:27:47] demar speak on this and he said be
[1:27:49] careful here because when we see this
[1:27:50] word perfecting we think it's about
[1:27:52] maturing
[1:27:54] he says this is not the same word you
[1:27:56] know jesus said be therefore perfect as
[1:27:57] i am perfect this ain't the same
[1:27:59] perfection
[1:28:00] because there jesus was saying be mature
[1:28:02] as i am mature but here this perfecting
[1:28:04] means different and it means a complete
[1:28:07] furnishing or equipping so in other
[1:28:09] words the faithful ministry is here to
[1:28:10] give you
[1:28:12] what you need to become mature they're
[1:28:14] not here to make you mature they're here
[1:28:16] to give you what you need to become
[1:28:17] mature because it's god that's going to
[1:28:19] do the work we're just here to support
[1:28:21] it amen so we're just feeding you we're
[1:28:23] giving you the nutrients we're giving
[1:28:25] you the tools we're giving you the
[1:28:26] inspired preaching of the word to help
[1:28:28] you to step into what you're supposed to
[1:28:30] be doing amen so it's for you to take it
[1:28:33] now in the holy spirit and you quickens
[1:28:34] it and that gives you life i can't give
[1:28:36] you life brother joe can't give you life
[1:28:38] speaking over the pulpit all we can do
[1:28:40] is preach under the inspiration and that
[1:28:41] holy spirit and you will quicken it and
[1:28:43] make it what it needs to be inside of
[1:28:45] your life amen so what are we here to
[1:28:47] provide we're here to provide you with
[1:28:49] with inspired preaching that meets the
[1:28:51] need in your life on a regular basis
[1:28:53] amen if your pastor if the preacher
[1:28:55] behind the pulpit is not meeting the
[1:28:57] needs of your
[1:28:58] life something's wrong
[1:29:00] because that's what he's promised to do
[1:29:02] we're here for the perfecting of the
[1:29:04] saints we're here for the equipping of
[1:29:05] the saints so if the ministry is not
[1:29:07] equipping you we've got a problem and
[1:29:09] it's either in the pulpit or it's either
[1:29:10] or it's in the pew or maybe it's both
[1:29:13] amen but that's why we've got to be
[1:29:15] praying for each other amen like i said
[1:29:17] but at the start of the service you come
[1:29:18] in and you get what you expect amen so
[1:29:20] if we come in expecting nothing guess
[1:29:22] what you get nothing so sometimes it's
[1:29:24] an expectation issue sometimes it's an
[1:29:26] anointing issue i've talked about i've
[1:29:28] been in churches i shared with some
[1:29:29] brothers what happened back in texas
[1:29:31] where they put a man in that should not
[1:29:32] have been in that pulpit a year and a
[1:29:34] half later he was gone and out in the
[1:29:35] world they shouldn't have done it and
[1:29:37] guess what that church was not blessed
[1:29:38] while he was there in fact it did more
[1:29:40] damage than if they just left him out
[1:29:41] and streamed somebody else why he wasn't
[1:29:43] supposed to be there amen so there can
[1:29:46] be an issue there amen but like i said
[1:29:48] it's here to do what to meet the need in
[1:29:50] your life on a regular basis now that is
[1:29:52] not saying that it's going to be
[1:29:54] intellectually stimulating i mean that's
[1:29:56] going to cause you to think i mean
[1:29:58] that's that's tickling your ears
[1:30:00] preaching so often we say oh whoa that
[1:30:02] really stuck no no no it's the holy
[1:30:04] spirit we want moving not just a wow i
[1:30:06] got to think about that for a little
[1:30:08] while a little while that's not what
[1:30:09] we're looking for that's good we want
[1:30:11] you to think we want you to meditate on
[1:30:12] these things but so often what you'll
[1:30:14] see especially in denominations is
[1:30:16] you'll see a preacher that gets up and
[1:30:18] he preaches something that just makes
[1:30:19] you feel good amen that that just
[1:30:22] reaffirms something to you rather than
[1:30:24] challenges you and you walk out and he
[1:30:26] hasn't really put a finger on your life
[1:30:28] at all he's just said something that
[1:30:29] kind of makes you go away and say hmm
[1:30:31] that was pretty good no that's not we're
[1:30:33] not looking for pretty good we're
[1:30:34] looking for the holy spirit to come in
[1:30:36] and put his finger right on your life on
[1:30:37] a regular basis and not only your life
[1:30:39] but my life even the man while he's
[1:30:41] preaching the holy spirit isn't just
[1:30:42] preaching from here to there he's
[1:30:44] preaching in the entire congregation
[1:30:46] amen my wife has said many times how are
[1:30:48] you able to say that i said well he was
[1:30:50] preaching to me too
[1:30:51] right
[1:30:52] because she'd say you're talking about
[1:30:53] something that you deal with in your own
[1:30:54] life i said right exactly
[1:30:56] i still got to say it because it's the
[1:30:58] word but that doesn't mean that i don't
[1:30:59] get to i don't have to sit there and
[1:31:01] consider my own life even while these
[1:31:03] words are going forth amen it's a real
[1:31:04] challenge sometimes to say the things i
[1:31:06] do because i know that i need it as much
[1:31:08] as the people in the in the congregation
[1:31:10] doing man
[1:31:12] amen provide you with inspired preaching
[1:31:14] second challenge and inspire your faith
[1:31:16] by showing you your place and your
[1:31:18] promises in the word of god amen we're
[1:31:20] looking to reconcile you we're looking
[1:31:22] to return you back to your position of
[1:31:24] favor with god and so we've got to show
[1:31:26] you what's available we've got to show
[1:31:27] you what he said about you amen what he
[1:31:29] promised for you and hopefully get you
[1:31:32] to do what step out in faith amen not my
[1:31:35] faith but your faith that your faith
[1:31:36] will be lifted up to the place where you
[1:31:38] can rest on what god has called you to
[1:31:40] do amen
[1:31:41] i want to read this quote i read the
[1:31:42] first part a few services ago but the
[1:31:44] second part is what i really wanted to
[1:31:46] get to
[1:31:47] so he says here and the word of god will
[1:31:49] defeat satan any place any time anywhere
[1:31:52] and on any condition that's right that's
[1:31:54] what it is it's god's word heavens and
[1:31:56] earth will pass away but my word shall
[1:31:58] never fail away he says believe it
[1:32:00] so we're here and we're preaching the
[1:32:01] word and brother brahm says the word
[1:32:03] will defeat him anyplace anywhere
[1:32:04] anytime on any condition but then he
[1:32:06] says gifts are added to stimulate faith
[1:32:11] so the preaching of the word is coming
[1:32:12] forth and then he says there are gifts
[1:32:14] added to that to stimulate the faith of
[1:32:17] the hearer
[1:32:18] he says faith cometh by hearing and
[1:32:20] hearing by the word that's where faith
[1:32:22] comes by hearing the word of salvation
[1:32:24] so the in ministry and the five full
[1:32:26] ministry are given gifts to stimulate
[1:32:29] your faith as you're hearing the word
[1:32:32] and so you have some brothers have a
[1:32:34] gift of what healing
[1:32:36] right and so when they're preaching
[1:32:37] they're building up faith they're
[1:32:38] stimulating the faith that you already
[1:32:40] have that you don't know about right
[1:32:43] they're stimulating it to the point
[1:32:45] where you can say
[1:32:46] not just i can be healed but i am healed
[1:32:50] amen to where you have a need for
[1:32:52] deliverance and all of a sudden you're
[1:32:53] sitting there uh somebody was talking
[1:32:55] about brother allen stuckless the other
[1:32:57] day and he was sitting in service and it
[1:32:58] and his chest was hurting and brother
[1:33:00] gerald was preaching and all of a sudden
[1:33:02] it came to him just claimed your healing
[1:33:03] and he claimed his healing and he never
[1:33:05] had a heart problem after that what is
[1:33:07] it it's there to stimulate something
[1:33:09] inside of you that god placed there to
[1:33:12] what answer to the word and bring you up
[1:33:14] into a higher plane amen a higher plane
[1:33:17] of health a higher place of your mental
[1:33:19] thinking a higher place in your marriage
[1:33:21] a higher place whatever the need might
[1:33:23] be it's there to stimulate your faith
[1:33:26] not to get you to think i'm a great man
[1:33:28] not to get you to think that brother
[1:33:29] gerald's a great man or ron spencer or
[1:33:31] timber no no it's there to stimulate
[1:33:33] their faith your faith it's there for
[1:33:34] you for your benefit to draw you to a
[1:33:37] higher place amen
[1:33:39] and then it's there to cause you to
[1:33:40] rejuvenate to grow your faith to step up
[1:33:43] to a higher level amen they're not there
[1:33:45] for you to lean on day in and day out
[1:33:47] they're there to get you to stop leaning
[1:33:50] amen to stop leaning so that you can
[1:33:53] start speaking so that you can start
[1:33:55] believing so you can start walking and
[1:33:57] you don't have to come to church for god
[1:33:59] to move in your life
[1:34:00] why because he stimulated your faith and
[1:34:02] now you've got to walk that you can
[1:34:04] continue now the next time you come in
[1:34:06] he'll try and raise it a little bit
[1:34:07] higher and the next time a little bit
[1:34:09] higher and all of a sudden we're all
[1:34:10] growing together and all we're here is
[1:34:12] stimulating what you already have going
[1:34:14] on in your life on a day-to-day basis
[1:34:16] based on what your personal relationship
[1:34:18] with god your devotions your prayer time
[1:34:21] your listening to tapes your listening
[1:34:22] service whatever it might be he's there
[1:34:24] to just stimulate what is already in you
[1:34:26] amen
[1:34:27] amen you have the eternal god inside of
[1:34:29] you there's no limit to what he can do
[1:34:31] if you will believe
[1:34:34] and all we're trying to do is get you to
[1:34:35] believe amen
[1:34:37] brother brown says this he says you hear
[1:34:39] such things today there's a great healer
[1:34:41] coming to town and he there will all go
[1:34:44] over and get healed
[1:34:46] if i was gonna say brother branham's
[1:34:48] coming to to our service on wednesday
[1:34:51] does anybody in here think that they
[1:34:53] would walk out without what they were
[1:34:54] dealing with taken care of
[1:34:57] no
[1:34:58] right why because we've seen it
[1:35:00] we know that brother branham had a gift
[1:35:03] of healing he also had a gift to inspire
[1:35:06] faith so my personal opinion is if we
[1:35:08] knew brother branham was coming into our
[1:35:10] next service we'd be pulling in everyone
[1:35:13] that we know of that had a need
[1:35:15] and we'd be coming in with a laundry
[1:35:17] list
[1:35:18] of things that we wanted god to take
[1:35:19] care of
[1:35:20] because brother branham's coming to town
[1:35:24] isn't that true
[1:35:25] that's what we'd say brother brahm says
[1:35:27] now when you think that you all know it
[1:35:29] i saw you
[1:35:30] he says now when you think that way
[1:35:32] you've certainly got your camera out of
[1:35:34] focus
[1:35:36] yes sir focus it down to jesus and him
[1:35:39] only look to him and you'll see what
[1:35:42] god's purpose is because brother brahm
[1:35:44] says i am not the healer he says i heal
[1:35:46] you if i could but i can't i've got to
[1:35:48] wait for him to tell me amen i've got to
[1:35:51] pray the prayer of faith but he's the
[1:35:53] one that's got to do the healing what is
[1:35:54] it the man of god is coming into the
[1:35:57] service to remind you that you're a man
[1:35:59] of god that you're a child of god that
[1:36:01] you're a daughter of god that you're a
[1:36:03] woman of god he's trying to remind you
[1:36:04] of your position and your place and get
[1:36:07] you to look to your father not to him
[1:36:10] amen he's there to stimulate your faith
[1:36:12] not to take the place of it not to take
[1:36:14] the place of the god that brought him
[1:36:15] there in the first place and gave him
[1:36:17] that gift amen he's trying to show you
[1:36:19] that man's trying to come in and show
[1:36:20] you that you have rights you have
[1:36:22] privileges the same as he has and you
[1:36:25] don't need him and so the thing is the
[1:36:27] next time something comes up you don't
[1:36:29] have to go to brother branham you don't
[1:36:30] have to go to brother gerald you don't
[1:36:32] have to go to brother jonathan you don't
[1:36:34] have to go to brother iran but you go to
[1:36:36] the god that sent them in the first
[1:36:37] place and say i'm coming to you because
[1:36:39] he said i am your child amen that you
[1:36:42] have given me the holy ghost and what i
[1:36:44] have need of i go to you for it i don't
[1:36:46] have to wait for a man amen i've been
[1:36:48] seeing my place i know who i am and i'm
[1:36:51] coming to my jehovah rapha amen i'm
[1:36:53] coming to my jehovah's shama my jehovah
[1:36:56] nisi amen you are the one i'm coming to
[1:36:58] he says get your eyes off the man look
[1:37:00] to the god behind the man that's what
[1:37:02] they missed with brother branham they
[1:37:03] said they don't see the angel behind the
[1:37:05] angel i mean they don't see the one
[1:37:07] standing behind me they kept looking at
[1:37:09] him and when he walked away what
[1:37:10] happened all the miracles faded because
[1:37:12] what they were looking to the man
[1:37:14] amen but jesus didn't leave
[1:37:16] amen he's still here the holy spirit's
[1:37:19] still here amen only believe if thou
[1:37:21] canst believe all things are possible
[1:37:23] amen
[1:37:25] amen we don't want to look to man a guy
[1:37:26] says you've got your focus wrong he says
[1:37:28] focus it down to jesus guess what you
[1:37:30] can be in the middle of your day and
[1:37:32] have a need what are you going to do
[1:37:33] you're going to call brother gerald
[1:37:35] you're driving down the road you're
[1:37:36] going to call brother gerald what do you
[1:37:37] say jesus help me
[1:37:40] that's it
[1:37:41] he hears you every time he's available
[1:37:43] 24 7. hey man he doesn't shut his phone
[1:37:46] off like i do at 10 p.m
[1:37:48] right
[1:37:49] look to jesus amen the author and
[1:37:51] finisher of your faith amen
[1:37:54] amen hallelujah
[1:37:54] [Applause]
[1:37:57] good word amen the third thing we do is
[1:37:58] we bring correction by the word of god
[1:38:01] to get you to keep you from getting
[1:38:03] caught up in satan's tricks
[1:38:04] what is satan's trick
[1:38:06] to get you into formalism
[1:38:08] he's trying to get you into a place
[1:38:10] where you do the same thing day in and
[1:38:12] day out and you don't grow
[1:38:14] saints tricks are not black and white
[1:38:16] like i said before they're nearly white
[1:38:18] they're one word off from truth that's
[1:38:20] what they are and all he's looking to do
[1:38:22] is get you off one word at a time one
[1:38:23] day at a time so that by the end you're
[1:38:25] off by just a couple degrees and you
[1:38:27] miss it all together amen
[1:38:29] what is it the five full ministry puts
[1:38:31] the word in front of you without excuse
[1:38:32] and says this is the way the truth and
[1:38:34] the life walk you in it amen day in and
[1:38:37] day out they're trying to raise you to
[1:38:39] that higher plane amen because what the
[1:38:41] word is dynamic the word doesn't change
[1:38:43] amen the word is unchanging but the
[1:38:45] revelation of that word is growing and
[1:38:47] opening up day in and day out and that
[1:38:49] ought to have an effect if you've been
[1:38:50] walking the good old gospel away for 30
[1:38:52] years and you're the same as you were
[1:38:53] there's a problem
[1:38:55] amen we never stop growing brother
[1:38:57] gerald has confirmed it to me
[1:38:59] he's the oldest one here and he hasn't
[1:39:00] stopped growing yet
[1:39:02] right god is constantly growing us and
[1:39:04] changing us from glory to glory to glory
[1:39:06] and until we go in a rapture and until
[1:39:08] we go down into the earth we're never
[1:39:10] going to stop and if we stop brother
[1:39:11] brown says the minute you stop you're
[1:39:13] backslidden amen so what is it god is
[1:39:16] constantly working on us to do what grow
[1:39:19] into his image and we've got to do that
[1:39:21] we can't be stagnant the ministry can't
[1:39:23] stay stagnant preach the same thing over
[1:39:25] and over again we've got to dig in we've
[1:39:26] got to pray we've got to humble
[1:39:27] ourselves we've got to get down before
[1:39:29] god and say god we need more to bring
[1:39:31] more amen we can't preach just because
[1:39:33] the word says we need to preach by
[1:39:34] experience amen i'm just you know i'm 41
[1:39:38] years old that's tough to preach my
[1:39:40] experience sometimes because there's a
[1:39:41] lot of stuff i haven't experienced yet
[1:39:43] now i have to preach that by faith those
[1:39:45] areas and trust that god will back up
[1:39:46] his word amen but we're looking for
[1:39:48] experience amen we want to have him in
[1:39:50] our lives doing the things that he said
[1:39:51] he would do
[1:39:52] brother says this he says and look at
[1:39:54] our pen we're talking about remember
[1:39:56] getting caught up in satan's tricks
[1:39:57] which take you into formalism and look
[1:39:59] at our pentecostal message today in
[1:40:01] preaching and our people letting down
[1:40:02] constantly even normal little things
[1:40:04] they wouldn't even get on the foundation
[1:40:06] of common decency i think what sister
[1:40:08] priscilla said the other day when i was
[1:40:09] talking about so just seeing some church
[1:40:12] services and stuff and she says they
[1:40:13] even lack common decency now
[1:40:15] in a nominal church today i mean they're
[1:40:17] shouting they're dancing they're wearing
[1:40:18] all sorts of clothes tatted up you know
[1:40:20] they got hairstyles i mean ministers
[1:40:22] standing there wearing tight pants and
[1:40:23] five thousand dollar pairs of yeezy
[1:40:25] sneakers and a gold chain
[1:40:27] okay that's not even decent
[1:40:29] for a man of god to be doing something
[1:40:30] like that that's where they've gone he
[1:40:32] says it here
[1:40:35] he says then how can we claim we're
[1:40:37] going to claim the holy ghost
[1:40:40] he says it's time brother no wonder the
[1:40:41] world says you ain't got what you claim
[1:40:43] to have
[1:40:44] now i'm not preaching to us here i'm
[1:40:45] just warning us
[1:40:47] it doesn't take long to get there
[1:40:50] he says we're presuming it we're taking
[1:40:52] the name of pentecost without living the
[1:40:54] life of pentecost this is 1962.
[1:40:57] he's preaching the pentecostal churches
[1:40:58] he's saying you ain't it
[1:41:01] he says a life of pentecost the original
[1:41:04] pentecost this is what we want this is
[1:41:06] what we claim to have a life of
[1:41:08] pentecost is a consecrated life filled
[1:41:10] with the holy ghost rich and royal till
[1:41:13] there's nobody can put a finger on you
[1:41:15] that's real pentecost he says what why
[1:41:18] would you want to substitute why would
[1:41:20] the devil trick you into something like
[1:41:23] that what is brother brahman saying he's
[1:41:25] saying the life of pentecost the real
[1:41:26] life is what a holy ghost fire that'll
[1:41:28] burn out every bit of the world that's
[1:41:30] in you it'll burn out the influence of
[1:41:32] the world it'll burn out the desire of
[1:41:33] the world it'll burn out every bit of
[1:41:35] unbelief and make you live a life that
[1:41:37] nobody can put a finger on by the word
[1:41:40] by the word not by their ideas but they
[1:41:42] point to that word and say you're you're
[1:41:45] a consecrated man or woman of christ
[1:41:46] you're a sanctified man or woman in
[1:41:47] christ you have the life of christ
[1:41:49] you're not just like him you are him
[1:41:51] amen amen
[1:41:52] amen
[1:41:53] and that's a big job the ministry has i
[1:41:56] mean there's no playing around with this
[1:41:57] you don't just get up here and play
[1:41:59] preacher you don't play pastor of these
[1:42:00] things it's a serious serious thing when
[1:42:03] you start looking at this and then you
[1:42:04] remember the the seven sons of siva
[1:42:07] right and they presume they said what
[1:42:09] well we adjure you by christ who paul
[1:42:12] preaches
[1:42:13] he says christ i know paul i know who
[1:42:16] are you
[1:42:17] and then he did what ran them down the
[1:42:19] street
[1:42:20] tearing their clothes off till they were
[1:42:21] naked he exposed them for what they were
[1:42:24] which was men that were following men
[1:42:26] without a personal experience with the
[1:42:27] christ that they professed amen
[1:42:29] amen what is it for those ministry we've
[1:42:31] got to get down on our knees and say god
[1:42:33] use us use us use us because we can't do
[1:42:36] this on our own i'll never be able to
[1:42:38] help you on my own i'll lead you down
[1:42:40] the garden path and i'll waste your time
[1:42:42] all day long
[1:42:43] it may sound good it may look good but
[1:42:45] it won't be god unless he takes me and
[1:42:47] uses me and molds me and sets me aside
[1:42:50] amen and it's no same thing with brother
[1:42:52] gerald for the past 40 years that has to
[1:42:54] be god that can use a man because we get
[1:42:56] in our own way every single time
[1:42:57] otherwise amen
[1:43:00] says this he says now god said i sent
[1:43:02] them the word eve just walked right over
[1:43:04] the top of it and disbelieved it i made
[1:43:06] it manifest and they crucified it
[1:43:09] was saying every time i send it they
[1:43:11] mess it up or they they ignore it or
[1:43:13] they reject it he says i'm getting tired
[1:43:15] i'm coming myself
[1:43:18] he's not talking about christ in flesh
[1:43:19] 2000 years ago he says so here he come
[1:43:23] god in you
[1:43:25] amen it was external to eve they walk
[1:43:28] with him in the cool of the evening
[1:43:30] right it wasn't in her it was with her
[1:43:33] then christ comes down and now he's
[1:43:34] walking amongst them and they can't
[1:43:36] accept him either so now he says i've
[1:43:38] got to finish this and the only way to
[1:43:39] do it is to be in them so they can't
[1:43:41] deny me because i'm in them right i'm a
[1:43:43] part of them right they can't deny
[1:43:45] themselves
[1:43:46] right i'm going to step into them god
[1:43:48] above us the pillar of fire god with us
[1:43:50] in jesus christ god in us the holy
[1:43:52] spirit what is it he says it's the same
[1:43:55] word the same god amen no more trusting
[1:43:57] in anything else god come himself this
[1:44:00] was a man-sized job so he brought it on
[1:44:02] down he come down himself
[1:44:05] they won't
[1:44:06] this is what it looks like when he comes
[1:44:08] down
[1:44:09] they won't have nothing have to do
[1:44:12] nothing about it
[1:44:15] and just let them surrender to me
[1:44:17] and i'll walk in them talk in them speak
[1:44:21] in them
[1:44:22] work in them
[1:44:24] oh my that's it i'll do the work
[1:44:27] just let them humble themselves just let
[1:44:30] them empty up
[1:44:32] i'll just beat my enemy out through
[1:44:35] there through them that's it you can't
[1:44:38] do it yourself now you're not a match
[1:44:40] for him but if you'll just let god do it
[1:44:43] get the word in you then it will be
[1:44:45] taken care of that's where the fivefold
[1:44:48] ministry has to stand it ain't me
[1:44:51] don't look to me
[1:44:52] he's got to do it through me
[1:44:54] that's the only way it's ever going to
[1:44:55] work amen and i love what he says here
[1:44:57] this is not he's not speaking to
[1:44:59] fivefold ministry here he's talking to
[1:45:01] every son and daughter of god
[1:45:04] amen and the reason i know that is he
[1:45:06] now comes down he's
[1:45:07] he addresses the fivefold ministry in
[1:45:08] the next quote the next portion of the
[1:45:10] quote he says now god fortified his army
[1:45:12] he was just talking about his army and
[1:45:14] that's every single one of us
[1:45:16] they says now god fortified his army
[1:45:19] with what
[1:45:20] himself
[1:45:22] himself
[1:45:23] in the form of prophets apostles
[1:45:27] teachers pastors
[1:45:29] what did he do what was god doing listen
[1:45:31] did you ever think what that offices of
[1:45:33] the church is it's god's dress inside
[1:45:36] dress an apostle a prophet a seer for
[1:45:39] see before satan ever gets to it he's
[1:45:42] done told it what is it god dressed up
[1:45:44] in his church these offices is god's
[1:45:47] dress where when you see those offices
[1:45:50] pastors teachers evangelists what is
[1:45:52] that that's god's dress where god's
[1:45:55] presence god's spirit working through
[1:45:59] man
[1:46:01] now that sounds wonderful to be a
[1:46:02] minister now doesn't it
[1:46:05] nope
[1:46:07] it's a wonderful thing you say brother
[1:46:08] jonathan it's too much you make yourself
[1:46:10] god
[1:46:11] i didn't make myself god
[1:46:13] and i'm not i'm not saying it in that
[1:46:15] way brother branham said that and
[1:46:16] brother branham's not making himself god
[1:46:18] because what jesus said it not brother
[1:46:20] branham
[1:46:22] right
[1:46:23] john 10 this is the jew speaking jesus
[1:46:25] they said the jews answered him saying
[1:46:27] for our good work we stone thee not they
[1:46:28] said you've done all these good things
[1:46:30] we're not stoning you or threatening to
[1:46:31] stone you for that but for blasphemy and
[1:46:34] because thou being a man maketh thyself
[1:46:36] god they said you're not allowed to be
[1:46:38] god
[1:46:39] a man can't be god
[1:46:41] jesus answered them is it not written in
[1:46:43] your law i said ye are gods
[1:46:45] if he called them gods unto whom the
[1:46:48] word of god came
[1:46:50] and the scripture cannot be broken amen
[1:46:53] so jesus says the standard to be called
[1:46:55] a god
[1:46:56] is does the word come to you
[1:46:59] amen
[1:47:01] remember that what paul said when he was
[1:47:03] correcting them he says did the word
[1:47:04] come to you or did the word come from
[1:47:06] you
[1:47:06] right it comes to you
[1:47:09] and he says here jesus said those unto
[1:47:11] the to the word of god came our gods
[1:47:15] that's not just five full ministry
[1:47:18] word of god comes to every child of god
[1:47:20] amen and then it comes out of them
[1:47:22] and that's what they were doing was they
[1:47:23] were confusing the coming out as if they
[1:47:25] had something to do with it but the word
[1:47:27] of god comes to you that's what makes
[1:47:29] you the word of god amen amen amen the
[1:47:32] word of god comes to us all in some form
[1:47:34] or fashion amen and as long as it comes
[1:47:36] out after it comes in then you've got
[1:47:38] god
[1:47:39] and if you've got god that effectively
[1:47:41] makes you god and i'll read the quotes
[1:47:42] where he says it but he's pushing them
[1:47:44] back to psalms 82 6 amen he says i have
[1:47:47] said ye are gods
[1:47:49] and all of you are children of the most
[1:47:51] high what is it gods what do they have
[1:47:55] you know men you know humans have human
[1:47:58] babies gods have
[1:48:00] got babies yes that's all he's saying
[1:48:02] you're a child of god that makes you a
[1:48:04] god that doesn't make you the god that
[1:48:06] doesn't mean you are the supreme
[1:48:07] authority but he says you are god's you
[1:48:09] are children of god and that makes you
[1:48:11] gods that's your inheritance is to be a
[1:48:13] god and then he says he's going to put
[1:48:15] us over all the kings and kingdoms and
[1:48:17] and all these different things in the
[1:48:18] world to come what we're going to rule
[1:48:19] and reign over everybody we are going to
[1:48:21] be in a position of god amen what is it
[1:48:24] the word comes to the word
[1:48:26] god comes to god god comes to the one
[1:48:28] that was a part of him before the
[1:48:29] foundation of the world amen and then
[1:48:31] what happens is that light comes forward
[1:48:33] and that light and the word springs out
[1:48:35] and all of a sudden you've got god
[1:48:36] manifesting in your midst but only in a
[1:48:38] portion
[1:48:39] only in a portion and that's what trips
[1:48:41] us up amen
[1:48:42] listen to this this is an incredible
[1:48:44] quote brother brown says if he is in you
[1:48:46] he's the power of god
[1:48:48] live by it
[1:48:51] he's god in you the bible said ye become
[1:48:53] gods is that right aren't you all gods
[1:48:55] and jesus said it too the pharisees
[1:48:57] there said you make yourself god he said
[1:48:59] isn't it written in your law that ye are
[1:49:01] god's he now listen to this he says
[1:49:03] he made moses a god to pharaoh
[1:49:07] now moses was a god to the people as
[1:49:09] well because they couldn't remember they
[1:49:10] chose they said we can't take the glory
[1:49:12] of god when he came down the mountain
[1:49:13] they said moses you be god and that's
[1:49:15] when god did it but he says before moses
[1:49:17] ever became a god to the people moses
[1:49:19] became a god to pharaoh
[1:49:22] to the external people outside of the
[1:49:24] believers amen
[1:49:26] he says and he made you
[1:49:28] a god to the people who not to each
[1:49:32] other
[1:49:33] but a god to the people that are outside
[1:49:34] looking in your god to them
[1:49:37] amen that's right and you this morning
[1:49:40] are written epistles of god your lives
[1:49:42] are of god and even carry the holy ghost
[1:49:45] amen remember when that seventh seal
[1:49:47] opened it showed us christ from
[1:49:48] beginning to end in type and shadow and
[1:49:51] the thing is we say that was christ in a
[1:49:53] type
[1:49:54] that was christ in a portion is really
[1:49:57] what we're saying it's not that it
[1:49:58] wasn't christ it was christ in a portion
[1:50:01] in joseph christ in a portion in noah
[1:50:03] christ in a portion with abraham through
[1:50:05] bits and bits and bits so if we can see
[1:50:07] it in them why can't we see it in
[1:50:09] ourselves
[1:50:10] amen christ in us the hope of glory paul
[1:50:12] said amen that's what we're looking for
[1:50:14] and all he's saying is that makes you a
[1:50:16] god
[1:50:17] not the god but it makes you a god it's
[1:50:18] a portion of him and you and so you're a
[1:50:20] god to the people that are around you
[1:50:22] and guess what he says you are what
[1:50:24] priests and kings were intercessors
[1:50:26] guess what when somebody asks us to pray
[1:50:28] for them and we pray and they get healed
[1:50:30] what does that make us
[1:50:32] we got access to something they don't
[1:50:33] that makes us a god to them if we can
[1:50:36] put it that way because we have power we
[1:50:37] have authority we have access to
[1:50:39] something that they don't
[1:50:41] they could write movies about that kind
[1:50:43] of thing
[1:50:44] the things that happened in brother
[1:50:45] brown's ministry are the stuff of movies
[1:50:48] where they'd say it's science fiction it
[1:50:49] doesn't happen you know because now they
[1:50:51] do wizards and they you know they put
[1:50:52] their hands out and do this brother
[1:50:54] brown just speak the word and it would
[1:50:56] happen
[1:50:56] amen what was it he was god to the
[1:50:59] people and it's no different for you and
[1:51:01] i yeah smaller portion smaller gift but
[1:51:03] he says brother i'm saying here as jesus
[1:51:05] said
[1:51:06] you are god to the people that are
[1:51:08] looking on amen amen it's not just a
[1:51:11] five-fold ministry it's the entire
[1:51:13] church amen
[1:51:14] let's get him back try and finish this
[1:51:16] out amen
[1:51:17] for the perfection of the saints then
[1:51:19] for the working of the for the work of
[1:51:20] the ministry and for the edifying of the
[1:51:22] body amen so the the perfecting of the
[1:51:24] saints was the equipping of you and then
[1:51:26] the work of the ministry means that we
[1:51:28] are focused on the job i mean that our
[1:51:30] consuming passion our focus is to do the
[1:51:33] work of a minister that's what takes up
[1:51:35] the majority of our time that's what
[1:51:37] takes up the majority of the energy
[1:51:38] that's what we give ourselves to is to
[1:51:40] minister to the body of christ and then
[1:51:43] it says for what purpose for the
[1:51:45] edifying of the body of christ this is
[1:51:47] the nitty-gritty because if you look at
[1:51:49] a man and all that's happening is he's
[1:51:50] getting better and better and the body's
[1:51:52] not getting better we got a problem he
[1:51:54] says because the purpose of the
[1:51:56] five-fold ministry is to edify the
[1:51:57] entire
[1:51:59] body of christ that word edifying means
[1:52:02] the act of building
[1:52:03] and building up the act of one who
[1:52:06] promotes another person's growth in
[1:52:09] christian wisdom piety happiness and
[1:52:12] holiness over their own
[1:52:15] so it puts them in a position of
[1:52:17] servanthood
[1:52:18] not in a position of
[1:52:20] leadership
[1:52:21] amen really as we've said before
[1:52:24] leadership is an inverted pyramid where
[1:52:26] the guy that's supposedly at the top is
[1:52:27] really at the bottom amen and he's
[1:52:29] working to support everyone else that's
[1:52:31] above him amen so when you see a man
[1:52:33] that labors for you
[1:52:35] you can have confidence in that man
[1:52:36] because he's doing what god has told him
[1:52:38] to do the working of the ministry is for
[1:52:40] the edifying of the body which means you
[1:52:42] not just him amen amen
[1:52:46] says this it is only the love of our
[1:52:48] father that loves us so much that he
[1:52:50] sends his word
[1:52:52] sends his word he sends his ministers to
[1:52:55] preach the word
[1:52:57] amen so they're a carrier for the word
[1:52:59] they're bringing what he sends he sends
[1:53:01] his word and he uses a man to bring it
[1:53:04] then he sends gifts into the church with
[1:53:06] his arms spread out trying to get you to
[1:53:08] believe it stimulate your faith as we
[1:53:10] read earlier he wants to heal you
[1:53:12] tonight a thousand times more than you
[1:53:14] want to be healed but you're afraid you
[1:53:17] go by how you feel because you've
[1:53:18] regarded that you've lived by your
[1:53:20] feelings your whole life has been
[1:53:22] wrapped in that but you must get away
[1:53:24] from that and act on god's word not what
[1:53:26] you feel not what you see what god said
[1:53:29] and act on that
[1:53:30] make a confession confess means to say
[1:53:33] the same thing and he's at the right
[1:53:35] hand of the father with his own blood to
[1:53:37] make intercessions on your confession
[1:53:42] i think brother tim pruitt said it well
[1:53:43] when he says i serve you he says but i
[1:53:46] answer to god
[1:53:48] that's a fine balance sometimes because
[1:53:50] we're here for the benefit of the people
[1:53:52] but we don't answer to the people amen
[1:53:54] why because he says he sends his word
[1:53:57] and then he sends a man to preach it so
[1:53:59] he's sending the word and he's got a man
[1:54:00] that delivers it so we answer to god for
[1:54:02] what we preach we don't answer to the
[1:54:03] people and when the min when the when
[1:54:05] the lady come and they try and tell a
[1:54:07] preacher what to preach there's a
[1:54:08] problem
[1:54:09] because it's god that tells him not the
[1:54:11] people
[1:54:11] amen
[1:54:13] amen
[1:54:14] and what happens then if you get into a
[1:54:16] situation like that is that what happens
[1:54:18] you end up with a deacon board running a
[1:54:19] church you have a trustee board running
[1:54:20] the church and all of a sudden the
[1:54:22] pastor has no movement because what the
[1:54:24] holy spirit is being quenched by the
[1:54:25] leadership of men amen we don't have
[1:54:27] boards telling our pastor what to preach
[1:54:29] and then you can't do it or correcting
[1:54:31] him and then they can speak to him if
[1:54:32] he's off the word but you don't get to
[1:54:34] go in and say that really wasn't what we
[1:54:36] needed today brother no
[1:54:38] that's between him and god the answer is
[1:54:39] to god he's serving you but he answers
[1:54:41] directly to god
[1:54:43] brahm says now i want to say that i
[1:54:44] believe in leadership but it is not the
[1:54:47] leadership of men i believe in i believe
[1:54:49] in the leadership of the holy s ghost
[1:54:52] coming through the word
[1:54:55] he said he sent his word and then he
[1:54:56] sent a man to deliver the word he says i
[1:54:58] believe in the leadership of the holy
[1:55:00] ghost coming through the word so the
[1:55:01] word is our filter at all times amen i
[1:55:04] believe also that god has said men in
[1:55:06] the church men who are gifted by the
[1:55:08] spirit and they will keep the church in
[1:55:10] order i believe that
[1:55:13] i believe also that the church is ruled
[1:55:15] over by men that god sends to take
[1:55:17] charge but that rule is by the word so
[1:55:21] that it it is not men really ruling but
[1:55:24] the spirit of god for the word and the
[1:55:27] spirit are one we read that at the
[1:55:28] beginning remember one lord one father
[1:55:30] one spirit one faith one hope all these
[1:55:32] different things he says that's it's got
[1:55:34] to be the holy spirit working in them
[1:55:36] hebrews 13 7 says remember them which
[1:55:38] have the rule over you who have spoken
[1:55:39] unto you the word of god whose faith
[1:55:41] follow considering the end of their
[1:55:44] conversation
[1:55:45] what you look at how that man's life has
[1:55:47] turned out or is turning out that'll
[1:55:49] tell you if he's got the truth in him
[1:55:51] amen if his life's a mess why would you
[1:55:53] trust him amen if the word hasn't had an
[1:55:55] effect in his life what do you think
[1:55:56] it's going to have if he brings it to
[1:55:57] you amen a man's family that's the
[1:55:59] reason why there's qualifications for
[1:56:01] pastors is because their family is their
[1:56:03] first proof of ministry and then after
[1:56:05] that it will be the church body amen
[1:56:08] amen so how long are we going to keep
[1:56:09] doing this how are you going to have to
[1:56:10] listen to brother gerald and me up here
[1:56:12] and any minister that comes in
[1:56:14] he says for the perfecting the saints
[1:56:16] right for how long
[1:56:18] till we come in the unity of the faith
[1:56:21] amen and of the knowledge of the son of
[1:56:23] god unto a perfect man unto the measure
[1:56:26] of the stature of the fullness of christ
[1:56:30] we there yet
[1:56:32] he determines it
[1:56:34] we don't see sometimes exactly what we
[1:56:36] are we don't see how much god has moved
[1:56:38] in us we don't see how much he's grown
[1:56:40] in us
[1:56:41] but he's going to choose today he's
[1:56:43] going to say that's it
[1:56:45] you've come as far as i need you to go
[1:56:46] you've expressed what i need you to
[1:56:48] express but until that time the fivefold
[1:56:51] ministry will keep working amen
[1:56:53] my personal opinion is only that when
[1:56:55] those dead in christ rise and we have
[1:56:56] the 30 to 40 days of fellowship with
[1:56:58] them that's probably when we need to
[1:57:00] stop preaching
[1:57:01] it's done doors closed god's already hit
[1:57:04] the let's go home button and it's just a
[1:57:05] 30 to 40 day and then we're gone and
[1:57:07] we're just gonna sit around and
[1:57:08] fellowship we won't worry about bills we
[1:57:10] won't worry about anything we'll just be
[1:57:11] sitting around saying we're leaving soon
[1:57:14] we are definitely leaving soon isn't
[1:57:16] that right sister coffee yes brother
[1:57:18] we're leaving soon amen won't that be a
[1:57:20] wonderful thing
[1:57:21] amen but until then you've got to listen
[1:57:23] to brother gerald and myself
[1:57:26] amen what is the unity of the faith
[1:57:30] it's when your faith becomes sight
[1:57:32] amen and that is the rapture
[1:57:34] amen when you see those resurrection
[1:57:36] saints walking amongst us that's the
[1:57:37] unity of our faith that's what we're
[1:57:39] looking for brother brown says the only
[1:57:40] thing left it's going away of the church
[1:57:42] and then so you're going to have to
[1:57:43] listen to the five-fold
[1:57:45] ministry until we do that but with that
[1:57:48] with that rapture before that comes
[1:57:50] we'll have knowledge of the son of god
[1:57:51] that means you will know him
[1:57:53] in the fullness of the power of his
[1:57:54] resurrection and then you're going to
[1:57:56] know that he is god and that you are his
[1:57:58] child amen it's going to be in a way
[1:58:00] that we have never experienced it not
[1:58:02] even in the prophet's own ministry did
[1:58:04] he experience a rapture amen we're going
[1:58:06] to see something in our midst that will
[1:58:09] let us know that he is our god and we
[1:58:11] are his people amen
[1:58:12] amen glory under the measure of the
[1:58:14] stature of the fullness of christ that
[1:58:16] means we're all going to be mature we're
[1:58:18] all going to be grown up we're all going
[1:58:19] to be doing the bit that we have to that
[1:58:21] doesn't mean we're all going to be some
[1:58:23] great wonderful christian i believe
[1:58:24] we're going to have 12 or 13 year olds
[1:58:26] that just got saved and got the holy
[1:58:27] ghost but guess what there's parts of
[1:58:29] your bodies that don't have to be this
[1:58:30] amazing thing they just have to be there
[1:58:33] right take a take the little the the
[1:58:35] smallest capillary in your body and pull
[1:58:37] it out and what happens that blood flow
[1:58:40] doesn't get to the spot it needs and
[1:58:41] it'll it'll cause gangrene eventually
[1:58:43] right get enough little parts missing
[1:58:44] all they're doing is carrying blood
[1:58:46] that's all they're doing carrying blood
[1:58:47] to the to the extremities of the body
[1:58:50] take them out and the body's not perfect
[1:58:51] and it'll start to die on itself in
[1:58:53] those little places all you need is
[1:58:54] something that can carry the word amen
[1:58:56] and it's what it's done its part
[1:58:58] right it's not a big bicep it's not huge
[1:59:00] chest muscles or you know a massive back
[1:59:03] or quads the size of trees
[1:59:05] it's just a little capillary that we
[1:59:06] need to get blood to that final spot to
[1:59:08] bring it to life and then god says we're
[1:59:10] good to go
[1:59:10] amen we'd all all have to have this
[1:59:12] massive ministry
[1:59:14] man but we do have to let the word flow
[1:59:16] through us amen by the power of the holy
[1:59:17] spirit
[1:59:18] what's the effect of this amen we're
[1:59:20] closing
[1:59:21] that we henceforth be no more children
[1:59:25] tossed to and fro so this is what
[1:59:27] children are children are tossed to and
[1:59:28] fro carried about with every wind of
[1:59:31] doctrine by the slate of men
[1:59:34] and cunning craftiness whereby they lie
[1:59:36] and wait to deceive
[1:59:40] if you're dealing with any of these it
[1:59:41] means you're still a child in christ
[1:59:43] so he's saying amen we're going to
[1:59:44] mature under these ministries in other
[1:59:46] words
[1:59:46] the true fivefold ministry is going to
[1:59:48] take you from a child into a maturity in
[1:59:50] christ that cannot be achieved otherwise
[1:59:52] amen that means we're going to stop
[1:59:53] acting like children
[1:59:55] responding like children being petty
[1:59:57] like children being selfish like
[1:59:59] children we're going to start acting
[2:00:00] like real men and women in christ amen
[2:00:02] paul talked to the corinthians and i
[2:00:04] want you to catch what he says is the
[2:00:05] sign of childishness this is first
[2:00:07] corinthians 3 he says and i brethren
[2:00:10] could not speak unto you as unto
[2:00:11] spiritual that's a hard letter to read
[2:00:15] but as unto carnal even as unto babes
[2:00:17] and christ i have fed you with milk and
[2:00:19] not with meat for hitherto ye were not
[2:00:21] able to bear it neither now are you able
[2:00:24] he says i haven't been able to preach
[2:00:25] the good stuff and i still can't
[2:00:28] that's not the words you want to hear
[2:00:30] from a prophet
[2:00:31] amen
[2:00:33] what is it
[2:00:34] paul's ready to teach the deeper things
[2:00:35] paul has all the deeper things that they
[2:00:37] could ever need
[2:00:38] but he says i can't do it he says for ye
[2:00:41] are yet colonel
[2:00:42] for whereas there is among you envying
[2:00:45] and strife and divisions
[2:00:47] are ye not colonel and walker's men now
[2:00:49] these are people that you know
[2:00:51] supposedly held all things in common
[2:00:52] went from house to house fellowshipping
[2:00:54] and whatnot you say how does this kind
[2:00:56] of stuff get in
[2:00:57] next verse tells us it says
[2:00:59] for while one saith i am of paul
[2:01:02] and another i am of apollos
[2:01:05] are ye not carnal
[2:01:07] what was it people attaching themselves
[2:01:09] to men's ministries
[2:01:11] that's a sign of spiritual childishness
[2:01:15] now we don't have a whole lot of choice
[2:01:16] here i don't think we have that problem
[2:01:18] amen but just to put it out there so
[2:01:20] that we don't get into a situation like
[2:01:22] that people listening online these
[2:01:23] different things what is it people were
[2:01:25] identifying themselves with a brother's
[2:01:27] ministry rather than with christ
[2:01:30] right and listen paul's name's in there
[2:01:33] paul says some of you are saying you are
[2:01:35] of me
[2:01:36] why because you matured under my
[2:01:38] ministry you came to the lord under my
[2:01:40] ministry so you now say i'm of brother
[2:01:42] paul's church and then other ones are
[2:01:44] saying i'm of brother apollo's church he
[2:01:46] says no no you can't do that that's the
[2:01:48] way children think
[2:01:50] right
[2:01:51] what is it suddenly they weren't
[2:01:53] christians
[2:01:54] but they were i go to brother paul's
[2:01:55] church
[2:01:58] that's what we're getting into in the
[2:01:59] message quite frankly many times
[2:02:02] i go to brother so-and-so's church good
[2:02:04] are you a christian
[2:02:05] i don't know but i go to brother
[2:02:06] so-and-so's church and he's a wonderful
[2:02:08] man with a wonderful ministry and
[2:02:09] wonderful gifts no no no no so would you
[2:02:11] ever go to brother so-and-so's no no my
[2:02:13] pastor doesn't approve of him
[2:02:15] right
[2:02:16] that's what that's what happened was
[2:02:18] there were divisions based on ministry
[2:02:20] right
[2:02:21] and paul says here he says so who then
[2:02:24] is paul he says who am i who then is
[2:02:26] apollos but ministers by whom he
[2:02:29] believed even as the lord gave to every
[2:02:31] man he says look there's just men that
[2:02:33] you believe the word came to them they
[2:02:34] came to you it was god that sent them
[2:02:36] why are you attached to them
[2:02:38] right
[2:02:38] listen paul wasn't going around asking
[2:02:40] people to attach to him but his name was
[2:02:42] still being passed around as people
[2:02:43] being attached to his ministry so it's
[2:02:45] not always the men's fault sometimes it
[2:02:47] is sometimes the men put the divisions
[2:02:48] in there but people like to attach to
[2:02:50] flesh and blood rather than the
[2:02:51] supernatural amen and so they do it
[2:02:54] through the supernatural gifts rather
[2:02:55] than to the one that's operating those
[2:02:57] gifts in the first place amen listen if
[2:02:59] you can find a believer a a minister
[2:03:02] that you can rely on that you can trust
[2:03:04] on that you can accept his words you
[2:03:06] found a good thing it's god's grace to
[2:03:08] you that you've found one and it's god's
[2:03:09] grace to him that you can receive him
[2:03:11] amen because not every minister is for
[2:03:13] every person amen the pastors don't own
[2:03:15] the people they're god's people so if
[2:03:17] you can't be fed where you are get
[2:03:18] yourself to one where you can it's that
[2:03:20] simple we've turned it into this big
[2:03:22] thing of well i've got to stay here for
[2:03:23] 20 30. no no if you genuinely can't be
[2:03:26] fed where you are you need to go
[2:03:28] someplace else just make sure it's not
[2:03:30] you that's the problem instead of the
[2:03:31] pet instead of the pastor or the
[2:03:33] ministry team there amen because what
[2:03:34] you get otherwise is church hoppers
[2:03:37] right and as one brother said he says
[2:03:39] the church you're going to is perfect
[2:03:40] until you get there
[2:03:42] right
[2:03:43] because you're going to go there and
[2:03:44] you're going to find the imperfections
[2:03:46] even if you yourself are perfect it's
[2:03:48] going to turn imperfect because what
[2:03:50] you've got an imperfect spirit on you
[2:03:51] that's critical of whoever comes into
[2:03:53] that church and preaches behind that
[2:03:54] pulpit because you actually think you
[2:03:56] know more than they do usually right
[2:03:58] more spiritual these different things
[2:03:59] amen paul says look they're just men
[2:04:02] they're just men that god's using if god
[2:04:04] used one in particular for you praise
[2:04:06] the lord but it's god that sent him he
[2:04:07] didn't do anything in and of himself
[2:04:08] amen
[2:04:09] he says i planted apollos watered but
[2:04:12] god gave the increase you are where you
[2:04:14] are not because of me or not because of
[2:04:15] apollos but it's god that gave the
[2:04:17] increase amen amen now he that planteth
[2:04:21] sorry so then neither is he that
[2:04:22] planteth anything nor he that watereth
[2:04:24] he says we're nothing
[2:04:26] we're nothing no big shots no great ones
[2:04:28] amongst us as brother rams said but god
[2:04:31] that giveth the increase amen
[2:04:34] thank you jesus
[2:04:38] but he that planteth and he that
[2:04:40] watereth our one and every man shall
[2:04:42] receive his own reward according to his
[2:04:44] own labor amen like i said before we're
[2:04:46] all accountable to god for what we
[2:04:48] preach behind this pulpit amen for we
[2:04:51] are laborers together with god
[2:04:53] amen again we're the ones working but ye
[2:04:56] are god's husbandry and year god's
[2:04:58] building it's his and his alone to work
[2:05:00] with you to claim what any sort of
[2:05:02] benefit to claim any sort of praise any
[2:05:04] sort of honor any sort of credit
[2:05:07] doesn't go to the ministry he says ye
[2:05:09] are god's husbandry and ye
[2:05:12] are god's building amen amen we don't
[2:05:13] want to get stuck on brother so and so
[2:05:15] was preaching for us brother so-and-so
[2:05:17] is and and we start ignoring what's
[2:05:19] right in front of us amen you need to be
[2:05:21] able to feed on what you have in front
[2:05:22] of you or you need to get someplace
[2:05:23] where you can amen now we still need to
[2:05:26] have the five-fold ministry he didn't
[2:05:27] ordain a five-fold ministry so we could
[2:05:29] have a one or a two-fold either that's
[2:05:30] the flip side right because what it is
[2:05:32] is remember they come in to stimulate
[2:05:34] your faith and guess what one brother
[2:05:36] may stem your fa stimulate your faith
[2:05:38] different than brother gerald does and i
[2:05:39] stimulate it different and another
[2:05:41] brother comes in and he's got a gift of
[2:05:42] this and that what is it is to help
[2:05:44] boost the body and then sometimes we
[2:05:45] have a need of that quick injection or
[2:05:47] an evangelist to come in and kind of
[2:05:48] think clean things up a bit guess what
[2:05:50] when you get divisions in the church and
[2:05:52] people are tied in and there's personal
[2:05:54] connections you need somebody to come in
[2:05:55] that knows nothing about it and he
[2:05:57] preaches the word and he hammers it out
[2:05:59] and then you either line up or you get
[2:06:00] out right we need that in there
[2:06:03] sometimes to just kind of what flush the
[2:06:04] local church out to deal with a couple
[2:06:06] situations and guess what brother gerald
[2:06:08] needs feeding i need feeding as well
[2:06:10] that five full ministry brings in what
[2:06:12] word for the pastor word for the
[2:06:14] minister that gets behind the pulpit
[2:06:15] it's nice to receive not always give
[2:06:18] you know and those sorts of things so
[2:06:19] they're there for that purpose but if
[2:06:21] you're here
[2:06:22] god has supplied the ministry that you
[2:06:24] need on a daily basis and then it's up
[2:06:26] to him to bring in the extras that we
[2:06:27] need from time to time as well amen
[2:06:29] amen
[2:06:31] so as we close ephesians 4 15. so this
[2:06:34] is when we stop being children this is
[2:06:36] what it looks like it says but speaking
[2:06:38] the truth in love we may grow up into
[2:06:41] him in all things which is the head
[2:06:44] even christ
[2:06:46] amen god bless you if i'll just invite
[2:06:49] the musicians to come up amen god's love
[2:06:51] is the requirement here that he's
[2:06:53] talking about that we grow up into what
[2:06:55] all things
[2:06:56] in love we grow up into all things that
[2:06:59] he has called us to be amen amen amen
[2:07:02] for whom the whole body fitly joined
[2:07:04] together and compacted by that which
[2:07:06] every joint supply according to the
[2:07:08] effectual working and the measure of
[2:07:10] every part maketh increase of the body
[2:07:12] unto the edifying of itself in love that
[2:07:14] is the most difficult line in scripture
[2:07:16] to read and it makes almost no sense
[2:07:19] until you break it down bit by bit but
[2:07:20] what he's saying is the body has what it
[2:07:22] needs to supply its own needs god adds
[2:07:26] him what's needed if it's missing he
[2:07:27] brings it in it's not needed it takes it
[2:07:29] out amen and everything is working there
[2:07:31] to what help everyone in that in that
[2:07:33] body grow to mature to tie us together
[2:07:36] to get us to the place where we're all
[2:07:38] exactly where god wants us to be
[2:07:40] according to his word according to the
[2:07:41] image that he had before the foundation
[2:07:44] of the world amen let's just stand us
[2:07:46] up together i mean lord willing after
[2:07:49] this we'll see where it goes i'm not
[2:07:50] sure maybe we will go into the the gifts
[2:07:52] in the local body in these things but
[2:07:54] still praying about i don't have
[2:07:56] direction on that yet but i'm headed out
[2:07:58] on vacation shortly of course i think
[2:07:59] brother gerald's got wednesday night but
[2:08:01] uh just trusting god will be here and
[2:08:03] moving the services amen let's bow our
[2:08:05] heads
[2:08:08] heavenly father
[2:08:09] amen
