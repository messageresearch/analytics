[45:57] many that aren't here Lord the families

[46:23] your word in Jesus Christ's name we're
[46:25] asking it amen amen thank you musicians
[46:29] turn if you will to Romans chapter 7.
[46:32] Romans chapter 7.
[46:34] and good to be back in the house of the
[46:37] Lord I'm not sure who ordered the white
[46:38] stuff but
[46:40] I guess it was inevitable that we were
[46:42] going to get some eventually huh
[46:44] amen only a little bit and they say
[46:46] it'll be gone hopefully by the end of
[46:47] the week so
[46:48] Hope Springs Eternal
[46:51] give me lots or don't give me any I
[46:53] don't like the back and forth amen
[46:57] and then certainly want to remember
[46:59] brother Gerald though it's
[47:01] it's uh you get sick when you're older
[47:03] and you stop eating it's serious
[47:05] business so we want to just pray the
[47:06] Lord will touch him quickly and restore
[47:08] them back to health and strength amen
[47:10] Romans chapter 7 and verse 4 says
[47:13] wherefore my brethren ye also are become
[47:15] dead to the law by the body of Christ
[47:18] that ye should be married to another
[47:20] even to him who is raised from the dead
[47:23] that we should bring forth fruit unto
[47:25] God for when we were in the flesh the
[47:28] Motions of sin which were by the law did
[47:30] work in our members to bring forth fruit
[47:32] unto death
[47:34] but now we are delivered from the law
[47:36] that being dead wherein we were held
[47:38] that we should serve in newness of
[47:40] spirit and not in the oldness of the
[47:43] letter amen God bless you can have your
[47:45] seats this evening
[47:46] may we want to continue our series on
[47:48] Redemption and we're turning another
[47:50] corner and I've said before we've turned
[47:52] corners and we we talked about the the
[47:54] disparity and the Fallen nature of
[47:56] humanity and we turn that corner and
[47:58] then we talked about all that Christ did
[48:00] and and all the sacrifices he made and
[48:02] the life that he gave and then we turned
[48:04] a corner from there and now we're we're
[48:06] talking about what it's supposed to do
[48:08] to the believer we're talking about the
[48:10] effects of redemption now it's not just
[48:11] the work that he did but but we want to
[48:13] see that work in action we want to see
[48:15] what it is that God's trying to do and
[48:17] what God has purpose to do in each and
[48:19] every one of our Lives amen because we
[48:21] don't want to stop at Salvation
[48:23] that's where so many in the world have
[48:25] stopped as they say well I've accepted
[48:27] the finished work of Calvary and
[48:29] therefore I his my my debts have been
[48:31] paid I'm no longer uh counted a sinner
[48:33] and that's good enough for me and they
[48:35] stay there and that is not what makes
[48:37] you a Christian is that you have your
[48:39] sins forgiven to be Christian means to
[48:41] be christ-like amen so that means you've
[48:43] got a life that your words are like
[48:44] Christ that your life is like Christ
[48:46] that your actions and reactions are like
[48:48] Christ that your attitudes that your
[48:50] motives your objectives all of that is
[48:51] like Christ that's what makes you a
[48:53] Christian being a Christian is not just
[48:55] I I've accepted the finished work of
[48:57] Calvary but that's where denominations
[48:58] preach it is that's all you need to be a
[49:00] Christian is except the finished work of
[49:02] Calvary the finished work of Calvary is
[49:04] not salvation the finished work of
[49:06] Calvary is justification which is tied
[49:08] to Salvation sanctification and the
[49:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost which is a new
[49:12] birth that's the finished work of
[49:13] Calvary when you look at the whole thing
[49:15] because God had a purpose and a plan for
[49:17] it and it wasn't just to pay the debt
[49:19] but it was to bring you back to
[49:20] something that is what Redemption is is
[49:22] it starts with saving and it brings you
[49:24] back into position and relationship amen
[49:26] so that's what we're wanting to talk to
[49:28] talk about tonight and as we start to
[49:30] make this transition I mean as we want
[49:32] to talk about what happens when you say
[49:33] that word is for me
[49:35] not just the blood is for me but what
[49:37] that the the word that died there it had
[49:39] something to say to me it left something
[49:41] for me and that's what I'm interested in
[49:43] now I don't just want the the free gift
[49:45] of salvation but I want to move into
[49:46] what the word says I'm supposed to be
[49:48] doing amen Jesus didn't just die so our
[49:51] sins could be forgiven amen that had to
[49:53] happen so that the law could be
[49:54] fulfilled and so it could no longer hold
[49:56] us and then he was going to take us into
[49:58] a new law and that's what we want to
[50:00] preach on tonight is for a title is I
[50:02] want to preach on a new way of life amen
[50:05] and we've covered that effect of the law
[50:06] of Moses and we know that none of us
[50:08] could reach that standard none of us
[50:09] could live by the law of Moses and work
[50:11] death in us as we just read Paul
[50:13] preaching there he says the only thing
[50:14] it could do was yell at us and say
[50:16] you're a law breaker you're a failure
[50:18] you're a sinner you're incomplete you're
[50:20] Unholy all that's what the law could do
[50:22] the law condemned us it did not save us
[50:24] it did not redeem us it did not lift us
[50:26] up but it pushed us down down and we
[50:28] never had any hope under that law amen
[50:31] but the horrible thing was is whatever
[50:34] it said to us was true
[50:36] everything the law said about us was
[50:37] true we're horrible we're bad we're
[50:40] sinful we're unworthy there's nothing
[50:42] good in us that was what the law kept
[50:44] screaming at us and it was true
[50:46] but then Christ came and he made a
[50:48] remedy he was the remedy but he's made a
[50:50] way back amen it's not just to leave us
[50:52] there and take us away from from our sin
[50:54] debt but he took he wants to take us
[50:55] back to someplace else now Paul opens up
[50:58] as we've read in Romans 7 he said
[51:00] wherefore my brethren ye also are become
[51:03] dead to the law by the body of Christ
[51:05] that ye should be married to another
[51:06] we're going to touch this on the next
[51:08] service dying in marriage even to him
[51:10] who is raised from the dead that we
[51:13] should bring forth fruit unto God I
[51:14] pulled out the Amplified and it says
[51:16] likewise my brethren you have undergone
[51:18] death as to the law through the
[51:21] crucified Body of Christ so that you may
[51:24] now belong to another to him who was
[51:26] raised from the dead in order that we
[51:28] may bear fruit for God so in other words
[51:30] when Christ died
[51:32] Our obligation to the law died with them
[51:35] because he fulfilled it he took care of
[51:38] everything every angle every price every
[51:40] jot every Tittle of the law he fulfilled
[51:42] it by living a perfect life In the Flesh
[51:45] and so when he died the price was paid
[51:47] the law was fulfilled somebody had met
[51:50] the standard of the law which was live a
[51:52] perfect life
[51:53] he did that so when he did that the what
[51:56] Paul is saying here is that when Christ
[51:58] died having paid that having met the the
[52:01] standard of the law he was accepted as
[52:03] the perfect sacrifice to pay the price
[52:05] for the rest of us and so when he died
[52:07] that was done it was a finished work and
[52:10] he breaks Us free from the law at that
[52:11] point
[52:12] that's what happened right there now the
[52:14] prophet of God said now maybe and maybe
[52:16] now tonight you'll accept that salvation
[52:18] but it's already paid for the debt has
[52:21] been cleared up and the devil that puts
[52:24] you in the pawn shop Jesus came and
[52:26] redeemed you and opened up the doors and
[52:28] the only thing you have to do is walk
[52:30] out and claim your Liberty
[52:31] that's all you have a receipt from God
[52:34] that the debt is paid Jesus said in his
[52:37] last words it is finished
[52:39] so that means there's nothing you can
[52:41] add to it and there's nothing you can
[52:43] take away from it
[52:44] nothing you can do can change it you
[52:47] can't turn it back you can't turn back
[52:49] the clock you can't make it of none
[52:50] effect neither can you make it more
[52:52] effective it's done it's finished you
[52:54] already have the receipt saying it is
[52:56] finished the price is paid and then he
[52:58] said every Redemptive blessing was
[53:00] completely finished God's Great wrath on
[53:02] sin when he became sin for us the debt
[53:05] was settled so that's what happened when
[53:08] he died is that Our obligation to the
[53:10] law died with him
[53:12] and we died with them even even Paul
[53:14] says that we were in him when he died so
[53:16] it's all completed it's all finished so
[53:18] we can't be looking now to the law which
[53:20] is performance
[53:22] to make us anything good
[53:24] because our price is paid so the law is
[53:27] now null and void it has no effect the
[53:29] contract has been met so if we go back
[53:31] to Romans 7 verse 5 Paul says for when
[53:34] we were in the flesh the Motions of sin
[53:37] which were by the law did work in our
[53:39] members to bring forth fruit unto death
[53:43] now we're looking at the fruit of the
[53:44] Holy Spirit that's what we want all
[53:46] these different things through here but
[53:48] Paul says before Christ died the only
[53:50] thing it brought forth was death because
[53:52] we could never meet the standard and so
[53:54] we were always being pushed down down
[53:55] rather than lifted up amen
[53:59] so if we live by the Flesh and the
[54:01] natures of Flesh and our genetics and
[54:03] our human Spirit the fruit is always
[54:04] death remember the scripture says that
[54:06] there's a way that seemeth right to a
[54:08] man but the end thereof are the ways of
[54:10] death Jose doesn't say way there's one
[54:13] way true in light truth and life there's
[54:15] one but when it comes to death there's a
[54:17] lot of ways and man thinks up every
[54:19] single one of them and they find new
[54:21] ways to die they find new ways to leave
[54:23] God they find new ways to create
[54:25] religion they find new ways to put up
[54:27] barriers between them and eternal life
[54:28] and it just leads them to death death
[54:30] Death there is one way that seems right
[54:33] to a man and every one of us has a
[54:34] different idea and every one of those
[54:36] ways is death that's the only place it's
[54:38] going to take us amen doesn't matter
[54:40] where we were raised whether it's a
[54:41] Christian Home a message home whether
[54:43] it's out in the world it doesn't matter
[54:45] your ways are always going to lead to
[54:47] death until you come under the nature of
[54:49] Christ
[54:50] but in verse 6 he says but now we are
[54:52] delivered from the law so that being
[54:55] dead wherein we were held that we should
[54:57] serve in newness of spirit and not in
[55:00] the oldness of the letter so catch the
[55:03] wording there this this this
[55:04] relationship we have with the law was
[55:06] not a good one it says we were held we
[55:09] were imprisoned we were bound we were
[55:11] Shackled by it we were rendered
[55:13] ineffective by the law we were captured
[55:17] by it and we could do nothing about it
[55:18] and all it could do is tell us your
[55:20] unworthy unclean you're filthy you're
[55:22] useless you can't do anything good
[55:24] you're Unholy there's nothing of God in
[55:26] you that's what bound us up amen but
[55:28] praise the Lord when he came and Christ
[55:31] died then we have something we were
[55:33] delivered from it we were delivered from
[55:35] a performance requirement
[55:38] were delivered from having to do it all
[55:40] right
[55:41] not that we want to stop doing it right
[55:43] but it's not based on performance now we
[55:46] don't have to go to Christ because of
[55:47] our performance we come to him because
[55:49] we want to be like him we want to have
[55:51] him working through US amen that's why
[55:53] we're coming but we don't have to come
[55:54] on the basis of a good performance or a
[55:57] bad performance
[55:58] he's given us a spirit that he calls out
[56:00] what Abba Father daddy father and it
[56:02] draws us back to him regardless of our
[56:04] condition
[56:06] amen what was it it was a freedom that
[56:08] took condemnation and turned it into
[56:10] conviction
[56:10] because the law only condemned
[56:13] the law could only condemn but
[56:15] conviction can take you somewhere I've
[56:17] said this before but to put it in the
[56:19] perspective of a Believer condemnation
[56:22] is always satanic always
[56:25] so if you're in a place of condemnation
[56:27] tonight that is Satan trying to push on
[56:30] you that is Satan trying to hold you
[56:31] from from the love and the and the
[56:33] freedom that is in Christ tonight
[56:35] because condemnation tells you of the
[56:38] problem
[56:39] and it doesn't give you the solution so
[56:42] it's uh condemnation focuses on you
[56:46] so if you're looking at yourself and
[56:48] saying I can't do this and I can't do
[56:50] this or I always do this and I always do
[56:52] that
[56:53] you're in Romans 7 with Paul
[56:56] because that's what Paul could only say
[56:57] in Romans 7. I find there this law in my
[57:00] flesh so when I would good would do good
[57:02] evil is always present with me and I'm
[57:04] always trying to do the right thing and
[57:06] the wrong thing keeps happening and I
[57:08] always try and do the right thing and
[57:09] the wrong thing keeps happening and
[57:10] every time I go to read my Bible
[57:12] somebody calls me and every time I try
[57:14] and have devotions something pulls me
[57:16] away and this and that and every time I
[57:18] try and do something for the Lord
[57:19] something gets in my way
[57:22] Paul says we're in a battle
[57:24] we're in a fight
[57:25] and that's what condemnation does is it
[57:28] says you're never winning
[57:29] and it just keeps telling you you're
[57:31] never winning
[57:32] but that's Satan trying to keep you
[57:34] bound because that's what the law tried
[57:36] to do Satan will put you under the law
[57:38] every time if he can do it
[57:40] based on performance rather than based
[57:42] on the grace of God Amen condemnation
[57:44] reminds me it reminds you and me where
[57:48] you are right now today that's all it
[57:50] tells you this is where you're at buddy
[57:52] this is where you're at sister and
[57:54] you're no good but what does conviction
[57:56] do now conviction on the other one is
[57:58] from God because he tells you of the
[58:00] problem and then he points you to the
[58:03] word and shows you the remedy that will
[58:05] get you out of your problem amen
[58:07] conviction leads to repentance and
[58:10] repentance leads you to Restoration
[58:12] so he not only tells you the problem but
[58:14] he tells you the solution and he tells
[58:16] you I'm ready and waiting for you
[58:17] anytime you want to come out of this it
[58:19] remember it struck me so much from
[58:21] Brother John and he's preached on that
[58:23] he said if my son had only known how
[58:25] willing I was to forgive him he'd have
[58:27] come to me a long time ago that's the
[58:28] father he's given you a spirit that's
[58:30] supposed to say daddy father daddy
[58:33] father I'm doing wrong I can't get out
[58:35] of it I'm struggling I'm having issues
[58:40] and then he's saying well come in come
[58:42] in and talk to me I can help you
[58:44] there's a remedy come in let's talk
[58:46] about it let's sit down and reason
[58:48] together son let's come in and read them
[58:50] together daughter I've got something for
[58:52] you amen conviction reminds you of where
[58:55] you're supposed to be
[58:57] so it points to your position
[59:00] in Christ and then shows you the
[59:02] difference between that and where you're
[59:03] standing now
[59:05] so it's pointing you you're supposed to
[59:06] be up here but you're living down here
[59:08] but this is still available
[59:11] that's what he's letting you know this
[59:12] is available so let's come up a little
[59:14] higher and then like John let's come up
[59:17] a little higher into a higher plane of
[59:18] life into a higher plane of Revelation
[59:20] into a higher plane of victory of
[59:22] overcoming power in our lives amen
[59:24] that's what conviction does is it says
[59:26] there's a higher plane than where you're
[59:27] at right now and often it's because
[59:29] you've been there before
[59:31] not always but often you've been there
[59:34] and you've just dropped back a bit he
[59:35] says hey let's get back to that and then
[59:37] he'll take you on further then he shows
[59:39] you by the word amen but that that idea
[59:42] of conviction versus condemnation gives
[59:43] us this beautiful transition in Romans 7
[59:45] because at the second last verse of
[59:47] Romans 7 Paul says who can deliver me
[59:50] from this body from the body of this
[59:52] death
[59:53] this natural flesh that we're in he says
[59:55] who can deliver me from it drives me
[59:57] nuts as we would say today
[1:00:00] drives me nuts it's always giving me
[1:00:02] problems who can deliver me from it
[1:00:05] sometimes we feel who can deliver me
[1:00:07] from what I'm going through in this body
[1:00:09] the constant fight the constant battle
[1:00:11] hey we're called we're we're talking
[1:00:14] about uh you know the armor of God and
[1:00:17] weapons of warfare and there's things
[1:00:18] not because we're sitting in a country
[1:00:20] cottage shipping tea as a Christian
[1:00:22] it's a battle it's a fight we got to be
[1:00:25] ready that we're gonna get knocked down
[1:00:27] from time to time that we're going to
[1:00:28] get scarred we're gonna get hurt we're
[1:00:29] going to get wounded in this because
[1:00:31] we're always in a battle even with our
[1:00:33] own flesh even if everyone around us
[1:00:34] leaves us alone we're in a battle with
[1:00:36] this flesh amen
[1:00:38] but Paul fires up in Romans 8 so he said
[1:00:40] who can deliver me from this body of
[1:00:42] death in Romans 7. and then he fires up
[1:00:44] in Romans 8 and he says there is
[1:00:46] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:00:49] which are in Christ Jesus who walk not
[1:00:52] after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:00:54] no condemnation I wasn't making it up
[1:00:56] when I said condemnation was from Satan
[1:00:58] Paul says there's no condemnation when
[1:01:00] you're in Christ why because he'll only
[1:01:01] convict and bring you back to where
[1:01:03] you're supposed to be no condemnation
[1:01:05] because the law is dead and you're under
[1:01:07] grace and there's a sacrifice made and
[1:01:09] it's atoning for you eternally as we
[1:01:11] preached about amen
[1:01:12] it didn't say there is nothing wrong in
[1:01:15] your life
[1:01:17] see we look at that and we say that
[1:01:19] means a perfect life no that means that
[1:01:21] there's no condemnation that there's a
[1:01:23] remedy that you can go in sincerity
[1:01:25] before God and say God I'm sorry I did
[1:01:28] it and he can take away every ache every
[1:01:31] pain every guilt on your conscience you
[1:01:33] can walk away free clean not worrying
[1:01:36] right there
[1:01:37] that's where I am by God's grace when I
[1:01:40] do something wrong I go and I say Lord
[1:01:42] I'm sorry you know that my heart didn't
[1:01:44] want to do it
[1:01:45] but I did it anyways
[1:01:47] Lord forgive me for my weakness and it's
[1:01:50] usually in a moment of weakness it's
[1:01:52] usually when you're tired when you're
[1:01:53] frustrated when you've been going
[1:01:55] through things and going and going and
[1:01:57] you just slack off a little bit and
[1:01:58] Satan boom he comes in quick he knows
[1:02:00] when you're not doing so well doesn't he
[1:02:02] when you skip devotions for the day or
[1:02:05] the week
[1:02:06] when the kids have had you running
[1:02:07] around frazzled when work just has you
[1:02:09] running from Pillar To Post
[1:02:11] when the family's all up in a tizzy
[1:02:13] about something then Satan will come in
[1:02:15] you'll drop something in guess what we
[1:02:16] fail we fail
[1:02:18] but there is no condemnation to them
[1:02:20] which are in Christ he can't hold you if
[1:02:22] you're in Christ and you remember that
[1:02:24] you're in Christ amen
[1:02:26] Paul says this is this is Paul giving
[1:02:28] contrast Romans 7 who will deliver me
[1:02:30] from the body of this death and then he
[1:02:32] says there's no condemnation now Paul is
[1:02:34] showing contrast he's saying this is
[1:02:36] where I am now
[1:02:37] I used to be living in a body under
[1:02:39] death he says now there's no
[1:02:40] condemnation
[1:02:42] now no matter what this body does
[1:02:43] there's no condemnation
[1:02:45] amen he says this is where I am after
[1:02:47] Christ took me out from the law of sin
[1:02:49] and death and this is where the believer
[1:02:51] sits today amen
[1:02:54] there's nothing that should be able to
[1:02:55] hold you down when you make a mistake
[1:02:58] except your unwillingness to repent
[1:03:01] that's you that's you holding back God's
[1:03:03] not sitting there saying I won't receive
[1:03:05] him
[1:03:06] no sir that's the 17th time he did it
[1:03:09] sometimes we do it 17 times
[1:03:11] and every single time listen if he told
[1:03:14] Peter Peter said how many times do I
[1:03:15] forgive my brother by seven he said by
[1:03:18] 70 times seven if that's his if that's
[1:03:20] what he expects of us to forgive of each
[1:03:22] other then what is his willingness to
[1:03:23] forgive us when we fall over and over
[1:03:26] and over again amen there's Grace for
[1:03:28] these things amen God can't even see our
[1:03:30] sins right now
[1:03:32] so always waiting for is repentance
[1:03:33] that's the only thing required to bring
[1:03:35] you back into his presence is repentance
[1:03:37] second verse says for the law of the
[1:03:40] spirit of life in Christ Jesus had made
[1:03:42] me free from the law of sin and death so
[1:03:45] catch that Paul says the thing that's
[1:03:46] made me free from condemnation is the
[1:03:49] law of the spirit of life and that's the
[1:03:51] law that he was under then he was under
[1:03:52] the law of sin and death now he's under
[1:03:54] the law of the spirit of life that's a
[1:03:56] swap I'd like to take that's a swap I've
[1:03:59] taken amen that I'm not driven by my own
[1:04:01] performance but now I'm living by the
[1:04:03] law of the spirit of life
[1:04:06] Paul says for what the law could not do
[1:04:08] in that it was weak through the flesh so
[1:04:11] in other words the law couldn't achieve
[1:04:12] anything righteous because our flesh
[1:04:14] always failed us
[1:04:15] God's sending his own son in the
[1:04:17] likeness of sinful flesh and for sin
[1:04:20] condemned sin in the flesh so Christ
[1:04:23] didn't just condemn our flesh he
[1:04:25] condemned the sin itself that was
[1:04:27] registering in our flesh and he took
[1:04:28] away its power by defeating it by living
[1:04:31] a perfect life he defeated sin by
[1:04:33] showing that you could live a life
[1:04:34] without sin
[1:04:36] then he comes in verse 7 or in verse 4
[1:04:39] he says that the righteousness of the
[1:04:41] law might be fulfilled in who
[1:04:43] us
[1:04:45] who walk not after the flesh but after
[1:04:48] the spirit so watch now Paul's starting
[1:04:49] to switch gears and he says we're not
[1:04:51] talking about the power of the flesh now
[1:04:53] which give him so many issues but he
[1:04:54] says we're talking about the power of
[1:04:56] the spirit in US
[1:04:57] for they that are after The Flesh do
[1:05:00] mine the things of the flesh
[1:05:01] very simple if you're living according
[1:05:03] to your flesh you'll focus on things
[1:05:05] that are of the flesh
[1:05:07] you'll focus on worldly things
[1:05:09] but they that are after the spirit the
[1:05:11] things of the spirit so if you're living
[1:05:13] by the Holy Spirit you'll focus on
[1:05:14] things that the holy spirit is
[1:05:15] interested in
[1:05:17] it's very simple it's not rocket science
[1:05:19] here he says for to be carnally minded
[1:05:22] is death remember every a man that has a
[1:05:25] way that he thinks his life in the ways
[1:05:27] thereof are the ways of death he says to
[1:05:29] be carnally minded is death but to be
[1:05:31] spiritually minded is life and peace now
[1:05:34] listen we could leave church right here
[1:05:36] and if we had a revelation of that verse
[1:05:38] we would live an overcoming Victorious
[1:05:40] peaceful life the rest of our life
[1:05:41] because when we're under what the law of
[1:05:44] the spirit of life it doesn't just give
[1:05:46] us life but Paul takes on he says and
[1:05:48] peace what are we seeking so often peace
[1:05:51] we want rest we want to be out of worry
[1:05:53] that's why we work so hard to get money
[1:05:55] so that we'll have what Financial Peace
[1:05:59] why do we eat and and try and be healthy
[1:06:01] so that we'll have physical peace and
[1:06:04] all we're looking for is peace and rest
[1:06:06] everybody wants to get to retirement
[1:06:08] don't they what's that supposedly peace
[1:06:10] and rest can I get an amen
[1:06:13] no it's a lie
[1:06:15] it's a lie it's not all peace and rest
[1:06:18] but that's where they want to get where
[1:06:19] their finances are taken care of they
[1:06:21] still have their health their marriage
[1:06:23] is hopefully intact they can take their
[1:06:25] shoes off and Dabble their toes in the
[1:06:27] in the soft sand of the of the sunny
[1:06:30] South if they want to everybody's
[1:06:32] looking for peace everybody wants rest
[1:06:35] everybody wants wants to be assured that
[1:06:37] nothing's gonna go wrong
[1:06:39] and so that's what they're looking for
[1:06:40] that's what they're striving so hard to
[1:06:42] do and usually what it does is it takes
[1:06:44] them out of the very thing they could
[1:06:45] have if they stop trying
[1:06:47] we drive ourselves into a tizzy trying
[1:06:49] to achieve the thing that we already
[1:06:50] have if we just stop trying to do it and
[1:06:53] it's no different with Christ because he
[1:06:55] is our peace
[1:06:56] he's our peace who's broken down the
[1:06:58] barrier of the wall that was between and
[1:07:00] is made two out of one and all these
[1:07:01] different things he talked about that's
[1:07:03] the United of Israel and and and the
[1:07:05] Gentiles we know but he is our peace he
[1:07:08] is our rest and if we would if we looked
[1:07:10] at that and said that to be spiritually
[1:07:12] minded is life and peace then we
[1:07:13] wouldn't walk into situations and the
[1:07:15] first thing we talk about is what
[1:07:16] circumstance
[1:07:18] the issues but rather we'd say this is
[1:07:21] what the word says about this this is
[1:07:23] what the word says about our issue this
[1:07:25] is what the word says about the problem
[1:07:27] this is what the word says he's going to
[1:07:29] do in this situation and that is our
[1:07:31] peace if we believe it
[1:07:33] whether it's sickness whether it's
[1:07:34] financial distress whether it's issues
[1:07:36] with our jobs or marriage whether it's
[1:07:38] issues in the church whatever it might
[1:07:40] be if we'd say listen I am a son and a
[1:07:43] daughter of God
[1:07:44] sons of God are led by the spirit of God
[1:07:47] my life is clear my conscience is clear
[1:07:50] that means that whatever is happening
[1:07:52] he's got a purpose in it and he's got a
[1:07:54] plan in it and that means that though I
[1:07:56] am fighting
[1:07:58] I can be at peace
[1:08:00] because I know the outcome is in his
[1:08:02] hands and he's never going to leave me
[1:08:04] he's never going to forsake me and so
[1:08:06] there's a benefit for it even in the
[1:08:08] struggle even in the trial even in the
[1:08:11] falling down
[1:08:13] in all of it amen
[1:08:15] so why don't we have it brother John
[1:08:17] because we're in the flesh and sometimes
[1:08:20] the flesh wins against the spirit
[1:08:23] doesn't take away your salvation you're
[1:08:25] still sealed your Soul's still going
[1:08:27] into eternal life that's not the problem
[1:08:29] but it's at war with the spirit the
[1:08:31] Flesh and the spirit are at enmity
[1:08:32] they're at loggerheads they keep
[1:08:33] fighting and sometimes we get tired or
[1:08:36] sometimes we just give in and the flesh
[1:08:38] wins and what do we do we step out of
[1:08:40] peace
[1:08:41] that's all
[1:08:42] very simple we just forget Who We Are
[1:08:46] and we forget who's really running the
[1:08:48] show
[1:08:49] he says it here because the carnal mind
[1:08:52] is enmity against God for it is not
[1:08:55] subject to the law of God neither indeed
[1:08:57] can be there's the battle right there
[1:08:59] what the carnal mind
[1:09:01] remember we covered that that quite a
[1:09:02] while ago and we covered the different
[1:09:03] Gates into and out of the body and the
[1:09:05] idea is that on the inner core you have
[1:09:07] the Holy Spirit in that sealed and your
[1:09:09] mind is a flap and it opens up for Faith
[1:09:11] or it closes for doubt
[1:09:13] and the idea is to open up your mind so
[1:09:15] that the faith of the word can come out
[1:09:17] of your soul and run in through your
[1:09:19] through your your inner inner members
[1:09:21] and then into your outer members and and
[1:09:22] you can have the victory that way but
[1:09:24] what happens is you lose the battle here
[1:09:25] and then what's inside can't come out
[1:09:28] and so you lose your peace
[1:09:30] that's the issue amen
[1:09:32] but notice
[1:09:33] here
[1:09:34] he didn't say that we never have a
[1:09:37] battle
[1:09:39] he never said that there wouldn't be an
[1:09:41] enemy
[1:09:43] he said there is going to be an enemy
[1:09:45] and it's in your mind
[1:09:46] and so your mind is where the battle is
[1:09:48] and that's where Satan's going to be
[1:09:49] going time and time again now he did say
[1:09:52] though that no weapon that's formed
[1:09:54] against the that's formed against you
[1:09:55] can stand it can prosper it can't do it
[1:09:57] but he didn't say there wouldn't be
[1:09:58] weapons formed against us did he no he's
[1:10:00] saying quite the opposite the weapon
[1:10:02] that's formed against you won't Prosper
[1:10:03] as long as you can stay in the spirit
[1:10:05] that's what we're striving for is to get
[1:10:07] out of our thinking and get into the
[1:10:09] word and let the word speak through US
[1:10:10] rather than reason our way through the
[1:10:12] situation or the problems that we're
[1:10:14] facing amen verse 8 says so then they
[1:10:17] that are in the flesh cannot please God
[1:10:19] so stop trying
[1:10:22] stop trying to make your acceptance in
[1:10:24] Christ based on your performance
[1:10:27] we want to do good
[1:10:29] absolutely I'm not you know me I'm not
[1:10:32] trying to tell you not to do good but
[1:10:33] I'm saying don't let your Christianity
[1:10:34] be based on how good you are or aren't
[1:10:36] doing on a particular day that doesn't
[1:10:38] change who you are doesn't change that
[1:10:40] you are Son of God doesn't change that
[1:10:41] you're a daughter of God
[1:10:43] just changes how close you are to him
[1:10:45] that's all
[1:10:46] changes how much he can use you
[1:10:48] changes how much he trusts you to do his
[1:10:50] work that's all all he's trying to do is
[1:10:53] get you to a place where you're so
[1:10:54] yielded that he can adopt you and then
[1:10:56] he can really start to use you in the
[1:10:58] Kingdom amen
[1:11:00] verse 9 says but ye are not in the flesh
[1:11:02] but in the spirit if so be that the
[1:11:05] spirit of God dwell in you now if any
[1:11:07] man have not the spirit of Christ he's
[1:11:08] none of his if there's a big if in
[1:11:10] scripture that's it
[1:11:12] ye are not in the flesh but in the
[1:11:14] spirit if so be that the spirit of God
[1:11:17] dwell in you this isn't just
[1:11:19] justification now it's not just
[1:11:21] sanctification remember what
[1:11:23] sanctification is cleaning out for
[1:11:25] service
[1:11:27] but if you've got the spirit then what
[1:11:28] is it doing it's filling the vessel for
[1:11:31] use now
[1:11:32] because otherwise you get into issues
[1:11:34] remember the the the the the scripture
[1:11:36] talks about what a spirit or demon will
[1:11:38] leave a man and go out and seek around
[1:11:40] for a little while then it comes back
[1:11:42] and it finds the whole place cleaned up
[1:11:44] but nothing filling it
[1:11:46] and that's what happens when you get
[1:11:47] Sanctified but you don't get filled is
[1:11:49] you're ready for service and then
[1:11:51] something will come and use you
[1:11:52] eventually if God doesn't fill it up
[1:11:53] that's why you need the new birth that's
[1:11:55] why you need the holy spirit is your
[1:11:57] life is perfectly set aside and then
[1:12:00] God doesn't do anything with it because
[1:12:02] you haven't pressed forward into the new
[1:12:03] birth
[1:12:04] how frustrating is it to be cleaned for
[1:12:07] service and to have no service to do
[1:12:09] and that's where people end up is they
[1:12:11] only get two two-thirds of the way
[1:12:12] through the three works of Grace and
[1:12:14] they never get filled and so God can't
[1:12:15] ever use them they don't come into
[1:12:17] adoption amen
[1:12:19] this is the law of the spirit of life
[1:12:20] right here
[1:12:22] if you're in the spirit
[1:12:24] he says you're not in the flesh but in
[1:12:26] the spirit if so be that the spirit of
[1:12:27] God dwell in you
[1:12:30] verse 10 says and if Christ be in you
[1:12:32] the body is dead because of spit of sin
[1:12:35] but the spirit is life because of
[1:12:37] righteousness that's why we need a
[1:12:38] glorified body because this one can't do
[1:12:40] it
[1:12:41] it can have God inside but it can't it
[1:12:44] can't be fully defeated it's born in sin
[1:12:46] shaped in iniquity iniquity come to the
[1:12:48] world speaking lies so you need
[1:12:50] something to change and so this body's
[1:12:52] got to be glorified it's got to be
[1:12:53] changed back into the way it was
[1:12:55] supposed to be but everything else in
[1:12:56] your life can be subject to the Holy
[1:12:58] Spirit and fully Victorious according to
[1:13:00] the word of God Amen he says here in
[1:13:02] verse 11 but if the spirit of him that
[1:13:05] raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in
[1:13:07] you he that raised up Christ from the
[1:13:09] dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[1:13:12] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[1:13:13] you that doesn't give us an excuse see
[1:13:16] see we think well this body this is this
[1:13:18] is a body of Flesh it's it's condemned
[1:13:20] there's no good thing in it no no he
[1:13:22] says listen he can still Quicken it he
[1:13:25] can still make it live according to the
[1:13:26] word he can still make it live according
[1:13:28] to the will and purpose of God but
[1:13:30] you've got to have a new birth for this
[1:13:31] to happen you can't do it on your own
[1:13:33] discipline won't get you to what he's
[1:13:35] talking about here discipline won't
[1:13:37] raise you from the dead
[1:13:39] good luck with that one you imagine
[1:13:42] trying to raise yourself from the dead
[1:13:43] by discipline and yet we do it all day
[1:13:45] long in our spiritual life
[1:13:47] I I'm speaking personally here now
[1:13:49] guess what discipline doesn't work
[1:13:52] against Satan
[1:13:54] listen he's got all the time in the
[1:13:56] world he's got all the he's got all the
[1:13:58] weapons in the world he's got all the
[1:14:00] experience in the world and I've only
[1:14:02] got 43 years of it and my discipline has
[1:14:04] a relatively short fuse compared to
[1:14:06] somebody that's had six thousand years
[1:14:07] to work on it he's going to beat me at
[1:14:09] discipline because he can outweigh me
[1:14:12] he cannot wait me he doesn't care
[1:14:14] I'm the one that gets caught up in those
[1:14:16] things discipline isn't going to raise
[1:14:18] me from the dead and discipline isn't
[1:14:19] going to make me spiritual either what
[1:14:21] does is it can facilitate that's all it
[1:14:24] is that's why you have to have your
[1:14:26] devotions that's why you need to read
[1:14:27] your Bible and pray is that you're
[1:14:29] facilitating something for God to use in
[1:14:30] your life but that doesn't make you a
[1:14:32] Christian that allows God Access into
[1:14:34] your life it shows that you're serious
[1:14:35] about what he wants to do amen
[1:14:39] sanctification is clean with purpose but
[1:14:41] you've got to get into the place where
[1:14:42] you can be used for purpose
[1:14:44] brother Bob says and now we want to see
[1:14:46] what we should do in return
[1:14:49] now in returns when Jesus died at
[1:14:51] Calvary on Calvary that day he not only
[1:14:53] paid the price for our sins but he also
[1:14:55] paid the price and made a way that we
[1:14:57] could follow him
[1:14:59] for we as the Fallen atoms that has been
[1:15:01] redeemed
[1:15:02] and as the Spirit Led Adam the first
[1:15:04] Adam by the spirit and had control of
[1:15:06] all nature then we the second atoms or
[1:15:09] the men of earth has been redeemed by
[1:15:10] Christ from the day of Calvary can
[1:15:12] follow him now when he died at Calvary
[1:15:15] he made a way
[1:15:17] he gave up the spirit the Holy Spirit
[1:15:19] and sent it back to the Earth for you
[1:15:22] and I to live by that's what Calvary
[1:15:24] means to us to follow him see the world
[1:15:27] is preaching Calvary means your sins are
[1:15:29] forgiven
[1:15:30] Prophet says no no no it's so you can
[1:15:32] follow him he gave up his place so you
[1:15:34] could come back to yours you've got to
[1:15:36] follow him and come the way he did and
[1:15:38] walk the way he did and live the way he
[1:15:40] did so you can have the same end result
[1:15:42] in the same and and the same reward that
[1:15:44] he did
[1:15:45] amen
[1:15:47] if we look at Hebrews 10
[1:15:50] because otherwise what happens
[1:15:52] is is we end up with a clean life
[1:15:54] but an empty life
[1:15:57] and that's unfulfilled
[1:15:59] that's a horrible place to have every
[1:16:01] good intention
[1:16:03] and yet no result
[1:16:05] and that's where we end up if we don't
[1:16:07] get filled
[1:16:09] is it's an empty life because God can't
[1:16:11] take you all the way
[1:16:13] Hebrews 10 verse 12 says but this man
[1:16:15] after he had offered one sacrifice for
[1:16:17] sins forever sat down on the right hand
[1:16:19] of God from henceforth expecting until
[1:16:22] his enemies be made his footstool for by
[1:16:25] one offering he hath perfected forever
[1:16:28] them that are Sanctified past tense
[1:16:31] perfected past tense Sanctified this is
[1:16:34] the finished work
[1:16:36] it has a purpose to take you just beyond
[1:16:39] saving you but it's taking you now into
[1:16:40] a place where you're fit for service
[1:16:42] amen and you can't add to it or take
[1:16:44] away from it it's his work from start to
[1:16:46] finish brother Brown would say this he
[1:16:48] said the price that was paid
[1:16:50] or said the price was paid and the
[1:16:52] bondage of Satan was broke God could put
[1:16:54] back into the hands of man a way back to
[1:16:57] what he was looking for
[1:17:01] if you're happy where you're at then
[1:17:02] this isn't for you remember
[1:17:04] you've got to be looking for something
[1:17:06] more
[1:17:07] because if you're looking for something
[1:17:09] more that means there is more and that's
[1:17:10] what he's talking to he's talking about
[1:17:12] those that say there's got to be more
[1:17:14] than where I'm at today I believe that I
[1:17:16] believe there's more than where I'm at
[1:17:18] today
[1:17:19] he says he had to weep no more hit when
[1:17:22] he broke the backbone of Satan there at
[1:17:23] Calvary he broke the backbone of sin and
[1:17:25] of sickness and it brings every Mortal
[1:17:28] being on the earth back into the
[1:17:30] presence of God with sins forgiven
[1:17:32] hallelujah our sins are forgiven no more
[1:17:35] can Satan block us off from God
[1:17:37] so what holds us back from God then
[1:17:39] church
[1:17:40] if Satan can't do it then somebody else
[1:17:42] has to be doing it and it's usually
[1:17:44] right here
[1:17:45] we refuse to go in
[1:17:47] either by shame
[1:17:49] or Pride
[1:17:51] either we're we're we're so caught up in
[1:17:54] how bad we've done that we say he won't
[1:17:56] accept me or we're so caught up in how
[1:17:58] good we do we say we don't need anything
[1:18:00] else
[1:18:01] that's the only two things keep us out
[1:18:02] but a humble heart will go in time and
[1:18:04] time and time again regardless of how
[1:18:06] good or how bad they're doing in their
[1:18:07] life amen
[1:18:09] he says what there's a highway made
[1:18:12] there's a telephone sitting there
[1:18:14] there's a line to Glory brings every
[1:18:16] person in reach of that line if a man is
[1:18:19] full of sin it connected him in on
[1:18:21] Central we don't understand this these
[1:18:23] these terms today but in the old days
[1:18:25] when brother Brown was talking about
[1:18:26] this you had to place a call to a
[1:18:29] central telephone area and they would
[1:18:31] physically connect the line that you
[1:18:33] were on to the line of the person that
[1:18:35] you wanted to talk to and usually they
[1:18:37] listened in as well
[1:18:38] but they had to physically connect the
[1:18:40] lines now everything's done uh digitally
[1:18:42] you don't have to have somebody sitting
[1:18:43] there and physically doing it but they
[1:18:44] have people literally sitting there and
[1:18:46] their job was to connect telephones
[1:18:47] sister Brenda's naughty
[1:18:49] wow
[1:18:55] that's what he's saying he's saying
[1:18:57] there's a telephone sitting there and
[1:18:58] there's somebody waiting to connect your
[1:19:00] line to his Ching talk to him directly
[1:19:03] he says he can be forgiven of that sin
[1:19:06] not only that he says but that sin is
[1:19:09] paid for oh you don't have to say I'm
[1:19:12] not worthy sure you're not you never
[1:19:14] could be but a worthy one took your
[1:19:16] place you are free you don't have to
[1:19:20] wander anymore you don't have to be a
[1:19:22] pleasure-seeking man out here on the
[1:19:23] Earth
[1:19:25] isn't that what the Earth is chasing
[1:19:26] these days pleasure pleasure pleasure
[1:19:29] everything they're trying to relax
[1:19:31] they're trying to to have some enjoyment
[1:19:33] in this this world that's so chaotic and
[1:19:35] so fallen and so messed up everybody's
[1:19:37] just trying to have a good time because
[1:19:38] they're so stressed out and so neurotic
[1:19:40] in every other way
[1:19:42] he says but there is a fountain filled
[1:19:44] with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins
[1:19:46] where Sinners plunge beneath the flood
[1:19:49] lose all their guilty stain you don't
[1:19:51] have to be lost there is a Highway and a
[1:19:54] way and it's called the way of Holiness
[1:19:57] the unclean don't pass over it
[1:20:00] for he comes what he the unclean
[1:20:04] all of us
[1:20:05] the unclean comes through the fountain
[1:20:08] first and then he enters the highway he
[1:20:11] broke the powers of Satan he opened the
[1:20:13] prison doors of Hell to every man that
[1:20:15] was shut up in this earth in the prisons
[1:20:16] fearing that when he died what death
[1:20:19] would be to him on Calvary he opened
[1:20:22] those cell doors let every captive Go
[1:20:24] free you don't have to no longer be torn
[1:20:27] bound down by sin
[1:20:29] you don't have to no longer yield your
[1:20:31] members to sin drinking smoking gambling
[1:20:33] telling lies you can be honest just and
[1:20:37] upright and Satan can do nothing about
[1:20:39] it because you've got a hold of a line a
[1:20:42] Lifeline that's anchored in the Rock of
[1:20:43] Ages nothing can shake you from it no
[1:20:46] winds can shake you no nothing not even
[1:20:49] death itself can separate us from the
[1:20:51] love of God that's in Christ Jesus
[1:20:52] that's what Calvary meant
[1:20:55] because so many people they stop and say
[1:20:57] my sins are forgiven but they're not
[1:20:59] changed brother Branham is pointing to
[1:21:00] the scripture where it says there's a
[1:21:02] there's a way and then there's a highway
[1:21:04] and in the way is a way called holy in
[1:21:06] the middle of the road is one that's
[1:21:07] called holy and you're called to live
[1:21:09] that
[1:21:10] that means there's got to be a change
[1:21:12] like he says you got to come through a
[1:21:13] fountain
[1:21:14] you got to be washed
[1:21:16] and you got to be filled
[1:21:18] he says that's what Calvary meant
[1:21:22] not just to pay the debt but it was to
[1:21:23] take you into a way and a road always
[1:21:26] leads to somewhere there is no Road to
[1:21:27] Nowhere
[1:21:29] not on this Bible
[1:21:30] it's going to take you somewhere and
[1:21:32] it's either to life or it's going to
[1:21:33] take you to death
[1:21:35] he says men that were in bondage were
[1:21:38] set free men that were once under fear
[1:21:40] of death can no longer fear death a man
[1:21:43] who Longs for a city whose Builder and
[1:21:46] maker God he can step on the highway and
[1:21:48] set his face towards heaven because he's
[1:21:51] free Hallelujah he is redeemed he don't
[1:21:54] need to wander no more for there is a
[1:21:56] way of knowing whether you're right or
[1:21:58] not he said God gives us life our sins
[1:22:01] are gone that day at Calvary pay the
[1:22:03] price we sing that song you ask me why
[1:22:06] I'm happy and I'll just tell you why
[1:22:08] it's because my sins are gone and then
[1:22:10] he's taken me beyond my sins are gone
[1:22:13] and he's helped me to live above that
[1:22:14] place of sin he's helped me to live
[1:22:16] above my mind he's helped me to live
[1:22:18] above my flesh and he's giving me
[1:22:19] Victory along a way that is called holy
[1:22:21] because I'm wrapped in his Robes of
[1:22:23] righteousness now amen it's a different
[1:22:25] person I've come through a fountain full
[1:22:27] of blood and it's washed me clean and
[1:22:29] the washing of the word as I'm sitting
[1:22:31] in church and I'm listening and I'm
[1:22:32] reading my Bible I'm in the presence of
[1:22:34] God it starts to wash away the filth
[1:22:36] that I'm getting day to day
[1:22:38] and so I can keep walking on that
[1:22:40] Highway and I'm drawing closer and
[1:22:41] closer to the end goalie man
[1:22:45] Hebrews 10 as we continue says where
[1:22:47] whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness
[1:22:50] to us for after that he had said before
[1:22:52] this is the Covenant that I will make
[1:22:54] with them after those days saith the
[1:22:56] Lord so catch us now
[1:22:58] we talked about the law of sin and death
[1:23:01] and then he talks about the law of the
[1:23:02] spirit of life and now he tells us what
[1:23:05] that looks like
[1:23:06] this is the new law now this is the new
[1:23:08] way it's a contract it's a commitment
[1:23:10] it's a covenant to us he says this is
[1:23:12] the Covenant I will make I will put my
[1:23:15] laws into their hearts and in their
[1:23:18] minds I will write them
[1:23:21] who does that work
[1:23:22] do you see Jonathan curlette's name as
[1:23:25] an action in that verse anywhere
[1:23:27] nowhere
[1:23:28] he'll do the writing he's the one that's
[1:23:31] going to put it in my heart he's the one
[1:23:33] that's going to make me live the life
[1:23:35] because I failed so often but when he
[1:23:37] makes it a part of me then I can't deny
[1:23:39] it anymore
[1:23:41] listen remember brother Brown would say
[1:23:43] I drink as much as I want to drink so do
[1:23:45] I I gamble as much as I gamble
[1:23:48] I lie as much as I lie I waste time as
[1:23:51] much as I want to waste time why because
[1:23:53] he's writing something in my life that's
[1:23:55] pulsating out of me that's pushing out
[1:23:57] of me and it's bringing the flesh unto
[1:23:59] subjection and that's why I can live the
[1:24:02] life the way I do now because he's
[1:24:03] written something in here that I
[1:24:05] couldn't write myself
[1:24:06] we tried to do that that's what they
[1:24:08] literally did in the old days they have
[1:24:10] the phylacteries you know and they put
[1:24:11] it on their heads they write the law and
[1:24:12] they put it on their head thinking that
[1:24:14] somehow made them spiritual didn't do
[1:24:15] them any good
[1:24:17] you can't do the writing that's required
[1:24:19] to do this but when he writes it on your
[1:24:20] heart now then you can't get away from
[1:24:22] it and it's engraved it's engrafted into
[1:24:24] you and it's just something that's
[1:24:25] living out of you amen
[1:24:27] he's not taking us away from the laws
[1:24:31] he's putting the laws into us
[1:24:33] the laws were always external and you're
[1:24:35] always always trying to work unto them
[1:24:37] but now he says no what I need done what
[1:24:40] I want them to do I'm going to put it
[1:24:41] inside of them so it's a desire inside
[1:24:43] of them
[1:24:45] not just a desire to do it but a desire
[1:24:47] to be it it is them it's inside of them
[1:24:50] he says and they can't do it themselves
[1:24:51] I've got to put that desire inside of
[1:24:53] them I gotta put that will I've got to
[1:24:55] put that fight inside of them that would
[1:24:57] war against the Flesh and hold it off
[1:24:59] and win the victory ultimately amen this
[1:25:01] is living laws not legalities
[1:25:04] it's a Living Word inside of us that's
[1:25:06] what the manifestation of the sons of
[1:25:08] God is and the daughters of God is it's
[1:25:10] a Living Word inside of you and you
[1:25:12] can't stop it
[1:25:13] that's why when you do something wrong
[1:25:15] you get convicted and somebody else
[1:25:17] doesn't it's because it's a law in your
[1:25:18] heart not just something in your head
[1:25:21] and you immediately have to go make it
[1:25:23] right because it puts a separation
[1:25:25] between you and the presence of God
[1:25:26] because you have what you've
[1:25:28] contradicted the very life that's inside
[1:25:30] of you
[1:25:32] it's a beautiful thing when you say I'm
[1:25:34] not where I'm supposed to be because it
[1:25:36] means that he's writing something in
[1:25:38] your heart
[1:25:39] and it's convicting you and it's telling
[1:25:41] you you're a child of God and there's a
[1:25:43] higher plane and there's a place of
[1:25:44] Victory and there's a place of
[1:25:45] overcoming in your life
[1:25:48] verse 17 says so he says I'll put my law
[1:25:51] on their hearts and in their minds will
[1:25:52] I write them listen to this and their
[1:25:54] sins and iniquities will I remember no
[1:25:56] more
[1:25:57] you know what your part here is you have
[1:26:00] sins and you have iniquities
[1:26:01] you know his part is forget all about it
[1:26:05] you're gonna have sins
[1:26:07] you had sins you had iniquities you're
[1:26:10] going to have iniquities he says I won't
[1:26:11] remember them anymore
[1:26:13] you're under a New Covenant now
[1:26:15] I'm not going to push you down I'm not
[1:26:16] going to hold you down because of this
[1:26:17] I'm going to make a change in your life
[1:26:19] I'm going to make a living word inside
[1:26:21] of you he says now where remission of
[1:26:23] these is there is no more offering for
[1:26:25] sin it was a one-time atonement as we
[1:26:27] preached over the last two Services it
[1:26:28] was an eternal atonement when Christ
[1:26:30] paid for our sins so he says he went in
[1:26:31] once and it's done completely finished
[1:26:33] it's a finished work
[1:26:35] he says now having therefore Brethren
[1:26:37] boldness to enter into the holiest by
[1:26:40] the blood of Jesus where is the holiest
[1:26:42] that is the very presence of God he says
[1:26:44] having boldness to enter into the
[1:26:46] presence of God how by a New and Living
[1:26:49] Way which he had consecrated for us
[1:26:52] through the veil that is to say his
[1:26:55] flesh so he says Paul says there's a new
[1:26:57] way and it's a living way it's not
[1:26:59] morality now it's life
[1:27:01] it's not just doing good it's being good
[1:27:05] it's not just acting like God it is
[1:27:07] being God
[1:27:09] that's what we're looking for
[1:27:11] that's what we're looking for in our
[1:27:12] lives amen it's not laws for death and
[1:27:14] punishment but it's a word inside you
[1:27:16] that makes you live because it's written
[1:27:17] on you and you can't escape it he says
[1:27:20] in having a high priest over the house
[1:27:22] of God let us draw near
[1:27:24] with a True Heart in full Assurance of
[1:27:28] faith meaning Lord I believe that you've
[1:27:30] made a way I believe that the blood is
[1:27:33] still there and it still works even for
[1:27:35] me that's the full Assurance you have is
[1:27:38] that he promised there's a way made so
[1:27:39] you're coming the way he said to come
[1:27:42] having a True Heart in full Assurance
[1:27:45] sincerity honestly humbly
[1:27:48] having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[1:27:51] conscience and our bodies washed with
[1:27:54] pure heart with pure water what's he
[1:27:56] saying don't hold back that's
[1:27:57] condemnation he says if you're convicted
[1:28:00] come in with full assurance that the
[1:28:01] forgiveness is already there and all you
[1:28:03] have to do is say your story
[1:28:06] come there knowing that he's going to
[1:28:07] make the change that you're looking for
[1:28:09] in your life amen
[1:28:12] come back and say I want restoration I
[1:28:15] want full Redemption
[1:28:17] we only have an Earnest in the Holy
[1:28:18] Spirit we ought to be crying out saying
[1:28:19] Lord give me there give me everything
[1:28:21] take us off this planet take us off this
[1:28:24] Earth take us into a new place where we
[1:28:26] don't have to fight this way anymore
[1:28:27] what's Paul saying take this New
[1:28:29] Covenant and live by that apply it live
[1:28:33] by that Covenant as tightly as they did
[1:28:34] under the law
[1:28:36] because this one has a way different
[1:28:37] effect
[1:28:38] he says in verse 23 let us hold fast the
[1:28:42] profession of our faith without faith
[1:28:44] wavering for he is faithful that
[1:28:47] promised
[1:28:48] so Paul's talking about a covenant now
[1:28:50] but this is not a new covenant
[1:28:53] this is the Covenant of Abraham if you
[1:28:55] remember
[1:28:55] because Abraham's Covenant was not
[1:28:58] Abraham if you do this then I'll do that
[1:29:01] Abraham if you live a perfect life then
[1:29:02] I'll give you the son
[1:29:04] Sarah if you always say the right thing
[1:29:06] then you'll bear the promised child no
[1:29:08] no no what was the Covenant I will
[1:29:11] I will I will I will I will write my
[1:29:16] words in their heart I will do this I
[1:29:19] will do that and where we left
[1:29:21] accepting it
[1:29:23] not fighting it
[1:29:25] and not holding us back from the very
[1:29:27] thing that he told us to do amen that's
[1:29:29] the Covenant that we always wanted
[1:29:31] that's the Covenant we always wanted it
[1:29:32] and they gave it up when they what they
[1:29:34] said don't talk to us face to face God
[1:29:36] sent it through a prophet God had to
[1:29:37] send laws then
[1:29:39] but now he comes back he says no no
[1:29:40] let's go back to the abrahamic way where
[1:29:42] I can talk to you face to face
[1:29:44] didn't that isn't that what he did to
[1:29:45] Abraham came down face to face didn't he
[1:29:48] gave him a promise and then he fulfilled
[1:29:49] a promise that's the Covenant we're
[1:29:51] looking at is what the supernatural
[1:29:53] presence of God in your life to bring to
[1:29:55] pass the very word that he gave you in
[1:29:57] the first place he starts it and then he
[1:29:59] comes in and he fulfills it inside of
[1:30:00] your life amen listen
[1:30:03] God said I will do this to Abraham and
[1:30:07] none of it was dependent on Abraham
[1:30:10] you know how I know that
[1:30:11] because the Bible tells us
[1:30:13] Abraham messed up time and time and time
[1:30:16] again
[1:30:17] he didn't leave his family and then his
[1:30:19] father father-in-law died and then he
[1:30:21] left arm went on with lot and that
[1:30:23] caused him problems and that put that
[1:30:25] that nephew into bondage then he had to
[1:30:27] go rescue that then he went out and then
[1:30:29] he he gave his wife away the first time
[1:30:32] the wife of Promise by the way gave her
[1:30:34] way and then what did God come do backed
[1:30:36] him up
[1:30:38] said you're a dead man if you marry that
[1:30:40] man's wife
[1:30:41] Lord you know I'm a righteous man
[1:30:43] doesn't matter you're dead
[1:30:45] why because I will do it
[1:30:48] you're under a covenant Abraham doesn't
[1:30:50] matter what you do I'm gonna do it
[1:30:51] Abraham
[1:30:52] comes back in cleans his act up God
[1:30:55] comes and visits him personally in his
[1:30:57] tent
[1:30:59] and then Abraham goes right back out and
[1:31:00] gives his wife away again
[1:31:05] if you're struggling today
[1:31:06] it's not going to stop God
[1:31:09] that's what I'm trying to tell you your
[1:31:11] faults your failures your flaws your
[1:31:13] genetics where you're at doesn't matter
[1:31:15] it doesn't stop God Amen
[1:31:18] God backed up Abraham time and time
[1:31:20] again even when Abraham was in the wrong
[1:31:23] because every time Abraham came back
[1:31:25] around and went back to the promised
[1:31:26] land
[1:31:28] that's how you know if you're a Son of
[1:31:29] God is you keep coming back to the
[1:31:31] promise
[1:31:32] that's how you know you're a daughter of
[1:31:33] God as you keep coming back to the
[1:31:34] promise doesn't mean you never leave it
[1:31:36] you never fail you never fall down but
[1:31:38] you keep coming back and Abraham by
[1:31:41] faith called things that were not as
[1:31:42] though they were all the way to the end
[1:31:44] until he got what it was that he was
[1:31:46] looking for amen
[1:31:48] brother Brown says now we find out after
[1:31:49] this dispensation that it lasted on that
[1:31:52] legalistic dispensation until the real
[1:31:54] Royal seed come then he took all the
[1:31:57] legalism upon himself and paid the price
[1:31:58] of redemption and God's church is back
[1:32:01] in Grace again Hallelujah he says not
[1:32:04] under the law and legalism it's under
[1:32:06] grace and what does that look like and
[1:32:08] the promise of God the true Seed of
[1:32:10] Abraham he took the law upon himself and
[1:32:13] the law nailed him to the cross of what
[1:32:15] we must do this is what he nailed listen
[1:32:17] up
[1:32:18] he nailed to the cross what we must do
[1:32:21] and must not do and must do and must not
[1:32:25] do
[1:32:27] listen carefully now this is there's
[1:32:28] depth to this
[1:32:30] he says you know the thing of it today
[1:32:31] when a sinner comes to the Lord we don't
[1:32:33] treat them like Paul did when the
[1:32:35] Philippian Jailer said what must I do to
[1:32:36] be saved
[1:32:37] what do we say You must do you must not
[1:32:40] do you must do you must not do stop
[1:32:43] drinking stop smoking stop watching TV
[1:32:45] stop going out here stop doing this
[1:32:46] that's what he's saying Christ nailed
[1:32:48] that to the cross
[1:32:50] it's not that our conduct doesn't matter
[1:32:53] it does listen there's no peace in the
[1:32:55] Middle East because of Abraham it's all
[1:32:57] his fault all his fault
[1:33:00] but that didn't stop the promise but
[1:33:03] there is a consequence to our actions
[1:33:04] God didn't say we wouldn't pay he said
[1:33:06] we would but he'll still fulfill his
[1:33:09] word regardless
[1:33:11] now listen to this he says what would we
[1:33:13] say today you got to quit smoking you
[1:33:14] got to quit drinking you got to quit
[1:33:16] doing this that wasn't what he asked he
[1:33:18] said what must I do to be saved
[1:33:22] and Paul told him believe on the Lord
[1:33:24] Jesus Christ believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:33:27] Christ not come join our congregation
[1:33:29] stand up before the church and say this
[1:33:31] and we'll sprinkle you immerse you or
[1:33:32] whatever you want to do our way and if
[1:33:34] you're not in our church then
[1:33:36] he says that wasn't it he said just
[1:33:39] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:33:41] thou and thy house shall be saved he
[1:33:44] told him he had to what believe on the
[1:33:46] Lord Jesus Christ he had to repent and
[1:33:48] he had to be baptized and he did all of
[1:33:49] those things
[1:33:50] but he didn't say now you get out there
[1:33:52] and you clean up your life right away
[1:33:53] mister
[1:33:54] because that's what legalism you must do
[1:33:57] you must not do listen
[1:33:59] if I know a brother's doing something he
[1:34:01] ought not to do I'll tell him that he
[1:34:03] shouldn't do it for the sake of saving
[1:34:05] him some pain but that's not going to
[1:34:07] make him a Son of God and it's not going
[1:34:09] to make him change for the rest of his
[1:34:10] life if he wants to do it he's going to
[1:34:12] do it
[1:34:13] that's just the way it is
[1:34:15] sometimes we hurt them by forcing them
[1:34:17] to do something before God has put a
[1:34:19] revelation in their heart and put the
[1:34:20] change inside of them
[1:34:22] that's what went on in the message so
[1:34:23] long is that we reformed our young
[1:34:25] people and then when they came to a test
[1:34:27] and they failed it they just fell away
[1:34:28] that's it not everyone of course
[1:34:31] everybody's got to come their way and in
[1:34:32] their time and the Lord knows these
[1:34:33] things but we can't what we can't force
[1:34:36] them into a way of life
[1:34:38] it is life
[1:34:40] and you've got to have life inside of
[1:34:41] you and they've got to have that
[1:34:42] individually for themselves
[1:34:45] brother Brown continues he says if you
[1:34:46] can believe for yourself you can believe
[1:34:49] for your house also have enough faith in
[1:34:51] God to believe for yourself then believe
[1:34:53] for your children also that same faith
[1:34:56] will save your children that saved you
[1:34:58] if you just keep praying God will answer
[1:35:01] prayer don't worry
[1:35:04] isn't that where we're at as as parents
[1:35:06] today
[1:35:07] we want our kids to have the same
[1:35:08] assurance that we have
[1:35:10] but we've got to let them come the way
[1:35:12] we came and that's by a new birth not by
[1:35:14] cracking the shell of the egg
[1:35:16] they've got to go through the hard
[1:35:18] things themselves
[1:35:19] we're there to support we're there to
[1:35:20] set an atmosphere we're there to set an
[1:35:22] example but they got to be born they got
[1:35:24] to be born we can't legalize them into a
[1:35:27] new birth
[1:35:29] he says just ask him and believe it and
[1:35:32] get it anchored in your heart just keep
[1:35:35] moving on that's the way it's done it's
[1:35:38] too late Brother John
[1:35:40] they've gone so far
[1:35:43] they're religious
[1:35:45] how many parents in the message are
[1:35:47] dealing with religious children today
[1:35:49] and you look at them and they're in
[1:35:50] church and yet you know they don't have
[1:35:51] the new birth yet that's as bad as them
[1:35:53] being out almost
[1:35:56] because what it can it can it can kind
[1:35:59] of help with their conscience they think
[1:36:01] they're in the right place and they're
[1:36:02] doing the right thing but they need that
[1:36:03] new birth
[1:36:04] or then you say brother John they're so
[1:36:06] far out
[1:36:07] so far gone
[1:36:09] can't do it it's too late we're too
[1:36:11] close to the end how can you give them a
[1:36:13] new birth this late in the game listen
[1:36:15] this was Abraham with Isaac okay
[1:36:17] the knife was he was putting everything
[1:36:20] he had into it to come down and stab his
[1:36:24] son
[1:36:25] and as it came down God stopped his hand
[1:36:28] and provided a lamp
[1:36:30] that lamb wasn't there when he was here
[1:36:32] that lamb appeared when he was right
[1:36:34] here
[1:36:35] God hasn't worked out to the second
[1:36:38] for his children
[1:36:41] he's Jehovah Jireh that Ram was not
[1:36:44] there when he started that stroke and
[1:36:47] then as soon as it came down he said
[1:36:49] hold Abraham for I know now that you
[1:36:52] love me
[1:36:54] you did what I asked you to do even to
[1:36:57] the what sacrificing of your child
[1:37:00] he says but I've made a way I provided
[1:37:03] something
[1:37:05] sometimes we're sitting there we're
[1:37:06] saying it's so late
[1:37:08] it's so late Lord
[1:37:10] it's so late how are you gonna get it
[1:37:12] done
[1:37:13] listen he's a supernatural God he can
[1:37:16] speak things into existence he can speak
[1:37:18] things out of existence we are telling a
[1:37:20] story to someone recently and it was
[1:37:21] back in Louisiana
[1:37:23] there was a sister who was on a
[1:37:24] Wednesday night and she came up for
[1:37:26] prayer for her brother that was not
[1:37:28] serving the lord and some of you know
[1:37:29] him
[1:37:30] and she came up for prayer
[1:37:33] and she was saying it's getting so late
[1:37:36] it's getting so late he needs to come to
[1:37:38] the Lord
[1:37:39] and that back home her brother was in
[1:37:42] bed in his pajamas and woke up and
[1:37:45] thought the Rapture had happened
[1:37:47] and he came running to the church in his
[1:37:49] pajamas to see if they were still there
[1:37:51] and they were and he came up and he gave
[1:37:54] his life to the Lord that service
[1:37:58] Jehovah Jireh listen he can move from
[1:38:01] anywhere he can pull from any place
[1:38:04] listen whether they're out with the pigs
[1:38:06] or whether they're in the church pew it
[1:38:07] matters not when he calls they're going
[1:38:09] to come and then when they come to their
[1:38:10] senses he'll reach out and he'll bring
[1:38:12] them back amen
[1:38:14] God's got it all worked out
[1:38:16] amen
[1:38:18] he says now we find that Abraham was
[1:38:20] just an ordinary man
[1:38:22] God called him and said that through him
[1:38:24] he was going to make him a father of
[1:38:26] Nations no matter what you do Abraham
[1:38:28] you don't have to do one thing I have
[1:38:33] done it
[1:38:34] he says Oh I like that oh I love that so
[1:38:37] well it sure Thrills my heart to think
[1:38:39] it's nothing I could do for or against
[1:38:44] if there was anything I could do I'd
[1:38:47] never get it but it's what he's done for
[1:38:49] me not what I am what he is it ain't
[1:38:52] what my promise is it's what his promise
[1:38:55] is that's the new way churches this is
[1:38:57] not it's a new law it's the law of Grace
[1:38:59] not to Grace to do whatever you want but
[1:39:02] Grace that gets you to want to be in his
[1:39:05] will and plan and purpose
[1:39:07] that's the grace is that when you don't
[1:39:09] want it he put something inside of you
[1:39:11] that wants to do it anyways that while
[1:39:13] you're yet in sin while you're at yet in
[1:39:15] trespasses while you're yet failures and
[1:39:17] flawed and all these different things
[1:39:18] that in there he puts in you a desire
[1:39:21] that pulls you into the very presence of
[1:39:23] God under the preaching of the word
[1:39:25] under the hearing of the word and what
[1:39:27] does it do it takes you and it breaks
[1:39:29] you down and you do it willingly it
[1:39:32] molds you and you do it willingly you
[1:39:34] give up your your mind you give up your
[1:39:36] ego you give up your ambition you gave
[1:39:38] up your desires you gave up your skills
[1:39:40] you gave up your education all of it to
[1:39:42] him willingly why buy Grace
[1:39:45] he's the one that called no man can call
[1:39:47] except the father calls him first and
[1:39:49] he's calling to us and that Grace To Us
[1:39:51] allows us to say Abba Father
[1:39:54] I'm your child and I'm coming to you
[1:39:56] amen does your conduct matter yes I'm
[1:39:59] not giving us a free card here today I I
[1:40:02] do anything you want to get out of jail
[1:40:04] no it has consequences
[1:40:06] everything we do has consequences and we
[1:40:08] can see the scars in our life we can see
[1:40:10] the scars in our families lives and our
[1:40:12] marriages and our children and and all
[1:40:13] the churches even
[1:40:15] of all the bad decisions we made and
[1:40:17] there is a price to pay and guess what
[1:40:18] the innocent pay
[1:40:20] they always do right but that doesn't
[1:40:23] mean he's not going to do what he said
[1:40:25] he was going to do he's still going to
[1:40:26] do it amen
[1:40:29] but we're under a covenant that is
[1:40:31] called the law of the spirit of life and
[1:40:33] God says I'm going to make it happen
[1:40:34] despite what you do
[1:40:37] but he says I really wish you'd work
[1:40:39] with me
[1:40:40] and that's what he's wanting he wants
[1:40:42] people that'll work with him
[1:40:43] to not be fighting it but he says even
[1:40:45] if you don't I'm still going to do what
[1:40:46] I said I was going to do this isn't
[1:40:48] based on your conduct it's based on me
[1:40:51] and I'm not a man that I should lie
[1:40:53] he says I'm going to do what I said I
[1:40:55] was going to do he says and all I'm
[1:40:57] doing now is working to get you realize
[1:40:58] what I'm trying to do in your life so
[1:41:00] you'll get out of my way and start
[1:41:02] working with me rather than working
[1:41:03] against me
[1:41:05] Ephesians 1 says blessed be the God and
[1:41:08] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who had
[1:41:10] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[1:41:12] in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:41:14] according as he had chosen Us in him
[1:41:16] we're talking about the law a New and
[1:41:18] Living Way a law of Grace a law the
[1:41:20] spirit of life according as he had
[1:41:22] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[1:41:24] of the world that we should be holy and
[1:41:26] Without Blame before him in love before
[1:41:29] the world was ever created he says I've
[1:41:31] chosen the people that's going to walk
[1:41:32] before me
[1:41:33] having predestinated us unto the
[1:41:36] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:41:38] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:41:40] of what his will his will was ever
[1:41:44] before I came into existence in this
[1:41:45] world his will will stand because his
[1:41:48] word is his will
[1:41:49] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[1:41:51] wherein he had made us accepted in the
[1:41:53] Beloved in whom we have Redemption
[1:41:55] through his blood the Forgiveness of
[1:41:57] sins according to the riches of his
[1:41:59] grace Hallelujah
[1:42:00] but that's not it
[1:42:02] that's a start
[1:42:04] what comes after that he says wherein
[1:42:06] here the bounded toward us in all wisdom
[1:42:08] and prudence
[1:42:10] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:42:12] his will according to his good pleasure
[1:42:14] which he had purposed in himself and
[1:42:16] he's shown us the mystery of his will
[1:42:18] amen not just to save us but there's
[1:42:20] more to it that in the dispensation of
[1:42:22] the fullness of times he might to gather
[1:42:24] together in one all things in Christ
[1:42:26] both which are in heaven and which are
[1:42:28] on earth even in him when's the fullness
[1:42:31] of the end of times right now
[1:42:33] that's it we're at the end of the
[1:42:35] seventh age there's nothing left for
[1:42:37] Gentiles this is the dispensation of the
[1:42:39] fullness of time we're in it so there's
[1:42:41] a gathering together in one now in
[1:42:42] Christ that ought to be happening and I
[1:42:44] believe it is happening
[1:42:46] where we're taking out the big eyes and
[1:42:48] we're filling it with a bunch of little
[1:42:49] views
[1:42:50] that's what I see happening amen so it's
[1:42:53] a gathering time
[1:42:55] it's manifesting time
[1:42:58] he said in whom also we have obtained an
[1:43:01] inheritance
[1:43:02] so we have say something waiting for us
[1:43:05] not just what we have now but there's
[1:43:06] more to come
[1:43:07] being predestinated according to the
[1:43:09] purpose of him who worketh all things
[1:43:11] after the counsel of his own will
[1:43:14] so what's the problem church I read that
[1:43:16] and I say whoa
[1:43:18] there's a lot of good stuff he says
[1:43:20] about me right here
[1:43:21] that's a beautiful scripture Ephesians
[1:43:25] you want to get a pick-me-up read
[1:43:26] Ephesians sometime it's only short it's
[1:43:28] only what six chapters you can read that
[1:43:30] through in your devotions no problem
[1:43:31] read it every day about what he says and
[1:43:33] you'll stop looking at who you think you
[1:43:35] are
[1:43:36] stop looking at what the of what Satan's
[1:43:38] trying to tell you you are stop looking
[1:43:40] at your fault start looking at your
[1:43:42] fails and start looking at this where he
[1:43:44] says you're already predestinated unto
[1:43:46] good will
[1:43:47] under good things I've got a purpose for
[1:43:49] you I've got an inheritance for you
[1:43:50] walking that look for that be an
[1:43:53] expectation for that be working towards
[1:43:55] that seek my will so you can be found
[1:43:57] living in the reality of what Ephesians
[1:43:59] is talking about here amen
[1:44:02] it's not just God's will to save us but
[1:44:04] it's God's will to redeem us to take us
[1:44:06] back to our original place and position
[1:44:09] with our lives according to his purpose
[1:44:10] and plan
[1:44:12] that's what we're looking for we don't
[1:44:14] just want to exist
[1:44:17] that's a horrible place
[1:44:19] you live you work you sleep you die
[1:44:23] that's no good
[1:44:25] have a purpose have a reason
[1:44:29] it it really changed my life when I came
[1:44:31] to the ministry because I felt that my
[1:44:34] wife both felt there was more
[1:44:36] there was more we had more to do
[1:44:39] and it's not wrong to sit there and say
[1:44:40] I'm just a mother I'm just a father no
[1:44:42] some of us are called to that
[1:44:44] but if there's something calling for
[1:44:47] more it usually means there's more
[1:44:49] and the idea is not to go out there and
[1:44:51] find it but it's to prayerfully seek it
[1:44:54] remember brother Brown said he said all
[1:44:56] these ministers came to me they said
[1:44:57] we've got the Holy Ghost now do we go
[1:44:59] seeking our gifts
[1:45:00] he said no
[1:45:02] go join a church settle down and wait
[1:45:05] but if there's more in your heart then
[1:45:07] God will do more with you
[1:45:09] but don't go manufacture it
[1:45:12] don't go manufacture it you can't do
[1:45:13] that uh
[1:45:15] I'll leave it
[1:45:17] don't manufacture your walk with Christ
[1:45:21] don't try and build a facade
[1:45:23] don't try and pretend you're more that's
[1:45:25] the first thing I've learned as a
[1:45:27] minister don't pretend you got a gift
[1:45:28] you don't have
[1:45:30] and don't try and put on errors about
[1:45:31] what you think you're supposed to be
[1:45:33] don't try and live a life according to
[1:45:35] what people say you are live a life
[1:45:37] according to what he says you are and
[1:45:39] should be I've had people tell me the
[1:45:41] things that are supposed to be happening
[1:45:42] when you're behind a Pulpit and all I
[1:45:43] say is I'm obviously not there yet
[1:45:45] why would I pretend otherwise
[1:45:48] I have people talking like they can see
[1:45:49] Visions going on all the time and
[1:45:51] swirling demons and I'm like sorry I
[1:45:53] don't see it
[1:45:54] doesn't mean I don't have a gift to
[1:45:55] preach
[1:45:56] but it means I don't see demons and
[1:45:58] spirits swirling around them but if they
[1:45:59] do all more power to them
[1:46:01] hopefully they're using it to edify not
[1:46:03] to lift themselves up but I can't live I
[1:46:05] can't be what I'm not
[1:46:08] but I'm looking for what he says I am
[1:46:10] and living according to that amen
[1:46:14] Galatians 5 says for Brethren ye have
[1:46:17] been called unto Liberty only use not
[1:46:20] Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but
[1:46:22] by love serve one another see this is
[1:46:25] the tendency when you get under a law
[1:46:26] that doesn't require performance that is
[1:46:28] not Performance Based that you say I can
[1:46:30] do whatever I want
[1:46:32] that's the sign of a child of Satan
[1:46:36] because the grace is not given to us for
[1:46:37] Liberty to do whatever we want the grace
[1:46:40] is supposed to be what return back to
[1:46:42] God and say because of what you've done
[1:46:43] I'm going to do everything I can for you
[1:46:45] I'm going to thank you for what you've
[1:46:47] done I'm not trying to repay it I'm just
[1:46:49] trying to thank you I'm just trying to
[1:46:50] be of service to you because of what
[1:46:52] you've done for me he says for all the
[1:46:54] laws fulfilled in one word even in this
[1:46:56] Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:46:59] it's the only law in the law of Grace
[1:47:02] as you've been loved love others as
[1:47:05] you've been treated treat others
[1:47:07] look at what Jesus preached on the on
[1:47:10] the Sermon on the Mount
[1:47:12] what was he preaching there
[1:47:14] die to yourself
[1:47:16] don't try and Bully and push your way
[1:47:18] ahead draw back let the other person
[1:47:20] have it
[1:47:21] turn the other cheek
[1:47:23] be meek
[1:47:25] seek after the things of God not the
[1:47:27] things of the world
[1:47:28] humble yourself
[1:47:30] he says because if you do that you'll
[1:47:32] get the reward on the other side and
[1:47:33] that's really what you want church is
[1:47:35] the reward on the other side not the
[1:47:36] reward that's here but everything he was
[1:47:38] pointing at went to this and it says
[1:47:40] what point them to Christ set yourself
[1:47:43] aside set your flesh aside set your ego
[1:47:45] aside set everything aside that is good
[1:47:48] to you in the flesh so that they can be
[1:47:50] lifted up to Christ
[1:47:51] that they would see that you're not the
[1:47:54] way they are that you don't react the
[1:47:56] way they react you don't think the way
[1:47:57] they think that you don't have the
[1:47:58] priorities they think that that they
[1:48:00] have
[1:48:01] there's a difference there's a contrast
[1:48:02] there and in doing so you can show a
[1:48:04] Life of Christ that nobody else can even
[1:48:06] though they might be able to preach the
[1:48:07] light zone
[1:48:08] it's supposed to be lived sermons
[1:48:11] right
[1:48:12] Jesus Sermon on the Mount was to put
[1:48:14] them into action not to put them into a
[1:48:17] talking mood
[1:48:18] put them into a way of life
[1:48:20] and that's the what that's the things
[1:48:22] that we're supposed to have engraved in
[1:48:24] our hearts amen is that when somebody
[1:48:25] comes up and they rise against us and
[1:48:27] they say something they ought not to or
[1:48:28] do something we turn the other cheek and
[1:48:31] we're Meek and we're mild we have the
[1:48:33] nature of the Lamb amen that's what the
[1:48:35] bride is supposed to have is the nature
[1:48:36] of a lamb not a nature of a wolf nor
[1:48:39] even a lion that's his that's for him to
[1:48:41] take but we take on what the submissive
[1:48:43] wife not to be trifle with by any means
[1:48:46] we've got power we've got Authority by
[1:48:48] all means but we don't go around there
[1:48:49] whirling the sword around our head
[1:48:51] taking on everything that comes out
[1:48:52] there no no
[1:48:54] we're staying in our place aren't we
[1:48:55] we're going to do what he wants us to do
[1:49:00] brother Brown said the blood of Jesus
[1:49:01] Christ perfects the bride a man who
[1:49:04] chooses a wife doesn't put her through a
[1:49:06] lot of punishment he's already found
[1:49:07] Grace too with her she has found Grace
[1:49:09] with him he's engaged to her his grace
[1:49:12] is so great upon them and so will it be
[1:49:15] upon the bride and so it is on the bride
[1:49:17] we unworthy creatures deserving of hell
[1:49:19] but his grace holds us through it look
[1:49:23] at how many lost and blind and you look
[1:49:25] around you say why me
[1:49:27] why me there is no Rhyme or Reason that
[1:49:29] brother Mark would see that and respond
[1:49:32] to it and somebody else in his exact
[1:49:33] same position wouldn't
[1:49:36] but God rich and mercy that's all
[1:49:38] predestinated God by the the by his own
[1:49:42] Good Will said Mark Coffey is my child
[1:49:44] and so when he reads that something's
[1:49:46] going to respond to him and that's what
[1:49:48] happened in each and every one of our
[1:49:49] Lives it could be anybody else but it's
[1:49:51] not it's you
[1:49:52] it's you and that's Grace
[1:49:56] he says we unworthy look at how many
[1:49:58] lost and blind how many how many Sinners
[1:50:01] was there in the world the hour I got
[1:50:03] saved and he says God save me for a
[1:50:06] purpose and I'm determined by his will
[1:50:08] to do that purpose I don't care what
[1:50:11] anything else goes I want to do it this
[1:50:14] is the law of Liberty he says what is
[1:50:16] that you take your freedom and you put
[1:50:18] yourself back into what willful bondage
[1:50:20] to Christ not bondage like this
[1:50:23] but bondage to do as he says what you
[1:50:25] would do to follow his will to follow
[1:50:28] his word to be to be led by his spirit
[1:50:30] amen to do what your Kingdom Purpose is
[1:50:32] in this world
[1:50:34] Romans 8 says the spirit itself beareth
[1:50:36] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:50:38] children of God
[1:50:40] and if we're children then we're heirs
[1:50:43] there's something more to come
[1:50:44] Heirs of God joint heirs with Christ if
[1:50:47] so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:50:50] may also be glorified together for I
[1:50:53] reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:50:54] present time are not worthy to be
[1:50:56] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:50:58] revealed in us we focus so much on the
[1:51:00] glory that's going to be revealed and we
[1:51:02] forget that he says their sufferings in
[1:51:03] this present time
[1:51:05] it's a battle it's a struggle it's
[1:51:07] trials it's difficulty but there is a
[1:51:10] glory that's going to be revealed in us
[1:51:11] he says for the earnest expectation of
[1:51:14] the creature wadeth for the
[1:51:16] manifestation of the sons of God
[1:51:20] struck me as I was reading in in Exodus
[1:51:22] yesterday and this morning there and
[1:51:24] how the children of Israel they groaned
[1:51:29] and we spoke about it last Source where
[1:51:31] we said if you're groaning for something
[1:51:32] it means that God's on the way
[1:51:34] right so the Earth is groaning for
[1:51:37] something that we're supposed to have
[1:51:40] but here's the thing it's not just the
[1:51:42] groaning that makes it happen
[1:51:44] God has a time for it they've grown for
[1:51:47] 400 years 429 years
[1:51:50] and then in the 430th year God came down
[1:51:54] but the groaning means it's going to be
[1:51:55] satisfied one day
[1:51:57] that he'll hear them
[1:51:59] and he'll come down and he'll deliver
[1:52:01] with a mighty hand he says I'll do it
[1:52:03] I'll do it in a way that that they'll
[1:52:04] push you away with a mighty hand
[1:52:07] I'll work them over so heavily I'll beat
[1:52:10] the I'll beat the Egyptians up so badly
[1:52:12] that they'll be shoving you out the door
[1:52:14] and we saw what happened when they did
[1:52:15] they they spoiled the Egyptians they
[1:52:17] took their jewelry they took their gold
[1:52:18] they took their silver they took
[1:52:20] everything good that the Egyptians had
[1:52:21] the Egyptians said take it and leave us
[1:52:23] alone
[1:52:25] that's what's happening on this Earth
[1:52:28] they're groaning the Earth is groaning
[1:52:29] and everyone that's at a rate against US
[1:52:31] they're going to want to just get us out
[1:52:33] of here
[1:52:34] that's it we prick their consciences
[1:52:37] we get in their way we hold things back
[1:52:40] but it's groaning it's groaning for us
[1:52:42] to do what we're supposed to do
[1:52:44] but we can't make it happen we can
[1:52:46] believe we can be sensitive and we can
[1:52:49] trust God to pull us into this thing
[1:52:51] Amen to draw us into it willingly as
[1:52:53] we're moving forward amen why it's
[1:52:55] manifesting time
[1:52:57] it's manifesting time and guess what
[1:52:58] we're going to see a whole lot more bad
[1:52:59] than we are good
[1:53:01] listen the bride is the minority on the
[1:53:04] earth so so get ready there's lots more
[1:53:06] bad stuff coming
[1:53:08] but how many times have we heard it said
[1:53:11] if Satan's getting his
[1:53:13] partner
[1:53:14] she's not a wife
[1:53:16] if Satan's getting his partner ready
[1:53:18] what's God doing with his bride as well
[1:53:20] if Satan is arraigned all of his weapons
[1:53:22] against the bride then what is God doing
[1:53:24] he's what he's pouring in his Spirit
[1:53:25] he's raising up a standard so that we'll
[1:53:27] be able to stand against that flood amen
[1:53:31] what is it to do it's to prove God's Not
[1:53:33] Dead
[1:53:33] that Christ didn't just die in that that
[1:53:35] cross and raise up again but he's living
[1:53:36] and you and I the exact same way
[1:53:39] as we close brother Bob says someone
[1:53:41] said how can you stand let anybody call
[1:53:44] you such bad names
[1:53:45] you don't live for yourself you live for
[1:53:48] others that you might redeem that man
[1:53:50] you become sons and the trouble of it is
[1:53:53] the church has forgot they were Sons you
[1:53:57] are our son you're taking Christ's place
[1:53:59] you're a son so don't live for yourself
[1:54:01] live for others
[1:54:03] then he says well I can live for this
[1:54:05] brother because he sure is a nice man he
[1:54:08] says that's not it live for that man who
[1:54:10] hates you
[1:54:13] ouch
[1:54:17] live for that woman that hates you
[1:54:19] live for that person who could who would
[1:54:22] kill you if they could
[1:54:25] it's a bit extreme Brother John
[1:54:27] manifestation of the sons of God is
[1:54:29] Extreme
[1:54:30] it is Extreme
[1:54:34] that's what they've done to him they
[1:54:36] killed him and he died that he might
[1:54:37] save them that's eternal life when you
[1:54:40] that's in your bosom you're facing
[1:54:42] heaven then
[1:54:43] he says but you sacrifice your own
[1:54:45] things give them up like the sheep gives
[1:54:47] its wool you look on towards Calvary he
[1:54:50] says I hope this helps you to get in a
[1:54:52] place that's what the Tabernacle that's
[1:54:54] what all people has got to do is find
[1:54:56] out what you are and what's the purpose
[1:54:59] Church isn't going to church just to
[1:55:01] play music and sing songs church is a
[1:55:04] place where there's correction judgment
[1:55:06] begins at the house of God and we must
[1:55:08] reckon ourselves dead and alive to
[1:55:11] Christ then he made the way that we
[1:55:13] could sacrifice ourselves to his service
[1:55:15] to follow him if we follow him we lead
[1:55:19] the life that he lived that's wonderful
[1:55:22] may God bless you let's stand together
[1:55:24] if we would this evening
[1:55:27] amen I'm so glad that he's made a way
[1:55:30] amen
[1:55:32] that is not me that's doing it it's
[1:55:33] Christ that lives Within Me
[1:55:36] that even when I don't want to you know
[1:55:37] we sing that song that
[1:55:39] I was on the verge
[1:55:43] of giving over
[1:55:44] we talk about something keeps holding me
[1:55:47] that's because there's something written
[1:55:49] in here and it's because there's a holy
[1:55:51] spirit that sealed you to the day of
[1:55:52] your Redemption that's what's holding
[1:55:54] you day in and day out it's not our
[1:55:56] strength it's not our discipline it's
[1:55:57] not our goodness but he's made a way for
[1:55:59] us amen and it's a way that we can walk
[1:56:01] day in and day out listen we can have
[1:56:04] the victory every day
[1:56:06] by that I mean we won't lose the battle
[1:56:09] you don't win the battle every day
[1:56:11] sometimes you just battle into the next
[1:56:12] day and the next day and the next day
[1:56:14] but the idea is not to give ground to
[1:56:17] hold your ground remember scripture says
[1:56:19] when he comes in what do we do having
[1:56:21] done all the stand we stand
[1:56:23] and we push and we hold and we pray and
[1:56:26] we pray and we say Lord I need more and
[1:56:28] God gives us more Lord the enemy is
[1:56:30] stronger the Lord makes you stronger
[1:56:32] Lord I need more of your spirit I need
[1:56:34] more guidance I need more Deliverance I
[1:56:35] need more strength I need more
[1:56:37] discernment I need more wisdom and what
[1:56:39] does he do he says if any man lack
[1:56:42] if any woman lack ask
[1:56:45] him who a braideth not but giveth what
[1:56:47] willingly freely
[1:56:50] abundantly whatever we have
[1:56:53] it's available to us and it's a new way
[1:56:55] of life where we're not sitting there
[1:56:56] and beating ourselves up but we're
[1:56:58] saying Lord I'm trusting in the leading
[1:57:00] of your Holy Spirit the provision that
[1:57:02] your word has laid before me and that's
[1:57:04] what I'm going to walk in day in and day
[1:57:06] out and day in day out I was talking to
[1:57:08] someone today that went through a a very
[1:57:11] very rough situation physically just
[1:57:13] Satan hit him with something and uh and
[1:57:16] he passed out three times in a night
[1:57:19] knocked himself on his head gave himself
[1:57:21] a concussion and he said I don't know
[1:57:23] what it was he said and then I thought
[1:57:25] about it and he said I look back at job
[1:57:26] where Satan came up and he says
[1:57:29] you know I've been walking all over the
[1:57:31] Earth and God said have you considered
[1:57:32] job and he says yeah job you guard him
[1:57:35] so well nothing bad ever happens to job
[1:57:38] nothing bad ever happens to him and he
[1:57:40] says let me touch him and and he'll turn
[1:57:42] his back on you and the brother said
[1:57:43] this was an attack it took him to the
[1:57:45] hospital that's how bad it was he
[1:57:47] knocked himself out three times fainting
[1:57:48] in a night had to go in an ambulance he
[1:57:50] got there and when they were done they
[1:57:52] said we can't find anything he went home
[1:57:53] a good man completely
[1:57:55] his wife had had reached out to my wife
[1:57:58] because they're over in BC four and a
[1:58:00] half hours this was 2 30 last night this
[1:58:02] happened or two nights ago she said
[1:58:04] they're the only ones that are going to
[1:58:05] be awake so I'm going to reach them and
[1:58:07] block and I prayed right there first
[1:58:09] thing in the morning
[1:58:10] and he went in there and he came out of
[1:58:11] it just no issues but he said what is it
[1:58:14] he says because it worried me it worried
[1:58:16] me that Satan could hit me that hard
[1:58:18] and he said I felt like I was dying I
[1:58:21] thought I was done
[1:58:22] he said and it worried me he said then I
[1:58:23] thought about and he says that was just
[1:58:25] a test he says because we've been making
[1:58:26] what footsteps
[1:58:29] we've just been doing a little bit of
[1:58:30] walking
[1:58:31] he didn't say we've been running all
[1:58:33] over the church he said but we've been
[1:58:34] making some changes in our life and each
[1:58:37] day just one foot
[1:58:39] just one foot Satan hates that just one
[1:58:42] foot you know what he loves he says
[1:58:43] loves when somebody starts running
[1:58:44] around because he knows if I can get
[1:58:45] them turned they'll run right back to
[1:58:47] where they were
[1:58:48] but you get that person that just real
[1:58:51] solid stable you can't knock them they
[1:58:54] just walk they walk Satan hates that he
[1:58:56] says that's what we've been doing we
[1:58:57] must just do a bit a little bit of
[1:58:59] walking in our family he says and we've
[1:59:01] been cleaning up our house we've been
[1:59:03] cleaning up our relationships and we've
[1:59:04] been cleaning up our screen time and
[1:59:06] we've been cleaning up how we spend our
[1:59:07] time in these things he says and Satan
[1:59:09] hates it because all of a sudden my kids
[1:59:10] are so happy to be in church and they're
[1:59:12] they're asking us you know if somebody's
[1:59:15] sick no no Dad we got to go to church
[1:59:16] and Dad we're late for church and this
[1:59:18] and that and he says and and we're going
[1:59:20] to prayer meetings now and and God's
[1:59:21] really moving and we're having all these
[1:59:23] different things he says and Satan
[1:59:24] doesn't like that he says and so he says
[1:59:26] can I touch him and God said sure he
[1:59:27] says I don't worry about him he'll be
[1:59:29] fine and guess what he's got a beat up
[1:59:31] face
[1:59:32] it's got a sore shoulder he's not
[1:59:34] feeling so good
[1:59:35] I'll bet you anything he's in church
[1:59:36] tonight
[1:59:37] why because there's a law of the spirit
[1:59:40] of Life inside of him that keeps him
[1:59:42] going day in and day out listen we're
[1:59:43] going to get knocked around we're gonna
[1:59:45] get knocked around
[1:59:47] it's gonna happen
[1:59:48] get up and keep going
[1:59:50] don't beat yourself up about it don't
[1:59:52] beat yourself up about it there is a law
[1:59:54] of Liberty
[1:59:56] that says that Satan can't hold you down
[1:59:58] all you have to do is do is say the Lord
[2:00:00] I'm sorry I'm sorry for what I did and
[2:00:03] come back in and he says it's okay son
[2:00:05] it's okay daughter
[2:00:06] let's keep moving one step at a time
[2:00:09] sometimes we want victory in a big leap
[2:00:12] it doesn't happen that way so many times
[2:00:14] it's just footsteps brother Brown said
[2:00:16] footsteps is possession
[2:00:18] that's all you have to do just keep
[2:00:20] walking don't have to run through it you
[2:00:21] don't have to have Victory today just
[2:00:23] don't settle for falling back today just
[2:00:25] keep pushing day in and day out day in
[2:00:28] and day out amen let's bow our heads
[2:00:30] Heavenly Father
[2:00:33] Lord how wonderful it is Lord that
[2:00:35] you're not held back
[2:00:37] by the things we do
[2:00:39] Lord are by the things we don't do Lord

[2:00:51] going to make it happen heavenly father
[2:00:53] but Lord we want to be on your side Lord

[2:01:12] word and filled with your spirit Lord
[2:01:13] Jesus so Lord I pray for us each one
[2:01:16] tonight Lord some need big victories
[2:01:19] some need little victories and some of
[2:01:22] us need to help others with those
[2:01:23] victories Lord God help us Lord to be a

[2:19:18] amen
[2:19:20] amen praise the Lord
[2:19:22] he made the message was clear in that
[2:19:25] chorus it's uh not quite works is it
[2:19:28] anything we do which we've heard tonight
[2:19:30] is by his Spirit by the grace of God
[2:19:33] um if you want to see what you can it's
[2:19:35] just a brief report I was just asked to
[2:19:38] give a report
[2:19:39] if you don't want to sit you don't have
[2:19:41] to but you can't if you want
[2:19:45] um
[2:19:46] I just uh so I was just asked during the
[2:19:49] service if I would just brief everybody
[2:19:51] on what's been going on and where we are
[2:19:54] today
[2:19:55] so um
[2:19:57] essentially and we we have we have
[2:20:00] briefed the deacons uh up to a few days
[2:20:04] ago
[2:20:05] so we have brief the deacons and brother
[2:20:07] John as we were going through this but
[2:20:09] we we had experienced some
[2:20:12] um some I guess frustrations uh not not
[2:20:16] that it wasn't expected really because
[2:20:17] things were going pretty smooth so the
[2:20:19] devil knew that and he had to fire a few
[2:20:22] left hooks at us and he did that and and
[2:20:25] to be fair you know when you're dealing
[2:20:28] with the real estate agents who are
[2:20:30] dealing with the lawyers and and and the
[2:20:33] others
[2:20:34] uh and understand that this was really
[2:20:37] complex I mean nobody has ever seen a
[2:20:39] church going to receivership as big as
[2:20:41] the ERC church so now they got like 50
[2:20:45] 50 files that they're dealing with just
[2:20:47] one committee
[2:20:49] um that uh they're dealing with 50 50
[2:20:53] properties that they're trying to sell
[2:20:55] and the government has given up a
[2:20:56] deadline I think it's May 31 that they
[2:20:58] have everything done and you know money
[2:21:01] brought in so that they can pay to
[2:21:03] claims right that that are outstanding
[2:21:05] so
[2:21:06] um so you know we can understand some of
[2:21:09] that but what the problem that we were
[2:21:12] facing about America myself was that
[2:21:14] there was
[2:21:15] um we weren't getting answers and all we
[2:21:18] wanted was some simple answers of where
[2:21:20] are things who who who's doing what and
[2:21:24] is it done
[2:21:25] and where are we now where do we go and
[2:21:28] we we came to the point where we were
[2:21:30] reaching the deadline and you had to
[2:21:32] realize that this building is sold
[2:21:34] and it uh officially
[2:21:38] last Wednesday we were supposed to be
[2:21:40] out of here
[2:21:41] so it's the grace of God that we're here
[2:21:43] to be honest now the real estate agents
[2:21:46] understood that and they've kind of come
[2:21:48] around and
[2:21:50] and they're working with the purchaser
[2:21:53] who is uh obviously very decent person
[2:21:56] so he understands that there's a delay
[2:21:58] and he seems to be willing to work with
[2:22:00] us on it but that won't be forever of
[2:22:03] course
[2:22:05] um so you know that aside we did the
[2:22:08] American I decided we were going to put
[2:22:10] some pressure on uh those that uh the
[2:22:14] powers that be I guess and and we did
[2:22:17] that we started uh you know working with
[2:22:20] the real estate agents trying to force
[2:22:22] them to uh get to get to the source of
[2:22:25] the problem and I was talking to the
[2:22:28] town of uh CBS I'm trying to find out if
[2:22:33] the information that was required by
[2:22:35] them from the church was submitted and
[2:22:37] are they dealing with the application
[2:22:39] because that application
[2:22:41] and the permit that would come out of
[2:22:42] that is linked directly with our request
[2:22:46] for a permit to operate as a church in
[2:22:48] the new building okay so
[2:22:51] that has
[2:22:53] that has been ongoing and finally uh
[2:22:56] finally with the pressure that we have
[2:22:58] put on uh and uh along with the fact
[2:23:02] that our Banker reminded me at the same
[2:23:06] time that
[2:23:08] the
[2:23:09] the offer financing that we have will
[2:23:11] expire on not on February 4th on
[2:23:14] February 2nd I found out yesterday it
[2:23:16] was actually February 2nd
[2:23:18] so uh that being the case
[2:23:22] just to ease the ease your minds we Gus
[2:23:26] told me he said we're not losing the
[2:23:29] approval that president has said that
[2:23:32] has been done but the application will
[2:23:34] have to be all redone and resubmitted to
[2:23:37] their head office for you know a formal
[2:23:40] signature because because of rules that
[2:23:43] the bank has now
[2:23:45] years ago that when I was doing that
[2:23:46] stuff it uh it was just a little
[2:23:49] signature on an amendment but to extend
[2:23:52] but they can't do that
[2:23:54] and apparently that's government
[2:23:55] regulation now so
[2:23:57] uh so he's because now as of today uh we
[2:24:04] got a response from some correspondents
[2:24:06] from the town who told us okay to
[2:24:08] Catholic church we did meet with them we
[2:24:10] uh we told them I guess we they said we
[2:24:13] told him what's needed
[2:24:14] uh has to do with that survey and
[2:24:17] whatever else that was required they
[2:24:19] have not yet as of today submitted that
[2:24:22] they did commit yesterday to doing it
[2:24:24] and sort of getting that stuff ready and
[2:24:26] they're getting it into the town okay so
[2:24:29] we got that I tried to find out from the
[2:24:31] town what was what are the timelines
[2:24:34] because this has to be in their
[2:24:37] documentation has to be into the town
[2:24:40] a certain amount of days before the
[2:24:43] council meets and to improve it not ours
[2:24:47] but theirs because there's a whole lot
[2:24:49] bigger and that that application is the
[2:24:51] permit for a permit to subdivide the
[2:24:53] land on which right now we're in a we're
[2:24:56] on a piece of property that houses three
[2:24:58] buildings
[2:25:00] us
[2:25:01] the school and that preacher's residence
[2:25:04] says next door on the left
[2:25:06] so that had to be all subdivided and
[2:25:08] that's what they were working on
[2:25:10] so we do note at the survey
[2:25:14] is is done because it was sent to the
[2:25:18] to the school board for some for
[2:25:20] signatures and whatever
[2:25:24] so
[2:25:26] basically with with that letter that um
[2:25:30] that came back or that normally came
[2:25:32] back from the town of CBS today that
[2:25:35] tells us that there's not enough time to
[2:25:37] meet the January 31 council meeting
[2:25:40] therefore
[2:25:42] therefore we won't be able to close the
[2:25:44] deal before February 2nd from the bank's
[2:25:47] perspective
[2:25:48] uh so that's going to go that's actually
[2:25:50] going to go into well into February is
[2:25:53] my guess
[2:25:54] in the meantime we we've all agreed that
[2:25:57] we're going to uh sign a lease agreement
[2:25:59] and we're going to rent the property so
[2:26:02] that means that
[2:26:04] means we will go into the building with
[2:26:05] a rental agreement in hand okay with the
[2:26:08] with the Catholic church and
[2:26:10] there does not seem to be any problem
[2:26:12] with that it had
[2:26:15] it had gone to the Archbishop yesterday
[2:26:19] after the meeting and the lawyer advice
[2:26:23] for America today that he was expecting
[2:26:26] something as early as this afternoon
[2:26:27] back on that lease so
[2:26:30] um so that's that's just to let you know
[2:26:32] that we so that that's going to be the
[2:26:35] process here right we we thought we'd
[2:26:37] get there and hope that we would get the
[2:26:38] deal closed it won't be closed on time
[2:26:41] uh and it's somewhat expected the way
[2:26:44] things have been going
[2:26:45] and but uh having said that that's still
[2:26:50] in the works and we will still keep that
[2:26:52] pressure on to get the deal closed
[2:26:53] because believe it or not the Catholic
[2:26:55] Church wants it closed
[2:26:57] um
[2:26:58] so uh that will happen most likely God
[2:27:02] willing and sometime in February in the
[2:27:05] meantime
[2:27:06] uh it looks like we'll be moving rather
[2:27:10] soon if we have that agreement in our
[2:27:12] hand but America and I are happy with
[2:27:14] what we see in the agreement and there's
[2:27:16] no changes needed we could be and this
[2:27:19] is only me speaking
[2:27:21] uh we could we could possibly be
[2:27:23] starting that move on the weekend or
[2:27:26] early next week okay
[2:27:28] so stand ready everybody because when we
[2:27:31] move uh when we get that call we're
[2:27:33] going to head to
[2:27:34] uh you know Finnish friend and I have
[2:27:37] started boxing stuff up if you see the
[2:27:38] empty boxes in behind the view there so
[2:27:41] anybody got nothing to do feel free to
[2:27:43] come up and take a box and fill it up
[2:27:46] with something
[2:27:47] and we've got some in there and we've
[2:27:49] got some somewhere else so and I've got
[2:27:52] some stuff home but um so we're going to
[2:27:56] do what we can to uh over the weekend to
[2:27:58] box up some of the things that are here
[2:28:01] the rest of it is uh
[2:28:04] it will be like getting that building
[2:28:07] really quickly and we can get stuff in
[2:28:09] there the brothers who want to come when
[2:28:10] when we got it when we got the sanction
[2:28:12] to go uh and uproot everything and and
[2:28:16] take it out to where it's supposed to go
[2:28:19] um so all I'm saying is that we you know
[2:28:21] we want to be ready I know the sisters
[2:28:22] are meeting tomorrow to go over uh plans
[2:28:25] for uh for any cleaning and how it's
[2:28:27] going to proceed in the future so we're
[2:28:29] leaving that with them to uh to do that
[2:28:33] um
[2:28:34] and uh it's good to see somebody else
[2:28:36] going to breakfast besides us because we
[2:28:38] get a we get a bit of abuse from the
[2:28:40] crowd in the last meeting
[2:28:42] who didn't believe the fact that we were
[2:28:44] paying our own way but is that right
[2:28:47] uh how so anyway I just wanted to just
[2:28:50] just to update you I mean I don't think
[2:28:52] there's anything else that can come to
[2:28:53] mind to you
[2:28:55] oh
[2:28:58] it's it's the date issue
[2:29:04] yeah once you got that agreement it's
[2:29:06] nothing to stop us from going right
[2:29:18] will we be able yeah if we move Saturday
[2:29:21] we won't have anything here to have
[2:29:22] service we'll we'll go you know I mean
[2:29:25] it's our intent to let the man who
[2:29:26] bought this building have it you know
[2:29:29] you know and he knows we're not
[2:29:31] purposely trying to hold him off not at
[2:29:33] all uh the agents the two real estate
[2:29:36] agents involved have have actually
[2:29:40] uh said to him that uh because because
[2:29:43] his financing is being drawn down so
[2:29:45] he's paying interest and he's not in
[2:29:46] here so uh they they've agreed because
[2:29:49] of the way things have been going to uh
[2:29:51] help pay for some of his interest costs
[2:29:53] which I thought was really really pretty
[2:29:55] good of them
[2:29:57] um but uh from our perspective
[2:30:00] everything that need is needs to be
[2:30:02] submitted and don't is done you know
[2:30:04] we've had it done we've followed the
[2:30:06] rules as best we could we got an advice
[2:30:08] where we needed it and everything is
[2:30:11] done we're essentially we're waiting for
[2:30:13] a phone call I've been getting quotes on
[2:30:15] heating systems uh for the for the new
[2:30:19] building how you know and some advice as
[2:30:21] to how how to heat it efficiently and
[2:30:24] effectively that's ongoing so you know
[2:30:27] it's not only that that we're dealing
[2:30:28] with there's all those other things
[2:30:31] um for Paul
[2:30:35] uh
[2:30:37] so with the original view does that mean
[2:30:39] that
[2:30:40] can we still go ahead with changes to
[2:30:43] two building no I don't think so I I I
[2:30:45] we I've talked to Flame about that we
[2:30:48] don't we don't think so
[2:30:50] um
[2:30:52] no that'd be changing the the uh the
[2:30:56] building we shouldn't we can't do that
[2:30:57] but we can't have church
[2:31:00] you know we can't have church even if we
[2:31:02] have it in in the hallway up there we'll
[2:31:04] have church you know I mean the deacons
[2:31:06] are made not pretty clear to me so as
[2:31:08] soon as we and that's the desire of all
[2:31:11] of our hearts I mean you know
[2:31:13] yes
[2:31:22] that's a good question
[2:31:24] um
[2:31:25] we will what we are hoping we're going
[2:31:28] to see in that agreement is that we're
[2:31:30] going to be responsible for the
[2:31:31] utilities while we're in there so that's
[2:31:33] a pretty low price to pay
[2:31:36] um it's certainly not our fault that we
[2:31:39] are we are so uh so we would expect that
[2:31:43] and it's only fair that we do pay
[2:31:45] utilities when we go in because we'll be
[2:31:47] paying utilities where we go right so
[2:31:51] um
[2:31:52] so
[2:31:53] if there's anything over and above that
[2:31:55] we would we would want to go back to
[2:31:57] them and say
[2:31:58] uh we want reimbursement for that either
[2:32:00] through a reduction at a purchase price
[2:32:02] or uh just just give us a check
[2:32:05] we think that would be fair
[2:32:07] so we will talk to we'll talk to him
[2:32:09] about it we're not going to hold enough
[2:32:11] to move and we certainly won't we don't
[2:32:13] want to get bogged down in in a lease
[2:32:15] agreement over
[2:32:16] over over rental fee if possible you
[2:32:19] know so because the the whole structure
[2:32:23] that they have is deep you know I mean
[2:32:27] it it goes to this our real estate agent
[2:32:30] tonight real estate agent to somebody
[2:32:31] who's on a committee indicator gets
[2:32:33] committee together the committee has I
[2:32:35] don't know six seven people or whatever
[2:32:37] and then they got to make a decision and
[2:32:39] that doesn't happen believe me it
[2:32:40] doesn't happen overnight
[2:32:42] so we are under the gun in a way to get
[2:32:44] to get moving out of here and as soon as
[2:32:47] that can happen providing the deal is
[2:32:49] reasonable we will do that
[2:32:52] yes
[2:33:04] a lot of the churches have done this
[2:33:14] might sign it so you know it's happened
[2:33:17] and in terms of difficulty
[2:33:21] they don't look at this one
[2:33:33] you know so
[2:33:35] like
[2:33:39] yeah we take
[2:33:43] yes
[2:33:47] in every case that you know the lawyer
[2:33:49] before he requests funds from our bank
[2:33:51] to close the deal he has to certify
[2:33:54] title and to certify title that that's
[2:33:57] kind of where the the it takes a bit of
[2:33:59] time now in these deals because
[2:34:00] everything had to be subdivided I mean
[2:34:03] everything had to be surveyed and some
[2:34:04] divided so that's one of the things that
[2:34:07] holds this up
[2:34:14] yeah
[2:34:16] that's good
[2:34:18] and I I think
[2:34:23] yeah and that's you know and later on we
[2:34:26] won't get in all details on those
[2:34:27] agreements or anything but we'll later
[2:34:29] on we'll tell you where you can't park
[2:34:37] you know and if we get like utilities
[2:34:41] anyway
[2:34:43] you know if we had if this if we had
[2:34:46] moved into January
[2:34:48] yes absolutely absolutely
[2:34:54] yeah oh no it won't it shouldn't be but
[2:34:57] I mean the thing is you've got a
[2:34:59] building that's empty and they have to
[2:35:01] pay the utilities on it now just to keep
[2:35:02] the water from freezing right keep the
[2:35:04] heat on and stuff we're saying okay
[2:35:06] we'll pay it we would pay the the
[2:35:09] utilities let us go in and we'll take
[2:35:11] that burden off you right I mean the
[2:35:14] ultimate result here is that we want to
[2:35:17] hurry the benefit is that we get a
[2:35:19] building somebody else gets our building
[2:35:21] and hopefully with a 400 000 check it
[2:35:24] gets to the claimants the ones that
[2:35:27] we're suffering because of all it is in
[2:35:29] the end result they we'd like to see
[2:35:32] them get their money you know in all
[2:35:34] fairness you know I think the system has
[2:35:37] gone against them myself but
[2:35:43] it's being pushed
[2:35:45] yeah
[2:36:10] it was
[2:36:12] yeah and and because now
[2:36:19] it comes with me but
[2:36:23] but the thing and as good you said that
[2:36:25] because uh you know in this deal that
[2:36:29] we've got with the financing debt
[2:36:31] servicing ratios are all calculated and
[2:36:34] that's why we had to put into the deal
[2:36:36] what we did have to put in but now the
[2:36:38] interest rate's gone up since we came in
[2:36:40] uh as you know since since we got our
[2:36:43] application in and got it approved now
[2:36:45] the deal is expiring we got to go under
[2:36:47] new the new interest rates which has
[2:36:49] gone up another half point so to meet
[2:36:51] those calculations that bank does we're
[2:36:55] going to have to put a few more dollars
[2:36:56] into the deal up front
[2:36:58] uh and oh I did I didn't tell you today
[2:37:01] but Gus told me I asked him for an
[2:37:03] estimate of what that would be so he
[2:37:06] said
[2:37:07] maybe two or three thousand more okay we
[2:37:09] can do that he said maximum five but but
[2:37:12] because he hasn't worked out the numbers
[2:37:13] but we'll get that so it's not as bad as
[2:37:16] we thought it might be we thought it
[2:37:18] might be an upwards of 10.
[2:37:22] correct
[2:37:25] correct so because that's right because
[2:37:28] as of February 2nd you know if this deal
[2:37:30] is not closed which it won't be we're
[2:37:33] 135 000 short
[2:37:35] that's what it amounts to right until we
[2:37:37] get that approval back get that sanction
[2:37:39] back in a new offer
[2:37:43] we will by Grace I mean to quote Matt
[2:37:47] it's our ability
[2:37:48] right
[2:37:50] and he said he's never a waivered on
[2:37:53] that
[2:37:54] right so and uh hopefully that will
[2:37:58] ignite all our faith amen
[2:38:01] so anyway I just I just wanted to say to
[2:38:03] say it and thanks to Joel for reminding
[2:38:05] me it's good to good to do that
[2:38:08] and uh so you know we'll be uh we'll
[2:38:12] need all hands to help for as many hands
[2:38:14] as possible
