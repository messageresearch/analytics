according to that word and his word he said where two or three are gathered in my name amen it's not about this vessel up here it's about us gathering in his name and we trust him to speak came in let's turn in the scriptures if we would to Ephesians 4 where we left off just near the end of service last night Ephesians 4 and verse 10 regions 4 verse 10 again staying on the idea of an open show of victory but we'll do a subtitle here just after we we start this here this evening so Ephesians 4 and verse 10 say Amen when you're there amen Ephesians 4 10 and this is where we talked about after Christ led a trail or a train of vanquished foes it says he did this and it says verse 10 he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things or that he might fulfill all things and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers why for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ how long are they to go for it says till we come in the unity of the faith we talked about that last night that's the rapture itself and of the knowledge of the Son of Man of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and what's the effect of this fivefold ministry it says that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive and what is the end result but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things in all things not in a few things or not in most things but in all things which is the head even Christ they meant is that our goal to grow up into the headship of Christ the perfect body under his purpose Amen let's just close her eyes as we go to the author and prayer Heavenly Father Lord what a wonderful time we have had in your presence already Lord God but Lord this is the main event not because of me bored but because this is where your priority is Lord is in your word because this is you more than we've lifted you up and we've sacrificed but Lord we ask you now to come back and that you would just come down in a special way and open your word to us Heavenly Father well we know there's nothing new Under the Sun I doubt I'm bringing anything that is new to the people Lord but there may be a new angle or there may be a new thought there may be something that would touch them in a way it's never touched them before or maybe there are questions here or maybe are those that are bound here but Lord we pray today that your world would have its full effect on the people within the hearing of this voice Lord God maybe just minister to the hearts of your precious people Lord may you just help prepare your bride a little bit more Lord as we step closer to that rapture we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen you can have your seats this evening again just to recap slightly we have some that weren't here last night we talked about the the three full purpose of God that brother Branham brought out in that that message Christ is the mystery of God revealed and last night we spoke on the victory through the lamb and how God came and had that perfect preeminence and perfect expression through Christ and then because he identified him as that when he said hear you him he was the perfect sacrifice and when he died God rent the veil from the top to the bottom showing that God had accepted the sacrifice and his presence was no longer in the Holy of Holies but that he was seeking a new place to dwell another place to put his name amen so that was Christ's victory that was his personal victory if you will over Satan was when he took death went down took the keys of hell death in the grave and then rose again that was his victory but now we want to work into that second phase of the plan of redemption and brother Branham said this again he said the second part was what for Christ to have the preeminence 'as in his church which is his body the bride until he could have the preeminence to express himself through them amen so for a subtitle tonight I want to talk on Victor through preeminence but I want to dig into this a little bit because brother branham gives us this beautiful clue as to where we are and in time and where we are in the age is he he speaks there and he starts off when he says have the preeminence 'as in his church preeminence is plural he says have the preeminence is in his church which is his body the bride why because he has to have the preeminence in each one in the body before he has the preeminence in a collective body so the first victory he has to have is over you as an individual he has to have the preeminence in each and every one of your lives and then when he has the preeminence in each and every one of your lives but the RAM says this until he could have the preeminence singular to express himself through them so now he says once he has the preeminence says now he has the preeminence because once he's got you in his fully in his control as an individual what does he do he fits you into this body now and those within the body now act only according to the head and with that it means there's only one preeminence now everybody is working together for one common goal and one one common purpose so preeminence is individually and then he brings you into one big group the body Bride of Christ and has the preeminence within you there it's kind of like a newborn baby right if we could look at it that way you have a newborn baby and it has all of the parts that an adult has but guess what when it's laying there in the bed it's just kind of doing this and twitching that in the legs here in the legs there and there's no coordination is there all the parts are there but that bought that baby's head doesn't have the preeminence over its body yet it hasn't trained itself it hasn't taught itself how to work and so as it gets the individual preeminence in its arm and as its fingers what's the first thing you see with the babies they try and do what they reach out to grab something right and the fingers sort of work and they're doing this and this and this and they drop things and whatnot and all of a sudden they can do that and they can reach out and they can move it but then once they can grab it's not just for the sake of grabbing but now it's for grabbing with a purpose it's to be able to take something and lift it to their mouth to chew on the things that you told them not to chew on right it's to put food into their mouths it's to keep the body fed so it's they have to get the preeminence over the fingers and then they have to blend those fingers in to the purpose of the body so that it can feed so it can protect so that it can move and change things that's what God's doing with us getting the preeminence is in the little fingers and then he now brings them in under the headship of the purpose and the and the growth of the body so that it all works together now in one grand unified plan because the fingers have to work in concert with the head and the feet and the rest of the body in that it has a purpose and so that's what he's saying get the preeminence is in each one of us and now integrate it into this beautiful Bride of Christ amen so when God has when Christ has the preeminence in us we will work for one purpose of one purpose only we will work together as a unit and that's the only way we're going to get out of here so he says look if we're at the stage where I'm only getting the preeminence as in you you got some ways to go but if he's got the pre evidences in us individually now we're looking to see is he using us as a body is he using us as a group are we working towards this one plan of God to take us away into a rapture but we've got a plan and a purpose here this is not just to take us out but what he's got to have the preeminence in his by to express himself now through her just as he did through Christ amen so if you want to see how close you are to the rapture my question is how close are you and unity you can say I'm wonderful I'm ready to go on a rapture but if you're sitting at home by yourself you're not a part of a body you're not even close to a rapture because there is a body that needs you now right you can sit there and say I'm the perfect finger but if that finger is not attached to a hand it's not attached to an arm it's not attached to a body it is of no purpose so that is a question he says he's got to have the preeminence as in you individually now he's going to bring you in so are you attached to a body and are you working with that body to achieve the purpose of Christ in your local area amen what did he say and brother balm talks about this in restoration the bride tree and what is the second last thing that comes back he says it's the leaves of fellowship and after the leaves of fellowship quickly comes now the full manifestation of the fruits of the spirit and then were gone so that fellowship has to be restored not just you with Christ but you with each other to work together to achieve much right the scripture says what would you take one or two sticks they're easily broken but what when you have a bunch of them together nobody can break it and that's the unbreakable body of crisis when were unified together under his word amen Paul said listen first corinthians verse 12 verse 25 he says that there should be no schism in the body that's a division or a separation or even a crack in materials in engineering if there is a crack it may not have failed but in time it will fail if there is a break there so you have to fill that crack in and you'll find when they do it they can't just fill with material but they have to go in and grind it out to get the sharp edges out and then they fill it back in and then it can handle the stress again so he says that there should be no cracks that there should be no divisions in the body but that the members should have the same care one for another and whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honored all the members rejoice with it he says now ye are the body of Christ singular and members plural in particular and I'm not going to dwell too much in this tonight it's a whole sermon in itself but the idea is each one of you is here for a purpose and only you can do what you are meant to do here we have poor substitutes sometimes where you have somebody with a willing heart that says I'm willing to step up and do this for the sake of the body but that is not the one that's ordained to do it necessarily that is one that is filling the place until he has the preeminence in you and you will step forward into the place where you're supposed to be but that's what we're looking for is a perfect presentation of your gift your attribute of Christ into that body amen amen we want to get into the preeminence I looked it up it says surpassing all others superior or distinguished above all else so here to write rewrite what brother Branham says he says the purpose the second purpose would be for Christ to have the superiority in his church which is his body the bride until he could surpass everything within them to express himself through them so he's got to have Kingdom Authority within you before he expresses Kingdom Authority outside of you right so he's got to come in and he's got to have full control over the inside before he can now start to move you into the work to do outside if you will so the battle is internal we're talking about the preeminence now and we've got to start with each one of us individually does he have the preeminence is he getting his kingdom Authority inside of me so that he can now move that and show it outwardly amen so the first manifestation of what by the talking about is internal he's got to have a work inside of you right the the control tower has to be given completely to him there's only one way you can do that and that is not just by sitting under the word and in attending a particular church but it is to have the very life of God within you it is to have the Holy Spirit inside of you and we'll talk a bit about that tomorrow night god willing but we want to again take our scriptural authority I used a quote to start but I want to take us back to the scriptures here so that we can get that so if we can turn in the scriptures here very quickly to Colossians chapter 1 my voice is a little rough I'm not used to preaching long sermons my hands a little sore too I'm not used to hitting books in the pulpit amen Colossians 1:17 it says and he is before all things and by all things consist we've read that yesterday seeing everything on earth everything in the heavens visible invisible it was all made by him and though it's fallen out of its purpose his its original purpose that he created it for yet it was all created by him and it's used by him for his grand plan of redemption here he meant it says for he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead so if he is the beginning and the firstborn that must be there therefore mean there are more to follow if there is an only child you don't call him your firstborn you call him my only child but he says I'm the firstborn and the beginning so there must be something at the end as well not just at the beginning there must be many more that follow the firstborn to be the second born third born fourth or not and on down through amen so wide that in all things he might have the preeminence right but he's talking about what those that come after the firstborn right he was the firstborn in Christ had that God had the preeminence in Christ and now he says who is the beginning the first form firstborn from the dead that in all things that follow him is what he's talking about he might have the preeminence right those that are born of the spirit in Christ for please the father that in him should all fullness dwell but he just said he's going to have the preeminence in all things so he's looking for what the fullness to be expressed what in those that follow after him jumping up to verse 25 says wherefore I Paula made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the Word of God even this mystery which has been hidden the ages and from generations but now has made manifest to his Saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles so this is for the gentiles not for the jews necessarily I mean the Jews could come in but this was expressly given to the Gentile bride which is this mystery this riches of glory of this mystery which is Christ in you the hope of glory so what is this mystery it is Christ in us the hope of glory amen whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus so what is the end goal of this what is the end result it is that we would be presented perfect in Christ Jesus but he says presented and we we can't a glimpse of that when the Prophet you know he had that vision of the bride going up and he talked about presenting his church age presenting the bride of this age to Christ and he talked about you know what's Paul going to do it and yes how how will he be judged and by Paul Singh and what not but there's a presentation that comes for the bride of each age and it's the messenger of each age gets to present them to Christ amen and Paul talks about this in in 2nd Corinthians because what he's talking about is is changing now from a caretaker role into that marital role it's like led a czar to Isaac right Paul is only a caretaker he wasn't the husband he wasn't the end goal he wasn't the one that they married they had to listen to him but he was not the end goal and he's saying I'm going to present you to somebody else so don't have a relationship with me don't look to me for a relationship look to the one that sent me and he's the one that you're going to have the relationship in 2nd Corinthians 11 verse 2 Paul says this for I am jealous over you with godly jealousy not spousal jealousy godly jealousy he says for I have espoused you to one husband I have what what he says I've engaged you to somebody not to me to somebody else he says that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ so unadulterated by his seat as a man you do not want it physically for sure but even spiritually Paul was not to inject anything but to send them to Christ that was the only thing he could do that what chaste means pure modest but catch this immaculate immaculate not touched by another man amen so what is it it's the mystery of Christ being revealed in an election tile blood God was expected expressed in Christ the firstborn and now he's saying there's going to be a second expression that's what brother bands talking about he's got to have this perfect expression this preeminence now in a bride so that's a mystery though Paul talks about the mystery and it's a mystery to me how God is doing that and how he's going to finish that work why because we talked about last night this badger skin that each one of us is wearing I say how can God express himself through a badger skin like this now Jesus had this this advantage we could say because he was sinless but I don't see sinlessness when I look in the mirror and I don't have to walk very far to get remind of it on a daily basis but that's what we covered last night is we actually have the same advantage as Jesus Christ we are the sinless spotless chaste virgin that is espoused to Christ there is no difference now between his righteousness and my righteousness and we'll get into that I have his righteousness there is nothing written on my page that can condemn me so we don't have a different advantage than Christ he didn't have one over us what he did have though was a fullness a fullness that we don't have amen and that's where the real struggle is going to happen is in bringing that carnality into surrender to what the word says about us rather than what our flesh would remind us of amen but I want to the difficulty for us is always this thing called time because we look in the word and we see what's happening and we see what's going to happen but in there there is time and and God has this wonderful thing with the Jews where he gives them an exact calendar but the Gentiles he doesn't give them a calendar he just says this is what I'm going to do and then he walks away and when he does that he does it and the the elect will catch it and the other ones do not but there's a time and we don't know when that time is going to be so we have to sit and we have to wait and we have to be ready but it's up to him to determine that time but it's a question of when not if but that Wayne is the most difficult thing of being a Christian these days but we want to place this in our day because we know this is the end time we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that this is the end time so we want to make sure that we're placing this preeminence here that it's not for another day and it's not for another group of people amen we're going to going to go into Revelation so we want to start with revelation 10 as you turn there again a very familiar scripture but we look at this so often as a mysterious book and and deep revelation in these different things and it is and and this is a book to the bride certainly the first half of the book of Revelation is to the Bride of Christ it is specifically for her until she goes up and then after that it's judgment and we don't it's not that we don't care about it but it's not for us we don't have to know everything that's going to happen to the Jews and all the mechanisms inside the tribulation we won't be here for it by God's grace but this is not just for us to know I mean there are things here that we have to experience there are things that we have to take for ourselves that we have to be an expectation for and it has to be a part of our life it is not so that we can walk out maybe amongst the denominations and say do you know what the seven seals are do you know what the seven church ages were that he didn't bring it to us for head knowledge he didn't bring it to us so that we could say we know more than you more you do but he brought it to us so that we would have an expectation we would have an experience that matches what he writes here amen so I want to keep it simple and say how what's so special about this and how can I do well on it and how can it grow me in Christ on a daily basis how can how can read them the the tenth chapter revelation grow me personally because this is for our day and we'll get into it but how does that build you up day to day how do you take this now a great revelation like this and say yeah this is going to build my faith on a day-by-day basis this is going to help me overcome amen let's start with revelation 10 verse 1 it says and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven it has a number of attributes it says he's clothed with a cloud a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire now we know who this purely based on the description because he's described earlier in Revelation chapter 1 verse 10 and I'll read it out it's very familiar and John says I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I'm Alpha and Omega the first in the last and he said what thou seest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum it's the attire of Sardis Philadelphia and Laodicea so we know this is for the Gentiles right those are Gentile churches and Gentile countries this is for the Gentiles and I turned to see the voice that spake to me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and then the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of Man clothed with the garment down to the foot and Girt about the paps with a golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool right we saw clothed with the cloud that's white right as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire and his feet were like unto fine brass that's gold and shiny metallic like it said earlier as pillars of fire as if they burned in a furnace and his voice is a sound of many waters so we see this general description here of the bright face the white head the shining bright feet him what not and he tells us in verse 16 who this is he says and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword the word and he and his countenance was as a sun shine it in his strength when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I am the first and the last and now he identifies himself completely says I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death so we know there's only one person and that is Christ that would match that description amen but we notice there's a slight difference here between revelation 1 in revelation 10 it is Christ we know what's Christ but there's two differences here because it says in Revelation 10 that he has a rainbow over his head and he's clothed with the cloud those are two things that show there is a specific event that is going to happen in Revelation 10 that is not just about Christ but rather there are things tied to it that match it to our day amen brother Brown says this and the breech he says but here comes one down from heaven a rainbow covenant see only Christ it could be so he says this coming Christ in Revelation 10 is in answer to a covenant and not just any covenant he says but a rainbow covenant the rainbow identifies it as a specific covenant right so if we read the revelation 10 it doesn't say and I saw another mighty angel it would say and I saw Christ come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as of where the Sun is feet as pillars of fire so this is not just a messenger or just we say another mighty angel but this is Christ himself coming down in a very specific event to fulfill a very specific covenant to a very specific people in a very specific time right this is not a general coming this is for a covenant that he has already laid in the scriptures amen and this is not something that anyone else can do but Christ himself now we read last night that he came down with what an open book in his hands so we know that only he could open the seals but what's he doing with all of this is what we want to get into a little bit tonight he meant now I'm not going to dwell too much on the cold with a cloud part amen except to say this you know when Christ came down clothed with a cloud based on what happens after he came down clothed with a cloud and the scripture says in Revelation timbres - says and he had in his hand a little book open right we read the other day in Revelation 5 the book was closed but in Revelation tenants open so he identifies the time when he came down with a cloud as when the seals are opened amen and it says and he said his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion so not a lamb remember he saw him as a he said the Lion of the jaw of the tribe of Judah has prevailed he saw him as a lamb but now when John sees him in Revelation 10 there's no more lamb this is a king this is the lion now coming for to redeem his bride amen he says I saw him as when a lion I cried with the loud voice as when a lion north and when he had cried seven thunders are their voices so if the seven thunders have been spoken if the seven seals are open because that's what was under the thunders by the bottom said he said those seven thunders were preached under those seals because that's what John was told not to write when the seven thunders uttered he said don't write it what could me write what was under those seals so if the seals have been open then we know Christ must have come down clothed with the cloud now we look and when the seals were open that was 1963 that's what we believe so Christ must have come down clothed with a cloud before then now listen to what brother Branham says about this he says that day they took pictures all across the southern United States and Mexico there it hangs now in Life Magazine do we have it here right he says there it hangs now in Life magazine still a mystery to them but he declares it in the heavens before he does it on earth he always does that he shows his signs in the heavens first now I'm not going to say that is Christ well the RAM doesn't say that is Christ you can believe it that way and it doesn't matter to me because it in the end it's about what was thus it was it signifying right he said he declares it in the heavens before he does it so whether we think that's Christ or not and some have made a doctrine out of it where they turn it into a certain thing it doesn't matter to me the point is we know that after that cloud was shown the seals were open so that signified the coming of Christ whether that was him or not clothed in a cloud you can believe it any way you want I believe that was him coming down clothed in the cloud that's what I believe that makes sense to me but after that the seals were opened and so we know he must have come down clothed with a cloud so because of that then we know that Christ has come down and he is here now to fulfill this rainbow covenant amen what was what is a rainbow covenant Genesis 9 you're all very familiar with this it says and God said this is the token of the Covenant the token of the Covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations so he says forever I do set my bow my rainbow in the cloud and this shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth and it shall come to pass when I bring a cloud over the earth that the bow shall be seen in the cloud and I will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh so we see a rainbow is a specific covenant that God has with the people but this is not a two sided covenant the rainbow covenant did not say if you do well then I will not ever flood the earth again didn't say if you do your part then I'll do my part and I won't destroy the earth again he says this is between me and you forever I will do this and he says I will what I will hold back the floodwaters of destruction I will never again destroy the earth by water amen one side of Covenant and this is what we have to remember about this covenant that Christ is coming down this age and that's that you cannot inject yourself into this covenant you cannot make what's going to happen under this covenant happen to yourself right this is not going to be of your work it's not going to be of your strength it's not going to be of your discipline it's not going to be of your knowledge this is going to be Christ's coming down to do what he said and that is it amen it is all grace grace grace and then that is I believe the eternal cry of the bride is Grace because we did nothing to deserve it we do nothing to make it happen we can encourage we can open it but it's his time and his place to come down and do this amen we are completely and totally reliant on the blood that Christ shed on that cross to keep us in a condition that he can work with him in well the brown said this and show us the father he says then I think to happen I happen to think again that when John on the Isle of Patmos turned around and seen this he's seen Jesus sitting there to look upon a rainbow this is brother by him setting us up for this rainbow covenant he said his sardis and Jasper stone which was the Reuben and Benjamin that's the first son of Jacob and the last son of Jacob he which was and which is and is to come the root and the offspring of David the Morningstar and over him was a rainbow with these seven golden candlesticks meaning that he had a covenant for the seven last Church ages so what's that covenant it must have been declared because he's coming down to fulfill it so he must have declared it somewhere and listen to what brother Brown said there because this is the key point he says I saw Jesus sitting there to look upon as a rainbow his Sardis and Jasper stone which was the Reuben and Benjamin the first and the last so brother Brendan takes you back to what revelation 1 where John says I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last so he ties it back to the first mass born of Jacob and he says now you have Christ now the first born and the last born is the way he puts it there so he doesn't say Alpha and Omega and everything in between I don't know all the other Greek letters I know a couple from my engineering degree but I've messed them all up but he says I'm Alpha and Omega I am A & Z I'm the beginning and the end in the middle that's not me so he says he's saying I'm the eighth I'm at the beginning and I'm at the end perfectly expressed but in the beginning I'm not I'm starting perfect I'm ending perfect but there's this process it's now going to happen in between amen so we see though that he says I'm the first in the last so what he started with is what he's going to finish with but we're gonna have to go through what these seven church ages that's a Berber I'm said the Rainbows over the entire seven church ages all the way through alpha to Omega the covenants over that but this is when he comes down to fulfill the covenant amen amen are you with me so we know the seed because he remember he talked about he's the firstborn he had to die that many could come out after and we'll get into that now a bit because the the key is that what goes into the ground must come out of the ground and then we get into the sea principle and brother Lonnie Jenkins does a really beautiful job of this in in the revelation series I'll cover a little bit of here because he ports us back to Genesis 1 it says and God said let the earth bring forth grass the herb yielding seed the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself whose seed is in itself not in another in itself upon the earth and it was so and the earth brought forth grass and herb yielding seed after his kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself after his kind and God saw that it was good it meant so weird to be born again of the seed incorruptible which is the Word of God which was buried in Christ and now is to come back in a bride Amen as he rose again so we have to rise again from the same planting but we saw then there that he was not just in Christ but he moved into an alpha church the the original Pentecostal church amen so we see here that it's two different times John 12:23 says this and jesus answered to them saying the hours come that the Son of man should be glorified barely barely I say unto you except a corn he says a kernel or a seed of wheat falling the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit that's what he's talking to now about himself he says I have to die and be planted so that now more of me will come up and when you plan one do you get one or do you get many right when that one dies you are many pleasant ones that are scattered and now you bring up more and it just multiplies itself over and over again so he was the seed that was planted in there and now he's saying now in the end we've got the same thing that's going to come back again and then so he's planted into the ground we know that he rose again but that alpha is not just Christ but it is that original Pentecostal church and we'll get into that a little more heavily tomorrow to show you how he does that but that word came back into the body of believers and up in an upper room in Jerusalem a hundred and twenty of them received that seed into their souls and they again reflected the perfect life of Christ no we talked about it last night that they did not express it in the way we will in that they did not go in a rapture but they were still the perfect expression of Christ that church had no denomination it had no group of men telling them what to do and leading them in different directions he said go there tarry till your endued with power from on high and then out you go and that's what they did and the Lord added to them daily such as were needed and then they were out showing signs and wonders and ministering and this and that and the other thing in perfect unity and we know that unity because on the the day of Pentecost they only had one that was supposed to speak and they didn't fight about it Peter comes up he stands up nobody's saying hey let me do it Peter I got this Peter stands up and he speaks so well and the Lord moves so powerfully that they added 3,000 souls in one day not 3,000 souls that went away but 3,000 souls and then it K continued there and they build it up and it moved out and all of a sudden the the priests are worried why because this church has sprung up so quickly and it's powerful it has a life that follows behind it amen it's a very wonderful thing that was the Alpha Church amen and you say how do you know that was the Alpha Church because look at what he said to Saul when he knocked him off of his horse he said Paul why do you persecute persecute me he identified them as himself Paul wasn't persecuting Christ the man that had died and rose again he was persecuting a church he was persecuting a body of believers but when Christ knocks him off the horse and speaks from that light he says Paul Saul why do you persecute me he identifies them as the same as him so that is the Alpha Church that we see so you see a pattern now you see a Christ ministry and then you see the church that follows an expression in a multi-member body amen the only reason they didn't go in a rapture was because God's plan was to spread it out into all eight all ages and all generations and all tongues and nations it had to go everywhere I think we're very close now I think there's only a couple left not just people but there are some tribes and nations that haven't heard yet and they're trying very hard to get to them but that is the last thing when that's done we get to go when the last one's brought in causes the door hey that's filthy be filthy still he that's holy be holy still amen they started out perfectly but they too had to die why so that there could be another rising come up in the end right revelation 2 he's speaking to the the Church of Ephesus he says nevertheless have somewhat against thee because thou hast left thy first love the Holy Spirit had perfect unity and was was working perfectly the gifts were there to keep the church clean and all these things he says what you left your first love the Wolves Paul warned they I fear that the wolves have gotten in among you and they're tearing you apart and you know the plans of men are starting to have their effect on that and that's what happened was they started replacing the true baptism of the Holy Spirit the indwelling life of God with what the deceits in the slate of of men as we talked about earlier there's a plan that they were saying we can leverage this we can use this to our own benefit and the Holy Spirit just slowly started backing away and then they went down right they started dying and so we see it here remember the light is here and in the beginning it would have been perfectly white because there under perfect fellowship perfect unity right they were all with one Accord in the in the upper room all in wondercore that's the unity of the spirit right there so that's perfectly light but by the time they end him 8170 they lost the majority of the power within the church right and so what happens now darkness comes in until we get to the fourth church age and that's when it's fully rotten there was no power there in the fourth church age there's virtually nothing happening it was a very select few but now as it starts to rise up is that rotting is complete now the life starts to come forth again and in this age we get the full manifestation now I want you to see here that he we show a bit of light but when the angel drew this out on the wall for brother Brandon was there any light at seven church age why not because at the end we read in revelation three he's outside the church if he's outside the church how can he be in here because God did work through the churches through here where are we I don't want to calm organizations but there were groups of people that he was using there right he'd use Martin right Martin Luther and these different ones right he would use them so he's working in a group but then they always denominated and threw him out again but here he gets out and he's thrown out for the last time and that's why we say we're no longer a part of Laodicea when you come out of that now you're into a bright age because that's the only place that Christ is Christ is no longer working in the church he says come out of her my people stands outside the door knocks amen amen so in between the planting here right they died and they're planted there's this necessary process that it has to go through to go all the way through rotting so that it can then start to grow back in in fullness and newness amen so at no point does ever Christ fully manifested in here he started here and there's nothing here you have brief moments they had signs and wonders all throughout here it's not that it's not just signs and wonders but it's a perfect expression of Christ it's a fully overcoming power in your life that will give us the full expression here right so that he can use you not just preeminence in you but preeminence in a group and use you powerfully because as a group we're way stronger than we are individually amen I'm dancing around my notes here amen but this is the point is that he makes this mighty manifestation here and then he makes it here in this bride age and that's the only place he says I'm gonna do it I'm Alpha and Omega Christ in the beginning Christ in the end but in the middle he's just doing a partial work if we could put it that way it's a dark dismal day like Zacharias says in chapter 14 verse 7 he says but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at the evening time it shall be light all right so we see here now at the end time what is it it's very dark over here but he says there's an evening light that comes here and that's where the bride is found amen then as we as brother Jared was saying like don't just see the light walk in the light to see the lighthouse at a distance is no good if you don't you don't heed what's going on there he says what walk in the light so that that end is what we're looking for him in and what is it that happened he sends a prophet with a message to do what not draws to the prophet but to point us back to the work and to show us what's supposed to happen these days to show us all those things that happened so we can recognize where we are today right so what is the what is the Covenant he's coming to fulfill it's that Alpha and Omega but it has two phases we know this right we know that Ministry of brother Branham was brought back to what turned the hearts of the children back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers that's what he said not the Pentecostal church today but the original Pentecost which is the Holy Spirit moving in his people amen because what he says it behold I will send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children John's ministry and the hearts of the children to their fathers that's the second Elijah that the the following Elijah lest I come and smite the earth with a curse and then we know where was to reveal the the mysteries of the seven seals part of revelation 10 chapter 10 verse 7 because it says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished now what is the mystery of God the mystery of God remember Paul says this Christ in you the hope of glory right we have ministry sitting here and there talking about the mysteries the seven seals is no brother this is in you the seventh seal is not at words on a page it's not a mystery that that Satan could corrupt and that's why brother Branham says you can't write it down because otherwise Satan were corrupted but what does he do he writes it in the fleshly tables of your heart he puts it inside of you and gives us an inheritance incorruptible so that we can now Express the mystery he says what the mystery should be finished completed right Alpha Omega he says as he had declared to his servants the prophets but before he did that he had to break the seven seals and without those seven seals you can't go into that rapture because that's what gives us rapture in faith now why is it give us rapture in faith because it tells us this is rapture time everybody else in Christianity is believed well not all of them actually that's the scary thing they're believing for a rapture some of them after the tribulation so that's definitely not going to happen and that one's that are believing before it comes it comes before the tribulation but if they don't know that this is rapture season how are they going to have wrap between faith because they're believing for a way and any time rapture amen but we know we have a word that comes to us and says today is rapture season and then this is the time that I have declared and now is when you want to be looking for a rapture not with hope but with expectation with a revelation with the knowledge that today is the day and if it's not today it's tomorrow with a certainty that he is going to come and take a spotless bride away amen so this Omega promise is nothing less than the promise that we will be a church with the full life and expression of God collectively collectively and I want to hit that again if we are sitting at home we are not going in this rapture I'm sorry a brother came to our church and said one of the most amazing things I've ever heard he said in the scripture a sheep by itself is always described as lost sheep by itself is always described as lost a sheep by itself will not survive it needs a shepherd it needs the great Shepherd but he gave us Shepherds here on earth to handle that situation amen and then that one's for free we have a pastor here so we're okay amen the brown said this and Jehovah Jireh says God was showing there to Abraham that through his seed that God Himself will become flesh and then have to be separated at Calvary where Christ being God on earth he was separated God tore him apart the royal seed of Abraham and took the life out of him and raised up the body up to sit on his throne in heaven and sent back the spirit of him upon the church that the church has to have the same spirit that was in Christ to make it come together you cannot unify in this body unless you have the Spirit of Christ they meant making Christ now listen to this hallelujah says making Christ the same yesterday today and forever brother Brown what do you talk about he said my message is to declare him that he's here Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever yesterday Jesus Christ we have a prophet company shows us Christ in our day but he says forever so after he's gone there has to be at Christ that continues on this earth named as in and is expressed in the exact same way he says I'm the he says God separated he says listen us he says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and further confirmation of the Covenant God confirming the Covenant that is what he's talking about here in Revelation 10 God's separating tearing the life from crisis on taking the spirit out of him as he cut those animals into standing between them the light God Himself went between them showing that he separated the body the seed the roll seed and took the spirit and sent it back upon the church and the Church of today that goes to meet Christ will have to have the same spirit that he had because it'll have to be letter by letter word by word why he is the word jesus said he personal pronoun that believes in me the works that I do shall he do also confirming the Covenant the life that's in Christ will be in the church the Royal seed of Abraham so this end time is what Christ the Anointed One manifesting himself in an Omega church as he did in the Alpha Church amen and we know in our day he came just as he did in that day he came as Christ make no mistake that message and that Ministry of William Branham was Christ coming down but they turned it into worship of a prophet and it had nothing to do with that prophet that was Christ there when he stands and he turns his back and does exactly what he did in the days of Abraham and Sarah right before when the Covenant coming forth when he said the promise is for you and you I'm gonna make a great nation of you and sale we'll have a child what do you do right before he comes he turns his back and he listens and guess what what does he hear he hears doubt right how is this going to happen and then this mystery and flesh how is this going to happen how is life going to come forth he says in the time appointed right in the season appointed now I'm going to come forth and and Sarah right I've come down and Sarah now is going to bring forth a child she's gonna bring forth the life that he promised amen that's what brother Branham does he stands there he gives the word he points us to our place and then he stands he turns around and he says what Christ is here he doesn't just say it but he shows it in a way that nobody else did before take no ecology could prove him wrong before they have wireless this and miniature that and CIA technology and all these things before it was ever there he stands there he walks through and he discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart why to say Christ is here not me a son a man revealing these son of men why there was doubt in the people as the scripture says when the Son of Man comes will he find faith not just faith we need faith for healing why to get to a rapture right that healing is just the earnest of our of our new body and how are you gonna have rapturing faith if you don't know that now is the time right something's got to be pulling on you you've got to be looking for the better Brown talks ye says before God does something he sends the Holy Spirit with an unction to the people to have what calling for calling for it how many are out there today calling for a rapture how many of them are out there say is brother JL was talking about last night I am raptured I am I am lifted up I am raised up I have been what resurrected how many are saying that we say it because we know it is time but we've got to make sure it's an experience of our time not just a knowledge of it right this let's face it the message books are open there's nobody stopping anybody from going in there and reading them and catching the truth and then but you've got to have an experience that matches what he's talking about so this rob stream faith is what knowing that this is the time and he's doing the work of me and I'm seeing that rapture unfold in my body amen so we saw that as that what that that sheaf offering that's what Christ was right before that that Pentecostal church came he was what he was that sheaf offering the first board and then he moves into them and he does the same works and then in our age he comes he does the exact same ministry right the exact same ministry unfolding in his in the words that he spoke in the sense that if he said it it was true I remember a story where a sister was at the meetings and her friend went up and under discernment brother bottom he gave her name and he gave her her address and the sister that was sitting in the in there knew her address and she said that's wrong he's wrong on her address and she went up to the sister afterwards after she'd been healed of all things and and said um you don't live there how come didn't correct him she said I moved last week I moved last week and he told her what the address was where she lived right never proven wrong why because the word is speaking and the word cannot fail he meant the words of a mountain will fail right I don't pretend to think that the message in every single one of those books is perfect in and of itself but the word that he brought forth that he matched up to Scripture he corrects those errors and he brings us down he points us to the word said I can now go in here and I can preach directly from this I was talking with our brother here and I said would we be able today to walk into a message church and not read a quote what we have the maturity to say this is an open book and if I never read you from a quote again will we be able to accept it would you be able to because he didn't point us to the message books he didn't say if you want to get closer to God plate he didn't say play the tapes he said read your Bible and pray so what the Holy Spirit if he's come he's going to lead you into all truth while we believe that those messages were opening up the truths that were already in here but you don't have to read a message book to have truth in the sense that that is not our absolute it is the scripture that is our absolute and we've got to be able to line it up in here talking with brother mark about this he says he doesn't like to throw quotes back and forth why because the quotes are not my absolute I'm sorry I disagree with jeffersonville on that the quotes are not the absolute the Word of God as he's expressing here that's what he says if you add one word or take one word away he says that's when you're in trouble amen so anything that points us to the word I'll take it but we've got to go back to the word on it amen amen so this is the restoration covenant to Malachi for is an Omega church not just the son of man ministry because that's what he does but we don't just look to the son of man ministry but what that he is restoring the hearts of the children to the father's and then he's bringing us back into a condition that he had before but what did the opening of the seals show because what is the opening of the seals what is it revealing program said the church ages was was the church and how things move through history but he says the seals were Christ Christ moving through the churches now I want to ask you do you think they saw the great plan of God when they're here in the Dark Ages how many of them saw the purpose of God as they were down there how about in the First Church ages they were slaughtered right as they walked willingly into the the arenas and they were cut down one by one and mothers losing their children and cut in half and and all these different things they did not see the purpose in the plan of God but in the last stage he comes here and he says this is what I was doing all through it and that's why a prophet can call the Holocaust the tender hand of Jehovah because he can see the purpose and the plan of God and what he's doing not only in the Gentiles but he's he gives us a little nugget of the Jews but he points us there so that we can see what he was doing through here and how we had it and we lost it and the effects of those loss and the different things that he's having to restore he goes there but he shows us that that Christ was in it all so that even when you don't see him even when you look at yourself and you can't see Christ yet Christ is there that he is moving whether or not you recognize it and that he is not going to be frustrated by the way things are here he's not going to be stopped he's not going to be slowed down but the plan of God is going to move on regardless right so when it seems like nothing is happening or worse when it seems like we're going backwards that does not mean God is not moving what it says he'll withhold no good thing from his kid from his children says all things work together for the good of them that are the called so when we don't see the purpose when we don't see the plan these seven seals are open so that we can say it looked miserable through here and look miserable and then look at what God had God did there and look what he achieved and look how he cut away this and look how he took away that look how he brought you back to this and that and the other things so that what we could see even though it doesn't appear sometimes that were closer than we were yesterday or last month or last year yet God is moving I was talking again with by mark and sister Moria I said that sometimes the the greatest benefit of being in fellowship with people and being in the body of Christ is that they can see a change in you far better than you can they can see what God is doing in your life far better than you can because for you it's just a millimeter a day but they don't see you maybe for a couple days or a week or these different things or they may have seen you react a certain way in a situation last year and then this whole thing comes around because that's what God does is you react poorly and he brings it back around again after he's worked on you a bit to see if you'll react the proper way and he'll keep you in that cycle until you do it and guess what one day you pass the cycle and you move on everyone says what happened to Paul Coffey Paul doesn't even know he doesn't even realize what's happened right but mark I just had wonderful Prussia we talked about that Roman we were you know the little woman bill brown talked about people went in they came out and things have been restored and changed and healed they said what happened we don't know let me tell you how you got over that besetting sin tell me how you got over it tell me how you got over your temper how tell me how you got over your complexes tell me how you got healed you can't do it but he does it and it's indescribable but when he does it you know you know what he's put that limb back you know when he's replaced something you know when he's cut that tumor out of your life but you can't tell me how he did it can't tell you how he did it but he did it that's what he's saying here that's why he opened all this up though it looks like he did nothing yet he was moving through it all he had a purpose and a plan because in this age the the most wicked the most complex the most difficult age it's gonna look sometimes like we're not getting anywhere it's not what we're getting it's good where he's getting us in it right that's why they embraced these trials and these temptations that come our way because why God's doing a work in us amen amen hallelujah Philippians 1:6 says being confident of this very thing that he which he which had begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Christ you know what that tells me you're only going to be done the day we go when anybody says I'm ready to go we're ready to go in the sense that we want to get out of here amen but we're not ready to go until we go because the day we go we're all ready to go as a unified body not just one or two or three but each one of us is step perfectly in so that we have that perfect statue of a man in it under the headship of Christ amen what faith that ought to build up to it in us that he is not going to stop until he's done and when he's done he's done and he takes us I believe that's why the scripture says it'll be a quick short work because that end will just be we don't see much happening but I think then things will start to it's like the dominoes little things start to go over I saw video of a demonstration of the power of a small Domino and they started out with this tiny little Domino you know and I want to say was about an inch tall and they put it next to one that was this tall and then one that was next to this tall and I think the ratio was one two three so if this was one this would be three this would be nine and on and in the end they had a domino that was this tall and weighed something like six hundred pounds I think and you know what they did they tipped this one and it hits with just enough force to this one and knocks that one down and this one and it's just enough to get it there but it just starts speeding up as it goes and boom the last one goes and it's done the smallest little victory builds you up to the next victory in the next trial and then as that falls down this one but let me tell you is that time starts to hit and things start to click and all of a sudden it's not a battle it used to be and things step in front of you and you now start to speak to that what they start to fall quicker and quicker and quicker and then you go into eternity and you're done amen amen hallelujah now I've got something on my page amen amen within pretty much within everything but within the message I feel we're particularly good at pointing to what God did and it's a wonderful thing but I think sometimes it's our greatest failing because we're so busy looking at what has been done that we're not focused on what's going on now and we're really good at looking towards the future is anybody looking for the rapture and then I don't think it's just me we're looking forward to it but brother Brown said this he says they always miss it man is forever praising God for what he did do looking forward to what he will be and ignoring what he is doing that's just the nature of man he hasn't changed his nature the man of the world I told Joe today a ship doesn't sail on yesterday's wind yesterday's victory isn't going to push you today you've got to be victorious day over day there's got to be a dying out that happens day after day can't be he healed me last year or he delivered me this no no what's he doing today as your faithful what is he doing it to you and responding and faithfulness back came in this is here now this is today and that's why you know this is where the rubber starts to meet the road and tomorrow especially God willing but we don't want to be looking back we don't want to rest in what he's done and leave it there because that should be the faith that tells us what he's doing now and that as that unction comes across us so we would now look in expectation for the needs that we see for the deliverance that we require for the salvation that's needed within our families amen all of these things it should be pushing us to look for those victories in to claim them amen and like Abraham though he sees nothing to speak of them in faith until they come to fruition 25 years 25 years and it was only in the 24th year that God comes down and personally confirms it but in the time between him giving that and after and him coming down there's all sorts of things there's more separation there's more trials right there's infighting there's him trying to make it happen on his own there's people fighting over the land that he's been promised right you've got destruction of his family and saving to them but they still don't come in and they create an incest shoot incestuous tribe it's a mess right and then the 24th year he comes down and he says now is the time and Sarah says it's way too late it's way too late I'm dried up we haven't had pleasure together for him forever right that year she goes off and a king takes her as his bride because she's so beautiful as a 94 year old Oh [Music] 94 years old and the king is taking her over the 21 year olds Blanca shared this with me I hope it's not too much over the pulpit as women grow older the age of a man they find attractive grows with them so they always prefer a man that's younger than them but you know as they're 20 they're like a 20 year old as a 30 maybe they'd like a 25 year old so you go 40 they like maybe a 30 year old and that goes up as they go man 21 year olds all the way across that's what they like so you're telling me that there wasn't a change in Sarah before that promise came forth when a king has all the 21 year olds to pick from and he picks the 94 or the 9 year old I guess he'd be 90 and 100 right 89 years old there we go 89 years old and she's walking around the King and saying hmm hmm it's wrong it's just wrong you think but yet there was a body change in Sarah that happened as that process came forth and that's what we're looking for is what this badger skin starts to follow away more and more and more until what Christ has the full preeminence and the fullness of the promise comes forth amen so we've already said this is not of our doing this is a grace grace grace this is Christ doing it but there is something that we have to do while we're here it's got to be through his power through his anointing his direction but we have a part to play now the scripture says we are sinless perfect and spotless but did you know it's not enough to be sinless perfect and spotless what's sinless perfect and spotless all right if I erase everything off of this that sinless perfect and spotless what's the good of it that just means I stand and there's nothing to nothing to indict me but that's useless that's useless just because I have his righteousness that doesn't do me any good I'm not doing anything with it I'm just standing there and saying yeah nobody can condemn me but he didn't make you perfect and spotless and sinless so that you could stand around or so that you could sit on your hands amen it's not enough to say I'm a child of God and I have the seed of God it's not enough to say that he's my dad and I am his son he's my father and I am his daughter what he has to confirm that he to now bring you into the family business he has to take you now from a child and adopt you in that Eastern tradition of adoption where he brings you in and says now I recognize you and I'm going to bring you in to do the same thing that I did a man even Christ was perfect but he had a work to do in his perfection there was now something to do I've heard it said the Holy Spirit the baptism of the Holy Spirit the indwelling of the Holy Spirit we could put it that way is not the end of your work it's the start of your work because that's at the point where he can actually use you and trust you and we see that with Jesus he he takes him and he puts them in into into the Jordan River he comes down so this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased and they takes him off and runs him into the desert drives him into the desert for forty days and nights and tempts him there to prove him and then later on he confirms him so the the the the indwelling of the Holy Spirit we could put that way is only the start of the work right it's only the start of what you have to do what God is going to do in you on this earth amen buh-bam said this in blind bottommost he said Jesus with his head back walking on the priest screaming at him making fun of him and others crying Hosanna but did you notice the whole burden of all the world rested upon him Calvary the dark hours in Gethsemane lay before him and all as he went he never noticed their scoffing you know when someone says something evil about you and you want to take it up and get angry about it that shows you aren't quite deep enough yet with God that hurts who thou burn your hide off on it how many of us can say that when somebody comes up against us we can say yeah that's no big deal because it hurts doesn't it hits our emotions hits our pride right that shows you haven't went quite deep enough yet with God big men let me say there's big women but not big women but mature fully grown adults they don't do those things that's what made him God to me he was big he didn't have to notice their little scarfing he had a purpose he had a work to do and that was to fulfill what God had sent him to do and he was determined to do it he didn't care what anyone said so that was what his work was to do and he had to give his life it's the most difficult thing to do but he says now this is what a big person will do this is what a grown person is this what a mature person will do is ignore the scoffing ignore the little hurts right as iron sharpens iron this scripture says that's what's happening as we're here amongst each other we're not here because we're all perfect we're here because we're unified in our purpose and that running together a brother and brother and sister and sister sometimes it hurts a little bit but what's he doing knocking off the rough edges God is not above using your brother or sister to knock some Christ into you in some of the world out of you amen we could all use a little bit of humbling sometimes that's for sure now Christ now in his work he defeated everything right he defeated depression he defeated oppression he defeated sickness he defeated death himself when he rose but he defeated death with with Lazarus right and then and the widow's son and named temporarily they still died but he showed he had full control over those things before he goes and even then he didn't give say Satan didn't take his life Christ said I lay it down willingly I lay it down to myself amen but we have to overcome just as he did and it's not just over because remember he's in a perfect body but we're in a carnal body so we still have to overcome those principalities and powers but now we have to overcome ourselves and the effects of those things within us as well amen we have to overcome the Laodicean influences of this church age because we've got to come out of it but to come out of it you have to overcome it you can't overcome it and stay in it but you have to overcome it to get out of it because it's got a hold on you right rich and increases Goods and have need of nothing and they said but you're spiritually destitute and we know there is an overcoming revelations 3:21 says to him that overcometh the latest CNH will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm set down with my father in his throne so she identified how does she overcome she takes the word for a day and applies it to her life that is how she does it because the the revelation 3 tells us exactly how to overcome the lady to see an age and move into that bride body amen 1 you have to answer the knock but he says here's the process he says I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayst be rich and white raiment that thou mayst be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou mayest see you won't see this without the ICF it's not going to happy he says and as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent we'll talk about that last bit tomorrow Lord willing but wait wait white raiment we know speaks of the righteousness of God but Paul and 2nd Corinthians 5 also calls it our theophany that is the ultimate expression of the white raiment is what our new bodies right he says I saw speaks of revelation or spiritual understanding so he says you're going to have to have revelation but notice both of those things he says are free he tells you to buy of me gold tried in the fire and then he says I didn't get these other two things as well right white raiment and I said those are free because you can't buy them you notice the scripture doesn't say go to those that sell revelation no no revelation is only given by God and only God has the righteousness that you'll need to go in this rapture amen that is all that you can get that from as him and he has to give it freely and he does give it freely but he says you have to buy of me gold tried in the fire why because there is a price that must be paid for this gold and we know that that's godly character first Peter 1:7 says that the trial of your faith being much more precious precious than a gold that perisheth they'll be tried with power might be found unto praise and honor and glory at the appearing of Christ Jesus at the appearing of Christ Jesus so he's Tainan now to an event this godly character is tied to an event so they remember that the the earth is burned by fire right the cleansing is always by fire so you can burn later you can burn now and what you have to be burned by what the Holy Spirit the fire of God coming in and burning out the dross of your life so that you can have this godly character and what is our battle our battle is to Express perfectly but to do it in a badger skin that is that battle with us day in and day out like Paul said yesterday there I find there a law there and when I would do good evil is with me so that's the constant battle the back and forth and the back and forth between those things and when we do that the the process of those two things the carnal battery battling with the supernatural within you the process of that developed something called character right and when they when Christ wins its godly character and with Jonathan curl up wins its idolatry because what I've done is I've placed something now ahead of Christ and that's taking preeminence in my life and now I'm worshipping something other than the word so character godly character is when the word has preeminence and that's the only way you can define it because anything else is idolatry because that's what's in influence in your life amen so what is the price of that character what do we have to pay to win this battle self will my thoughts my ideas my own survival instincts my own carnal inclinations my own comfort nobody ever willingly goes into discomfort with human nature you will not enter into discomfort unless you can see a reward that's worth it you just won't do it why do people go into the gym and sweat and workout for 30 minutes or an hour it's because there's something that they want on the other end that's worth more than the pain that they're going into but you've got to see the benefit in it to go do it and so we don't willingly choose to go into things usually to develop godly character why because we don't know what it's going to take for our life and so God has to drive us into those things and push us into those things so he can bring out using the tools that he has at his disposal him in us and that's the only way we can do it we won't willingly go into something that takes us through a godly trial look at what my sister went through recently cancer stage 4 cancer how many here would say yeah I'm going to get into stage 4 cancer here so that I can develop faith nobody's going to do it we're not willingly going to step into that but we have to be willing to go through it and trust him as we go through it learn the lesson come out the way he's looking for or else he's going to just run us the fire all over again amen brother branham said this he says unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reign the reason for that is that character simply is never made without suffering he says character is a victory not a gift and that's where you see these trust fund babies not naming any names or people that are wealthy and they give their kids everything but they don't have to work for it you will never find character in those people because there's no appreciation they didn't have to work for it they don't understand the sacrifice that's behind it and so they spend it willy-nilly right they just go and do whatever and they get into pleasures of the of the flesh rather than going and dwelling on those things that are worth they just they'll never do it it can't happen it's the Word of God so where God's not me saying that's what he's saying is you can't do that you have to go through a fire to appreciate what you have it's a victory says a man without character can't rain because power apart from character is satanic but power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and is set down in his Father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him scripture says he learned by the things that he suffered so then the little temporary hallelujah temporary we know there is an end to it and there's a purpose the little temporary suffering that we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes all what treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter his kingdom through much tribulation I want to read that again all what treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter his kingdom through much tribulation a man of character is a victory that means there is a battle you can't have a victory unless there's a fight that happens first amen and as we said earlier the first victory is over the inner man to where you surrender to Christ the Holy Spirit comes in after that he's working in your body he's cleaning out your life then after that he moves on he brings you now into the work of the Father amen so that character is a victory when everything about Jonathan Kurla has died and in its place Christ reigns ray not rest but rains right he's in every door in every portion of my life he's in there and there's full access and there's no hiding it from him there's no desiring to hide it from because he's in every room amen like I said the product of that battle is called character where it's my will versus his will and when his will comes in that's where godly character happens amen so every day we're going to express that and this is where the rubber starts to meet the road as you say how do I know that Christ has the preeminence in with in me well look at what you do and look at how you spend your time are you doing it for kingdom purpose or are you doing it for other purposes how are you ruling the kingdoms that are that you have in front of you right now for every man that's married now his first kingdom is his family and if you rule and reign over that properly then maybe God will add to it but he's still waiting for us to show ourselves faithful and the smaller things it's not a small thing when God gives you a wife and children that's not a small thing that is your first ministry and if you can rule and reign there as Christ would have you to in love right then after that he'll start to add to those things right what do we do at our jobs what is our confession at our jobs what is our expression of Christ at our jobs what do we do in our spare time what does our entertainment look night look like all of these things show where the preeminence is in our lives and guess what we're not out of here so no one in here is able to say I've got the preeminence everywhere nobody none of us can do it we're all subject to this battle and when the battle is over that's when we leave but until then until that day that's sticky flesh of ours that just latches onto so many things we'll be fighting it day in and day out I noticed the newest operating system for the iPhone has screen time on it does anybody know about this probably turn it off like me because it pricks your conscience when you look at it and you realize that all those bathroom breaks and all those little moments where you just want to sit down and veg imitate right they add up in a day I'll tell you it pricked my conscience the first time I looked at that realize how much time I spent on my phone I'm not a big heavy phone user in general but it still adds up and I thought to myself what would happen if I had the same preeminence towards Christ and the things of the kingdom so that instead of sitting down and saying oh maybe I can fit a little game in or maybe I'll check Facebook or maybe upload my first selfie to Instagram what if I said I can charge up with a scripture so-and-so needs prayer maybe I can just bow my head for a few minutes you know what I could really use something right now and now go on my open my Bible on my phone I've got the full message and Bible on my phone I have no excuse I have everything on that I'd ever need to want to to want to dwell on the the things that God's doing amen but I looked at that and I was shocked and how that adds up and we're trying to fit into our lives and then we look at our phones and we see we spend 17 hours on it in the last week 17 hours doing what I guarantee 95% of his absolutely useless it got you know closer to God and most chances it probably put you further away right you're always moving forward or backward and I looked at that and I didn't like it so I turned it off no it did I didn't but it's a check cuz every month it fires it up and says hey you want to see how many hours you spent on your phone it averages it it tells you the apps that you used on all these things right so what I like to do now is instead of reading the message I listen to it on the table app on my phone because that gives me credit for it on my phone right I got I got proof I listen to messages this week it's there right I can see it all in there so unfortunately that's not the record God's going to look at but it helps me sometimes amen amen amen this battle is about a land being taken because what he's got a conquer here I know that I remember when brother Allen Kader was preaching one time and he he was preaching on job and he said Satan came before God and he said Satan where've you been he said walking to and fro in the earth and brother Allen cares up he said rocking to and fro in the earth like this right your body he says what's he doing is walking through there he's stomping all over our land he's stopping all over this earthly flesh what trying to take dominion over it and this is the Dominion that we have to take this is why we're talking about when he says the preeminence this Jonathan Collette has to come under submission the land of Jonathan core let the life of Jonathan Carlat has to be defeated it has to be defeated I'm not trying to defeat Satan I'm trying to defeat Jonathan Kralik because when he's out of the way Satan doesn't have a chance but Satan's trying to link Jonathan Colette into the battle with him so we can push Christ out so they're pushing and pulling at me saying who are you gonna listen to who you gonna listen to who you're gonna obey what are you going to do with this what are you gonna do with this Christ right day in and day out and they're pulling me back and forth back and forth and what happened we have a prophet comes in this day and he has the title deed he says hey the title deeds open I'm gonna read out of the title deed to you now I'm gonna show you what's in the title deed he says I'm gonna walk through the land a little bit ahead of you just to show you and he does what he casts out Devils he defeats all these different things I mean there was nothing that came up in front of brother Branham that he didn't defeat there was nothing that God wouldn't honor his prayer for in vindicating that prophet up to an including homosexuality that's one that scares people to death today and I don't blame him because it's a pervasive spear and it's a part of the age but remember that that young man that came up and he met him I believe up in Alaska or someplace and he took him back there he prayed for him he didn't tell anybody what it was but that's what it was he told he told one or two people and they let him know what was going on there and it was that homosexual spirit cast it out of him we've got we've got brothers in this message and I'm sure there are sisters as well that have fought with that very same thing you know what that God never left there was nothing that came before him including remember that man that tried to break up the meeting and and what happened the spirit of Lord spoke up and said you're challenging me right it's not he wasn't challenging brother Brahim he was challenging Christ and he says you have to bow before me and he couldn't do anything before him right full dominion was given to him right there we'll get into that a little bit tomorrow Lord willing but there's a line that has to be conquered we have to conquer ourself and then when that's conquered now we walk into that land right in the full promises of God and moving as he would have us move in these different things but the problem is again this this this thing that annoys us so much is time because when they went into the land or before they went in God says behold the land of Canaan which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession then in Joshua says every place that the sole of foot shall tread and that which I've given you if I as I have said unto Moses right so we've got a Moses comes in our day he reads the title deed and remember in Moses day Joshua wasn't the one that said where all the tribes to go God laid that out for Moses and then Moses gives that to Joshua so he lays out all the title deed who goes where what they're gonna do what they have there you know the strengths and all the all these different things he's got it all laid out what that man looks like nice is go in and take it everywhere that the solar foot shall tread so imagine some of them said I've got my Fitbit on I'm gonna do my 10,000 steps for the day I'm just gonna walk in and by the time I'm done I'm gonna have a quarter section of land and things are gonna be good to go praise the Lord do you know how long it took them to conquer is conquer Cain until the point where they could start settling it about 10 years they figure 10 years from the time they started to the time that Joshua said alright you're on your own now ten years and do you think God told them at the beginning that there were gonna be believers that died when did the first believer die second Battal disobeyed in the first battle and went in and died in the second battle right but was it when they went into AI and a kentuc they went in when they were in Jericho he took that out right he took the Babylonian garment and the these different things and buried it what was he took something that they were supposed to destroy and tried to use it right God said you can't have it this is a pure word this is a pure people you can't do it and what he was killed and his wife and his children they all paid the price for it right what about the ones that didn't actually want to go into the land and they said no we're gonna take an inheritance back across the Jordan didn't tell him that that was going to happen did he didn't tell me there were gonna be those that got tired and quit and didn't push everyone out of their land he didn't tell him that he said it's yours go take it but that's not what it looked like for those ten years did it there was a process now of taking that land and I guarantee you when they got the end of it they were sick and tired of fighting even the first victory was so amazing Jericho didn't even have to do anything they just had to walk silently or they had to walk around and around and around around then the walls came down right like I said they got there ten thousand steps on their Fitbit every day and when they did it for seven days they did a really long walk and the walls came tumbling down can you imagine after that first victory they probably had that expectation that every wall was going to come down like that you notice early on in your walk a lot of times the victories come easy don't think because God's just what confirming to you that he's got your back but then he starts to pull back and he says look there's a work for you to do they go up the cities and they lay siege to it they'd have to starve them out it's the way we need to overcome some things in our lives to starve them out scripture talks about if your eye offend thee pluck thee pluck it out right if you've got something in your life that's causing you to have a beset in sin you need to get rid of what's allowing you access to it and sometime that's a confession sometimes that's being accountable to somebody else and sometimes it's the technology that we use isn't it sometimes it's the friends that we have right I've seen so many people and they're willing to cut off their friends and all of a sudden their walk with God starts to take off because that influence isn't there anymore right they're hanging around with the right people and all of a sudden boom things just start to flower and grow amen but it wasn't easy to take the rest of Canaan he does a miracle takes them across the Jordan without getting their feet wet knocks down the first city and then they have the first death in the second battle then after that they're fighting and they're waiting and it takes years and years and years and years and there's no rest there's no rest that's what we're facing today is we're in the long dreary fight for what's written in the title deed because we have to have a victory here before we go over there amen before we have rest we don't get our rest here our rest is in Christ here there we have rest for the three and a half years and then we come back with him we've got a work to do thousand years and then we have the full you know you're into eternity then right time is the difficulty that we face him in but what happened there was one in there there was one in there that after was all done he wasn't tired I mean that was Caleb Caleb was a type of that bride and what happened he comes up to Joshua being a type of the Holy Spirit and he says look Moses came to me and he says that mountain is for you Caleb I'll give it to you and your families he says when you come back in that one's for you we're saving that for you so now he goes up to the Holy Spirit to Joshua and he says now give me my Mountain I've helped everyone else with theirs but now is a time for me to take what you've promised me I believe there will be some of these things that we've been holding on to and we've been believing for for so long and at that end we go up and we say now is the time the time is close and now it's time for you to give me what your word is promise what your Holy Spirit is told me is mine when you promised in that prophet when he came he said this is for you amen into every one that that I'm going to call afar off and these different things right well we got today that's what happened we had a Moses come we had a prophet came they told us all about that land and we got to walk around in it a little bit and then they said no it's not for us but now we have the Holy Spirit comes and he takes us into there and what do we have to do we have to say I'm not tired well Caleb says he says it's been what 40 years he says and I'm as strong as the day that I was first here this Caleb was going back to the first place that they got the firstfruits from I said I know I spoke about this last time he went to the place where they had the biggest Giants the one that had put fear into the light into the end of the children of Israel was where he wanted that was in Hebron I believe that was where they got the grapes from but that was the biggest Giants in the land was where Caleb wanted to go he's not in fear then he says now is my time right I'm not tired out I'm still ready to go now it's time to give me my mountain amen amen the musicians can come as we start to close here I mean that's where we are now our Moses is off the scene but the Holy Spirit is still here to guide us into that place amen but what's it got to be there's got to be a preeminence in there there's got to be a willingness for us to sacrifice every thought every idea every purpose every plan you know what I ain't choosing to be behind this pulpit and you're going to be placed in situations and the call of God for what you're gonna have to do in your life and it will not be by your choice or preference I'm sorry that's not the way it's gonna be and if you're expecting it you might as well get ready because the Hammers coming right he's gonna mold you and make you into what he needs you to be but when you stand in the place that he's put you now you can speak with confidence and authority because you given him what he asked for and now the kingdom comes out from you amen amen the last Scripture Habakkuk 2 it says I will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and we'll watch to see what he will say unto me and when I shall answer when I am reproved and the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it not that he may sit still but that he may run what's written in the vision what's written on these tables is going to make us move it's going to put us into action him and it's gonna do some make us do something he says for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though it Terry wait for it I feel we're in a Terry situation in many ways right now we're looking and we're waiting and we're an expectation and we're making small steps but we're looking for the big one we're looking for that big step we're tearing to wait for what the fullness of what he's promised to come to pass in us amen they says wait for it why because it will surely come will not tarry he's going to hold it but there's going to be a day when he releases everything and then the doors close and we're out of here amen let's stand together Bram said this and the identified masterpiece of God he says the great sculptor is counting on you willing to stand and have yourself self shaped into the likeness of his requirement that His Word requires to have yourself shaped willing to stand willing to take it he says in the last days I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy he says Christ as the identified masterpiece of the Word made flesh you are asked to identify yourself in him by the same word to be the masterpiece of the bride he says now brethren God had a masterpiece then to present to the world now he wants a masterpiece today are you willing or are you ready my Christian friend are you really sure that your life is so reflecting for Christ no matter what the world says they say you lost your mind they say you've gone crazy you went and joined that bunch of holy rollers don't you pay no attention to that if you're not really truly saved and in that body and the Word of God in you and reflecting itself and the life of Christ reflecting out of you if you're not in that brother/sister don't you take that chance I don't care what you are what kind of an experience you have let that word reflect through you each day because God in this last days is taking a bride for his son Jesus Christ amen are we willing this morning to stand and let him carve and shape and beat and press and push us until we shine in a fullness of the reflection that he would have us for amen I love sitting in there listening to you worship because you know what anybody else would think you're crazy thank you join that bunch of holy rollers right but we all talked about this go to a game and they're doing way more than that they're painting themselves up there are ugly fat men that take their shirts off and paint their bodies in the colors of their favorite team and they'll stand there and be shown on television for multi millions of viewers while they're screaming and wiggling their fat bellies and were crazy for sitting in here and shouting and praising for a little bit it makes no sense it doesn't make any sense but he says what join that bunch of holy rollers I'm glad I'm with holy rollers tonight amen I'm glad I'm in a place where we have a freedom to express our thankfulness for the grace that God has given us they meant for the blood that He shed and the promise that he is going to finish that masterpiece and all we have to do and this is our part is to say like brother brother Bob close with that song at the beginning said be done to me according to that word and say well whatever your word is for me let me express it I know I can't do it all that's not what you told me but Lord let me express the peace that you have for me and let me give you the preeminence until it shines perfectly just as you anticipated it just as you saw it cuz it's not just he's thinking it's gonna happen he saw it before the foundation of the world this bride is is fully perfect and unified in his sight and all he's waiting for is time to catch up to eternity and it's all perfect and we're out of amen that's just bow our heads Lord God you are so wonderful you are so precious heavenly father Lord that you would take Lord the sinful or that each one of us is bound to live in Lourdes and you would take it and turn it into a new creature Lord that could have a kingdom impact in this world Heavenly Father but though we know we have to give more and more to you Lord we have to surrender and throw away everything that we've ever thought Lord everything that we've ever heard everything we've been taught Lord every instinct that we have Lord and just throw it

it out and put the strongman of the Holy Spirit in there to keep them from coming in again Heavenly Father we want a walk Lord in the kingdom paths that we've had though that as you have that full preeminence so Lord we would start to work in that body to help those that are around us Lord lift up feeble hands Lord we rededicate ourselves to you and new this evening Heavenly Father we say holy spirit have your way Lord to do your purpose Lord in this last age though we looked at those promises we trust them we look for them daily Lord to come into our live store and we say Lord as we sang

the devil's got a leave right then God is here and he's in control so does healing here the needs are met here the burdens are lifted because he's here right [Music] one brother said he said we were born to slaves I ins just like Jake just like Caleb just like Joshua right they were born they were ordained to go in and take on those giants and defeat him because they knew that that was their land
