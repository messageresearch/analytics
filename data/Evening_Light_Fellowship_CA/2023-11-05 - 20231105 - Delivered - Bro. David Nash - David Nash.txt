Brother David Nash here to speak to us over this this weekend and we're we're just trusting the Lord to speak to us once again amen and pray for him and it's always tiring to go three services in a row like this and I know what that's like so just uh just pull amen you you say Lord I have a need on my heart and Lord you see my life you see my situation just speak to me this morning and it may only be one line it may only be one line but he knows nothing about us he knows nothing about your life that's for sure and it'll be Sovereign if you can catch the word of the Lord to you this morning amen so let's just be an expectation amen remembering those that aren't here amongst us let's sing that song draw me draw me Lord and I'll come running as we invite Brother David to the pulpit amen sorry it's [Music] 12:15 you alone are all I [Applause] need for you hold my day Destiny you alone are all I need in you alone I am complete so draw me draw me Lord L and I'll come running after you

come running draw me draw me Lord I'll come running after you amen gracious Heavenly Father we come before you this morning Lord just a soft and sweet Spirit among us and we talk about you drawing us and and bringing us close to you and in you we are found complete and how that we sing Lord As and we're a prayer I Love You Lord because you first loved me and sometimes I don't understand Lord how that all works but I know that somewhere in this life you found me as it were a crippled and broken spirit in life not knowing where to turn not knowing what to do and seeking all of my own ways and my own things and when I found there was nowhere else to go you came to me and brought me home and to this day Lord over 50 years ago that draw is still there that Life of Christ still lives in this man and forever will and for that I'm grateful and above all I want to say thank you and I thank you for bringing me before this people to share that life so we love you and I'm sure there I know there's others here who love you and desire to be of service to you in any way that is found possible in our lives so I give you this service now and as it's said the best thing a preacher can do is get himself out of the way we've travel a long distance but I want to leave again for the next however long you you would choose to speak because I want it to be your words and not my own so we give you this service for your honor and Glory as always in the name of our precious Lord Jesus Christ amen God bless you I'm glad to be back again this morning we uh I've enjoyed being here with you very much uh and the brother given us complete Liberty we've spoken on a few things that to me are are deeper than a lot of times we get to go uh when we're on the foreign field as we explained the other night I think it's 30 countries or maybe 31 that we've spoken in now and often times it's uh kind of rugged I thought we I had them put up we'll put up a couple just just a few pictures go ahead and be seated for a few minutes here and as you look at these things this morning I just a few pictures that we've taken along the way and I only chose the ones that uh out of because whether you know it or not you helped finance this particular Journey that we're on and I wanted you to look at this lady because uh God along the way does some very unusual and tremendous things I had met her two years before in h she's from Honduras and where as you can see simple lady and she's actually standing in the mud because the hurricane had come in the night before we went down to this place to baptize a couple of sisters and this woman when we arrived in Honduras brother Eric guo and I think we might have one of his a picture of him uh was helping to sponsor us there in Honduras when we arrived we were going to we were there for a youth meeting and for that youth meeting uh they were only expecting maybe 40 to 50 kids something like that because the youth meetings were scheduled right after the country's election and over the last few elections they've had a lot of violence because essentially there's two parties or two men and they have a lot of fighting after whoever winds up with the election in this particular election they had a woman also on the ballot well people are so uh fed up with them fighting and killing people over the elections the woman was overwhelmingly elected so there was no violence and uh so when they the other pastors he'd invited quite a few other churches with the young people and and when uh they found out wow day one day two no no violence no violence and so by day three which was Wednesday uh and I think that was Wednesday night was when it was supposed to start they these pastors started calling and said can we bring our our kids and he said well yes they had rented a large School uh area and he said yes we have room we bought bought a lot of food and and so we wound up with I think about 250 kids and as the other pastors came so because of that they went to three meetings a day now three meetings here for a person that does what I do a lot well what's the big deal three services but it's a different draw it's a different pull and so I said well if we're having all these pastors show up why don't you know I'll just take the evening services and then they can have you know the other two Services each day and so that's what we did and that's what we went went to but when I arrived this particular woman was very sick uh the doctors had given her maybe 3 to 5 days to live if that because her kidneys had shut down her liver had shut down she was essentially I guess you could say like living dead they had taken her home and uh laid her on a bed they said she had not moved for TW about 20 days that's their testimony I I wasn't there and so for 20 days they said she had not even moved on the bed and when I got there Eric explained it to me briefly and uh like I said I had met this woman the year before and her kind of her job that she takes on she makes tamali really good tamali and sells them in the marketplace and and uh shares them with people and uh Eric said we need to you know try to get to her and pray for her and well when all these extra youth started showing up there was so many things going on we didn't make it that was like I think he told me I arrived I think on Tuesday and and we didn't make a Tuesday we didn't make it Wednesday and then we had three services a day going on and 250 young people and it was just there was no time cuz she lives out aways from the city there and so Sunday then I had gone down for the morning service into the capital city to Gig gaala and I came back to do the evening service Sunday night and uh Sunday night I happen to think about her and I I asked him wow are we going to be a is she still alive cuz they didn't expect her to live and he said he had called the family and they said well yeah she's still alive she's still breathing more or less and I said well when and he goes I don't know because they had to clear all the stuff out of the school because they're going to have school again so we had to do that clean up on Monday I believe it was Tuesday night before we got to go out there and I had my niece with me and uh she's fluent in Spanish so she was having a good time with the youth and he said well let's go out and see and when we went to the house all the family was gathered in the house because they're expecting her to pass at any time and I got down on the bed and I had to put my ear right down next to her to even hear her breathe and I mean it was like and that well she's still breathing sort of and uh so we prayed for her and I asked of course my niece and brother Eric and his wife and the four of us prayed for her and she didn't really do anything maybe moved just slightly and so about that time here came the whole family into the room and it was a fairly big room they had her in and they were all gathered around watching they didn't know what was going on and so we began to explain to the family well we're here we believe in prayer for the sick we believe God can raise people up and uh he's a Healer and so as we're explaining this to them I just felt well why don't we as the whole family pray for her again and so they were you know they had this like wow okay so the whole family gathered around the bed and we prayed for her a second time and when we when we did she stirred in fact she stirred to the point that she turned her head and kind of whispered to me help me I have faith for this were her words and so we talked just a few more words and stuff with the family and then I turned to brother Eric and I said let's pray one more time so we laid hands on her and I told him that the testimony kind of like the five stones that David used you know with his stripes she's healed uh he sends his word that's why we're here is to bring the word to her and heal the people he's the god that heals all of our diseases Believers lay hands on the sick they shall recover and so we we told that to the family and we prayed and when we prayed the third time she began to try to sit up and said help me and we helped her sit up and she moved to the edge of the bed and said and instructed her family get me a chair so they went and brought her a chair and we had to help her off the bed but she walked of her own accord and sat in the chair and began barking orders to her family bring the stuff so we can make visitors tamali now to me that was an absolute Miracle but I didn't know her side of the story until I went back this last time and you were the sponsors or a big part of the sponsorship for this meeting and this is the woman and we were G had gone here for a baptism and you notice the little fireplace that she's making tamales and coffee you know some of us like like coffee and so she's Oh Brother David you know do you want some coffee and so she's making coffee and tamal's and other stuff for the people and I got to hear her side of the testimony that happened just a little bit before Christmas when we prayed for her and they said at New Year's when she went to they had a New Year's service they said she was dancing and testifying of what God had done for her and her side of the story was she said she was somewhere she said I don't she didn't really know where it was just that it was a very pleasant place and that the first time we prayed she said she heard heard someone praying for her and she said she turned back and then she said the second time that we prayed she re-entered her body and when she re-entered her body the third time we prayed she said the strength came to get up off of that bed to come back and get off the bed and this is the woman and she's very active in still making tamali and coffee and those kind of things and so I wanted you to see that picture because you're part of this and people think oh he's a missionary he just wants money cuz he wants to go do no I like like to see the glory of God manifested and that's a picture of it so I don't know you can go ahead and go to a different slide but you're part of that that's I like to think of it you know these guys that sell you the MLM or multi-level marketing yeah you're in on this one okay you got a downline so anyway well I just wanted you to see that if you want to go ahead and click a few more I put this was one of the Cong congregations we spoke to in Honduras uh kiaga I believe was the name of the city go ahead another one uh City about 10 or 15 miles away uh forgot the name of that particular city boy there's a yeah you get to a lot of them but another congregation there this is some of the uh the Warfare that we speak sometimes when we go to these places we were in the jungle there in Panama this was from Panama this was just after I believe it was Honduras or just prior to Honduras and we'd been back in the jungle ministering to some people and they have these wonderful little bugs they call sandflies oh man I tell people I guess it's because oppositive blood type is a universal donor somehow the bugs know because everybody else will have two or three bites and I'll be just eating up so those are what the uh sandflies do to you go ahead and change it but uh next picture yeah it's not all jungles and stuff that's Panama City they call it New York and we did some Street meetings in Panama City go ahead uh this was one of the kind of a house Street meeting that we had there were sever people that came to Christ from this meeting that I know of and it might have been nine there were two others that I think perhaps had been backsliders and they came forward too that we prayed with and the lord gave a special touch to it so we did quite a few meetings this style of meeting kind of inside outside of houses uh I think when the as the trip went on we'd been there 21 days and I think we spoke 23 times so but it's interesting to jump from like what we've been doing with you which is I call it you know missionary or as Apostolic because Bible in Ephesians says the prophets and apostles are what bring you the Mysteries and then it becomes the uh responsibility the pastors evangelist to break those Mysteries down to the people and so but when we're out there we'll wind up doing evangelism for one service and then I'll go to like those other two churches where they're more mature and you can so you're kind of jumping in and in and out brother brandom called it changing gears one on one tape where when he was talking about having to go from Divine Healing into visions and then from that into evangelism and it really is it's kind of like changing gears and uh so that was one of the house meetings next slide there this was where we were at up in the jungle area it's with the embara PE people they're are native tribal people this was the kids from the tribal people that came to the services there and next s next slide there the the little kids are have their Sunday school underneath the church and that's the brother they're giving the the Sunday School lesson to the little ones and then uh this is the actual church service and then uh that's the church so and that is like I said in a jungle area and uh it's just different how do how do I explain that if you've never been there it's uh wonderful people we uh spent about 3 or 4 days with them up there and uh did multiple Services there and I don't know if I gave you any more than that or not go ahead that's some of the sisters they I don't know if they actually make the material for those skirts but they all wear that particular style skirt or most of the time at least for all the services uh very beautiful very colorful and they're called the embara people and before I left I I didn't put uh a picture of it up I don't think but they had it looks like a tattoo that's as people ask me what I eat well that's the local 7-Eleven I guess you call it or the the corner grocery store that's the kind of we eat a lot of that kind of stuff and so I think one more maybe two more I put on there this was another one of the street meetings we held at a school there in right on actually in a city that's kind of connected to Panama City they had uh quite a few different and the brothers down there are doing a lot of this in that country very different Spirit there among the people and they will get many visitors often for these kind of meetings and uh Lord is still moving Lord is still calling people out and that's one of the things that keeps us going so go ahead I think there might be one or two more uh that's it okay and so but I started to talk about the embar people they have a stuff a blue stuff that's kind of like a medicine to me or to them that they uh put on it looks like a tattoo and it comes from a particular tree that grows up on the mountains there kind of in the upper part of the Jungle there and for they put on my arm it looked like this kind of a strange tattoo but the stuff it uh if you're accepted by the tribe and you're considered a tribal friend or almost like a tribal member they give you this tattoo so they tattooed us three brothers but the stuff is so strange you can't get it off I mean it looks like a regular tattoo it doesn't come off and so I've got this uh you know this tattoo on my arm and uh but for I get some kind of dry skin stuff because of just because I guess and and so they said well this will really be good for your you know your dry skin and so they so I've got blue arms and this tattoo on my upper arm when I go back to Panama City and but this blue stuff you can't get it off it doesn't come off but it just goes away on the seventh day it just goes away you can't wash it off even soap and water but on the seventh day it disappears and I thought wow but so when we went to service and of course down there you're wearing short sleeves cuz it's hot and I have blue arms because they've rubbed it all over my arms and I have this Blue Tattoo and I told people I said you know I never thought I'd come to Panama and leave like an alien and I held up my blue arms but uh we get into some really strange ones uh some very beautiful ones and this was just the two countries that you helped us with last year and uh thank you and God bless you there was we baptized I think four at the embara village and then two sisters in Honduras and I think they baptized well I know they baptized a few from that one house meeting that I showed you of that seven after we left so God's still moving he's building your downline so God bless you and thank you from them and from me and of course our little church there at home uh it means a lot to us and and I trust it means a lot to the Lord Jesus so I will just mention one other story I spent uh this was from a couple you well you know the pre scamdemic pandemic however you view that situation but uh we had been in South Africa and I spent I think it was about nine days with uh Zulu people and for me it was kind of treat they uh um they didn't quite know what to think about me uh but we had such a good time and about 18 years ago actually this month this November I was struck with a an infection that went into my backbone that was serious enough I knew I was sick and I'd been to the doctor once and they gave me some medicine and the medicine kind of it was bad enough they had these big pink pills and the drug wouldn't even get near the car we did the drive-thru window and he goes who is this for and I was in the back seat and my leg was black and my kids are in the front and they said just pointed to me in the back seat and he goes I don't know what you got but here and he threw the pills into the into the back seat well eventually that wound up in my backbone it was an infection from the leg originally and uh brother Dr gyrus there and he pastors a little church in Roseberg Oregon uh he's a regular medical doctor he told the uh my wife because I had this fever that would come and go and come and go it had been that way for over a month almost a month and a half and they had changed and given me some different medicine and it kept it at Bay but it never went away and he told my wife if that high fever ever comes back get him to ER as fast as you can get him there because something's wrong and uh that night I I told my wife she kept telling me you need to go back to the doctor you need to go back to the do she's pretty good at keeping track of me and uh Lord bless her this morning and I told her honey we had three weeks worth of meetings planned ahead that we've been working on to get together uh special meetings in three different places and I said once we get those meetings done I said I'll go back to the doctor but I don't want to go back now because if I go back now he's going to want me to go to the hospital and I'm not going to do that because I have three weeks worth of meetings so at the end of the third the last meeting we were in Salem Oregon or just south of Salem There Brother Rich Cobbs and when gyrus told her that we started home that night and about uh 2 hours up the road I went while I was driving from about you know 99 to 104 in the car and my wife stop the car I am taking you to the hospital now what hospital do you want to go to and the only hospital I could think of cuz we' been staying with the kids near Kenwick Washington or Richland C they call it Tri Cities and there's a hospital there called Cadillac and they deal with all of the nuclear people on the Hanford research and reactors and all that stuff I said take me to Cadillac because I think they're probably pretty smart because they deal with all the radiation people and so she took me there and that night as The Story Goes because when I got there I thought the ER was full and I thought oh no I don't know how long I can make it sit here but the nurse got up from the desk and said come with me she took me back to the back and said uh you know sit here and I said can I lay down and she said yes she was going to do the blood pressure and how they start the different stuff and about there I passed out and I don't remember a whole lot for the first couple of days but my wife's story is that just how God arranges things and how that that particular night since it was going into you know the US Thanksgiving holiday everybody wanted to be with their families everybody's gone the best back surgeon supposedly in the Pacific Northwest was on duty that night in ER and he immediately checked me and sent me to uh an MRI and that kind of stuff told my wife we've got to do emergency surgery we don't know at that point they didn't know what was causing it but he said it's turning your husband's backbone into like jello and it had at that point it had crushed my spinal cord to where I had no legs left I I just there was no feeling and and I couldn't walk I couldn't anything and so he got with a couple other doctors and and they uh her terms is that the doctor and the anesthesiologist almost got in a fight because my vitals had gone so low the anesthesiologist said that uh if I put him to sleep I may not be able to wake him up and she said the doctor finally convinced him if you don't put him to sleep he's probably not going to live until morning because if that infection by then they'd figured out it was an infection pierces the outer coating of the spinal cord it was crushed it or was holding it like this uh but if it pieres the spinal cord he's gone in 45 minutes because it'll go straight to the brain and finished so they did surgery they took out part of my backbone I'm about two inches shorter than I used to be and I keep trying to get back up there but there's just pieces missing there's just and uh their prognosis was if I survived the surgery I would I might be in bed perhaps for the rest of my life because sometimes it turns people to vegetarian status vegetable status and and but if you know after a year 2 years this was they had different predictions that you know I might be able to get into a wheelchair with tons of therapy and all those kind of things we had my daughter started putting out you know showing pictures of us there in the hospital with just brief emails to different countries that I'd been to there were people praying for us from around the world and how God works with these kind of predictions and pretty much they didn't think we would ever walk again and uh I guess long story short we walked out of the hospital on the seventh day using one of those little metal Walkers the hospital said it was so impossible that when we went to make arrangements to start paying an $80,000 us hospital bill they gave us a little te letter that said the board of directors says you owe us nothing just go away because they'd never seen or anything quite like that in that hospital and so when I gave this story to this Zulu brother there that we were staying with he said would you please give this testimony to my uh my people because we have some people and some that are quite serious and so I told them that uh we gave the testimony and they have jumpers uh I want to I can't think of the the name of what they are but in the services they'll jump and they'll whistle and they'll do kind of a sufis I guess they call them they're a tribe that's there with the the with and around the Zulus and and so they will jump and they'll shout and sing in church and and so we were having I'm just having a good time I love these folks uh and so when I got to the end of given this the testimony of how God raised this up uh I said so if you've never seen one seen a miracle I said they look like this and I jumped about three times and H they got so excited and when I got ready to leave the country the deacons they stopped by this one Deacon's house and there was they were kind of having a fellowship there and one of the deacons comes up and he said we like you I said well that's nice that's good well sometimes in those countries because they're so poor when they start saying that is they're wanting money and I understand because it's the poor countries and and so I said well that's that that's nice God bless you brother so then a little later one of them comes up to me again and he said we really like you I'm going okay that's nice and when I got right before we got ready to leave a couple of them came up and and uh kind of cornered me as I was going out the door and they said no we really like you and what they were hoping is was that we'll get back there sometime but he I said well why do you keep telling me this and cuz I said I don't have any money I'm by the time I got home I had about $12 in my pocket to my name and uh so I said why do you keep telling me this and he said well we've only ever had two other white men come to our church before come to and stay with us and they said white man can't jump and you jump we like you so that's Africa it's a whole different story a lot of most of what we've been doing the last few years partly because of the coid situation has been in Central and South America and there are wonderful Believers all over this world we spent uh I think I've been to Madagascar eight times when we first went there it was uh as far as we knew even the gospel any kind of gospel there was a few Catholic churches and a few uh I believe it's 7eventh Day Adventist that had been able to make a few inroads another one that they call FMJ which is Full Gospel Madagascar and but very little even religious stuff going on because uh at some point back in history there was a queen that threw all Christianity out of the country completely and it took him years and years and years and years for anybody to even be allowed back in the country but now I know that as far as the message of the hour there are churches many churches there and one place I was told we held open air meetings brother nanded and myself and a couple other brothers from Madagascar we held it in a in a rundown broken down uh soccer stadium and where we held those meetings now they said there's a message Church of about a thousand people God is still moving God is still doing things and he's still calling out the bride of Christ so these are kind of things we do uh when we can and as we can and as the Lord directs us and you're part of it thank you and God bless you so with that in mind you know last night we talked about the water I heard there's a few visitors here this morning and we talked about the water and and how this it's in this carrier and there's you know water in the bottle and the water is there and it being transitive in other words you can move it around I can move it in the bottle or I can move it from the bottle and what happened to the water well I swallowed some the water's part of me and I'm part of the water now but with it and I didn't have to ask I didn't have to go to the bottle and say hey what water I know that for human beings there's life in you for me no just by drinking it the life comes and that's how the word of God should be to us as we consume the word of God the life comes with it and there we didn't really have time to get into it last night but there's another interesting thing when you go into Hebrew and even to a certain extent with the Greek and if if you you know you have a a Hebrew or Greek dictionary you run into places where it'll say uh superimposition it'll use that word or it'll use reversals and so as we think of the word of God and that's it's actually another concept we didn't get into but it's the reversal here is okay The Water Gave me Life when I drank it I didn't have to ask for it it just gives it to me but the reversal or the concept of reversal is now that life is being part imparted to you through his life and it's kind of like that door back there the brothers sitting by and you'll find many things in the scripture that it is way when they talk about the coming of the Lord it's also a going because when you came through that door this morning you were going away from somewhere else so your coming here was a going depending on the location which you put it and the now the superimposition or superimposed that that's pretty easy and we've been talking about that how the gospel has different layers to it and simply what it means is this Bible is now superimposed or on top of this Pulpit which is superimposed upon that carpet which is superimposed upon the floor so it's easy to see in that respect there's different levels and so it is with the gospel we find it in different levels and sometimes it can have reversals that we go wow that life didn't just come this way but now it goes back this way way and it can do it at the same time that's a paradox to me I just go wow Lord how amazing is that so we'll get uh let's stand for a moment we'll read a couple of scriptures and uh now that you know a little bit about us and what we do God bless you and thank you for your service to the Lord we'll start with uh let's just pray first gracious Heavenly Father we there's much information laid before us and uh tried to fill in those that are visitors or those who weren't with us last night or the night before whatever it might have been but father I'm asking you to take Divine control of this service as we approach this word this word is superimposed Upon Our Lives superimposed within us as even it said the kingdom of God is in you so allow that Kingdom of Jesus Christ now to come from within us to feed your sheep take this vessel get me out of the way and Speak Lord that they can be filled with your life that they too can reverse it and give it to someone else we thank you and Praise You In The Name of Jesus Christ amen in Psalms the 33rd chapter and we'll pick it up at the sixth verse so Psalms 33:6 by the word of the Lord were the heavens made in the host of them by the breath of his mouth he gathers the Waters of the sea together as a heap he lays up the depth in storehouses let all the Earth fear the lord let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him I do that a lot for he spoke and it was done he commanded and it stood fast gracious Heavenly Father we've read your word may you grant us strength strength and life through Jesus Christ amen please be seated so we have again a concept and and as we spoke the first night I find most of the time I don't read a lot of quotes I use a lot of scriptures because they reinforce the concept and the concept here is that whenever God speaks something it's done amen it will come to pass it might not come to pass the way I think it is or the way you think it is but God will bring it to pass and once it goes into the universe or into what we think of as the universe it continues and continues and continues like the light we spoke about we mentioned the light and how that the light when he said let there be light it never stopped the word of God is still creating light here this morning it's in this case it it's not natural light but outside those windows it's natural light there's all different forms of light that have gone out and they're continuing in these lights that are on right now it's not even the same light that you experienced when you walked in the service because the word of God is continuing and continuing to create light and so when God speaks it it says it's done and he commands it and it stands fast well a lot of times people kind of put the period there and say that means it's done with no if I'm standing here well you know if we put it into time you know I've probably been too long already I don't know but it's it Lord will and it's going to continue and how that and how that it continues through time it continues to develop and God can use those same words over and over and over to display this different things they it can be a prophecy of a of a particular moment a particular time but that also can show itself as prophecy going through time and repeating over and over and being reversed and go going into reversal and going back to what was originally said to show us a nature to show us the mind of God behind it or the soul which is the nature so let's turn to Genesis the 49th chapter and just take a look at how some of this works we mentioned this part of this the other night and that was when David got on top of the Philistine uh uh Goliath and cut off his head and we use the eth verse of chapter 49 Judah Thou Art he whom thy Brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of the enemies which literally means to sever the head and thy father's children shall bow down before thee and how that David fulfilled all three of those portions of that scripture in the life of David because his brother his Brethren praised him he cut off the head of the enemy and the children bowed down before him in Chronicles when both both uh Judah and Israel come together and they anoint him King they bow before David as king so we see here was a scripture in Genesis that's going out from the prophet Jacob to his son Judah and but we find it fulfilled I guess roughly 600 years later and so we're going to look just for a moment to see this again just a above there because it's a different it's almost more of a curse than a blessing and it's to Simeon and Levi Simeon and Levi are Brethren I'm starting in verse 5 are Brethren instruments of Cruelty are in their habitations that's not the nicest thing to say about them oh my soul come not thou into their secret unto their assembly mine honor be not thou United for in their anger they slew a man and in their self-will they dig down a wall cursed be their anger for it was fierce their wrath for it was cruel I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel that was the prophecy to Simeon and Jacob that I mean to Simeon and Levi that came through Jacob what a prophecy well we know that that prophecy actually goes back to to event that had happened that they had participated in in their anger they slew a man their self-will it says they dig down a wall so that was something that they had performed that was in them and now this prophecy that's coming from God through Jacob to give them to give a description of them the power of God to make that prophecy not just to cover what they've already done but to cover what's going to come to pass if God said it we read it then he brings it to pass he's going to bring to pass this prophecy through Simeon and Levi well we know he did 400 years later after they get out of Egypt uh when they're coming out of Egypt we know that he uh they were scatter Ed in Israel the Levites were never given a portion of the land they were only given the Cities of Refuge and those Cities of Refuge were scattered throughout the land so we see the power behind this prophecy and how God brought it to pass later on but it even goes beyond that because the soul or the nature that's being expressed through this prophecy it said in your uh in your anger you slew a man now that's the nature that we find in Levi and in Simeon but we're going to deal mostly just with Levi here for a few moments well what happened future since 400 years you know because after this prophecy after this scripture they went down into Egypt it says for 400 years so for 400 years they are in Egypt and this prophecy's laying there but it's not just laying there and finished God is using all of the events and all of creation is coming into uh submission as it were to this prophecy them being in Egypt that's part of of this prophecy cuz God had made a pro another prophecy to Abraham and said your seed's going to go down in a Strange Land for 400 years afterwards he said I will bring them out so he said God is going to bring them out but there's a 400e time span between when this is you know over 400 years from the time that this prophecy is given until something else happens with Levi can I take this off I told the people at home I I don't wear suit coats very often so the last time I did I said take a picture because it's probably going to be a while again before you see me in one of those and now here I go again back with the sleeves this means we're getting serious and so here it is like over 400 years later this prophecy still exists and the power behind this prophecy is about to take a new turn because when you go into the book of Exodus and remember this is 400 years later it talks about and there went a man of the house of Levi I'm in Exodus chapter 2 and there went a man of the house of Levi and took to a wife a daughter of Levi whoa oh that's pretty pretty levitical strain yes a man of Levi and he takes a wife of Levi and the woman conceived and bear a son and when she saw him that he was a goodly child she hid him three months what are we talking about who is this speaking of what is Moses he is a levite he is a son generationally of this prophecy that God gave through Jacob 400 years previous and the nature behind the prophecy well we know that Moses was spared the you know from the crocodiles from the Crocs as we say when we're overseas he spared from the Crocs and and uh that how he was taken into Pharaoh's household all of these things but when it comes to a certain place in time when he sees his Brethren and his children these Hebrews those who were as we looked at that definition last night one from Beyond these were people that from The Eyes Of God they're with him they're his children and so when he sees them in this bondage and he sees how they're be being treated and he realizes that there is also a seed of Deliverance in him why I'm the great Moses I'm second you know to to Pharaoh a and I have all this power and all this stuff and so I'm going to deliver the children of Israel he doesn't exactly maybe know how at that point in time but what's the first thing he does he slays a man think about it the prophecy was in your anger you slew a man then when he saw that man beating one of the Hebrew children his anger he slew a in that's the life of that prophecy moving through history but it doesn't stop there well we know because of that anger and because of that this is how God can turn around even the he can reverse the things what looks like a bad scene you know I don't know what the uh I'm thinking an an Egyptian killing a Hebrew you know that might have had a death penalty we don't exactly know but Moses had to get out of there and we know how he went into the Wilderness he was there 40 years and uh then God gets a hold of him God gets a hold of Moses he we we've heard the story The Burning Bush and how that Moses was there before the burning bush and and God spoke to him and said you're going to go down and you know I'm going to deliver the people but you're going to be the way I do it Moses go down and be a God to those people so Moses goes down and he does the you know there's this plague and that plague and all those things that happen and that comes to a place again where God's getting tired but he's getting tired of what's going on with Egypt and Israel because Pharaoh would try to repent he would try he was a good make believer okay I Repent please please just take the frogs away man I can't deal with these frogs anymore but then a few days later well when he saw that the frogs were all piled up and stunk and were bringing flies on all into his country he all a sudden well no I don't repent you're not going anywhere and so Moses there came a place where that prophecy comes again and he said you'll not see my face again and what happened was judgment fell on the firstborn of Egypt so God has taken from this prophecy brought it through a man we saw it manifested once now we see it manifested it again because Moses has had enough he said you're your firstborn they're dead because he's had enough and then we know how that salvation was given unto Israel through the Passover Lamb we discussed that a little bit last night but we see it again and so the whole firstborn of Egypt were slain through the mouth of Moses a levite who has this trait following his life you understand okay so but it doesn't even stop there because this is the nature of God being expressed through his prophet and they get into the Wilderness they're they get out and how that you know this Mighty Deliverance God moves the red the Red Sea and the armies go in and again there's Egyptians slain in the Red Sea and how this trait is following this levite and how when they get in the wilderness now this is the same man that killed an Egyptian because of how the Hebrews were being treated and they get in the wilderness and they begin to CH with him you brought us out here to die wow would that we had stayed in Egypt you know Moses what what are you doing and so when they begin to chide with Moses he gets angry again and this time God tells him Moses go speak to the Rock but Moses doesn't speak to the Rock he takes his staff and he smites The Rock and he not just once he smites it twice yeah we know from the message of the hour what is that the rock is of course Jesus Christ and he is signifying the death of Jesus Christ through his anger and he said he never should have hid it twice because that means that the Gentiles would do the same thing that the Jews did have you ever heard a message called Where They Crucified him where the most religious country they the most religious people crucified put to an open shame him the word of God he said who did it was the preachers the Levites you see that prophecy rolling through history well and we go back to even the time when Jesus Christ was on Earth and how that that in his anger he slew a man and there from there and here it's that trait that is it's moving moving moving all the way through history and it comes down to Jesus Christ and here are these scribes and Pharisees the Levites the the the preachers the ministers as it were and and here's Jesus Christ on the scene the very Messiah and in their anger in their jealousy in in all of that what did they do they killed a man they killed him they killed Jesus Christ because that seed that was sown in Genesis has now moved all the way through history and the Levites kill the Lord Jesus Christ whatever God says it stands fast and then it moves all the way through the times of the Gentiles until God sends as it were the pillar of fire back he sends it to the Gentiles it was there in the days of Paul and he brings it back in our day and how that through denominational Creed and dogma and all those things the way he said it he said they have made the word of God of none effect they have made it to where people don't or won't receive the fullness of what this word of God God is doing they've killed the word of God again and how that for those that we call it the select or uh the elected as it calls it in the book of Ephesians for those that can receive it it is eternal life it is well it's Rapture to be what is the most common word used or change or uh what's the it's not transcend but uh transformed that's another word another words that's a changing process like they take electricity that on those great big lines and they transform it until you can plug your cell phone in without blowing it up because it's the life that's in that electricity electric energy being transformed down to where it's usable for you and I and the word of God does that over and over and so started out this morning early as we were studying through a few things if we were to give this message a name this morning I would just simply call it delivered and we'll go now if we're in full understanding of this concept of how God can put it out there and the nature of that word concerning those particular people continues that nature goes on and on and on and on but there is like we said with the light it'll produce light throughout eternity unless God says stop and for the Levites There's Hope because in Zachariah it says he shall purify that's a refining fire the sons of Levi for them there's a stop so praise the Lord for that one but that's just how God can take and use something over and over and he can even reverse as it were the uh consequences for the elect and so I'd like to read from yeah man we're just getting into the message brother he told me to take my Liberty but and let's go to Isaiah for just a moment since I said we we'll call this delivered and I think in a minute you'll see or in a few moments you'll see why 66 Isaiah and we're preaching Concepts or a concept of God's word being used over and over and having different layers this is layered on top of this on top of that and the word of God is that way and so in Isaiah 66 we'll start at the sixth verse he says a voice of noise from the city a voice from the temple a voice of the Lord that render with recompense to his enemy and immediately we can see three different levels or three different manifestations of this voice one's in the temple one's in the city and one is to bring recompense to the rendering recompense to the enemies and so then we go into verse 7 and it says before she travailed travailed she brought forth and there's those another concept there those two dots has a time frame before her pain came she was delivered of a Manchild who hath heard such a thing who hath seen such things who shall the Earth be made to bring forth in one day or shall the nation be born at once for as soon as Zion prevailed she brought forth her children and we see it again here's four questions who's heard this who's seen it and the word there I believe relates to a vision so we know it's moved from who's heard it in the natural or who has perceived it as it were uh by natural understanding who's seen it who's or who's heard it who's seen it so it takes it to the supernatural level and then it takes it back to another level as of the whole earth in one sense shall the uh shall the Earth be made to bring forth in one day but then we look back and we see friends we're made from this Earth we are part of this prophecy because we're part of the earth bringing forth God bringing forth himself in earn vessels but dropping up just before that and and again think about reversals and how God can change things around and we talked a little bit last night about Hebrew and how we read right to left but they read left to right and how brother brandham said you can change the position of the words and he says it doesn't uh necessarily change the meaning but it changes the way that we look at what it says and in verse 7 I find it interesting because if you reverse the second half of that that prophecy instead of a before her came came she was delivered of a Manchild it would be she was delivered of a Manchild before her pain came that puts us in a double Paradox if you just reverse it because not only does she bring forth a Manchild she is delivered of the Manchild where does our deliverance come from the Manchild Jesus Jesus Christ but it says before she travailed she's already brought forth the child regardless of which direction you look at it she hasn't even travailed yet and the word travail there I find it's very interesting because it can mean to twist to wind together also means rest and pain and uh to bring forth or beget children to Bear Young but it's also the same word that's used when uh it says that I was conceived in my mother's womb in sin and iniquity I think it's Psalms I probably wrote it down you 51 we can look at it real C quick like because it's the same word that's used there is used here praise the Lord 51 yes behold I was shapen in iniquity and in sended my mother conceived me it's the same word in that particular place as far as this travailing or bringing forth so then it says uh when it uses the word they're delivered she was delivered of this child the word there is not necessarily what we think it is because it literally means to slip away or to escape I'm back in 66 Brothers I'm sorry before she trailed she brought forth and she was delivered of a Manchild she slipped away she escaped escaped she was smooth and slippery she brought forth or she left out or she was let go so what do we be begin to see we're talking about a bride of Jesus Christ delivered by a Manchild and yet she is the one that brought forth this Manchild if we turn it back around so we see the double meaning or the reversal of how God can take one thing and make it more than one make it have as it were a double meaning she was delivered she leapt out she was let go she escaped of this Manchild and when it talks about the Manchild there the word again it means remembered or called to mind recorded or a memorial so this Manchild has a memory a recorded memory and this bringing forth or this Deliverance comes and we look at Ephesians to find out what was this all about this Manchild that this bride or this woman is bearing has as it were been remembered and the word there in Ephesians the first chapter goes like this says according blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings and Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love of being predestinated having predestinated us under the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will so there is a memory within this child and we find that I believe in uh when the the thief on the cross they the thieves and they're railing on Jesus and finally the one Thief turns to the other and he said are you crazy we deserve what we're getting but he doesn't deserve it and he turns and he said Lord remember me he touched on the memory of God and the predestination of God according to his good pleasure and he took good pleasure to turn to that thief and said this day you'll be with me in Paradise he touched the memory of God and when he touched that memory it brought him eternal life we talked about him the other night can you imagine getting over to the other side and there's all these people and all these testimonies they go how did you get here I don't know I just said the right thing I guess to the right person at the right time and here he is with no testimony testimony his testimony was being a thief but here he is in heaven by the grace and the power of God so we' said these things and I I'll give you one more part of that Prophecy from Isaiah because it said when Zion uh I better read it because I'll get it backwards here for as soon as Zion travailed she brought forth her children and Zion there actually means a parched place it's prophetic word for Jerusalem a mountain Mountain a signpost a monument dryness drought Barren desert a solitary place and Jesus when he was going up to Calvary and the the women were bewailing him he said don't don't wail for me he said wail for yourselves because if this is what they're doing to the tree when it's green what are they going to do when it's dry remember that scripture yes he said what are they going to do to that tree when it's dry friends we're in the age of the dry tree the dry Vine and so uh but we're in this also this travailing period in which the male is being born in us that we can bring forth the male again through the life that's in the water of this book the word of God so with that concept not too much longer but delivered let's look at second Timothy and bring this down to our age because right now we we've kind of been jumping around different ages and and things so let's watch how God can take that same word and bring bring it right down to where we're living right now and that's in second Timothy and if you never been here this morning I'm sure some of this might you might be scratching your head going what's this guy talking about well God bless you in second Timothy the 4th chapter and the 16th verse it's talking here uh the Apostle Paul has been uh rewarded as it were he's been had much evil done to him by Alexander the coppersmith and he comes down to verse 16 and he says at my first answer no man stood with me but all men forsook me I pray God that it might not be laid to their charge what is happening in this scripture now Paul as we know him as our first church age Messenger to the Gentiles because most of this new testament uh beyond the four gospels is written by the Apostle Paul and we know it's Christ there on the scene in a different form am morha in the pillar of fire Paul said I was born out of season I never got to meet that fleshly man of Jesus but I met the the man that came to me was in as it were a light a pillar of fire however you want to view that and it even blinded him and he had to be prayed for to get part of his eyesight back and but he said that light spoke to him I am Jesus when Paul said who and Jesus said I am Jesus Paul why do you kick against against the Pricks why are you doing this and we see now here Paul under persecution says nobody stood with me who's speaking this this is Christ speaking through Paul the Christ of that Pillar of Fire this time the god of the Gentiles Jesus of the Gentiles is now speaking nobody stood with me all men forsook me Jesus Christ was absolutely forsaken by Earth and by heaven when he hung on Calvary as he hung between heavens and earth and he was completely forsaken by man and he was forsaken by God by his own words my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me yes okay so he is speaking by way of the spirit of God and what was the last thing I believe it was that Jesus said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing and here is God speaking again God don't lay this to their charge it's Christ brother sister God lay it not to their charge and it's also showing us that this Apostle Paul has the spirit of Christ on him and it's Christ bringing himself through history from the natural fleshly man into the supernatural man of the pillar of Fire or the light that came to Paul and Paul is now how do we know that because it's displaying the same nature just like like with Levi that displayed the same nature all the way through history now Christ is displaying his nature through the Apostle Paul but then he goes on to say not withstanding the Lord stood with me and strengthened Me That by my by me the preaching might be fully known and that all the Gentiles might hear what's the purpose of God doing this with Paul and with this spirit ir and this nature of this spirit being with Paul it's so that all the Gentiles might hear did not Jesus say until this gospel has gone to Every Creature every tongue Every Nation every tribe this was what Paul was all about displaying Christ so that Christ could be seen that's what these letters Titus Timothy Hebrews all those things are about God wants to display play his nature to the entire Earth that by me the preaching might be fully known that all the Gentiles might hear and then there's those two dots again and we know that denotes a time frame we don't know how long those time frames are the one that I'm most familiar with was when uh the priest gave the book to uh brother Branham brother William Branham and he spoke he said there's two 2,000 years between those two dots because Jesus only read so far and then sat down and he said but now we are to speak judgment and he said as he read the rest of that prophecy in Isaiah he said there was 2,000 years between those two dots so we see a time frame here and the last thing he said I was delivered out of the mouth of the Lion what a strange scripture here he's talking about he's been in under persecution and he's saying forgive him Lord they don't mean to be doing this a and nevertheless you've been you stood by me and I and we're doing this preaching so that all the Gentiles might hear and then there's this time frame and the last thing he said I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion do you know what he's talking about in the natural sense of the word when he was in Ephesus I think it's in Corinthians Corinthians that he talks about it he goes I fought with the beasts in Ephesus and God delivered him so from the natural sense he's saying I was delivered from the mouth of those Lions but it goes beyond that because as we understand from the lions in Amos 3 we can look at it for uh quickly believe it or not we're almost done I think in verse 4 Amos 3:4 will a lion roar in the forest when he hath no prey will a young lion cry out of his den if he's taken nothing and he goes on down and said surely God will do nothing but he Reveals His secrets to his proph servants the prophets in verse 7 the lion have roared who will not fear the lord God hath spoken who can but prophesy so what's this lion what is this lion it's the prophecies that give us the nature of God and Paul said I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion well in a natural sense Paul was absolutely delivered from the beasts that he had to face in Ephesus but as we begin to understand and if we went back to Genesis 49 again because that there in verse 9 I believe it is it says that he was a young lion speaking of the LI the tribe of Judah the lineage of Judah he was the Young Lion then he's the resting lion and then he is the lion that says who will call him on the scene Rouse him up that's the word it uses so we see that's three the three comings or three comings of the Lord Jesus he's the Lion's WEP from because he became the prey and from the prey what happened he was resurrected and ascended on high he went up he stooped down he couched as a lion and if you get and as an old lion and when you look at that particular verse he was when it says couched he was at rest what's our rest it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost three comings in one scripture and what's the last one who shall Rouse him up and where do we find that you go to the Song of Solomon and said don't Rouse him until he's ready are you with me wow you're really quiet today I just got to remember the Sheep are feeding do you understand how that he takes one scripture and he uses that one scripture to show us the Life of Christ the nature of Christ is to be the Lion's wealth to be our rest and to be a rapturing bridegroom who will Rouse him up or bring him on the scene so that we can be taken up with him praise the Lord you still love me are we been too long we're almost done actually I know I keep saying that my wife says don't tell them that they're too nice but so as we see the it's this was prophecy this is the lion this is Judah the lion the lion of the tribe of Judah and here it's given forth as a nature in Prophecy we saw that verse 8 was fulfilled by David and David was as it were God showing himself what his kingship would look like through the life of David and now we come to this place and Paul said I was delivered or my Deliverance came from the mouth of the lion what's the lion who can but prophecy prophesy the lion is the words of Prophecy with the nature of of God behind them and those prophecies are going to Pro produce or to manifest the life and the nature of the god that speaks them and so we see and he said I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion his Deliverance came out of Prophecy and we go to Revelations 5 we think of Revelations 10:7 and how it said that there would out of the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished from Revelations 10:7 but then we come back to now to Revelations chap 5 and if we back up just a little further he gives us we're familiar most everyone here is familiar with the seven Church ages and how that in the last age of Le oia which means or lady oia means people's rights and how that we get to the end to that Revelation Revelations chapter 3 to him that overcome will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches how did Jesus overcome he's saying to him that overcome even as I overcame friends this is very important because if this is how we overcome is the same way that Jesus overcame how did Jesus overcome he overcame by the prophecies concerning him thou wil not leave my my soul in Hell nor suffer my Holy One to seek corruption and he could take from that prophecy tear this Temple down three days I'll raise it up he could look back at the prophet Jonah and when they said we need a sign he said the only sign you get is the sign of the prophet Jonah he's prophesying of himself he is using using the nature or the lion of Prophecy to bring forth his own Resurrection think about it and even when he was on the cross they're looking at him going you know come down off that cross and they said he helped others can he help himself and it's hey you know Great Master there on Calvary but no he was resting in the prophecy about him you know tear this Temple down I'll raise it up and he was looking back at all the prophecies that concerned him so much even I believe it's Psalms 22 where he said all my bones were out of joint I am poured out like water pretty much everyone that's a Christian believes that talking about Jesus Christ and he was resting on those promises he was resting on the Promises to the lion all the way back to Genesis 49 knowing he becomes the prey but he's going to raise again because from the prey I go up he was risking or betting however you want to say said his life that the power in that prophecy was enough to pull him out of the ground because in that prophecy is the nature or the power of God that's how Jesus overcame he recognized himself in this book bride of Christ and he prophesied his own Resurrection ction that's how Jesus overcame was in the power of the Resurrection that he spoke by his own mouth that's not skin milk we have a spoken word promise a third pull what are we prophesying oh Jesus help me Jesus help me or is it it I am a Son of God you are Sons you are Daughters of God and the power of God dwells within you so before we well let's go ahead and look then at chapter five because this is actually kind of a keynote to Deliverance chapter 5 and we'll start there at uh verse one and I know you've had many good preachers here I know that and he said I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and loose the seals thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth nor under the Earth was able to open the book neither look thereon there are people that say say William brandham opened the seals no I beg to differ with you because this says no man was sound worthy who opened the book was when the angel of the Lord came down and used the gift from a prophet's message and even told that Prophet no you're looking at it wrong you got to come around this other way to understand these Seven Seals and so and there's we'll let brother Jonathan talk more about that especially to the visitors this morning he said so no man was found worthy and I wept much because no man was found worthy he he repeats it which means it's of importance to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto him weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and loose the Seven Seals thereof now wait a minute the the the lion of the tribe of Judah well we just had the scripture on the board a minute ago what was the lion of the tribe of Judah he was the Young Lion he was the resting lion and he's the lion that's to be roused up and wherever he said oh I'll never leave you or forsake you wherever I am you are there you're there with him wherever he is and I think it's in in John Book of John and when he prayed in the garden he said that I I'm doing this I will so that where I am they may be also I know you're familiar with these scriptures they're not new to you and so here is this lion that has prevailed and when we see and it's prevailed to loose the Seven Seals to loose them to open them up to make that creative power of God available to finish the book The Lion The Prophecies of the lion all the way from Genesis now come down to our age and the Revelation or the mystery of the Seven Seals are broken and he said and I beheld in verse 6 and lo in the midst of the throne and the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood what a lamb stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the world what did the Prophecies of the lion produce what was the nature behind the lion was the lamb and we are delivered from the mouth of the lion was what Paul said in second Timothy our deliverance comes from from the mouth of the lion or the prophecies concerning the lion that became the lamb it's the power of God and we find in Ephesians and I really we're really we're finishing up I thank you brother for the Liberty to speak on these things normally this would be something I'd just do at home but he told me take your Liberty thank you brother it means a lot to me and to have a congregation so willing to listen thank you in Ephesians when it talks about this power what is this power that he's talking about well says in Ephesians the 1 chapter I believe it might be the second here no it's the first and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word this is Ephesians 1: 19 what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us word who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him in his own right hand in the Heavenly places what is it talking about the power of Resurrection that's the power of God to take something something that's dead or to take something that's nothing and make something out of it God only used the womb of Mary he took something that was nothing and by word created in Mary in the womb of Mary what we call Our Savior Jesus Christ the power of the Resurrection in one other place John the first chapter we've definitely taken a walk through scripture I when he talks about in the beginning was the word the word was with God John 1 and one uh word was with God the Word was God and we're all familiar with this all things were made by him without him was not anything made and we drop down to the 12th verse and to me this is one when I hear people preach I wonder why they don't use this scripture more often because in verse 12 it says but as many as received him that's not a message that's not a Doctrine that's a personal presence in our lives the life that's in this water when we receive him the life behind this book it says when we receive him to them he gave power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name the power is in the receiving him drink just drink and the power and the life come with it the creative power of the resurrection and the life Jesus when he went to the tomb of Lazarus said I am she she said oh if you had been here my brother would have lived and he said I am the resurrection and the life it's not there'll be an event we call Resurrection but where does it start it starts with the life of Jesus Christ inside of us I am the resurrection it's a person and if you receive that person you have the power to become the sons and in their case Daughters of God because once God speaks it it forever stands let's stand God bless you tonight or it's probably is tonight now I don't know how long we went shouldn't have told me how long those batteries were good for brother but you know sometimes I'll apologize for length because I'm not yeah I don't know how long we went I I don't even know but to get the concept that Christ in you is the resurrection Christ in you brother bam said once you're born again and you have not gone to the bar recently because you don't have any desire once that desire has been changed he said that proves the resurrection's already in you praise the Lord gracious Heavenly Father Lord I might as it were apologize for the length because of these Earthly bodies but I cannot apologize for the content because it's you it's the Life of Christ and I trust that we've showed you enough places in the scripture that you can manifest your honor and your glory through your children here this morning their kindness Lord sometimes the simplest word the simplest smile can bring you on the scene so we love you we thank you in the name of Jesus Christ as we give you this service amen so thank you for having us here I I love you or I wouldn't have gone the way these Services have gone uh although I'm not a very good evangelist anymore but uh we is it okay if I sing one more song and I I can I can do this one without the words because the words are in the book when I first gave my heart to Christ I'd been in both folk groups I toured Europe as a young man at 18 years old with a folk singing group for one whole summer and also I played in a rock band for I don't know four years from the time I was like seventh or eighth grade when I came to the Lord I didn't even sing or play for actually quite a while cuz I heard brother brandom say you lay that gift aside until God's ready to use it and this particular song that if the sister will allow me one once more uh was actually the first song that he gave me after I had given my heart to Christ and you can find it in Thessalonians chapter 3 chapter 4 I'm sure you'll recognize it when I start to play [Music] it for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord should not prevent them which are sleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with a trump of God and the dead in Christ CHR shall rise [Music] first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together together with him in the clouds to meet our Lord in the air and so shall [Applause] [Music] we be with the Lord ever be with the [Music] Lord praise the Lord God bless you thank you I didn't mean for you to keep standing but God bless you thank you sister Lord bless you God bless you brother please you know the quarterback or whoever's they have to hand the brother take the ball please God bless you thank you we come to the End Amen I love how we started he said the Lord spoke it was done then you put those two dots there the completion is because he said it not because it's finished it's because when he says it it's as good as done and then you have that period of time for it to come out and for to happen but it was done when he said it because his word can't return unto him void and then he talked about Simeon and Levi and they killed a man in Anger remember what Jesus said to the priest he said you are just as your father for he was a murderer from the beginning and we go back and what that tells you is that the seed of Cain had continued through the nature of Cain had continued even into that priesthood all through there's none of us clean there's none of us good our family name means nothing our family lineage our bloodline we've all been born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies sorry about that Brothers but as he talked about it you know brother Brandon would say you murder a man's influence and it's the same as you put a knife in his back or you killed that man amen he talked about the birth before travail and you continue there in Isaiah he says will the Lord basically make you pregnant and then not give you a child will he put you through all of that effort and and then leave you hanging he won't he won't I I loved what how sister sang this morning you know what that was that was a sacrifice of praise a sacrifice of praise in times of disappointment and and un unsureness and these different things there's a sacrifice there when we say Lord I believe Lord I trust Lord I'm looking to your word and no matter what the situation looks like it's that lying vanity he spoke of last night and I believe your word Amen brother BR said God loves to hear us repeat his word back to him amen that's the thing that takes us through is is is the word I love that thought of the thief touch the memory of God you you can't go to heaven unless you were in there in the first place in the mind and the predestinated purpose of God Amen and then he talked about that Lion's Roar and that prophecy and it reminded me of the scripture in Revelation where it says they overcame by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony Jesus said because I live you shall live also why because if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it'll Quicken your mortal bodies it'll make you live and you cannot die once you get that spirit inside of you amen and then he said Paul would say because we are Sons because we are children of God then we cry ABA father then we repeat the word back then we say God fulfill the word that you've given for our time fulfill the word that you've given for our age fulfill the word that you've given for my life and for my family and all these different things and we come back and we say God do it just like a child coming to the father saying feed me provide for me protect me deliver me as the case may be whatever it is because he's our father we go to him and we have access to everything that he's promised amen and he finished with Ephesians the exceeding greatness of his power is what we're trusting in amen amen I'm trusting we're blessed this morning that I'll leave it there but let's sing that song just before we close you talked about seeing who we are so let's sing that song who I am oh glorious victory that day he set me free oh glorious victory that day he set me free and he made my heart his very [Music] throne and my life is
