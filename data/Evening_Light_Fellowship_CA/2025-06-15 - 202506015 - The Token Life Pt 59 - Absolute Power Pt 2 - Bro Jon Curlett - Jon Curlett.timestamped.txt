[19:49] Every breath that I take,
[19:52] every moment I'm awake,
[19:57] Lord, have your way in me.
[20:13] Lord, heavenly father, we invite you to
[20:16] come, Lord.
[20:19] Come amongst your people, Father God.
[20:21] Move in a special way, Lord, to let them
[20:23] know that you indeed
[20:26] are God.
[20:28] You are the father that answers prayers.
[20:32] You are the light to the darkness. Lord,
[20:36] you're the giver of every good gift.
[20:40] You're the very air that we breathe.
[20:41] Lord, we thank you, Lord, for all you've
[20:44] done, all you continue to do, Lord.
[20:48] We pray for little Elella, Lord, as she
[20:51] heard her back, Father God, and her
[20:54] young sister. Come up and ask for
[20:56] prayer, Lord. And we just pray that you
[20:58] touch her heart as well, Lord.
[21:00] everyone else on the prayer list. Father
[21:02] God, we put before you, everyone is just
[21:05] as important as another. Lord, just ask
[21:08] that you visit them, touch them, Lord.
[21:12] In Jesus Christ's holy name we pray.
[21:14] Amen. And grab a seat there for a
[21:17] minute.
[21:21] And I was sitting in service and uh
[21:23] everybody was testifying last week
[21:26] and just kept coming to me. Remember
[21:29] that concrete curve? Sounds strange, but
[21:33] someone in concrete.
[21:36] You know, when God delivers you of
[21:38] something, it's very important, no
[21:40] matter the excuse, the reason, the
[21:43] professionals,
[21:45] never to go back to it.
[21:47] Many of you know I suffer from a
[21:49] extremely bad back
[21:52] and uh you know God delivered me from
[21:55] drugs and alcohol and all these things
[21:57] many many years ago
[22:00] and the doctor prescribed me uh
[22:03] percoetses
[22:05] and you know I had my ups and downs of
[22:07] them over the years but they were really
[22:08] bad for me and I fought I literally you
[22:11] know brother Brown says you got to fight
[22:12] to go to hell that's what it's like I
[22:15] fought myself and warned, should I take
[22:18] them? Shouldn't I take them? Anyways, I
[22:21] started to take them.
[22:23] I went up. I got up to almost eight a
[22:25] day. Last going off, you know, I was
[22:28] below as directed two a day, but it
[22:30] still wasn't a point. Something happened
[22:33] at that moment that changed me.
[22:36] I become very
[22:39] stoic, if you will. My wife would say,
[22:42] "I love you." I say, "Love is just
[22:43] emotion." like just cold
[22:48] darkness cuz when I was debating whether
[22:52] to take them, not to take them, I just
[22:54] kept remembering seven worst devils
[22:56] would come. Seven worse. And it did. I
[22:59] got to a bad bad place when I no longer
[23:02] heard the voice of God. Wanted to hear
[23:04] the voice of God. Wanted nothing to
[23:07] really do with it.
[23:09] I kept coming to church because I'm not
[23:12] a quitter. I'm a fighter.
[23:14] But number two, I know this is the
[23:18] truth. Once you believe something, you
[23:20] cannot unbelief. That's where the devil
[23:23] don't understand. If you believe it, you
[23:25] can't unbelieve it. All you could do is
[23:28] believe it's not for you.
[23:30] So for my family's sake, I know this is
[23:33] the truth.
[23:36] So we were sitting here and I mean, I've
[23:38] had a tough time the last couple years.
[23:42] You know, I kind of felt like Adam when
[23:44] he got kicked out of the garden. You you
[23:46] know, you spend so much time in the
[23:48] presence and praying and and
[23:52] you know, it's
[23:54] it was a hard place to go through and I
[23:58] wouldn't wish it on anybody. And you can
[24:00] make all the money in the world. You I
[24:02] thank God that he blesses you based on
[24:03] what he's doing, not what you're doing.
[24:08] You know, people used to say, you know,
[24:10] money can't buy you happiness. I used to
[24:12] say, well, let me figure that out
[24:13] myself.
[24:15] But
[24:17] nothing, there's no amount of money,
[24:19] there's no amount of nothing to have
[24:20] that peace. I lost my peace, that peace
[24:23] with God.
[24:25] I had a guy, um,
[24:29] he was doing concrete and he had a
[24:31] concrete curb and I pulled up and I
[24:34] said, "That's that's wrong. it's not
[24:35] going to work out.
[24:37] And he said, "Chad, you don't know what
[24:39] you're talking about. That's going to be
[24:40] perfect." I said, "It's not going to
[24:42] work." But I let him do it anyways.
[24:45] Every time he questions me, I says,
[24:47] "Remember that curb?" Every time for a
[24:51] long time, I blame God. I Lord, why
[24:54] would you let me go through this? When
[24:57] the brothers were testifying, it kept
[24:59] coming to me. Remember that concrete
[25:02] curve,
[25:04] God. sometimes will allow you to do what
[25:07] you want just to show you. Remember my
[25:10] word. He let me go through that
[25:14] so I could appreciate what he has given
[25:16] me.
[25:18] We had the special meetings
[25:21] and I was sitting there, you know, and I
[25:23] was I'm not going up for prayer. I've
[25:25] been up for prayer many times. The
[25:27] greatest preachers in the message.
[25:30] I'm I'm a very straight to the point
[25:32] person. The Bible says in my name you
[25:34] shall cast out devils. That's what I
[25:36] believe. Just don't tell me why you
[25:38] can't do it. That's just what I believe.
[25:40] And I'm sitting there and I'm arguing.
[25:42] I'm saying, "Lord, I'm not going up."
[25:44] And then I said, "Unless I see the
[25:46] pillar of fire."
[25:48] I said, "Forgive me, Lord, for saying,
[25:50] you know, show me your hands and it'll
[25:51] suffice. That's how I feel."
[25:55] All of a sudden, I just kept hearing
[25:59] Brother Brandham, you know, thinking
[26:01] Brother Brandham said the light was
[26:02] shining over someone and God was calling
[26:05] him, but he would not come.
[26:09] After that, a light come right here.
[26:15] Right here.
[26:18] I'm shaking now just thinks about it.
[26:22] and peace
[26:26] come back.
[26:28] Praise God.
[26:30] Right after that, Brother Joel s or
[26:33] brother Joel sang this song
[26:36] about peace. God bless you.
[26:45] Thank you, brother.

[30:57] his glory and gave us the victory. The
[31:01] greatest love story.
[31:06] Amen. Brother Chad asked me just to add
[31:08] here that uh after he was prayed for, he
[31:10] was delivered of all pain pain
[31:12] medication
[31:14] and he said it quit me. I didn't quit
[31:17] it. So, praise the Lord for that,

[41:27] of Malachi.
[41:34] Can't you see
[41:36] [Music]
[41:37] why
[41:39] I'm so happy?
[41:44] I've accepted
[41:47] the word
[41:50] of the Lord,
[41:54] the revealed
[41:58] word
[42:00] that was spoken
[42:05] by the prophet
[42:08] of Malachi
[42:11] 4.
[42:13] Amen. Lord Jesus,
[42:16] Lord, we want to thank you this morning,
[42:19] Lord, that your word has been opened up
[42:21] to us, Lord, that we're reading from an
[42:23] open book this morning, Lord, Lord. And
[42:26] it's not just about stories and ideas
[42:28] and theology,
[42:30] Lord, but it's an inheritance, Lord.
[42:32] It's a promise, Lord. It's a book with
[42:34] our name written all over it by your
[42:36] grace and your mercy, Lord, by your
[42:38] sovereign calling before the foundation
[42:40] of the world. And Lord, we're here this
[42:42] morning to claim our promises. Lord,
[42:44] we're here to read our name out of the
[42:46] book, Lord. That where you placed it,
[42:48] Lord, we want to claim it this morning,
[42:49] heavenly father. Lord, we're here to
[42:51] lift your word up. We're here to lift
[42:53] you up, Lord. We're here to just dwell
[42:55] in your presence this morning, Lord, to
[42:57] take whatever you would have for us,
[42:58] Lord, and to walk in faith and receive
[43:00] it. So, Lord, bless your people again
[43:02] this morning. We pray, Lord, minister to
[43:05] your bride. We ask in Jesus Christ's
[43:06] name we pray it. Amen. Amen. God bless
[43:09] you. Turn if you would to Numbers
[43:11] chapter 23. Numbers 23. My the church is
[43:15] looking so full all of a sudden from up
[43:17] here. We've got uh brother Filimon back
[43:19] there. I see sister Karen here with the
[43:21] boys. God bless you. Good to see you
[43:23] this morning and different ones. Amen.
[43:27] God bless you each one. Certainly want
[43:29] to wish a happy Father's Day to all the
[43:31] fathers here. Amen. God bless you.
[43:35] We're not doing a Father's Day service.
[43:36] We are a little bit but not really.
[43:38] Amen. It applies to fathers, but this
[43:40] year it was the mother's year. Maybe
[43:42] next year it'll be the father's year,
[43:43] but we're going to speak about a father
[43:44] this morning. But God bless you each one
[43:46] for your stand in the word and for
[43:48] raising your families the way that you
[43:50] ought to. Amen. God bless you. Help you
[43:52] to keep yourself there. Amen. That you
[43:54] be the high priest of your home day in
[43:55] and day out. You set an example for your
[43:57] wife and your children to follow. Amen.
[43:59] I appreciate brother Chad's testimony.
[44:01] He had shared a bit with it uh last uh
[44:03] last Wednesday, I think it was, and
[44:04] asked if he could share that. So, we
[44:06] praise the Lord. Amen. God's not dead.
[44:08] God's not dead. We're not here for
[44:09] theology, church. If you want theology,
[44:11] go someplace else. We're here to serve a
[44:13] living God. Amen. A God that moves in
[44:15] our lives, in our midst, that changes
[44:17] us. Amen. And prepares us to go in a
[44:19] rapture. Amen. God bless you. Numbers
[44:21] 23:19 says this, "God is not a man that
[44:24] he should lie, neither the son of man
[44:26] that he should repent, but he have he
[44:29] said, and shall he not do it, or have he
[44:32] spoken, and shall he not make it good?"
[44:35] Amen. God bless you. You can have your
[44:36] seats this morning. What a wonderful
[44:37] scripture. I It's kind of scary that the
[44:40] person saying this is a false prophet.
[44:43] This is Balum that said this. If you go
[44:44] and read Numbers 23, this is Balam going
[44:47] to try and curse Israel. But he says to
[44:48] Bao, he says, "I can only say what God
[44:50] puts in my mouth." And he says, "God
[44:52] isn't like man. He doesn't He doesn't
[44:53] say something that's a lie." He doesn't
[44:55] say something and then take it back. He
[44:57] says, "But if he says it, he's going to
[44:58] do it. And if he's spoken it, he's going
[45:00] to make it good." That's the God we're
[45:01] serving this morning. And I want to
[45:03] continue our thoughts. We've been
[45:04] preaching on the the life of the Holy
[45:06] Spiritfilled believer and I want to take
[45:08] another service on this thought of
[45:09] absolute power. We're going to be here
[45:10] for quite a while. I think this will be
[45:12] the kind of the apex of this this
[45:14] series. But we want to speak about
[45:15] absolute power again this morning. And
[45:18] we know uh as as I was mentioning on
[45:20] Wednesday night after brother Garfield
[45:21] preached, he was stomping all over the
[45:22] grounds that I've been studying on. But
[45:24] that's okay. We want that. Amen. God
[45:26] knows what he's doing and he can bring
[45:27] it from different angles and these
[45:29] different things. But remember last
[45:30] service we spoke about the incomplete
[45:32] power of the disciples. how they had
[45:34] power to cast out demons and they had
[45:36] power to raise the dead and heal the
[45:37] sick and all these things and yet they
[45:38] couldn't get out of their own way. We're
[45:41] not going to go there today. We're going
[45:42] to move past that. The Lord led me in a
[45:44] different direction, but we'll come
[45:45] after that maybe next Sunday, the Lord
[45:47] willing. But I want to take us back to
[45:48] the Old Testament this morning because
[45:50] we can see the types and shadows. The
[45:52] Old Testament is for our our recognition
[45:54] to see how God works and the way that
[45:56] God does things so that as we come into
[45:58] the New Testament, we see the
[45:59] fulfillment of it. We can see how he
[46:01] does it then. So, we can see how he's
[46:03] going to do it now. And what they
[46:04] received in part is what we receive in
[46:06] fullness under the covenant of grace.
[46:08] Amen. In the New Testament. But I want
[46:10] us to see as we're speaking on absolute
[46:12] power this morning. This one key thing.
[46:14] And that is power is always given with
[46:16] purpose. When God gives power, God gives
[46:19] power with purpose. Amen. And that's our
[46:21] theme this morning. Amen. If we think
[46:23] that all we need is power, then we're
[46:25] going to fail in our Christian walk.
[46:26] Because we look around today and we have
[46:28] all sorts of power. We have economic and
[46:31] financial power. We have influential
[46:32] power. We have physical power with our
[46:34] bodies and strength. Amen. We have uh
[46:37] emotional power. We have all these sorts
[46:39] of things. And yet when we look around
[46:41] what has happened with power, we see
[46:42] nothing good. Why? Because people have
[46:45] power but they don't know how to apply
[46:47] it. They don't know where to put it. And
[46:49] because in our human nature we are
[46:50] selfish. All it leads to is us abusing
[46:53] somebody and somebody abusing us back
[46:55] because we're all caught up in this in
[46:57] this stinking flesh that just wants
[46:58] what's good for itself. Amen. So the
[47:01] problem is not the power. The problem is
[47:02] the people. The problem is that we lack
[47:05] the character to use the power. The
[47:06] problem is that we lack the purpose to
[47:08] use the power. And that means that we
[47:10] lack the right motive and the right
[47:12] objective. So even when we sort of go in
[47:14] the right direction, we still break it
[47:15] apart because we do it for the wrong
[47:17] reasons. And so power when it's not
[47:19] applied with purpose just causes
[47:21] problems for everyone. But we see if we
[47:24] go back to the time of the children of
[47:26] Israel, we see how God put absolute
[47:28] power into a man's life. And we see that
[47:31] God chose Moses to be a deliverer. Amen.
[47:33] And he chose him to be a deliverer of
[47:35] the children of e of Israel from Egypt.
[47:37] And God chose Moses for a purpose.
[47:41] He didn't just say, "Moses, I've come
[47:43] down to have a relationship with you.
[47:45] Moses, I'm just revealing myself to you
[47:47] so that you can say I met God. But he
[47:49] came down in the form of a burning bush,
[47:51] in the pillar of a fire, in a plant. And
[47:53] he says, I am come down to do something,
[47:55] and you're the one I'm going to do it
[47:56] with. I'm going to use you, Moses. Amen.
[47:59] God had a reason for choosing him. And
[48:01] God gives Moses a commission when he
[48:04] meets him. And in Exodus 3, God says to
[48:06] Moses, "Come now, therefore, and I will
[48:09] send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest
[48:11] bring forth my people, the children of
[48:13] of Israel, out of Egypt." Amen. So
[48:15] Moses' commission is to bring the
[48:17] children of Israel out of Egypt. His
[48:19] commission is to deliver them out of
[48:20] slavery. His commission is to change
[48:22] their condition, if we could put it that
[48:24] way. Amen. His commission is to get them
[48:26] to believe the word of God. It's all
[48:29] tied into this one thing. But it's not
[48:31] just about taking them out of Egypt
[48:33] because he says, "And Moses said unto
[48:34] God, who am I that I should go unto
[48:36] Pharaoh that I should bring forth the
[48:38] children of Israel out of Egypt?" And
[48:40] God said, "Certainly I will be with
[48:42] thee, and this shall be a token unto
[48:45] thee that I have sent thee, when thou
[48:47] hast brought forth the children, the
[48:49] people out of Egypt. You shall serve God
[48:51] upon this mountain." Now, notice what
[48:53] God's doing. He's not just setting them
[48:55] free to take them out of bitter bondage.
[48:58] He's setting them free to worship him.
[49:01] Amen. He's got a reason for setting them
[49:03] free. And he says, "Moses, the first
[49:04] thing you're going to do is you're going
[49:06] to bring them back to the mountain where
[49:08] I gave them where I gave you your
[49:10] commission. They'll come back and I'm
[49:12] going to give them their commission."
[49:14] Amen. It's not just the message from
[49:16] Moses. I've got a message I want to give
[49:18] to them and I've got to bring them back
[49:20] to me so that they can continue this
[49:22] journey with the right mindset. It's the
[49:24] first thing he did, church. What was he
[49:26] doing? He was trying to get him to see
[49:27] what was important. What's important is
[49:30] not the land that's waiting. What's
[49:32] important is the one that promised you
[49:33] the land. Cuz if you don't go with him,
[49:35] you're not going to get the land. If you
[49:37] don't get your commission up front,
[49:38] you're going to not know what to do when
[49:39] you get to the land. He was telling
[49:41] them, you got to set the preeminence.
[49:43] And the preeminence is God. The
[49:45] preeminence is not the land. The
[49:47] preeminence is God. If you walk with
[49:48] God, you'll get the land. But without
[49:50] God, you'll never get the land. Church,
[49:52] you can go up and you can cross over.
[49:53] You'll never get the victory. He was
[49:55] setting a priority for their lives. He
[49:58] was trying to get them to a relationship
[50:00] in a new and living way that they hadn't
[50:01] had for 430 years. God was trying to
[50:05] reveal himself to them. I think we need
[50:07] to keep that in mind today. When
[50:10] somebody new is coming to church when
[50:13] we're talking to people that don't know
[50:14] Christ, we can't try and get them where
[50:16] we are. We've got to get the priority
[50:19] straight, and that is get them to Jesus
[50:20] Christ. get them to a place where they
[50:22] are established on a sure foundation
[50:24] that cannot be moved and then their
[50:27] journey they'll never get away from it.
[50:29] But if we drag them along to Canaan land
[50:31] where we're already living, what's going
[50:32] to happen is they're going to run up
[50:34] against the giant and they're not going
[50:35] to have a clue how to deal with it. Why?
[50:36] Cuz they haven't received their
[50:38] commission by the word yet. They need to
[50:40] receive a commission. Amen.
[50:43] We all have to walk the same path, but
[50:45] we can't expedite the process. It's like
[50:47] trying to help a little chick come out
[50:49] of its egg. If you do it, you'll kill
[50:50] it. You'll kill it because it's got to
[50:53] grow and mature in Christ.
[50:56] God says, I'll be with you, Moses. And
[50:58] here's the proof. I'm going to bring the
[51:00] children of Israel back to serve me like
[51:01] you're serving me. He says, "And God
[51:03] said, moreover unto Moses, thus shalt
[51:05] thou say to the children of Israel, the
[51:07] Lord God of your fathers, the God of
[51:09] Abraham, God of Isaac, the God of Jacob,
[51:11] has sent me unto you, this is my name
[51:14] forever, and this is my memorial unto
[51:16] all generations." I skipped some verses
[51:18] there. Moses says, "Who shall I say sent
[51:19] me?" He says, "I am." The everpresent
[51:22] God. Not the I was and not the I will
[51:25] be. The I am. The right here today,
[51:27] church. That's the God we're preaching
[51:29] this morning. The God that is here
[51:30] today. That's the God that takes away
[51:32] pain medication addictions. That's the
[51:34] God that heals uh pains and sicknesses
[51:37] and hurts and families. The I am, not
[51:40] the I will be.
[51:42] He says I will. But he's here right now.
[51:46] He's here right now. He says, "Go and
[51:48] gather the elders of Israel together and
[51:50] say unto them, the Lord God of your
[51:52] fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and
[51:53] Jacob have appeared to me, saying, I
[51:55] have surely visited you and have seen
[51:57] what is done unto you in Egypt. And I
[51:59] have said, I will bring you up out of
[52:01] the affliction of Egypt, unto the land
[52:03] of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the
[52:05] Amorites, the Parizzites, the Hivites,
[52:07] the Jebusites, unto a land flowing with
[52:10] milk and honey." Now, I want to
[52:12] summarize something real quickly here.
[52:14] this idea of a commission because this
[52:16] is critical when we're speaking of
[52:18] absolute power. How many would say this
[52:20] morning, I want to have absolute power
[52:22] in my life. That's the only kind of
[52:24] power I want. Absolute power. And we're
[52:26] going to dwell more on this maybe more
[52:27] in the future services what absolute
[52:29] power really means. But I want you to
[52:31] capture this that power comes with
[52:33] purpose. And the purpose comes through a
[52:35] commission. Okay? So that word
[52:38] commission in the Greek it means it is
[52:40] permission
[52:42] with full power. A commission is
[52:46] permission with full power. And we can
[52:48] see this in the military where an
[52:50] officer would receive a commission. So
[52:52] with his commissions comes three things.
[52:54] It comes with rank. It comes with
[52:56] authority. And it comes with orders.
[52:59] Okay? Comes with those three things. If
[53:02] you're a captain in the military, your
[53:03] commission is not to go sit on a chair
[53:05] in an office. Your commission is to lead
[53:07] men in a purpose or soldiers in a
[53:10] purpose. And when you go into that
[53:12] purpose, the full power of the military
[53:14] is behind you to achieve your objective.
[53:18] So it may not be war. It might be
[53:20] humanitarian effort if they've had a big
[53:21] flood somewhere. You may as a captain
[53:24] have the right to go and they say your
[53:25] orders are to go and rescue these people
[53:27] that are stuck on the roofs in these
[53:28] flooded areas. So you've got a
[53:30] commission. You've got the men to do it.
[53:32] Now you need the resources. So, you
[53:34] can't go take an aircraft carrier to do
[53:35] this. That would exceed your authority.
[53:38] That would exceed the reasonable
[53:40] expectations of rescuing people on a
[53:42] flooded river. You don't need an
[53:43] aircraft carrier. But if you need small
[53:45] boats, you need gas, you need ropes, you
[53:47] need uh life preservers, you need food
[53:49] supplies, all these different things,
[53:51] you can go for that. And when somebody
[53:53] says you can't have that, what do you
[53:54] do? You hold up your commission, you
[53:55] hold up your orders, and you say, "I've
[53:57] got a right to it." Because it's signed
[53:59] by somebody that's greater than you are.
[54:02] And so you can take whatever you need to
[54:04] do what your commission tells you to do.
[54:06] Amen. So you got three things.
[54:08] Authority, purpose, and you've got
[54:09] power. The purpose points you in the
[54:11] right direction. It tells you what
[54:14] you're supposed to do. Authority gives
[54:16] you the ability to command and take what
[54:19] you need. And power is there to enforce
[54:22] what you have asked for. That's the
[54:25] three things that come with commission.
[54:26] Amen. So you have all of that behind
[54:28] you. Now, Moses has been given a
[54:30] commission to deliver the people. And
[54:32] God puts all of his power behind Moses.
[54:36] All of his power behind Moses. He says,
[54:38] "Moses, I'll tell you what to do. You do
[54:41] it and I'll back it up." And so Moses
[54:43] goes down to Egypt and what does he do?
[54:45] God tells him what to say. Moses says
[54:47] it. And whatever Moses says happens,
[54:49] church, that's absolute power. There is
[54:52] no difference between what he says and
[54:54] what occurs because what? It's not him.
[54:56] It's God. God is now flowing through a
[54:59] channel of human flesh to produce
[55:01] something and it's a deliverance for the
[55:02] people of Israel. So Moses, now remember
[55:05] now God says, "I'll be with you. I'm
[55:07] going to deliver, but you're the one
[55:08] that's going to be doing the work,
[55:10] Moses. You've got to walk. You've got to
[55:12] talk. You've got to go back to the land
[55:14] that you run away from so long ago.
[55:16] You've got to stand before Pharaoh.
[55:18] You've got to have courage.
[55:21] But Moses, I'll be with you. But you're
[55:23] going to have to do the work, Moses.
[55:25] You're gonna have to be the boots on the
[55:26] ground for me in this. He says, "It's my
[55:29] work, but you're the one I'm going to
[55:30] work through." Church, don't ever forget
[55:32] it this way. If the commission is from
[55:34] God, it's got to be the power from God,
[55:36] too. Moses could never deliver on his
[55:39] own. He'd already tried it and it never
[55:40] worked. If my power can do it, it would
[55:42] already be done. If your power could do
[55:45] it, it would already be done. So, we've
[55:46] got to step beyond the power that we
[55:48] have in our humanity, in our mental
[55:50] faith, and we've got to step into a
[55:52] greater power. And it's the absolute
[55:54] power of almighty God channeled through
[55:56] human flesh again. And the only way it
[55:58] can come is if you accept your
[56:00] commission. You got to accept a personal
[56:02] commission by the word of God to do what
[56:04] he asks you to do. Amen. Amen. And so
[56:07] that requires a recognition that what? I
[56:10] can't do this. And therefore, the more I
[56:13] can get myself out of the way, the
[56:16] better and the sooner and the more
[56:18] complete the work is going to be. That's
[56:21] what absolute power requires. Absolute
[56:23] surrender. Absolute hands off the wheel.
[56:27] Amen.
[56:29] Moses goes down to Egypt. God tells him
[56:31] what to say. He says it and the results
[56:33] followed. Every time Moses was never
[56:35] left hanging, church, what he said, God
[56:37] did cuz God had told him to do it in the
[56:40] first place. And when Moses spoke
[56:41] judgment, judgment followed. Plague
[56:43] after plague after plague. And we know
[56:45] the effect it had. It riled up the
[56:46] Egyptians. It riled up Pharaoh. And all
[56:48] of a sudden, conditions start to get
[56:50] worse for the people of God. Their life
[56:53] starts to get harder. Now they got to
[56:55] make bricks without straw being
[56:56] supplied. They've got to go reap straw
[56:58] from stubble
[57:00] and still produce the same amount of
[57:02] bricks. And guess what? They couldn't do
[57:03] it. They couldn't do it. And so they're
[57:06] working from before sunset, sunrise to
[57:09] after sunset, and they still can hit the
[57:11] marks. Amen. And so for a season things
[57:14] are tough, but we see that after this
[57:16] tribulation and this trial that they
[57:18] have, when they come out of Israel,
[57:20] they're in perfect condition for the
[57:22] journey that's ahead. The very thing
[57:25] that they thought was persecution was
[57:27] getting them ready to walk through the
[57:29] desert mile after mile, hour after hour,
[57:32] day after day. Amen. But church, it got
[57:36] worse before it got better.
[57:39] It's going to get worse before it gets
[57:41] better. I mean, I've been talking to
[57:43] people lately and we see the things that
[57:46] are going on around this world. It's
[57:49] getting worse and it's going to get
[57:51] worse before it gets better, church,
[57:53] because we know what's happening is
[57:54] there's a system that's coming in and
[57:56] it's so close. And so what we get are
[57:59] the touches of it without the full
[58:01] reality of it. But if you're a believer
[58:03] on this earth, it's going to get worse
[58:05] before it's going to get better.
[58:08] Why? Because there's a squeeze that
[58:09] comes to prepare us for the journey. And
[58:13] it's the work of God. It's actually the
[58:15] grace of God that's getting us in a
[58:16] condition to go into a rapture and a
[58:18] resurrection.
[58:20] We know God delivered them by his mighty
[58:22] hand, brought them through the Red Sea
[58:24] and the desert. And then they come to
[58:25] Sinai and God starts to now fill in the
[58:28] gaps on this great redemption plan, this
[58:31] restoration plan of bringing them to the
[58:33] land that he promised to Abraham. and he
[58:34] said, "I'll bring you into Canaan."
[58:37] He says, "It's a wonderful land." And
[58:39] yes, there's people on there, but he
[58:41] doesn't give a whole lot of details when
[58:42] he talks to Moses, but when they come to
[58:44] Sinai, now it's time to receive a
[58:46] commission by the people. It's not just
[58:48] Moses commission, but it's the people's
[58:50] condition. Church, you'll notice God
[58:52] doesn't give his plan all upfront.
[58:55] Why? Because we try and get involved.
[58:58] You look at people that got the the
[59:00] commission early on and we always try
[59:02] and get our hands into it. We always try
[59:03] and get our fingers in the pie because
[59:05] we think we can make it happen. Look at
[59:07] what Sarah and Abraham did. We have no
[59:09] peace in the Middle East because they
[59:11] tried to make God's plan come through.
[59:13] God reveals it as we need it and only as
[59:15] far as we need for the next step.
[59:18] And God comes down and he starts to tell
[59:20] them, "Amen. Why does he do that,
[59:22] church? Why does he hold things back?"
[59:25] Not just because we try and get our
[59:26] hands into it, but because we're
[59:28] supposed to walk by faith. It's a walk
[59:30] by faith. It's a walk by faith. And so
[59:33] we've got to trust God and that as long
[59:35] as he's leading, we're good. No matter
[59:36] what we can see or what we can't see,
[59:38] what we're facing, what we don't know is
[59:39] ahead. It doesn't matter to us. What
[59:41] matters is that God is leading us. Now
[59:44] watch now. God comes down. So we read in
[59:46] Exodus 3, the commission to Moses. Now
[59:48] he says gives the commission to the
[59:49] people.
[59:51] He says, "I will send my fear before
[59:53] thee and will destroy all the people to
[59:56] whom thou shalt come. And I will make
[59:58] all thine enemies turn their backs under
[59:59] thee." We preached on this many services
[1:00:01] ago. I won't go into depth on this. He
[1:00:03] says, "And I will send hornets before
[1:00:04] thee, who shall drive out the Hivite,
[1:00:06] the Canaanite, the Hitittite from before
[1:00:07] thee. I will not drive them out from
[1:00:10] before thee in one year." This is going
[1:00:11] to be a a a process. It's going to be a
[1:00:14] process of time. He says, "Lest the land
[1:00:16] become desolate and the beasts of the
[1:00:17] field multiply against thee, but let by
[1:00:20] little and little I will drive them out
[1:00:22] from before thee until thou be increased
[1:00:24] and inherit the land." So notice how God
[1:00:27] says, "I will. I will. I will." Here's
[1:00:30] your commission. Your commission is to
[1:00:31] go out and take the land, but I'll be
[1:00:34] with you and I'm going to do the work.
[1:00:36] I'm going to do the power. I'm going to
[1:00:38] put fear into the inhabitants. I will. I
[1:00:40] will. I will. Why does he say I will so
[1:00:42] much, church? Because we always start to
[1:00:45] do comparisons. If he starts saying, you
[1:00:46] will. You will. You will. So, he says,
[1:00:49] I'm going to be the power behind this
[1:00:51] work that takes Canaan out of the land
[1:00:53] of all these powerful people, all these
[1:00:55] great wealth cities, all these people
[1:00:57] that have greater technology. They're
[1:00:59] bigger, stronger, meaner. It doesn't
[1:01:01] matter. I'm gonna do it because he knows
[1:01:03] what's going to come as a comparison at
[1:01:05] some point. And he's trying to establish
[1:01:07] the battle doesn't belong to you, but
[1:01:09] the battle belongs to God. You just have
[1:01:12] to get your sword out and walk up to
[1:01:14] that person. I'll make sure the point
[1:01:16] goes where it needs to go. It's not you
[1:01:19] that's going to win. I'm going to win
[1:01:20] it. I just need you to walk in front of
[1:01:22] me. I just need you to take me at my
[1:01:25] word. That's all God's looking for.
[1:01:27] Amen. Why? Because in comparisons,
[1:01:29] believers always lose. We always lose
[1:01:32] when we compare ourselves to other
[1:01:34] people, ourselves to circumstances,
[1:01:36] ourselves to sickness, or whatever it
[1:01:38] might be. We always lose because in and
[1:01:41] of ourselves, we cannot win. We cannot
[1:01:43] do it. Everything is greater than us.
[1:01:46] But Paul said, "I can do all things
[1:01:48] through Christ which strengthens me."
[1:01:50] That's what absolute power is. And God
[1:01:52] says, "I'll be with you. I've prepared a
[1:01:55] way to get them out.
[1:01:57] I just need you to go. Your commission
[1:02:00] is to go. Walk forward and don't stop
[1:02:03] walking until every single one of those
[1:02:05] is out of the land. Amen. God's speaking
[1:02:08] this to Moses. Moses brings it to the
[1:02:10] people. Says, "Here's your task. Here's
[1:02:12] your commission. Walk forward. It's thus
[1:02:15] sayeth the Lord.
[1:02:18] It's thus sayeth the Lord. His word
[1:02:20] can't fail. You just have to accept it.
[1:02:23] You just got to walk forward." Amen. But
[1:02:26] I want to to show something here this
[1:02:28] morning. This is really the gist of this
[1:02:30] this thought this morning because I want
[1:02:32] us to look at the condition of the
[1:02:34] people as they came out of Israel. I
[1:02:36] want you to see how God does these
[1:02:38] things because they were slaves in
[1:02:40] bitter bondage as brother Mark would say
[1:02:44] or as Charlton H would say I guess
[1:02:46] really bitter bondage. And the scripture
[1:02:50] doesn't say they were all 25 years old.
[1:02:53] They were old. They were middle-aged and
[1:02:56] they were young. You had tiny little
[1:02:59] ones and you had really old ones. But
[1:03:01] watch what the scripture says. When they
[1:03:03] came out of Egypt,
[1:03:05] he says, "He brought them forth also
[1:03:07] with silver and gold. And there was not
[1:03:10] one feeble person among their tribes."
[1:03:15] That word feeble is is is pretty heavy.
[1:03:20] someone that's feeble. It says it means
[1:03:22] to totter or stumble or waver or falter.
[1:03:28] To be cast down, overthrown, decayed,
[1:03:33] ruined, weak, and injured.
[1:03:36] Okay? God said they weren't like that.
[1:03:41] So, they didn't stumble. They didn't
[1:03:42] fall. They weren't injured. They weren't
[1:03:44] weak. They weren't falling apart. They
[1:03:46] didn't have conditions that kept them
[1:03:48] from walking. But every single person
[1:03:51] that walked out of Egypt walked out with
[1:03:53] their own strength, with their own
[1:03:55] health. They were all able-bodied. Every
[1:03:57] single one, church, there wasn't a one
[1:03:59] that had been destroyed by slavery.
[1:04:02] Rather, the slavery had prepared them
[1:04:04] for the journey that was ahead.
[1:04:08] Remember what Peter said that the trial
[1:04:09] of your faith would be more precious
[1:04:11] than gold tried in the fire. What you're
[1:04:14] going through is preparing you for what
[1:04:15] God has for you next. and you'll walk in
[1:04:18] stronger than you would have if he just
[1:04:19] left you alone. We're not here for a
[1:04:21] life of ease. We're here to get ready to
[1:04:23] go. That's what we're here for. Amen,
[1:04:27] church. This that the heavy bondage was
[1:04:30] God's sovereign grace to that people.
[1:04:34] We don't think of things that way, but
[1:04:36] God under that had gotten them to a
[1:04:38] place where they didn't get sick, they
[1:04:40] didn't get weak, they were strong.
[1:04:42] Didn't matter what you did to them, they
[1:04:43] just got better and better. And that was
[1:04:46] God's choosing. That was God's
[1:04:47] preparation. That was God's grace to
[1:04:49] them was that they walked out that way.
[1:04:51] There's no explanation for it. Old
[1:04:53] people are old.
[1:04:55] I don't want to name names, but they
[1:04:57] don't move like they used to anymore.
[1:05:03] I don't move like I used to. My wife and
[1:05:06] I were talking. I said, "How old was so
[1:05:07] and so?" She says, "Oh, in her 50s, not
[1:05:09] that old." She said, "We they're not
[1:05:11] that old because we're getting so close
[1:05:12] to 50 now." And it's true. But guess
[1:05:15] what? Old people are old and that comes
[1:05:17] with limitations. Young people are
[1:05:19] young. Babies are young. That comes with
[1:05:21] limitations. But yet they went out,
[1:05:23] church. No limitations on them. What is
[1:05:26] it? It's the sovereign preparation and
[1:05:28] grace of God for the journey ahead.
[1:05:31] But catch this. They don't have a
[1:05:33] commission yet. They're merely walking
[1:05:35] along following the pillar of cloud and
[1:05:38] the pillar of fire. That's all they're
[1:05:40] doing. But God has still prepared them
[1:05:42] for that little walk, that little
[1:05:44] journey to bring them there. Amen. And
[1:05:46] then when they came to the place where
[1:05:47] God revealed himself personally, what
[1:05:49] does God do? He gives them a commission.
[1:05:52] He says, "Now
[1:05:55] grace has served its purpose.
[1:05:58] Now we've got to walk beyond grace.
[1:06:00] Grace isn't going away, but grace has to
[1:06:03] become something else." Amen.
[1:06:08] Grace has to turn into faith at some
[1:06:10] point.
[1:06:11] Grace has to turn into faith at some
[1:06:12] point. We'll get into it in a minute.
[1:06:14] But notice now they receive their
[1:06:15] commission and he says the commission is
[1:06:17] go into the land of Canaan, destroy the
[1:06:20] inhabitants and take what they have and
[1:06:21] make it yours. And he said, "Every one
[1:06:24] of you has a place in that land.
[1:06:27] All you got to do is go take it." So
[1:06:29] their commission now comes with
[1:06:31] inheritance. So we're not just here,
[1:06:33] church, to fight for our brothers and
[1:06:34] sisters. We're here to fight for me,
[1:06:36] too. It's not selfish. It's by
[1:06:39] commission. If God says there's a
[1:06:42] portion that's for you, I'm allowed to
[1:06:43] fight what's for me. I can't just have
[1:06:45] everything for Sister Amber or Brother
[1:06:47] Mark. He's got things in there for me,
[1:06:49] too. And I'm allowed to fight for what
[1:06:50] belongs to me. In fact, I'm commissioned
[1:06:52] to fight for what belongs to me. But I
[1:06:54] don't get to leave the rest of you
[1:06:55] behind. We're all in this together.
[1:06:57] We've all got to receive our
[1:06:59] inheritance. And until we're going all
[1:07:01] going in, we can't receive our
[1:07:02] inheritance. So, we got to get everyone
[1:07:04] across the finish line. Amen. But that
[1:07:06] that commission in Exodus 23 wrote the
[1:07:09] names of every single Israelite tribe
[1:07:11] and family into the promised land. And
[1:07:14] so you could pull up a map and you could
[1:07:15] see where all the tribes were supposed
[1:07:16] to go. And you could say, "Hey, I'm of
[1:07:18] the tribe of Issachar. This is where
[1:07:19] we're going to go. Boy, I really like
[1:07:21] that land. Maybe we could get that over
[1:07:23] by the lake there. I really like lake
[1:07:24] property." And you could write your name
[1:07:26] in there. I'm going to go talk to Joshua
[1:07:27] and see if maybe we can pencil in that
[1:07:29] that lakefront property up front.
[1:07:32] There's something in it for you, church.
[1:07:34] We're not fighting without benefit.
[1:07:36] There's something that's in it for us.
[1:07:38] Amen. So God didn't just send them a
[1:07:40] deliverer. God sent them a deliverer
[1:07:43] with a message,
[1:07:45] with a commission. See, too often,
[1:07:48] church, we put it on the prophet. We put
[1:07:50] it on the preacher. We put it on the
[1:07:51] five-fold ministry. But they're coming
[1:07:53] with a message for you. Behold, I send
[1:07:56] unto you, Elijah the prophet. Elijah
[1:08:00] didn't come for himself. He came for you
[1:08:01] with a commission. Moses was not sent
[1:08:03] for himself. He was sent for a people to
[1:08:06] deliver them with a commission that
[1:08:07] would take them into the promised land
[1:08:09] that would write their name into the
[1:08:11] word of God so they could have faith to
[1:08:12] take it and go and accept it, to take it
[1:08:15] away. Amen.
[1:08:17] God made sure they were fit and strong
[1:08:19] and healthy coming out of Egypt. Amen.
[1:08:22] God took care of his part, church. His
[1:08:24] part's to prepare. So now he says, "Take
[1:08:26] what I've given you and use it for the
[1:08:28] commission that I've given you." But
[1:08:30] then they come to Kadesh Barnea. We know
[1:08:32] and God is or Moses sends the 12 spies
[1:08:35] over and they go out and they look
[1:08:36] around the land and they come back and
[1:08:38] 10 of the 12 say, "Hey, it's a great
[1:08:40] land. It's got everything. Look at the
[1:08:41] size of these grapes."
[1:08:44] They brought back literal proof that the
[1:08:46] word of God was right. But they said,
[1:08:48] "But
[1:08:50] but we're too small. We're too weak.
[1:08:52] They're too big. They're too strong. We
[1:08:55] can't take it." And they backed down
[1:08:57] from their commission.
[1:09:00] They had every proof that what God had
[1:09:02] said was right, but then they put
[1:09:04] themselves in comparison to the people
[1:09:06] there. They said, "We're too strong."
[1:09:07] And they backed down from their
[1:09:08] commission, church. They threw in the
[1:09:10] towel. They didn't even fight. They
[1:09:12] waved the white flag of surrender.
[1:09:15] Didn't even draw a sword. Didn't do a
[1:09:17] single thing. Amen. And in doing so,
[1:09:19] they lost their inheritance.
[1:09:22] Look at what God said. He says, "Because
[1:09:24] all these men which have seen my glory
[1:09:26] and my miracles which I did in Egypt and
[1:09:28] in the wilderness and have tempted me
[1:09:30] now these 10 times." Church does not
[1:09:32] give people opportunity
[1:09:34] 10 times.
[1:09:37] 10 times they provoked him. He says,
[1:09:40] "And they have not hearkened to my
[1:09:41] voice. Surely they shall not see the
[1:09:44] lamb which I swore unto their fathers,
[1:09:46] neither shall any of them that provoked
[1:09:47] me see it." How did they provoke God,
[1:09:49] church? Unbelief.
[1:09:53] It doesn't matter what the actions are.
[1:09:54] It always starts with unbelief. And they
[1:09:56] disbelieved God. And they murmured and
[1:09:58] they complained and they turned against
[1:10:00] Moses. They went and they worshiped the
[1:10:01] golden calf. They went with all these
[1:10:03] things. What started it? Unbelief.
[1:10:06] That's how you provoke God. You refuse
[1:10:08] to take him at his word. He says, "But
[1:10:10] my servant Caleb, because he had another
[1:10:12] spirit with him and hath followed me
[1:10:17] fully."
[1:10:19] Fully.
[1:10:21] Everybody came to Kesh Barnea,
[1:10:24] but only two people followed him fully.
[1:10:27] He says, "Him will I bring into the land
[1:10:29] wherein to he went, and his seed shall
[1:10:31] possess it." Father, fathers, this
[1:10:33] morning, there's your scripture. You do
[1:10:35] what God says, it carries down. You've
[1:10:38] got a promise for your children and for
[1:10:40] your children's children.
[1:10:43] That's what Acts 238 says.
[1:10:46] Somebody's got to possess the land and
[1:10:48] bring it in so that people behind them
[1:10:50] can benefit from it. But look what he
[1:10:53] says because he had another spirit with
[1:10:55] him. You know, we're supposed to discern
[1:10:56] spirits.
[1:10:58] How do we discern spirits, church?
[1:11:01] How a person reacts to the full word of
[1:11:05] God.
[1:11:07] Because listen, I can take this and I
[1:11:09] can turn this into a beautiful gospel
[1:11:10] that suits a life of ease and luxury.
[1:11:14] Nobody hates me. Everybody loves me.
[1:11:16] That's not the full word.
[1:11:19] That's Joel. What's his face word,
[1:11:22] right? Incomplete.
[1:11:24] And that's why he's got a church that
[1:11:26] brings in one half million dollars in
[1:11:27] tithes every Sunday,
[1:11:30] right?
[1:11:32] Because he's got a a gospel that tickles
[1:11:34] the itching ears. But how do you respond
[1:11:36] to the full word?
[1:11:38] How do we respond when somebody corrects
[1:11:40] us instead of us correcting them?
[1:11:43] See, when it's applied to us, that's
[1:11:44] when we still really start to see
[1:11:46] discerning. Because if we can't take it,
[1:11:49] we're in no position to give it. Amen.
[1:11:53] What happened? They came all under the
[1:11:56] same conditions, the same pillar of
[1:11:57] fire, the same signs and wonders. They
[1:11:59] all came up to Kadesh Barnea and then
[1:12:01] they backed away. And it showed,
[1:12:04] scripture says Caleb had a different
[1:12:06] spirit.
[1:12:08] When it came to their part to do
[1:12:10] something, that's when they backed down.
[1:12:12] As long as God was doing all the work,
[1:12:13] they were happy. But at the minute God
[1:12:15] says, "You got something to do." They
[1:12:16] said, "Sorry, not on my watch. I'm just
[1:12:19] going to stay over here where there's no
[1:12:20] swords, no giants, no battles.
[1:12:24] I'm going to go back to an easy gospel."
[1:12:26] They backed away.
[1:12:29] Joshua and Caleb were under a different
[1:12:31] spirit. Joshua said, "We can make it."
[1:12:34] Caleb said, "We can do it." How do you
[1:12:36] know we can do it? He said, "Because God
[1:12:38] said so, and we're going over. We're
[1:12:39] going to make it and we're going to do
[1:12:41] it." He says, "And away they went. They
[1:12:43] took off to the land and they got the
[1:12:45] evidence of the Holy Spirit and they
[1:12:47] came back to prove it. The lamb was
[1:12:49] good. It was bearing good grapes." He
[1:12:51] says, "I'm glad of it, aren't you? Oh
[1:12:52] my. Just eat them and slobbering like a
[1:12:54] horse eating clover." That's right. Yes,
[1:12:56] sir. Just having a big time and enjoy
[1:12:59] it. He says, "What do I care what the
[1:13:01] world says?" He says, "It means nothing
[1:13:03] to me."
[1:13:06] See, here's the problem. If you don't
[1:13:09] put your name in the commission,
[1:13:11] you fail when the time comes.
[1:13:14] If everybody else has got to do it
[1:13:16] except you, you're going to fail when
[1:13:18] the situation rises up, when
[1:13:19] circumstances come, when sickness comes,
[1:13:21] hard times comes. When you got to lay
[1:13:24] your life on the line, when you got to
[1:13:25] lay your career on the line, you got to
[1:13:26] lay your marriage on the line. You got
[1:13:27] to lay your family on the line.
[1:13:30] Got to lay your body on the line. Got to
[1:13:31] lay your influence on the line. Got to
[1:13:33] lay your friendships on the line. Got to
[1:13:35] lay opportunities on the line. business
[1:13:36] owners.
[1:13:40] You got to see it's your commission.
[1:13:42] It's not just for Moses.
[1:13:46] It's for everybody.
[1:13:48] You've got a commission this morning.
[1:13:50] It's not just the ministry. Our
[1:13:51] commission is to deliver it to you. But
[1:13:53] I've got to achieve it the same way
[1:13:54] you've got to achieve it. I've got to go
[1:13:56] in and possess my land the way you got
[1:13:58] to go in and possess your land. Amen. So
[1:14:01] why? So we can move forward with
[1:14:02] purpose.
[1:14:04] church. We can't just be bumbling around
[1:14:05] and as Christians, we're here for
[1:14:08] purpose. We're here for a purpose. And
[1:14:10] your purpose comes from your commission.
[1:14:12] Amen. If the word is true, it has to
[1:14:15] always be true. It's not true one day
[1:14:16] and wrong the next. If it's ever true,
[1:14:18] it's got to be true. Amen. And that's
[1:14:20] what held Joshua and Caleb. And so, as
[1:14:22] they went into the promised land, they
[1:14:24] were going in with a set of filters on.
[1:14:27] They were going in with a set of word
[1:14:29] filters. And all they were looking for,
[1:14:32] cuz remember what Moses said. He says,
[1:14:34] "Go in and get evidence
[1:14:36] that it's a good land." And so they went
[1:14:39] in with the intention of proving that it
[1:14:42] was a good land. So they went in and
[1:14:44] they've got now their commission
[1:14:45] goggles. They've got word goggles on. So
[1:14:47] what do they see? They see the milk.
[1:14:48] They see the honey. They see the grapes.
[1:14:50] They see the fertile land. They see
[1:14:52] wonderful places for their families and
[1:14:54] friends to live. And that's all they
[1:14:56] see. Yes, they know that there are
[1:14:59] giants there, but that is of no
[1:15:00] consequence because that has nothing to
[1:15:03] do with their commission. The commission
[1:15:05] was go prove it's a good land. They said
[1:15:07] it's a good land.
[1:15:09] What about the people? Well, we've got a
[1:15:11] commission to deal with those people.
[1:15:12] That's why we're not worried about it.
[1:15:14] What we're worried about is is it as God
[1:15:16] said? Yes, it's as God said. Great. Then
[1:15:18] we've got a commission to go and throw
[1:15:19] everybody out of it. That's what they
[1:15:21] went in with. Amen. They took everything
[1:15:24] that they had experienced to that point
[1:15:26] and they said one thing, God is
[1:15:28] faithful.
[1:15:30] Everything they had to this point said,
[1:15:31] "God is faithful." So when they went
[1:15:33] into the land, all they wanted to see is
[1:15:35] is God faithful again? And they went in
[1:15:37] believing that God was faithful. Not
[1:15:39] trying to prove God, but looking for
[1:15:42] evidence of what they already believed
[1:15:44] by the word.
[1:15:46] Church, we've got to go through
[1:15:48] circumstances looking for what matches
[1:15:50] up with the word and throwing everything
[1:15:52] else aside because Satan's going to
[1:15:54] throw everything else at us. He's going
[1:15:56] to throw the kitchen sink at us, trying
[1:15:58] to distract us. But we've got to have
[1:16:00] blinders on that see only what the word
[1:16:02] says about the situation, and that'll
[1:16:04] carry us through. Amen. And so Jake, uh,
[1:16:07] Caleb and Joshua go in and they are
[1:16:09] blinded to circumstances that would
[1:16:11] break down their faith. They don't see
[1:16:13] it. Doesn't bother them. Amen. The word
[1:16:17] of God was their absolute for their
[1:16:19] vision.
[1:16:21] They could only see what the word said.
[1:16:23] That's the place we have to come to. I
[1:16:26] only see, I only declare, I only
[1:16:28] testify, I only confess what the word
[1:16:31] says about my situation and let
[1:16:33] everything else go aside. What does it
[1:16:36] matter? What do I care what the world
[1:16:38] says? It means nothing to me. Cuz what?
[1:16:41] Nothing they say is true anyways.
[1:16:44] Let every man's word be a lie and God's
[1:16:47] word be true.
[1:16:50] We've got to stand, church. We've got to
[1:16:52] stand. And once we've stand, stand.
[1:16:55] Don't move back. Don't let circumstances
[1:16:58] push you back. Raise up a standard of
[1:17:00] the spirit in your heart and in your
[1:17:02] life and say, "Lord, I'm not moving.
[1:17:05] I'm not moving. You've given me a
[1:17:07] commission." Israel came out of Egypt
[1:17:10] healthy, able-bodied, whole, strong. And
[1:17:13] when they came to Kadesh Barnea, nothing
[1:17:15] had changed. They were still strong.
[1:17:17] They were still whole. They were still
[1:17:19] healthy. They weren't getting sick. They
[1:17:20] weren't getting feeble. They weren't
[1:17:22] getting blisters on their feet. Their
[1:17:24] knees were still in good condition.
[1:17:25] Nobody had broken an ankle. Everything
[1:17:28] was exactly as they came out. Amen. God
[1:17:31] had prepared them for that journey. God
[1:17:33] had prepared them to get them to a place
[1:17:34] of going in. But their able-bodied
[1:17:37] condition is not what made them fit
[1:17:38] soldiers.
[1:17:40] It just got them to the place where they
[1:17:42] could start to fight. But what makes
[1:17:43] them a fit soldier is taking God at his
[1:17:46] word. Cuz the people they were facing
[1:17:48] were bigger, faster, stronger, meaner,
[1:17:50] better trained. Their fit bodies weren't
[1:17:52] going to happen. But the fit body took
[1:17:54] away what? One thing, their excuses.
[1:17:58] I can't get there.
[1:18:01] If I can't walk, I can't fight. What it
[1:18:03] did was it made them able to walk to
[1:18:05] where God could finally do what he said
[1:18:07] he was going to do. It took away their
[1:18:09] excuses. Amen. Took away their reason to
[1:18:12] not fight at all.
[1:18:15] Took away their excuse for sitting
[1:18:16] still.
[1:18:19] What' they do? They back down.
[1:18:22] When you back down, church, there comes
[1:18:24] a point where God has to bring judgment.
[1:18:27] I'm not preaching that to you this
[1:18:29] morning, but I'm preaching consequences.
[1:18:32] Listen what God said to Moses. He says,
[1:18:34] "Your carcasses shall fall in this
[1:18:36] wilderness, and all that were numbered
[1:18:38] of you according to your whole number
[1:18:39] from 20 years old and upward, which have
[1:18:41] murmured against me. Doubtless you shall
[1:18:44] not come into the land concerning which
[1:18:45] I swear to make you dwell therein, save
[1:18:48] Caleb, except Caleb, the son of Japuna,
[1:18:50] and Joshua the son of Nun, but your
[1:18:52] little ones, which you said should be a
[1:18:54] praise." See, they said, "Well, it's
[1:18:55] it's our kids that are going to going to
[1:18:57] suffer here
[1:18:59] cuz we're going to die and then they're
[1:19:00] going to take our kids." He says, "The
[1:19:02] kids," he says, "you little ones which
[1:19:04] you said said should be a prey, them
[1:19:06] will I bring in, and they shall know the
[1:19:08] land which you have despised. But as for
[1:19:10] you, your carcasses, they shall f fall
[1:19:12] in this wilderness, and your children
[1:19:13] shall wander in the wilderness for 40
[1:19:15] years and bear your whoredoms until your
[1:19:18] carcasses shall be wasted in the
[1:19:20] wilderness." God comes down. He says,
[1:19:22] "Everyone that's 20 years or older is
[1:19:24] going to die in the wilderness. And in
[1:19:26] 40 years, everyone's dead.
[1:19:30] No exceptions except Joshua and Caleb.
[1:19:32] Everybody's going to die.
[1:19:35] Can you imagine what that would do to
[1:19:36] the people? We knew what it did to the
[1:19:38] people. They were mourning because they
[1:19:41] couldn't go into the because they
[1:19:42] refused to go into the land. Then God
[1:19:44] comes down in judgment and says, "You're
[1:19:45] not going to walk." And then they cry
[1:19:47] again. And then they wake up and they
[1:19:48] say, "You know what? We're going to go
[1:19:49] in." And Moses says, "Don't do it. You
[1:19:52] missed your chance. God's not with you."
[1:19:53] And they went in and they lost a bunch
[1:19:55] of people. And then they went back in
[1:19:56] the desert and they walked around for 40
[1:19:58] years until they all died.
[1:20:00] I'm not trying to minimize the judgment
[1:20:02] here, but there's one simple truth here.
[1:20:05] They were unbelievers.
[1:20:08] They were unbelievers.
[1:20:10] They always were unbelievers
[1:20:13] when they came out under the blessings
[1:20:15] of God. They were unbelievers when they
[1:20:17] walked through the desert. They were
[1:20:19] unbelievers when the pillar of fire was
[1:20:21] above them. They were un unbelievers
[1:20:23] when mana came down. They were still
[1:20:24] unbelievers. Why? Because every time a
[1:20:27] hardship came up, they started
[1:20:28] complaining and murmuring. They never
[1:20:30] trusted God. Why? Because they were
[1:20:33] unbelievers. Now consider Caleb and
[1:20:35] Joshua though. See, sometimes we pay the
[1:20:38] price for other people's mistakes. So
[1:20:40] Caleb and Joshua are saying, "We can go
[1:20:42] in. We're ready to go." I have a feeling
[1:20:44] if Moses said, "Caleb and Joshua, you
[1:20:45] can go in today." They would have went
[1:20:47] in. They said, "We'll go in. We'll take
[1:20:49] our portion if nothing else."
[1:20:52] But now they're bound to 40 years of
[1:20:54] walking around the desert with a bunch
[1:20:56] of unbelievers.
[1:20:58] Not only that, but they're going to see
[1:21:00] their friends, they're going to see
[1:21:02] their family, they're going to see the
[1:21:03] people they respected
[1:21:05] get sick, fall away, and die over the
[1:21:08] next 40 years. And look at Caleb.
[1:21:10] Caleb's 40 now. In those days, they
[1:21:13] lived longer than we do. Caleb at 40
[1:21:16] would be like a 25-year-old today. Caleb
[1:21:18] is in his prime.
[1:21:20] He's in the prime condition to go
[1:21:22] fighting wars for a while. And now Caleb
[1:21:24] is going to come out of this and he's
[1:21:26] going to be 80 when he goes in. I don't
[1:21:29] know if you know this, but 80 is not
[1:21:31] prime for fighting wars. That's old.
[1:21:35] Nobody here is 80.
[1:21:38] Can you imagine brother Gerald going to
[1:21:39] war? That's what Caleb would be. So
[1:21:42] Caleb has lost his golden window of
[1:21:44] opportunity to go and take the land.
[1:21:47] He's going to be too old to fight. He's
[1:21:50] going to be too old to fight.
[1:21:53] Remember, we're preaching on absolute
[1:21:54] power. And I want us to look at Caleb
[1:21:55] this morning because he's the type of
[1:21:57] the bride.
[1:21:59] Every Israelite started out in the same
[1:22:01] condition regardless of their age,
[1:22:03] regardless of what they believed.
[1:22:06] It was a mixed multitude. Remember, but
[1:22:09] it was the sovereign grace of God that
[1:22:12] brought them out. Amen. But like I said
[1:22:14] earlier, church, there comes a time
[1:22:15] where grace has to turn into faith
[1:22:18] because you're saved by grace, but you
[1:22:21] walk by faith. Remember, scripture says
[1:22:23] without faith, it's impossible to please
[1:22:25] God.
[1:22:27] You've got to take that grace and it's
[1:22:29] got to grow into something that's
[1:22:30] greater than that. Amen. Grace called
[1:22:32] Abraham out, but faith made him keep
[1:22:35] walking.
[1:22:37] Grace found David out in the in the
[1:22:38] pasture with the sheep, but it was faith
[1:22:41] that kept him walking towards the crown
[1:22:42] of Israel. and kept him in the right
[1:22:43] condition to receive it. Right? Grace
[1:22:46] calls you, but faith makes you walk
[1:22:48] through day by day. Amen. It's the It's
[1:22:50] the grace of God that calls us out. But
[1:22:52] at some point, it has to turn into the
[1:22:54] faith of God. And that only comes one
[1:22:56] way, church. Personal revelation. A
[1:22:59] personal revelation to see yourself in
[1:23:02] the word of God and to start acting on
[1:23:03] it. That's when you know grace is turned
[1:23:06] into faith. Grace never goes away, but
[1:23:09] faith comes out of that grace and it
[1:23:11] starts to produce a walk that lives by
[1:23:13] the word of God. Amen. And it comes to a
[1:23:15] place where we're not just now merely
[1:23:16] bumbling along in grace. That's what we
[1:23:19] are as young babes in Christ. We're
[1:23:20] bumbling in grace. I can see some smiles
[1:23:22] here. That's what we are, aren't we?
[1:23:24] We're just little babes in Christ. We're
[1:23:26] bumbling around. We're banging our head
[1:23:27] and we're falling down. And it doesn't
[1:23:29] matter because there's a big cushion of
[1:23:30] grace. It's like God has put pillows all
[1:23:33] around us to keep us from killing
[1:23:35] ourselves.
[1:23:36] It's grace that our children live as
[1:23:38] long as they do. But they're surrounded
[1:23:40] by grace. They're surrounded by a
[1:23:41] structure, a skeleton that is meant to
[1:23:43] absorb the blows. That's grace. But
[1:23:46] there comes a day where it has to harden
[1:23:47] and strengthen. So now they can do work.
[1:23:50] They can do feats of strength. They can
[1:23:52] do athletics. They can withstand the
[1:23:55] burden of day-to-day life. Grace has to
[1:23:57] turn into faith. Amen. At some point, we
[1:24:00] have to see ourselves in the word of
[1:24:01] God. Not just grace, I'm saved, but
[1:24:04] faith to start doing something according
[1:24:06] to the word of God. Listen to this. He
[1:24:08] says the biggest part of our faith is
[1:24:10] mental faith. That's where we start. He
[1:24:14] says by hearing the word, it brings us
[1:24:16] to a mental recognition of God. But if
[1:24:19] this this revelation coming from above,
[1:24:21] if it ever strikes this heart, there is
[1:24:23] a godly spiritual faith. He says, then
[1:24:26] what does that faith do? That faith
[1:24:28] recognizes only the word. No matter what
[1:24:32] anyone else says, it only recognizes the
[1:24:34] word because in the beginning was the
[1:24:36] word. The word was with God and the word
[1:24:38] was God. And he says the word is still
[1:24:40] God and the word was made flesh and
[1:24:42] dwelt among us. He says and when the
[1:24:45] word itself,
[1:24:47] the word itself is pouring into our
[1:24:50] faith, our mental faith becomes a
[1:24:53] spiritual revelation. Church, that's
[1:24:56] what's happening when you're in church.
[1:24:58] That's what's happening when you're
[1:24:59] under the hearing of the word. When
[1:25:00] you're reading your Bible, when you're
[1:25:02] listening to a message, whatever it
[1:25:03] might be, what is it? It's the word
[1:25:05] itself pouring into your faith to turn
[1:25:08] it into a personal revelation. Amen. It
[1:25:11] makes our faith come alive. It puts our
[1:25:13] faith into action. That's what's
[1:25:16] happening under the hearing of the word.
[1:25:18] And he says, "And upon this foundation,
[1:25:20] I'll build my church." See, not upon a
[1:25:22] mental conception of church joining, a
[1:25:24] mental conception of that. He says upon
[1:25:27] the revelation when those streams of
[1:25:30] grace have poured into the mental faith
[1:25:32] that you've got.
[1:25:35] What is mental faith? I believe it.
[1:25:39] Church, what is spiritual faith? I
[1:25:42] receive it. It is mine. He says, "And it
[1:25:45] takes streams of grace to produce that
[1:25:48] with the word coming down. The streams
[1:25:50] of grace have poured into that mental
[1:25:52] faith that you've got." He says, "Then
[1:25:53] upon this, a spiritual revelation, I'll
[1:25:56] build my church, and the gates of hell
[1:25:58] can't prevail against it." See, he says
[1:26:00] that shows that they would be against
[1:26:02] it, but it'll never prevail. Oh, what a
[1:26:04] glorious thing. Jesus never said the
[1:26:07] gates of hell won't prevail against
[1:26:09] grace.
[1:26:10] Why? Cuz church, there's a day where
[1:26:12] grace will stop. There's a day where he
[1:26:15] comes off of the mercy seat and all
[1:26:17] that's left is judgment. There's a day
[1:26:19] where grace ends and judgment starts.
[1:26:22] Amen. But what did he say? He says,
[1:26:25] "It's against this revelation. I'll
[1:26:27] build my church and the gates of hell
[1:26:30] will never prevail against it." Why is
[1:26:32] that, church? Because revelation brings
[1:26:35] faith.
[1:26:37] And with faith comes the power to act on
[1:26:40] the word of God. And when you act on the
[1:26:42] word of God, then the power of God steps
[1:26:44] into you to produce the thing that
[1:26:46] you're believing in. It's not you that
[1:26:48] won't fail. It's the word flowing
[1:26:50] through you that won't fail.
[1:26:52] Satan can't do that. Satan's going
[1:26:54] around like a roaring lion. He's going
[1:26:55] to throw everything he's got at us, but
[1:26:57] he cannot stop that word from coming
[1:26:59] forth. It's like we read in Numbers 23.
[1:27:01] Has God said it and will he not do it?
[1:27:04] Has he not given it? Will he not produce
[1:27:05] it? That is what holds us. Amen. Faith
[1:27:09] is a revelation of the will of God. And
[1:27:12] when you know that it's the will of God,
[1:27:13] then you can step into it and say, "I'm
[1:27:15] believing it. I'm acting on it. I'm
[1:27:17] confessing it. I'm testifying to it.
[1:27:19] Why? Because you can set your soul on
[1:27:21] it. It will not fail. It will not fail.
[1:27:25] That's what absolute power is looking
[1:27:26] for. That's what God's looking for is a
[1:27:28] people that will stand on his word
[1:27:30] alone.
[1:27:32] That's it. And when you stand on his
[1:27:34] word, you take him at his word. That's
[1:27:35] when God steps into the situation. And
[1:27:37] nobody beats God. Nobody beats God.
[1:27:42] Brother Ram says it this way. He says,
[1:27:43] "What is faith?" Faith is something
[1:27:45] that's revealed to you. It's not yet,
[1:27:47] but you believe it will be. He says,
[1:27:49] "Faith is a revelation of the will of
[1:27:51] God." Now, remember what Paul said in
[1:27:53] Hebrews. He says, "Without faith, it is
[1:27:55] impossible to please God." Why does he
[1:27:57] say that? Because faith is a revelation
[1:27:58] of the will of God. And you can't please
[1:28:01] God unless you're doing what God wants
[1:28:02] you to do. So faith is a revelation of
[1:28:04] the will of God. Then you start to do
[1:28:06] what God wants and that pleases God.
[1:28:09] Well, what Jesus said, he says, "I do
[1:28:10] only that which the father tells me to,
[1:28:13] and that is my satisfying portion. That
[1:28:15] is my meat is to do the will of him that
[1:28:17] sent me. You can't please God unless
[1:28:19] you're doing what he wants. Amen.
[1:28:20] Remember we've read it before the
[1:28:22] scripture where they say they come to
[1:28:23] him and they say, "Listen, we did all
[1:28:24] these wonderful things in your name. We
[1:28:26] cast out devils. We healed the sick. We
[1:28:28] did all these things." He says, "Depart
[1:28:29] from me, you workers of iniquity. I
[1:28:30] never knew you." Why? Because they did
[1:28:32] good things, but they didn't do his
[1:28:34] will. Why? Because they rejected his
[1:28:36] word. And when they rejected his word,
[1:28:38] they rejected his revelation, which
[1:28:40] means they could never find his will.
[1:28:43] It's rejecting the word that catches the
[1:28:45] people. It's not Good intentions are
[1:28:47] always there. Good intentions are always
[1:28:49] there, but you got to catch the mind of
[1:28:51] God. And that comes by a revelation of
[1:28:53] his word. And when you reject his word,
[1:28:55] you can't be in his will. And therefore,
[1:28:57] you can never please him. And that's
[1:28:59] when you're cast into outer darkness.
[1:29:00] And there's just weep weeping and
[1:29:01] wailing and nashing of teeth. That's all
[1:29:03] that's left. You go to a white throne
[1:29:05] judgment. It's not important to do
[1:29:07] things for God. It's important to find
[1:29:10] the will of God and do those things.
[1:29:13] Those are two completely different
[1:29:14] things. Lord, I'm going to go out and do
[1:29:16] this. Lord, I'm going to go out and do
[1:29:18] that. Doesn't matter.
[1:29:20] Remember what scripture says. Paul says,
[1:29:22] you know, we say we today we'll go and
[1:29:24] do such and such and tomorrow we'll do
[1:29:25] such and such. He says do it if say if
[1:29:28] the Lord wills. Because you may do it
[1:29:30] for this. You may say, Lord, I'm going
[1:29:32] to give you 30% of all my investment
[1:29:34] earnings. Does he want it?
[1:29:37] If he doesn't want it, maybe all he
[1:29:39] wants you to do is start attending
[1:29:42] church faithfully.
[1:29:45] Maybe all he wants you to do is to be a
[1:29:47] better father.
[1:29:50] Go for his will, not what makes you feel
[1:29:52] good. Because that's what we do is when
[1:29:54] we're looking for things to do for God,
[1:29:55] we do what makes us feel good rather
[1:29:58] than what makes him happy. And I'll tell
[1:30:01] you this, what makes God happy is
[1:30:02] usually not super comfortable for our
[1:30:04] flesh. It just doesn't work that way.
[1:30:06] Amen. You find the will of God. God's
[1:30:09] behind it. Power can flow through it.
[1:30:10] Otherwise, it might seem good, but it's
[1:30:12] man-made and there's no power in it
[1:30:14] except the power you bring. And then
[1:30:16] what happens is things start to crumble
[1:30:18] and you say, "Well, I guess it wasn't
[1:30:20] God's will." That's right. Or you try
[1:30:22] and push through it and it keeps
[1:30:23] crumbling because it was never him in
[1:30:24] the first place. He's trying to get you
[1:30:25] to what he wants you to do.
[1:30:28] Says this, "Faith is designed to do one
[1:30:31] thing, to see what God wills and wants.
[1:30:35] There's no knowledge that can do that.
[1:30:37] Faith alone is designed and given to the
[1:30:39] human race to find out what the will of
[1:30:42] God is. So how do we get faith? Paul
[1:30:45] says faith comes by hearing. And that
[1:30:48] word means understanding. Faith comes by
[1:30:50] understanding. And understanding comes
[1:30:52] by the word of God. So God came and he
[1:30:54] gave his word to the children of Israel.
[1:30:56] And church, he's not trying to hide his
[1:30:58] will. He's trying to reveal his will.
[1:31:01] But it takes a people that'll sit still
[1:31:03] and say, 'Lord, what is it? What is it?
[1:31:05] Reveal your will to me. Not, "Lord,
[1:31:08] here's what I think I should do. Give me
[1:31:10] a yay or a nay." No, sit back and say,
[1:31:12] "Lord, let me be silent." Like Job,
[1:31:14] Lord, I've said a whole lot of things.
[1:31:16] Let me be silent for a little while and
[1:31:18] you tell me what you want me to do. To
[1:31:21] sit in silence and let God speak to you,
[1:31:24] church. That is a great thing. That's
[1:31:26] what he's looking for. a people that
[1:31:28] will hear his voice, not give him
[1:31:32] options. How arrogant are we when we
[1:31:34] give God options?
[1:31:39] No. We're there to get a commission. Can
[1:31:42] you imagine going a a captain going to
[1:31:44] the general and saying, "Now, general,
[1:31:47] I've got three options here for you
[1:31:48] today. Uh, plan A, plan B, plan C. You
[1:31:51] tell me which one you want." You know
[1:31:53] what the general would do? He turned
[1:31:55] that guy around and kick him so hard in
[1:31:57] the rear end that he wouldn't land for
[1:31:58] 30 feet.
[1:32:01] Then he come in, he say, "Now, do you
[1:32:02] want my orders,
[1:32:05] right?
[1:32:07] We are to receive a commission, not to
[1:32:10] give God options." Amen.
[1:32:17] God gave his word to Israel. He said,
[1:32:19] "Go to Canaan. Take it. I'm with you.
[1:32:22] Listen, I've got a plan. I'm going to
[1:32:24] send hornets before you. I'm going to
[1:32:25] send fear before you. Remember when the
[1:32:26] spies went into Jericho and Rahab says,
[1:32:28] "The whole city is scared because we've
[1:32:32] seen what you did before you ever came
[1:32:33] to the land against the people that was
[1:32:34] greater and stronger than you." Then you
[1:32:36] crossed Jordan on dry land.
[1:32:39] We're shaking in our boots. And they're
[1:32:41] in a city that had never been taken.
[1:32:44] Shaking in their boots. What was it? It
[1:32:46] was God doing exactly what he said he
[1:32:48] would do. But there had to come a people
[1:32:50] that would take him. Problem is, no one
[1:32:52] believed it except Caleb and Joshua and
[1:32:54] Moses and Aaron.
[1:32:56] Cave and Joshua says, "Let's go. Let's
[1:32:58] do it." Everyone says, "Well, hold on a
[1:33:00] second." Nope. Not me. I'll take the
[1:33:04] land once you get it. I'll happily move
[1:33:06] into that lakefront property, but I've
[1:33:08] seen the guys living on the lakefront
[1:33:10] property and they're way bigger, way
[1:33:11] meaner, way stronger. No thank you. You
[1:33:13] guys can go do it.
[1:33:18] God said, "You don't accept my word, you
[1:33:19] can't go in.
[1:33:21] Can't get in by somebody else's actions.
[1:33:24] You got to take part. Church, we all got
[1:33:26] to be on the battle lines this morning.
[1:33:28] Can't sit back and let mom and dad or
[1:33:30] the pastor or somebody else. We've all
[1:33:31] got to be on the front line. I think
[1:33:34] brother Jonathan Martin said this
[1:33:37] to some of the young people when they
[1:33:38] came up for prayer during those
[1:33:40] meetings. He said, "Listen, you're not
[1:33:42] the next generation. You are the
[1:33:43] generation.
[1:33:45] There's no sitting back and letting the
[1:33:47] older people take care of things. We're
[1:33:49] at the time where we need everyone on
[1:33:51] board. You got the spirit of God. Get on
[1:33:53] board. Get your shoulder. Get your rifle
[1:33:56] up. Get on the firing line. Get in the
[1:33:58] battle. He says there's only one way God
[1:34:01] will ever receive anybody, and it's by
[1:34:02] taking God at his word. Not just taking
[1:34:05] by his word. He says by revelation that
[1:34:08] God will keep his word.
[1:34:11] You got to receive it with the intention
[1:34:12] that he's going to do what he said he
[1:34:13] was going to do. That's what God's
[1:34:15] looking for. Amen. Israel refused to
[1:34:17] take God at his word. He rejected them,
[1:34:19] sentenced all the 20 plus year old
[1:34:21] adults to death except Caleb and Joshua.
[1:34:24] And he sends them on that 40-year death
[1:34:26] march.
[1:34:28] But Caleb took him at his word. Caleb
[1:34:31] took him at his word. Caleb said, "We
[1:34:33] are more than able. We can do this."
[1:34:36] Amen. Caleb to takes God's word as his
[1:34:38] absolute.
[1:34:41] That's what Caleb was looking at. So
[1:34:43] Caleb takes it as his absolute. Caleb
[1:34:45] writes his name
[1:34:48] under the title deed of Canaan.
[1:34:50] Caleb, son of Japuna.
[1:34:53] There you go. Write it right across the
[1:34:54] the map of Canaan. It's mine. That's
[1:34:57] what Caleb did. But I want you to see
[1:35:00] something that before they started out
[1:35:02] on this 40-year death march, and that's
[1:35:04] what it was, church. It was a death
[1:35:05] march. I want you to see what God did to
[1:35:07] Caleb for his faith in Numbers where we
[1:35:09] read it did didn't give the full story,
[1:35:12] but he's saying, you know, he's saying
[1:35:13] they're all going to die. I said,
[1:35:14] "Except save Caleb the son of Japuna. He
[1:35:17] shall see it. And to him will I give the
[1:35:19] land where
[1:35:22] that he hath trotten upon."
[1:35:25] And to whom? His children because he
[1:35:29] hath wholly followed the Lord. See,
[1:35:32] remember we've been taught footsteps is
[1:35:34] possession. We get it from the
[1:35:35] scripture. We get it from Joshua.
[1:35:37] Everywhere that your souls of your foot
[1:35:39] shall tread, it's yours. But he says,
[1:35:41] "Caleb went and when he went looking for
[1:35:44] evidence, he went to the place that
[1:35:46] exactly matched what I had told you." He
[1:35:48] walked the land. He went in and he
[1:35:50] brought it back and he showed you that
[1:35:52] it was exactly what I told you about. He
[1:35:54] says, "Caleb will receive as a personal
[1:35:57] inheritance the land that he testified
[1:35:59] about specifically by personal
[1:36:02] experience."
[1:36:05] That is the land of the Anakims,
[1:36:09] the biggest and the baddest of them all.
[1:36:13] And he says, "That is for Caleb.
[1:36:16] That's for Caleb." So Caleb wrote his
[1:36:18] name on the whole thing. Now God says,
[1:36:20] "There's this place called Hebbran and
[1:36:22] there's mountains there." He says,
[1:36:24] "That's Caleb's. We're going to give
[1:36:26] Caleb the best of the best of the best
[1:36:30] because he believed me. Cuz he testified
[1:36:32] of it.
[1:36:34] Caleb got a specific portion just for
[1:36:37] him
[1:36:38] for a place of a man of faith because he
[1:36:40] was going to need it. He was going to
[1:36:42] need it when he went in there. Caleb had
[1:36:45] put his name on the commission. Now God
[1:36:46] says, "Now Caleb, for your faith, for
[1:36:49] taking me at my word, I've given you a
[1:36:51] special inheritance for you and your
[1:36:53] children." Why? Because you took me at
[1:36:55] my word.
[1:36:59] Consider these conditions. Now, Caleb
[1:37:02] has faith, but he's got a 40-year death
[1:37:04] march ahead of him. He's got 40 years
[1:37:07] where he's going to see person after
[1:37:09] person die in their tracks.
[1:37:12] Graveside funeral after graveside
[1:37:14] funeral. And as they walk around in a
[1:37:17] circle of 40 years, he's going to walk
[1:37:18] by graves that maybe somebody died the
[1:37:20] first year. And for 39 more years, he's
[1:37:22] going to walk by and he's going to see
[1:37:23] that little memorial that they put up
[1:37:25] over them or something like that. year
[1:37:27] after year, church. That's what Caleb's
[1:37:30] got to deal with. Walking around with a
[1:37:32] bunch of unbelievers.
[1:37:35] It's where we're at, isn't it? Walking
[1:37:37] around with a bunch of unbelievers.
[1:37:38] Everything that can be shaken will be
[1:37:40] shaken. We've got to walk that daily
[1:37:43] grind and see people fall and fail and
[1:37:46] fall and fail. And so, as they they turn
[1:37:48] away from Kadesh Barnea and they go
[1:37:50] right out into the desert, what happens?
[1:37:53] People start to get sore feet.
[1:37:57] bruised ankles. They start to get sick.
[1:38:00] They start to get frail and people start
[1:38:03] to die.
[1:38:06] And that's Caleb's life for the next 40
[1:38:09] years.
[1:38:12] Now church, consider this. What has
[1:38:13] changed in the camp?
[1:38:16] Pillar of fire is still there. Pillar of
[1:38:18] cloud is still there. Prophet still
[1:38:21] there. Word is still there. Tabernacle
[1:38:24] still there.
[1:38:26] Believers are still there. The promise
[1:38:28] is still there. The commission is still
[1:38:30] there. But what's happened? Unbelief has
[1:38:33] taken over the camp.
[1:38:35] And everyone under the a over the age of
[1:38:38] 20 starts to what? Falter and fail.
[1:38:43] They've lost their original condition.
[1:38:46] [Music]
[1:38:48] Under that spirit of unbelief, everyone
[1:38:50] starts dying off. But church, remember,
[1:38:53] we're not talking about unbelief this
[1:38:55] morning. We're talking about absolute
[1:38:56] power. And here's the thing.
[1:39:00] Caleb is walking and he's walking and
[1:39:04] he's walking and everybody else is
[1:39:07] starting to fail. But remember, church,
[1:39:10] faith is not stagnant. Faith is not just
[1:39:13] sit there in a pot. Faith grows. Faith
[1:39:17] strengthens itself. Faith what? Grows
[1:39:20] closer to God. Faith focuses on the
[1:39:22] promise rather than the circumstances
[1:39:24] because it's preparing itself for the
[1:39:26] battle day by day. So faith is not
[1:39:29] stagnant. It's it's it's it's faith
[1:39:31] building. It's building up. Look at what
[1:39:33] Paul said about Abraham as we're
[1:39:35] starting to close this morning. Speaking
[1:39:37] of Abraham now, Abraham's getting older
[1:39:39] and older. It's been 20 odd years since
[1:39:41] God gave the promise. He says, "Who
[1:39:42] against hope believed in hope." So in
[1:39:46] the face of all evidence to the contrary
[1:39:48] he still believed that he might become
[1:39:50] the father of many nations according to
[1:39:52] that which was spoken so shall thy see
[1:39:54] be. He says and be not weak in faith.
[1:40:00] In other words after 24 years his faith
[1:40:03] had not diminished.
[1:40:06] It says he considered not his own body
[1:40:08] now dead. In other words he didn't focus
[1:40:10] on what the condition said. He focused
[1:40:13] on what the word said. It says, "I did
[1:40:16] not consider it. It did not enter his
[1:40:18] thinking." He says, "When he was about
[1:40:20] 100 years old, neither did he consider
[1:40:22] the deadness of Sarah's womb."
[1:40:26] He says he staggered not. We could say
[1:40:28] it this way. He was not feeble.
[1:40:32] He was not feeble at the promise of God
[1:40:35] through unbelief. What causes us to
[1:40:38] become weak? Unbelief. He says, "But he
[1:40:41] was strong in faith, giving glory to
[1:40:44] God." See, I preached last service how
[1:40:46] sometimes God's just waiting for us to
[1:40:48] give him some praise. Give us some
[1:40:50] glory. Give him some thanks even when
[1:40:52] there's nothing that seems to be
[1:40:53] thankful for. But if we see by eyes of
[1:40:56] faith, we can see the answers on the
[1:40:58] way. And we can thank God. We can praise
[1:41:01] God even in the storm. That's what
[1:41:04] that's what Abraham was there. He says
[1:41:05] he was strong in faith giving glory to
[1:41:08] God. Every day it's going to be a
[1:41:10] greater miracle than yesterday.
[1:41:12] When it's going downhill, that just
[1:41:14] means he's going to lift me that much
[1:41:15] higher. Praise the Lord. He says, "Why?"
[1:41:19] Being fully persuaded.
[1:41:22] Fully persuaded. Fully committed,
[1:41:27] reading the commission day by day.
[1:41:31] I We have all seen it. I am a skilled
[1:41:34] metal worker, right? Some of you know
[1:41:36] what I'm talking about. Your children
[1:41:38] would have seen it. Listen, you may not
[1:41:40] be it, but keep reading it.
[1:41:43] I am a faithfilled,
[1:41:45] Holy Ghostsealed son and daughter of
[1:41:48] God.
[1:41:50] I am a faithfilled, Holy Ghost-filled
[1:41:52] son and daughter of God. I am a faith
[1:41:54] fil. Sometimes you need to keep reading
[1:41:56] your commission, church.
[1:41:59] Start reading your commission and it'll
[1:42:00] give you faith for the day, for the
[1:42:02] season that you're in.
[1:42:06] fully persuaded.
[1:42:08] What did Abraham and Sarah experience,
[1:42:10] church? Before they received absolute
[1:42:13] power, they had to go to a place of
[1:42:16] absolute inability to make it happen.
[1:42:22] It's where we're at. It's where we're
[1:42:24] at. I can't make it happen. You can't
[1:42:27] make it happen. And the sooner we
[1:42:29] realize it, the closer we come to
[1:42:31] getting out of here.
[1:42:33] The sooner we realize that God's got to
[1:42:35] make the way. It's got to be the power
[1:42:37] of God. And so, as soon as they got to a
[1:42:39] place of absolute inability, what did
[1:42:42] they do, church? They experienced
[1:42:44] absolute resurrection power. And he
[1:42:47] turned her into a young woman overnight.
[1:42:53] Abraham woke up with a start the next
[1:42:55] morning.
[1:42:57] I think Sarah woke up with a start, too.
[1:43:00] Can you imagine, church? turn back to a
[1:43:03] 25-year-old in an instant,
[1:43:06] 89 years old
[1:43:08] and almost 99 years old. And you turn
[1:43:12] over the next morning, you both go,
[1:43:13] "What?
[1:43:15] Yeah." And then, "Hey, I know you.
[1:43:21] Is this a dream?"
[1:43:23] It's a good dream.
[1:43:26] In a moment, in a twinkling of an eye,
[1:43:29] they woke up. Absolute power had changed
[1:43:32] both their bodies. Amen.
[1:43:36] Oh my. Look at Caleb.
[1:43:39] We're starting to close at two pages.
[1:43:42] 40 years he walks around in the desert.
[1:43:44] Church. 40 years. Church. He's on a
[1:43:47] death march. Person after person.
[1:43:50] Sadness every day. Perhaps they might
[1:43:52] have lost a million people on that death
[1:43:53] march. You think about that over 40
[1:43:56] years. That's a lot of people dying.
[1:43:58] What? 25,000 people a year. Think about
[1:44:01] that. If they lost half, about a
[1:44:04] million, 25,000 people a year,
[1:44:09] hundreds a day dying.
[1:44:14] What would that do to you?
[1:44:17] The church, we have to realize
[1:44:18] something. He's a believer.
[1:44:22] Believers handle things different.
[1:44:24] Believers walk different.
[1:44:26] believers react different.
[1:44:29] Things don't affect us the way they
[1:44:31] affect other people because we're
[1:44:33] children of faith. That's the seed of
[1:44:36] Abraham. It's the seed of faith.
[1:44:39] And so he's walking around. Amen.
[1:44:42] But here's the thing. Caleb's walking
[1:44:44] around
[1:44:46] and maybe his brother falls by the
[1:44:48] wayside. His dad falls by the wayside.
[1:44:51] His sister falls by the wayside. His
[1:44:53] pastor falls by the wayside. But church,
[1:44:56] Caleb's noticing something.
[1:44:58] He's not changing.
[1:45:01] He's not changing. He's not getting
[1:45:03] slower. He's not getting weaker. He's
[1:45:06] not getting tired. Why, church? Cuz he's
[1:45:09] of a different spirit. He's got a spirit
[1:45:12] of faith. And so, what happens for 40
[1:45:14] years is Caleb is wrapped in a robe of
[1:45:16] eternal life. He doesn't change.
[1:45:19] Everyone else is failing. And Caleb goes
[1:45:22] from 40 years old to 80 years old. and
[1:45:25] nothing's changing. He's walking on a
[1:45:27] death march and death can't touch him.
[1:45:29] Death can't even work in his body.
[1:45:33] What is it? It's absolute power flowing
[1:45:36] through him because he took God at his
[1:45:38] word. God said, "You have not lost your
[1:45:40] opportunity, Caleb. I can preserve you
[1:45:43] for your opportunity. You take me at my
[1:45:46] word, I'll take you through."
[1:45:49] Don't worry about it, Caleb.
[1:45:51] You know, scripture never says Joshua
[1:45:53] went through this. It does say Joshua
[1:45:56] grew old and feeble after he stopped
[1:45:57] fighting. I believe Joshua got the same
[1:45:59] thing. But Caleb is the one that says he
[1:46:01] never broke down.
[1:46:04] Caleb had a body change for 40 years. 40
[1:46:08] years he woke up and nothing had
[1:46:10] changed.
[1:46:12] He never changed once in terms of his
[1:46:14] fitness, his strength, nothing. God
[1:46:17] preserved him perfectly for 40 years.
[1:46:19] more than that because what happens is
[1:46:20] Caleb crosses the Jordan with the rest
[1:46:22] of them on dry land and he fights for
[1:46:24] five years alongside Joshua
[1:46:27] every day the opportunity to get killed
[1:46:29] nothing can kill him
[1:46:32] and after 45 years church he's 85 years
[1:46:35] old now and he's fought for his brothers
[1:46:37] and he's fought for his sisters and he's
[1:46:38] helped other people get their land then
[1:46:40] he comes to Joshua with this request
[1:46:43] he says and now behold the Lord hath
[1:46:46] kept me alive as he said these 35 years
[1:46:50] even since the Lord spake this word unto
[1:46:52] Moses while the children of Israel
[1:46:53] wandered in the wilderness and now lo I
[1:46:56] am this day four score and 5 years old
[1:46:58] I'm 85 years old he says as yet I am as
[1:47:02] strong as I was in the day that Moses
[1:47:05] sent me as my strength was then even so
[1:47:09] my strength now for war both to go out
[1:47:12] and to come in he was preserved for war
[1:47:14] church he was not preserved to go and
[1:47:17] sit in It's a comfy chair or a couch,
[1:47:19] but he was preserved to go in and take
[1:47:21] his commission and put it into action.
[1:47:23] He was preserved to take the land.
[1:47:29] Nothing's changed. He says, "The young
[1:47:32] guy's got nothing on me. I can fight
[1:47:35] with the best of them. The Lord has kept
[1:47:37] me alive. The Lord has preserved me for
[1:47:40] one thing. To give me the land that I
[1:47:42] told him, the land that I test about."
[1:47:45] He says, "That's the one that I came
[1:47:47] for." for now. God has kept me alive for
[1:47:49] my personal portion of his word.
[1:47:54] I'm as strong this day as I was in the
[1:47:56] day that Moses sent me as my strength
[1:47:58] was then. Even so is my strength now for
[1:48:00] war both to go out and to come in.
[1:48:04] War didn't change him.
[1:48:07] He was held in the hand of God. Church
[1:48:12] Caleb says, "I haven't lost a thing
[1:48:13] since I took God at his word.
[1:48:17] haven't diminished, haven't weakened.
[1:48:20] And after five years of fighting, I
[1:48:22] still haven't weakened.
[1:48:26] Church, he knows how to put a burden on
[1:48:27] us that we can carry.
[1:48:31] Caleb says, "I've been through the death
[1:48:33] march and it didn't do anything for me.
[1:48:36] Had no power over me. I've crossed over
[1:48:39] Jordan,
[1:48:41] took down Jericho, took down AI." We've
[1:48:43] had five years of campaigns and nobody's
[1:48:45] been able to touch me. God has preserved
[1:48:48] me because I took him at his word. All
[1:48:52] those years, church, and Caleb's
[1:48:53] testimony is the same. God is faithful
[1:48:55] to his word. That's all he's standing
[1:48:58] on. God is faithful to his word. He
[1:49:00] says, "And I haven't dwindled at all."
[1:49:03] Watch this. Now, this is an 85year-old.
[1:49:06] Brother Gerald, you're 77 now, I think.
[1:49:07] Right? So, he's eight years older than
[1:49:10] Brother Gerald. And he says,"Now
[1:49:12] therefore give me this mountain."
[1:49:15] He says, "Whereof the Lord spake in that
[1:49:17] day, for thou heard in the day that the
[1:49:19] Anakims were there." These are the ones
[1:49:21] that they were the most scared about.
[1:49:25] He says, "And that the cities were great
[1:49:27] and fenced. If so be that the Lord will
[1:49:29] be with me, then I shall be able to
[1:49:31] drive them out," as the Lord said. And
[1:49:33] Joshua blessed him and gave unto Caleb
[1:49:35] the son of Japuna, Hebron for an
[1:49:36] inheritance. Hebron therefore became the
[1:49:39] inheritance of Caleb the son of Jaffuna
[1:49:41] the Kennesite unto this day. Caleb never
[1:49:45] lost it. It belongs to his relatives
[1:49:47] even today. He says because that he
[1:49:50] wholly followed the Lord God of Israel.
[1:49:54] Caleb had fought for his brothers and
[1:49:55] sisters for 5 years.
[1:49:58] But there came a day where he says, "Now
[1:49:59] I'm ready for mine.
[1:50:02] I've helped so and so. Sister so and so.
[1:50:04] We prayed for her and she got healed.
[1:50:06] Brother so and so got healed. I'm here
[1:50:08] for my healing.
[1:50:09] So and so their kids got saved. I'm here
[1:50:11] for my kids to get saved. So and so got
[1:50:13] delivered. I'm here to get delivered. So
[1:50:15] and so got their besetting sin taken
[1:50:17] care of. I'm here to get my besetting
[1:50:18] sin taken care of.
[1:50:21] So and so got the Holy Ghost. I'm here
[1:50:23] for the Holy Ghost.
[1:50:25] He said, "It's time to get mine. I'm 85.
[1:50:30] I've got a commission. I've got an
[1:50:32] inheritance with my name written on it
[1:50:33] and I'm here to take it." He says, "And
[1:50:35] if the Lord's with me, I'll take it."
[1:50:36] And he did. He did. He went and he took
[1:50:39] it. And it's not just for him. It's for
[1:50:41] his family and his children and everyone
[1:50:43] that came after him. He went and he
[1:50:45] destroyed the greatest giants in the
[1:50:47] land based on one thing. We're more than
[1:50:50] able to do it. Cuz the word told me, cuz
[1:50:54] God told me, and he gave me a commission
[1:50:55] to do it. Caleb's body had been
[1:50:58] preserved by absolute power for 45 years
[1:51:03] for one thing. So his faith could become
[1:51:05] sight.
[1:51:06] his faith could become sight. God said,
[1:51:08] "You gave a testimony of my word. I'll
[1:51:10] give you the reality of that testimony."
[1:51:13] That's what the spirit of God is here to
[1:51:14] do, church. It's not here to just make a
[1:51:16] bunch of ruckus and it's not just here
[1:51:17] to do a bunch of signs and wonders. It's
[1:51:19] here so that your faith can become
[1:51:20] sight. That's what it's doing is it's
[1:51:22] taking us from this into that. And we'll
[1:51:24] get into this in the next service. The
[1:51:26] faith for today is preparing us for the
[1:51:28] transition into a land of perfect faith.
[1:51:30] The partial faith we have is preparing
[1:51:32] us for perfect faith. The power we have
[1:51:34] now is getting us ready for absolute
[1:51:35] power.
[1:51:37] Little by little, word upon word, line
[1:51:40] upon line. Here a little, there a
[1:51:42] little. Don't despise the day of little
[1:51:44] things. They add up into really big
[1:51:46] things. Church, we've got to come to a
[1:51:48] place where we say, "I'm here for what
[1:51:49] God said about me.
[1:51:51] I'm not just here for a generic message.
[1:51:53] I'm not here for a generic service. I
[1:51:55] want it personal."
[1:51:57] Why? Because he called me. He called my
[1:52:00] name. He wrote my name in Islam's book
[1:52:02] of life. He identified me in his word.
[1:52:05] And now I'm here for it. And I'm not
[1:52:07] taking no for an answer. Not because
[1:52:10] it's my thought or my idea, but it's
[1:52:13] because he promised it. That's the only
[1:52:15] reason we're here this morning, church,
[1:52:16] is because he called us and he promised
[1:52:18] it. And he preserves us day in and day
[1:52:20] out. We go through hard times. We go
[1:52:22] through sickness. We go through
[1:52:24] diseases. We go through church breakups
[1:52:26] and ministry failures and family issues
[1:52:28] and all these things. But why is God
[1:52:29] protecting and preserving us? So that
[1:52:31] our faith can become sight.
[1:52:34] That's what it's all about. Is so that
[1:52:36] as we've trusted him in his word, we'll
[1:52:38] see what we read in Numbers 23 that God
[1:52:39] is not a man that he should lie nor the
[1:52:41] son of man that he should repent. But
[1:52:44] has he said it and will he not do it?
[1:52:46] All he's wanting is a family,
[1:52:49] the family of God, the bride of Christ
[1:52:51] to come and say, "I'm here for my
[1:52:52] portion. I'm here for my commission."
[1:52:56] not to just come and receive, but to
[1:52:59] receive so we can go and do so that he
[1:53:02] can flow through us and do what he wants
[1:53:03] us to do. Two quotes as we close. He
[1:53:06] says, "You really get down and mean it
[1:53:08] before God. God will take you over
[1:53:10] across there." No matter what the
[1:53:12] seminary preachers say, we can have the
[1:53:14] Holy Ghost because God promised it to
[1:53:15] us. That's where Caleb based his faith.
[1:53:18] That's where Joshua based it because God
[1:53:20] said, "It's yours. I've already given it
[1:53:22] to you." He says, "Hallelujah. I like
[1:53:24] that. Not I will I have.
[1:53:28] He says those who he has called. See he
[1:53:30] brings it down to where we are. Those
[1:53:32] who he has called he justified. Is that
[1:53:34] right? And those who he's justified he
[1:53:36] glorified. Is that right? He says then
[1:53:38] brother in heaven we're already
[1:53:40] glorified together with Christ Jesus.
[1:53:42] Hallelujah. That's right. He says just
[1:53:44] let the devil squall and scream and have
[1:53:46] all of his tantrums he wants to. It's
[1:53:48] thus sayeth the Lord. That's right.
[1:53:51] Amen. Are you willing to stand on thus
[1:53:54] sayeth the Lord? And let's stand to our
[1:53:56] feet. Amen. God bless you this morning.
[1:54:00] My I love preaching about the promises
[1:54:02] of God.
[1:54:04] Certainly don't always enjoy walking in
[1:54:06] the promises of God because it's a
[1:54:08] battle, isn't it? But what's the point
[1:54:10] of all this today is to realize that
[1:54:13] your power comes through your
[1:54:14] commission. Power comes through your
[1:54:17] name in the word. Power comes through
[1:54:19] seeing it as yours and not just everyone
[1:54:22] else's.
[1:54:24] Power comes through taking God at his
[1:54:26] word and then every decision and
[1:54:28] footstep you make lines up with what
[1:54:30] you've confessed. That's all he's asking
[1:54:32] us to do. I say all of it is a small
[1:54:34] thing. It's a big thing. When you take
[1:54:36] everything you are and you commit it
[1:54:38] behind that word of God, that's when God
[1:54:40] can move. That's why I said when you get
[1:54:42] that's why I read there where he says
[1:54:43] where you can really get down and mean
[1:54:45] it and you find God and you commit
[1:54:48] yourself to him. That's when God does
[1:54:50] it. Not half in half out. Not just
[1:54:54] roaming around and then a little knee
[1:54:55] comes up and we go to God. But when you
[1:54:57] commit your very soul and being into him
[1:55:00] and you say, "Lord, I'm here to do your
[1:55:02] will. Lord, I'm here to receive your
[1:55:04] word. I'm here to have my faith be made
[1:55:06] sight." That's when God starts to move.
[1:55:08] Amen. God bless you. Let's bow our heads
[1:55:10] together.
[1:55:12] Lord Jesus,
[1:55:14] Lord, we need our faith lifted this
[1:55:16] morning.
[1:55:18] Lord, we're looking for perfect faith.
[1:55:21] We're looking for rapturing faith. Lord,
[1:55:24] where all that we can see is you and
[1:55:25] your word.
[1:55:27] But Lord, we know we face a very capable
[1:55:29] enemy that's throwing so many things at
[1:55:31] us. Lord, trying to distract us, trying
[1:55:33] to throw so many things in our vision to
[1:55:35] make us disbelieve. But Lord, we've
[1:55:38] received a commission, Lord. And our
[1:55:40] commission, Lord, is to go on a rapture.
[1:55:43] Our commission, Lord, is to conquer
[1:55:46] every enemy that stands before us. Lord,
[1:55:49] our commission is to take you at your
[1:55:50] word so that your power can flow through
[1:55:53] us. Lord, I pray you help us to take you
[1:55:55] at your word, not to come up with some
[1:55:57] scheme or plan, Lord, that makes us feel
[1:55:59] good or look good, but Lord, a a plan
[1:56:02] that is set before the ages before time
[1:56:05] began, Lord, a redemption plan where we
[1:56:07] could see that it's for us, Lord. And
[1:56:09] it's not that you will do it, it's that
[1:56:11] you have done it, and we're just walking
[1:56:13] through the script in this time, Lord. I
[1:56:16] pray you lift our faith. Strengthen us
[1:56:18] for battle, Lord. Strengthen our resolve
[1:56:20] day by day, Lord, and help us to feed
[1:56:22] our faith, Lord. Lord, help us to feed
[1:56:24] our walk with you, Lord. Help us to
[1:56:27] dwell under the hearing and the
[1:56:28] listening and the the preaching of your
[1:56:30] word,
[1:56:31] Lord. Help us to get our eyes on things
[1:56:33] that are above, Lord, into the eternal.
[1:56:37] Lord, there's many needs here this
[1:56:38] morning. Lord, many prayer requests have
[1:56:41] come through my phone and email this
[1:56:42] week, Lord. We're asking your grace for
[1:56:45] them, each one, Lord, that you minister
[1:56:47] to hearts and souls, to bodies, Lord,
[1:56:49] that you would strengthen the feeble.
[1:56:52] Lord, I believe as it was in those days,
[1:56:54] so will it be today. Lord, there'll not
[1:56:55] be a feeble one among us, Lord, but
[1:56:57] it'll be a faithfilled people, Lord,
[1:56:59] that'll take you at your word. Lord,
[1:57:02] bless us now. We pray in Jesus Christ's
[1:57:04] name we ask it. Amen.
[1:57:11] Keep on the firing line. 842. It's an
[1:57:14] old one.
[1:57:20] If you're in the battle for the Lord and
[1:57:23] right,
[1:57:25] keep on the firing line.
[1:57:30] Oh, if you win, my brother, surely you
[1:57:33] must fight. So keep on the firing line.
[1:57:40] And there are many dangers that we all
[1:57:44] must face.
[1:57:46] If we die of fighting, there is no
[1:57:49] disgrace.
[1:57:51] A coward in the service, he will find no
[1:57:55] place. So keep on the firing line.
[1:58:01] Oh, you must fight. Be brave against all
[1:58:06] evil.
[1:58:08] Never run or even lag behind.
[1:58:13] If you will bring for God and the right,
[1:58:18] just keep on the fiery line.
[1:58:23] And God will only use a soldier he can
[1:58:27] trust. So keep up the firing light.
[1:58:34] And if you wear a crown and bear the
[1:58:37] cross, you must so keep on the fire in
[1:58:42] life.
[1:58:45] Life is but to labor for the master,
[1:58:49] dear. Help to banish evil and to spread
[1:58:53] good cheer. Oh great, you'll be rewarded
[1:58:58] for your service here. Oh, keep on the
[1:59:03] firing line.
[1:59:06] Oh, you must fight. Be brave against all
[1:59:10] evil. Never run or even lag behind.
[1:59:17] If you will be for God and the right,
[1:59:22] just keep on the fiery light.
[1:59:28] When we get to heaven, brother, we'll be
[1:59:31] glad.
[1:59:33] Keep on the fing light.
[1:59:38] I will praise the Savior for the call we
[1:59:42] had.
[1:59:44] Keep on the firing light.
[1:59:49] And we see the souls that we have helped
[1:59:52] to win
[1:59:54] leading them to Jesus from the paths of
[1:59:58] sin.
[2:00:00] With a shout of welcome, we will all
[2:00:03] march in. So keep on the fighting line.
[2:00:09] Oh, you must fight. Be brave against all
[2:00:14] evil.
[2:00:16] ever run nor even behind.
[2:00:21] If you will win for God and the right,
[2:00:26] just keep on the fiery line.
[2:00:31] Oh, you must fight. Be brave against all
[2:00:36] evil

[2:02:55] feel him in my feet. I feel him in my
[2:02:59] heart. I feel him all over me.

[2:04:06] Do you know the full thing for uh I'm
[2:04:08] not giving up. 976.
[2:04:13] 976.
[2:04:16] Let's uh start with the chorus. Kind of
[2:04:17] ease into it probably.
[2:04:20] Well, I'm not giving up.
[2:04:25] And I'm not turning around.
[2:04:29] By the grace of God, I'm going to wear a
[2:04:33] shining crown. And someday
[2:04:37] and I'll keep holding on
[2:04:41] to this nail guard hand.
[2:04:45] And I'm not giving up. No, I'll keep
[2:04:49] going on.
[2:04:54] Well, I've been walking through the
[2:04:56] valley,
[2:04:59] through this veil of tears.
[2:05:02] At times I even questioned even if my
[2:05:08] Lord was near. And many times that old
[2:05:13] tempter, he says, "Why not turn around?
[2:05:19] You can't get any farther because you're
[2:05:24] just losing ground. And I'm not giving
[2:05:28] up.
[2:05:30] And I'm not turning around.
[2:05:34] And by the grace of God, I'm going to
[2:05:38] wear a shining crown. And someday
[2:05:43] I'll keep holding on
[2:05:47] to that nail scarred hand.
[2:05:51] I'm not giving up. No, I'll keep going
[2:05:56] on.
[2:05:59] And would you mind
[2:06:02] to tell me there's been something
[2:06:05] bothering me?
[2:06:08] Why is it that old devil, he just won't
[2:06:12] let God's children be?
[2:06:16] You see, he has purposed and determined
[2:06:21] to get right in the way
[2:06:25] and turn us from the way of life and
[2:06:29] lead our souls astray. But I'm not
[2:06:34] giving up
[2:06:36] and I'm not turning around.
[2:06:41] And by the grace of God, I'm going to
[2:06:44] wear a shining crown
[2:06:47] someday.
[2:06:49] And I'll keep holding on
[2:06:53] to that nail scarred hand.
[2:06:57] And I'm not giving up. No, I'll keep
[2:07:01] going on. Sing it one more time. Oh, and
[2:07:06] I'm not giving up.
[2:07:09] And I'm not turning around.
[2:07:14] By the grace of God, I'm going to wear a
[2:07:18] shining crown. And someday
[2:07:22] I'll keep holding on
[2:07:26] to that nail scarred head.
[2:07:30] And I'm not giving up.
[2:07:33] I'll keep holding on.
[2:07:38] Amen. Just before we close, I'm going to
[2:07:40] ask brother Vichel to come and close in
[2:07:41] prayer if he would. We're going to sing
[2:07:43] that song, My Hope is in the Lord, 1088.
[2:07:46] Amen. Remember the needs that were
[2:07:48] mentioned.
[2:07:50] Amen. Appreciate everyone that had uh my
[2:07:52] brother Nathan out. He had a wonderful
[2:07:54] time. They really enjoyed it from start
[2:07:55] to finish. I appreciate the hospitality
[2:07:58] you showed and even dragged us along to
[2:08:00] a couple of them. So, we're thankful for
[2:08:01] that. But God bless you each one and uh
[2:08:04] he wanted me to thank everyone for that.
[2:08:05] So, God bless you. Amen. Remember the
[2:08:07] service on Wednesday, the needs that
[2:08:09] have been presented. Amen. And just
[2:08:11] trust God to be moving. Amen.
[2:08:15] And I stand in awe within the presence
[2:08:20] of the Lord.
[2:08:24] In whom the wisdom of the ages
[2:08:29] lies.
[2:08:32] For whom the raging of the sea
[2:08:37] subsides.
[2:08:40] A living sacrifice.
[2:08:44] The only source
[2:08:48] of life.
[2:08:49] My hope
[2:08:52] is in the Lord.
[2:08:56] From this time on
[2:09:00] and ever more.
[2:09:04] Oh my hope
[2:09:09] is in the Lord
[2:09:13] forever more.
[2:09:16] And his tender mercies come with every
[2:09:21] rising sun
[2:09:25] to meet the sinner in his brokenness.
[2:09:30] [Music]
[2:09:33] to offer healing and forgiveness.
[2:09:41] And those who trust in him will find
[2:09:46] their hearts
[2:09:48] at rest.
[2:09:50] My hope
[2:09:53] is in the Lord
[2:09:57] from this time on
[2:10:00] and ever more.
[2:10:04] Oh my hope
[2:10:08] is in the Lord
[2:10:12] forever more.
[2:10:16] And my hope
[2:10:20] is in the Lord
[2:10:25] this time on
[2:10:28] and ever more.
[2:10:32] Oh my hope
[2:10:36] is in the Lord
[2:10:40] forever more.
