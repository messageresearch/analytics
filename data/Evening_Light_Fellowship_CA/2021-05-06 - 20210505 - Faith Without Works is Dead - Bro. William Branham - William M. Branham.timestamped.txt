[41:50] [Music]
[41:55] i go through
[42:04] [Music]
[42:12] amen praise the lord god bless you amen
[42:17] the child is excited amen
[42:21] praise the lord we if we can be as noisy
[42:23] as the child the lord be pleased
[42:25] amen amen so let's not blame the child
[42:29] it's an example for
[42:30] us amen so praise the lord god bless us
[42:34] and we thank the lord again for the
[42:37] privilege of getting you back to
[42:39] fellowship amen by the grace of god and
[42:42] understand it just recently within the
[42:44] last
[42:45] three or four days that there's been a
[42:47] number of churches in certain areas
[42:49] i'm not sure whether it's the united
[42:50] states or canada i think some is canada
[42:53] and where they have been taking a
[42:56] tremendous stand against government
[42:58] regulations which were forbidding
[43:01] groups to meet at so many uh to meet
[43:04] together
[43:05] i i'm not sure i don't think that their
[43:07] emphasis of putting your emphasis on a
[43:08] church
[43:09] but just general gatherings you know for
[43:12] here for there for somewhere else
[43:14] and of course that includes church
[43:16] gatherings
[43:17] and so there's been a tremendous
[43:19] challenge i think
[43:20] by certain preachers to the to the to
[43:24] the
[43:24] authority to legal authorities like
[43:26] policemen and so on so i if you saw it
[43:28] online
[43:29] in the internet where you saw you saw
[43:31] the the religious people
[43:34] challenging the police amen amen and of
[43:37] course some
[43:38] were arrested and there was a pastor
[43:40] also that ended up
[43:41] in prison and he's in jail because of
[43:44] his
[43:45] his movements and what he's done and
[43:47] what he said
[43:48] and so on but again there is i believe
[43:52] that there is a limit to it
[43:54] but the bible does say you know you
[43:55] render the caesar the things that are
[43:57] caesar's
[43:57] and to god the things that are gods and
[43:59] so on and
[44:01] but again they had to consider fully
[44:05] consider
[44:05] you know why the government would would
[44:08] say that you're not allowed to gather
[44:10] and
[44:10] and again it's not just churches but
[44:12] it's the number of people
[44:14] in the church and so that's that's what
[44:17] they were facing
[44:18] and that's what they were challenging
[44:20] the police on and i understand that some
[44:22] of it is still going on right now
[44:24] and of course there was uh
[44:31] okay that's a message from brother
[44:35] matthew
[44:36] i guess it's amazing the world we live
[44:38] in
[44:39] america amen but if we can get that
[44:42] but i'll tell you where we can get a
[44:44] message from god even better
[44:46] amen oh yeah and as he's conveying that
[44:50] god's conveying his message to us amen
[44:52] you look at it and read it there
[44:54] we can look at it and read it here amen
[44:56] or we can look at each other and read it
[44:58] amen read the word in your life amen
[45:01] amen
[45:02] so i pray the grace of god amen that
[45:05] brother sister that we are
[45:06] we are reflecting the correct revelation
[45:09] of the word
[45:10] the correct revelation of god and what
[45:12] god has done what god is doing
[45:14] right on through amen so we're not going
[45:16] to lead him astray we're going to lead
[45:18] them in the straight and narrow way
[45:19] amen by the grace of god and we pray the
[45:22] grace of god that uh
[45:25] what those individuals and religions and
[45:28] and as far as i know that most of them
[45:30] are not not denominational they're
[45:31] non-denominational
[45:33] i trust by the grace of god that they're
[45:35] going to give the right revelation
[45:37] in their lives amen they're going to act
[45:40] and react the right way
[45:41] as jesus would act or react amen oh we
[45:45] got to do this we got to do that
[45:46] oh yeah and oh yeah but and we feel that
[45:49] it's
[45:50] it's the law challenging us and stopping
[45:52] us well
[45:53] that's just to a certain point you know
[45:55] when the prophet didn't warn us that the
[45:57] hour's coming when we wouldn't be
[45:58] allowed to get together
[46:00] but i don't but that won't be because of
[46:01] colby 19 that won't be because of this
[46:04] issue or that issue no no it'll be
[46:07] because of our faith
[46:08] and i believe the the the power and the
[46:11] anointing behind it will be a religious
[46:14] power oh yeah not political it'll be
[46:16] religious
[46:18] so and and we know where it's coming
[46:20] from but that hour will come
[46:22] someday but basically we they'll try
[46:25] what they'll try to do
[46:26] is they'll try to get us to to move in
[46:29] fellowship
[46:29] with with the churches out there you
[46:31] know not not down non-denominational
[46:34] groups
[46:34] but they want you to want you to
[46:36] identify with a denominational group
[46:39] you know because there's so many
[46:40] thousands nonprofit organizations that
[46:43] are
[46:43] registered with the government and no
[46:46] doubt the government is trying to reduce
[46:47] those things
[46:48] for a reason they got a reason and so
[46:51] the hours coming when they're going to
[46:52] try to force us
[46:53] to unite with regular denominations not
[46:56] not not just ourselves and they'll feel
[46:58] that
[46:58] that our spirit is wrong our spirit is
[47:00] not right because we want to associate
[47:02] with this church or that church
[47:04] but again let's understand that by the
[47:06] grace of god
[47:08] that we are we're not denying what's
[47:11] going on out there in the church world
[47:13] as i said don't look down at them
[47:15] because
[47:16] some of the many of them are going to be
[47:18] outside the city
[47:20] but the bride is in the in the city with
[47:22] the bridegroom
[47:23] amen that's where that's where she's
[47:25] going to reign with him
[47:27] sit with him in his throne and so on so
[47:29] but again
[47:30] the rest of them would be outside the
[47:32] city so
[47:34] thank god for that revelation amen and
[47:36] his god
[47:37] giving us the understanding to keep our
[47:39] attitude and our spirit right toward
[47:40] those out there
[47:42] amen and i'll tell you i've met some of
[47:44] them that have
[47:45] that have been very tremendous in their
[47:47] faith oh yes very good
[47:49] real good and that they would even put
[47:53] some professing believers to shame when
[47:55] it comes to faith
[47:56] so god help us brother to understand
[47:58] what god has done
[48:00] and what god is doing amen and so
[48:03] he's calling out the bride and as i said
[48:05] my first sermon
[48:07] that i preached when i was just in my
[48:08] late teens
[48:10] and i i preached against it i said stop
[48:13] it
[48:14] i said you can't do that and i and i
[48:16] like i said i chose the scripture in
[48:18] matthew chapter 5 there the last few
[48:21] verses
[48:22] and to highlight where you love them
[48:24] that love you what reward have you
[48:26] and so on you've got to have a right
[48:27] attitude right spirit toward everybody
[48:29] amen by the grace of god and
[48:32] and to keep to keep that spirit right
[48:34] and so as i said and
[48:36] when i finished that sermon the lord did
[48:39] confirm it
[48:40] when our when our brother bill our
[48:42] brother burns spoke in tongues which is
[48:44] unusual for him
[48:45] that's very rare and uh in in his life
[48:49] and uh and then brother bill again
[48:52] interpreted it
[48:53] and confirmed that what i said was the
[48:54] truth confirmed that what i said wasn't
[48:56] me
[48:57] was god amen and because i was noticing
[49:00] a lot of people
[49:02] looking down their noses at those
[49:03] denominational people don't do that
[49:05] amen no siree don't don't do it
[49:09] and just keep your attitude right your
[49:10] spirit right thank god for what you got
[49:13] amen but again you gotta see
[49:16] i've repeated it a number of times where
[49:18] the angel
[49:20] rebuked brother branham oh yeah
[49:24] he did what for because he would see
[49:27] these women out there
[49:28] with slacks on and with this and dressed
[49:30] this way in that way and so on
[49:32] and and he was condemning them and
[49:35] you can condemn what they do but not
[49:37] don't condemn them
[49:38] and the angel told them don't do that
[49:40] don't call them rickies and requests he
[49:42] said some of them are my children
[49:44] oh they are yes some of them are my
[49:48] children again
[49:49] it's those outside the city by the grace
[49:51] of god
[49:52] amen but when it comes to the the what
[49:55] god has done especially in this hour
[49:57] it's the it's the climax of his ministry
[50:00] and his message
[50:01] and it's the calling out of the bride
[50:03] that's why he said
[50:04] that now he said the bright word not
[50:06] everyone is going to hear the message
[50:07] not everyone's going to believe the
[50:08] message but the bride because that's the
[50:10] ones that ordained to be a part of the
[50:12] break room
[50:13] amen but again the others they're there
[50:16] and and the prophet did highlight that
[50:18] he said the whole world is going to hear
[50:19] the
[50:20] hear the the witness of jesus the
[50:22] testimony of jesus
[50:24] amen right and amen and
[50:27] and they're those that are going to be
[50:28] outside the city
[50:30] again we can refer to them as foolish
[50:32] virgins
[50:34] because again uh certain of the brethren
[50:36] have
[50:38] emailed me from a different part of the
[50:41] world
[50:41] wanting to know you know concerning who
[50:44] the foolish virgins are
[50:45] and versus the wise virgins and the
[50:47] prophet has highlighted the wise virgin
[50:49] sir is the bride
[50:50] amen but the foolish virgin they're not
[50:53] bright
[50:54] but he said they're going to be they're
[50:55] going to be in in glory they're going to
[50:57] be in heaven
[50:58] amen he said they're going to be outside
[51:00] the city the bride's in the city
[51:02] so i trust by the grace of god we have
[51:03] that revelation of what god is doing
[51:06] amen and that and the reason that god
[51:08] has separated us
[51:10] unto himself amen separating a bride
[51:13] unto yourself by the grace of god so
[51:16] just just keep keep our attitude right
[51:18] keep our spirits right amen toward
[51:20] everybody
[51:22] and brother if our attitude or spiritual
[51:23] is is right toward them
[51:25] how much more is it right toward the
[51:27] bride of christ
[51:28] amen our brothers and sisters in the
[51:31] faith
[51:32] and also the proud of god was sitting in
[51:35] a restaurant
[51:36] and we remember that i hope and that
[51:39] in a table across from him there was
[51:41] this woman and this man
[51:43] and the woman was very worldly and so i
[51:46] want to come she had her hair cut and
[51:47] she had to watch the clothes shed on and
[51:50] again the prophet was was looking at her
[51:52] with with
[51:53] uh criticism
[51:56] and putting her down as it were and the
[51:59] angel said
[52:00] come here move aside and he an angel
[52:03] took him over to the corner there
[52:04] somewhere
[52:05] by the door and showed him you know he
[52:08] said
[52:08] see he said this is you he said you'd be
[52:12] lost but for the grace of god
[52:14] amen surely and he said don't you don't
[52:17] you
[52:17] have that spirit toward her amen and so
[52:20] the angel rebuked him rebuked and
[52:22] rebuked him
[52:23] and he humbled himself he repented and
[52:25] he came back and witnessed to the lady
[52:27] amen and she came and gave her heart to
[52:30] the lord
[52:31] that's right she did during during the
[52:34] service maybe that it was
[52:35] that he was having in that area amen see
[52:38] you don't know but god knows
[52:40] that's why he's telling us keep your
[52:42] spirit right keep your attitude right
[52:44] because there goes you but for the grace
[52:45] of god amen
[52:47] so god's grace to us brother keep your
[52:50] attitude and spirit right
[52:51] and and uh toward all the brethren
[52:56] to know toward those that are around us
[52:57] with us and so on and
[53:00] again and again toward those out there
[53:02] as i said
[53:03] i met that gentleman uh and fellowship
[53:06] with him
[53:07] in uh uh in he was in anakin church
[53:10] and he was anakin but
[53:14] he was really enthused just to have
[53:16] fellowship with me and
[53:17] just to talk about the word and praise
[53:19] the lord and oh yeah he threw him it was
[53:22] wonderful
[53:23] and he said thank you brother and as i
[53:25] said when
[53:27] when he was nearing the end of his
[53:28] journey he called for me
[53:31] amen so god rest his soul amen
[53:34] and he he did end up in in palpa care
[53:37] in one of the hospitals a man and the
[53:40] lord called him home
[53:41] amen took him i believe all right and he
[53:44] was the one that came in and just give
[53:45] me tithes
[53:46] uh checking the envelope brother he said
[53:49] god bless you he said you've been a
[53:50] you've been a blessing to me and he said
[53:52] it's good you've helped me
[53:54] with with what you've talked about in
[53:55] the word and so on
[53:57] amen and so again this just before the
[54:00] lord called gnome there was a couple of
[54:02] times
[54:02] that i i visited with him and had
[54:05] fellowship with him and prayer with him
[54:07] and as i said oh yeah he had a bible
[54:10] and he had pieces there underlined this
[54:13] underlined that underline
[54:15] and he like he said he says his family
[54:17] didn't like it he said when they come to
[54:19] visit him because they knew
[54:20] his bible was going to be open on the
[54:22] table yeah and he said
[54:24] all conversations go back to the word
[54:26] amen
[54:27] sure that was good praise the lord so
[54:30] god bless him
[54:31] so again if he's not bride he's going to
[54:34] be outside the city
[54:36] and as i said i'll find the scripture
[54:38] someday where he
[54:39] when he was in his house in in his bed
[54:42] rather for the last time
[54:43] and and he had this scripture there his
[54:46] bible there
[54:47] and he said oh yeah he said go here go
[54:50] there and he said you read that
[54:52] yeah i said that's me he says where i am
[54:55] amen i said i believe it amen amen
[54:58] i believe it brother if you could see
[55:00] yourself in the word
[55:02] in glory in glory not just here on the
[55:04] earth but in glory
[55:06] amen he said well yeah i'm going to be
[55:07] with that group and it was it was
[55:10] one of the groups and wrote in the book
[55:11] of revelation i said that's you i said
[55:13] brother
[55:14] now it wasn't bride but it was those
[55:16] outside the city
[55:18] they're going to be there thank god amen
[55:21] show grace of god because if we don't
[55:23] have the right attitude here
[55:24] toward them we won't we won't be there
[55:27] to have a right attitude
[55:28] so maybe they'll go in and and and we
[55:32] should be shut out
[55:33] and i'll tell you there's a lot of
[55:34] believers won't make it
[55:36] because of their attitude and their
[55:38] spirit god help us
[55:41] by the grace of god amen
[55:44] so the lord bless us and i just wanted
[55:46] to say tonight that the lord willing
[55:48] will be
[55:48] playing a tape by brother branham on
[55:51] faith
[55:52] and it is faith without works is
[55:55] dead and the prophet has highlighted
[55:58] this a number of times
[56:00] in his ministry but i think there's
[56:02] about 20 odd sermons that he preached
[56:05] on faith so we trusted good
[56:08] tonight we'll hear what what what we
[56:10] need to hear
[56:11] regarding faith come on check your own
[56:14] faith do you have the faith that pleases
[56:16] god
[56:17] there's many with this faith this faith
[56:19] but it doesn't please god
[56:20] it's not what god's looking for so i
[56:23] pray grace that we have the faith that
[56:24] pleases god
[56:26] amen and i tell you one of the
[56:29] attributes or the attributes of
[56:31] of the faith that pleases god is the
[56:33] faith that's got a right attitude
[56:34] and a right spirit amen
[56:38] bear with me
[56:42] amen let me read you the scriptures
[56:45] that i read when i preached that
[56:49] first sermon i guess over 50 years ago
[56:54] amen and he said
[56:59] ye have heard that it had been said that
[57:01] thou should love thy neighbor
[57:03] and hate thine enemy but i say unto you
[57:07] love your enemies amen
[57:10] love your enemies if you love them you
[57:13] got a right attitude
[57:14] toward them amen love your enemies
[57:18] bless them that curse you
[57:21] amen do good to them that
[57:24] ate you oh brother
[57:28] god help us god's judging you by this
[57:31] word tonight
[57:33] amen so do you love your enemies
[57:37] do you bless them that curse you do you
[57:40] do good to them that ate you
[57:42] and pray for them which despitefully use
[57:45] you
[57:46] and persecute you amen
[57:49] praise the lord that ye may be the
[57:52] children of your
[57:53] father amen your heavenly father
[57:58] that ye may be the children of your
[58:00] father which is in heaven
[58:01] for he maketh his son to rise on the
[58:04] evil
[58:05] and on the good
[58:08] and sendeth rain on the just
[58:11] and on the unjust amen
[58:14] the rain we need to bring forth the
[58:17] fruit
[58:18] for if ye love them which love you what
[58:21] reward
[58:22] have you and this is jesus talking
[58:26] he said do not even the publicans the
[58:28] same and he said if you salute your
[58:30] brethren only
[58:31] what do ye more than others do not even
[58:34] the public consult
[58:36] amen and he said be there for perfect
[58:40] even as your father which is in heaven
[58:42] is perfect
[58:44] and brother we're not we're not
[58:45] referring to
[58:47] the perfection when it comes to the
[58:48] physical all everything we're doing or
[58:50] not doing whatever
[58:51] no brother it is not a sinless
[58:55] perfection
[58:56] but it is the perfection of your
[58:58] attitude
[59:00] and your spirit and your motives and
[59:02] your objectives amen
[59:04] oh yes the brother is highlighting the
[59:06] fact that that is not
[59:08] not sinless maturity no no
[59:11] it's the maturity of your brain maturity
[59:13] of of your your
[59:15] of you being a son of god amen
[59:18] amen you're mature so that you're not
[59:21] going to believe the
[59:22] and treat the word like like a baby
[59:25] no you're you're a mature son and
[59:27] daughter of god
[59:29] amen you're going to have a right
[59:30] attitude and a right spirit
[59:32] you're gonna have a right motor right
[59:33] objective amen you're not there to go
[59:36] and condemn this one and condemn that
[59:37] one
[59:37] kick this one out kick that one out no
[59:40] you leave it all with the lord
[59:41] amen and you put yourself under god's
[59:44] control
[59:46] and he said it's not sinless perfection
[59:49] he said in the in this passage the
[59:51] father's kindness
[59:53] not sinlessness is the point in the
[59:56] question
[59:57] not that he said it's your attitude
[1:00:00] having a right attitude and the right
[1:00:02] spirit
[1:00:03] by the grace of god amen so i pray
[1:00:07] that we by the power of the holy ghost
[1:00:09] that we got that perfection of jesus in
[1:00:11] us
[1:00:12] amen and i'll tell you this brother if
[1:00:14] you got it
[1:00:15] they will out there recognize it oh yeah

[1:25:31] said went up the meeting on that you

[1:25:55] everything he makes

[1:26:03] these sheriffs people there's only look
[1:26:05] at you and
[1:26:06] actually the testimony of yourself not
[1:26:08] explaining tracks and everything
[1:26:10] scattered the gospel everywhere
[1:26:11] will probably be with us shortly again
[1:26:13] in this campaign
[1:26:14] it's more blessed he is than it is
[1:26:19] uh that isn't saying if you let god tell
[1:26:22] you what to do
[1:26:23] when god tells you if mrs jones over
[1:26:25] there is a weird woman
[1:26:27] and needs some some clothes
[1:26:30] and he speaks to you to go help that
[1:26:32] with a woman you go to help
[1:26:37] [Music]
[1:26:46] is that right we came into the world
[1:26:49] naked we go out of the world naked
[1:26:51] as jokes said the lord gave the lord
[1:26:53] taken away
[1:26:54] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:26:59] hi everybody be reverend be prayerful
[1:27:03] and god will bless us i'm sure
[1:27:07] i'm going to ask you something tonight
[1:27:11] if you will for me while i reach you
[1:27:15] maybe i'll wait till i reach
[1:27:23] [Applause]
[1:27:28] there is a certain man in this city
[1:27:32] i just heard the news just now that if i
[1:27:35] would return
[1:27:36] back be here to sunday afternoon and
[1:27:38] sunday he would send some big auditorium
[1:27:41] somewhere
[1:27:42] to have a sunday afternoon
[1:27:56] god bless you if you've got that much
[1:27:59] heart for the sick people
[1:28:01] your blessing will come to you just the
[1:28:03] same thing
[1:28:04] the season means
[1:28:08] now in saint james the third the second
[1:28:11] chapter
[1:28:11] and the 21st first this would
[1:28:15] almost look like a contradiction in this
[1:28:17] picture
[1:28:18] but there is no contradictions in this
[1:28:20] picture
[1:28:21] you know the you've heard people say
[1:28:23] that scripture
[1:28:24] contradicts itself it does not
[1:28:28] for 10 years there was a challenge
[1:28:30] placed on my platform i pulled it
[1:28:33] that any person who could show a
[1:28:34] contradiction in god's word and should
[1:28:36] not be straightened by the word of
[1:28:41] all the god is mingled up that's right
[1:28:43] it's all
[1:28:44] broke up and placed in here that's
[1:28:46] reason
[1:28:47] seminary theological schools
[1:28:51] will never be able to anoint its hit
[1:28:54] from the eyes of the wise ingredient
[1:28:56] and will be revealed debate such as will
[1:28:59] learn
[1:29:01] you have to it tells me how much doing
[1:29:03] you got
[1:29:05] a certain little boy down in kentucky
[1:29:08] holds the country where i came from
[1:29:12] someone senator they said brother
[1:29:14] bennett what florida kentucky you're
[1:29:16] from
[1:29:17] oh my way down in kentucky where they
[1:29:21] way down don't even have roads in there
[1:29:23] [Applause]
[1:29:29] a little boring about the second grade
[1:29:32] he got up there one day he's the teacher
[1:29:35] the lord called me to preach
[1:29:36] [Applause]
[1:29:40] the lord called me to preach i guess the
[1:29:43] boy was 15 16 years old
[1:29:45] and said while the teacher said the very
[1:29:47] eyes
[1:29:49] forget about it well he went to the
[1:29:51] principle of school
[1:29:53] oh they couldn't let him preach but the
[1:29:55] few months after that
[1:29:56] some great minister came through with
[1:29:58] some great
[1:30:00] deed to his name so they permitted him
[1:30:03] to have the school
[1:30:05] so he preached at a two-week meeting
[1:30:08] never had
[1:30:08] one conversion so the boy
[1:30:11] father thought the boy really was all
[1:30:13] the greeks he went to the principal said
[1:30:15] well if you let him have it
[1:30:17] why don't you let my boy have a try so
[1:30:20] they
[1:30:20] went down there and he they didn't have
[1:30:22] it they all everybody came out to hear
[1:30:24] this boy that night
[1:30:26] he got up there he couldn't read the
[1:30:27] bible they had to get somebody to read
[1:30:30] the bible for him
[1:30:31] and he got the preaching but when he got
[1:30:34] to preaching that little cell style
[1:30:36] teacher along with about 50 others found
[1:30:38] herself in the order weeping their way
[1:30:40] through the cries
[1:30:41] okay that's right and there was a real
[1:30:43] revival broke out in that part of the
[1:30:45] country and literally hundreds came to
[1:30:46] christ
[1:30:47] why it doesn't take the great education
[1:30:51] it takes a full surrendered heart to
[1:30:54] jesus christ
[1:30:56] no matter how illiterate you are so
[1:30:59] food will not air in the way is that
[1:31:03] right
[1:31:04] so listen closely now as we read the
[1:31:06] word
[1:31:08] why not abraham our father justified by
[1:31:11] works
[1:31:12] when he had offered isaac his son upon
[1:31:14] the altar
[1:31:15] this townhouse faith with his work
[1:31:18] and by work or faith made perfect
[1:31:22] and the scripture was fulfilled which
[1:31:24] saith abraham believed god
[1:31:26] and it was refuted unto him for
[1:31:28] righteousness and he was called the
[1:31:31] friend of god
[1:31:33] you see then how that by work a man is
[1:31:36] justified and not by faith only
[1:31:40] likewise also was hard justified
[1:31:42] justifiable work
[1:31:44] when she received the messages and sent
[1:31:47] them
[1:31:48] out another way far as the body
[1:31:52] without the spirit is dead
[1:31:55] so faith without work
[1:31:58] is dead also now
[1:32:02] the first thing it looks like paul was
[1:32:04] speaking
[1:32:05] in romans the fourth chapter justifying
[1:32:08] abraham by faith
[1:32:11] and james is justified him by work
[1:32:14] but it does not contradict
[1:32:17] paul was speaking of what god saw in
[1:32:20] abraham and james was speaking
[1:32:24] what man saw in abraham
[1:32:27] paul was speaking of what god saw in
[1:32:30] abraham in genesis 6 20 told him
[1:32:32] that he was going to have this child by
[1:32:35] sarah
[1:32:37] and abraham believed god it was imputed
[1:32:40] into him
[1:32:43] he believed the promise that's what god
[1:32:45] saw
[1:32:47] and then james speaking was speaking of
[1:32:50] what
[1:32:51] man saw and genesis 22
[1:32:54] or abraham offered up isaac see
[1:32:58] what faith is what faith you have that's
[1:33:01] what god sees
[1:33:03] but what your works is that's what your
[1:33:06] neighbors see
[1:33:08] see show me your work by your faith
[1:33:10] without your faith and i'll show you my
[1:33:12] words by my faith
[1:33:14] see notice i believe that this
[1:33:18] audience here has faith
[1:33:22] i believe that but i believe you're
[1:33:24] afraid to turn it loose on work
[1:33:28] or i i believe that you would just let
[1:33:31] your
[1:33:31] faith loose
[1:33:36] now as far as i know got two more knots
[1:33:39] and last night even tonight i'm trying
[1:33:42] my best to hold back just to close the
[1:33:44] candle
[1:33:44] and keep from straining too hard then
[1:33:47] the last two nights
[1:33:48] if god be my helper i'm going to throw
[1:33:50] my whole heart everything i got to
[1:33:52] deserve
[1:33:55] but i like to get this to you while i'm
[1:33:58] speaking because
[1:33:59] probably tomorrow night and next night i
[1:34:01] don't even want to say nothing just had
[1:34:03] prayer line get ready and come on the
[1:34:04] platforms we'll pray for the sake
[1:34:07] but if you would do this dear friend
[1:34:11] if you would give god a chance now you
[1:34:14] believe i'll ask you if you believe you
[1:34:16] say yes
[1:34:16] is that right if you believe you say yes
[1:34:20] then if you believe you've got to act
[1:34:22] like you believe
[1:34:24] isn't that right you've got to act
[1:34:27] like you believe
[1:34:31] now notice
[1:34:34] if you could believe say for instance i
[1:34:37] was at the altar as the sinner
[1:34:40] now the only way that you will ever be
[1:34:43] able
[1:34:43] to obtain anything from god
[1:34:47] is by faith
[1:34:51] you all understand that for the whole
[1:34:54] christian armor is faith
[1:34:59] love joy peace long suffering goodness
[1:35:03] weakness gentleness patience
[1:35:05] all the unseen
[1:35:09] and we as christians
[1:35:12] we do not look at what we see
[1:35:15] we look at what we believe
[1:35:18] see what i mean we believe it
[1:35:22] before there's any natural evidence the
[1:35:25] virgin mary
[1:35:27] when the angel of god met her instead of
[1:35:30] hail mary
[1:35:32] blessed art thou among women and began
[1:35:35] to tell her that she was going to
[1:35:37] give birth to a child without knowing
[1:35:39] any man being a virgin
[1:35:42] she accepted the angel's word
[1:35:45] and she began to testify and tell people
[1:35:48] that she was going to have a baby
[1:35:50] without knowing a man
[1:35:52] before there was any natural evidence at
[1:35:54] all
[1:35:55] she just believed it and she acted upon
[1:35:59] what she believed
[1:36:01] now that's what you have to do to get
[1:36:02] well
[1:36:04] now once there was no one to tell me
[1:36:07] what to do
[1:36:08] by gift when i was at mayo brothers
[1:36:11] rochester
[1:36:12] when they looked at me the best doctor
[1:36:16] in the world and said you haven't even
[1:36:19] got
[1:36:19] any kind of a chance but
[1:36:23] one scripture that is hebrews
[1:36:27] 3 1 i've seen that
[1:36:30] that he is the high priest of our
[1:36:32] confession
[1:36:34] he's sitting at the right hand of the
[1:36:36] father to make good anything that we
[1:36:38] confess that he
[1:36:39] has done but he cannot do nothing for us
[1:36:43] until
[1:36:44] first we confess that he has done it and
[1:36:47] act upon it see when you whatsoever
[1:36:50] things you desire
[1:36:51] jesus sees whatsoever things you desire
[1:36:56] when you pray believe you receive it
[1:37:00] that's the order see you believe now you
[1:37:02] receive it and it shall be given
[1:37:04] to you that's the future or he's the
[1:37:06] high priest to make the intercession
[1:37:08] for your confession and he cannot give
[1:37:11] you
[1:37:11] until first you confess he has nick can
[1:37:14] he save you
[1:37:16] no matter how much you cried you could
[1:37:19] come to the altar
[1:37:20] and cry and pull your hair and scream
[1:37:24] and say god god have mercy i believe in
[1:37:27] old-fashioned repentance
[1:37:29] but you can say that and repent until
[1:37:32] year after year and you have never been
[1:37:34] saved until you believe
[1:37:35] in your heart that he had saved it and
[1:37:38] raised up
[1:37:39] and confessed it if you confess me
[1:37:41] before man i'll confess you before my
[1:37:43] father
[1:37:44] and the holy angels is that true i see
[1:37:47] you cannot be saved
[1:37:49] only by faith and confession
[1:37:53] is that right now he will make good
[1:37:56] anything that he died for and here you
[1:37:59] said did he die for my healing
[1:38:02] as god he was wounded for our
[1:38:06] transgression
[1:38:07] bruised for our iniquity the chapter of
[1:38:10] our peace was upon him
[1:38:12] and with his stripes we are healed
[1:38:17] the 80 percent of his ministry
[1:38:20] was divine healing 80 of his ministry
[1:38:23] was on the miraculous side
[1:38:25] showing the people that the supernatural
[1:38:27] god was working in human flesh
[1:38:30] and my brother's sister may i say this
[1:38:32] is reverend
[1:38:33] that's exactly what he's doing in this
[1:38:35] tent now
[1:38:36] trying to get to the people but if he
[1:38:39] was standing here
[1:38:41] tonight dressed in these clothes
[1:38:44] he could not do any more for you than
[1:38:47] what he's doing here
[1:38:48] night after night is that right
[1:38:53] or he could not he could tell you what
[1:38:56] you were what you'd done what was wrong
[1:38:58] with you
[1:38:59] but you could not eat it until you
[1:39:01] believed it
[1:39:04] and when you would believe it the father
[1:39:06] would receive it to him
[1:39:08] and he'd tell you go your way your sins
[1:39:11] are forgiven and so forth
[1:39:13] is that where he acted in his ministry
[1:39:15] and listen to his own sacred
[1:39:18] words coming from his sacred lips
[1:39:23] he said very very i say to you the son
[1:39:26] can do nothing in himself
[1:39:28] but what he sees the father doing
[1:39:31] the father makes known to the son and
[1:39:34] the son
[1:39:35] speaks what the father said well that is
[1:39:38] he was standing here and you'd accept
[1:39:40] god as your healer
[1:39:41] and you'd be healed then the sun would
[1:39:45] reveal of you
[1:39:46] your sins are gone you're leading his
[1:39:48] right now isn't that just exactly
[1:39:51] what the son of god is still doing
[1:39:54] working through mankind his instrument
[1:39:58] oh are you i
[1:40:01] wish i could have words that i could
[1:40:03] just give this to you
[1:40:05] to think of a people's time
[1:40:08] where people do anything in the world
[1:40:12] for you
[1:40:14] and you don't know exactly what you need
[1:40:18] and know what you want and how can i get
[1:40:21] it to you see
[1:40:23] and if i could oh
[1:40:26] my i would stand here and say right now
[1:40:29] if i had some little
[1:40:30] capsules that i could give everyone it
[1:40:32] would all be healed
[1:40:33] and i know it can work hit those
[1:40:35] capsules then i would have to take
[1:40:38] one of them with my nose and start
[1:40:40] pushing it from here
[1:40:41] the plum is so high down the road going
[1:40:44] down through the street pushing the mind
[1:40:45] over
[1:40:46] knowing that that would any of you
[1:40:47] people when i got the columbus that i
[1:40:49] had no
[1:40:50] knowledge i would start tonight
[1:40:54] that's right uh god knows where i'm
[1:40:57] telling the truth or not
[1:41:00] i would start down the street
[1:41:09] you know i want my father glorified
[1:41:13] and how i want him to be magnified i
[1:41:16] want
[1:41:16] all the
[1:41:31] think of that now how do we get healed
[1:41:34] in brother bran
[1:41:35] the first thing you cannot be healed
[1:41:39] you're just making yourself life in air
[1:41:42] until in your heart you believe the
[1:41:45] dream
[1:41:48] or if i remember you can't play with
[1:41:50] satan he knows whether you believe or
[1:41:52] not
[1:41:55] don't you try just to make out you
[1:41:57] really believe
[1:41:58] and i think friends if you would get
[1:42:00] down to business with god
[1:42:02] he'd come to business with you
[1:42:07] oh how you could just get that thing
[1:42:09] look
[1:42:10] then by faith you look to the high
[1:42:13] priest of your potential
[1:42:15] you are healed just by the same merits
[1:42:18] that you're
[1:42:18] saved by you're saved by the merits of
[1:42:22] christ is that right
[1:42:24] not not what's your own merit there's
[1:42:26] nothing you can do
[1:42:28] to be states only believe on him
[1:42:32] i could go to heaven in my righteousness
[1:42:35] could you go to heaven in your
[1:42:36] righteousness god would receive it
[1:42:39] but he will receive the righteousness of
[1:42:42] his son
[1:42:44] and if we believe on him as the
[1:42:46] scripture says
[1:42:48] believe that he is and will confront him
[1:42:52] he will work the righteousness
[1:42:54] [Applause]
[1:43:08] you'll go right straight back to your
[1:43:10] sin again like a hall to a squalor
[1:43:12] and a dog food sign that's fine
[1:43:15] but as long as you're willing to could
[1:43:17] you imagine taking a hulk from a swallow
[1:43:21] you could take a whole guy and bring
[1:43:24] this
[1:43:25] hog in and rub it up with style sodium
[1:43:27] whatever you want to do
[1:43:29] uh do that
[1:43:32] painting on their toenails like women do
[1:43:34] on their fingers
[1:43:35] and mix it up with with holes on
[1:43:40] and put it on a hardwood floor
[1:43:43] and give it great nuts for breakfast and
[1:43:46] that hulk would
[1:43:47] die you take him and turn
[1:43:51] [Music]
[1:44:04] but you put a lamb out there and that
[1:44:07] water
[1:44:08] it'll bleed and grind somebody gets you
[1:44:12] now if you want to keep the hog out of
[1:44:14] the water
[1:44:17] [Music]
[1:44:18] that's best way to keep the center out
[1:44:20] of the things of the world
[1:44:22] change the nature from a sinner to a
[1:44:24] christian
[1:44:25] and that can only be done through that
[1:44:28] great powerful work
[1:44:29] i see prostitutes sometimes this is the
[1:44:34] first time we ever had
[1:44:37] the big auditorium
[1:44:40] for the maniacs i'll tell you a little
[1:44:41] story
[1:44:44] i walk into a room not long ago
[1:45:15] i looked at her i couldn't detect
[1:45:18] anything just right
[1:45:20] so i thought i'd sit down talk to her
[1:45:21] she said are you connie startled i said
[1:45:23] yes ma'am
[1:45:25] people here she said well brother and i
[1:45:28] will give you my story
[1:45:30] i said all right and she begins to talk
[1:45:34] she said when i was a little child i was
[1:45:36] rearing the catholic home
[1:45:38] she said but i got out with a bunch of
[1:45:40] girls one time
[1:45:41] they got me and i got the drink around
[1:45:44] the lunch boys i become a professional
[1:45:46] drunk
[1:45:47] by the children and said when i begin to
[1:45:50] drink
[1:45:51] both and i begin to be a prostitute on
[1:45:54] the street
[1:45:56] selling the morals of her wife and she
[1:45:59] said
[1:45:59] they taking me up and put me in a good
[1:46:01] shepherd's home
[1:46:03] and said when i served the term in there
[1:46:05] so of course while i was in there
[1:46:06] i had to do that said when i got out i
[1:46:09] went right back to it again
[1:46:12] and so then the law picked me up and
[1:46:13] gave me a two years and a woman's prison

[1:49:23] what was it there was no medicine she
[1:49:26] touched
[1:49:27] but by the supernatural
[1:49:30] divine power of the transformation that
[1:49:33] was
[1:49:33] over the power of jesus christ struck
[1:49:36] her and ugly
[1:49:37] all the desire and the iniquity and as
[1:49:41] she would die tonight her
[1:49:42] soul's as flat as anybody else that's

[1:50:13] everything was
[1:50:14] the law failed were the houses of the
[1:50:16] corrections sale
[1:50:18] where medical science failed the blood
[1:50:20] of jesus christ tucked up and can't fail
[1:50:24] why by faith while the power
[1:50:27] of god that would change a prostitute to
[1:50:30] a saint
[1:50:32] a drunkard to a righteous woman
[1:50:35] while that by the same power will take
[1:50:38] any cancer death dumb blind cripples
[1:50:42] for the same blood from the same man on
[1:50:44] the same day
[1:50:46] a tone for your healing that atoned for
[1:50:48] your salvation
[1:50:50] is that the truth he was wounded for
[1:50:52] your transaction

[1:51:28] when god made many nations in his image
[1:51:30] his spirit man
[1:51:32] and he's putting in five senses to
[1:51:34] contact his earthly home
[1:51:37] not to contact god with those senses
[1:51:40] don't declare god
[1:51:42] they declare the earthly home where the
[1:51:45] man had to contact his earthly home he
[1:51:46] had to see
[1:51:48] faith deal smell here
[1:51:52] but faith is the substance that things

[1:51:56] the evidence that they not seen you do
[1:51:59] not see it patient see it smell it or
[1:52:00] you're
[1:52:01] what you believe it see what i mean

[1:52:10] the lady sitting here who are the young
[1:52:12] ladies saying here i'm talking to
[1:52:14] crippled people
[1:52:15] and here and there and the people's got
[1:52:18] diseases

[1:52:21] now
[1:52:22] and so you were so sure that you were
[1:52:25] healed
[1:52:26] just as sure as you say that's why it's
[1:52:29] over
[1:52:30] i'll assure you if you'll get that type
[1:52:32] of faith
[1:52:33] god almighty will stick to me and tell
[1:52:36] you your heels
[1:52:38] will reveal it see friends therefore you
[1:52:41] see i'm sorry away for myself it's not

[1:52:48] could breathe without god could you
[1:52:50] let your spirit lead you you're gone is
[1:52:53] that right
[1:52:54] god holds your life in his hands is that
[1:52:57] true
[1:52:58] you can't make yourself live you live by
[1:53:01] god
[1:53:02] just the same as i can't stand until god
[1:53:05] says something
[1:53:06] i have no control of it he says it
[1:53:10] when he says it then it's true
[1:53:14] then it's true god confirms it with
[1:53:16] signs and wonders
[1:53:18] have faith place your faith in christ
[1:53:22] now it doesn't matter if i recall
[1:53:25] a reverend markham or one of these
[1:53:26] ministers
[1:53:29] up to the platform to pray for you
[1:53:34] if you adjust according to your faith be
[1:53:37] it unto you
[1:53:38] that minister has just as much right to
[1:53:40] pray or any other minister
[1:53:42] or not only a minister but any christian
[1:53:45] who's the believer
[1:53:47] to pray with faith that our faith
[1:53:51] anybody who believes is praying for the
[1:54:07] that's right
[1:54:10] you said daddy look at that little girl
[1:54:13] i said pray for honey and
[1:54:14] the weaker two from that the child as
[1:54:16] well
[1:54:18] the child god hears anybody
[1:54:30] the first sin that was ever committed
[1:54:32] was doubting god's word
[1:54:36] is that right god said the day that
[1:54:38] every day you die
[1:54:40] they said surely you'll not die and he
[1:54:42] got eve to doubt
[1:54:44] god's word and go to seeking knowledge
[1:54:46] is that right
[1:54:47] today the whole world i have nothing
[1:54:49] against education
[1:54:51] but the world has got an educational
[1:54:53] program and they've got it down into the
[1:54:55] church
[1:54:56] and from the platform the minister has
[1:54:58] to be a certain degree
[1:55:00] or something or he has to have so many
[1:55:02] uh degrees or anything
[1:55:04] or you can be a welcome in a platform
[1:55:06] you let me give them some of these
[1:55:07] aristocratic churches and use my
[1:55:09] kentucky words to use from scary
[1:55:11] investors
[1:55:12] just kick me out but look brother the
[1:55:15] kingdom of god don't come by education
[1:55:18] that's right it comes by a surrendered
[1:55:21] heart to god and i'm not trying to
[1:55:25] support my injuries
[1:55:26] but i'm saying this my dear friend
[1:55:30] that is simple child faith don't speak
[1:55:33] for knowledge
[1:55:34] now you're thinking i'm throwing it out
[1:55:36] to doctors i believe that doctors
[1:55:39] i believe in hospitals institutions
[1:55:41] whatever can help anybody
[1:55:43] god and more but there's not
[1:55:47] one of them that ever did heal
[1:55:50] anybody and they don't confess their
[1:55:52] best to heal somebody
[1:55:54] they claim to assist nature god is the
[1:55:56] healer
[1:55:58] if i cut a plate in my hand as i go just
[1:56:00] unite the gold
[1:56:01] all the medicine in the world would heal
[1:56:03] at him if i die and it involved me
[1:56:06] throw that hand up put all kind of
[1:56:07] messages on it 50 years but they would
[1:56:09] still be there
[1:56:11] medicine doesn't heal you take the life
[1:56:13] out of there
[1:56:14] there's no healing life is a healer and
[1:56:17] life
[1:56:18] is god jesus came that you might have
[1:56:20] abundance of life
[1:56:22] more life than what your normal life is
[1:56:24] to believe on
[1:56:27] i'm him excited but i know what i'm
[1:56:30] speaking
[1:56:31] of that the right mental
[1:56:34] attitude towards any promise of god will
[1:56:37] bring it to pass
[1:56:40] there it is you say why are you talking
[1:56:43] about
[1:56:43] it are you anybody
[1:56:48] you're an addition here is the first and
[1:56:51] only foundation for divine healing or
[1:56:53] anything from god is the bible
[1:56:56] if you get over that you're out of god's
[1:56:58] will
[1:56:59] and divine healing is a hopeless purpose
[1:57:02] affair
[1:57:03] it isn't a few mystery words over
[1:57:05] somebody's hypnotizing
[1:57:07] it's the truth revealed through jesus
[1:57:10] christ
[1:57:16] that's right gifts of the spirit
[1:57:20] are brought down to anybody or
[1:57:24] other work it's the flag of flying over
[1:57:26] top of the building
[1:57:27] it's the appearance of the outside to
[1:57:29] attract the people in
[1:57:31] out of the rain see what i mean
[1:57:36] now if come from god if they
[1:57:39] are from god they'll testify of god
[1:57:42] and god will testify them is that true
[1:57:46] if you are sick free until you believe
[1:57:51] with
[1:57:51] all your you never get paid for
[1:57:53] something you just know you're gonna get
[1:57:54] it
[1:57:55] that's faith
[1:57:58] now if you believe that with all your
[1:58:01] heart
[1:58:02] expresses and passed on now you can
[1:58:05] believe it just as much as you wanted to
[1:58:06] if you didn't act on it you're set
[1:58:08] right there like a sinner would let the
[1:58:09] altar if you got all that praise great
[1:58:12] you said lord i know you're saying even
[1:58:15] i know you said he'll never get through
[1:58:17] until he rises and confesses and he
[1:58:20] stays with it and shows works with it
[1:58:22] james says justice and body is dead
[1:58:24] without the spirit
[1:58:26] soul is faith without work to say it
[1:58:30] no matter how much you believe and
[1:58:32] that's what i'm telling you friends
[1:58:34] these kids are brought in to make the
[1:58:36] presence of god real to you
[1:58:37] i guess i'm really happy
[1:58:41] the kids are brought to make the
[1:58:43] presence of god real to you
[1:58:45] then your faith will god and accept
[1:58:48] divine healing or salvation or whatever
[1:58:50] you have needed from god
[1:58:53] it is only through one thing or other
[1:58:55] anything that you have need of this
[1:58:57] earth journey
[1:58:58] god will supply if you have need of it
[1:59:01] he promised to supply your needs not
[1:59:03] your wants
[1:59:04] your needs and he's god
[1:59:07] and he can only get it to you as you
[1:59:10] believe him
[1:59:11] and gifts are to make you see that he
[1:59:13] shared in his attitude
[1:59:16] towards one is towards all
[1:59:19] amen

[1:59:26] an
[1:59:26] awful secure sort of a person but i wish
[1:59:29] i could just take the faith that's in my
[1:59:31] heart and spread it out to you right now
[1:59:34] you see what i mean there'll be a
[1:59:36] spontaneous something happening here
[1:59:39] that every person in the building you

[2:00:17] now jesus to identify himself
[2:00:21] he identifies not himself
[2:00:24] but his father the father that does the
[2:00:28] word
[2:00:29] now when philip comes he showed philip
[2:00:32] the family
[2:00:33] the people where the mules were tied
[2:00:35] where the money was the features now

[2:00:49] again and be with you even
[2:00:51] if the spirit of an artist is in it we
[2:00:54] could paint a picture like an artist
[2:00:56] if the spirit of the danger was in us
[2:00:58] we'd have guns
[2:00:59] if the spirit of christ is in us we'll
[2:01:01] put our meetings
[2:01:03] do like christ we'll act like and then

[2:12:39] and moving on believing claiming the
[2:12:41] promise

[2:13:30] and when he when he comes
[2:13:31] brings it to a complete to a climax
[2:13:34] where we enter into a resurrection and

[2:14:03] dead in christ shall rise first
[2:14:05] and then we which are light remain shall
[2:14:07] be cut up together with them
[2:14:09] to meet the lord in the air the prophet
[2:14:11] of god did say
[2:14:12] he said at the time of the resurrection
[2:14:14] of the rapture he said the dead in
[2:14:15] christ
[2:14:16] he said who are waiting on us he said

[2:14:43] he said
[2:14:43] oh they will live up and there's jesus.
[2:14:46] and he said why
[2:14:47] because brother he was in that body of
[2:14:49] flesh he came back in the pillar of fire

[2:14:53] and there he said in his second coming

[2:17:31] old nature and the more sensitive we're
[2:17:33] coming to the new we got to
[2:17:37] we got to see that's the trouble with
[2:17:39] the jews
[2:17:40] when when they came out of egypt and
[2:17:42] going into the promised land and look
[2:17:43] considering all that god
[2:17:45] did in egypt considering all that god
[2:17:48] did
[2:17:49] in delivering the the jews then bringing
[2:17:51] them from egypt right on up to the
[2:17:53] border of the promised land
[2:17:55] tree took them through the red sea he
[2:17:57] took them through this and that
[2:17:59] oh my he defended them here he delivered
[2:18:01] them here and so on
[2:18:02] and yet when they got to the border the
[2:18:04] red of the promised land
[2:18:06] went into the promised land come back
[2:18:08] out with the
[2:18:09] whoa what with their shorts oh yeah it's
[2:18:11] exactly like god said it was
[2:18:14] yeah they believed that but
[2:18:17] they let they allowed those that were
[2:18:18] living there to to
[2:18:20] to cause them to doubt oh yeah there's
[2:18:24] oh
[2:18:24] we can't go in and get it oh no we we're
[2:18:27] not able to do this
[2:18:29] and uh but joshua caleb and there they
[2:18:32] were all they said listen if god be with
[2:18:34] us who can be against us

[2:18:39] of god
[2:18:40] come on this let's go in no couldn't go
[2:18:42] because
[2:18:44] those seed that came out the jews that
[2:18:47] came out
[2:18:48] no they they didn't believe they
[2:18:50] wouldn't trust god for that
[2:18:52] or got to the place even where they
[2:18:53] wanted to stone
[2:18:55] joshua and caleb there and just get rid
[2:18:57] of them get rid of them
[2:18:58] you know because why because they were
[2:19:00] focusing on this revelation this
[2:19:02] revelation get in get in get in
[2:19:04] and brother if we are we are the true
[2:19:06] servants of god
[2:19:07] the true servants of god the true
[2:19:09] ministry of god amen
[2:19:10] is full is going to focus on going in to
[2:19:13] possess
[2:19:14] eternity to get out of this body and
[2:19:16] into a glorified body
[2:19:18] amen oh yeah but again i i
[2:19:21] like i was on my thought on my heart and
[2:19:24] i'll share with you
[2:19:25] more detail concerning what is the
[2:19:28] ministry preaching
[2:19:30] what are they putting the answers on
[2:19:33] around the message
[2:19:36] god help us see as the problem of god
[2:19:39] moved from one phase to another
[2:19:41] and and the emphasis he was putting on
[2:19:43] this was
[2:19:45] going down he put the emphasis on this
[2:19:48] then he put the emphasis on this
[2:19:49] he put the emphasis on the resurrection
[2:19:51] on the rapture amen
[2:19:53] and again go to that message again
[2:19:56] on the rapture 1965
[2:20:00] amen brother all that god was doing and
[2:20:02] all that god did
[2:20:04] amen was focusing on the rapture
[2:20:08] and to give us rapturing faith oh yeah
[2:20:12] prophet said that all that god has done
[2:20:15] they owe me the seven seals this
[2:20:17] revelation that revelation
[2:20:19] he says what is it all of it he says is
[2:20:21] to give us rapturing faith and he said
[2:20:22] the rapture has been going on
[2:20:24] all along it is coming now
[2:20:28] to perfection amen
[2:20:31] our brother sister we need to get out of
[2:20:33] here
[2:20:35] we need to get into eternity brother do
[2:20:38] you really want
[2:20:39] for me if you come from there you want
[2:20:42] to go back
[2:20:44] yeah because all that god has done and
[2:20:46] is doing in your life
[2:20:48] amen is giving preeminence to that
[2:20:50] nature
[2:20:52] that sin took away from us but god
[2:20:54] through the holy ghost get back to us
[2:20:57] amen because why because that's where we
[2:21:01] that's where we were in the mind of god
[2:21:04] before the foundation of the world
[2:21:05] our names were put on the lamb's book of
[2:21:07] life before the foundation of the world
[2:21:10] amen amen and through the through the
[2:21:12] preaching of the gospel and the new
[2:21:14] become new creatures in christ salvation
[2:21:17] redemption so on
[2:21:18] oh it changes us we were sinful
[2:21:21] just more conscious of this whole world
[2:21:23] this this do this we like this we like
[2:21:25] that
[2:21:26] but when we were born again we were put
[2:21:29] in contact with eternity
[2:21:32] hallelujah eternal sons and daughters of
[2:21:34] god
[2:21:35] knew amen we will become as it were new
[2:21:38] creatures
[2:21:39] in this whole world amen but we're going
[2:21:42] back
[2:21:43] to what we were amen by the grace of god
[2:21:47] hallelujah hallelujah oh there's a deep
[2:21:50] calling to the deep amen we're here in
[2:21:54] time but this is it
[2:21:55] god has given us the baptism of the holy
[2:21:57] ghost it made us new creatures in christ
[2:21:59] amen with a deep hunger and thirst
[2:22:02] for glory a deep anger and threat oh
[2:22:04] yeah
[2:22:05] the thing of it is that we because we
[2:22:07] were born and seen
[2:22:08] we forgot like i preached it some years
[2:22:10] ago over and uh
[2:22:13] oh yes on top of the road there
[2:22:16] you know at the college building and so
[2:22:18] on and i don't know what that what what
[2:22:21] the word was some of the brothers told
[2:22:22] me what it was after
[2:22:24] i said what happened to us we always
[2:22:26] just got into this this place where
[2:22:28] oh we we didn't know who we were didn't
[2:22:30] know what we were
[2:22:31] but all this i said but then god came to
[2:22:35] bring it back to our remembrance oh
[2:22:38] what's going on
[2:22:40] uh i'm not satisfied in this world no
[2:22:42] more
[2:22:43] i i don't like all this stuff that's
[2:22:44] going on now oh my
[2:22:46] oh i'm hungry i'm thirsty for eternity
[2:22:50] or a glorified body yes my son because
[2:22:54] that's where you come from that's where
[2:22:55] you're going
[2:22:56] by the grace of god and god god did it
[2:22:59] for a reason
[2:23:00] as the prophet said god allowed it to
[2:23:02] happen so that he could reveal to us
[2:23:04] is divine love and he said that we
[2:23:08] in hearing that word hearing the
[2:23:10] revelation would love him for himself
[2:23:14] not loving because we got to he said oh
[2:23:16] we gotta love god you know we should
[2:23:17] love god
[2:23:18] oh no he said there's a relationship
[2:23:22] that he that he brings between him and
[2:23:24] to his sons and daughters
[2:23:25] and it's the relationship where they see
[2:23:28] who he really is his nature
[2:23:30] seeing what he did to redeem us
