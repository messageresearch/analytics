[56:58] fellowship today with some of the
[56:59] brothers and sisters and we um
[57:02] looking forward to more of that as the

[57:06] everybody here tonight so happy to be
[57:08] back amen in newfoundland my home away
[57:11] from home amen that's right i uh i live
[57:15] off these meetings and i've looked
[57:16] forward to this for an entire year now
[57:18] coming no we're going to try to come
[57:20] back this way i've really been looking
[57:22] forward to it and so
[57:23] um i did something this time around that
[57:26] i wasn't able to do last time around and
[57:27] i brought our cds with us
[57:30] and uh i don't have with us tonight i
[57:32] left them in the room running out in the
[57:33] haste just trying to get things going
[57:34] and all that but uh if you'd like to get
[57:37] a copy of the cd after church
[57:40] or whatever how you'd like to arrange it
[57:42] i don't know exactly how you brothers
[57:44] handle those things but if you'd like to
[57:46] have a copy of our music we've got the
[57:49] cd available
[57:51] my wife is going to be collecting all of
[57:53] the monies and all that kind of thing
[57:55] you see how that works she gets all the
[57:56] money for it amen and we don't make
[57:59] anything off of it what we get goes
[58:01] right back into the making of the cd and
[58:03] we take it and either pay off what we've
[58:04] got on the first one or put it to the
[58:07] second one which is coming in just a
[58:08] little while we've got about maybe
[58:10] oh three or four months something like
[58:12] that and they're finishing up all of the
[58:13] little particulars to it we'll have a
[58:15] another one done the lord helping us and
[58:17] the lord willing we've sold almost a
[58:19] thousand of these first cds and they
[58:22] went very very quick and went very very
[58:24] fast because we've made people wait for
[58:25] years before they could ever take us
[58:27] home by the way of cd
[58:29] and uh the lord really blessed it and
[58:31] was a blessing to a lot of people and so
[58:33] we want to make that available to you
[58:35] this time around i packed them in a bag
[58:37] on my shoulder and protected them like i
[58:39] had a baby in my arms all the way up
[58:40] here just i tried to watch over them
[58:42] best i could and it's hard to travel
[58:44] with those little cases they're like
[58:46] eggs they crack so easy and stuff like
[58:48] that but then i found out it was twice
[58:50] the
[58:52] twice as much trying to ship them to
[58:53] canada it's a lot so i thought well i
[58:55] can buy you a case for about 30 cents
[58:57] but you know the ship is way much more
[58:59] than that so
[59:00] anyhow i thought maybe it'd be a
[59:02] blessing to you now i'm not sales
[59:04] pitching you but i just want you to know
[59:05] that they're available this week and um
[59:08] be sure to get you get you a good copy
[59:10] and put it in your cd players shout and
[59:12] clap your hands and rejoice and amen and
[59:14] be blessed by it because that's the
[59:16] purpose of why we make them is for the
[59:18] blessing of the lord and so i'm happy to
[59:20] have my wife with me and uh we're gonna
[59:23] we're gonna turn her loose the little
[59:25] girl with a big voice
[59:33] which one brother math
[59:42] [Music]
[1:00:05] out on the water
[1:00:07] a storm raging high
[1:00:10] the waters around them were troubled
[1:00:14] that night
[1:00:17] fear filled their hearts
[1:00:19] they felt that they would die
[1:00:22] they failed to remember
[1:00:25] the master was nigh
[1:00:28] he spoke the word
[1:00:31] and the winds all stood still
[1:00:34] even the waters
[1:00:38] they obeyed his will
[1:00:40] he calmed their storm
[1:00:43] just like he will do mine
[1:00:46] if i'll just remember
[1:00:49] that he lives deep
[1:00:51] inside why should i worry
[1:00:56] why should i fear
[1:00:59] when the very same jesus
[1:01:02] stays always near
[1:01:05] he lives in my heart
[1:01:08] and he hears when i cry
[1:01:11] i'll call on his name
[1:01:14] till the storm passes
[1:01:17] by
[1:01:21] we read in the bible how he walked with
[1:01:25] them
[1:01:27] he brought light to their darkness
[1:01:30] when their way grew so dim
[1:01:33] how great it would be
[1:01:36] to have his step leading mine
[1:01:39] to walk with the master
[1:01:42] all of the time
[1:01:45] so when troubles come
[1:01:48] and death seems so nice
[1:02:01] and my body is in pain all i have to do
[1:02:07] is call on your name why should i worry
[1:02:14] why should i fear
[1:02:17] when the very same jesus
[1:02:20] he saves always near he lives in my
[1:02:25] heart
[1:02:26] and he hears when i cry god i'll call on
[1:02:31] his name
[1:02:39] and why should i worry
[1:02:43] why should i fear
[1:02:46] when the very same jesus
[1:02:49] he stays always near he lives in my
[1:02:54] heart
[1:02:55] and he hears when i cry
[1:02:58] i'll call on his name
[1:03:08] i'll call on his name
[1:03:11] [Music]
[1:03:14] or call on his name
[1:03:21] i'll call on his name
[1:03:26] until the storm passes
[1:03:35] [Applause]

[1:14:47] provides a hope for us in this way
[1:14:50] that we're not looking for something
[1:14:52] greater we're just looking for something
[1:14:54] to take us higher you understand the
[1:14:56] difference nothing greater can be done
[1:14:58] than what's already been done for us as
[1:15:00] a people of god we've got eternal life
[1:15:02] it doesn't get much greater than that
[1:15:04] but for us let's just take a little bit
[1:15:06] higher turns into revelation of god amen
[1:15:09] let's read together now first
[1:15:10] thessalonians chapter 4 and let's look
[1:15:13] at verse 15.
[1:15:15] amen for this we say unto you
[1:15:18] by the word
[1:15:19] of the lord
[1:15:21] that we which are alive and remain
[1:15:24] shall
[1:15:25] not prevent which means to hinder them
[1:15:28] which are asleep
[1:15:30] but the lord himself
[1:15:32] shall descend from heaven
[1:15:34] with a shout now watch us now
[1:15:37] the lord
[1:15:38] himself for this we say unto you by the
[1:15:41] word of the lord the lord
[1:15:44] himself
[1:15:45] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[1:15:47] so we're not looking for the returning
[1:15:49] of a prophet we're looking for the lord
[1:15:51] himself
[1:15:52] amen there's a big difference between
[1:15:54] just the returning of god's servant and
[1:15:57] the lord himself now watch he comes with
[1:16:00] a shout with a voice
[1:16:03] and with the trump of god the voice of
[1:16:05] the archangel and with the trump of god
[1:16:07] and the dead in christ
[1:16:09] shall arise first everybody say first
[1:16:14] then
[1:16:15] then
[1:16:16] we which are alive and remain
[1:16:18] shall be caught up together with them in
[1:16:21] the clouds i want you to notice the
[1:16:23] order of the resurrection
[1:16:24] the
[1:16:25] dead in christ shall rise first then
[1:16:29] afterwards after they have risen then we
[1:16:32] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:16:34] caught up together with them in the
[1:16:36] clouds
[1:16:37] to meet the lord in the air and so shall
[1:16:39] we ever be with the lord verse 18
[1:16:42] wherefore comfort one another
[1:16:45] with these words can i put it in my
[1:16:48] language find hope
[1:16:51] in what's been said here
[1:16:53] find hope in what's been said here amen
[1:16:56] let's let's let's pray over the word
[1:16:58] while your heads are bowed this evening
[1:17:00] if you just like to be remembered in
[1:17:01] prayer would you just let it be known by
[1:17:03] the lifting of your hand this evening
[1:17:05] god bless you my my hands are raised
[1:17:07] with you
[1:17:08] lord jesus we so thank you this evening
[1:17:10] father for the graciousness and the
[1:17:12] mercy
[1:17:14] and the outpouring of thy holy spirit
[1:17:17] father from the moment we have stepped
[1:17:19] on this property we felt the holy ghost
[1:17:21] already encircling this little place
[1:17:24] for lord the expectation of your people
[1:17:26] and your children for these revival
[1:17:28] weekends lord they they pull you out of
[1:17:30] heaven lord that you'll come with angels
[1:17:32] of god and
[1:17:33] ministry of god that we can hear from
[1:17:35] your presence tonight and from your
[1:17:37] throne and i like lord what brother
[1:17:40] gerald said a moment ago that i would be
[1:17:43] the one getting out of the way that you
[1:17:44] could come and do the talking
[1:17:46] lord jesus i might be just a vehicle but
[1:17:49] lord allow me to bring you to the
[1:17:51] destination allow me to bring you on the
[1:17:53] scene by getting out of the way this
[1:17:55] evening my father that you could come
[1:17:57] and use my mouth and my thoughts and my
[1:17:59] body and actions and what more that be
[1:18:02] all for the glory of god to the edifying
[1:18:04] of the body of christ then lord i pray
[1:18:07] that you will not only speak through me
[1:18:08] but you will listen and hear through
[1:18:10] your children here tonight
[1:18:12] may all those gather here this evening
[1:18:14] lord may they be receptive to hear all
[1:18:16] that you would speak to us as we commit
[1:18:18] this service and every uplifted hand
[1:18:20] around this building tonight into your
[1:18:23] precious hands o lord in the name of the
[1:18:26] lord jesus christ we committed amen and
[1:18:30] amen
[1:18:31] i bless you may be seated
[1:18:34] amen so thank the lord for his mercy
[1:18:37] tonight
[1:18:38] amen you love him with all of your heart
[1:18:40] amen he loves you
[1:18:43] one thing i love about the lord jesus is
[1:18:45] that
[1:18:45] he's not prejudiced
[1:18:47] and he doesn't look at somebody's age or
[1:18:50] any of those type of things to
[1:18:52] dictate his love
[1:18:54] or to measure how much he loves us or
[1:18:57] how much he cares for us but almighty
[1:18:59] god he has a
[1:19:01] feeling toward his bride a feeling in
[1:19:03] which that you and i will never really
[1:19:05] be able to explain it we'll fail words
[1:19:08] to try to describe what that's
[1:19:10] really about i mean to us we could take
[1:19:12] scripture after scripture and quote
[1:19:14] after quote and try to frame together a
[1:19:16] thought that way but the truth of the
[1:19:18] matter is is that even in the eighth day
[1:19:20] when eternity has gone on for millions
[1:19:22] of years we'll still be trying to
[1:19:24] describe
[1:19:25] how the how in the world could god could
[1:19:27] have loved somebody like me that he
[1:19:29] could have cared for us and he could
[1:19:30] have looked upon us with uh potential
[1:19:33] and saw potential in our lives it's
[1:19:36] amazing when you go to thinking about
[1:19:38] what god has done for us in his mind
[1:19:41] before the foundation of the world he
[1:19:43] saw us as being what we are and i don't
[1:19:45] mean that god part but i mean this human
[1:19:47] part and yet it didn't stop him it
[1:19:49] didn't stumble him it didn't stagger him
[1:19:52] from going forth with all of the eternal
[1:19:54] plan of god to bring you and i to the
[1:19:56] position of where we are right here
[1:19:58] tonight and i i'm convinced brother
[1:20:00] sister that if god saw all of this down
[1:20:03] through the stream of time and he still
[1:20:05] carried on his great plan and still went
[1:20:07] forth with all of his desires i don't
[1:20:10] think anything we're going to do today
[1:20:11] or tomorrow or next week is going to
[1:20:13] stop him from loving us just the same as
[1:20:15] he loved us all the way back then as a
[1:20:17] matter of fact i believe he's a
[1:20:18] cheerleader for the bride he's pulling
[1:20:20] us on and egging us on and a great cloud
[1:20:23] of witnesses inclusive is standing
[1:20:25] around us to bring us into a greater
[1:20:28] revelation of who he is a deeper
[1:20:30] understanding of christ and his word and
[1:20:33] we know that all of these great things
[1:20:35] that we hear in the message of the last
[1:20:37] day they they are things that we feel
[1:20:40] privileged to hear i mean don't you
[1:20:42] think when you open up the message and
[1:20:44] you start reading some of these things
[1:20:45] from brother branham and then you look
[1:20:46] in the bible and see how they tied
[1:20:48] together don't you think to yourself how
[1:20:51] privileged i am to hear and see what god
[1:20:54] has done in this generation and yet to
[1:20:56] think of the multitudes around the world
[1:20:59] that will look maybe at the same bible
[1:21:01] and and maybe come in contact with
[1:21:03] brother brahms message and still it
[1:21:05] doesn't register with them the way that
[1:21:07] it registers with you and i and you look
[1:21:09] right here in this little church here
[1:21:11] this little tiny body of people and
[1:21:13] we're tiny compared to the joel osteen's
[1:21:15] of the world and the john hagees of the
[1:21:17] world and all of the great campaigns of
[1:21:20] of charismatic men and all this type of
[1:21:22] thing
[1:21:23] they they they've got thousands upon
[1:21:25] thousands upon thousands carrying their
[1:21:27] bibles to church and my standing there
[1:21:30] and hearing sermons and listening at
[1:21:32] things read from the bible but yet in
[1:21:34] all of their multitudes they'll never
[1:21:36] hear what god has privileged us right
[1:21:38] here in this little place to hear from
[1:21:40] almighty god we are a blessed people not
[1:21:43] just because god sent brother branham to
[1:21:45] the earth but because the lord himself
[1:21:49] took his word through that little
[1:21:51] prophet and began to manifest and
[1:21:53] express to us all that he had hiding in
[1:21:55] his mind what a privileged people we are
[1:21:58] and yet with all of our privileges and
[1:22:00] all of the graces that god has shown to
[1:22:02] us we are living in one of the most
[1:22:04] difficult times there is to live it
[1:22:06] doesn't get any more
[1:22:08] treacherous or any more deceptive or any
[1:22:11] more hard as far as with the hardships
[1:22:14] of life than the lady you'll see in
[1:22:15] church age and yet this is the age that
[1:22:18] god chose to reserve all of the
[1:22:20] unfoldings of his mystery and to this
[1:22:23] time of the hour we're living and you
[1:22:25] hear brother bannon say that if god
[1:22:27] could have asked him of any time he
[1:22:28] would have wanted to live he said i
[1:22:30] believe i would have chosen this age
[1:22:32] because he said this is the most
[1:22:34] glorious age out of them all
[1:22:36] amen and yet the most wicked out of all
[1:22:38] of them i mean you think about that a
[1:22:39] moment friend and god looking down to
[1:22:42] the stream of time he saw all of the
[1:22:44] confusion he saw all of the churchianity
[1:22:47] he saw all of the nonsense he saw all of
[1:22:49] the make-believers and the was nots and
[1:22:51] the holy touch me nod said he saw saints
[1:22:54] down through that stream of time and yet
[1:22:56] somehow god chose in his mind this hour
[1:22:59] amen to manifest the promise of his word
[1:23:03] that he would not only restore
[1:23:05] everything that had been taken down
[1:23:07] through them dark ages but it would
[1:23:09] unfold the very mystery of himself right
[1:23:12] down here on this last time oh my it's a
[1:23:14] powerful thing and we understand the
[1:23:16] hour we're living in is the finishing of
[1:23:19] the mystery of god amen all of it's
[1:23:21] supposed to be completed as we go out of
[1:23:24] here in a rapture resurrection there
[1:23:26] should be no question for you and i and
[1:23:28] why did god choose all of these
[1:23:30] attributes and all of these little isms
[1:23:33] and ups and downs to culminate and come
[1:23:36] together in their finality here in this
[1:23:38] age because this is the age that god
[1:23:40] knew the bride would need more hope than
[1:23:43] any other age and she would need a hope
[1:23:45] that would be resting beyond the veil
[1:23:48] and beyond this flesh veil she'd have to
[1:23:50] have a hope inside of her heart by the
[1:23:52] baptism of the holy ghost amen and god
[1:23:54] wanted to secure god wanted to establish
[1:23:58] his word for the bride that in a day of
[1:24:00] just of religious deception in a time of
[1:24:03] deception when everybody goes to church
[1:24:05] and everybody believes in god he wanted
[1:24:08] you and i to have a hope that was beyond
[1:24:10] church entity
[1:24:12] that was beyond just religion and coming
[1:24:15] to church and occupying a pew he'd want
[1:24:17] us to have a hope that if every bible
[1:24:20] was destroyed tonight we would still
[1:24:22] know what thus saith the lord is
[1:24:24] amen if we never got another tape or
[1:24:26] never was able to push play again in our
[1:24:28] life yet we have a hope here tonight
[1:24:30] brother bob we have a whole payment of
[1:24:32] what lays beyond us as the people of god
[1:24:35] now this is wonderful how paul begins to
[1:24:38] open this up now i want to take you on a
[1:24:40] small little journey back into this time
[1:24:42] period in this first century when paul
[1:24:44] begins dealing with this and i want to
[1:24:46] just take your minds for a moment into
[1:24:48] what some of the people sitting there in
[1:24:51] the church maybe you think of in a way
[1:24:52] of preaching like here tonight if paul
[1:24:55] was to stand up and say
[1:24:56] church i've got a new revelation from
[1:24:58] god i want to share with you and maybe
[1:25:00] the apostle would start reading this
[1:25:02] text to the bible or something and then
[1:25:04] he would come to these words this we say
[1:25:06] by the word of the lord now i i hope you
[1:25:09] understand that what paul is bringing
[1:25:11] here in this fourth chapter of
[1:25:13] thessalonians is things that has never
[1:25:15] been heard before
[1:25:16] it has never been identified at any time
[1:25:19] down through the old testament moses and
[1:25:22] naham and habakkuk and micah and ezekiel
[1:25:25] jeremiah none of these prophets have
[1:25:27] dealt with this rapture resurrection in
[1:25:30] the way that paul is getting ready to
[1:25:32] deal with it it's quite a statement he
[1:25:33] makes here and really solidify for us as
[1:25:37] the people of god what it is that he's
[1:25:39] getting ready to tell us he uses these
[1:25:41] words in verse 15 for this we say unto
[1:25:45] you by the word of the lord amen he
[1:25:48] wanted the people to know this is not
[1:25:50] paul this is not my idea this is not my
[1:25:53] thoughts or what i'm about to tell you
[1:25:55] but this is thus saith the lord this we
[1:25:58] say unto you by the word of the lord now
[1:26:01] you realize when paul is beginning to
[1:26:03] establish this this doctrine of the
[1:26:05] second coming of the lord jesus he's
[1:26:08] taking a mixture of different scriptures
[1:26:11] and thoughts down through the old
[1:26:12] testament he's going back into things
[1:26:14] that moses would say into things that
[1:26:17] the lord jesus himself would say that if
[1:26:19] i go away i will prepare a place for you
[1:26:22] and bring you again quickly now now we
[1:26:24] know that most of the old testament the
[1:26:26] majority of it is upon the first coming
[1:26:29] of the lord jesus christ we know that to
[1:26:31] be right and we know that whenever jesus
[1:26:34] first arrived on the scene
[1:26:36] that many of the pharisees sadducees
[1:26:38] essenes herodians all these different
[1:26:40] groups of people were looking by the old
[1:26:42] testament for the coming of the messiah
[1:26:45] and we know what brother benham told us
[1:26:46] that whenever they they they set their
[1:26:48] foundation of how he was going to come
[1:26:50] up it would be something to the effect
[1:26:52] of maybe that he would appear to
[1:26:54] caiaphasis and he would say hey here i
[1:26:56] am i'm the great messiah he would come
[1:26:58] with an angel
[1:26:59] band he would come with great glory
[1:27:02] shining out of heaven but when he showed
[1:27:04] up he came in a manure pile and many of
[1:27:07] them missed him all together 100
[1:27:10] who jesus really was think of it them
[1:27:13] smart educated men in the message of
[1:27:15] that hour and yet looking at the
[1:27:17] fulfillment of everything they studied
[1:27:20] and still they were blinded and could
[1:27:21] not see who he was
[1:27:23] it was quite an hour and all of the
[1:27:26] scriptures in the old testament had
[1:27:28] pointed to this very moment and john was
[1:27:30] the man that was gathering up all of
[1:27:32] that divine energy and he was pointing
[1:27:34] to this messiah in the river this is the
[1:27:36] one of i spoke to you that was whose
[1:27:39] shoes i'm not worthy to even lace up
[1:27:42] this man is the one that the anointing
[1:27:44] had pulled to the prophet of god said
[1:27:46] john saw the holy spirit descend upon
[1:27:49] the lord jesus as the dove would lay
[1:27:51] upon the lamb he said he identified who
[1:27:54] jesus was even by the way of flesh or by
[1:27:57] natural looking amen they were cousins
[1:27:59] long-distance cousin if you understand
[1:28:01] the word long distance amen amen they
[1:28:04] were they were family in a lot of ways
[1:28:06] no doubt john was associated with jesus
[1:28:08] in certain ways but when he saw the
[1:28:10] pillar of fire rest upon the lamb of god
[1:28:13] he had scriptural identity of who he was
[1:28:17] and them sadducees standing on the on
[1:28:19] the riverbank still could not see who
[1:28:21] this man really was
[1:28:23] he points to the rocks and said if these
[1:28:25] hold their peace these stones will cry
[1:28:27] out
[1:28:28] in other words what's the matter with
[1:28:29] you bunch of men
[1:28:31] don't you see what's going on around you
[1:28:33] you know it's a strange thing how that
[1:28:35] god can perform great things right in
[1:28:37] front of people's eyes and yet they're
[1:28:39] so blinded to it they still can't see
[1:28:40] what's happening amen amen it's amazing
[1:28:43] to me i see people that even in this day
[1:28:46] we're living in they study the message
[1:28:48] all of their life they're in and out of
[1:28:50] message churches all of their life
[1:28:52] and yet just the other day on facebook
[1:28:54] there's a man i've known him for many
[1:28:56] many years publicly declares he believed
[1:28:57] brother bam was an antichrist and the
[1:28:59] message false doctrine i think and here
[1:29:01] he is a preacher and that's not just the
[1:29:04] one but i i know 10 or 12 more in my my
[1:29:07] last four or five years of traveling men
[1:29:09] i'd preach for men that i shook their
[1:29:11] hand hugged their neck and yet now
[1:29:13] they're on the other side of the fence
[1:29:15] oh brother bam's message is a bunch of
[1:29:16] hogwash and nonsense and you think to
[1:29:19] yourself how can people look right at
[1:29:21] the message and look right at the
[1:29:23] manifestation of christ in this last day
[1:29:25] and not see who was inside that humble
[1:29:28] little prophet well you see god has an
[1:29:31] answer for them things
[1:29:32] and the answer is if you're not called
[1:29:34] to it something will shake you out of it
[1:29:37] amen and only the bride will have a hope
[1:29:40] before she goes out of this world of
[1:29:42] what this message is all about
[1:29:45] amen sister lily and i did an interview
[1:29:46] last year and my god the devil's come
[1:29:48] out of the woodwork after we did this
[1:29:50] interview
[1:29:51] i i've been like a long-tailed cat in a
[1:29:53] room full of rocking chairs i've i have
[1:29:55] i have bombarded lily to death we've got
[1:29:57] to change this got to fix that got to
[1:29:59] say this different why because people
[1:30:01] are so blinded to where we're at they're
[1:30:04] so critical of the hour that we're
[1:30:06] living in and friends the truth is
[1:30:08] laying right there before their eyes
[1:30:10] many times and they don't want to accept
[1:30:12] it you'd be surprised sister lily how
[1:30:14] many sisters have come to me after the
[1:30:15] interview about women being
[1:30:17] underestimated i had a woman grip my
[1:30:19] hands the other day with tears in her
[1:30:21] eyes and said i was delivered by the
[1:30:23] holy ghost of a dominating spirit after
[1:30:26] i heard that interview she said it's
[1:30:28] true men bully women in the message and
[1:30:30] they believe that that's exactly what
[1:30:32] they do they bully this and bully that
[1:30:34] and ramrod this and ramrod that what is
[1:30:37] it it's the devil in the last day trying
[1:30:40] to take hope out of everybody that names
[1:30:43] the name of jesus christ amen but we as
[1:30:45] the bride of christ tonight we have a
[1:30:48] hope that lays within this truth
[1:30:50] amen the mysteries are being revealed
[1:30:52] i'm getting to that in just a moment but
[1:30:53] i'm going to take my time on this long
[1:30:55] runway i got a big plane to get up here
[1:30:57] friends
[1:30:57] amen that's right i don't want to hurry
[1:31:00] these things along we got all wicked
[1:31:01] anyhow praise the lord that's right now
[1:31:04] watch this we say by the word of the
[1:31:06] lord and you realize friends that when
[1:31:08] paul is introducing these ideas to these
[1:31:10] people it is something so different from
[1:31:14] what they have always heard that they
[1:31:15] don't understand maybe even where paul
[1:31:17] is coming from peter himself said you
[1:31:20] know paul says some things we just don't
[1:31:22] understand it
[1:31:23] hear peter walk with jesus talk with
[1:31:25] jesus fish with jesus hunted with jesus
[1:31:27] preach with jesus in and out of
[1:31:29] campaigns with the lord jesus and yet
[1:31:31] here paul is introducing a concept that
[1:31:33] i mean even the disciples were probably
[1:31:35] scratching their head what in the world
[1:31:37] is he talking about
[1:31:39] but god was going to reveal to this man
[1:31:41] oh i love this he was going to reveal to
[1:31:43] this man
[1:31:45] the the structure if you will in which
[1:31:48] jesus will return to the bride in the
[1:31:50] last day
[1:31:51] now you realize this man is preaching to
[1:31:54] old testament people
[1:31:56] taste not touch not handle not
[1:31:59] all they've ever known their entire
[1:32:01] existence is if you do god will bless
[1:32:04] you if you don't he'll send you to hell
[1:32:06] and now this man is preaching on the
[1:32:08] second coming of the lord jesus well
[1:32:10] isn't it good enough just to quote the
[1:32:11] words of jesus if i go away i'll come
[1:32:14] again isn't that good enough no
[1:32:16] it had to be deeper than that
[1:32:18] there had to be something more for the
[1:32:20] people of god because paul maybe not
[1:32:22] realizing himself this text of scripture
[1:32:25] is going to be read for 2 000 years
[1:32:27] after his departure
[1:32:29] and he's going to go through a time of
[1:32:31] dark ages and you realize these people
[1:32:34] that was
[1:32:35] fed the lions and sawn asunder and on
[1:32:37] and on and on you realize even the bible
[1:32:39] had been taken away from many of these
[1:32:42] men and women that they would have no
[1:32:44] understanding until that seed began
[1:32:47] restoration work under martin luther and
[1:32:49] it started coming back up through them
[1:32:51] ages there was no hope laying out there
[1:32:54] before the people of god but god said i
[1:32:57] won't leave him in the dark ages i'm
[1:32:59] going to restore my truth so that
[1:33:01] there'll be a hope for the people of god
[1:33:04] brother brahm said god watched over his
[1:33:06] word do you believe that
[1:33:08] he watched over this bible somebody said
[1:33:10] to me the other day it's the words of a
[1:33:12] man i said i'm glad you got that now
[1:33:13] let's get the other side of the coin i
[1:33:15] said it was god speaking through a man
[1:33:17] amen amen it was the words of men men
[1:33:20] pinned these things down men use english
[1:33:22] men use arabic ever what it was but it
[1:33:25] was god's voice god's mouth speaking
[1:33:27] through those men as they penned the
[1:33:29] words down there amen don't forget man
[1:33:32] is god's agent
[1:33:34] that makes me feel happy for it
[1:33:37] man is god's microphone he's the one god
[1:33:40] talks through
[1:33:41] oh somebody said well i can just listen
[1:33:43] to a tape and push play and that's all
[1:33:44] but god uses man not mechanical devices
[1:33:48] amen you got microphones here you got
[1:33:50] little screens to watch scriptures and
[1:33:52] songs and you got
[1:33:54] electrical equipment all over this
[1:33:55] building hey it's used for the glory of
[1:33:57] god but that's not man's god's agent man
[1:34:01] is god's agent the microphone just helps
[1:34:04] man get his song over
[1:34:06] amen or get his sermon out it's only an
[1:34:08] a the tape recorder only helps get the
[1:34:10] voice out the cd player and the radio
[1:34:13] only helps get the voice out but god has
[1:34:16] always used man that's always been his
[1:34:18] plan
[1:34:19] and listen he'll never stop doing that i
[1:34:21] don't care where he's at or who his name
[1:34:22] is or what part of the world it's in god
[1:34:25] will always use man i know sometimes it
[1:34:27] looks very bleak it looks very dark and
[1:34:29] you wonder where in the world is the
[1:34:31] next one going to come from that's
[1:34:32] really got real revelation and all that
[1:34:34] but listen god's got people somewhere
[1:34:36] we may not know where they're at but
[1:34:38] god's got men somewhere that are
[1:34:40] anointed by the pillar of fire to preach
[1:34:42] thus saith the lord because i hear
[1:34:44] brother batman say this bride will have
[1:34:46] thus saith the lord or shall hold still
[1:34:48] so somewhere she's got to get it
[1:34:51] amen maybe not over in these cold parts
[1:34:53] of the world where we've our revival
[1:34:55] fires are almost went completely out
[1:34:57] until they're nothing but a bunch of
[1:34:58] smoldering ashes amen over here in the
[1:35:00] in north america where it seemed like
[1:35:02] that you have to almost
[1:35:04] work everybody into a frenzy just to get
[1:35:06] five minutes revival out of them
[1:35:08] i mean they ain't hardly uh
[1:35:10] enough enthusiasm to want a musket
[1:35:12] shotgun come on somebody
[1:35:14] hey man they're just they're just
[1:35:15] dwindling out but god's got somebody if
[1:35:17] he's got to go to the pygmies in africa
[1:35:19] and raise him up a pygmy he'll preach
[1:35:21] thus saith the lord if he's got to go to
[1:35:23] alaska to the eskimos there'll be an
[1:35:25] eskimo somewhere that'll have thus saith
[1:35:27] the lord the message has got to live on
[1:35:29] somehow god will make a way for the
[1:35:31] bride
[1:35:32] amen the prophet of god said satan
[1:35:34] thought he squashed out that group in
[1:35:36] the dark ages he said but what he didn't
[1:35:38] realize is that the going down of the
[1:35:40] seed this is seed not earth to shove the
[1:35:42] going down of the seed he said brought
[1:35:44] the restoration of the entire thing amen
[1:35:47] amen because once it would come through
[1:35:49] luther and the life would go into wesley
[1:35:51] and then travel to pentecost and then
[1:35:53] come out on the last day through the
[1:35:54] shock and to the seed it would be the
[1:35:56] finishing of all the mysteries of god
[1:35:59] and the completing of the works of god
[1:36:01] in the last day
[1:36:03] amen so paul bringing it in this we say
[1:36:05] to you by the word of the lord he wanted
[1:36:07] to give the people hope
[1:36:09] because at this time taste not touched
[1:36:11] not handle not all they had by the mark
[1:36:13] was the idea if i live right i'll make
[1:36:15] it
[1:36:16] if i don't i ain't gonna make it
[1:36:18] do you know there's a little bit
[1:36:19] different side to that in this day and
[1:36:21] age
[1:36:22] i know that a lot of people think well
[1:36:23] it's my living right it's going to get
[1:36:25] me into heaven do you realize that ain't
[1:36:26] even in the bible much less the message
[1:36:29] now i don't say that a christian won't
[1:36:30] live right oh no don't you go out here
[1:36:32] saying i believe that no i believe
[1:36:33] you're a christian you'll live right but
[1:36:35] your living right don't get you to
[1:36:36] heaven
[1:36:38] if your living right could get you to
[1:36:39] heaven that makes you your own redeemer
[1:36:41] and your own savior
[1:36:42] [Applause]
[1:36:43] if you could do anything at all to bring
[1:36:46] yourself into a holy state of god then
[1:36:49] you are your own private redeemer god i
[1:36:52] wish somebody helped me preach right now
[1:36:54] praise the lord somebody we're not our
[1:36:56] own personal savior i cannot be my own
[1:36:59] private redeemer come on now it took
[1:37:01] christ to save me
[1:37:03] and hear these in the old testament all
[1:37:05] they had was their works moses said do
[1:37:08] it moses said don't do it moses said do
[1:37:10] this moses said don't do that you break
[1:37:13] that word and you'll be stoned without
[1:37:15] it without any mercy or any grace stone
[1:37:18] taken out of the camp and stoned in
[1:37:20] front of witnesses that you broke that
[1:37:22] word
[1:37:23] until of course when jesus comes along
[1:37:25] and he realizes that they're not only
[1:37:27] manipulating the word to fit their own
[1:37:29] means
[1:37:30] but they were they were doing a whole
[1:37:31] lot of things that moses said not to do
[1:37:34] although they were not they wasn't
[1:37:35] letting people know it themselves
[1:37:37] remember when the woman got caught in
[1:37:38] adultery where was the man at
[1:37:41] because excuse this expression but last
[1:37:43] i heard it takes two to tango
[1:37:47] forgive me
[1:37:49] but it's the truth
[1:37:50] they caught her and if they caught her
[1:37:52] in the act of adultery she wasn't there
[1:37:54] with herself
[1:37:55] she was there with somebody
[1:37:57] hallelujah somebody
[1:38:00] she was there with somebody where was he
[1:38:02] at when they brought him up you see it
[1:38:03] might have been one of their fellow
[1:38:04] pharisees
[1:38:06] might have been some great member in
[1:38:08] society that paid him a lot of money
[1:38:09] underneath the table don't you see how
[1:38:11] deceiving the devil can be and all of
[1:38:14] that was supposed to be in the auspices
[1:38:16] of the message
[1:38:17] hey i imagine if he was in the message
[1:38:19] day that day you'd start pointing out
[1:38:20] all the little flaws and all the little
[1:38:22] problems and all that too because why
[1:38:25] man has always been the same it doesn't
[1:38:27] matter if it was pre facebook or post
[1:38:29] facebook man has always been man
[1:38:33] he'll always do the things that he's
[1:38:34] done especially if he's got evil in his
[1:38:36] heart
[1:38:37] come on somebody preach to me
[1:38:39] he'll always do the things that's
[1:38:41] contrary to the word of god until he's
[1:38:43] born again amen
[1:38:45] amen and then if he does something
[1:38:46] contrary the holy ghost will make him
[1:38:48] straighten up
[1:38:49] that's right that's what the bible said
[1:38:51] all of this time man would go down to
[1:38:54] the grave without a hope
[1:38:56] if i live by the word if i live the best
[1:38:59] of my knowledge and my ability christ
[1:39:01] will have mercy on me you understand
[1:39:04] even in the first general resurrection
[1:39:06] of them old testament saints they had to
[1:39:08] be buried geographically in a certain
[1:39:10] spot in order for them to even receive
[1:39:12] receive resurrection
[1:39:14] that's why joseph said don't leave my
[1:39:16] bones in egypt bring me out of egypt and
[1:39:18] put me over there in the promised land
[1:39:20] all of those that geographically was
[1:39:22] outside of this little spot it was the
[1:39:24] spot there where abraham and the cave of
[1:39:27] mack pilar you remember the story or
[1:39:29] buys it so much of a price and there is
[1:39:31] where that god was going to use that
[1:39:32] little piece of ground to bring forth
[1:39:34] the general resurrection and in that
[1:39:36] that specific time period that was the
[1:39:39] only hope they had live by the sacrifice
[1:39:42] live by the light of the candlesticks
[1:39:44] live by the show breath and when the
[1:39:45] smoke would enter up and the pre or the
[1:39:48] would enter up into heaven rather than
[1:39:49] the priests would look out there on the
[1:39:51] people and say god has received our
[1:39:54] sacrifice that's the only hope they had
[1:39:56] they had no personal hope themselves
[1:39:58] they were just playing guesswork that
[1:40:00] they they were they were close enough
[1:40:02] that god might accept them down the road
[1:40:05] amen no wonder the israelites probably
[1:40:07] got frustrated after a period of time
[1:40:10] all right listen to me
[1:40:12] god never desired
[1:40:14] for them to have the law
[1:40:17] did you know that
[1:40:18] it wasn't god that wanted them to have
[1:40:20] the law man wanted the law
[1:40:23] amen about the same way today
[1:40:25] that's the way people are they want to
[1:40:27] make their own laws their own rules
[1:40:28] their own regulations and they want you
[1:40:30] to live by their measuring sticks and
[1:40:32] what they say and what they don't say
[1:40:34] the same guy is preaching against
[1:40:35] facebook are the same ones preaching
[1:40:36] against the telephone
[1:40:38] same one preaching against the telephone
[1:40:40] was probably preaching against the
[1:40:41] carrier pigeon at one time come on
[1:40:42] somebody
[1:40:43] hey come on now man is always man he has
[1:40:46] always tried to make holiness of his own
[1:40:49] self but again if he can be his own
[1:40:52] savior if it can be his own redeemer god
[1:40:55] will accept your works and my works but
[1:40:57] that's the thing god didn't look at me
[1:40:59] in you and say okay bob you're 80 good
[1:41:01] 20 bad come on i can use you
[1:41:04] he didn't look over here and say all
[1:41:05] right paul
[1:41:07] 70 30 boy
[1:41:10] we've got a little work to do with you
[1:41:12] [Laughter]
[1:41:16] god didn't look at that and say all
[1:41:18] right so much good so much bad when he
[1:41:20] looked at us he realized we were a
[1:41:22] hundred percent bad
[1:41:24] [Music]
[1:41:25] that's what the bible said there was no
[1:41:27] good works in any of us that we could
[1:41:28] boast in any way we were a hundred
[1:41:31] percent bad that's why we needed a
[1:41:33] savior
[1:41:35] come on now that's exactly right all but
[1:41:37] you say brother being i'm a good person
[1:41:39] goodness don't make it the spirit of
[1:41:40] god's what makes it amen does no matter
[1:41:42] how good you are or how much good you
[1:41:44] might think think in your mind you might
[1:41:46] be you're not even close to what them
[1:41:48] israelites was back in their time
[1:41:51] because i guarantee they lived a whole
[1:41:52] much stricter standard than what you and
[1:41:54] i do
[1:41:55] or unless you checked i imagine you
[1:41:57] haven't looked at the tag in your
[1:41:58] clothes in a long time but you got a
[1:42:00] little mixture of clothing in there
[1:42:02] you don't wear 100 wool or whatever it
[1:42:04] might be you got a little polyester here
[1:42:06] and a little this here and a little that
[1:42:08] there how many of you all like pork i
[1:42:09] shouldn't even ask that question that's
[1:42:11] 100 amen
[1:42:13] i don't think there's any vegetarian
[1:42:15] job got both hands in the air he said
[1:42:17] hallelujah glory to god amen
[1:42:20] amen
[1:42:21] i don't know i've ever seen you shout as
[1:42:23] loud as that right terrible
[1:42:26] amen
[1:42:27] amen amen but but us we we don't live by
[1:42:30] the dietary laws and we don't live by
[1:42:32] the structures and the standard that
[1:42:34] they live by and when a man would die he
[1:42:37] had his only confidence in a god that he
[1:42:39] didn't even know was even really
[1:42:40] listening to him sometimes
[1:42:43] he had faith sure he did but read the
[1:42:45] bible read how many of them prophets
[1:42:47] would get underneath
[1:42:48] underneath a juniper tree
[1:42:50] we've all been there but listen these
[1:42:52] people lived in a different manner than
[1:42:54] what you and i live they lived on a
[1:42:56] standard that they didn't have the close
[1:42:58] relationship with god that you and i
[1:43:00] have got right here today
[1:43:02] sure them prophets they would go into a
[1:43:03] presence of god and god would talk to
[1:43:05] them sure i know that but look at them
[1:43:07] after they got out underneath the
[1:43:08] anointing but it ain't that way with you
[1:43:10] and i
[1:43:11] because even when we're out from
[1:43:13] underneath the anointing the holy spirit
[1:43:14] still deals with your heart still
[1:43:16] blesses you and still does great things
[1:43:18] in your life
[1:43:20] amen we may have our juniper trees but
[1:43:22] there's a blessing that comes with the
[1:43:24] infilling of the holy ghost what are you
[1:43:26] trying to say brother ben we've got hope
[1:43:27] amen
[1:43:29] we've got a hope that the world knows
[1:43:31] nothing about
[1:43:32] and it's a hope that will keep on going
[1:43:35] even after i lose hope when i get
[1:43:37] hopeless that hope will still go
[1:43:39] because it's from god now notice again
[1:43:42] paul's saying that all of this is the
[1:43:45] word of the lord unto you now watch him
[1:43:47] as he comes into this second coming of
[1:43:49] the lord now let me let me read this
[1:43:51] just a little bit before we get into
[1:43:53] verse 16. and the message out thy word
[1:43:55] lord don't think of money don't think of
[1:43:57] homes and land think of christ who is
[1:44:00] coming
[1:44:01] there's nobody can put hopes in anything
[1:44:04] else but christ now that's right
[1:44:06] everything our whole future is on the
[1:44:09] coming of the lord he said that's right
[1:44:11] that's the hope of those who are asleep
[1:44:14] and of we who are alive now you realize
[1:44:18] that when brother branham frames
[1:44:19] together the words of the hope of the
[1:44:22] church he always and every place talking
[1:44:24] about the hope of the bride the hope of
[1:44:25] the church is that is the coming of the
[1:44:28] lord jesus there is no one in any one
[1:44:31] place any political realm any economical
[1:44:34] realm that we can put our trust or our
[1:44:36] confidence in the devil controls this
[1:44:39] entire world and brother sister there is
[1:44:42] nothing that we can put our confidence
[1:44:44] in
[1:44:45] hey bad dictators and bad prime
[1:44:47] ministers and bad this and bad
[1:44:49] presidents and what more they're going
[1:44:50] to come along whether we like it or not
[1:44:53] it doesn't matter the devil rules this
[1:44:54] world
[1:44:55] we're not putting our confidence in
[1:44:57] trump
[1:44:59] or trudeau or any other
[1:45:01] dog rey me or whoever
[1:45:05] forgive me or anybody else we're not
[1:45:07] putting our confidence in none of that
[1:45:09] our confidence is in the lord jesus
[1:45:11] christ
[1:45:12] and notice when paul is introducing the
[1:45:15] hope to the church what does he say the
[1:45:17] lord himself shall descend from heaven
[1:45:20] with a shout so this is not a prophet we
[1:45:23] got confidence in not an apostle we got
[1:45:26] confidence in but the lord
[1:45:28] himself oh friends you understand this
[1:45:31] is the only hope that we've got right
[1:45:33] here tonight
[1:45:34] we were talking about it this this
[1:45:35] morning this afternoon
[1:45:37] uh this kate spade and and anthony
[1:45:39] bourdain great chef i mean all kinds of
[1:45:42] money rolling in left and right kate
[1:45:44] spade's got them little handbags you
[1:45:46] sisters like
[1:45:48] here the woman
[1:45:49] on her on her deathbed almost we'd say
[1:45:52] she's a
[1:45:53] multi-multi-multi-millionaire and so was
[1:45:54] anthony bourdain both of them commit
[1:45:56] suicide just a few days within each
[1:45:58] other and we were talking about it today
[1:46:00] brother bob made this remark to me and
[1:46:02] he didn't realize i was getting ready to
[1:46:03] preach on this tonight but i almost done
[1:46:05] a jig right there amen
[1:46:07] amen but the remark was like this the
[1:46:09] reason people do it is because they just
[1:46:11] don't have any hope anymore i thought
[1:46:13] that's exactly right because you can't
[1:46:15] put confidence in a million dollars in a
[1:46:17] bank account you can't put confidence in
[1:46:19] a successful business you can't put
[1:46:21] confidence in none of that let one bad
[1:46:23] facebook report come back and your
[1:46:25] business is gone
[1:46:27] hey come on somebody let one thief get a
[1:46:29] hold of your bank account and you're
[1:46:31] busted
[1:46:32] amen nothing we can hope in but one hope
[1:46:35] that's jesus christ
[1:46:37] that's right so don't think of money
[1:46:40] don't think of homes and land oh i tell
[1:46:42] you if i could get this certain certain
[1:46:44] certain thing if i could climb to the
[1:46:46] pinnacle to the ladders of success you
[1:46:48] can do every bit of that and still wind
[1:46:50] up a miserable popper by the end of the
[1:46:52] day spiritually i mean you could be a
[1:46:54] multi-billionaire without christ you
[1:46:56] have absolutely nothing amen amen i wish
[1:46:59] somebody helped me preach right now
[1:47:01] amen amen amen amen that's right because
[1:47:04] with christ amen we have all the hope in
[1:47:07] the world glory
[1:47:08] oh yes sir nothing we can fear for
[1:47:11] christ who is tomorrow is in tomorrow
[1:47:14] before tomorrow arrives
[1:47:18] amen we can put our confidence in god
[1:47:21] because he is there before tomorrow
[1:47:23] arrives
[1:47:26] oh my thank you jesus
[1:47:28] now notice this how that in verse 16
[1:47:31] paul says the lord himself shall descend
[1:47:34] from heaven with a shout now we know
[1:47:35] what a shout is a shout is a message
[1:47:38] amen
[1:47:39] we know that when the old testament
[1:47:41] speaks about shouting
[1:47:44] tells the people in jericho shout blow
[1:47:46] your trumpets and all these different
[1:47:47] types of things it's a message and paul
[1:47:50] identifies that at the trumpet gives an
[1:47:52] uncertain sound you know the scriptures
[1:47:54] and height talks about the voice has to
[1:47:56] be plain
[1:47:58] in order to prepare yourself for what
[1:48:00] the next steps in life may be i'll just
[1:48:02] say it that way or what the next stage
[1:48:04] of your walk might be you have to know
[1:48:06] how to prepare yourself now here we are
[1:48:09] in the ladies and age
[1:48:10] and there's 900 and some different
[1:48:12] denominations while elijah's on the
[1:48:14] earth a friend of mine told me the other
[1:48:16] day said brother ben have you looked at
[1:48:17] that registry lately i said no sir he
[1:48:19] said let's just say it this way it's
[1:48:21] went from 900 to 90 000. he said there's
[1:48:24] so many denominations and organizations
[1:48:26] in the world he said it's hard to keep
[1:48:28] up with them and a lot of them they're
[1:48:30] made of as splinters of another church
[1:48:32] of a church of a church of church hey
[1:48:34] friends listen message churches aren't
[1:48:35] the only ones that has church blitz
[1:48:38] amen man has been split in church since
[1:48:40] cain and abel got into it in the garden
[1:48:41] of eden
[1:48:43] come on somebody
[1:48:44] amen and that's something that's a
[1:48:46] normal part of everything that goes on
[1:48:48] with churches because people you get one
[1:48:50] man he's got an idea get another man
[1:48:52] he's got an idea and one always thinks
[1:48:54] his idea is better than the other one
[1:48:56] and there's always some sheeple that
[1:48:58] always go along with it amen
[1:49:00] amen come on somebody amen they always
[1:49:02] go right along with the thing yes that's
[1:49:04] exactly what it needs to be i agree with
[1:49:07] you brother all that guy over he don't
[1:49:08] know what he's talking about but you
[1:49:10] you've got the message now we know that
[1:49:12] when the lord himself is descending with
[1:49:15] a shout we know this did not take place
[1:49:17] in 1962 1956 1948 but this took place at
[1:49:22] the opening of the seven seals when the
[1:49:25] lord himself appeared in arizona
[1:49:29] amen this is where god came down in a
[1:49:32] visible image before the entire world
[1:49:34] that they could see that the mystery was
[1:49:36] getting ready to be finished
[1:49:39] now we know that when the shout comes
[1:49:41] you could say it in this manner that if
[1:49:43] i stood up here tonight and i just i
[1:49:45] just shout and say hey well everybody
[1:49:47] would just look well what the world's he
[1:49:49] talking about you still wouldn't
[1:49:50] understand it but maybe if i do it this
[1:49:53] way what if i'd come down here instead
[1:49:55] of shouting just in general what if i
[1:49:57] looked over and said hey carson
[1:49:59] well now there's a message in that
[1:50:02] and that shout's calling somebody's name
[1:50:04] getting their attention
[1:50:05] brother branham said when them seven
[1:50:07] seals came open the mighty angel took
[1:50:09] the book of god which was the book of
[1:50:11] redemption he said that book of
[1:50:13] redemption was sealed with seven seals
[1:50:15] man's potential god's potential and
[1:50:18] everything that we would ever be was
[1:50:19] sealed inside of that book
[1:50:21] that's the reason when john saw it and
[1:50:23] saw it was still sealed up and nobody
[1:50:25] was worthy to take it everything in the
[1:50:27] earth heard him crying and screaming and
[1:50:29] weeping before god oh god and john was
[1:50:32] looked at all the prophets was looked at
[1:50:34] nobody was found worthy to take that
[1:50:36] book until the lion prevailed to take
[1:50:39] his own book
[1:50:40] just like paul said the lord himself
[1:50:44] all these different denominations and
[1:50:46] organizations it was a bunch of noise
[1:50:48] there was shouting going around
[1:50:49] everybody but nobody understood the
[1:50:51] message
[1:50:52] didn't know how many gods they believed
[1:50:54] in that no matter how to baptize didn't
[1:50:55] understand what holiness supposed to
[1:50:57] look like the churches certainly wasn't
[1:50:59] in order
[1:51:00] amen i told somebody the other day they
[1:51:02] said i got a problem with tongues
[1:51:04] interpretations and prophecies that
[1:51:06] people do use them wrong i said they may
[1:51:08] do it but we've got a standard in this
[1:51:09] message we've got two tables of stone
[1:51:12] like moses called conduct order and
[1:51:14] doctrine that tells us how to put it in
[1:51:15] this place
[1:51:17] that's our two tablets of stone and last
[1:51:19] day the cod book lets us know i said as
[1:51:22] believers in the last day that ain't
[1:51:23] nobody could speak in tongues interpret
[1:51:25] or prophesy incorrectly but what we
[1:51:28] couldn't pull the book on them
[1:51:30] come on somebody we've got a message
[1:51:32] laying there that tells us what the
[1:51:34] right is
[1:51:36] we don't have to play guesswork with it
[1:51:38] amen if you want to know if it's right
[1:51:39] just go look in the tablets of stone
[1:51:41] there see what see what our moses said
[1:51:43] about it
[1:51:44] thou shalt not do it while the preacher
[1:51:45] is preaching and so forth like that amen
[1:51:48] it doesn't mean you can't get blessed
[1:51:49] and speak in an online language while
[1:51:51] i'm preaching but don't you interrupt me
[1:51:52] because you're out of order
[1:51:54] if i have to wait on you you're out of
[1:51:56] order amen if i got to wait on you that
[1:51:58] ain't no problem amen
[1:51:59] amen if you've got to wait on me rather
[1:52:01] that ain't no problem you just let me
[1:52:02] keep on preaching
[1:52:04] right i'm the one under the anointing up
[1:52:06] here i'm the one that's got the voice of
[1:52:08] god for the message tonight is that what
[1:52:10] he said he said don't you interrupt with
[1:52:12] prophecy or these type of things we have
[1:52:14] a message that made it plain to us what
[1:52:16] it's supposed to look like and how it's
[1:52:19] supposed to be in order come on now
[1:52:21] there's no confusion in these things
[1:52:23] we've got the books and the tapes
[1:52:26] amen and amen and amen
[1:52:29] amen that's exactly right and here we're
[1:52:31] standing in the last day when that
[1:52:33] seventh seal had to be broken for the
[1:52:36] people of god so that christ himself
[1:52:39] could unfold all that he was hiding
[1:52:41] underneath that seven seal mystery so
[1:52:44] the lion remember the prophet of god
[1:52:46] said and in the bible there in
[1:52:47] revelation 10 when he comes the lion
[1:52:49] roars remember that brother baby said
[1:52:52] when the lion roars he said it's because
[1:52:54] there's a lot of chatter going on in the
[1:52:55] jungle
[1:52:57] everybody's got a voice
[1:52:59] everybody's got something to say
[1:53:02] when he roars seven thunders utter their
[1:53:04] voices
[1:53:05] oh god you're getting scared to death
[1:53:06] but i'm gonna solve this seven thunder
[1:53:08] thing in 30 seconds don't get nervous
[1:53:10] amen amen people take seven years to try
[1:53:12] to explain it with seven different men
[1:53:14] in seven different parts of the world
[1:53:16] i'm going to solve it for you in 30
[1:53:17] seconds
[1:53:18] the mystery of god was contained all
[1:53:21] down through the bible you believe that
[1:53:23] genesis to revelation held the mystery
[1:53:25] of god
[1:53:26] everybody had their interpretation of
[1:53:28] what that scripture was supposed to say
[1:53:31] including martin luther
[1:53:33] martin luther took his message that just
[1:53:34] shall live by faith he preached the just
[1:53:37] shall live by faith and when he preached
[1:53:39] the just shall live by faith he got it
[1:53:41] right out of the same bible that the
[1:53:42] catholics got their doctrines out of
[1:53:45] amen and he had his own interpretation
[1:53:47] to what he believed all that was
[1:53:48] supposed to be about so in other words
[1:53:50] there were loose ends left in every
[1:53:52] message amen hey listen
[1:53:56] the church age book brother brown talks
[1:53:57] about it how they smoked a pipe drank
[1:53:59] beer brother told me the other day and
[1:54:01] said you know that's not authentic
[1:54:02] history i said i don't know it's in the
[1:54:04] church book that's authentic enough for
[1:54:05] me
[1:54:06] amen and then we know that martin luther
[1:54:09] was against the the jews calling the
[1:54:11] antichrist wrote book after book about
[1:54:13] him being the antichrist but his message
[1:54:15] on the just shall live by faith was
[1:54:18] absolutely out of paul's message it was
[1:54:20] absolutely thus saith the lord for the
[1:54:21] hour
[1:54:22] and when the spirit spoke it the people
[1:54:24] who heard it they were placed into the
[1:54:26] body of christ but there was a loose end
[1:54:28] left in it
[1:54:30] even when paul preached his message he
[1:54:32] didn't finish the entire mystery of god
[1:54:35] he couldn't have he wasn't called to
[1:54:36] finish it the alpha only had the the
[1:54:40] foundational message to lay the
[1:54:42] foundation for the people of god but
[1:54:44] them seven seals were still shut up
[1:54:45] tight when paul went to nero's chopping
[1:54:47] block
[1:54:49] and now the line is going to roar when
[1:54:51] he roars seven thunders utter their
[1:54:54] voices
[1:54:55] remember he said whenever the the lamb
[1:54:57] would open up one of the seals he said
[1:54:59] there'd be a clap one clap of thunder
[1:55:01] come from heaven he said but look here
[1:55:03] when revelation 10 opens up he said them
[1:55:05] seven seals open up and then thunder
[1:55:07] sound he said it's seven continuous one
[1:55:09] two three four five six seven like that
[1:55:11] he said now what is that that's the
[1:55:13] voices of god he said gathering up all
[1:55:15] them loose ends down through the church
[1:55:17] ages and tying them all together to do
[1:55:20] what give us hope
[1:55:23] in a denominational age in an
[1:55:25] organizational age when man didn't know
[1:55:28] how to baptize or how many gods he
[1:55:30] served hallelujah or whether a woman was
[1:55:32] alive in the pulpit or not the lion came
[1:55:35] down he was the king of the jungle he
[1:55:38] was the original lion king
[1:55:42] oh hallelujah and when the lion rot out
[1:55:45] amen everything in the jungle had to
[1:55:48] shut up he said i'm tired of all the
[1:55:50] chatter i'm tired of my people not
[1:55:52] knowing what's up and down and now he
[1:55:55] rise out and everything goes quiet
[1:55:59] the lion said shut up i don't want to
[1:56:00] hear no more shall happen with your
[1:56:02] denomination everybody be quiet i've got
[1:56:04] something i want to say
[1:56:06] oh gloria what was it the lord himself
[1:56:09] [Applause]
[1:56:11] the lord himself now all of these
[1:56:13] mysteries of god down through the ages
[1:56:15] what did them seven thunders do he said
[1:56:17] each angel each night
[1:56:19] came into the room
[1:56:20] and talked to me that's what brother
[1:56:22] brahman said
[1:56:24] each angel
[1:56:25] each night in other words the mystery of
[1:56:27] god that was left undone
[1:56:29] justification the just shall live by
[1:56:31] faith but there was a loose end there
[1:56:33] because you see justification true
[1:56:36] justification
[1:56:37] is not just believing on the lord for
[1:56:39] salvation
[1:56:42] no it's not
[1:56:43] it's more than that
[1:56:45] now we know that when a man comes to
[1:56:47] christ he's justified that's true
[1:56:50] absolutely could i take that out of the
[1:56:51] bible or have the message no it's in
[1:56:53] there but that's not true justification
[1:56:56] because a man could be justified and
[1:56:58] still be lost
[1:56:59] amen amen
[1:57:01] come on now church
[1:57:03] he could be sanctified and still be lost
[1:57:06] justification is believing on the lord
[1:57:09] but true justification when the mighty
[1:57:11] angel ties that loose end up he said
[1:57:14] true justification is as though you
[1:57:16] never did it in the first place
[1:57:19] you don't have to be saved from
[1:57:20] something you've never done
[1:57:24] hey he said i said brother brethren i
[1:57:25] forgive you for getting drunk he said
[1:57:27] how can you forgive me for something i
[1:57:28] never did
[1:57:30] i said i never did get drunk he said i
[1:57:32] never went out there and went drinking
[1:57:34] he said that's what true justification
[1:57:36] is not just being saved but being
[1:57:39] self-forgiven by god it's as though it
[1:57:42] never took place in the beginning
[1:57:44] amen that was what happened when the
[1:57:46] loose end was tied together
[1:57:48] then it comes to john wesley's hour and
[1:57:50] john was his hour is what you did for
[1:57:52] god how you dressed how you thought how
[1:57:53] you talked what you did what you didn't
[1:57:55] do
[1:57:56] that was that was sanctification in
[1:57:57] wesley's day but when the lion took the
[1:57:59] book and tied the loose in together we
[1:58:02] found out sanctification had nothing to
[1:58:04] do with what i did for god
[1:58:06] but it's what he done for me that's what
[1:58:08] brought the sanctification
[1:58:10] it's not whether your hair is so long or
[1:58:11] whether you do certain things or don't
[1:58:13] do certain things amen even john wesley
[1:58:15] was so hard against predestination
[1:58:18] because he said it made the people loose
[1:58:19] and lazy and live any way he said god
[1:58:22] dwells in true sanctification amen he
[1:58:24] had the right message for his hour but
[1:58:26] there was a loose end left in it but
[1:58:28] when the lion the lord himself took his
[1:58:31] book hallelujah and tie that loose in
[1:58:34] together i realize i can't even sanctify
[1:58:36] myself
[1:58:38] oh my it took him to do the
[1:58:40] sanctification
[1:58:43] one of the biggest misconceptions we've
[1:58:45] got around ranks this message is people
[1:58:46] think they can save themselves
[1:58:49] that's true friends
[1:58:51] they've got it in their mind that they
[1:58:52] don't need help from god but we need it
[1:58:54] more now we've ever needed it
[1:58:57] why did god solve this mystery because
[1:58:59] he didn't want his people trying to get
[1:59:00] ready for the rapture thinking it's what
[1:59:02] they did to get them in the rapture i
[1:59:04] want to tell you something it doesn't
[1:59:06] matter what i do or don't do if i'm
[1:59:08] going to make the rapture god's going to
[1:59:09] make everything line up just like it
[1:59:10] needs to line up
[1:59:12] it ain't about whether or not i'm holy
[1:59:14] enough or not whole enough or righteous
[1:59:15] enough or not righteous we don't have
[1:59:17] any righteousness of ourself at all but
[1:59:19] christ himself will make my body come
[1:59:22] subject to the word of god amen and
[1:59:24] subject to christ and then i'll live a
[1:59:26] life that'll be worthy to go in the
[1:59:28] rapture amen you can't do it on your own
[1:59:32] that's the mystery and sanctification is
[1:59:33] that christ has to be the one to come
[1:59:35] take the desire out of your heart
[1:59:38] hey listen you can't take it out of your
[1:59:40] heart
[1:59:41] you can pray every day of your life
[1:59:42] study every message there is listen to
[1:59:44] every tape go to every church function
[1:59:46] live stream every preacher in the
[1:59:47] message and you'll still have that thing
[1:59:49] in your heart until god takes it out of
[1:59:50] there
[1:59:51] that's what true sanctification is
[1:59:54] hey listen we've got young people
[1:59:55] sitting here and i and i preach to the
[1:59:56] young people like i do the older ones i
[1:59:58] think i preach the older ones more than
[1:59:59] i do the little ones
[2:00:01] because the older ones are hard headed
[2:00:02] they've been in the message for many
[2:00:03] years they don't need no help they got
[2:00:05] everything figured out
[2:00:06] but we're the ones that need it the most
[2:00:08] come on now
[2:00:09] amen because there never should be a
[2:00:11] point in our life that we ever stop
[2:00:12] needing him to do something for our life
[2:00:15] we should always be dependent upon god
[2:00:17] 100 of the time the prophet said don't
[2:00:20] never be self-sufficient
[2:00:22] always rely upon him
[2:00:25] is the reason why that you and i are
[2:00:27] sitting in these pews tonight
[2:00:29] not because i've got the leg power or
[2:00:30] the stamina or whatever to get me out of
[2:00:32] the pew or out of the out of the bed or
[2:00:34] the car whatever walk me into the pew no
[2:00:36] but because christ by his grace saw fit
[2:00:39] to let me suck win long enough to sit in
[2:00:41] these pews
[2:00:42] amen that's right
[2:00:44] exactly right is his grace
[2:00:46] for many many years brother brown
[2:00:47] thought 1906 was the restoration of the
[2:00:50] holy ghost when the seals come open and
[2:00:52] that loose sin was left in there he
[2:00:54] realized it was not the restoration of
[2:00:56] the holy ghost it was the restoration of
[2:00:58] gifts
[2:00:59] because he tells us the holy ghost could
[2:01:01] not be revealed and restored until the
[2:01:03] end time that didn't mean that they
[2:01:04] didn't have the holy ghost down through
[2:01:06] seven church ages they did there's not
[2:01:08] two holy ghosts there's only one holy
[2:01:10] ghost
[2:01:11] but they didn't understand what they had
[2:01:14] they had the power of god they had the
[2:01:16] holy ghost but they didn't understand
[2:01:18] the fulbright or the full manifestation
[2:01:21] of what it is oh come on somebody
[2:01:24] amen but he said in the evening time
[2:01:26] when the token would come to the last
[2:01:28] day he said what would it do restore to
[2:01:30] us the transparent understanding of what
[2:01:33] the holy ghost really was that's why
[2:01:36] this is the hour for the manifestation
[2:01:38] of the sons of god
[2:01:40] because now you know what it's supposed
[2:01:41] to look like now you know how it's
[2:01:42] supposed to be in now you know what
[2:01:44] christ expects now we know that we're an
[2:01:46] invincible army with thus saith the lord
[2:01:48] we know it now
[2:01:50] why because the lamb the lion rather got
[2:01:52] tired of all the chatter amen
[2:01:55] oh praise the lord
[2:01:56] praise the lord praise the lord that's
[2:01:59] right he got tired of all the
[2:02:00] denominational this and that
[2:02:02] i'm going to say something everybody
[2:02:03] hang on
[2:02:04] but some man some renowned man in this
[2:02:06] message some about oh i guess december
[2:02:08] last year said when jesus returns he's
[2:02:10] looking for a tape church he said i said
[2:02:12] hogwash he's not even looking for a
[2:02:14] message church
[2:02:15] [Music]
[2:02:17] jesus isn't looking for people he's
[2:02:19] looking for a bride
[2:02:21] a bride that is washed and ready and
[2:02:24] sealed and on her way in the rapture
[2:02:26] he's not looking for a building this
[2:02:28] building will be left sitting here when
[2:02:29] you go
[2:02:30] amen when the rapture resurrection comes
[2:02:32] all of this will be left set in here and
[2:02:34] mama can have it the catholics can have
[2:02:36] it
[2:02:37] amen i ain't going to need it no more
[2:02:38] hallelujah
[2:02:40] amen they can have all that's whole
[2:02:41] world the lamb the life has roared and
[2:02:44] give us hope
[2:02:46] that's what them thunders was simple
[2:02:48] ain't it
[2:02:49] it isn't seven men with deeper
[2:02:51] revelations this way in that way it's
[2:02:53] the tying up of the loose ends of god
[2:02:55] all of these loose sins that were laying
[2:02:57] in the message all these things land in
[2:02:59] the bible that needed to be solved
[2:03:01] that's what them seven thunders returned
[2:03:03] to bring even the prophet of god set
[2:03:04] himself right before the first seal is
[2:03:07] preached he said i would have made a
[2:03:09] terrible mistake he said but the holy
[2:03:11] spirit came in the room about 12 o'clock
[2:03:13] and fixed something out that i was going
[2:03:14] to say wrong he what he was going back
[2:03:16] to his old notes his old notes didn't
[2:03:19] have the revelation on it
[2:03:21] matter of fact there wasn't a set of
[2:03:22] notes anywhere in the world that had the
[2:03:24] revelation on it
[2:03:25] christ and christ alone hallelujah had
[2:03:28] the revelation of what was laying
[2:03:30] underneath those seals
[2:03:32] somebody said when brother branham
[2:03:34] opened the seals i said i beg your
[2:03:35] pardon not to be contrary but brother
[2:03:37] brethren didn't open the seals
[2:03:40] jesus opened the seals amen it was him
[2:03:43] that's right and what it was it was the
[2:03:45] shout message the prophet of god said
[2:03:46] like this question answered on the seal
[2:03:48] he said now what is that seal he said
[2:03:50] the mystery of god going forth he said
[2:03:52] it's calling your name off the lamb's
[2:03:54] book of life as that mystery goes forth
[2:03:57] so as you were hearing the word of god
[2:03:59] being preached to you whether the rest
[2:04:01] of the world realizes it or not the holy
[2:04:03] spirit is calling your redemptive name
[2:04:06] you realize that lamb's book of life
[2:04:08] didn't have on their carson sampson or
[2:04:09] ben norod or bob coffee but that
[2:04:12] redemptive name is the name that new
[2:04:14] name i don't even know what it is myself
[2:04:16] but my theophany heard it whenever that
[2:04:18] lamb called me
[2:04:20] my theophany heard that message crying
[2:04:22] out cut out of her my people i'll
[2:04:25] receive you unto myself the message
[2:04:27] caught our neck it shouted to the bride
[2:04:30] and got her attention
[2:04:32] that's the reason why the rest of the
[2:04:33] world sits and looks like a bunch of
[2:04:35] mules let's look at let the new
[2:04:38] because they can't hear their name they
[2:04:39] don't have a name to hear
[2:04:41] but the elect has got a name she's got a
[2:04:43] name wrote in heaven
[2:04:45] and when was it wrote when was it put
[2:04:47] there before the foundation of the world
[2:04:50] the message the shout message come to
[2:04:53] alert the bride remember there was no
[2:04:54] difference between them ten virgins
[2:04:56] until the cry of the bridegroom came
[2:04:59] there were five wise and five foolish
[2:05:01] but the bible said there were ten
[2:05:04] un
[2:05:05] there were ten clean virgins ten virgin
[2:05:08] people but at midnight amen a cry went
[2:05:12] forth behold the bridegroom cometh then
[2:05:15] it says five were wise five were foolish
[2:05:18] what made the difference the opening of
[2:05:20] them seven seals
[2:05:22] it placed and positioned everybody and
[2:05:24] everything and put them in their right
[2:05:25] spot
[2:05:26] what are these seven thunders revealed
[2:05:28] to us the seven thunders was the perfect
[2:05:31] interpretation of the word
[2:05:34] let me make this simple because i know
[2:05:35] we've got young people sitting here i
[2:05:37] want them to understand this
[2:05:38] god i don't want you walking out here
[2:05:40] saying what in the world was he talking
[2:05:41] about tonight
[2:05:42] but there were questions in this bible
[2:05:44] that you didn't understand
[2:05:46] and until god in a supernatural way
[2:05:49] made a plain understanding of what it
[2:05:51] meant you still were guessing at it
[2:05:53] you're trying to figure it out it's like
[2:05:54] looking at one of them little puzzles
[2:05:56] it's got somebody hidden there and you
[2:05:57] know he's in there but you just can't
[2:05:58] see him right well when god set down
[2:06:01] this this revelation through the seven
[2:06:03] unknown thunders and they started uh he
[2:06:05] started pinning these things into the
[2:06:07] word of god and putting them on those
[2:06:08] tapes and preaching them across the
[2:06:10] platform listen brother branham when it
[2:06:12] comes to opening the seals gene's seed
[2:06:13] of god find him talking that way before
[2:06:16] the opening of the seals
[2:06:17] when he starts talking about balaam and
[2:06:19] their group and say oh we're all
[2:06:20] brothers brother i said no why not he
[2:06:23] said we're not all brothers look at him
[2:06:24] talk before that before that the angel
[2:06:26] of god had to rebuke him because he was
[2:06:28] catering too much to denomination
[2:06:30] but when them seals come open you didn't
[2:06:32] hear him cater no more
[2:06:34] why it was making a division making a
[2:06:36] dividing line it was putting everybody
[2:06:38] in their proper perspective of where
[2:06:40] they belong
[2:06:41] and it brought us a perfect
[2:06:42] interpretation of the bible any question
[2:06:44] you've got in the bible you can go to
[2:06:46] the tapes and come to church and you can
[2:06:48] understand what you don't understand
[2:06:50] that's why the message is so special to
[2:06:52] us it gives us a perfect interpretation
[2:06:54] of what was hid right in here
[2:06:57] friends i don't understand preachers in
[2:06:58] this message oh let's not say brother
[2:06:59] batman's name and let's not read quotes
[2:07:01] why
[2:07:02] why if i was in paul's day i'd be
[2:07:04] talking about paul if i was in peter's
[2:07:05] dad be calling peter's name
[2:07:07] i wouldn't be afraid to quote peter if i
[2:07:09] was living in the first century well god
[2:07:11] sent us a man just like them back to the
[2:07:13] earth i'm not afraid to quote him either
[2:07:15] amen
[2:07:16] amen and any true servant of god i'm not
[2:07:18] afraid to quote him
[2:07:20] amen i it wouldn't hurt my feelings a
[2:07:22] bit to say brother gerald lust said
[2:07:24] brother mark mark coffee said brother
[2:07:25] bob kai i mean if you're a servant of
[2:07:27] god hey it wouldn't matter to me if
[2:07:29] you're male or female if you tell me the
[2:07:30] truth i'm gonna amen it and i might
[2:07:32] repeat it
[2:07:34] amen that's right the perfect
[2:07:36] interpretation of the word watch again
[2:07:38] the seven unknown thunders revealed to
[2:07:40] us
[2:07:41] and defined for us the true character
[2:07:44] and nature of jesus christ
[2:07:47] it let us know
[2:07:48] in short terms what god loves
[2:07:51] what god hates what god believes
[2:07:54] and what god's all about the seven
[2:07:56] thunders revealed to us his true
[2:07:58] character
[2:07:59] this is why we know god hates
[2:08:01] organization
[2:08:03] he hates it
[2:08:04] he doesn't sympathize with it he hates
[2:08:07] organization
[2:08:08] i don't care if it's the same spirit in
[2:08:10] a message church he hates it
[2:08:14] as people can say that they want to but
[2:08:15] people are denominating around this
[2:08:17] message
[2:08:18] denominational spirits are creeping
[2:08:20] right into the ranks of this message you
[2:08:21] tell me they're not denominational when
[2:08:23] you go into a church supposed to believe
[2:08:24] this message and if somebody hollers out
[2:08:26] amen real loud everybody in the church
[2:08:28] cranes to look at them
[2:08:30] it's let y'all see it they're dead and
[2:08:32] they don't even know it a denominational
[2:08:34] spirit's got a hold of them
[2:08:36] you tell me they're not organizational
[2:08:38] whenever they you have to follow with
[2:08:39] their clubs and with their little groups
[2:08:41] and with their little associations and
[2:08:43] if you don't go to so-and-so's church or
[2:08:45] preaching so-and-so's convention or
[2:08:47] associate with so-and-so in the church
[2:08:49] well then you're not even really a part
[2:08:50] of the club i don't care about your club
[2:08:52] i care about god's club that's the one
[2:08:54] i'm trying to join
[2:08:55] amen and i don't join it i'm born into
[2:08:57] it
[2:08:59] amen i'm bathed into the kingdom of
[2:09:01] christ not joining the thing but it's a
[2:09:03] denominational spirit
[2:09:05] forgive me i'm going to say something
[2:09:06] really strong but we're just as
[2:09:07] denominational as the catholics are
[2:09:10] we don't rub peter's toe but we worship
[2:09:12] brother branham
[2:09:14] amen
[2:09:15] we've got all the same type of spirits
[2:09:18] amen that's exactly right we worship
[2:09:19] flesh we've run after personalities
[2:09:22] we've got if it ain't so-and-so
[2:09:23] preaching the camp or so-and-so doing so
[2:09:25] and so we don't even want to go here and
[2:09:27] listen as long as the man is anointed by
[2:09:28] the holy ghost i want to hear what he's
[2:09:30] got to say that's exactly right if he's
[2:09:32] telling me what the bible said what this
[2:09:34] message said amen and so be it
[2:09:37] what is that denominational spirit that
[2:09:39] tries to shut them things out it's right
[2:09:41] here amongst the people in this message
[2:09:43] they got no mercy on nobody they'll cut
[2:09:46] you off just like that they don't have
[2:09:48] any fellowship they're divided
[2:09:50] you tell me it ain't denominational it
[2:09:52] is
[2:09:53] you don't believe it just go to a
[2:09:54] message convention sometime and look at
[2:09:56] the little corners of people all
[2:09:58] separated off in their individual
[2:09:59] corners
[2:10:00] you think that's what god wants you
[2:10:02] think that's what this prophet tried to
[2:10:03] bring absolutely the opposite of what
[2:10:05] brother brahm tried to bring to us
[2:10:06] he wanted us to fellowship what if i
[2:10:08] disagree with him then so be it i like
[2:10:10] apple pie you like cherry but we're all
[2:10:12] supposed to be going to the very same
[2:10:15] heaven
[2:10:16] we got the same message we're brothers
[2:10:18] if we got the holy ghost
[2:10:20] oh but i don't like this and i don't
[2:10:22] like that that's denominational spirits
[2:10:25] that's exactly what it is
[2:10:27] amen that's exactly what it is
[2:10:29] oh my look here in
[2:10:33] the church age book page 349 brother
[2:10:35] braham reads now from revelation chapter
[2:10:37] 3 18 and 19. turn there with me if you
[2:10:39] would
[2:10:41] and we're going to we're going to read
[2:10:42] the
[2:10:43] read the scripture together
[2:10:45] now revelation 3
[2:10:48] 18 19 all right now i want to just
[2:10:51] take this part of the lady of cnn age
[2:10:53] now this is the lady of seeing this is
[2:10:54] the lady you'll see in time of what
[2:10:56] we're speaking of here tonight
[2:10:58] remember all of this that god does
[2:11:01] he does it to provide hope
[2:11:03] for the elect of god
[2:11:05] i mean could you imagine
[2:11:07] whenever jesus comes along and takes
[2:11:10] away their cloak for sin
[2:11:12] i preached this to you sometime last
[2:11:13] year ago but remember i talked about at
[2:11:15] the opening of the word i don't know if
[2:11:16] you remember not but he also took their
[2:11:18] cloak for sin away they couldn't hide
[2:11:20] anymore i don't know if you remember the
[2:11:21] message last year when i was bringing
[2:11:23] about that cloak of sin
[2:11:25] because you remember friends
[2:11:26] as long as they could stay covered that
[2:11:29] was a religious garment they had around
[2:11:30] their shoulders
[2:11:32] they looked like all the rest of us they
[2:11:33] could talk like us and walk like us and
[2:11:35] all of that but jesus brought the word
[2:11:38] to such a level that they couldn't hide
[2:11:40] behind their religion anymore
[2:11:42] look at what he did in the beatitudes oh
[2:11:44] he said a man's not supposed to
[2:11:45] commit adultery he said but i say if you
[2:11:47] look on a woman and lust after in your
[2:11:48] heart you've already committed adultery
[2:11:50] with him
[2:11:51] jesus brought it to such a level that
[2:11:53] they could not hide behind the message
[2:11:55] religion of that day they couldn't hide
[2:11:57] behind quotes
[2:12:00] amen they couldn't hide behind the
[2:12:02] prophet
[2:12:03] he brought it to such a level it would
[2:12:04] take grace and grace alone to get him
[2:12:07] out of that kind of mess he left him
[2:12:09] with one hope brother gerald himself
[2:12:12] that's the only hope he left him i mean
[2:12:13] you're listening to jesus i say to you
[2:12:15] be mad at your brother you've already
[2:12:16] killed him
[2:12:17] well you ain't got no hope after that
[2:12:19] pal as you can study the you study that
[2:12:21] torah inside and out you can know every
[2:12:23] word moses said but ain't no way in the
[2:12:24] world you can live that except for
[2:12:26] christ
[2:12:28] he's the only hope you've got in that
[2:12:30] way
[2:12:31] now watch him in this lady of c and age
[2:12:32] revelation 3 18
[2:12:34] accounts of you by me gold tried in the
[2:12:36] fire that thou mayest be rich
[2:12:40] white raiment that thou mayest be
[2:12:41] clothed that the shame of thy nakedness
[2:12:45] do not appear anoint that eyes with eyes
[2:12:48] salve
[2:12:49] that thou mayest see as many as i love i
[2:12:51] rebuke and chase and be zealous
[2:12:53] therefore and
[2:12:54] repent
[2:12:56] he says i want you to buy me gold tried
[2:12:58] in the fire
[2:13:00] why
[2:13:00] they had no spiritual character
[2:13:03] of the word
[2:13:04] that you may be rich why is he saying
[2:13:06] rich because they're poor
[2:13:09] get wet white raiment on why that
[2:13:11] because they're naked see
[2:13:13] they're naked and have no clothes the
[2:13:16] shame of thy nagginess anoint that eyes
[2:13:18] with eyes have why because they're blind
[2:13:21] not only they poor
[2:13:23] wretched
[2:13:24] miserable blind and naked the bad part
[2:13:28] was lady ladies seeing people didn't
[2:13:30] even know they were in this condition
[2:13:32] the prophet said it'd be one thing if
[2:13:33] you see a man naked on the street you
[2:13:35] walk over and tell him brother you ain't
[2:13:36] got no clothes on he said oh my goodness
[2:13:38] how how did i get in the shape help me
[2:13:40] brother help me get me a coat do
[2:13:42] something help me i something's wrong
[2:13:44] somehow he said but when you walk up and
[2:13:46] tell them they're naked and they smack
[2:13:47] you in the face and say shout and get
[2:13:48] out of here he said it goes to prove
[2:13:50] what kind of age you're living in
[2:13:52] that's the time we're living in today
[2:13:55] you can tell people write about the
[2:13:56] prophet of god and tell them about the
[2:13:57] message and tell them what the prophet
[2:13:59] said and they will they will look at you
[2:14:01] and say shop i'll do my own thing blind
[2:14:04] wretched miserable naked poor blind they
[2:14:06] don't even see that they're blind they
[2:14:09] don't even see that they're naked they
[2:14:10] don't even see that they're wretched
[2:14:11] they don't even understand that they
[2:14:13] ain't got no vision to see the word of
[2:14:14] god
[2:14:16] amen that's right
[2:14:17] they can't and then he tells them as
[2:14:19] many as i love i rebuke and chasten
[2:14:22] be zealous therefore and repent now
[2:14:24] watch this in the church but the man
[2:14:25] said the counsel of god is terse it is
[2:14:28] to the point
[2:14:29] he directs this last day church to one
[2:14:31] hope
[2:14:32] and that hope
[2:14:34] is in himself
[2:14:36] i counsel of thee to buy of me
[2:14:40] gold tried in the fire the only hope
[2:14:42] you've got is you've got to come to me i
[2:14:45] am your only hope he said it is evident
[2:14:49] from the phrase by of me that the lady
[2:14:51] will see and just not the legendary
[2:14:52] church is not dealing with jesus
[2:14:54] for the spiritual products of the
[2:14:55] kingdom of god he said their
[2:14:57] transactions cannot be spiritual they
[2:14:59] may think they're spiritual but how can
[2:15:01] they be
[2:15:02] the works in the midst or not as paul
[2:15:05] would say philippians 2 13 god and you
[2:15:06] willing and doing of his own good
[2:15:07] pleasure what about all these churches
[2:15:10] schools hospitals missionary adventures
[2:15:11] etc he said god is not in them as long
[2:15:14] as they are denominational seed and
[2:15:16] spirit
[2:15:18] and not the seed and spirit of god so
[2:15:22] here's this age
[2:15:23] standing there an absolute blind
[2:15:25] apostasy
[2:15:26] they don't a bit more know what they're
[2:15:28] going to do tomorrow than nothing in the
[2:15:30] world their only hope they've got is
[2:15:32] upon church upon church joining upon
[2:15:34] churchianity upon this that are the
[2:15:36] other friends that that don't sound like
[2:15:38] message people tell me what it sounds
[2:15:40] like
[2:15:41] that's exactly where they've got to
[2:15:42] today they would never admit it but
[2:15:43] that's where they are now
[2:15:45] you could have a
[2:15:46] revival and call an altar call
[2:15:48] how the lord moved in this place last
[2:15:50] year
[2:15:52] and and and just the power of god we had
[2:15:54] an altar call
[2:15:55] you understand i went 17 places after
[2:15:58] that and probably had three more altar
[2:15:59] calls in the church after that you know
[2:16:01] why because i couldn't convince some of
[2:16:03] them hardheads that they needed an altar
[2:16:04] call they didn't want it
[2:16:07] they didn't have no desire to come to
[2:16:08] the altar to pray to seek the face of
[2:16:10] god well their message people why would
[2:16:12] they need it because you're blind
[2:16:14] because you're miserable because you're
[2:16:16] wretched because you're poor because
[2:16:17] you're naked and the bad part is you
[2:16:19] don't even know it no matter how many
[2:16:20] quotes i read
[2:16:23] i can read every scripture in the bible
[2:16:24] and this sit there hey who's he talking
[2:16:26] to anyhow i'm talking to you that's who
[2:16:27] i'm talking to
[2:16:29] to the people of god supposedly
[2:16:30] potentially the people of god but do
[2:16:33] they have ears to hear no they shut
[2:16:35] their hearings hearing aids off
[2:16:37] amen they don't want to hear what's got
[2:16:38] to be said and listen our hearing aid
[2:16:40] ain't some little boxing stick in your
[2:16:42] ear it's supposed to be the spirit of
[2:16:44] god amen because you don't hear when the
[2:16:46] sound
[2:16:47] reverberates off your uh off your
[2:16:49] eardrum and your your eardrum
[2:16:52] that's not hearing that's just that's
[2:16:53] your that's your body responding to the
[2:16:55] sound of vibration and noise but when
[2:16:57] you really hear it is when that word
[2:16:59] anchors in your heart and gives you a
[2:17:01] hope amen
[2:17:02] amen it gives you a hope that though
[2:17:04] this will pass away i and christ alone
[2:17:08] are the majority in this world
[2:17:10] amen let them do what they want to do
[2:17:12] but mean christ are a majority
[2:17:14] amen we're partners together
[2:17:16] amen he partnership himself with mankind
[2:17:19] brotherhood said god condescended from
[2:17:21] heaven down to the earth to do what
[2:17:22] partnership with man
[2:17:24] he wants to be one with us he wants to
[2:17:26] have a relationship with us to do what
[2:17:28] give us hope
[2:17:30] friends every promise in the bible i
[2:17:31] don't care what promise you're looking
[2:17:32] at has hope in it somewhere
[2:17:34] oh you say glory to god we need faith
[2:17:36] but we need hope with that faith we've
[2:17:38] got
[2:17:39] remember the bible said hebrews 11 1
[2:17:42] without faith it's impossible to please
[2:17:44] god but in that first verse he tells us
[2:17:46] faith is the substance of things you
[2:17:48] have hoped for
[2:17:50] you realize people don't have any hope
[2:17:52] amen how could you trust an
[2:17:54] organizational type spirit around this
[2:17:56] message to get you ready for the rapture
[2:17:58] let man and woman do anything there is
[2:18:00] to do i i just come through an ordeal i
[2:18:03] realize this is going on the world so
[2:18:04] i'm going to be careful what i say here
[2:18:06] but i tell you one thing i have given up
[2:18:08] opportunities in many different parts of
[2:18:10] my ministry because i refuse to
[2:18:12] compromise with people
[2:18:14] i refuse to compromise preachers
[2:18:16] allowing adulterers and things to get up
[2:18:18] on the platform and lead songs and and
[2:18:20] and preach and on and on and on listen
[2:18:22] god requires holiness out of our life
[2:18:25] but we're not going to manufacture we
[2:18:26] just have to yield to it and let the
[2:18:28] lord bring the holiness out of us
[2:18:31] but if you've got a preacher in the
[2:18:32] platform that won't keep the platform
[2:18:34] clean
[2:18:36] you know what happens jesus is standing
[2:18:38] on the side of the door he's trying to
[2:18:39] not get me back in get me back in
[2:18:41] somebody let me back in
[2:18:44] hey i refuse to compromise with things
[2:18:45] like that amen there's a young woman we
[2:18:48] brought to the lord some years ago she
[2:18:49] started having an affair with a guy in
[2:18:51] the church i took all kinds of
[2:18:52] persecution because i stood against it
[2:18:55] i was told i should keep my mouth shut
[2:18:57] that i should leave the thing alone
[2:18:58] another brother that was standing
[2:18:59] against it i should have shut him up is
[2:19:01] what i was told i said let me tell you
[2:19:03] something you're not going to shut me up
[2:19:05] i'm going to get louder about it
[2:19:07] because god hates sin he will not
[2:19:10] compromise with sin of the devil
[2:19:13] tell me our churches aren't
[2:19:14] organizational look at them
[2:19:16] look at how they're getting
[2:19:18] people sitting around in the pews and
[2:19:19] they're dying spiritually
[2:19:21] it gets worse every year
[2:19:23] you know what it is denominational
[2:19:25] spirits are coming into the message
[2:19:27] can you understand why god did what he
[2:19:29] did in this last day not so we could
[2:19:31] learn a bunch of catch phrases and click
[2:19:33] phrases and learn how to say seal and
[2:19:35] thunder and this and that but to give us
[2:19:36] hope amen
[2:19:38] to give us hope and an age that has no
[2:19:40] hope in it whatsoever
[2:19:42] you realize the people we go to church
[2:19:44] with and i'm talking about around the
[2:19:45] world people we go to church with are
[2:19:47] sitting there blind miserable wretched
[2:19:49] poor naked and they don't even know it
[2:19:52] they're sitting right in the house of
[2:19:53] god and they're so completely blind to
[2:19:55] the things of god if the spirit of god
[2:19:57] moved on them they'll tell god no i'm
[2:19:59] not an emotional person
[2:20:01] i said this i said the people that don't
[2:20:03] know how to worship are the ones that
[2:20:04] ain't saved
[2:20:06] because let me tell you something when
[2:20:07] you get saved you don't go to how to
[2:20:09] worship god's school it just
[2:20:10] automatically comes out of you
[2:20:13] amen when you really got the baptism of
[2:20:15] the holy ghost there's not enough devils
[2:20:17] out of hell to stop you from raising
[2:20:19] your hands
[2:20:20] are you with me friends when god really
[2:20:22] does something in your heart and gives
[2:20:24] you a real hope inside of you there's
[2:20:26] nobody that can shut you up from
[2:20:28] worshiping god amen
[2:20:31] but nowadays you know it's a clap
[2:20:32] everybody claps on cue do you realize
[2:20:34] what that is that's a worldly trend
[2:20:36] friends
[2:20:37] that's just as worldly as people running
[2:20:39] after ball players and that's just as
[2:20:40] worldly as women wearing certain types
[2:20:42] of clothes listen i don't read in the
[2:20:44] bible where it said and the holy spirit
[2:20:46] came on the day of pentecost and they
[2:20:47] are all sitting in the pew clapping in
[2:20:49] one accord
[2:20:51] i don't mind if you clap your hands the
[2:20:53] bible said clap your hands but when you
[2:20:55] see people getting in a trend they don't
[2:20:56] say a man anymore they don't hallelujah
[2:20:58] anymore they don't glory to god they
[2:20:59] clap every time the preacher says
[2:21:01] something good that's a worldly thing i
[2:21:02] don't care who it is
[2:21:04] god doesn't want that out of us he wants
[2:21:06] worship out of us he wants us to worship
[2:21:08] raise our hands he wants tears to come
[2:21:11] out of her eyes cut out somebody
[2:21:13] he wants worship to come out of our
[2:21:14] hearts you know we're going to end up
[2:21:16] we're going to have a bunch of people on
[2:21:17] the last day that when all the older
[2:21:19] ones go off that knew what real
[2:21:20] pentecost looked like these younger ones
[2:21:22] going to be setting the pew they're
[2:21:23] going to be knotters
[2:21:27] nodders and note-takers that's what
[2:21:28] we're going to have
[2:21:29] because they don't know how to do
[2:21:30] nothing else amen you know why because
[2:21:33] we older ones ain't shown them how to do
[2:21:35] nothing else
[2:21:36] so we've come to church and become a
[2:21:37] bunch of knowledge and notetakers but
[2:21:39] listen my bible tells me that if a man
[2:21:42] is saved that the the joy of the lord is
[2:21:45] his strength
[2:21:47] amen we ought to be able to say amen and
[2:21:49] praise the lord and hallelujah or
[2:21:51] whatever you want to in the house of god
[2:21:53] if there's anybody that should do it the
[2:21:55] wisest god hope ought to be able to
[2:21:57] worship god
[2:21:58] [Applause]
[2:22:00] they just sit around
[2:22:02] yeah
[2:22:03] amen oh brother jerry i've done a pretty
[2:22:05] good job and i didn't kept it under two
[2:22:07] hours bless his heart
[2:22:10] i'm long-winded too
[2:22:11] [Laughter]
[2:22:14] that's pretty good brethren talked about
[2:22:16] the tabernacle who said the philistines
[2:22:18] come on him remember he said branham
[2:22:19] tabernacle the philistines are on he
[2:22:21] said god could do things in this
[2:22:23] tabernacle he said people be falling on
[2:22:24] their face worshiping and crying and
[2:22:26] what more before god he said now the
[2:22:28] spirit of god can do something in the
[2:22:30] time now and he said people will say
[2:22:31] well
[2:22:32] that's all right we don't mind listening
[2:22:34] to it every now and then if we're not
[2:22:36] too tired he said
[2:22:39] you see that very same thing happening
[2:22:40] around the message
[2:22:42] amen it's a trend
[2:22:44] it's a worldly thing it's a
[2:22:45] denominational spirit
[2:22:47] why should we live in such a condition
[2:22:49] when gods give us hope
[2:22:53] glory
[2:22:54] i've got hope it goes beyond the church
[2:22:56] bro
[2:22:58] i've got hope it goes beyond people
[2:23:00] this hope should give me an
[2:23:02] encouragement that if i'm in the middle
[2:23:03] of a valley and it's one of the worst
[2:23:05] valleys i've ever had i should have a
[2:23:07] hope and a peace to know god is always
[2:23:09] with me
[2:23:11] glory to god
[2:23:13] that's the hope we've got tonight
[2:23:16] we've got that kind of hope but look at
[2:23:18] these people just look at them friends
[2:23:20] look what a condition god saw them in
[2:23:22] and he didn't just cast them off and say
[2:23:24] i'll get out of here you bunch of devils
[2:23:25] and sinners and all that he said come to
[2:23:27] me come come i'll fix it i'll fix your
[2:23:30] problem if you will just come i wonder
[2:23:32] friends if people realize that god would
[2:23:35] he would figure out he would solve he he
[2:23:37] would he would settle he would answer
[2:23:40] he'd do anything that they needed if
[2:23:42] they would just simply come to him
[2:23:44] and just say god here i am i don't know
[2:23:46] what else to do nothing in my hands i
[2:23:48] bring simply to the cross i cling here i
[2:23:50] am lord whatever you want to do lord i'm
[2:23:52] putting myself in your hands
[2:23:55] amen it's what we need
[2:23:57] it's what we need we go on in time
[2:23:59] friends i'm afraid we're going to have a
[2:24:00] bunch of preachers that love to pl
[2:24:02] preach things politically
[2:24:04] they're going to be nice to the people
[2:24:06] everything is nice i still can't figure
[2:24:08] out when in the name of god that we get
[2:24:09] so nice in this message
[2:24:12] when did preachers get so nice
[2:24:14] last i checked we're supposed to preach
[2:24:16] heaven high and hell hot
[2:24:19] so when do we get so nice
[2:24:21] come on now somebody
[2:24:23] everybody's so nice nowadays and oh
[2:24:25] you're the bride and you're going to
[2:24:27] make it oh my everybody has their
[2:24:29] struggles sure we have our struggles but
[2:24:31] i
[2:24:31] but struggles is one thing but a person
[2:24:34] living in sin
[2:24:36] that's contrary to god's mind god is not
[2:24:38] going to bless somebody habitually
[2:24:41] living in sin every day of their life
[2:24:43] mistakes is one thing they ask the
[2:24:45] prophet of god are we going to do little
[2:24:46] minor things and he said absolutely he
[2:24:48] said that you'll have all kinds of
[2:24:50] things like that throughout your life he
[2:24:51] said but just to go on a living sin he
[2:24:53] said it don't happen you need to get
[2:24:54] saved if that's the case
[2:24:57] but preachers that got so nice
[2:24:58] everybody's bride
[2:25:00] everybody's elected everybody's gonna
[2:25:02] make it we preach to the people we're
[2:25:04] the super race and full of grace
[2:25:08] and friends we don't understand that
[2:25:09] sometimes people in that condition
[2:25:11] they're naked they're poor they're blind
[2:25:14] they're miserable they're wretched
[2:25:15] and they don't know it because nobody
[2:25:17] will tell them you're in that condition
[2:25:20] i don't blame the guy standing on the
[2:25:21] street corner naked if nobody will tell
[2:25:23] him he's out there on his own
[2:25:25] but if somebody'll tell him and he can
[2:25:26] listen why wouldn't we want to tell him
[2:25:28] what's truth
[2:25:29] that's what god's trying to tell these
[2:25:31] people here he's trying to tell him the
[2:25:32] reason you have no hope and brother
[2:25:34] brahman tells us about it in all the
[2:25:36] different messages he preached about the
[2:25:37] ladies in church age and the evening
[2:25:39] lights and the evening messenger and
[2:25:40] these different type of messages he
[2:25:42] makes it very plain for us what's going
[2:25:44] on he said it's the preachers and the
[2:25:46] pulpit he said preaching for a meal
[2:25:48] ticket instead of dealing with the
[2:25:50] people's soul
[2:25:52] that's where we are today amen the seven
[2:25:55] thunders revealed to us christ
[2:25:57] as our husband
[2:25:59] christ
[2:26:01] as our healer
[2:26:02] christ is our brother christ is our
[2:26:06] sanctifier amen
[2:26:08] it reveals him as our king
[2:26:10] he's our lion king
[2:26:12] it reveals him as the same yesterday
[2:26:15] today
[2:26:16] and forever and greater than that it
[2:26:18] reveals him as the one who rebukes us
[2:26:21] who chastens us
[2:26:23] and helps us straighten out and be right
[2:26:25] with god
[2:26:26] amen
[2:26:27] i was telling the brother today i said
[2:26:30] you know any time i've ever seen the
[2:26:31] holy spirit come down and bring
[2:26:33] correction to people when it's the holy
[2:26:35] ghost anytime they don't listen that
[2:26:37] bunch goes right out into impossibly
[2:26:39] i've seen many a message church down
[2:26:41] through the years the holy spirit come
[2:26:42] right down the congregation speak
[2:26:44] something to that congregation and let
[2:26:46] it go in one ear and out the other and
[2:26:47] the holy ghost never visits that group
[2:26:49] again
[2:26:51] they might be blessed a little bit here
[2:26:52] and there but eventually it ain't never
[2:26:54] what it could be and you know why
[2:26:56] because when people are stubborn and
[2:26:57] hard-headed and they won't listen when
[2:26:59] you're trying to tell them they're naked
[2:27:01] one day god just turns away from him and
[2:27:03] says i'll go to somebody who wants to
[2:27:04] hear it then
[2:27:06] amen thank god i'm one of those ones he
[2:27:08] turned to
[2:27:10] aren't you happy about it that you're
[2:27:12] one of the ones he turned to there's a
[2:27:14] thousand out there today that turned it
[2:27:15] away but you're the one that said yes
[2:27:18] you're the one that said yes lord that's
[2:27:19] what i want
[2:27:21] amen that's right
[2:27:23] psalm chapter 27 verse 4.
[2:27:25] now as you're turning there and get
[2:27:27] ready on the screen there and the
[2:27:29] rapture brother said there's three
[2:27:30] things that happen to shout voice the
[2:27:32] trumpet it has to happen before jesus
[2:27:34] appears
[2:27:35] he says now jesus does all three of them
[2:27:38] as he's he's he's he's descending a
[2:27:41] shout what is the shout it's a message
[2:27:42] going forth the living bread of life
[2:27:45] bringing forth the bride why because
[2:27:47] once the bread is issued out the bride
[2:27:49] will gather around that bread amen not
[2:27:51] pork but bread amen
[2:27:54] i just kidding you earlier about
[2:27:55] shouting loud on that i was actually the
[2:27:57] one shouting bigger i think
[2:27:59] i like it too
[2:28:01] but whenever the bread is giving forth
[2:28:03] the bride will jesus say where the
[2:28:05] carcass is glory to god hallelujah them
[2:28:09] eagles will just gather right on around
[2:28:10] that
[2:28:11] oh that's what i've been looking for all
[2:28:12] this time my hungry soul wants that word
[2:28:15] hallelujah amen what's that revelation
[2:28:18] of who christ really is
[2:28:20] something on the inside of that real
[2:28:22] child of god once that revelation starts
[2:28:24] going forth they just start lapping it
[2:28:26] up like a dog or that that you know you
[2:28:28] ever see a little dog get around a
[2:28:29] little thing of water he just
[2:28:31] that's where i am in church sometimes i
[2:28:33] can't hardly keep i'm getting it all
[2:28:34] over myself hallelujah amen why it's so
[2:28:37] precious to me the words of the lord i
[2:28:39] hunger and long for god to speak to my
[2:28:42] thirsty hungry soul

[2:29:40] there in goshen and the lights were on
[2:29:43] they could say i'm blessed not because
[2:29:45] of who i am but because of where i'm at

[2:30:13] us in a church and make us religious it
[2:30:15] gives us an illumination of the spirit
[2:30:17] of god it illuminates christ to us in a
[2:30:19] way the rest of the world don't know
[2:30:20] nothing about oh
[2:30:23] hallelujah
[2:30:24] amen it makes christ so real
[2:30:27] that the devil recognizes it
[2:30:29] we should recognize it
[2:30:31] amen if the devil can recognize it we
[2:30:34] should recognize it
[2:30:35] hey don't kid yourself the devil knows
[2:30:37] what you're all about amen he knows you
[2:30:40] oh he watches he sees
[2:30:43] he understands what it's all about
[2:30:45] that's right
[2:30:47] look here in in psalm 27. now this is
[2:30:49] the scripture brother brown uses for the
[2:30:50] rapture
[2:30:52] one thing have i desired of the lord now
[2:30:54] i read this
[2:30:56] when i read this i read also the many
[2:30:58] things david said right
[2:31:00] desired this this for the kingdom that
[2:31:02] for his family this for that that that
[2:31:05] and then he says one thing so when i
[2:31:06] read this i see it this way
[2:31:09] that david is trying to say out of all
[2:31:11] of the things
[2:31:12] that i would desire out of all of the
[2:31:14] things i want
[2:31:16] one thing is the greatest thing of all
[2:31:19] of these the one thing i desire greater
[2:31:21] than everything else and that i will
[2:31:23] seek after is that i may dwell in the
[2:31:26] house of the lord all the days of my
[2:31:27] life
[2:31:29] o glory to behold the beauty of the lord
[2:31:32] to inquire in his temple
[2:31:35] for in the time of trouble
[2:31:37] he
[2:31:38] shall
[2:31:39] hide me
[2:31:41] notice
[2:31:42] not you hide you
[2:31:45] amen
[2:31:47] he
[2:31:48] shall hide me
[2:31:50] you can't even hide yourself
[2:31:53] the devil sees you
[2:31:55] he knows what you're all about there are
[2:31:57] not enough quotes to hide behind
[2:31:59] it's going to take christ to hide you
[2:32:02] amen and where does he hide us in the
[2:32:03] holy ghost behind the blood
[2:32:06] brotherhood said he can't cross that
[2:32:07] bloodline because if he could he'd be
[2:32:08] our brother
[2:32:10] amen but he can't get the holy ghost he
[2:32:12] has no idea how to cross that blood the
[2:32:15] blood's more powerful than he is amen
[2:32:18] it's just like you be out in the park or
[2:32:19] you see a bunch of nonsense going on you
[2:32:21] know how this brothers you just grab
[2:32:22] your little family just come come here
[2:32:24] come here just get away from all that
[2:32:25] mask come over here and this is the way
[2:32:27] that christ is going to do us
[2:32:29] in the time of trouble he shall hide me
[2:32:32] in his pavilion in the secret glory of
[2:32:36] his tabernacle shall he
[2:32:39] hide me he
[2:32:41] shall set me upon a rock
[2:32:45] oh glory
[2:32:46] he just says come here sweetheart
[2:32:48] because come away from all that mess
[2:32:49] come over here come on i got a place for
[2:32:51] you over here come on i'll hide you i'll
[2:32:53] hide you over here glory to god
[2:32:55] hallelujah
[2:32:56] and now shall my head be lifted up above
[2:32:59] my enemies round about me therefore will
[2:33:02] i offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of
[2:33:05] joy glory i will sing yea i will sing
[2:33:08] praises unto the lord
[2:33:10] [Music]
[2:33:12] well you see after you get secured
[2:33:14] it's a good time to worship
[2:33:17] that's why i say a lot of times people
[2:33:19] don't worship they're not secured
[2:33:22] but you ever get in that securing place
[2:33:23] brother
[2:33:24] and the tears will flow and the amens
[2:33:26] and the hallelujahs will come
[2:33:29] oh
[2:33:30] glory
[2:33:31] right he
[2:33:32] will
[2:33:33] hide
[2:33:34] me now notice this
[2:33:36] in jesus's first ascension saint john
[2:33:39] chapter 20 13-19
[2:33:42] he comes to the garden
[2:33:43] he tells mary and them don't touch me
[2:33:46] he ascends up and then verses 26 through
[2:33:48] 31 saint john 20.
[2:33:51] jesus brother man said goes up for like
[2:33:53] a private type resurrection or a private
[2:33:55] ascension rather he says he steps into
[2:33:57] the sanctuary presents himself he comes
[2:33:59] back out
[2:34:00] when he drops down into the 26th verse
[2:34:02] to the 31st verse jesus enters the doors
[2:34:06] being shut
[2:34:08] notice that saint john 21 12-17 jesus
[2:34:11] jesus now eating fish and honeycomb
[2:34:14] showing them i am not just theophany
[2:34:17] because theophany doesn't eat a drink
[2:34:19] they asked brother bradman to be on the
[2:34:20] curtain of time about about eating and
[2:34:22] drinking he he talked about not eating
[2:34:25] or sleeping or any of that here he said
[2:34:26] no no we're in the office we don't eat
[2:34:28] or drink here he said when we come back
[2:34:29] to the earth we'll take up bodies and
[2:34:31] then we'll do all that so jesus was
[2:34:33] showing i'm not just partially finishing
[2:34:35] the work i have completely finished this
[2:34:38] work amen give me fish give me honeycomb
[2:34:43] now in acts chapter 1 verse 9
[2:34:46] when he had spoken these things while
[2:34:48] they beheld he was taken up in a cloud
[2:34:51] received him out of their sight
[2:34:54] a cloud
[2:34:56] not rocket ship smoke y'all
[2:34:58] a cloud
[2:35:01] and while they look steadfastly toward
[2:35:03] heaven as he went up behold two men
[2:35:04] stood by them in white apparel said you
[2:35:06] men of galilee why stand gazing up into
[2:35:09] heaven this sad jesus glory to god
[2:35:12] which was taken up from you into heaven
[2:35:14] shall so come in like matter
[2:35:17] as you have seen him go into heaven
[2:35:20] so he went up body then cloud so when he
[2:35:23] returns how will he come the same exact
[2:35:25] order only in the opposite way cloud
[2:35:28] then body
[2:35:29] he went up body then cloud he comes back
[2:35:31] you'll have to be cloud then body
[2:35:34] amen and what do we see in arizona a
[2:35:36] cloud
[2:35:38] no wonder the devil hates that
[2:35:39] revelation
[2:35:41] because it was the lion
[2:35:43] roaring out those seven thunders taking
[2:35:45] possession over his domain
[2:35:48] oh hallelujah in acts chapter 3 19-21
[2:35:51] the bible said that the heavens would
[2:35:53] hold him until the time of restoration
[2:35:56] so the cloud appeared to us to show us
[2:35:58] that the message was beginning the
[2:36:00] advent of the second coming was ushering
[2:36:02] in christ was gathering up all that was
[2:36:04] upon the earth so that we could meet
[2:36:07] them in heavenly places remember the
[2:36:08] lord himself shall descend from heaven
[2:36:10] with a shout and then we'll meet him in
[2:36:12] the clouds
[2:36:14] in the air that's not natural clouds
[2:36:17] that's talking about the revelation of
[2:36:18] that which came in 1963.
[2:36:21] that cloud the revelation that was
[2:36:22] brought with that cloud we will meet
[2:36:24] them in the revelation of that all right
[2:36:27] hang on everybody i'm almost done we're
[2:36:29] almost to the finish line
[2:36:30] but paul
[2:36:32] in all of the rapture message or all of
[2:36:33] the preaching that he did paul did not
[2:36:35] have a rapturing message
[2:36:39] his message put him in the body of
[2:36:40] christ
[2:36:41] and everything that the rest of them
[2:36:43] preached they did not have a rapturing
[2:36:45] message they had a message and put them
[2:36:47] in a body of christ they had a message
[2:36:49] that would put them in eternal life but
[2:36:51] they didn't have rapturing faith in
[2:36:53] their message
[2:36:54] listen to me
[2:36:56] it wasn't until the lion
[2:36:58] finished the mystery on this side
[2:37:00] that the capstone could set down on the
[2:37:03] rest of it all the way down through them
[2:37:05] ages
[2:37:06] and then
[2:37:07] what paul preached connected with this
[2:37:10] would bring rapturing faith for the
[2:37:11] entire body
[2:37:13] paul said in the hebrews they
[2:37:15] without us
[2:37:17] cannot be made perfect
[2:37:19] brother said i preached exactly what
[2:37:21] paul preached he did in restoring
[2:37:23] restoring restoring the original word he
[2:37:26] preached what paul preached but paul
[2:37:28] didn't preach him seals
[2:37:30] paul didn't preach the book of
[2:37:31] revelation paul never touched the book
[2:37:33] of revelation
[2:37:34] that was left to this age
[2:37:36] all of the things that was left in that
[2:37:37] age with paul he had all the message he
[2:37:40] needed to start the work but there was
[2:37:42] no rapturing faith in what paul preached
[2:37:44] for that day
[2:37:45] it took this message it took the opening
[2:37:48] of these seals to bring rapturing faith
[2:37:50] not just for us
[2:37:51] but for all seven church ages everyone
[2:37:53] that laid in the ground
[2:37:55] plum up to the apostle paul it took this
[2:37:57] message to connect with all this to
[2:37:59] bring rapturing faith for the whole body
[2:38:01] so you see you're not just getting
[2:38:02] rapture and faith for yourself you're
[2:38:04] getting it for 2 000 years of saints
[2:38:06] that's went to the ground
[2:38:08] they're waiting on us
[2:38:10] they are waiting on us to finish this
[2:38:12] mystery of god
[2:38:14] no wonder he wanted to give us hope
[2:38:19] what other choice did we have
[2:38:22] amen all of that laying in the ground
[2:38:24] that's why there are cloud around us
[2:38:26] remember what paul said it's a cloud
[2:38:27] around us well that's right that's the
[2:38:29] revelation that came down when the head
[2:38:32] come down what was the head doing it was
[2:38:34] getting ready to unite with the rest of
[2:38:35] the body
[2:38:37] listen friends i'll tell you the way
[2:38:38] brother carol said it for for for
[2:38:41] i'll use his language 100 years he's not
[2:38:43] a hundred years old but he said he's 100
[2:38:44] years but
[2:38:46] the capstone itself look at it
[2:38:48] all of this is imperfect
[2:38:51] it's imperfect it's not exactly
[2:38:53] perfected but that is a perfect capstone
[2:38:55] within itself
[2:38:57] it's perfect in itself but when that
[2:39:00] sets down on the rest of that it makes
[2:39:02] the rest of that perfect too
[2:39:03] [Applause]
[2:39:05] you realize jesus said matthew 5 48 be
[2:39:07] ye therefore perfect as my father in
[2:39:09] heaven is perfect
[2:39:11] and heaven is the capstone on earth as
[2:39:12] the rest of the characteristics the
[2:39:14] seven thunders revealed to us the
[2:39:16] character of jesus christ and once that
[2:39:18] character begins moving in the heart of
[2:39:20] the bride and the holy ghost produces
[2:39:22] all of them virtues out of our life he
[2:39:24] said then that capstone will set down on
[2:39:26] the rest of the body and it'll make you
[2:39:28] perfectly god walking in your two shoes
[2:39:32] oh i'm about to speak in another
[2:39:33] language right now
[2:39:35] amen and amen and amen now why not the
[2:39:38] devil hates us like he hates us it's the
[2:39:41] same one he faced when jesus was here
[2:39:43] only just in many more members
[2:39:45] [Laughter]
[2:39:48] oh thank you jesus thank you lord
[2:39:51] god setting down on the rest of the body
[2:39:54] god setting down on the rest of us makes
[2:39:56] all of them perfect how can luther who
[2:39:58] called the jews antichrist how can he be
[2:40:01] perfected because when his divine
[2:40:03] commentaries wrote way up here in this
[2:40:05] last stage the divine commentary for all
[2:40:07] of these are being road
[2:40:09] huh
[2:40:09] because you realize when martin luther
[2:40:11] took his last breath
[2:40:12] god
[2:40:14] justified the man and put him in the
[2:40:16] sixth dimension you realize this
[2:40:18] now all of that was laying against his
[2:40:20] life why there was no preaching to say
[2:40:21] compromise there was nobody to say
[2:40:23] different wesley comes along he tries to
[2:40:25] straighten it up it's just as much a
[2:40:26] mess when wells he tries to get a hold
[2:40:28] of is when luther had it why they're
[2:40:30] reformers not prophets
[2:40:32] it wasn't given to them to straighten
[2:40:34] out the revel the revelation comes to a
[2:40:36] prophet doesn't come to another regular
[2:40:38] men
[2:40:39] it don't come to me it doesn't come to
[2:40:40] you it comes to a prophet
[2:40:42] and then he comes all the way down here
[2:40:43] to this last stage and he preaches it is
[2:40:45] as though you never done it in the first
[2:40:48] place so when he justified us he
[2:40:51] justified all the rest of them down
[2:40:52] through the rest of them ages
[2:40:54] because by straightening that mystery up
[2:40:56] it straightened all the rest of it out
[2:40:58] glory to god no wonder they were waiting
[2:41:00] on us
[2:41:01] no wonder they were waiting on us all
[2:41:03] them un
[2:41:04] them loose sins and undone parts hanging
[2:41:06] out there in space and when the mighty
[2:41:08] angel comes down to a sin or descend
[2:41:10] rather onto this capstone work unto all
[2:41:13] of the ages that have been finished on
[2:41:14] this capstone work and he descends down
[2:41:16] to place the capstone on it without that
[2:41:20] all of them things left in them church
[2:41:22] ages would have been against every one
[2:41:23] of those men luther would have had to
[2:41:26] answer to god for calling the jews the
[2:41:28] antichrist
[2:41:29] because that message was left undone but
[2:41:31] when them seven thunders sound and god
[2:41:33] brings the revelation plain what did
[2:41:35] brother branham say he said just like it
[2:41:37] was in the old testament god winked at
[2:41:39] their ignorance down through them church
[2:41:41] ages
[2:41:42] because of misinterpreted theology oh i
[2:41:44] feel like shouting now hallelujah
[2:41:46] just like with marriage and divorce he
[2:41:48] said god and don't you do that thing
[2:41:50] again he said misinterpret theology is
[2:41:52] what made the mess we've got today
[2:41:55] amen amen amen amen they had the same
[2:41:57] bible the same revelation but they
[2:41:59] didn't have the understanding of it
[2:42:01] pulled from the word
[2:42:03] and here brother breton has got the he's
[2:42:05] got the pulpit god meets him out there
[2:42:07] on finger rock and he starts bringing
[2:42:09] the revelation on marriage and divorce
[2:42:10] and
[2:42:11] you know all these people setting in
[2:42:12] conditions god would have judged them
[2:42:15] for being adulterers
[2:42:16] but because justification was on the
[2:42:19] scene
[2:42:20] god could justify them for all of them
[2:42:23] past actions he wasn't just justifying
[2:42:25] that bunch sitting there in parkview
[2:42:26] junior high school there was 2 000 years
[2:42:28] of mess that needed to be straightened
[2:42:30] out
[2:42:31] god was straighten it out for the entire
[2:42:32] body
[2:42:34] how many of those men and women went by
[2:42:36] the way of the grave not really
[2:42:37] understanding what marriage and divorce
[2:42:38] is all about listen paul preached many
[2:42:40] different things about marriage and
[2:42:42] divorce but he had the same words of
[2:42:44] jesus that we've got
[2:42:45] and here he's got all these people set
[2:42:47] in all these conditions look at him in
[2:42:48] the book of romans and in corinthians
[2:42:50] when he goes to them gentiles out there
[2:42:52] and said you were extortioners and
[2:42:53] idolaters and thieves and homosexuals
[2:42:55] and this and that such for some of you
[2:42:58] before christ came into your life
[2:43:00] it's i speak it by permission this says
[2:43:02] i not the lord brother man said look at
[2:43:04] moses stand there he gave him a rally of
[2:43:06] divorce because of the hardness of their
[2:43:08] heart and no adulterer shall enter into
[2:43:10] the gates of heaven but when that
[2:43:12] prophet stood there and straightened
[2:43:13] that mystery of god out it made a
[2:43:15] through way for every single one of them
[2:43:17] to walk streets of gold
[2:43:19] oh glory to god hallelujah
[2:43:22] now why did the devil hates the
[2:43:24] revelation of this message he knows you
[2:43:26] shut it down you shut down 6 000 years
[2:43:29] of mercy and grace to the people of god
[2:43:32] how many then people in the old
[2:43:33] testament laying in the grave right now
[2:43:35] whenever
[2:43:37] whenever that message came forth god as
[2:43:39] you are don't you do it again brother
[2:43:41] let me tell you something i don't
[2:43:42] believe shouting was just there in part
[2:43:44] view junior high school or when you
[2:43:46] heard it your tape and your
[2:43:47] that tape in your car for the first time
[2:43:49] but i believe on the other side of glory
[2:43:51] brother gerald i believe there were
[2:43:52] people shouting and glorifying god amen
[2:43:55] amen i was in that mess too thank god
[2:43:58] i've been justified amen
[2:44:01] amen
[2:44:02] amen
[2:44:04] here's my last point we're going to
[2:44:06] close first kings chapter 18 verse 29
[2:44:09] they tell me quit saying i'm going to
[2:44:10] close this i never do
[2:44:12] makes people anxious they think i'm
[2:44:14] going to close and i keep going
[2:44:16] that's what you call filler we preachers
[2:44:18] use a lot of filler
[2:44:19] amen amen it don't mean i'm going to
[2:44:22] close i'm just trying to make you think
[2:44:23] i am i guess
[2:44:26] first kings chapter 18 verse 29.
[2:44:29] now let's look at just a little
[2:44:31] something before we go home
[2:44:33] oh don't you love the word of god amen
[2:44:35] it's beautiful isn't it
[2:44:38] first kings
[2:44:39] i want you to see this this type in here
[2:44:41] of elijah
[2:44:42] we know where he's at
[2:44:44] he's up here with these prophets of baal
[2:44:47] and he's got a certain ministry he's
[2:44:49] gonna have to perform here and watch
[2:44:51] this type come right back up here in the
[2:44:53] end time verse 29. now i'm not going to
[2:44:54] read it all we're just going to skim
[2:44:56] over just catch the highlight of this it
[2:44:58] came to pass when midday was passed they
[2:45:00] prophesied to the time
[2:45:02] of the offering of the evening
[2:45:05] sacrifice
[2:45:06] so it is the evening time
[2:45:09] verse 30 and elijah brings all of the
[2:45:12] people near to him
[2:45:14] what does he do he repairs the altar of
[2:45:17] the lord remember the first and second
[2:45:18] pool was
[2:45:19] the first and second pull was to catch
[2:45:22] the attention of the people by the mark
[2:45:23] and bring all the people's attention
[2:45:26] upon him you see billy graham and oral
[2:45:28] roberts had great ministries
[2:45:30] they could bring the people out
[2:45:32] but they had nowhere to take them into
[2:45:35] amen because they had no revelation to
[2:45:37] take them in do you realize they're
[2:45:38] calling billy graham america's pastor i
[2:45:40] said sure because they rejected their
[2:45:41] real one
[2:45:42] their real one was elijah brother brown
[2:45:44] was the real pastor of america well sure
[2:45:46] they wanted billy billy would bring them
[2:45:47] out they could come to the altar pop and
[2:45:49] gum telling jokes and go back the same
[2:45:51] type of people there was as great a man
[2:45:53] as he might have been in the eyes of the
[2:45:54] people he had nowhere to take him when
[2:45:56] he brought him out
[2:45:58] that's why brother brown was given a
[2:45:59] sign in the hand that's why he was given
[2:46:01] that discernment because like elijah
[2:46:03] here he's gathering all the people he's
[2:46:05] getting all the people around the altar
[2:46:08] of the lord once he gets them all
[2:46:09] gathered in by the thousands and the
[2:46:11] thousands and the 10 000 he starts
[2:46:13] repairing the altar of the lord now
[2:46:15] watch what he does this is this is
[2:46:17] beautiful people don't believe in
[2:46:18] predestination
[2:46:19] when they they read this right here it
[2:46:21] ought to convince them about
[2:46:22] predestination
[2:46:23] verse 31 elijah took the 12 stones
[2:46:26] according to the number of the tribes of
[2:46:28] the sons of jacob well that don't matter
[2:46:30] god just saves anybody then why is he
[2:46:32] doing this
[2:46:34] every man has their predestinated
[2:46:36] position in this altar this economy of
[2:46:38] god
[2:46:39] so he's positioning every one of them
[2:46:41] according to their predestinated order
[2:46:43] of god and guess what when moses and
[2:46:45] elijah raise up out of them 144 000 over
[2:46:47] there and start bringing the people back
[2:46:49] to the revelation of this message
[2:46:51] brother branham said that holy ghost
[2:46:53] will use them prophets to set all them
[2:46:55] tribes back in their proper tribal order
[2:46:57] again
[2:46:59] lord of god
[2:47:00] because brother i don't care how far you
[2:47:02] get away from god if you're a part of
[2:47:04] his economy he'll bring you back to your
[2:47:06] proper order somewhere
[2:47:10] amen i don't care what he's got to do if
[2:47:12] he's got your name in the palm of his
[2:47:14] hand brother look out trouble's coming
[2:47:17] for you if you don't straighten out amen
[2:47:19] amen he'll bankrupt heaven and he'll
[2:47:21] turn the earth upside down just to get
[2:47:23] you in your right position
[2:47:24] [Laughter]
[2:47:27] amen somebody said how do you know
[2:47:28] they're saved i said because their
[2:47:29] world's upside down
[2:47:31] god must think something about him
[2:47:33] because if he doesn't he don't care he
[2:47:35] just leaves him alone
[2:47:36] verse 32 the stones he built this altar
[2:47:39] watch he's building it up makes a trench
[2:47:42] about the altar with two measures
[2:47:45] of seed first pull second pull old
[2:47:48] testament new testament you type it many
[2:47:50] ways here
[2:47:51] justification sanctification two
[2:47:53] measures of seed he put the wood in
[2:47:55] order
[2:47:57] see god even believe in church order
[2:47:58] back in
[2:48:00] he puts the wood in order and cuts the
[2:48:01] bullock in pieces laid him on the wood
[2:48:03] and said phil far
[2:48:06] barrels
[2:48:07] matthew mark luke and john
[2:48:11] glory
[2:48:12] fill four barrels up oh my thank you
[2:48:14] lord jesus amen and fill them with water
[2:48:17] and put it upon the burnt sacrifice and
[2:48:19] on the wood remember four also
[2:48:21] represents earth represents earthly
[2:48:22] deliverance
[2:48:24] and the water ran round about the altar
[2:48:27] and he filled the trench also with water
[2:48:30] so it wasn't just halfway around the
[2:48:31] altar this went all the way around the
[2:48:34] altar
[2:48:35] for in revelation 4 when the revelation
[2:48:37] comes back it's round about the altar is
[2:48:40] the rainbow all the way around blueberry
[2:48:42] said what it represent he said the
[2:48:43] entire revelation has come back into
[2:48:45] full view
[2:48:47] amen elijah said if i'm going to restore
[2:48:49] this i've got to restore all of it i
[2:48:51] can't leave no stone unturned
[2:48:53] amen in this case literally
[2:48:56] watch oh the water ran about the altar
[2:48:59] he filled the trench verse 36 came to
[2:49:00] pass at the time of the offering of the
[2:49:02] evening of sacrifice elijah the prophet
[2:49:04] came near
[2:49:06] amen malachi 4 5 i'll send to you elijah
[2:49:08] the prophet
[2:49:10] said the lord god of abraham isaac
[2:49:12] israel let it be known this day to thou
[2:49:14] that god in israel that i am thy servant
[2:49:15] i have done all these things that thy
[2:49:17] word
[2:49:18] hear me o lord hear me that this people
[2:49:20] may know that thou art lord god and thou
[2:49:22] has turned their heart back again amen
[2:49:28] what did he say in the church his book
[2:49:30] it would be the sounding of them seven
[2:49:31] unknown thunders that will literally
[2:49:34] turn the hearts of the children back to
[2:49:37] the pentecostal faith of the fathers
[2:49:40] amen
[2:49:41] that very revelation will literally turn
[2:49:44] us right back to the original way
[2:49:46] friends people that don't believe in the
[2:49:48] opening of the word they haven't been
[2:49:49] turned back yet
[2:49:51] that's all there is to it they're still
[2:49:52] stuck in 1906 pentecost they're stuck in
[2:49:54] 50s revivals and tent meetings around
[2:49:57] the country but at the opening of the
[2:49:58] word it takes them into a whole other
[2:50:00] level altogether of christ
[2:50:03] it turns their heart back look at how
[2:50:05] beautiful this is
[2:50:07] then the fire of the lord fell and
[2:50:09] consumed the burnt sacrifice the wood
[2:50:11] the stones the dust licked up the water
[2:50:13] that was in the trench and when all the
[2:50:14] people saw they fell on their faces and
[2:50:16] said the lord he is the god
[2:50:19] the lord he is the god and then elijah
[2:50:23] turns
[2:50:24] my look takes the prophets of baal let
[2:50:26] not one of them escape elijah brought
[2:50:28] him in to brook keyshawn and slew them
[2:50:30] there and elijah said to ahab gavin
[2:50:32] drake over to god for there is the sound
[2:50:36] of the abundance of the latter rain
[2:50:42] the former rain has been sown the word
[2:50:45] has been sown into the hearts of the
[2:50:47] bride and now it's time to bring that
[2:50:51] which has been sown into full maturity
[2:50:54] let it rain lord let it rain let it fall
[2:50:58] in the abundance of rain
[2:51:03] amen
[2:51:04] oh jesus
[2:51:07] so elijah built in the altar
[2:51:10] was building up all of this
[2:51:13] it gets the trench dug
[2:51:15] it gets the wood in order gets the
[2:51:17] stones in their place
[2:51:19] but when the fire fell brother
[2:51:21] it went from the first pool to the
[2:51:22] second pool
[2:51:23] it went from matthew mark luke and john
[2:51:26] it went from the water of the word
[2:51:28] to the capstone
[2:51:29] which was the fire the fire was the
[2:51:32] capstone that set down on the rest of it
[2:51:35] and made manifest notice the people did
[2:51:37] not recognize he was the lord god until
[2:51:39] the fire fell upon the altar
[2:51:42] and neither will you and i recognize who
[2:51:44] jesus is in this last day until holy
[2:51:46] ghost and fire falls upon us and
[2:51:49] consumes every part that's been set in
[2:51:51] order by this word
[2:51:53] that's why we have got to be restored
[2:51:56] back by the preaching of elijah the
[2:51:59] prophet and any man of god that stands
[2:52:02] in this platform has got to say only
[2:52:04] what those tapes said or he's preaching
[2:52:06] false doctrine
[2:52:07] men in that first stage i heard people
[2:52:09] say contrary to paul they said you're
[2:52:10] not saying what paul said same thing
[2:52:13] today they leave that message you're not
[2:52:15] saying what brother branham said
[2:52:17] amen they've got to stay with the
[2:52:19] original word i don't care people like
[2:52:21] it or not brother branham was the man
[2:52:24] god used to place this message in its
[2:52:26] proper order and god wasn't going to
[2:52:29] bypass him to pick up an oral robbers
[2:52:31] god wasn't going to bypass him to pick
[2:52:32] up a billy graham god wasn't going to
[2:52:34] bypass him to pick up a jack coe and if
[2:52:37] we're supposed to be the bride
[2:52:39] god ain't going to bypass you and i for
[2:52:40] anybody else we are the ones going to
[2:52:42] finish this mystery of god
[2:52:45] we're the ones going to finish this
[2:52:47] revelation of god nobody else can take
[2:52:49] my position i hear the prophet of god
[2:52:51] say if god placed you in his book before
[2:52:54] the foundation of the world he said
[2:52:55] nobody nobody can take your place in
[2:52:59] christ's body
[2:53:02] amen hang on everybody
[2:53:05] but i'm just as eternal as god as he
[2:53:07] turned on
[2:53:09] i am him
[2:53:11] his revelation is me
[2:53:13] i am his revelation of this last day
[2:53:18] we are the devil hates that boy
[2:53:20] hey he hates that man he don't like that
[2:53:22] revelation coming but when the bride is
[2:53:24] doing the talking that's what he's
[2:53:25] scared of that's what he backs up off of
[2:53:28] is the revelation of jesus christ in the
[2:53:31] heart of his bride
[2:53:33] and when we use these quotes we don't
[2:53:35] use these quotes we live these quotes
[2:53:37] when we read these books we don't read
[2:53:39] these books we absorb the spirit of god
[2:53:41] and manifest the promise in that word
[2:53:44] amen absorbance to his word
[2:53:47] like a sponge we just take it all in and
[2:53:49] then you squeeze me out it comes amen

[2:55:14] fiber my actions my behavior my
[2:55:17] character to all of it is just so full

[2:55:46] and you just sling it around just goes
[2:55:47] everywhere amen i said do what they want
[2:55:49] to the bride the more pressure they put

[2:56:01] of the abundance of rain remember the
[2:56:02] latter rain didn't just bring the bride
[2:56:04] to their full position but it brings

[2:56:08] economical seed under billy graham well
[2:56:11] roberts that whole thing it brings all
[2:56:13] of it to its fruition the latter rain
[2:56:16] is the fulfillment of your position

[2:56:23] other words if they were a little baby
[2:56:25] at communicable when it comes time for
[2:56:27] latter rain they're all growed up
[2:56:28] ecumenical

[2:59:00] it'll be so fast you won't even be able
[2:59:02] to get a selfie of it
[2:59:08] it'll go so fast there's not a camera in
[2:59:10] the world to be able to catch it because
[2:59:11] you'll have to be synchronized to the
[2:59:14] revelation of this hour and that
[2:59:16] revelation as it comes forth in the
[2:59:17] heart of the bride as that revelation
[2:59:19] proceeds forth and grabs a hold of you
[2:59:21] that same revelation will just
[2:59:23] and you'll be gone i've been waiting my
[2:59:25] entire life to say this to the devil now
[2:59:27] you see me no you don't
[2:59:31] glory hallelujah
[2:59:34] amen amen

[2:59:41] dale potter many years ago said
[2:59:45] there's been cosmonauts
[2:59:46] there's been astronauts
[2:59:48] he said but enoch was the first was not
[2:59:51] right now
[2:59:52] god took him out of here
[2:59:54] the word he uses whatever the mark for
[2:59:55] took is wrapped like you know the claw
[2:59:58] of a bird
[2:59:59] the raptor
[3:00:00] rapture
[3:00:01] rapture
[3:00:03] and he said in the time of trouble
[3:00:05] he
[3:00:06] shall hide me in other words he'll take
[3:00:08] me out of this whole world brother said
[3:00:10] it'll come to a spot it won't be a
[3:00:12] fitting place for the bride to live in
[3:00:13] anymore
[3:00:14] it'll become so unfit for us he'll just
[3:00:17] reach down with that great eagle claw
[3:00:19] mom will just pull us out of this old
[3:00:20] age and say come over here sweetheart
[3:00:22] there's a wedding supper three and a
[3:00:23] half years wedding supper waiting on you

[3:01:48] eternity the greatest revelation will be
[3:01:51] when you realize i made it after all
[3:01:54] amen and you know what's beautiful about
[3:01:56] it you won't be able to say at that
