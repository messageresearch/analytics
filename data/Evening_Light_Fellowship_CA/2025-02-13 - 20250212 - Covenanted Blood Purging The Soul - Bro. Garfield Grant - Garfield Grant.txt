the service it's good for me to be served instead of serving it's good for you to have a different presentation of the same food and I've told him it doesn't matter if I preached it or not if he's going beyond what I've preached if it matters not I said take your Liberty tonight and just preach what the Lord lays on your heart so just as we turn over to we're going to sing that song I Need You Lord right now I think it's 1073 or 1079 maybe as we turn over to him but let's just be in prayer for him first time preaching in a particular congregation it's not always easy and he was rushed and

your divine presence here one more time that you bless your people Lord Hallelujah Lord God we know that you of all things under your control Lord God Lord God all the virtues all the power is in your hands this evening and the greatest that we can do Lord God as your servant Lord is to Humble our hearts and surrender Our Lives into your hands Lord God that you may flow through us and that your Holy Spirit Lord God will have the preeminence in all that we do this evening Lord God may you bless us your people Lord and Lord God may the hearo Lord God May the speak and all that oh God shall be done may be under your leadership tonight bless us now we pray in Jesus Christ's name and we say amen and amen praise the Lord let me thank you all for this wonderful opportunity to stand here you know you know it's a wonderful feeling it's it's an unusual feeling you know I used to you know watch brother John and the other ministers you know they to come and you know to preach and it was so easy to stay there and look up and say Amen you know but when you stand here it's a it's a different thing really you know but praise God Amen I'd like to speak tonight on a on a topic a particular topic as a covenanted blood purging the soul um and uh like to turn our Bibles to the book of Deuteronomy 30 and verse one and it reads and it come and it shall come to pass when all these things are come upon thee the blessing and the curse which I have set before thee and thou shalt call them to mine among all the nation where the Lord thy God has driven thee and shall return unto the Lord thy God and shall obey his voice according to all that I commanded thee this day thou and thy children with all thine heart and with all thy soul and then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity and have compassion upon thee and will return and gather thee from all the nations whether the Lord thy God has scatter of thee and you know I I'd like to point out here that all that God is doing is his job is he himself s doing the restoration work and he said and he the Lord will restore us to a true position verse four it says and if any of thine be driven out onto the uttermost part of Heaven from then will the Lord thy God will gather thee and from then will he fetch thee by his Sovereign Grace you know we we know tonight that God will go after us amen because we belong to him amen praise God verse five we say that and the Lord thy God will bring thee into the land which thy father as fathers possess and thou shalt possess it and he will do thee good and multiply thee above thy fathers and the Lord thy God will ser circumcise thy heart and the Art of thy of thy seed to love the Lord thy God and with all thine heart and with all thy soul that thou mayest live amen verse 7 and the Lord thy God will put all these curse upon thine enemies and upon them that ate thee which persecuted thee and thou shallal return and obey the voice of the Lord and do all the Commandments which I command thee this day praise God you may be seated tonight you know just to think of this work of restoration or the work of redemption that God didn't committed to a prophet or to anybody but the Lord himself will take the role of restoration of his of his people and you know to bring them back exactly to where God want his people to be restored so the complete Act of restoration uh restoring his bride you know it was done by the Lord himself now that is very important to understanding to the the the work of God or what God had planned for you and I tonight that we are in safe hands praise God and that God made a promise he made a committ to himself that he will restore that he will bring amen a complete restoration and he said there that he will gather Us in other word wherever we are wherever we we we found ourself God will go after his people and God will gather us back to unto himself verse six of the verse six it says here and I quote and the Lord thy God will circumcise thine art and the Art of thy seed to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul and thou shall live amen praise God so it's this work of God this restor restoration of God Amen to bring you back but not just to bring you back but also to circumcise your heart you know to to to BR give you a new heart to to change the person of who you are from your art and that that changing is not just amen it's not just you doing a work but God working on you really you know God circumcising the Earth so when he brings you back amen he brings you back for one purpose and that is to to circum size your art amen praise God Amen that you will that you will obey God and that you will follow him after his his perfect word are you there with me church and so brother Brenham in the message I me get right let me go a little bit further bear with me a little bit okay uh let me quote it see come here in the message the position of the believer in Christ brother bam said brother bam was quoting from Paul in the book of Hebrews chapter 9 he said for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never make those things those sacrifice that offered here by here continually make the Comm unto Perfection now this is brother I'm quoting Paul so bam said that now the subject is perfection because now if God is going to circumcise Your Heart Right God is going to bring us into Perfection that's the purpose why he's working on us really and that is to bring us into Perfection so brother bam said now the subject is perfection now he said how can a moral man ever become perfected he said and yet God said in his word that we that he chose us to be holy perfected before the foundation of the world he said always going to do that he said Jesus said be thou perfect even as your heavenly father is perfect and so this circumcision this is God working on us to perfect us right God bring bringing us into that in in the position of perfection right and so brother Pam said that's exactly what is going to happen to us you see this age in which we're living in church it's an age that God requires Perfection and this Perfection is not just you coming to church but God Hallelujah by his own work by his own Grace you know God is bringing us into this Perfection and so but I'm how can God look at us Church look at look at where we are and what we are tonight but but I'm ask a question how can we be become become perfect well let me tell you tonight that when God works on us when God Chang the heart when God circumcised the heart Hallelujah then God will perfect Us by the circumcision of our heart amen so we say tonight Lord work on me work on me Lord now this Perfection that we speak of you know brother bam speak off that we must attain onto I think I'm right spot there right I'm going to paraphrase uh you know Hebrews chapter 9 coming down to where we at now but we find that Hebrews chapter 9 speaks of you know it speaks of uh the the the the priesthood or or the the the Levites you know they were given a a a job you know by by God you know they administer the office you know they they they they were given that role you know by God for them to perform but we find that even though in that capacity where you know these you know the priests were were given you know the office but yet still the Bible said Paul said but it could not bring Perfection and you know we we find Paul in Hebrews chapter 9:6 he said and when these things with us are he said the priest went into the first Tabernacle to accomplish the service of God now we understand that when they were given this responsibility you know where where you know they were to administer the office and do all of these things that according to what God told them to do right the Bible said which was to accomplish the service of God but yet still you know we look at all of that and in in in the eyes of the priest they were justifiable to say that well God told me to do do this it was God's ordinance up upon their lives you know to to carry out the the function of of of the or to administer the the the the the the office of of of priesthood but the Bible said but with all that that which they were doing it could not bring Perfection so I'm saying to us tonight that what is this Perfection that God is requiring what is it that God is requiring for you from you and I because if if someone can present a statement to say that well God told me to do do this but God is looking at the office that into which they were doing it and God was saying that that listen it could not bring Perfection and so we find that because it was being administered by the hands of men and so it could not bring the Perfection that God was looking for the Bible said in in verse 7 that but unto the second went the high priest even Aon the Bible said that he went the second uh the second went into the high priest alone that's uh Hebrews 9:7 and he said alone once every year he said not without blood which he offered for himself and for the error of the people but the Bible said in verse 8 right verse eight it's it's displaying yes thank you Lord it says there in verse 8 that but the Holy Ghost is signifying but the way into the holiest was not yet made manifest why the first Tabernacle was yet standing in other word with all of that all the works are performed but because the Holy Ghost was not yet given it could not bring Perfection because you see it was it was done and truly it was done spiritually according to what God told them but because the Bible said because the way into the holiest was not made known because because the Holy Ghost was not yet given and so it could not be perfection without the Holy Ghost there's no Perfection really amen and so the Bible said let me read again verse 8 it said the Holy Ghost does signify that the way into the holiest was of all was not yet made manifest while the first Tabernacle was standing and so the priests they administering the office doing all the God told them to do but because there was a greater meaning Hallelujah than just simply doing exactly you know they were doing it but it wasn't according to amen they were doing it but it it the Holy Ghost was not yet given and so it could not reach to to the extent of what God had intended for and so the works that were being performed amen it could not bring Perfection church because it was L by human hands it could not produce the works that God was expecting for for it to be done and verse 9 it says which was a figure for the time then in which were offered both gifts and sacrifice that could not make him that do the service of God perfect as pertained to the conscience now this is where I want to go tonight because you see to bring Perfection really the conscience will have to be clear Hallelujah to bring Perfection God it had to had to be it had to move from just simply doing a work by human hands and it have to go straight into the heart and and so the conscience the consciences were being record the Bible said that every year they went and they do the same thing the Bible said there was a remembrance of of of of the same thing that was done every here and for the fact that there was a remembrance it mean that the sin the offering couldn't not reach the heart to change the heartart all right and so am and so the conscience were being recall that there was not a change that has taken place from the inside and the Bible said that all that they were doing the Bible said which stood only in meat and drink and diverse washing and carnal ordinances imposed upon them until the time of reformation praise the Lord just bear with me a little bit and verse 12 it said never by the blood of goats and calf but by his own blood he enter once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us for if the blood of bull and goat and the ash of the effers sprinkling the unclean Sanctified to the purifying of the flesh it said how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offer himself without spot unto God purging your conscience from dead Works to serve the living God and so God he promised that he would clear the conscience but how could he do that it's only when he reaches the heart right and so he said that he's going to he's going to purge that conscience really from dead works because you see all that they were doing really it could not bring life Hallelujah to to the to the worshipper it could not it could not reach their heart and so they were doing the same thing over and over and over but God said he's going to send a restoration a Perfection that can clear the conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God and so to get to God's Perfection really there got to be a purging of the soul from from sin before the conscience could be clear in other words they have to be a circumcision or a a a changing of the heart which speak to receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost you see church if I may you know get bear with me as I seconding you know but but you see the thing is that we we recognize that you know we H it's easy to to to to do things you know to to to to participate in church or to be be a part of that spiritual you know but you know but the reality is that God does not just want you just to be a part of a spiritual he wants Hallelujah the conversion of the heart you know he wants the heart to be converted and the only way that the heart can project The Works that are acceptable unto God right the Holy Ghost has to go inside and when the Holy Ghost go inside he purges on the inside of the conscience he Chang changes Hallelujah it perform the works of the inside and so the conscience from the inside will do exactly what God wants us to do are you there with me church and so amen and so yes it is good to participate yes it is good to be in church yes but you must receive Christ on the inside right you must receive Christ on the inside so to get to God's Perfection there got to be a purging of the Soul you see the conscience depicts the work of what is happening on the inside and so if your conscience if your soul is not converted your conscience will reflect that you will see by the works that follow in other words the reason why there was a continuation of of the sacrifice it was because that something was not touched on the inside but God said in order to bring back his people to perfection in order to restore his people in order to bring us back to where God said he wants us God said I God will restore you in other words he going to take it off just the works that we perform and God is going to go all the way on the inside and reach that place there that that that the blood of the animal sacrifice could not reach in other words it's not by works it's not by might it's not by power but he said but by it's by my Holy Spirit say the lord it's by spirit and God said and high God is going to restore you in know what it's going to go beyond Hallelujah your mortal flesh it's going to go beyond your your mortal spirit and it's going to go Hallelujah into your soul and convert it so God is looking for Perfection not in your flesh but he's looking for perfection in the soul so brother bam said said in the the message uh the position in Christ said but this man he said not the whole law Paul separating law From Grace but he said but this man after he had after he had offered one sacrifice for sin however he sat down at the right hand of God and so Jesus he died to do what Hallelujah to release his spirit that his Spirit can go on the inside and bring that conversion right and so the Bible said and when he does that when he paid the price of redemption the Bible said and he went up and he said andp expecting until all its enemies are made his foot stool in other word when Jesus died and he was ascended he knows exactly that the work that he did was perfect your salvation was completed in Christ but now he's resting because now brother said when he went up he came back down in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost because the work never stopped when he died because now he had to come not just in a Corporal body but in a spiritual body in in in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost right and so he's resting but say he's resting on the thr but he sent about the Holy Ghost and he's going to bring all his enemies where where the enemies of Christ we are they there are those Hallelujah who are hindering you from your Perfection but God said Hallelujah but because the sacrifice was perfect and the sacrifice was accepted by God it will bring exactly what God said it will bring in other word your Redemption cannot fail because God cannot fail glory to God so we see the Bible said you bear with me my first time I'm going to too far back Speeders I've gone back too far I think probably just gone and so the Bible said in Hebrews chapter 1 verse 1 the Bible said who God atent to time and in diverse manner has spoken in time pass unto the fathers by the prophets but as in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he had appointed here of All Things by whom also he made the world who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power the Bible said when he had by himself purged our sins sat down at the right hand on majesty and high so he's he has done the work of their Redemption but now it has to be applied Church it has to bring forth exactly the perfect work to bring that Perfection but how can God do that because you see you see and and I'm saying all of this with the thought of you know this age in which we're living in because it's easier to adopt spiritual principles it's easy to come to church and to sing the the songs of Z to apply the spiritual side of things but you know what but that does not guarantee a sufficiency of perfection remember the word of the church today is that God is requiring us hallelujah Perfection listen without Perfection it is impossible to step into into you know into heaven really god require Perfection to get there and so listen it doesn't matter how much spirit we want to become it doesn't matter we sing like angels and all of that however God is requiring Perfection which is the Holy Ghost upon the heart the only person the only Perfection that God is is expecting the church to have is he himself living on the inside so that takes it off all of us it's not me it's it's not brother John it's not brother Mark it's him it's Christ the Perfection and so he said that when he rose he committed the work of Grace he went up but he came back down to do what to live on the H side because now as said and if he's living on the inside the house he must Express himself if he's there H but how can he do that because you see the adoption the thought is that every every one is taking the spiritual form it's very hard to differentiate brother John everybody you know there's so much so much anointing out there but the reality is that Hallelujah but God Hallelujah in this day he promised something different for the bride and so H he's living on the inside church that's what he wants to take the preeminence on the inside amen I think I'll just use the quotes as they come so listen he's not sitting in heaven doing nothing but when he went up he came back down and God continues work because now if God is living there he promised that he will Purge your conscience from dead work it must come alive not just in a spiritual way but in a way in obeying truth it must come alive in a way where the from your heart you recognize Hallelujah and expresses God from your heart Hallelujah so much so Hall that God will be living on the inside and the Bible said to do what to get his bride perfect this Lamb by his own perfect promise you know he said he promised to sanctify the soul you know to it was God you know getting his life by the Holy Ghost living inside of us right and so the soul have to come alive in him you just forgive me a little bit you know I have so much of this here but but but it is Christ and that's what I want you to get tonight because now to get you get that man on the inside to express God in the way that God is expecting him to be expressed right there got to be a birth something got to happen on the inside and what I'm trying to do tonight is I'm trying to differentiate the church from the bride I'm trying to differentiate a man that to depict that that that Christ is there by by showcasing a spiritual you know uh manifestation I'm trying to show you that when he's there he brings that conscience alive is he become alive by God's word and so just a definition of of by the definition of your conscience I have it there he said the Saul as distinguishing between what is morally good and bad pumping to do the former and Sh the latter commending the one condemning the other conscience which joins moral and spiritual consciousness as part of being created in the Divine in the Divine image accordingly it's all people of this God's given capacity to know right from wrong because each is a free moral agency in other word by our own free moral agency we can adopt good principles you know we we see you know Christians they dress right they sing right they do all of these things that are right but on the basis of moral principle that doesn't mean that there's a conversion of the heart right that doesn't mean that you know that the holy ghost that blood that perfect sacrifice has reached the heart there's a little bit more than that and that is what is required I pray God that tonight we go into it but it is required because it is God's Perfection for his church so brother Ram said he said it is the beautiful picture of a moralist he said as we would think today of a man that tries to think is going to heaven just because but he quit gambling or maybe he quit running with running with woman and wasn't it was that wasn't his wife I stop is drinking he said h a New Year's Day are turning over a new leave and join church he said see you see he said it it doesn't it doesn't really it's it's a he really isn't converted he's just moralist and the devil use using moralist just is said just to go out and make a foolish representation he said when really he said the the real power of the living Christ isn't there no you can't imagine brother J you see all of that and it's good you know you sit among you come among a congregation and you adopt and it's good but he's saying that still is not enough and we have seen it you know many persons come in and they they just fall in line they they take on the church spirit and it's good but it requires a conversion because the blood got to reach the heart to change it to bring it into God's Conformity for perfection so brother bam said it's just a moral moralist and said and the devil using mless he said just go out it said and make foolish representation so when really the real power of the living Christ isn't there he say see the world is wanting to see Christ he said Jesus said I am the vine here are the branches and the branch bear record of the Vine because it draw its energy and life from the vine and well it said well the first Vine first branch that come from the vine he said they wrote a book of Acts behind that Branch he said we see the way the Holy Spirit acted in that first church it said the Church of Pentecost and they it said we believe that if they if the original vine have put forth another Branch they will write another book of Acts behind it because it's the same life in the in the vine Hallelujah and so if the holy spirit is acting to the church which I believe that there there's going to be another book of Acts written again in this same time and so if there's another book of Acts then the holy spirit will have to act himself Hallelujah from the inside out praise God Amen I quote again but said all right brother so you got your ecclesi ecclesiastical vest on he said listen for by one offering he said not every year it said not every Revival but by one offering he perfected he said perfected said till the next Revival he said he had perfected forever them that are Sanctified Hallelujah that therefore by the Holy Ghost also is a witness the Holy Ghost is a witness Hallelujah that something that had happened on the inside Hallelujah and he said do you get it Christ dying once for The Sinner and The Sinner once coming through the blood cell it said of the Dead lamb then the holy spirit that was in the cell of the Lamb returned back upon the believer as the Holy Ghost is a bearing record to our Sanctified belief in Christ God has perfected forever and he said amen it's a it's not by one who shake hand it's not by one emotion he said it's not by it's not the one time speaking with tongues or 10 times or a billion times it's a it's not the casting out of spirit it's it's not the preaching of the Gospel but the Living Sacrifice he said the Lord Jesus he brought in Fellowship forever those who are sanctify the god in time pass under the shadow just it's a Justified believer God saved but could not take away the guilt he said of the desire he said he said not desire he said said but the guilt of sin it said the guilt was there there was nothing for it to overcome by and so hallelujah amen and so it's not about the shaking of hands said it's not about speaking in tongues Hallelujah but God has given us a perfect sacrifice Hallelujah the sacrifice is perfect but said God does not see you and I he see the sacrifice because the sacrifice is perfect and you know what and because that the sacrifice was accepted and so your work can be accepted if you accept the sacrifice if we live with the sacrifice which is Christ the word on the inside then God will accept Hallelujah you not seeing you but seeing him we are living by his Perfection they very be church amen and so the Bible said this age the one that we're living in Paul he wrote in Hebrews 11 he said they without us cannot be made perfect you see this is the age of perfection so it's not about our work it's his work it's his blood is his cross it's his sacrifice is his death his burial his resurrection in other word this what I'm doing church I'm taking it off from us it's him Christ it's what he has done and so we can Rejoice not because we are good because he is good because what he had done and if you're sacrifi said we must be identified with the sacrifice we must be identified with Christ Our sacrifice and if we're identified with him Hallelujah you know what when he comes on the inside he comes Hallelujah to live and to express himself out which is where I want to go quickly tonight before I close I want to show you tonight if he's living there he must produce perfect work the work that is being performed that will be produced by him it won't be you anymore is Christ in you the hope of Glory Hallelujah because God have accepted that blood God have accepted but said there it is but said it's not you it's a it's him God don't even see you amen me see if I have it right he said God don't even see you he sees him he said don't you he said you don't have to die he died in your pace so if we have Perfection by the sacrifice living inside then you know what we can reach God's expectation Hallelujah because we can live by his Perfection so we say that the blood the covenanted blood H in the Old Testament it brought Perfection you see when we speak of perfection it's not just perfection living H subjected to the Perfection that put you into the path of overcoming because we know that the blood of the sacrifice cannot fail we saw in the Old Testament and you what I'm saying to you tonight church we saw in the Old Testament when though they had the blood of the sacrifice under the Old Testament and it wasn't something that could have brought perfection because it could not reach the soul because there was a remembrance of that right but even though they held on to it and by the Covenant of the test Testament it brought Redemption for them he said brother what are you saying to me I'm saying to you that the blood brings Perfection it works Church Hallelujah and there's power in the blood you see in the Old Testament they held on H to the Covenant the believe the sacrifice and all the ritual and all that they were doing they believed it and so when they died Hallelujah though they could not have gone in the presence of God but God acknowledged the work of Grace and so when they died the Bible said when Jesus the perfect sacrifice came came and when Jesus died the Bible said and the graves of those who slept H was ripped open and the dead came out why because the blood prevails and they came out Victorious why because the blood prevails hallelujah hallelujah Moses Hallelujah Abraham Abraham and Sarah came from the why because the blood prevails and so we know that this the the the the the sacrifice of the blood Hallelujah was able to take them all the way you said where did they went go after where they were resurrected but said Hallelujah they did not just go into the sixth Dimension but the blood Hallelujah of the Covenant it brought Perfection it brought them all the way from the dust to the Stars it brought them into the presence of God hallelujah so they overcame by the blood though it was not perfected but Church what about you and I tonight when we have that perfect sacrifice and if the blood can give them victory in the Old Testament then the blood H with that life that we have tonight living on the inside remove and Conquer by the blood hallelujah praise God because the blood prevails it brought Perfection it brought Resurrection it brought truth it brought healing it brought Deliverance how you there it me church and they overcame by the blood of the Lamb Hallelujah it took them all the way to the seventh dimension that's beautiful so when that sacrifice comes and living on the inside he comes to take us from this Mortal condition all the way into God's Perfection but you know what he's doing he's working on me he comes at the inside and he's changing me from the inside out right he's bringing the Perfection Hallelujah to take me all the way back into his presence complete restoration and Redemption Hallelujah so we know the blood of power Church power to save power to heal and power to deliver and so Paul quickly as we come down Paul you know in first Thessalonians 4 Paul said for this this this verse 15 I have it oh okay I think okay let me quote it 1 Thessalonians 4:1 15 that this we know we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall caught up together with with them in the cloud to meet the Lord in the he and so shall we ever be with the Lord so to our perfection in this in time in this last days Paul brother Bram spoke that the Lord himself no I don't know if you feel special but I feel I am feeling special that God did not send an angel to restore me to my true estate but the Lord himself the Bible said will descend and have descended right to do what to bring me back to my eternal home right and so when he descended what he came down where to do where to live he came down to live in you and so Hallelujah when he comes he comes to you he comes to live in you he comes Hallelujah to start to bring you to the process of of your Redemption how that you can be perfected by him living on on the inside so it's not us it's him because he has descended the perfect sacrifice the perfect blood the perfect Christ has descended to do what Hallelujah to come and dwell on the inside to do the work of redemption from the inside Hallelujah and so brother said so we see him by The Works he does they don't they couldn't believe that he was God so he said if you can't believe me believe the works that I do for the works that I do testify that the father sent me they couldn't believe a man being God that said just look at the Works he said if you do not if you do not the work of my father he said what did he meant by that he said I do if I do not the work of my father he said believe me not but if I do the work of my father then believe me he said the father testify of me he said what was the work of the father he said but said watch how accurate everything he said he said look exactly what he said and what he prophesied he said it was perfect you see church God came down to our prophet in the same time and God gave bream and H book it was the sword in hand which was the perfect interpretation of the word there's never been one instance brother testified of brother Mark he said show me one time one time it has ever failed it cannot fail because it's not brother Bram it's Christ God was living inside a man and because Christ was living there when he spoke thus said the Lord when he said when he prophesied it could not fail because God gave him the perfect work the perfect word to speak what am I saying to you tonight church I'm saying to you that the bride have received thus said the Lord that when brother left the scene he did not take Christ with him but Christ is here tonight to do what Hallelujah he said this bride must step into a Perfection she The Works must be performed again and it must be accurate it have to be truthful it have to be perfect and the only way the bride can bring forth perfect work Christ will have to be there but let me tell you tonight Church Hallelujah better said that the ministry of Jesus Christ that the bride has it and the bride will bring forth the work of Christ by the ministration that she will do the work of Christ Hallelujah and the work of Christ Hallelujah because it is perfection it will bring her into Perfection we are seeing imperfection but God is not seeing the imperfection God is not judging you and I by our imperfection but God is judging it by the sacrifice are you very and if Christ is living on the inside he will do the perfect work you know in these days really I I see it that God will do a work among the bride a perfect work and he will bring this bride into the position where she's ordained to step into because hallelujah it's no longer her it's him coming on the scene you remember what John said John said for high must decrease Hallelujah and he must increase so it's not us bringing ourself on the scene it's us stepping aside and bringing Christ on the scene you talk about victories and and healing and and virtues and power and all of these things all that the bride need is in her right now and The Works must be performed Jesus said the works that I do I don't do it of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the work and so this end time is calling for for the perfect work the perfect interpretation the per perfect God living in a in in a vessel of human flesh to bring forth himself to manifest himself and so when he does that you see the conscience must be a record that is there and the conscience how is that part of your soul that demonstrate the works or the evidence that Christ is living there it's not adopting a principle it's taking truth upon the word your conscience must bear record the truth is there and when your conscience Hallelujah is touched by that blood it brings forth the resurrection it shows that it's not a show it's not a public show it's Christ that is living there and Christ expressing himself on the outside so he he is here tonight to resurrect our consciences from dead Works to serve the Living God he's alive and well Church the Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah in our heart right now not when we reach to heaven right now the Bride of Jesus Christ God is living in Earth now by the Holy Ghost you know I in closing I had the experience in speaking with a lot of I've been to a lot of churches and I've seen a lot of things you know and I know exactly you know the information that is out there really but I've never seen another set of people that the Bride of Jesus Christ her love and her dedication to Christ the word it surpass everything that you can ever imagine I have no problem speaking about the Bride of Jesus Christ in the humble way of the under the leadership by the Holy Spirit you know why because I believe that God before the foundation of the world Hallelujah has ordained this bride to reflect himself by his perfect work and the words that are on the pages that must be reflected through her I believe that she has come alive by the word of God and so I'm I'm proud H to speak about the Bride of Jesus Christ you know I I remember brother Mark I was speaking to a friend of mine you know and you know telling inviting him to church I said listen our sisters are clean they dress right we don't have to tell them how to dress or anything like that they know exactly what to do you know why why they know that because Christ is living on the inside we don't have to worry you know you know sometime back home you know you you know you'll have you know people who they they will hide and do things and so you know like when they see Pastor coming they will start singing Christian songs and start you know shouting H Allelujah and all of that you don't have to do that really if Christ is there he will Express himself you sing Hallelujah pastor don't have to worry about the way you dress you why because you're living by the word and so if he's there tonight Church Hallelujah he comes to do a perfect work and by the perfect sacrifice he will bring you into Perfection God bless you tonight amen amen he's already making me look bad by finishing an under an hour so I'm going to take up his six minutes that he left for me amen that was wonderful I enjoyed that you know how I am I always have a couple things I like to to pull out there and I love how he started because when we start talking Perfection we can start putting pressure and the first thing he said is perfection is God's work it's not yours it's not yours it's letting go that's our work it's his work to work it's his work to do and those different things but as he was talking about the conscience and he didn't touch on it I was glad because it it left something for me to talk about he was talking about how the blood purges your conscience do you know at the end of this age everybody's going to have a clear conscience but it'll be by two different works one will be by the blood or one will be by the Searing of your conscience but either way there's going to be two groups of people and each one of them will do what they do by a clear conscience but one of them will be seared and one of them will be purged by the blood of God you know how we do it you know how we know who's who he said it he says the blood will take you to a path of overcoming cuz what I'm seeing today so much I everywhere everywhere is people are saying I can do whatever I want to and they do things that are contrary to the word why because they can't overcome it therefore it must be okay for me to do it but the blood comes in and it says no I can change your desires and then we've got a battle and if you'll let me do it we'll win the battle on a daily basis you won't desire to do the things that you used to do but this flesh is never converted and there'll be a battle but I'll give you overcoming Power by the Holy Spirit that's how you know your conscience has been purged rather than seared is you've come into overcoming rather than giving excuses amen you'll accept the word and you'll let it do a work work inside of you amen he said uh the blood prevails it works I don't know if you know what song I'm going to sing but I'm going to tell you now we're going to sing There Is Power in the Blood amen when the musicians come but it works and I I think that's one of the most beautiful things and you know I've talked I know brother Mark about this a lot this idea of we can over complicate what God does acts 238 has worked since the first day that the Holy Spirit was given and it hasn't stopped doing hasn't stopped working repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the Holy Ghost it works this word works this message Works we're not preaching a new message we're preaching Paul's message we're preaching the apostolic message we're preaching the original Pentecostal message and it still works today and I see it works because the works are here and it's his work it's not our work but I was listening to brother brandham the other morning and he said what holds him back he says what holds him back is that we can't wait and we try and manufacture the work that's his and his alone that's right and and too often I'm worried that I'm seeing that because we know what's supposed to happen we try and make it happen but it's got to be his time his way his season his strength his Spirit his word that does it you know when you look in the Book of Revelation the 2 and third chapter it says to him that overcometh and what did they have to do they had to receive what God sent for them and that did the work in their life that's all we have to do take what God has given us let him do the work and then he declares us perfect I don't declare myself perfect when he says you're perfect you're perfect whether or not you realize it whether or not you think it whether or not you believe it you're perfect when he says you are perfect and he said I'm going to have a bride that is without spot and without wrinkle and his word will perform what he said he would do amen God bless you I certainly enjoyed that tonight brother Garfield and hopefully you'll you'll find time to to minister for us again amen God bless you let's stand together if you would and we're going to sing that song There Is Power in the Blood [Music] oh would you be free from the burden of sin there's power in the blood oh Power in
