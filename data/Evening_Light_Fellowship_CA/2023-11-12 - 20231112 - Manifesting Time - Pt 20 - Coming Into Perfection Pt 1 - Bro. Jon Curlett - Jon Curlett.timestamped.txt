[46:32] them amen we want to remember brother
[46:34] Grant's mother especially amen that's a
[46:37] serious need that she has there and
[46:39] we're trusting that the Lord will just
[46:40] go and just Reach Out And Touch her body
[46:43] amen and Michael also very sick with
[46:45] brother brother Paul had and it's one
[46:47] thing to to be sick as an adult because
[46:49] you know there's an end coming but when
[46:51] you're a kid you just don't know and
[46:52] it's it's very much in the moment so we
[46:54] want to remember him and of course
[46:55] sister Kimberly there just by way of
[46:58] announcement brother Dale has also let
[46:59] us know that he won't be standing for
[47:01] trustee in the coming year and uh I'll
[47:04] say this brother Dale I think you landed
[47:05] at exactly the right time and you came
[47:08] here and you put your shoulder to the
[47:09] wheel and and you made a huge difference
[47:12] so we thank you for your service but
[47:14] he's not stepping back from helping he
[47:15] just doesn't feel to be the trustee he's
[47:17] still going to be providing the muscle
[47:19] and the support as he always has so we
[47:21] appreciate that so if you feel that you
[47:24] could hold that position or if you know
[47:26] somebody that you think should take that
[47:27] position just have a chat with the
[47:29] deacons or send an email or a text
[47:31] however you want to reach out to them
[47:32] and just let them know who you think
[47:34] could could do that or if you want to do
[47:36] it that's even better we love a
[47:37] volunteer in these positions but uh
[47:40] we're thankful for each one that served
[47:41] and and there's no obligation there's no
[47:44] obligation for these things it's you
[47:46] know many of us and you put in your time
[47:48] and then your time's done and it's not
[47:50] wrong to to think it's bad to do that
[47:52] and it goes for Ministry it goes for the
[47:54] positions in the church no matter what
[47:55] it is so we just thank the Lord for each
[47:57] one that's that's been serving and
[47:59] continues to serve and when your time is
[48:01] done then we'll say praise the Lord and
[48:03] we'll look for others to take your place
[48:04] as well so God bless you each one amen 1
[48:07] Corinthians chapter 12 bit of a longer
[48:09] scripture this morning as we open up so
[48:11] hold your Bibles here 1 Corinthians 12
[48:14] and 27 just another thing I have changed
[48:16] the slides back to a darker slide with
[48:19] with white text and uh I I didn't go
[48:21] with a black background I went with a
[48:23] gray so hopefully this is a good kind of
[48:25] inet for those that have you know
[48:27] struggle to see from the back and then
[48:28] those that find it bright so if you if
[48:30] you like it let me know if you don't
[48:31] like it let me know and and uh we
[48:34] probably won't do a thing because we've
[48:35] gone back and forth now and this is the
[48:36] best I can probably do amen 1
[48:39] Corinthians 12 and 27 says this now ye
[48:42] are the body of Christ and members in
[48:45] particular we're speaking we've been
[48:46] speaking on the stature of a perfect man
[48:48] and Paul says ye are the body of Christ
[48:51] he says and God hath set some in the
[48:52] church first apostles secondarily
[48:55] prophets phets thirdly teachers after
[48:57] that Miracles then Gifts of healings
[49:00] helps governments diversities of tongues
[49:03] then he says are all Apostles are all
[49:05] prophets are all teachers are all
[49:08] workers of
[49:09] Miracles we look
[49:11] around is everybody everything does
[49:14] everybody have every gift we can't have
[49:16] every person to minister we can't have
[49:18] everybody doing the same thing and we
[49:20] can't have everybody that has everything
[49:21] otherwise why do we need a body but he
[49:23] says look around not everybody has has
[49:25] something like that and certainly not
[49:28] all of them have all of them he says
[49:29] have all the gifts of healing do all
[49:31] speak with tongues do all interpret he
[49:34] says but covet earnestly the best gifts
[49:36] there's nothing wrong with Desiring in
[49:38] fact he says you should desire the best
[49:41] gifts not for yourself but for others
[49:44] but then he says and yet show I unto you
[49:46] a more excellent way there's only one
[49:49] other place in scripture we see that and
[49:51] that's with Cain and Abel and I liked
[49:53] how I think it was Brother David Nash
[49:54] brought this out that Cain's sacrifice
[49:57] was excellent but it was out of order in
[50:00] other words he didn't do the sacrifice
[50:02] first he brought the first fruits and
[50:04] you had to bring the sacrifice you
[50:06] needed your sins covered before you
[50:08] could bring the first fruits and what
[50:09] Paul's saying here is he's saying you've
[50:11] got to be careful that you don't bring
[50:12] the first fruits ahead of the
[50:15] sacrifice so then we'll continue on in 1
[50:17] Corinthians 13 chapter 1 this is the
[50:20] more excellent way that Paul is talking
[50:22] about he says though I speak with the
[50:24] tongue of men and in and of angels and
[50:26] have not charity I am become as sounding
[50:29] brass or a tinkling symbol and though I
[50:31] have the gift of Prophecy and understand
[50:33] all Mysteries and all knowledge and
[50:35] though I have all Faith so that I could
[50:38] move remove mountains and have not
[50:39] charity I am nothing and though I bestow
[50:43] all my goods to feed the poor and though
[50:45] I give my body to be burned and have not
[50:47] charity it profiteth the mean nothing
[50:50] down to verse 8 but he says charity
[50:53] never faileth but whether there be
[50:55] prophecies they shall fail whether there
[50:57] be tongues they shall cease whether
[50:59] there be knowledge it shall vanish away
[51:02] for we know in part and we prophesy in
[51:05] part but when that which is perfect is
[51:07] come then that which is in part shall be
[51:11] done away he said when I was a child I
[51:13] spake as a child I understood as a child
[51:17] I thought as a child but when I became a
[51:19] man I put away childish things amen God
[51:22] bless you you can have your seats this
[51:24] morning and we're continuing on our
[51:26] series on manifesting time and I want to
[51:28] take a title this morning of coming into
[51:30] Perfection and and again we're speaking
[51:32] on the attributes of Charity and as I've
[51:34] said before there's lots of pieces lots
[51:36] of chunks with this and so we're going
[51:38] to cover another aspect of that this
[51:39] morning but as I said last service
[51:41] there's many angles to this when Peter
[51:43] said add charity to your life and we're
[51:45] going to talk about this thought of
[51:46] perfection for the next couple of
[51:48] services Lord willing and I know that
[51:50] there were a few that weren't there so
[51:52] just to do a brief you know recoup of
[51:54] what we covered last services that word
[51:56] charity that that he uses there is the
[51:58] Greek word agape and it means divine
[52:00] love and it is only used in the New
[52:02] Testament it's never used in the Old
[52:05] Testament and we show that that was
[52:07] because charity is is is personified in
[52:09] the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost was not
[52:12] given before the New Testament before
[52:14] the New Covenant and so you couldn't see
[52:16] the expression you couldn't get the
[52:18] experience of True Divine love in the
[52:21] Holy Ghost until the New Testament so
[52:22] the word wasn't used in the Old
[52:24] Testament cuz the love they were under
[52:26] was different it all God's love and God
[52:28] has always been love and we talked about
[52:30] that but but this this this experience
[52:33] of divine love the ability to have that
[52:35] in your life did not happen until the
[52:37] day of Pentecost until Christ paid the
[52:39] price on Calvary and made a way back
[52:41] then we could not experience this Divine
[52:43] love and we could not project this
[52:45] Divine love more importantly until we
[52:47] had a new birth
[52:49] experience and so th this isn't just an
[52:51] attribute this charity is not just an
[52:53] attribute but it's the life of Jesus
[52:55] Christ Living inside of the believer
[52:57] it's the holy spirit inside of you
[53:00] producing the life of God and it flows
[53:03] out of you it doesn't just come into you
[53:04] so you have to receive charity in order
[53:07] to give charity you have to receive the
[53:08] Holy Ghost in order to give the Holy
[53:10] Ghost if I can put it that way and then
[53:12] we read where where John said un or
[53:14] Jesus said unless you're born of God and
[53:17] know God you can't have this Divine love
[53:19] so you have to have a you have to have a
[53:21] new birth and the only way you can have
[53:24] a new birth is to receive the Holy Ghost
[53:26] and then he says and then you have to
[53:28] know God in order to have this Divine
[53:30] love and that's a personal intimate
[53:32] experience and we talked about how that
[53:33] was a relationship between a man and a
[53:35] woman and it's this invisible Union that
[53:37] brother brandham talks about between the
[53:39] the the Earthly bride and the Heavenly
[53:40] bridegroom so this is all what's going
[53:43] inside of this is that you've got to
[53:45] have God to give God you've got to have
[53:47] love to give love and it's all one and
[53:49] the same thing the very attribute the
[53:51] very nature of God is love and so unless
[53:54] you have God you can't love the way that
[53:56] you're supposed to and we said it last
[53:57] service I believe that you can't truly
[53:59] love unless you have the Holy Ghost you
[54:01] can't do it and we know that you can't
[54:03] because we see what love has done to
[54:05] this world Amen welcome our brother
[54:06] Kingsley back all the way from Nigeria
[54:08] God bless you
[54:10] amen now we know that this this this
[54:13] holy spirit is reserved only for the
[54:15] children of God it's only reserved for
[54:17] the children of God Amen origin is
[54:19] Destin Destiny brother Brian would say
[54:21] and if you weren't a part of God in the
[54:23] beginning you can't be a part of God at
[54:24] the end so so so that doesn't mean
[54:27] though that you can't get eternal life
[54:28] if you're not a part of God cuz there's
[54:30] going to be a great white Throne
[54:31] judgment that comes and we'll be judged
[54:33] by works whoever doesn't make it in in
[54:35] in the resurrection and the Rapture they
[54:37] come before this throne and there's
[54:38] going to be people that are given
[54:40] eternal life they're granted eternal
[54:43] life the scripture says they don't have
[54:45] it but they're given it and it's because
[54:48] they did something for the bride for the
[54:50] children of God and most of them did it
[54:52] unknowingly they didn't realize that
[54:54] they' done something for somebody that
[54:56] mattered in the eyes of God and God has
[54:58] no unpaid debts God doesn't pay for like
[55:01] for like God gives you more than what
[55:03] you deserve cuz that's the kind of God
[55:05] that he is that means there's a place
[55:07] for every single person potentially but
[55:10] we know they won't take it we know they
[55:12] won't take it but yet there is a place
[55:14] but for you and I we're not granted
[55:16] eternal life the scripture says we are
[55:18] ordained unto eternal life we are
[55:21] promised eternal life because before the
[55:23] foundation of the world was God thought
[55:26] of us we were a part of his mind we were
[55:28] a part of his word and so we're just an
[55:30] expression of eternal life in this age
[55:33] so we're not granted it we are it we
[55:35] have it we're a part of it and it's just
[55:37] a natural thing for us and under the new
[55:39] birth what happens is the life the
[55:41] eternal life comes into our body and it
[55:43] quickens us and it makes us live the way
[55:45] that we were supposed to live but it
[55:47] takes a salvational experience it takes
[55:48] a new birth experience to remind us of
[55:50] who and what we are but I look at both
[55:53] groups and I say that's Grace
[55:55] because listen God's allowing people
[55:57] into his house that aren't his family
[55:59] and that's Grace to them but it's Grace
[56:01] to me because if we go by what I live
[56:03] this in this earth and what you live in
[56:05] this earth we don't deserve eternal life
[56:07] this is nothing about deserving it but
[56:09] rather we were a part of it and that's
[56:11] why we get to have it amen it's a
[56:13] beautiful thing but John concluded all
[56:15] this he says you can't love unless
[56:17] you've been born of God and you know God
[56:19] and then Jesus comes along and he says
[56:21] it's only my true church that gets to
[56:22] experience this we talked about how he
[56:24] said to the disciples to you it is given
[56:26] to know to understand to be a part of
[56:29] the kingdom of God he says they don't do
[56:31] it and that's why I speak to them in
[56:32] Parables that's why it's riddles to them
[56:34] is because they're not meant for it
[56:35] you're not they're not part of that
[56:37] group but I want you to catch what the
[56:39] prophet of God would say in the token
[56:40] message here because we can think that
[56:42] because we're under the hearing of the
[56:44] message that makes us bride and I
[56:47] believe God has given us a message to
[56:49] call out a bride but not all that hear
[56:50] it are are members of the Bride there's
[56:52] lots of people went to Brother Braham
[56:54] Services there's lot lot of people went
[56:55] to Jesus services and were not in the
[56:57] upper room and never came into a new
[56:59] birth experience listen to what the
[57:01] prophet of God said this is for us he's
[57:02] preaching the token now he says don't
[57:05] just come this far and say I believe the
[57:07] message he says you obey the messenger
[57:12] and what does that mean he says come
[57:14] into Christ because remember here what
[57:16] the spirit saith unto the churches it's
[57:18] not just to hear it but it's to
[57:20] understand it and it's to take it into
[57:22] your life and Obey it and make it a part
[57:24] of your life to say I've recognized that
[57:26] Malachi 4 has come is not mean you're a
[57:28] member of the Bride you've got to obey
[57:31] the messenger you've got to obey him
[57:33] because the Holy Spirit speaking through
[57:35] him trying to get us back into Christ
[57:37] trying to get us back into our place of
[57:38] origin he says so obey the messenger
[57:41] coming to Christ you say well I believe
[57:43] every word said brother Brandon I
[57:46] believe you're a prophet I believe every
[57:47] word you
[57:48] said that's good but that's just being
[57:51] able to read take the message take it
[57:53] into your heart that that you must have
[57:55] the token the very life that was in
[57:58] Christ be in you he says when I see that
[58:01] I will pass over you he says now you got
[58:04] truth but you got to come to it
[58:06] different than just something to be
[58:08] hollering about and I believe in
[58:10] hollering about it it has got something
[58:12] to to holler about But be sure you
[58:14] approach that with the very depths of
[58:16] sincerity if you live a different life
[58:19] than what you should live he says keep
[58:22] still until you get that life he says
[58:25] when it gets to living in you then it's
[58:29] automatically you don't have to put it
[58:31] on and then we're going to talk a bit
[58:32] about that this morning we don't have to
[58:34] put this on we don't have to to try and
[58:36] make it happen this is something that
[58:38] ought to be flowing out of the
[58:39] believer's lives each and every one of
[58:41] us amen remember we read that quote last
[58:43] service where brother bam says that that
[58:45] you can that that Satan can impersonate
[58:47] every gift and then he said these things
[58:49] that we're talking about have to be God
[58:50] sent and God born I'll just take the
[58:52] clips here so we can read it he says
[58:54] Satan can impersonate any kind of a gift
[58:57] that God has got but he cannot bring
[58:59] that word word by word he can't build up
[59:02] a Believer he can't he can't create Us
[59:04] in the stature of a perfect man he can't
[59:06] change us into the word because he's a
[59:08] thief and a liar and a a Tormentor and a
[59:10] destroyer he can only break us down he
[59:13] can't build us up he says that's where
[59:16] he failed in the Garden of Eden and
[59:17] that's where he's always failed and then
[59:19] he he says Satan can impersonate but
[59:21] then he comes to us and he says you
[59:23] can't impersonate them
[59:26] you can't imitate them they've got to be
[59:28] godsent and God born imitation only
[59:31] cause confusion he's not saying it's
[59:32] impossible to imitate them he's saying
[59:34] the imitation will never work we've got
[59:37] to be able to say I am where I
[59:40] am and thank God for where we are but
[59:43] don't rest on where we are but say
[59:45] there's more for me because the word
[59:47] says there's more for me amen there
[59:50] there there are there are aspects as we
[59:51] go into this today I mean every time I
[59:53] read the charity chap chapter it causes
[59:55] you to question where I'm really at in
[59:57] your Christian walk in my Christian walk
[59:59] because the standard is so high but you
[1:00:02] got to realize that this is the more
[1:00:04] excellent way it's the way of
[1:00:07] perfection Perfection is the standard
[1:00:11] that's the standard is perfection and
[1:00:13] we'll get into why maybe perhaps we
[1:00:15] don't hit the mark all the time but but
[1:00:17] I I I'm not trying to break down our
[1:00:19] confidence this morning but I'm getting
[1:00:20] us to say Lord there's more for me I
[1:00:23] want to go high Lord I want to step into
[1:00:26] what this really means to be in the Holy
[1:00:28] Ghost to have the Holy Ghost living
[1:00:29] inside of me amen because the preaching
[1:00:32] of the word ought to call us to a higher
[1:00:33] level absolutely it ought to call us to
[1:00:36] a higher level and it ought to wash out
[1:00:37] the things of our life that ought not to
[1:00:39] be there so let's go into this charity
[1:00:41] chapter in 1 Corinthians 13 and Paul
[1:00:44] says this he says though I speak with
[1:00:46] the tongues of men and of angels that's
[1:00:48] so that that's speaking of though I
[1:00:50] though I can preach though I can give a
[1:00:53] sermon though though I have a great
[1:00:55] delivery and of angels though I speak
[1:00:57] with tongues though I speak in other
[1:00:59] languages though I have the gift of
[1:01:01] those things he says and have not
[1:01:03] charity I am become a sounding brass or
[1:01:05] a tinkling symbol now that that that
[1:01:07] phrase sounding brass and tinkling
[1:01:09] symbol doesn't mean much to us today but
[1:01:11] you got to realize in the old days they
[1:01:13] use these things to draw attention and
[1:01:15] that word in the Amplified says I'm only
[1:01:17] a noisy gong or a clanging symbol now I
[1:01:22] think most of us have been intelligent
[1:01:24] enough not to buy our children a drum
[1:01:28] set especially with
[1:01:30] symbols why because that's the loudest
[1:01:33] noisiest most irritating sound if it's
[1:01:36] not played correctly and if you ever
[1:01:38] watch a drummer play the symbols are
[1:01:41] minimized rather than maximized but Paul
[1:01:43] says if I have all these things these
[1:01:45] tongues these gifts and I don't have
[1:01:47] Divine love I don't have a gape love I
[1:01:50] am like a Gong a noisy gong amen you if
[1:01:54] you've ever given a child something like
[1:01:56] that you don't have to give a child
[1:01:57] something like that they'll find
[1:01:59] something that hits another thing and it
[1:02:01] makes a loud noise and they love it they
[1:02:03] love it and they'll hit it and hit it
[1:02:05] and hit it until you want to hit them
[1:02:07] that's the way it goes because why it's
[1:02:10] somebody that's making sounds but not
[1:02:12] making music amen there's no rhyme to it
[1:02:15] there's no rhythm to it there's nothing
[1:02:17] about it it's just drawing attention to
[1:02:19] them but it's not it's not doing
[1:02:22] anything for the hearers Paul says if I
[1:02:24] do all these things and I don't have
[1:02:26] Divine love I don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:02:29] it's as if I'm beating a Gong next to
[1:02:31] you and guess what nobody likes a Gong
[1:02:35] nobody has a Gong in their house for
[1:02:37] their family to play on a regular basis
[1:02:39] there's nothing about a Gong a Gong is
[1:02:41] meant to draw
[1:02:42] attention amen but it's meant to draw
[1:02:45] attention it's meant to compliment
[1:02:48] rather than just be a loud loud banging
[1:02:50] sound amen it's selfish it's egocentric
[1:02:53] it's it's childish to beat on a Gong
[1:02:56] with other people around it's not polite
[1:02:58] it's not the way to do things but what
[1:02:59] does that mean today what because you
[1:03:02] know you say well what is that what is
[1:03:03] that going to look like in my life or in
[1:03:05] our lives prophet of God puts it this
[1:03:07] way he says when the World Council and
[1:03:09] all that's going on today that says the
[1:03:11] days of Miracles is passed the great
[1:03:13] powers of God have been taken out of the
[1:03:15] churches they seem like anymore they
[1:03:17] don't have nothing but a sounding brass
[1:03:19] and a tinkling symbol he says we know
[1:03:21] that to be the truth he says it's a form
[1:03:23] of godliness and denying the power
[1:03:26] thereof that that's what it means to be
[1:03:28] a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol
[1:03:30] and then he'd repeat that that scripture
[1:03:32] we just said and he said see it's
[1:03:36] nothing it's nothing listen Church
[1:03:39] Pentecostal he says it's nothing it's a
[1:03:41] hybrid seed it can't come to the word
[1:03:46] it's all noise but no results it's all
[1:03:49] lips and no life it's all words and no
[1:03:52] Works amen it's all words and no walk
[1:03:56] it's lots of things coming out but it's
[1:03:58] not actually doing anything it's not
[1:04:01] producing anything lasting it's not
[1:04:03] producing anything Eternal and what does
[1:04:05] he say it's because it's hybrid they've
[1:04:07] Blended something else in with it and
[1:04:09] all it becomes is a show it becomes a
[1:04:11] noise it becomes a a you know a circus
[1:04:14] whatever you want to call it amen what's
[1:04:16] he saying you got to have the Holy Ghost
[1:04:18] you've got to have this Divine love to
[1:04:20] lead these things in your life to take
[1:04:22] them to where they need to be otherwise
[1:04:24] it just becomes a performance of your
[1:04:26] side and that's never going to work it's
[1:04:28] never going to work and ultimately these
[1:04:30] things fail and we see them fail like I
[1:04:32] said I've spent so quite some time
[1:04:34] looking at different denominations and
[1:04:36] seeing what they're doing and how
[1:04:37] they're doing it and some of them have
[1:04:39] amazing I I was watching a service the
[1:04:42] just a little while ago and you talk
[1:04:44] about
[1:04:45] beautiful they got like eight people on
[1:04:48] cameras walking around they got light
[1:04:50] shows going on their sound is perfectly
[1:04:53] synced
[1:04:55] everybody's in Perfect Harmony in the
[1:04:59] music for an hour and a half and then
[1:05:02] they do a 20-minute childish sermon but
[1:05:05] beautiful we couldn't touch it guys
[1:05:08] coming down you know and sister Morin's
[1:05:10] playing on the piano and they're coming
[1:05:12] in and they're zooming in on the
[1:05:13] beautiful hands perfectly manicured you
[1:05:15] know great great jewelry on right just
[1:05:19] setting a
[1:05:20] mood wonderful lighting and with is it
[1:05:24] ikabod is written over the door the
[1:05:27] glory of the Lord has departed and all
[1:05:29] they've got left now is a
[1:05:30] production but what a production Church
[1:05:33] what a production it was fantastic I was
[1:05:36] in awe I can't imagine the money and
[1:05:38] time that they spent to get that service
[1:05:40] to that level of perfection and yet the
[1:05:43] Holy Ghost isn't there but what a
[1:05:46] beautiful thing but there's a more
[1:05:47] excellent way there's a more excellent
[1:05:51] way Paul's talking about himself Paul
[1:05:53] said says though I give he didn't say
[1:05:56] you he said though I give Paul's looking
[1:05:58] at himself and if there's one thing I
[1:06:00] want us to get this morning look at
[1:06:02] yourself I'm not looking at you I'm
[1:06:04] looking at me when I preach this you you
[1:06:07] study this you talk about knock you back
[1:06:08] a bit this humbles me to to read this
[1:06:11] sort of thing the prophet of the age
[1:06:13] says though I do this and don't have it
[1:06:15] I'm nothing that means though I do it
[1:06:17] and then I don't have nothing either I
[1:06:19] am nothing these different things he
[1:06:21] says though I have the gift of Prophecy
[1:06:23] and understand all Mysteries and all
[1:06:26] knowledge and though I have all Faith so
[1:06:28] that I could remove mountains and have
[1:06:30] not charity I'm nothing you know there
[1:06:32] was something Brother David said last
[1:06:34] week last weekend when he was talking
[1:06:35] about flipping the the uh the words
[1:06:38] around to give it an effect and I did
[1:06:40] that here and I'm going to give you the
[1:06:41] inverted revision this is the Jonathan
[1:06:43] klet revision to this just to to punch
[1:06:45] this up a little bit and and go this way
[1:06:48] and say and if I have not charity I am
[1:06:52] nothing even though I have the gift of
[1:06:55] Prophecy understand all Mysteries all
[1:06:57] knowledge and though I have all Faith so
[1:06:58] that I could remove mountains if I don't
[1:07:00] have this Divine love and I have every
[1:07:02] single one of those things I am nothing
[1:07:07] I'm nothing listen we believe in the
[1:07:11] Supernatural we believe in the absolute
[1:07:13] Supernatural power of God we believe it
[1:07:16] in this church we've prayed for things
[1:07:17] we've had healings we've had Deliverance
[1:07:19] we've had things cast out of people in
[1:07:21] the last couple of months we have seen
[1:07:22] the Lord move in lives we've seen
[1:07:24] provision we've seen all of these
[1:07:25] different things coming through we've
[1:07:27] prayed for things and they have happened
[1:07:30] we have asked for things and God has
[1:07:32] given it amen we have seen the hand of
[1:07:34] God moving and we see things changing
[1:07:36] and we love what God is doing in our
[1:07:38] midst now now I haven't heard anybody
[1:07:41] that has a gift of Prophecy here as far
[1:07:42] as I know but if somebody were to raise
[1:07:46] up in this congregation and they would
[1:07:47] say thus sayeth the Lord and they would
[1:07:49] give a prophecy and it would happen and
[1:07:51] this happened time and time again we'd
[1:07:52] say praise the Lord that person would
[1:07:55] gain a measure of respect probably and
[1:07:57] appreciation that they didn't have
[1:07:58] before because we'd say the spirit of
[1:08:00] the Lord is upon them they've got a gift
[1:08:02] of Prophecy in their life and that would
[1:08:03] be an amazing thing wouldn't it that
[1:08:06] would be an amazing thing and and maybe
[1:08:08] I would stand here a brother Grant or
[1:08:09] some other minister would get up here
[1:08:11] like brother brandham and somebody would
[1:08:12] come up with a tumor or something and we
[1:08:14] laid hands and that tumor would drop off
[1:08:17] well we couldn't stay we wouldn't be
[1:08:19] able to stay in the
[1:08:21] seats of course we wouldn't the the V
[1:08:23] ible Supernatural hand of God doing
[1:08:26] something if if if crossed eyes were
[1:08:28] straightened or an eyeball was put back
[1:08:30] in I was listening to um um uh God in
[1:08:33] Simplicity this morning and brother Bram
[1:08:34] says Lord we thank you for what you did
[1:08:37] for that woman that had a shortened leg
[1:08:38] and a shortened foot she had a shortened
[1:08:41] leg straightened in
[1:08:43] service you talk about the power of the
[1:08:47] Supernatural and Paul's saying though I
[1:08:49] have all of
[1:08:52] this I have nothing
[1:08:55] without this Divine love many times you
[1:08:57] you know we talk about the the third
[1:08:59] poll and spoken word and and scriptural
[1:09:02] and word authority and casting out
[1:09:04] demons and sicknesses run immediately
[1:09:06] before our prayer and things happen as
[1:09:08] soon as we call on it and we think that
[1:09:10] that is what we're looking for and
[1:09:12] that's going to be the proof of us being
[1:09:14] the great elect bride and Paul says you
[1:09:18] can have all of that and be
[1:09:21] nothing the thing is are we looking for
[1:09:23] the ex ENT way or are we looking for the
[1:09:25] more excellent
[1:09:26] way because the more excellent way will
[1:09:29] challenge you way more than the
[1:09:30] excellent way absolutely it's a
[1:09:32] challenge for you on the inside because
[1:09:34] it's not just a work now but it's
[1:09:36] something where you've got to surrender
[1:09:38] and you've got to die out and you've got
[1:09:39] to give where you don't receive amen
[1:09:42] it's something coming out of you it's
[1:09:44] something flowing through you as opposed
[1:09:46] to something that builds you up listen
[1:09:48] I'm going to be honest if I if some some
[1:09:49] person came up to here to and there's a
[1:09:51] tumor and I prayed and it fell off
[1:09:54] that would I I'd be on a high for a
[1:09:57] year not because I did it but because
[1:10:01] God answered our prayer in that kind of
[1:10:03] a way but let's be honest I'd probably
[1:10:06] take some of that to myself in some way
[1:10:09] or some fashion it would probably
[1:10:11] connect to me and you know what this is
[1:10:13] streaming you know what that could share
[1:10:15] if that happened on live video that' get
[1:10:17] shared around the world 30 million times
[1:10:19] eventually and what would it do it would
[1:10:21] boost me
[1:10:22] up but that is not what Christ is
[1:10:25] looking for in a bride the glory is
[1:10:27] supposed to go to him the worship and
[1:10:29] the praise is supposed to go to him and
[1:10:30] so what we love about all these things
[1:10:32] he's talking about gifts of Prophecy
[1:10:35] understand all Mysteries come up here
[1:10:36] preach the lights out and you're like
[1:10:38] whoa he knows so
[1:10:40] much it's all me people look at me but
[1:10:45] when we get to charity the way it's
[1:10:47] meant to be
[1:10:48] preached it's only Christ because you're
[1:10:52] so far out of that picture it's not
[1:10:54] going to make you look good in the way
[1:10:55] that we want to look good many times
[1:10:57] it's going to cause you to humble
[1:10:58] yourself it's going to cause you to lay
[1:11:00] yourself down it's going to allow you to
[1:11:01] be offended it's going to allow you to
[1:11:03] be hurt and there's no glory in that and
[1:11:06] that's the way it's supposed to be
[1:11:07] there's no glory in this amen the
[1:11:10] Excellence remember we have this
[1:11:12] treasure in Earth and vessels that the
[1:11:13] Excellency may be of him it's him from
[1:11:16] start to finish amen amen listen we look
[1:11:20] look Judas is scariot have power over
[1:11:23] sickness
[1:11:24] and demons let me put it this way Judas
[1:11:27] scariot probably had greater signs and
[1:11:29] wonders than I ever
[1:11:32] will balum had a greater gift in terms
[1:11:37] of the supernatural than I probably ever
[1:11:39] will and yet neither one of those men
[1:11:41] was a child of God but they had
[1:11:44] something that Paul was talking about
[1:11:45] here they had signs and wonders they had
[1:11:48] gifts they had prophecy they had all of
[1:11:49] these things and yet in their soul there
[1:11:52] was nothing to reflect
[1:11:54] God and it led them down a path and
[1:11:56] that's why we read later there in in 1
[1:11:58] Corinthians 13 He says these things will
[1:12:00] pass away they'll stop they'll fail
[1:12:02] because eventually we're going to get
[1:12:03] ourselves interjected into it blended
[1:12:05] into it it'll hybridize it and it'll die
[1:12:09] because that's what happens without the
[1:12:10] Holy Ghost in our life as we start
[1:12:12] making it about us amen the question is
[1:12:15] this because remember we have excellent
[1:12:17] to more excellent if you lead with
[1:12:20] excellent you'll never get to more
[1:12:22] excellent remember signs and wonders
[1:12:25] these signs shall follow them that
[1:12:27] believe you've got to come into a place
[1:12:30] of believing before they can come we
[1:12:32] don't lead with signs and wonders they
[1:12:34] follow with signs and wonders and what
[1:12:35] Paul is saying here is he says you're
[1:12:36] focused so much on what follows you that
[1:12:38] you haven't focused on what's get you
[1:12:40] into it in the first place you got to
[1:12:41] come to this place of divine love you
[1:12:43] got to come to this place of Charity
[1:12:45] amen we're seeking greater demonstration
[1:12:48] and Paul's saying there's a more
[1:12:49] excellent way than demonstration and if
[1:12:51] you get that then the demonstrations
[1:12:53] will follow follow behind listen to this
[1:12:55] he says don't judge a man because he can
[1:12:57] pray a prayer of faith for the sick and
[1:12:58] they get well don't judge a man because
[1:13:01] he might do some Supernatural Miracle as
[1:13:03] being a sainted person but the only way
[1:13:05] that you can judge the only way that you
[1:13:08] can judge is by the love that they have
[1:13:10] for Christ and for each other oh I love
[1:13:14] Christ do you love your fellow brothers
[1:13:16] and
[1:13:17] sisters one and the same it's the same
[1:13:20] body it's all Christ
[1:13:24] he says and do you see what the Holy
[1:13:26] Spirit has to bring to the father that
[1:13:28] we're all separated no love for each
[1:13:29] other he's speaking on adoption much in
[1:13:31] the series on hear ye himym and he says
[1:13:33] that's what the Holy Spirit has to take
[1:13:35] back the tutor has to take back to the
[1:13:36] father is that they love you but they
[1:13:38] don't love each other something wrong
[1:13:40] somewhere he says the world wants to see
[1:13:43] a display of
[1:13:48] love what's Paul telling us he's saying
[1:13:52] when God gives you the Holy Ghost he
[1:13:53] gives you the greatest gift you can ever
[1:13:56] get it's not prophecy it's not tongues
[1:13:59] it's not interpretation it's not
[1:14:01] healings it's not Faith it's not
[1:14:02] Mysteries when he gives you the Holy
[1:14:04] Ghost he gives you the greatest thing he
[1:14:06] can give you and without it all those
[1:14:09] other things will fall by the wayside
[1:14:11] and they'll
[1:14:12] fail they won't take you anywhere not
[1:14:15] that you don't have a genuine gift but
[1:14:17] the soul is not sealed and that means
[1:14:19] that you're what potentially going to be
[1:14:21] controlled by something other than the
[1:14:22] Holy Spirit of EV cuz it's not sealed
[1:14:25] somebody else can come in and out
[1:14:26] somebody else can can can take control
[1:14:28] over you amen whereas
[1:14:30] you you may never lay hands on the sick
[1:14:35] you may never raise the dead but you'll
[1:14:37] live a life that nobody else can live
[1:14:40] and that's the first sign of the
[1:14:41] believer is the life that they live not
[1:14:44] the things that they do outside of that
[1:14:46] it's do you live according to the word
[1:14:49] and that takes the holy spirit in your
[1:14:51] life we commented on this before last
[1:14:54] service but to read it again in Matthew
[1:14:56] 7 he says not everyone that saith unto
[1:14:57] me Lord Lord shall enter into the
[1:14:59] kingdom of heaven but he that doth the
[1:15:01] will of My Father which is in heaven
[1:15:03] many will say to me in that day Lord
[1:15:05] Lord have not we prophesied in thy name
[1:15:08] and in thy name cast out devils and in
[1:15:10] thy name done many wonderful works and
[1:15:13] then will I profess unto them I never
[1:15:14] knew you depart from me you that work
[1:15:16] iniquity Paul was just repeating what
[1:15:18] Jesus said when he said though you have
[1:15:21] all those things and you don't have
[1:15:22] Divine love you're nothing he he didn't
[1:15:25] make this up this is just repeating what
[1:15:27] Jesus said and Jesus said without me
[1:15:30] your works are
[1:15:31] meaningless without me you're going to
[1:15:34] go in the wrong direction it doesn't
[1:15:35] mean you're not going to do works but
[1:15:37] they're not going to be in line with the
[1:15:38] will of God and if you don't have the
[1:15:40] Holy Ghost the will of God is foreign to
[1:15:42] you you can't find it because you don't
[1:15:45] have that Compass inside you don't have
[1:15:46] that guing and you're it's like shooting
[1:15:48] in the dark you might hit something but
[1:15:50] you're never going to hit the target and
[1:15:51] you're never going to hit the target in
[1:15:52] the middle that's for sure just blindly
[1:15:54] shooting in the dark cuz there's no
[1:15:55] light to guide you there's nothing to
[1:15:57] show you where you're supposed to go
[1:15:59] brother man puts it this way in power of
[1:16:00] transformation he says iniquity is
[1:16:02] something that you know you ought to do
[1:16:04] and you won't do it you know better but
[1:16:06] you won't do it you know they should
[1:16:08] stay with the word of God but for the
[1:16:10] church's sake or somebody else's sake or
[1:16:12] something else you'll stray from the
[1:16:13] word of God and do what the organization
[1:16:15] says well I don't know my church says we
[1:16:17] should do it this way and I believe it
[1:16:19] this way see and it's right before you
[1:16:21] that you shouldn't do it that's iniquity
[1:16:23] he said depart from me ye that work
[1:16:25] iniquity look at the great St Paul in 1
[1:16:27] Corinthians 13 He said though I speak
[1:16:29] with the tongue of men and angels He
[1:16:31] says now you want or somebody want to
[1:16:33] lay on to that like it's the evidence of
[1:16:34] the Holy Ghost Paul said though I speak
[1:16:36] with tongues like men and angels and
[1:16:38] have not chair cherity excuse me like
[1:16:40] you all have here among you he says I'm
[1:16:41] nothing you can speak with tongues yes
[1:16:44] because it's the word a preacher can
[1:16:46] take this word and go forth and preach
[1:16:47] it and say that word and that word will
[1:16:51] grow he can can preach and the word will
[1:16:54] have an effect on the people I am a
[1:16:56] testimony of this you know what happened
[1:16:58] in our church in Texas and that we had a
[1:17:00] pastor that was living a double life and
[1:17:02] he preached and we grew under that
[1:17:04] Ministry but listen to what he says but
[1:17:07] the preacher could be a hypocrite
[1:17:09] himself genuine gift genuine word
[1:17:14] preacher a hypocrite he says it's the
[1:17:16] word see but the true living creature of
[1:17:19] God takes all of the purpose he says the
[1:17:23] word man shall not live by bread alone
[1:17:25] but by every word that proceedeth out he
[1:17:27] says and you add something else with
[1:17:28] that you've got a perverted plant we've
[1:17:31] got a fully restored word now there is
[1:17:33] no room for ignorance anymore God used
[1:17:35] to wink at ignorance now he doesn't wink
[1:17:37] at ignorance scripture says right that's
[1:17:39] what the prophet was supposed to do
[1:17:41] Malachi 45 and 6 was a restoring Angel
[1:17:45] he's restoring the word back to us and
[1:17:46] then in Revelation 10:7 there's an open
[1:17:49] book that he that that that that's given
[1:17:51] over and he is there and in the days of
[1:17:53] the voice of the seven Angel The Mystery
[1:17:55] of God will be finished everything's
[1:17:57] done everything's revealed and
[1:18:00] manifested as it was supposed to be so
[1:18:02] this Angel is bringing back a restored
[1:18:04] word a full word so that what we can
[1:18:07] have a full word effect because that's
[1:18:09] what they had in Paul's day was a full
[1:18:10] word and it had a full word effect and
[1:18:12] now it comes down to the Omega Church
[1:18:14] Alpha and Omega and we have the same
[1:18:16] word and it's supposed to have the same
[1:18:18] effect the difference is we're growing
[1:18:20] up into it they started with it so for
[1:18:23] us there's a slide up into it for them
[1:18:25] they were just there boom they had it
[1:18:27] and it was manifested and they were the
[1:18:28] the the peak they were the lion they
[1:18:30] were the the power the muscle of God if
[1:18:32] we wanted to put it that way amen but
[1:18:36] but but now we have a message that's
[1:18:37] returned and it's supposed to be
[1:18:39] restoring a bride back and so the people
[1:18:42] have to hear that word to be restored
[1:18:44] back you can't be restored back if
[1:18:46] there's nothing to be restored too if
[1:18:48] you don't realize there's a restoring
[1:18:49] needs to happen you're not going to be
[1:18:50] restored you've got to hear that word
[1:18:52] and so we come in and we hear this
[1:18:54] message amen but just because we hear
[1:18:56] the message like I said that doesn't
[1:18:57] make us a part of the Bride sitting in
[1:18:59] this church does not make us a member of
[1:19:01] the Bride this is an individual Affair
[1:19:05] from start to finish it's an individual
[1:19:07] Affair amen we've got to be personally
[1:19:09] born again we've got to personally
[1:19:11] receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:19:13] not just sit in anointed services not
[1:19:14] just sit under anointed preaching but
[1:19:16] we've got to be anointed ourselves on
[1:19:18] the soul and sealed so that we're a
[1:19:21] finished work and then from there God
[1:19:23] starts to use us amen and as soon as we
[1:19:25] have ourselves sealed then he fits us
[1:19:28] into the body and then he fits this that
[1:19:31] that'll be the local body and then the
[1:19:33] local body gets slotted into the grand
[1:19:35] scheme the full body the global bride of
[1:19:37] Jesus Christ but he starts individually
[1:19:39] and then he puts you into a bigger group
[1:19:40] and then that bigger group gets slotted
[1:19:42] in to the full thing amen but sitting in
[1:19:44] our church doesn't make us Christian
[1:19:46] having Christ in US makes us Christian
[1:19:48] that's the key to all of this so Paul
[1:19:51] continues in 1 Corinthians 13 he says
[1:19:53] and though I bestow all Goods to feed
[1:19:55] the poor and though I give my body to be
[1:19:57] burned and have not charity it profiteth
[1:19:59] me nothing prophet of God says this he
[1:20:01] says see all your good works all your
[1:20:03] good deeds all the spiritual things you
[1:20:05] have all the gifts you have all the
[1:20:07] sensations you have all the joy you have
[1:20:09] all the peace you have has nothing at
[1:20:11] all to do with it to begin with he's
[1:20:14] saying without the Holy Ghost those
[1:20:16] things mean
[1:20:17] nothing cuz the Holy Ghost is the source
[1:20:20] for all of those things the true source
[1:20:22] course if I could put it that way he
[1:20:24] says look at all those gifts all those
[1:20:26] good things I feed the poor I got a good
[1:20:28] heart about me I do this I do that I go
[1:20:30] to church I speak with tongues I
[1:20:32] prophesy I heal the sick I preach the
[1:20:34] gospel I do those things Paul said still
[1:20:36] I am nothing all those things can be
[1:20:39] carnally impersonated listen if we're
[1:20:42] going by work sister Teresa has us beat
[1:20:45] gave her life to the poor children of
[1:20:47] Kolkata I think it was right for going
[1:20:50] by works but what Paul's saying is you
[1:20:52] need to be LED in how you do those
[1:20:54] things you need to be led in how you
[1:20:57] give we don't just give cuz somebody has
[1:20:59] a need somebody somebody has a sometimes
[1:21:01] somebody has a need because they're off
[1:21:02] the word and all you're doing is throw
[1:21:04] money down a pit if you give it to them
[1:21:07] sometimes somebody is sick because
[1:21:09] they're out of the will of
[1:21:11] God sometimes people are in a mess
[1:21:13] because they've gotten themselves into a
[1:21:15] Mess by getting away from the word so
[1:21:17] you can't help them out because you're
[1:21:19] in a right place they got to get in the
[1:21:21] right place to receive the blessing
[1:21:23] to have God take care of their need
[1:21:24] that's what they've got to do amen we've
[1:21:26] got to have discernment for these things
[1:21:28] like I've said before you don't just
[1:21:30] pray cuz somebody wants you to pray a
[1:21:31] certain way you pray as the spirit leads
[1:21:33] you to pray absolutely 100% and that's
[1:21:37] something I'm learning more and more
[1:21:38] every day is not to say Lord here's the
[1:21:41] need say Lord what do you want to do in
[1:21:43] this
[1:21:44] situation that's what Paul's getting at
[1:21:46] here is he's saying what's the will of
[1:21:47] God for your life and all of these
[1:21:49] things if it's gifts what's the will of
[1:21:51] God for the gift if it's giving what's
[1:21:52] the will of God forgiving if it's time
[1:21:54] energy whatever it might be Lord what
[1:21:56] would you have me to do with it cuz the
[1:21:59] key is to be willing to move not to just
[1:22:01] be moving for the sake of moving we'll
[1:22:02] burn ourselves out we will absolutely
[1:22:05] burn ourselves out I've said this over
[1:22:06] the pulpit how many ministers have burnt
[1:22:09] themselves out because they feel they've
[1:22:10] got to be doing doing doing all the time
[1:22:12] and that's the heart of a servant inside
[1:22:14] of them but God didn't say you had to be
[1:22:16] doing all the time he said move when I
[1:22:18] tell you to move walk in the light as
[1:22:20] he's in the light as he shows you things
[1:22:22] to do then do it but don't burn yourself
[1:22:24] out for the sake of just saying I'm
[1:22:26] doing something get the leading of God
[1:22:28] to do those things amen listen we the
[1:22:30] redeemed that means we're bringing back
[1:22:32] to a position and with that position
[1:22:34] comes responsibilities comes a plan
[1:22:36] comes a purpose and so we've got to say
[1:22:38] Lord what's your purpose for me as part
[1:22:40] of your Redemption cuz he bringing us
[1:22:42] back to a place where we can be a part
[1:22:44] of our inheritance and we can do
[1:22:45] something with it Amen brother B puts it
[1:22:48] this way he says you're not a real
[1:22:51] Christian you're not a real genuine
[1:22:53] product for Christ if you don't love him
[1:22:55] in everything that you've got within you
[1:22:58] I don't care that whether you look
[1:22:59] pretty whether you don't you love him
[1:23:01] and you express yourself that's when you
[1:23:03] two become one and that's when Christ
[1:23:05] and his church become one not by
[1:23:07] denomination not by baptism not by
[1:23:09] Sensations not by nothing but a real
[1:23:12] love you were brought from the bosom of
[1:23:15] God when he was wounded there and he
[1:23:16] bought you and your love and your tress
[1:23:19] and your loyalty proves what you are
[1:23:22] your love your tress your loyalty proves
[1:23:26] what you
[1:23:27] are he says I don't care if my wife
[1:23:29] wouldn't ever comb her hair if she
[1:23:31] didn't wear a pretty dress or never
[1:23:33] there she'd be my sweetheart I admire
[1:23:35] her because of sorry I admire her
[1:23:38] because of her loyalty her virtue what
[1:23:41] she is that's what she is and by a
[1:23:43] Christian men and women that's what we
[1:23:45] are in the sight of God it's not because
[1:23:47] we can go to the best church or we can
[1:23:49] dress best or we can get in this
[1:23:50] neighborhood or we can do this or can
[1:23:52] ride in this or do this or that that
[1:23:54] doesn't have one thing to do with it
[1:23:56] it's the virtue of our loyalty and our
[1:23:58] love to Christ he says and that's the
[1:24:03] birth and though I speak with tongues of
[1:24:05] men and angels I am nothing though I
[1:24:07] feed the poor though I give my goods
[1:24:08] though I do this and do that and do that
[1:24:10] I am nothing he says what does Christ
[1:24:12] care about all what all you can do and
[1:24:15] what all you can do like that if that
[1:24:17] real genuine love and loyalty isn't
[1:24:20] there he says think of it won't you
[1:24:23] Paul's talking about Kingdom position
[1:24:26] and he's saying you got to take
[1:24:27] everything you are everything you've
[1:24:30] been given and bring it subject to
[1:24:32] charity bring it subject to the Holy
[1:24:34] Ghost bring it subject to the Divine
[1:24:36] Purpose because the Divine Purpose is
[1:24:39] love it's for the good of those you're
[1:24:41] going to do it for and we see Jesus
[1:24:43] Jesus did some things that hurt Prophet
[1:24:46] Paul did some things that hurt people
[1:24:48] but it was for love remember they had
[1:24:49] that that man in the church that that
[1:24:51] that wouldn't straighten up and Paul
[1:24:52] said kick him out let his let his body
[1:24:55] be destroyed for the saving of his soul
[1:24:58] hard hard hard and then Paul comes back
[1:25:00] and he says now that he's repented bring
[1:25:02] him back in and he says I did this for
[1:25:04] his sake but it hurt me so bad to do it
[1:25:07] but he said I had to do it cuz that's
[1:25:09] the only thing would work on that
[1:25:10] brother and it did but I can guarantee
[1:25:13] you that brother when he was being put
[1:25:15] out of the church didn't think that that
[1:25:16] was love but it was love so sometimes
[1:25:20] it's a feel-good love and sometimes it's
[1:25:21] a spank
[1:25:23] but it's always Divine love and we've
[1:25:25] got to bring everything we have subject
[1:25:27] to those things amen we're coming into
[1:25:29] Perfection now imperfection it's not
[1:25:31] enough to
[1:25:32] try it's not enough to try Lord I did my
[1:25:36] best because what you're under the
[1:25:39] perfect headship now of the Holy Spirit
[1:25:42] where you're led by
[1:25:45] God it's not enough to try you've got to
[1:25:49] do and you got to do as you're led to do
[1:25:51] amen we can't just do what seems good to
[1:25:54] us and sometimes we rest on The Laurels
[1:25:56] of being a messaged believer and this
[1:25:58] and that and the other thing and we
[1:25:59] forsake seeking the leadership just
[1:26:01] assuming that because we're a Believer
[1:26:03] we automatically know that our first
[1:26:04] inclination is always the will of God it
[1:26:06] isn't it isn't I'm telling you it isn't
[1:26:10] just because you feel that way
[1:26:11] immediately does not mean it's the will
[1:26:13] of God you always check it with the word
[1:26:15] first thing we do see I I've talked
[1:26:18] about this before we go to prayer and we
[1:26:20] don't check the word and what happens is
[1:26:23] you get a leading in your prayer and
[1:26:24] it's opposite to the word something's
[1:26:25] wrong somebody else answered your prayer
[1:26:28] you go and you run it through the word
[1:26:30] and then when youve got a direction in
[1:26:31] the word you say Lord is this what you
[1:26:33] want me to do in this situation cuz in
[1:26:35] many situations you can go different
[1:26:37] routes through the word sometimes it's a
[1:26:39] harder approach sometimes it's a softer
[1:26:42] approach sometimes it's a hands-off
[1:26:44] approach I don't do anything sometimes
[1:26:47] we get so involved with things we think
[1:26:48] we've got to act and all God's wanting
[1:26:50] us to do is you keep your hands on off
[1:26:52] this this is mine to deal with I don't
[1:26:53] need you messing the situation up again
[1:26:56] I'm speaking of myself you can do you
[1:26:59] cannot do or you can do it in a way
[1:27:01] that's not even right remember scripture
[1:27:03] says there's a way that seeth right to a
[1:27:05] man and the ways thereof are the ways of
[1:27:06] death he didn't say that that's that's
[1:27:09] the unbelievers no that goes for all of
[1:27:12] us we're still fighting a flesh we're
[1:27:13] still fighting memories and these
[1:27:15] different things and so every aspect of
[1:27:17] our life has to be brought subject to
[1:27:19] the holy spirit amen we're in the
[1:27:21] Capstone
[1:27:23] amen not just trying but this is the age
[1:27:26] of doing this is the age of being this
[1:27:28] is the age of
[1:27:29] producing brother man puts it this way
[1:27:31] he says Christianity ain't what you say
[1:27:33] it's what you live what you do it's an
[1:27:35] example he says you're the salt of the
[1:27:37] earth Jesus said you give Caesar them
[1:27:39] things that belong to Caesar you break
[1:27:41] that speed law out there and what are
[1:27:42] you doing you're doing wrong you sin we
[1:27:45] have any speeders in here this morning
[1:27:47] he says give Caesar what's Caesar's and
[1:27:49] God what's God's you say well the Law's
[1:27:51] wrong speed limits too too low cars are
[1:27:55] safer now I can safely do 130 everywhere
[1:27:58] and not have a
[1:27:59] problem he says I can't help what's
[1:28:03] wrong what wrong it is it's wrong to
[1:28:05] break Jesus commandment and if you don't
[1:28:06] give Caesar the things that Caesar then
[1:28:08] you did what Jesus told you not to do
[1:28:10] and the trans transgression of the law
[1:28:12] is sin he say is that
[1:28:14] right
[1:28:17] yep we're all guilty we do
[1:28:21] it
[1:28:23] we got one raised hand and a couple
[1:28:25] smiles we all do it we we listen we can
[1:28:29] we can put any spin we want on it we do
[1:28:32] things we ought not to do by the law and
[1:28:35] even by the
[1:28:36] word sometimes we're in a battle we're
[1:28:39] in a battle we are all guilty we do it
[1:28:43] but when you see yourself wrong stop
[1:28:46] it why people are watching you people
[1:28:52] won't go to church but they'll read you
[1:28:55] and see what you do so get Christ in
[1:28:57] your heart remember I told you about you
[1:28:59] know the Lord dealing with me about you
[1:29:01] know being hard on people when they're
[1:29:03] driving
[1:29:05] poorly do you know brother Steven Dole
[1:29:07] in in Alberta he posted something the
[1:29:09] other day he says out of the 8 billion
[1:29:11] people in the world I'm the best driver
[1:29:13] how amazing is that you know that's kind
[1:29:17] of what we think right but the way the
[1:29:20] Lord dealt with me on
[1:29:22] is he said what if you give somebody a
[1:29:24] hard time and then they show up at
[1:29:26] church or they see you if somewhere else
[1:29:28] say oh what do you do oh I'm a pastor oh
[1:29:30] wow I really want to come to your church
[1:29:33] maybe I'll sit outside and honk the horn
[1:29:34] during your next service right it's it's
[1:29:36] a it's the only testimony I might be
[1:29:38] able to give that person is how I
[1:29:39] respond on the street and it might break
[1:29:41] any other testimony I would give them if
[1:29:43] I get to meet them in person outside of
[1:29:46] a vehicle so he said how are you going
[1:29:48] to be a pastor of that Community if
[1:29:51] you're acting like the rest of the world
[1:29:53] in your
[1:29:54] car right
[1:29:57] okay occasionally I'll give them a beep
[1:29:59] just to let them know they're supposed
[1:30:00] to do something I tell my wife I'm
[1:30:02] communicating I'm not yelling but the
[1:30:05] idea is to be tempered in it
[1:30:07] right he says so get Christ in your
[1:30:11] heart Christ and the holy spirit's the
[1:30:13] same thing Christ means the anointed one
[1:30:15] and the Holy Spirit is that anointing
[1:30:17] and you are the one that's anointed and
[1:30:19] it's Christ in you anointing you see
[1:30:22] what I mean you're Christ you're an
[1:30:25] anointed one you're a Christ not the
[1:30:28] Christ a Christ CU Christ just means
[1:30:30] anointed one he was the Christ we are
[1:30:32] many little christs little anointed ones
[1:30:34] Little Messi hates he says when you do
[1:30:37] that then you've got the right thing
[1:30:41] then he can use you to anything he wants
[1:30:43] to use you in cuz you're in the body and
[1:30:46] subject to any of those gifts but see to
[1:30:48] have one of those gifts outside of the
[1:30:50] body it would do you no no good that's
[1:30:53] why I said earlier Paul said you're
[1:30:54] putting the CP before the
[1:30:57] horse you're putting your Excellence
[1:30:59] before your most Excellence he says you
[1:31:01] got to come the most excellent way and
[1:31:04] he he reads all of that scripture all
[1:31:05] over again I won't read it because we've
[1:31:06] read it 19 times now but he says see
[1:31:09] don't depend on those things the holy
[1:31:11] spirit is a being it's
[1:31:14] God okay that's wonderful God in you the
[1:31:19] person God that's Liv F your whole
[1:31:23] entire being he says you're changed
[1:31:25] you're a new
[1:31:27] creature any little thing that's wrong
[1:31:29] he'll tell you that's wrong then quit
[1:31:32] don't do it father I didn't mean to do
[1:31:35] that you forgive me see and that's the
[1:31:37] Holy Spirit I don't care how much you
[1:31:39] spoke in tongues how much you run how
[1:31:41] much you jumped how much you did this
[1:31:43] that or the other see whatever you done
[1:31:45] it wouldn't Mean a Thing If the Holy
[1:31:47] Spirit wasn't in there to condemn you on
[1:31:49] the things that's right and wrong I
[1:31:51] don't like that that word condemned cuz
[1:31:52] it's conviction for the believer but you
[1:31:54] know what he means he says you can do
[1:31:56] all those things and if there isn't a
[1:31:57] correction a correcting factor in your
[1:31:59] life something's wrong amen we we we
[1:32:02] preached on these Services about these
[1:32:04] attributes but what we forget in the end
[1:32:06] is that the first work of the holy
[1:32:08] spirit is conviction first thing it ever
[1:32:11] did was
[1:32:12] convict right repent that's the work of
[1:32:16] the holy spirit is repentance you turn
[1:32:18] around and then it he starts working on
[1:32:20] you sanctifying your life in these
[1:32:21] different things and it's so easy for us
[1:32:23] sometimes to forget that just because
[1:32:25] we've been given this truth doesn't mean
[1:32:27] we don't still do things we ought not to
[1:32:29] do that we don't get off the path that
[1:32:31] we don't get caught up in different
[1:32:32] things and they start to take over our
[1:32:34] life we've got to be able to say when
[1:32:36] things are wrong Lord I'm wrong and
[1:32:39] repent remember the Zeal of the age is
[1:32:41] to
[1:32:42] repent I was thinking this thought this
[1:32:44] morning you know and and and we we when
[1:32:47] we we look at the message and we look at
[1:32:48] these great Mysteries and everything but
[1:32:52] a and we tend to focus on the bigness of
[1:32:54] it but when you hear the actual message
[1:32:57] it is I counsel thee to buy me gold
[1:33:01] tried in the fire and white
[1:33:03] rment Godly character and the
[1:33:06] righteousness of God that's what he's
[1:33:08] trying to get you to that's it and the
[1:33:11] rest of this is is a take it or leave it
[1:33:13] meaning you may have some of it you may
[1:33:14] not have some of it but in the end he's
[1:33:16] trying to get us to the place where we
[1:33:19] reflect him that's it and how he gets
[1:33:22] that what Ministry he gets it under what
[1:33:24] church he sits you under whatever it may
[1:33:25] be that means less than the effect and
[1:33:28] the thing is he's going to get you where
[1:33:29] you need to be to have that thing happen
[1:33:31] inside of your life amen we'll see how
[1:33:34] we go through through these things how
[1:33:36] that God just is developing character in
[1:33:38] us just constantly it never ends it's a
[1:33:41] constant
[1:33:42] growth but we we United here we said we
[1:33:46] read that quote where he said these
[1:33:47] things have to be God born and God sent
[1:33:49] because what they're making way for God
[1:33:51] himself
[1:33:53] God doesn't live in a house that's made
[1:33:54] out of things that God doesn't bring
[1:33:56] it's a godb built house so that God can
[1:33:58] dwell inside of these things amen and
[1:34:00] it's all under the headship of Christ
[1:34:01] the Holy Spirit that's where we're going
[1:34:02] with it brother Braham says this in the
[1:34:04] God of this evil age he says also notice
[1:34:07] Christ's word bride is heading up word
[1:34:10] bride he uses that he ties that together
[1:34:12] a lot because why she's got to be the
[1:34:14] word the same as Christ was the word in
[1:34:16] the beginning was the word the word was
[1:34:18] with God the Word was God and the Word
[1:34:19] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and if
[1:34:21] that word came one time in flesh the
[1:34:23] next time it comes it's got to be the
[1:34:24] same way it's a word bride we've got to
[1:34:27] reflect the word not some man's idea he
[1:34:29] says and we can see where the Antichrist
[1:34:31] is heading it began back there and now
[1:34:33] coming to a head an ecumenical council
[1:34:36] will put it in an ecclesiastical head
[1:34:38] and the little church that's come along
[1:34:41] little never been about the numbers he
[1:34:44] says also Christ's word bride down
[1:34:46] Through the Ages coming to a head cuz
[1:34:48] she's going to be United back to its
[1:34:50] mate always just like the church and
[1:34:53] everything else it's got to unite the
[1:34:55] wheat everything else comes right back
[1:34:57] to its head where it started from he
[1:34:59] says like Cain and
[1:35:01] Abel there was something started there
[1:35:03] was a lineage started in Cain there's a
[1:35:05] lineage started in Abel you say Abel
[1:35:06] died you didn't have children we're
[1:35:08] talking a spiritual lineage one that
[1:35:10] would come according to the word and one
[1:35:11] that would come according to man's ideas
[1:35:13] one that would get mad at the word and
[1:35:15] one that would humble themselves to the
[1:35:16] word he says it's a word bride heading
[1:35:19] up in the person of the word of God
[1:35:22] brother Braham said we read that quote
[1:35:24] he says I'm I'm teaching you to be a
[1:35:26] Dwelling Place of God and brother
[1:35:27] braham's now coming around and saying
[1:35:28] this word bride is the person of the
[1:35:31] word of God made manifest in this evil
[1:35:33] age that we're living He says see where
[1:35:35] it's heading
[1:35:37] up so we're we're speaking on charity
[1:35:40] we're speaking on coming to Perfection
[1:35:42] and it's not just about attributes it's
[1:35:44] not just about treating people nice but
[1:35:46] it's about a manifestation of the word
[1:35:48] and we'll see as we go through this as
[1:35:50] we get into this series deeper and
[1:35:51] deeper that this Divine love is not just
[1:35:53] how we treat people but it's the it's
[1:35:55] the resurrection it's the Rapture it's
[1:35:58] Heaven it's rest it's all of these
[1:36:02] things and it's not just an effect but
[1:36:05] it's a place and it's a thing it has
[1:36:07] substance to
[1:36:08] it what we have here is just a taste a
[1:36:12] shadow of what the Holy Ghost really
[1:36:15] is and you'll see as we get into this
[1:36:17] amen this is bringing us back into
[1:36:19] perfect unity in Christ and the thing is
[1:36:21] this the reason why he focuses as we get
[1:36:24] into this where it says It suffers long
[1:36:26] and all these things we're Earthly
[1:36:28] creatures but we're going back to the
[1:36:31] heavenlies but while we're on Earth we
[1:36:33] have to have an Earthly effect we can't
[1:36:36] be brother BR say you're you're you're
[1:36:37] you're so spiritual you're of no earthly
[1:36:39] good there has to be an Earthly
[1:36:42] manifestation there has to be an Earthly
[1:36:44] effect of the word in our lives it can't
[1:36:46] just be to get us out of here it's got
[1:36:47] to do the same thing it's got to be the
[1:36:49] same thing that Christ was while he was
[1:36:50] here on this
[1:36:51] Earth and so we look at this in 1
[1:36:54] Corinthians 13 as we start to wind down
[1:36:56] he says charity suffereth
[1:36:59] long okay I made it
[1:37:03] through there's that and
[1:37:06] again and is kind I made it through but
[1:37:10] how did everybody else make it through
[1:37:11] next to you did you rip them
[1:37:15] apart did did did impatience overcome
[1:37:18] you did stress and these things overcome
[1:37:21] you so that you made it through but
[1:37:22] everybody else is lying bleeding on the
[1:37:23] floor next to you cuz you made it
[1:37:26] through but you RI them apart when
[1:37:27] you're doing it that's not charity
[1:37:29] charity suffers a long time it can deal
[1:37:31] with things and it's kind while doing it
[1:37:35] you can be kind in your suffering he
[1:37:38] says charity envieth not you're content
[1:37:40] with who you are and you're happy for
[1:37:43] what others are even if they have
[1:37:46] more even if they have more even if they
[1:37:48] have what you'd
[1:37:50] like he says charity vaunteth not itself
[1:37:53] it is not puffed up the Holy Ghost in us
[1:37:55] doesn't make us a big shot ever remember
[1:37:58] we read that that quote and we talked
[1:38:00] about an arrogant spirit is never of God
[1:38:02] because it doesn't bring Glory this
[1:38:04] doesn't bring glory to you charity does
[1:38:05] not lift me up it does not lift you
[1:38:08] up he says it does not behave itself
[1:38:11] unseemly means it's not conceited or
[1:38:15] rude seeketh not her own that means you
[1:38:19] don't insist on your rights
[1:38:21] that's a tough one that's a tough one
[1:38:24] we've read that quote many times brother
[1:38:26] Braham says a man has done you wrong
[1:38:27] he's justly done you wrong meaning he
[1:38:29] truly Did You Wrong how do you react
[1:38:32] charity brings him before the throne of
[1:38:34] grace and
[1:38:35] mercy right natural love will put him
[1:38:39] right in his place and pin him down and
[1:38:42] call for
[1:38:44] judgment he says it's not easily
[1:38:47] provoked not touchy or resentful
[1:38:52] I can be
[1:38:53] touchy I can get irritated
[1:38:55] easily but you know what changes that
[1:38:58] getting in the presence of God sweetness
[1:39:02] comes from the presence of
[1:39:04] God and if I'm out of the presence of
[1:39:06] God if my prayer life isn't the way it
[1:39:08] ought to be if my devotions life isn't
[1:39:10] the way it ought to be if I'm not
[1:39:11] spending time with God I get touchy
[1:39:18] touchier he says it think
[1:39:21] no evil that means it takes no account
[1:39:24] of evil done to it that means that if I
[1:39:27] could go to brother Paul and I could
[1:39:29] slap him across the face he'd come right
[1:39:31] over tomorrow and help me shovel my
[1:39:33] driveway he wouldn't think anything of
[1:39:35] it he'd shake my hand he'd still come to
[1:39:37] church he said do whatever he could for
[1:39:40] me because charity doesn't take account
[1:39:43] of what other people do remember if
[1:39:46] we're defined by the actions of other
[1:39:48] people then they're our Master right
[1:39:51] if I if what you do determines how I act
[1:39:54] then you're my master that's a scary
[1:39:56] place to
[1:39:58] be he says it rejoiceth not in iniquity
[1:40:01] but rejoices in the truth it beareth all
[1:40:05] things it Bears up under everything it
[1:40:08] handles every load placed on
[1:40:11] it it believeth all things now that one
[1:40:14] means ready to believe the best of every
[1:40:16] person and this is a tough one because
[1:40:18] you have to blend that with discernment
[1:40:21] cuz I can believe the best for you but
[1:40:24] that doesn't mean you are where I want
[1:40:25] you to be and so I've got to have
[1:40:26] discernment about those things but
[1:40:28] here's the thing sometimes we want to
[1:40:29] believe the worst rather than the best
[1:40:32] and that's a reflection of us not a
[1:40:33] reflection of them cuz remember charity
[1:40:36] is charity is in me it has nothing to do
[1:40:39] with you and it's in you and it has
[1:40:40] nothing to do with me so my thoughts
[1:40:42] towards you are a reflection of me not
[1:40:44] necessarily of you if charity is in my
[1:40:46] life he says it hopeth all things and
[1:40:50] endureth all things the Amplified says
[1:40:51] it endures without
[1:40:55] weakening so we read six
[1:40:57] verses and for an internal show of
[1:41:00] hands how many have all of this all the
[1:41:07] time not
[1:41:09] me I look at that and I don't want to
[1:41:12] prophesy negatively I've never had it I
[1:41:15] don't have it and I won't have it all
[1:41:18] the time cuz why why Earth and vessels
[1:41:23] Earth and
[1:41:24] vessels and that's the thing as we look
[1:41:26] at this and and you say I can't do it
[1:41:29] I'm saying I can't do it I haven't done
[1:41:30] it and I won't do it something's going
[1:41:32] to fail but the thing is and and we
[1:41:35] won't touch this so much the service the
[1:41:36] scripture says charity never faileth it
[1:41:38] didn't say you'll never fail it says
[1:41:40] charity never fails when the Holy Ghost
[1:41:42] is truly in control it never fails but
[1:41:44] the problem is is we take control back
[1:41:47] and we get caught up in life we get
[1:41:48] caught up in the situations you know it
[1:41:51] you say well I was tired and I lost my
[1:41:53] temper I couldn't help
[1:41:55] it as we become adults as we mature we
[1:41:58] can see things coming
[1:42:01] on I I Marvel sometimes not sometimes
[1:42:05] all the time at how the mother's handle
[1:42:07] it I mean in our home we handle it maybe
[1:42:08] a bit differently when it comes to kids
[1:42:10] but if a child wakes up my wife goes and
[1:42:12] takes care of it I have my ear plugs in
[1:42:14] and I sleep through the night and I'll
[1:42:15] say oh I had a great night's sleep how
[1:42:17] was that oh you know so and so was up
[1:42:19] three times and peed his bed and did
[1:42:20] this and I'm like oh I had a great sleep
[1:42:22] I got an hour and 10 minutes of deep
[1:42:24] sleep and 8 and 1 half total hours and
[1:42:26] and she's dying over
[1:42:29] there and it's easy to say I'm tired
[1:42:32] therefore I have a right to respond the
[1:42:34] way I do but when we recognize we're
[1:42:37] tired we have an option cuz we can sit
[1:42:41] there and we can claim our right as a
[1:42:43] natural human being to have an off
[1:42:46] day don't we we can do that or we can
[1:42:49] say Lord I'm tired but you're the god of
[1:42:53] my body you're the god of my mind you're
[1:42:56] the god of my spirit you're the god of
[1:42:58] my soul and so I'm asking you to take
[1:43:00] this tired body and fill it with love
[1:43:03] for
[1:43:04] today but to stop and say that to stop
[1:43:08] and recognize where we're at and say
[1:43:10] Lord I'm going to surrender my right to
[1:43:13] act tired I'm going to surrender my
[1:43:15] right to be frustrated I'm going to
[1:43:17] surrender my right to be stressed and
[1:43:19] I'm going to ask you to take control of
[1:43:21] this Earth and vessel one more time and
[1:43:24] let charity flow through me rather than
[1:43:27] my own indignation or my own rights or
[1:43:29] my own this that and the other what
[1:43:31] you're saying is Lord I'm going to ask
[1:43:34] you I'm going to voluntarily let you
[1:43:37] know I can't make it today and I'm going
[1:43:40] to fail so I'm asking you to step in and
[1:43:42] help me not to fail and that's a
[1:43:44] conscious decision that's a conscious
[1:43:47] moment that's a conscious prayer to have
[1:43:49] in these things amen
[1:43:51] for the sake of others Lord will you
[1:43:53] help me rise above myself cuz if we're
[1:43:56] not stepping into Perfection then what's
[1:43:58] the point of it in the first place if it
[1:44:00] can't have an impact on us when we're at
[1:44:01] the low point then what's the pro what's
[1:44:03] it all about if God can only work with
[1:44:06] us when we're on the highs then what's
[1:44:07] the point of
[1:44:09] it you you'll understand when I say I
[1:44:12] don't need God in the highs things are
[1:44:15] great I do but we feel like we don't
[1:44:18] need him in the highs but if he's not
[1:44:20] the god of the and he isn't God acting
[1:44:21] in the lows as much as he is the god
[1:44:23] that got us to the highs then he's not
[1:44:25] God at all so the failure is not in God
[1:44:27] the failure is US asking him and say
[1:44:29] Lord you see me I'm at the end of my
[1:44:31] rope I'm at the end of my mind I'm at
[1:44:32] the end of my patience I'm at the end of
[1:44:34] my money I'm at the end of this whatever
[1:44:36] it might be and say Lord I need you now
[1:44:39] and you'll see that this charity is all
[1:44:41] about surrender and letting him do the
[1:44:44] work through you absolutely
[1:44:48] absolutely Paul and Silas
[1:44:51] what a what a
[1:44:52] testimony put in jail they're put in
[1:44:55] stocks they've got chains on them and
[1:44:57] they sing and they pray and the whole
[1:44:59] jail hears it and God sends an
[1:45:00] earthquake and frees them that's what
[1:45:03] happens when you give God the
[1:45:05] opportunity to do something in a
[1:45:06] situation they're beaten they're bruised
[1:45:08] they're tired I don't know if you've
[1:45:10] ever slept in the stocks it's not
[1:45:11] comfortable chains don't help either and
[1:45:15] yet in all of that they sang and they
[1:45:17] prayed and you know what that helped
[1:45:19] them do when when it freed them they
[1:45:21] were able to stay in their place just
[1:45:24] without the things that were binding
[1:45:25] them they didn't leave they stayed in
[1:45:28] the prison and they got all the other
[1:45:29] prisoners to stay there as well cuz
[1:45:31] remember the Jailer came in saw the cell
[1:45:33] doors open and Drew his sword to kill
[1:45:35] himself cuz his it was his life for
[1:45:37] theirs they said don't worry we're all
[1:45:39] here don't kill
[1:45:40] yourself they were able to stay in the
[1:45:43] trial just without the chains just by
[1:45:46] simple worship and praise and prayer
[1:45:48] that's
[1:45:48] it brother B put it this way he says
[1:45:51] take the sap out of a peach tree and if
[1:45:53] you could transfer it by a transfusion
[1:45:55] into an apple tree the apple tree would
[1:45:57] bear peaches sure it certainly would see
[1:45:59] takes its life out of the apple tree
[1:46:01] take it all out give it a sap
[1:46:02] transfusion drain from the peach tree
[1:46:04] over into the apple tree what happens if
[1:46:06] the peach tree life comes into the apple
[1:46:08] tree it won't bear no more Apple it'll
[1:46:10] bear peaches seed because it's got the
[1:46:12] life in
[1:46:14] it he says well you take us that's
[1:46:17] nothing but a wild gourd a not head see
[1:46:21] and there's nothing to us for we're all
[1:46:23] dead in sin and trespasses a wild gourd
[1:46:26] Can't Be Tamed you can't you can't make
[1:46:29] it grow a certain way he says we're that
[1:46:31] way we're not
[1:46:33] heads he says we're all in these kind of
[1:46:36] condition and then we give we ourselves
[1:46:39] can prostrate ourselves and give
[1:46:42] ourselves up
[1:46:44] until give ourselves up give ourselves
[1:46:47] up give ourselves up give ourselves up
[1:46:50] up and surrender and surrender and
[1:46:52] surrender
[1:46:54] until there's a space of time before the
[1:46:56] giving up and what happens next he says
[1:46:59] give ourselves up until God takes his
[1:47:02] transfusion tube the name of Jesus
[1:47:04] Christ because there's not another name
[1:47:06] under Heaven whereby men can be saved
[1:47:08] and he transfers The Life of Christ into
[1:47:10] us then we have this kind of Faith the
[1:47:13] faith that Christ had he says and
[1:47:16] Christ's Faith was not based in those
[1:47:17] Pharisees or Sadducees or in their pots
[1:47:19] and and pans and their washing it was
[1:47:22] based on the word of God Amen so much
[1:47:25] until Christ was the word the word made
[1:47:30] flesh it's got to be the same thing
[1:47:33] today he says and then
[1:47:36] we can get so
[1:47:38] transfused we
[1:47:41] can how do you get there give up give up
[1:47:46] give up give up give up give up give up
[1:47:50] give up give
[1:47:52] up cuz what all your life has to drain
[1:47:55] out so that all his life can fill
[1:47:58] up and that's a work of a lifetime it is
[1:48:03] I'm only 44 but it's a work of a
[1:48:05] lifetime he's not done on me yet and to
[1:48:07] the testimonies I've had from the older
[1:48:08] folks he's not done with you yet it's
[1:48:10] the work of a lifetime he says and then
[1:48:13] when we can get so transfused by his
[1:48:15] power that we die to our own thinking he
[1:48:19] says and our Faith becomes a genuine
[1:48:22] Faith he says hallelujah then the Life
[1:48:25] of Christ is transfused into us he says
[1:48:28] we become living creatures of God a
[1:48:32] dwelling place where the Holy Spirit can
[1:48:34] send his radiant
[1:48:37] blessings what does radiant mean you
[1:48:40] ever been around a radiant heater a
[1:48:42] radiant heater doesn't just kick out air
[1:48:44] it Heats it it it heats the
[1:48:47] object it doesn't heat the air it heats
[1:48:49] the object objects in there so if you've
[1:48:51] got a garage that has a standard forced
[1:48:53] air heater it just runs air through it
[1:48:55] and it heats the air but a radiant
[1:48:56] heater actually puts the heat into the
[1:48:59] objects that's the way it works he's
[1:49:01] saying when he does this in your life
[1:49:03] you start to take effect on other
[1:49:06] people it's not just the atmosphere it's
[1:49:08] the people around you get a blessing out
[1:49:10] of it he says can send his radiant
[1:49:13] blessings down through there he says and
[1:49:15] we're in the stature of Christ he says
[1:49:18] and now we've put the blood of Jesus
[1:49:20] Christ in and that thing brings the
[1:49:22] faith of Jesus Christ remember I said
[1:49:24] before this is the quote I've been
[1:49:25] referencing for a while but I didn't
[1:49:26] read it he says you've got to add to
[1:49:29] your faith virtue and your virtue
[1:49:32] knowledge and your knowledge
[1:49:34] Temperance he says now we put the blood
[1:49:36] of Jesus Christ in there's been a
[1:49:38] transfusion the life is in you now he
[1:49:41] says and that brings the faith of Jesus
[1:49:43] Christ The Virtue of Jesus Christ the
[1:49:46] knowledge of Jesus Christ The Temperance
[1:49:48] of Jesus Christ the patience of Jesus
[1:49:50] Christ the godliness of Jesus Christ the
[1:49:53] brotherly kindness of Jesus Christ and
[1:49:56] the love of God which is Jesus Christ
[1:49:58] he's the head and controls you and your
[1:50:01] feet are the foundation Faith amen he
[1:50:03] says controlled by the head there you
[1:50:05] are there is the perfect man of God when
[1:50:07] he possesses these virtues we're talking
[1:50:09] about charity we've had Faith we've had
[1:50:11] virtue and knowledge and he says that's
[1:50:13] yours but when charity comes in when the
[1:50:16] Capstone comes down when you're filled
[1:50:18] with the Holy Ghost it takes what you
[1:50:20] got it and it turns into what he has and
[1:50:23] you didn't have that before as great as
[1:50:25] it was it came from God it was of God
[1:50:28] but now it is God that's the difference
[1:50:30] when you get the Holy Ghost it's God
[1:50:32] working through you you are his hands
[1:50:34] you're his feet you're his lips you're
[1:50:35] his body you are everything that he has
[1:50:37] need of Earthly because he's living in
[1:50:40] you he's the head and he's controlling
[1:50:43] you what a beautiful thing when you
[1:50:45] realize that the faith I have if you
[1:50:47] have the Holy Ghost the faith I have is
[1:50:49] the literal faith of Jesus Christ the
[1:50:52] knowledge of Jesus Christ The Virtue of
[1:50:54] Jesus Christ if he can bear it you can
[1:50:56] bear it because the same thing that he
[1:50:58] had is what you have inside of you the
[1:50:59] exact same thing no difference except
[1:51:01] the
[1:51:03] measure that's
[1:51:06] it what's he talking about he's talking
[1:51:08] about letting the Holy Spirit just
[1:51:09] permeate every aspect of our life every
[1:51:12] single bit that we have every aspect
[1:51:15] every thought every emotion every idea
[1:51:17] every sensation every action every
[1:51:19] reaction he's saying just let the Divine
[1:51:21] love of God flow through you it's the
[1:51:24] Holy Spirit flowing through the believer
[1:51:27] Peter would say
[1:51:29] this he says and above all things have
[1:51:34] fervent charity among yourselves he says
[1:51:38] for charity shall cover the multitude of
[1:51:41] sins remember what he said earlier be
[1:51:43] kind and tenderhearted forgiving one
[1:51:45] another even as God for Christ's sake ha
[1:51:47] forgiven you that word fervent there
[1:51:50] means stretched
[1:51:51] out stretched out it reminds me of gold
[1:51:54] remember like I mentioned in Revelation
[1:51:55] 3 we're told to buy gold tried in the
[1:51:57] fire that's beaten gold that's purified
[1:51:59] gold and what is it it's Godly
[1:52:02] character now gold there's a gold has a
[1:52:05] special property and gold is the most
[1:52:08] malleable of All Metals now malleable
[1:52:11] means it's able to be reshaped under
[1:52:14] pressure and able to be drawn out or
[1:52:17] stretched without breaking
[1:52:20] so that means that you can take a a
[1:52:22] piece of gold and you can stretch it and
[1:52:24] stretch it and stretch it and stretch it
[1:52:26] and it doesn't break so I looked this up
[1:52:29] brother Matt and I were looking at some
[1:52:30] of this last night one gram of gold so
[1:52:33] that's a piece of gold the size of a of
[1:52:35] a piece of rice a piece of rice can be
[1:52:39] stretched for 3
[1:52:42] kilm brother Dale's house I looked it up
[1:52:44] just before service by roads is 2 and 1
[1:52:46] 12 km so a piece of gold the size of a
[1:52:48] piece of rice can stretch from here to
[1:52:50] brother Dale's and still have room to go
[1:52:52] another 500 m one piece of rice of gold
[1:52:56] can go 3
[1:52:58] km when they take it they beat it and it
[1:53:01] takes them two weeks to beat this gold
[1:53:03] down and they they they start with a
[1:53:05] thicker piece and they just keep
[1:53:06] breaking it down breaking it down and
[1:53:09] when they do it they get it 500 times
[1:53:12] thinner than a human
[1:53:15] hair that's how thin it is that's how
[1:53:18] perfect it is and take that one piece of
[1:53:20] rice and you flatten it out and it will
[1:53:23] cover this entire Pulpit one piece of
[1:53:26] rice in a thin film 500 times thinner
[1:53:29] than a human hair you know how he said
[1:53:32] he said there that charity covers a
[1:53:35] multitude the multitude of sins why it
[1:53:38] can stretch without breaking and it can
[1:53:41] cover way more than you think it can you
[1:53:44] take a piece of aluminum and try and do
[1:53:45] that it'll get about this big before it
[1:53:47] breaks but gold you can stretch stretch
[1:53:50] it and stretch it and stretch it for all
[1:53:52] intents and purposes you can't
[1:53:53] outstretch gold practically speaking it
[1:53:56] it'll hold on longer than you can hold
[1:53:58] on if I could put it that way
[1:54:00] amen but what was amazing was they said
[1:54:03] the gold that's worked by human
[1:54:06] hands that's worked by a person rather
[1:54:08] than a machine it doesn't break up the
[1:54:11] way it does if you beat it with with a
[1:54:12] machine the person working on your
[1:54:15] character develops it better than
[1:54:17] anything that anybody else could come up
[1:54:18] with God's got a way to develop our
[1:54:20] character and it's a molding and a
[1:54:22] shaping and a beating and no machine
[1:54:24] they can come up with can produce it the
[1:54:26] way that a human working with it can
[1:54:28] that's the finest gold that you can get
[1:54:30] and what's Paul what's Peter saying he's
[1:54:32] saying when we have this kind of love it
[1:54:33] can go a long way and it can cover a
[1:54:36] multitude of sins listen when Christ
[1:54:38] died he his Divine love gave us his
[1:54:41] blood and it he shed it on on Calvary
[1:54:43] and that covered every one of our
[1:54:45] mistakes but that was the
[1:54:47] fountain you say brother John I've just
[1:54:50] got a little bit of the Holy Ghost a
[1:54:52] little bit of the Holy Ghost will cover
[1:54:54] every sin of every person in this church
[1:54:56] that's what I'm
[1:54:58] saying it'll stretch way more than you
[1:55:00] think it can stretch and when you've got
[1:55:02] that kind of love in your life you can
[1:55:04] take a lot more than you think you
[1:55:06] can but you got to grow into
[1:55:09] it and you got to let him mold and shape
[1:55:12] it and beat it and grow it to cover the
[1:55:16] multitude of sins notice he didn't say a
[1:55:18] multitude of sins the multitude it'll
[1:55:21] cover anything there's nothing that you
[1:55:25] can't put under that
[1:55:31] blood fervent
[1:55:33] charity fiery charity active charity
[1:55:36] living
[1:55:37] charity a hug is easy forgiveness is
[1:55:41] hard a hug is easy praying for somebody
[1:55:44] Did You Wrong is hard a hug is
[1:55:48] easy having somebody out that doesn't
[1:55:50] seem to like you that's
[1:55:54] hard this thing is working it's got a
[1:55:59] life it's boiling
[1:56:02] up brother Brandon would talk about this
[1:56:05] dream that a woman had and and and she
[1:56:07] shared the dream with him and it was a
[1:56:08] dream and there was a big rock box and
[1:56:10] there was a man that kept pouring
[1:56:12] boiling water into this rock box and
[1:56:14] when he was pouring the water in it
[1:56:16] would it would come up and it would as
[1:56:18] of course as boiling water so it's
[1:56:20] cleaning out the inside of the box and
[1:56:21] all these sticks and dirt and everything
[1:56:23] are coming out but the water keeps
[1:56:25] running out because the Rock Box isn't
[1:56:27] sealed and so she she she the the cracks
[1:56:29] weren't sealed in the box so it could
[1:56:31] hold the water up to a degree but you
[1:56:33] had to keep pouring in to keep the water
[1:56:35] overflowing but as soon as he stopped
[1:56:37] pouring the water in then it would just
[1:56:38] fall out through the seams and the
[1:56:39] cracks and she said to brother Braham
[1:56:41] she says I know it's a spiritual dream
[1:56:43] but I don't know what it is and I don't
[1:56:44] know what to do with it and brother R
[1:56:46] says this he says then she asked why the
[1:56:48] Box didn't hold it and the man said
[1:56:50] that's not water that's the Holy Ghost
[1:56:52] and nothing will hold it and said then
[1:56:54] when he went back and got another big
[1:56:56] bucket and it was full of honey and he
[1:56:58] poured the honey in there and said now
[1:56:59] it will hold this and she thought that
[1:57:01] the box was a rock box was going to
[1:57:03] burst out and spill the honey but it
[1:57:05] didn't it finally stuck together and
[1:57:07] held it this box had been trying to hold
[1:57:10] the Holy Ghost the water for so long but
[1:57:12] it couldn't do it he says and then he
[1:57:14] took a big bucket of honey and poured it
[1:57:15] in and all of a sudden it could hold the
[1:57:18] Holy Ghost it could hold the water
[1:57:19] he says so therefore the rock this
[1:57:21] latterday Pentecostal Church which has
[1:57:23] received the Holy Ghost they did at the
[1:57:25] first he's talking about Pentecostal
[1:57:27] meaning the true Pentecost not the
[1:57:29] denomination okay he's talking about us
[1:57:32] he says all down Through the Ages they
[1:57:34] received the Holy Spirit but not in the
[1:57:36] measure they have it now because it's a
[1:57:37] restoration of the first and as we take
[1:57:40] the candlesticks Alpha and Omega how
[1:57:42] they lit the first candle it went Higher
[1:57:43] and Higher and Higher and got dimmer and
[1:57:45] dimmer and then it come back again he
[1:57:47] said first and last and so forth he
[1:57:49] saying as it was in the days of Acts in
[1:57:51] the book of Acts so it is in the end
[1:57:52] it's Alpha and Omega it's Christ in the
[1:57:54] beginning it's Christ in the end and in
[1:57:55] the in the middle it's not Christ
[1:57:56] because he demmin the people pulled away
[1:57:58] from him and he couldn't be expressed
[1:58:00] but he says now we've been restored to
[1:58:01] that so it's Christ at the end the way
[1:58:03] he was in the
[1:58:04] first he says now in this church age the
[1:58:07] message is being poured into the church
[1:58:10] this Tabernacle will say he says that's
[1:58:12] where she comes to church this
[1:58:13] Tabernacle and he's talking about the
[1:58:14] building he says is not a holy ghost
[1:58:16] Tabernacle there's no such a thing
[1:58:19] individuals that come into this church
[1:58:21] is Holy Ghost
[1:58:22] Tabernacles they're Tabernacles that
[1:58:24] contain the Holy Ghost but not the
[1:58:26] church in the body a group he says we've
[1:58:28] got people with the Holy Ghost but the
[1:58:30] church collectively doesn't have it and
[1:58:33] the church body doesn't have all the
[1:58:34] Holy
[1:58:36] Ghost what's he talking about he's
[1:58:38] saying there needs to be a Unity of the
[1:58:40] Body for the body to hold the Holy
[1:58:45] Ghost he says therefore it runs out but
[1:58:49] but what this man was pouring the water
[1:58:51] the messenger to the church was pouring
[1:58:52] the message into the church and what was
[1:58:54] the water doing it was boiling out all
[1:58:56] the trash that was in it that's what the
[1:58:58] Holy Spirit does is it boils it up now
[1:59:00] so that's sanctification it's the Holy
[1:59:02] Spirit and it's working in you and it's
[1:59:04] working on you but it's not staying in
[1:59:07] you it's just going through you and then
[1:59:09] it leaks out the cracks it has a work
[1:59:11] but you need constant working of the
[1:59:14] Holy Spirit to keep your life clean CU
[1:59:15] you don't have it sealed up yet your
[1:59:17] life isn't sealed and so the Holy Spirit
[1:59:18] just flows through you in and out in and
[1:59:20] out he says now the honey represented
[1:59:23] Brotherly Love brotherly kindness he
[1:59:26] says which is this
[1:59:28] age now listen to this he says now you
[1:59:30] might say look I sure don't like brother
[1:59:32] Neville or I sure don't like brother
[1:59:33] Jones I don't like brother so and so and
[1:59:35] something like that but just let
[1:59:37] something happen to him brother your
[1:59:39] heart is broke it just nearly killed you
[1:59:41] see we can obtain brotherly kindness and
[1:59:43] feeling for one another he says but to
[1:59:46] maintain in a group of people he says
[1:59:48] why do you you care for that brother he
[1:59:50] says it's because you broke bread with
[1:59:52] him here at the altar as you will
[1:59:54] tonight you fellowship with him you
[1:59:56] shook his hands you worship with them
[1:59:59] he's your brother he says and he might
[2:00:01] do something in the flesh that you would
[2:00:03] disagree with he says be you kind of
[2:00:06] just stay you kind of just stay away he
[2:00:08] says which you oughtn't to do but shun
[2:00:10] him a little and in the bottom of your
[2:00:13] heart if something happened to that
[2:00:14] brother it would just nearly kill you or
[2:00:16] that sister he says I'm an old man I was
[2:00:18] once young and now I'm old I've seen it
[2:00:20] down through the age people do that here
[2:00:23] people say I just won't have no more to
[2:00:24] do with him and something happened to
[2:00:27] that man it nearly kills him he thinks
[2:00:29] oh God I let my precious brother go
[2:00:31] without making friends with him you see
[2:00:33] he says it's brotherly love it looks
[2:00:36] like it won't stick but it does stick
[2:00:39] the honey it sticks we covered that
[2:00:41] service on brotherly kindness and I
[2:00:43] didn't bring that here cuz I wanted to
[2:00:44] bring it here to say that that is the
[2:00:46] peak that's the peak that's the final
[2:00:49] thing and it comes in this final age
[2:00:50] that brotherly kindness and brother B
[2:00:52] would call it brotherly love it's not
[2:00:53] charity but it's brotherly love and he's
[2:00:55] saying you think you can't love like
[2:00:57] that you can cuz this is the age for it
[2:01:00] this is the age where that gets added
[2:01:01] back into the church collectively but
[2:01:03] that's the final thing You' got to get
[2:01:05] before you can hold the Holy Ghost where
[2:01:08] you can treat your brother and your
[2:01:09] sister the same no matter what you know
[2:01:11] what they said about brother brandham
[2:01:12] you couldn't tell his friends from his
[2:01:14] enemies I say God help me to to live a
[2:01:17] life that looks like that where you
[2:01:18] wouldn't know that I'm having a hard
[2:01:20] time with you or not and that I wouldn't
[2:01:22] know whether you're having a hard time
[2:01:23] with me or not now some of that can come
[2:01:26] by us just saying you know what I'm not
[2:01:28] going to get caught up in how they
[2:01:30] act if they're acting weird to me then
[2:01:32] I'm just going to let it go I'm going to
[2:01:34] keep acting the way I'm supposed to but
[2:01:36] if something's off then you push through
[2:01:37] and you say I'm not going to let you go
[2:01:39] brother I'm not going to let you go
[2:01:40] sister you're my brother you're my
[2:01:42] sister we've broken bread here he's
[2:01:44] talking about here communion table I've
[2:01:46] washed your feet I'm not going to let
[2:01:48] you I'm I'm not going to let Satan put a
[2:01:50] wedge between me and you he says when
[2:01:52] you've got that he says the Holy Ghost
[2:01:54] can fill that kind of a
[2:01:56] person sometimes we're looking for
[2:01:57] charity and we don't have the the
[2:01:59] brotherly kindness the brotherly love
[2:02:00] that he's talking about but it was
[2:02:03] interesting to me how he was talking
[2:02:04] about that that that messenger pouring
[2:02:07] in the message of the hour pouring in
[2:02:10] the Holy Spirit and people come into
[2:02:12] church and that's what we get we get the
[2:02:14] word taking effect and it's washing us
[2:02:16] and you get anointed services and the
[2:02:18] moving of God in the service and then
[2:02:20] what happens is you walk out and 6 hours
[2:02:22] later or 12 hours later or 18 hours
[2:02:23] later or 24 hours later you're back to
[2:02:25] what you always were cuz you can't hold
[2:02:28] the Holy Ghost you haven't come to that
[2:02:31] place you haven't been sealed brother
[2:02:33] Bram says we've got to come to the place
[2:02:35] where it's not just in you and it's not
[2:02:37] just in me but it's in the body the
[2:02:39] whole body because remember this isn't
[2:02:41] just about individuals but it's getting
[2:02:43] the whole body in unity under one head
[2:02:46] which is Christ the holy spirit amen
[2:02:49] when we get that the Holy Ghost doesn't
[2:02:50] just pour in but it stays in so then you
[2:02:53] walk out of service and you got
[2:02:54] something to give you got something to
[2:02:57] pour out you got something that people
[2:02:59] can draw from and drink cuz it's hot in
[2:03:02] here but it cools when we go out and it
[2:03:04] can it can help somebody it can it can
[2:03:07] sat it can satisfy somebody's thirst it
[2:03:09] can respond and now you've got something
[2:03:12] to pour out when the situation gets
[2:03:13] tough when you fail something inside of
[2:03:16] you is still
[2:03:17] available meet the need amen if the
[2:03:22] musicians could
[2:03:24] come I said this at the start the first
[2:03:27] work of the holy spirit is
[2:03:29] conviction and we come into this
[2:03:32] charity and now it's about don't let
[2:03:35] other
[2:03:36] people hold you back don't let other
[2:03:39] people Define how you're going to
[2:03:41] operate don't let other people tell you
[2:03:43] how to do things but let something
[2:03:46] inside of you tell you how to operate
[2:03:48] and doing that You' got to give up and
[2:03:50] give up and give up and surrender and
[2:03:54] surrender and surrender we sing that
[2:03:57] song flow through me Holy Spirit flow
[2:03:59] through me that's what this looks like
[2:04:02] is if it's going to flow through you
[2:04:03] then you can't put up
[2:04:05] resistance you choke a pipe down to real
[2:04:08] small you can only put so much through
[2:04:09] it but you got a nice big open pipe with
[2:04:12] no no obstructions or anything water
[2:04:15] just flows through that I I I've seen
[2:04:17] where they they have these big dams
[2:04:19] you know big hydroelectric dams and
[2:04:21] they've got these flu in there and
[2:04:22] they've got these these channels in
[2:04:24] there that they open from time to time
[2:04:26] but what happens is if they haven't been
[2:04:28] opened if you haven't had a a Revival in
[2:04:31] a while then all the mud and sticks get
[2:04:34] packed into those channels and so what
[2:04:36] do they do every now and again they open
[2:04:38] the door and they just let that water
[2:04:41] pressure build up on that and then
[2:04:43] pretty soon it almost looks like
[2:04:44] somebody's squeezing mud out of a tube
[2:04:46] and it just comes out and it kind of
[2:04:47] drops down
[2:04:49] but then as it starts to move quicker it
[2:04:51] starts to move further out and further
[2:04:53] out so all of a sudden just go it' be 60
[2:04:55] 80 100 150 feet of water and mud just
[2:04:58] shooting out and what's it doing it's
[2:05:00] cleaning out the flu cleaning out the
[2:05:02] channels so the water can flow sometimes
[2:05:06] that's what we need we need something to
[2:05:08] come in and clean out the channels amen
[2:05:11] we say Lord It's been stagnant Lord it
[2:05:13] feels a little clogged
[2:05:15] up I need something to clean me out I
[2:05:18] need something to Bo boil me out I need
[2:05:19] something to wash me out I need
[2:05:21] something to clean up those channels
[2:05:22] that are holding back that love that's
[2:05:24] supposed to flow through me and then
[2:05:26] when they do it it's just clean pure
[2:05:28] water just shooting through there and if
[2:05:30] you stood in front of it it would knock
[2:05:31] you down when they first open it it's
[2:05:34] just mud that's just dripping over the
[2:05:35] edge bloop bloop but as that pressure
[2:05:38] builds up and that channel gets opened
[2:05:40] up now when it comes out it'll flatten a
[2:05:42] car the power of that water that's what
[2:05:45] we're supposed to be a power of God
[2:05:48] working through through our lives let's
[2:05:50] stand as we read this last
[2:05:53] quote Paul said let us go on unto
[2:05:56] Perfection let's keep going let's keep
[2:05:59] pressing brother BR says this he says
[2:06:01] let's leave this convention if it be the
[2:06:03] will of God with so much love and the
[2:06:06] divine power of the Holy Ghost in our
[2:06:08] life until it changes every motive that
[2:06:11] we've got and molds and shapes Our Lives
[2:06:16] into the form of Jesus Christ
[2:06:19] that's my prayer is that your prayer
[2:06:21] this morning Lord that you would mold me
[2:06:23] and shape me that you would clean me
[2:06:25] that you would make me a vessel where
[2:06:27] your Holy Spirit can flow through me and
[2:06:30] produce the kind of love that people
[2:06:32] need brother BR says the world is
[2:06:34] looking for a display of love that's
[2:06:37] what they need not the love that they
[2:06:38] call for the love that he has he says
[2:06:42] and if you can do that it'll make a
[2:06:45] difference that's what's going to draw
[2:06:47] people it's not our Doctrine it's not
[2:06:50] the way we dress necessarily it'll be
[2:06:53] the life it'll be the love of Christ
[2:06:54] flowing through us that draws us he says
[2:06:56] we're the salt of the earth and that
[2:06:58] love is a Savory thing for the Earth for
[2:07:01] the people of this earth when they can
[2:07:02] see us react and do things in a way that
[2:07:04] they know they don't deserve they say
