[36:46] tender verses
[36:57] [Music]
[37:08] [Music]
[37:19] [Music]
[37:24] from this time
[37:27] [Music]
[37:30] bring my soul out of prison then I may
[37:32] praise thy name the righteous shall
[37:34] Compass me about for Thou shalt deal
[37:36] bountifully with me
[37:39] so this Psalm is uh
[37:41] you know opposite one by David
[37:44] and this Psalm finds David in
[37:47] one of the darkest loneliest places that
[37:49] we see David
[37:50] you know it's everyone kind of goes to
[37:52] the typical you know his experience with
[37:55] Bathsheba
[37:56] or when he's in and Getty
[37:59] or when he's running from Absalom those
[38:01] are kind of the main ones that we see
[38:03] the most famous
[38:04] Psalms but this one is from a little no
[38:08] unknown place called The Cave of a doula
[38:11] and in this situation we see where David
[38:14] goes from hero to zero in a matter of
[38:17] from what it seems weeks
[38:20] and God literally just pulls the rug out
[38:23] from underneath him
[38:24] and what's great about David you know is
[38:26] that he's one of the best character
[38:27] studies in the Bible
[38:29] there's nearly 66 chapters about him
[38:31] more than anyone else other than Christ
[38:33] obviously
[38:35] and the beauty about David is that you
[38:36] can go through you know first and second
[38:38] Samuel first and second Kings and the
[38:40] Chronicles not the Kings but in
[38:42] Chronicles
[38:43] and you see the historical setting in
[38:46] the in the main story but then you get
[38:48] the added benefit of going to the Psalms
[38:50] and you see what's what's going on in
[38:51] his heart
[38:52] and you see
[38:54] how is he reacting to these situations
[38:56] and how is he thinking how is he
[38:57] pondering in his heart
[38:59] and you got a great 360 degree view of
[39:02] how
[39:03] how he's reacting how he's feeling and
[39:05] what it's like to be under that amount
[39:07] of Oppression because you look at David
[39:10] the amount that he went through God
[39:12] squeezed that man
[39:15] like no one else
[39:16] other than probably Abraham maybe I but
[39:18] I would probably put them in as a tie so
[39:20] with David it's just it's such a great
[39:22] character study like Dad did it for two
[39:23] years with his Sony School crew I did it
[39:26] for a year and a half
[39:27] each generation gets weaker and uh
[39:31] and the kids you know I think they liked
[39:33] it but you know it was a great great
[39:36] study because you're able to just kind
[39:38] of digest it slowly bit by bit and you
[39:40] see these things that you know these
[39:42] little stories that you normally don't
[39:44] hear about because everyone hears about
[39:45] Goliath and they hear about you know him
[39:47] taking Jerusalem and all that stuff but
[39:49] this story here is is really really
[39:52] jumped out of me probably the my
[39:53] favorite part about the whole Sunday
[39:55] school Sunday school study that we did
[39:58] because it's very very relatable
[40:02] because overall you know
[40:06] we all have these times of crushing
[40:10] these lonely places where
[40:12] God kind of takes all the feathers out
[40:14] of that nest
[40:16] and all you're left with is you and your
[40:18] thoughts
[40:19] as a lonely lonely place
[40:22] but you see the grace of God the God who
[40:24] is rich in Mercy
[40:26] when in these situations at his most
[40:28] seemingly brutal
[40:31] that's when his love is the sweetest
[40:33] and you see that with David is that he
[40:35] never ever gets bitter from any of these
[40:36] situations he just he grows each one and
[40:39] it's a rather than him hitting rock
[40:41] bottom as a trampoline leaping him
[40:42] forward
[40:43] you know
[40:45] so anyways we'll uh we'll go through it
[40:48] all and
[40:49] hopefully it'll be a blessing to y'all
[40:54] you know
[40:55] 66 chapters about him he did 73 of the
[40:58] 150 Psalms which is incredible you know
[41:01] in terms of how much of an impact in the
[41:02] Bible he had
[41:05] um so if we start at the beginning
[41:07] you know David is chosen at a young age
[41:09] so he was King by the time he was 30.
[41:14] and we know for a fact that he ran
[41:18] or was fleeing and hiding from Saul for
[41:20] about 15 years so if you go back 15
[41:22] years
[41:24] that was when Goliath was happening
[41:26] that's when he was a commander in the
[41:27] arm of Israel
[41:29] so God anointed him at a very early age
[41:31] anywhere between 12 and 15.
[41:34] we all know a story that you know
[41:37] Israel chooses a king
[41:39] they do a horrible job at it
[41:41] you know on paper Saul was the best King
[41:44] ever you know he comes from the warrior
[41:46] tribe Benjamin you know he's a foot
[41:48] above everyone else the Bible literally
[41:51] calls him the most beautiful looking man
[41:53] in the Kingdom so and the Bible says
[41:56] that you can take it for a fact that
[41:57] it's it's for sure
[41:59] you know he's very eloquent but he turns
[42:02] out to be the worst one of the worst
[42:05] kings they've ever had to the point
[42:06] where
[42:07] at the end of it he's going to witches
[42:10] for counsel
[42:12] he is trying to kill his fellow believer
[42:15] blah blah blah you see how low some can
[42:18] go when they're trusting their own
[42:20] instincts
[42:22] so
[42:23] God let Israel choose first
[42:27] and it was definitely permissive will
[42:30] because you see what happens to them
[42:33] salt I think had a half chapter where he
[42:36] did good
[42:38] and literally from there it was all
[42:40] downhill
[42:42] and you look at him his base is for
[42:44] anything that he did was based in in the
[42:46] fear of the people
[42:47] fear of how he would look and everything
[42:49] was my control was Saul
[42:51] he had zero trust in God zero when
[42:55] anything was going wrong he would
[42:57] immediately do a knee-jerk he would try
[42:59] to take control the situation God
[43:00] literally ran the kingdom away from him
[43:04] so at this point God is now given Israel
[43:06] their fill
[43:07] and now he's going to give them someone
[43:09] who he's going to choose
[43:11] so Samuel sent to the house of Jesse
[43:14] and we all know the story that you know
[43:16] they go through all the sons Jesse
[43:18] doesn't even bother bringing David in
[43:20] because it's just there's no way
[43:22] and Samuel's thinking the same thing
[43:24] like these these kids are you know
[43:26] they're handsome they're strong they're
[43:28] you make a great king and God
[43:29] essentially slapped around a little bit
[43:31] and said you got to look at the heart
[43:33] not at the appearance because
[43:35] a good leader is not based on his
[43:38] qualifications it's based on his
[43:40] character and his character alone and is
[43:44] he reliant on God
[43:46] because you don't want someone to be new
[43:47] who's trusted in their own abilities
[43:48] because there's a limit to that
[43:51] there's always a limit to human ability
[43:53] and we see it Tom and Tom again in
[43:55] politics whatever maybe
[43:57] so
[43:59] God rejects each and every one of his
[44:01] brothers he anoints David
[44:05] and we see an immediate change with
[44:06] David it's quite incredible it gets help
[44:09] for any you know young person of whether
[44:11] or not they can make an impact and
[44:12] certainly you can make an impact when
[44:14] you're filled with the Holy Ghost
[44:16] you know because you look at David he he
[44:17] he now he's growing in stature and
[44:19] wisdom with the Holy Ghost
[44:21] you know God brings them testing and
[44:23] trials and you look at you know the lion
[44:26] and the bear like these are not
[44:28] insignificant
[44:29] you know foes you know if anyone
[44:31] came in today and said like I killed a
[44:33] bear today it'd be on the news you know
[44:36] it
[44:36] and that's the thing with us spiritually
[44:38] is that like you see these young young
[44:40] people they get filled the Holy Ghost
[44:41] and you see these strongholds falling
[44:44] these demons being cast out
[44:46] and the same thing in in in God's eyes
[44:49] these are lines and these are bears that
[44:51] these young people are are casting out
[44:53] so the power of the Holy Ghost you know
[44:55] program has a great quote where he talks
[44:57] about you know if the devil possessing
[44:59] someone with an evil spirit can make
[45:00] them strong as eight to nine people
[45:03] how much more does the Holy Spirit when
[45:04] they have full control
[45:06] can have an impact in that person's life
[45:08] and through them
[45:10] so it's just it behooves us to be able
[45:12] to like Lord let me get out of the way
[45:14] so you can have foreign and then there's
[45:18] no no guessing what God can do because
[45:20] we limit God in terms of what he can do
[45:22] he's a gentleman he will only
[45:25] do enough as you let him
[45:28] but if we can let him have his way
[45:29] there's no matter what we can do
[45:32] so what's great about Dave is that as
[45:33] soon as he's chosen you know we see him
[45:36] he he he goes straight back to the
[45:38] Sheepfold
[45:40] and what's remarkable about that is that
[45:42] he was literally just
[45:44] told by the prophet God which is the
[45:45] highest Spiritual Authority in the land
[45:47] at the time you are going to be king
[45:50] I have rejected salt you will be king
[45:51] next
[45:52] and with David it just there's literally
[45:54] no impact like he goes on like nothing's
[45:57] happened
[45:58] which shows that he had character to
[46:00] begin with
[46:01] because if you have been chosen as you
[46:04] know the greatest person in the land at
[46:05] that time it's a very rare person to be
[46:08] to not let it go to their head
[46:09] and to act on it
[46:11] because it's one thing you know most
[46:14] people if they're chosen especially
[46:15] today with no character around you know
[46:18] if someone's like you're going to be the
[46:19] president of the United States like
[46:20] they're going they're you know I'm going
[46:22] to talk to the people we're going to get
[46:23] married
[46:26] but you look here with David he just he
[46:28] goes straight back to his old job
[46:29] why because God doesn't tell him to do
[46:32] anything else
[46:34] go back to the Sheepfold and take care
[46:36] of your sheep and that's what David does
[46:37] and he serves there and he takes care of
[46:39] some the same dirty old smelly sheep
[46:41] that he's been staring at for however
[46:42] many years
[46:44] and the thing about David is that
[46:47] my favorite part about this is that you
[46:49] know we already see in David a servant's
[46:52] heart
[46:53] and the servantar is is a critical
[46:55] component in terms of Godly leadership
[46:59] because without a servant's heart you
[47:01] have a tyrant
[47:02] right and you look at Christ when Christ
[47:05] was
[47:06] you know here we saw him do the same
[47:07] thing he got down on his knees and he
[47:09] watched those those very smelly feet of
[47:12] the disciples without any complaint
[47:15] without any grumbling without anything
[47:17] because he knew that in order to lead
[47:20] you have to learn how to follow
[47:22] and if you're going to be served you've
[47:25] got to learn how to serve right so God
[47:27] requires you to start here before you
[47:29] were up here because characters is a
[47:33] victory not a gift okay and if you
[47:36] wanted to be effective in your
[47:37] leadership you got to learn how to serve
[47:40] in obscurity
[47:41] in silence without any congratulations
[47:45] without anyone saying thank you
[47:48] because that's the key to a servant's
[47:50] hurt is that can you do a job
[47:53] that no one else sees
[47:55] that no one else really you know cares
[47:57] about Faithfully
[48:00] can you do without Applause consistently
[48:02] for a long time
[48:04] or are you grumbling and complaining
[48:06] and whining about it because no one's
[48:08] noticing it and all that stuff that's
[48:10] the key to a servant's heart is that you
[48:11] can do it consistently no matter what
[48:14] because your goal is to make the one
[48:17] that you're serving look good
[48:19] not you
[48:20] look at David his objective was to make
[48:23] his father in Heaven look good not him
[48:27] and we see that consistently throughout
[48:28] his life
[48:29] so
[48:31] overall you know it's just if you can be
[48:33] faithful in the little you can he can
[48:34] grant you the responsibility to be
[48:36] faithful much but it starts with the
[48:38] little things you gotta be faithful in
[48:40] those little things because the
[48:42] foundation got to be strong in order for
[48:44] the rest of the house to be built so if
[48:46] you're not content with what the law
[48:48] that you have then are you neglecting
[48:50] the little things in your life
[48:52] and if you need neglect them God can't
[48:54] trust you with the bigger things so
[48:57] so he goes back here to the Sheepfold
[48:58] and then eventually his which is crazy
[49:01] to me like he's 14 or whatever and his
[49:03] reputation goes to solve King Saul's
[49:07] Court
[49:08] because it was King Saul's couriers and
[49:11] his servants that said you know we know
[49:13] he got an issue
[49:15] and but there's a kid there's a kid in
[49:18] Bethlehem that you know he's he's wise
[49:20] the stature and whatever he does it
[49:22] cause and prospers it and he'll be a
[49:24] good fit for you so Saul is like yeah
[49:26] sure bring one
[49:27] so Davis serves in in Saul's court for
[49:31] we don't really know how long it is and
[49:33] he's a blessing to Saul and eventually
[49:34] you know it's just it's solemn for a bit
[49:36] so when we come to Goliath you know
[49:40] Goliath is is is
[49:43] um
[49:45] up until then
[49:48] David's having the same type of Victory
[49:50] okay
[49:51] he's killing the line he's killing the
[49:53] bear when he gets a Goliath he's killing
[49:55] Goliath and everything is quick quick
[49:56] quick quick quick right
[50:00] so once he goes to physicists his
[50:02] brothers he does his job and then he
[50:04] hears Goliath taunting right
[50:07] and Goliath taunts Israel for where do I
[50:10] appointment
[50:11] there you go
[50:13] so Goliath comes out for 40 days
[50:16] to taunt Israel and no one comes out
[50:19] and 40 is interesting because the
[50:21] program says it represents Temptation
[50:23] Jesus spent 40 days in the wilderness
[50:25] his temptation Moses spent 40 days on
[50:28] Mount Sinai when God was given the Ten
[50:30] Commandments and Israelites made the
[50:31] golden calf it ran for 40 days and four
[50:33] nights during the flood and the
[50:35] Israelites took 40 days to spies out the
[50:36] land of Israel so Temptation here
[50:39] Goliath is representing that thing in
[50:41] your life that is it got boldness and
[50:44] it's coming out every day and saying you
[50:46] can't touch me there's nothing you can
[50:48] do about it and what God is doing is
[50:51] that behind the scenes you know everyone
[50:53] is frightened everyone's frightened
[50:55] about the Big Bad Wolf
[50:56] You Know It's Shouting and and brother
[50:59] says is that when the devil thinks he
[51:01] got you in a corner he gets he gets he
[51:03] gets cocky
[51:07] and
[51:08] the problem there is that when you get
[51:10] cocky
[51:11] you cross the line
[51:13] and that day Goliath there there was a
[51:16] warning that Goliath woke up and it was
[51:18] his last morning
[51:19] where he was going to taunt the children
[51:21] of Israel
[51:22] [Applause]
[51:23] and you look at us there's going to be a
[51:25] morning when that thing in your life is
[51:28] going to taunt you for the last time
[51:31] so God
[51:32] in his great Mercy
[51:34] you see the whole child the whole Army
[51:37] of Israel and they're they're quaking
[51:38] their boots you got big men you got Saul
[51:40] Saul is this big they say he was seven
[51:42] foot tall which is incredible
[51:44] and he's up in his tent hiding away
[51:48] but what God does God takes a a little
[51:51] Shepherd
[51:54] from one of the smallest towns of of
[51:56] Judah
[51:58] and what he's been doing is that behind
[52:00] the scenes he's been preparing this
[52:01] little boy
[52:04] in obscurity
[52:05] in relative silence
[52:08] and no one no one no one sees this
[52:10] happening all right so in the in in in
[52:12] the children of Israel's eyes it's
[52:14] hopeless there's nothing we can do we
[52:17] are going to be slaves it's over
[52:20] says who
[52:21] okay when we put a period behind the
[52:23] situation it's us putting a period
[52:25] behind the situation not God okay so
[52:29] when we put ourselves in a situation say
[52:30] this is it no it's not until God
[52:33] literally tells you this is your burden
[52:35] and this is your cross and you're gonna
[52:36] have to bear it that's when it's a
[52:37] period but until then we can hope and we
[52:41] can rest in the fact that God will
[52:42] arrive on the scene no matter how small
[52:45] or how insignificant that solution may
[52:47] look
[52:49] okay because you look at David you know
[52:51] the Bible you know calls him Ruddy and
[52:53] brother I'm disguises and he's at this
[52:55] little shrimp
[52:57] no one will be impressed by the side of
[52:58] him
[52:59] and he comes in
[53:01] and he's just he's in his path of Duty
[53:03] okay
[53:04] he's serving faithfully and he's in the
[53:06] path of Duty and he's not jumping out
[53:09] take care of the situation the situation
[53:11] comes to him
[53:12] okay and that's that's how it's supposed
[53:14] to happen right we're not supposed to be
[53:16] getting out of our you know getting out
[53:18] of our lane and getting out of our
[53:19] position in order to make things happen
[53:21] you stay in your position there is a
[53:23] protection within that position because
[53:25] God has told you this is your position
[53:27] and you stay there because you look at
[53:30] the children of Israel they each had a
[53:32] unique position in that land because
[53:34] they were built
[53:36] way up out of the land because
[53:38] when they were born
[53:40] that mother of each son of Jacob
[53:44] which in childbirth would scream at a
[53:46] name and that name had a prophecy over
[53:49] that
[53:51] and it was their legacy in each part of
[53:54] the land and to this day it's still the
[53:56] same
[53:57] so when you're in your position
[53:59] there is a strength that comes with it
[54:01] because you are not relying on your own
[54:03] strength you are tapping into God and he
[54:06] you're you're a conduit to him
[54:10] but if you get out of that you turn off
[54:12] the tap of Heaven
[54:14] so here's what Dave's doing David is in
[54:16] his line of duty he is Anointed he's
[54:18] been prepared and now he's ready and he
[54:21] doesn't know this
[54:22] okay
[54:24] little like more often now we don't see
[54:26] the potential inside of us only God sees
[54:28] the potential okay but it takes
[54:30] situations
[54:32] derive on the scene for us to step in
[54:35] and God goes you ready
[54:38] only he knows that so that's where you
[54:40] got to be ready you got to be instant in
[54:42] seasonal season
[54:44] and thank God for Grace because it
[54:46] doesn't
[54:47] you know for for the children of Israel
[54:49] it was it was a conditional Covenant
[54:51] where they had to uphold their end
[54:54] but with us
[54:56] we can't do it because no one can live
[54:58] the life and you look at the law no no
[54:59] one could do it no one did
[55:02] but for us it's an unconditional
[55:03] Covenant meaning that no matter what
[55:06] no matter where you're at it's never too
[55:08] late for one and then secondly there's
[55:10] always Grace for your mistakes
[55:13] the great the the the the greatest
[55:15] Victory is that even if you're falling
[55:17] are you falling forward
[55:19] okay because everything's going to fall
[55:21] no matter what your thing is and when
[55:24] you're over one thing God starts working
[55:25] on the next thing so the main thing is
[55:27] fight fight fight fight
[55:31] and that's that's the mark of the
[55:33] believer is he look at Abraham look at
[55:34] David they never gave up
[55:36] it was Joseph he never gave up each time
[55:39] it seemed like it was he was in a worse
[55:42] situation than before
[55:43] but God sees the end goal
[55:46] we don't
[55:48] so David comes on scene and he's
[55:53] put in a situation where he hears this
[55:56] Goliath speaking
[55:59] and I think Utah talked about
[56:04] where he the first thing wasn't how how
[56:07] tall is is this giant what kind of
[56:09] weapons is he is he wearing does he have
[56:11] any protection around him
[56:13] what's the what's what's the landscape
[56:14] around so I can sneak around and see if
[56:17] there's an angle I can get him at no the
[56:19] first thing that that David does is okay
[56:21] what's the reward for killing this guy
[56:25] as a 14 year old
[56:27] but the difference is that he's anointed
[56:29] for this purpose
[56:31] he's anointed for it the other men
[56:33] weren't
[56:34] and you can see it they weren't anointed
[56:35] for it
[56:37] so David says what's the reward and how
[56:41] dare
[56:42] this uncircumcised philistine
[56:46] put his finger against the children of
[56:48] God
[56:49] so like shamgar he's now going to claim
[56:52] his land right
[56:54] we know the story he you know he he's
[56:56] now talking to his brothers the brothers
[56:58] try to slap him down like typical older
[57:00] brothers do
[57:01] and uh
[57:03] you know there's no double meaning
[57:04] behind that I can assure you
[57:10] know he slapsing down David like any
[57:13] good believer should do ignores it and
[57:15] they bring to Salt Saul tries to
[57:17] discourage him tries to give him tries
[57:20] to get him to do it a different way and
[57:21] Dave's like I I don't trust what you're
[57:23] giving me it doesn't work I don't want
[57:25] to work with it I'd rather just trust
[57:27] God so he goes in kills Goliath cuts off
[57:30] his head everyone's Faith goes through
[57:33] the roof and they chase Goliath or not
[57:35] Goliath Goliath is now dead but they
[57:37] chase the Philistines up okay
[57:40] but the key the key caveat here is that
[57:43] King Saul's first reaction is praise the
[57:46] Lord he's like find out whose son this
[57:48] Stripling is
[57:50] that's literally word for word what he
[57:52] says find out who this the son of this
[57:54] Stripling is
[57:55] so Saul's it's sad for Saul but his
[57:58] first reaction was jealousy and envy
[57:59] rather than thank God for delivering me
[58:03] okay so uh next up
[58:06] you know he at this moment he becomes
[58:08] the instant National celebrity
[58:10] which is again another test of his
[58:12] character
[58:13] you know most people it will be you know
[58:15] all right ready for King
[58:17] and logically you could say that you
[58:20] know he showed he can Inspire men he can
[58:23] fight great goliaths and win he has you
[58:27] know great Charisma blah blah blah blah
[58:29] but God sees
[58:32] what David doesn't that Dave's not
[58:34] writing okay because God doesn't just
[58:37] want a normal King for Israel all the
[58:39] other nations had normal Kings okay and
[58:41] they come and go and they're cut throat
[58:43] and during that time especially you know
[58:45] they're conniving there are politickers
[58:47] and God didn't want that right he wanted
[58:50] someone who is
[58:52] Reliant on his leadership
[58:55] who would listen to him
[58:57] and would trust him
[59:00] so David at this point was didn't have
[59:02] that clearly so at this point David's
[59:06] trials are and his big victories kill
[59:10] and David's faith is high everything's
[59:12] great
[59:13] and what David doesn't see is that he is
[59:17] on the Mountaintop
[59:19] and he got a big long valley right in
[59:21] front of him right so
[59:26] um
[59:28] you know and he he could have
[59:31] he could have you know taken over the
[59:33] Kingdom at that point but he had the
[59:34] character to be able to to wait on God
[59:38] and that's the key thing there is can
[59:40] you wait for the promises of God or are
[59:42] you going to take manners in your own
[59:43] hands and go claim it yourself
[59:45] right because you look at Authority here
[59:47] Authority cannot be taken because if
[59:50] it's taken it's satanic but if it's
[59:52] given
[59:53] it's a seal of God's approval and God
[59:55] can bless it
[59:57] so even though he's anointed he has full
[59:58] right to take over that Kingdom he can't
[1:00:01] because God opens the doors not David
[1:00:04] okay and David was never never never
[1:00:06] willing ever
[1:00:08] to kick down that door because God
[1:00:10] tested him in that area
[1:00:11] look at how many times Saul was
[1:00:12] literally at his feet and David could
[1:00:14] just put the spear in and he could have
[1:00:16] the kingdom but David knew that the
[1:00:18] moment that he did that
[1:00:21] the same because whatever whatever
[1:00:23] measure you meet out will be meted out
[1:00:24] against you
[1:00:26] and if you begin the kingdom in blood it
[1:00:28] will end in blood and David is the only
[1:00:30] probably one of the few Kings in Israel
[1:00:32] that ever died of old age
[1:00:35] despite all he did
[1:00:37] because his ways please the Lord he was
[1:00:39] the only one that didn't die with a
[1:00:41] knife in his heart
[1:00:44] okay so the key is is that God knows
[1:00:46] when you're ready you don't know when
[1:00:47] you're ready give people around you
[1:00:49] especially don't know when you're ready
[1:00:51] it takes God's timing
[1:00:53] but and you'll know when it God's timing
[1:00:55] because not you orchestrating things and
[1:00:57] trying to maneuver and manipulating all
[1:01:00] that stuff God will open up that door
[1:01:02] when it's ready
[1:01:03] and it will be a double blessing
[1:01:05] if you wait for it
[1:01:08] so there's a great quote here
[1:01:10] um
[1:01:11] by Brother Brown and the Philadelphia
[1:01:13] Church age
[1:01:15] to wait for the Fulfillment of that word
[1:01:17] require patience even as it did in the
[1:01:19] case of Abraham he endured as seeing him
[1:01:21] who is invisible he was patient and then
[1:01:23] the word finally was fulfilled this is
[1:01:26] the way God teaches his people patience
[1:01:27] why if it fulfilled his word in the
[1:01:29] physical manifestations the very instant
[1:01:31] you prayed you would never learn
[1:01:32] patience but would become even more
[1:01:35] impatient with life
[1:01:37] and this is hard you know because
[1:01:39] more often not when we pray for
[1:01:41] situation or lay hands you want to see
[1:01:43] immediate results
[1:01:44] because we're taught you know you lay
[1:01:46] your hands upon the sick they shall
[1:01:47] recover and we want to see that instant
[1:01:50] but God has his own way let me show you
[1:01:52] this truth even more fully set forth
[1:01:53] Hebrews 11 7 by faith Abraham when he
[1:01:56] was tried offered up Isaac and he that
[1:01:58] had received the promise the word of God
[1:02:00] offered up only his begotten son there
[1:02:03] it is Abraham was tried after he
[1:02:04] received the word of promised most think
[1:02:06] that as soon as we pray in Jesus name
[1:02:08] over the good Promises of God that there
[1:02:09] could not be a trial but here it says
[1:02:12] that Abraham was tried to receive the
[1:02:13] promise that is exactly correct
[1:02:15] according to the psalmist referring to
[1:02:17] Joseph until that time his word came the
[1:02:19] word of the Lord Tried Him
[1:02:22] God gives us exceeding great and
[1:02:23] precious promises he has promised to
[1:02:25] fulfill them he will but from the time
[1:02:27] we pray until the time we get the answer
[1:02:29] we must learn to receive patience into
[1:02:31] our souls for only impatience do we
[1:02:33] possess life may God help us to learn
[1:02:36] this lesson even as we know the people
[1:02:37] of this six age learn patience we read
[1:02:40] the history of the lives of those great
[1:02:41] Christians what a contrast you see
[1:02:44] between their lives and ours for they
[1:02:45] were so patient and quiet and today we
[1:02:48] are all about overcoming over patients
[1:02:49] and haste and that's the time before
[1:02:51] smartphones and computers and high-speed
[1:02:54] internet
[1:02:54] how much worse is it now
[1:02:57] so David at this point
[1:03:00] is learning patience he's learning how
[1:03:02] to wait
[1:03:03] is learning how to trust the name of the
[1:03:05] Lord
[1:03:06] so let's uh let's now turn to First
[1:03:08] Samuel 18 the review is over
[1:03:12] after half an hour
[1:03:14] oh boy
[1:03:16] all right let's turn to First Samuel 18
[1:03:17] or you can just follow him here because
[1:03:19] I'm going to be skipping along so it's
[1:03:20] up to you
[1:03:21] so at this point
[1:03:23] um
[1:03:24] we're we're at the top of the
[1:03:26] Mountaintop
[1:03:28] Saul goes crazy and he tries to
[1:03:31] um essentially
[1:03:34] secured skewered David a bunch of times
[1:03:36] okay
[1:03:37] and Dave went out went out with us
[1:03:39] whoever Saul sent him and behaved
[1:03:41] himself wisely and Saul said him over
[1:03:43] the men of war and he was accepted in
[1:03:44] the sight of all people and also in the
[1:03:45] sight of Soul servants and he came to
[1:03:47] pass as they came when David was turned
[1:03:49] from the slaughter of the Philistine
[1:03:50] that the women came out of all the
[1:03:52] cities the Israel singing and dancing to
[1:03:54] meet King Saul with taboris with joy and
[1:03:55] with instruments of music and the women
[1:03:57] answered one another as they played and
[1:03:59] said Saul has slain as thousands and
[1:04:00] David is ten thousands and Saul was very
[1:04:03] Roth and the same displeased him and he
[1:04:04] said they have ascribed on the day of
[1:04:06] ten thousands and to me they have
[1:04:08] ascribed but thousands and why can't he
[1:04:10] have more but the kingdom and Saul odd
[1:04:12] Dave I'd David from that day forward
[1:04:15] and it's hard to have a
[1:04:17] a song in your life because it's
[1:04:20] that requires patients
[1:04:23] when you're dealing with a difficult
[1:04:24] personality you can't do anything about
[1:04:25] and God's just using it as a
[1:04:28] as a grinding stone
[1:04:31] and those are the moments that you got
[1:04:32] you got to learn to give your problems
[1:04:33] to God because God's the only person
[1:04:35] that can Harden and soften the heart
[1:04:38] you know we can't we can't do that you
[1:04:40] can't fight fire with fire with people
[1:04:42] you got to let the God who created that
[1:04:44] heart
[1:04:45] this often hurt as he needs to because
[1:04:47] he has an ultimate purpose in it
[1:04:50] right so David or Saul
[1:04:53] tries to kill David with a javelin he
[1:04:56] tries to put David and Paul and David in
[1:04:57] an impossible situation with the Dowry
[1:04:59] from uh
[1:05:01] McCall or Michael or whatever her name
[1:05:03] was
[1:05:04] tries to get the Philistines to kill him
[1:05:05] and then he tries to get his servants
[1:05:07] and Jonathan to kill David right
[1:05:10] but David keeps on serving Faithfully no
[1:05:13] matter what
[1:05:15] and at this point you know I'm going to
[1:05:17] skip this one but Saul again
[1:05:20] finally tries to kill him again with a
[1:05:21] javelin and Dave's like I'm out of here
[1:05:25] all right so at this point you know
[1:05:26] we're at the
[1:05:28] um
[1:05:30] we're at the Apex of where David was in
[1:05:33] his
[1:05:34] climb in terms of Man's eyes he was a
[1:05:37] general in Saul's Army he was married to
[1:05:40] the wife of the king
[1:05:42] you know he was in the king's court
[1:05:44] you know he was famous he was a great
[1:05:47] warrior
[1:05:48] he had a maid in Man's eyes okay he was
[1:05:50] just a couple steps away from from the
[1:05:52] throne
[1:05:54] but at this point God says no I'm going
[1:05:57] to test you and I'm going to test you
[1:05:58] hard and I'm going to test you long
[1:05:59] because you need to be ready
[1:06:02] to be fit to rule okay
[1:06:06] because
[1:06:07] you know we'll skip that for now okay so
[1:06:10] uh let's go to First Samuel 20 verse 1
[1:06:13] and David fled from naoth and Rema and
[1:06:15] came and said before Jonathan what have
[1:06:16] I done what is my iniquity and what is
[1:06:19] my sin before thy father that he saketh
[1:06:21] my life and he said unto him God forbid
[1:06:22] thou shall not die behold my father will
[1:06:24] do nothing either great or small but
[1:06:26] that he will show it to me and why
[1:06:28] should my father hide this thing for me
[1:06:29] it is not so
[1:06:31] so if we skip down to the very bottom
[1:06:33] but as truly as the Lord liveth and as
[1:06:35] thy Soul liveth there is but a step
[1:06:37] between me and death and this is David
[1:06:38] saying this here that at this point I'm
[1:06:41] a hair's breath away from being killed
[1:06:44] by your dad right so we're no longer
[1:06:46] seeing the same faith that David had
[1:06:48] with Goliath he could handle the
[1:06:50] Philistine but he couldn't handle the
[1:06:52] king wanted to kill him okay so God's
[1:06:54] now dealing him a situation that he
[1:06:56] doesn't know how to deal with
[1:06:58] and what you're seeing now is that David
[1:06:59] was very strong in dealing with Goliath
[1:07:02] he was ready for that but then God says
[1:07:04] okay now I'm going to work on your Honda
[1:07:06] parts where you're nice and soft and you
[1:07:09] need to develop some strength there and
[1:07:11] David is totally
[1:07:13] he totally loses control
[1:07:15] he he starts you know we're going to see
[1:07:18] a very rapid Descent of David's uh
[1:07:22] objective thinking and ability to think
[1:07:25] rationally because he starts to do some
[1:07:27] kind of crazy things because
[1:07:30] God allowed a situation to come in from
[1:07:32] South that he wasn't expecting
[1:07:35] okay so at this point you know David is
[1:07:38] now fleeing from Saul
[1:07:41] at this point he's now lost his position
[1:07:43] in the army
[1:07:45] his wife is now gone
[1:07:47] Saul literally then gives his wife to
[1:07:50] another man
[1:07:52] and he David fled to the prophet Samuel
[1:07:58] and then he has a flee again because
[1:07:59] Saul's following him and you never see
[1:08:00] Samuel again okay so he lost his
[1:08:03] position
[1:08:04] his wife
[1:08:06] his access to the prophet
[1:08:08] and then after this he doesn't have any
[1:08:09] access to Jonathan's best friend and his
[1:08:11] only man inside the court on his behalf
[1:08:14] so Jonathan's now gone right
[1:08:17] so at this point
[1:08:20] we see David he's now starting to lose
[1:08:22] trust he's looking at a situation here
[1:08:24] because he's saying there's but a step
[1:08:25] between me and death what he's what he's
[1:08:27] doing now he's taking his eyes off the
[1:08:29] promise that hey I'm a king
[1:08:31] I'm going to be a king God promised it
[1:08:34] that means God's going to fulfill it and
[1:08:36] it doesn't matter what's happening to me
[1:08:37] God's going to make it happen so now
[1:08:39] he's starting to look at his situations
[1:08:40] and he's starting to Quake right so at
[1:08:43] this point self-preservation is kicking
[1:08:46] in
[1:08:47] and self-preservation is is that flight
[1:08:50] or fight
[1:08:51] Instinct that kicks in when we're in
[1:08:54] situations where we're scared we don't
[1:08:56] know how to react
[1:08:58] and you just want to do something
[1:09:00] and that's the worst thing you could do
[1:09:01] in situations like this because you want
[1:09:03] to more often not you're doing that
[1:09:06] decision out of fear
[1:09:08] and it's going to blow up and we see
[1:09:10] that with David
[1:09:12] so uh
[1:09:14] uh verse 4 then said Jonathan unto David
[1:09:16] whatsoever thy soul desireth I will do
[1:09:17] it even for thee
[1:09:19] and David said unto Jonathan behold
[1:09:21] tomorrow is the new moon and I should
[1:09:23] not fail to sit with the king at me but
[1:09:24] let me go that I might hide myself in
[1:09:26] the field until the third day at Even If
[1:09:28] thy father at all miss me then say David
[1:09:29] earnsly asked leave of me that he might
[1:09:32] run to Bethlehem his City for there is a
[1:09:34] yearly sacrifice there for all the
[1:09:36] family so this is a blatant line
[1:09:39] he's trying to get Jonathan to say tell
[1:09:41] your dad this
[1:09:42] so we can find out what he what how he's
[1:09:44] going to react
[1:09:46] so he's putting his best friend in a
[1:09:48] situation where he's going to lie
[1:09:50] and then we see after this David runs to
[1:09:55] um knob which is the city where the
[1:09:57] priests were
[1:09:59] and
[1:10:00] at this point David does the same thing
[1:10:03] he deceived the priest tells him the
[1:10:05] king hath commanded me a business
[1:10:07] and this is why I'm here
[1:10:09] and after this whole situation
[1:10:13] you know Saul does the unthinkable and
[1:10:15] says kill them all
[1:10:17] for they helped David and Saul killed
[1:10:20] all all the priests the whole city and
[1:10:23] he kills everything which is rare
[1:10:24] because it's all one time the Samo told
[1:10:27] him to kill everything it's all doesn't
[1:10:28] do it
[1:10:30] so David at this point officially hits
[1:10:33] rock bottom and this is when he goes to
[1:10:35] gath and he meets the the king of gath
[1:10:38] which his name is akish
[1:10:41] and verse 12 here in the middle and
[1:10:43] David laid up these words in his heart
[1:10:44] and was sore afraid of akish the king of
[1:10:46] death and he changed his behavior before
[1:10:48] them and feeding himself mad in their
[1:10:50] hands and scrabbled on the doors of the
[1:10:52] gate and let his spittle fall upon his
[1:10:53] beard then said akeish unto his servants
[1:10:55] lo you see the man is mad wherefore then
[1:10:58] have you brought me him to me have I
[1:11:00] need a Madman that he have brought this
[1:11:02] fellow to play The Madman in my presence
[1:11:03] shall this fellow will come to my house
[1:11:07] so David at this point he's
[1:11:11] lost all these things and funny he loses
[1:11:13] his dignity he goes
[1:11:15] to the one place where his sworn enemy
[1:11:17] was Goliath
[1:11:19] he realizes how bad of a situation he's
[1:11:22] in now and has to do whatever he has to
[1:11:25] do to get out of that situation and he
[1:11:28] pretends to be insane and he's literally
[1:11:30] foaming at the mouth and she's like get
[1:11:32] him out of here
[1:11:33] and that's the grace of God to David
[1:11:36] because I would say there was a bounty
[1:11:38] on David's head in the city of gath
[1:11:41] okay so uh at this point David finally
[1:11:45] reaches the cave adulam and we see here
[1:11:48] in chapter 22 David therefore departed
[1:11:50] dance and escaped to the cave of dulham
[1:11:54] and this is where
[1:11:55] David is totally alone
[1:11:58] he had nothing left
[1:12:00] literally nothing
[1:12:02] all he has is a sword of Goliath and
[1:12:05] some bread from the city of Knob and
[1:12:07] that's it
[1:12:08] no one to help him he has no connections
[1:12:12] there's no hope Saul's right out his
[1:12:14] tail and he and Dave is now going
[1:12:16] through his first Valley of the shadow
[1:12:17] of death okay
[1:12:19] and think about the Valley of the shadow
[1:12:21] of death there's a reason why it says
[1:12:23] the Valley of the shadow of death and
[1:12:25] not the valley of death
[1:12:27] because there's a key difference between
[1:12:28] the two the shadow of death is just the
[1:12:31] mirror uh it feels like it's death but
[1:12:35] it's not death itself
[1:12:36] and we can be put in these situations
[1:12:38] where it feels like death is pressing
[1:12:40] and at the door but it's just a shadow
[1:12:43] it's just a big Bluff and all it is is
[1:12:46] God's saying no no no you're only going
[1:12:49] to I'll be allowed to frighten him you
[1:12:51] can't actually put your hands on them
[1:12:53] so Dave's now in a situation where he's
[1:12:56] feeling he's tasting death on every
[1:12:58] every corner
[1:13:01] and that's why we see you know Psalms
[1:13:03] like Psalm 23 come on the scene and
[1:13:05] other Psalms where you see this man is
[1:13:08] now learning how to be on the bottom
[1:13:11] okay
[1:13:12] and it's it's in the mud more often not
[1:13:14] where we learn character and how we
[1:13:16] learn how to trust God and because
[1:13:18] there's nothing else to trust like and
[1:13:20] that's the thing about the valley is
[1:13:22] that the valley is where you can't
[1:13:25] really see the Mountaintop is easy
[1:13:26] because you can see you're far away but
[1:13:27] once you're down in the valley you've
[1:13:29] got fog and you've got rain and you've
[1:13:31] got forest and you have all these things
[1:13:33] you can't see so you're losing the
[1:13:34] vision okay so that's why you can't walk
[1:13:36] by sight is because
[1:13:39] you're going to get lost
[1:13:41] whereas if you walk by faith faith is
[1:13:43] seen past all those obstacles and all
[1:13:45] those things and it's going to guide you
[1:13:46] one step at a time
[1:13:48] it's like diverse sin Isaiah that there
[1:13:50] will be a voice behind you say this is
[1:13:52] the way when you turn to the right when
[1:13:55] you turn to the left and it's going to
[1:13:56] guide you each step
[1:13:58] but it takes situations like that for
[1:14:00] our ear to get tuned to that
[1:14:03] because you know tons of comfort of
[1:14:05] comfort and prosperity are great and we
[1:14:08] praise the Lord for it but you get
[1:14:10] complacent and you get lazy and you get
[1:14:14] lazy really
[1:14:16] but it takes those times of where you're
[1:14:19] in the grindstone
[1:14:20] that you learn to not rely on this
[1:14:25] because it's failed you
[1:14:28] but it's those times where God is saying
[1:14:30] no okay
[1:14:31] it's enough you need to start trusting
[1:14:33] me and I will show you a better way than
[1:14:36] the way that you've been doing
[1:14:38] so
[1:14:39] at this point in the cave of Doom is
[1:14:40] where we just read the opening scripture
[1:14:43] of Psalms 142 and that's why we see in
[1:14:46] verse 3 he's saying when my spirit was
[1:14:48] overwhelmed Within Me
[1:14:50] you know verse four I looked on my right
[1:14:52] hand behold there was no man that would
[1:14:53] know me
[1:14:54] Refuge failed me no man cared for my
[1:14:56] soul
[1:14:57] this is a man who is alone who has no
[1:15:00] hope
[1:15:01] nothing
[1:15:02] and I cried unto the O Lord and I said
[1:15:04] Thou Art my refuge on my portion in the
[1:15:07] land of living attend unto my cry for
[1:15:08] him brought very low deliver me from my
[1:15:10] persecutors for they are stronger than I
[1:15:14] bring my soul out of prison then I might
[1:15:15] praise thy name the righteous shall
[1:15:17] Compass me about for thou shall deal
[1:15:18] bountifully with me
[1:15:22] after this point you know he's he's
[1:15:24] going to go through a valley and there's
[1:15:26] a great um quote
[1:15:28] well you know it's all right to be on
[1:15:30] the Mountaintop that's good but let me
[1:15:31] tell you your fruits will freeze up
[1:15:33] there at night and when the cold spell
[1:15:35] comes you lose all your fruit that's
[1:15:37] what happened now we put too much a
[1:15:39] Mountaintop experiences of dancing and
[1:15:40] shaking jump around instead of all night
[1:15:42] prayer meetings down in the valley of
[1:15:43] decision we have come down there and
[1:15:45] meet God and really pour out your life
[1:15:46] until something takes place
[1:15:48] we've grown fruits up there but the
[1:15:50] freeze kills it that's right every time
[1:15:52] it comes a little cool spell you got
[1:15:53] nothing to rest upon when the emotion
[1:15:55] dies down then the shout's all gone the
[1:15:57] noises seat and then where are you at
[1:15:58] the Temptation comes along
[1:16:00] then you can't take it and there's
[1:16:02] nothing wrong with the shouting and all
[1:16:03] that stuff
[1:16:04] but you can't you can't subsist on it
[1:16:07] you can't rely on it completely you got
[1:16:09] to learn how to trust God in the good
[1:16:11] times and in the bad times a good crop
[1:16:14] requires a wet season and a dry season
[1:16:16] too much rain in the drowns too much sun
[1:16:18] and it burns
[1:16:20] so we need to balance of both
[1:16:22] okay so the next thing here is
[1:16:26] you know God is
[1:16:29] got him in a position where he can
[1:16:30] finally work with them
[1:16:33] and
[1:16:36] you know we see we see her in this next
[1:16:38] quote that Professor by Perfect wheat is
[1:16:41] the cases with us that were not that
[1:16:43] we're too weak the cases were too strong
[1:16:45] we're just too strong that's all the
[1:16:47] thing of it is that we're too
[1:16:47] strong-headed that's right we're too
[1:16:49] strong in our head we know too much
[1:16:52] God wants to get that out of us that's
[1:16:53] right
[1:16:54] we're too strong we're too strong to
[1:16:56] yield to him
[1:16:57] and within the same message he talks
[1:16:59] about you got to lose if you want to do
[1:17:00] anything for God you got to lose the
[1:17:02] thought of human ability
[1:17:04] because it's only when you're weak
[1:17:05] you're going to be strong and you're
[1:17:06] going to be of use in the Kingdom
[1:17:08] so at this point
[1:17:10] what God is doing is that God is God has
[1:17:12] taken David and has gone crack
[1:17:15] and David is now in a position where
[1:17:18] he's going to listen
[1:17:19] and that's the difference here is that
[1:17:22] you know
[1:17:24] it was going to be hard for him to
[1:17:25] listen when he's in the king's court and
[1:17:27] everyone sings his Praises it's now in
[1:17:28] the cave that he can listen fully and
[1:17:30] he'd be willing to do what God tells him
[1:17:32] because there is no other recourse
[1:17:35] and sometimes God has got to get us in
[1:17:37] those situations right it feels like
[1:17:39] he's taking away everything there's
[1:17:40] nothing left there's no Fellowship you
[1:17:42] know everything in your life it seems
[1:17:43] like it's falling apart and what he's
[1:17:46] doing is that he's getting you to a
[1:17:47] situation where you'll finally yield
[1:17:51] because that's the thing about the human
[1:17:53] spirits that is strong like it's it's
[1:17:55] shockingly strong you see people and the
[1:17:57] amount of things they can go through and
[1:17:59] and endure without the Holy Ghost is
[1:18:01] incredible
[1:18:02] but God can't use those people because
[1:18:04] they're too stubborn and they're too
[1:18:06] proud God wants a people that are weak
[1:18:09] because then he can be strong on their
[1:18:11] behalf and he can be strong through them
[1:18:14] and they can finally be of use in the
[1:18:15] Kingdom
[1:18:17] so you know
[1:18:18] it was a lonely place in that cave
[1:18:22] and Brokenness is a lonely place to be
[1:18:25] in
[1:18:26] because you know
[1:18:28] a Brokenness can can be in it may not be
[1:18:31] you know everything in your life it
[1:18:32] could be in an area of your life it
[1:18:33] could be you know marriage problems it
[1:18:35] could be financial problems it could be
[1:18:36] you know you're on the verge of a new
[1:18:39] change or God's putting you in a new
[1:18:41] position or whatever or sickness and
[1:18:44] health and all that stuff whatever the
[1:18:45] situation is
[1:18:47] it's right for God to work on it
[1:18:50] and when God is putting his finger on
[1:18:52] that on that situation
[1:18:55] you know more often not we we start to
[1:18:57] freak out
[1:18:58] we start
[1:19:00] forgetting you know going to him we
[1:19:04] start trying to fix the situation
[1:19:06] ourselves and what we find is that in
[1:19:08] those situations we make a further mess
[1:19:10] of it
[1:19:11] no different than what David did
[1:19:13] but the big thing here is that God knew
[1:19:16] exactly how much pressure to apply to
[1:19:19] David for David to get into a position
[1:19:21] where he'd be willing to listen and obey
[1:19:22] God okay and God knows exactly how much
[1:19:25] pressure you're going to need
[1:19:27] for you to finally obey
[1:19:30] and it doesn't feel good Brokenness is
[1:19:32] not a nice place
[1:19:33] no one here enjoys being broken
[1:19:36] but there is no greater thing
[1:19:39] no greater thing
[1:19:41] because what it is is that it's break
[1:19:43] that process of being broken is not not
[1:19:46] only does it get rid of the bad
[1:19:49] but God also it produces life okay
[1:19:52] because those things that you didn't
[1:19:54] realize were inside of you that the
[1:19:55] potential of God that he placed me
[1:19:57] inside you is now being burst forth and
[1:20:00] the only thing that could burst it forth
[1:20:01] was that pressure
[1:20:03] and it's hard it's hard you know it's
[1:20:07] it must have been humiliating
[1:20:09] for David
[1:20:12] humiliation and shame is there are two
[1:20:14] very hard emotions to deal with because
[1:20:17] it's just it just it eats at you
[1:20:21] and with David you know he he went from
[1:20:22] being the the biggest hero to down to
[1:20:25] the biggest zero in a matter of that
[1:20:29] and at that point you you could very
[1:20:31] easily say David had full reason right
[1:20:34] to give up at that point and say there's
[1:20:36] no way
[1:20:37] that it's going to happen he's the
[1:20:40] furthest away from the throne he's ever
[1:20:42] been and it looks like a complete
[1:20:44] impossibility
[1:20:46] for what God or what David doesn't see
[1:20:49] is that God can turn a situation just
[1:20:51] like that
[1:20:52] but also got or David didn't know is
[1:20:54] that he was going to be in for a 15-year
[1:20:55] trial
[1:20:56] breaking him down and learning how to
[1:20:59] let God fight his battles for a turn
[1:21:02] rather than David's swinging the sword
[1:21:05] because for the next 15 years the only
[1:21:07] enemies he kills
[1:21:08] are the enemies that are attacking
[1:21:11] Israel
[1:21:12] not even Philistines for Pete's sake
[1:21:13] that's how bad David got to a point
[1:21:16] so
[1:21:18] same thing with us where you know we are
[1:21:20] put in situations where
[1:21:22] we're used to dealing with things a
[1:21:23] certain way and then God says okay
[1:21:26] you got to rely on me now
[1:21:28] you gotta rely on me to fix your
[1:21:30] problems and to fix your situations and
[1:21:32] that's the thing about faith is that
[1:21:34] faith is hard okay
[1:21:35] people like works because it's easy it's
[1:21:38] X Plus y equals z
[1:21:41] and you follow the same steps and you
[1:21:43] get the same output and it's nice and
[1:21:44] easy and everyone's having a great time
[1:21:46] whereas faith
[1:21:47] faith can lead you down strange paths
[1:21:52] faith can lead you down very lonely
[1:21:54] paths
[1:21:55] where you're going to have to do hard
[1:21:57] things
[1:21:58] and you're forced into position where
[1:22:00] you're going to have to say things that
[1:22:02] it's going to hurt your family or hurt
[1:22:04] your spouse or hurt your kids or your or
[1:22:06] whoever
[1:22:08] and it's a very lonely place
[1:22:11] and we've all been there where you you
[1:22:13] it's just you're put in situations where
[1:22:16] you're you have to choose between God
[1:22:18] and something else and God has to win
[1:22:20] every time
[1:22:21] because if you don't choose God and
[1:22:23] you're his good luck
[1:22:26] because he's going to find a way to get
[1:22:28] back to number one
[1:22:29] and you're going to have some scars at
[1:22:30] the end of it
[1:22:32] you won't be lost
[1:22:33] but you'll be hurting
[1:22:35] and we've all been there where it's just
[1:22:37] you don't put God first and he reminds
[1:22:39] you
[1:22:40] it's that chastening process and thank
[1:22:42] God for that chasing process because
[1:22:44] he's not going to have a bunch of
[1:22:45] spoiled brats as as kings and queens
[1:22:47] he's going to have a mature bride that
[1:22:50] has character knows how to rule
[1:22:53] so
[1:22:54] at this point you know it's uh
[1:22:57] you know it's like this quote here every
[1:22:59] time a wind hits a tree and shoves it
[1:23:01] back and forth it only loosens The Roots
[1:23:04] so it can grow deeper and get a better
[1:23:05] hold
[1:23:07] every time sickness strikes your home
[1:23:09] every time trial strikes your home every
[1:23:11] time the neighbor says something bad
[1:23:12] about you it's only shaking you
[1:23:14] loosening you up so you can get down and
[1:23:16] get a better hold on the Eternal Rock of
[1:23:18] God's unmovable word and that's how God
[1:23:20] does it he sends these trials to test
[1:23:22] you and to prove you to shake you up and
[1:23:24] give you a new hold
[1:23:25] and it's only through the trials that
[1:23:27] does it because we're lazy and we seek
[1:23:30] the path of least resistance and we're
[1:23:32] always wanting it as a flowery bed of
[1:23:34] ease but God is a good tutor
[1:23:36] and he has an obligation to you
[1:23:39] to tutor you
[1:23:41] so it's during these times where he's
[1:23:44] identified an area of life that this has
[1:23:46] gone on far too long
[1:23:48] and it could be you know it could be
[1:23:50] something that's afflicting you or it
[1:23:51] could be a bad habit or would be setting
[1:23:52] sin or whatever it may be but when there
[1:23:55] comes a point where God says enough is
[1:23:56] enough
[1:23:57] then God starts applying that pressure
[1:23:59] and don't be surprised when God starts
[1:24:01] sending in the winds he starts sending
[1:24:03] in all these things because you look at
[1:24:05] Job the same thing
[1:24:06] out of nowhere boom it starts happening
[1:24:09] and same thing with David
[1:24:11] but it's it's it's it's God who is rich
[1:24:14] in his Mercy that does it it's that
[1:24:16] tender hand of Jehovah it doesn't feel
[1:24:18] tender at the time it's only in
[1:24:20] hindsight when you're through it that
[1:24:21] you see and recognize the tender hand of
[1:24:23] Jehovah
[1:24:26] um
[1:24:28] another great quote here is in the same
[1:24:30] way it is with us it isn't what we fight
[1:24:32] and Pull and hurry and know if if I
[1:24:35] don't get this if I don't get that
[1:24:36] that's not it it's to know that the law
[1:24:37] of life is in you and you just let go
[1:24:39] and let God then he takes you to your
[1:24:41] healing takes you to the baptism of the
[1:24:43] spirit or anything that he's promised
[1:24:45] any claim that he's given is yours and
[1:24:46] by letting go and letting God
[1:24:49] and once you release your hands in the
[1:24:50] situation you watch how quickly God will
[1:24:53] move
[1:24:54] because God's a gentleman he will wait
[1:24:56] until you give him permission
[1:25:00] and when he's when you're in a situation
[1:25:02] where it's just it's hopeless and it
[1:25:05] seems nothing is moving
[1:25:07] nothing's giving away
[1:25:09] that's that's when God is a specialist
[1:25:13] because he specializes in the impossible
[1:25:16] and he relishes The Impossible I feel
[1:25:20] because he loves to come in a scene
[1:25:22] is no different than you know Jesus
[1:25:24] walking on that water out to the
[1:25:27] disciples it's shown them I have power
[1:25:30] over everything
[1:25:32] and like you can trust me to take care
[1:25:34] of everything
[1:25:35] and that's the thing here is that when
[1:25:38] we're putting those hopeless situations
[1:25:42] we have to let God take control because
[1:25:45] once he starts moving then he starts
[1:25:48] restoring
[1:25:49] and the amazing thing about God's
[1:25:51] restoration is that it's complete it's
[1:25:54] whole and it's perfect
[1:25:57] so
[1:25:58] the hard part about that place of
[1:26:01] Brokenness is that it feels painful it
[1:26:03] doesn't feel Fair it doesn't feel right
[1:26:07] I'm a Child of God why am I going
[1:26:08] through this why isn't he listening to
[1:26:10] me why is he not answering my prayers
[1:26:12] because it's those times of Silence
[1:26:16] that's really really hard for a Believer
[1:26:18] to just sit back and wait
[1:26:20] because you want to do something
[1:26:23] but you got to have the faith to be able
[1:26:25] to hold on and realize that it's in that
[1:26:27] time of waiting that endurance is being
[1:26:29] built
[1:26:31] because with possess with patients
[1:26:33] possessing your souls
[1:26:35] the thing to recognize is God's gentle
[1:26:38] it doesn't feel gentle to us but he
[1:26:40] knows just how far to take your trial
[1:26:42] without hurting you
[1:26:43] okay because we think you know it's he's
[1:26:47] going to deform us it's going to be
[1:26:48] scars all these things but you'll come
[1:26:50] through as gold
[1:26:51] so if you look at you know brief Segway
[1:26:55] the the Olive Tree is a really
[1:26:58] interesting study because you look in
[1:27:00] scripture it's you see it throughout
[1:27:01] scripture you have the Olive Branch with
[1:27:04] um Noah's Ark and you see you know the
[1:27:07] two olive trees in Zechariah and you see
[1:27:09] the the role of oil and anointing the
[1:27:11] Kings and all that stuff
[1:27:13] and in Romans Paul talks about how
[1:27:16] you know that Gentile that Wild Olive
[1:27:18] Branch is grafted into the Olive Tree
[1:27:21] so when you look at the the olive it's
[1:27:24] and it's also typed as a holy spirit
[1:27:25] that's the main one
[1:27:26] Dollar Tree is is
[1:27:28] one of the most resistant species of
[1:27:30] trees is extremely strong it can live
[1:27:32] for up to a thousand years it can
[1:27:34] withstand freezing you can't kill it
[1:27:36] the only way to kill an olive tree is by
[1:27:38] uprooting it
[1:27:40] uh
[1:27:41] you gotta it has to be ripped out of
[1:27:44] place destroyed and uprooted otherwise
[1:27:45] it will continue to keep growing back
[1:27:47] every time
[1:27:49] no matter what
[1:27:50] so you have to get rid of the whole root
[1:27:52] system in order for that olive tree to
[1:27:54] finally die
[1:27:56] um they're known for deeply embedding
[1:27:58] their Roots into the ground
[1:27:59] uh but especially during the the process
[1:28:03] of turning olives into olive oil it's an
[1:28:05] extremely labor-intensive process and
[1:28:07] it's very nuanced okay
[1:28:08] so you got to first know when to harvest
[1:28:12] the olives because if you do too early
[1:28:14] the oil will be bitter and if you do it
[1:28:16] too late it's going to be Rancid
[1:28:18] so you gotta wait for the right time to
[1:28:20] harvest those olives
[1:28:22] and when they're harvested they're hers
[1:28:24] rocks
[1:28:25] and the only way for that for that oil
[1:28:28] to come out is for it to go through the
[1:28:30] crushing okay
[1:28:32] and
[1:28:34] you know it's
[1:28:36] it only takes it takes people with
[1:28:38] experience and with a lot of knowledge
[1:28:40] to be able to do that harvesting process
[1:28:43] in the processing process correctly
[1:28:46] so in terms of all production the first
[1:28:48] step was to crush the olives using a
[1:28:51] crushing stone or a millstone as you see
[1:28:52] here into a paste
[1:28:54] and during that process the the the
[1:28:56] firmer had to be really careful how
[1:28:58] closely this big Stone here is to this
[1:29:03] because if it does it too close to the
[1:29:05] olives it's going to crush the inner nut
[1:29:07] and that internet will make the whole
[1:29:09] thing bitter
[1:29:10] and if it doesn't do high enough it's
[1:29:12] not going to crush it the the oil is not
[1:29:14] going to come out
[1:29:15] so then the next thing is that once it's
[1:29:18] it's crushed it's turned to a paste and
[1:29:21] that paste is collected into baskets and
[1:29:23] those baskets are stacked and put into
[1:29:25] this press
[1:29:27] and the amount of pressure that that's
[1:29:29] putting on those baskets is insane it's
[1:29:31] like 5 900 square inches or something or
[1:29:33] pounds per square inch
[1:29:35] insane amount of pressure
[1:29:38] and every bit of oil that's in there is
[1:29:40] going to come out
[1:29:41] but the key thing here is that you got
[1:29:44] to watch the Heat because if the Heat's
[1:29:45] too high it starts creating they call
[1:29:48] them free radicals and it's these
[1:29:49] chemicals that can turn the batch
[1:29:52] and what's crazy about those chemicals
[1:29:54] is that if they get into the batch
[1:29:57] they're so destructive it actually
[1:29:58] causes cell aging and even cancer
[1:30:01] if you don't watch it so you got to be
[1:30:02] really careful about how much
[1:30:04] temperature or how hot the temperature
[1:30:05] gets during that process
[1:30:07] and then the final thing is that the oil
[1:30:08] is poured into containers where the oil
[1:30:10] separates from the water because the
[1:30:12] water the water is the waste
[1:30:14] and then it's stored to settle and
[1:30:15] during that process of settling it
[1:30:17] eliminates the bitter Aromas
[1:30:20] in the oil and then it it creates sweet
[1:30:23] and pleasant Aromas
[1:30:26] and then the end product is this golden
[1:30:28] beautiful olive oil which the ancient
[1:30:30] Greeks Greeks called Liquid Gold
[1:30:34] and it's it's it's an amazing SuperFood
[1:30:38] the health benefits are amazing because
[1:30:40] it's it reduces stroke protects against
[1:30:42] heart disease reduces risk of diabetes
[1:30:45] improves bone health aids weight loss
[1:30:47] protects against cancer has
[1:30:48] antibacterial properties and reduces the
[1:30:50] risk of Alzheimer's and arthritis
[1:30:54] it covers everything
[1:30:56] okay
[1:30:58] so at the Last Supper
[1:31:01] Jesus goes to a place called the Mount
[1:31:03] of Olives to pray
[1:31:05] and specifically he goes to the
[1:31:06] government of Gethsemane and the Hebrew
[1:31:08] word for oil press is Gethsemane
[1:31:13] okay
[1:31:14] so Christ's body may have been torn
[1:31:17] apart on the cross but his Spirit was
[1:31:18] crushed in that Garden
[1:31:21] and we see here see it takes a
[1:31:22] crucifixion it takes a crushing of the
[1:31:24] flower to bring perfume from it takes a
[1:31:26] crushing of a life to get the best out
[1:31:28] of it that there is that's the reason
[1:31:30] Jesus had to be crushed to bring forth
[1:31:31] what he was he could not stand before
[1:31:33] the crucifixion and say all powers in
[1:31:35] heavens and earth is given unto my hands
[1:31:37] but after the crucifixion he can stand
[1:31:39] and say all powers in heavens and earth
[1:31:40] is given unto my hand but what did it do
[1:31:43] it taken crucifixion first
[1:31:46] and look at what that released
[1:31:48] what was what was released on Calvary
[1:31:50] eternal life
[1:31:51] and that bomb of Gilead was released
[1:31:53] from him that soothes all your diseases
[1:31:56] you look at that olive oil it it helps
[1:31:59] everything
[1:32:01] in your human body and the same thing
[1:32:02] with Christ when he was crushed it
[1:32:05] squeezed out that eternal life that's
[1:32:06] going to soothe every
[1:32:08] everything that's going to come and
[1:32:10] infect you no matter what the disease is
[1:32:12] the HARP issue emotional problems
[1:32:14] whatever may be
[1:32:16] that crushing produced Your solution
[1:32:20] okay
[1:32:24] so when we look at it
[1:32:29] as Christ was broken so are we broken
[1:32:33] and
[1:32:35] we may go into these trials hard
[1:32:38] like olives
[1:32:41] but that crushing
[1:32:43] is what's required to get the potential
[1:32:45] out of you and God knows how close those
[1:32:48] two stones have to be
[1:32:50] he knows just enough what those trials
[1:32:53] are required he knows how close how
[1:32:55] close to the line he can get
[1:32:58] to squeeze the most potential out of you
[1:33:00] without making you bitter
[1:33:02] okay
[1:33:03] and he knows how far he can go without
[1:33:06] crushing you without without giving you
[1:33:08] you know
[1:33:10] things that's going to kill you
[1:33:12] because at the moment it feels like it's
[1:33:14] more far more than we can bear
[1:33:17] but God knows how much you can bear
[1:33:19] because he sees the end he sees the
[1:33:21] benefit of it you look at dad you look
[1:33:23] at how dead Crush Mom and Dad them
[1:33:26] coming into the message and stuff you
[1:33:27] look at the the the the ripple effect
[1:33:31] of a decision you look the the the
[1:33:33] effect of of a life being pressed
[1:33:38] and it's
[1:33:40] we won't see how much of an impact Our
[1:33:43] Lives will have on other people and
[1:33:44] other things I believe until we get it
[1:33:46] on the other side
[1:33:47] because it's during these processes it's
[1:33:50] during these times of crushing
[1:33:52] that our life is most beneficial
[1:33:54] beneficial to others
[1:33:56] because if the olive is no good to
[1:33:58] anyone it can't even be eaten
[1:34:01] until
[1:34:02] it allows the farmer to put it through
[1:34:05] that crushing process
[1:34:07] so same thing with our lives like we we
[1:34:09] can't hold on to that gift that precious
[1:34:11] gift within us
[1:34:12] and let no one else partake of it
[1:34:16] if we want to be any used to the body or
[1:34:18] the kingdom of God we have
[1:34:20] to yield ourselves to that crushing
[1:34:23] we have to trust the one
[1:34:25] who allows the crushing
[1:34:29] and it's hard
[1:34:30] it's hard
[1:34:32] you know he puts you through situations
[1:34:33] where you feel like
[1:34:35] Christ on the cross like why have you
[1:34:37] forsaken me
[1:34:39] this hurts
[1:34:41] or you're allowing it
[1:34:43] so we can rest assured
[1:34:47] that the trial will not destroy but will
[1:34:49] unleash the potential locked inside of
[1:34:51] you
[1:34:52] we see here in second Corinthians
[1:34:56] but we have this treasure in Earthen
[1:34:57] vessels that the Excellency of the power
[1:34:59] may be of God and not of us
[1:35:01] we are troubled on every side yet not
[1:35:03] distressed
[1:35:04] we are perplexed but not in despair
[1:35:06] persecuted but not forsaken cast down
[1:35:08] but not destroyed
[1:35:10] always bearing about in the body of the
[1:35:11] dying of the Lord Jesus that the life
[1:35:13] also of Jesus might be manifest in our
[1:35:15] body
[1:35:16] for we which live are always deliver
[1:35:17] unto death for Jesus sake that the life
[1:35:19] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[1:35:21] our moral flesh
[1:35:22] so then death worketh in US
[1:35:25] but life in you
[1:35:28] so if you go back to David
[1:35:30] he's in the cave of adulam and we see
[1:35:33] here
[1:35:34] in verse one and when his brother-in-law
[1:35:36] is his father's house heard it they went
[1:35:37] down thither to him and everyone that
[1:35:40] was in distress or stress Under Pressure
[1:35:42] suffering hardship and everyone that was
[1:35:44] in debt and everyone that was
[1:35:46] discontented to be in bitterness of soul
[1:35:48] to have been wrong and mistreated
[1:35:49] gathered themselves unto him
[1:35:51] and he became a captain over them and
[1:35:53] they were with them about 400 men
[1:35:56] so after God breaks David
[1:36:00] he now can start using David
[1:36:03] and what he does he give David a purpose
[1:36:05] and he sends these men to him criminals
[1:36:08] and the off-scaring and the cast offs
[1:36:13] people that Society didn't want that
[1:36:15] Society abused
[1:36:18] and what's amazing here is that David
[1:36:19] now is
[1:36:22] you know partially learned his lesson he
[1:36:24] still makes mistakes but he starts
[1:36:27] training these men
[1:36:28] and these these off-scaring eventually
[1:36:31] turn into the money man of David
[1:36:33] these 400 men and they follow him
[1:36:35] throughout his entire life and they're
[1:36:37] renowned for their
[1:36:39] what they do they you know they're giant
[1:36:40] Slayers and they they do these marvelous
[1:36:43] you know
[1:36:45] uh battles and all these things and and
[1:36:48] from here David
[1:36:51] has a purpose and he's
[1:36:53] now in a position where he's now being
[1:36:56] able to help other people through his
[1:36:57] experience
[1:36:58] and when you get
[1:37:02] to that point you know
[1:37:04] you know Christ you know he has the off
[1:37:07] scarring
[1:37:08] he chooses the the the low lives of
[1:37:10] society
[1:37:12] and he turns into into giant slayers
[1:37:15] none of us in our flesh are capable of
[1:37:18] any good but is only through the power
[1:37:19] of the Holy Ghost
[1:37:21] that that potential
[1:37:22] is Unleashed for us to be giant slayers
[1:37:25] so if you go to Psalm 34 Psalm 34 was
[1:37:27] actually written around the same time as
[1:37:28] this as uh 142 when he's in the cave of
[1:37:32] a doom
[1:37:33] so if we go to Psalm 34 it says I will
[1:37:35] bless the Lord at all times his praise
[1:37:37] shall continually be on my mouth my soul
[1:37:39] shall maker boast in the Lord The Humble
[1:37:40] shall hear the rough and be glad
[1:37:42] o magnified the Lord with me and let us
[1:37:45] exalt his name together
[1:37:46] I sought the Lord and he heard me and
[1:37:48] delivered me from all my fears they
[1:37:51] looked unto him and were lightened and
[1:37:52] their faces were not ashamed this poor
[1:37:53] man cried and Lord heard him and saved
[1:37:56] him out of his troubles
[1:37:57] the angel of the Lord in campus around
[1:37:59] about them that fear Him and delivereth
[1:38:00] them
[1:38:03] you know and the righteous cry and the
[1:38:06] Lord heareth and delivereth him out of
[1:38:07] their troubles the Lord is nigh unto
[1:38:10] them of a broken heart and saves such as
[1:38:11] be of a contrite spirit many are the
[1:38:14] afflictions of the righteous but the
[1:38:15] Lord delivereth them out of them all he
[1:38:17] keepeth all his bones not one of them is
[1:38:19] broken evil shall slay the wicked and
[1:38:21] they that hate the righteous shall be
[1:38:22] desolate the Lord redeemeth his soul of
[1:38:24] his servants and none of them that trust
[1:38:26] in him shall be desolate
[1:38:28] so we look at the contrast here
[1:38:31] you go from I am there was no man to
[1:38:34] help me
[1:38:35] I am completely alone to magnify the
[1:38:38] Lord with me let us exalt his name
[1:38:40] together
[1:38:41] many are the afflictions of the
[1:38:42] righteous but the Lord delivereth him
[1:38:44] from all that that is a man who has
[1:38:46] learned
[1:38:47] that through the crushing through the
[1:38:49] breaking
[1:38:50] that there's joy comes in the morning
[1:38:53] he's learned that there is a there's
[1:38:56] Grace at the end of the trial there's
[1:38:58] joy at the end of the trial there's
[1:39:00] strength at the end of the trial
[1:39:03] there's trust a greater Trust
[1:39:06] in his God and master at the end of the
[1:39:08] trial
[1:39:10] okay and the pain is never wasted God
[1:39:12] never wastes her pain
[1:39:15] when he puts these through these
[1:39:16] situations where
[1:39:18] you know we feel alone and we feel
[1:39:20] abandoned once he's done with you you'll
[1:39:22] always see the good in it
[1:39:24] and over time the pain fades
[1:39:27] but the joy of it increases and you go
[1:39:29] through it again because you would see
[1:39:32] what comes out of it the end final
[1:39:34] product is always worth the trial
[1:39:38] no matter what
[1:39:42] so
[1:39:43] just clue up here
[1:39:46] being broken is
[1:39:49] you know it's it's hard but God has a
[1:39:52] purpose in it
[1:39:55] and he's unleashing the potential that
[1:39:56] he's locked inside you and these trials
[1:39:58] that come
[1:40:00] they seem random they seem out of the
[1:40:01] blue but there's always a purpose in it
[1:40:04] and what God is trying to get us to do
[1:40:06] is to be to be silent within the storm
[1:40:10] that despite you know how everything has
[1:40:12] fallen apart that we don't try and fix
[1:40:14] it what he's trying to do is for us to
[1:40:16] go to him immediately
[1:40:18] go to him in prayer seek his faith seek
[1:40:21] his counsel and you see what David you
[1:40:24] know he's not perfect but neither are we
[1:40:25] after this you see him he's going he's
[1:40:27] going to God
[1:40:29] he's going to God when something else
[1:40:31] goes to God if he makes sake goes back
[1:40:32] to God it's just he there's a it's kind
[1:40:36] of like the the Shepherd that breaks the
[1:40:38] leg of the Lamb that lamb sticks close
[1:40:40] to that Shepherd because it it wants its
[1:40:44] protection
[1:40:45] and same thing with David is that he's
[1:40:47] learned he's tasted what it's like to be
[1:40:48] out on your own and it's not nice
[1:40:52] and he's learned that like there's a
[1:40:54] safety and there's a comfort
[1:40:56] in saying next to the master
[1:40:58] and same thing with us that like
[1:41:01] once you've learned a couple times that
[1:41:04] it's better to
[1:41:06] to go to him it's better to cling to him
[1:41:09] than to try to survive it on your own
[1:41:10] because it's just you're going to get
[1:41:12] you're going to get smashed and his
[1:41:14] smashing is a whole lot better
[1:41:16] than when you're in permissive will and
[1:41:18] you're getting crushed
[1:41:22] so
[1:41:24] as we clue up here
[1:41:26] and remember those trials are brought up
[1:41:28] upon you
[1:41:29] the same way so that you'll not say well
[1:41:31] maybe this is right maybe the scripture
[1:41:32] is true maybe Divine Healing is right
[1:41:34] maybe the Holy Ghost is right but when
[1:41:36] you get that experience and come off
[1:41:38] that ass sheep and you get the
[1:41:39] revelation of God by the baptism the
[1:41:41] Holy Ghost you can scream I know my
[1:41:43] redeemeth My Redeemer liveth because he
[1:41:46] lives in me
[1:41:51] now no chastening for the present
[1:41:53] seemeth to be joyous but Grievous
[1:41:56] nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the
[1:41:58] Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto
[1:41:59] them which are exercised by
[1:42:01] whereby lift up the hands which hang
[1:42:03] down and the feeble knees and make
[1:42:06] straight paths for your feet less that
[1:42:07] which is lame be turned out of the way
[1:42:09] but let it rather be healed
[1:42:13] and as we stand
[1:42:17] one of my favorite
[1:42:21] scriptures of all time
[1:42:25] there is no King saved by the multitude
[1:42:27] of a host a mighty man is not delivered
[1:42:29] by much strength
[1:42:30] a horse is a vain thing for safety
[1:42:33] neither shall he deliver anybody's great
[1:42:35] strength
[1:42:36] behold the eye the Lord is upon them
[1:42:38] that fear Him upon them that hope and
[1:42:39] his Mercy to deliver their soul from
[1:42:42] death and to keep them alive and famine
[1:42:44] our soul waited for the Lord he is our
[1:42:46] help and our Shield
[1:42:48] for our hope our heart shall rejoice in
[1:42:50] him because we have trust in His holy
[1:42:52] name
[1:42:53] let thy mercy O Lord be upon us
[1:42:55] according as we hope in thee
[1:42:59] so at the end of the day you know it's
[1:43:02] you know he his ultimate intention is
[1:43:04] for us to go from glory to glory
[1:43:08] and you know as David learned so we
[1:43:11] learn
[1:43:12] that there's Grace for mistakes
[1:43:15] there's Grace To Learn
[1:43:17] but it takes time character is a very is
[1:43:19] a line upon line gift the longest
[1:43:22] lasting growth comes slow
[1:43:25] it's slow because anything that comes
[1:43:28] fast
[1:43:29] goes fast
[1:43:30] weeds come up quick and they go quick
[1:43:33] whereas an oak tree it takes years it
[1:43:36] takes the right conditions the right
[1:43:37] food
[1:43:39] it requires sunlight
[1:43:42] and takes time for it to grow but once
[1:43:44] once it's once it's mature
[1:43:48] it can withstand
[1:43:50] any wind
[1:43:52] it provides shelter for all the animals
[1:43:54] it's fruit feeds the animals and it's a
[1:43:58] blessing to everyone around it
[1:44:01] but it requires time and it requires
[1:44:03] patience
[1:44:05] and the same thing with us when in the
[1:44:07] spiritual walk
[1:44:08] our strength will not come
[1:44:10] out of the blue
[1:44:12] what requires these valleys these
[1:44:14] valleys are the shadow of death in order
[1:44:16] to to release that strength to release
[1:44:18] that that potential that he's locked up
[1:44:21] inside of you
[1:44:22] and the key is that look to him
[1:44:26] as the only way that Peter stayed up on
[1:44:29] that water was by looking at him as soon
[1:44:31] as he took his eyes off he he started
[1:44:34] to fall into that water
[1:44:36] so keep your eyes on him
[1:44:37] and we keep you in perfect peace
[1:44:42] so let's pray
[1:44:45] dear Jesus we just thank you for
[1:44:48] all that you've done for us Lord
[1:44:50] for this work of Grace floors it's an
[1:44:52] unmerited gift
[1:44:54] we haven't earned it Lord and we will
[1:44:56] never earn it
[1:44:57] but we're asking father Lord me just
[1:44:59] help us to yield our vessels to you
[1:45:02] and not to question your purpose Florida
[1:45:04] and your plans
[1:45:05] and to be able to know that
[1:45:08] if we stick Close to You Lord that
[1:45:10] you'll lead us through
[1:45:12] and that the trial will be worth it at
[1:45:13] the end
[1:45:15] help us Lord not to lose hope
[1:45:18] to not look at ourselves Lord and not
[1:45:19] look at the circumstances father
[1:45:21] but to trust that you have a greater
[1:45:23] purpose in mind
[1:45:25] and help us Lord just to
[1:45:27] to never look away
[1:45:30] so we love you so much Lord Of Me
