[15:50] uh My Redeemer is faithful and true.
[15:52] 11:34 up there. And as brother Mark to
[15:55] open uh in prayer as we uh begin the
[15:59] weekend of services and we're thankful
[16:01] to have brother Aaron here, of course,
[16:03] and sister Lydia, God bless you. Uh all
[16:07] the visitors, good to have brother Joel,
[16:09] Sister Priscilla back and family.
[16:13] That's good. We're we're back. We're
[16:16] back. So, praise the Lord. Trust you
[16:19] come expecting tonight. So, let's just
[16:21] remember to pray for brother Aaron as he
[16:22] brings the word of the Lord. Remember,
[16:23] brother Chad as well. You've uh uh I
[16:27] guess everybody's made aware of the uh
[16:30] of his condition. So, we're thankful
[16:32] that he's got the stance in and he's
[16:34] resting
[16:36] and uh we just continue to pray for him.
[16:40] uh and also uh brothers Dale and uh Mary
[16:46] Russo. We just continue to pray for that
[16:48] need tonight. Remember brother Nelson
[16:50] and all the saints around the island and
[16:52] around the world. Also, sister Jamie
[16:54] sent me a request for um prayer for her
[16:57] father, Brother Tom. He was having uh
[17:01] some tests for a heart issue as well and
[17:05] uh also for her mother who was having
[17:08] some kind of test as well that uh
[17:11] they're trying to figure out there's
[17:13] something wrong. So there's both of them
[17:15] and brother David's friend Junior Dove
[17:18] who has been diagnosed with cancer.
[17:22] So uh also I've been asked to bring
[17:24] greetings uh from the maco to everybody
[17:29] uh from brother Allen and sister Mercy.
[17:32] So I want to uh remember them in prayer
[17:34] as well. Brother Ron and sister Shirley
[17:36] called today and brother Ron has uh
[17:39] gotten a good report from the doctor uh
[17:43] and uh he might have to do a little bit
[17:44] of treatment but it's just
[17:45] precautionary.
[17:47] And um just something else I thought
[17:50] might be an encouragement to everybody.
[17:53] Um forgive the use of my phone. Um but
[17:58] um
[18:00] I'm talking to brother Dale
[18:02] and which I do normally but uh and he he
[18:07] has stopped taking uh the painkillers
[18:11] and he was under a lot of pain and so he
[18:13] stopped taking them about two or three
[18:15] weeks ago and he said he's he's just
[18:19] declaring himself healed. He said God
[18:21] heal me. No more negative thoughts. He
[18:23] said, he said, "I'm just uh I'm just
[18:27] believing." So, last night we got a text
[18:30] from uh one of his daughters,
[18:33] and I just thought I'd read it because
[18:34] it's an it'll encourage faith, I'm sure.
[18:38] And she's referring to her dad. She
[18:39] said, "Wow, praise the Lord. God sure
[18:41] did a miracle in my dad's life. He is
[18:43] feeling so good now." Not sure what the
[18:46] doctor would say, but that doesn't
[18:47] matter anyway. It's God's word that
[18:49] matters. And he says that by his
[18:51] stripes, we're healed. So, he's claiming
[18:53] his healing and he says whatever pains
[18:55] he has is just lying vanities. He's back
[18:58] at church. He's driving himself because
[19:01] he wasn't for a while. He looks better
[19:04] and he sounds even better. So, praise
[19:07] the Lord.
[19:09] He uh and that's the way if you call
[19:12] him, that's the that's the response you
[19:14] get, you know. So, it's uh I just
[19:17] thought I'd pass that on because he
[19:18] wanted he wanted me to pass on his love
[19:20] for this uh for the assembly here. He
[19:22] said everybody has been so wonderful to
[19:24] him and he appreciates the prayers. So
[19:27] we'll keep him in prayer and um
[19:31] he did say to the doctor I'm healed and
[19:33] the doctor said I need to see you. So uh
[19:37] he'll come back with that testimony.
[19:39] Praise the Lord. So let's just sing
[19:40] this. My redeemer is faithful and true.
[19:43] And brother Mark lead us in prayer.
[19:49] My redeemer
[19:52] is faithful
[19:54] and true.
[19:58] Everything here I say he will lose.
[20:05] Every morning
[20:08] in mercies I live.

[20:15] is faithful and true.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; Yes,

[20:25] and true.
[20:28] Everything he has said he will do.

[42:14] So when the enemy
[42:18] tries to come for me,
[42:21] I will not fear because you prayed for
[42:26] me.

[42:34] in you,
[42:36] Jesus.

[43:22] are my anchor, Lord Jesus.

[43:30] So when the enmy
[43:34] tries to lie to me, I will believe the
[43:39] truth you've given me.

[43:49] in you,
[43:51] Jesus.
[43:54] Jesus,

[44:01] in you,
[44:03] Jesus.
[44:09] And I am sure
[44:12] that you'll never leave me.
[44:15] You'll never forsake me. No, no, no.
[44:22] I find my peace
[44:26] in you,

[54:50] Amen. We can never praise him enough.
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. for all that he's done, for all
[54:54] that he's promised, for all that he's
[54:57] going to do. Amen. It's wonderful to be
[54:59] here tonight. Wonderful to be in his
[55:01] presence. Amen. It's wonderful to have
[55:03] brother Aaron and Sister Lydia finally
[55:06] make it down up, I guess, to see us.
[55:09] Amen. As they were in Toronto and
[55:11] boarding their flight, and my wife said
[55:13] to me, she said, "It's going to happen.
[55:15] It's really going to happen." So, we're
[55:17] so happy to have them here. Brother
[55:18] Aaron, his wife, Sister Lydia, what's
[55:21] left of her at least. Amen. So, it's
[55:23] it's wonderful to have them here and
[55:25] we're just looking forward to a good
[55:27] time in the Lord. You know, when I was
[55:28] sitting in the seat there and I was
[55:29] watching the screens play and it said it
[55:32] was out of Luke and it said, "The things
[55:33] which are impossible with man are
[55:36] possible with God." And you know when I
[55:39] read that I remember when you were here
[55:40] last that's where you ended preaching as
[55:43] he spoke on that and it was remember the
[55:44] rich young ruler and Jesus said how hard
[55:47] it is for a rich man to go into the
[55:48] kingdom of heaven. They said who can
[55:50] surely enter? He said with things that
[55:52] are impossible with man are possible
[55:54] with God. And the next chapter was
[55:56] Zakchius. And he was showing with God
[55:58] all things are possible. Amen. So I want
[56:00] you to take your need. I want you to
[56:01] take your situation tonight and you say,
[56:04] "Lord, what's impossible with me? What's
[56:06] impossible with my way, my thinking, my
[56:08] trying, my discipline, my failures, my
[56:11] faults. Lord, I give it to you tonight,
[56:14] &gt;&gt; this weekend. I give it to you, Lord,
[56:16] that you could do the impossible in my
[56:18] life." Amen. And we're going to sing
[56:20] that song. More of you, more of you.
[56:22] I've had it all. But what I want is more
[56:25] of you as we invite Brother Aaron to
[56:26] come take his liberty tonight. We
[56:28] certainly want to remember Brother Chad
[56:30] and Sister Leah tonight. Just thankful
[56:33] the Lord spared him. Amen. They were
[56:35] able to go in and catch some things that
[56:37] were going on in his heart. He had 100%
[56:38] blockage in one, 70% in two areas, and
[56:41] 40% in another. So, they put the two
[56:44] stints in. He's resting well, eager to
[56:46] get home, eager to get to church. Amen.
[56:49] And so we're just trusting the Lord to
[56:50] be with them. Bless them over this
[56:52] weekend. But as we turn this over and we
[56:54] change the order of the service, let's
[56:56] just put out a a request to him and say,
[56:58] "Lord, I want more of you tonight. I
[57:00] want more of you this weekend." You say,
[57:02] "I've had a lot.
[57:05] You can never have too much until we're
[57:06] out of there. Till we're out of here."
[57:08] Amen. We don't have enough. So I say,
[57:10] "Lord, fill my cup tonight. Raise me to
[57:12] a higher level. Raise my faith to a
[57:14] higher level. Raise my expectation to a
[57:17] higher level. Amen. You have not because
[57:19] you ask not. Amen. Let's go in asking
[57:22] big things of God. Say, "Lord, move in
[57:23] my life. Meet the needs that I have.
[57:25] Lead me. Guide me. Provide for my need
[57:28] tonight." Amen. And then when he brings
[57:30] it, let's say, "Lord, help me to
[57:33] recognize you fulfilling that need."
[57:34] Amen. Amen. Let's sing this as we turn
[57:37] it over tonight.
[57:40] Oh, more of you.
[57:44] [Music]
[57:47] more of you.
[57:53] I've had it all
[57:57] of what I need is more of you.
[58:06] of things. I've had my fill,
[58:12] but yet I hunger
[58:17] still.
[58:19] Oh, empty and bare.
[58:23] Lord, hear my prayer for more of you.
[58:32] I need more of you.
[58:37] [Music]
[58:49] Glory.
[59:12] [Laughter]
[59:14] [Music]
[59:24] Is that your desire this weekend? More
[59:27] of him.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; And I believe that's where we should all
[59:29] find ourselves tonight is in a place
[59:32] saying, "Lord, thank you for all you've
[59:34] done for me. I recognize everything
[59:37] you've done, but Lord, I need more
[59:39] tonight." Amen. Let's just make that a
[59:42] matter of prayer as we start this
[59:43] service by by speaking to him right now.
[59:46] Father Lord, we are just so grateful for
[59:48] this opportunity, Lord. So grateful,
[59:51] Lord, that we have promises that you
[59:52] gave us that where two or three gather,
[59:54] you would be in our midst, Lord. So, so
[59:56] tonight, Lord, as thankful as we are to
[59:58] be here and to see one another, Lord,
[1:00:00] your people, Lord, it thrills our heart.
[1:00:02] What makes us the happiest tonight,
[1:00:03] Lord, is knowing that you said you were
[1:00:05] here, Lord. So, we're grateful for that.
[1:00:07] We're thankful for that. We ask, Lord,
[1:00:09] that you would take control of the
[1:00:10] service, Lord, that you would speak,
[1:00:12] that you would move me out of the way,
[1:00:13] Lord. I'm Lord completely aware of my
[1:00:16] inability Lord, but I'm also aware Lord
[1:00:19] that if you'll come and take over and
[1:00:21] that you'll anoint and you'll speak then
[1:00:23] things of eternal value can take place
[1:00:25] Lord. That's our desire Lord. So we step
[1:00:27] aside now. We look to your word and we
[1:00:29] ask that you'll bless it. Lord bless
[1:00:31] each one of your people, your bride
[1:00:33] around the world, Lord. I just pray that
[1:00:34] you'll be with them, Father, in Jesus
[1:00:36] name. Amen and amen. Thank you very
[1:00:40] much. God bless you tonight. It is uh
[1:00:44] such an honor to finally be here. Uh you
[1:00:47] know uh we were supposed to be here in
[1:00:50] August at the family camp and then the
[1:00:53] wildfires had that moved here to the
[1:00:55] church and then Air Canada went on
[1:00:57] strike and we couldn't make it. Then we
[1:00:59] were supposed to come in October and we
[1:01:01] had kidney stones and we're finally here
[1:01:04] and we we are extremely excited to be
[1:01:07] here. I I can't tell you how much that
[1:01:09] we appreciate you and love you with the
[1:01:11] love of the Lord. Y'all have really
[1:01:13] become a a a part of our lives and you
[1:01:15] have a special place in our heart. U
[1:01:18] brother John has has come to be a real
[1:01:21] true friend of mine and I'm thankful for
[1:01:22] him and his ministry and the work that
[1:01:24] he does here. You're a blessed people.
[1:01:26] Amen. And uh brother Tim wanted me to
[1:01:29] bring his greetings to each one of you
[1:01:31] and and tell you send his love and
[1:01:33] appreciation. And I just want to say how
[1:01:35] thankful I am to be here and thankful to
[1:01:37] have my wife Lydia with me. Uh somebody
[1:01:40] said that she has to go with me to keep
[1:01:41] me in line. And I say, well,
[1:01:45] that's a tough job, but she does she
[1:01:47] does she does good. But God bless you
[1:01:49] tonight. We won't we won't linger any
[1:01:52] more on that, but we'll move right into
[1:01:53] it. I just want to start by saying
[1:01:55] tonight, you know, I believe that we're
[1:01:56] we're a special called out people. Amen.
[1:01:59] and and and I believe that we're called
[1:02:01] to to to more than just coming out.
[1:02:04] Amen. But we're called uh more to more
[1:02:07] than just salvation, but but we've been
[1:02:09] we've been called out to conquer. Amen.
[1:02:12] Not just to barely get by, but you know,
[1:02:14] many times we get saved and things fall
[1:02:16] off our lives and we're happy about that
[1:02:18] as we should be. We should rejoice in
[1:02:21] those things. But but many times what
[1:02:23] happens is we spend the rest of our
[1:02:25] lives right there, delivered, saved, and
[1:02:28] yet not progressing any further. Amen.
[1:02:31] And and I believe that we're to take the
[1:02:33] token and we're to apply it to every
[1:02:36] aspect of our lives. In other words, let
[1:02:39] the power of God work in everything, not
[1:02:42] just cleanse you from sin.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let be um I know that sometimes we
[1:02:47] don't focus on these things and that's
[1:02:48] okay, but we should let the token make
[1:02:50] us a better neighbor. We should let the
[1:02:52] token make you a kinder person and a
[1:02:54] less selfish person and and begin to
[1:02:57] conquer the parts of ourselves that
[1:02:59] often times we chalk up to personality.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; Well, that's just who I am. That's the
[1:03:04] things that's been passed down. But but
[1:03:06] I believe that God wants us to conquer
[1:03:07] in every aspect of our lives. Amen. So,
[1:03:10] so we're going to start tonight looking
[1:03:12] at that thought and and and if I would
[1:03:13] give it a title tonight, I would I would
[1:03:15] say we've been called out to conquer.
[1:03:18] Amen. If you'll open your Bibles with me
[1:03:20] tonight to the book of Numbers 13. We'll
[1:03:22] read there. Numbers 13 and verse 25.
[1:03:27] We're going to read down through verse
[1:03:29] 30.
[1:03:32] Numbers 25.
[1:03:36] Numbers 13, excuse me. Numbers 13:25.
[1:03:39] It says, "And they returned from
[1:03:41] searching of the land after 40 days. And
[1:03:44] they went and came to Moses and to
[1:03:46] Aaron, and to all the congregation of
[1:03:48] the children of Israel, unto the
[1:03:51] wilderness of Pan, to Kadesh, and
[1:03:53] brought back word unto them, and unto
[1:03:54] all the congregation, and showed them
[1:03:57] the fruit of the land. And they told
[1:04:00] him, and said, We came into the land
[1:04:01] whether thou sentest us, and surely it
[1:04:04] flowth with milk and honey, and this is
[1:04:06] the fruit of it.
[1:04:11] Nevertheless, the people be strong that
[1:04:13] dwell in the land, and the cities are
[1:04:15] walled and very great. And moreover, we
[1:04:17] saw the children of Anoch there. The
[1:04:20] Amalachites dwell in the land of the
[1:04:21] south, and the Hittites, and the
[1:04:23] Jebusites, and the Amorites dwell in the
[1:04:25] mountains, and the Canaanites dwell by
[1:04:26] the sea and by the coast of Jordan. And
[1:04:29] Caleb steilled the people before Moses,
[1:04:32] and said, "Let us go up at once and
[1:04:34] possess it, for we are well able to
[1:04:37] overcome it." Amen. And I pray that the
[1:04:39] Lord will add a special blessing to the
[1:04:41] reading of his word. As you have your
[1:04:42] seats tonight,
[1:04:45] you know, we we know the story well of
[1:04:47] of the Exodus out of Egypt, how how that
[1:04:50] God's people were were loosed by the
[1:04:53] power of God there in there in Egypt and
[1:04:55] they they came out under under a mighty
[1:04:58] message, a message that had been brought
[1:05:00] by a prophet. And you know, as we look
[1:05:02] at the Exodus, we see so many
[1:05:03] similarities to to our lives today.
[1:05:06] Amen. that they came out under the
[1:05:08] message of of a prophet and the the
[1:05:10] ministry of that prophet was accompanied
[1:05:12] by signs and it was accompanied by
[1:05:14] wonders and and and they were
[1:05:16] vindicating that God was with him. Amen.
[1:05:20] the signs and wonders vindicated that
[1:05:22] what he told them was the truth. And and
[1:05:25] we know that they journeyed. And the
[1:05:27] Bible tells us that the Lord went before
[1:05:29] them by day in a pillar of cloud and and
[1:05:32] by night in a in a pillar of fire and
[1:05:34] and along the way the Red Sea was opened
[1:05:36] and mana rains down from heaven and
[1:05:39] bitter waters are made sweet and water
[1:05:41] comes from the rock and and the point of
[1:05:43] all this is saying that there was no
[1:05:45] denying that God was with them in their
[1:05:48] journey. Amen. that they were moving
[1:05:50] underneath a mighty message and and of
[1:05:52] course along the way there had been
[1:05:54] trials and there had been hardships and
[1:05:56] God had delivered and sustained them in
[1:05:59] each and every one that they faced and
[1:06:02] and even after they made the golden calf
[1:06:04] and and God was angered, we still see
[1:06:07] him in Exodus 34 come and renew his
[1:06:10] promise and his covenant with them
[1:06:13] again. It says here and he said,
[1:06:15] "Behold, I make a covenant." This is
[1:06:17] right after the the incident with the
[1:06:19] golden calf. And he says, "Before all
[1:06:21] thy people, I will do will do marvels
[1:06:24] such as have not been done in all the
[1:06:26] earth, nor in any nation, and all the
[1:06:28] people among which thou art shall see
[1:06:30] the work of the Lord. For it is a
[1:06:32] terrible thing that will that I will do
[1:06:36] with thee. Observe thou that which I
[1:06:38] command thee this day. Behold, I drive
[1:06:41] out before thee the Amorite and the
[1:06:43] Canaanite and the Hittite and the
[1:06:45] Perizzite and the Hivite and the
[1:06:48] Jebusite. So despite their failures, God
[1:06:51] was truth. Amen. I mean, he had
[1:06:53] delivered and he had walked and he had
[1:06:55] opened the Red Sea and he had reigned
[1:06:57] man and he did all these things and yet
[1:06:59] they failed him time after time. And yet
[1:07:01] in their failures, God remained true.
[1:07:05] Amen. And and God would deliver them
[1:07:07] time after time. And you know, I think
[1:07:09] tonight if we would sit here and and
[1:07:12] begin listing all the times that God had
[1:07:14] moved on our behalf and we began listing
[1:07:16] and looking back down through our life
[1:07:18] where he he delivered me here and and he
[1:07:21] healed me here and he he provided here
[1:07:24] and time after time he has confirmed his
[1:07:27] promise to us just like he did to
[1:07:29] Israel. Despite our failures, despite
[1:07:32] where we fell and where we let down the
[1:07:34] bar and where we didn't do the things we
[1:07:36] knew to do, God has come time after time
[1:07:38] and confirmed you are my people. I have
[1:07:41] called you. I have chosen you and I'm
[1:07:43] not going to abandon you on this journey
[1:07:45] because it it's not I haven't called you
[1:07:48] out to leave you in the wilderness. I
[1:07:50] haven't called you out in order for you
[1:07:51] to fail, but I've called you out that
[1:07:53] you might take the land. Amen. I believe
[1:07:56] we can all testify tonight that God has
[1:08:00] never left us. God has never failed us.
[1:08:03] And if we could truly get that on the
[1:08:05] inside of us. If you could really let
[1:08:08] that anchor down tonight in our hearts,
[1:08:09] I believe we could walk out tonight in
[1:08:11] in perfect faith realizing that
[1:08:14] everything's going to be all right. He's
[1:08:16] never failed before and he's not going
[1:08:17] to start failing now. He hasn't
[1:08:19] abandoned me before and he's not going
[1:08:21] to abandon me now. Whatever I'm facing,
[1:08:24] he's going to see me all the way through
[1:08:26] to the end. Amen. Whatever you're facing
[1:08:29] tonight, you don't have to back off. You
[1:08:31] don't have to be afraid because you're
[1:08:33] not facing it alone. He said, "I go
[1:08:35] before you to drive out the enemy. I go
[1:08:38] before you." Listen, he didn't send them
[1:08:40] into the wilderness on their own. He
[1:08:42] didn't send you into the trial you're in
[1:08:44] tonight on your own, but he said, "I'm
[1:08:46] going with you. I'm going before you.
[1:08:48] I'm driving out the enemy that you might
[1:08:50] conquer." Amen. You don't have to fear
[1:08:53] tonight. You don't have to back off
[1:08:55] tonight. The devil's telling you, "Well,
[1:08:57] you're not going to make it out of this
[1:08:58] one." And and you're going to fall to
[1:09:00] this. Listen, he's been telling you some
[1:09:02] of that, some of y'all that for the last
[1:09:04] 10 years. He's been telling people that
[1:09:06] for the last 20 years, but I'd like to
[1:09:08] acknowledge tonight. We're still here.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; We're still standing. And we're still
[1:09:13] fighting regardless that the devil said,
[1:09:14] "You're going to quit. You're going to
[1:09:16] fail. You're not going to make it." I
[1:09:18] look around and say, despite all that,
[1:09:20] despite the most evil age, despite every
[1:09:23] attack, there's still a bride standing
[1:09:25] tonight. You're not here on your own.
[1:09:27] You're here because you're called to it.
[1:09:29] You're not here on your own, but you're
[1:09:31] standing tonight because he has gone
[1:09:33] before you and he's given you the
[1:09:35] strength to stand.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; We're still here. Amen.
[1:09:40] the children of Israel under the message
[1:09:42] of the hour, under the leading of the
[1:09:45] pillar of fire and with the testimony of
[1:09:47] of all those victories,
[1:09:50] they come and they arrive at Kadesh
[1:09:53] and it's a decision time.
[1:09:56] It's a turning point and and we know
[1:09:58] here at Kadesh, if if you know the
[1:10:00] story,
[1:10:02] they failed to cross over. They failed
[1:10:05] to go in and take the land and to
[1:10:06] conquer all that God had given them. But
[1:10:09] but I want to look at us tonight on our
[1:10:11] journey. A as we journey
[1:10:13] we face many cadishes.
[1:10:16] Many times we have to make a decision.
[1:10:20] Do we trust God and press into the land
[1:10:23] or do we allow circumstances to derail
[1:10:25] us?
[1:10:27] And really if we think about it, we we
[1:10:29] face it every single day as we war with
[1:10:32] this flesh.
[1:10:34] Decision time. Every single day. Are you
[1:10:37] going to conquer today? Are you going to
[1:10:41] overcome today? Are you going to rise
[1:10:43] above the challenge today? And as we go
[1:10:47] forward in in this thought, I want you
[1:10:48] to make it personal because it's not
[1:10:50] it's not a group thing tonight. It's a
[1:10:51] you thing. It it's a me thing. Amen. You
[1:10:55] Caleb showed that with his testimony.
[1:10:57] The whole congregation rises up and
[1:10:59] they're like, "We can't do it. We're
[1:11:01] going back to Egypt." But Caleb showed
[1:11:02] us it's an individual thing. Look, you
[1:11:04] can all go back. You can all turn and go
[1:11:07] back, but I have a promise. I have a
[1:11:09] word. I'm going to take my mountain. It
[1:11:12] doesn't matter what everybody else does.
[1:11:14] It's a you thing tonight. Are you going
[1:11:17] to possess the promise? Are you going to
[1:11:19] stand true? Are you going to overcome in
[1:11:21] the hour of decision? Amen. Caleb said,
[1:11:24] "I'm here to win. I'm here to possess it
[1:11:26] all. You can all go back." Listen,
[1:11:29] church, we haven't been called out to go
[1:11:31] back. We haven't been called out to stop
[1:11:34] short. Reuben and Gad, they journeyed
[1:11:37] all the way right up to Jordan and they
[1:11:39] weren't willing to cross over. But there
[1:11:41] was somebody that said, "I'm gonna have
[1:11:43] my mountain." Amen.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:47] You're a people that's been called out
[1:11:49] to take the land in this day. Called out
[1:11:52] to take a rapture. Not just to have
[1:11:55] correct doctrine, although we're
[1:11:56] thankful for correct doctrine.
[1:11:59] Not just to have signs and wonders,
[1:12:01] although we're thankful for those
[1:12:02] things. God promised a rapture.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; These things aren't just pipe dreams.
[1:12:07] These things aren't just fairy tales.
[1:12:10] I'm not stopping short. I'm not settling
[1:12:12] for good life, although I'm thankful for
[1:12:14] a good life. I'm not settling for a good
[1:12:16] home, although I'm thankful for a good
[1:12:18] home. I believe every promise in the
[1:12:20] book is a true and living promise. There
[1:12:23] will be a body change. There will be a
[1:12:25] rapture. And I'm not going to settle
[1:12:27] down short of those things, but I'm
[1:12:29] going to press towards the mark of the
[1:12:31] high calling. Amen. Press for all of it.
[1:12:35] Because we're called to do more than
[1:12:37] just come out.
[1:12:40] We're not called to be a stagnant
[1:12:42] people. People who have remained in the
[1:12:44] same place, in the same condition year
[1:12:48] after year, and yet satisfied we've been
[1:12:51] called out,
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; satisfied that we've come out under a
[1:12:56] message, satisfied that we're walking
[1:12:59] under the pillar of fire. So were they.
[1:13:01] And yet there are many of them, most of
[1:13:03] them were told that they weren't going
[1:13:05] to see the promised land.
[1:13:07] We can't be satisfied that we we've come
[1:13:09] out. But we got to be a people and say,
[1:13:11] "Why have we been called out? Why have
[1:13:14] we been pulled out?" Not pulled out to
[1:13:16] wonder in the wilderness. Not pulled out
[1:13:19] to die out there questioning God and
[1:13:21] doubting God. But we've been called out
[1:13:23] in this day as a testimony to show
[1:13:26] there's a living God. There's somebody
[1:13:27] that'll overcome the age, that'll make
[1:13:29] it through the wilderness, that'll go
[1:13:31] into the promised land, that'll receive
[1:13:33] a body change in this day.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:38] People going forward, people progressing
[1:13:42] in every aspect of our lives. Amen. And
[1:13:46] yet, we have to get it out of our heads
[1:13:48] that it's going to be easy.
[1:13:51] It isn't going to be easy.
[1:13:53] Never has been easy. is something that
[1:13:56] you are going to have to be willing to
[1:13:58] fight for.
[1:14:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, as I read through the
[1:14:02] scriptures and I think about how many
[1:14:04] times the word tells us exactly what's
[1:14:08] going to happen. It tells us exactly how
[1:14:11] it's going to be and then we act shocked
[1:14:14] when it turns out exactly the way the
[1:14:16] word said it was going to turn out.
[1:14:19] You know, the the the the word describes
[1:14:21] the end time perfectly, nation against
[1:14:23] nation, and you know, men lovers of them
[1:14:26] pleasures over lover of God,
[1:14:27] disobedient, disrespectful. And yet,
[1:14:30] every time we see something like that,
[1:14:31] we run around like, can you believe how
[1:14:33] bad it is?
[1:14:35] Yeah, it told us it was going to be.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Matter of fact, I'd be shocked if it
[1:14:39] wasn't. I'd say, "We must not be in the
[1:14:41] end time." Because when you read the
[1:14:43] word and it describes the end time and
[1:14:45] you look and you see it exactly how it's
[1:14:47] described, it helps you place things and
[1:14:49] recognize, yes, this is where we're
[1:14:52] standing. Amen. The word prepares us for
[1:14:56] it. But many times we act shocked. And
[1:14:58] if we go back to Genesis 15, when God
[1:15:01] begins to talk to Abraham about the
[1:15:03] land, and at this point in Genesis 15,
[1:15:06] he's already said to Abraham in Genesis
[1:15:08] 12 and also in Genesis 13 that that the
[1:15:11] land was given to him and his seed. And
[1:15:14] once again, we come to Genesis 15:18.
[1:15:18] And it says, ' In the same day, the Lord
[1:15:19] made a covenant with Abram, saying, unto
[1:15:22] thy seed have I given this land from the
[1:15:24] river of Egypt, unto the great river,
[1:15:26] the river Euphrates, the Kennites, and
[1:15:29] the Kennesites, and the Cadminites, and
[1:15:31] the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and
[1:15:32] the Refims, and the Amorites, and the
[1:15:34] Canaanites, and the Gegosites, and the
[1:15:36] Jebusites.
[1:15:38] Now, notice what he tells Abram. He
[1:15:41] tells them, "Who is currently dwelling
[1:15:45] in the land?
[1:15:47] who who's currently dwelling there and
[1:15:49] who will have to be dispossessed of the
[1:15:52] land in order for him to possess the
[1:15:55] land.
[1:15:56] Amen. And now look as he talks to Moses
[1:15:59] and then he tells him about the land.
[1:16:00] We're moving forward to Exodus, same
[1:16:03] land. And once again he tells them, "And
[1:16:05] I have come down to deliver them out of
[1:16:07] the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring
[1:16:09] them out of that land, unto a good land
[1:16:11] in a large, unto a land flowing with
[1:16:13] milk and honey, unto the place of the
[1:16:16] Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites,
[1:16:19] the Parizzites, and the Hivites, and the
[1:16:23] Jebusites." Once again, he tells Moses
[1:16:26] who is currently in the land and who
[1:16:29] would have to be dispossessed of the
[1:16:31] land in order for Israel to claim their
[1:16:34] promise. Amen. And so the spies are sent
[1:16:36] over and and we know the story how they
[1:16:38] spend 40 days in the land spying out the
[1:16:41] land and and they come back to give
[1:16:43] their report and if you look at their
[1:16:45] testimony, it lines up exactly with the
[1:16:48] message that had been given to them. Oh,
[1:16:51] the fruits are there exactly like you
[1:16:53] said. And and we brought some back. Look
[1:16:54] at the grapes and the pomegranates. It's
[1:16:57] exactly like the word said it would be.
[1:16:59] And the milk and honey is there exactly
[1:17:02] how the word said it would be. And wait
[1:17:05] for it.
[1:17:07] We can't take it because those people
[1:17:09] that you said were going to be there,
[1:17:11] they're there
[1:17:13] just like you said it was going to be.
[1:17:18] Well, if they believed all that exactly
[1:17:20] how it said, then what about the part
[1:17:21] where he said, "But I go before you to
[1:17:25] drive out the Canaanites and drive out
[1:17:27] the Amorites and the Perizzites and the
[1:17:29] Jebusites." Suddenly, in the middle of
[1:17:31] circumstance,
[1:17:33] in the middle of circumstance, they
[1:17:35] forgot about the rest of the promise. We
[1:17:38] look at it and says, "Many are the
[1:17:39] afflictions of the righteous." But don't
[1:17:41] stop right there. Don't forget the rest
[1:17:43] of the promise. But the Lord delivers
[1:17:46] them out of them all. Yes, they were
[1:17:49] there. Yes, the enemy was there. Yes,
[1:17:51] the circumstances were bad. But he'd
[1:17:53] already told them that's how it was
[1:17:54] going to be. And he said, "Don't worry.
[1:17:56] I'm going before you to drive out your
[1:17:59] enemies."
[1:18:01] Up till this point, Caleb didn't have a
[1:18:04] reason to disagree with his brothers.
[1:18:08] He's just sitting back listening.
[1:18:10] They're like, "The fruit's there. there.
[1:18:11] The land's there and and all the
[1:18:13] Amalachites, they're all there. And he
[1:18:16] says, "Yep, let's go take it." He
[1:18:19] thought they was all on board, man. He
[1:18:21] was ready. He's because everything
[1:18:23] they're saying lined up with the word
[1:18:26] until you get to verse 31.
[1:18:32] But the men that went up with him said,
[1:18:35] "We be not able to go up against the
[1:18:39] people, for they are stronger than we."
[1:18:45] My first of all, the first thing that
[1:18:48] they're looking at that's an error is
[1:18:50] they're looking at their strength.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; It was never about their strength.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; It's never been about how good you are.
[1:18:59] It's never been about how you well you
[1:19:02] do this and how strong. No, it's always
[1:19:04] been about him. It's always been about
[1:19:06] his grace. It's always been about his
[1:19:08] strength. It's always been about his
[1:19:09] life manifesting through our lives.
[1:19:11] Amen. It wasn't them that had defeated
[1:19:14] Egypt. It wasn't them that had opened
[1:19:16] the Red Sea. It wasn't them that had
[1:19:17] caused mana to fall from heaven. It had
[1:19:20] always been him. But in this moment,
[1:19:22] when they wanted an excuse, it became,
[1:19:24] "But we're not able, brother. I'm just
[1:19:28] not able, brother. And I just I know.
[1:19:29] Get in line. Neither am I. None of us
[1:19:31] are. But by the grace of almighty God,
[1:19:34] if we'll just surrender ourselves,
[1:19:36] surrender our weakness and have perfect
[1:19:39] strength through that weakness and allow
[1:19:41] him to work, then you'll overcome. Then
[1:19:43] you'll defeat the enemy. Then that sin
[1:19:45] that so easily besets you, if you'll
[1:19:47] quit trying to do it yourself and you'll
[1:19:49] place it in the hands of God and
[1:19:51] surrender it, then you'll find the
[1:19:53] victory that your heart desires.
[1:19:56] It wasn't about them. And they go so far
[1:19:59] as saying, "Let's make captains and go
[1:20:01] back to Egypt." Why? Well, because the
[1:20:05] land's exactly how the word said it
[1:20:07] would be. What?
[1:20:10] Because those people he said were going
[1:20:12] to be there. They're there.
[1:20:15] And now in this moment, they realize
[1:20:17] it's all true. But all of a sudden,
[1:20:20] they're going to have to swing the sword
[1:20:21] and take the land. Suddenly, it's about
[1:20:24] them squaring off with the devil.
[1:20:26] They're going to have to go fight for
[1:20:27] it. And suddenly, they don't want no
[1:20:29] part of it. It's not going to be easy.
[1:20:33] You're going to have to face the enemy.
[1:20:36] You're going to have to look at the one
[1:20:38] that comes and torments you. You're
[1:20:40] going to have to square your shoulders
[1:20:41] back and take the sword of the word and
[1:20:44] stand there in courage.
[1:20:48] Listen, it's not always about knowing
[1:20:50] all the quotes and knowing all the
[1:20:51] scriptures and knowing that things are
[1:20:53] wonderful, but I heard brother Danny
[1:20:55] Steman say it like this one time. He
[1:20:58] said, "Why wouldn't anybody else go into
[1:20:59] the valley and face Goliath?" He said,
[1:21:01] "They were all in their tents looking
[1:21:03] for a quote on how to defeat him."
[1:21:08] He said, "But somebody was willing to go
[1:21:09] down there and face him and take the
[1:21:11] word and put it in action."
[1:21:14] You're going to have to be willing to
[1:21:15] face it. And it's not always going to be
[1:21:17] pretty and it's not always going to be
[1:21:18] fun. But you got to recognize I've been
[1:21:20] called to this. I'm called to conquer.
[1:21:23] I'm called to overcome. I've been
[1:21:25] anointed in this day for this battle.
[1:21:27] There is no giant going to conquer me.
[1:21:29] But I got to be willing to go into the
[1:21:31] valley tonight and take back what
[1:21:33] belongs to me. Amen.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Suddenly, they want no part.
[1:21:39] And the word has told us that we're
[1:21:41] going to have to fight for every inch of
[1:21:43] ground we get. The word said we would
[1:21:45] have trials and tribulations. The word
[1:21:48] said scoffers would arise. We were told
[1:21:50] that we'd have to fight for every inch.
[1:21:52] Sermons like, "How can I overcome?"
[1:21:54] Possessing the gates of the enemy. And
[1:21:56] now, as we begin to press in and try to
[1:21:58] take the land, and we try to take
[1:22:00] another step, we're faced with the
[1:22:02] reality that it's just as bad as we were
[1:22:04] told it was going to be. The world is
[1:22:07] just as evil as we were told it was
[1:22:09] going to be. It's falling apart just
[1:22:11] like we were told it was going to be.
[1:22:13] But if all those things are true, if all
[1:22:16] those things are true, then so is
[1:22:17] everything else he's told us. I am the
[1:22:19] Lord God that health thee. I'll never
[1:22:22] leave you or forsake you. I go before
[1:22:24] you. I won't have I won't leave you.
[1:22:27] There is a rapture. You're part of it.
[1:22:29] There's a body change. You You'll be
[1:22:31] there and your offspring with you.
[1:22:33] That's the promises.
[1:22:35] They're all true. If the negative things
[1:22:37] are true that the word told us was
[1:22:39] coming, then what about the promises
[1:22:40] where he said, "I'll deliver you. I
[1:22:42] won't leave you. I'll go before you. All
[1:22:45] of those things are true as well
[1:22:47] tonight.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then it's you tonight
[1:22:53] standing at Kadesh
[1:22:55] having seen the fruits.
[1:22:58] How many of you seen the fruits of the
[1:23:00] word in your life? The victories in your
[1:23:03] life, the victories in your family.
[1:23:06] Having seen the fruits, you know it's
[1:23:08] the truth. You know it's real. And the
[1:23:11] enemy stands right there on top of your
[1:23:13] promise and he's daring you to take the
[1:23:16] next step.
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; Well, brother, what's the next step?
[1:23:22] Well, that's different for every one of
[1:23:23] us. Wherever you're at tonight, you got
[1:23:27] to take the next step.
[1:23:29] You got to progress. Brother Brandon
[1:23:31] would deal with it many, many times
[1:23:32] where he said they couldn't put their
[1:23:34] tent too deep in the ground because they
[1:23:37] knew when the pillar of fire moved, they
[1:23:39] had to move with it.
[1:23:41] Now, many people are standing at a place
[1:23:43] that they were led to. The children of
[1:23:44] Israel were led by the pillar of fire to
[1:23:46] place after place after place, but they
[1:23:48] weren't intended to stay in that place
[1:23:50] when the pillar of fire moved.
[1:23:53] And I've said it many times, and may
[1:23:54] maybe even here, but I want to say it
[1:23:56] again. It bears repeating. Many people
[1:23:58] are stuck at at their last camp meeting
[1:24:00] they were at. Many people are stuck at
[1:24:03] the point of their last major victory or
[1:24:05] the point of their last failure.
[1:24:09] Or you're at a place where the Holy
[1:24:10] Spirit led you to but the pillar of fire
[1:24:13] has moved on and yet there you are
[1:24:15] camped.
[1:24:18] Think about it. If you were still
[1:24:20] dancing on the banks of the Red Sea 3
[1:24:22] weeks later,
[1:24:24] you were left behind.
[1:24:26] But you don't know what God did here.
[1:24:29] You don't know what a great miracle it
[1:24:30] was. And you're still there. And yet the
[1:24:33] pillar of fire has journeyed on. Not a
[1:24:36] new message, the same message. Being led
[1:24:39] by the message to progress in your life,
[1:24:42] to take the next step, to go further
[1:24:45] than where you're at in this moment. And
[1:24:48] he's daring you to take that next step,
[1:24:50] daring you to take the land. And I ask
[1:24:51] you tonight in this moment, are you
[1:24:54] willing to conquer? Are you willing to
[1:24:56] face the things that hinder you from
[1:24:58] progressing? The evidence is there.
[1:25:01] We've seen it's real over and over and
[1:25:03] over again. God has proven faithful over
[1:25:06] and over again. Healing, salvations,
[1:25:08] deliverance, transformed lives.
[1:25:12] We've seen it for ourselves. The land is
[1:25:15] exactly how the word described it.
[1:25:19] But battles await you.
[1:25:22] Prophet of God would tell us. He says,
[1:25:24] "Amen. There you are, the believer
[1:25:26] today. Yet we're heir to all things.
[1:25:32] Yet we're heir to every spiritual
[1:25:34] blessing, every physical blessing, every
[1:25:37] blessing the Bible promises. Yet you
[1:25:39] have to fight for every inch of it.
[1:25:42] That's the way God's got it set up. It's
[1:25:44] always been that way. You have to fight
[1:25:46] to possess what you know is your own.
[1:25:50] You have to fight to possess it. And
[1:25:52] that's what we have to do now.
[1:25:56] But they didn't mind coming out. They
[1:25:58] were thankful to come out. God did all
[1:26:00] the fighting. They just had to come out.
[1:26:03] They enjoyed the provisions.
[1:26:05] You know, the people enjoy a church
[1:26:07] service.
[1:26:09] They enjoy when the spirit falls. They
[1:26:12] they enjoy if it's a an emotional
[1:26:15] service and and there's a shout and a
[1:26:16] dance. They enjoy when the Lord deals
[1:26:18] with things. But what about when they
[1:26:20] walk out and they have to apply the
[1:26:21] word?
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; They enjoyed the provisions.
[1:26:28] It was great when God defeated Egypt by
[1:26:30] plagues and the prophet was speaking.
[1:26:32] But now the same God's going to bring
[1:26:34] victory, but he wants to bring victory
[1:26:36] using your hands.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; You in here. It's great. If the
[1:26:40] preacher's preaching and he's cutting
[1:26:42] off demons heads and he's fighting and
[1:26:44] you're Yeah. Yeah. Then you walk out and
[1:26:46] you walk out those doors. Now he's going
[1:26:47] to use your hands.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Now it's going to be your feet.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; And are you going to be willing to
[1:26:53] accept the challenge? That means it's
[1:26:55] going to get bloody. You're going to
[1:26:57] feel the breath of the enemy. Your faith
[1:27:00] is going to be tried. It'll be you
[1:27:02] having to put the sword in action. Your
[1:27:04] hands, your feet. It's now your life
[1:27:08] surrendered so that his life can live
[1:27:10] through you. Yes, he's going to bring
[1:27:13] the victory. But through who?
[1:27:16] A surrendered life willing to stand and
[1:27:19] face the enemy. It's going to be your
[1:27:21] hand that he wants. He wants to see, do
[1:27:23] you trust me in this day? He wants to
[1:27:26] see you put what you say you believe in
[1:27:29] action.
[1:27:31] He promised joy,
[1:27:33] but you're going to have to fight for
[1:27:34] it. He promised peace, but you're going
[1:27:39] to have to fight for it. He promised
[1:27:41] healing. You're going to have to fight
[1:27:43] for it.
[1:27:45] Every inch of it, you're going to have
[1:27:47] to fight for. Now, I want to stop for a
[1:27:49] minute and say this.
[1:27:51] Don't let the fact that you're fighting
[1:27:54] for it make you think it isn't
[1:27:56] happening.
[1:27:58] Don't let the devil come in and make you
[1:28:00] think just because it's been a battle
[1:28:01] and it's been a struggle that God isn't
[1:28:03] moving. In order to possess anything,
[1:28:07] you're going to fight for it. Amen. We
[1:28:10] came out and we've journeyed to the
[1:28:12] border and now it's time to conquer it.
[1:28:16] Listen, the message that we believe is
[1:28:18] full of power. This word is full of
[1:28:20] overcoming power. He's given us
[1:28:22] everything we need to conquer every
[1:28:24] single devil. And I say it's time that
[1:28:27] we quit sitting back taking the bluffs,
[1:28:29] taking the attacks, but it's time that
[1:28:31] we take the word and take the weapons
[1:28:33] and stand our ground. Say, "Devil, I'm
[1:28:35] not backing up anymore. As a matter of
[1:28:37] fact, I'm coming after everything you
[1:28:39] stole from me." Listen, our God is a God
[1:28:41] that says, "Pursue." When David had
[1:28:43] everything stole and his wife taken and
[1:28:45] he prayed, says, "Shall I pursue?" God
[1:28:48] said, "Pursue." We're not called to sit
[1:28:50] back and be robbed day after day after
[1:28:52] day. But the word saying tonight, it's
[1:28:54] time for you to pursue.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Should I go after it? Yes, go after it.
[1:28:59] But he took my joy. Go after it. He took
[1:29:01] my peace. Go after it. He took my
[1:29:04] children. I say go after them tonight.
[1:29:06] You've been given everything you need to
[1:29:08] pursue and to conquer and to overtake in
[1:29:11] this day.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's time to release the
[1:29:15] word.
[1:29:17] You release the word. You take the word
[1:29:20] upon your lips. Prophet of God would
[1:29:22] tell us that's the same as deity
[1:29:24] speaking. Take the word on your lips and
[1:29:26] release the word for your situation and
[1:29:28] let it drive out your enemies. Amen. I'm
[1:29:32] just going to say it like this and we
[1:29:33] may get real plain for a minute.
[1:29:38] I said, Lord, why why are we going to
[1:29:40] preach this? Let's just deal with it.
[1:29:43] It's not time for murmuring and
[1:29:45] complaining.
[1:29:47] It's time for that to stop.
[1:29:50] And I don't just mean about church. I
[1:29:52] mean about everything.
[1:29:55] Quit being so negative.
[1:29:58] We ought to be the most positive people
[1:30:01] in the world. Listen, you're prophet
[1:30:08] and I don't try to to say too much about
[1:30:12] it, you know, around people complaining
[1:30:15] because I think one of the horriblest
[1:30:17] things is to see a man or a woman that's
[1:30:20] constantly complaining.
[1:30:22] I've always thought, "God, keep me from
[1:30:24] it." See that? That weakens faith all
[1:30:28] the time. You know,
[1:30:32] he also says that if you complain too
[1:30:34] much, your water supply gets cut off. He
[1:30:37] says, "Isn't that just like the church
[1:30:38] today? Come out of Egypt, come out of
[1:30:40] the world, out here in this glorious
[1:30:42] church of the living God, the firstborn,
[1:30:45] cuz we have little trials God asked us
[1:30:47] to believe and to hold on. We still
[1:30:49] complain about it." Now, notice another
[1:30:51] thing they had done. They left the
[1:30:53] people back there that had no signs to
[1:30:56] live under the pillar of fire in a cloud
[1:30:58] and was complaining about it. No wonder
[1:31:01] their water supply was cut off. That's
[1:31:04] what's the matter with the church today.
[1:31:06] There's too much grumbling about things,
[1:31:09] complaining. Be satisfied and keep
[1:31:12] moving on,
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; pressing on. Amen. What are you saying?
[1:31:17] Testify of his goodness tonight. Testify
[1:31:19] of his grace tonight. testify of his
[1:31:22] mercies. Testify of all that God has
[1:31:24] done. Listen, if we would testify of all
[1:31:27] the things God has done for us in our
[1:31:28] life, we would be here so long. We
[1:31:30] wouldn't have time to dwell on the
[1:31:32] negative and dwell on the attacks. But
[1:31:34] just let our mouth give voice to the
[1:31:36] goodness of Almighty God, to the grace
[1:31:38] of Almighty God. What he's done in my
[1:31:40] life, what he's done in my children's
[1:31:42] life, what he's done in the church, what
[1:31:44] he's done in the families, what he's
[1:31:46] done for us is an inexhaustible
[1:31:49] testimony that we have to speak positive
[1:31:51] things, to speak life. Amen. Don't be a
[1:31:55] complainer.
[1:31:57] Don't be negative. Rise above negativity
[1:32:01] and begin to speak positive things.
[1:32:05] Speak about the positives in your life,
[1:32:07] the good things in your life.
[1:32:09] Speak about the goodness you see in
[1:32:11] other people instead of the negatives.
[1:32:15] My, that one's hard sometimes.
[1:32:18] Why is it so much easier to see the
[1:32:20] negatives in our brothers and sisters
[1:32:23] versus the positives that they bring?
[1:32:27] It's life.
[1:32:29] There's going to be plenty of
[1:32:30] opportunity to grumble.
[1:32:32] Attacks are coming. Bad days are coming.
[1:32:36] People are going to offend you.
[1:32:41] It's coming.
[1:32:43] You're going to have bad days. You're
[1:32:46] going to have tough trials. You're going
[1:32:48] to have people turn their back on you.
[1:32:51] You're going to get talked about.
[1:32:54] You're going to get offended. It's
[1:32:55] coming. But when those attacks come and
[1:32:58] those days come and those battles come,
[1:33:00] you have to be determined. I'm going to
[1:33:03] conquer. I'm going to overcome. This is
[1:33:07] not going to take me down. I know this
[1:33:08] isn't going to get me down, but I'm
[1:33:10] going to look away from this attack. I'm
[1:33:12] going to look away from this negative.
[1:33:14] I'm going to look to all the wonderful
[1:33:16] promises that are in this word. I'm
[1:33:18] going to look at the fact that a message
[1:33:19] has called my name. That I'm
[1:33:21] predestined. That I was seen there
[1:33:23] before the foundation of the world
[1:33:24] shouting. I've got so much to thank him
[1:33:27] for. He's been so so good to me. That is
[1:33:30] going to be my focus.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Facts are going to be lined up.
[1:33:38] may be against you. They use facts at
[1:33:41] Kadesh.
[1:33:42] Everything they said was factual about
[1:33:46] all the giants. Bailac is going to try
[1:33:48] to come and show the backside of the
[1:33:50] camp this flaw, that flaw, this mess up,
[1:33:55] that mistake.
[1:33:57] that spirit, it'll come around and begin
[1:33:59] to point out the backside of church
[1:34:01] leaders, all your brothers and sisters,
[1:34:04] their humanities, their faults, their
[1:34:06] failures, their worst parts, and not the
[1:34:10] whole picture.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Listen, just let me say something
[1:34:15] that is not spiritual to be able to see
[1:34:18] other people's faults and failures.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; It's not spiritual to be able to
[1:34:23] criticize. anyone can criticize.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; But I ask you, when it happens, will you
[1:34:29] conquer? Will you be the one that raises
[1:34:31] up and begins to point out the
[1:34:33] positives? Will you be the one that
[1:34:35] says, "You know, we really shouldn't,
[1:34:36] you know, talk about that brother that
[1:34:37] way." Or will you join in? It's so easy
[1:34:40] to join in.
[1:34:42] It's so easy because we all notice each
[1:34:45] other's thoughts. We do. Whether we
[1:34:48] dwell on or not, we notice and then
[1:34:50] somebody starts yapping and we step
[1:34:52] right into it. ask you to conquer those
[1:34:54] things. Raise above those things. Not
[1:34:56] entertaining, not speaking gossip, not
[1:34:59] piling on. News flash, we all have
[1:35:03] carnal parts.
[1:35:06] We all have things that could be better,
[1:35:08] traits that rub other people the wrong
[1:35:11] way, shortcomings of character. And
[1:35:15] despite all that, God called us.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Despite all that, he said, "I've chosen
[1:35:20] you. I sent you a message. I sent unto
[1:35:23] you Malachi 4. God called us. God chose
[1:35:27] us. God loves us. And God is moving in
[1:35:29] our midst. I love this quote. He said,
[1:35:31] "Yes, Israel had their carnal parts.
[1:35:33] They had their side that wasn't
[1:35:35] praiseworthy." We can all say amen to
[1:35:37] that. But in spite of their
[1:35:38] imperfections, by the purpose of God
[1:35:41] that works through election by grace and
[1:35:44] not by works, they had the cloud by day
[1:35:46] and the pillar of fire by night. They
[1:35:48] had the smitten rock, the brazen
[1:35:50] serpent, and the signs and wonders. They
[1:35:52] were vindicated not in themselves, but
[1:35:55] in God. Do we have our flaws? Yes. Do we
[1:35:58] have our failures? Yes. Do we have our
[1:35:59] back parts? Yes. Oh, but we're
[1:36:01] vindicated by the pillar of fire, the
[1:36:04] pillar of cloud by day. God is with us.
[1:36:06] God has called us. God has chosen us. So
[1:36:09] look away from the carnality. Look away
[1:36:11] from your own faults and failures and
[1:36:13] look to the fact I've been called. I've
[1:36:16] been chosen. And I've been called for a
[1:36:18] purpose to overcome in Leodysa. To make
[1:36:21] it all the way, not die in the
[1:36:23] wilderness. Not stop halfway. I'm going
[1:36:25] to make it all the way over.
[1:36:28] Hallelujah.
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:32] Oh, but I'm a failure. Yes.
[1:36:38] I've never understood trying to convince
[1:36:40] people that we're not.
[1:36:43] But we're called.
[1:36:45] But I've got so many mistakes. Yeah,
[1:36:49] take a number. Get in line.
[1:36:52] This ain't a pity party.
[1:36:54] But we're going to make it.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; We're called and chosen. God's in the
[1:36:59] camp. God's in our midst. God's breaking
[1:37:02] the bread of life to us. He's going
[1:37:04] before us. He's giving us the victory.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We've got so much to praise
[1:37:09] him for.
[1:37:11] The spies come back
[1:37:14] and the first part of what they said was
[1:37:17] perfect.
[1:37:19] They agreed with the word.
[1:37:22] It's real. Look at the fruit. And in our
[1:37:25] own walk, if we would stick to our
[1:37:28] original testimony,
[1:37:30] you know how it is when you first fall
[1:37:33] in love with Jesus.
[1:37:35] when you first come back, when you have
[1:37:37] that wakeup call and he calls your name
[1:37:39] and and you step in and God is good and
[1:37:41] thank God for his mercies and God is
[1:37:44] wonderful. If you'd stick to that
[1:37:45] testimony,
[1:37:47] but where we at a year down the road?
[1:37:51] Where are we at two years down the road?
[1:37:54] You know, when you first fell in love
[1:37:55] with Jesus and you experienced him for
[1:37:57] yourself and you're like, "It's real.
[1:37:58] Look at the fruits. It's true. Just how
[1:38:01] the spies did." But then all of a sudden
[1:38:03] sickness strikes.
[1:38:05] Then all of a sudden strife's in the
[1:38:07] home and jobs not going good. And
[1:38:11] suddenly it's a battle. And if we aren't
[1:38:13] careful, we begin to speak the second
[1:38:15] part of their testimony.
[1:38:18] And we begin to give voice to the
[1:38:20] strength of the enemy instead of the
[1:38:23] strength of our God.
[1:38:26] They began to give voice to the strength
[1:38:28] of the enemy. Voice to the attack. Voice
[1:38:31] to the sickness. voice to the
[1:38:32] depression. You don't know how bad this
[1:38:35] is.
[1:38:37] You don't know how bad this situation
[1:38:40] is.
[1:38:42] And I admit I don't. But what I do know
[1:38:45] is how great my God is. How true his
[1:38:48] promises are. And we begin to give voice
[1:38:51] to the wrong thing. But this trial so
[1:38:53] big, this temptation so hard. This has
[1:38:56] run in my family for years.
[1:39:00] My granddaddy had it and my daddy had it
[1:39:02] and now and now I have it. Yeah. It's
[1:39:05] going to be a fight.
[1:39:08] You're called out to conquer. You can't
[1:39:11] conquer without a battle. Amen. Prophet
[1:39:14] of God tells us. He said, "I'll give it
[1:39:16] to you. It's full of giants. You'll have
[1:39:18] to fight every inch of the way, but
[1:39:20] every place the souls are your
[1:39:21] footsteps. That's possession. Go take it
[1:39:24] sure as I'll be with you." What's it
[1:39:26] saying? You may be getting hit time
[1:39:28] after time, but just keep putting one
[1:39:30] foot in front of the other. It's a hard
[1:39:32] day. Take a step. I've got a It's worse
[1:39:34] than ever. Take a step. The symptoms are
[1:39:36] worse. Take a step. My son went further
[1:39:39] into the world. Take a step. The job
[1:39:41] situation's worse than ever. Take
[1:39:43] another step and put one foot in front
[1:39:46] of the other foot because footsteps are
[1:39:48] possession.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Just keep progressing.
[1:39:54] church. Anybody can testify in the
[1:39:56] revival.
[1:39:59] Anybody can testify after the special
[1:40:01] meetings.
[1:40:03] Anybody can worship on the mountaintop.
[1:40:08] Job's good. Family's good. Health's
[1:40:12] good. But the minute the hardships
[1:40:14] begin,
[1:40:16] they want to back up. They want to back
[1:40:19] off. All of a sudden, their praise and
[1:40:21] service isn't so noticeable.
[1:40:25] All of a sudden, the shout is fewer and
[1:40:27] far between. But sons and daughters of
[1:40:30] God, praise and worship isn't
[1:40:32] conditional.
[1:40:34] It It isn't based on circumstance. I
[1:40:37] don't need the perfect song to make me
[1:40:39] shout. I don't need the perfect sermon
[1:40:41] to make me dance. I don't need
[1:40:42] everything to be right. I praise him
[1:40:44] because of all he's done for me. I
[1:40:46] worship him because he's such a good God
[1:40:48] and he's been so good to me. It's not
[1:40:51] circumstantial. And when the wars come
[1:40:53] and the battles come and I want to quit.
[1:40:55] You ever been there? And I want to quit
[1:40:58] and I want to just say I I've had enough
[1:41:00] but I can't because it ain't me and it
[1:41:02] ain't my strength. But there's something
[1:41:04] that was deposited on the inside of
[1:41:05] every true believer before the
[1:41:07] foundation of the world. It's a segene
[1:41:09] of God and it cannot quit. It cannot
[1:41:12] stop. And just as Christ listen, he was
[1:41:15] going to Calvary and you know he wanted
[1:41:16] to stop but he couldn't stop because
[1:41:18] there was something on the inside of
[1:41:19] him. There was a bride that had to be
[1:41:21] manifested and he had to be put to sleep
[1:41:23] in order for that bride to be pulled
[1:41:25] from his side. And now there's a bride
[1:41:28] that can't stop because there's a Christ
[1:41:30] on the inside of her that has to be
[1:41:32] manifested to a dying world. We can't
[1:41:35] quit, but we're called to conquer.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; We can't back off. Even when all hell's
[1:41:45] against you, there's something inside of
[1:41:48] you that says, "Even now.
[1:41:51] Even now, his word is true. Even now,
[1:41:55] I'm a child of God. Even now, I will
[1:41:58] remember his benefits. I'm going to
[1:42:00] trust him. Even now, things have gotten
[1:42:03] so much worse. Even now,
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; and even now, I'm going to conquer."
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; What does it mean to conquer?
[1:42:12] to gain or acquire by force of arms.
[1:42:16] To bring under domination or control,
[1:42:19] especially by conquest,
[1:42:22] to gain a victory over, surmount,
[1:42:24] master, overcome.
[1:42:27] All of these things tell us that there
[1:42:29] was a fight,
[1:42:32] there was a battle.
[1:42:34] Yeah, I say this a lot. You know,
[1:42:36] brother Jonathan, we were mentioning
[1:42:38] some things like this on the way here,
[1:42:39] but
[1:42:41] so many people get so discouraged when
[1:42:43] they get punched in a battle or the
[1:42:45] devil lands a blow. They're like, "Oh,
[1:42:48] the devil hit that." Well, yeah, you're
[1:42:50] in a fight. What What do you think?
[1:42:51] What's he supposed to do?
[1:42:53] But I promise you, if you think back to
[1:42:56] great fighters down through history and
[1:42:59] think about their record, nobody
[1:43:01] remembers how many times they got
[1:43:02] punched. I don't remember how many times
[1:43:05] Mike Tyson got hit. All I remember is he
[1:43:08] won.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; And when we get to that final day, the
[1:43:11] Lord's not going to look at it and go,
[1:43:13] "Well, you got hit hard on this day and
[1:43:15] you got hit hard on this day." The only
[1:43:16] thing that shows is you answered the
[1:43:19] bell. You got back up. You walked back
[1:43:21] to the middle of the ring and you kept
[1:43:23] fighting and at the end of the fight,
[1:43:25] your hand was raised as victorious.
[1:43:28] Yes, you're getting hit because you're
[1:43:30] in a fight. That means you're in a
[1:43:32] battle. Now answer the bell. Come back
[1:43:34] to the middle of the ring and recognize
[1:43:36] I've been called to conquer. I've been
[1:43:38] called for this moment. I've called for
[1:43:40] a fight. I may get hit. I may get
[1:43:42] knocked down, but I can't stay down.
[1:43:44] Something raises me back up and says
[1:43:46] it's time to do it again. And this time,
[1:43:49] I'm going to win.
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:53] Hallelujah.
[1:43:55] The thing about Israel and that
[1:43:58] generation that wandered in the
[1:43:59] wilderness is they never did conquer.
[1:44:02] Not at any point in their story.
[1:44:06] It was a cycle. It was constant failure
[1:44:10] with God bailing them out time after
[1:44:13] time after time.
[1:44:16] God had continually delivered them
[1:44:18] despite their attitudes, despite their
[1:44:21] unbelief. And before Kadesh, they had
[1:44:24] never conquered. Really, if you read the
[1:44:26] story up to Kadish, you're not even
[1:44:28] expecting them to conquer. They had
[1:44:30] always murmured. They had always
[1:44:32] complained. They had always turned and
[1:44:35] walked away in the wrong moments. They
[1:44:37] griped at each place. They griped at
[1:44:38] each hardship and yet called out
[1:44:43] following a message.
[1:44:47] There's a cycle.
[1:44:49] I want to say this to you young people
[1:44:50] gathered here tonight. And you know
[1:44:52] what? Everybody here,
[1:44:54] your problems don't just go away.
[1:44:58] You don't just outgrow those things.
[1:45:01] You have to overcome them.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; You have to conquer them. Many times,
[1:45:07] young people have issues and whatnot,
[1:45:09] and they think, "If I can just grow up
[1:45:10] and get married, then these things will
[1:45:11] be taken care of." No, those issues are
[1:45:13] going to follow you into your marriage.
[1:45:16] grown-ups. We may be older now and still
[1:45:19] dealing with things that we've been
[1:45:20] dealing with since we was teenagers
[1:45:22] because we keep expecting it to just go
[1:45:24] away. They don't just go away. You got
[1:45:27] to face these things. You got to admit
[1:45:29] shortcomings. You got to repent of those
[1:45:31] failures, put them under the blood, rise
[1:45:33] up, and conquer those things by the
[1:45:36] power of the Holy Spirit. We can't just
[1:45:38] pretend until these things go away.
[1:45:40] Amen. We got to become subject to the
[1:45:44] word. We got to bring ourselves subject.
[1:45:47] I'll give some examples. If you
[1:45:49] constantly respond in doubt, then you
[1:45:51] will always respond in doubt until you
[1:45:54] conquer that. If you always respond in
[1:45:57] temper, then you will always respond in
[1:46:00] temper until you conquer that.
[1:46:03] If you always fall to the same besetting
[1:46:05] sin, the same complex, the same fear,
[1:46:10] then you're going to continue that until
[1:46:13] you face it. Quit making excuses of,
[1:46:16] "Well, my mama was this way. Mama was
[1:46:20] nervous person. I I just got it from
[1:46:21] mama.
[1:46:24] Daddy was this way. They just got I
[1:46:26] understand that family traits are passed
[1:46:28] on. I've got plenty of bad ones come
[1:46:30] down through my life.
[1:46:33] Think about it. Why you think the doctor
[1:46:35] wants to know your daddy's family
[1:46:36] history when you go sing? Your daddy's
[1:46:38] medical history. What do you is there?
[1:46:40] Did your mom or dad have diabetes? Did
[1:46:42] your mom or dad? Because they know those
[1:46:44] things can be passed on.
[1:46:47] And the devil comes and he says, "Yeah,
[1:46:49] but you know, you're going to have to
[1:46:50] deal with this the rest of your life
[1:46:52] because it came down from great
[1:46:53] granddaddy and then granddaddy. And then
[1:46:54] I just like the devil to know tonight
[1:46:56] that's okay cuz I got a new father and
[1:46:58] the genetics of him is flowing through
[1:47:00] that. his blood flowing through my vein.
[1:47:02] And he was a conqueror. He was an
[1:47:03] overcomer. And the life that he lived
[1:47:05] now lives on the inside of me. So I'm
[1:47:07] not subject to family curses. I'm not
[1:47:10] subject to family cycles. I'm not
[1:47:12] subject to those things. I have a right
[1:47:13] tonight to stand up and say, "By the
[1:47:15] power of the new birth, by the power of
[1:47:17] the Holy Ghost. I am no longer subject
[1:47:19] to the things that the devil has put in
[1:47:21] my family line." Amen.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; God brought us here to conquer, to be
[1:47:26] cycle breakers. He brought you here to
[1:47:28] conquer and he's given you everything
[1:47:30] you have need of to do it. And he
[1:47:33] expects us to do it.
[1:47:36] And it starts with
[1:47:40] self.
[1:47:42] It starts with self. You have to conquer
[1:47:46] this land.
[1:47:48] You've got to conquer this earth right
[1:47:51] here. And the way you do that is by
[1:47:53] dying out daily. dying out to your flesh
[1:47:56] and letting the Holy Spirit reign. You
[1:47:58] got to crucify this flesh.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; You got to crucify this flesh. Amen.
[1:48:03] This flesh is not your friend. Let's
[1:48:06] just go ahead. You got two enemies. And
[1:48:09] I'm not sure which one's worse. The
[1:48:11] devil and this flesh. The reason I say
[1:48:14] that is because sometimes we don't
[1:48:15] recognize this one.
[1:48:18] It is not your friend. You are your
[1:48:21] worst enemy. The prophet of God said
[1:48:22] that. The worst enemy I've got is
[1:48:24] William Brown. You are your worst enemy
[1:48:26] and you've got to die every day to your
[1:48:29] own will and your own desires. Listen to
[1:48:31] the prophet right here. He says, "And
[1:48:33] you're bound to be backsliding
[1:48:34] constantly."
[1:48:36] What?
[1:48:39] No, not me. I'm stalwart.
[1:48:44] You're that's you are
[1:48:47] bound to be backsliding constantly. So,
[1:48:49] it takes a constant prayer to God. Paul
[1:48:51] said, "I die daily." And if Paul had to
[1:48:54] die daily, how much more am I going? I'm
[1:48:58] going to have to stay dead all the time.
[1:49:00] If Paul had to die daily to stay right
[1:49:02] with God, and so we'll all have to do
[1:49:04] that. Just die out to yourself. And
[1:49:07] that's getting God's way.
[1:49:11] &gt;&gt; See, what happens is that old man, that
[1:49:13] flesh that you conquered, it begins to
[1:49:15] try to raise up again. That flesh begins
[1:49:18] to try to rise up again. that
[1:49:20] rebelliousness that you conquered, it
[1:49:22] tries to rise up again. Don't don't
[1:49:24] don't be shocked when the thing that
[1:49:26] you've conquered begins to lift its head
[1:49:28] up once again. Don't don't don't be
[1:49:31] shocked by that. Don't think, "Well,"
[1:49:32] and here's where the devil plays. As
[1:49:35] soon as that thing raises up, he begins
[1:49:36] to say, "See, you didn't get nothing
[1:49:38] from God.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; See, you didn't get anything from God."
[1:49:41] Listen, I believe in a work of the Holy
[1:49:43] Ghost that keeps us from sin and makes
[1:49:45] us overcomers. But we got to get away
[1:49:47] from the mindset that every time I got a
[1:49:49] little thought that came through my head
[1:49:50] or every time I got a little stumble.
[1:49:52] Well, I got nothing. And we back off
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; and we give it all back.
[1:50:00] And the devil comes in and say, "See,
[1:50:01] you didn't get nothing from God. I must
[1:50:03] not be a real Christian because that old
[1:50:05] man tried to resurrect. That old man's
[1:50:07] always going to try to resurrect for the
[1:50:09] rest of your life." And the devil comes
[1:50:13] and tries to make you feel guilty
[1:50:14] because you're fighting battles. He
[1:50:16] tries to make you feel like a failure
[1:50:18] for the temptation that he brought.
[1:50:21] Think about that for a minute. Fighting
[1:50:23] battles is not failure. Being tempted is
[1:50:28] not failure. Jesus Christ was tempted.
[1:50:31] Jesus fought battles, but he was a
[1:50:34] conqueror. And that's what we are in
[1:50:37] this day. You're going to face
[1:50:38] temptation and battles the rest of your
[1:50:40] life in some form of another. But I want
[1:50:43] to go ahead and tell you the good news.
[1:50:44] You are going to win those battles.
[1:50:46] You're going to overcome those battles.
[1:50:48] You're going to rise above those
[1:50:49] temptations. How? Because greater is he
[1:50:52] that is in you than he that is in the
[1:50:55] world. Amen. He didn't send you here by
[1:50:57] yourself. He didn't ask you to do it all
[1:51:00] along. This power, it's a tested power.
[1:51:03] This power, it works. He said what? be
[1:51:06] of good cheer. I have overcome the
[1:51:10] world. Amen. And then what's he do? He
[1:51:12] takes that power. He takes the very life
[1:51:15] that he overcame with and he sends it
[1:51:17] back to you. And the word says he was
[1:51:20] tempted how? In all points as we are. He
[1:51:26] was tempted in all points. So what's
[1:51:28] that mean? The depression that's
[1:51:30] attacking you, it's already been
[1:51:32] defeated by that life. The fear has
[1:51:34] already been defeated by that life. The
[1:51:36] lust that comes and tries to tempt you
[1:51:39] has already been defeated by that life.
[1:51:41] And then he gives that life to you to
[1:51:44] place in your life, the Holy Ghost. And
[1:51:46] he says, "Now conquer like I conquered.
[1:51:50] How do I do it?" The very life that did
[1:51:52] it once comes in into your life. Many of
[1:51:55] you have been battling things for weeks
[1:51:57] and months and years and you're fighting
[1:52:00] it and you're fighting it and you're
[1:52:01] struggling and you're struggling and yet
[1:52:02] there's a life on the inside of you
[1:52:04] looking at that thing saying, "Will you
[1:52:06] turn me loose? I've already defeated
[1:52:08] this thing once. Let me out. I've
[1:52:09] already defeated depression once. I've
[1:52:11] already overcome anxiety once. I've
[1:52:13] defeated lust before. Just turn me loose
[1:52:16] and let me take this devil on. Turn the
[1:52:20] God on the inside of you loose in your
[1:52:22] battle tonight. Quit trying to do it on
[1:52:24] your own, but say, "Lord, I'm letting
[1:52:26] you fight this battle for me. I'm
[1:52:28] turning you loose against my enemies."
[1:52:31] Hallelujah.
[1:52:33] It gives you a strength. Where you
[1:52:35] couldn't, now you can. Whereas before
[1:52:39] you would constantly fall, now you can
[1:52:41] stand. Amen.
[1:52:44] Glory. You have the power to keep the
[1:52:48] old man dead. That doesn't mean he
[1:52:50] doesn't try to raise up, but you got to
[1:52:53] keep him dead. Listen to your prophet.
[1:52:56] Nothing less. He that will follow me,
[1:52:59] let him deny himself. Take up his cross
[1:53:03] and die daily. How can you die daily
[1:53:06] unless there's something alive daily to
[1:53:08] die to?
[1:53:10] That's right. Stay dead there on the
[1:53:12] cross. That's right. Now, here's the
[1:53:14] word we don't like.
[1:53:17] Agony.
[1:53:19] Oh, brother Aaron, the Christian walks
[1:53:21] full of joy and peace and overcoming and
[1:53:23] it's just wonderful and happy. All the
[1:53:25] agony.
[1:53:29] How often is that going to be every day?
[1:53:36] This sounds awesome.
[1:53:41] You got to crucify your flesh every day.
[1:53:45] And it's not a fun thing to do. Now
[1:53:46] admittedly, some people have stronger
[1:53:49] natures than others. Some people just by
[1:53:51] our natural makeup, it's a it's a more
[1:53:54] difficult thing for some people. I I I
[1:53:56] get that.
[1:53:58] But what it means here is it's very easy
[1:54:01] to be who you are
[1:54:04] by your natural birth. It's easy for me
[1:54:06] to act like my dad.
[1:54:09] My dad, God, God God rest his soul. He
[1:54:12] was a saved man. But there was many
[1:54:13] years he didn't serve the Lord. And I
[1:54:15] saw that horrible temper. What they'd
[1:54:17] say about my dad, he didn't get mad,
[1:54:18] he'd go mad.
[1:54:23] That's there somewhere on the inside of
[1:54:24] me. I've seen it try to raise up. It
[1:54:26] would be easy to go that way.
[1:54:29] I'll give an example.
[1:54:32] I don't share this with everybody, but
[1:54:34] I've already told y'all. Y'all are my
[1:54:35] friends. I love y'all. By nature,
[1:54:39] Brother John may remember this side of
[1:54:40] me. By nature, I have a very smart
[1:54:42] mouth.
[1:54:44] Somebody says something, my brain says
[1:54:46] something and I got something to pop off
[1:54:47] or but I don't want to be that way.
[1:54:50] So I say, God, the same Holy Spirit that
[1:54:52] saved me and cleaned me up and gave me
[1:54:56] the power to overcome, Lord, will you
[1:54:57] give me a sweeter spirit and a more
[1:54:59] gentle response? Lord, will you allow me
[1:55:01] to think before No. Well, that should I
[1:55:04] say that?
[1:55:06] Can I?
[1:55:10] I tell my wife sometimes. I said, you
[1:55:11] know, the filter actually works. you
[1:55:13] would give me an award if you knew all
[1:55:14] the stuff I didn't say.
[1:55:17] But it's just an honest moment. I I
[1:55:19] that's a battle I have. My thoughts are
[1:55:22] smart. Alec,
[1:55:24] I'm not proud. I'm not proud of that.
[1:55:26] It's actually gotten me in a lot of
[1:55:27] trouble. It's hurt feelings. It's made
[1:55:30] friends very angry at me. It's something
[1:55:31] I have to work on because in the moment,
[1:55:34] that's the easy thing. That's the
[1:55:36] default. Somebody says something to me,
[1:55:39] that's the default. left to eat. The
[1:55:40] agony is
[1:55:45] and walking away.
[1:55:47] The agony is in that moment where you
[1:55:49] feel justified to let that temper loose.
[1:55:53] You've been done wrong, genuinely done
[1:55:57] wrong. You have that moment where that
[1:56:00] temper raises up and in your mind and
[1:56:02] according to the flesh, you have every
[1:56:04] right to let it fly. What's the agony?
[1:56:07] Let me goes easy.
[1:56:10] The agony is turning away and saying,
[1:56:12] "God bless you, brother.
[1:56:15] Crucify
[1:56:16] that flesh."
[1:56:18] That's the there's there's agony in
[1:56:20] that. It's easy to be angry if you got a
[1:56:23] temper problem.
[1:56:25] It's easy to talk about people if you
[1:56:27] got a gossip issue, but agony is
[1:56:30] crucifying and killing that part of
[1:56:32] yourself and keeping it dead when a
[1:56:35] situation arises that you feel warrants
[1:56:37] that response.
[1:56:40] There's agony in walking away when you
[1:56:42] got so much you could say.
[1:56:46] You got to crucify that guy. Cast down
[1:56:48] your ideas. Cast down everything you
[1:56:50] know. We got to get to a place, church,
[1:56:52] where we quit letting all the wonderful
[1:56:54] stuff we know hinder us.
[1:56:58] They say, "What do you mean by that?"
[1:57:00] You got to forget what you know and know
[1:57:01] him. Paul said he had to forget
[1:57:04] everything he knew in order to know
[1:57:06] Christ. It was because of all he knew
[1:57:09] that he had to die daily. Think about
[1:57:12] all the teaching that would try to come
[1:57:14] back. all the wonderful things he knew
[1:57:16] and the arguments he and the way he he
[1:57:18] had to die to that every single day and
[1:57:20] he had to keep his own thinking from
[1:57:22] creeping in.
[1:57:25] Prophet of God tells us you've got to
[1:57:27] repent and die daily to live in Jesus
[1:57:30] Christ. So every daily every day you've
[1:57:34] got to die every day to live in Christ
[1:57:37] Jesus. If you want to progress,
[1:57:41] if you want to move forward, there are
[1:57:43] things you got to be willing to fight
[1:57:44] about yourself.
[1:57:46] We got to be willing to take account of
[1:57:48] who we are and then be willing to
[1:57:50] crucify the parts that hinder us. You
[1:57:53] want revival fires in your home. You
[1:57:55] want revival fires in your life. More
[1:57:57] importantly, that's where they start.
[1:57:58] Revival fires start in you. They don't
[1:58:00] start here. Revival fires start in you.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; You want revival fires, die daily.
[1:58:06] Brother Brandon would tell us the
[1:58:07] quickest way to end a revival is let the
[1:58:09] old man resurrect. If you want those
[1:58:11] revival fires burning, you want to see
[1:58:13] it in your home. You want to see it in
[1:58:14] your children. You want to see it in the
[1:58:16] house of God. How do I do it, brother?
[1:58:17] Die daily.
[1:58:19] Lay down more of yourself and seek more
[1:58:21] of God. That old man rising up will put
[1:58:24] that fire out so quick. Sure. It's that
[1:58:26] flesh. Think about it. What is it? It's
[1:58:28] the flesh that keeps you from praying
[1:58:30] through.
[1:58:33] It's the flesh that keeps you from
[1:58:35] praying enough and reading your Bible
[1:58:37] enough. It's the flesh that keeps you
[1:58:39] from entering in. Your spirit wants to.
[1:58:43] You have you felt the joy of the Lord.
[1:58:46] He's done so much for you and yet your
[1:58:48] flesh is tired.
[1:58:51] You got mad at a brother. You got upset
[1:58:54] about something that was said and works
[1:58:56] got you frustrated and now you're
[1:58:58] struggling to break through.
[1:59:01] It's time to die again.
[1:59:04] Prophet says, and I want to take my
[1:59:06] subject this morning of this, how can I
[1:59:09] overcome? Now, I chose this because I
[1:59:12] think that it's a time that we should
[1:59:13] never let the spirit of revival die.
[1:59:15] We've got to keep in revival,
[1:59:18] constantly revived every day. Paul said
[1:59:21] he had to die daily that Christ could
[1:59:22] live. And we must never let that revival
[1:59:25] die within us. What's he saying?
[1:59:28] Paul said, "In order to have revival,
[1:59:29] you got to die daily." If you want those
[1:59:31] revival fires burning, you got to die
[1:59:33] daily. Because the idea, church, isn't
[1:59:36] that we just come out. There was a
[1:59:38] calling out, but there's got to be a
[1:59:40] going into. We've got to be progressing
[1:59:43] towards that body change, progressing
[1:59:45] towards that rapture, progressing
[1:59:46] towards the promised land. The idea is
[1:59:49] to take the land and to take the
[1:59:50] rapture. And we're never going to do
[1:59:52] that being satisfied with who we are.
[1:59:56] We're never going to do that being
[1:59:57] satisfied with where we are. And I don't
[1:59:59] mean to nitpick ourselves to death.
[2:00:01] That's not what I mean. But I mean when
[2:00:03] we see something contrary to the word
[2:00:05] rise up in our flesh that we take it
[2:00:07] subject and by the word we cast that
[2:00:10] thing down.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:14] I got to have more. I got to get more.
[2:00:17] I've got to improve.
[2:00:19] But here's the real problem with
[2:00:21] humanity. The problem is we tend to take
[2:00:23] pride in what we're good at and what
[2:00:26] we're best at and then we try to build
[2:00:28] on that. And so the areas that we're not
[2:00:31] so good in get neglected and we're we're
[2:00:34] good at this. So we put another block
[2:00:36] there and man, we build that up real
[2:00:38] strong and real good and and that part's
[2:00:40] getting all neglected
[2:00:43] instead of facing what we're worst at.
[2:00:46] What is our weakness?
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; What is your weakest point as a
[2:00:50] Christian?
[2:00:52] And so what we like to do is just look
[2:00:54] this way
[2:00:58] and ignore it instead of addressing it.
[2:01:02] Lord
[2:01:05] Lord, why do I why do I struggle to read
[2:01:08] the Bible?
[2:01:12] Why why do I struggle in this area that
[2:01:15] I shouldn't struggle? But why?
[2:01:18] Instead of just ignoring it and moving
[2:01:20] on, we got to face our weaknesses.
[2:01:23] Acknowledge what I need to attack and go
[2:01:27] after it.
[2:01:29] I I say this all the time. Some people
[2:01:32] do not regularly self-reflect and it
[2:01:35] shows.
[2:01:38] I believe very very very strongly in
[2:01:40] self-reflection,
[2:01:42] more importantly reflection through the
[2:01:43] word.
[2:01:45] but being willing to stop and look at my
[2:01:48] life and examine my life and say, "How
[2:01:51] can I grow as a person?" Because let me
[2:01:55] get back to what I said at the very
[2:01:56] beginning. Yes, the token came to
[2:01:58] deliver us from sin and to seal us that
[2:02:00] we could take a rapture.
[2:02:03] But I don't believe that there's
[2:02:06] mean-spirited
[2:02:09] mean as a rattlesnake people going in in
[2:02:13] the rapture. What do you mean by I know
[2:02:15] a lot of people, man, you know, they
[2:02:18] don't watch bad movies, they don't say
[2:02:19] bad words, they dress to a tea, but
[2:02:21] buddy, you cross them and they're mean
[2:02:25] and quick with that tongue. And I'm
[2:02:27] like, I believe that the token that the
[2:02:29] Holy Spirit can work on that.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; Not just make it to where I don't do
[2:02:35] these sinful things and I dress the part
[2:02:36] and I'm always in church with a token do
[2:02:38] that. Absolutely. But we got to let it
[2:02:40] work in all of our lives. What about my
[2:02:43] attitude when the preacher won't be
[2:02:44] quiet and he preaches too long? What
[2:02:47] about my attitude when the song service
[2:02:49] ain't going?
[2:02:51] I don't know. Apparently, I need to work
[2:02:53] on that. The other night, something went
[2:02:54] wrong in the song service and everybody
[2:02:56] said, "We could see it on your face."
[2:02:57] I'm like, "Huh?
[2:03:01] Really?" Because they nailed me. And I
[2:03:03] was like,
[2:03:06] "We all need to check up our attitudes.
[2:03:08] Why do we come to church? Is it for a
[2:03:09] concert?" It's for worship. to him. It's
[2:03:13] We're just here to pour our hearts out
[2:03:15] and and and to get all we can get from
[2:03:17] him. But but Lord, work on our
[2:03:18] attitudes. How how can I be a better
[2:03:20] friend?
[2:03:23] How can I be a better dad?
[2:03:27] How can I be a better husband?
[2:03:30] What are my weaknesses in that area? And
[2:03:33] instead of shying away from them and
[2:03:35] making excuses for them, we should make
[2:03:37] them a matter of prayer and say, "I'm
[2:03:39] going to conquer those things
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; by the power of the Holy Spirit. I'm
[2:03:43] going to let him change me and mold me,
[2:03:45] and I got things I got to deal with,
[2:03:47] Lord. I don't want to be that way, but
[2:03:49] let that same power of the Holy Spirit
[2:03:51] mold my flesh." You know, I say this all
[2:03:54] the time. Self-reflection is no good if
[2:03:56] you find nothing wrong.
[2:03:59] How you going to apply the blood or
[2:04:00] apply the token if you find nothing that
[2:04:02] you need to apply it to? I used to get
[2:04:04] very frustrated and I understand it now,
[2:04:06] but the school when I was a school
[2:04:08] teacher, they would come in twice a year
[2:04:09] and they would um observe you teach. And
[2:04:12] they would tell me, no matter how good
[2:04:15] the lesson is, no matter how perfect it
[2:04:17] is, we have to find at least two things
[2:04:19] wrong. And that used to really frustrate
[2:04:22] me. I'm like, you're telling me I can't
[2:04:24] do this good enough?
[2:04:26] But now I look back and I realize they
[2:04:28] didn't want you complacent.
[2:04:30] They didn't want you settling in going,
[2:04:32] "Well, I got this. I'm good enough. I
[2:04:33] don't have to learn. I don't have to
[2:04:34] progress. I don't." So they would look
[2:04:36] and they would nitpick you to where you
[2:04:38] never got comfortable. Listen, the only
[2:04:40] thing I'm comfortable in is that his
[2:04:41] grace is sufficient. We can be
[2:04:43] comfortable in that. We can be
[2:04:45] comfortable in that the sacrifice was
[2:04:47] accepted. We can be comfortable in that
[2:04:49] our name was lit written on the lamb's
[2:04:50] book of life before the foundation of
[2:04:52] the world. But he wants the people who
[2:04:54] manifest his life through our lives. So
[2:04:57] I can't be comfortable in who Aaron
[2:04:59] Oglesby is, but I got to constantly be
[2:05:01] saying, "Where can I lay more of myself
[2:05:02] down? Where can I let him shine through
[2:05:05] me more? Where is an area where I'm
[2:05:08] blocking the light from shining out
[2:05:10] because this flesh is in the way? Where
[2:05:13] is somewhere that I can improve and let
[2:05:15] the grace and mercy and love of God
[2:05:18] shine through my life to a dying world
[2:05:20] better than I do now?
[2:05:22] Change me, Lord. Let me get better.
[2:05:25] Quit. I I don't want to be satisfied
[2:05:28] with where I'm standing at tonight.
[2:05:31] We spend way too much time reflecting on
[2:05:34] others lives.
[2:05:36] And I want you to understand this
[2:05:37] tonight. I'm not saying you're not in a
[2:05:39] good place. This isn't to condemn you
[2:05:42] for any failure. This is to say, let's
[2:05:45] just press on to all that God has for
[2:05:47] us. Don't limit what you can be in God.
[2:05:51] Don't limit in what you can be the more
[2:05:53] you surrender to him. Let the word work
[2:05:56] in every aspect of my life. Yes, you're
[2:05:58] saved. Yes, called. Yes, chosen. But
[2:06:01] now, let's take the power of the blood
[2:06:03] and let it work in our life to its full
[2:06:06] potential.
[2:06:08] That we can be everything that he wanted
[2:06:09] us to be. And I'm not telling you to
[2:06:12] wallow in your failures. I don't believe
[2:06:14] in that. But don't ignore them. Face
[2:06:16] them. And by God's grace, tonight, let's
[2:06:19] rise above those.
[2:06:20] Prophet said, "For God is with us. Then
[2:06:23] who can be against us? The great morning
[2:06:25] star is over us. The banner of Christ.
[2:06:28] We're bound to conquer. We're bound to
[2:06:32] conquer. But we got to be willing to
[2:06:34] fight. It's time to overcome the thing
[2:06:36] that's been hindering you your entire
[2:06:38] life. That crutch that you've been
[2:06:40] holding on to. That's one people don't
[2:06:42] like to talk about.
[2:06:45] Sometimes people don't even realize that
[2:06:46] they've been crutching it their whole
[2:06:48] life is what I like to say.
[2:06:50] You hear so many different I I was
[2:06:52] raised so poor and I've got a I've got a
[2:06:55] bad past and my parents they didn't love
[2:06:58] me. I didn't have parents
[2:07:02] suffered horrible tragedy and I have
[2:07:04] emotional scars from my childhood. I
[2:07:06] come from a broken home.
[2:07:11] Serious things. And I'm not making light
[2:07:14] of any of those. I come from a broken
[2:07:15] home. I know the pain of that.
[2:07:19] They're real and they're hurtful. But
[2:07:22] too many people choose to live in that
[2:07:24] hurt.
[2:07:27] They choose to read the same page of
[2:07:29] their story over and over and over and
[2:07:35] over.
[2:07:37] They choose to live right there and they
[2:07:38] point back to that hurt and they point
[2:07:40] back to that excuse. You weren't called
[2:07:42] for that thing to conquer you. You were
[2:07:44] called to conquer it. You were called to
[2:07:46] be a testimony. You don't understand
[2:07:49] what I went through and the things I
[2:07:51] like to tell this story. There were two
[2:07:52] brothers. One was the CEO of a Fortune
[2:07:54] 500 company and one was a homeless man
[2:07:56] under a bridge. They were twins. The
[2:07:59] homeless man under the bridge was an
[2:08:00] alcoholic.
[2:08:02] And they came and interviewed him and
[2:08:03] they asked him, "Why are you this way?
[2:08:05] What led you to this point?" And they
[2:08:07] both gave the same answer. I watched my
[2:08:10] dad.
[2:08:14] One of them followed in his footsteps.
[2:08:18] One of them rejected that and said,
[2:08:19] "That's not going to be what defines me.
[2:08:22] I'm going to be a cycle breaker." You
[2:08:24] have a choice in your life. I'm not
[2:08:28] saying those things don't have an
[2:08:29] effect. But what I'm saying is there's
[2:08:30] more to your story. The word tells us
[2:08:33] he's the author
[2:08:35] and the finisher.
[2:08:37] But many of us have a horrible failure,
[2:08:39] a horrible tragedy, a horrible place in
[2:08:40] our life, a place of real pain, or a
[2:08:42] place where we really messed up. And
[2:08:44] we're stuck on chapter three. And we're
[2:08:46] stuck right there. And all I'm trying to
[2:08:48] tell you tonight is the author has
[2:08:50] written the rest of your story. There's
[2:08:52] more chapters in the book. This chapter
[2:08:54] doesn't define you. Your failure doesn't
[2:08:57] define you. That depression doesn't
[2:08:58] define you. That attack doesn't define
[2:09:01] you. Let's turn the page tonight. Let's
[2:09:03] realize that there's grace on the next
[2:09:04] page. There's mercy on the next page.
[2:09:07] There's victory on the next page.
[2:09:08] There's chapter after chapter to come of
[2:09:11] God's mercy and God's grace. And at the
[2:09:13] back of the book, you are the victor.
[2:09:16] You are the winner. But if you stay on
[2:09:18] that same page, you're going to stay in
[2:09:21] defeat.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; But you're not called to defeat. You're
[2:09:25] called to conquer. And I'm saying, let
[2:09:27] something rise up in you tonight that
[2:09:28] says, I'm going to turn the page
[2:09:30] tonight. I'm not talking about a new
[2:09:32] leaf. I'm talking about I'm going to
[2:09:34] walk in what God has predestinated me to
[2:09:36] walk in. I'm going to progress into all
[2:09:39] that God has called me to be. And I'm
[2:09:41] not going to let my life be stuck in
[2:09:43] this place of defeat, in this place of
[2:09:45] hurt, in this place of tragedy. But I'm
[2:09:47] moving on in the goodness of God. It's a
[2:09:50] kadish moment.
[2:09:53] It's time to cast down those things and
[2:09:55] move on.
[2:09:57] You can progress.
[2:10:00] You can take more. You've been called
[2:10:03] out to conquer tonight.
[2:10:06] Listen,
[2:10:08] the struggles of the flesh, and I'm I'm
[2:10:10] just going to bring this down to a
[2:10:11] close.
[2:10:13] The struggles of the flesh
[2:10:16] are a result of the fall.
[2:10:18] Temper, fear, complexes, pride, whatever
[2:10:21] you want to place there, the fruits of
[2:10:23] the curse.
[2:10:25] But you've been called to overcome that
[2:10:27] curse by the power of the Holy Ghost.
[2:10:30] Jesus crushed that curse. And then he
[2:10:33] sent back that same life to live in you
[2:10:35] so that you can crush it, too. Cursed
[2:10:38] flesh. That's what this is. Cursed flesh
[2:10:43] being defeated every single day by the
[2:10:46] power of the Holy Ghost on the inside of
[2:10:48] you. But I got to tell you, you have to
[2:10:51] start turning down the lie of the enemy.
[2:10:54] You've got to start turning it down when
[2:10:56] he says that your failures define you.
[2:10:59] Turn it down when he says your sins
[2:11:00] define you. Turn it down when he says
[2:11:02] this is just how you are. Because in
[2:11:04] order to accept the promise, you have to
[2:11:06] turn down the lie. Turn it down when he
[2:11:09] says you're not good enough. Turn it
[2:11:11] down when he says you're never going to
[2:11:12] make it. Turn it down when he points to
[2:11:14] family traits. Turn down complexes. Turn
[2:11:17] down fears. turn down your own flesh and
[2:11:20] crucify it tonight because there's
[2:11:23] something on the inside of you that's
[2:11:25] made to believe. Something on the inside
[2:11:27] of you is made to persevere and and to
[2:11:30] cast Satan down. But in order to do so,
[2:11:32] you got to cast down the lie. Prophet of
[2:11:34] God told us that Eve had to deny God's
[2:11:37] word before she could accept the lie. So
[2:11:40] in accepting one, there has to be a
[2:11:41] casting down of the other.
[2:11:44] Oh church, if we would hold on to the
[2:11:45] promises as tight as we hold on to our
[2:11:47] complexes.
[2:11:50] If we would hold on to the promises as
[2:11:51] tight as we hold on to those grudges
[2:11:53] that we have against people,
[2:11:56] the things we won't forgive our parents
[2:11:58] of. If we would hold on to the promises
[2:11:59] instead of holding on to those things so
[2:12:01] tight. But you got to cast it down
[2:12:03] tonight in order to grab hold of the
[2:12:05] promises. You got to move away from that
[2:12:08] place you've been camped at for so long.
[2:12:10] It's not good enough. I'm thank God you
[2:12:12] came out. I thank God for what he's done
[2:12:14] in your life. But we got to progress
[2:12:15] tonight. We got to go further with God
[2:12:18] tonight. We got to be willing to say,
[2:12:19] "Lord, I surrender it all. I lay it all
[2:12:21] down and I'm not going to pick it up
[2:12:23] tonight cuz I'm called out to conquer.
[2:12:26] I'm called to be an overcomer. I'm not
[2:12:28] called to be beat down by lies and fears
[2:12:30] and complexes and what the enemy says."
[2:12:32] The enemy has no say in who you are. The
[2:12:35] enemy doesn't get to name you. Nobody
[2:12:37] else got to name my children. He can't
[2:12:40] come in and say complex and fear and
[2:12:43] suicide. It's no right. I will not
[2:12:45] respond to those things. That's not what
[2:12:47] defines me. I am a child of God. I am an
[2:12:49] overcomer. I'm not going to fall in the
[2:12:51] wilderness. I'm not going to die by the
[2:12:53] wayside. I am called to conquer in this
[2:12:56] day. Hallelujah. Let your bitterness go
[2:12:59] tonight. Let forgiveness flow out of
[2:13:02] your life tonight. You can't carry those
[2:13:04] things around and overcome at the same
[2:13:06] time. Let the word change your thinking
[2:13:11] to a positive thinking. How do we
[2:13:13] overcome him? By the blood of the lamb
[2:13:14] and the word of our testimony. Let it be
[2:13:18] a positive testimony of the goodness of
[2:13:20] God. Yeah. Look, faith may acknowledge
[2:13:23] the trial, but it doesn't acknowledge it
[2:13:25] in fear. It acknowledges the way David
[2:13:27] acknowledged Goliath. Who is this? Who
[2:13:30] are you, great mountain? I want to ask
[2:13:33] that thing in your life that says it's
[2:13:35] going to destroy you, that's not going
[2:13:36] to let you progress, that's going to
[2:13:37] keep you in this same place. Who are
[2:13:39] you, great mountain, that you shall not
[2:13:41] bow? God's calling on a people in this
[2:13:44] day who aren't afraid to stand and take
[2:13:46] the word upon their lips. He says you'll
[2:13:48] never be ashamed. What's that mean?
[2:13:51] What's that mean? He'll back up what you
[2:13:52] speak. He'll back up if you claim your
[2:13:54] healing. He'll back it up when you claim
[2:13:56] your loved ones. He'll back it up when
[2:13:58] you claim the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[2:14:00] He's not going to leave you holding the
[2:14:01] bag, ashamed in some situation. He says,
[2:14:04] "My people shall never be ashamed.
[2:14:07] Forget not all his benefits tonight. Go
[2:14:09] into the valley and face your giant."
[2:14:12] You're called for it.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; Called to more than coming out, called
[2:14:17] to conquer.
[2:14:18] Nay, in all these things, we are more
[2:14:20] than conquerors through him that loved
[2:14:24] us.
[2:14:27] As we close this out, I want to look
[2:14:28] back
[2:14:29] at Caleb there in Numbers
[2:14:33] after he steals the people and he says,
[2:14:34] "Let's go take the land." The gripers
[2:14:37] and the skeptics and the pessim folks,
[2:14:40] they bring up an evil report and they
[2:14:43] cap it off with this.
[2:14:46] They say, "And there we saw the giants,
[2:14:48] the sons of Anoch,
[2:14:52] which come of the giants, and we were in
[2:14:55] their own sight as grasshoppers. And so
[2:14:58] we were in their sight. Now, I want you
[2:15:02] to watch the Lord's attitude
[2:15:06] towards Caleb's confession and towards
[2:15:07] their confession. Here's what they said.
[2:15:10] But we know what Caleb said. Let's go up
[2:15:11] and take it. We're more than able. And
[2:15:13] watch the Lord's uh attitude towards
[2:15:15] these confessions. Surely they shall not
[2:15:19] see the land which I swear unto their
[2:15:20] fathers. Neither shall any of them that
[2:15:23] provoked me see it. But my servant
[2:15:26] Caleb,
[2:15:28] because he had another spirit with him,
[2:15:31] and hath followed me fully, him will I
[2:15:33] bring into the land whereinto he went,
[2:15:36] and his seed shall possess it. Let me
[2:15:39] ask you a question. In that moment, had
[2:15:42] Caleb conquered those giants?
[2:15:47] Let's bring it down to your situation.
[2:15:48] In that moment, were you healed? Were
[2:15:51] you delivered right there? Was it
[2:15:53] manifested yet? Maybe I should ask it
[2:15:54] that way.
[2:15:56] No,
[2:15:58] he just testified what the word said.
[2:16:01] That's all he did. And they were
[2:16:04] unwilling to testify what the word said.
[2:16:07] And because of his testimony, the Lord
[2:16:09] confirms it to him. You're going to have
[2:16:10] exactly what I promised you because you
[2:16:13] were willing to stand and say what the
[2:16:16] word says.
[2:16:19] But what I want to watch now is the
[2:16:20] manifestation
[2:16:22] of his positive confession. In Judges,
[2:16:25] it begins to talk about the failure to
[2:16:27] complete the conquest. Still people not
[2:16:29] possessing. Still people failing to
[2:16:31] conquer. It says Benjamin did not drive
[2:16:33] out the Jebusites and neither did
[2:16:35] Manasseh. Neither did Ephraim. Neither
[2:16:37] did Zebulon. But let's see what it says
[2:16:40] about Caleb. And they gave Hebron unto
[2:16:44] Caleb, as Moses said, and he expelled
[2:16:49] thence the three sons of Anoch. What?
[2:16:54] What's so special about this? The first
[2:16:57] thing he did is what they said couldn't
[2:16:59] be done. They said, "We can't take it
[2:17:02] because the sons of Anoch are there. We
[2:17:04] can't do it." And in this day, there's
[2:17:06] many people rising up saying, "The
[2:17:08] world's too evil. There can't be a
[2:17:10] bride. There can't be one take a
[2:17:11] rapture. But I got a word that says I
[2:17:14] will have a bride without spot and
[2:17:16] without wrinkle. And I don't care what
[2:17:18] the others are saying. There's a people
[2:17:20] saying I'm just going to testify what
[2:17:22] the word said. I'm just going to say
[2:17:24] what the word said. If he said he'll
[2:17:26] have a church without spot or wrinkle, I
[2:17:28] say give me my mountain. I say I'm part
[2:17:31] of that. And the Lord comes back and
[2:17:32] confirms and says because of this you
[2:17:35] will have what I promised you. And I say
[2:17:38] like Caleb, why don't we do what they
[2:17:40] said can't be done? I say we're going to
[2:17:42] take a rapture. We're going to take a
[2:17:44] body change. We're gonna overcome in
[2:17:46] this day. We're going to live above sin.
[2:17:48] Why? Because you're special? No. Because
[2:17:51] the word said we could have it. The word
[2:17:54] said we could take a rapture. The word
[2:17:56] said we could live above sin. Oh, was
[2:17:59] Caleb something special? No. He just
[2:18:01] took God at his word. He probably had
[2:18:03] complexes like everybody else. He had
[2:18:06] problems like everybody else, but he
[2:18:08] trusted what the word said and he put
[2:18:10] the word in action and it manifested in
[2:18:12] a victory. You want to see victory in
[2:18:14] your home? Put the word in action. Put
[2:18:17] the word in action tonight. They said,
[2:18:20] "We're going back to Egypt." Caleb said,
[2:18:21] "I ain't going nowhere. I'm going to
[2:18:23] have my mountain." Because he had a word
[2:18:25] and he had a promise. Give me my
[2:18:29] mountain.
[2:18:31] Church, you're called to more than just
[2:18:33] coming out. You're called to be a Caleb.
[2:18:36] You're called to possession. It's not
[2:18:38] about what family you're from tonight.
[2:18:41] It's not about your past failures
[2:18:43] tonight. It's not about your abilities
[2:18:45] or your inabilities or your liabilities.
[2:18:48] It's about him working through you
[2:18:52] &gt;&gt; to conquer the land. Brother Aaron, I
[2:18:55] have problems. Yeah, I I got a lot of
[2:18:57] them. I got failures.
[2:19:01] I got problems. But he said, "I'll go
[2:19:03] before you.
[2:19:06] I'll endure you from p with power from
[2:19:08] on high. I'll have a church."
[2:19:11] I say, "We got to start conquering every
[2:19:14] excuse that stands in our way. Release
[2:19:17] the word in our situation and watch
[2:19:19] mountains move because we are mountain
[2:19:21] movers."
[2:19:23] Prophet God says it like this. Let's go
[2:19:24] forward. How many is that your prayer
[2:19:26] tonight? Will you stand together with
[2:19:27] me? Stand together with me while we read
[2:19:29] this quote. He said, "Let's just go
[2:19:31] forward following the steps of our great
[2:19:34] leader and conquer it."
[2:19:39] Remember God told Joshua, "Every place
[2:19:41] the souls of your footsteps, that's
[2:19:43] possession, brother." Then footsteps
[2:19:45] means possession. Let's just keep
[2:19:47] walking into the promised land, not
[2:19:49] looking back to see what had happened
[2:19:51] back there and what somebody else is
[2:19:53] doing. Keep your eyes on Jesus, the
[2:19:56] Joshua, the leader. Just keep moving on.
[2:19:58] deeper depths, higher heights until you
[2:20:00] possess everything that God promised you
[2:20:03] in his word. What are you preaching
[2:20:05] about tonight, Brother Aaron? I'm
[2:20:07] preaching that there's more for me
[2:20:08] tonight. There's a deeper relationship
[2:20:10] for me tonight. And I just want to ask
[2:20:12] you tonight as we start this weekend of
[2:20:14] meetings, how many be willing to say,
[2:20:15] "Lord, I realize there's more for me. I
[2:20:18] want everything you have for me, Lord.
[2:20:20] Every place, Lord God, where I've
[2:20:21] hindered because I wouldn't surrender.
[2:20:23] every place, Lord. Lord, as we bow our
[2:20:25] heads for it before you right now, Lord,
[2:20:27] humbly. And we recognize we're full of
[2:20:29] failures. We're for full of carnality,
[2:20:32] Lord. There's so many things in our
[2:20:33] life, but Lord, as a people, we
[2:20:35] surrender those things tonight, Lord. We
[2:20:37] want to conquer the land, Lord. I want
[2:20:38] to start right here in me, Lord. It's
[2:20:40] not my job to conquer everybody else's
[2:20:43] problems, Lord. But Lord, let me be a
[2:20:45] better father, a better Christian, a
[2:20:47] better husband, Lord. I want to lay down
[2:20:49] everything and allow that token to work
[2:20:51] in my life, Father. Lord, allow the Holy
[2:20:54] Spirit, Lord, don't let me hinder it.
[2:20:55] Lord, don't let me limit it. But
[2:20:57] tonight, Lord, I want to do away with
[2:20:59] every excuse, Lord. Every complex, every
[2:21:01] place, Lord God, where I worry about
[2:21:03] what other people think instead of what
[2:21:05] you think, Lord, I want to press into
[2:21:07] the land. Lord, I don't want to limit
[2:21:09] you, but I want to say even now, Lord
[2:21:11] Jesus, all things are possible. Lord, we
[2:21:14] commit this service into your hands. We
[2:21:16] commit this night into your hands. We
[2:21:18] commit this people into your hands.
[2:21:19] Lord, as we go forward, Lord, may we
[2:21:21] possess the land and conquer in Jesus
[2:21:24] name we pray and commit it all to you.
[2:21:26] Amen. And amen. Hallelujah. God bless
[2:21:30] you, church. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; Sing that song, Healer.
[2:21:47] you know that uh that service didn't go
[2:21:49] the way I thought it was going to go.
[2:21:53] I loved how he started with uh
[2:21:56] we're called to conquer
[2:21:58] and we got a long list of things
[2:22:02] that are in the way.
[2:22:05] And it's so easy to look externally, but
[2:22:07] he took it right down to the first
[2:22:09] victory that we need is over this guy,
[2:22:14] the man, the woman, the child of God
[2:22:15] that we are.
[2:22:19] You know, we we look at this song.
[2:22:23] We talk about healer.
[2:22:26] You know, when I sing this, I think of
[2:22:28] Sister Priscilla
[2:22:31] cuz we're all looking for her healing.
[2:22:34] But you know what? There's things that
[2:22:37] I'm dealing with and that you're dealing
[2:22:38] with
[2:22:41] that need a healing
[2:22:44] more than she needs her arthritis to go
[2:22:46] away.
[2:22:48] The things that we've held on to for so
[2:22:49] long, the the excuses we've made for so
[2:22:52] long, the hurts, the disappointments,
[2:22:55] the shadows, the secrecy, hypocrisy,
[2:22:59] attitudes,
[2:23:01] smart alec thoughts that need a really
[2:23:03] strong filter
[2:23:05] identified with him there.
[2:23:13] He's a healer. Yes,
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; it's an inward work
[2:23:20] that dying daily that the new creation
[2:23:23] can live.
[2:23:26] Old things have passed away.
[2:23:29] Amen.
[2:23:31] We've got to say, Lord, I need a healing
[2:23:33] tonight.
[2:23:35] Lord, I need a healing tonight.
[2:23:40] [Music]
[2:23:42] I don't imagine there's many lives
[2:23:43] weren't touched tonight by what he was
[2:23:45] saying if we're honest with ourselves.
[2:23:50] Stuck on chapter 3.
[2:23:52] God, you've led me all the way and now
[2:23:55] all of a sudden I'm not moving anymore.
[2:23:57] What happened?
[2:24:00] Stuck on yesterday's victory,
[2:24:02] yesterday's experience,
[2:24:06] yesterday's disappointment.
[2:24:10] yesterday's fault and failure.
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; But he didn't write the book based on
[2:24:16] our strength.
[2:24:19] &gt;&gt; He wrote it based on his word,
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; his will, and the spirit that he gives
[2:24:25] to take us all the way through. Amen.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; So, we're going to sing this song
[2:24:29] tonight. I'm not going to repreach a
[2:24:32] sermon,
[2:24:33] but I want you to look into your life
[2:24:34] and you say, "Lord, I need a healing."
[2:24:37] where you need a healing
[2:24:41] and say, "Lord, I'm here to lay that
[2:24:44] down.
[2:24:45] I'm here to take the stripes, the ve the
[2:24:49] the the blessing of the stripes that you
[2:24:51] bore for me.
[2:24:54] I'm here for deliverance.
[2:24:57] I'm here to lay down
[2:25:00] what I inherited
[2:25:03] from mommy, from daddy, grandparents,
[2:25:06] whoever it might be.
[2:25:08] I'm here to take what my father offers
[2:25:10] me.
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's just sing this together
[2:25:13] tonight.
[2:25:17] You hold my every
[2:25:21] moment.
[2:25:22] [Music]
[2:25:24] You calm my raing
[2:25:28] sea.
[2:25:31] You walk with me through fire
[2:25:38] and you heal all my
[2:25:42] disease.
[2:25:45] I trust
[2:25:47] in
[2:25:49] you.
[2:25:51] And Lord, I trust
[2:25:54] in
[2:25:56] you.
[2:26:00] I believe that you're my healer.
[2:26:07] I believe
[2:26:09] you are all I need.
[2:26:16] I believe.
[2:26:20] I believe
[2:26:23] you're my portion.

[2:26:46] moment.
[2:26:50] You calm the raing
[2:26:53] sea.
[2:26:56] You water with me through fire
[2:27:03] and you heal all my
[2:27:07] disease.
[2:27:10] I trust
[2:27:12] in
[2:27:14] you,
[2:27:17] Lord. I trust
[2:27:19] in
[2:27:21] you.

[2:29:45] set
[2:29:46] free.

[2:34:10] You are more
[2:34:13] than enough
[2:34:18] for me.
[2:34:21] Change my heart, oh God.
[2:34:25] Change my heart, oh God.
[2:34:33] Make it ever
[2:34:35] true.
[2:34:40] Change my heart, oh God.
[2:34:47] May I be like you.
[2:34:54] You are the water.
[2:35:01] I am the clay.
[2:35:08] Mold me and make
[2:35:13] me.
[2:35:15] This is what I pray.
[2:35:20] [Music]
[2:35:22] Change my heart, oh God.
[2:35:29] Make it ever
[2:35:32] true.
[2:35:36] Change my heart, oh God.
[2:35:42] God, may I be like you. Sing it all
[2:35:46] over.
[2:35:50] So change my heart, oh God,
[2:35:57] make it ever
[2:35:59] true.
[2:36:11] May I be like you.
[2:36:17] You are the father.
[2:36:21] [Music]
[2:36:24] I am the way
[2:36:31] for me and make
[2:36:35] me.
[2:36:38] This is what I pray.
[2:36:42] [Music]
[2:36:45] Change my heart, oh God.
[2:36:52] Make it ever true.
[2:36:59] Change my heart, oh God.
[2:37:06] May I be like you.
[2:37:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And as we close, we're going to
[2:37:12] sing that song, Goodness of God.
[2:37:15] Amen. I thought that was wonderful.
[2:37:21] If the negative parts are right,
[2:37:24] means the positive parts are right, too.
[2:37:27] Amen. Sometimes we stop reading a little
[2:37:29] too early.
[2:37:31] Sometimes we don't read at all.
[2:37:35] Amen. But I believe each one of us here
[2:37:37] tonight can testify the goodness of God.
[2:37:40] You know, he was saying, "Satan said
[2:37:42] you're not going to make it." Satan said
[2:37:45] you're not going to be healed. Satan
[2:37:46] said you're not going to break free.
[2:37:48] Satan said you're going to stay in that
[2:37:49] cycle, but we're still here and we're
[2:37:53] still fighting. See, when he promised
[2:37:55] victory, he didn't say it was an easy
[2:37:57] victory, but he said there was going to
[2:37:59] be victory. I'll tell you one thing. If
[2:38:01] we knew we were going to win every time,
[2:38:03] we'd fight a little differently.
[2:38:05] And that's what I heard tonight is
[2:38:06] you're going to win. You're going to win
[2:38:08] the war.
[2:38:10] We lose the battles from time to time,
[2:38:12] but you're going to win the war. He's
[2:38:14] already written it. He's already
[2:38:15] declared it, and he's here to make sure
[2:38:17] it happens. Amen. So, before we close
[2:38:20] tonight, I want to sing this song. Let's
[2:38:22] worship him. Let's praise him for what
[2:38:24] he's done. Cuz what he's done shows what
[2:38:26] he's going to do. The work he started is
[2:38:29] the work he's going to finish. Amen. And
[2:38:32] so, these little trials, these little
[2:38:34] things, they'll seem so small. They're
[2:38:37] so big today, aren't they? But when we
[2:38:39] get over there, it'll be the smallest of
[2:38:42] things.
[2:38:44] And we'll say it was worth it all. I'm
[2:38:46] glad I kept walking, putting that one
[2:38:48] foot in front of the other. Amen. We're
[2:38:50] going to sing this. Brother Bash, I'm
[2:38:52] going to have you close in prayer if you
[2:38:53] would after we've sung this. Amen. Keep
[2:38:56] each one in prayer. Remember brother
[2:38:57] Chad. Remember brother Aaron. Three
[2:38:59] services, three days is tough on any
[2:39:01] preacher. Amen. Let's pray that the Lord
[2:39:03] would just restore his strength. keep
[2:39:05] his voice in good form and we can come
[2:39:07] back tomorrow for the the breakfast I
[2:39:09] think at 10:30 and then the service is
[2:39:12] at 5:30 tomorrow night. Amen. God bless
[2:39:15] you. Let's sing this as we close
[2:39:17] tonight.
[2:39:19] I love you Lord
[2:39:24] for your mercy never fails me.
[2:39:30] And all my days
[2:39:33] I've been held in your hands.
[2:39:38] From the moment that I wake up
[2:39:42] until I lay my head. Oh, I will sing of
[2:39:49] the goodness
[2:39:51] of God.
[2:39:56] And all my life you have been faithful.
[2:40:02] [Music]
[2:40:04] And all my life you have been so so
[2:40:10] good.
[2:40:12] With every breath that I am aable.
[2:40:18] Oh, I will sing of the goodness
[2:40:23] of God.
[2:40:26] I love your voice
[2:40:31] for you have led me through the fire
[2:40:36] in darkest night.
[2:40:39] You are close like no other.
[2:40:44] I've known you as a father.
[2:40:48] I've known you as a friend.
[2:40:52] And I have lived in the goodness
[2:40:57] of God.
[2:41:02] And all my life you have been faithful.
[2:41:10] And all my life you have been so so
[2:41:16] good.
[2:41:19] With every breath that I am able.
[2:41:24] Oh, I could sing of the goodness
[2:41:29] of God.
[2:41:32] I love you, Lord.
[2:41:37] For your mercy never fails me.
[2:41:43] In darkest night,
[2:41:46] you are close like no other.
[2:41:51] I've known you as a father.
[2:41:55] I've known you as a friend
[2:41:59] and I have lived in the goodness
[2:42:04] of God.
[2:42:09] And all my life you have been faithful.
[2:42:17] And all my life you have been so so
[2:42:22] good.
[2:42:25] With every breath that I am able.
[2:42:31] Oh, I will sing of the goodness
[2:42:36] of God. One more time.
[2:42:41] And all my life you have been faithful.
[2:42:49] And all my life you have been so so
[2:42:54] good.
[2:42:57] With every breath that I am able.
[2:43:02] Oh, I will sing of the good things.
