[18:46] another service once again asking you
[18:48] Lord that that you would just come by
[18:51] this way Lord and may your presence just
[18:53] fill this place. Pray Lord that as we
[18:56] worship you Lord that you just help us
[18:58] to set aside the cares of this world
[19:01] things that would distract us Lord and
[19:03] take our attention from you Lord and may
[19:05] we just be able to relax in your
[19:06] presence Father
[19:09] asking Lord that you just please forgive
[19:10] us Father of anything that we have done
[19:12] to grieve you this day Lord may you be
[19:15] quick to repent Father

[19:20] musicians the song leader Lord and that
[19:22] the congregation as we sing glory and
[19:23] praises to you Lord
[19:25] May he just be a welcoming spirit,
[19:28] Father, that just comes flowing through.
[19:30] Grace to brother John as he ministers.
[19:32] Lord, you know what we have need of,
[19:34] Father. May you just speak to our
[19:36] hearts, Lord. There's many prayer
[19:38] requests, Father, that were mentioned,
[19:41] Lord. We're asking that you just reach
[19:42] down and touch each one, Father, with a
[19:44] a special touch, Lord. anything from a a
[19:48] touch of saving grace, Father, to a
[19:49] physical touch, financial, whatever the
[19:52] case may be, Father. May your perfect
[19:54] will be done in each one of their lives,
[19:56] Father. Grace to those that couldn't
[19:58] make it, Father. May you just bless them
[20:00] richly, Lord, in some some way, Father.
[20:02] I know their hearts desires to be here,
[20:04] Lord. And pray that your grace just be
[20:06] upon them. Be with us now, Father, as we
[20:09] just settle in for the service, Father.
[20:11] May we not look at time, Father, but may
[20:13] our focus be beyond eternity. Jesus
[20:16] Christ name I pray. Amen.

[20:25] Listen to 543. Oh, I want to see him.
[20:32] [Music]
[20:40] [Music]
[20:46] As I journey through the land, singing
[20:51] as I go,
[20:54] pointing souls to Calvary
[20:59] to that crimson flow.
[21:03] Many arrows pierce my soul from
[21:08] withoutin.
[21:11] Oh, but my Lord leads me on. Through him
[21:17] I must win.
[21:21] Oh, I want to see him. Look upon his
[21:27] face.
[21:29] Let us sing forever
[21:32] [Music]
[21:34] of his saving grace
[21:38] on the streets of glory.
[21:42] Let me lift my voice.
[21:47] Cares all pass. Home at last,
[21:51] ever to rejoice
[21:54] [Applause]
[21:56] when in service for my Lord. Dark may be
[22:02] the night,
[22:03] [Applause]
[22:04] but I cling more close to him. He will
[22:10] give me light.
[22:14] Satan stares may vex my soul.
[22:18] Turn my thoughts aside man.
[22:22] But my Lord, he goes ahead,
[22:27] leads whatever be.
[22:31] Oh, I want to see him.
[22:36] Look upon his face.
[22:40] Let us sing forever
[22:45] of his saving grace
[22:49] on the streets of glory.
[22:54] Let me lift my voice.
[22:57] Oh cares all pass home at last
[23:03] ever to rejoice.
[23:07] When in valley low I look toward the
[23:12] mountain high mountain
[23:16] and behold my savior there bleeding in
[23:22] the valley
[23:25] with a tender hand out stretch for the
[23:30] valley below.
[23:33] He's guiding me and I can see
[23:38] as I onward go. Thank you, Lord. Oh, I
[23:43] want to see him.
[23:47] Look upon his face.
[23:51] Let us sing forever
[23:56] of his saving grace
[23:59] [Applause]
[24:00] on the streets of glory.
[24:05] Let me lift my voice.
[24:09] His cares all pass. Home at last
[24:14] ever to rejoice.
[24:18] And before me pillows rise from the
[24:24] mighty king. I thank you Lord.
[24:28] Lord directs my bark. He does safely
[24:33] keep
[24:36] and he leads me gently on
[24:41] this world below.
[24:44] And he's a real
[24:47] friend to me.
[24:49] Oh, I love him so
[24:54] and oh I want to see him
[24:58] look upon his face.
[25:03] Let us sing forever
[25:08] of his saving grace
[25:12] on the streets of glory.
[25:16] Let me lift my voice.
[25:20] His cares all past
[25:25] ever to rejoice.
[25:30] And in valleys though I look
[25:34] toward the mountain high
[25:39] and behold my savior there he's leading
[25:44] in the fight
[25:47] with a tender hand outstretched
[25:52] for the valley low.
[25:56] He's guiding me and I can't see
[26:01] as I onward go
[26:04] and oh I want to see him look upon his
[26:11] face
[26:14] there to sing forever
[26:18] of his saving grace
[26:23] on the streets of glory. Glory.
[26:27] Let them lift my voice.
[26:31] His cares all pass. Oh my last
[26:36] ever to rejoice.
[26:39] [Applause]
[26:41] When before me pillows rise
[26:45] from the mighty deed.
[26:48] [Applause]
[26:49] Then my Lord directs my bark.
[26:54] He does safely keep
[26:58] and he leads me gently on to this world
[27:04] below.
[27:07] Oh, he's the real friend to me.
[27:12] Oh, I love him so much. And oh I want to
[27:18] see him to look upon his face.
[27:25] Let us sing forever
[27:29] of his saving grace
[27:34] on the streets of glory.
[27:38] Let me lift my voice.
[27:42] His cares all past
[27:47] ever to rejoice.
[27:52] Amen.

[29:53] I am one of the few. Yes, I'm one of the
[29:58] few. And by faith in God's word, I can
[30:03] claim it.
[30:06] Though the way may seem long and the
[30:10] opposition strong for the bride there's
[30:15] a way.
[30:19] If I plan to go through just a hope will
[30:25] not you
[30:27] must be fully decided
[30:33] to follow the Lord. I oy
[30:38] his word and believe that I'm one of the
[30:43] few heavens. Yes, I'm one of the few.
[30:49] Yes, I'm one of the few. And by faith in
[30:55] God's word, I can claim it.
[31:00] Though the way may seem long and the
[31:04] opposition strong, for the bride,
[31:08] there's a way
[31:10] proided.
[31:13] If I plan to go through just suppose it
[31:18] will not do
[31:20] I must be fully decided
[31:27] to follow the Lord by obeying
[31:32] his word and believe that I'm one of the
[31:44] Let's sing uh number 40. Let's stand. I
[31:47] just want to please the Lord
[31:54] [Music]
[31:58] and I just want to please
[32:02] the Lord.
[32:08] need his will in every way.
[32:15] To be lost in his presence,
[32:20] found in his likeness.
[32:23] To hear him say, "Well done, someday."
[32:31] Oh, I just want to please
[32:35] the Lord.
[32:40] Be in his will in every way.
[32:47] To be lost in his presence,
[32:52] found in his likeness.
[32:55] To hear him say, "Well done someday."
[32:59] Sing it again.
[33:01] Oh, I just want to please God bless you.

[33:30] someday. Sing it one more time.
[33:34] Oh, I just want to please
[33:38] the Lord.
[33:42] Be in his will in every way.
[33:49] To be lost in his presence.
[33:54] Found in his likeness.
[33:57] to hear him say, "Well done
[34:01] someday."
[34:04] Amen. Lord, that's our sincere prayer,
[34:06] Lord, this evening.
[34:09] Lord, we want people to see Christ alive
[34:11] and well, Lord. We want people to see
[34:13] you when they look at us. Lord, that our
[34:16] lives could be so lost, so hidden in
[34:18] you. Lord, our words, our actions, our
[34:21] quietness, our response, our reactions,
[34:23] Lord, that all of it would speak to a
[34:25] power that's greater than what we were
[34:27] born with. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[34:29] want your word to have your way in our
[34:30] lives, Lord. We want it to change us. We
[34:32] want it to wash us, Lord. We want to
[34:34] fill us, Lord. We want it to be engraved
[34:36] in our souls, Lord, in our hearts, Lord,
[34:38] that when we make a move, when we say a
[34:40] word, Lord, it springs, Lord, from that
[34:42] fountain of life inside of us, each one.
[34:45] Lord, we're thankful. We're called here
[34:47] tonight. We're thankful, Lord. We're in
[34:48] your presence under the hearing of your
[34:50] word, heavenly father. And we're asking
[34:52] you once again to take it and shape us
[34:54] and mold us, Lord. Make us more in your
[34:56] image, Lord, this evening we pray. Lord,
[34:58] it's our heart's desire that we reflect
[35:00] you inside and out. Lord, bless your
[35:03] people, Lord. Hear the prayer requests
[35:05] that have been mentioned. Lord, we pray
[35:06] your mercy and grace to each one. In
[35:08] Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen. And
[35:12] may God bless you. Turn if you would to
[35:13] Hebrews chapter 13. very familiar
[35:16] opening set of scriptures here this
[35:18] evening. May God bless you. Good to see
[35:20] each one here today. Um I'm disappointed
[35:24] to be here today
[35:27] because we weren't supposed to be here.
[35:28] We were supposed to be having special
[35:29] meetings. Somebody else was supposed to
[35:31] preach this week. I was supposed to get
[35:32] a break, but uh you know, I was talking
[35:34] to brother Aaron on on Monday and and he
[35:38] said, "Hey, you know, we're going to
[35:39] have to shut this down. They they're
[35:41] just not able to get me through." So I
[35:42] said, "That's fine." And I said,
[35:44] "Listen, we've done everything we can.
[35:46] We did everything we could. We prayed.
[35:48] We we planned. We we prepared. We did
[35:50] everything." I said, "So for a child of
[35:52] God, when things don't work out, we just
[35:53] say, 'Lord, thy will be done, and that's
[35:56] it. But you have to listen to me tonight
[35:57] instead of brother Aaron on this
[35:59] weekend." But he was disappointed. I I'd
[36:01] um been saving. He really likes the um
[36:04] the kettle chips, the sweet and or the
[36:07] spicy ketchup ones. And I bought four
[36:08] bags ready for him downstairs in the
[36:11] suite. So that when he came in, him and
[36:12] Sister Lydia, the first thing they saw
[36:14] were his favorite chips. And so I sent
[36:16] him a picture and I said, "The expiry
[36:18] date is September 9th. You're not going
[36:20] to make it." I said, "I'm going to have
[36:22] to eat them." And he said, "I was
[36:24] already in the depths of despair and
[36:26] then you told me that." I said, "We may
[36:28] keep one just to see if they still hold
[36:29] past that due date, but I'm going to
[36:31] have to eat the rest. It's not worth the
[36:32] risk to leave them." But he is very,
[36:34] very keen still to come up and minister
[36:36] for us. It's a I think it's it's a
[36:39] wonderful time in the Lord and they
[36:40] appreciate it and we enjoy it. So just
[36:42] keep them in prayer. Amen. We still by
[36:44] God's grace will have brother Barry the
[36:46] first week of September. I don't know if
[36:47] he'll minister. I've asked him to take
[36:49] as many services as he would. Um he'll
[36:51] let me know on that. I'll be away the
[36:53] last week of September and the first
[36:55] week of October. So we'll have hopefully
[36:57] brother Carmen Mills for one and then
[36:59] one minister probably from out west in
[37:01] Canada. Younger minister and evangelist
[37:03] probably like we had brother Max last
[37:05] year. It won't be brother Max as far as
[37:07] I know, but uh we'll have that. So,
[37:08] we'll still have some ministers coming
[37:10] through and then we've rebooked the
[37:11] services for October 17th through 19th
[37:13] with brother Aaron. So, uh we still got
[37:16] plenty of meetings coming up. Let's just
[37:17] hold fast, keep pressing and in the
[37:19] meantime, we should have some variety
[37:21] coming in the next month or so as well.
[37:23] Amen. God bless you. I certainly
[37:25] appreciate all the work brother Paul and
[37:26] Sister Kimberly put into preparing for a
[37:28] camp we didn't have, but we'll be ready
[37:30] to go next year. That's for sure. We're
[37:33] ready to roll. So, uh, we've kind of
[37:34] ironed out some wrinkles in that. So, I
[37:36] think it'll be even better next year by
[37:38] God's grace. Amen. Hebrews 13 and 7 says
[37:41] this, "Remember them which have the rule
[37:43] over you, who have spoken unto you the
[37:46] word of God, whose faith follow
[37:48] considering the end of their
[37:50] conversation, Jesus Christ, the same
[37:52] yesterday, today, and today, and
[37:56] forever." Amen. God bless you. You can
[37:57] have your seats. This evening, we're
[37:59] continuing this thought. We're of course
[38:01] speaking on the Holy Ghost, but I want
[38:02] to take a third service on this thought
[38:04] of the mystery finished. And I I have to
[38:07] say this is the most enjoyable portion
[38:09] of this series. I think it's such a
[38:11] beautiful thing when we can see things
[38:12] from God's eternal perspective. How we
[38:14] were in his thoughts, how we were in his
[38:16] mind, how we were in his purpose, how
[38:18] we're in his plan. And it just ought to
[38:19] give us a settled feeling. Amen. When
[38:21] you know that God before you ever
[38:23] stepped foot on this earth had a plan
[38:25] and a purpose for you, and it included
[38:26] him. Amen. You and him. It's a wonderful
[38:29] thing for us to to do and it ought to
[38:31] just settle us down. I don't mean to
[38:32] stop pressing, stop making right
[38:35] decisions, stop living, right? That's
[38:36] not what it means to be settled, but to
[38:38] be at rest with what happens in your
[38:40] life, no matter what happens. Amen.
[38:42] We've got to keep making the right
[38:43] decisions. We've got to keep reading our
[38:44] Bibles. We've got to keep praying. We've
[38:46] got to keep pressing the battle. Amen.
[38:48] But as we press, we trust that he's
[38:50] already cleared a way for us to make it
[38:52] through to the other side into full
[38:54] adoption and full redemption. Amen. So,
[38:57] we're continuing this thought on this
[38:58] mystery that's been hidden through all
[39:00] the ages and generations as Paul said,
[39:03] and we've been preaching on this the
[39:04] last two services, but we're getting
[39:06] more into the depths of this, the
[39:07] details now, and we're we're preaching
[39:09] on the purpose of the Holy Ghost in our
[39:11] life. And we're kind of coming to the
[39:12] sharp tip of the spear now where things,
[39:14] the rubber really meets the road in this
[39:16] age. And we preached so much on previous
[39:18] ages and previous examples because they
[39:20] were types and they were shadows and
[39:22] they were pointing to this time and this
[39:24] season. Amen. They were pointing to the
[39:25] first church age and then that church
[39:27] age was pointing to the last church age
[39:29] which is this time now. Amen. And so I
[39:31] want to preach to us now. I don't want
[39:33] to preach to people that were in the
[39:35] past or people that aren't with us. But
[39:36] I want to preach to us in the season
[39:38] that we're at. Amen. And the experiences
[39:40] that we're supposed to see in our lives
[39:42] as we come down to the final culmination
[39:44] of this age. And Jesus would say this. I
[39:47] want to take his words as we set
[39:48] ourselves a foundation again tonight. He
[39:51] said in John 14, "Verily, verily, I say
[39:54] unto you, he that believeth on me, the
[39:56] works that I do shall he do also, and
[40:00] greater works than these shall he do."
[40:03] Not not not uh higher works or better
[40:05] works or more amazing or more
[40:07] supernatural, but they do more. Why? He
[40:10] says, "Because I go unto my father. My
[40:12] ministry in this form is cut short right
[40:14] now, but there's going to be a
[40:16] continuation. My works are going to
[40:18] continue even though I'm going to the
[40:20] Father. He says, "And whatsoever you
[40:22] shall ask in my name, that will I do,
[40:25] that the Father may be glorified in the
[40:27] Son."
[40:29] How is the Son glorified if you're the
[40:30] one doing the asking?
[40:34] How is the Son glorified if he has
[40:35] nothing to do with it? Well, the answer
[40:37] is he has everything to do with it.
[40:39] We've just got to keep reading. He says,
[40:42] "If you shall ask anything in my name, I
[40:44] will do it." This isn't the focus of the
[40:46] service, but that's about the most
[40:47] beautiful thing I think you can read in
[40:48] the scripture is when you ask God within
[40:51] the context of what this whole scripture
[40:52] is talking about, he'll do it. That when
[40:56] you when you come to the depths of the
[40:57] reality of the revelation of this
[40:59] scripture, when you ask something in
[41:01] Jesus name, it's going to happen. Amen.
[41:04] Now, watch this. He says, "If you love
[41:06] me, keep my commandments."
[41:10] That's not what we see much of today.
[41:13] That's not much of what we see today. If
[41:14] you love me, keep my commandments.
[41:16] They're doing away with the commandments
[41:17] so they can say they love him is what
[41:19] what's really happening. He says, "And I
[41:21] will pray the father and he will give
[41:22] you another comforter that he may abide
[41:25] with you forever, even the spirit of
[41:27] truth whom the world cannot receive
[41:30] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[41:32] him." In other words, they don't
[41:33] recognize him now and they're not going
[41:35] to know him next. If you don't recognize
[41:38] him now, you're not going to recognize
[41:39] him in the future because he'll be
[41:41] identified by the same attributes. He'll
[41:43] be identified by the same works, the
[41:45] same actions, the same attitude. It'll
[41:47] be one and the same. So, if you can't
[41:48] accept Jesus Christ in the flesh 2,000
[41:50] years ago, you're not going to accept
[41:52] him today. You weren't going to accept
[41:53] him on the day of Pentecost. You weren't
[41:55] going to accept him in the ministry of
[41:56] the disciples and those different
[41:58] things. He says, "But you're different."
[42:00] He says, "But ye know him, for he
[42:02] dwelleth with you and shall be in you."
[42:04] Amen. Emanuel has to go from God with us
[42:06] to God in us. That's what has to happen
[42:09] here. He says, "I will not leave you
[42:11] comfortless. I will come to you." Amen.
[42:15] Personal pronoun, not a third person of
[42:17] the Godhead. I Amen. Christ returning
[42:20] back. He says, "Now a little while and
[42:23] the world seeth me no more, but you see
[42:25] me. Because I live, you shall live
[42:28] also." Notice it is his resurrection
[42:31] that's going to bring life to the
[42:32] believer. He says, "Because I live," you
[42:36] know, he died, but he rose again. He
[42:38] never really lost life. It was a
[42:39] temporary thing. But there was a spirit
[42:41] that raised him up from the dead that
[42:43] could not die. And that spirit came back
[42:45] on us. But if it couldn't raise him out
[42:48] of the grave, it can't raise us out of
[42:50] our sin and our our flesh tonight. Amen.
[42:52] It's because it works on him that it
[42:54] works on us. He's the proof that it
[42:56] would work on us. Amen. He had to be
[42:58] alive to come back and dwell inside of
[43:00] us. And because he lives, we live today.
[43:03] Amen. Otherwise, we'd be stuck. We'd be
[43:05] dead in our sinful flesh. And he says,
[43:07] "Now at that day you shall know that I
[43:09] am in my father and you in me and I in
[43:12] you." This is the unity restored. Now
[43:14] this is the marriage covenant. This is
[43:16] full redemption as we're seeing it in
[43:18] the scriptures. It's the end goal of of
[43:20] of why the Holy Ghost is given to us is
[43:22] to restore us back to our original
[43:25] condition, our original relationship,
[43:27] our original authority. But in this
[43:30] life, there's something that has to be
[43:31] restored first, and that is headship.
[43:35] With headship will come relationship.
[43:37] And with relationship will come
[43:39] authority. But if you don't have that
[43:40] headship and that relationship first,
[43:42] you take authority and you'll turn into
[43:43] something satanic. You'll destroy your
[43:45] own self and everybody else. You got to
[43:47] come to him in a relationship to accept
[43:50] his headship before you can come into
[43:52] the position of authority of the
[43:53] believer. We'll come into that later in
[43:55] another service, Lord willing. He says,
[43:58] "He that has my commandments." Let me
[44:00] say it this way. He that has my word.
[44:03] His word is his commandments. Amen. He
[44:05] that has my word. He that has my
[44:07] commandments and keepeth them. Amen.
[44:09] We've got to be doers, not just hearers.
[44:11] He it is that loveth me. So the one that
[44:14] has it and the one that does it, that's
[44:17] the one that loves him. He says, "And he
[44:19] that loveth me shall be loved of my
[44:21] father, and I will love him and will
[44:23] manifest myself to him." Amen. And I
[44:25] want to look at that last verse cuz this
[44:27] is what ties the knot. It ties
[44:29] everything that we've read in John 14
[44:31] here together into one cohesive things.
[44:34] We can read all the verses before 21 and
[44:37] we can play we can make it into a
[44:38] picture where we say what we want and
[44:40] God gives it to us. We turn them into a
[44:42] doing grandfather rather than a loving
[44:45] husband.
[44:47] We take headship completely out of it
[44:49] and we turn it into I'm going to get
[44:51] what I want for Christmas and for my
[44:52] birthday and every single day of my
[44:54] life. Amen. We just say what we want.
[44:56] God runs around doing it. But Jesus sets
[44:58] some checks here. And he says, "Listen,
[45:00] if you have my commandments, if you have
[45:03] my word, that's the first check box. Do
[45:05] you have his word? If you don't have his
[45:07] word, none of this applies. You've got
[45:10] to be found in his word." Amen. We've
[45:12] read the scripture so many times that
[45:13] the scripture says that sons of God are
[45:16] led by the spirit of God. But here we
[45:18] see that the spirit of God will lead you
[45:20] to his commandments. It will lead you to
[45:24] his word. Amen. We see a lot of claims
[45:26] about people being led by the Holy
[45:27] Spirit. But what we don't always see is
[45:30] the word foundation that supports the
[45:32] Holy Ghost leadership in their life. All
[45:35] we've got is I feel led to do it and
[45:38] then they do it. Amen. But the reason is
[45:41] that those pe the reason that that
[45:43] happens is because those people are led
[45:44] astray by their own desires. Amen. And
[45:47] not willingly surrendering themselves to
[45:49] the commandments of God, which is his
[45:51] word. Amen. The Holy Spirit, our prophet
[45:53] said, will always confirm his word.
[45:56] He'll always lead you to his word. The
[45:59] question is, will we wait long enough
[46:01] for him to lead us?
[46:03] Will we wait long long enough for him to
[46:05] show us? Will we'll be patient enough
[46:07] for him to lay it out clearly enough in
[46:09] the word? Amen. If it's not confirmed in
[46:12] the word, we better move so carefully,
[46:13] church. So carefully.
[46:16] Because we can be so sincere in our
[46:19] desire to be right. But sincerity
[46:22] doesn't make us right. Sincerity doesn't
[46:25] do away with personal preferences.
[46:27] Sincerity doesn't do away with emotions.
[46:29] Sincerity doesn't move do away with with
[46:32] fleshly experiences. Amen. Sincerity
[46:34] doesn't change what this body wants. It
[46:37] just means that you've got an
[46:38] intellectual expression of wanting to be
[46:40] right. But that doesn't make it right. A
[46:43] desire to be right does not mean that
[46:45] whatever you desire is right.
[46:50] David desired to build a house for God.
[46:53] Sincere good out of the will of God.
[46:58] A desire to be right does not make it
[47:00] automatically right. Whatever we choose.
[47:02] Amen. The hardest thing to hear as a
[47:04] sincere person or to tell a sincere
[47:06] person is you're wrong. Because there's
[47:08] no intent to be wrong. And we think
[47:10] because we don't intend to be wrong, we
[47:12] won't be wrong. No, you've got to wait
[47:14] on God. You got to let him show you by
[47:17] his word because that's what his spirit
[47:19] does is lead you back to his word. And
[47:22] that's when you know that your sincerity
[47:23] has been met with his will. I love what
[47:25] the prophet said. Remember he said the
[47:27] Holy Ghost will tell the truth on you.
[47:29] And if your sincere desire is to be
[47:32] right and he shows you the word, then
[47:33] you'll line up with that word. But if
[47:35] your sincere desire is to be proved
[47:37] right, that's not going to work out so
[47:39] well. If you really want to be right,
[47:41] you'll let him lead you to truth. That's
[47:43] what the spirit of truth does. It leads
[47:45] you to that. Amen. And we've all
[47:47] experienced it. I've been in churches
[47:49] where a preacher's preaching and what do
[47:50] they do? It's like he smacks you upside
[47:52] the face because you thought you were
[47:54] moving in the right direction and then
[47:55] the word comes forth by the spirit and
[47:58] all of a sudden it stops you in your
[48:00] tracks and you say, "Whoa,
[48:02] I hadn't thought about it that way. I
[48:05] hadn't considered that." And then it's
[48:07] in your lap and now you've got to make a
[48:08] decision, don't you? Do I play on my
[48:11] sincerity or do I yield to the word?
[48:15] Do I yield to the word or do I go back
[48:17] to the fact that my intentions were
[48:19] good? Therefore, I can just go ahead and
[48:20] do what's right. Amen. Once that word's
[48:23] in our laps, we have to decide. And
[48:25] there's a reason why preachers to this
[48:27] in the nominal Christian world today
[48:28] aren't preaching the straightness of the
[48:30] word. It's because they don't want
[48:32] people to make a decision. They don't
[48:34] want people to have to bend or yield or
[48:36] humble themselves to the word. Amen.
[48:38] Here's the thing. Telling people
[48:40] straight doesn't bring members in. It
[48:42] doesn't bring money in. doesn't build
[48:44] big ministries. And yet 95% of what you
[48:47] read, especially in the Old Testament,
[48:48] is correction. Cuz that's what God sends
[48:51] to his people. His love is corrective.
[48:53] He's trying to get us to live a life
[48:55] that's pleasing to him. And so most of
[48:57] what comes out of a pulpit is supposed
[48:58] to be corrective. Meaning, it's teaching
[49:00] you what's right.
[49:03] Not disciplining you. It's teaching you
[49:05] what's right. It's corrective. It's
[49:06] showing you what God wants. Amen. But
[49:08] it's amazing what the the preaching of
[49:10] the word has become in the nominal word.
[49:13] But I'm not here to preach about them.
[49:14] I'm here to preach to you. Amen. But
[49:16] we've got to see what's going on around
[49:17] us because that's a fulfillment of
[49:19] scripture. To see how watered down this
[49:21] word has become to where they call what
[49:24] it says wrong and what they say right.
[49:26] That's where it's come. But my question
[49:28] is, are we doing the same thing in our
[49:30] lives?
[49:32] Amen. Are we hearing and doing or are we
[49:34] just hearing?
[49:36] It's really easy to say amen.
[49:40] It's very different to become the amen
[49:43] because amen means doesn't mean I agree.
[49:46] Amen means so be it in me. I don't say
[49:50] amen for brother Bob. I've got to say
[49:52] amen for me. So as the word comes forth
[49:54] when I say amen, that's me saying Lord I
[49:56] surrender to your word. Lord I'm laying
[49:59] down my life, my feelings, my sincerity,
[50:01] my desires to your word. That's what
[50:04] amen means. Amen means I'll take it and
[50:07] nothing else. That's what God's looking
[50:10] for. Amen.
[50:11] Otherwise, what happens?
[50:14] We'll do most of what God wants us to
[50:16] do.
[50:18] Isn't that what Abraham did? Abraham did
[50:21] most of what God wanted us wanted him to
[50:23] do. But you know what? He never got what
[50:26] God promised until he did everything God
[50:28] wanted him to do. But the thing is, we
[50:30] do most of what God wants us to do and
[50:32] then we want God to do everything that
[50:34] he said he was going to do. I speak by
[50:36] experience, church.
[50:39] 90% obedience is not obedience. It's
[50:42] still disobedience. But we look at the
[50:44] 90% and we say, "Look, Lord, I look at
[50:46] what I'm doing." He says, "But you still
[50:47] haven't obeyed. You've just sort of
[50:49] obeyed."
[50:51] Amen.
[50:53] Once he shows us the truth, that's when
[50:55] we're held accountable for it. I'm not
[50:58] saying we have to live perfect lives. My
[50:59] wife and I have been discussing some of
[51:01] these things just based on some
[51:02] preaching we've been hearing lately in
[51:04] these different things is that we can
[51:05] look around and we can see that some of
[51:07] us are doing things that others of us
[51:08] aren't. And it's not because one's right
[51:11] and one's wrong. It's because some of us
[51:13] are under God's focus in different areas
[51:15] of our lives. There are things that you
[51:17] can maybe get away with that I'm not
[51:19] allowed to as a preacher.
[51:21] And there may be things I'm allowed to
[51:22] get away with because I'm a preacher
[51:24] that you're not. I can't think of any,
[51:25] but I'm sure there's something. But the
[51:27] simple fact is you've got weaknesses and
[51:29] you've got strengths and you've got a
[51:31] purpose in this life and I do too. So
[51:33] God works in our life. Amen. We're not
[51:35] born mature believers. We're born as
[51:36] babes in Christ. And God knowing all
[51:38] things to come in our life, he's
[51:40] preparing us to do what he needs us to
[51:42] do. And so there's things in our life
[51:44] that he will leave alone for a while
[51:47] because they're not critical for the
[51:48] stage that we're in. But as we grow and
[51:50] mature, these things start to fall away
[51:52] because other things have to fill us up.
[51:54] He's got to make room for what he has
[51:56] for us. And so things start to drop off.
[51:58] I used to I used to read a couple of
[52:01] books a week. Now I'm lucky if I get a
[52:04] book or two a year. Why? It's not wrong
[52:08] to read books. It's that I've got other
[52:09] things to do with my time now. I've got
[52:12] more time in his service and less time
[52:13] in my service. And so things have to
[52:16] drop off in these different things. So
[52:18] it's different for us. But once he shows
[52:19] us his truth, once he shows us his will,
[52:22] once he shows us his way, then he
[52:24] expects us to do it.
[52:26] Amen. When I look at my my son sitting
[52:28] here tonight, there are things that I
[52:30] expect of my oldest that I don't expect
[52:32] of my youngest. The youngest one can do
[52:35] it and it's not wrong. It's not right,
[52:37] but I'm not holding him accountable yet.
[52:39] But the oldest one, I'm holding
[52:40] accountable because he's mature. And
[52:42] that's the same thing that God does with
[52:44] us. Amen. But it's, as I said last
[52:46] service, if you got the spirit of God,
[52:47] there's one thing that's going to
[52:48] happen, and that's that you're going to
[52:50] change. You're going to grow. You're
[52:52] going to mature. and you're going to
[52:53] grow closer to Christ, the word, and
[52:55] you're going to go further and further
[52:56] away from the world and the things of
[52:57] the world. Absolutely. If that's not
[52:59] happening, church, we're backsliding or
[53:02] we've never been brought to life in the
[53:03] first place. Amen. Something's gone
[53:05] wrong somewhere. Listen to this. He
[53:07] says, Brother Brandham says, "Let me be
[53:09] a brother. Let me live the example of
[53:12] what Christ said a man should be. Let me
[53:14] be a brother to a brother, a brother to
[53:16] a sister. Let me be a minister to the
[53:19] ministers. Let me be an example of
[53:21] examples. Let me show to the world that
[53:24] this word is Christ. The only way he
[53:27] says I can do it is to come into him
[53:29] because I can't do it myself and you
[53:32] can't do it. But let the word and you
[53:34] become one. He says then it lives itself
[53:37] out. You're a walking epistle of Jesus
[53:40] Christ when he's got complete and total
[53:42] control of you to make every word.
[53:45] That's what we're talking about. He
[53:46] says, "Now if he comes this way, I want
[53:48] to do this." and you say, "No, no, I
[53:51] don't believe that." He says, "See,
[53:53] you're not in the word." See, you can't
[53:55] say what what Jesus said that Christ is
[53:57] in me and I'm in Christ and then deny
[53:59] the word either by word or deed. You see
[54:02] the test? If you won't accept the word,
[54:04] you can't have Christ.
[54:06] They're one and the same. You can't
[54:07] separate it. It's not those who say
[54:09] amen. It's those that become the amen.
[54:12] That's what he's looking for. Amen.
[54:13] Those that take it and eat it and become
[54:16] one with it as they're hearing and
[54:17] reading the word. He says, "See now
[54:20] watch full obedience to the whole word
[54:24] of God entitles us to the token." He
[54:27] says, "Then when we pray, we must have
[54:30] the token to present with our prayer."
[54:32] Amen. Why? Because sons of God are led
[54:34] by the spirit of God. If you got the
[54:36] token of the Holy Spirit, you can come
[54:38] before God and you'll ask and get what
[54:40] you want. Why? Because you're asking
[54:42] according to the spirit inside of you
[54:45] rather than yourself. Amen. Otherwise,
[54:48] you're asking of your own desires. And
[54:49] remember what James said. He says, "When
[54:50] we ask of our own desires, we ask a
[54:52] miss." Every time we'll ask a miss
[54:55] because this flesh will lead us astray.
[54:58] So, let me ask a question. Are we
[55:01] seeking God to fulfill his word
[55:05] and haven't received it?
[55:08] Are we seeking a promise from him, but
[55:10] we haven't got it? Are we seeking
[55:11] healing, but we haven't been healed? Are
[55:13] we seeking direction, but we haven't
[55:14] been directed? Amen.
[55:17] Notice what he talks about here. Full
[55:19] obedience to the word is what God
[55:21] requires. So what I do, this is me
[55:24] speaking now. When I'm looking for
[55:26] something and I'm not getting it, you
[55:28] know what I do? I take a step back.
[55:31] I take a step back and I say, "Lord, is
[55:34] there something you require of me that
[55:36] I'm not giving you?"
[55:39] Because sometimes what's holding him up
[55:40] is me. It's not the situation. His word
[55:44] is his word. The promise is his promise.
[55:46] But sometimes there's something in me
[55:48] that he's trying to do. And my lack of
[55:50] full obedience, my partial obedience,
[55:54] which is really disobedience, is what's
[55:56] holding him back. If I won't do what he
[55:59] says, why should he do what he says?
[56:03] See that? See, see what we do is we
[56:05] think, well, well, God understands, so
[56:07] I'm going to hold him to his word. But
[56:08] he's saying, what about my word that
[56:10] I've asked you to do? What about my
[56:12] plan? What about my purpose? What about
[56:13] the steps I've asked you to take? Amen.
[56:16] Remember Hannah, we spoke of her last
[56:18] service and she was claiming a promise
[56:20] of God. She was claiming a child because
[56:22] God said, "If you'll follow my
[56:24] commandments, I'll bless the wombs of
[56:26] the of the women of Israel." And she was
[56:28] a real believer. She was a sincere
[56:31] believing woman. She lived a sanctified
[56:33] life. Amen. She was doing what God told
[56:36] her. And Hannah was entitled to God's
[56:38] promise.
[56:40] Amen.
[56:42] There's nothing that said why Hannah
[56:43] couldn't have the promise. But what was
[56:45] Hannah's problem? Hannah's problem was
[56:48] that she could only see for herself.
[56:51] She wanted to take away the rebuke. She
[56:53] wanted to take away the reproach. She
[56:55] wanted to take away the the the the the
[56:58] persecution of the the wife, the other
[57:01] wife of her husband. And Hannah was all
[57:04] about me me.
[57:06] But when she finally stepped back and
[57:09] she said, "Maybe there's something that
[57:11] God wants out of me before I get
[57:14] something out of God." Now, God could do
[57:16] something. Because she stepped back and
[57:18] she said, "God,
[57:20] I'm going to give my blessing back to
[57:22] you." In other words, Lord, my blessing
[57:26] won't be for me. My blessing will be
[57:28] back to you. And when she did that, God
[57:31] came down and God gave her a son. Why?
[57:34] because her motive and her objective
[57:36] needed to be straightened out a little
[57:38] bit. You think, well, I'm suffering. I'm
[57:40] in hardship. I'm in pain. This is a an
[57:43] annoyance. It's a daily battle that I
[57:45] have. Sometimes he's just looking for an
[57:48] attitude change. Amen. I speak by
[57:51] experience. Amen. Because our motives
[57:54] and our objectives can play havoc with
[57:56] the will of God. Amen. God's got bigger
[57:58] plans than anything we could ever desire
[58:00] for ourself. But sometimes God's waiting
[58:03] on us to clean our act up. Sometimes
[58:06] God's waiting us to show that we're
[58:08] Christians even when he doesn't answer
[58:09] in our time and in our way. Sometimes
[58:11] God's looking for a right attitude no
[58:13] matter what happens. I shared a picture
[58:16] with the deacons this morning about how
[58:17] my day went. I'm driving down the road
[58:19] and my right right front suspension on
[58:21] my car just broke.
[58:24] How do you feel about that, brother
[58:25] John? your car. I just spent $1,300
[58:28] repairing it and now I've got another
[58:30] two to three,000 to spend on it. How do
[58:32] you do it? How do you think about that?
[58:34] You know what I said? I told my wife, I
[58:36] said, "I've been reading the book of
[58:37] Job. I was prepared. The Lord gives and
[58:40] the Lord takes away. Blessed be the name
[58:42] of the Lord." Lord, I'm thankful I've
[58:43] had it as long as I had and I put as
[58:45] many miles as I did and it didn't break.
[58:48] Amen. I thank them for the enjoyment
[58:50] I've had in the meantime.
[58:53] Sometimes God's test is this. Brother
[58:55] Bam said this. He says, "God just wants
[58:57] to see how you'll react."
[59:02] God wants to see how you'll react. I
[59:04] went through six months of eye trouble,
[59:05] as you know.
[59:07] God's wanting you to see, are you going
[59:09] to stay faithful? Are you going to
[59:11] complain? Are you going to get annoyed?
[59:13] Are you going to keep preaching? Are you
[59:14] going to keep doing what you say you're
[59:16] going to do? Are you going to keep
[59:16] believing like you say you believe?
[59:19] Sometimes God's just training us. And
[59:22] it's a witness and a testimony to
[59:24] everybody else around us. Hey, they're a
[59:26] child of God. They can go through a
[59:28] trial and not lose their Christianity,
[59:30] not lose their faith, not lose their
[59:32] love, not lose their appreciation for
[59:34] God. Amen.
[59:36] Sometimes God's waiting for us to do
[59:38] what he told us to do before he tells us
[59:41] what he before he does what he promised
[59:43] he would do. Sometimes it's that full
[59:45] obedience. Sometimes it's repentance.
[59:47] Sometimes it's laying things down.
[59:50] Sometimes it's picking things up.
[59:52] Sometimes he's asking us to get our
[59:54] shoulder to the wheel. And you know
[59:55] what? We like our free time too much.
[59:58] Sometimes he's waiting for us to
[59:59] apologize.
[1:00:01] What's he doing, church? He's trying to
[1:00:03] get us spiritually healthy. First of
[1:00:05] all,
[1:00:06] Paul said, "I would that you would
[1:00:07] prosper, be or John, I think, said, "You
[1:00:09] would prosper and be in good health even
[1:00:11] as your soul does prosper." God's
[1:00:13] looking at our soul's health above all
[1:00:14] else. And when that's healthy, that's
[1:00:16] when he says, "Let's take care of the
[1:00:17] rest." and he meets our needs in those
[1:00:20] things. He's interested in our soul
[1:00:21] condition, in our character condition
[1:00:23] more than he's interested in our bank
[1:00:25] account or our health or our appearance
[1:00:27] or any of these different things. I've
[1:00:29] seen in my own life where a bad attitude
[1:00:31] kept God from moving. And he needed me
[1:00:34] to sit down and shut up and let him be
[1:00:37] God and let me be the little child of
[1:00:39] his. Literally, he needed me to just
[1:00:42] back off and stop having my opinions
[1:00:44] about things.
[1:00:47] Sometimes I need to get a right motive
[1:00:48] and a right objective.
[1:00:50] Sometimes I need to admit that I might
[1:00:52] have some changing to do.
[1:00:56] I'm being transparent here tonight.
[1:00:58] Okay?
[1:01:01] If I preach myself above you, I'm not
[1:01:04] going to do very well. I'm right there
[1:01:05] in the trenches with you. Amen.
[1:01:08] Sometimes God has shown me a clear
[1:01:10] direction. And you know me, if you know
[1:01:12] me well, I don't like to change
[1:01:13] directions. I like to stay in a groove
[1:01:16] because I do really well in a groove.
[1:01:19] You ask me to change a corner, that's
[1:01:21] not in my nature to do it. And sometimes
[1:01:23] God's waiting for me to turn the corner.
[1:01:25] And until I turn the corner,
[1:01:28] what else is there to talk about? God
[1:01:31] can't lead us further if we haven't done
[1:01:33] the last thing he told us to do.
[1:01:35] We He can't do it. There's nothing to
[1:01:37] talk about. God's saying, "Listen, if
[1:01:39] you got my word, if you got my will, if
[1:01:41] you got my plan, if you got my
[1:01:42] direction, and you don't do it, we don't
[1:01:45] have anything else to talk about, son.
[1:01:48] Until you do what I've told you to do,
[1:01:50] there's no moving forward." And you know
[1:01:52] what I found, church? If I won't move
[1:01:54] forward, you know what he does? He walks
[1:01:56] away and he turns out the light.
[1:02:01] Why? Because he's waiting for me to do
[1:02:04] my part.
[1:02:06] He can't do his part if I'm not willing
[1:02:08] to step into it until I can make a move
[1:02:11] in the direction. Amen. I I'm I'm I'm
[1:02:14] inspired this evening by Paul's writings
[1:02:16] where he said, "Wives, obey your
[1:02:18] husbands." And all the husbands said,
[1:02:21] "Amen."
[1:02:23] But the thing is, he never said, "Go and
[1:02:26] tell him why you didn't do what he said
[1:02:28] to do. Don't give your reasonings. Don't
[1:02:30] give your explaining." He says, "Just do
[1:02:32] what he said to do." And that's what
[1:02:34] God's asking us to do. He's asking for
[1:02:36] full obedience that we will trust that
[1:02:38] he sees what we don't see. He knows
[1:02:41] beyond what we know. And if we do it,
[1:02:43] there's something better waiting for us
[1:02:45] than what we had in our mind in the
[1:02:46] first place. That's what he asks us to
[1:02:49] do. It's a wife that can take his
[1:02:51] instruction without throwing her
[1:02:54] thoughts back at him.
[1:02:56] That's what God's looking for. A wife
[1:02:58] that can obey him. Amen. And that takes
[1:03:01] one thing, church.
[1:03:03] Humility.
[1:03:04] Humility. Remember, humility is power
[1:03:08] with God. Because when you step into his
[1:03:10] plan, into his word, into his road, into
[1:03:13] his way, he's not backing you up. Now,
[1:03:16] he's backing up the word that he put you
[1:03:17] into. It's not about personalities. Now,
[1:03:20] catch this.
[1:03:23] He says, "People are not ready to
[1:03:25] confess. They want to pray, God, you
[1:03:27] heal me. Do this or do that." He says,
[1:03:29] "But when it comes to dying out and
[1:03:31] confessing your sins and getting right
[1:03:33] with God," he says, "it isn't seen
[1:03:34] anymore." See, we want to get, but we
[1:03:36] don't want to lay down. We want him to
[1:03:38] do, but we don't want to do.
[1:03:41] We want to have what we have and what he
[1:03:43] has.
[1:03:45] We can't do it. We can't serve God and
[1:03:46] man at the same time. We can't have two
[1:03:48] masters. We can't be our own master and
[1:03:50] him be the Lord. It doesn't work that
[1:03:52] way. He says, "That's the reason we
[1:03:53] don't see any more healings than what we
[1:03:55] have. That's the reason I'm preaching
[1:03:57] these things." He says, "Let's get
[1:03:58] things ready for a healing service."
[1:04:00] You've got to get the thing working
[1:04:02] first. God heals you for his glory, and
[1:04:06] we must be ready for his glory. In other
[1:04:09] words, your life, your decisions, your
[1:04:12] attitude, your walk with him ought to
[1:04:14] reflect what you're asking him to do.
[1:04:17] Do you catch what I'm saying? If you're
[1:04:20] asking him to prove his word, then he
[1:04:23] ought to be able to say, "I'll prove my
[1:04:25] word because you are my word. Your life
[1:04:28] reflects my word, so I'm willing to
[1:04:30] glorify you with more of my word." But
[1:04:32] if we're sitting there bumbling along
[1:04:33] doing our own thing, and then we want
[1:04:34] God to do a big glorifying in our life
[1:04:36] through a miracle or a healing or a
[1:04:38] special deliverance or something like
[1:04:39] that, he's saying, "Why would I? You've
[1:04:42] got nothing to reflect me. This is all
[1:04:44] about you and I'm not in it." He's
[1:04:47] saying, "Let your life be a glory to God
[1:04:49] and then God will glorify you some more.
[1:04:52] Do the basics and then God will elevate
[1:04:55] you." Remember, you've got to be a base
[1:04:57] before he can exalt you. And that comes
[1:05:00] with humbling yourself to his will and
[1:05:02] to his word.
[1:05:04] What's he saying here? He's saying, if
[1:05:06] you want more of God,
[1:05:09] start living what God has already shown
[1:05:10] you.
[1:05:12] Take what he's given you before you ask
[1:05:14] him for more.
[1:05:16] See, we want to progress,
[1:05:19] but we've got to take what he's given us
[1:05:20] before we can progress. It's like I said
[1:05:22] last service when I asked people if they
[1:05:24] hadn't heard the the first service on
[1:05:26] this series, go back and listen to it
[1:05:27] because if you don't get the basics, you
[1:05:29] can't do the algebra. If you don't know
[1:05:31] how to add and subtract and multiply and
[1:05:33] divide, you can't do algebra. And then
[1:05:34] when we get to calculus, you're going to
[1:05:36] be completely lost. If you can't learn
[1:05:39] and take what he's given you right now,
[1:05:40] what's the point of moving on? We've got
[1:05:43] to have a life that reflects what he's
[1:05:45] shown to us. Amen.
[1:05:48] If you want what he has for you, say,
[1:05:49] 'Lord,
[1:05:50] examine my life.
[1:05:53] That's what David would say.
[1:05:57] He would say, "Examine me. Search me,
[1:05:59] Lord. Lord, let me see if I'm letting
[1:06:02] you down. Lord, let me see if I'm not
[1:06:04] going all the way. Lord, let me see if
[1:06:05] I've got partial obedience,
[1:06:09] disobedience in my life. Lord, have I
[1:06:12] taken everything you've given me so far?
[1:06:15] Or am I just wanting more without taking
[1:06:17] what you've already given?
[1:06:20] Again, I say by experience, church, I
[1:06:22] know when I'm a little off with God.
[1:06:25] Amen. Can you say amen to that? If
[1:06:27] you've ever got it where things just
[1:06:28] aren't right, there's something just not
[1:06:31] the same. Amen. We ought to know it. We
[1:06:33] ought to know the difference between a
[1:06:35] closeness with God and a formality with
[1:06:37] God because that's what it is. It turns
[1:06:38] into coldness, formality. It turns into
[1:06:41] habit rather than relationship.
[1:06:44] It turns into a marriage without
[1:06:46] relationship.
[1:06:48] You're still a child of God. You're just
[1:06:50] not close anymore.
[1:06:53] Amen. I speak by experience. I know when
[1:06:55] things are a little off. Amen. when I'm
[1:06:57] trying to push a decision off, when
[1:06:59] something's uncomfortable, when I'm
[1:07:01] sometimes it's out of uh uncertainty,
[1:07:03] sometimes in sincerity, we're still a
[1:07:05] little off cuz we're not sure if that's
[1:07:07] God's will because it's going to be
[1:07:08] painful or it's going to cause some
[1:07:10] awkwardness or it's a hard decision to
[1:07:12] make. Amen. But I think most of us would
[1:07:14] know by now what it means to feel close
[1:07:15] to God. And chances are we've had
[1:07:17] moments where we didn't feel close to
[1:07:19] God. And I would tell us normally when
[1:07:21] it comes those ways, it's because we
[1:07:22] backed away. We won't do what he tells
[1:07:25] us to do. We won't lay down what he
[1:07:27] tells us to lay down. Amen. God's not
[1:07:30] going to come down and prove his word in
[1:07:31] us just because we say we're a message
[1:07:33] believer. We go to a church. Amen. We're
[1:07:35] sitting under the preaching of his word.
[1:07:37] God's going to back up his word. And
[1:07:39] that's why it has to be in us. And we
[1:07:40] have to be walking in it day by day. And
[1:07:43] as soon as we walk into his word, we're
[1:07:45] automatically under his support.
[1:07:47] Automatically, it's there. Amen. That's
[1:07:48] where our victory is is in obeying the
[1:07:50] word. You obey the word, victory comes
[1:07:52] no matter what. It can't be stopped.
[1:07:55] Amen. But I want to say it this way as
[1:07:58] we turn a corner on this service
[1:08:00] tonight. We know what it means to serve
[1:08:02] God and see results from it, don't we?
[1:08:06] Now, listen. I may not have it all and
[1:08:08] you may not have it all, but guess what?
[1:08:09] We do have examples in here. We do have
[1:08:12] examples in here. We've got our elders
[1:08:14] and our former pastor and his wife and
[1:08:16] these things. We've got people that have
[1:08:18] shown us what it looks like to to be
[1:08:20] filled with the spirit, to be changed
[1:08:22] from what they were to something else,
[1:08:25] and to have it stick. We've got that.
[1:08:28] God bless you, brother Mark, Sister Mor,
[1:08:29] Sister Brenda, Brother Bob, Brother
[1:08:31] Gerald, and Sister Betty. You've shown
[1:08:34] us by example what it means to live a
[1:08:36] life by the spirit and to have results
[1:08:40] that stick. Amen. We can see it not just
[1:08:42] through men. We can see it through
[1:08:43] women. and our sisters have a witness
[1:08:45] just as the brothers do because it's the
[1:08:46] same Christ living in all of us. We can
[1:08:48] look around and we can see a life that
[1:08:50] represents Christ today. And I'm so glad
[1:08:53] we have it that encourages us that we're
[1:08:55] going to make it too by God's grace. But
[1:08:58] this is our opening scripture now. Paul
[1:09:00] says, "Now remember them which have the
[1:09:02] rule over you, who have spoken unto you
[1:09:04] the word of God, whose faith follow
[1:09:07] considering the end of their
[1:09:08] conversation." The Common English Bible
[1:09:11] says, "Remember your leaders who spoke
[1:09:12] God's word to you. Imitate their faith
[1:09:15] as you consider the way that their lives
[1:09:17] turned out. How does their lives turn
[1:09:20] out?" Hebrews 13:8, Jesus Christ, the
[1:09:24] same yesterday, today, and forever. This
[1:09:27] is Paul's testimony now to the Hebrews
[1:09:29] that are in Jerusalem. And this is an
[1:09:31] encouragement to them to live a life of
[1:09:34] faith. But what kind of faith? He says,
[1:09:36] "If you want to know what kind of faith,
[1:09:38] look around your local body and look at
[1:09:41] those that show the same things that
[1:09:43] Christ showed and imitate them."
[1:09:46] That's why we've got to have a whole
[1:09:47] range in our church. We've got people
[1:09:50] that show us the way so we can imitate
[1:09:53] not them, but their faith
[1:09:56] because their faith is the only thing
[1:09:58] that's the same amongst all of them.
[1:10:00] Sister Moren and Brother Mark have had
[1:10:01] to make different decisions than Brother
[1:10:03] Bob and Sister Brenda. And they've had
[1:10:04] to pay different prices. Brother Gerald
[1:10:07] has worn himself out in the service of
[1:10:09] the Lord. Paid a completely different
[1:10:10] price than any of us. But he's an
[1:10:12] example of a faithful servant. He's an
[1:10:15] example of Jesus Christ the same
[1:10:16] yesterday, today, and forever. And the
[1:10:18] other elders are. He says, "Look at them
[1:10:20] and imitate how and what they believe
[1:10:22] because you'll get the results if you
[1:10:24] have the same faith and is placed in the
[1:10:27] same thing.
[1:10:30] Why would I imitate somebody? The only
[1:10:33] time I imitate somebody is if I want
[1:10:34] what they have.
[1:10:38] So listen, if you don't want what Sister
[1:10:40] Moren has, don't do what Sister Moren
[1:10:43] did. But if you do, imitate her faith.
[1:10:47] Follow her faith. Believe as she
[1:10:49] believed. Paul says, "Look at the fruit
[1:10:51] of their lives. And the fruit of their
[1:10:52] lives is Jesus Christ. The same as he
[1:10:54] was yesterday, and it's the same today,
[1:10:56] and it's going to be the same tomorrow."
[1:10:57] There's a steadiness in the fruit that
[1:10:59] they're producing. Remember what Jesus
[1:11:01] says? He says, "I've ordained you that
[1:11:03] you would produce fruit and it should
[1:11:05] remain
[1:11:07] through the ups and the downs, through
[1:11:09] the the separation from family, through
[1:11:11] the financial hardships, through the
[1:11:13] sicknesses, through the heart attacks,
[1:11:14] through the dementia, whatever it might
[1:11:16] be, the fruit remains the same. Christ
[1:11:18] in you.
[1:11:20] It doesn't matter what happens. It
[1:11:22] doesn't matter how hard it is. It
[1:11:23] doesn't matter what people say. They
[1:11:25] stay steady with the word." Why? Because
[1:11:27] there's a faith that's ingrained in
[1:11:29] their soul that holds them to the
[1:11:31] eternal word of God. That's what's held
[1:11:33] them. They haven't held themselves. It's
[1:11:34] the faith of God inside of them that's
[1:11:36] held them and produced this in their
[1:11:37] lives. Amen. It's produced Christ all
[1:11:40] over again.
[1:11:42] Parents, grandparents, it pays. It pays
[1:11:46] to live a faithful life. It pays to
[1:11:50] commit yourself. It pays to be obedient
[1:11:53] to the word. instant in season out of
[1:11:56] season
[1:11:58] to just hold steady.
[1:12:00] There's a a benefit and it's not just to
[1:12:02] you it's to your children and it's to
[1:12:04] your grandchildren.
[1:12:08] You fit right into this scripture here.
[1:12:10] You elders, you grandparents, you
[1:12:12] parents. Brother Brown would say this.
[1:12:14] He was speaking of of the benefits of a
[1:12:17] faithful parent or a grandparent. He was
[1:12:19] talking about Levi paying tithe in
[1:12:21] Abraham. He got a benefit from Abraham's
[1:12:24] tithe pay and Levi never had to pay
[1:12:26] tithe his whole life.
[1:12:29] I wonder if that applies to me today. If
[1:12:32] the ministry No, just kidding.
[1:12:35] New doctrine. Strange fire.
[1:12:38] But you got to imagine Levi was feeling
[1:12:40] pretty good about it. He didn't have to
[1:12:42] pay the percentages and the percentages.
[1:12:43] In fact, they came to him. It's a
[1:12:46] wonderful thing to be a Levite. Catch
[1:12:48] this. Brother Ram says, "Live right.
[1:12:51] It'll do something to your children to
[1:12:53] follow you on and on. He says, "Keep
[1:12:56] living right, doing right, separating
[1:12:59] yourself from the things of the world,
[1:13:00] and live godly in this present world for
[1:13:03] Jesus Christ.
[1:13:07] There's a benefit."
[1:13:09] Remember what the scripture says. Says,
[1:13:11] "Train up a child in the way he should
[1:13:12] go, and when he is old, he'll not turn
[1:13:14] away from it." Sometimes it takes a
[1:13:16] while for it to get through to our hard
[1:13:17] heads, hard heads and our hard hearts,
[1:13:20] but it's still there because they've
[1:13:22] seen a faithful example of Jesus Christ
[1:13:24] living out in parents and grandparents.
[1:13:27] But you know, we look at this verse
[1:13:28] eight here, Jesus Christ the same
[1:13:29] yesterday, today and forever. It's one
[1:13:31] of the most common common scriptures
[1:13:33] quoted in the message I think you'll
[1:13:34] find. But the problem is is we look at
[1:13:37] that scripture as something separate
[1:13:39] from us rather than something revealed
[1:13:41] in us.
[1:13:42] We look at a, you know, I've always
[1:13:44] preached it and I I I'll continue to say
[1:13:46] it. I wish we'd preach Hebrews 7
[1:13:48] whenever we preach Hebrews 8 because we
[1:13:51] turn it into Jesus Christ the same
[1:13:52] yesterday, today, and forever. And it's
[1:13:54] just this ethereal thing where
[1:13:56] somebody's got to do it. But the idea is
[1:13:58] that not somebody's got to do it. It's
[1:14:00] that you've got to do it. I've got to do
[1:14:02] it. That were uh built into this
[1:14:04] scripture. Amen. The the point of
[1:14:06] Hebrews 13:8 is Christ in the believer.
[1:14:10] That's the point of it.
[1:14:12] It's not just in a prophet. It's not
[1:14:14] just in the ministry. It's Christ in the
[1:14:18] believer. Amen. Many years after Christ
[1:14:20] had said those words and gone on, Paul
[1:14:22] comes back to the first church age and
[1:14:24] he says, "You're doing exactly what he
[1:14:26] said you do." In John 14. You're the
[1:14:29] fulfillment of John 14. Christ in you,
[1:14:32] you in Christ. The works that you do, I
[1:14:34] do, you shall do also. He says you
[1:14:36] fulfilled it. It's right there. It's
[1:14:38] Jesus Christ. the same yesterday, today,
[1:14:40] and forever. And he was testifying to
[1:14:42] them, listen, you've got an example.
[1:14:43] Keep following the example. It works.
[1:14:46] Amen. The word works. They put fruit
[1:14:49] into their lives. And they haven't lost
[1:14:51] it. Through persecution, through people
[1:14:53] being thrown to the animals and thrown
[1:14:55] into the coliseum to be killed by
[1:14:57] soldiers and gladiators and torn apart
[1:14:59] and crucified, living in caves, meeting
[1:15:02] in tombs, all these different things.
[1:15:03] Nothing broke them. They held fast no
[1:15:06] matter what. I say, "Lord, help me to
[1:15:08] hold fast no matter what. Help us hold
[1:15:11] fast no matter what." He said, "It has
[1:15:13] to be one." He says, "Because the the
[1:15:16] hus a woman and her husband become one.
[1:15:19] They become one, and so does the bride
[1:15:21] and Christ become one." The ministry of
[1:15:23] the bride and the ministry of the Christ
[1:15:25] is the same. Remember what he said? I am
[1:15:27] the vine. You are the branches. Once
[1:15:29] you're connected to me, that's when
[1:15:30] you're going to start producing. Until
[1:15:33] you're connected to the vine, you're
[1:15:34] dead. But as soon as you're grafted in,
[1:15:36] then life comes forth and fruit will
[1:15:38] follow shortly afterwards. He called
[1:15:40] scripture. He says, "These former
[1:15:41] treaties, O Theophilles, have I wrote to
[1:15:43] you that Jesus began to do and continues
[1:15:47] to do." He says, "His death didn't stop
[1:15:50] him." No, sir. He returned again. Not a
[1:15:52] third person, but the same person
[1:15:54] returned again in the form of the Holy
[1:15:57] Ghost. And to continue the work on and
[1:15:59] continues on, said the book of Acts,
[1:16:01] Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today,
[1:16:03] and forever. That's the token. That's
[1:16:06] the sign, church. I praise God that we
[1:16:08] know that that's a reality today.
[1:16:11] We saw it. Amen. We had a lot of things
[1:16:13] happening in the nominal Christian world
[1:16:15] in this generation. But what we needed
[1:16:17] was a proof that Jesus Christ is the
[1:16:19] same yesterday, today, and forever. And
[1:16:22] you know what happened? God sent us that
[1:16:24] proof. He sent us a prophet. According
[1:16:26] to Malachi 4, after 2,000 years of
[1:16:29] theology without power, he sent us a
[1:16:32] Kentucky hillbilly that could barely
[1:16:34] write his name or read his Bible. And he
[1:16:36] sent him in the power of Jesus Christ.
[1:16:38] And what did he do, church? He showed us
[1:16:40] that Christ could heal. Christ could
[1:16:42] deliver. Christ could raise the dead.
[1:16:44] Christ could discern the thoughts and
[1:16:46] intents of the heart. He did every work
[1:16:48] that Christ did on this earth in terms
[1:16:50] of the supernatural.
[1:16:52] Why? To show us that Christ never died.
[1:16:55] to show that he was back in his bride to
[1:16:59] show us that nothing had to change in
[1:17:02] the word.
[1:17:03] Amen.
[1:17:06] He would say this. He says, "My ministry
[1:17:09] is a different ministry from a pastor or
[1:17:11] teacher." He says, "But this is my
[1:17:13] ministry." See, to declare him that he
[1:17:17] is here. And what did he do it? He did
[1:17:19] it by doing the exact same works that
[1:17:22] Christ did. And he did it by preaching
[1:17:24] the same gospel of Jesus Christ, the
[1:17:26] gospel of Paul that was given that will
[1:17:28] judge the earth. Amen. But it's so easy
[1:17:31] to take that statement and put it back
[1:17:33] into 1962 when he said it and put it in
[1:17:36] the ministry of a prophet. Amen. But
[1:17:38] remember that prophet's message, his
[1:17:40] very life was a sheath offering. It was
[1:17:42] a wave offering. It was a first fruit
[1:17:44] offering. What? To show what was
[1:17:47] supposed to follow. Not just in
[1:17:50] ministers.
[1:17:52] in a bride
[1:17:54] in the harvest when the life produces
[1:17:58] itself all over again. The corn of wheat
[1:18:00] that went down into the ground has come
[1:18:02] back and it is producing itself all over
[1:18:05] again. Amen. That the intent of this
[1:18:07] message was to do one thing. It was to
[1:18:09] give us the same faith and put us in the
[1:18:11] same condition that we had before the
[1:18:12] foundation of the world. It was a
[1:18:14] redeeming message. It was a restoring
[1:18:16] message. It was showing the effect of
[1:18:18] Paul's true ministry.
[1:18:21] It amazes me how they they've watered it
[1:18:23] down to where Paul's ministry has
[1:18:25] nothing to where people are even saying
[1:18:27] now that Paul never met Jesus and he has
[1:18:30] no authority in the scriptures. You
[1:18:32] basically have to throw away the New
[1:18:33] Testament if Paul has no authority.
[1:18:37] It's amazing.
[1:18:39] But what is it? This is a ministry. This
[1:18:41] is a message. It's Paul's message which
[1:18:43] takes us from our natural birth and it
[1:18:45] restores us back to our spiritual birth
[1:18:47] before we were ever born in this earth.
[1:18:49] Amen. It changes us. Paul would go to
[1:18:52] Athens, you read about in the book of
[1:18:53] Acts, and he would see these people that
[1:18:55] were steeped in idolatry and they were
[1:18:57] making idols and they had an idol and
[1:18:59] they had for just about every
[1:19:00] personality and every lifestyle and
[1:19:02] every desire you'd have, every walk of
[1:19:04] life. But then he walked by an altar
[1:19:06] that had that said to the unknown God.
[1:19:10] And Paul said, "I'm here to tell you
[1:19:11] about that one. That's the only one you
[1:19:13] got right because you don't know him."
[1:19:15] He said, "I'm here to tell you." He was
[1:19:17] a listening living testimony of that one
[1:19:19] God. They thought he was a God. When
[1:19:23] Paul did the miracles in front of them
[1:19:26] that he did, they thought he was God. He
[1:19:28] says, "No, I'm not God." But he would
[1:19:31] testify these beautiful words in a
[1:19:33] scripture I'm about to read. And it
[1:19:34] showed me, you know, it it kind of
[1:19:36] surprised me when it struck me that
[1:19:38] sometimes people can have the truth and
[1:19:39] not realize it.
[1:19:42] They can speak it but not understand it.
[1:19:46] How many times have I heard a a
[1:19:47] professing Christian repeat a scripture
[1:19:50] and yet they can't see the truth of it?
[1:19:52] They can't see the power of it. I had
[1:19:54] somebody ask me last year sometime. And
[1:19:56] he quoted a scripture and he said, "But
[1:19:59] we don't have that now, do we?" He read
[1:20:01] something from the New Testament. He
[1:20:02] said, "But that doesn't apply to us. We
[1:20:04] don't have that, do we?" I said,
[1:20:05] "Absolutely we do. God put it in. Where
[1:20:08] did he take it out? We took it out. God
[1:20:10] didn't take it out." And he was so
[1:20:13] surprised he'd lost the power of the
[1:20:14] word. He could tell me where that
[1:20:16] scripture was, but he couldn't tell me
[1:20:17] it was for him. That's what's happened
[1:20:20] today. Amen. They've lost the faith in
[1:20:22] the word. And that's what this message
[1:20:24] does is it restores us to the faith in
[1:20:26] the full word of God. And when we
[1:20:29] believe the full word, we get the full
[1:20:30] word effect.
[1:20:32] But I'm here tonight to preach at us.
[1:20:34] I'm here to preach who we are. And man,
[1:20:35] I'm here to show us what God says about
[1:20:37] us. I'm not here to pump up your tires
[1:20:39] because I think you're a good man or a
[1:20:41] good woman or a good Christian. I'm here
[1:20:42] to let you see what almighty God thinks
[1:20:44] about you. Because what he says is
[1:20:46] what's going to matter in the end. Amen.
[1:20:47] It's worth hearing.
[1:20:49] Paul would say this. We've read this
[1:20:51] scripture not too long ago. He says,
[1:20:52] "Let nothing be done through strife or
[1:20:54] vain glory, but in loneliness of mind,
[1:20:57] let each esteem other better than
[1:20:59] themselves. Look not every man on his
[1:21:02] own things, but every man also on the
[1:21:04] things of others. Let this mind be in
[1:21:06] you, which was also in Christ Jesus, who
[1:21:09] being in the form of God, thought it not
[1:21:11] robbery to be equal with God, but made
[1:21:14] himself of no reputation, and took upon
[1:21:17] him the form of a servant, and was made
[1:21:19] in the likeness of man. Now, let's stop
[1:21:22] here a moment because Paul says, listen,
[1:21:24] you got to have the mind of Christ in
[1:21:26] order to live and reflect Christ
[1:21:28] himself. But I love how Paul starts it
[1:21:30] out in verse three. If we were to sum
[1:21:32] that up, we'd say one one phrase, be
[1:21:34] humble.
[1:21:36] Take all that. Do nothing through strife
[1:21:38] for vain glory. You're not trying to
[1:21:39] pick a fight. You're not doing it for
[1:21:41] your own benefit. But what you're saying
[1:21:43] is, "Brother, you're better than me.
[1:21:44] Sister, you're greater than I am." In
[1:21:46] other words, be humble. Do things for
[1:21:48] the right reasons. Look after each
[1:21:50] other. When you're good and humble, put
[1:21:52] your shoulder to the wheel to help
[1:21:54] somebody else. When you get to the place
[1:21:56] where you're praying about other
[1:21:57] people's needs as much as your own, then
[1:22:00] you can progress to verse five. But you
[1:22:03] see how he builds it on character.
[1:22:06] He's building it on humility. He's
[1:22:08] building it on surrender and service,
[1:22:11] not self-elevation, pride, arrogance.
[1:22:15] I know this. I know that.
[1:22:18] But he says, after you get all that put
[1:22:20] in place, now you come to verse five. He
[1:22:22] says, remember, you're in the form of
[1:22:24] God as was Christ. But he's saying don't
[1:22:27] get ahead of yourself. He says, "Listen,
[1:22:29] Christ thought it not robbery to be
[1:22:31] equal with God." That that translation
[1:22:34] for that from the original language is
[1:22:36] it means he didn't consider his position
[1:22:39] something to be exploited.
[1:22:43] That word robbery literally means
[1:22:44] something to be grasped or taken. In
[1:22:47] other words, this mind of Christ and the
[1:22:49] authority that comes with it is not
[1:22:51] something for us to manipulate or use
[1:22:53] for our own benefit.
[1:22:55] You see it in Christ. Christ didn't go
[1:22:57] around in a life of ease and luxury. No
[1:23:00] pain, no suffering, no rejection,
[1:23:03] comfortable chariot, comfortable wagon,
[1:23:05] a place to sleep, a pillow. He had
[1:23:08] nothing, church. He had nothing. Worn
[1:23:11] out, headaches,
[1:23:13] tired, weary,
[1:23:16] so tired he could sleep in a boat in the
[1:23:18] middle of a storm. That's how wore out
[1:23:19] he was in service.
[1:23:22] Amen. What we have with this mind of
[1:23:24] Christ is not for us to use for personal
[1:23:26] benefit. It's for service. It's for
[1:23:29] service. Amen. That brings us back to
[1:23:32] our services on the mind of Christ. But
[1:23:34] if you notice this revelation of the
[1:23:36] mind of Christ, the spirit of Christ in
[1:23:38] us focuses us on everyone else and not
[1:23:41] ourselves in service. In service. Amen.
[1:23:45] It's reflective of a change we've
[1:23:47] received in ourselves and now we're here
[1:23:49] to support that change in everybody
[1:23:51] else. That's what the mind of Christ
[1:23:53] does. Amen. Now, we're in his hands
[1:23:55] being used for his work. Paul confirms
[1:23:57] it. Verse 13, he says, "For it is God
[1:24:01] which workketh in you both to will and
[1:24:04] to do of his good pleasure." We're
[1:24:07] speaking tonight on the mystery
[1:24:08] finished. And we see that Paul's saying,
[1:24:10] "Hey, this Christian walk isn't just
[1:24:12] about living clean and holding your
[1:24:14] temper and going to church. This this
[1:24:17] Christian walk for the spiritfilled
[1:24:19] surrendered believer is about doing the
[1:24:21] work of God and it's not by your doing.
[1:24:25] It's not by your desire and it's not by
[1:24:27] your planning. He says it is God which
[1:24:30] workketh in you. The the the the
[1:24:32] original language there is it is God
[1:24:34] which is effectual, fervent, and
[1:24:37] accomplishing things in you. In other
[1:24:39] words, this is all from him. It starts
[1:24:41] from him. He's the genesis of it. And he
[1:24:44] is the one that takes us and moves us
[1:24:46] forward. We aren't doing things because
[1:24:49] we have time and energy to burn.
[1:24:52] Get that?
[1:24:54] It's not because we have opportunity.
[1:24:56] Amen. We're doing a work. It's because
[1:24:58] it's he started us on that work or on
[1:25:01] that road. Paul says it's God that's
[1:25:03] working in you to will.
[1:25:05] To will. In other words, God's putting
[1:25:08] the desire, the inclination, the
[1:25:10] intention in the first place. Remember
[1:25:12] what Jesus said? He that hath my
[1:25:15] commandments.
[1:25:16] God's got to give you his will.
[1:25:19] And when he does,
[1:25:22] it's him that's doing all of that. I'm
[1:25:24] not sitting here going through and
[1:25:26] trying to find a place that I can do a
[1:25:27] work. There's lots of things lots of us
[1:25:30] could be doing, but we got to find the
[1:25:31] place he wants us. Amen. It's Paul
[1:25:35] showing us that a spiritfilled person
[1:25:37] has the leadership of the spirit. And
[1:25:39] it's not you desiring. It's not you
[1:25:41] willing. But it's God putting that
[1:25:43] desire in you. The Apostle Paul did not
[1:25:46] want to appeal to Caesar knowing it
[1:25:48] probably meant death.
[1:25:50] Moses didn't want to go back to Egypt.
[1:25:52] Peter did not want to go to the house of
[1:25:54] Cornelius, but they went anyways. Why?
[1:25:56] God put a desire in them to obey. First
[1:26:00] of all, to obey. You look around this
[1:26:02] church, we've got people serving. I look
[1:26:04] at brother Paul back there. He's up here
[1:26:07] playing. He's a Sunday school
[1:26:09] superintendent. He's teaching the young
[1:26:10] people and then he's handling young
[1:26:12] people's. That's a big burden. Guess
[1:26:15] what? If God doesn't put that desire in
[1:26:17] him, he's going to fail. But when he
[1:26:19] fails, he when he he God puts a desire
[1:26:21] in, he cannot fail because it's God that
[1:26:23] started the work. And then we see the
[1:26:25] switch that happens. It's God that's in
[1:26:28] you to will. And then he says it's God
[1:26:30] that will do it. It's not you doing it
[1:26:33] now. God put the desire and then God
[1:26:35] puts the ability to do it inside of his
[1:26:38] child.
[1:26:39] And so then if you didn't start it, it's
[1:26:42] not up to you to make sure you keep
[1:26:44] doing it. It's something inside of you
[1:26:46] that keeps pushing you forward. What is
[1:26:49] it to do? What? His good pleasure. His
[1:26:52] good pleasure is not always my good
[1:26:53] pleasure.
[1:26:56] I was saying, you know, I sure I sure
[1:26:58] wish brother Aaron would have been up
[1:26:59] here preaching this weekend. Why? I can
[1:27:01] use a break. It's not always my pleasure
[1:27:03] to be sitting and studying night after
[1:27:05] night and day after day. But it's his
[1:27:07] good pleasure. It's his good pleasure.
[1:27:10] And so it's up to me to do it and to
[1:27:11] trust that he'll meet me there and give
[1:27:13] people food in due season. And that's
[1:27:15] all I've got to do is give him an
[1:27:17] opportunity to use me. That's all he's
[1:27:20] asking me to do. God puts it in us to do
[1:27:22] it and then God works in us to perform
[1:27:24] it. That one he says it's it's working
[1:27:27] in you to do his good pleasure. It means
[1:27:29] to be mighty in to be effectual,
[1:27:31] effective, fervent in work. In other
[1:27:34] words, God puts the desire, then God
[1:27:36] puts the will and the ability and then
[1:27:37] the results are on him, not us. It's him
[1:27:41] working through us. It's going back to
[1:27:43] what Jesus said. He that has my
[1:27:45] commandments and keepeth them, he loves
[1:27:47] me, I love him, I'll manifest myself in
[1:27:49] him. We're bringing this full circle
[1:27:51] now. Paul's saying, listen, a
[1:27:53] spiritfilled person, God will put his
[1:27:55] desire, his will in you. Then he'll give
[1:27:57] you the power to do it and then the
[1:27:58] results will follow.
[1:28:02] I don't have to do a thing except obey.
[1:28:08] Obey. Make myself available. And then
[1:28:11] it's all on him. It's his work. But what
[1:28:14] is it? It's God in his people. That's
[1:28:16] what Paul's talking about. We're not
[1:28:17] God, but we're God revealed. Do you see
[1:28:21] the difference? Christ in me doesn't
[1:28:23] make me God, but it is a revealing of
[1:28:25] God. Christ in you doesn't make you God,
[1:28:28] but it's a revealing of God. It's God in
[1:28:30] us showing himself alive. Amen. Our
[1:28:32] lives, our old-fashioned, simple, humble
[1:28:35] lives, church, are showing Jesus Christ
[1:28:37] alive today. And it's a sign that almost
[1:28:40] nobody will notice, but it's nonetheless
[1:28:42] a sign. Amen. It's revealing God and his
[1:28:45] people all over again. Paul would say
[1:28:47] this, and this is the scripture I was
[1:28:48] talking about. He comes there
[1:28:51] and and he he's talking to the people in
[1:28:53] Athens and this is what he says. He
[1:28:55] says, "For in him we live and move and
[1:28:58] have our being." In other words, we're
[1:29:00] in him, church. He's in us and we're in
[1:29:02] him. There is no no difference between
[1:29:04] the two. We're lost in him.
[1:29:06] He says, "As certain also of your poets
[1:29:09] have said, for we are also his
[1:29:12] offspring." He says, "Listen, you've
[1:29:14] been preaching this, but I'm showing you
[1:29:15] what it means." their own people said,
[1:29:18] "We are children of God." And he says,
[1:29:20] "Here's what a child of God looks like."
[1:29:23] It's not a God that's made of silver or
[1:29:26] gold or stone or these different things,
[1:29:28] but it's a God inside of you producing
[1:29:30] himself. That's what he is. That's what
[1:29:33] makes you a child of God. Going back to
[1:29:36] Psalms, David would say, "I have said,
[1:29:38] ye are gods, and all of you are children
[1:29:41] of the most high." Church, we're not
[1:29:43] preaching milk anymore.
[1:29:45] This is mature meat for the believer.
[1:29:47] This is what adoption looks like. But
[1:29:50] he's showing you your heritage before
[1:29:52] you necessarily have the character and
[1:29:53] the reality of it. But nonetheless, if
[1:29:56] you can see yourself as a part of Christ
[1:29:58] in his mind before the foundation of the
[1:30:00] world, if he's revealed himself to you
[1:30:02] by his word, then he's got a purpose and
[1:30:04] he's got a plan for you, for your life
[1:30:07] in this time and in this season. That's
[1:30:09] the way that he works. Amen. I'm
[1:30:11] challenging us tonight to see a little
[1:30:13] more than what we see in our little
[1:30:14] circle. That we're not just housewives
[1:30:17] living at home, educating our kids,
[1:30:20] cooking meals, cleaning houses. Church,
[1:30:23] we are you are a witness of Christ and a
[1:30:26] faithful bride.
[1:30:29] We're not just men going to work,
[1:30:31] keeping ourselves separate, not laughing
[1:30:33] at the jokes, not getting caught up in
[1:30:35] things.
[1:30:36] No, we're showing that Christ is working
[1:30:39] in our lives in simple, humble,
[1:30:43] victorious Christian lives. Amen.
[1:30:49] Trying to get you to see what he says
[1:30:51] about you so you can have faith daytoday
[1:30:53] that you're not just living life, but
[1:30:55] it's his life living through you.
[1:30:57] Brother B would say this. He says, "What
[1:30:59] is the church supposed to do? Reflect
[1:31:01] the same thing that he did." Certainly.
[1:31:04] He said overreflecting it's God and his
[1:31:06] people. I remember in the Bible when an
[1:31:08] old prophet so filled with the Holy
[1:31:10] Spirit till a Shounomite woman had a
[1:31:11] baby and it died and the prophet
[1:31:13] couldn't hear from God nowhere. But he
[1:31:15] walked up and down the floor to and fro
[1:31:17] until the spirit of God came on him. He
[1:31:20] stretched himself up over that little
[1:31:22] dead baby. He sneezed seven times and
[1:31:24] came to life. He says, "What was it?
[1:31:26] That prophet?" No, sir. God and his
[1:31:30] people. That's right. He says it was God
[1:31:32] and his people. Certainly. That's
[1:31:34] exactly right. We find a man by the name
[1:31:36] of St. Peter. Didn't have enough
[1:31:38] education, no seminary experience, had
[1:31:40] no fellowship from any organization, but
[1:31:44] he was filled with the Holy Spirit.
[1:31:47] Church, what are you looking for?
[1:31:50] If you've got the spirit of God,
[1:31:51] identify yourself here. God in his
[1:31:55] people. He says they saw him prophesy
[1:31:58] and saw it come to pass. They watched
[1:32:00] his great life. They heard his
[1:32:01] influence. a man. He spoke like Jesus
[1:32:03] Christ. The Bible said they perceived
[1:32:05] that they were ignorant and unlearned
[1:32:07] men, but they knew they'd been with
[1:32:09] Jesus. He says, "See, it reflects
[1:32:12] himself in you." He says, "And they find
[1:32:15] out that people believed it so great, so
[1:32:18] much God come upon those people till
[1:32:20] they even laid in the shadow of that
[1:32:22] ignorant fisherman and as many as laid
[1:32:24] there with faith believing got healed."
[1:32:27] He says, "Not the shadow of that
[1:32:28] fisherman, but God in his people, God
[1:32:32] operating through his people."
[1:32:35] Certainly.
[1:32:36] He says they saw Paul stand up there and
[1:32:38] make prophecies and every one of them
[1:32:40] happened just exactly foretell things
[1:32:42] and do everything that the Jesus Christ
[1:32:44] did when he was here on earth. They saw
[1:32:46] that he was with Christ. They knew
[1:32:48] Christ was with him till even they
[1:32:50] required him to take handkerchiefs and
[1:32:52] aprons from his body and they laid it
[1:32:54] upon the sick and afflicted and evil
[1:32:56] spirits went out of the people diseases
[1:32:58] were healed. He says what is it God in
[1:33:02] his people?
[1:33:05] Now I read a quote like set of quotes
[1:33:06] like that and we look at that and we'd
[1:33:09] say well brother John that ain't my
[1:33:11] life.
[1:33:13] Has anybody healed something by having
[1:33:15] them sit in their shadow recently? Show
[1:33:17] of hands.
[1:33:20] No. Are we all prophets?
[1:33:24] Do we all have the gift of healing?
[1:33:27] No.
[1:33:29] So, how does this even apply to us?
[1:33:32] How can we compare to them?
[1:33:37] How can we compare our lives to Jesus?
[1:33:41] We say, "I'm not walking around healing
[1:33:42] people. I'm not walking around
[1:33:43] prophesying. I'm not out there raising
[1:33:44] the dead. I'm not even out there
[1:33:46] preaching.
[1:33:48] But remember church, Jesus miracles
[1:33:50] showed his authority.
[1:33:53] But his life revealed the word.
[1:33:56] His life fulfilled the word. His
[1:33:59] daytoday life, his day-to-day words, his
[1:34:02] day-to-day action, his day-to-day
[1:34:03] leadership, when he spoke, when he
[1:34:06] didn't, where he went, when he went, who
[1:34:08] he talked to, it was all reflecting what
[1:34:11] the word had prophesied about him. His
[1:34:13] life was to fulfill the father's word.
[1:34:16] And that was to do what the word said
[1:34:17] about him. And it's the same for you and
[1:34:19] I. Our mission is not to run around
[1:34:22] healing everybody, speaking in tongues,
[1:34:26] showing signs and wonders. That is not
[1:34:29] the order. Amen. That's not our food.
[1:34:32] Amen. It's not our food. We love those
[1:34:36] things. We have those things at times.
[1:34:38] Amen. But these are benefits and they
[1:34:42] are followers of the believer. Amen. But
[1:34:47] our lives are the fulfillment of his
[1:34:49] word day by day. We are not called to
[1:34:53] heal the person every day, but we're
[1:34:55] called to live by the word every day.
[1:34:57] You see the constancy of it. See, we
[1:35:00] want those supernatural moments to
[1:35:02] vindicate ourselves. And God says, "How
[1:35:03] about you give me a faithful life
[1:35:04] instead?
[1:35:06] I'll take care of the signs and wonders.
[1:35:07] How about you live a faithful Christian
[1:35:09] life? Amen.
[1:35:12] We're here to show the reality of a life
[1:35:14] stabilized by the word of God. A sane
[1:35:18] Christian life. An overcomer's life.
[1:35:21] Amen. We're here to show the effect of
[1:35:23] the word of God in our day-today life.
[1:35:26] Amen. I'll tell you, church, if you can
[1:35:28] live a life that's above the worries and
[1:35:30] the fears and the annoyances and and all
[1:35:32] the things that this world is trying to
[1:35:34] press in on us, that's supernatural.
[1:35:38] Lots of people want to live the life
[1:35:40] you're living and they can't do it. Why?
[1:35:44] They weren't born for it. But you've
[1:35:46] been born again to do it. And you live a
[1:35:49] life that almost nobody else can. Amen.
[1:35:52] That simple witness that God is looking
[1:35:54] for. Amen. It's not just God looking for
[1:35:56] it. It's the world. Listen to this. He
[1:35:58] says, "What the world is looking for is
[1:36:00] to see some display. Not of shouting.
[1:36:03] That's all right. I believe in that. Not
[1:36:04] speaking in tongues. Now, that's all
[1:36:05] right. I believe in that. in its place.
[1:36:07] I believe in the whole Bible, not some
[1:36:09] miracle of healing. I believe in that,
[1:36:11] every bit of it. But what the world is
[1:36:13] looking for is to see some real
[1:36:15] Christianity, some real life that you
[1:36:18] live out on the street, wherever you
[1:36:21] are, sealed with the power of God. Now,
[1:36:25] remember what a seal means, church. It
[1:36:27] means nothing can go in or come out. It
[1:36:31] means a finished work. Remember we spoke
[1:36:33] last service about how when you are
[1:36:36] sealed by the life inside of you, when
[1:36:38] the womb receives life, it seals itself.
[1:36:43] In other words, what happens is this
[1:36:45] world presses in and it's trying to put
[1:36:48] something inside of you,
[1:36:52] but you're sealed. The womb is closed.
[1:36:55] It can't get to you. That's the
[1:36:58] Christian life is no matter what comes,
[1:37:00] no matter what goes, no matter what
[1:37:01] we're given, no matter what's taken
[1:37:03] away, no matter who leaves, no matter
[1:37:05] who comes in, it doesn't change a thing.
[1:37:07] What political party, what the economy
[1:37:10] is doing, whether we have great jobs,
[1:37:12] whether we don't have jobs,
[1:37:14] it matters not. No matter what happens,
[1:37:16] we're sealed. We don't change. All it is
[1:37:20] is the life inside us keeps growing,
[1:37:21] growing, growing. And Satan can bang and
[1:37:24] he can knock and he can push and he can
[1:37:26] do everything he wants, but we're sealed
[1:37:28] to the day of our full redemption. We've
[1:37:30] got a life of constancy. Amen. He says
[1:37:34] we're not running down the street
[1:37:35] hollering, "Hallelujah. Hallelujah." He
[1:37:37] says, "That isn't it, but a sweet,
[1:37:39] humble Christian walk before men, living
[1:37:42] the life, acting like a Christian, being
[1:37:45] like a Christian, behaving yourself like
[1:37:48] a Christian." That's what the world is
[1:37:50] wanting to see. He says, "And the people
[1:37:52] will go down the street and say, if
[1:37:53] there ever was a Christian, a sainted
[1:37:56] person, there she goes or there he
[1:37:58] goes." He says, "But you see what we've
[1:38:00] done." He says, "You know that's true,
[1:38:01] friend. When the church gets back to
[1:38:04] living what we're professing," he says,
[1:38:06] Jesus said, "Ye are the salt of the
[1:38:08] earth, but if the salt has lost its
[1:38:10] saber, it's not good for anything but to
[1:38:12] be put under the feet of men and made
[1:38:13] roads out of." He says, "Now, let me ask
[1:38:15] you something. A salt is a saber if it
[1:38:18] contacts. If you've got a barrel of meat
[1:38:21] here and a barrel of salt here, and the
[1:38:23] meat will spoil unless the meat and the
[1:38:25] salt get together.
[1:38:28] That means we can't just be holed up in
[1:38:29] our house living sanctified lives.
[1:38:33] Church, I'm not going to bars to find
[1:38:35] lost people, but I've got to be able to
[1:38:37] walk and function in this world. We
[1:38:40] Scripture says we're in this world, but
[1:38:42] we're not of it. We've got to be able to
[1:38:45] walk through it and keep our garments
[1:38:46] unspotted.
[1:38:48] But we've got to be able to walk through
[1:38:49] it. We've got to be able to deal with
[1:38:52] those that don't believe the way we do,
[1:38:54] that don't see the things the way we do,
[1:38:56] cuz we have to be a witness. We've got
[1:38:58] to be a witness. Church, we're not going
[1:39:00] to run everybody in Newfoundland through
[1:39:01] this church.
[1:39:03] But guess what? They see you when you go
[1:39:06] out. You sisters in particular, they see
[1:39:08] you when you're out and about. He says,
[1:39:10] "If you're the salt of the earth, then
[1:39:13] you've got to live such a life, a
[1:39:15] written epistle, till all men will know
[1:39:17] what you are." He says, "No matter what
[1:39:19] you profess to be, you know, they say
[1:39:22] this, your life speaks so loud I can't
[1:39:24] hear your testimony." He says, "That's
[1:39:26] right." Remember what Jesus said? He
[1:39:29] says in Mark 16, "These signs shall
[1:39:31] follow them that believe." Church, that
[1:39:34] means something else has to lead the
[1:39:36] way. It ain't signs and wonders. It's
[1:39:39] not miracles. Amen. What is it? It's a
[1:39:42] life surrendered to the word. It's the
[1:39:44] gospel living in you and I. That's what
[1:39:46] leads the way and everything else
[1:39:48] follows.
[1:39:49] You know, we've been praying for
[1:39:50] Cherylyn Piery with that horrible
[1:39:53] condition that she has, a sentence of
[1:39:55] death on her. But the first thing she's
[1:39:56] got to see before she can ever be healed
[1:39:58] is she's got to see people that believe
[1:39:59] in healing. She's got to see people that
[1:40:02] are willing to testify,
[1:40:04] people that have been healed. Your life
[1:40:07] is the testimony before they can receive
[1:40:09] it.
[1:40:10] You've got to be the supernatural.
[1:40:14] Brother Bob has a wonderful testimony of
[1:40:16] healing, of cancer. That's a beautiful
[1:40:19] thing. Sister Justine sees perfectly and
[1:40:22] no no no no migraine headaches anymore.
[1:40:25] The other ones that have had
[1:40:27] supernatural experiences in their life
[1:40:29] and in their body, that's your testimony
[1:40:32] along with the dayto-day constancy of
[1:40:35] your faithful living by the word. Amen.
[1:40:40] But see, the thing is,
[1:40:43] we'd rather lead with the supernatural.
[1:40:46] Why? Because you'll get people with the
[1:40:47] supernatural. But we're here not here to
[1:40:50] draw people in. We're here to bring in
[1:40:52] those that are hungering and thirsting.
[1:40:55] Not for just healing, but to live a life
[1:40:58] like you've lived. Those that can see
[1:41:01] the word in front of them and say, "I
[1:41:03] want what you've got. I want a family
[1:41:04] like you have. I don't understand how
[1:41:06] you got it, but I'm willing to give it a
[1:41:08] shot." There's something about your life
[1:41:10] that draws me in. Amen. Church, this
[1:41:12] this is if we'll lead with the word, if
[1:41:14] we'll lead with our lives, God will
[1:41:16] follow with the supernatural in his time
[1:41:18] and in his season and in his way. Amen.
[1:41:21] This isn't a show. We're not here to
[1:41:23] cater to what people want. Well, I'll
[1:41:25] believe Jesus if he heals me. Well,
[1:41:27] guess what? You're probably not going to
[1:41:28] be healed.
[1:41:30] He asked you to believe first and then
[1:41:32] the healing follows. Right? A wicked and
[1:41:35] perverse generation seeks after a sign.
[1:41:38] He's looking for those that will receive
[1:41:40] the word. Amen. We're not here to cater
[1:41:42] to people or do what they want. We're
[1:41:44] salt. We're supposed to make people
[1:41:46] thirsty.
[1:41:48] Amen.
[1:41:49] But I'll tell you, it's a whole lot more
[1:41:51] fun, isn't it, to say, "I've got a gift
[1:41:53] of healing. I got a gift of discernment.
[1:41:55] I got a gift of prophecy." Those
[1:41:56] different things to be the supernatural.
[1:41:58] But let me tell you, church, if you can
[1:41:59] live a life by the word every day,
[1:42:01] that's more supernatural than one person
[1:42:02] being healed. 100%. That's the truth.
[1:42:07] Amen. There are people out there that
[1:42:08] can heal people by faith in Jesus name,
[1:42:11] and they can't live the life that you do
[1:42:12] today
[1:42:14] because gifts and callings are without
[1:42:15] repentance.
[1:42:17] They have the supernatural in acts, but
[1:42:19] they don't have supernatural in life.
[1:42:22] And Jesus said, he said, "I came that
[1:42:24] you would have life and more
[1:42:24] abundantly." Amen. Fruit that remains.
[1:42:28] We've been born to live this life. Amen.
[1:42:31] Watch how Paul finishes this thought as
[1:42:33] we start to wind down tonight. This is
[1:42:34] the mindset now of the believer. He
[1:42:36] says, "Do all things without murmurings
[1:42:39] and disputings."
[1:42:42] In other words, don't grumble about the
[1:42:44] life that God has called you to live.
[1:42:46] I'm not allowed to grumble because I
[1:42:48] only get one or two nights an evening a
[1:42:50] week free. I'm not allowed to do that.
[1:42:52] That's what Paul's saying, brother John.
[1:42:53] Doesn't matter how much you have to
[1:42:54] study, don't grumble about it. That's
[1:42:56] your lot in life. Yeah. That's your
[1:43:00] calling. That's your position. That's
[1:43:02] your burden.
[1:43:04] Sisters, guess what? Your burden is to
[1:43:07] stay home and take care of the of the
[1:43:10] household and the kids. That's your
[1:43:12] burden. Don't grumble about it.
[1:43:13] Brothers, we got to get up every morning
[1:43:15] and go to work.
[1:43:18] Don't grumble about it. Those of you
[1:43:20] that are serving in offices, don't
[1:43:22] grumble about it when it bears a little
[1:43:24] heavy. Why? God's called you to do it.
[1:43:28] He's enabled you to do it. Amen.
[1:43:31] He says that word, that word disputing
[1:43:33] means reasoning, debating, internal
[1:43:35] consideration. Other words, don't
[1:43:37] dissect what God's trying to do in your
[1:43:39] life. Six ways past Sunday. Just stay
[1:43:41] with it.
[1:43:43] Don't try and think it all through.
[1:43:45] Don't try and see where he's going.
[1:43:47] Church, can you imagine if I tried to
[1:43:49] figure out all the way that God led me?
[1:43:51] All the way down into the US, all the
[1:43:53] way up to the West Coast, sat me down
[1:43:54] for a while, and then brought me over
[1:43:55] here. I'd have been drove crazy trying
[1:43:57] to figure out what God was trying to do.
[1:43:59] Don't try and figure it out. Just stay
[1:44:01] with him.
[1:44:03] Trust him. Let him do his leading. And
[1:44:06] he'll make it all abundantly clear in
[1:44:08] his time. Amen.
[1:44:11] live the life he's given you to live.
[1:44:14] He says why? That you may be blameless
[1:44:17] and harmless. That word harmless means
[1:44:18] innocent. That you may be blameless and
[1:44:20] innocent, the sons of God without
[1:44:22] rebuke. That word rebuke means
[1:44:24] unblenmished, spotless, without spot or
[1:44:27] wrinkle in the midst of a crooked and
[1:44:29] perverse nation among whom you shine as
[1:44:31] lights in the world. He says, "Listen,
[1:44:33] your life is not like everyone else's.
[1:44:35] The only light these people are going to
[1:44:37] see is your light.
[1:44:39] We're not going to get everyone through
[1:44:40] here. Some people will never crack open
[1:44:43] a Bible,
[1:44:45] but they'll see you.
[1:44:47] He says, "You got to be a light.
[1:44:50] We can't just be good church members.
[1:44:53] We've got to be living daily by what we
[1:44:56] say we believe." Amen.
[1:44:59] Sons of God, God and his people. He
[1:45:02] says, "Holding forth the word of life."
[1:45:04] That means never letting go.
[1:45:07] Don't lay it down because it's
[1:45:08] uncomfortable. Don't lay it down because
[1:45:10] it's unpopular.
[1:45:13] Don't lay it down because it'll make
[1:45:14] things awkward. I reminded of Brother
[1:45:16] Bob, you know, when he was traveling for
[1:45:18] business and they they had a a new
[1:45:20] executive that came in and they were all
[1:45:22] going down to a pub to to eat. And
[1:45:25] that's what you have today. His pubs
[1:45:26] aren't for drinking, they're for eating
[1:45:27] and drinking. And so you can get pulled
[1:45:28] into that. And he says, "Well, guys,
[1:45:30] sorry. I can't do that." Now, that was
[1:45:32] awkward potentially. But you know what?
[1:45:35] Everyone said, "Hey, where are you
[1:45:36] going?" "Well, I'm going to go down
[1:45:37] here." "Well, I'd like to go there,
[1:45:39] too." And then most of the people went
[1:45:40] on with him. See, if he wasn't willing
[1:45:42] to be awkward, he wouldn't have been a
[1:45:44] light.
[1:45:46] You got to be willing to stand out. You
[1:45:47] got to be willing to confess, "I don't
[1:45:49] do those things. I don't talk about
[1:45:52] those things. I don't believe those
[1:45:54] things. I don't support those things.
[1:45:57] Here's what I believe. Here's what I
[1:45:59] support. Here's how I do these things."
[1:46:01] You got to be able to do it. Amen. Let
[1:46:04] me read us one more quote. Oh, sorry. He
[1:46:06] says, "Holding forth the word of life,
[1:46:07] let never letting go of it." He says,
[1:46:09] "That I may rejoice in the day of Christ
[1:46:11] that I have not run in vain, neither
[1:46:13] labored in vain." The people are proof
[1:46:15] of the ministry.
[1:46:17] I hope my wife doesn't mind me saying
[1:46:19] this.
[1:46:20] She asked me the other day. She says,
[1:46:21] "What are you looking forward to most in
[1:46:23] the next five years?" I said, "Honey,
[1:46:24] I'm just trying to get through day by
[1:46:26] day." True true husband's words. Amen.
[1:46:29] Wives, don't you hate it when when we're
[1:46:31] so See, we don't we're just What we are
[1:46:34] is we're scriptural. Sufficient to the
[1:46:36] day is the evil thereof. Amen. But she
[1:46:39] said, "Is this okay?" She said, "What
[1:46:43] are you looking most forward to the next
[1:46:45] 5 years?" I said, "I'm not even there
[1:46:46] yet." But I said, "Now that you're
[1:46:48] making me think," I said, "You know what
[1:46:50] I'm looking forward to? I'm looking
[1:46:52] forward to see the next generation step
[1:46:55] up. That's what I'm looking forward to.
[1:46:58] I praise the Lord for sister Amber and
[1:47:00] my wife and brother Joe and sister
[1:47:02] Priscilla and brother Paul and and the
[1:47:05] brother Matt and and you know yes I I
[1:47:07] appreciate Kingsley and Becky and Vichel
[1:47:09] too but they don't have you know yeah
[1:47:13] they don't have kids yet and stuff like
[1:47:15] that. I know brother brother you know
[1:47:16] but you know what I'm saying that that
[1:47:18] they're they're moving they got another
[1:47:20] generation rolling in. But I I
[1:47:22] appreciate those that have the life of
[1:47:24] Christ in them. That's what I'm saying.
[1:47:26] But there are those that have really
[1:47:27] moved on and there's a second generation
[1:47:29] that's really ready to step up again.
[1:47:31] We're getting there again. And I said,
[1:47:33] "That's what I'm looking forward to."
[1:47:35] And I said, "I'm envious of Brother
[1:47:36] Gerald because Brother Gerald has
[1:47:38] already seen his crop." I said, "I'm
[1:47:40] waiting for my crop. That's what I'm
[1:47:42] looking forward to. And I'm trusting
[1:47:44] that the time I'm putting into the
[1:47:46] planting and watering will produce a
[1:47:48] good crop."
[1:47:50] Amen. I want to see young people filled
[1:47:52] with the Holy Ghost living simple,
[1:47:55] humble, spiritfilled, and led Christian
[1:47:59] lives. That's what I want. That's what
[1:48:02] I'm here for. Amen. I got no doubts
[1:48:05] about the middleagers. Kingsley and
[1:48:08] Becky and Vicel, I know you're not
[1:48:09] middleagers yet. For us, Mary folks,
[1:48:11] brother Paul, you're out as well. But,
[1:48:13] you know, for brother Matt and sister
[1:48:14] Amber and brother Joe and sister
[1:48:15] Priscilla and brother Chad and sister
[1:48:17] Lee and that I'm thankful for what God
[1:48:18] has done in our lives. But I'm saying,
[1:48:20] Lord, let's see it again because it's
[1:48:22] the fourth generation where you always
[1:48:24] had the problems and we've got three
[1:48:26] here.
[1:48:28] I want to see I don't want to see it,
[1:48:31] but I want to know that as our our
[1:48:34] sisters get married and our young men
[1:48:36] get married, they're going to have kids
[1:48:37] and they're going to have the same
[1:48:38] experience as we did if the Lord should
[1:48:40] terry. That's what I want to see. I want
[1:48:42] to see Christ keep moving, Christ keep
[1:48:45] living.
[1:48:47] that if he should terry, some are going
[1:48:48] to drop off. Others are going to come
[1:48:50] right in behind him and fill in their
[1:48:51] shoes by God's grace. Amen.
[1:48:54] Read two more quotes. God's offices,
[1:48:57] father, son, and holy ghost. God the
[1:48:59] father was the God that lived in the
[1:49:01] pillar of fire. He said he was trying to
[1:49:03] draw Israel to him. They wouldn't come.
[1:49:05] God the father lived in the son which
[1:49:06] made him God the son. The same God
[1:49:09] expressed image of God, the seed of God
[1:49:11] manifest drawing trying to draw the
[1:49:13] people to him. They crucified him. He
[1:49:16] says the Holy Ghost is the same God that
[1:49:19] was at the beginning in the son of God
[1:49:21] and he's now here. He says now here the
[1:49:25] other office of God.
[1:49:30] He says in the last days he says the
[1:49:33] Holy Spirit is now in the last office of
[1:49:36] God.
[1:49:38] He says what is he doing? living in the
[1:49:42] church trying to bring the word the
[1:49:44] spoken word like the two other offices
[1:49:47] did to the people. He says and they
[1:49:50] reject it. He says it but it's the same
[1:49:52] thing. It's three offices or
[1:49:54] manifestations of one God in action. He
[1:49:56] says and God in his people today in
[1:49:59] action is God in action. He says see
[1:50:02] it's God in the people. Can you say amen
[1:50:07] this evening? Amen. God bless you. Let's
[1:50:09] stand together if we would.
[1:50:12] Amen. What is it?
[1:50:15] Christ in you, the hope of glory. Jesus
[1:50:18] Christ. The same yesterday, today, and
[1:50:21] forever. That's always been the role of
[1:50:22] the church is to express Christ. Amen.
[1:50:26] Not to build some big church, not to put
[1:50:29] on these trappings and robes and
[1:50:32] priestly garments and build big
[1:50:33] cathedrals and these things, but it's a
[1:50:36] church that's to reflect his leadership,
[1:50:38] his authority, his power, his headship.
[1:50:41] Amen. His will, his purpose, his
[1:50:43] actions, his desires. Our life is
[1:50:45] supposed to be so lost in his that all
[1:50:47] people can see is Jesus.
[1:50:50] Amen.
[1:50:51] Scripture says the saints will judge the
[1:50:53] earth.
[1:50:56] How?
[1:50:59] Your life's
[1:51:01] cuz you're the word all over again.
[1:51:04] They'll never crack open a Bible. But
[1:51:07] they'll see you sisters walking through
[1:51:09] the grocery store with your long hair
[1:51:11] and your dresses and your modesty,
[1:51:14] simple, clean, humble.
[1:51:18] And guess what? that's going to judge
[1:51:20] them walking around in their leggings
[1:51:23] and tight this and beared that. Why?
[1:51:26] Because they saw what God wanted. They
[1:51:28] saw what God is and they said, "That's
[1:51:31] not for me."
[1:51:35] It would behoove us day by day, I think,
[1:51:38] to realize that we may be the only
[1:51:40] gospel that some people are ever going
[1:51:42] to see.
[1:51:44] And if that's the case, would we change
[1:51:47] anything?
[1:51:49] I was listening to brother Brandham and
[1:51:51] he said, 'You know why people do things
[1:51:53] they ought not to do? He says they think
[1:51:56] or they forget that God can't God can
[1:51:58] see it.
[1:52:01] I thought that was pretty powerful.
[1:52:03] When we do something we ought not to, we
[1:52:05] look at something we ought not to, we
[1:52:06] say something we ought not to, what it
[1:52:08] is is we forget or we think that he
[1:52:10] doesn't see it. He says God sees it all.
[1:52:13] He says, can you imagine the life you'd
[1:52:15] live if you realized he sees everything
[1:52:16] you do? He hears everything you say. He
[1:52:19] knows everything you think. Amen.
[1:52:24] What a witness we're required to give in
[1:52:27] this last day. We're the only lights in
[1:52:30] a work world that is completely dark.
[1:52:34] Amen.
[1:52:36] I say, Lord, help me to be a greater
[1:52:37] light. Lord, help my words. Help the
[1:52:40] things I do. Help the things I not do.
[1:52:43] Show people that there's a Christ that's
[1:52:45] still alive and well. that there's a
[1:52:47] holiness, there's a modesty, there's a
[1:52:50] moderation,
[1:52:52] there's a peace, there's a joy, there's
[1:52:54] a rest that's available to people if
[1:52:56] they'll let him into their lives. Amen.
[1:52:59] I say, Lord, make us a greater witness.
[1:53:02] God bless you. Let's bow our heads.
[1:53:04] Heavenly Father,
[1:53:06] Lord, that's our desire. I pray, Lord,
[1:53:09] I'm trusting tonight. It's not just
[1:53:11] mine, but it's the desire of everyone
[1:53:12] here, Lord, that we could be a greater
[1:53:14] witness for you, heavenly father. Lord,
[1:53:17] I pray you'd help us to be mindful of
[1:53:19] your presence, Lord, that we are the
[1:53:21] tabernacle of the Holy Ghost, the temple
[1:53:23] of the Holy Ghost. Lord, we are the
[1:53:25] dwelling place for you in this last age.
[1:53:28] Lord, I pray you help our lives to
[1:53:30] reflect it. Our attitudes, Lord, the way
[1:53:33] we respond, the way we react, the things
[1:53:35] we focus on, our priorities.
[1:53:38] Lord, I pray you make our families, our
[1:53:40] homes, our marriages, our careers. Lord,
[1:53:42] our decisions. I pray that each one of
[1:53:44] them will be a witness to people. Lord,
[1:53:46] that there's a sanity that's still
[1:53:48] available to them today. Lord, the world
[1:53:51] is looking. There's so many looking and
[1:53:53] wondering, Lord, where they can find
[1:53:56] these things, Lord. I pray you help us
[1:53:57] to stand true and tall, Lord. That we
[1:54:00] would shine in this darkness, Lord,
[1:54:01] greater than ever, Lord. Help us to be
[1:54:04] real lights, Lord. Not flickering
[1:54:06] lights, Lord, but a solid, steady gleam
[1:54:10] of holiness and purity, heavenly father,
[1:54:12] by your word, Lord. Make us a greater
[1:54:15] witness, I pray. Lord, let people see
[1:54:18] you in us, Lord, for we'll give you the
[1:54:20] glory. We'll give you the honor, and
[1:54:22] we'll give you the praise. In Jesus
[1:54:24] Christ's name we ask it. Amen. I was
[1:54:28] born to be a dwelling place. 742.
[1:54:33] [Music]
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; I was born
[1:54:39] to be
[1:54:43] a dwelling
[1:54:47] place,
[1:54:50] a home
[1:54:52] for the presence
[1:54:56] of the Lord.
[1:54:59] [Music]
[1:55:02] So let my life
[1:55:07] now be
[1:55:11] consecrated
[1:55:15] to thee
[1:55:17] that I might be
[1:55:21] what I was born
[1:55:24] to
[1:55:26] be. The light was born
[1:55:32] to me.
[1:55:47] the presence
[1:55:50] of the Lord.
[1:55:55] Oh, let my life

[2:02:22] You know, I'm struck by what Jesus said.
[2:02:24] He gave that parable of the servants and
[2:02:27] he said to one was given five talents,
[2:02:29] one was given two and one was given one.
[2:02:32] Then the man went away and when he came
[2:02:34] back he drew them in for an accounting.
[2:02:38] And the first one came in and he said,
[2:02:39] "I took your five and I made another
[2:02:41] five." And he said, "Well done, thou
[2:02:44] good and faithful servant. Enter thou
[2:02:46] into the joys of thy lord." and he sent
[2:02:48] them all. The one that had two came in.
[2:02:51] He says, "I took your two and I produced
[2:02:53] another two. I doubled it." He said,
[2:02:55] "Well done. You've been faithful in the
[2:02:57] little." He says, "I'll give you more."
[2:03:00] Then the one came in. He said, "I knew
[2:03:02] you were a person that reaped where you
[2:03:03] didn't sew, and you took what you didn't
[2:03:05] develop your own self." He says, "So I
[2:03:07] took it and I buried it in the napkin."
[2:03:08] He says, "Thou wicked and slothful
[2:03:10] servant." He says, "You are lazy. You
[2:03:11] are too scared to do anything with what
[2:03:13] I gave you." And he said, "Take his and
[2:03:16] give it to the one that has 10." They
[2:03:18] said, "Lord, he already has 10." He
[2:03:20] says, "He has 10." The theme of it was
[2:03:22] he has 10 because he took what I gave
[2:03:24] him and develop more with it. Amen.
[2:03:27] That's what faithfulness looks like. You
[2:03:29] take where God has placed you. You take
[2:03:31] what he's done for you and you use it.
[2:03:34] You do that, then God will give you
[2:03:36] more. But he doesn't give you more if
[2:03:38] you're not using what you have right
[2:03:39] now.
[2:03:40] It's the faithful servant is the one
[2:03:42] that's constantly working for the
[2:03:44] master's benefit. Amen. That's what
[2:03:46] being a servant is. Just being where you
[2:03:48] are, doing what you can do day in and
[2:03:51] day out. That's the simplicity of being
[2:03:53] a servant. Amen. We're going to sing one
[2:03:56] more song.
[2:03:58] We're going to sing that one pleasing
[2:04:01] 524.
[2:04:02] And I'm going to ask uh I think you have
[2:04:04] brother Matt open. Is that right? We're
[2:04:06] going to ask brother Bob to close in
[2:04:07] prayer tonight if he would. Amen. Good
[2:04:10] to see sister Melody here feeling
[2:04:12] better. Amen. Praise the Lord. We did
[2:04:14] have a a I do have a um a praise report.
[2:04:18] My um mother-in-law Nana as we call her,
[2:04:20] she had multiple surgeries. She had
[2:04:23] surgery on her spine. The guy messed it
[2:04:25] up. Didn't didn't uh share that he
[2:04:28] messed it up. They did tests. They found
[2:04:31] other things. They went in. They fixed
[2:04:32] that with surgery. Very painful. Well,
[2:04:35] anyways, in the second surgery, they
[2:04:37] said, "What's happened is your your
[2:04:39] bowel or your intestine has attached
[2:04:40] itself to the muscle when we did the
[2:04:42] work. We're going to have to go in
[2:04:43] again." So, that'll be a third surgery.
[2:04:46] Very painful. You know, it's very
[2:04:48] difficult on her. And so, we prayed and
[2:04:50] they tested her the other day and they
[2:04:52] said, "We were wrong. It's not attached.
[2:04:54] You're going to be just fine." So, we
[2:04:56] say, "Praise the Lord." Amen. That an
[2:04:58] older sister like like Sister Navas
[2:05:00] doesn't have to go through that. Amen.
[2:05:02] It just it really made uh her week, I'm
[2:05:05] sure. And we were so happy for that. So,
[2:05:06] we praise the Lord. Amen. He's still a
[2:05:09] prayer answering God. He's still a
[2:05:11] healing God. Amen. So, we thank that him
[2:05:13] for that. And thank him for touching
[2:05:15] Sister Melody. Amen. Praying that he'll
[2:05:17] continue to be with us, put out these
[2:05:19] fires for once and for all. Amen. That
[2:05:21] he'll just continue to speak and move in
[2:05:24] our lives. Amen. Let's sing this and
[2:05:26] brother Bob will come.

[2:05:41] to you.
[2:05:44] Let everything
[2:05:47] that
[2:05:49] I do
[2:05:52] be pleasing
[2:05:56] to you.
[2:06:00] Praying
[2:06:06] that everything
[2:06:10] I pursue
[2:06:14] be pleasing,
[2:06:19] oh Lord,
[2:06:21] unto
[2:06:22] you.
[2:06:26] pleasing.
[2:06:27] [Music]
[2:06:31] Oh, let me be pleasing
[2:06:37] to you.
[2:06:40] Let everything
[2:06:43] that
[2:06:44] I do
[2:06:48] be pleasing
[2:06:52] to you
[2:06:56] and praying
[2:07:02] that everything
[2:07:06] I
[2:07:07] pursue
[2:07:10] Be pleased,
[2:07:15] oh Lord,
[2:07:17] unto
[2:07:19] you.
[2:07:27] Amen. Heavenly Father,
[2:07:30] let that be our prayer tonight, Father,
[2:07:32] as we leave that, Father, we want to be
[2:07:34] pleasing to you, Lord, in everything
[2:07:36] that we say, everything that we do,
[2:07:38] Lord. That Father, we would be obedient
[2:07:41] to your leadership, Father, in every in
[2:07:44] every every time, Lord, that we step
[2:07:47] outside our door, Father, that we hear
[2:07:49] that still small voice leading us and
[2:07:51] guiding us, Father. maybe cross a path,
[2:07:53] Lord, with somebody that needs a touch
[2:07:55] from you, Lord, that needs to hear about
[2:07:57] you, Lord, or needs to see you, Father.
[2:08:00] And we pray, Lord, that you'd help us,
[2:08:02] Father, by grace just totally to
[2:08:05] realize, Father, that obedience is
[2:08:07] better than sacrifice.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; And that, Father, we want to be obedient
[2:08:10] completely to your word. So Lord, we
[2:08:13] just pray as we go tonight, Father, that
[2:08:16] you would help us, Lord, to remember
[2:08:17] what was spoken tonight, Father, that
[2:08:20] Lord,
[2:08:22] we don't want to hide our bushel or our
[2:08:24] light, Father, under a bushel or under a
[2:08:26] our candlestick, Lord, as it were, under
[2:08:28] a bushel, Father, but rather, Lord, to
[2:08:30] have it glowing, Father, that others
[2:08:32] would see in a world of darkness,
[2:08:34] Father, that there is there is someone,
[2:08:36] Lord, that has something different. and
[2:08:38] that when people look at us, Lord,
[2:08:40] they'll see that we've been with Jesus.
[2:08:42] So, Father, once again, Lord, we ask we
[2:08:44] go tonight that you would just minister
[2:08:47] to each and every one, Father, you
[2:08:49] remember, Lord, we remember those that,
[2:08:52] Father, have that that you've had
[2:08:54] answered prayer for, Lord. And that,
[2:08:57] Father, the burdens and the the
[2:08:59] problems, Lord, that we all face,
[2:09:01] Father. Maybe we just commit all that
[2:09:03] into your hands, Father. Let the Holy
[2:09:05] Ghost lead us, Father. that the Holy
[2:09:07] Ghost minister to each and everyone. And
[2:09:10] Father, you would take care of the
[2:09:11] fires, Lord, that that are out there,
[2:09:14] Lord. And Father, so many people
[2:09:16] suffering, Father, we're praying, Lord,
[2:09:18] that you would just, Lord, in some way,
[2:09:20] Father, reach down and touch somebody,
[2:09:22] Father, and give some encouragement. So,
[2:09:24] we just bless pray your blessing upon
[2:09:27] them, Father, your blessing upon each
[2:09:28] and every one. Thank you for answering
[2:09:30] prayer, Lord, for Sister Nevas and for
[2:09:33] Sister Melody, Lord, and for all those
[2:09:35] others, Lord, that you answer prayer
[2:09:37] for. We just want to thank you. So bless
[2:09:40] us, Lord, we pray as we go tonight.
[2:09:42] Father, help us to love you, to serve
[2:09:44] you, Lord, with all of our hearts in
[2:09:46] Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen.
