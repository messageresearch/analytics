TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the devlins doing what the devil's going to do a man so brothers in it and the thing of it is it's going to be so close to it deceive the very elect a possible aim a we better be on our guards on our toes on our feet a man and and we better and this is what I want to speak on concerning leadership we better be led by the spirit we better come under God's leadership and not the devil's leadership and there are those that the brother that were under God's leadership and God blessed them and God provided for them the faith that pleased God in the day the hour the age in which they live but then there are those that are come under the leadership of the devil and thinking they're under God's leadership amen they're going to do what the devil wants them to do they're going to think the way the devil wants them to think they're going to hack the way the devil wants them to act to talk the way the devil wants of the talk amen amen and they're coming under the devils leadership and refusing the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen brother that's been the battle all the way down through from Genesis to Revelation and know he goes back beyond that it goes even even into heaven amen because where this is where the devil come from was heaven a man and he got to the place where he got lifted up in his pride and there were so many thousands of angels that followed the devil's leadership amen and God casts the devil and those angels out a man and then they come on down in this hour they came and Satan and in influencing Marian as cause man the cast got out say they hold my brother's sister what an hour that we're living but God God knew it all God is permitting it all amen to bring out a man that's what is in you to bring out what is in me to bring out what is hidden in the world of there ain't man Alleluia he what God wants to show his power is anointing his glory Israel God wants to show his attributes and to bring out his attributes in his seat amen and brother to do that he is allowed all of these things to happen he is allowing it to happen a man for a man to get down to the lowest of the low a man and he comes down with to identify with them and to bring them back up but we talk about the love of God a man I pray God in the name of Jesus then we got DD divine love a man not just human love not religious love and these things but we got divine Holy Ghost law and that by with divine Holy Ghost love we love one another we're concerned to one another we're praying for one another were burdened for one another amen hallelujah brothers sister I pray grace in the name of Jesus god help us that we're not good as Radiesse as they left their first love but in the in the last age God he got ordained the Ministry and a message to bring us back to our first law amen amen amen and brother listen they went to the extreme today the trailer finally what did it what happened they put him out of the church amen they put pray so they're gonna then and they took their stand against the believers they want to stay with the word unto finally God had to bread to send the message down to call us out amen amen to bring you out of it to bring me out of it be a man to add to it so that we are fellowship with him and he have fellowship with us amen so he would be made flesh in you and me brother sister so let's make sure that we're under the right and leadership a may and the right anointing any man with brother it's only 1 or 2 you're in either under the leadership of the an anointing of the of Jesus love of God or you're under the anointing and leadership of the devil amen and remember again that it's so close they would deceive the very elect a man but God has given us by grace the anointing to discern the right from the wrong amen you need to recognize the devil amen so that we're not going to be deceived get he behind me Satan for those savourest not the things that be of God a man so how every movie we're going to recognize you know the devil well if he's going to influence you to go to to to go back go forward a mayor that's exactly what he's going to do and he's done it in every age brother/sister he's done in Luther's age Wesley sage the Salvation Army the Pentecostal age and now he's doing it around the message the people that they came out and they and they went forward and they did this they stood for the word they stayed with the word a man their hunger and thirst was from more of God and was to please God a man but then the enemy came in and began to influence the people and it becomes a form of godliness and denying the power there are a man it is a form of godliness but denying the power of godliness denying the power of God denying the power of our Lord Jesus Christ amen Germany that's their endeavoring to make us into his image by the grace of God endeavoring to get us back to where we come from by the grace of God amen brother it's tremendous it's a UUA uragan you're going to be led by the Holy Spirit you're going to be led by the devil one or the other and that doesn't mean you're going to deny the word no the the first station deny the word they weren't denying Jesus but they had left Jesus they left her what do you mean left him they had left is influenced a man so that Christ was not influencing them everything that they were the thinking or doing or are saying in their lives because now they're under the influence of the Spirit of the Nicolaitans a man that was causing a man it was causing them to compromise a little here and a little there a man and as time went on they begin to compromise more and more and more amen and even even in Luther's age Wesley's age they eventually began to begin to go back God moved them forward for the first three or four generations and they went on with God and got closer to God and love God and they were rejoicing in the hope they made of the revelation of the word that God gave to Luther and Wesley and the benicar CIL's but again the enemy got in a and and the enemy got in to influence him this way this way that way to had a little their take away a little there Amen that he was he wasn't asking them to deny the word but he was that he was just not going to let them know just as he did in the Garden of Eden yes God said but I say unto you and he didn't he didn't leave out the word he quoted the word a man and the same thing in the first days the same thing right on down to every age they were they they had to deal with Satan quoting the word they had to do with Satan ministering the word a man Satan a whole brother's sister the grace of God to help us to recognize how deceiving it is amen and to be on our guard so make sure that they will whatever I do however I do it whenever I do it wherever I do it it's going to be the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen you know when we say it's not me that lives as Christ I live within me and if it's crazy living in me then Christ is leading me Amen I'm not following my leadership I'm not doing what I feel to do or what I want to do I'm doing what Christ wants me to do it's not me that lives his life as Christ that lives their life in me amen so brother sister go back and reflect on your life well even since you got up this morning Amen reflect on your life for the last three hours reflect on your life for the last few days Amen wasn't the leadership of the Holy Ghost in your life or whether the whether the influence of the devil that you did what you did you said what you said that you were thinking what you were thinking a man that you were acting the way that you were acting a whole brother sister Grace in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen that were we're going to be under the right leadership amen and I'll show you right now you're on you're either under the right leadership or the wrong leadership Amen the wrong leadership is going to take you into a tribulation a Great Tribulation Amen it takes something to hell and whereas the right leadership is taking us into the resurrection and the rapture is taking it into the presence of Almighty God amen so we got to make our calling and election sure by our leadership sure a mayor so that is Satan that they are not Satan but it's Jesus that's influencing me and the way that I live and the way that I think in the way that I talk and the way that I act and my attitude and my spirit amen praise the name of the Lord old brother sister let's lift me on our guard let's listen be constantly watching any man let's be constantly comparing ourselves with the Word of God judging ourselves by the word and Birdland don't please and the name of the Lord don't do what the devil would have you to do and then what would he have you to do he would have you to look into the mirror of the word amen and forget it amen oh yeah that's that's that don't don't worry about that go on a man you're saved amen don't worry what that Jesus did this Jesus did that amen oh yeah he'll give Jesus the the the preeminence for this and and the preeminence for that and so on amen but Jesus did this but Jesus did that but that's what he was doing with Eve in the Garden of Eden hey man brother the Adam was under God's leadership Eve came under the devil's leadership amen she should have one of our brothers our brother Ali preached here one time and he said he said v's that went out from when under her husband's leadership he she went out from under Adams leadership and where she shouldn't I went through that tree of knowledge of good and evil amen amen and when when that did the sermon began to deal with her and begin to reason with her Amen brother cast down reasoning and they believe the word they stay with the word line up with the word amen God is judging us by the word the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth amen any-any and he persuaded Eve he was leading me to believe the word plus he said God has said yes yes he said God has said anybody said I say unto you you shall not surely die now he wasn't denying word but he was going to head to the word and he was going to he was going to bring you to doubt a little here and question a little there a man and brother work we're in that stage right now around the message where the enemy is where the enemy is taking control and influence and a lot of believers and causing them the question the message here question it here that is to know that a man old brother/sister that's why yes why we're still here since their prophet has been gone in 1965 a man why because yes siree it is to bring out the faith that is in the bright it is to bring out a the the lack of faith that is in the in the false bright a man because there are people that profess to be the bright they're not bright a man but there is a true bright the true bride is going to stay with the word a man by the false right she's going to add to it or take away from it here and there and there there are many that are doing that today and when it comes to the message of the hour they're there and they're finding a thought we'd william branham finding this fault oh well oh he couldn't have been a prophet then that's that's why those are those are many many I have left the message in the last three years a man exactly neither and I've had to deal with him and concern concerning the the prophet and of course you know to they that they're accusing me as they accused William Branham so they're accusing brothers rural as well what they're accusing brothers rural of trying to cover up the promised mistakes as the day as the devil right here brothers they're the one to doing it a man and because he was trying to cover are the devil's the serpent was trying to cover up this and trying to cover that trying to hide this from me and to get her to believe it this way not that way a man and he said that a brother drove us in Newfoundland there and he did I lied brother mark I think as well and he said my brother-in-law Seshadri sees his preaching progressive revelation he said to hide he said and cover up the mistakes of the Prophet because they think they feel that their property you know he said this in 1963-64 65 then he said this way you know back here in 1965 5653 and why and I says progressive revelation and they didn't they didn't believe in it they believed that if he was a property with a tree he would have known owner back then and God would have revealed to him back then he would have preached the background and I said well I said brother I said I say I want to remind you I said you weren't born with grade 11 and I said you progressed into it and and their response was well brother Louis I guess we'll leave the message and that's what they did and more are also leaving the message because they're following the devil's leadership and not God's leadership but then there are other Asuma that are that are under Satan's leadership that are going to stay with the message and they're going to and they're going to interpret it and their way and believe it their way Amen em and say well this is this is what it means is it what I mean oh brother sister the scripture is clear in what what it means the scripture is clear concerning the men demanding what god has done in this hour but the messenger of Malachi 4 amen brother and is here incest alone Ian's got to descend from heaven with a shout the voice of the Archangel the Trump of God the dead in Christ shall rise first then we return live remain are going to be caught up with him to meet the Lord in the air so brother what God said God is God as son and God is doing amen so that's and that's what we're believing that's what that's what we're living for a man that's what we're testifying about a man we're not we're not looking for those looking for that where we're entering into what God has done wherever they making it flesh in you and me a man brothers sister that's what God is looking for somebody that really honestly believes it a man they don't doubt it Amen believe us now this see that was the question he in his cell phone ministry that he had the challenge Martha with Bentley this what was it it was concerning his third pole of his ministry and that was the resurrection and the rapture and now in the Alpha ministry and the third pole of his ministry in this hour now does the third pole of within Browns ministry it was the third pole of the ministry of the son of man a man concerning the resurrection and the rapture and rapturing faith now a the question is believe us now this a man praise the name of the Lord so brother Steve what God said God does and he does of the way that he says it amen but the important thing is that we got to make sure we're under the right of leadership and that are going to stay under what God said stay with what God said we're not going to head to it we're not going to take away from it amen we're going to follow God's leadership amen and it were born again and under the leadership of God brother we consider his leadership in every area of our lives amen and it's not again what I've what I want to do and it's not what I where I want to go into what what else what does God wants you to do where does God want you to go amen what and what does God wants you to say Amen praise the name of the Lord so what was for what you have done where you have gone and what you have said and what you're saying and how you're talking how you live is that the leadership of the Holy Ghost in your life is a God in your life or is it or is the Satan Amen brother God elbows because we in the first age they had the deal was Satan amen because we were warned of false prophets we're a warned of false ministries God has got it through a fivefold ministry but the devlins got a false faithful ministry amen because the Bible says even the Devils angels he said are preaching a man preaching the Bible preaching the word even the Devils angels are professing to believe this and believe that and believe the message a man brother you better be under the right anointing amen better than the seed of God under the anointing of God with the life of God in you so that God has made flesh in your and the devil not the devil there are some brother there's not not Jesus and pleasures the devil in flesh that's right amen how do you know that I know that by their attitude I know that by their spirit I know that by the motors from the objectives they got in this life I know that why by by what they're putting the emphasis on in this world amen what they're concerned about in this world amen they're more concerned about the natural things than they are about the spiritual whereas if we are the Bride of Christ under the leadership of the Holy Ghost whether we're just concerned about God what do you want me to do Lord where do you want me to go what would you want me to say I want to do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen brother again that's there again they get you consumed and then to - to what Paul said it's not me that leaves us Christ liveth in me that's tremendous a man is not just by the doctrine and the letter of the word but it's the word himself it's the word himself in you it's the word himself living in you is the word himself controlling you a man again as John said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us now the word is flesh in us a man because he has been moving by measure more and more and more and more until under the fullness of the Godhead bodily is in the brain brother it took the fullness of the Godhead bodily in the flesh called Jesus - what for - lay down his wave and pick it up again amen all the prophets were prophesying they had the power of God they had anointing of God but they lay down their lives but couldn't make a living here amen oh yeah some of them even even raised the dead but again when they died they they they're the wait on God amen praise the name of the Lord brother brother he is lay down their lives and they died but God in the again the God had ordained a resurrection and a rapture so a man according to the scriptures he would be made flesh in the bread amen what a tremendous revelation of Christ when the Bible says he shall descend from heaven with a shout Amen the voice of the Archangel message a man is going to be a message and what it's going to be the results of that message it's going to be the resurrection that any Christ will rise first then we which are alive remain are going to be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air amen but as I've already emphasized we're going to me to me in the cloud of angels the probably of God was caught up into that cloud and though the bride is going to be caught up into that cloud a million but brother we've got to make sure that we're under the right leadership run to the leadership of the Holy Ghost not the devil as I said the Holy Ghost wants to wants us to stay with the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth don't answer it don't take from it don't interpret it your way you let God interpret it in and through your life amen praise the name of the Lord but the devil is there to interpret it he wants to hand to it he wants to change any air changer there and I'll tell you oh yeah you better be careful because the God got his servants out there preaching and the devil got it got his servants of there pretreat amen and it's going to be so closer to see the very elect amen say it's Satan is going to have a brother of their ministry nor testifying and God is going to have a brother a son of the son of their daughter they're testifying of the word the truth amen my then it's going to be the truth and is there going to be a reflection of the life that they're living but the devil amen the Satan is going to be in some of their - he's got sons and daughters out there he made the devil's got him out there and he is going to use them amen oh yeah to preach the message but it's going to be just a little different yes God said but say again as I said by the we got a stay with the word when we first came into it it's not again as I did I did do it and you're familiar with it well and it's a brother we all know now that they printed this certain article a number of years ago and and when I received it in the mail their loot letter their newsletter in the mail and I saw it and I read it and I was shocked and I said oh my I picked up the phone right away and call him and I said brother do you know what you've done you've done this you've done this as you should have included I said some more so other thoughts other than that night and I just just go just say this and say that and leave oh this and leave oh there you should have been cluded this other and so on I saw brother I said you you you've been proved what what it was and want see what it was but I said you're going to improve I said well really unbelief I've seen in certain things the Prophet is said amen and then and that brother and the sister they were professing believers they are professing believers and so on and they and they were oh yeah everybody were honored them and respected them and so on you know and but but they yeah part of the influence assists I pray God they repented because I saw brother don't do that I said you got to change this don't do it anybody and I already got a couple of other things to them and so on and I trust by the grace of God they repented of it amen so there it's for that right so that they're going to be proved that they're led by the Holy Ghost brother do to it to add a word to had to change something the Prophet said and explained it in a in a different way so as to allow us to do this and this and this brother that's the devil that's Satan's leadership amen oh yeah and Satan is is God delete got his leadership in a lot of believers today a lot of brothers not a sister's just a way they're acting the way they're talking their attitudes their spirits and even sometimes the way that they dress and the way they oh yeah there's there's many many men many under that influence and they think oh well you know what like they said oh well as long as I got long haired that no make a difference you know I can do it this way I can do it that way the prophet of God said he said you sisters I taught I told you in the message how can I overcome he preached at Branham tabernacle he said he said and he was talking to the sisters and brought him down a couple he said you didn't realize he said long hair looks so nice did you and he said that's why I said you want to do this with it and you want to do that with it you want to do something else with it he said why he's because you're ashamed he said of the of the spare tire on your head and the bun oh yeah why said what so whatever influence is that now Satan he said you want to be like your denominational sisters that's right they weren't dressed like their denominational sisters didn't want to act like the denominational sisters and still say they believe the message still go to a message church amen still maybe I have some books in there but message books in their house or whether or a Bible whatever amen oh brother don't they'll lift up their eyes in hell like the rich young ruler you know brother Rams text in the message he preached leadership he preached the message December the 7th 1965 in California and his text I was surprised his text concerned the rich young ruler amen he refused God's leadership he refused Jesus leadership but he took the devil's leadership amen jesus said do this this and this he said I've done that all my all my life come the commandments and Jesus and the Bible says Jesus loved him but he said one thing you liked how many things do we like a man there's one thing that Jesus saw in his life that was the leadership of the devil what does God see in your life go today when it comes to attitude and spirit well as God seeing you in me when it comes to an edit and again it comes to it really comes down to the your editor than your spirit a million when it comes to the works rather when it comes to the works or conversation or words it's the result of an attitude or your spirit yeah what does the person talk like this what do they act like that it's an attitude and a spirit that's influencing you amen you no matter how much you say you believe in your head God looks into your heart hey man no matter how much that rich young ruler said he believed this in his head and he and he obey the word he obeyed the word he obey the word well here was the word of flesh and he said one thing y'all like us why because he discerned something in his soul anybody it has earned something in his spirit amen he said I want you to go sell all you got and give to the poor and he said come follow me what Lord I kept I keep your word I believe your word I do this I do this I do this as I've said I said you know from my youth up and now you want me to sell all I got and give to the poor come follow you he was testing his spirit of sacrifice the seal far he was willing to go with God to see if he would be truly led by the Spirit of God and he refused and always struck him so hard that he turned and he walked away from Jesus but he lifted up his eyes in hell he never dreamed that probably God said no doubt he said he said when when when when he died he had he had the biggest funeral he said anybody would have he said because of who he was because of his influence on the world and in the world and so on and he's Lazarus died they just took him out just maybe threw his body into into it into the place for the slaves oh yeah but the rich young ruler no doubt he got it all they got up and praised his name they gave him a high you know reputation and so on oh yeah but where was he spiritually he was in hell crying screaming where as Lazarus was in the bosom of Abraham Oh does your life reflect Lazarus spirit or does it reflect the spirit of the rich young ruler Amen because what your life reflects is an indication of the leadership your honor oh yeah what you doing how you do it when you do it as I said where you do it it shows you oh my we make decisions sometimes and brother I'll tell you this is not Jesus decision it's the devil's decision you know why because we're it's based on our feelings it's based on our emotions it's based on our senses but not on our faith sons and daughters of God are led by the Spirit of God brother let's not deny the leadership of Jesus Oh what when I believe this doctrine that doctrine no no you still it's not just a word there and we're in in in letter in a book it's the Word made flesh in you to accomplish what he wants to accomplish now brother don't don't go back let's go forward this day under the leadership of the Holy Ghost by the grace of Almighty God and the Prophet is bringing it out we need this right leadership to get to the rapture now Lazarus would make it to the rapture but the returner wouldn't those were caught up with this world and the things of this world they're not gonna make it in a resurrection or a rapture no way where is where is God hidden and God revealed in some you got Elvis we had to be certain we get it right make sure we got the right leadership as the powder God said in 1964 he said now my subject this morning I trust that God will reveal this and each time if you who take the tapes and listen and I open trust that you have had spiritual understanding amen yes spiritual understanding what God who God is where God is what God's doing what God requires of us now I've got an intellectual understanding or God wants us to leave the denominational Creason and believe the the word God once want you to surrender so he can make the word living living you amen he said I try open trust that you have had spiritual understanding many of intellectual understanding and are spiritual and he sort of one God has been trying to get over to the church without saying it right out catch the revelation in your heart and in your yeah not your head but in your heart you know what God is doing because it's raised here in the word and he said see he said we have to say things in such a way that it might thin down I believe brother our brother Jonathan brought it out any man concerning Jesus had too many disciples and they weren't all true believers some were led by the spirit others were led by the devil so Jesus and said except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you know what how come we eat your flesh and drink your blood by eating and drinking the word but they didn't know that they rebuked that they said it who can receive this and they and this seventy walked away how many preachers would cut down under their congregation by preaching the truth the whole truth amen even brother BAM did that because he preached Church one and when he preached Church horde there was a lot left random Tabernacle yeah and when he got into preaching this message in how can I overcome he said I know he said you're thinking how much longer are you gonna keep preaching that brother round he said I'm gonna keep preaching until you stop doing it amen and again others got up and left the church you mean yet believing that he was a prophet but you know what they wanted BAM tell you know what the trouble he had in Brown Tabernacle one of the problems he was dealing with they wanted they wanted him to go back to the signs and wonders they wanted to go back to the - you know the sign in his hand and discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart well he was but now he was responding by giving them the word Amen not just responding say you're thinking this and you're thinking that no no he gave them the word for everyday living not just for this issue in their life for that issue in their life but for to control them in every everything because there's alternate there's still a lot of believers doing what they want to do how they want to do it when they want to do it where they want to do it oh I like this I like this what does he like they never stopped to consider Jesus do you like this Lord Jesus is this pleasing to You Lord Lord forgive me if did I do anything wrong today Lord forgive me people a lot of you were just considered themselves Christians and you just go and do what they want to do you know this this and this because getting we're getting in a world now brother sister yeah there's no sin the people don't consider this sin that's seen there anything seen and and even a lot of believers they did to them there's no sin unless you don't don't believe this don't believe it this way if you don't believe it that way or that's in believe it if you believe it you can go and live it it reflect itself in you well I tell you it's getting to that place where there's nothing to sin anymore it's a deception of the devil they're following Satan's leadership and you better be careful even even with with with with cell phones there there there are people out there in the world that arise in judgment against believers now because even even again just recently I just say another another gentleman as through the cell phone away he got rid of it no because it was affecting his life and and he said this is not normal and we're not living in a normal world people think they got we got to have a cell phone we think we got it we got to be there so you can contact me anywhere anytime and so on know if Jesus was there I don't think he would even want a cell phone no and Jesus is there and this this brother got rid of his cell phone through that and brother it's it's the leadership of the devil in in technology in science it's the rear so the devil in and listen please in the name of Jesus leadership of the devil even in the internet please don't don't ignore it be on your guard oh yes Satan you talk about the Bible tells us they're gonna be false prophets false apostles false teachers and and brother they're all over the world on the Internet be on your guard and there's a lot of heat even don't don't think because oh this is a message preacher that's the message preached a sermon don't think because oh you identified with the message that is it could be Satan you know is that is that ministry or that church under God's leadership or under Satan's leadership you better and I will I determine it judge it by the word bring it back to the word not just all what the preacher said but what about the congregation is it bringing out the word into people more and more and more brothers sister it is a world where there's no more sin the bride is going to recognize the end but the world in general doesn't recognize sin anymore because everybody is doing everything god have mercy on us to make sure that it is striking us right he said we have to say it in such a way that it might thin down and yet there people want bigger churches and as I said the prophet of God spoke encouraged the pastor's of small churches he said don't be discouraged he said that's what God's going to use because if the rapture comes and it goes and the nobody will know only those that went until it'll take time and and they'll recognize Oh surely where's the rapture and that'll be a there's gonna be a lot of messy churches I've said that in 84 when I preached in Brother Folgers I said listen after brides gone they'll still be preaching Malachi 4 yeah I preached that in brother fortress 1984 and after the brides gone they'll still be preaching Malachi 4:2 God has sent a prophet and there's many big members of big churches they're gonna be wondering where's the rapture already happened didn't know it why because they were they were worldly and they were led by the devil not dead by Jesus so we have to say it in such a way they might thin down it might bring some to go out and it has some delay and some to ponder over but he said that's done purposely it must be done that way and some would say you mean God would purposely do a thing like that he certainly did and he does it yet today amen it's proving the leadership in the individuals life amen again in Revelation 3 we reference revelation to the first stage and the finally comes down to the last stage and the conclusion and the results of Satan's leadership what about the beginning and end of your life amen [Music] you can begin with God and in with the devil because I reach our ruler began with God and ended with the devil oh yeah Lazarus no maybe he but maybe he began with the devil and ended up with God his faith was in God he trusted God he loved God a man and brother the church came to the place where it eventually where had lost its love for Jesus now we see the proof of it because Jesus was put out and in verse 14 he said under the Angel of the Church of the Laodiceans write these things say the Amen that means the conclusion is the end the faithful and true witness meaning that there is a false witness in the church the faithful and true witness and the beginning hallelujah the beginning of the creation of God amen we're going from time to eternity wonderful and he said I know thy works not just a church remember the church is made up of people individuals in the church he's not referring to the building but those in the building amen he said I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot he meant he knew the works of the first-stage and comes right on down to the last stage he said you're not cold and you're not on amen I would that thou wert cold or hot so then because there are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew you or spit you out of my mouth and got lot goddess bit out of his mouth and their witnesses for the church they go to oh yeah they're witnesses now don't be a witness for the preacher be a witness for Jesus amen be a witness for Jesus and people are witnesses for their preachers oh yeah that's the truth brother they'll highlight this preacher I laid that preacher and put this one up but that one not another one no where's Jesus oh my no wonder the promise says you're gonna be surprised who made it and who didn't make it and God looked for it God looks for sincerity anything God looked for is humility amen those that are humble and sincere they're not looking for attention they're not looking to be to be to be to be I light it or I'll hell of a tit up and exalted no let's exalt Jesus this give Jesus the glory the praise and the honor in our lives amen in our testimony our witness everything is Jesus it's like I've been praying that the grace of God and the conviction of the Holy Ghost in a sister of another church that right right now maybe in palliative care in the Miller center and I've witnessed to her concerning the word because they belong to a certain church that don't believe in a certain thing and I said you don't believe this no and I said but let me give you the scripture it's a church that doesn't believe in music because they feel that a music affects the people emotionally I can begin god uses music and so I gave scripture and I said I said right here and I think it's in the Book of Kings and I said the the ruler sent them to get this prophet that was separated from the other prophets oh the 400 prophets said this well go and see what this prophet says and so they went to talk to him and before he gave them the word of the Lord he called for a musician and the Bible tells us that when the musician played that the Spirit of the Lord came on the Prophet a man and he had thus saith the Lord now I said that scripture eyes his sister but they wouldn't take it so I've been praying as Lord maybe you'll convict our sister I said at this hour that she'll repent they may not saying that she's bright but that praying the grace of God that she would make it if she repented Norden forgive me a man she knows myself and sister Betty you know we've had fellowship you know the grace of God brother please make your calling and election sure you gotta make sure whose leadership you're under and it can be so simple it can be a very basic thing a very simple thing because she like I said Jesus only he's told to rich and ruler one thing that he wanted him to do well a couple of things he said sell what you got and come follow me Jesus had a reasonably to bring to say that and and God got a reason sometimes to require this of you or to cause the pastors say something or some other brother ministering brothers say something to bring out your attitude that's not my attitude Jesus were looking to say that's not my attitude you've got you got a wrong anointing if you had to write an onion you leaven well you would have my my my anointing you'd have my attitude oh yeah so we're not gonna think like God or like the devil rather we want to think like God yeah act like God we're gonna have the same attitude toward the things of life that God would have a man how many of us would would be sorrow like the rich young ruler if Jesus come have told you sell what you got and come follow me what do you mean well I just want you to just keep what you need and help help your brothers and sisters with the rest grace Strait is the gate narrow is the way a few there be that find it because most everybody they're working for themselves living for themselves prospering for themselves and so on and want this I want that oh it is good and I won't have to worry about this I wanted to worry about that worry well God gives faith to take worry away amen all brothers sister there are so many believers that worry that that's a proof that's an indication that you don't have any faith wow they're afraid of this and afraid of that don't be afraid of anything listen just be content and because whatever you get in life well Lord your will be done I'm on my way home to be with you and Lord I got to all mine but you putted it make sure you got lots in the bank in heaven where the thieves won't break through and steal well in this age and at this time and in this place thieves are breaking through and stealing and brother that's what's going to happen as I said you'll wake up one morning and you want on anything I say the government have taken as collateral for the Antichrist oh yeah that's coming God's going to test your faith I tell you brother more ways than one God's going to test your faith he's allowing all this to happen in the world testing your faith testing your leadership see if you're under the leadership of the Holy Ghost or the devil hey man god help us so he said I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou wert cold or out for them because there are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth hmm amazing Ted the Bible says the love of many shall wax cold deceiving and being deceived or these are even more deceiving under greater deception lukewarm they're not here they're not there hey man but I tell you God knows who they are God knows their attitude God knows their spirit yeah praise the Lord because there are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew or spit you out of my mouth because I'll say I am rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest not oh we don't need anything but God said you don't know that you're wretched we see ourselves as the good good condition everything's going fine God says what what leadership were you under you think that you think everything is fine he said your wretched knowing that is you're miserable and he said you're poor and blind and naked now what leadership is that under and the thing of it is they didn't know it they didn't know it they thought everything was fine they you know whatever they thought their relationship with God was fine God has blessed us and God has done this and God has done that sometimes God takes away things from us rather than give it to us you'll take it away but the devil would give to give it to you well he promised to Jesus he's although he said Oh God he said worship me said no I'll give all these kingdoms to you I'll give all this to you what because it Adam and Eve sold it out to the devil and he was gonna give it Jesus Jesus knew he's going to inherit it you know three rebuked the devil listen Saints don't go by what Satan says I'm gonna hire you if you go this way go that way all you'll be you'll be a lot better have about better life in this world well I'm not worried about this world I'm gonna have a wonderful life in the world at all I'm gonna have a body like his glorified body hallelujah I'm gonna sit with him in his strong hey man praise the name of the Lord you just make sure you're led by his spirit a man and he said I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou may us be rich and white raiment that thou mayst be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and knowing thy noise with I say that thou may SC see as God sees a man and be clothed with the righteousness of God amen the glory of God as many as I love I rebuke and chasten he meant amazing be zealous therefore and repent make sure you get back under his leadership if you feel that Satan is influencing you with his leadership this rebuked the devil and get back under God's leadership a man a man time is passing and I got another five scriptures and we don't we'll get into it later but let me finish with this that it was not until about 11 o'clock last night that the Lord laid out on my heart to minister on the subject of leadership to get the Saints to to challenge the Saints to take into consideration what leadership they're under and what Spirit is leading them amen there was a couple of other subjects that I was considering but the Lord finally in his word laid subject of leadership come on my heart and I have scriptures here from the Old Testament and the New Testament concerning leadership the Prophet ministered on this subject in 1965 in California and considering the hour in which we live this is a serious subject considering the last days the believers are warned that false leaders and leadership would prevail to the extent that it would deceive the very elect if possible and such deceit causes man to serve God country to the correct will of God that's right they're serving God contrary to is correct will there's the Provost said you're trying to do God a service without his will why because you're under the wrong leadership make sure that what you feel led to do that it's God leading you and not Satan it was God leading Eve or the devil leading need not say not not not God make sure it's God leading you and the first Adam put himself in sin with the first Eve trusting that in redeeming him God would redeem her amen and the second Adam he put himself down to be tested in all points like as we are yet without sin laying down his life shedding his innocent blood for you and me amen so that amen laying down his life of picking it up again he would redeem you and me Amen because we are his bride by the grace of God so there are false leaders and leadership's that are prevailing to the extent that is deceiving the very elect if possible such deceit causes man to serve God contrary to the correct will of God his man as the Bible says doing what's right in their own eyes religiously but they feel this is what I should do this is how I should do it and so on no you gotta be led by the spirit most definitely we have to make sure that the leader you are following is under the true anointing of the Holy Ghost keeping us in line with the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth to give us the faith that is pleasing to God the faith that we need for the rapture a man and as I said right here we'll get to it later the Lord has led me to six scripture references highlighting God's leadership among his seed and the scripture the Prophet used in his message puts the emphasis on the supreme leader amen he's not you he's not your neighbors not your friend it's Christ amen supreme leadership and before he got into his message he made this statement he said I have a message I feel from God is at the beginning of the leadership message he said it's a little odd to some people and he said I just got to be what I am and he said I don't mean to be different it's just that I'm living at a changing time and we are what would he say today concerning the world that he was experiencing then in 65 what would he say today in 2019 brother I pray that that we got a greater concern over what's going on than what the world worldly people have and what science has for these last few days I have witnessed things that are going on in this world that's bringing scientists - attention they're recognizing that there are things going on just destroying the world there are things going on that's going to make this world impossible to live in that's why a God is going to create a new heaven and a new earth but there have been references even in the news concerning the poison in the atmosphere there been references concerning the global climate they says the climate changes and everything is changing the weather is not what it used to be around the world was it a global warming climate for years they just made light of it and they felt that it there was no significance to it but now they're beginning to recognize that there is a global warming and it's causing a lot of problems a lot of trouble amen we're here by the grace of God please let's honor and respect His grace they saw none respect him and humble ourselves that goddess reminded us of these things there they're looking at what they're seeing what they're experiencing out there but you and I are believing the word thus saith the Lord we knew all this was coming that in certain countries in certain areas of the world that people were going around with masks over their face what or trying to avoid the poisoning of the vehicles that are driving around constantly don't you think that's not having an effect on the world we're living in what the what those motors are putting out where's all the gas going it's going out into the atmosphere and now that they violated the fact in the news concerning certain areas now where people go around with mud mask over their face because of the what they feel is the poison coming out of the out of the vehicles and not only that we know that the weather is changing and again even our weather is changing and but there's also been a news item concerning germs and it's I told you just recently that it's not the new new diseases but the old diseases and there there are many many many hard to believe I you know when it comes to naturally speaking that there's so many that are that are under the influence of of the old diseases tuberculosis one and other old diseases that thousands are that are influenced and under the under the under the influence and many have died it's time to go home not in this community but to heaven it's time to go to glory amen so brother sister is serious but I trust that you're gonna live by faith you're trusting Jesus amen so the germ warfare of all of the old diseases are striking humans and thousands have died in certain parts of the world but to our right again though I did tell you some time long time ago that they're not going they're not going to be more open with that information because they don't want to stir the people up there's like certain scientists they give the government's reports they contact the government and says that well what do you want us to say and how do you want us to say it well I'll just say what is the truth no the government wants it said in such a way so as not to stir the people so you keep pleading the token life of the blood of Jesus for your life that were under the token Lord so the devil is not going to attack us with these germ warfare amen so make sure you're under his leadership it's serious you mean to tell me that we're going to look out here and we're going to see people in affected with old-fashioned germs diseases that they had years ago yes because the Prophet prophesied a germ warfare and and I said O Lord I said all of these things I'm hearing this last few days I said is the prophesies of what a Brenham coming to pass it's later than you think and they're talking about the negative effects of scientific technology in the atmosphere around the world they talked about gases other things coming out of planes and again even the vehicles down here and and and fire everything if there's a fire where it's the smoke go it's getting worse and worse don't think well that's just a fire down there in the south somewhere that's just a fire in British Columbia that's just a fire somewhere else noise getting worse it says mysterious clouds produced when aircraft inadvertently causes rain or snow that's been in just recently in the news mysterious clouds produced when aircraft inadvertently he said causes rain or snow I remember one time at home look at the window and it was it's not supposed to be snowing but it wasn't I heard a plane go over and it started to snow and the plane went on then it stopped it's snowing and then after another while I just hear playing goal snow I said Lord I said what's going on it's the end don't think don't think the world's getting better the world's worse it'll pass away and it says pollution from Asia is circling the globe global warming affecting certain areas of the earth they said it's a reality whereas for a number of years they denied it made light of it but now they're acknowledging it's a reality they said it's affecting the atmosphere around the earth and he says affect him evenly I beyond the earth even the moon you know they're bringing they're bringing out these warnings global warming affecting certain areas of the earth and there's also another issue concerning the wireless technology in the atmosphere again that's like the cellphones and everything else amen well it's like the man said that he turned his TV on one time and there was a program come on he said where in the world that come from that program it had not been on television for years so he called somebody about it always said that's he said it's still out there and he said it's going through the going through the atmosphere and he said just so happened he said that your television must have caught it and he says y-you saw it but then when it passed us on he wouldn't catch it no more maybe somebody else would god help us got it lord help us to be sincere help us to believe this is the end Albus to believe Lord that our new bodies are just right there waiting for us to step into them he said I don't mean to be different I'm living at a changing time and as long as you're building the wall one straight way it's all fine the bricklayers can go right straight on down the roll but when you have to turn the corner and he said we're not building a wall we are building a house and he said so those turns as to come he said they come in the age of Martin Luther John Wesley the Pentecostal age now it's here again and it's hard to turn corners but I'm thankful to God even though I rough it's been the people has responded 100% so where we are very grateful to each one of you amen let's get ready to turn the corner amen by the grace of Almighty God let's if we're gonna do God a service let's make sure it's under his leadership and it's according to his will it's what God wants to do when God wants to do it and how God wants to do it brothers sister God's grace for his will in our lives he's my prayer that we have his leadership amen not the devil's leadership god bless you let's tan they're saying only trust in people wanted to enjoy this world people want to enjoy this natural life but it's getting worse amen it's getting to a place where there's nothing there to be nothing else nothing to enjoy hanging but God has given us the promise of his word amen the only real joy is in glory the only real joy is in Jesus amen so god help us brother sister that we're not going to be deceived by the devil a man to seek and then try to enjoy the things of the world no no just get out of here and this getting into the kingdom of God into the glory of God amen and amen to sit with him in his strong coming wonderful praise the Lord this thing it only trust him come every soul by sin oppress there's mercy with the Lord and He will surely
