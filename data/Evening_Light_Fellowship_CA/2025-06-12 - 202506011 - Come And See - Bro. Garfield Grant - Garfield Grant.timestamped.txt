[16:17] some prayer requests. Sister Justine
[16:20] passed this in. This is a lady named
[16:22] Rose, a friend of a customer of hers
[16:24] who's dealing with an aggressive form of
[16:26] stage three uh osteo saroma. By God's
[16:31] grace, she's a Christian. She's
[16:33] believing for her healing. Her numbers
[16:35] have gone down, which is good. Her
[16:37] body's responding well to the chemo. We
[16:39] just pray that God will continue to give
[16:40] her strength and strengthen her faith as
[16:42] she's having a hard time. So, grace to
[16:44] her. this a lady named Rose. I continue
[16:47] to pray for brother Dale. Uh Sister
[16:50] Brenda, want to keep her in prayer with
[16:52] her need.
[16:54] Um Sister Lorie Snow, I meant to send an
[16:57] update today and just got interrupted
[16:59] and and didn't do it. But uh there was a
[17:01] testimony. Thank the Lord she's able to
[17:04] uh use the bathroom on her own which was
[17:07] uh a big concern of theirs and and
[17:09] certainly for her. So, it was just
[17:10] wonderful to hear that and trusting, you
[17:12] know, she's going through rehab now and
[17:14] that she's going to relearn how to walk
[17:15] and those things. So, step by step,
[17:18] she's uh she's getting her her answer.
[17:20] So, we praise the Lord for that. Uh
[17:22] continue to pray for brother Gourd Snow,
[17:24] Sister Cordella, and Brother Nelson Guy.
[17:28] Let's sing u pray for me. I'm just
[17:31] getting over a flu here. So,
[17:34] we pray uh we just want to sing the ver
[17:36] first verse again. Uh sorry, the second
[17:38] verse. when I am alone. And brother John
[17:41] is going to pray for us um after we sing
[17:43] this.
[17:46] When I
[17:48] am alone.
[17:53] When I
[17:55] am alone.
[17:59] Oh, when I am alone,
[18:06] give me Jesus.
[18:13] Give me Jesus.
[18:16] [Music]
[18:20] Give me Jes
[18:21] [Music]
[18:29] all this world.
[18:33] But give me Jesus.
[18:45] Amen. I asked Brother Joe to let me pray
[18:47] tonight because we had a testimony we
[18:49] wanted to give. As some of you probably
[18:50] would have seen, Blanca came up for
[18:51] prayer on Sunday for her father. Her
[18:54] father just turned 84 this week and he'd
[18:56] been going in or he's had prostate
[18:58] cancer for quite a while and he went in
[19:00] for chemotherapy. So, she came up for
[19:01] prayer for him. So, he just finished
[19:03] five rounds of that this week with not a
[19:05] single side effect, not a single
[19:07] problem, nothing. It was as if he never
[19:09] had it done in the first place. So, we
[19:11] want to thank the Lord for that. Amen.
[19:13] Amen. That's a wonderful thing for an 84
[19:15] year old to go through something that
[19:16] intense day after day, one after the
[19:19] other. So, we just want to thank the
[19:20] Lord for that. Amen. We want to testify
[19:22] of his goodness, for answered prayer.
[19:24] Amen. As we remember these needs, let's
[19:26] bow our heads. Lord Jesus,
[19:30] Lord, we want to come in this evening
[19:31] saying thank you. Lord, we want to thank
[19:33] you for answered prayer. Lord, we want
[19:36] to thank you for a word of promise
[19:37] you've given us, Lord. That for
[19:39] everything we have need of, Lord, it's
[19:41] found in your salvation. Lord, it's
[19:43] deliverance, its healing, its
[19:44] restoration, its redemption, Lord, it's
[19:47] provision, its leadership, Lord. All
[19:49] that we have need of is found in your
[19:51] salvation tonight, Lord, by your word.
[19:53] And so, we're thankful this evening,
[19:55] Lord, for the testimony we have, Lord,
[19:57] for Sister Lorie Snow. Lord, how
[19:59] thankful we are. Lord, they said she
[20:01] wouldn't do it and she's doing it. Lord,
[20:03] they said she wouldn't do it and she did
[20:04] it. Lord, how good you have been and
[20:06] we're trusting you once again, Lord, to
[20:08] undertake on her behalf as she learns
[20:10] how to walk, Lord, and get back to life.
[20:12] We're trusting you, Lord, to do a
[20:14] finishing work in her life, Lord. We're
[20:16] thankful for answered prayer, Lord, for
[20:18] for Brother Navis, Lord. Lord, and we're
[20:21] asking your grace, Lord, for those that
[20:22] are having needs, Lord, tonight, Lord.
[20:24] Whether it's cancer, whether it's
[20:26] sickness, whether it's hardship, Lord,
[20:28] whatever it might be, Lord, we're
[20:29] raising our voices to you, Lord. We're
[20:31] looking to your throne of grace and
[20:33] saying, "Lord, we're trusting you and
[20:34] believing you this evening, Lord." So we
[20:37] pray you touch each one, Lord. Be in
[20:38] this service, Lord, from the start to
[20:40] the finish, Lord. May your word just
[20:42] take over, Lord, through your spirit,
[20:44] Lord, that you would move into our
[20:45] lives, Lord. Shape us, Lord, draw us
[20:47] closer to you, Lord. May you just do
[20:49] wonderful things in our midst, Lord. May
[20:51] we just have a recognition, Lord, of
[20:53] your presence here this evening. We pray
[20:55] in Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen.

[25:04] alone.
[25:08] by the dew
[25:11] is still on the rose.
[25:16] [Music]
[25:18] And the voice
[25:21] I hear
[25:24] falling on
[25:26] my ear.
[25:29] The son
[25:32] of God
[25:34] discloses
[25:40] and
[25:42] he walks
[25:45] with me and he talks
[25:50] with me
[25:52] and he tells
[25:55] me I am his Oh,
[26:03] and the joy
[26:05] we share
[26:08] as we t
[26:12] there.
[26:14] None other
[26:16] has ever
[26:19] known. Man, thank you, Lord.
[26:24] He speaks and the sound of his voice
[26:34] it is so sweet.
[26:37] The birds hush their singing
[26:44] and the me
[26:50] that he gave
[26:52] to me
[26:55] within
[26:57] my heart. Thank you, Lord.
[27:01] Amen.
[27:06] Hey And he walks

[27:49] I'd stay in the garden
[27:54] with him.
[28:00] Though the night
[28:03] around me
[28:05] be falling,
[28:10] but he beat
[28:13] me goal
[28:15] through the voice
[28:18] of war.
[28:21] His voice
[28:23] to me
[28:26] is calling
[28:32] and
[28:34] he walks

[29:14] [Music]
[30:06] [Music]
[30:17] [Music]
[30:27] throughout my years from a little child.
[30:32] I can honestly say God has stay.
[30:38] Although I didn't claim him as my Lord,
[30:43] he led me from rebellion
[30:46] to his word. And I could hear a distant
[30:51] voice calling me home. He's never left
[30:57] me alone.
[31:03] And since I walked in his glorious
[31:07] light, Satan battles and I am in a
[31:11] constant fight. But the Lord, he still
[31:15] helps me to overcome.
[31:18] He knows the pressure that's been left
[31:21] on the bride.
[31:24] Each day is another step closer home.
[31:29] He's been there every day. He's never
[31:34] left me alone.
[31:37] [Music]
[31:39] He's always been there.
[31:45] He's always fighting.
[31:48] [Music]
[31:50] He knew every heartache
[31:55] that I been through.
[32:01] He knew the pain and despair.
[32:07] He heard each tear. Drop that fell. Oh,
[32:13] I thank God
[32:17] he never left me alone.
[32:24] In the darkness of the midnight that old
[32:27] Satan comes around. He says, "You're
[32:30] losing the battle. You're gaining
[32:33] ground." But just as I'm giving up, I
[32:37] hear that same voice. It's saying,
[32:40] "Crot, I will lift up your sword."
[32:45] And through the word, I can hear him
[32:49] say, "I will never leave you fighting
[32:53] alone."
[32:57] He's always been there.
[33:03] He's always fighting.
[33:08] He knew every heartache
[33:12] that I been through.
[33:18] He knew the pain and despair.
[33:24] He heard each tear drop that fell. Oh, I
[33:30] thank God.
[33:33] He's never left me alone.
[33:40] And since I walked in this glorious
[33:44] light, Satan battles and I am in a
[33:48] constant fight. But the Lord, he still
[33:52] helps me to overcome. He knows the
[33:55] pressure that's been left on the bride.
[34:00] Each day is another step closer home.
[34:05] He's been there every day. He's never
[34:09] left me alone.
[34:15] In the darkness of the midnight, that
[34:18] old Satan comes around. He says, "You're
[34:20] losing the battle. You're not gaining
[34:24] ground." And just as I'm giving up, I
[34:28] hear that same voice. It's crying,
[34:30] "Child,
[34:32] pick up your sword."
[34:35] And through the word, I can hear him
[34:39] say, "I will never leave you fighting
[34:43] alone."
[34:47] He's always been there.
[34:51] [Music]
[34:53] He's always fighting.
[34:58] He heard every heartache
[35:02] that I build through.
[35:08] He knew the pain and despair.
[35:13] He heard each tear drop that fell. Oh, I
[35:20] thank God
[35:23] he never left me alone.
[35:28] He's always been there.
[35:33] He's always fighting.
[35:38] He heard every heartache
[35:42] that I been through.
[35:48] He knew the pain and despair.
[35:53] He heard each tear drop that fell.
[35:59] Oh, I thank God. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[36:03] Lord. You never left me alone.

[46:52] such reassurance, Lord,
[46:56] because Lord God of the world that you
[46:58] have placed upon our hearts.

[47:10] more than able to do exactly what you
[47:12] promise,
[47:14] oh God, as your children this evening,
[47:16] Lord God, we lay our lives before you.
[47:19] And Lord God, in our hearts, Lord God,
[47:22] we're crying, Lord God, a call of
[47:25] desperation, a call, hallelujah, that
[47:28] only can be answered, oh God, by your
[47:31] hands this evening,
[47:33] Lord God. And so God, the greatest we
[47:36] can do this evening, Lord God, is to
[47:38] surrender our lives, Lord God, to Lord
[47:40] God, to give ourself, Lord God, into
[47:42] your hands this evening, Lord,
[47:45] Lord God, may you come of the sea, Lord
[47:47] God. And Lord, it's such a terrible
[47:50] time. It's such a time of of war and and
[47:52] struggles.

[48:11] presence, Lord. Lord God, may you lead
[48:14] us through, oh God, this valley of Lord
[48:17] God. David called out the shadow of
[48:19] death, Lord. Lord God, but he declares
[48:22] it. But I will fear it all evil.
[48:24] Hallelujah.
[48:26] And ah Hallelujah. Yes, Lord. Glory to

[48:46] We are not worthy, Lord God. We there's
[48:48] not one of us, oh God. There's no
[48:49] righteousness that we can present this
[48:51] evening, oh God. Our lives, oh God,
[48:54] testify, oh God, of the hill where, oh
[48:56] God, and how much we have fallen short
[48:58] of your glory, but oh God, but Lord God,

[49:26] we pray and we say amen
[49:30] and amen.
[49:32] Ain't God good.
[49:34] Praise God.
[49:37] Just I'm happy to be here.
[49:40] One more time to be standing here. I say
[49:43] at my point of duty it's it's a
[49:47] responsibility for you know for the
[49:50] people of God for especially you know
[49:52] God puts you in a position to preach you
[49:54] know it's a responsibility you know to
[49:57] stand in that position and to declare
[49:58] the word of God. Amen. And you know as
[50:01] brother John said Sunday you know we are
[50:04] a servant for the people. There's no big
[50:07] me here or little you there. So you are
[50:10] the bigger ones really cuz we are
[50:12] serving you. Amen. Amen. Praise God. And
[50:16] you know um tonight we would like to um
[50:21] look in this on this message. I preached
[50:24] it some time ago back home you know and
[50:27] um it's something that I seen in the
[50:29] message you know and I have taken a a
[50:33] position you know where to believe that
[50:35] this message is real you know it holds
[50:38] the reality of God and you know and um I
[50:42] I've taken an attitude to put my life on
[50:45] the line for this really you know uh the
[50:48] greatest that I have is is who I am
[50:50] really so I put it on the line for for
[50:52] the word of God for the testimony of
[50:54] Jesus Christ, you know. So you pray for
[50:57] me tonight as we as we turn our Bibles
[51:00] together to the book of St. Mark 4.
[51:05] We read from verse 11
[51:10] and it read this.
[51:15] And he said unto them,
[51:17] unto you it is given to know the mystery
[51:21] of the kingdom of God, but unto them
[51:26] that are
[51:29] that are without
[51:31] these things are done in parables. You
[51:35] may be seated tonight.
[51:40] Hallelujah.
[51:45] Praise God.
[51:51] You know, tonight we like to declare
[51:55] that God is a God of truth.
[52:00] You know, he is the God of truth. The
[52:03] Bible call him that. Brother Bam said
[52:05] he's the God of the Amen, which is, you
[52:09] know, he is the God of truth.
[52:13] Now only God alone can define truth.
[52:17] There's no truth except what God say.
[52:21] And you know it's good when we can stand
[52:26] upon God's truth as the reality of our
[52:29] faith.
[52:30] You know uh because what we find today
[52:34] church there are so many influences that
[52:37] are there that are trying to you know
[52:40] point us to so many other things really
[52:43] but it doesn't matter what circumstances
[52:46] that stands out there really God's word
[52:50] holds the absolute
[52:53] hallelujah for it is the absolute truth
[52:57] and so he is a God of truth he is rather
[53:00] of the God of truth. Amen. Hallelujah.
[53:04] So we we know truth. The Bible said,
[53:08] "Thy word, O Lord, is truth." In other
[53:12] word, the Bible here is the absolute.
[53:19] If there's anything that goes against
[53:21] this absolute, it means that it's going
[53:24] against the truth of God's word.
[53:27] And if you stand upon this word, you
[53:31] have a right, hallelujah, for the
[53:33] blessings of the word of God. Because
[53:36] there's nothing, church, that can sway
[53:40] God's truth. There's nothing greater
[53:43] than the word. There's nothing mightier
[53:46] than the word. And I and I and I want
[53:48] you to go with me as we travel a a a
[53:51] little on a little journey tonight as we
[53:53] look into these things. Really, there's
[53:55] nothing greater than the word. If you're
[53:58] sick tonight and the word of God say
[54:03] that God is your healer, then that is
[54:06] truth.
[54:07] And so, you have a right to revert
[54:10] yourself upon and stand upon God's word
[54:13] because that's the absolute. That's what
[54:16] God say. And you know what we find today
[54:19] church that there are so many influences
[54:21] there that well but what is trying to
[54:23] tell us that we we are not able we we
[54:25] cannot do this that we are nothing that
[54:27] we are nobody but is that the truth
[54:31] are you there with me and so when we put
[54:33] all of that back to God's word we
[54:35] realize that there's something wrong
[54:37] somewhere
[54:39] the the influences and all the the thing
[54:41] that we hear how it's not reflecting
[54:43] what God word declares and so we have a
[54:46] right to declare
[54:47] Hallelujah. That I'm a child of God and
[54:49] what God said belongs to me. Amen.
[54:52] Hallelujah. And so let me declare that
[54:54] God word. Hallelujah. The Bible said thy
[54:58] word, O Lord, his truth. Hallelujah. It
[55:02] it is the word of truth. Are you there
[55:06] with me church? And so he gave us truth,
[55:10] the Bible as as a guide, as a as a
[55:13] principle of our lives. So we we can
[55:15] live life. We can overcome. We can go
[55:18] into places. We can we can take on
[55:21] battles and and overcome them. Why?
[55:23] Because we are Christian. And listen
[55:25] church. It doesn't matter. Hallelu what
[55:27] the enemy is doing. It doesn't matter
[55:30] what the external influences are. You
[55:32] have a right. Hallelujah. to stand upon
[55:34] God word uh and to declare that I'm a
[55:38] child of God and I believe what God say
[55:41] and I believe that it is for me and you
[55:43] have a right to walk into it and believe
[55:46] it. Are you there me church? Hallelujah.
[55:49] Praise God. You know brother Bham said
[55:52] that God had a believe his own word. In
[55:56] other word, even when it comes to comes
[55:59] comes onto a foundation upon which hal
[56:02] even God himself stand God does not
[56:06] hallelujah it does a turn from his own
[56:08] word. God honor his own word and so if
[56:13] he does that hallelujah he expect his
[56:16] children to do just the same. Brother
[56:19] said that Jesus believe the scripture
[56:23] concerning himself. Hallelujah. that
[56:25] when they crucified him, before he was
[56:28] crucified, he declared that I have power
[56:31] to lay my life down and I have power to
[56:34] raise it up again. Are you me church?
[56:37] Hallelujah. And so he was reverting to
[56:40] what God say about him. He reverted to
[56:44] what the scripture declares about
[56:46] himself. Uh and so he knew that he was
[56:48] going downh. But by the word of God, he
[56:51] knew that he was coming up because God
[56:54] word declares that there would would
[56:56] have been a resurrection, hallelujah, in
[56:59] him. And so Jesus went down believing
[57:01] the scripture.
[57:03] Are you there the church? It is God's
[57:06] absolute truth. Hallelujah. And so if
[57:09] there is truth, if this is truth, then
[57:13] there got to be a reality that goes with
[57:16] truth. Are you there? Church, you see
[57:20] the Bible is not just word only but
[57:23] power and demonstration. Hallelu of the
[57:26] Holy Ghost. In other words, this word is
[57:28] not just letter only but it's a reality.
[57:32] There's a reality that is here.
[57:34] Hallelujah. That you have in word form.
[57:37] Hallelujah. And so the enemy is trying
[57:39] to sway your mind by circumstances, by
[57:42] the different instances and the
[57:44] challenges of life. Hallelujah. But now
[57:47] we are being restored back to God's
[57:50] word. And so the word when it comes, it
[57:54] brings that reality. And that reality,
[57:57] hallelujah, is God word being made
[57:59] manifest.
[58:01] The manifested word of God. The reality
[58:05] is God word. Hallelujah. Coming into
[58:08] being. Are you there me church? Well, I
[58:10] want you to as we travel tonight, I want
[58:13] you to look on yourself where you are
[58:17] and the things that are troubling you.
[58:19] Look on the circumstances and all of
[58:22] life endeavors and all the things that
[58:24] are confronting you. And I want you to
[58:27] realize that God has spoken a word
[58:29] concerning you. Are you there, my
[58:31] church? And this word, hallelujah, that
[58:34] God spoke uh hal it got to be a reality
[58:37] if you can accept it. It got to move,
[58:40] hallelujah, from just a word of truth to
[58:43] a word of reality.
[58:46] Hallelujah. God does not want to give
[58:48] you word only. It's not word only, but
[58:52] word with reality.
[58:55] Hallelujah. And you say, "Brother Goff,
[58:57] why are you doing that?" You know, uh,
[58:59] brother brother Mark gave me some
[59:00] wonderful material on the revelation of
[59:04] Jesus Christ. And that's where we want
[59:07] to to go tonight. But I'm I don't want
[59:09] to rush into it too much. I want you to
[59:12] understand that the revelation of Jesus
[59:15] Christ is the word in reality.
[59:18] Hallelujah. It's God bringing the
[59:20] reality of himself to you. Are you there
[59:24] me church? And so when you take the word
[59:26] Hallelujah and begin manifesting it, you
[59:29] become God's reality by his own word.
[59:32] Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen.
[59:36] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So we declare
[59:39] tonight there's nothing that Satan can
[59:42] do if you stand upon this. It is
[59:45] written. It is written. Hallelujah. It
[59:48] is written. Hallelujah. Because this is
[59:51] the absolute truth. And there's nothing.
[59:54] Hallelujah. Where are in this dimension
[59:56] or outside of this dimension, there's
[59:59] nothing that the enemy can do or can
[1:00:01] alter God's word. Uh if it is written is
[1:00:04] God's absolute truth. And there's
[1:00:06] nothing that can challen that can change
[1:00:09] the outcome if you stand upon it.
[1:00:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. So
[1:00:17] the reality hallelujah is the word of
[1:00:20] God coming into being. Then when we see
[1:00:22] that hallelujah that we can say
[1:00:25] hallelujah the revelation the word is
[1:00:28] being revealed. You know what we're
[1:00:30] saying? When it's when it's coming into
[1:00:32] reality hallelujah it's being revealed.
[1:00:34] And when it become a when when it's
[1:00:36] being revealed how it becomes a
[1:00:38] revelation uh becoming alive in you. Are
[1:00:42] you there with me church? And so when
[1:00:44] God gave you the word uh he gave it
[1:00:47] hallelujah with the intent but it must
[1:00:49] be hallelujah.
[1:00:51] It must be a reality but it must be
[1:00:54] revealed. It must come forth and live
[1:00:57] and express itself.
[1:01:00] Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen.
[1:01:04] Hallelujah.
[1:01:06] Hallelujah. And so church uh we we saw
[1:01:10] there in the book of of Genesis
[1:01:13] the first time
[1:01:15] spoke of of God being high self-existing
[1:01:18] and and all of that fellowshipping with
[1:01:20] his thoughts and but he said the first
[1:01:23] time we saw hallelujah the reality of
[1:01:26] God is God himself bringing himself by
[1:01:30] revelation into the reality form that
[1:01:34] you can look and say hey that's God. Are
[1:01:37] you there with me church? So the first
[1:01:39] revelation of God is God himself uh
[1:01:43] revealing himself. In other words, he
[1:01:45] wants to declare that the word is true.
[1:01:47] Uh the word is real. Why? Because God
[1:01:51] himself has taken upon himself the word
[1:01:55] of himself uh to declare himself by his
[1:01:58] own word. Hallelujah church. Hallelujah.
[1:02:00] So the word is real. Uh the word is
[1:02:03] truth. Uh the word is life. The word is
[1:02:06] a reality. The word is God. I
[1:02:09] hallelujah. The word being made
[1:02:12] expressed God in reality form. Glory to
[1:02:16] God. Amen. Revealing himself. And so the
[1:02:20] first time we saw in the beginning,
[1:02:23] Hallelujah. It was God himself uh
[1:02:26] bringing himself into being. And what
[1:02:29] I'm said it was God him offering himself
[1:02:33] uh in Christ the word in the word Christ
[1:02:37] is the expression hallelujah of the
[1:02:40] word. Hallelujah of the father of God.
[1:02:43] Hallelujah. So the thought was made
[1:02:45] hallelujah word into a person. Are you
[1:02:48] there with me church? Hallelujah. What
[1:02:50] am I saying to you? The word of God is
[1:02:53] not just letters only but the word of
[1:02:56] God is a person. is a person of God. Are
[1:03:00] you a church? And so the person of the
[1:03:02] word is the reality of God be made
[1:03:05] revealed to the people of God.
[1:03:08] Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen.
[1:03:12] And so we saw him. We know that it is
[1:03:16] real. Why? Because God is real.
[1:03:20] Hallelujah. The reality of God.
[1:03:23] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:03:26] And so he was coming into being. Genesis
[1:03:30] the Bible say in the beginning.
[1:03:32] Hallelujah. God created the heaven.
[1:03:35] Hallelujah. What was it church? It was a
[1:03:37] revelation. No said the book of Genesis
[1:03:41] and the book of of revelation is two
[1:03:43] absolute book really because it brings
[1:03:46] the reality of God into being. We saw in
[1:03:49] the beginning it was God bringing
[1:03:51] himself uh hal but we see there in the
[1:03:53] hen it was God in the reality form
[1:03:56] bringing his bride into being by the
[1:03:59] word. Are you there church? Uh the same
[1:04:02] hallelujah way that he brought himself
[1:04:05] hal into being by the word. The same way
[1:04:08] he brings his bride by the word in hal.
[1:04:11] Are you there with me church? And so
[1:04:13] hallelujah. And so the reality is it was
[1:04:16] God and the expression. The word and
[1:04:20] expression expressing God. Hallelujah.
[1:04:24] Praise God. Hallelujah. You go with me a
[1:04:27] little bit as we go through this.
[1:04:29] Hallelujah. Praise God. And I'm also
[1:04:31] sorry because I didn't have the the the
[1:04:33] poor points and all of that, but hey,
[1:04:35] you just go with me tonight. Hallelujah.
[1:04:39] Amen. Brother Benham said in the message
[1:04:41] investment, he was making a prayer and
[1:04:44] he said
[1:04:46] uh he said bless bless us then as we
[1:04:50] listen to thy word. He said we know thy
[1:04:54] word is truth. He said, "And there is
[1:04:57] other truth and there is no other truth
[1:05:01] outside of thy outside of that." He
[1:05:04] said, "And we pray, Father, that thy
[1:05:07] word will become a reality to us." It
[1:05:10] said today for we for it is written in
[1:05:15] the beginning was the word and the word
[1:05:18] was with God and the word was God and
[1:05:22] the word was made flesh and dwell among
[1:05:24] us and he said at the same yesterday
[1:05:27] today and forever. Hallelujah. And so
[1:05:32] church we say that the first time that
[1:05:35] we saw the word hallelujah we see a
[1:05:38] living being a living person expressing
[1:05:42] the eternal hallelujah word. He was
[1:05:45] expressing the eternities he was
[1:05:47] revealing hallelujah. So when we speak
[1:05:50] of uh when we speak of revelation we are
[1:05:54] speaking of a reality. Are you there me
[1:05:57] church? What revelation should do? It
[1:06:00] should bring you into that reality form.
[1:06:02] Hal to see something greater than
[1:06:05] anything else. Hallelujah. And it
[1:06:07] becomes so real to you. Hallelujah. That
[1:06:10] nothing else matters. Are you there
[1:06:12] church? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And so
[1:06:15] God wants to take it. Hallelujah. By
[1:06:18] revelation and show it to the people.
[1:06:22] Hallelujah. To his children. Hallelujah.
[1:06:24] But the word is real. It's real, church.
[1:06:27] Hallelujah. It's real. Hallelujah. So
[1:06:31] the first time we saw it, Hallelujah. We
[1:06:34] saw he it was him coming into being.
[1:06:37] Hallelujah. Not just a thought, but the
[1:06:40] thought was been made express. We saw in
[1:06:43] the book of Hebrews chapter one the
[1:06:45] Bible said God a son of times and in
[1:06:48] diverse manner as spoken unto the
[1:06:51] fathers by the prophet but in these days
[1:06:54] he's speaking by son hallelujah Jesus
[1:06:57] Christ the who being the brightness of
[1:07:01] his glory and the express image
[1:07:04] hallelujah of his person and uphold it
[1:07:07] all things by the word of his power when
[1:07:11] he by himself myself as purge of a sin
[1:07:14] and I sat down at the right hand and
[1:07:16] majesty and high. Who was it church?
[1:07:20] Hallelujah. It was God expressing
[1:07:22] himself in Christ. Hallelujah. Christ is
[1:07:26] hal the revelation of God. Hallelujah.
[1:07:30] I'm stressing on that because you got to
[1:07:33] see church. Hallelujah. But if you get a
[1:07:36] revelation, if you have a revelation
[1:07:39] from God, what you're doing, Hal, you're
[1:07:43] taking the word. Hallelujah. And you're
[1:07:46] bringing God on the scene. But listen,
[1:07:49] but when you're doing that, there are so
[1:07:51] many obstacles and and hindrance and and
[1:07:54] and there's so many things uh that will
[1:07:56] strive and prevent the word from coming
[1:07:59] into being. church. But you have a
[1:08:02] right, hallelujah, to declare that this
[1:08:06] is God's word. Are you me church? And no
[1:08:09] matter what, oh my, no matter what, uh,
[1:08:12] hallelujah, the situation is how grave
[1:08:15] it is. Hallelujah. No matter what the
[1:08:17] doctor say, it doesn't change the word.
[1:08:20] It no matter what your body say, it
[1:08:23] doesn't change the word. It doesn't
[1:08:25] matter what you think. Uh, it doesn't
[1:08:27] change the perspective. God's revelation
[1:08:31] stands firm. Hallelujah. Because God has
[1:08:34] declared it and the Bible said heaven
[1:08:36] and earth will pass away but not a
[1:08:39] titler of my word can it fail. It said
[1:08:42] he will go out the word that he speaks.
[1:08:45] It goes out of his mouth and it will
[1:08:48] accomplish after those things that he
[1:08:50] sendeth but it will not return to him
[1:08:53] void. It will manifest exactly what he
[1:08:56] says. You there with me? Hallelujah. It
[1:09:01] was God expressing himself in Christ.
[1:09:05] Hallelujah.
[1:09:06] First uh Colossian 1. And verse 15, the
[1:09:10] Bible said, "Who is the image?"
[1:09:12] Hallelujah. Of the invisible God, the
[1:09:16] first born of every creature.
[1:09:20] And for by him, for by him were all
[1:09:23] things created that are in the heaven
[1:09:28] and that are in the hurt, visible and
[1:09:31] invisible, whether they be thrown or or
[1:09:33] dominion or hallelujah or principalities
[1:09:37] or power. All things were created by him
[1:09:41] and for him. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I I
[1:09:45] I I I want you to understand what God
[1:09:48] was doing. God was bringing the word
[1:09:51] into being. Are you there my church? And
[1:09:54] so in his mind he had these thoughts but
[1:09:57] now the thought was being made
[1:09:59] materialized. And so the Bible said
[1:10:01] hallelujah. And so it just it move from
[1:10:04] just word into materialization.
[1:10:07] Hallelujah. We saw the substance of
[1:10:09] God's word. Hallelujah. We saw the hurt
[1:10:12] came into being. We saw the sea came
[1:10:14] into being. We saw the will came into
[1:10:16] being. is an expression. Hallelujah. Of
[1:10:19] God. Are you there church? Hallelujah.
[1:10:22] So we know church. Hallelujah. That
[1:10:24] there's a reality that come through the
[1:10:26] word. We know that church and the Bible
[1:10:29] said and upon this rock he church and
[1:10:33] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[1:10:35] it. Uh they will try they will come but
[1:10:39] hallelujah. But stand firm upon what God
[1:10:41] say because what what he say it's the
[1:10:43] absolute truth. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:10:46] In other words, if you have a
[1:10:48] confession, let your confession be upon
[1:10:51] the word of God.
[1:10:54] Hallelujah.
[1:10:55] Praise God.
[1:10:57] You're there with me.
[1:10:59] Hallelujah.
[1:11:01] Amen.
[1:11:03] Hallelujah.
[1:11:05] Praise God. And so, church, we saw
[1:11:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:11:14] Amen.
[1:11:15] Amen. Let let me get my thought together
[1:11:17] here.
[1:11:19] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:11:22] Amen.
[1:11:24] Amen. Spare with me a little bit.
[1:11:28] Amen.
[1:11:31] Hallelujah.
[1:11:32] You don't my printing got all mixed up
[1:11:35] here, but Amen. I think I'll just have
[1:11:37] to go freestyle.
[1:11:41] Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. And so we
[1:11:45] say that it was God on the expression by
[1:11:48] his own word. It was God that was
[1:11:51] bringing the word into being. But
[1:11:54] church, hallelujah, I want you to think
[1:11:56] tonight. You know, we we've been pre
[1:11:58] preaching and teaching a little bit. But
[1:12:00] I want you to look into this tonight
[1:12:03] that the the the word of God being
[1:12:05] expressed, it's a reality. But now we
[1:12:08] know that hallelujah the the word
[1:12:11] written or the word the thought hal is
[1:12:14] the absolute there's nothing beyond how
[1:12:17] the absolute thought of god and so we
[1:12:20] find in bible church you know the bible
[1:12:23] you know speak of two context really but
[1:12:26] it speaks of how in in in the revelation
[1:12:29] of god it speaks of the word prophecy
[1:12:32] that you know it which is prophecy with
[1:12:35] c y and and prophecy with s y he said I
[1:12:39] don't know if you ever come across that
[1:12:40] in Bible I'm like that's really I'm very
[1:12:42] you know very nosy when it comes on to
[1:12:45] the scripture but you know the Bible
[1:12:47] speaks of you know the two words and it
[1:12:50] is very hard really to differentiate
[1:12:52] between the two but you know the
[1:12:56] prophecy see why hallelujah it's God's
[1:13:00] word hallelujah the written word or you
[1:13:03] know it is God's message uh god sending
[1:13:07] a word, hallelujah, to his servant
[1:13:10] speaking in the name of the Lord. Are
[1:13:13] you getting me church? And so when God
[1:13:15] sent a message, when God sent a word,
[1:13:18] hallelujah, there got to be a messenger
[1:13:21] to catch the message. Hallelujah. By the
[1:13:25] word. Are you me, church? By the the
[1:13:28] prophecy that God gave. And so when that
[1:13:31] servant comes, he speaks in the name of
[1:13:34] the Lord. Hallelujah. He declare God's
[1:13:37] word by prophecy. Now when he speaks,
[1:13:41] Hallelujah. It's not sy
[1:13:48] church is God's word either to a prophet
[1:13:52] or God's word to a dispensation or God's
[1:13:55] word to an individual. Hallelujah. But
[1:13:58] church, but when the prophecy is given,
[1:14:00] hallelujah, it doesn't necessarily mean
[1:14:03] that it will occur at the same time.
[1:14:06] Hallelujah. It is given hello in word in
[1:14:09] prophecy. Hallelujah. Just like when
[1:14:12] Isaiah declared that a virgin shall
[1:14:15] conceive, that was prophecy. Hallelujah.
[1:14:18] Did it happen the same time? No, sir.
[1:14:21] But it was declared and that was God's
[1:14:24] word. Are you there me church? And so
[1:14:26] when he speak the word, hallelujah,
[1:14:29] hallelujah, it speaks it in a message.
[1:14:32] And when the message come forth,
[1:14:33] hallelujah, it is delivered to the
[1:14:35] people, hallelujah, and the people of
[1:14:38] the hate catch the word. Hallelujah.
[1:14:41] From the prophecy and the people believe
[1:14:44] it. Are you church? In other words, uh,
[1:14:47] God has never left himself without a
[1:14:50] witness. Uh, God sent the prophecy of
[1:14:54] the word. And when he sent it, the
[1:14:56] people had hear the voice of God through
[1:14:59] the messenger of the head and the people
[1:15:02] believe the message.
[1:15:05] But there's another prophecy which is
[1:15:08] sy.
[1:15:09] The cy speaks of prophecy in its known
[1:15:13] form.
[1:15:14] But prophecy sy brother Mark how speak
[1:15:18] of prophecy in its verb form. In other
[1:15:22] word, it is action.
[1:15:24] Hal, are you there church? So when God
[1:15:27] sent a message by prophecy and a prophet
[1:15:30] prophesy, Hallelujah. And said, "Thus
[1:15:32] said the Lord." Hallelujah. God gave a
[1:15:35] message to be delivered or an action to
[1:15:38] be carried out immediately.
[1:15:41] Are you there me church? What am I
[1:15:44] saying to you? I'm saying to you,
[1:15:45] church. Hallelujah. That what God does
[1:15:49] all the time. Hallelujah. He sent his
[1:15:53] word by prophecy and the people of the
[1:15:57] hedge catch the prophecy of God word.
[1:16:01] Hallelujah. And the people believe it.
[1:16:04] Are you there me church? But what is
[1:16:06] what should follow behind that is the
[1:16:09] action behind the word. Are you there me
[1:16:13] church? Because now that the people
[1:16:15] catch the word and the people believe
[1:16:18] the word then the word can be made
[1:16:21] material. It can be made manifested.
[1:16:25] Hallelujah. And so God have a pattern.
[1:16:28] The pattern is he sends his word and he
[1:16:33] declares it. Hal and the prophet
[1:16:36] prophesying the name of the Lord and the
[1:16:39] people. Hallelujah. The Bible said
[1:16:42] hallelujah. faith coming by hearing and
[1:16:46] hearing the prophecy of the word and the
[1:16:50] people hear the voice of God.
[1:16:52] Hallelujah. And the people believe the
[1:16:55] messenger. Hallelujah. Look at the time
[1:16:59] of Noah. Noah got a word from God that
[1:17:03] there shall come rain. That was
[1:17:06] prophecy. Was it rain same time? No sir,
[1:17:10] but for 120 years. That prophecy spans
[1:17:14] but it was God's word. But one day,
[1:17:18] hallelujah, one day, brother John, when
[1:17:21] the word was to be made m materialized,
[1:17:24] now I could say, "Hey, this is the day."
[1:17:28] Hallelujah. It's moving from just word
[1:17:30] spoken, but now is a time of action.
[1:17:35] Hallelujah. It's coming to being.
[1:17:38] Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen.
[1:17:42] Hallelujah.
[1:17:44] Praise God.
[1:17:46] Hallelujah.
[1:17:48] Amen. We saw there in the Bible.
[1:17:53] Hallelujah.
[1:17:55] In the book of Chronicles, 2 Chronicles
[1:17:57] 15
[1:17:58] verse one.
[1:18:00] Hallelujah.
[1:18:03] Amen.
[1:18:07] 2 Chronicles 15:1.
[1:18:10] The Bible said,
[1:18:13] "And the spirit of God
[1:18:16] came upon Isariah
[1:18:19] the son of of dead, and he went out to
[1:18:23] meet Asa,
[1:18:25] and said unto him, "Hear ye, me, Asa,
[1:18:31] and all Judah and Benjamin.
[1:18:34] The Lord is with you. while he be with
[1:18:38] him and if he seek him
[1:18:42] is that he will be found of you. But if
[1:18:46] he forsake him, he will forsake you.
[1:18:51] Now for a long season, hallelujah,
[1:18:55] Israel had been without without the true
[1:18:58] God and without the the teaching priests
[1:19:02] and without but without law. And when
[1:19:07] they
[1:19:09] uh
[1:19:10] but when they in when they were in
[1:19:13] trouble did they turn unto the Lord God
[1:19:16] of Israel and sought him and he was
[1:19:20] found of them. And in those times were
[1:19:24] no peace to them to him that went out
[1:19:29] nor to him that came in.
[1:19:33] But he said but a great vexation were
[1:19:36] upon all the inhabitants of the country
[1:19:41] and nations were destroying of nation
[1:19:45] and city of city for God did vex them
[1:19:49] with all
[1:19:52] with all adversity
[1:19:54] but he but be strong therefore and let
[1:19:58] not your hand be weak for your work
[1:20:02] shall be reward rewarded. And when when
[1:20:05] Asa heard these words, hallelujah, and
[1:20:10] the prophecy of Oad,
[1:20:13] the Bible said that the prophet, he took
[1:20:17] courage and put away the abominable idol
[1:20:22] out of all the land of Judah and
[1:20:25] Benjamin out of the city which he had
[1:20:28] taken
[1:20:30] uh from Mount Ephraim.
[1:20:33] And we knew the altar of the Lord that
[1:20:36] was before the porch of the Lord.
[1:20:41] And so here the prophet,
[1:20:44] he got a prophecy.
[1:20:46] Hallelujah. And he speak the prophecy of
[1:20:49] the word. And so hallelujah. And the
[1:20:53] servant of the Lord heard the word and
[1:20:56] he was responsive. In other words,
[1:20:58] hallelujah. God sent a message and the
[1:21:01] message was heard to whom it was sent.
[1:21:05] Hallelujah. And so when he got the word,
[1:21:07] he begin acting. Hallelujah. And so that
[1:21:11] was prophecy. Hallelujah. A message
[1:21:14] being declared. Hallelujah. And so it
[1:21:16] doesn't necessarily mean that it will
[1:21:18] happen at the same time, but it is still
[1:21:20] thus said the Lord and it will bring to
[1:21:23] pass. But here the Bible said in Ezekiel
[1:21:29] 37
[1:21:31] and verse one, the Bible said, "And the
[1:21:33] hand of the Lord was upon me, and he
[1:21:36] carried me in the the spirit
[1:21:38] of the Lord and set me down in the midst
[1:21:41] of a valley full of dry bone. And he
[1:21:45] caused to pass by them round about." And
[1:21:49] and before that there were there were
[1:21:52] many in the the open valley. And Lord,
[1:21:56] there were very dry. And he said unto
[1:21:59] me, son of man, can these bones live?
[1:22:04] And I and I answered, "Oh Lord, thou
[1:22:07] knowest?" And again he said unto me,
[1:22:10] prophesy
[1:22:12] hallelujah unto these bones and they and
[1:22:16] say unto them, oh ye dry bones, hear the
[1:22:20] word of the Lord. Thus sayith the Lord
[1:22:23] God unto these bone, behold, I will
[1:22:27] cause breath to enter into into you, and
[1:22:31] ye shall live. and I will lay sinners
[1:22:34] upon you and will bring up up flesh upon
[1:22:38] you and cover you with skin and and put
[1:22:42] breath in you and he shall live and he
[1:22:45] shall know that I am the Lord. So Isaiah
[1:22:50] Ezekiel said, "So I prophesy,
[1:22:54] as I was commanded, and as I prophesy,
[1:22:58] there was a noise." Hallelujah.
[1:23:01] And said, "Behold, a shaking, and the
[1:23:04] bones came together, bones to bone."
[1:23:09] Hallelujah. In other word, church.
[1:23:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He catched the
[1:23:15] word. He heard the voice of God and he
[1:23:18] declared the word and the word out of
[1:23:21] his mouth became substance immediately.
[1:23:26] Are you there church? Hallelujah. But I
[1:23:29] want you to understand how the pattern
[1:23:31] that God does it really. Hallelujah. If
[1:23:35] he's sending a message, he use a
[1:23:37] messenger. Hallelujah. And when the
[1:23:40] people catch it, the people believe it.
[1:23:43] Hallelujah. And God in in the fullness
[1:23:46] of time uh will bring the word to pass.
[1:23:49] Hallelujah. But there are instances when
[1:23:52] the word of God comes to you. Are you
[1:23:55] there church? You may come to church
[1:23:58] with a problem and you said Lord
[1:24:00] Hallelujah. I decide this morning or I
[1:24:03] decide this evening I'm not going back
[1:24:06] home with this problem. Lord I believe
[1:24:08] uh you will say a word to my heart.
[1:24:11] Lord, I believe uh you said something.
[1:24:14] You will speak to my heart. Uh Lord God,
[1:24:16] I need something from you. And right
[1:24:19] while you're there praying, uh there
[1:24:21] comes a word. The pastor will pick up
[1:24:24] exactly on what you're saying in your
[1:24:27] whispering. What it is, church, is God
[1:24:30] echoing. The prophecy telling you, "Hey,
[1:24:34] I'm alive. I'm here. I'm I'm listening
[1:24:36] to your prayer." And he's bringing the
[1:24:39] word, hallelujah, into manifestation.
[1:24:42] Praise God. Thank you, brother.
[1:24:46] Hallelujah.
[1:24:47] Hallelujah. Thank you very much. He's
[1:24:50] bringing the word into materialization.
[1:24:54] Praise God. So, it's no longer dead
[1:24:58] letters,
[1:25:01] the living word be made expressed.
[1:25:05] So, I want you to see that. But there's
[1:25:08] a pattern to God's program. Hallelujah.
[1:25:12] Hallelujah. But it doesn't make a
[1:25:15] difference. If it is God's word, church,
[1:25:19] it is the truth. And if this if it is
[1:25:22] truth, it will be made manifested. I
[1:25:25] want us tonight to think about this that
[1:25:28] this is the age of revelation
[1:25:32] where the word that you heard you see
[1:25:35] God he promised that in this day he
[1:25:38] would send a messenger with a message.
[1:25:40] Are you there my church to declare in
[1:25:43] the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. And so
[1:25:46] if you can hear the voice of the
[1:25:48] messenger, hallelu, you hear the voice
[1:25:50] of God echoing to the huge uh speaking
[1:25:54] in the name of the Lord. Are you there
[1:25:56] my church? Uh and what we need tonight.
[1:25:59] Uh we don't we we don't need more
[1:26:00] anointing and shouting. What we need
[1:26:03] church is revelation. We need to hear
[1:26:06] that voice. Uh are you there my church?
[1:26:08] Uh because if you can hear the voice of
[1:26:10] God no matter what condition that binds
[1:26:13] you tonight.
[1:26:15] Hallelujah. You can walk away as free
[1:26:17] people. You can declare it that I've
[1:26:19] heard the voice of God. Hallelujah. And
[1:26:22] you can declare it tonight. You can even
[1:26:25] speak to your own body. You can say body
[1:26:27] obey my confession. Hallelujah. You can
[1:26:30] say sickness in the name of the Lord.
[1:26:33] Hallelujah. You can say I have the power
[1:26:36] by the scripture and you can speak God
[1:26:38] word and watch God bring that word to
[1:26:40] pass. He's looking for those in the same
[1:26:44] time. People who will believe his word
[1:26:49] no matter what. Hallelujah.
[1:26:53] Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:26:56] Praise God.
[1:26:58] Amen.
[1:27:00] Hallelujah.
[1:27:03] Hallelujah. So, can these bones live?
[1:27:07] And he said, "Thou knows." I said,
[1:27:10] "Prophesy.
[1:27:12] Speak to the your mountain. Speak to
[1:27:14] your storm. Hallelujah. If you hear a
[1:27:17] word, speak
[1:27:19] and declare it in the name of the Lord
[1:27:23] and watch God brings it to pass.
[1:27:26] Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah." And
[1:27:30] so, church, hallelujah, as we grow into
[1:27:32] this the thought. And so, we said the
[1:27:35] word was given under the age. It came to
[1:27:38] the messenger of that age and the people
[1:27:41] hal to whom it was written the site of
[1:27:45] my message tonight is is come and see.
[1:27:48] Hallelujah. Because uh we are invited to
[1:27:51] come. We're invited to come in. Brother
[1:27:53] Mark, why why are you here? Why why is
[1:27:56] it you you're part of this body? Why why

[1:28:04] to do what? to wand the benches to to
[1:28:07] sing good songs. No sir, we are called
[1:28:10] to come and see. Are you there me
[1:28:12] church? But what are you seeing? You got
[1:28:15] to see something. Are you there me

[1:28:29] Hallelujah. If you if you can see it,
[1:28:32] hallelujah. that this is not just an
[1:28:34] ordinary age but this is a time uh of of
[1:28:37] God's revelation. Do you know church,
[1:28:40] brother said, hallelujah, that God bring
[1:28:43] the word in flesh three times.
[1:28:46] Hallelujah. We saw the word in flesh in
[1:28:48] the book of Genesis. Hallelujah. The
[1:28:51] living word became manifested. Christ,
[1:28:54] hallelujah, standing there in the son of
[1:28:56] God. And watch Adam with the word. He
[1:28:59] spoke the word. Hallelujah. And the word
[1:29:02] that comes out of his mouth, God said, I
[1:29:05] am pleased. Why? because he and the word
[1:29:08] was one. Are you there me church? That's
[1:29:11] where God wants it. God wants the people
[1:29:14] and himself to become by one by the
[1:29:17] word. Are you there me church?
[1:29:19] Hallelujah. Not just written word but
[1:29:22] living word, living reality of the word.
[1:29:25] Hallelujah. Are you there me church? So
[1:29:27] he did it in Genesis and brother said
[1:29:30] what the enemy did he attack the word.
[1:29:33] You see, he cannot attack the spirit of
[1:29:36] the word because he cannot overcome the
[1:29:39] spirit of the word. But he can attack
[1:29:42] the written word. How? And and what he
[1:29:44] does when he attacks it, he put
[1:29:46] something there that is not the word.
[1:29:49] And the spirit of God cannot operate if
[1:29:51] it's that full word. Are you there,
[1:29:54] church? And so he put God put his word
[1:29:57] here and the enemy attacks it.
[1:29:59] Hallelujah. We saw again the word was in
[1:30:03] flesh in Jesus. Hallelujah. Brother said
[1:30:06] at River Jordan. Hal when the Holy Ghost
[1:30:09] came down. Hallelujah. Brother said it
[1:30:12] was that time the word was truly made
[1:30:15] flesh. Are you there at the church of
[1:30:17] St. Luke 3. Hello. John said I bear
[1:30:19] witness and I saw Hallelujah. God's
[1:30:23] reality came in flesh. The word was
[1:30:26] walking and talking. Are you me church?
[1:30:29] Hallelujah. We saw in St. Luke 4, the
[1:30:32] Bible said he went, Hallelujah.
[1:30:35] Hallelujah. He went back to his hometown
[1:30:38] and the Bible said, Hallelujah. When he
[1:30:40] went there, he went to the synagogue and
[1:30:42] they handed him the scripture and he
[1:30:44] declared, the Bible said he declared,
[1:30:46] "The spirit of the Lord is upon me for
[1:30:49] he has anointed me." But it was certain
[1:30:52] it was a living reality. It was God's
[1:30:55] reality to the human race. He wanted to
[1:30:58] come and dwell in our flesh.
[1:31:03] Hallelujah.
[1:31:06] Let me show you something here.
[1:31:09] Brother Bottom said when God came down
[1:31:12] in Jesus
[1:31:14] at River Jordan, but the monkey didn't
[1:31:16] need a Bible.
[1:31:18] He was the Bible.
[1:31:21] He didn't write a book. He was the book.
[1:31:25] Are you there me church? Hallelujah. He
[1:31:28] was the book being made expressed.
[1:31:31] Hallelujah. When the word comes down, h
[1:31:34] that's where God wants, he wants the the
[1:31:37] thought to become literal tangible
[1:31:39] source of himself walking. Are you there
[1:31:43] me church? Hallelujah. But you know
[1:31:44] what? Hallelujah. It's because of what
[1:31:48] we are and the condition that we find
[1:31:50] oursel why God cannot have that
[1:31:52] preeminence. Hallelujah. But he declare
[1:31:55] it church that in these days he's going
[1:31:58] to send the word again. Hallelujah. The
[1:32:00] third time it's going to be the word
[1:32:03] with a difference. The word in flesh
[1:32:05] again in the same time to do what? To
[1:32:08] bring God and the seal. Oh my God. Oh
[1:32:11] church. Hallelujah. It will be God in
[1:32:14] you with a difference.
[1:32:17] Oh my. Hallelujah. What is the
[1:32:20] difference? Hallelujah. He declared it.
[1:32:25] It was prophesied over your life that
[1:32:28] you are born an overcomer.
[1:32:30] You're born to make You're not in a
[1:32:32] winner circle. You're not trying to
[1:32:35] overcome. Oh my church. If you receive
[1:32:38] the Holy Ghost, there's nothing that
[1:32:41] this enemy can do to defeat you. There's
[1:32:45] nothing that this enemy can do to stop
[1:32:47] you. Why? Because Christ is sealed on
[1:32:50] the inside.
[1:32:52] And so the only availability for him is
[1:32:54] to affect this.
[1:32:57] Hallelujah. He comes against you in your
[1:32:59] bills. He comes against you in your pay.
[1:33:03] He comes against you in so many
[1:33:05] different ways. In your body, in your
[1:33:07] health, with your car.
[1:33:11] Are you there, my church? Hallelujah.
[1:33:13] And he's hoping to frustrate you down to
[1:33:16] your shoes.
[1:33:17] that you wonder can God but I prayed
[1:33:20] about this last week and God I talked to
[1:33:22] you about this and it seem as though
[1:33:24] it's God you're not coming through for
[1:33:26] me but church hallelujah can I give you
[1:33:30] news tonight that same God hallelujah
[1:33:34] that created the heavens that created
[1:33:37] the earth is living inside of you by the
[1:33:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost and he declare
[1:33:44] it that you cannot fail
[1:33:47] by the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. You you
[1:33:50] you cannot go to hell with the Holy
[1:33:54] Ghost.
[1:33:59] Hallelujah. What am I saying to you
[1:34:01] tonight church? Hallelujah. He came down
[1:34:06] and he sealed on the inside. And though
[1:34:09] you have been affected, we are being
[1:34:10] affected in our daily walk. Sometime it
[1:34:14] feel as though we are not even a
[1:34:15] Christian to begin with. Hallelujah. But
[1:34:18] God is sealed on the inside. Hallelu.
[1:34:21] Why? Because we have heard the word and
[1:34:24] we believe it. And because we believe
[1:34:26] it, we catch it by revelation. But this
[1:34:30] is it church. When we get it by
[1:34:32] revelation, we get it by word and it
[1:34:35] become a confession.
[1:34:37] But little by little, your confession is
[1:34:41] coming a reality. Are you there my
[1:34:44] church? Hallelujah. Because that which
[1:34:47] is on the inside is revealing God. The
[1:34:51] book revelation is you in action by the
[1:34:55] prophecy of God's word. Hallelujah. Your
[1:34:58] life become a living manifestation of
[1:35:00] God.
[1:35:04] Sorry to be excited.
[1:35:06] Hallelujah. But I got to show you church
[1:35:10] that this bride is unstoppable
[1:35:12] because you hold the truth of God's word
[1:35:16] and where their suit there cannot be any
[1:35:19] hindrance.
[1:35:21] If we die tonight, if all of us, you
[1:35:25] know, if God forbid it won't happen,
[1:35:27] brother Mark, well, God forbid if Russia
[1:35:30] decide to send a bomb over and all of us
[1:35:32] should go and smoke tonight just like
[1:35:35] that, we step on this mortal life.
[1:35:38] Hallelujah. Into a there's no stinging
[1:35:41] to death for the believer. Are you
[1:35:43] there, my church? It was destroyed at
[1:35:44] Calvary. In other words, one minute
[1:35:47] you're here and another minute just like
[1:35:49] that, like a twinkling of an eye, you
[1:35:51] step across the threshold, how are you
[1:35:54] there, me, church, you step into another
[1:35:56] dimension, into the reality of God's
[1:35:59] word. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:36:03] Amen.
[1:36:05] Hallelujah. And so, church, you're
[1:36:08] called to seat.
[1:36:11] Hallelujah.
[1:36:12] If you can see it hard, then you can
[1:36:15] step into it.
[1:36:17] But you got to know what you're looking
[1:36:19] at
[1:36:21] because there are so many other things
[1:36:23] that represent distraction.
[1:36:26] And so if you're not seeing the word,
[1:36:29] then your faith had to become wavering
[1:36:32] because in your mind you're wondering,
[1:36:35] can God do this? Can God bring this to
[1:36:38] pass? Can God manifest this word?
[1:36:42] You know, I'm going to say something
[1:36:44] from my own experience.
[1:36:47] You know, 2008, while back home in
[1:36:51] Jamaica,
[1:36:53] you know, I begin experiencing
[1:36:56] uh high blood pressure problem. And you
[1:36:59] know, I
[1:37:00] I remember when it just started, you
[1:37:03] know, I was so concerned about it. It
[1:37:06] was like a new
[1:37:08] playing ground, a new era for me really.
[1:37:11] I never knew what this thing was. And
[1:37:13] so, you know, I I went to the doctor,
[1:37:16] you know, I keep on going back and but
[1:37:19] you know, I find something that was so
[1:37:20] phenomenal is that each time when I go,
[1:37:23] brother John, he keep on adding one more
[1:37:26] tablets
[1:37:27] and he keep on giving me one more
[1:37:31] and he keep on giving me one more and
[1:37:33] one more tablet until I was taking about
[1:37:36] five different blood pressure tablets.
[1:37:39] And you know what? Nothing worked until
[1:37:41] he escalated it. He start giving me
[1:37:44] heart uh tablet. Then he gave me stomach
[1:37:47] tablets until I had a my own personal
[1:37:51] chest
[1:37:53] of tablets
[1:37:55] and man I I I I mean I was obedient to
[1:37:58] the doctor, right? Because I believe in
[1:38:00] going to the don't don't get me wrong,
[1:38:02] right? I believe in going to the
[1:38:03] doctors. But he made a mistake.
[1:38:06] The mistake was that when he found out
[1:38:09] that all that he was doing could not was
[1:38:11] not working. He said that well sir Mr.
[1:38:15] Grant well based on what I see you know
[1:38:19] I mean you know this thing is not
[1:38:20] working. So you when you go home you
[1:38:23] tell your wife to keep a boyfriend on
[1:38:26] the side because you won't be around
[1:38:27] long enough.
[1:38:29] Yes. Listen,
[1:38:32] when he said that to me, I said, "You
[1:38:35] uncircumcised Philistine
[1:38:38] church." Listen, the enemy brought the
[1:38:41] the the the you know, the test, the
[1:38:44] challenge, and I accepted it. I said,
[1:38:47] "Lord,
[1:38:48] this is not the language. This is not
[1:38:50] the experience of of a son of God." And
[1:38:52] I said, "God, if I'm going to die, I'm
[1:38:55] going to die with my shoes on. I'm going
[1:38:57] to die believing your word." Listen
[1:39:00] church, I'm not speaking about
[1:39:03] revelation by presumption. I'm telling
[1:39:05] you that the word of God is real.
[1:39:09] And I'm saying that no matter what, even
[1:39:11] if it means sickness, matter cancer,
[1:39:14] sugar, diabetes, hypertension, whatever
[1:39:16] it is, the God in whom you're trusting
[1:39:20] in
[1:39:21] the word that he gives you is the word
[1:39:24] of truth.
[1:39:25] Hallelujah. And it doesn't matter what
[1:39:28] the enemy is bringing onto you. Stand
[1:39:30] upon the word of God.
[1:39:33] You know, I went home, I told the wife
[1:39:36] and I said, "Well,
[1:39:38] I don't feel inspired to take any more
[1:39:40] of these tablets."
[1:39:43] And um I throw them away to be honest
[1:39:45] with you, brother Mark. Every one of
[1:39:47] them I throw them away. And that was
[1:39:51] 2008,
[1:39:53] you know. I've never taken anymore.
[1:39:55] Um I've gone to the doctors and you know
[1:40:00] so after that you know they keep on
[1:40:02] saying well it's on borderline you know
[1:40:04] stuff like that but you know church
[1:40:06] listen I'm saying to you church the word
[1:40:10] of God is real
[1:40:12] hallelujah hallelujah so when I declare
[1:40:17] this I said Lord if I'm going to die I'm
[1:40:20] going to die believe in your word
[1:40:23] somebody got to Stand up for the word of
[1:40:26] God. He said, "Brother Garfield, it
[1:40:28] might cost your life." So what?
[1:40:32] Listen, in these days, you cannot be
[1:40:35] afraid to challenge this enemy.
[1:40:38] Come on, church. You are the bride of
[1:40:40] Jesus Christ with the eternal word.
[1:40:44] And God is watching over his word.
[1:40:48] And if you hold on to God's promise, he
[1:40:50] will never never ever fail you or let
[1:40:53] you down in believing.
[1:40:57] Hallelujah.
[1:40:58] Going about 15 16 years.
[1:41:01] Have I gone to the doctor? I've been
[1:41:03] there over and over. The last time I
[1:41:07] went, Sister Marine, I I took I was
[1:41:09] wearing a hat monitor. I wore it for 24
[1:41:12] hours. You know why I did that, church?
[1:41:14] I want to show this enemy that the God
[1:41:17] in whom I'm trusting in listen church
[1:41:23] the reality of God's word I don't know
[1:41:25] who I'm talking to tonight but the
[1:41:27] reality of God word must stand and you
[1:41:31] got to be resolve resolute you got to
[1:41:34] realize that you are called to walk into
[1:41:37] the revelation of it or brother said
[1:41:42] what God does he first does it. In other
[1:41:44] words, eternally it is settled, then he
[1:41:47] reveals it, then he manifests it. But
[1:41:51] church, there's no difference between
[1:41:53] revelation and manifestation.
[1:41:56] When God revealed it to you, you can go
[1:41:59] home, you can put your pot on the fire,
[1:42:01] you can light the stove. Hallelujah.
[1:42:04] Because God is going to send somebody
[1:42:06] with the food.
[1:42:08] Are you there with me, church?
[1:42:09] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The word of God
[1:42:12] is truth. Hallelujah. And now,
[1:42:15] hallelujah, we have heard the word and
[1:42:18] the bride hear it and see exactly by the
[1:42:21] word what God wants done with it. And so
[1:42:25] she's stepping from the page.
[1:42:27] Hallelujah. I said, I know who I am. I
[1:42:31] am a child of God.
[1:42:34] Hallelujah.
[1:42:37] And so from that time, we have been
[1:42:40] battling But I have a resolve. I said,
[1:42:43] Lord, if I go to the doctor, you know
[1:42:46] what I'm saying to you now? And if the
[1:42:48] doctor says, Sister Marine, it is 1
[1:42:51] million upon one, it doesn't make a
[1:42:53] difference.
[1:42:55] Come on, church. I'm not scaring you,
[1:42:57] brother. Am I scaring you?
[1:43:00] It doesn't make a difference. Because if
[1:43:03] you stand upon God word, then everything
[1:43:06] else is a lie.
[1:43:08] In other words, you have a right to
[1:43:11] declare it, but God says so and I'm
[1:43:14] settled upon it.
[1:43:17] He said, "What do I do?" Hallelujah.
[1:43:19] Confess it. And God will allow your
[1:43:22] body, God will make your body obey your
[1:43:24] confession.
[1:43:27] Hallelujah.
[1:43:29] Amen. It's real, church. It's real. But
[1:43:34] you got to see it. Hallelujah. by the
[1:43:37] scripture and enter into it. Hallelujah.
[1:43:41] So when you see it, it's prophecy. Cy.
[1:43:45] But when you enter into it, it's
[1:43:47] prophecy. Sy. Hallelujah. It is now
[1:43:50] coming into reality form in you.
[1:43:53] Hallelujah. And so the book of Joel.
[1:43:57] Hallelujah. Praise God. Joel chapter
[1:43:59] 2:23 the Bible said be glad then ye eat
[1:44:04] children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord
[1:44:08] your God for he has given unto you the
[1:44:11] former rain moderately and will cause to
[1:44:14] come down for you the rain the farmer
[1:44:17] rain and the latter rain hallelujah in

[1:44:49] under restoration. Are you there church?
[1:44:52] And what restoration does uh it brings
[1:44:55] God's word, hallelujah, to you and I.
[1:44:58] And so what God did uh in order to bring
[1:45:01] the restoration, hallelujah, Revelation
[1:45:05] 10:7, Hallelujah. Revelation 10:1, the
[1:45:08] mighty angel came down. Hal with the
[1:45:11] prophecy of the word and brother speak
[1:45:14] the message. Hallelujah. Bam said, "What
[1:45:18] is this attraction?" and had a and and
[1:45:21] and transfiguration. He said what it is
[1:45:25] a message came for the people
[1:45:28] church the word of God come down to do
[1:45:31] what church but the people of God can
[1:45:34] catch the message in the day in which we
[1:45:36] are living in and when the people catch
[1:45:38] it. Hallelujah. Read it. The Bible said
[1:45:41] hallelujah. That little book.
[1:45:43] Hallelujah. Which book it is here? It is
[1:45:47] this little book. Hallelujah. It came up
[1:45:50] but it was open and you're able to read
[1:45:53] it. Come on church. You're able to see
[1:45:57] exactly what it is saying about you.

[1:46:20] church? Hallelujah. What are you doing,
[1:46:22] church? Brother Bam's message, it got to
[1:46:26] come alive in you.
[1:46:28] Got to move from just quotes and books
[1:46:30] and quotes and book to become a living
[1:46:33] reality.
[1:46:36] And so the Bible said this little book,
[1:46:40] the angel command John, this little book
[1:46:44] that is in the hands of the messenger,
[1:46:47] go take it. Hallelujah. Because here it
[1:46:50] is now, church. Hallelujah. There's a
[1:46:54] relationship
[1:46:55] behind seeing and heating. Oh my. If you
[1:47:00] see it, Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It's a
[1:47:03] time to heat. And if you heat it, you're
[1:47:07] becoming what you're heating. Are you
[1:47:09] there, church? If you can see it, you
[1:47:12] can heat it. So he said this little book
[1:47:15] that is in the the hands of a messenger,
[1:47:18] he said, "Take it and eat all of it."
[1:47:21] How much of it you must eat? Everything
[1:47:24] from Genesis to Revelation.
[1:47:27] Heat the book. Are you telling me,
[1:47:29] church? But what are you doing? You're
[1:47:32] looking in the context of the pages and

[1:47:43] tell you what, some of us tonight, you
[1:47:45] know, you know, some of us, we we behave
[1:47:47] like we're shy, you know, like when when
[1:47:49] we go out, we don't want to heat because
[1:47:51] I don't want Brother John to see me eat
[1:47:54] like this. Oh, church, listen. I'm
[1:47:56] telling you. If I'm hungry, I'm going to
[1:47:58] heat. Are you church? I'm not going to
[1:48:00] wait until Sunday morning. I'm going to
[1:48:02] say Hallelujah. All week I'm going to
[1:48:04] heat I'm going to look in the pages. I'm
[1:48:08] going to see what my papa say about me.
[1:48:10] Hallelujah. Are you there, my church?
[1:48:12] I'm going to heat all of it because the
[1:48:14] angel said, "And when you heat it, this
[1:48:18] bread, he said, John, you got to
[1:48:20] prophesy again." Are you me, church? Not
[1:48:23] see why that was done by Revelation
[1:48:26] 10:7. But you got to prophesy bride. In
[1:48:29] other words, church, the word that
[1:48:31] you're heating, you're becoming what
[1:48:33] you're heating.
[1:48:36] Hallelujah.
[1:48:37] Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. And so
[1:48:41] Joel said in verse 24, Hallelujah.
[1:48:46] Hallelujah. So we see an angel. He said
[1:48:50] he will bring the former rain.
[1:48:53] Hallelujah. What was it? It was a
[1:48:55] teaching reign to teach the people the
[1:48:58] things of God, the things you need to
[1:49:01] know. Are you me church? But what was
[1:49:03] it? Hallelujah. There got to come a
[1:49:06] time. Hallelujah. The time of the
[1:49:08] resurrection. Are you there me church?
[1:49:11] What is bringing the resurrection? The
[1:49:13] word of God in you is bringing a
[1:49:16] resurrection. Are you there me church?
[1:49:18] Hallelujah. So when you heat it, you're
[1:49:21] becoming more of the word. Are you there
[1:49:23] my church? What is it doing? It is
[1:49:26] bringing the resurrection of Christ in
[1:49:28] you.
[1:49:29] Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. And
[1:49:33] so when you hear it, hallelujah. He
[1:49:36] said, I'm going to send my messenger to
[1:49:39] restore hal a teaching reign.
[1:49:42] Hallelujah. But where the teaching come
[1:49:44] from? It wasn't church. Hallelujah. Just
[1:49:48] a man-made story. It wasn't another
[1:49:51] denomination.
[1:49:52] No sir. the basis of your redemption. It
[1:49:56] came directly from the hands of God. It
[1:49:59] came from eternity. Why church? Because
[1:50:02] now when you start heat, oh my. You see,
[1:50:06] all the ages, brother Mark, we have been
[1:50:08] heating in the ages and it wasn't doing
[1:50:11] us any good. But God said there got to
[1:50:13] come a time for resurrection power by
[1:50:17] the scripture event, church. And so what
[1:50:20] he does, he send the word uh from
[1:50:22] heaven, eternal word, eternal source,
[1:50:26] eternal power of the brighten heat. What
[1:50:30] are we heating, church? We're heating
[1:50:32] all the way back to eternity.
[1:50:35] Hallelujah. Oh my. Hallelujah.
[1:50:39] Hallelujah. And so Joel said verse 24,
[1:50:42] "And the floor shall be full with wheat,
[1:50:45] and the fat shall overwhelm overflow
[1:50:48] with wine and oil. And I will restore to
[1:50:52] you the hearers, the locust, as he did,
[1:50:56] the conquer worm, the caterpillar, the
[1:50:59] plumber worm, my great which I sent
[1:51:03] among you. And he shall he penetake. Oh
[1:51:07] my.
[1:51:09] Oh my. Are you hungry tonight? He said,
[1:51:12] "Blessed are he who hunger and thirst
[1:51:14] after righteousness, for you shall be
[1:51:17] filled." I said, "Church, hallelujah.
[1:51:20] Fill my cup, Lord. I lift it up, Lord.
[1:51:23] Oh, come and quench the thirsting of my
[1:51:26] soul. The bread of heaven, feed me until
[1:51:31] I want no more. And he shall eat in
[1:51:34] plenty and be satisfied and shall praise
[1:51:39] the name Hallelujah of the Lord your
[1:51:41] God. I wish somebody will lift your
[1:51:44] hands and said praise the Lord. Praise
[1:51:47] the Lord. Hallelujah. Because we are
[1:51:50] feasting at the master's table.
[1:51:54] He sent a messenger. Hallelujah. Thus
[1:51:57] say the Lord and the bride has catched
[1:52:01] the message for the hedge. And so church
[1:52:05] hallelujah that's why they cannot the
[1:52:07] church world will never understand the
[1:52:09] book of revelation. Why? Because it's
[1:52:12] you.
[1:52:14] It's you coming into being. It speaks
[1:52:17] hallelujah of you catching God's word
[1:52:21] believing it and becoming one with it.
[1:52:24] Hallelujah. And so, hallelujah. Praise
[1:52:27] God. And so, it got to come. If they
[1:52:30] want to see God, they got to see you
[1:52:33] because you become the expression, the
[1:52:35] revelation of God.
[1:52:39] Hallelujah.
[1:52:40] Hallelujah.
[1:52:42] Hallelujah.
[1:52:44] Amen. Brother said in the rapture
[1:52:47] message,
[1:52:48] Hallelujah. preached 1965.
[1:52:51] It's about to the church, the bride, the
[1:52:54] raptures is a revelation to her. It's
[1:52:57] revealing to her that the revelation,
[1:53:01] the true bride of Christ will be waiting
[1:53:04] for the revelation of the rapture. I
[1:53:06] said, "And it is a revelation
[1:53:10] for the revelation is faith. And you
[1:53:12] cannot have a re revelation without it
[1:53:15] being faith." He said faith is a
[1:53:17] revelation because it's something that
[1:53:20] revealed to you. He said faith is a
[1:53:22] revelation. Faith is something that has
[1:53:24] been revealed to you like it was to
[1:53:27] Abraham. I said that could call anything
[1:53:30] contrary to what has been revealed to
[1:53:33] him and though it was not. Hallelujah.
[1:53:36] and said now faith that's what faith is
[1:53:40] is a revelation of God and the church is
[1:53:43] built upon the revelation the whole
[1:53:46] entire body is built upon revelations.
[1:53:50] Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen.
[1:53:54] Hallelujah. Let me just get this in
[1:53:57] quickly.
[1:53:59] Amen. As we go down in the closing side
[1:54:01] of it. And so church, we find church
[1:54:06] that we are called to see. And if you
[1:54:09] see it, you got to eat it. Hallelujah.
[1:54:14] And if you eat it, you got to believe
[1:54:16] what you're hearing.
[1:54:18] Because it makes no sense that it is
[1:54:20] preached to you and you do not apply it.
[1:54:24] Are you there, church? It got to be
[1:54:27] real.
[1:54:28] It got to bear a real testimony upon
[1:54:31] your experience with the word. Are you
[1:54:34] there with me, church?
[1:54:36] Because the rapture and the resurrection
[1:54:39] is the word being made real to you.
[1:54:44] Are you there? Can I say that again?
[1:54:47] Hallelujah.
[1:54:49] We speak of the the rapture that is
[1:54:51] coming, but the rapture is already in
[1:54:54] progress.
[1:54:56] Why? Because the revelation is already
[1:54:59] in progress.
[1:55:01] Hallelujah. God in reality form.
[1:55:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. By the word is
[1:55:07] bringing the resurrection power by what?
[1:55:10] By the word.
[1:55:15] Hallelujah. We see Paul.
[1:55:18] Paul I just take two character from the
[1:55:22] scripture. Paul
[1:55:26] declaring him come and see. Paul was
[1:55:30] declaring this to a a bride age that he
[1:55:34] was called under Ephesians 1. Paul said
[1:55:38] Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ is
[1:55:40] Ephesians 1. By the will of God to the
[1:55:44] saints which are at Ephesus and to the
[1:55:47] faithful in Christ Jesus. Now remember
[1:55:50] now Paul was called a messenger to an
[1:55:53] age. He was given he was a prophet to
[1:55:57] declare the word of God and Paul had
[1:56:00] thus said the Lord. But what was the
[1:56:03] revelation? What did you see unto him?
[1:56:07] Paul catched the revelation of this
[1:56:09] bride of this gentile bride. And when
[1:56:13] Paul saw her, Paul saw her being
[1:56:17] positionally placed in Christ.
[1:56:20] Hallelujah. And so he wrote the letter
[1:56:23] to whom? To the bride of Christ that
[1:56:26] nobody knew about. Paul said, read the
[1:56:29] book of Ephesians 1, Paul. In Ephesians
[1:56:32] 1, Paul saw her in the mind of God. And
[1:56:35] Paul show that she was and will be
[1:56:38] adopted and positioned in a place. Paul
[1:56:42] saw her receiving the baptism of the
[1:56:45] Holy Ghost. Are you there, my church?
[1:56:48] Hallelujah. And so if you're reading it,
[1:56:51] Ephesians one, Paul showed the bride
[1:56:54] position.
[1:56:55] Ephesians 2, I'm I'm paraphrasing it,
[1:56:59] but Paul showed the the same covenant
[1:57:01] that Israel had. The bride has it.
[1:57:05] Hallelujah. Paul Ephesians 3, Paul
[1:57:08] identify her. Hallelujah. and show us
[1:57:11] the mystery of God. Oh my. Hallelujah.
[1:57:15] That God has hidden for all the ages. He
[1:57:19] said none of them in the ages knew about
[1:57:22] her. But there comes a time a messenger
[1:57:26] for age picks up on the word concerning
[1:57:29] this bride. And he spoke her. And
[1:57:32] because she was spoken by a prophet
[1:57:36] church, there got to come a bride. And
[1:57:39] this bride got to be adopted. Three,
[1:57:42] church. And if you can see, I say come
[1:57:44] and see Paul's revelation concerning
[1:57:47] her. Hallelujah. Verse five, Paul.
[1:57:50] Having predestinated us unto the
[1:57:52] adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:57:58] to himself according to the good
[1:58:00] pleasure of his will. Let's skip down to
[1:58:03] verse 15. And I want you to mark this
[1:58:05] very, it's very important. Verse 15. is
[1:58:08] a wherefore now this is now dealing with
[1:58:11] her speaking to her in a position by
[1:58:15] revelation that if she can catch this
[1:58:19] then she understand the mystery of God
[1:58:21] concerning herself in Christ
[1:58:25] but said wherefore I also after I heard
[1:58:28] of your faith in the Lord Jesus and love
[1:58:32] unto all the saints cease not to give
[1:58:35] thanks for you making mention of you in
[1:58:39] prayer that the God of our Lord Jesus
[1:58:43] Christ, the Father of glory may give
[1:58:46] unto you the spirit of wisdom and
[1:58:49] revelation in the knowledge of him.
[1:58:54] Hallelujah. He said that the eyes of
[1:58:57] your hand understanding being
[1:58:59] enlightened. In other word that you're
[1:59:01] able to see, hallelujah, by the wisdom
[1:59:05] and revelation of God, your position in
[1:59:09] Christ. Hallelujah. And if you're able
[1:59:11] to see it, Paul said that you may know
[1:59:14] what is the hope of his. Now listen
[1:59:17] church, when I saw this, how I start
[1:59:20] jotting because now, hallelujah. This
[1:59:23] has nothing to do with you and I. Are
[1:59:26] you hearing me church? Hallelujah. This
[1:59:28] mystery of this bride, this mystery of
[1:59:32] who you are has nothing to do with you.
[1:59:35] It is his hope. It is his calling. It is
[1:59:39] his word concerning you. Are you with
[1:59:42] me, church? What am I saying? Church,
[1:59:43] it's already declared.
[1:59:46] It's already spoken. Hallelujah. His
[1:59:49] calling and what the riches of the glory
[1:59:52] of his inheritance in the saint. And
[1:59:56] what is the exceeding greatness of his
[2:00:00] power to us to us? Word who believe
[2:00:04] according to the working of his mighty
[2:00:06] power. He said, "Which he walked in
[2:00:09] Christ when he raised him from the dead
[2:00:13] and set him at the right hand in the
[2:00:17] heavenly in heavenly places."
[2:00:19] Hallelujah. In other word, hallelujah.
[2:00:23] Hallelujah. This word that God has sent
[2:00:26] to you and I church, this mystery is to
[2:00:29] bring a resurrection.
[2:00:31] You see the body of Christ. Hallelujah.
[2:00:33] Praise God. Hallelujah. got to be
[2:00:36] raised, church. Hallelujah. We saw 2,000
[2:00:39] years ago, it came up because of the
[2:00:42] scripture. Hallelujah. It brought forth
[2:00:45] the perfect revelation of God by the
[2:00:48] scripture. Hallelujah. Jesus body.
[2:00:52] Hallelujah. Listen. That body that he
[2:00:54] had, he took it to the throne. But the
[2:00:56] bride becomes hal his body. Hallelujah.
[2:01:00] And just as how he rose that body from
[2:01:03] the grave by the scripture, church, this
[2:01:07] body of his. Oh church, he promised to
[2:01:11] bring forth a resurrection. May I tell
[2:01:13] you tonight?
[2:01:16] Oh, what a resurrection that was. But
[2:01:19] oh, what a resurrection this is. Are you
[2:01:22] me, church? Hallelujah. What is he doing
[2:01:25] in this resurrection? Oh my. I said this
[2:01:27] on close tonight.

[2:01:31] revelation of the bride? Hallelujah.
[2:01:35] Hallelujah. Bringing Christ on the
[2:01:37] scene. Hallelujah. The power of the
[2:01:39] resurrection, the word of God.
[2:01:42] Hallelujah. That which you heard from
[2:01:45] the prophet's message, church. It's not
[2:01:47] just word, but it's a reality. And so
[2:01:50] when you hear it and you say Lord you
[2:01:53] know instances of it we we call it
[2:01:56] flashes are a life signal that is coming
[2:01:59] in brotherham said the last sign that
[2:02:03] the bride will see is the word in flesh
[2:02:05] again. Do you know that the bride
[2:02:08] receive that sign? Church listen how
[2:02:11] many are running after sign. They're
[2:02:13] looking for the pope and say oh that's a
[2:02:16] sign. They're looking hallelujah for the
[2:02:19] the the homosexual and all of these
[2:02:20] things and they they saying oh it's a
[2:02:23] sign. They're looking at Israel and they
[2:02:25] said oh that's a sign. But Jesus said
[2:02:29] hallelujah they shall ask for a sign and
[2:02:32] none shall be given unto them but the
[2:02:34] sign of Jonah the prophet. Are you there
[2:02:37] me church which was a sign of a
[2:02:39] resurrection that as Jesus was in the
[2:02:42] heart of the hurt for three days and
[2:02:45] three night. Are you there me church?
[2:02:47] And he came out of the grave. Do you
[2:02:50] know church? God God has given you your
[2:02:53] sign. What was your sign that it was
[2:02:56] your time? It was your day. Your day of
[2:02:59] grace. Uh when the word of God will come
[2:03:02] back in power again by the resurrecting
[2:03:05] power of Jesus Christ. What was your
[2:03:08] sign church? He said, "I'm going to come
[2:03:10] down in the form of a prophet and he's
[2:03:13] going to speak to you in the name of the
[2:03:16] Lord." Oh church, when we saw brother
[2:03:18] Bradom, it wasn't just a man. It was God
[2:03:22] veiling a man speaking the eternal word.
[2:03:25] And that was your sign, church.
[2:03:27] Hallelujah. That the resurrection has
[2:03:29] started.
[2:03:32] Come on, church. Hallelujah. The
[2:03:35] resurrection has started. Why? God the
[2:03:38] prophet speaking the name of the Lord
[2:03:41] and the bride catch the word. And when
[2:03:43] the bride catch the word, the bride
[2:03:46] begin realizing, "Oh my, but the prophet
[2:03:49] say this and my life say this and the
[2:03:52] prophet say this and my family and or my
[2:03:55] my my my body or my experience."
[2:03:58] Hallelujah. Are you there with me,
[2:03:59] church? Hallelujah. But what is he
[2:04:02] doing? You see because we have heard the

[2:04:43] brought forth that sign of the
[2:04:45] resurrection in him to show church that
[2:04:48] the word that you're hearing hallelujah.
[2:04:50] Oh man, I feel like shouting. But the
[2:04:52] word that you're hearing is not dead
[2:04:55] letters. Come on church. The preacher is
[2:04:58] not preaching dead letters but life
[2:05:01] eternal. And if you can hear, if you can
[2:05:04] see it and you hear it, then you can
[2:05:07] become one with it. Are you there with
[2:05:09] church? And it doesn't matter what this
[2:05:12] enemy is doing. That word that you're
[2:05:14] hearing if you can say Lord I believe
[2:05:17] it. And you walk out and says from
[2:05:20] tonight my life hallelujah will never be
[2:05:24] the same. It will never be the same. And
[2:05:27] you watch your confession little by
[2:05:30] little, little by little, bit by bit.
[2:05:34] It's that change. Your tone, it shall
[2:05:37] change your thinking. Hallelujah. What
[2:05:39] is happening, church? The reality of
[2:05:43] God's word is been made alive in you.
[2:05:50] What am I saying to you tonight, church?
[2:05:53] The resurrection power
[2:05:55] is not in heaven, it's in you.
[2:06:00] It is a reality is a realization.
[2:06:05] It is simply to realize that it is
[2:06:08] there.
[2:06:10] But to realize it, you got to see it and
[2:06:13] you got to stand a firm upon the word of
[2:06:15] God.
[2:06:17] Hallelujah. In closing tonight, this is
[2:06:20] what I'm saying to you, church.
[2:06:22] The resurrection power is in the bride.
[2:06:25] Now
[2:06:27] you see the enemy is doing so many other
[2:06:31] things to distract the bride,
[2:06:35] but the bride is hearing the word of God
[2:06:40] and she's believing it
[2:06:45] and she's saying, "Lord,
[2:06:48] you know, God,
[2:06:50] you know, I speaking to brother Joe.
[2:06:52] Brother Joe, can I use an example?
[2:06:55] Brother Joe has some problem with his
[2:06:57] business. You know, things were not
[2:06:58] flowing as you know, he was expecting
[2:07:00] it.
[2:07:02] But brother Joe said, "I believe God."
[2:07:06] And out of the confession of his belief,
[2:07:10] God, come on church, changed the
[2:07:14] outcome.
[2:07:17] God changed the situation and brought
[2:07:19] forth a reality to him.
[2:07:23] What is he doing?
[2:07:25] Brother Joe, the next time you're at the
[2:07:28] same position, you know exactly what to
[2:07:30] do.
[2:07:34] Hallelujah.
[2:07:36] You know that the God that did it one
[2:07:39] time,
[2:07:41] he will do it again.

[2:07:48] it's not already done but it's your your
[2:07:51] revelation of it and as it reveals you
[2:07:55] enter into it and the more you enter
[2:07:58] into it. Oh my I have to say this but
[2:08:00] before I close this has been on my heart
[2:08:03] you know just allow five more minutes.

[2:08:09] The rapture
[2:08:11] is
[2:08:13] a process.
[2:08:16] What I'm saying to you now, a process
[2:08:18] that is bringing you into a realization
[2:08:23] because it's not about go you're sick
[2:08:25] and God healing you. Isn't it has never
[2:08:26] been about that, but it's about you
[2:08:29] realizing that the word of God is alive
[2:08:32] in you.
[2:08:35] And so the more hallelujah you come into
[2:08:39] that reality that I'm saying that the
[2:08:42] more Satan challenge you the more you
[2:08:45] can exhibit your right to that reality
[2:08:50] to to to to bring that reality into
[2:08:52] being.
[2:08:54] So
[2:08:56] it's not that the situation can stop you
[2:08:59] but it was given to bring that reality
[2:09:02] because this is what has happened now
[2:09:03] church you see in our conscious mind we
[2:09:08] we live our lives here brother we we
[2:09:10] have our being we like myself I've been
[2:09:12] going to school a long time we we work
[2:09:14] we labor we study we we do we build we
[2:09:17] we we do all sort of things here
[2:09:21] and we accept this life you know it feel
[2:09:24] like something you embrace as as a
[2:09:26] reality. Well, it's not.
[2:09:29] But God is changing our experience
[2:09:31] really. How is he doing that? Oh my. You
[2:09:35] see
[2:09:39] the other realm, the other dimension
[2:09:43] that we will go to is already here.
[2:09:47] [Music]
[2:09:48] The dead saints, they are here.
[2:09:52] the angel of God, they are here.
[2:09:56] Everything that you're looking for is
[2:09:59] already here.
[2:10:01] But why are you not seeing it? You need
[2:10:05] a revelation.
[2:10:08] And so what God is doing, hallelujah,
[2:10:11] it's like we're here and little by
[2:10:14] little, bit by bit, when you hear the
[2:10:17] word, it's breaking you into more of the
[2:10:21] reality of God. But what it is doing,
[2:10:23] church, it's bringing into into that
[2:10:25] rapturing process.
[2:10:28] Because what is happening is that one
[2:10:30] day, one morning between 6:00 and 9.
[2:10:34] Hallelujah. But Mark, you're going to
[2:10:36] look around and you're going to see
[2:10:39] people that
[2:10:42] I know that's a person
[2:10:45] that that look like a sister I know that
[2:10:46] died 50 years ago.
[2:10:50] So, wow, that's really her. She doesn't
[2:10:52] look like the real person.
[2:10:56] This what I'm saying to you? That's what
[2:10:59] the healing experience is doing for you.
[2:11:03] It is awakening the consciousness of the
[2:11:06] other side.
[2:11:09] That's why brother Brandham said pray
[2:11:11] for revelation because the more
[2:11:13] revelation the more God break you into
[2:11:16] that reality.
[2:11:17] But one day, hallelujah. Come on,
[2:11:20] brother John. You can come. One day,
[2:11:25] one morning, you know, there is a
[2:11:29] there's a sign to that really
[2:11:32] that before
[2:11:34] the resurrection, before that final
[2:11:37] morning,
[2:11:39] you know that when the Bible said that
[2:11:40] when Jesus rose from the dead and he
[2:11:43] walked the earth for 40 days,
[2:11:47] for 40 days. Hallelujah.
[2:11:51] You know, the bride
[2:11:53] will go in that spare of realizing
[2:11:57] that, hey, the dead saints are here.
[2:12:02] And for 40 days, that's the last sign
[2:12:04] really.
[2:12:07] And if you're here, the Lord tell us if
[2:12:10] we're still here. Listen, if you're
[2:12:12] making the rapture, faith must become a
[2:12:15] reality personally to you. And when it
[2:12:19] does church, it brings you right across.
[2:12:23] So may I ask you what the quest what
[2:12:25] what what this question have asked.
[2:12:26] What's the rapture? What's the
[2:12:28] resurrection? Just a change.
[2:12:32] What a change. Hallelujah. One minute
[2:12:35] you are here
[2:12:37] and another minute you just can step
[2:12:40] across.
[2:12:43] You just step across the other
[2:12:44] dimension. That's all it is. This great
[2:12:50] It becomes so real to you that you said,
[2:12:53] "Hey man, I'm just tired of this world.
[2:12:55] I'm tired of this. I'm I'm just going
[2:12:58] across." You just step across.
[2:13:03] So watch those experiences.
[2:13:06] Bring them back to the word and watch
[2:13:08] God comes on the scene in your life. God
[2:13:11] bless you tonight.
[2:13:22] Praise the Lord. God bless you. Let's
[2:13:23] stand if we would.
[2:13:27] Well, I'll tell you, I got worried when
[2:13:28] he started talking about an absolute.
[2:13:31] I just started preaching on absolute
[2:13:33] power last service and then he opened
[2:13:35] with that. I said, "Don't you dare,
[2:13:36] buddy. Don't you dare." And sure enough,
[2:13:39] he started, but he turned. Amen. But
[2:13:41] it's not my word. It's not my spirit.
[2:13:45] It's not my pulpit. Amen. It's up to the
[2:13:47] Lord to lead that. That was wonderful. I
[2:13:50] only have three things I want to say.
[2:13:52] One, Lord, mix up his notes anytime you
[2:13:54] want. Doesn't seem to have any effect.
[2:13:56] It was wonderful. Amen. And I don't want
[2:13:58] to start because I'll start preaching my
[2:13:59] service from Sunday. But you know, he
[2:14:02] was talking about the odds don't matter.
[2:14:04] When he said that, I thought about Sarah
[2:14:06] because you look at Sarah. Sarah had a
[2:14:08] baby at 90 years old. Since the flood,
[2:14:13] no one had ever had a baby at 90. And
[2:14:16] since Sarah, nobody else has. She's the
[2:14:20] only one to have a baby at 90 years old
[2:14:25] in the history of the world since the
[2:14:27] flood. How? By the word.
[2:14:31] We're not making it because it's doable,
[2:14:35] because it's reasonable, because it's
[2:14:38] probable.
[2:14:40] We're doing it because his word says it
[2:14:42] even though everything else says it's
[2:14:45] impossible. That's the only way we're
[2:14:47] going to make it. Amen.
[2:14:49] You may be the only one in history that
[2:14:52] defeats your battle. Everyone else may
[2:14:55] fail, but we've been made more than
[2:14:57] conquerors.
[2:14:59] Amen. Would you play that softly as I
[2:15:02] talk just a moment more? You know, but
[2:15:04] he talked about at the end. He was
[2:15:05] talking about if you can see it, you can
[2:15:08] eat it.
[2:15:10] Why don't we see it? Cuz we're looking
[2:15:13] at other things.
[2:15:15] Why don't we eat it? Cuz we've been
[2:15:18] eating other things.
[2:15:20] Can I Can I tell on myself this evening?
[2:15:23] My wife is a wonderful cook. But
[2:15:26] sometimes I don't really want what she
[2:15:28] eats. You know why?
[2:15:30] because every 30 minutes I'm going in
[2:15:31] the pantry and I'm taking a handful of
[2:15:33] chippets,
[2:15:35] chocolate chips,
[2:15:38] and I'm eating them. And so by the time
[2:15:40] I get to supper, I'm not really hungry
[2:15:43] cuz why? I've been eating the stuff that
[2:15:46] really works my pallet the way I like
[2:15:49] it. And so when I come to what would
[2:15:51] really do me some good, I'm already
[2:15:54] mostly full. I'm satisfied.
[2:15:58] Sometimes the reason we don't have what
[2:15:59] we're looking for in our life is because
[2:16:00] we're satisfying it the other way.
[2:16:04] We're looking at the wrong thing so we
[2:16:06] don't see the right thing. We're eating
[2:16:09] the snacks so we're not hungry for the
[2:16:11] main course. And then we say, "Where is
[2:16:14] Jesus?
[2:16:16] Where's the word?" And he says, "It's
[2:16:19] been there all along. You just haven't
[2:16:20] been looking at it. You just haven't
[2:16:22] been eating it." Church, problem's not
[2:16:24] the word. Problem's not the spirit.
[2:16:28] problems this flesh that says, "Give me
[2:16:30] what I want rather than what I need." So
[2:16:33] many times, amen,
[2:16:35] but he giveth more grace
[2:16:38] and he pours out his spirit and he says,
[2:16:40] "I'm not going to stop. I'm not going to
[2:16:43] hold back. I'm going to keep calling.
[2:16:44] I'm going to keep feeding. I'm going to
[2:16:46] keep opening the word until we walk off
[2:16:49] this earth together." Amen. God is so
[2:16:51] good to us. Amen. I sure enjoyed that,
[2:16:53] Brother Garfield. You can preach
[2:16:55] anytime. Amen. God bless you each one.
[2:16:58] We're going to sing the song. We've been
[2:16:59] made more than conquerors.
[2:17:03] And we've been made more than coner.
[2:17:10] It's overcomers
[2:17:13] in this life.
[2:17:18] And we've been made
[2:17:20] victorious
[2:17:22] [Music]
[2:17:25] through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[2:17:29] [Music]
[2:17:32] And we've been made more than coner,
[2:17:37] [Music]

[2:18:11] in this life.

[2:33:15] like home to come back and
[2:33:17] see familiar faces and uh just the
[2:33:20] spirit of Newfoundland that's still
[2:33:23] alive and well, but more the spirit of
[2:33:25] God that's still here and thriving and
[2:33:28] just so thankful to meet many faces that
[2:33:31] I've never met before, but uh just so
[2:33:34] thankful for each and every one of you.
[2:33:35] So, thank you for that. God bless you
[2:33:36] richly. We'll be in prayer for you. You
[2:33:38] be in prayer for us. Really appreciate
[2:33:39] that. Amen. Why don't we just bow our

[2:33:45] you so much for coming to meet with us
[2:33:48] this evening, Lord. Lord, thank you for
[2:33:50] your precious word, Lord, for the vessel
[2:33:53] that was able to set himself aside,
[2:33:55] Lord. And
[2:33:57] Lord, as your presence just fill this
[2:33:59] place, Lord, it just gives us such
[2:34:00] peace, Lord, in the middle of a work
[2:34:02] week, Lord, in the middle of the chaos
[2:34:04] of the world and the mess and the evil.
[2:34:06] Lord Jesus, we're just so thankful for
[2:34:08] this sanctuary that you've given to us,
[2:34:11] Lord Jesus, and thankful for this little
[2:34:13] congregation here, Lord Jesus. And God,
[2:34:16] we just ask that you would go with each
[2:34:18] and every one, Lord.
[2:34:21] God, for the ones that need courage,
