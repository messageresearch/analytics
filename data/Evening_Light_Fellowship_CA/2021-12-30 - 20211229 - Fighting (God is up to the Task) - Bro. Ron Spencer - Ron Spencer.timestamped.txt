[59:26] even
[59:27] the formed god
[59:29] of our salvation salah
[59:33] he that is our god
[59:36] is the god of salvation
[59:39] and under god the lord
[59:42] belonged the issues from death
[59:45] but god
[59:46] shall wound the head of his enemies
[59:50] and the hairy scalp
[59:53] of such as one as goeth on steel
[59:58] in his trespasses
[1:00:00] ephesians chapter 6 and verse 10
[1:00:04] very familiar portion of scripture
[1:00:06] finally my brethren be strong in the
[1:00:08] lord
[1:00:10] and in the power of his might
[1:00:12] and put on the whole armor of god that
[1:00:14] you may be able to stand against the
[1:00:16] wiles of the devil
[1:00:18] for we wrestle not against flesh and
[1:00:20] blood but against principalities
[1:00:23] against powers against the rulers of the
[1:00:26] darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:00:28] wickedness in high places
[1:00:30] wherefore take unto you the whole armor
[1:00:33] of god
[1:00:34] that you may be able to
[1:00:36] to withstand
[1:00:38] in the evil day
[1:00:39] and having done all to stand
[1:00:44] amen you may be seated
[1:00:48] in the passion translations of psalms
[1:00:51] chapter 68 and 19 through 21 that i just
[1:00:54] read you
[1:00:57] it says it like this
[1:00:58] what a glorious god
[1:01:02] he gives us salvation over and over
[1:01:05] then daily he carries our burdens
[1:01:09] paul's
[1:01:10] in his presence
[1:01:12] our god is a mighty god
[1:01:16] who saves us over and over
[1:01:21] for the lord yahweh rescues us from the
[1:01:26] ways of death
[1:01:28] many times
[1:01:33] but he will crush
[1:01:35] every enemy
[1:01:38] shattering
[1:01:40] their strength
[1:01:42] he will make heads roll
[1:01:46] for they refuse to repent of their
[1:01:49] stubborn and sinful ways
[1:01:53] i want to just subtitle this tonight god
[1:01:56] is up to the task
[1:01:59] if your god's too small i want you to
[1:02:01] introduce you to my god he's a great big
[1:02:04] god
[1:02:05] he's a god that spoke the worlds into
[1:02:08] existence believed his own word
[1:02:13] spoke it believed his own word and it
[1:02:16] came into existence
[1:02:17] my god
[1:02:19] had a prophet standing on a wide open
[1:02:22] red sea
[1:02:24] and he put a phenomenal interstate right
[1:02:27] through dry ground
[1:02:30] and then
[1:02:31] destroyed every everything
[1:02:55] that's our god
[1:02:58] i want you to understand and this might
[1:03:00] be even for you
[1:03:02] the critic that you have today
[1:03:06] the critic that has been against you
[1:03:10] that critic
[1:03:11] is the one
[1:03:14] the very one that testifies to the fact
[1:03:18] that you're a masterpiece
[1:03:24] did you get it
[1:03:26] your critic
[1:03:27] is testifying to you that you are a
[1:03:31] masterpiece
[1:03:34] they're actually giving testimony
[1:03:37] in their criticism of how great you
[1:03:39] really are
[1:03:42] i want you to understand tonight as a
[1:03:43] christian we are in a war
[1:03:46] brother branham explains that to us over
[1:03:48] and over again we've not in a picnic but
[1:03:51] we're in a war
[1:03:52] we expect struggles
[1:03:54] we expect disappointments
[1:03:57] but we are not dependent on our
[1:03:59] abilities
[1:04:00] or our gifts
[1:04:02] we are totally dependent on god
[1:04:07] are you with me when i would give up
[1:04:09] when i would have enough energies when i
[1:04:11] don't have enough strength god's always
[1:04:13] there
[1:04:15] so he tells us to put on the whole armor
[1:04:18] because we are at war
[1:04:21] remember who your greatest enemy is
[1:04:25] it's not your wife it's not your husband
[1:04:27] it's not your pastor it's not the
[1:04:28] governor it's you
[1:04:31] it's your flesh
[1:04:33] look in the mirror
[1:04:34] analyze it just a bit it's an enemy
[1:04:37] but i want you to know the token can
[1:04:40] live on the inside of that piece of
[1:04:42] flesh
[1:04:43] and can conquer every enemy that you've
[1:04:46] got inside of you
[1:04:50] brother brown taught us about the
[1:04:51] greatest battle is in our mind it's a
[1:04:53] place where it's a no man's land
[1:04:55] god and satan
[1:04:57] chose a place in the human body to which
[1:05:00] to battle at is in your mind
[1:05:03] are you with me now
[1:05:05] so we understand the battle
[1:05:08] we understand boxing brother brahm tells
[1:05:11] us of how many fights that he fought he
[1:05:13] only had one that was a draw but he had
[1:05:16] he had incredible amount of fights that
[1:05:19] he won
[1:05:20] and so god was training him as a young
[1:05:23] man
[1:05:24] to know that one of these days you're
[1:05:26] going to be in a battle
[1:05:27] it's not going to be in a ring but it's
[1:05:29] going to be in a pulpit
[1:05:34] it's going to be in a pulpit
[1:05:36] so whether whether you realize they're
[1:05:39] not even at church there's a battle
[1:05:41] that's going on and we're not battling
[1:05:44] throwing stones at one another or trying
[1:05:46] to see who the weakest link in his
[1:05:48] church but we're in battle with a spirit
[1:05:52] that's trying to bring unbelief
[1:05:55] trying to get you out of your position
[1:05:58] tell you how weak that you are that
[1:06:00] you'll never overcome but god's already
[1:06:03] told you
[1:06:11] now sometimes in a boxing match there's
[1:06:14] a little bit of shadow boxing that goes
[1:06:16] on
[1:06:17] kind of the testings of strength
[1:06:19] showing the moves backwards and falls
[1:06:22] but we have come to the round to where
[1:06:24] that we must stand toe-to-toe with the
[1:06:27] enemy
[1:06:32] are you with me
[1:06:33] somewhere another you got to stand
[1:06:35] toe-to-toe with him
[1:06:36] you're not dancing away from him no more
[1:06:39] you're not trying to show him some silly
[1:06:40] moves you just know that you're in a
[1:06:43] battle and it's
[1:06:44] it's game on
[1:06:48] that may not be the proper way to say it
[1:06:50] but it's game on
[1:06:53] a lot of people say well i oh i've been
[1:06:55] in a fight with the devil
[1:06:57] most of the time it's just a big hugging
[1:06:59] match
[1:07:06] a lot of words being exchanged
[1:07:09] but we're warriors
[1:07:11] and people that are fighters they never
[1:07:13] give up
[1:07:16] now our real thought
[1:07:18] is when you got your eyes blacked
[1:07:21] blood's running out of your nose you
[1:07:23] can't see the guy in front of you
[1:07:26] you got swell lips
[1:07:29] then you can say you've been in a real
[1:07:31] fight
[1:07:37] a lot of people talk about how bad the
[1:07:39] devil's been to them all week long why
[1:07:41] don't you testify to the other end how
[1:07:43] great god's been for you
[1:07:45] [Applause]
[1:07:54] now
[1:07:55] let me just say this to you
[1:07:58] i would rather pay attention to god's
[1:08:00] promises
[1:08:02] than to pay attention to satan's threats
[1:08:07] come on church
[1:08:09] let's just go ahead and get let's just
[1:08:11] go ahead and get ready
[1:08:14] remember the scripture tells us that no
[1:08:16] weapon that is formed against you shall
[1:08:18] prosper
[1:08:20] no weapon no matter what the name of it
[1:08:22] is
[1:08:23] every person in this building is going
[1:08:25] through different things in their life
[1:08:28] maybe you think that nobody cares nobody
[1:08:30] think you think nobody knows nobody
[1:08:33] nobody understands your situation but i
[1:08:35] want you to know there's one greater
[1:08:37] than a preacher there's one greater than
[1:08:40] any man that is in the building
[1:08:44] many times we get hurt attitudes
[1:08:47] we get hurt feelings
[1:08:50] we get bruised
[1:08:52] we get achy even as christians
[1:08:56] we even get a little squeaky
[1:08:59] to wear that we can't lift our hands or
[1:09:01] even saying amen
[1:09:06] but if you can only get it in your mind
[1:09:08] i'm better than any loser
[1:09:11] i am not a quitter
[1:09:13] and i'm never going to turn back
[1:09:16] [Applause]
[1:09:19] i am focused
[1:09:22] i do not fear
[1:09:25] and i refuse to be afraid
[1:09:29] satan begins to stack the odds against
[1:09:32] you
[1:09:33] you just start reminding him
[1:09:36] how big your god is
[1:09:40] are you with me satan begins to stack
[1:09:43] the odds against you
[1:09:45] you start reminding him how big your god
[1:09:48] is
[1:09:55] it's come to me this week
[1:09:58] you will never find your eagle wings
[1:10:01] in a nest of safety
[1:10:08] sometimes papa god's got to drop you off
[1:10:10] of a cliff
[1:10:16] so you'll find your wings
[1:10:23] are you with me now
[1:10:24] see i can preach this from perspective
[1:10:28] a lot of people can preach this because
[1:10:30] it sounds good but i can preach it
[1:10:32] because i'm standing in it
[1:10:34] [Applause]
[1:10:37] and i ain't no chicken-hearted preacher
[1:10:40] i have never been a chicken-hearted
[1:10:41] preacher i ain't no hearty preacher now
[1:10:51] i want to remind you before the devil
[1:10:53] can ever get to your flesh or to your
[1:10:55] spirit he's first had to have a meeting
[1:10:57] with god
[1:10:59] and god's got confidence in you that you
[1:11:01] can go through the battle because the
[1:11:04] devil can't touch a hair of your head
[1:11:06] until he first goes and gets permission
[1:11:08] from almighty god
[1:11:09] so when you're going through a trial
[1:11:11] remember go out and say go ahead
[1:11:16] go ahead i got confidence in the seed
[1:11:19] that i put on the inside of him
[1:11:31] it's not confidence in your flesh it's
[1:11:33] confidence in that life seed that's
[1:11:36] laying down inside of there to where you
[1:11:38] can't see but just when you feel like
[1:11:41] giving up it takes a hold of your life
[1:11:44] [Applause]
[1:11:50] now i want you to understand this
[1:11:53] regardless of your trial this week
[1:11:56] regardless of your critic
[1:11:58] i want to say this to you
[1:12:00] all things
[1:12:06] all things work together
[1:12:10] for good to them that love god
[1:12:15] amen
[1:12:19] you know why satan loves to stir up
[1:12:21] family problems at christmas
[1:12:24] [Music]
[1:12:28] am i talking to you now
[1:12:31] he likes to stir up family problems
[1:12:33] knowing you're going to get together
[1:12:36] cause if you begin to fight in your
[1:12:37] flesh he'll whip you every time but if
[1:12:40] you get together and you're having a
[1:12:41] revival and those licks of fire come
[1:12:44] together
[1:12:46] he knows that two of you on the same
[1:12:48] side can whip him every time
[1:12:51] two is a majority any two touching one
[1:12:54] thing it shall be done
[1:12:57] so he likes to get your focus on
[1:12:59] humanity or hurt feelings a hurt
[1:13:03] attitude you gotta take the opposite
[1:13:08] we're here to celebrate jesus we're not
[1:13:11] here to celebrate the devil and all his
[1:13:13] wickedness
[1:13:15] [Applause]
[1:13:20] hallelujah
[1:13:21] [Applause]
[1:13:28] for whom he did for no
[1:13:34] he did also predestinate to be conformed
[1:13:37] to the image of his son that he might be
[1:13:39] the firstborn among many brethren
[1:13:42] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:13:44] he also called and whom he called them
[1:13:45] he also justified and whom he justified
[1:13:48] them he also glorified i want you to
[1:13:50] understand our infinite god who has
[1:13:54] chosen you to be the battle of this
[1:13:56] laodicean age
[1:13:58] he has built you to overcome
[1:14:03] he elected you when you couldn't elect
[1:14:06] yourself
[1:14:08] he called you when you couldn't call
[1:14:10] yourself he slipped the predestinated
[1:14:13] wedding band on you before the
[1:14:15] foundation of the world
[1:14:22] the battlegrounds are lined up what

[1:19:35] and you can speak to the devil say get
[1:19:37] out of here
[1:19:38] in the name of jesus christ

[1:20:26] whole wide world
[1:20:47] now paul is going to write these words
[1:20:49] not from a posh
[1:20:51] office
[1:20:54] it's going to be from a dungeon
[1:20:57] what shall we say to these things if god
[1:21:00] before us who can be against us
[1:21:03] he that spared not his own son but
[1:21:05] delivering up for us all how shall we
[1:21:08] he not with us freely give us all things
[1:21:14] everything in heaven belongs to us
[1:21:17] we're not a bunch of beggars we're not
[1:21:19] sitting on the corner
[1:21:21] we're the sign
[1:21:24] we are god's children
[1:21:27] we have more authority than an archangel
[1:21:29] that's in heaven
[1:21:32] so we're not
[1:21:34] we're not roman catholics we're not
[1:21:36] begging

[1:21:45] children amen
[1:21:47] amen
[1:21:52] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:21:54] god's elect it is god that justifieth
[1:21:58] who is he that condemneth it is christ
[1:22:01] that died yea rather is risen again who
[1:22:03] is even at the right hand of god who
[1:22:05] maketh intercession for us
[1:22:07] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:22:09] christ shall tribulation or distress or
[1:22:13] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:22:16] pearl sword
[1:22:19] nay and all these things we're more than
[1:22:22] conquerors through him that loved us
[1:22:26] for i am persuaded that neither death
[1:22:28] nor life nor angels or principalities
[1:22:31] nor power shall be able to separate us
[1:22:37] no things to come
[1:22:38] no height nor death or any other
[1:22:40] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:22:42] from the love of god which is in christ
[1:22:44] jesus
[1:22:46] our lord
[1:22:48] i've read this to you before i want to
[1:22:50] read it to you now be still and know
[1:22:53] that i'm god
[1:22:55] i'm bigger than your problem

[1:23:01] i'm bigger than your situation this is
[1:23:04] not your battle
[1:23:06] you don't have to handle this this is
[1:23:08] god's battle
[1:23:10] god will work it out all you have to do
[1:23:13] is be still and know that i am god
[1:23:18] god's purpose can never be defeated the
[1:23:20] prophet tells us
[1:23:22] there is nothing that can defeat it
[1:23:25] so how happy we ought to be today
[1:23:28] resting upon the beautiful revelation of
[1:23:30] the word of the living god
[1:23:32] that there is neither things present
[1:23:34] no things that can come
[1:23:36] there's no sickness
[1:23:39] no sorrow
[1:23:41] no death
[1:23:43] no perils
[1:23:44] nor nothing can separate us from the
[1:23:47] love of the living god
[1:23:49] purpose of the living god what god has
[1:23:51] imagined in his mind what god has
[1:23:54] purposed in his heart
[1:23:57] [Music]
[1:23:58] to bring to pass there's no demon
[1:24:02] there's no power
[1:24:03] there is nothing that can separate us
[1:24:06] from god's immortal eternal plan
[1:24:09] it must be as god said it
[1:24:14] [Music]
[1:24:16] he cares for you just listen to this he
[1:24:17] said cast your cares upon him
[1:24:21] too many times we carry our cares
[1:24:27] your energy will run out

[1:24:36] he cares for you
[1:24:39] be sincere about it
[1:24:42] you care enough to be sincere
[1:24:44] for he has proven by his vindicated word
[1:24:46] that he cares
[1:24:48] he promised to send it
[1:24:51] he's done it
[1:24:52] he promised him the word
[1:24:55] here it is
[1:24:56] he cares
[1:24:58] now what about you
[1:25:03] it's you
[1:25:05] ought to care next
[1:25:09] he cared enough he cared enough to
[1:25:13] conquer every enemy
[1:25:15] for you
[1:25:17] that all you have to do is be sincere
[1:25:20] and believe it
[1:25:22] he conquered death
[1:25:25] death
[1:25:26] ain't nothing to me to conquer
[1:25:30] it's already conquered
[1:25:34] sickness ain't for me to conquer
[1:25:38] it's christ it ain't for christ to
[1:25:41] conquer
[1:25:42] it's already conquered
[1:25:50] are you with me
[1:25:51] the battle you're fighting has already
[1:25:52] been taken care of
[1:25:59] the battle you're fighting's already
[1:26:01] been taken care of
[1:26:03] round your shoulders back
[1:26:08] come on church
[1:26:09] there was a man named muhammad ali
[1:26:13] most of the time he talked people into
[1:26:16] defeat
[1:26:17] before they ever got in the rink
[1:26:21] he had already whipped them with his
[1:26:23] mouth
[1:26:26] he would say i fly like a butterfly and
[1:26:28] i sting like a bee
[1:26:30] i am muhammad ali
[1:26:35] lay on the ropes
[1:26:36] let him beat him beat him beat him and
[1:26:38] he would wave to the audience
[1:26:41] matter of fact many times he'd turn
[1:26:43] around and talk to everybody in the
[1:26:45] audience
[1:26:48] and the fight was going on
[1:26:51] cause he knowed he'd done got this guy
[1:26:53] whipped
[1:26:55] and he's punching and beating and
[1:26:57] sweating and frailing and using all of
[1:27:00] his energy and in just a few minutes
[1:27:03] ali will be standing like this right
[1:27:04] here
[1:27:07] another victory
[1:27:08] another victory brother on but that's
[1:27:10] the world what about children of god
[1:27:17] just stand and have victory with the
[1:27:19] word of god
[1:27:21] oh you'll never defeat him with your
[1:27:23] flesh
[1:27:26] you'll never defeat him with your words
[1:27:28] but god gave you his words
[1:27:34] now there's a major difference between
[1:27:36] you and the world denominational system
[1:27:41] they know the right scriptures they know
[1:27:43] the right words but because you are who
[1:27:46] you are
[1:27:47] [Music]
[1:27:52] you have ambassador privileges
[1:27:56] and your words
[1:27:58] have power like angel's words
[1:28:01] hallelujah and because of your position
[1:28:06] those words have power
[1:28:08] they're like a seed a word has a seed it
[1:28:11] has a thought it was a thought and then
[1:28:14] that seed was expressed and it becomes
[1:28:17] flesh
[1:28:19] and the more you quote the word of god
[1:28:22] you abide in me and my words about and
[1:28:24] you ask what you will and it shall be
[1:28:26] done unto you
[1:28:27] smith wigglesworth would walk into his
[1:28:29] patience to pray for them and said you
[1:28:31] start quoting this scripture
[1:28:33] and you quote it until you believe it
[1:28:36] and after you really believe it get up
[1:28:38] go home
[1:28:40] you're going to be all right
[1:28:42] if you abided me and my words about in
[1:28:45] you ask what you will and it shall be
[1:28:48] done unto you
[1:28:51] [Music]
[1:28:54] it's already concert i just have to care
[1:28:57] enough to believe it
[1:28:58] are you afraid of what somebody else has
[1:29:01] told you are you afraid of the doctor's
[1:29:04] diagnosis are you afraid of what the
[1:29:07] church will say to you are you afraid to
[1:29:09] stand there toe-to-toe
[1:29:14] to the devil
[1:29:18] there's some moments you've got to stand
[1:29:20] toe-to-toe
[1:29:21] and the shadow boxing is over with
[1:29:24] and the dancing is over with and it's
[1:29:27] time to brawl
[1:29:34] hallelujah it's just time to prawn cause

[1:35:53] around you to keep you up you ready
[1:35:56] sometimes you'll have to stand alone in
[1:35:58] your own conviction sometimes you got to
[1:36:00] stand alone and fight
[1:36:08] thank you
[1:36:10] thank you when you think people ain't
[1:36:12] watching

[1:36:17] and the difference is him
[1:36:20] [Music]
[1:36:21] the difference is him
[1:36:28] sometimes you got to meet the challenge
[1:36:33] running from your enemy
[1:36:36] is not the answer
[1:36:40] sometimes you just got to meet the
[1:36:42] challenge
[1:36:46] got to raise your head above all the
[1:36:48] nonsense
[1:36:51] all the noise
[1:36:53] all the fanaticism
[1:36:56] stand like a real man or a real lady
[1:37:00] at the end of the day
[1:37:03] people like people that are real
[1:37:11] these children can see through a fake
[1:37:17] they can see through artificial
[1:37:20] but when you're a real christian
[1:37:24] and you think nobody's noticing
[1:37:27] generally everybody's watching
[1:37:32] and many times you will mentor others in
[1:37:35] the church
[1:37:37] and they'll never say nothing to you

[1:37:54] everything's good
[1:37:58] anybody can serve the lord when
[1:38:00] everything's going good
[1:38:02] but let hell turn upside down on you
[1:38:07] and you stand there and shake the devil
[1:38:09] off of you one at a time
[1:38:12] [Applause]
[1:38:14] no you're not gonna whip a thousand all
[1:38:16] in one second but just whip one
[1:38:20] and then whip the next one
[1:38:22] and then whip the next are you getting
[1:38:23] the point here
[1:38:25] brother right but it's so big just start
[1:38:27] whipping one at a time
[1:38:37] you've heard me read this to you before
[1:38:40] courage

[1:38:56] we don't back up
[1:38:59] nor do we back down
[1:39:02] we fight
[1:39:04] he shelters us under his wings
[1:39:07] he fights our battles
[1:39:10] he wins our wars
[1:39:13] we cast satan out with holy ghost
[1:39:15] boldness
[1:39:17] he has authorized us and empowered us to
[1:39:20] use the name of jesus for any need at
[1:39:24] any time under any condition
[1:39:28] and we believe
[1:39:33] taking him at his word
[1:39:36] by the authority
[1:39:38] and casting out satan
[1:39:40] and reminding the devil of who
[1:39:44] we
[1:39:44] are
[1:39:50] but first of all you got to know who you
[1:39:52] are
[1:39:56] not because a preacher convinced you
[1:40:00] but you got to know sure-footed of who
[1:40:02] you are
[1:40:09] when that rock left david's sling
[1:40:13] and he saw the trajectory
[1:40:16] of that rock
[1:40:17] as it hit that helmet
[1:40:20] and it crushed that helmet
[1:40:22] and that giant fell
[1:40:28] you know it's amazing
[1:40:30] earlier that morning that guy was a
[1:40:33] champion to all his people oh yeah
[1:40:37] but when he hit the ground
[1:40:40] all of a sudden their heart almost
[1:40:43] fainted
[1:40:45] because their champion is dead
[1:40:47] i got news for you my champion went to
[1:40:49] calvary
[1:40:50] [Applause]
[1:40:52] he conquered everything that could be
[1:40:54] conquered
[1:40:55] he went to hell
[1:40:57] and took the keys of death hell and the
[1:41:00] grave
[1:41:01] my champion has never lost the battle
[1:41:08] when our prophet would stand and he
[1:41:10] would go he's here
[1:41:12] i take every spirit
[1:41:15] under the sound of my voice
[1:41:17] under my control
[1:41:23] an open-air meeting
[1:41:25] hundreds of thousands of people
[1:41:28] as brother jackson sidney jackson would
[1:41:30] say
[1:41:31] even the dogs quit barking
[1:41:36] it was total steal when that prophet
[1:41:38] said i take every spirit
[1:41:41] under the sound of my voice under
[1:41:42] control
[1:41:44] don't you know the devil knew he was
[1:41:46] talking about
[1:41:49] he knew then
[1:41:51] who was standing on the stage
[1:41:54] more than a little prophet
[1:41:58] come on church
[1:42:00] oh in this age he wants to raise his
[1:42:02] head
[1:42:04] and try to be against the message after
[1:42:06] the prophet's been gone 50 years
[1:42:09] [Applause]
[1:42:11] but where was that enemy at that night
[1:42:15] [Applause]
[1:42:19] when he standed there in chicago
[1:42:21] and those preachers had laid a trap for
[1:42:23] him
[1:42:26] and he asked them he invited him which
[1:42:28] of you will come and stand against me
[1:42:30] and not one of them
[1:42:32] [Applause]
[1:42:34] not one of them
[1:42:38] not one of them
[1:42:40] what about your battle
[1:42:44] now i'm talking to you

[1:43:19] the devil's wishing i had to preach the
[1:43:21] christmas message

[1:43:30] when the enemy shall come in like a
[1:43:32] flood
[1:43:33] the spirit of god
[1:43:36] shall lift up a standard
[1:43:38] against him
[1:43:40] god
[1:43:41] always has a response
[1:43:46] and he's always on time
[1:43:49] [Applause]

[1:44:28] he was wounded for my transgressions
[1:44:31] he was bruised for my iniquities the
[1:44:34] chastisement stripes was upon him and
[1:44:36] with his stripes
[1:44:43] we
[1:44:44] are
[1:44:45] healed
[1:44:48] so we refuse to retreat
[1:44:51] with that kind of news on our side we
[1:44:54] refuse to retreat

[1:46:31] are flying
[1:46:33] and the battle is on
[1:46:35] that's when you've got to put action to

[1:46:43] just arm you for a few minutes
[1:46:47] in second corinthians chapter three
[1:46:50] paul says it like this
[1:46:52] not that we are sufficient of ourselves
[1:46:55] to think anything of ourselves
[1:46:58] but our sufficiency
[1:47:01] is of god
[1:47:06] 12 and verse 9 says
[1:47:09] and he said unto me my grace is
[1:47:11] sufficient for thee
[1:47:13] for my strength is made perfect in
[1:47:14] weakness
[1:47:16] most gladly therefore will i rather
[1:47:18] glory in mind infirmities that the power
[1:47:20] of christ may rest upon me
[1:47:23] you ready
[1:47:25] isaiah 40 and verse 29 he giveth power
[1:47:28] to the faint
[1:47:30] and to them that have no might he
[1:47:32] increases strength
[1:47:34] even the you shall faint and to be weary
[1:47:37] and the young men shall utterly fall but
[1:47:40] they that wait upon the lord shall renew
[1:47:43] their strength they shall mount upon
[1:47:45] wings as an eagle
[1:47:47] they shall run and not be weary they
[1:47:50] shall walk and not faint
[1:47:53] [Applause]
[1:47:56] first corinthians 15 and verse 58
[1:47:59] he says therefore my beloved brethren be
[1:48:01] you steadfast
[1:48:03] unmovable
[1:48:06] always abound in the work of the lord
[1:48:09] for as much as you know that your labor
[1:48:11] is not in vain in the lord
[1:48:14] i want to remind you tonight that we
[1:48:16] serve a living god
[1:48:19] we serve an infinite god
