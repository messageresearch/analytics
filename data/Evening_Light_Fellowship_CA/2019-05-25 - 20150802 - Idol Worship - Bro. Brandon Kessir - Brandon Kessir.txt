word have a response to the moving of your spirit Lord because father it's not good enough that your word goes forth it needs to find ground to receive it Lord and to bring forth father tonight we just asked and as your word goes forth that our hearts crys be it unto me Lord and Lord that we receive it lord whatever significance it has to the individual tonight lord I pray that your spirit would go to every life tonight Lord put your finger right on their lives Lord Jesus put your finger on my life Lord father if there's anything in us Lord that needs to change that Lord that needs to be put aside then father we just asked Lord and as uncomfortable as it may make us Lord as as much as we might squirm Lord when you do that but father it's so necessary and we just pray tonight Lord them whatever way that the word finds root in our lives may it be welcomed Lord and may we say be it unto me according to your word Lord father we just commit every part of the service into your hands and we just ask that you would come and speak Lord and you would have your perfect way though I let not a single bit of our flesh get in the way Lord but may we just be able to really give and freely receive tonight or we pray in Jesus and so the singing will do if we turn our Bibles to Exodus chapter 20 take a little subject on idol worship tonight hopefully nobody had any actual graven images that they said a little prayer to on before they set out this evening that would be a little strange we would say that would be pretty weird you know there's a lot of people that call itself Christians that do have those kinds of things but but I trust when we look at the Word of God tonight we find that it's more than having you know a little wooden Idol a little stone Idol that we pray to that but we can have idols of many different things and in the world that we live in is just giving you every opportunity to have an idol you know you don't have to work very hard to have one they'll you know the world will furnish you with any kind of ATO you're willing to accept and you know the devil doesn't care what it looks like you know what what that object of your attention is as long as it's not on God so we want to make sure that we don't have any of those things in our lives tonight and by God's grace recognize what it takes to to please him Exodus chapter 20 and verse 1 it says and God speak all these words saying I am THE LORD thy God which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt out of the house of bondage thou shall have no other gods before me thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the father's upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me and showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep my Commandments you may be seated it's a real honor and privilege to be with you again tonight may the Lord bless you really nice time with the brothers have fishing this morning to reel in the first Cod that I have ever had so that's seeing God in that in a different form a creation just it was a real nice time and then we got nice and wet so that was real nice as well good to be refreshed you know salt water treatment was just great so just really enjoy the fellowship that we had today you know this scripture of course is is the first part of the ten commandments that Moses delivered to the children of Israel very familiar to us and and you know we should should be aware of them and and understand them and right here in the second verse God shows us that he's exercising his right over his chosen people and he tells them he's the one that delivered them from bondage he's the one that brought them out of Egypt he's their Lord and their God and all the following Commandments and laws is how he wants to be worshipped you know in the world that we live this is probably the hardest part to accept of all God's Word is that God is our Lord you know that so many people enjoy having God as you know a part of their life of God as you know a satisfying part of them a comfort to them strength to them you know encouragement in all of those things but most people don't really want to put themselves in a place where God is their Lord because if if they're under that lordship then you know their duty their lives is to give honor and praise to that lordship you know and so to really make God our Lord is is more than just to sing worship and praise you know sometimes people think that you know their their great responsibility to God is raising their hands in church while they're singing or you know is is you know giving God credit for the things in their lives but true lordship is that you never really your your service to the Lord doesn't end when you walk out the door on Sunday morning you know it doesn't end you know when when you finish your prayer before your food it doesn't doesn't end you know when you stake a little bit of time for devotion that the service to the Lord is all the time because he's our Lord all the time you know and so that's God's right because he's created all things he's made all things I took a service at home God's rights you know so often we talk about people's rights but God has rights and he has rights because he made everything without God the scripture tells us that he made everything that was made was made by him and so you know he has the right to say how he wants that creation to work you know and if you were an author and you sat down and wrote a book you know it's up to you as the author to decide what happens to the character you could you could kill off you know someone that the reader loves you know you can kill off you know your favorite character just why did you do that how he's just not variable doesn't matter I'm the author I could choose to do whatever I wanted those characters cuz I created them you know and and you know people get all offended sometimes you know what an author does this or does that and you know in a different thing but it's there right as the creator of that to say what happens to it you know and and you know if you were do you know make a movie or something like that you would have the right to do whatever you want with it you know people might not like it people might not pay to go see it but you'd have a right to make it however you want because you're the creator well God God has that same right you know he's created everything that was made and so he has the right to say how it should run he has the right to tell us how we should live he has the right to tell us how he wants to be worshipped he has the right to do all of those things and if we recognize that then we realize it's only it's only a small thing to actually give our lives back to him because he's given it all to us you know that but that's the hardest thing for people to accept you know they don't mind having God as a guiding light they don't mind having God as you know someone that will strengthen them encourage them but to be able to put their themselves in subjection to the Word of God is the hardest thing for people to do you know because people don't want to surrender control in their lives and people are people believe erroneously that that they have control over their you know people believe that well if I do you know the things that I you know I want to do I will accomplish my goal but you realize that you really don't have any control over that because you don't have any control over if you get sick you don't have any control over what happens to you when you walk out the door tonight and what's happening to everybody else on the road you don't you don't know any of those things and you don't have control over any of them and if God would remove his hand a blessing on up of our lives and allow the devil to have his way you know our life could end right this moment the breath that you just took could be your last breath if God would if God would permit that to be the case and so when we recognize that and we realize okay my idea of control my idea of having my way doesn't really exist you know there is no such thing as having your way you know really you say well no I do I can choose to live my life the way I want yeah you can choose to live your life one of two ways either serving God or following the influence of the devil because we know there's only really two powers in the world God's power and the devil's power so to refuse to subject ourselves to God isn't choosing our own way it's actually choosing to follow and subject ourselves to the devil's Kingdom instead you know when you think about it that way oh that's really the choice I'm making yeah that's really the choice we're making when we say you know what I'm not willing to follow that part of the Word of God and what we're really doing is embracing the devil's Kingdom you know it's really just another way of saying I want it my way is to really just say you know we're going to continue to live in our fallen sinful condition and refuse to subject ourselves to God it you know it's it's incredible how many companies tap into that desire to control your own life you know you know the Burger King have it your way you know just you know people appeal to that and it's so exciting to think that I can have it my way you know my life you know what the air whatever I want to make in my life I can have that you know because it sounds powerful and sounds very self satisfying but really we can't have it our way you know there there's powers beyond our control and in one way or the other gonna serve something so if you if you have it that choice you know and you recognize all that God's done giving us life and and the blessings he's given us and the position opportunity that we have and all of those things would you choose would you choose to subject yourself to the Lord or would you choose to accept yourself through the devil who's brought all the sickness and sin and strife and all of these things into our lives no I know where I'm gonna put my confidence and my services to the Lord Jesus Christ amen so you know what when we when we think of that you know the Lord our God must be lord over our lives he must have the final authority his word must be the last word in all parts of our lives and you know to me it's easier to understand an atheist who doesn't believe in God you know rejecting parts of the word or all of the word and living a life according to their own will because at least they're being true to their confession they're saying you know I don't believe in God I don't believe there's a god that exists and so I'm just gonna live my life however I see fit because I'm not acknowledging that there's anything else that I should submit you there's that there's anything else any other reason to do differently but you know what's hard to understand is people who call themselves Christians but don't follow the Word of God because a Christian who doesn't follow the Word of God is saying I believe in God and I believe that this is his word and I believe that the things in there are true but I'm still not going to subject myself to it you know that's the part that's hard to understand because surely they realize the consequences in it and the effect of doing that you know people have decided you know what part of the scripture they'll live by and which part they won't that's the part that's hard to understand because they know it's a book of two laws you know the book of Deuteronomy book of two laws to accept it was life and blessing and and grace and to reject it was judgment and it was a curse and so you know if we recognize that that's still true today to accept God's provided way brings life eternal life and to those that reject it it brings death it brings a curse today the same as always you know and so you know when people say that but they won't let god be lord over their lives all it is is just a self-deception it's just you know thinking that you know they're doing something that pleases God at the same time God looks at their lives and is very displeased with it you know that that's a deception indeed and and I trust that we would look at our lives tonight and not not be deceived and not be foolhardy enough to think that God will just ignore the parts of our lives that you know we don't feel like subjecting to you but God won't do that he sees everything in our lives and he's aware of those things so you know what what we see what Israel here is that God gives these Commandments to Israel through Moses and the first part of it there is establishing the rights and order of his kingdom you know we have free will to choose but in order to keep his Commandments and to please him and to receive His mercy we need to follow those Commandments and Jesus said if you love me you'll keep my Commandments you say oh I love Jesus I love Jesus but I don't really want to do that well it shows us how much we would love the Lord you know and I I thought of this you know idea that you know many times the things that we love of God are the things that God does for us you know we love to feel encouraged we love to feel blessed we love to experience all of the great things that God's done for us and so we what we really love is the stuff we don't necessarily love God we love the stuff that God does for us you know and if you think about your life you know and you think about is my experience a true love for the Lord is that a true love for the blessings of the Lord I believe when we think about it if there was no blessing if you didn't come to church and you know and receive just encouragement strength you know if you didn't feel the presence of the Lord you know if you if you went out and you were cursed with sickness and and despair and you know financial ruin and and you know bitterness and all those things could you still love God because God would still have the same right to your love that God would still have the same right to your worship but would you still be willing to give it that that's what shows us do we really love God or do we just love what God's done for us you know because brother Brown says if he sent me to hell I'll still love and that's an incredible thing because what you realize then is that you just love the Creator so much that if if he's made you a vessel of dishonor then you say lord that's what I want I want to be pleasing to you and you know I try to still bring you honor but you know if you send me to hell at the end of that then then you're the righteous judge now I won't curse your name I won't you know I won't you know call you unfair unjust I'll just accept it and say Lord if that's what you want then I'm willing to do that you know if you have a heart like that it shows there's no way you could be a vessel of dishonor because a life that's so willing to love even though it's not based on what you receive that shows us that it's a real hearts cry it's a real attribute of God calling back to the Father no deep responding to the deep as we say you know if you if you look at the commandments that God gave to the children of Israel there's a lot of them if you start flipping through you know 10 commandments is just the short form you start looking through Exodus and Leviticus and numbers in Deuteronomy there's just so many things that the children of Israel had to keep and and you know hundreds of different Commandments hundreds of different rules and regulations and and you know I'm sure that as they started to you know as Moses would continue to lay out the word okay this is the way this is going to work just the way sacrifice is going to work this is the way you know marriage is gonna work this is a way that they must be like wow this is gonna be really hard to follow there's so many things I got to be careful of so many things I got to offer sacrifices for so many things you know I've got to do to earn God's favor and you know no doubt as Christians sometimes we feel the same way you know young people growing up especially might think like oh man there's so many rules mom and dad won't let me do this they won't let me do that you know I'm I have to do you know I have to keep this way I have to wear these clothes I have to you know I'm not allowed to go here I'm not allowed to go there and it can seem like a lot of rules and regulations but Jesus actually gives us you know one major shortcut for keeping the laws of God and and it says in Matthew 22 verse 37 it says jesus said unto Him thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and Great Commandment how do we serve God in a way that pleases him simply allow him to be Lord of all your life and in everything you do put him first you know the ten commandments and all the commandments really are extensions of this one principle and also the second principle which Jesus said second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets you know so if you could say what does it take to please the Lord it takes two things love the Lord with all your heart and soul in mind and love your neighbor as yourself no that's the simple form of what it takes to please the Lord that's what what God's asked us to do is simply just those two things you take the Ten Commandments and you divide them up and into those two categories you find that those two things satisfy all of the commandments you know if you look at you know the first five Commandments and you find you know doesn't have no other gods before me no graven images you know all of those things remember the Sabbath and all of those are a reflection of that first commandment which is love the Lord God with all your heart and soul in mind you know if you do those things you'll have no other gods before it if you do those things you you know you won't have you know you won't have any graven images you won't have anything that gets first place over the Lord you know he'll he'll be the one that's your light and your and your salvation all the time because you put them first with all your heart and soul in mind you know then you turn and you look at all the other commandments you know do not kill don't steal don't commit adultery don't bear false witness all of those things well if you keep that second part that you love your neighbor as yourself well you won't do any of those things you know we don't like to experience those things happening to us and so we wouldn't do them you know to others we wouldn't we wouldn't steal we wouldn't kill we wouldn't lie we wouldn't you know covet we wouldn't do any of those things because what would be most important to us is that we love others the same way we would love ourselves so really that's the shortcut to all of those things is just simply to follow these two Commandments so it's easy right if there's only two Commandments it should be so simple to keep them except that Israel could never keep them they can never keep them there's only there's really only two things that they had to be mindful of all at all time and they could never do it you know and the truth is today we could never do it in our strength in our ability you know if even if every day we just ran every single thought through the same two Commandments said am I really am I doing that am i doing that am i doing that we wouldn't be able to do it because we have a fallen nature that's suffered you know there's a way about us no matter how much we try to be unselfish we're still selfish in our own selfishness and I think service at home and I called it unselfish selfishness you know is that you know no matter what we do even when we're being good to other people a lot of times they're still selfishness in that it makes us feel good you know we get a sense of gratification out of it with you know it makes us feel like oh we're doing right you know we're we're pleasing God and the benefit that we get out of that is what motivates us to do something for others a lot of times but because no matter what we're selfish people you know and that's the that's the fallen condition of man is really to be selfish you know in everything that we do and so we find that in order to ever have a chance of keeping these two Commandments there really has to be a nature change in us and you know we probably get tired at times especially if you haven't had a new birth of hearing that you need a new birth because you know it just sounds like won't you get off of that same topic it's just over and over again new birth new birth new birth but Jesus said unless you are born again you can't even see the kingdom of God so you know as much as you would want to have any you know Oh tell me something else okay you know get off of this new birth or there can we move on from the Holy Spirit no we never can because that's the thing that actually gives us the ability to keep these Commandments that God's given us you know without that without a without a new birth experience without a nature change without God's own life in us he's the only one that can keep his word and so the only chance we have of keeping his word is if our own lives are living his life so you know as much as as much as we make the gospel complicated with rules and things like that the real thing is get to God you know getting to Christ and when you get into Christ either you know the brother branham lays out for us that how our lives match the you know three courts or the three different places in the temple or tabernacle you know and we would say once we have the holy go that you know as brother tells us we have full access to the holiest of Holies at all times but we still have a choice to live in the outer court you know we still have a choice to not enter into that presence you know even once you have the Holy Ghost people think that oh you know there will never be another challenge and never be another difficult because I got the Holy Ghost now but you still have a choice to live in your flesh you still have a choice to live by your own thinking you know to just kind of put aside God's leadership and still have your own way and so as we said before you don't really have your own way so you know we have a choice still to push God away and follow the way of the world or follow the influence of evil so we want to make sure that our lives not only are born again but that we recognize hey I'm born again that still means I've got to enter in I've still got to subject myself daily in order that you know I might still find the will of God you know we look at Jesus life and brother BAM tells us in some places didn't have to pray like we have to pray because he wasn't you know asking for repentance he wasn't you know it wasn't his sin that was getting in the way of his contact with God but yet we find so many places in the scripture where it says that jesus prayed so he didn't need to pray the way we have to pray cuz he was sinless but at the same time he prayed all the time he prayed all the time because he wanted to make sure that his will and God's will were completely lined up you know that that he wasn't doing anything without the leadership of the Lord and so you know sometimes when we get spiritually you know we've progressed in the Lord we think that okay well that means now that I'm just you know super power and off I go doing things however I want because God will bless it God will leave me but no it takes a subjection of our will all the time so that God's will can be brought forth so when we look at Israel you know we think about them keeping these Commandments you know it's shocking to me the things that is real struggled with when you think about all that God did for them you know it's shocking because you know what what do people say when they have trouble serving the Lord as well well if only God was more real in my life if only you know only God would show me and speak to me you know give me some sign then I would know us from the Lord well Israel is the living proof of that that when God gives them supernatural signs old they still can't line up with it so the problem isn't that we don't have enough supernatural leadership the problem is that we can't subject ourselves to that leadership and so you know we look at Israel and if you start to think really about what what God did for them and all the things that he brought them through there should never have been a doubt in their minds that God would continue to lead them you think about the mighty supernatural things that happened while they were in Egypt and you know even before that you look at the life of Abraham and you look at the life of you know of him when God called him out and all of those things you know we see that in their lives Abraham had come from a life of idol worship Abraham had had come from a place where that was his family history you know they were Idol worshipers and and so Abraham was raised with graven images that he would pray to and in all of those things but when God speaks to Abraham it changes him and and there's a response that takes place he's heard from God directly you know we'd say oh wouldn't we all love to hear from God directly what do we all love to hear you know an audible voice or you know how have a physical manifestation of God right before you in your room you know you're trying to decide what do I need to do today what where do I look for a job where do I move toward it you know what church should I go to you know in God's right there in the flesh standing before you telling you where to go or what to do you know we'd be really excited about that and that's what happened to Abraham you know is that he came to this you know he heard the voice of God directly and it told him to go into the land that was separated from his family separated from his upbringing and all of those things and and Abraham does that he has a direct relationship with God you know a friend of God even the scripture calls him and so we see Abraham put aside the idols he put aside those things and we never find again that Israel's worshipping idols up until the time they come out of Egypt you know you can look through the scripture and it never says that Abraham goes to pray to his graven image it doesn't say that you know that Isaac had graven images it doesn't say that Jacob had them you know the only time that you really find idols from that time is that you find them when when Rachel took Laban idols when they left Layton's house and they they went back to Canaan you find that Rachel took all of laymen's idols but doesn't really tell us what her intention was in doing that and we never find anywhere that that they worship them or you know counted on them or any of those things so really from the time that God called Abraham until the time that Moses comes on the scene Israel's never been a group of idol-worshipping people they've always put their trust in Jehovah they've always had a special relationship and I remember seeing the Abraham movie years ago and you know God's calling Abraham and Abraham goes and he's meeting these different people in different lands you know and they're like oh you know let's you know let's go worship and he's like oh I can worship right here I just let me build a an altar to my god and they're there so stumbled by the idea that he doesn't need an image to direct his attention to he just you know serves the the one true God that reigns over his life and and so that's they that's the type of worship that Israel has you know they've never had a graven image they've never had an idol that they've directed their attention to and no doubt they've seen a lot of people worshipping idols in those years you know they've seen the way that the different Canaan Canaanite tribes would worship and they all had idols they they saw when they went to Egypt that the Egyptians had idols and you know temples to this God and Pharaoh himself is God and all of these different things that they had before them they had the opportunity to adopt idol worship but the scripture never tells us that they were worshipping idols yeah we're just worshiping Jehovah you know when they got into trouble they cried out for Jehovah you know it didn't cry out for bail or any of those other types of God but they were worshiping God they were worshiping God without an image so when you think about that and then you think about all of the things that that invisible God was able to do for them that no Idol had ever done you know no Idol that Egypt had ever done the mighty works that their God had done no no Idol of any other country had ever done the works that their God had done and they just see supernatural sign after supernatural sign bringing them out of Egypt and you know through the Red Sea no Idol had ever done that you know manna in the wilderness no no Idol had ever done that water from The Rock know i doäôt ever done that it's just super natural after supernatural for supernatural and they come to Mount Sinai and God wants to speak to them directly and he gives them an opportunity to hear from from him directly and so he they come to this place and and of course they prepare themselves and sanctify themselves and get ready and all of those things and you would think here that all this is going to be a real turning point for his rayul this is going to be an incredible thing that as a whole nation they're going to be ruled directly by God and it is a turning point for them but it's in the wrong direction you know because when they come to Mount Sinai and God's voice speaks out to them and makes them afraid makes them fearful and instead of subjecting themselves to that in fear and humility they said let let God speak through Moses instead and what they actually did is turn down God's direct leadership and put it on to somebody else and when they did that Israel became an utter worshiping country right after that you know I still had Jehovah but they were always turning to idols when they turned down that direct walk with God you know and that that's a warning to us as Christians because God once again wants to have a direct relationship with us but when we push that off onto somebody else it causes us to make substitute it causes us to substitute other things in God's place and the people who should be you know constantly in a connection at a direct relationship with God can become an auto worshiping people you know right at this time when they when they turn down God speaking directly to them of course God says okay Moses will speak for you and that'll be the pattern that I use to speak to my people from here on in and you know so they go on that way and and of course God gives them the Ten Commandments right on that time as well so they've heard don't make any graven images well that should be the easiest that should be the absolute easiest commandment for them to follow because they have no history for hundreds of years they've lived and they've never made any idols they've you know that should be the simplest thing for them to keep because it's it's not part of their culture it's not part of their life they've never depended on it it never depended on it when they were in Egypt you know in bondage they weren't turned into idols then but you know so this should be the simplest commandment that should be what's the next one what's what's the hard one you know that's an easy one but we find that the very first commandment that they broke was they made a graven image the very first commandment they broke this should have been the easiest one to keep and it was the first one that they broke you know and so it's a warning to us as Christians if we push off God and we we accept a secondhand experience with God whether that person's your spouse pastor preacher parent respected person whatever it is you know will will cause us to create substitutions in our lives that will actually put us outside of God's will will actually put us in a condition where we're we're idol worshipers before the Lord you know as soon as we stop experiencing Christ first hand and settle for someone else's experience we're finding a physical substitute for God you know Israel had such a mighty display of God's power and might but the first commandment broken like I said was to adopt an idol you know we find that in exodus 32 it says and when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down under the mount the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron and said unto Him up make us gods which shall go before us for us for this Moses the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt we want not what has become of him and Aaron said unto them break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons of your daughter's spirits never die again and bring them unto me and all the people break off the golden earrings which were in their ears and brought them unto Aaron and he received them at their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool after he had made it a molten calf and they said these be thy God's o Israel which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt what a slap in God's face you know a God that had done things that no Idol had ever done you know no Idol could ever have done and in the very first opportunity of they had have to reject him they put a calf in this place it's it's not even made in anything in the image of anything godly it's you know in the image of a calf you know of a dummy animal is what they made it in and so you know at least maybe they could have fashioned it in the shape of a pillar of fire would have sounded more spiritual or shaping in a cloud or shaping in you know something that represented you know something great and mighty a shape it as a star as a planet or what something but they shape it as a cow you know something that it's just so lowly and they say these be your gods Israel it this is where to put your confidence this is where to put your focus you know it's almost astonishing to the natural mind how they could how they could change so abruptly I believe to the spiritual mind we catch it because to have rejected that direct relationship with God and chosen a man to stand in the place of God their trust was on the physical their trust had been put on the physical thing and no longer could they simply walk by faith and you know we actually see that all the way to the time of jesus jesus' as a man he's constantly disappointed by the lack of faith in Israel every time he sees it he says you know do you still not understand you still not trust you you know show us the Palio suffice it would you know you've seen me you've seen the father he he's trying to direct their attention you know you you've got you should have faith don't you know believe if you can't believe me believe the works you know how faith in it but no they're always looking for something else look give me a little more give me a little more and yet you know a Gentile comes in you know who's got a sick servant at home and he says just speak the word she said I can come to your house and lay hands oh no no I don't either just speak the word you know why because he could accept God by faith and the Jews required something physical because they had pushed the side that walk by faith that pattern continues to repeat itself over and over again throughout the scripture Israel always chose a physical representation over a true relationship with God you know we're seeing that right now all throughout the world the world rejects God continually but doesn't go on without idols the world raises up idols all the time because there's something in us to worship the brother man tells us that there's something in human beings to worship and we will worship something with our lives and so we see that and the world doesn't even doesn't even play it coy or you know try to be deceitful about it they say no let's let's make a new TV show it's called American Idol we're gonna tell you right now that we're putting up idols before you and you know you're not going to be alarmed by this you're not gonna be bothered by this you're gonna tune in by the millions to watch it instead you know we're gonna call these sports stars idols and you're gonna say oh awesome let me buy his jersey and let me let me get a tickets and let me you know get an autograph card and let me do all these things you know and they're telling you we're making idols so in case you're wondering we're sewing idols over here you know you know we're gonna raise up some Hollywood stars we're gonna raise up some sports stars we're gonna raise up this before we do I will wave and I don't anybody you know I don't okay there's I got one for you what kind would you like what kind would you like you know you you want to auto a beauty oh well here's some great examples for you I've got a full catalog of selection uh oh you idolize strengthen and and concrete oh my I've got such idols over here you know whatever type of Auto you want the world's gonna display and they're not afraid to say that you know they're blaspheming but they don't even realize it doesn't even bother they're you know at home one of the most grieving things that I heard was we you know of course the winners just got the you know touted draft pick in the NFL Draft and and I saw a little interview with a guy who had brought his child to watch a practice or something about it and you know he said he said he had been calling him Conor makgeoli like that than most Christians would talk about their faith but why because he was proud he was proud to have an idol he was proud to you know to to worship fully in and completely and put all of his confidence in that you know but completely completely anti daughter you know and yet so many people are doing the same thing but you know maybe they're not as blatant in their in their worship but but they've put a substitute in that's their life that's their leadership you know that's that's what people are doing constantly with the clothes they wear and the haircut that they have and and all of these things is patterning themselves after idols that the world gives them substitutes for the for the lure you know so Israel the very first thing they do is turn to idol worship you know Paul brings that out in in the book of Romans and he says wherefore God gave them up to uncleanness through their lust through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator who is blessed forever so that's really the problem is that God set out a pattern in the very beginning that he's to be the Lord he's to be the one you know true object of our worship and yet any other gods before him breaks that commandment it breaks that type in our lives and it causes those substitutes to come forth in abundance now causes those things to come forth in abundance and anything else other than God is worshiping the creature the creation more than the Creator you know the scripture tells us that that the creation could never have more glory than the Creator because the creation is a product of the creator you know there's nothing you know the greatest human being is still absolutely pitiful compared to God you know the the greatest accomplishment man is still the you know the most minor and insignificant detail compared to God but that's not how it gets lifted up in this world you know so idol worship is a symptom of people that have refused to move on with God or refuse to accept God's will in their life we refuse to respond to the call of God you will worship something you know and I would say check your experience and check your life and I pray the Holy Spirit just speak to each one of us individually tonight that you know what really is the most important thing to you in your life right now is it family friends career education money popularity all of these things is that you know selfish nation what's the most important thing to you in your life because if it's anything than the Lord Jesus Christ there's an idol there might just be a little Idol but it's Dillon Otto might be a great big Idol but it's an idol and so we want to put those things await and I recognize them and put them away you know when Israel would sin by grumbling and complaining the Lord would send trouble their way as a way to judge their sin but also to try to bring them back to recognizing where their focus should be and one example that we find is when the Lord sends a fiery serpents among the people verse 6 of chapter 21 of numbers it says and the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of Israel died therefore the people came to Moses and said we have sinned for we have spoken against the Lord and against thee pray unto the Lord that he take away the Serpent's from us and Moses prayed for the people and the Lord said unto Moses make the a fiery Serpent and set it up on a pole and it shall come to pass that every one that is bitten when he looketh upon it shall live and Moses made a serpent of brass and put it upon a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld the serpent of breath he lived you know that's extraordinary that in the time that Israel is in a condition where they need God God actually gives them an image to look to it seems kind of strange in a way but God recognizes that Israel has placed their trust in the physical God realizes that Israel won't simply take him out his word he has to give them something tangible something physical to put their trust in and so he gives Moses a commandment to make this snake out of brass and of course brother Brown shows us that it symbolizes their sin judged and forgiven and if they'll look on the brass serpent they'll live look and live you know and God the incredible thing about God to me is that God will reach out to meet you at your level of faith he certainly doesn't need to he's already given his word he's already promised all of the things that we have nita but yet God will reach out to us at our level of faith you know of course the highest form of faith is simply to take God at His Word and receive his promises without anything up God said he's a healer further Browne I was listening to messages recently and brother branham says you know if you want a God to heal you he couldn't even do it right now because he's already done it he's he's already done it to the point where if you were to ask him right now he can't do anything more for you than what he's already done he's already healed you he's already saved you is already giving you need of everything that you have giving you everything you have need a brother and so you know there is nothing more that God needs to equip you with he's already done it but we still can't receive that simply by the word that's given a lot of time and so God reaches out to us to try to meet us at our level of faith you know and that's brother branham's ministry was like that first pole was there to help people have something tangible that would raise the level of their faith where they would you know reach out it and he would grab their hand and they would see that you know their disease reflected in the pattern of the bumps on his hand why it gave them something tangible to look at and when you know when he had prayed and when the disease was done they might not have felt it in their bodies but they looked at that hand and if it was fine if it wasn't if it was whole and if it was normal they had something to put their trust in that you know that God had healed them of their disease and so you know God reaches out to lift up people's level of faith by giving them something physical to depend upon but that's not the highest form of faith the highest form of faith is simply to take honor his work he said he healed me so god I'm accepting that healing for myself right now and I'm claiming it in Jesus name and then I'm just gonna keep walking and and whenever it takes place in me then it's gonna take place in me because your word says it's true well we have that kind of confidence we have that kind of faith that's the highest level of faith but God still reaches out to help us get to that level by boosting our faith giving us faith boosters but notice God gives Israel that so that they have a way of of being saved from these this condition of the serpent but they take that that very same image of deliverance and they turn it into an idol you know God's giving it to them to help their faith be lifted up to receive his word but they turn even that image of his word of his you know it's an image that God himself provided and they turn and they actually make that into an auto and the Bible is very clear on that second Kings chapter 18 it says now came to pass in the third year of Hoshea a son of Allah king of Israel that Hezekiah the son of Ahaz king of Judah began to reign twenty and five years old was he when he began to reign and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem his you know his mother's name it talks about he says and he did that which was right in in the side of the Lord according to all that David his father did he removed the high places and break the images and cut down the groves it's all wonderful things and break in pieces the brazen serpent that Moses had made for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it think about this this is this is a couple hundred years after maybe three or four hundred years after God had given this image that was for a very specific time and a very specific circumstance that God gave them deliverance but they took that they took that image and they just kept on worshiping it there was no fiery serpents biting them anymore there was no there was no need of it any more but they just kept it as a tradition you know and so you know every time you know maybe they're coming to church or coming and coming to the synagogue or temple or and and you know they would have something they take a little time to you know offer some incense to the brass serpent and you know take a little time say a little prayer to the brass serpent then no it's just mind-boggling that they would do that but they took something that God provided to give them deliverance and turn that into an idol so amazing thing that you could take what God's giving you and make an idol of it that would take your attention off God but that's exactly what they did Satan loves to take the sacred things that God's given to help his people and turn those thing into into a weapon against God's elect you know the brass serpent gate was given by God to raise their faith and instead it became an idol that was an obstacle to their free you know bring that into the New Testament and we find the same pattern over and over again the same problem with humanity God gives gifts to raise the faith of his people and people turn those gifts into idols brother Branham says in the message in portable sin he said and you all get the baptism of the Holy Spirit let's be one big happy family then don't come in saying well I got the Holy Ghost glory to god I'm gonna have gifts now just let the gifts alone they'll take care of their self see God when he's when he sees he wants to use you for something he'll tell you what to do and go do it don't seek gifts seek the giver come in and receive the Holy Spirit you know bo brown points to the same kind of auto worship God gives many gifts to the church for the edifying of the body of Christ no but people see the gifts and it catches their attention and they what they start craving is the gift well if that person can speak in tongues can I speak in tongues you know it was given as a gift to edify the body not given us something to distract us from serving the Lord you know when we saw the way that tongues were operating and brother Browns time or even prophecies we were operating in brother branham's time you know it became to such a place it was just a distraction from the service you know God would come forth and speak to them you know and then somebody would get up and you know all the attention would turn to them you know to confirm what brother Brown was saying you know brother I didn't need any confirmation that what he was saying was true but they got so focused on the gifts that even when the word of God is coming directly to them even when you know it's being sought it's being full with discernment it's being followed with you know obvious demonstration you know healings and things taking place somebody still has to get up and tell them but that was the Lord speaking to you today why because it was their object of their worship was the gifts you see it even in the way that people would approach the services you know people would come to service and brother Brown announces taxing you know people would just roll their eyes and cross their arms and you know go to sleep you know wake me when to wake me when he closes and then we'll you know then we'll get to the good stuff you know ignoring all the preaching of the word ignoring what God's actually wanted to speak to them and just hanging on oh man oh man I saw a blind kid in the service today oh it could be a good one oh think of this story I'll have to tell oh my I get so excited you know you'd listen on the tapes many times the service is not that loud the people are not that loud there's not a lot maybe like tonight okay you know the the service is not that loud but then brother BAM calls out to some person and tells them what their situation is and everybody's rejoicing the place this erupts but gods just been telling them very personally what they've needed for the last hour and a half but when he mentions where somebody lives oh man everybody just goes crazy everybody just rejoices oh my oh wow that was so incredible and completely missing what God was trying to say to that because they've made an idol of the gifts you know people see the gifts it catches their attention and what they start craving that's what they're there for that's what you know that's what that's why they show up to church for is is the gifts you know you look around churches when we had the pleasure of going to a Ukrainian Orthodox Church to a funeral and and then is it an eye-opening experience to go in and see the way that some churches you know run thing idols everywhere you know just blatant idolatry everywhere you know right in the in the sanctuary you're looking around images to these Saints and images to this and images to that and you know there's pictures of you know this Saint and what they've done and you know all of these different things and and then you see the actual service and you know there's they carry around a cross on a golden cross on a stick every time they go near the dot cross they're gonna stop and give it you know bow to it and stop and make you know it's just an idol the cross of Jesus Christ is so important to us it's it's such a critical part of God's plan of redemption but in that way it's just an idol it's it's a stench to got it you know you'd be like you know it would be the way that you know your your wife or your husband you know who loves you dearly you know and you know you come home and and and they're just so excited to see you and instead of you know they're sitting there understand they're with their open arms ready to give you a hug and kiss and you walk by them and you pick up their picture off the wall just put that back on the shelf there just walk right on by them you know that's how ridiculous it is to take an image of God and put all our attention to all Maya's not wonderful oh my isn't that great and God Himself I'm the one in the picture you know I'm the one that you know I'm the one that gave you all these things and you just walked right on by that's what idol worship does and and what a crazy thing but that's really that's what people are doing when they substitute and you know we were there you know and people that you know didn't look like Christians by their dress by their you know makeup and their earrings and all of those things you know they would come at the end of the service to give him an opportunity and the priest stood there with the little Golden Cross and it was all shined up in Polish and really nice and gleaming you know just like the cross of Calvary of course was just a beautiful setting and everything just lovely and perfect and sweet and they would comment and all of these people would just take time you know lean in there and give a big kiss to that cross and then the next person would come lean in and give a kiss to that cross and oh what God looks at how much just break his heart to see people who claim to serve Him just you know kissing that picture off the mantle instead of instead of himself you know what what a thing what a horrible thing I would have you know everybody who is part of that church probably thought it was a great honor to bow and kiss that cross but they're actually giving their worship to an idol what I'm what a thing you know they're living contrary to the Word of God but show honor so they think they're pleasing God but at the same time they're worshipping idols but people did the same thing in brother Browns meetings like I said you know they they would oh they would you know they would sure brag him up and everything else but the things they were bragging him up for wasn't the reason that God sent him in the first place God sent him to be a messenger and they're like gears with this message and a crumble that up and and throw it aside but but did you see the packaging that came in Wow wasn't that incredible oh man he was addressed to me I was not exciting my name on it you know I sent you a letter and you just rejoiced it had your name on it but you but you never looked at the contents of the message you it seem like such a shame but that's exactly what they were doing to brother branham denying the Lord Jesus Christ and worshiping idols of gifts of man you know people can sing with all their might praise God through song service but if you can't receive the word your singing is in vain you can worship the music without worshiping God that's an incredible thing that stumbles people because you think about what am i singing I'm saying oh how I love Jesus oh how I love Jesus you know how could you do that and not love Jesus well you can do that because you love that Monsieur work you love to to you know hear the instrument you love to hear the voices blend together you love all that you love the atmosphere they don't love God even though those words are coming out of your mouth what an incredible thing you can worship the traditions of church without worshiping God now I love to just get all dressed up and get all hair fixed in place everything else in just common you know it's a tradition and people have such confidence in it it's such strength and all children you better be just right in church better be just great but you know no care at all for the word being preached it's idol worship right amongst us again jesus said in matthew 15 he's quoting isaiah says the people this people draw nigh unto me with their mouth and honoureth me with their lips but their heart is far from me in vain do they worship Me teaching for doctrines the commandments of man this is incredible thing even our sermons can teach things that become idols in people's life where they worship the doctrine more than God some things are so important to people they won't have any fellowship with you unless you believe in a certain way or there and yet yet their own heart is far from God it's it's hardened to God it's become cool it's become lukewarm how is that possible but it is because the devil will give you any opportunity at all to make a little idol that's more important than God himself you know any opportunity at all just to twist your focus so your focus changes you know what's important that what's important is paying my tithes and coming to church that is important but the most important thing is meeting the God that put all those things in place if you come here tonight and all you accomplish with you you spent a couple hours your time and you know you're you you did your part you showed up everybody saw you on the video everybody you know check your name off on the list yep mother was faithful here again night sister was here again tonight praise the Lord you know it and that's it that's the extent and we didn't meet Jesus Christ tonight then it's all for nothing he says in vain do they worship you know Jesus told that the people that heard the Pharisee he said you can listen to what they say but don't do as they do you know the word is true but don't don't make idols like they have of the word don't don't make their education and their learning to be the thing that's most important actually find the Lord it can be so close to an authentic walk but if the focus and attention of the heart is not on God's Word and not on God's will then it's an idol you know and in the Book of Daniel Nebuchadnezzar the King he proves this concept over and over again because Nebuchadnezzar of course the Babylonians were Auto worshiping people but they come in contact with Jehovah and they come in contact with them in a mighty way over and over again that you know that defies all the idols that they have but you can tell by their heart that instead of receiving that receiving the God that can do that they would rather turn that God into an idol that they can have tangibly with them or see that in Daniel chapter 2 that says here then of course Daniel just interpreted a dream for Nebuchadnezzar and it says then the King Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worship Daniel and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odours unto Him the King answered unto Daniel and said ah the truth it is that your God is a God of gods and a Lord of Kings and a revealer of Secrets seeing now could us reveal us this secret but notice he doesn't worship that God of gods he worships Daniel what a strange thing he acknowledges that Daniels God is the god of God the Lord of Kings but he puts the attention on Daniel he says then the King made Daniel a great man and gave him many great gifts and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon of the chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon then Daniel requested the king he said Shadrach Meshach and Abednego over the Affairs the provinces of the province of Babylon but Daniel sat in the gate of the king Daniel had his special place and it says and then in chapter 3 verse 1 it says Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was threescore cubits 75 feet and and the breadth thereof six cubits and he said it up in the plain of Dura and the province of Babylon then nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes the governors the captains the judges the treasurers the counselors the sheriffs all the rulers of the provinces to come to the dedication of the image which nebuchadnezzar the king had set up what an incredible thing you know if brother Branham picks it up and I'm astonished that more people just in denominations didn't catch this because it you know it follows very sequentially a pattern God does something Nebuchadnezzar responds to that by making an idol by by turning it into idol worship and so further my picks us up in the mark of the beast he says notice when king nebuchadnezzar in the beginning back yonder when the gentile age was issued in let's watch how it come in the way i come in you'll find it goes out the same way we're living at the time when it goes out so it's time to pay attention he says we know that there's a beginning of a time of grace for the gentiles in the ending time is that right now watch when king nebuchadnezzar when daniel was sent down there a smart prophet when all the rest of the jews had kind of humbled down and was bowing to the Babylonians but there was three four men you know three Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and and Daniel who purposed in their heart they'd serve God and when they throwed Shadrach so forth in Daniel had become a great man and before Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar and so forth when he become a great man now watch King Nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold and set it out in the field and said that everybody would have to bow to that image did you ever notice the innocence of it who that image was made of it was Daniel the image of man and he didn't say the spirits of the gods you know he then as they are today you know got three or four of them the spirits of the gods lived in him and they made an image to Daniel and he said all that won't make bow to that image will be throw it in the fiery furnace you noticed Daniels off the scene at this time get what I mean do we get what he means and ever who had not bowed to that image should be cut to pieces or throw it in the lion's den or burnt in the fiery furnace or something a punishment that's the way the Gentile dispensation begin with a pagan form of religious worship with a persecution to make them bow to it and the Bible predicts it will end the same way a holy man Jesus Christ an image to worship Him and so forth you know when you read the book of Daniel it stands out so clear they were idol worshipers and every time that Jehovah does something that no one else in the kingdom can do they praise the God of that person but then they turn and worship the person they turn in worship to create the creation more than the Creator you know Daniel does something supernatural so Nebuchadnezzar makes an idol of gold and the image of Daniel and makes a law that everyone has to bow to that image he keeps rejecting Jehovah even though he keeps saying that their God is greater than any other God you know it seems like such a paradox he said your God is greater than any other guy so let me make you another God there to distract you and focus your attention on something else it's just you know it's amazing but that's the way the devil works you know so after Shadrach Meshach and Abednego come from the furnace they you know he has the same kind of awe of their God but he still doesn't subject his life to that God know the Bible says that after Shadrach Meshach and Abednego go through the fiery furnace you know it says that he made a decree to lift them up in the kingdom and promote them but he doesn't worship the God you know God can you know God just proved to him that making that Idol wasn't pleasing and that God was with his people that God was identified with his people as we thought of identification last night and so he identified himself as the fourth man in the fire with shadrach me check Bendigo and yet the first thing that he does is promote them in the kingdom and lift them up before the people just keeps on idol worship it just runs deep for them right he's rejecting the God but but making an image to that guy you know the very same thing has been done to brother Branham it's gonna go out the same way it came in he said well we're right at the end and people have done the same thing you know a God a work of God that they could not you know doubt they could not put you know they cannot point a fault at it but instead of putting that attention on God and serving God with all their heart they've now made it the focus of their lives his brother Brian the focus of their attention is brother Branham and that's just as wrong as making the idol to Daniel because it takes the worship off of God and puts it on to man you know it was you know son of man but not to be kept on the flesh it was to be kept on Christ God did the mighty works God gave the visions God gave the word brother Branham was simply the messenger for God but the attention is so many its focus on the messenger lift him up lift him up you know Oh for the members above the fivefold ministry birth as this you know but you know I'll just take his word for I'm gonna take a pastor's words I want to take by the band's word for well you're missing God's provided way then because God's Word said that he put pastors and evangelists and prophets and teachers and apostles all in the body why people will serve the image more than the Word of God you know just because the the man was holy doesn't mean that you can't make an idol of it you know people think idols are just of ugly things idols are just a demonic thing no idols can be completely godly things godly things made into an image that's not God himself the same way an object or idea can be made into idle a person even a god-given minister can become an idol you know how we need to examine our lives and see why the focus of our attention really is you know are we just keeping the message are we just claiming a profit or do we truly strive every day because that's the only thing that God really cares about he doesn't care how many times you mentioned his name he doesn't care if your heart's far from him none of those things matter to him he wants to see your life subjective daily to his will Lord what do you want me to do so many times we come to God and we tell him what we want him to do but how many times do we say god I want this but I I know that you might have something totally different in mine and so what I'm really asking Lord is what do you want for me what do you want from my life you know and so many times we pray just our will be done but that's not what that's not what Jesus taught us to pray he said thy will be done and that's that's the key of it right there is not finding other ways to get what we want out of it but Lord what do you want from my life Paul and the Corinthians he says but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ it's not complicated people always want to make it really complicated what is to serve God how complicated is it just to to you know live peaceably and have a good relationship with your spouse it's not that complicated you know do things that they enjoy you know be be selfless you know you know don't be selfish you know and share your time and share your energy and share your attention you know and you'll have a good marriage it's not rocket science but a lot of people don't have it because not willing to subject the selfishness not willing to put aside their own will to allow that that's how simple it is serving God that's why when Paul talks about the relationship of Christ in the church it's it's so mixed together with the marriage of a husband and wife that you you know he has to keeps telling them I'm talking about Christ in the church but then he goes right back talking about the husband and wife you know it just it's so inseparable because it's the exact same thing you know I don't have to you know walk on my hands and knees broken glass down the driveway to please my wife where would you like to go for dinner what what would you like to do you know and just share that time and attention and that's satisfaction you know a lot of times I'm amazed that you know I said are you happy like what you know what do we need to do really hang up a couple pictures you'll be happy with me oh wow all right in a little bit when I'm gonna busy finish reading this article or you know I fish play his game yeah I'll be right there that's our attitude we slipped back into selfishness but but we realize it's just the little things of our attention and time that's what that's what pleases one another so when we spend that little bit of attention in time and that's what pleases God you know God's never gonna be disappointed in us if we're looking for his leadership if we're looking for his will because it's then up to him to show us his will to give us his way but Paul says here for if he that cometh preaches another jesus whom we have not preached or if you receive another spirit which you have not received or another gospel which you mana which you have not accepted you might well bear with him Paul saying it's possible to even make Jesus an idol just by changing the focus of Jesus into an image of Jesus what an incredible thing you could take God and make God into an idol that doesn't give glory to God that you know it sounds like such a paradox but you can do that you know people will take their one experience that they had with the Lord 20 years ago and that's their whole center of their life it's the the whole foundation of their experience everything is because twenty years ago God did something for them in their life you've taken the the works of God and you made that into an idol because there's a living God today that has the wants to have the same relationship that he had with you 20 years ago you know it's not supposed to become a historical thing it's a simple walk just subjecting your will in your life to God's will every day as we look the close here Paul tells us what communion is supposed to be like first Corinthians chapter 11 communion scriptures and he says speaking of Jesus here and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped and saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me excuse me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged you know that's an incredible thing because God gives his word to us and he actually equips us with the tools to check our own life he equips us with his word to take that word and apply to our own lives and say well where am I at lore am i discerning your body am i discerning your body or or am I am I focused on an idol here Lord what the communion is supposed to produce that inward walk that checks ourselves automatically you know if we would judge ourselves what's judging us the spirit that's inside of us that's what's judging us saying Lord is there something in me there's something to me that needs to change and when we do that he gives us the answer and then we move forward that we be not judged what we don't comment to judge we won't stand before the white throne judgment because our lives will have already been judged as the Spirit works in us to make us into God's own likeness the natural communion we take is not different than the spiritual community it's just natural types to spiritually we need the same life that Jesus had you know when I when I personally take communion I try to do that you know I don't just come and say all you know I just want go through the community service but you know I'm chewing that bread and I'm thinking Lord this is representing your word representing you you know I said that you know the Word was God the word is God and so you know Lord am I am i I jesting your word the same way that I'm eating this bread you know is is your word as sweet in my mother's you know is that life to me is that strength to me the same way that there's natural bread is you know this wine you know that burns my throat on the way down I don't know about you I don't really particularly enjoy the the wine and and effect of it I saw heard a lot of people say oh I just love it you know communion every day would be wonderful but but as it's burning down my throat I think Lord is your is your life burning in mind you know is is it actually producing a stimulation you know is it is it putting me on fire is it you know is it lifting me up is it stimulating me or is it just dull these are like drinking water you know is it you know you know some churches they drink grape juice instead of wine you know because it's but you know that it is your is your word is your life grape juice to me Lord or is there some stimulation to it is there some power to change my behavior you know you drink alcohol it changes your behavior you know you might think you're all in control and everything you have enough alcohol you've got no control at all that's that's really what taking in the Spirit of God is is that the control leave and we started to have a different behavior we need to examine ourselves regularly that was the commandment at communion time while communion supposed to happen every day so every day there's an examining there's an examining irregularity to see if there's anything that's breaking that communion not god am i doing anything wrong you're going to send me to hell no god am i doing anything wrong that's displeasing to you so that I can walk with you you know I don't know about you bring up the natural example of a husband and wife but if my wife's quiet she doesn't respond very much when I talk to her you know and it's just oh whatever what have I done what what's wrong I gotta fix that you know she should be happy she should be you know she should be pleased she should be you know communicating she should be entered enthusiastic and so when she's not at home honey what you know what's wrong did I do something to bother you is there something wrong is the kids whatever it is I you know you can't rest till she's feeling better again till you know that old if momma ain't happy nobody's happy so you know you but you just desire to see that happiness back and you do what it takes to bring it back you know sometimes you just kind of give you some time space I guess but but you know you want to restore that communion because it's important yeah but you know with God we can just be so distant we haven't heard from God in months years happily married just going on with the Lord yeah I'm not really sure what God is doing I'm not really sure what God wants for me I'm not really sure you know I'm not really sure but you know I'm just just content to keep on going no I should make us uncomfortable if we don't know that we're walking in the perfect will of God it should make us uncomfortable you know if we're making decisions and we realized you know what I never even thought about what God's will is for me I trust that all happens to some of us sometimes it but you know if we get into that position be like okay well I guess I'll try next time no it should be Oh Lord did I make the right decision you know let me come back to you and and realize that I didn't even consult you on this is this the right thing for my life it's just the right thing did I make the right choice here and you know and if we didn't make the right choice don't just you know make some convoluted explanation of you know oh this is really the purple of God let me explain it say know what I think I missed it you know brother Rama I appreciate so much about him is that he had the humility to say I missed the Lord here or outright disobeyed the Lord here I knew I shouldn't go but I still went I knew I shouldn't do this but I did it anyway you know and then say oh my lord what what do you want from me now Paul says if we judge ourselves we won't be judge if we take time to examine our own lives and see what is the true focus of our spiritual attention and then turn it back to Christ if it's straight then God blesses that God's pleased by that you know the rich young ruler looked like he was interested in the will of God and brother BAM using him an example over and over and over again because he was speaking to people that were living good lives you know he's speaking to people that wouldn't went to church people that you know dress right people that lived right people that you know believe the Bible and you know we could say the same thing about all of us tonight every single one of us you know a message believer we would call ourselves every single one of us you know believe the brother brown was a prophet every single one of us you know believe that Jesus Christ died for our sins though most of us would be baptized and would have our lives dedicated to him and yet we could say the same thing tonight if there's anything in your life that you wouldn't be willing to give up in order to walk with God and you've got the rich young ruler looked like a faithful Israelite serving Jehovah but he had an idol in his life and it was an idol of gold just like him just like the Babylonians head of Daniel it was an idol of gold he wouldn't give up that money he wouldn't give it up and so even though he's crying out to God and flesh he's actually his worship is through an idol and when he finds out that it would cost him his idol in order to obtain eternal life he sticks with the idol in our own lives is you know we we fit that example of the rich young ruler like I said we're in a place where we know the word we're not even coming here tonight unaware of where God is we know where God is gods in his word we know that you know our lives can't live apart from that word and be pleasing to the Lord so if there's something that we're not willing to sacrifice to follow God then we're guilty of the same thing you know the same Israel that would go on to sin they made a declaration to the Lord many times and said that they would serve the Lord and I just want to bring your attention to one of them here Joshua 24 josh was explaining to them if they will serve the Lord then you will bless them and if they turn from the Lord then you'll bring them into judgment and turn them over to their enemies and verse 21 over 24 it says and the people said unto Joshua nay but we will serve the Lord and Joshua said unto the people you are witnesses against yourself yourselves that you have chosen you the Lord to serve him and they said we are witnesses and he says now therefore put away said he the strange gods which are among you and incline your heart unto the Lord God of Israel you know when the words presented to us we say oh I'll follow that I'll follow that but he says now put away the strange God put away the idols put aside those things that are taking your focus away you know put aside anything else that's that's got your attention anything else that's exalting itself above the will of God and get your attention properly in place because you're a witness against yourself I'm following the Lord you know the the Bible tells us that Jesus said you know God would give sight to the blind but not to the Pharisee because they said that they could see he said you're blind but you said you could see therefore your sin remains on you you know the blind man that comes to Jesus gets his sight but the one that says I'm the blind I don't need you Lord well then your sin remains with you because you said you don't have any need of it the encouragement comes Paul here in Hebrews chapter 12 last Scripture wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin with us so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us and then what does he do focuses our attention exactly where it needs to be looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God you know I often I talk about our place in the throne because I believe that's where our focus should be if our focus is on the throne we're looking right at Jesus because he's sitting in the throne we're looking at our position in the world and we're moving towards it you know try try looking somewhere else and walking in it looking at something and walking in a different direction it's really difficult to do you know because your body naturally wants to follow where you're looking and so you know when we look at the word if we're looking at the right thing our spiritual body starts to move in that direction as well you can't have your eyes on Christ properly and be off going in the opposite direction it doesn't work it tells us if we're finding ourselves constantly sidetracked it tells us that our attention is focused on things that are taking us in that direction I trust that helps you I I don't know your lives I don't I know my own life and I say god I see little idols cropping up from time to time and if I let them they become a bigger and bigger place in my life and I got to go through and sweep those things out of the way break them down you know looking at the kings of Israel many many times the scripture would give an account of all the different Kings you know this one was begotten and he raised up and it really only lists a couple of things if he did what was right on the side of the Lord and what he did with the idols you know and many of them had said he did what was right in the idols but he didn't cut down the groves and he didn't put away the strange guy you know the next one it'll say you know he he did wickedness you know he made more groves he made more idols he you know he made it greater than his father before him but you know it was the exception when a king would both do what was right on the side of the Lord and take all the idols there take all the high places down why because that's what we're driven to you is to find substitutes for God but I trust that God's bride he's not going to have an idol over here and God over here she's gonna put all those things away and concentrate her attention on here amen let's stand together I think I seem to some turn your eyes upon Jesus look full in his wonderful face it's so simple but I believe the Lord gives ministers this types of thoughts just to cause us to go through our lives you know go check and Israel had a time every year that they needed to go through the house and you know with a candle searching out every bit eleven why because things have a way of creeping in things have a way of warming their way into our lives and you know it's not up to the minister to come over your house with the checklist and say okay okay do I see any movies here okay do you see any music lessons you know it's not up to that it's up to you individually heads of home mothers fathers look at your life look at your home you know look at yourself and say God is there anything in me is there any 11 in here Lord because I know if there is it's just gonna continue to grow its just gonna leaven the whole lump but tear down those things lower take them away from me and and I know that if I keep my eyes on you I'm going to obtain [Music] [Music] [Music] Jesus father it's your spirit that we claim to live by Lord it's your spirit that we we want working in our lives Lord father you put this thought on my heart and but I don't know if it affects a single person though but I know it it affects my life Lord the devil always given us an opportunity father to find substitutes for you Oh Lord that's not what I want Lord I want my life to be fully yielded to you each day each moment Lord each thought each feeling father I pray that your spirit would touch each life tonight Lord if we would say father is there something hindering my life Lord Lord may you show us what it is Lord show us what's holding us back showing what what's got our attention father put your finger on it and then Lord we ask you to give us the courage the boldness Lord to put away those strange guy I'll put away those things that are hindering us not just till tomorrow but break those things down we want our attention we want our focus on you and Lord we know that your focus is on us because Lord your desire is to bring us home and set us in your throne Lord like a husband would like a wife to share a life that Lord is full of love that's what you have in store for us father I pray that you would just speak to us Lord not we know you don't condemn us but you can evict us the order you on our hearts you show us where we have new change I pray it changes it would give us the humility and the courage to do those things whatever it might cost we know we all up to be an eternal life we just commit each saint to you tonight Lord and I pray that Odin you'd go with us let let's not forget quickly your word but no and maybe we just linger on it think about it daily father we want our whole life subject father have your way we pray in Jesus you guys seem to song change my heart O God change my heart [Music] [Applause] Hey [Applause] [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I like singing however you want I like to let me be like you because there was the way that Jesus early Christ spoke creation he said let there be you know and I believe it's not presumptuous to say Lord let me be like you let that same creative word that spoke you know worlds into existence let it produce in me the character that you have Lord the very life that you have you're not afraid to put that in me but you it's your desire Lord to put that in me so let me be like you in it let's see that one more time I special comes change my heart Oh [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] god bless you try not to mr. law but I thought about it last night again tonight I didn't mention last night that's it the difference in our brother Macondo and brother Brandon his brother makan that closes seven times and brother Brandon and only closes maybe three times and so but began we never close God never closes it we close it but God doesn't guy keeps on going with it through through the night and into the next day right on maybe through your through your entire life by grace he'll keep on going because it is is work and sometimes we would like maybe sometimes there the way our brother preach you know there's one attitude in your head to another attitude I trust in your heart and sometimes we wish they cottonwoods would stop this or stop that you know but know God's going to keep at it because you've got a you got a war going on here there's a war going on and it is God versus Satan and when you're born again he comes into God comes into the soul drives that old nature of the devil out and he takes control he becomes the lord of your life then a man now Satan has got a battle on his hands Satan is still going to work in your flesh amen so Satan's are still gonna work in the senses of your flesh and in your mind amen but God is going to control what your soul and your spirit and reaching out through your spirit to control you to keep you in line with or amen to keep us in the middle of the road by the grace of God because the enemy is going to be there to get us to to go aside the enemy is going to be there as our brother preach tonight to to make us idol worshipers and listen again o mine just think of how far that the enemy is going to drive the people how far that he's going to he's going to push them into idolatry in the sense said the Bible says he will be in the temple of God being worshipped as God Amen just think of that people will come in and they're going to worship and they're gonna sing our brother brought it all out and even the doctrines and all of these things and the teachings and maybe even a testimony all these things and they think that they're worshiping God when they're they're worshiping the devil a man that that's how deceiving that Satan is so again as I have said don't just say you believe the message because the devil believes it and it became in faith it ought to give the bride faith they may never give him the faith that come down and gives us the faith by the grace of God to go out but he is working in your life and in mine he's been working and I heart brother brought it out through the word from Genesis right up through you know Satan has been working to get us into idolatry a man and in he did it with Eve in the Garden of Eden and he didn't be Cain outside and he did with the others and rain is so Satan hasn't changed and when it comes to his motive and his objective no no no he said he remember again the sermon we preached some years ago the five I wills of the devil in in Isaiah Ezekiel there I will I will ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the Most High I will this so he's working on that but God's working on I will he said he said I really should do this I will do this to redeem us back to himself again and God's working on that and E God's good cods gonna succeed but the enemy is going to be there and he's going to let the enemy there you know it's like the Bible says well who's gonna go down and deceive a a man what you mean to tell me God's gonna let somebody let let somebody do that yeah but God Himself wouldn't do it because that's not innate God's nature no no no and none of the angels in heaven that's not their nature no no no but a lying spirit came up before God and he said I'll go down and he said I would be a lying spirit in the mouth of all of his prophets what not the witness for the Wizards know y'all be a lying spirit in the mouth of all of his prophets a man this is a closer it is a man this is how much like the real thing is you know and like I said he was the first evangelist and he was the first preached resident worryingly in the in the in the Garden of Eden and then he and he made a convert and it was he and look what he made a gave her an idol he gave her an idol and she worshipped it and it was good you know and so on so and these things that are right on down to this out right I know that this age it is still an idol it is still an idol so I and he makes anything and everything in your life that appeals to your senses of your flesh are you going to try to make it an idol so our brother got used with God and our brother again denied confirming the word Amen God in our brother getting confirming when you've been hearing from the Prophet God in our brother Brandon confirming again while you've been earrings or you're a pastor Amen over all these years there are definite earrings through our brother Macondo any man that other surely that in this pulpit a man and he touched on something tonight and he went into something tonight and I thought about the other brother we had here brother Michael T and so on mothers listen God God God save as they are you are in you and in me and in this brother in this sister he's going to say the same thing Amen by the grace of God the word he's going to stay with the whole word not just nine out of that and he won't want you to throw one no no the devil that get try to get you to change one but not God so I thank God with a word tonight so hear the word of the Lord and cast the idols out of your life casts the idols out of your home and I did I did maybe we have touched on today over the years but I the brothers come in and he has crown something I told you to do such a few weeks ago apply the token to your houses apply the token to your home but by the token to your light well as I said throw this out throw that out well he come and identifying what you had to throw out those idols so brother and I'll tell you this yeah your your looks can become an idol and he said your money can become an idol you're a house can become an idol your car can become an idol and I'll be honest the more spiritual yet I believe the more you hate all those things amen and the more you're going to want you're going to want that body like unto his glorious body amen that's the truth a glutton that world I'm sick of it you know and again and maybe the people would feel even believers would feel as I mentioned I believe last night where somebody has asked to the Prophet surely you don't believe you know you don't want the God to in the world now know that doesn't make sense for a do we even ask that kind of a question he said I sure do he said I want God to end it now right now he's just so I can go and I come back before the Lord Jesus Christ hey man so how many years into it in their souls and then he has got the M&E and I had this message right here and it's it must be born again amen you must be born again so Anthony has got God in their souls he's got God in your soldiers stay with the word the whole word the nothing but the work and as the Bible says walk in the light as he is in the light have fellowship one with another and the blood of cleanse blood blood is applied to you amen but when well that I got sister said to me one time when she said brother she said I believe the blood of Jesus Christ she sets homes for my sin she didn't believe this she didn't believe that she didn't believe I said wait a minute I said the Bible says here walking the light as he is in the light and I said in you have fellowship with the other believers the body of Christ then the blood I said atone for your sins I said he redeems the body amen he redeems the body hey man you got to be a part of that body it was him as the body of Christ that went down and came back praise the Lord conquering Dan hell degrade a man so that he could give you victory over the world the flesh and the devil he already added as I brother brought that out tonight concerning Jesus you know and he didn't have to do the whole prayer yeah he didn't have to do this but he did it because he was God amen he was on he was the Word of God made flesh and you talk about white rice speak all you do is speak the word and he knew that a man but he did it in Italy it was an example for you identifying with you identifying with me and so that we could follow his example if any if he did it we ought to do it amen and the thing of it is people are not praying enough that is the absolute truth you've got to pray when you're walking you got to pray when you're working you got to pray when you're talking you got to pray with you when you're even listening to our brother Brandon tonight you ought to been in prayer in your soul pray pray pray amen oh that's not possible that is possible with God all things are possible so I pray God tonight you weren't going to listen to the word and you're gonna go home tonight and again and every day because the enemy is slipping it in and that's items into your life and he's slipping items into your home amen until finally he becomes the idol and they worship in the church not the bride by the church and there are many Saints as I said well lay down their lives because they're not going to go along with that even though they identify with this and identify with that but they're they'll get out of it and that thing will kill us amen like those Christians are they killed in the in Egypt three or four months ago and the last words on their lips was the Lord Jesus Christ amen their faith was in the Lord Jesus Christ when they cut wind went as far as I know they were beheaded but they lay down their lives for Jesus are we gonna lay down our lives for Jesus brother every don't let don't let the devil make our prosperity idols so that I we're gonna focus on that dwell on that and morning noon and night we're just concerned over this and worried over that and thinking about this so thinking about of that forget it this too shall pass away you've heard the truth you've heard the say it the Lord yeah they're making idols I'd have one another they make idols that are their possessions and yes they made items out of the profit they made idols that in the cloud of angels they made items that of the pillar of fire they would make an idol and out of out of the altar of fire and remembering again the power of God said it if you look at that picture and you see anything he said other than that cloud that pillar of fire he said he says you're not seeing that issue should and it's idolatry it is it is idolatry because but he said he said he said you know what your problem is he said you don't know you you're not catching the revelation he said I am a son of man revealing the son of man but what are they mr. make mistake they called him the son of man and that brother that day that when he went when he went to the Pope at that time and he was preaching and on the revelation series the church changes I believe was and this brother punted this note in his pocket and he got up to the pulpit and opened up and said William Branham is my lord I know who the brother was and the prophet of God got up and rebuked it and he said he said you you he said you but you call me that he said that makes me Antichrist and he rebuked it but still even today they believe that when Ibrahim was the Lord they may be with him Branham was God he was God as you are God because he got he had God in him amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost but he was not as John 1:1 said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God in the Word was God we were all with him but we were his we were we were his his sons and daughters in theophany form amen but but I bet the source of all power the source of all creation goes back to ethylene the self existing one praise the name of the Lord so again let's be warned let's reward don't let anything become an idol in your life you don't let your weight become an idol your husband make you become an idol your children become an island you don't let any of these things and today they make idols out of all of these things that's the truth brother amen whereas they allowed a man to what he's to what he was emphasizing tonight amen concerning idolatry as never before brother they never had it as as they got it in this I yes that's it we're trying to remember what about what about our brother said and the enemy is bringing all kinds of things into this world what for to give you an idol and to give this person Idol it's an idol to this one that's the night of that one that's a night on somebody else we're serving God come on God God is not going to overlook this and overlook that we think because we're good we're good answer God and God won't care this doesn't matter that it does matter because God knows the heart whether in the worth or not you really love whether or not you really want to serve Him a man God knows what's on the inside of the inside okay well you know if somebody can appear good outside but let's put them under the pressure and the stress of light of living for Jesus and see oh they're going to hack and react with that and somewhere some are gonna go home oh I can't take that I don't think I want me to take that to stand there I don't think God want me to go that way sure know what idiot nobody did I've not we end of it shows us that the scripture tells us to lay ourselves down as living sacrifices on the altar amen what I live worse that we live for Jesus amen and every live over Jesus is in the enemy is throwing all kinds of idols before us and he will make them appear to be all right they're fine and they'll serve this purpose they'll serve that purpose yeah like I talked about technology and I said I hate it yeah I hate it why because the more man gets into technology the further away from God he gets but we know that's where the prophet of God says science is taking them further with their knowledge than the churches with the word because God wants to get us away from that not to get me to put our attention on it don't fear people love it there are some people love it love it love it cast it into the fire and let it be burnt just listen when it comes to those things just get what you need nothing else just what you need now I want to keep up with this and keep up with that that's the devil amen the devil with his knowledge and all these things remember II said the brother God did say education and civilization is of the devil and it is because the more man gets caught up with that the further away from God he gets that's right because the enemy has got your attention God is there to get trying to get your attention hi brother Brendan brought out tonight he confirmed again what brother quotes are preached years or old there's a man in his 80s now and he ministered years ago I don't know where there or was on tape and he had no who was in it was in Tucson him brother greens assembly and he said he's talking about you got your hearing two voices calling your name and he said W if you're a Christian oh it's the voice of God I'll use David David David and you hear the voice of God but then the enemy comes around and learns your weaknesses and he'll say David but God says dead the enemy says David God says David and then if he says David he got your attention and you turned your back on God oh yeah grace no he said now one of the others gonna get your attention he said remember God never left you you left him and he's and the devil's out there and he's calling you get your checks into this get your attention to that did you tension something else it's the idols that our brothers ministered on tonight God give us the revelation so that we're going to do that the devil's voice is going to get lower and lower does get louder yes brother I agree we need a direct relationship with God and not a lot of the enemy to bring in the hydras of pleasure friends family job money no no dude many things everything out there whatever your weakness is you'll work on it to decrease your attention to the Lord and our brother again brought out the brass serpent became an idol ministers and Creed's become idols that's the truth ministers and doctrines they're making idols out of the doctrines gifts do become idols and that's why the angel of the Lord came down and told brother Branham he said brother Branham stop using those gifts he said because you're causing the people to lean on a signpost how true it was I could say amen brother Brendan and I tell you if you're listening to have listened to the tapes and you've heard them by the Holy Ghost you can say amen to what our brother said tonight that that's the truth that people got excited over nine today they were quiet when they're going to preach of the word but wonder when the signs and wonders begin to come into manifestation it wasn't quiet then but signs and wonders you can believe that and go to hell as you said you could be healed and go to hell that's right but you got to believe the word and be calmed or as he preached last night be the light be the light of God be the light of Christ in this world by the grace of God a man so grace to us that the word will find a resting place in our souls and the Holy Ghost will work on it to get us ready for the rapture and are going home to be with the Lord Jesus Christ amen and trusting as he finished with tonight that that we had come you I do believe in taking the natural communion some people don't but we do but it's a type of a spiritual communion oh yes the problem of God said the word the message he says going to throw us back to cut to Calvary and he said Calvary is going to throw us into the rapture so we want to take the communion but people sometimes will go to church take natural communion and that's it they're buying no no make sure that you will sit down and take the spiritual communion amen amen he eat the word the bread of the word of God and drink the wine of the simulation of the revelation by the grace of God heard not the oil or the wine the Holy Ghost bringing forth the word tonight and the wine to stimulate the revelation into your soul wonderful thank God for the word tonight hey man that was good idols stay away from idols also just before I finish sister Maureen that buys me that she had been talking to my email she had heard from sister Eileen reads in st. Lawrence and she expressed her desire to be here with us for all the fellowship but she's asked us to pray for her that she would have a closer walk with God good so I pray that you'll put it on your prayer list for our sister Eileen it's rare it's long long long time since he's being in here but we pray the grace of God to be with her and to help her pray the power of the Holy Ghost overshadow her give her the strength she needs a man to overcome well whether it's you know the influence a family or friends or might be some idols that our brother preached on tonight because there's none of us here there's not been influenced by idolatry in one form or another so the grace of God to be with us and help us and help the saints that are online and across the island and those that will hear this in in Africa and I don't know where else in the world that these DVDs will go so we pray the grace of God to each one we need to get closer to the Lord most definitely we got to get so close we become one with him and we gotta get so close that we have perfect faith to walk off the earth amen and God was taking us closer tonight by giving us the revelation of something that might have been holding some of us back trusting that we'll take it act on it and get closer to Christ also I have printed this before but I have printed it she just a few copies again outside and it is what Jesus thinks of the nuclear family what Jesus thinks not what you think now with us as human beings think not what the world thinks but what Jesus thinks of the nuclear family in this age what comes first in your life is it God or your family you can remember your family can become idols as well idolatry so I pray just if you got a copy home go back and read it again and some would maybe look at who wrote it and maybe wouldn't even consider reading it because they would say oh well he's not a he's not a believer he belongs to this church of that church well you never know he might be there God knows because he spoke the truth and this was an editorial in the magazine of the church that he belonged to I want my own one mention of those names but he wrote this as an editorial as a public witness he took his stand I pray God will take our state because if not he'll rise in judgment against us amen what Jesus thinks of the nuclear family god bless you amen I want to sing the song which the prophet of God said that we're going to hear him sing when we get to the other side he said you're here some man down there sitting under a tree it's the same Amazing Race he said you can say oh brother bet I made it he's gonna sing he said Amazing Grace and it is amazing grace if any one out of this generation in this age with all the idolatry around if anyone escapes and makes it into the rapture as a living Saint it's the grace of God our brother Branham told our brother Levi oh he's her brother most of the older folks around this message will go by way of the grade he said they won't be here for the rapture for the change they were not ordained or predestinated onto rapturing faith but there's a generation he said that would be predestinated ordained to rupturing paint and he said we got to come to a perfect faith for the rapture and then of course he said you young ministers he said you're ordained to take this message on to the coming of the Lord well I was quite young back then in my late teens brother Brendan I don't know I don't think he was born but again identified as a young minister with a tremendous responsibility to take them that take the message in such a way ministered in such a way to the people is to take us on to the rapture and the change by the grace of God remember what we're waiting to happen he explained that he said the dead in Christ is going to appear to us the living Saints were going to be changed instantly cut into that dimension with them and then he said after a space time we call the time will be an eternity he said we'll look up at that pillar of fire will have incarnated in the body called Jesus and he said he'll be descending in the cloud to receive us unto himself and will rise he said to meet Jesus so that he's not history he's our present reality not I was I am I pray God that Christ is not I was our loss or was he as I am and then let's same amazing grace that was manifested in Christ revealing Christ as now it's revealed in your life and mine by the grace of God wishing it and I'm going to turn it over to our brother Bob Amazing Grace [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hey [Music]
