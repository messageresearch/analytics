the Lord God blesses will give the glory to Jesus but let's tell of his wonderful love a man that he loved us a man truly had to see something that we didn't see event ever the devil was putting putting us the emphasis on other things negative things but Jesus was seeing the positive amen Satan was reminding us you're born and see it conceived and seeing shaped in iniquity you come to the world speaking lies a man would thank God that Jesus saw something else a seed in our hearts a man and all he needed to do is water that seed oh and it would come forth I trust this bringing forth the revelation of Christ in you amen by the grace of God Amen Lord bless you turn with me to the Book of Luke chapter 22 amen and considering the number of sermons I have to press to preach three or four sermons this morning a man so we'll see what the weather's going to be like well we leave that with the Lord amen so it is absolutely amazing that you that I could go so far not to preach not preach not preach amen and it's really a burden so we pray the Lord be with us and help me as we go further into what we've been ministering on and it has to do with being a prisoner of Jesus Christ a man not a prisoner of the devil and for the world this the last few days they've been prisoners of Santa Claus that's the truth they've been prisoners of Santa Claus and it's amazing after all those years they don't want to bring Christ into craving into Christmas they want they want still put the emphasis on Santa Claus Santa Claus Santa Claus a man and Santa Claus well I won't say it but you know a van we're gonna put the images on Jesus amen because we know Santa Claus is a lie they've made it remember as as the devil lied to Eve at the beginning and whether he's like a plaintiff there there's us Eve's a day he's still lying to her a man and what it was then so it is now always good it's wonderful is this is this is this well let's get let's become a person of Christ hey man see if we'll have the same attitude Amen to see if we think it's still good hey vana says our brother was appreciated that God is good hey man let's see if we really believe most of the world they believe the Santa Claus is good no no we believe Jesus is good god is good a man considering the mercy and the grace that he has toward us he's good a man we don't deserve it that's the truth in this flesh we don't deserve it amen but still praise the Lord he came and did what he did in a sinless body a man he laid down his life picked it up again what is it what for not for himself for you and me a man he could have called ten thousand angels destroyed the world set him free but he didn't do it you know why he stayed there for you and me hey man praise the Lord you talked about the prisoner to Christ he was a prisoner to Redemption a man he wanted to do what he had to do to redeem us and remember again he fought it or he struggled with this in the flesh but and he went and win and win and to finally he said not my will I'd be done amen let the Word of God that let that preeminence in you and in me a man is not what I want it's what God wants it's not what I want to do it's what God wants to do and this is Saints did anything God wants to do right now it is the resurrection and the rapture a mad look will again look back what God was doing in Luther's age Wesley's age - Pentecostal age so what's he doing now amen because all that's gone all that's in the past what's God doing now let's focus on it on the word and focus on the message a man to see what God is doing a man and just just a day or two ago when I was in a supermarket and I looked at this magazine and oh they had a picture of Jesus there and on the cover and I went through it went through it went through it and you know when the last pages was Christ and the mystery of the seven seals a van Reverend they refer and they actually refer to revelation 10 they referred to revelation here revelation there and the revelation that John out of Jesus a man I said Lord this is a witness to the world this is absolute I was absolutely amazed because all through the book they had this they had that about Jesus they're dead about his method of ministry and to finally they got into revelation and the revelation that John add of Jesus a man and the revelation that Christ was revealing the John concerning the the mystery of the seven seals as I said what they're seeing that if they're seeing that what are we to see a man if they are acknowledging that and but that's one of the most famous magazines around the world and it's been on the goal for years and years and years I remember as a boy that my parents you said that magazine coming around a monthly basis to their homes a man and now it's out there still still in the supermarket still in the end where over the books and magazines are sold this is absolutely amazed finished it's over with a man because the bed there's gonna be a witness to the whole world a man that's the truth concerning Jesus a man Jesus but concerning the mystery of the seven seals that's to the bright and is to give us a resurrection and wrap through faith a man so the grace of God be with us brother we're living in a tremendous hour get ready it's finished amen don't focus on this world don't focus on your natural life this focus on our spend the spiritual life by the grace of Almighty God amen so the Lord blesses and we welcome our brother onyx sister Rebecca and the family amen and sister yes Lily amen brother Ellie's not here Ellie's not here okay god bless brother Ellie we've missed him too a man so the Lord bless him and our brother and sister Columba guess they left early amen according to iron store brother mark they're gonna leave early because of the forecast of the storm well we'll see amen far the Lord will let us go this morning amen so Lord bless you and in Luke chapter 22 and beginning to read at verse 28 that we have read this before but to bring to our remembrance because we have missed maybe several services and it says in verse 28 ye are they which have continued than my temptations a man and he said an I appoint unto you a kingdom as my father has appointed unto me a man wonderful that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom praise the Lord and sit on Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel let's give God the glory brother Lilith's brother let's see if Amen God is putting you to the test here by the grace of God a man so you can judge things there you were judged things there a man and you're going to judge it by the words you're going to stay but with the word a man it's got to be the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth and it says so he said eat and drink that you made and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on the thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan has desired to have you then he may sift you as wheat and he was desired to have Simon he desired to have us that he may sift us as wheat but he said I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted a man thank God Jesus prayed for Peter jesus prayed for you and me so that when we were converted we were going to become prisoners to him a man and prisoners to the word so he said I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not email because he believed that Jesus was the Messiah and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren and if we are converted will strengthen our brothers and sisters in the faith a man Nigel please in the name of the Lord we're not living just living for ourselves we're living for Christ and we're living for Christ we're living for the body of Christ a man because Christ is in his body the bride and he said unto Him Lord I am ready to go with thee both into prison and to death a man and he said I tell thee Peter the shall not crow this day before thou as well did not thrice deny that thou knowest me a man it was before he was converted not after but after he would never deny you godless his word may be seated and after when Peter was imprisoned he was a prisoner of Christ before the remember before you become a prisoner when it comes to the natural presence of this day you become a spiritual prisoner to Jesus a man Paul was a prisoner of Jesus Peter became a prisoner of Jesus a man and then when he was converted a man by the grace of God he truly entered into that that control of our Lord Jesus Christ so that to the extent that brother when they were going to take Peters life he didn't want to do it the way they want to do it he said I tell you there were two crucify him as Peter has he crucified Jesus they did but he said now he said but don't do it the way you did Jesus and he said because Jesus was like this but he said I want you to deter me I'd down all mine praise the name of the Lord just think that he wasn't worthy he didn't feel worthy to die the same way that Jesus died on the cross now we know that we will see the cross I know that there's there's there crosses there somewhere but but when it's not exactly the cross that they crucified Jesus on because the cross that word that we're having now really it's the image that they started with the Catholic Church and it continues right on down to this hour and it's a cross like this but that's not what Jesus was crucified on while Jesus was crucified on was this a man it wasn't this it was this a man why because well I'll come that they would do that because when they do that a man then they they're going to they're going to die because they're trying to get their breath and they can't get the red a man and it's the same thing when Jesus of course he already a down he's like a man but the thing of it is what happened to those two two thieves that were crucified with him but they were holding their feet and holding their body up trying to stay alive trying to trying to keep their breath and so on but Jesus let go and Jesus died he gave up the ghost amen he willingly they didn't take it from him he willingly laid down his life for you and for me amen praise the name of the Lord the devil was there to try to kill him but he laid down his life a man he gave up his life but when it comes through the other thieves they went the soldiers went there what do they do they drove a spear at their side a man so their blood would go out banner and they would just I don't know they didn't drive the spear in their sight they broke their legs a man they broke their legs praise the name of the Lord because the Bible prophesy concerning Jesus that not a bone should be broken praises the name of the Lord Amen hallelujah for they broke their the legs of the thieves so that they never had the strength to keep themselves up and to keep breathe breathing and so they just suffocated and they died but when they got the Jesus says oh he's already dead what he's already dead yeah why because he gave up his life he didn't lose it because of while he was on the cross but he gave it up he yielded up the ghost but still a man there was no bone broken that was prophecy praise the Lord but still they drove the sword amen and the spear in his sight why because the blood had to be shed a man he was sure he's going to shed his blood for you and me and brother the thing of it is the prophet has highlighted it and he said the blood where did that blood go a man he says that blood went down he said to the earth he said because he's not only redeeming you and me he's redeeming the earth praising hallelujah he said where he said we're gonna receive a new body like unto his glorified body and he see there's going to be a new heaven and a new earth a man redeemed he said as we're changed so the earth is changed as we're changed so the heaven is change a man just think as I said we're going out of time and into eternity and we're going out of the case of man into the kingdoms of God and just saying there's going to be absolutely no sin there's going to be absolutely nothing to remind us of sin there's gonna be nothing in our flesh nothing in her bodies nothing they may that we're not going aqua amen to top of God taking Oh taking it all away from our memory amen we're going to go into a bar listen by the baptism of the Holy Ghost restores our memory and we now we know where we come from and by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the Word of God we know where we're going amen we are the sons and daughters of God and he may have filled with the Holy Ghost the life of God to take us back will he come from he knows us no it's not it's not that there is say a serpent seed out there there's the seed of the devil a man but God is looking for any redeem what the seat of God those who me knew before the foundation of the world those that were with him any in eternity before the foundation of the world and we were in theophany bodies a man but Jesus came to lay down his life to share his life with you and me to bring us back to a glorified body a man and brother like onto the body that he raised up from the dead a body that didn't know when he sinned amen he identified that he was tested in all points like as we are yet without sin a man thank God for that absolute perfect sacrifice a man and brother hallelujah and you get to the revelation of Jesus the revelation of redemption you're going to become a prisoner to Jesus a man not a prisoner to the Rome that a prisoner to this church or that church not a prisoner to the governments of the world amen you're a prisoner to Jesus a man and you're gonna do what Jesus wants you to do when he wants you to do it how he wants to do it and where he wants you to do it brother sister we come to the will of God now I will then be done amen and brother what was the will of God that controlled all of the will that controlled us in these last few days what was the will that control you in the last few days brother are we living for ourselves are we living for Jesus amen and we are going to go forward reflecting our natural lives are we going forward to reflect the life of Jesus amen by the grace of Almighty God amen brother and this is this is what the new birth is all about you're dead the crisis living in you amen and if you're dead to you to yourself and you're dead to your old nature rather than the new nature's in control amen when it comes to your thoughts and your motives and your objectives amen it's all under the control of the new nature it's all of the control of the Lord Jesus Christ amen again it is not you that it is what race they live within you brother ease in control a man so it was in control these last few days who has been in control these last couple of weeks when we when we have put off the services to put off the services and so on amen who are we serving a man I trust brother that we still we don't we don't lose and lose the remembrance of Jesus I trust we did we weren't giving no attention to Santa Claus amen brother then again he's the god of this world a man especially at this time of the year and again when it comes to another two or three months and Easter comes they're going to make the the rabbits the god of this world a man when I know Jesus see they're putting less and less emphasis on cheese and brother as it was in the sin in the first ministry of the revealed Word 2,000 years ago so it is in this hour and in these last days there's going to be less and less and less emphasis put on Jesus as the absolute truth and as I reminded you where the prophet of God did ask the Lord the question when he was in that hotel and they wanted to see him want to see him and he said Lord who are they coming to see near you they were coming to see William Branham they were coming to see this they're coming to see that but not Jesus why because they wanted a miracle they wanted healing a man and they'll probably do that their emphasis wasn't on Jesus give the glory to Jesus it was they ought to get what they wanted amen and brothers are part of God said you can be healed and go to hell amen and you can have the Holy Ghost he said on your life outside wordly and he said and go to hell you can have it 24 hours a day so then go to hell a man but that's all I were to saw what you're feeling in your flesh is all what you're doing your pleasure and what you want in your flesh what is your you feel in your soul and whatever you want in your soul what the soul on weena thirsting for a man if we were born again by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're hungry and thirsty for the same thing Jesus I'm gonna thirst for a man and that was the good at a time and into eternity and then again that's why he said much longer shall I be with you and he said he said the finally he got he cut he passed by the first or second pole and he and he was entering the third pole and he said well he said I have no more in the world oh brother what a revelation amen it a come to that hour to come to that place in his natural life in the physical life amen the lay down his life pick it up again amen and go from time to eternity a man and he was anyway he would send the anointing of the of that light the anointing of the blood that he was going to shed the life of the blood that he was setting he was going to send it back to this to catch his sons and daughters and they were going to bring us back to glory praise the name of the Lord Alleluia brother God's got a plan God's got a purpose in God's plan a pattern and brother I tell you it wasn't emphasized with them through the church ages only in the last stage it was an emphasis even in the Pentecostal age but it was mainly in this last page amen and that is why God sent Malachi for a may that is why the Prophet was sent on the scene a man a man it was to reveal Jesus Christ like John the bed and point the boy to Jesus Christ but it was also to give us the revelation we need in this day what is that revelation it is the revelation that God got a plan God got a purpose and God got a pattern Amen because no other age was kidding but it was taken into consideration the plan the purpose of the pattern oh god I tell you this brother sister mother most that we knew was oh yeah oh yeah the devil did that in the Garden of Eden and we're all in seeing so Jesus has come to save us from sin if we want to be saying amen not having the revelation of the pre decimated seed of God amen oh and thinking though they thought maybe that oh yeah like people still think today maybe that Cain was Adam son he was not at son a man definitely not he was the seed of the serpent and any like we say the serpent was an ugly creature like a man a man so that his cecum mingle with man and that's why the devil he flows the serpent to influence eight and brother and I turned to this the devil is influencing the a man the serpent even today to influence the eve of this day remember what went on then is still going on now and the day oh my gracious mother sister in the name of Jesus don't you cut out weather with it whether the revelation of the tree of knowledge of good and evil let's make sure that we're we're caught up with with the tree of life amen eternally not just good and evil amen where we don't need a greater revelation of good and evil we need a revelation of the truth even in Revelation what God has done and we need a revelation what God is doing Amen praise the Lord Pentecostal and Luther and Wesley and all the others a man will thank God for it but brother they were they were just caught up in the entering the revival of what God had done what God had done God reveal this God revealed a God reveal that but brother what are we caught up with and what has God revealed to us in this day in this hour we've gone beyond justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit we've gone into amen the revelation of the seven seals the mystery of God amen the mystery of God is stratus a man in this day in this hour and it is ordained to give the bride rapturing faith a man and again to encourage our brother and I I think you were a brother in India and there was a been in contact with me wanting to understand this one do you understand that and especially concerning fasting because he is B he's been bun to the pressure they that he's gotta pass and he's got a play for right free faith no brother we got to believe the word for a free faith a man is not one and not one if there's not fasting and praying is believing what God has already done amen what are you going to fast forward we're going to pray for well I got a fast for this frame fast travel God's only done it it's already here now God's asking you to believe the word amen so Bo there was a when when God was moving for the Saints too fast and they had to play and brother I tell you we're going to we're going to be not just getting down to pray we're going to be walking and pray we're going to be we're going to be worshiping and prayed we're going to be all just just yeah if we go to bed our souls are going to be praying it ain't man they playing on is their we're praying morning noon and night where we're constantly in fellowship with Jesus we're constantly a man conscious of above our Lord Jesus Christ conscious of God and we're talking to the Lord even if you're in your job even if you're in your education even if you're in school even if you're in university amen if you're sitting in a class there give me Jesus to preeminence amen brother even in no matter where you are what you're doing Jesus is right there and you'll hear him before you hear the others amen he'll talk to you in your heart and in your soul hallelujah that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost it is Christ in us to hope of glory amen and again as I said it's not me that lives us Christ liveth in me is that true not just today not on not on Wednesday not on a Sunday but it's Christ that lives in you 24 hours a day hey man you wake up we're in the revelation of Jesus you go to sleep in the revelation of Jesus you're walking in the revelation of Jesus amen by the grace of God it's Christ amen because we know Lord we need your leadership in all things we need your understanding in all circumstances all situation what is your will Lord for my life what is it you want me to do what is it you don't want me to do amen and there are a lot of so called believers brother sister amen they're not doing what Jesus wants them to do they're doing what they want to do and really it is Satan influencing them in their flesh it is Satan influencing I saying that as our as the flesh and the natural things of life not the spiritual but brother it were born again we are caught up and caught into the revelation of what God is doing amen we're not gonna look back and say he did this and he did that oh yeah I did this with Luther he did that with Wesley did that with it willaboo he did that with a better cause no no what is he doing now see he was trying to get Martha into the presence to tense revelation of Jesus Christ and when he said Martha I am the resurrection and life believest thou this a man not dead Lancers is going to rise up in the future but he said I in the resurrection why the resurrections right there a man no no the resurrection wasn't up in the future the resurrection was raped right in the present tense he was right there outside outside Lazarus - hey and as I said they noted in the Bible that Jesus wept and again he wasn't crying for Lazarus boy in the world would he cry for Lazarus a man because he said he said I got to go around and wake him out of his sleep he knew what he was going to do and he and the way that he said Lazarus is not dead I trust praise the Lord amen I trust the saints that are gone on they're not dead what do you mean dead totally separated from God amen but there are those that are dead in Christ amen but they're not separated from God amen to God be the glory amen so Jesus and Jesus stood there and he was crying because of their unbelief oh yeah and they didn't believe oh yeah we're all come to these state of ways for so long and now he's here because Lazarus is dead and Lazarus in the tomb and now he's crying and even they thought well if he if he came back when Lazarus was sick he with a healed Lazarus and those who wouldn't have died but as far as these were concerned it was no man no more for Jesus to raise him than to heal him hey man Alleluia so brother we thank God for the revelation that God has given us in this hour of Jesus but let's not let's not let's not turn it down let's not turn away from it let's not ignore it brother we gotta we gotta read and become one with the revelation one with the revelation what God has done and one with the revelation what God is doing amen so let's not let's not reject the revelation and there's a quote sure you can pick up on the way out and it's referring to rejecting Jesus oh yeah he said they said they rejected Moses you rejected this prophet that prophet who they're rejecting they're rejecting God they're rejecting Jesus amen and to reject the revelation that God has ordained for them right in this hour if surgery is to reject Jesus amen God is Jesus easier and Jesus is endeavoring to give us what we have knee a million and yet there's a lot of believers have rejected it oh yeah there's a lot of hi and I don't know be offended but a lot of believers that are living more for their natural family than they are for Jesus brother you can't live for your natural family the way you should unless you live for Jesus first Jemez if you live for Jesus and he got preeminence in your life now you know you go and live and live for your family and now you can go and be the example that God wants you to be to your sons your daughters a man your husband your wife a man grandmas and grandpas a man see it's got to be Christ is Christ Christ in them Christ in you a million by the grace of Almighty God so God elbows brother that we will lay aside every weight and every sin that easily besets us amen every weight and every sin that the devil can use to weaken us the desert they used to get us out of the will of God a man so brother let's make sure that we are a prisoner of Jesus Christ and not a prisoner of the devil a man he became a prisoner of Satan he became a prisoner of the server of the serpent amen brother banana gain hey Adam was still a prisoner of God but he voluntarily put himself in sin with Eve so that God redeeming Adam would redeem Eve see that spirit of Christ in the first annum and the Spirit of Christ in the second Adam any man the second Adam put himself and said for you and me so they hallelujah redemption in him will bring for redemption in you and me brother although the Bible is absolutely perfect amen the Word of God is absolutely perfect eight million and brother again it's only in this hour to the bride that we got the revelation of planned purpose and pattern why so that will recognize what God has done what God is doing and what God will do how do we know it because of the revelation of the plan the purpose and the pattern amen they didn't need that full revelation in other ages like we do now amen because they God just know what they need it for that our take them through that age a Manny and the next stage in the next stage Amen moving on moving on 8 million but in this hour brother without moving from one age to another we're moving from time to eternity hey man so brother God is requiring more of us than he required although the other ages hey because God has given us a greater revelation than he has given the others and they they never preached planned purpose and pattern they just all mine well well praise the Lord we're sinners wiener in need of celebrations thank you Jesus for saving us and they went on and preached it salvation salvation salvation but now and that was the salvation of our souls anybody oh we're gonna go to heaven we're gonna go to heaven amen when we die no now we're to the place where if the if the daddy Christ rise first what about those that are alive you song the song those that are alive are gonna rise a man and we're going to ascend with the dead in Christ to meet the Lord in the air hey bad prey and the emphasis was important listen he's been in the Pentecostal age there was some depth of the emphasis on the resurrection of rapture but MOOCs are putting the emphasis on the gifts and the signs and the wonders a million two finally God takes all that away preach the Lord any minute he takes it all the way so that now we believe the word because see it got our attention to the Lord and saying again praise the Lord God God gave the prophet of God that you know there this sign in the hand and oh yeah left hand not the right amazing we shake hands with our shake right hands but no it's the left hand was it it's hard to hurt amen praise the Lord and he gave me that sight of the hand and he gave me the power of the anointing of the revealed word of the Messiah God discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart and what for what was that for what did God do that to get their attention it wasn't all just to heal them just to do this just to do that know once to get their attention but after after after he had used that person's second pull aim and of these two signs and and what happened till finally got had to tell him to stop it praise the Lord Gaza stop it don't use that don't use those signs no more he could but but to fight anyway because they were leaning on the signpost a man it's like I said but but us years and years and years ago when we when we first lived in here at Saint John's and we would drive from our hometown back here during the summer and we look after a while would be looking at the signs oh how much longer how much longer oh oh yeah okay and all the st. John's if st. John's day at st. John's this yeah well I'll tell you back then it was miles now it's now it's different a man brother back in Pentecost if one thing now it's different a man know now the signs are going to strike us differently it's going it's going to produce in us something that anybody that the other message has never produced that's the truth praise the name of the Lord I'll turn you all down through was just adding to their faith adding to their faith justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit but now God is giving us faith for rapture any man that this brother God Israel is requiring a tremendous revelation of us tremendous faith you talk about without faith it is impossible to please God amen and whether it's got me the faith that God is looking for in you and in me a man Bible says by faith able to this my faith that you know Noah did it by faith Enoch did this it's a man by faith by faith by faith God gave him their faith and that was the painter please God a may just say well the faith that it ever there please God in a table was the right sacrifice amen they paid that please God and Noah was believing what God said about the flood in the ark and he built the ark amen it was the evidence of his faith amen praise the name of the Lord and Noah was the voice that the ark was a sign oh yeah praise the name of the Lord and then what we've with a port for Enoch because before Oh hallelujah Amen because before the flood came Enoch walked with God was not because God took him hey and yet he know he had that son and we need any and in the name of his son prophesied of the judgment that was coming on the air through the flood oh yeah he not knew it and goodbye God took me knocked off a man and brother we know all this going on on the earth today and in this hour we know what's caring brother even even the old mine their their forecasting now high waves are gonna strike and they said the waves are gonna be something like I think they says I'm like 18 feet yeah and and I know somebody asked me one time and they said Cheryl all this going on with the waves and all this going on with the waters I thought they said God said that he wouldn't he wouldn't destroy the earth with a flood no more I said noise he's not I said but that's that's the sign of God's judgment I said is not God destroying the earth like he did in the days of Noah I said it's just a judgment that God is striking this country in that country striking this is this Shore that's short and so on a man SS are united up he's coming it's a sign that we're at the end and not only that now we're witnessing there is so much fire going on around the world and even in Australian we pray the grace of God to the Saints of God in Australia and all the fire that's going on there there's been a lot of fire in in California there's been a lot of fire other places of the world and brother what is it it is a type of the fire of God falling on the earth it is a type of the fire of God's judgment coming on the earth a man so don't think Oh Lord what why is that why is that Lord stop this stop that brother we're not going to ask God to stop it we ask God to protect the saints of God wherever those things are going on amen but we know it is a sign let's look a man and when you see all these things going on it's not getting all that let's have a prayer service and stop this to stop that now amen you know hope that I'll turn to this whether it's good they are scary when when all of these things get worse and worse and worse churches are going to start adding prayer services to stop this and stop that and stop some of you don't know look up the Bible just don't get down and pray and stop it look up when you see this look up because why it's it's over a man it's over brother's last like the idea old Noah when they were they were there they're in the arc and all of a sudden oh is raining oh oh - pouring oh we better ask Lord to stop it no he already prophesied it that's where you had the Ark and brother thank God for the other reveal word amen the Ark of the revealer to let us know this day and this power hey man when I asked on my in the name of Jesus let's not does not be praying out of the widdle garlis a snake little God as prisoners of our Lord Jesus Christ Oh what's wrong with you you won't pay for this you won't pray for their brother it's need I'm looking up he told me when I see this when I see that I hear this when I hear that look out because the day of our redemption draws nigh hey man no we don't know say God stop it god stop it oh my lord help us in the name of Jesus believe what you have said we believe what you've done yeah but let's believe what he's doing so what's he doing in you was he doing in me now it's true when it comes to a resurrection or rapture if God is going to bring it to pass brother it's going to be in you and in me it's going to you're going to give you a greater and greater and greater revelation of the Resurrection greater a greater revelation of the rapture amen and brother if you're a prisoner of Christ you're going to yield to that revelation you're gonna let that revelation control you not you control it any man and there's too many trying to control this revelation that revelation this doctor of that doctrine no it's my control you say again medon't let it control you then the Christ is not in you hey he's not in that controlling you so brother I pray the girl oh my let go of what you want to do let's do what God wants us to do how God wants to do it when God wants to do it amen and praying that grace even for her brother hornik here and what he's been looking for a pain the grace of God a made in our brother's life and sister Rebecca's like a man sure so we would certainly love to have a for fellowship more and more a man will leave it with the Lord amen our sister Lily our brother Ellie hey man Raleigh's amen and yes our brother facial ear praise the Lord for our brother Joshua well he's established amen praise the name of the Lord he's not an African he's a new fee and then he a man hey whoa praise the Lord you're on the rock hallelujah praise the Lord as I said it's not by reason coincidence said that the island of Newfoundland is referred to as the rock we thank God for the rock of ages' a man that he that the Rock of Ages is here and those living on the rock are on the rock spiritual by the grace of God amen so brother is not my wheel this is Willy we're prisoners of Jesus no matter what he wants me to do win we're how we're gonna do it and again that's why I said like I said I've had so much experience in my life you know even even from janitor or whatever doing this doing that amen and then I went on to this went on to that all the sides Lord whatever you want I'll do it amen that's that's exactly right I said I've said Lord why did you ever what did you do this why did you do that hey man it was the will of God somewhere God was working at something in me a man by the grace of God and there's there those today or they don't want to do this didn't want to do that make something I never said that I never told that Lord I don't want to do this I don't want to do that Lord whatever you want amen so he's it's the grace of God my brother that we're gonna do is will not our will and it's all a reason and it just praise the Lord and it's the experience that I had just a few days ago not long ago when I I because we received the Christmas card from a certain gentleman and oh yeah every year and I think he's 82 years old now and so I said wouldn't we get the card we finally got one and I'll call it sister Betty said you should call her and I called it and it was it it is sis brother and sister burns his son Howard all what a time what a wonderful time of fellowship we had on the phone oh my it was wonderful he said do you think you journal he said he said for the blessing you've been easy to mom and dad and he said all he said how you've helped them all he said I'll tell you said you were tremendous help spiritually oh I'm glad they recognize it amen and I remember when we did our we did funeral for sister burns and of course he was there and the choir of the church that he attended was there and they were all in the balcony and so on and after thus after the funeral service online and because at one point to someone told me that don't take to belong to priest and the funeral director he came and he said listen pastor he said don't you shorten it for me he said keep preaching he said he said he's because he was now that you know that's the funeral director he was standing he was standing by the door in going into the chapel and he stayed there the whole time of the funeral standing by the door and he was responding to the word amen and and of course after the funeral and none of the people from from Howard and and he's only the choir back then a number of years ago and they come oh they said Howard we need that preached in our church yeah I won't say what church was but he said we need that preached in our church and and of course ours kept coming back coming back coming back a bad told to God neither glory amen he was I said well Louis the grace of God brother that I did what I did and not only that I said it was sister parents that told me I was called to be a pastor I said I told her I said no I said I don't feel that no yes she said you got that anointing you got that calling in your life okay sister we'll see we'll see so the Lord the Lord did it amen so brother again as a prisoner of Christ brother is not Austin makes the decision its Jesus makes the decision amen and you and you follow the decision that Jesus makes as Paul was a prisoner of Jesus so now all the elect of God are prisoners of Jesus amen all we consider ourselves prisoners of this prisoners are that and I'll tell you the hardest area like I say there are those that those are this this or this age they they've been prisoners amen prisoners of Santa Claus that's the truth now they be prisoners of the Easter bunnies and there are those that are prisoners of the church they are in but I tell you this there's a few and getting less and less and less fewer and fewer of those who are prisoners of Jesus that's right even even believers I find that there's less and less and less prisoners of Jesus they're living for themselves oh thank you Lord for what you did yeah well what am i doing son what am i doing daughter Oh Lord well you're just revealing what you did know he's revealing what he's doing and who a lot of believers is just what he did oh I'm seeing it more and more now what he did no sir you got to get beyond that into what he's doing amen the present tense revelation this is what Jesus was encouraging his disciples to get in present tense revelation but they didn't get it on to the day of Pentecost amen and Jesus prayed for them by the grace of God amen so let's make sure that we are prisoners of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and as Jesus was prophesying to Peter that it was the hours coming when he become a prisoner of Jesus amen but on but before he became a prisoner of Jesus he denied Jesus amen because they're three times and they said oh you didn't with jeez no he said I don't know what don't know no there are those that would deny william branham that's right walk away from there denied those that would and brother and deny the revelation of the word that revelations word 39 Jesus were they doing they're doing they're rejecting Jesus amen the grace of God brother let's let's be sincere and understand what it means to reject Jesus oh well I believe Jesus was the Messiah I believe Jesus too came and did this and did that yes so does the devil but what about believing what Jesus yes has come to do who believes that Jesus is here who believes Jesus has come he should descend from heaven with a shout the voice of the Archangel the Trump of God he descended in the opening of the word revealing the mystery and become one with the bride the fullness of the Godhead bodily is in the bright it's not in that body called Jesus no no it's like I asked a preacher I said where is the body of Jesus I was shocked when I got the answer I thought that he would know better oh he said the body of Jesus always said I guess he said he went out to the desert and dropped it in the desert what dropped it in the desert yeah but the problem God said he ascended up in that body and he said that bodies at the right hand of the through of the throne of God and he said the life that was in the body the Holy Ghost Christ and now he's come back into the bride a man I was shocked at that a brother so much older than I am and yet back then he didn't the revelation of where the body of Jesus was amazing thank God for the opening of the of the mystery of God any man but the Bible tells us he didn't drop it in the desert the Bible says that in in in in the book of Acts there says he ascended up into the integrand of cloud him in the Angels and only that the the Old Testament Saints that were dead in Christ amen that laid down their lives they ascended with him and they were the ones they were crying out in River in the book of Revelation they were they cried out open up the gates well over the gates let the King of glory come in who is the king of glory he is the Lord strong and mighty mighty in battle he's fought the good fight and he overcome the world the flesh the devil amen open up the city there in the book of Rundlett Psalms rather a man so brother let's make sure we got the gate open Christ in us amen that we are prisoners of Jesus Christ amen not of a church none of a doctor not a william branham we're prisoners of Christ amen by the grace of Almighty God he made turn with me to Isaiah chapter 58 oh my Isaiah 58 a man you're here because you're a prisoner of Jesus not a prisoner just of the word of the message doctrines you're president of Jesus not a prisoner of this church but a prisoner of Jesus brother I'll share some scripture with you to show you what God experiences what God witnesses in those that he calls in those that he reveals himself to a man oh brother sister I trust were elect I trust we're bright Alleluia I trust we heard the fullness of the Godhead bodily just tremendous revelation to have what me I'll tell you it'll do one thing it'll humble you any man it'll certainly humble you to think that God came and did this for me and God is doing this in me yes Almighty God most think I saved so I got no worries now but they're not humble oh I'm saved yeah wait you say for where you going and wanted to save you what's he doing now oh brother sisters there got to be a personal relationship with Jesus again it's not me that lives it's Christ that liveth in me well what a Paul I believe yeah Paul Paul could say he was the prisoner of jesus he could say and he was dead to himself he was no longer putting the emphasis on it on what he wanted and there's not natural things you've put more and more emphasis on Jesus on God on the word and on the bright but most are still putting the emphasis on there now every day now they love it I tell you they love the natural things more than the spiritual oh and they love this and they love that I want to do this I want to do this and so is that what Jesus wants you to do now if he wants to do it fine but you did you consult the Lord first well what's it your natural instinct the cause you do this cause you do that grace brother you know Isaiah chapter 58 he said cry aloud that's why you're here brother Journal crying loud you know a lot would like for me to be quiet cry aloud and spare not oh lift up thy voice like a trumpet and show my people their transgression and the house of Jacob their sins oh they're called of God they're the elect of God yeah but they need to be reminded of their troubles and they're so there's their sins and so on to Humble himself in the presence of God amen yet they seek me daily and delight to know my ways as a nation that did righteousness and forsook not the ordinance of their God they asked him the ordinances of justice and take did they take delight in approaching to God but we have read another scripture to show you what they do after when it becomes a form of godliness - oh yeah wherefore he said have we fasted yea say they and thou see us not wherefore have we afflicted our soul and thou take us no knowledge behold in the day of your fast she find pleasure and exact all your Labor's and that's why that those feathered in a certain place there and trying to put the emphasis on this brother oh fast and pray fast and pray oh they're giving themselves the glory not God but I told the brother I said brother no I said listen the prophet of God said to the sister that came in the in the prayer line and she was healed God healer always his sister he said oh I see he says you were fasting but he said that's not what healed you he says your faith you do amen so they think if I fast got to do this if I fast got to do that no no no not my real father don't be done I believe your word Lord anyway they're coming down to that time of absolute complete faith believing what God has really a man and he said be all in the day of your fast he find pleasure and exact uh for all your Labor's be o ye fast for strife and debate and to smite with the fist of wickedness ye shall not fast as you do this me to make your voice to be heard on I yeah God wants you to believe his word that he reveals to you it is such effects that I have this is it such a fast that I have chosen a day for a man to afflicted soul is a to bow down his head as a bulrush and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him he said well they call this a fat an acceptable day to the Lord is not this the fast that I have chosen a man as to it God God wants us to do a man he said to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens he said let the oppressed go free that you break every yoke a man president be the name poor brother this is what God wants us to do believe his word live with the word stay with the word be a prisoner to the word a man and if you're a prisoner in a natural prison you you you do everything according to the rules of that prison a man to a brother you're a prisoner of Jesus they're going to do everything according to the will of God not my will thing be done I'm a prisoner in Jesus so I'm only going to do what you want more amen so he said is it not to do they bread to the hungry and that they'll bring the poor that are cast out to thy house and when thou seest the naked he said that they'll cover him amen I got a lot a needle in my eye preached on some time ago going to hell not because of what you did because of what you didn't do and Jesus said in as much you didn't do it to the least of my brother and you didn't do it to me he said apart from me into everlasting fire amen brother oh we think I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do that brother through what you're doing for one another is what God sees is your heart reaching out to this one reaching out to that one that's what God sees he said because why the heart of God reached out to you now regarding you you know to others oh yeah to your brothers and sisters in the faith and not only that when as I said when I'm go here go there and I see this but I say oh god I said I have mercy please I said Lord you had mercy for me you had grace for me I pray for grace for them exactly and he said let the oppressed go free that you break every yoke is it not to deal they bridge hungry and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house and he said when thou seest the naked and he said that thou cover him that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh and then shall they light break forth as the morning and idelle he said shall spring forth speedily and thy righteousness shall go before thee the glory of the Lord shall be thy reward amen and then shalt thou call and the Lord shall answer amen praise the Lord hallelujah want God to answer you well let's see what you're doing if he has an answer maybe because of what you're not doing hey man he wants you to do this he wasn't in any way and it'll get his attention for sure and he'll see you and he'll bless you amen he'll reward you nothing oh Lord I believe you so I want you to reward me well going short go and show me that you believe me go and show the world that you believe me reflect me amen reflect the word grace grace grace so thou shalt call and I and the looker answer thou shalt cry and he shall say Here I am if they take away from the midst of thee the yoke the putting forth of the finger and speaking vanity amen they speak the Word of God by the will of God by the grace of God amen your conversation reflects Jesus your life reflects Jesus your spirit your attitude your motives and rejected ziz reflecting Jesus amen as you're a prisoner of Jesus make sure you're a prisoner of Jesus there's too many a prisoner of the devil just like eat amen and remember again that he only in the in the Garden of Eden he only took me only added one word and believers run this message Kaneko I believe this I believe that yeah but they'll add one word or they'll take away one word oh well I can do this God won't mine oh that's where they use the excreting the excuse god is good he's good all right they look for that he's wants to reflect that goodness in you amen are you good oh we had the goodness of God we have the goodness of the Holy Ghost the goodness of Jesus and he wants to reflect that in you just think are you a prisoner of jesus you are yours like the life of jesus amen are you reflecting the life of Jesus are you reflecting the Spirit of Jesus you know attitude you know his motives objectives is that being reflected in in the life that you live every day not just on one Sunday and Wednesday grace of God to his brother that's the only ones that are going in a rapture those who said what it's not them living is Christ living in them and that's why they're going in the rapture that's why that yeah that's why the dead in Christ the props that are waiting on us why because the Jesus said I am the resurrection hallelujah and if we are one with Christ I am the resurrection a man that's why the dead in Christ is waiting on a stick em what for to come to that absolute complete faith and brother nothing's gonna hold him back they're gonna step out of that dimension into this dimension why because oh the resurrection of rapture is in the bride there so we're going Oh we're gonna step in and greet the living Saints yeah and we're gonna be caught up with them to meet the Lord in the air how many really really really seriously consider resurrection rapture in faith what it means so whole brother IIIi don't smoke and I don't drink so what there's a lot of there don't smoke and drink yeah there's more to it than that they got it born and not not reflect that kind of a life reflect Jesus because remember John didn't smoke John didn't drink but they call Jesus a wine-bibber well Jesus did this Jesus did that but John wouldn't do this John wouldn't do that there's things that John what John wouldn't eat John wouldn't do so on they meant but Jesus come and did it I am and John wouldn't fellowship maybe with this person or that person Jesus would fellowship with this one tells you with that one or will they condemn them for for just giving attention to this one that one oh my why because there was a spirit of redemption hallelujah amen despair redemption in the am a spirit of redemption in the bride's spirit emption in you a we want to be a witness we don't know who seduces predestinated seat we don't know who spiked of God so we want to be a witness amen and we want to encourage those people you know to believe God and to trust the Lord even though it may not be bright the prophet of God so we won't get this message to everyone in the world but only the elect the bride but yet he said the testimony of Jesus is going to go to the whole world amen sure let's reflect Jesus to the world fact Jesus to those that family and friends and neighbors yes brother they've not seen you seen Jesus in you not is not yet not religion in control is Jesus in control and will give the glory to Jesus thanks hello his love please in the name of Jesus have mercy grace so he say then shalt thou call if you're going to give him the preeminence when it comes to fasting brother it's not natural fasting that God's looking for this fast from the things of the world and the things other were not necessarily food but I'll tell he he's looking for an absolute no no ending pastor the world and the things of the world alleluia alleluia alleluia any man so what you're putting the emphasis on God and the things of God and the Word of God and God's food in his reveal word praise the Lord okay here's another oh yeah turn with me to Ezekiel chapter 2 Ezekiel chapter 2 and I highlighted to our brother David to the day concern Ezekiel chapter 1 and right here you want to see this in the Bible go to the zeeco chapter 1 amen and it describes all this here right here and of course to those that are familiar with this picture of course the Prophet said he said he said you see me behind the pulpit he said I'm not he said I'm up here and he is he's right there you can see him yeah it's amazing that the problem was aware of this and he said you think I'll maybe I'm the Pope but I not ease that I'm up what he's up higher yeah by the grace of God and he said I'm up there looking down on the congregation and here in the Book of Ezekiel he explains the glory of God a man and his Inc your chapter to see us all the word brothers sister thank God his Eco chapter 2 beginning to read at verse 3 and he said unto me son of man I send thee to the tournament of Israel to a rebellious nation and observe an hour that were ministering and living in a rebellious world it says our yeah he said that has rebelled against me and they rebelled against God they and their fathers have transgressed against me then on to this very day he said for they are impudent children and Steph arted I do send thee unto them and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the Lord God and they whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for they are a rebellious house yet shall know that there had been a prophet among them a man and thou son a man be not afraid of them brother ever ever an hour that the ministry needs to take on to this revelation we needed don't be afraid of the people no and yet there a ministry and brethren that are afraid yeah they're more afraid the people in there of God yeah and those son of man be not afraid of them neither be afraid of their words he said though briars and thorns be with thee thou does dwell among scorpions be not afraid of their words nor be dismayed at their looks though they be a rebellious house and he's talking about Israel yeah and he said thou shall speak my words unto them whether they will hear whether they will forbear for they are most rebellious but not but thou son a man hear what I say unto thee be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house he said open they move and eat that I give thee a man eat the word that you're hearing today eat the word a man and when I looked behold and hand was sent unto me and lo a roll of a book was therein and he spread it before me and it was written within and without and he said there was written therein he said lamentations morning and wool and brother the Prophet preached lamentations morning in wool to get us out of the churches and into the bright God is getting preaching lamentations the morning in wool to get us out of time and into eternity a man and there's one more scripture Psalms 106 it's been a long time since I have read this one I shared it with the beat Saints Amen still never got to the message on Paul a prisoner will see and the brethren can the brothers kind of keep me informed two cuts only to weather ok thank you amen Psalms 106 and beginning to read at verse 1 pay attention to the word a man praise ye the Lord all give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever a man who can utterly utter the mighty acts of the Lord who can show forth all his praise he said blessed are they that keep judgment and he that doeth righteousness at all times God help us remember me O Lord with the favor that thou bear'st unto thy people or visit me with thy salvation that I may see the good of thy chosen that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation that I may glory with Dyne inheritance have sinned with our fathers we have committed iniquity we have done wickedly and our fathers understood not they wonders in Egypt a man how many have understood the wonders of Malachi 4 again it's a challenge even to denominational brethren out there and even nondenominational brethren yeah as I said they had that internet site and they said this was william brown ministry when it comes to the signs and wonders and how in the world can we can we reconcile it to his message they didn't understand it how could a man with this kind of a ministry preach this message you know as like again that evangelist and he approached whether Romney said brother Ram stop preaching that yeah that was all Roberts he said brother Ram stop preaching that just just just preach this you know his signs and his wonders and so on and healing and all that but don't go preaching about the what the women should do shouldn't do whatever what the brothers should do and shouldn't do and the prophet of God said well he's her brother he said oh yeah I said the brothers who lit the pastor's to it and he said well if the pastors are not doing he said who was going to do it he said I got to do it oh yeah because again he was ordained with those signs and wonders to get the people to believe believe what believe the word what God was going to reveal a man sir brother they understood not the wonders in Egypt they understood not what God was doing and what what was God doing those things back therefore in the Ministry of winning around the 1st and 2nd pole it was to get bring the bride out of denominational Egyptian bondage provide' God said yeah he said we've been brought out of denominational each bondage Israel's brought out of the politically Egyptian bondage were brought out of spiritual Egyptian bondage a man by what God has done in this hour in this age but there's a generation that didn't understand and the father got even even to concerning the the generation that was believing his message back then and he said he said to one brothers brotherly veil now he said brother veil he said most of the older generation around this message they're going to go before the rapture he said they're going to go on because they won't live to have that rapture in faith a man why they weren't ordained they weren't predestinated onto the rapture so God was going to take them off the scene but they're there now in that dimension waiting on us but he's going to be a generation raised on the scene that will have wrapped repaid and again he said listen he said you young ministers are gonna take this message on to the coming of the Lord and we're trying to preach the coming of the Lord that he has come amen as the Provost said it's not me it's that other angel it's Christ hey man you remember and the Bible says he went up in a cloud and the Bible says that the angel said he's going to come back in a cloud you'll come as you have seen him go well there's a cloud of angels and he came in a cloud of angels and again as I said come near nearing the end of his ministry the parlor God preached and he says see he said there he is he said he's looking down on us amen and he is as I said brother it's a witness to the world know Jesus now but back back back in 1963 in 64 brother these things were printed in in in worldwide magazines the picture this picture and that one yeah and as I said if you if you ever got the magazine and you saw behind this one what's behind it it is a rainbow at midnight in Mexico midnight a rainbow yeah and they published that picture and then next beyond it on the other side they published this picture and they said all it's a mystery they said it's not a ray it's not a plane it's not a jet because it's too high did they express how high it was and so on and so on how big it was well thank God that we got the revelation amen that we God have us that will by reverence respected what there he is looking down at us as I said most people just see this what's it gonna be like when we see him really got the revelation of Jesus the Prophet God's that I want introduce the bride to Jesus and he said then he said I want to get on my knees and crawl up to his feet what do we want to do because we considered that he saved us and he's now working in us to a mayor to work out the old nature to work in the new praise the Lord says verse 7 our fathers understood not they wonders in Egypt this generation didn't understand what God was really doing in the first and second pull of the province ministry not understanding what he was really doing in the opening of the seven seals the mystery of God what for oh yeah the mystery of God's revealed down but what was heard is it or is it complem what he wanted to accomplish and that is to give us rapturing hey grace he said they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies but provoked him at the rate at the sea even at the Red Sea don't provoke him don't provoke God with our on with unbelief let's believe God this please God and he said nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake our Lord Jesus Christ he said that he might make his mighty mighty power to be known he rebuked the Red Sea also and it was dried up so he led them through the depths as through the wilderness you think they would believe God to glean and possess the promised land concerning what he did in Egypt considering what he did at the Red Sea considering the pen of that fell down and he fed them their signs and the wonders and the miracles no they still didn't believe and he said he led them through the dead says through the wilderness and he saved them from the hand the hand of him that hated them and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy but they turned down his Redemption please let's not refuse his Redemption let's not refuse the revelation of the Resurrection and the rapture brother as the Lutheran's put emphasis on justification justification by faith justification and sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost from Pentecost and the gifts oh my I was a part of that oh yeah I was in the in Pentecost over fifty years ago it's quite different now but this the emphasis was on the baptism the baptism yeah any went out after the service and they all went up around the altar and they were down on their knees praying and I was one of them one time and and I remember brethren coming over and over to this one over though that one over this one that went over to me and laying hands on me Lord filled with the Holy Ghost that's what they were praying Lord filled my brother with the Holy Ghost in the name of Jesus Christ and so on but they were looking for a sign of the speaking in tongues yeah I remember when God filming with the Holy horse but it wasn't then yeah it was we got filled with the Holy Ghost it was I was in the bedroom in the house praying and anointing struck me and I got up I stood up and I walked out into added the bedroom into the hallway upstairs and I praised the Lord hallelujah hallelujah amen and I said well Lord thank you for the Holy Ghost thank you for the Holy Ghost save man and brother it was different ever since Amen praise the name of the Lord so brother let's make sure you got the baptism of the Holy that brings you into the word makes you in the word one a man and the batch of the Holy Ghost a man brings us to the revelation of the resurrection and the rapture a man Braves got his Christ in us and what's he doing what's he want to do he wants to get out of here how long shall I be with you oh I trust were gone beyond that to the revelation I'm no more in the world we're on our way out we're on our way home don't put the emphasis on the foolishness of this world by dams on the spiritual all right that's the ones that are going in the rapture that's the ones they're gonna be taken out of here that are just spiritual talking about the Lord but love the Lord the resurrection the rapture and brother your humbling and thirsting for the saints that are gone on how many of us are hungry on thirsty persister coffee I made so hungry and thirsty for fellowship with sister Dunford brother sister burns yeah and other saints probably God said he even said that in the natural he said in the natural he said when you begin to when you're thinking about those that are gone on he said your Lord is gonna take you soon well if in this hour and the resurrection of rapture age if we're thinking about those that have gone on and we're hungry and thirsty for fellowship with them again oh we've missed it nor we miss it oh think it's gonna it's gonna bring the resurrection you're gonna bring the rapture you got to be you got to want it not just and this is what Jesus wanted Martha they do have that anointing in her life that she would want the resurrection she would want the rapture by the grace of God there's be sensitive to it in verse 9 he said he rebuked the Red Sea also and it was dried up so he led them through the depths as for the wilderness and he saved them from the hand of him that aided them and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy and the waters covered their enemies and there was not one of them left then verse 12 notice verse 12 then believe they is words they saying is praise miss tremendous but the next verse is tremendous they believe those words as saying his praise verse 13 they soon forgot is yeah they waited not for his counsel now it's a generation that believed and paying praises to the Lord for what he's done in this hour but it got to the place where they have forgotten his works amen and they waitin up for his counsel I know because I have meet meet believers meet believers meet believers I said lord I say things are going in the rapture oh I believe the message but I said they said they believe the message intellectually and in their heads but I said they're going off and they're like their lives are not reflecting it I said they're not prisoners of Jesus then our prisoners of the world if you're a prisoner of the word you're controlled by the word your prisoner of Jesus are controlled by Jesus amen again I said the poverties bringing out in this message Paul a prisoner he said Paul recognize himself not as just a prisoner of of the government or the prisoner of Rome and whatever was no he's a prisoner of Jesus yeah and he said he had he had a friend there's also a fellow prisoner not just in in in the in a jail but in the word a man controlled by the word so the prophet of God is and may praise the Lord as I told you the last time right sermon I preached I said I was shocked had the number of times that william branham mentioned about a prisoner of christ after he preached that message in these two messages right here and when we would get to it and it says christ the mystery of god revealed and perfect faith and again perfect faith and in price christ a mystery of god revealed it is among the fewer messages that he was preaching after the seals and the revelations that he wanted us to get after the opening the seals because remember after 1963 he went back into evangelism amen so brother though was going in the rapture will be prisoners of the revelation absolutely controlled and governed by the revelation listen in verse 13 they soon forget is works they waited not for his counsel and brother there's a generation of believers now they have forgotten the works of God and they're not waiting for God's counsel oh I just believe this doctrine this doctrine that doctrine yeah I believe the message I said Lord I said they're not believers that's not reflecting the message they're not reflecting Christ ice to reflect in religion reflecting theology intellectually but spiritually on every day s not in their everyday lives oh just because the woman you know she got along really day she got to getting good clothes every day yeah or the prophet of God said it can be dead works it was not faith he said it's a dead work you go get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and it's not faith it's dead work God yes god help us we're going by faith not by sight not by the intellectual word but by the spiritual revelation in our hearts amen that the word control you and that your life reflect Christ and it says they soon forgot his works and they waited not for his counsel please wait on the Lord for his counsel through the Ministry of the word oh well I don't have to do that I don't have to do no you don't have to us your choice but if you're born again you will a man and he said but lust they lusted exceedingly in the wilderness as a generation is lusting after the world and the things of the world or they love this world I don't I hate it I want to get ahead here as Jesus did I want to get out of here why because Jesus was this nature Jesus was saying yeah yeah that that anointing and so on it on why and you you you know he had this thought and these thoughts and he he thirsted for righteousness yeah he said remember he was in heaven he said no man has ascended up he that came down he said even the son of man who is in heaven Harry was there but he was also in heaven why because he came through his siapa knee in flesh we bypass but we're going back to it North theophanies was pulling on us for the resurrection the rapture and getting us to a glorified body amen so finally Jesus got to that place the third pole finished I finished oh yeah they would they were wondering about Jesus worrying about his ministry wondering about his attitude Idzik what's what's going on he was getting at a time and he was more conscious of eternity he was going home and he said but that generation of the Jews back there said lusted exceedingly in the wilderness and tempted God in the desert he got to the place where they said Oh a bit better if we let we were still in Egypt what if you're prisoners of God prisoners of the word your thank ghost be thankful what you're where you're experiencing God is look at what God did in Egypt look what he didn't bring in you out of Egypt look what he did in in in the wilderness providing you a man and providing you with this providing you with that even even you wanted water and rock and host Moses struck the rock and he they made him mad because of because he was a because of their unbelief and the finally God says speak to the rock but Moses struck it why because of the people there on belief amen they lusted exceedingly in the wilderness tempted God in the desert and he gave them their requests but sent leanness into their soul as a generation amen they got this they got that ecology with its kind of bless you with that but what about your soul it's better not better not to have that and to be blessed in your soul amen by the grace of Almighty God God Elpis the confirmation that we are prisoners of Jesus I'll add the finish why I just started how for starters the preaching of only preach one amazing well thank God listen he said I'll repeat these quotes cuz them in a while and maybe forget them he said always he said don't judge her life by how much power you have to perform miracles he said we don't judge ourselves by how much knowledge you have of the word but always judge herself he said look back and take an inventory of what kind of a fruit that the life you presently live is now buried exactly that's right so what's the fruits are bearing is it fresh fruit amen you're supposed to have fresh fruit amen and I say that we too often like a mirror reflecting something he said our life is reflected and now if we lived in the days of Noah whose side would we take what side would we have to taken in those days that Noah lived what side were we have taken in the days of Moses was sight in the days of Elijah the prophet when all the world was gulped up in great mass of modernism yeah it said they envied Moses and Aaron the saint of the Lord amen but they still they envied them why because of the faith that that they had you know and Joshua and Caleb and so on oh my what faith didn't matter to them you know concerning what was going into the Promised Land what they had priced they had to pay the sacrifice the well if God be for us who can be against us but the rest of the Jews forgot what God had done amen brother there's a lot of lot of believers have forgotten and God is past tense not present tense God did this but they don't have the revelation of what God is doing oh yeah and you and I said you can be all right strict when it comes to I'm a believer and I dress like this and I don't do this and I don't do that yeah but and again the sisters dress this way and that way yeah but but is the resurrection living in you it's the rapture in you is you're hungry and thirsting for more and more and more and more of for eternity god help us you know I I'm that's that's very discouraging to see so many believers yeah but they're only intellectual believers oh yeah they want and they they're not there to deny this or deny that or do you know the this doctor that died home yeah we don't go along with denominations and all that well God is still out there God still working on some of those out there in denominations oh yeah there's foolish virgins and so on there's wise virgins oh yes and some that some of those in there out there in denomination they rise in judgment against those that not in denomination they will yeah god help us so what what side would you take in the days of Moses did you char Israel coming out of Egypt they never stayed with Moses no God judge them in the wilderness brother what to what side would you take in the days of Elijah or Elijah brother like Elijah was reserved was a raptured yeah and even even the the other priesthood in Israel they came down to the sea when Elijah walked across where's Elijah oh he went over there they went over there looking for him couldn't find him couldn't find no graves no nothing you rapture me you mean he was caught up into theophanies of fire Chariots of Fire theophanies of fire by the grace of God and brother they're there waiting for us to be cut off amen he's been now in the days of the Lord Jesus what side would you have taken your life that you live now reflects just what you would have done then because you still are possessed with the same spirit so what what's why would you take when if Jesus when Jesus was there physically on earth and he's here now in the bright sea the devil never takes his spirit he just goes off from one man to another God never takes his spirit either it goes from one to another so the very spirit that was um Elijah came on Elijah and the one on John the Baptist and so forth the Holy Spirit was upon Christ came upon the disciples so God never takes his spirit so he said there we are left to make a choice I can't see where here where Paul was regretting anything and saying he was sorry he was a prisoner but he was addressing himself I believe that Paul as he wrote this letter with the pen that it was the Holy Spirit causing him to write it that they maybe even to this night that we might call out the context of our texts to show why Paul did this and I believe that sitting in this dingy old jail Paul calling here that his brother that he was a prisoner of Jesus Christ he could express it by seeing what was around him now he was in jail but that wasn't what Paul was speaking to his servant of Christ he said he was speaking that he was a prisoner to the word of Jesus Christ because Christ is the word amen god help us we become prisoners to the word prisoners to Jesus finally he said Oh God make us prisoners from our own selfish ambitions from our own judgment amen amen praise the Lord make us prisoners from our own selfish ambitions from our own judgements and our own what we think better way of thinking he said to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ amen I think he said that was a great statement that I'm a prisoner to Jesus Christ amen and brother Brennan makes it personal with Brenham tabernacle that they need to become prisoners of Christ god help us this best stop there so brother sister don't reject Jesus by not allowing him to become the control of your life and refusing to become his prisoner amen God's grace to us is prayer you'll get to it again more concerning the quotes in that message and the other messages so the Lord bless you amen let's stand my father's house come and go with me to my father's prison amen amen to my father's house where there is peace
