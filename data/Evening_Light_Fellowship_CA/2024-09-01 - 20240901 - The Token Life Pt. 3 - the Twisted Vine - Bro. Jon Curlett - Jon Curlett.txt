certainly our prayer this morning Lord that as in the beginning Lord your spirit hovered over the Earth Lord and it created an atmosphere for Life Lord so it would do the very same same thing over us Heavenly Father Lord not that your spirit would just hover over us Lord but that it would be inside of us Lord that it would fill us and refill us day by day Lord even to an overflowing Lord that it would produce the very life that you placed inside of us Lord and that life would take dominion over everything else that comes against us Lord that which is within us that which is without us Heavenly Father Lord that your spirit would raise up a standard Lord that's anchored in the word Lord that it would produce a Faith Lord that helps us to believe and accept Lord and in those things to receive Lord what you promised us Lord I pray you Quicken our faith Lord help us to look to you and only to you Lord you are our savior you're Our Redeemer Lord You're our healer our provider Lord our guide Our Shepherd Lord may we recognize every day Lord where our help comes from Lord speak to your people now we ask in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Genesis chapter 5 I'm sorry if I look angry this morning I've got another eye infection and seems like it's about to kind of move towards lessening rather than worsening but uh I I look a little mean this morning I know I startled myself when I looked in the mirror so anyways I I'm not preaching an angry service this morning so hopefully we'll be okay with it but just I do crave your prayers I've got to travel next week I'll be leaving on Sunday after noon after I preach in the morning for Montreal for work and then from there I'm flying to Edmonton I'll preach two services for brother Ed hammermeister while I'm there so I'm prepping for that this week prepping for work and then I'll spend some time with my dad and mom and some of the other believers there and whatnot so just pray that God will be with me in the meantime brother Mark will take the Wednesday service after I leave brother Carmen Mills from New Brunswick will take the Sunday brother Paul will take the Wednesday after that and then brother Max Bang from Edmonton will take the Sunday after that so we have speakers for all four Services amen and we thank the Lord for that amen trusting you'll you'll enjoy them we also want to remember the kids as they head back to school this week now many of us are still work schooling from home some are going back to schools and we just want the Lord to be with them amen that he would make them a witness that like Daniel they would stand tall that they would push back and in the areas where Satan would try and get in and that they be a witness and testimony not just to the children but to the teachers as well amen God bless you each one amen let's uh let's read from Genesis 5 and verse 1 says this is the book of the gener generations of Adam in the day that God created man in the likeness of God made he him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Adam in the day when they were created amen God bless you you can have your seats and we're continuing our series on the Holy Ghost again the token life I want to take a title this morning of the Twisted Vine and we started this series uh and I spoke to services on the original sin and I trust we've got that clearly settled in scripture you know talking with some people yesterday I said that's a generational set of services you don't preach it all the time we don't need to do it but when we're talking about the Holy Ghost I know it seems an odd way to start a service on the Holy Ghost and we start talking about the original sin but if we don't understand why we need the holy ghost in the first place then we often won't understand what the Holy Ghost has given for and on that basis we don't understand what the Holy Ghost is supposed to do and so people come up with all these ideas of what the Holy Ghost is and what the proof of it is but if we see where we lost our nature where we see where we lost our original uh you know uh inheritance and these things then we'll see the Holy Ghost is supposed to bring us back to that and I started with this scripture in Genesis 5 and this is after Adam and Eve have been driven out of the garden after Cain has killed Abel and and now the world is moving forward and even though they're not able to approach God anymore yet they're pressing forward God is looking God's nowhere in their midst amen they can't go to the tree of life anymore and if you look at we we started in Genesis 51 but if you go to Genesis 4 and the last scripture it says in the very last verse of Genesis 4 it says that men began to call on the name of the Lord in other words men began to seek God because something in them was unfulfilled something in them was longing something in them was yearning Adam and Eve would have had the reality of what that felt like they knew what it meant to be in the presence of God but now as they have children and those children have children and whatnot there's a longing inside of these of these these men and these women these young people whatever it might be and there's something unfulfilled and so they're starting to cry out to God because they realize there's something missing in their life they don't have it they don't know what it looks like except Adam and Eve but they know that there's something there and they're crying out for it amen and the problem is and the prophet covers this extensively if we don't find what we're looking for then what does Satan do he tries to fill that hole with something else amen and there's a holy thirst there's an eternal thirst for the child of God and if we don't satisfy it properly it shifts to the Natural it shifts shifts to the Earthly it shifts to the intellectual it shifts to religion rather than Christ it'll shift to the pleasures and the the enjoyments of the world it'll shift to drugs and alcohol sometimes it's sensuality and physical lust whatever it might be but if we can't satisfy that thirst in the way it's meant to be then Satan will take it and he'll manipulate it to make us try and satisfi it another way and that's the way Satan does remember he can't do it himself so he tries and twists and manipulate and make God's things into something that's impure the prophet of God says it this way he says but you'll never be s Saied until you know him but watch how he says this now as the Forgiveness of your sins where the sin question is settled and you have that lovely peaceful quiet Eternal Everlasting fellowship with him see the world will stop right there and say your sins are forgiven you're good to go he says no no no that's not the satisfying of your soul that's the satisfying of the debt but your soul is not satisfied with the debt because it's longing for relationship it's it's it's longing for fellowship and so he says you won't stop until you have Fellowship now with him not just forgiveness of sins he says when the peace of God that passes all understanding has Sanctified your soul and has made you a new creature in Christ Jesus he says joining Church won't do it no sir that's only perverting the real cause now how do you preach that today that joining church is perverting the real cause it's not joining church that perverts it's it's if you are satisfied with joining Church that it perverts the real cause the real thirst there the real hunger he says if the devil can't get you out on those things he'll take you to this other what if he can't get you with the things of the world then he'll take you to a church experience take you to a religious experience and see if you'll be satisfied with that he says but don't settle for nothing less than an oldfashioned experience of the new birth to be go Born Again of the spirit of the Eternal God when your soul and God you unite together and you become one amen that's what we're looking for this morning we're not satisfied with the church experience let me say this way we're not satisfied with a message experience amen it has to be a personal revealing of Christ not only to you but in your life where he changes you from what you used to be to what you were supposed to be and that's a work of the Holy Spirit by the washing of the water of the word amen so if we come back to Genesis 5 and God is doing a recap of kind of what's happened so far and it says this this is the book of the generations of Adam and in the day that God created man in the likeness of God God made he him singular now let me stop and say this okay if Adam is created in the likeness of God how many people did God create on that day Adam is in the perfect image of God and how many people did he create one right there is one Spirit Adam was Spirit first and then God creates a body and puts the spirit into that body and it's an exact and perfect image of God when you see Adam you see God in terms of the likeness okay it amazes me that somebody can preach a trinity and when we look at the first image of God it is a singularity it's only one but we'll see now that it's not one in the way that they preach Oneness either and we'll see it in the very next scripture amen but if you want to preach the Trinity you have to preach from Adam because Adam is in the image of God if God is a trinity then Adam has to be a trinity in the way that God is but we watch what happens now in verse two he says male and female created he them so now there's a separation that's happening there's one body there's one Spirit but out of that one body and spirit he pulls bone of his bone he pulls flesh of his flesh he pulls Spirit of his spirit and what does he produce he produces another portion of what was in Adam already and he manifest ested in a second body so now you have two same flesh Same Spirit same DNA same origin but now it's in two he says he created them male and female and blessed them and called their name Adam in the day when they were created notice called their name Adam we've spoken on this before that Eve had no name until after the fall before that he is man and she is woman and their name is Adam we would say today Mr and Mrs Adam that's what we would say they're exactly the one thing Adam is a Son of God and and and the woman is a daughter of God but they are bone of bone and flesh of his flesh there is no difference between their origin in that sense and what is it showing it's showing God and his family Adam's in the perfect likeness of God so what God is taking out of Adam is no different than what God is going to take out of himself God is showing the family that was in him from before the foundation of the world that there was something in his body there was something in his Spirit there was something that was in him before anything was ever manifested and then what does he do is he pulls out of his own body a bride for himself that's why we can look in the scriptures and we can see that there is more to God than just Oneness because there's not just one Spirit but there's people that are born of that spirit that are inside that that are coming out if you want to look at it today find how many people have the Holy Ghost and that's how many gods you have because that's all a portion of God so it's not a trinity either but neither is it a Oneness like your finger there's something inside of it and out of that Oneness comes manifestations comes bodies comes portions of God that are his thoughts that are his attributes and that's you and I amen so that's the that's just a foreshadow of why we're going to have why we get the Holy Ghost and where it comes from and these different things but the simple fact is if we weren't in him then we can't be in him now amen break what is what is put back into his body is what was brought out of his body in the first place and it's a bride that's bone of his bone and flesh of his flesh you can't be a part of him in the future if you aren't a part of him in the past in the very beginning now Genesis 5 continues the genealogy of Adam for the sake of time this morning we won't read it uh but there is no mention of Cain in the genealogy of Adam it mentions Abel it mentions Seth and it goes on down the line but but uh we see in Genesis 4 Cain's genealogy is clearly given and his father is never listed as Adam amen but we see in Kane's genealogy it starts to go through there and we see what kind of people came from his line and we see that the fifth generation is lamech and he is a and he's a murderer you don't see murderers in Adam's side you only see them in Cain's side we see that lamech is a murderer but we see that all of the great skill and all of the great intelligence is found in Cain's line it's not necessarily found in Adam's line they have an elevated understanding of how to take materials and manipulate them and turn them into things that would help them on this Earth and then we come to Genesis 6 and I want to see something as we're speaking this morning on the Twisted Vine because we're talking about the impact of the original sin and how we're why we're so broken and messed up today in these fleshly bodies it says now in Genesis 6 it says it came to pass when man began to multiply on the face of the Earth and daughters were born unto them that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose so we see here two completely different lineages two completely different Family Lines we have the sons of God and we know who they are we better know who they are because sons of God produce sons of God if you go all the way up to Luke 3:38 it says who was the son of Enoch who was the son of Seth who was the son of Adam which was the son of God so the sons of God in Genesis is the physical line of Adam sons of God produce sons of God Amen because they came from a father who was a Son of God and even in a fallen condition Hallelujah even in a fallen condition they are sons of God I say praise the Lord this morning even in our fallen condition it doesn't change our inheritance it doesn't change who our father is amen but then there's another family line and it's the sons of men and the daughters of men and there's a distinction made in scripture now between these two groups they are not the same family line amen they're different Family Lines Adam and Eve produced Abel who Cain killed and then they produced Seth who Eve said was a replacement for Abel from God and Adam and Eve's family grew from there and they would have sons and daughters alike now the scripture doesn't tell us the daughters that's not the way the scripture traditionally Works they quote Sons most of the time but they would have had daughters but we notice now that Cain was not their child Cain was Eve's child by the serpent we know that we spent two Services going over that Cain is never mentioned as Adam's son he's in no genealogies he that are connected to Adam he has nothing to do with Adam he only has to do with Eve and though we covered this last service the last few Services I want to this is really to me the clinching s uh uh statement of what where he of where Cain came from and it says for this is the message that you heard from the beginning that we should love one another not as Cain who was of that Wicked one amen his father was the Wicked one Adam was not the wicked one Adam was the son of God says who was of that Wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him why did he kill him because his own Works were evil and his brothers righteous so we see that the works of Cain's line are evil and the works of Adam's line are righteous sons of God Sons of men sons of men are serpent seed and sons of God are God's original plan and and line through Adam and Eve so Cain's line is called the son of man and they produce daughters but I want you to consider something now how does Cain get a wife well there's only one family that can produce and that's Adam and Eve so Adam and Eve produce Sons but they also produce daughters and so in order for Cain to get a wife now we have to look at this a little bit differently okay in the scriptures in the early days it was not a problem to marry your sister or your half sister Abraham married his half sister Isaac married a distant relative it wasn't an issue early on but what we see here is that Cain had to get a wife from Eve and Adam but you have to realize that Cain has been separated he's got a mark put on him he's been shut out from that from that family line and so how does Cain have to get a wife he has to do what his daddy did and he has to go and seduce and he has to go and beguile a a a a Believer into thinking that he's not that bad he didn't all those things or he had good reasons for it and he's not cursed of God and he has to go and he has to seduce this woman away from the truth of the word of God and bring her to his way of thinking so that he can make her his wife what's he doing he's doing exactly what his daddy did he's doing exactly what his daddy did the works of your father you shall do and he's doing the works of the serpent Satan through the serpent amen and so Cain would have to be just like his father and his father would have been handsome he would have been a good talk ER big strong attractive and we'll see that by the scriptures as we go through and so what does Cain produce now he produces people just like his daddy that's what he does he produces big beautiful strong smart wise in the things of the world a group of people and what happens is these these sons of God now start to see the beauty of the Serpent's line it's a hybrid but it's a beautiful thing it's a beautiful thing and they see these beautiful women and they get snared by one thing the appearance what got Eve first the appearance and then she tasted and saw that what she thought was good actually was good and these are the same things that happens to the sons of God they stopped staying they stopped looking where God told them to stay and they start looking over the fence to see what's out there and pretty soon some beautiful woman walks by they say hey I like that and they took it says as many of them as they wanted Genesis 62 says the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair that they were beautiful and they took them wives of all which they chose so now the sons of God supposed to be separate sons of men were separated now they're coming together and now we have a mixed race amen we have Cain's line Half Son of God half son of the serpent then we have Adam's line which is fully sons of God and as soon as they mix it causes a blending of not only their physical traits but their Natures amen and so now two family characteristics SS two natures and it puts Humanity into a hybrid Fallen condition there's two clear families but now they start to blend and God has a problem with that and we'll see that he jumps in to reduce the impact but when we look at the works of the sons of men versus the sons of God we see that the sons of God were trying to get back and we see the sons of of men are trying to move forward sons of God are saying we need to get back to the tree of life we need to get back to relationship with God we need to get back back to our original condition and the sons of men of of kees line are saying no we need to make life as comfortable as possible we need to make it work here we've got to find a way to manipulate the situation so our lives are more comfortable and the sons of God are calling on the name of the Lord and the sons of men are trying to make the earth work in their favor but it's all cursed amen and don't we see that today everyone in this world is fighting and scrabbling and working as hard as they can and we've got the sons and the daughters of God saying this world is not my home we are pilgrims and strangers I'm headed out of here you can take it you can fight for it I don't want it I'm seeking a kingdom and a city whose Builder and maker is God Amen even in their fallen condition the nature of a Son of God is to come back to God he wants to get back to where he came from he wants to get back to his inheritance he wants to get back to his father he wants to get back to his fellowship and so they're crying out to God God bring us back God make a way and the sons of men are there and they're building great kingdoms and great tools and great instruments and all these different things machines and mechanics and whatnot that's what they're trying to do remember that because the nature of a Son of God is always to go back to God you want to know if you got the Holy Spirit what's it calling you to what's drawing you day by day we'll find that amen Cain's line was interested in moving on and Adam's line was interested in going back to where they came from we have the same spirit and Paul talks about in Galatians he says but when the fullness of time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and listen to this he says because ye are Sons there is no chest there is no trial you have to pass he says because ye are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father The Cry of the holy spirit is to draw us back to God and when we get it then our hands go up and we say God bring me back to you God bring me back to your image God bring me back to your presence God bring me back to your word and it does the work he gives us the spirit to produce what we are in the first place amen but as soon as you mix those two lines what happens the sons of God blend with the sons of man and what takes over not the nature of the sons of God let me tell you that you can't mix anything with God and come out with God and that's what they did and so what happens is it makes them stop calling on the name of the Lord because they're more interested now in the things that have been influenced in their lives by the sons of men it makes them start living and acting like Cain's family line rather than the direction that they were going in the first place and so God comes down and says enough is enough and so in Genesis 6 he says the Lord God and the Lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his days shall be 120 years God sets a timeline here he says mankind has 120 years left he's not setting a limit on their lifespan can't be because Abraham lived 175 Noah goes all the way to 950 he's almost the oldest man in the Bible this is not a limit on the on their lifespan this is a limit on mankind that's why we believe Noah preached 120 years because God always sends a message before judgment so he would have preached from this point on until the floods came 120 years it says now there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that so in pref flood you have Giants and after the flood you have Giants as well when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men and they bear children to them the same became Mighty Men which were of old men of renown so this hybrid line now produces Giants this is the nature of this is not the nature of God coming out now there's no mention of giants when the sons of God stayed within their family line but as soon as they blame with c's line it produces Giants says men of re Renown men of great intellect men of great uh uh reputation these are the biggest and the best and the greatest and the mightiest amen and they are not the sons of God they are the sons of men they're the children of Cain first and foremost which is why I said Cain was big and strong and intelligent and handsome and all of these different things the Mighty Men of this world reflect Cain's line not God's line amen we see this all as we go through the many generations and brother Brian would say this he saysthe seed of the serpent comes along and what does it produce the seed of the serpent produced Cain Cain went to the Land of Nod and produced Giants and then they came to the land of Noah they were smart educated intelligent people they were Builders inventors scientists not through the seed of the righteous but through the seed of Satan the serpent they were such men as scientists Builders Great Men Educators the scripture says so they worked brass they worked and they worked metals they invented things they tempered different metals and built houses and so forth scripture says so and they were scoffers at the seed of the woman Noah the righteous is that right that that to make us stop and consider something because when we realize this the nature that makes us great in the eyes of the world today is the Serpent's nature okay I'm an engineer I'm a scientist I'm a man of logic and region reason I can design things I can make things I can come up with things brother Matt is the same thing brother Matt what makes us great today in the eyes of the world not God it's this it's the Serpent's line that does it it's not that God doesn't have people that are smart or anything but the the the traits that follow the serpent are intellect and reason and the ability to manipulate what we have amen where does intellect lead us Church destruction death that's where that's where it led it led Eve and it's been doing it ever since amen not intellect never leads us to God let me put it that way it never leads us to God and so that tells us where it comes from even today we don't need knowledge we need wisdom right we need Godly knowledge but we need wisdom in how to apply it that's what we're really looking for if we look in first Corinthians it says for you see your calling Brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called remember what did God give God gave his word word Satan gave intellect and reason God gave power and authority by the word Satan gave Power by using your body Satan said I'll put Power into you so you don't need God God says if I give you my power you have all the power you'll ever need but Satan comes and he he takes it it's two completely different Natures at work with completely different results one of them was life and the other one was death and destruction and we can see these results as we look at what happens in in Genesis and it says and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the Earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually Church you blend god with something you don't get more of God you never do you get more of what you Blended in remember we talked I think it was in the the last service how God is light he's pure he's holy he's righteous and when you blend anything in with God you taint it and it's no longer him it's no longer him you can't do that and why does that matter church because we'll see as we go along Cain's line that they tried to blend their ideas their religion into what God was and all it produced was Babel and then it produced idolatry It produced perversion It produced child sacrifice it produce all of these Unholy things amen you can't plan your life with God's ideas you can't do it you have to take one or the other because they're completely contrary one to another and we'll see that as we get later in the service this morning Bram says this he says it's always been the cursed of the Lord hybrid stay away from it hybrid religion don't mix it Jesus said if you have the faith of a mustard seed why did he say like a mustard seed he says mustard won't mix with nothing mustard genuine mustard you aren't Hy breing it it's mustard actually look this up I looked this up because what they might have known in the 50s or something you know you want to see have they ever done it and nobody has been been able to blend mustard seed with something else they can do GMO they can genetically modify it to make it more hearty but they can't blend mustard with something else to produce anything they can keep it producing mustard but they can't blend it you can blend all sorts of other things to produce new new species you can't blend mustard they've got over 3,000 mustard seeds but none of them have been Blended you can't do it and that's what he's saying here he says men that are born of the spirit of God are God's sons of and daughters they're not hybrid they stay with God they stay with his program they stay with his Spirit they don't want any of the hybrid stuff doesn't matter how big and Polished the other churches look how big and Polished the congregation looks how glamorous and what Great Gatherings they have that don't phase them a bit amen we're walking by faith we're not walking by sight we're not trying to please somebody we're not trying to use numbers to get ourselves in that's never a reflection I remember talking with brother Kingsley this week Paul's chur Church in Ephesus had 12 people come back a year later Paul how many people do you have 12 come back a year later how many people you have Paul 12 Paul what are you doing Paul where's the fruit of your ministry I've got 12 I started with 12 and I still have 12 they haven't fallen away they've got the spirit of God and it's giving them overcoming power you might have a thousand but how many have overcoming power right God's in it for quality not quantity amen Sons and Daughters of God they won't be phased by these things he says and up to this point God was okay with the way things were going the sons of God had stayed separate they were seeking after God God was responding to them Church listen to this Enoch walked with God and took a Rapture under these conditions that ought to give us hope this even this morning as we look at that that Enoch was able to stay separate from all of the things that were going on and he walked so cleanly and so closely to God that God took him in a res in a Rapture the conditions are not what Define who's going and who stain it's what's in the heart that's going to do it amen he walked with God and he pleased God and he overcame the things of the world and he kept himself separate what a testimony for us to lay hold to when we're in the darkest of times God is here and he's about to say I'm going to destroy it all and in that time where God's about to destroy it all what does he do he takes up somebody in a Rapture without seeing death now if things had stayed separate if the sons of man had stayed in their place and sons of God stayed in their place then CHR could have come and he would have come to redeem the sons of God and it would have been an easy peasy plan because they'd have all been living over here and he could have just come there and he could have died for them and we'd have said we know who the sons of God are we know who the daughters of God are because they've been kept in a Pure Line that's the way it would have went because there was a clear physical separation there it'd be very obvious but now things are Blended and there is no clear separation things are going downhill and God doesn't like it a single bit it says it repented the Lord that he had made men on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and the Lord said I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the Earth both man and Beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that I have made them God says it's gone too far that's how powerful was the nature of Satan in men that in just a short span I think it was, 1600 years from Adam to the flood in600 years God said I've got to destroy this whole thing wow got to wipe the whole thing off but now if we go forward to Jesus and and he's talking about this very situation and we'll see these two natures and we're talking about this because we're going to be looking at the spirits that come through this brother B would talk about when you see the two Spirits working within the very framework of the church not the world in the church but within the frame of the church he says then we'll go when we realize what's going on when we realize who we are and who they are he says there'll be a separation and we're going to get out of here and they'll stay for for judgment but we want to see here what this looks like and Jesus is giving us his own Insight here it says another Parable put he forth unto them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field good seed only right God's perfect plan in God's perfect plan only good seed were on this Earth Sons and Daughters of God in God's image it says but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tears among the wheat and went his way tears are a wild plant we think it's a weed that would look like thistles or briers or something no a tear is a plant a wild plant that looks just like a wheat until the very end in every aspect except what it produces it looks just like a wheat amen it looks like wheat for a while says but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appear here the tears also now notice now it's only when the real wheat starts to show some grain that the differences appear because they're looking they're saying some is producing wheat and some ain't they both look like wheat they look like wheat but now something's producing grain and something's not they say we got a problem here right why you can't tell it apart otherwise until the fruit starts to show we don't know who's who or what's what amen religion can I put it this way religion looks a lot like Christ for a while they come to church they do what the scripture says they listen to what the preacher says they do all these things but if there isn't an inward change then it's not going to hold them forever and they'll fall away and we covered that in the last service when we spoke on good ground amen the two lines the two Natures look very close for a long time sometimes he says so the Servants of the householder came and said unto him s did thou did not thou sow good seed in thy field from whence have the tears he said you put in the good stuff where's the bad stuff coming from and he said unto them an enemy had done this the servant said unto him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up they said do you want us to go in and clean up the field take out all the tears leave the wheat and he said nay no lest while you gather up the tears you root up also the wheat with them he says if you go out and you use what you think you know and take them apart you're going to take up some of the wheat thinking that it's a tear amen that's a real good warning to us as believers just cuz you don't see it now doesn't mean you won't see it then amen and we see here that there might have been wheat there that hadn't produced grain Yet brother Brandon remember he goes on the he has a he goes across the beyond the curtain in a time and he sees this beautiful one woman come up to him and and she's just glowing and he says she says don't you know who I am and he says no who are you she says you led me to the Lord and I think she was 92 90 or 92 years old can you imagine all the hope that was lost over that woman saved in her 90s but if she's a wheat she's going to produce wheat it'll come forth you can't keep it back you can't hold back the life of God Amen just because it hasn't started producing the fruit doesn't mean it's not a wheat so then he has wisdom he says let both grow together when until the Harvest see some wheat starts showing grain later than others but there's a a time of harvest where all the wheat is in its maturity now some might only have 30 some might have 60 some might have 100 but all of the wheat will show its true nature and he says when you can see that then you can do it but until then you got to wait he says let them grow together until the Harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers Gather ye together first the tears and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my birn so there's Reapers for the tears first and then what's left is taken up and we see brother Brown's very clear on this he says The ecumenical move today is binding the tears together for judgment amen they're all different all the denominations are different and they stand on their differences but they all come from one source and it's the mother of harlots you go into Revelation 175 it says she's the mother of harlots everything that came out of her they think they're different they think they're separated but all they did was went into their own line of religion and it's the same thing that Nimrod did in Babel he created his own religion and it's come through all the way ever since and it's just men with their ideas trying to produce God it doesn't work they're Bound for judgment they all get the same same reward in his judgment then Jesus now comes down verse 36 and he sent the multitudes away and went into the house and his disciples came into him saying declare unto us the parable of the tears of the field what do this mean Jesus and he answered and said unto them he that sth the good seed is the son of man now pay attention to this phrase there not Son of God he says son of man Christ comes three ways he comes as Son of God through the church ages he comes as son of man in a prophetic office and it's specific to certain Ministries and time periods and then he comes as son of David in the millennial Reign Son of God Son of Man son of David okay we're not going to cover that so much today but just to lay it in there he says it's the son of man this is It's a prophetic work that's sewing these seeds and we saw it All Through the Ages we saw it all through Moses he sent a prophet and the prophet swed the word didn't he then after that he sends Samuel and he sends this one and that one and they're sowing the word and they're sowing the word and they're sowing the word Christ comes and he comes as son of man he is the Son of God but he comes as son of man he comes as a prophet a prophet like unto Moses will I raise up amongst you he comes as a prophet amen and so we see here that they're sowing the word and they're using that to reap when they preach the word that's what gathers the tears together because they reject it so that's a gathering there and then the the true sons of God and Daughters of God they receive the word and it produces wheat it produces life amen he says the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom and the tears are the children of the wicked one there we see the children of the wicked one who was Cain of the wicked one these are Satan's seed this is the seed of the serpent not physical not physical and we'll see that this is spiritual now remember there's two seeds you have the seed of the woman which is the seed of God and the seed of the serpent which is the seed of the devil and in the beginning where we've been reading they were physical lines to start but now when they mix now we've got to come to what's in the soul that's the only thing that's pure now is the soul right that's the only thing that is eternal that's the only thing that comes from God is the soul everything else in this is not from God in our Natural Born Condition it's a soul issue now it's not a physical issue he says the enemy that sold them is the devil so if you're Children of the wicked one then who sold the seed the devil Children of the devil it was physical in the beginning now it's spiritual he says and the Harvest is the end of the world and the reapers are the Angels who are the Angels they're The Messengers they're the ministry combined it's the seven angels of the seven Church ages from Revelation 120 and then you have the five full ministry of Ephesians 4 they're all laborers in the Harvest and remember what Jesus said in Matthew 10 he says he that receiveth you receiveth me you turn them down at your peril there's only judgment if you turn down the ones that God sends your way right because Christ is not coming back today in the way he did 2,000 years ago he's coming down in a five-fold Ministry to produce a bride amen it's it's bringing us into the unity of our faith into Perfection as Ephesians talked about it's the ministry of a five-fold Ministry that does that that produces the bride it's Christ working in these men he says as therefore the tears are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be at the end of this world the son of man shall send forth his angels and they Shall Gather out of his kingdom all those that offend and them which do iniquity so catch this this is now the The Messengers those labors for Christ the ministry they're picking and choosing people and it's based on their message not on their discernment I don't say who's in or out and you don't say who's in and out but what you do with the word will tell us who's in and who's out and the thing is it ain't over till it's over that's why he says You' got to wait till the Harvest amen when I look at how I acted until I gave my heart to the Lord I was out by outward appearance but by a soul by the soul inside of me I was always in and I just needed to come to a place where I'd surrender and let him do the work inside of my life it says and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be wailing and nashing of teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as the son in the Kingdom of their father who have ears to hear let him hear so there's a separation coming and it's not based on on on what we can say about our family lines but it's coming based on how we receive the message that God sends our way so then we go back to Genesis now and we have those two separate lines and now they started mixing but there was a family there was a line that stayed separate there was one that stayed pure for a while and the scripture says this but Noah found Grace in the eyes of the Lord amen Noah had kept his his skirts clean he had kept himself separate it says now these are the generations of Noah Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations and Noah walked with God Noah was a sincere believer he was separate from the world but notice the difference between Enoch and Noah Noah found Grace but Enoch pleased God Enoch walked with God and Enoch pleased God it does not say Noah did the same thing it said he was just and he was perfect in his generation compared to those around him he was in a really good place and he was of the Pure Line of God and he was sincere but that was not enough to take Noah in a Rapture amen God always has a witness and he has a witness while the bride's here and then he has a witness when the bride's not here because there's people going to give their life in sincerity based on what they believed all along but as things get tangled up in a hurry and we know that in Noah we look at the ark and we think well that was pure and it was only the sons of God that were there but we know it wasn't because Noah's sons produced some pretty awful people people and we look at these things and I didn't put it here for the sake of time but when you say how does that happen if Noah's from the Pure Line then how did it get messed up and all we can say is somebody's wife they brought in somebody that they shouldn't have brought with them and if we look at what happened because Noah is not a type of the Bride Noah has never been a type of the Bride right Enoch was the type of the Bride Enoch stayed separate he walked with God and God took him before the tribulation came God took him before judgment Noah is is a type of the sincere believer that went through the tribulation and comes out on the other side and what's he doing he's rebuilding but he still is in his sinful nature the Millennium is not Perfection the Millennium is just the promised land that God offered to Israel they'll get it for A Thousand Years it'll be the Fulfillment of what God said he would do but it's the new Heaven and the new Earth and the New Jerusalem that's when Perfection comes and that's when he says I'll wipe away all tears there'll be no more death there'll be no more this there'll be no more that that's New Jerusalem time that's not Millennium time that's not Millennium time he's ruling with a rod of iron in the Millennium somebody's going to cry sometime rods of iron don't tickle somebody needs the rod of iron so the Millennium is not Perfection it's God having total control over the kingdoms of this Earth at that time but we know that Noah's son Ham is if there's anyone that was that was off the word it would be him because his son Canaan and his family members were the ones that became Giants and they went into the worst forms of idol worship they went into uh SAC child sacrifice they went into sensual worship before God God and this is the line that was cursed After the flood and and we won't get into what they did certainly not with young ears around but it says and he said cursed be Canaan a servant of servants shall he be to his Brethren and he said blessed be the Lord God of Shem and Canan shall be his servant God shall enlarge jaffi and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem and Canaan shall be a servant so Canaan is the son of ham and then when we look at what comes out of ham I'm not going to read all of this this morning but his sons were Kush and this is out of the Amplified Egypt I believe it was uh uh mam put and Canaan and you look at Canaan and Egypt those are the two one is the one that Israel had to destroy and the other one was the one that enslaved Israel but he says canaan's going to be your servant and all of his seed is going to be your servant but we see what happened is they went in and they produce good good not good but we see big kingdoms Kush begat Nimrod he became a mighty one in the Earth and he produced Babel and he United all the people a great Kingdom until God came down and scrambled their languages and then if we look at the the next section it says that they built Nineveh a great City that God God was going to destroy and yet they received Jonah's message and he spared them but this was a wicked City we look down verse 13 misam Egypt 14 the Philistines 15 those of sidon we go into 16 and it's the J ites and the amorites and the gites and the hivites all these different ones verse 19 from sidon gar Gaza and Sodom and Gomorrah these are the generations these are the cities this is the inheritance of Satan's seed of Cain's lineage that came down through all the way through these people and when you look at the scriptures after all of this you see that Ham's line was one that had the worst outcome they were Far and Away the worst Canan was the son of kush and Kush is the father of nimrod and Nimrod was the first one to start a new religion that was anti- the original word and that is literally the source of where Catholicism comes from today where they worship women they worship men they worship the son they worship all these different things and Nimrod is the source of that and we may get into that at a different time but it was an anti- ideology that came from Satan in the very beginning what is it it's the nature following through right his other son egyp Enslaved the Israelites the amorites got so bad that God said the cup of the iniquity of the amorites is full go in and Destroy them and that's why God said when you go in Kill Them All leave nothing behind because the only thing that they have is Iniquity the only thing that they can think as evil they are anti- word anti- God anti- everything that God stands for destroy them completely no mercy no mercy Sodom and Gomorrah God literally sends two angels specific Al to destroy them that's how bad they got and you know what scripture says we're the same thing today the world exactly as it was in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah as it was in the days of lot that's exactly what we have here today their the the thoughts of their mind are evil continually that's what we see we see the the the total Beast nature its perversion the amorites and the moabites in particular brought in child sacrifice can you imagine that that you believe that killing your children would draw you closer to God that's how sick they got that's how twisted they got and God couldn't stand it and he said go in and Destroy them all and so we see that after the flood everything mixed together Noah was clean Noah was pure there was no and we even look at the nature animals weren't scared before the flood men weren't eating animals they weren't killing them for sport and and everything was still in a in a sort of perfect way the men were Fallen but creation was still doing okay the animals weren't there but as soon as the the ark opens up after the flood God says now the animals are going to be scared for you I'm giving them to you for food and for clothing and all these different things and we see that Noah's sons they let everything start to slide and everything gets so Blended and mixed and it broke the lineage of the sons of God to where nobody could say now I am a Son of God nobody could say that it it was so Blended that everyone was now sons of men and we had a hybrid mix we had a hybrid Humanity that was reflecting the original sin in the Garden of Eden and that's all they had for a Heritage now sons of men a fallen nature nobody could say I am a child of God by their physical lineage you know there was no one can say I can trace my family Roots purely back through Adam now you look at the genealogies that they show in Matthew and different places they go back to Adam but when you look at what was blended into those lines even if they could somehow claim that most of it was you have Rahab in there Rahab definitely ain't a daughter of God you know if we were looking at the physical line she comes from Cain's side look at Ruth a moabitas comes from Cain's side right there is no Purity in the physical line amen and so it is not a Pure Line and that we have people in Jesus day and they were saying we are of Abraham's seed they were laying claim to righteousness to being accepted of God based on who their daddy was who their grand great great great great great great grandfather was they said we come from a Pure Line and Jesus said you are all of your father the devil and you are children of hell what was he saying your physical family does not matter listen some of us have better families than others If we're honest you you know people and they've got a a pure a pure line and they can trace it all the way back to the lutherans day and they came out from from the Lutheran and they went into Wesley and they went from Wesley into Pentecost they came out of Pentecost and came into this end time message and they got a a family line of preachers and and people that sanctify their lives and guess what you can take somebody that's sitting there and they in right out from under their mushroom knowing nothing and sit them next to that person they're exactly the same in God's eyes no difference nothing to do with it amen what was Jesus showing he was showing this flesh is condemned it's hybrid it's mixed there's nothing good in it there's nothing good in this flesh Paul said there's nothing good in my flesh amen remember the scripture says all have sinned and come short of the glory of God none of us is made in God's image anymore and so we have nothing to come before him and say I'm righteous I'm good I'm Godly we can't do that there's no physically Pure Line we're all messed up we're all mixed up we're all broken we're all a failure and I think what confuses people so much today is that we can see elements of good there are people today that say people are basically good why because they see those moments where somebody is unselfish or somebody is caring or somebody is sacrificial or somebody is humble and they say see they're good they're good they're good but then somebody comes right up behind them and does something that's bad and that's all they do are bad things and they don't see that why because it's two Natures that have been Blended and God can't come through that you'll see elements of it but you'll never see the fullness of it amen If we're honest all of us can look at our own natures and see what we're born with and we can see family traits good and bad from our parents from our grandparents some people are born and they seem mostly good we know them we know people that just seem to come out and they came out caring and humble and kind and they'll talk to anybody and there's doesn't seem to be any selfishness in their life and we think they're good then we see somebody that comes out and they're stubborn and egotistical and they're unfriendly and and all these different things but that's not what makes us good or bad it has nothing to do with it those two people both have mixed natures and just CU one nature seems to be stronger than the other does not make them any more or less righteous amen if we took those two people and stood them in the presence of God they would be judged as equals no difference no difference Amen in fact when we look in the scriptures we see many times that the children of God look far worse than the children of men amen Jacob was a Shyer he was a liar he was a cheat he was a manipulator right until he met God look at Rahab she was a prostitute an Idol worshipper Ruth the same Abraham was a liar worried about self preservation time and time again the Apostle Paul persecuted the True Church of God Matthew and zakus as we heard were Tax Collectors praying on their own people Mary had seven demons in her what are we going to do with that it's not based on what we can see from birth we're all broken we're sinful we're hybrid we're destined to die from birth we cannot please God in this flesh we can't do it we can't do it what a downer of a service we're getting this morning but I won't leave you without hope we were talking last night I said I will not close on a negative note and we're closing we're going to go to Romans 8 Romans 8 is one of my favorite chapters in the scripture I got an amen out a brother a silent amen from brother Mark because Romans 7 tells us everything that I preached in this service I probably should have just read Romans 7 this body of death that which I would do I don't do that which I should do I don't do and I find a law when I would do good then Evil's present when I would do yeah Paul says this whole thing this is so frustrating who will deliver me from it and then he comes into Romans 8 and he says there's there for now no condemnation to them who are in Christ and he goes down and we're going to we're going to just dwell on that a little bit this morning so we go out with some with some not just some hope with some reality amen some reality it says this for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit so what makes the difference Church the spirit that's what we need that's why we're doing this series on the token on the token life on the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is the only thing that will change your life the word alone won't do it because it has to be quickened and that takes the Holy Spirit he says for to be carnally minded is death now notice he says carnally minded he doesn't say carnally badm minded he says carnally minded the good that we come up with this carnal mind is never going to be acceptable to God our ideas our ways our thoughts our preferences our inferences our intelligence our reason our logic none of it is going to bring us to life every bit of it amen it's all bad the carnal mind is out of not of God so everything it produces is not of God period he says but to be spiritually minded is life and peace why because the caral mind is enmity against God this is the Serpent's Trace that we have even today we're in a beast nature without the Holy Spirit that's why you see the world focused on on on on the the the Flesh and the lust of the flesh that that's total serpent nature right without the Holy Spirit we've been hybrid and there's no cleaning it up it's sinful because it's not pure not because it doesn't have potentially some good it's because it's not all good so he says the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be he says then so they that are in the flesh cannot please God so don't try don't try don't rest in that stop trying that'll give you rest when you say this flesh is not what he's coming for anyways this has to be glorified this has to be quickened it has to die first and then it has to be raised in newness of life for me to please him but this flesh does not please God church if we stop right here we say we're hopeless we're lost we're forsaken we're unworthy there's nothing can happen and then he says in verse 9 Hallelujah but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit hallelujah amen he says now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his people say I accepted Christ but the Bible says unless you've got the Holy Spirit he hasn't accepted you you accepting Christ does not get you into heaven you do not find that anywhere in the scriptures because he'll say if you're my disciples then you'll do what I say just sitting there and saying I've accepted Christ what does that do that's nothing it's a confession that's it there's no repentance associated with it there's no baptism on the day of Pentecost Peter did not come down and say if you accept Christ then you'll go into heaven he said repent be baptized and received of the gift of the Holy Ghost that's what you need to do to be saved there's only one Ark today and it's the body of Christ and Corinthians says by by one Spirit were baptized into that body the only Safe Haven we have today is the body of Christ and you only get there by the spirit you have to have the Holy Spirit if you don't have it Christ has not accepted you because remember they're going to come to them that day and say didn't we do this and didn't we do this and didn't we do this and do didn't we do this he says I never knew you who are you they accepted Christ but they didn't do what he said they only took what they wanted and he says I never knew you there's no intimacy he says but if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin don't try and resurrect it Church don't try and make it he says but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall Quicken your mortal bodies that word Quicken means make alive and Mortal bodies he's literally talking about this flesh now there's a forward work that he's pointing to which is the glorification but he says in the meantime he's going to make this flesh live the way that God wants you to live he says it'll Quicken your mortal bodies it'll live the way it was meant to from the beginning by his spirit that dwelleth in you Hallelujah let's stand this morning amen we can look at so many things and say there's no way out and then we read that and we say he's made a way amen God came down and he made a way for us to return back and we see this whole Bible is a book of redemption I've been talking with some people lately and I said we've got to look at it from the beginning to the end because it all ties together and it's one big story it's like saying could you open a book I think I don't know who it was that said to me this week said could you open a book and read one chapter and figure out what the whole book's about no you need to read the whole thing and this is a complete and total story of redemption of God coming back and God saying I will not leave my children in their fallen condition and what does he do he comes down to Abraham just literally takes Abraham there I don't know how many people were in the world then hundreds of thousands maybe millions and he comes down and he just comes in and he takes one person here we go and God says I'm going to start a work with one and I'm going to redeem my entire family through the faith that's exhibited in this man I'll pick you I'll separate you I'll place you I'll put a word promise in your life and I'll fulfill it and I'm not just going to do it for you Abraham but you've got a royal seed that's coming down and I'll do it for every single one of them the scripture says he swore by himself he didn't say I'll do it if Jonathan kette overcomes he says Jonathan carlette's going to overcome because I said he's going to overcome man that Dale Walger going to go into a Rapture because I said Dale wer is going to go into a Rapture he swore by himself it's his work not ours and all he's looking for is a bride that'll say yes Lord Abba Father Lord bring me back to you God do in my life what you said you were going to do Lord let me surrender to the word so that the word can be quickened by the spirit and bring this flesh into subjection and take me off this Earth keep me separate from this world that it'll heal my body that it'll change my life that it'll produce a word bride all over again amen he told Abraham he says your seed will possess the gates of their enemies you'll go right back to your original inheritance and they won't be able to hold you back from it I say praise the Lord this morning amen God bless you let's bow our head Heavenly Father Lord so often we tend to look at circumstances we look at our failures Lord we look at our trying Lord and we can get caught up in that but Lord your word says that if your spirit dwells in US it brings life Lord and your word says that you came to bring life and that abundantly Lord and if we can only surrender to that Spirit Lord if we can get it and then surrender to it Lord it'll produce your life day in day out until you take us so Lord I pray that this would be a holy spirit filled church not a church Lord but a people that comes to this church Lord that each and every one of us here Lord that there would be a cry father father Lord that we reach out to you day by day and say don't leave me here don't leave me in this condition don't leave me in this body don't leave me in this defeat but bring me into perfect Victory heaven father I pray Lord let us cry out to you I pray Lord let us look to you let us call on you let us wait on you let us have faith in you Lord and let us take your word and put it in our hearts and on our lips Lord day by day that we could walk in the promise of victory that comes with it I pray Lord Quicken Us by your spirit Lord Jesus Lord we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen if that same Spirit 165 if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you dwell in you with that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it dwell in you oh shall Quicken your mortal body if that Spirit dwell in you oh it shall Quicken your moral body if that Spirit dwell in you so if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it dwell in you with that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it dwell in you oh it shall quick your mortal body if that Spirit dwelling you oh it shall Quicken your lord of if that Spirit one more time oh if that same spirit that raised Christ
