seek Jesus Christ me [Music] I mean all things are possible yes now believe this now the word beneath us now this Amen in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us now the word is flesh in us amen praise the name of the Lord now I believe praise the name of the Lord hallelujah praise the Lord God bless you turn with me to Luke chapter 14 hallelujah the Word of God is in a Bible but the Bible is in us amen the word is may flesh in us by the grace of God in Luke chapter 14 it's a text that brother Bantam used in us in a message that I want to share with you tonight and some thoughts in that message amazing that it still lines up with the theme of the messages that we've been ministering on brother because it's what God does from the beginning and that is get personal with us amen God is not over there and we're over here no he comes down a man to make us one with him through his word praise the name of the Lord that's where he kept or he asked Martha believe us though this a man and brother if God was looking for anything all down through the ages he was looking for those that believed his word a man regardless of what he revealed when he revealed it where he revealed how he revealed it believe us now this a man so brother when the word was made flesh believed the word and brother if the word is may flesh in you believe the word a man by the grace of Almighty God so brother right from the beginning where was it that the the sin in the beginning it was caused Eve to doubt the word what to do he handed one to it that's all God said thou shalt surely die and the devil said yea thou shall not surely die just one word and they believed them that's right he believed the serpent yeah I said you're all you will be as God's knowing good and evil a mayor so don't go by what the devil is saying you stay with what God said amen brother oh my and but yet God knew what was going to happen and God permitted it a man knowing that again why did he do that because she was again one of our brothers linked Rome Africa he said that he was a byproduct and he highlighted the fact that yarn I thought and I sure what part of Africa he said yeah he said that's right he said because the women are still byproducts thereof buying products all the time and so brother I pray God will not forget it a man but she was a byproduct she wasn't cheating she was not in the original creation no no Shh Adam was the original creation but he took act he took Eve out of Adam a man she was she was the rib a man and she was weak she had that weakness and God knew what was going to happen and God permitted it because God wanted to reveal himself to us as Lord and Savior he wanted to reveal his love to us so that we're going to love him for himself amen not because like the Angels they're gonna love him because they're made to love him they're created to love him no no no he's going to reveal his character and we're gonna love his character thank you Jesus amen love the Lord from the inside out in in st. Luke's Gospel chapter 14 and beginning to read at verse 16 and again a number of times recently I've been feeling to read this scripture and I said no I can't read that for some reason no no no and I go to it no turn from it again I still Lord what would you have me to read and but I never realized that this would be the text for the message is your life worthy of the gospel a man and we're talking about hearing and seeing the way that God hears and wants you to hear and see it we're done by the right motives and the right objectives and doing doing God a service without his will a man but to Kornegay his will we got to see it the way God wants us to see it hear it the way God wants us to hear it a man we gotta have a right motive and a right objective a man and then with what we do we'll do according to his will by the grace of God so brother but now it comes down to the question is is your life worthy of the gospel a man so are you hearing it and seeing it the way you should and do you have the right motive and the right objectives in your life a Maya and how you doing God a service according to his will a man these things got to line up with the will of God and the Word of God to do that do what he wants you to do according to his will amen you can serve God and yet be lost and he'll bring that out that's tremendous I said oh Lord I'll have to share that quote with him for sure a man is right near the end of the message but I said oh God I said lord I never never saw that in that way before but at the way that he brought it out so I said Lord how I said help me I said him to say it help me to speak it and helped us out the Saints I said to receive it amen so it's tremendous what is the life a man that is worthy of the gospel this is tremendous because there are lives maybe in the Bible we think is worthy of the gospel but they weren't no no they weren't so I pray the grace of God brother we need to understand what is the life that is worthy of the gospel amen well I mean in the message but the promise of the message is not in you a man so I'll make sure the message is in you by the grace of God and this was his tanks verse 16 then said he unto him a certain man made a great supper and made many and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready the marriage supper of the lamb come for all things are now ready and they all with one Accord began to make excuse amazing the first said unto him I have bought a piece of ground and I must needs go and see it I pray thee and me excused they were invited but what they did show their life was not worthy of the gospel and another Saint I have bought by yoke of oxen and I go to prove them I pray thee have me excused amazing and another sad I have married a wife and therefore I cannot come so that servant came and showed his Lord these things then the master the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in either the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blind yes amazing and the servants say Lord it is done as thou has commanded and yet there is room mazing and the Lord under the servant go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled for I say unto you that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper Amen god bless his words you may be seated we'll get into them thoughts in just a moment but just to remind you that on Sunday will be having the communion and foot washing and communion on Sunday so be in prayer for the service that God will be blessed us with his presence and also to remind you of concerning again our brother Jonathan Colette and he will be arriving on November the 8th on Friday night and he will be ministering on November the 9th and November the 10th and ordinarily that we would get them to come on on a Thursday and minister on a Friday but because of his work in British Columbia that he's not able to come on Thursday and this is why that his flight is on a Friday and Friday night so let's be in prayer for brother Jonathan that the Lord will give him a safe journey and bless his ministry to us on a Saturday and a Sunday by the grace of God and I'm not sure understand that maybe he'll be traveling back on a Wednesday so God's great God's grace to our brother Jonathan and also to our sister Blanco course and her need and also to pray the grace of God of course I believe I understood that brother Matthew got his moose he's not loose no he got it sorry so we'll pray the grace of God to our brother Matthew and also to our brother Joseph and pray the Lord will provide our brother Joseph with what he's looking for a man but also to if the Lord would permit it that God would bless their time with for all fellowship with the Saints they met our brother Matthew did say that he would endeavor and try to fellowship with the Saints while he was in central Newfoundland a man so we pray the Lord will will open up make it make it possible for brother Matthew and brother Joseph because there was a number of theirs I said that are supporting the ministry here and I pray the grace of God to bless the Saints with fellowship amen and also again there's a brother in Africa and he's in Ghana and our brother Jacob Jonah he said that he he would he would might be coming to Canada but where he's going in Canada is Western Canada and he referred to a brother a brother Stewart and I assume his brother Stewart Cummings in British Columbia and he's in his rate writing right out through the west near the Pacific Ocean as that's the last at least the last time that I had communication with him and and his wife so I I haven't been in contact with him but brother Jonah did mention fellowship with our brother Stewart so everybody also wanted the fellowship in Newfoundland so we'll see what the Lord will do and our brother Jacob Jonah is an evangelist in in Ghana than any travels he does travel around Africa different parts of Africa and I did get a good report for regarding our brother Jonah so we pray god bless him and when it comes to his visit to Canada we'll we'll leave it with the Lord and see what the Lord would arrange aim so god bless you and god bless brother Stuart and and sister Stuart so I assume that they're not young either and they're getting out there because of course they've they've retired quite a while ago so god bless them and of course we I do have a cassette somewhere and I believe I may be we might have played it to the church and there's brother Stuart's testimony I know asked quite a while ago and concerning you know what he was involved in out there in the world but then the Lord got a hold of him he was looking for truth and he told he tells us that he went across Canada and he went down in the United States and he was looking for the truth and then he came back up into British Columbia somewhere believe it was and that's where he came in contact with the message of the hour he said God led me to the truth a man so he's he's thankful for what the Lord did he but he like I said he was sincere and he traveled and he traveled and he windier and he went there and went there looking for the truth a man cuz he felt was it was beyond denominations he was beyond this beyond that any any check number of ministries but still he just each felt it wasn't the truth till he came to the message of the hour amen so god bless our brother Stuart amen so and also to thank our brothers here our brother Weiser land brother John and brother Joshua for the fellowship we had last Sunday we were at the restaurant for quite a while and so we we had to leave because we thought if we didn't leave they were gonna force us out so we were there for such a long time fellowshiping at the table but again we thank the thing the Lord that the manager did come and have some fellowship with us as well and and also then we went to our condo and we had fellowship there and it was tremendous a man it was wonderful thank the Lord so and it was a real blessing man and a blessing in the into this desert desert brother that we add and so on in the fellowship we had and our brother Marshall was right there to help sister Betty to prepare to prepare it you know sitting the table and he wanted he won't even wash the dishes anyway that's good a man so if he if you anybody invites him here to their home get him to wash dishes a man does not many would would want to do that for you so thank the Lord so god bless him a like I said it was wonderful fellowship amen thank the Lord again the scripture in st. Luke's Gospel chapter 14 and brother Branham does bring out eventually in the message we may not be able to get into it tonight here in his your life worthy of the gospel but I have I lighted here in my notes in the Bible that does text that brother Branham was using as three poles and it does speak of the evening time it is not the morning it is not in the noon it is evening time and again it proves again what brother Benton believed he didn't believe in breakfast lunch and dinner brother BAM believed in breakfast dinner and supper a man because he said if I have breakfast lunch and dinner he said I missed my supper and he said wonder where it is because to brother Branham and again to again to Newfoundlanders and to the hill to Kentucky Hillbillies that supper was in the evening a man not dinner then it was during the noonday breakfast was in the morning but supper was in the evening and this is the parable of the great supper this is the parable of the evening time supper it is a parable of the marriage supper of the lamb a man it is the heavenly bridegroom and it is the earthly bright a man and the invitation is sent out inviting this one and this one and that one too the marriage supper of the lamb and this one uses this excuse and that issues and another excuse and the prophet of God highlights it here in this message about the excuses that man is making and he said he shows that their lives are not worthy of the gospel a man because they're giving preeminence to their natural lives but not to their spiritual and they're giving preeminence to themselves and what they want to do and when they want to do it and how they want to do it but they're not getting preeminence to the to God they're not giving Prima's to what God is requiring of us what God is looking for in us a man so their lives were not worthy of the gospel any-any he highlights this as well that they're doing this for God they're doing that for God a man and you think oh yeah they're there they're Christians oh yeah they're believers no they're not Christians and they're not believers because why because they're getting more preeminence to the natural things of life than to the spiritual a man and brother I turn to this for a life to be worthy of the gospel you're going to get more preeminence to the spiritual and less and less and less to the natural a man by the grace of Almighty God you're not going to focus on the natural you're going to leave that with God not my real father laying me down Alleluia and Jesus came to that II and they in that time of his ministry and brother the bride comes to that in the in the last days when we consider the hour that we are living in and we're in our Lord warned us that the love of many would wax cold and I didn't say there to love would be gone but their love would be cold they would they wouldn't have much love a man the love of many would wax cold a man and brother and then we're living in that day we're living in that hour Witek swear we're witnessing that thought brother sister nada just out there in the world we're witnessing that among even among many so-called believers they have not the love that they used to have a man it has when it's cold so we are living in that hour and when we have the morning a man mother to be on our guard and brother to give to give more and more preeminent to the spiritual and lay laughter the natural but again because the love of many of exco they're giving less and less preeminence and less or less attention to the spiritual things that God is dealing with in this hour amen the spiritual things that God is revealing in this hour the spiritual things that God is showing us in this hour a man their brothers are getting caught up with this doctrine and that doctor and that one a man will highlight that that's in the Word of God and the Private Eye lights it here in this message oh yeah they'll get caught up with this and caught up with that but they are not caught up with what God wants something get caught up with they're not focusing on what God wants them to focus on a man they're focusing on this revelation that revelation other revelation and doctrine but how many are focusing on the resurrection and the rapture a man a man see you're coming right back to that again because that's what God is doing in this hour and in this age it's not if not revealing justification is not just revealing sanctification is not revealing the visit the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit know were gone beyond their amen brother even the early Pentecostals were we're been looking for what you but God as done and God is doing in your life and in mine because even though the early Pentecost was the old-fashioned Pentecostals when they saw what God was doing in the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit oh yeah they were thinking oh my praise the Lord oh there there I I believe that this is going to go on to the resurrection I believe this was going to go on to the rapture hey man that's right so soon now that this generation of Pentecostals don't believe that they believe all the other resurrection is down the road the rapture is down the road oh there's going to be a resurrection is going to be a rapture but they don't see the the the revelation egg what God had done in the Pentecostal age as a prophet of God he said listen he said this this ministry and what God was doing in the Prophet and through the Prophet he said it is the crowning of the Pentecostal message it is the crowning of the Pentecostal age a man by the way because Luther's age will lead on to Wesley and Wesley slid onto the well he was Salvation Army because why because the Methodists said and organized so quickly the prophet of God said they God had the raised up William Booth he said with redhot salvation he said to keep on going with Wesley's message and brother before God took William Booth off the scene before God took a Katharine booth off the scene what were they preaching they were preaching the need for the baptism of the holy ghost and the gifts of the Spirit amen they were up there hallelujah they were pointing they were pointing to the day of Pentecost and they were preaching you know what we need in this hour now we need what they had on the day of Pentecost you mean to tell me that wouldn't move with preaching that you mean to tell me that even his wife Katherine with preaching those things yes a man and because why because all my Eva even Katherine movement was was preaching concerning the she was a woman preacher but she didn't know the other things and before God took her off the saint she was preaching at you is putting the emphasis on on the sisters in the Salvation Army she said she said we got a problem and she said it's in your in your in your closet amen because she was seeing that the worldly spirit was getting on the sisters and the worldís mirror was getting coming in around the Salvation Army amen and she solutions of the pregnancy there's not ears not there it's in your closet and she said you need to repent and we needed we knew she said where you what we need she said we need she said what they had on the day of Pentecost amen so they were putting more and more and more emphasis on the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit why because because that was the next thing that God was going to do amen that was an x-ray Bible God was going to bring that was the next revival Carver is going to start Amen praise the name of the Lord it was the Pentecostal revival it was Timothy was the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit remember because during the during the church ages when they went into the Dark Ages the the baptism of the Holy Ghost that was that wasn't that wasn't considered and the gifts of the Spirit amen the enemy of the me and the enemy had got in and the emphasis was no longer on the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Emerson's were no longer the gifts of the Spirit the emphasis was on just-just-just doctrine it was on this doctor that I would say it was on religion amen amen they got away from the spirit and they got in a man they got into organized religion and the organ it was in the first church and then in the second and third church age Amen the deeds of the Nicolaitans amen what is the deeds of the Nicolaitans and so on and I have mentioned it before here in Revelation bear with me and he said but this though a said thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans which I also hate and what was the deeds of the Nicolaitans it was a spirit that was getting among the early church to conquer the lady a man so that they're going to put all the emphasis on the ministry air and take it away from there from the leadership of God in the congregation of the elders and of the Deacons are so on amen brother I tell you the Ministry of the word would be on to the authority of the ministry but again they they they not only took not only putting them in the emphasis on those things but they they didn't want anybody in the congregation to have any saint about what God was doing and what God would do amen anyway they and everybody oh yeah they're do they wanted you to worship the ministry they wanted you to put the emphasis on the ministry they wanted you to do nothing to say nothing without controlling the ministry and it was taking all authority away from any brother and sister that God would usually in their certainly a man that it was the deeds of the Nicolaitans amen conquer the laity that's what it means conquer the lady amen so that older you because God could deal with with this one God to deal with that one the gifts of the Spirit God could do with this one it in a dream or in a vision a man but no they took all that away and everything they put they gave all authority to the ministry a man so that you had you had to listen to the ministry and you had to consult the ministry a man well there is there is a truth to it a name but not to the extent that the deeds of the Nicolaitans a man what was doing in the first church H and Anna and you read the church ages as they went on into the second and into the third church H brother in it's just a thought in the first age but then it becomes a doctrine amen it's a doctrine and then it becomes an absolutely a spirit in the church and the church organized a man and the trend what do they do and because most of the church came under organized religion and he went off into darkness amen but God said I will restore saith the Lord hey man anybody any was Sri was through Luther and Wesley and to the Pentecostals that God began to bring it back again and brother lay there and the authority wasn't just in the end again there in the pulpit brother God begin to deal with the Saints in the in the congregation amen and God begin to all this one admissions this one had dreams and this would I add a gift of tongues and this one had two gift of interpretation hey man and God began to reveal the gifts of the Spirit brother it wasn't just in there caught in the in the pulpit now within the congregation hey man you got to see the the ministry has got to be anointed as the father God said he sure the ministry is the absolute authority in all spiritual matters but he's not going to take it out of the congregation a man for the man and so the brother of the ministry has got got a head the anointing of the Holy Ghost and and you in in the congregation you got to have the Holy Ghost amen but they took it out of the end of the congregation but under the ministry but now God would begin to bring it back through Luther and Wesley and the Pentecostals amen and the baptism of the Holy Ghost wasn't just on the ministry the match's emul a ghost was in the audience the bathroom of the Holy goes with anything in the congregation and this way and God began to restore the gifts of the Spirit here and there and it wasn't just a minister it was this brother it was this sister amen brother sister because when I when I first came to the Pentecostal revival and and and and well beyond the Pentecost revival in gamble a man with our brother Berko sister Marcos came from the mainland down to to gamble said to do for the head a man and there was a revival praise the name of the Lord and brother we started having cottage meetings and the sisters there and their brothers there they had the gifts of the Spirit amen and God was dealing with us amen oh there was a message in tongues it was interpreted just terms there was a tongues and interpretation or there was a prophecy amen Oh God begin to move a virus God was restoring amen the gifts of the Spirit gathered his story his authority in his sons and daughters not just the ministry but all of his sons and daughters even in the congregation amen and finally what did God bring where to God bring us he brought us to the message amen he brought us out of organization he brought us at a religion a man in the indian to the word into there and finally into the message of the hour a man but brother that's what he brought us out out of religion that's what he brought us that a denomination a man should bring us into the word bring us into the message because if we stayed in denomination a man and then if we were putting the everyone denomination we would doubt the word or the message but God delivered us amen so brother sister let's not let's not come under under the deeds of the Nicolaitans again and yeah I know that just that in the Canadian spirit has come among Messi's churches boy it is because I sense that that there's nothing good really lately the Spirit of God is not moving in the congregation amen brother sister this rid of God if God is in the pulpit the God is in the congregation amen if God is moving in the pulpit God is going to move in the congregation amen but a but if it made in controlling the pull but then God is not in the congregation amen and I know that there are there are so called message churches around the world but brother all the authority is in the county in the pulpit not in the congregation that is the absolute truth and you can go in there sit there and then you don't sense the anointing the the Holy Spirit is not there and the Holy Spirit is not in the pulpit the only spirit is not in the congregation amen but if he is in the Bourbon is in the congregation amen because why because God through the Ministry of the word it's good it's gonna give that Liberty in that freedom amen for the spirit to move on this brother and this sister amen in the congregation hey but make sure that it's the Holy Ghost anointing amen because for others you can come under a false spirit and a wrong spirit amen and and end up being a you know a soul in prison amen a soul in present by in prison with the wrong spirit oh yeah oh yeah we are now I got that message right in there so we'll get to that eventually souls in prison now amen souls in prison the other night they're not you know they're you know sinners know the right and the right so called they believe that they're in religion they're they believe that they're under God's leadership under under the devil's leadership amen and they're under the devil's honoring a man because they got his spirit and that's the public God says you can have the spirit of the devil onion amen in a church oh yeah so brother makes let's make sure we got the right anointing and make sure we got it in our souls amen not in our flesh you can add the right anointing in your flesh and still go to hell you can either wrong an idea in your flesh and go to hell let's make our calling and our election sure amen let's make sure we got the right anointing and that's make sure we got the anointing in our souls not in our are physical beings not even in our you our human spirits make sure it's in your soul amen and in your heart by the grace of Almighty God a man your brother the false anointing can begin to come on the church little by little of little and it's impersonating Jesus its impersonating the Holy Ghost oh yeah and people people delay all that this one has anointed or that they got the whole bachelor goes no they don't know see he said he was so close it would deceive the very elect if possible but the elect might be to see amen by the grace of God amen sure brother let's make our calling and election sure brother they to make sure I'm brother they then this one was invited that was invited another one was invited oh yeah what is the reason they were invited amen and then they dig brought up this excuse I can't come because of this I can't come without and brother and God has got his putting in in the preaching of the word today God is bringing out what he's what he's looking for in in the Bride of Christ and all I can't do this I can't do that I don't think this and I don't think that brother you gotta let go on that god of his way in your life hey man you gotta you're gonna if you give your other right of Christ amen you're gonna let him have pool and complete control hey man it's not what you want to do with what he wants to do hey man it's not why the way that he you want to live it's the way that he wants you to live and he wants to live in you but the thing of it is most who profess the gospel of day and then I would say that most have professed a message today their lives are not worthy of the gospel their knives are not worthy of the message their lives are not worthy of the marriage supper of the Lamb why because brother if you're making excuses now God's gonna because that God's gonna see those excuses in in the met in the in the resurrection of rapture it's gonna keep us out of the resurrection and rapture what because if you can't do what God wants you to do now and do the way God wants you to do it how good I want you to do it you won't be there no see your your you're being tested oh yeah God is allowing this guy's allowing that he's putting you to the test gods won't God I put I should do this God actually do that God I should do something else he'll see what you're gonna do amen see if you're gonna get privacy yourself you're gonna get prea mister the natural things I'm like or you're gonna get preimage to the spiritual a life that is worthy of the gospel gives preeminence to spiritual holy ghost in your soul not in your flesh this is serious and brothers getting more and more and more serious because we're getting closer to the resurrection and dr. Amy and the closer we get the more and more brother God is exposing that's right his bright is gonna be there you know the true saints of God are gonna be there amen they'll be in the resurrection they'll be in the rapture but most are gonna be left behind brother who do you think they are who's going to ask well I thought there was to be a rapture it's not them out there it's gonna be believers amen it'll be believers I saw this I saw that yes that's right but you missed it why because they didn't walk in the spirit they didn't walk in the light as he was in the light a man they didn't they weren't led by the spirit not the Holy Spirit they are led by a non holy spirit and remember they're still religious they still are I'm a believer I'm this and I'm that but look they're living for themselves they're not living for Jesus amen they're not making the sacrifices that Jesus would make no no do not live in the lives of Jesus lift it's not a life that is worthy of the gospel not by any means and it's amazing we get to it Lord willing that there's one error in the scripture it's amazing and the Prophet nights that that's that example in the scripture of the life that is not worthy of the gospel yet it's a it's a very religious life it's a holy life but not worthy of the gospel a man why because they're giving preeminence to the natural things of life more than to the spiritual oh yeah they're not denying the spiritual no they don't deny the spiritual then you know this they're not denying this denying that no but they're not they haven't they haven't they're not dying so that they can live more for the spiritual no no they're compromising so they can give more preeminence to the natural things of life and that's true so many believers today are cut off with natural things they want to do this they want to do that we want this we want brother-sister we don't want nothing if you're a seed of God you don't want anything but the will of God I'll tell you most believers today they don't stop the consider Lord what's your will and this once you're willing that see brother they're not living for God 24 hours a day it's just it's just a spirit that's on them that's right oh I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do that the Lord will mine the Lord what do you mean the Lord won't mind you better ask the Lord but most don't don't consult the Lord in all thy ways acknowledge him and he will direct your path that's the scripture the footsteps of the righteous are order of the Lord a man is not it's not you it's the Lord Amen this is tremendous I pray God in them and listen Amen brothers God give that gift give us that River that revelation in our hurts God give us that leadership hey man brother can we say that our that our brothers here from Africa and from India is that is that their leadership or God's leadership a main cause leadership did they come here or they God lead them here anyway did they do they plan this or did God planet oh brother that don't make a difference to it yes it does if the footsteps of the righteous Order of the Lord and brother this involves there's only a spiritual life yeah well this involves their spiritual life and when it says in all thy ways acknowledge him and he will direct your path so you don't you don't say o our Lord don't mind if I do this the lord of mine no ice up to you if you want to do it God get make gives you the choice but that's the same with the redemption it's your choice to accept it or reject it amen to follow God or to follow your own leadership which is the devil Satan uses our flesh saying use the senses of our flesh old brothers sister day in and day out 24 hours a day Satan is working on your flesh oh yeah cuz sometimes he might work in a dream yeah so brother you working on your flesh to influence influence your thoughts influence what you're doing amen what what's he trying to do to get you away from the Spirit the Holy Spirit - a religious spirit amen and to get you away from God's leadership to human leadership oh yeah and there's too many brother that's that oh yeah they don't mind being religious I believe this I believe this I believe this but they want to do what's right in their own eyes that's right brother as I said you know this has become just a Creed that's their Creed oh we believe you know and with them and William Branham is their founder William Booth was the founder of the Salvation Army a man others out there they say this one was the founder of the Pentecostal revival a man sister Gary yes I believe it was and so on the others and Luther was the founder of the of the Lutheran's Wesley with the founder of the Methodists and so on oh yeah and William William Branham with the founder of a lot of of the religion of many people run the message powder oh and we believe this we believe this brother we got to have the spiritual revelation not the letter hey man can we take this message and read it and and at home boss and let it humble us a man hey Mary can we take the message and readers and I feel within ourselves that we got we got a we got to line up with this Lord forgive me I don't mean to get out of line with the Lord please Lord help me to line up with your word with the trailer Lord O Lord I'm convicted over this more because I'm I'll leave I'm guilty of that but I totally mostly just read the message but it's not it's not making their calling and election sure it's just trying to learn the message amen brother ah I'll learn the message yeah brother dad said this round said that yeah again like I said there's others that read this book and that did read the Bible and they'll get to this page and just skip that oh yeah skip that yeah that that's just back there 2000 years ago I did I don't have read that yeah and the same thing I guess a with people reading these books as I said there are some assist your starting at the end because all they're looking for signs and wonders so they should start right here and getting to the signs and wonders amen if there are some and there's other there's and that's the truth there's other believers will read read a message book and they'll oh okay oh yeah just skip it oh yeah there are people that do that yes sir people to do that and what are they going to do they're just going to focus on on a certain doctrine or a teaching that they're under and oh yeah they're today yeah yeah yeah brother answer that right there yeah but there's something else you said back here gonna believe that some won't believe it and they're not looking for and that's why that we're seeing more and more of the world coming into the message world in us they're getting more and more and more modern that's the spirit of the devil she better be sure you're under the anointing of the Holy Ghost not the Holy Ghost hey man to make your call and election sure you got to make sure you got a right spirit by the grace of God a man that you're only with you if you got a right spirit and a right attitude in the Word of God concerning the Word of God is your life worthy of the gospel and listen to this he said we have assembled together father for no other purpose what's your purpose of being to learn more with the message to see if we can learn this we have assembled together for no other purpose but to try to learn how to live better hey man do you want to know how to live better you're going to hear the word and say Lord let discover me with when I when I go out the door to let me it let it let don't let me leave it behind amen but a lot of people they leave it behind how many take it with them in their hearts and in their souls amen to the extent that it controls you hey my don't use it to condemn somebody else use it to judge yourself amen so he said we're here to try to learn how to live better and he said no other purpose Oh to live better oh my brother you know we come here to get you know to get more faith yeah but that more faith to get in the more the better you live I want to pay for this and pay for that well yeah well then still if you got that faith in your heart you're gonna live better you're gonna live with a better attitude you're gonna live with a better spirit amen and you're going to live with more and more and more of the love of God oh yes and he said to live better and to live closer to you and if you're closer to him you're closer to me amen for we see the Day approaching and we must assemble ourselves together often amen and the only that the Bible says you know forsake not there's too many of yourselves together and much more as you see the Day approaching and believers are really not into it they want less and less and less and less as I said one time we said we fellowship three four times a week and now we were down to two and eventually you get down to one and tell finally there's a lot don't even fell asleep at all that's the truth that's the spirit of the world you know we Martha selves together often and take instructions from you lord hey man but again the people a lot of many of many so-called believers just don't have that anointing that hunger that thirst for Lord I want you to counsel me want you to give me more understanding more wisdom Lord I want oh lord help me I need your help Lord people don't feel they need any help that's the truth oh I believe the message do you know what they're not recognizing they need help - what for poor and how can I be helped by increased thing hey man and how does how can I have more faith by hearing the word they come by hearing hearing by the word amen grace of God brother sister let's put the emphasis on the importance of hearing the word let's come on let's focus on what's important he's not going to church no people go to church period and thence the prophet of God said the first one in church is the devil yes he's here to control your thoughts he's here to influence your thinking in the going forth of the word and the proud of God said in the preacher of the word is over casting out spirits yeah huh listen let the Holy Ghost catch the spirit from you Amen don't think oh I got no worries with that I got no worries really because I don't know I'm not dealing with the devil Devils not dealing with me oh yes he is if you think that that with it that's proof that the devil is dealing with you cuz he made you think that oh yeah oh I don't have to worry through this I know he worried I didn't say you had to worry but let's be conscious of it we are more than conquerors hey man because Jesus laid down his life and he did this needed that he got the victory so our faith is in Christ well we're not going to ignore that you don't ignore it hey man but yet there are those that don't even stop the thing that's the truth they don't feel that they have anything wrong or they don't have any weakness you do there's not one here but you've got a weakness amen you better ask God to reveal it to you oh yeah what's your spiritual weakness Lord what is it what's my problem there that you got to deal with it you want to put me on my guard amen oh yeah there's not one you're even a prophet of God even the prophets have weaknesses oh yeah I don't care I don't care what they are who they are they got a weakness amen and brother I'll tell you this when Jesus was made flesh the word was made flesh brother he was made flesh for such a way so what he would experience those weaknesses yeah yeah the prophet of God said Jesus had a headache he had a headache yeah he had a headache he was bothered in his head he express eat mother he was tempted in all points like as we are yet without sin amen there's not one thing that we're tested with her tempted with but he experienced it amen he knows her brother he's here to help us amen he's there what for to get preeminence in a life that's worthy of the gospel hey man god help us and he said he was praying before he went into the end of the sermon and he said Lord I pray Lord these are taking this text he looked for Dean and he said is placed upon my heart he said to send out across the nation's and not just band Tabernacle this time but though but the world and he said for the people and he said that they might know he so what type of life is required of them to live a man and now it's not random tabernacles but it's all believers around the world he said that you might know what type of life to live and this is why God laid this on his heart is your life worthy of the gospel if it's worthy of the gospel you're surrendering to the word 24 hours a day a man you're running to the leadership of the Holy Ghost in your heart in your soul 24 hours a day amen and he said that they might know what type of life is required of them to live and he says so many people that have asked me is a Christian life a life of church service he said helping the poor the needy or is it a constant member he said is it loyalty to the church such questions and he said father he said the correct answer could may the correct answer come tonight through these words as we make in indifference he said to bring them these words to bring them to the people in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and he read the scripture that we read a man I don't know if you got a highlighted in your Bible I've got a marked in mine here but I probably brought it right here concerning Luke 14 verse 16 to 24 he said did you notice this scripture he said did you notice he said there was three pulls a man everything God does every ministry there's three three poles like three is perfection five is grace 7 is completion there's seven Church ages amen they're seven seals seven there's seven that amen three is perfection father son Holy Ghost repent baptize in the name in water and then be baptized with the Holy Ghost amen see three is perfection God does this God does this and so on so he said did you notice there were three pools or three turns he said in this invitation to the marriage supper of the Lamb yeah and he said when they went out first and called them he said to where that they were bidden to come they didn't do it amen so they're without a healing campaign they went out he should to get the blind in the alt and still there were room so he said he went out and compelled the good the bad the indifferent to come amen it was the evening time of the three pools a man and they refused to come and he said they went out a healing campaign and it still it didn't bring them to the word no see the prophet of God was told when he was given those signs now I said get the people to believe amen because he was going to he what he was going to get their attention to his ministry to the signs and to the wonders to this gift and to that gift and then he was to get them to what if the third pole was to take him to the word but they didn't want the word as I said as one one evangelist told the prophet of God stop preaching those things stop preaching they stop preaching that and the Prophet got yeah well of well-known evangelist hard to believe but he did yeah the prophet of God said no he said the the evangelist said let the pastors do it and the prophet of God said brother he said the pastors are not doing it so he said somebody got to do it amen so there are three polls right here and he sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready the first poll a man but they turned it down so then they were sent out to get the others and his servant come and said it showed his Lord these things and then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in either the poor the main the halt and the blind the second poll and they came a man and then they said they said still there's room maybe that's why you're here hey man that's the truth because brother the prophet went out and he was trying to get him to do this trying to get him do that and they wouldn't do it first pull a man then he said go out and call these call these the second poll and they came finally he said listen go out into the highways and byways and compel them to come in that my house may be full brother was that why where God found you out to the spiritual religious highways and byways a man yeah to bring to bring that finally to bring you to the soft marriage supper of the lay the third pole and brother I believe that we are in the third pole yeah we're in the final phase of the reveal word as I have already preached that the open the seals was what to bring us to the third pole of rapturing day by the grace of God why not to let us now to know what or show us this they open the mystery of God what is the revelation of the mystery of God it is to show us what it's this it's this this is over this is done this is fulfilled that's fulfilled where are we now Lord we're right here at the resurrection rapture there was Luther there was Wesley there was the Pentecostals now it's the bright age my brother according to scripture we're in the end according to the scripture it's finished according to the scripture the Bible tells us it says when you see this this and this look up what and when you're looking up most are just looking into the message I'll tell you if you're looking into the message the way you should by the Holy Ghost you're looking up spiritually you're looking up to the change you're learning by the change a new to me as there were a new creature a new body a glorified body in the rest in the rapture praise the Lord come on Saints as I said I trust it you've got the witness within yourself that you have been resurrected amen and I trust we got the got the confidence within ourselves that we're moving to the change of our bodies the rapture that we've been caught up spiritually now we're being caught up physically and where is paradise it's not out there now where is paradise it's in the eternal heavens amen we say that God Hamdi paradise little brother they all went off no no no and the prophet of God said where where are those that it went up where the Old Testament Saints he should they error right there and revelation there the souls beneath the altar amen is it one of the seals there that was open and there was there was beneath the altar he said that's the Old Testament st. yeah because what is it world they call him for to call him for God to go down and deliver the hundred and forty-four thousand he man Lord will want you avenge us he said that's not the bride the bride is not calling for vengeance Easter Jews they're Jews and what they're calling God to go Lord won't you want to avenge us he said and and for God to come down and do this to Israel do that to Israel amen and we know that the Spirit of God is moving from the Gentiles to the Jews oh yeah I know that you know that because we're hearing this we're hearing that I'm almost on a daily basis amen and brother what's going on in Israel and now and brother it's been 17 years and 70 well 71 years really since what since since Israel became a nation God said he was going to bring Israel back restore Israel God has done it it's 70 years yeah like I told you was 1948 and I told that all that happened in 48 and not even the World Council churches started 48 and this was started that was starting 48 and and I said Israel became a nation in 1948 and I reminded you too that your pastor was born in 1948 yeah so I'm the same age as Israel praise the Lord well that's good to be identified with that and the prophet of God started his worldwide ministry in 94 in national international ministry in 48 yeah amen thank God that he was in Newfoundland amen thank God the pillar fire was a Newfoundland a man and it was 25 miles from where I was living but I would I bet the time I would say I was only about five years old yeah just just a young boy not knowing that a prophet was was he'd get in Gander yeah I was just 25 miles east of the end praise the Lord not knowing that that many years later or maybe fifty years later that I would come to the revelation that god it's been a prophet amen brother brother Baron said in this scripture he said you notice there was three poles and three turns of it and he said when they were now first and called to them that were bidden to come they didn't do it so they went out a healing campaign and they went out to get the blind and the alt and he says still there was room so they went out and compelled the good the bad and indifferent that they should come here praise the Lord so brother sister you read another parable of this or something order of it and he said and I drew this subject is your life worthy of the gospel and he said Jesus air is sane man has always tried to make excuses not to receive God's word of his invitation and he said though it be firmly proven to them that it's is supper and is invitation but man is constantly making excuses and brother I've experienced that over the over the over the years man is making excuses not to do this not to do that I don't have to do this I don't have to do that I don't think the Lord mind says I don't think the Lord minds that where's one time brother there was no question no what so ever as I told her brother one time and when there I felt that they were they were sort of I won't say what it was but like I said I did I did call them on the phone and I told my so you should not have done that I said because I said you're going to cause the people to do this you've got to cause believers to do that and so on and because they're what they're making light of this teaching of the Prophet make light of that teaching of the Prophet and the finally they're going to go out and they're going to they're going to compromise further on this teaching compromise on that teaching amen and I said brother don't do that and forgot that thought but I was going to say but and I've had to correct other others as well for things that they were making making they were compromising on and I said you're going to cause believers I said to get to get not not to take a stand eisah for that teaching I said you shouldn't have done it I said don't do that and I said no I said you're going to cause believers I said many of them are going to compromise I said he won't stay with the work and brother even the day this man there's many compromising you know why because it only put the emphasis on on a certain teaching or doctrine of the Prophet not necessarily on a life that is worthy of the gospel you can believe the doctrine but still not have a life that's worthy of the gospel that's right as I said it's just the Creed sure brother God's looking looking for a life that's worthy of the gospel not to make excuse don't make excuses and he said but man it's constantly making excuses and he said if you ready something out of Matthew 22 he says you'll find that the excuses were all made there and also and he should I went back into all ages I went back into the age and said a man bid and add a vineyard and he said we find that at that parable how he said his servants to collect from this vineyard a man but what did they do they killed the servants they didn't respect them and to find he said I'll send my son and he killed the son because he was going to inherit all things yeah they're killing the servants now around the message yeah you can kill the son the inflow of the Sun and then surely it's not a lot you haven't got a life that's worthy of the gospel please let's be sure just make our calling election sure listen let's be sure that you're not going to have a wrong spirit and a wrong attitude toward toward this brother toward that sister no keep your spirit right keep your attitude right amen and then you don't condemn them probably gosh you don't find fault with them because there goes you but for the grace of God he said the King finally said his son and when his son came we find out they said this is an heir and he said we will kill him and then we'll have all things brother yeah any ministry is going to stay with the word they're going to kill that ministry kill the influence of that ministry be careful yes you'd be guilty of kept of crucifying Christ and he said but the king he said he sent forth and he slew those murderers and said and burned their City a man god help us he's there's nothing left he said after mercy is spurned one thing left is judgment and he said you step over the boundaries of mercy then there's only one thing left and that is judgment and we find man has done that in all ages a man he spurned mercy and God sent judgment he said what is the problem he said it is modern thinking excuses he said they laughed and scorned Noah according to their modern thinking it didn't it wasn't the way they wanted it so they made excuses in the days of Noah they made excuses in the days of Moses they made excuses in the days of Elijah and they made excuses in the days of Christ and they make excuses today and they are not experience of four years you talk this and talk that and there make excuse make excuse make excuse or do try to explain it away and all God have mercy brother as I said this is not but not the generation of believers that I first came to the message but 1966 does get their belief true believers are getting fewer and fewer and fewer some are getting more religious but less spiritual other things to do they find excuses a May I'm gonna have to skip some of this cuz it didn't want to continue with it he said now he said the same thing in the natural applies to the spiritual that he said if we as an irritants of eternal life and we hear the gospel and know that is true and we reject it and refused to do it or to listen to it we take well spirits on you he said it's the mark of the beast if you hear the gospel and reject it and refuse to listen to it he said you take on the mark of the beast see God Elvis he said you're a Richard miserable poor blind and naked and don't know the mark of the beast oh yeah that's why they put Christ down somebody there's going to be a mark of the beast it's going to come someday let me tell you it's already calm as soon as the Holy Ghost begin to fall the mark of the beast begin to take place that's true see you only have two things and one of them has accepted take the seal of God to reject it takes the mark of the beast the Bible said all that was not sealed by the seal of God took the mark of the beast now he said you see the mark of the beast if we talk about it in the future he said as when it's going to be made manifest when you realize it's what you've already done and so is the Holy Spirit he said it's to be manifested when we see the Lord Jesus coming in glory and he said then he said it'll be manifested to see those who rejected it a man will be left out he said didn't jesus said the Virgin's went out to me Christ some of them fell asleep the first watched a second a third the fourth the fifth the sixth the seventh but in the seventh watch then came forth the sound behold the bridegroom cometh go out to meet him and the ones that were sleeping awaken all the age back to Pentecost woke up a man he said from the seventh age the senator change all the way back through they woke up and those that were in this a church age he said living they were changed and they went in and at the very time they went in the sleeping words in come and said we want to buy it buy some of your oil but they said we just got enough for ourselves go to them and sell it that sell it and while they were trying to receive this oil the bridegroom came and they missed the rapture amen god help us that will not realize too late remember the Provost said they're virgins yeah but are not wise virgins so are we wise virgins so that we're going to stay with the word amen are we worried as virgins that we're looking for the resurrection the rapture and believing we're entering into the revelation of it more and more and more till one day we experience the reality the revelation becomes flesh god help us brother grace that will be wise virgins and not foolish now the way I'm not saying that like I said the wise I don't believe the wise virgins are lost but they go to the great tribulation lay down their lives god help us that will have the extra oil that we need in this hour to stay with the world amen the extra oil of Revelation by the grace of God he said those sleeping mergers are now trying to receive Pentecost trying to receive the Holy Ghost and don't the people realize that it will not happen according to the Word of God and while they were trying to come back the bridegroom come and took away the bride amen and they were cast into outer darkness for judgment because they rejected their invitation and all peoples are bidden to come God in every age as sent out is like it's been rejected and now today is no different from the any other day don't put it off till next year don't put it up to the next revival or we'll get into some thoughts on revival don't put it off to the next revival might be the next sermon yeah don't get your revelation of revivals confused can we think oh there's gonna be a revival in like that like that like that no no the bride revival is different we'll get into it you're not gonna recognize the right the bride revival the bride will the brighter catch the revival thereby to be part of the revival hey ma'am my brother his name is not gonna be like the Pentecostal revival or the Methodists or the or the or the or the Lutheran amen no I'll share some thoughts with you honor and some quotes so he said that's the our today is the day of salvation and now he said the time has come that she rejects it and she's bored in the air with it all that she'll never hear it no he said listen Israel walked day and night by the pillar of fire and when the pillar of fire moved they moved the same thing he said Martin Luther saw it and what did he do he come out of Catholicism then he said Wesley saw it and moving away from there he said what did the light do it move right on again and he said Pentecost saw it and what did they do he said they moved out of Wesley Nazarenes and so forth and he said they built a little fence called it where oneness where Trinity were the United and all this what did he do God move right on out of it because the Pentecostal revival started and out of after three years out of that out of the Pentecostal revival came the United Pentecostal revival they went off oneness what made them different from the regular Pentecost they were oneness they didn't believe in the Trinity yeah and the Trinity they went off the other way yeah brother no no he the prophet of God said even even the United Pentecostals he said their revelation of the God it is not right yeah we know there's one God there's not three persons and so on but he said even they in their revelation he said it's just just not exactly according to the scripture amen he said God moved right on out of it that's right and that is the absolute truth he moved out of the Pentecostal revival he moved out of the United Pentecostal revival a man and God moved on I died I've got some notes there but then I've had years ago that I preached on yeah well we will leave that right now brother he's gone into the bright revival hey man he said we've got to follow everyday we got to follow every hour of the day every step of the way he said we got to be led by the Lord Jesus Christ if we don't we take an organizational life and whether I tell you a lot of believers got an organizational life they really got a denominational spirit on them you know they live like denomination act like denomination talk like denomination oh my god Elvis he said a leg that doesn't follow Christ daily is not worthy of the gospel you got to follow Christ daily his car is Christ in control of your life morning noon and night if Christ in control of your life thought word and deed amen he said they take the world and that don't belong to the Church of the Living God he said when a nod to look to Jesus Christ and you ought to look to Sarah and them of the Old Testament they may God's grace a Christian is to be christ-like a Christian cannot be a Christian until Christ comes into the man the laborer Christ in him then he said it produces the life of Christ of that of that Christ lived and you do the things that Christ did what am I talking about he's a personal relationship to Christ what is it is your life worthy of the gospel he's I'm trying to lay that background there to show you that man and women who were renowned living the life that was worthy of the gospel grace it's a personal relationship with Christ that morning noon and night no matter what it is you can't get away from it if you're doing this you're doing that something comes in your heart it's Jesus he wants to talk to you about it yeah he wants you to talk to him about it see it's a personal relationship Dave man it's real and he's real a man she's just thinking you know it's not 2,000 years ago that he's an historical figure no he's with us now he's in the present tense he's with us and he is in us by grace a man a man a man oh my he said Chris have a personal relationship to God and in order to be a son of God you must become relation to God and he said he must be your father in order for you to be a son and only his sons and daughters are saved not members of a church but sons and daughters the new birth is the only thing that will produce relationship to God he said sons and daughters Amen he said you're burned again your entire nature is changed and you are dead to the things you once thought amen god help us grace Oh My yes I'll let this maybe try to finish with this just some wonderful quotes here he said Jesus of after death for you he was not fussy and when they Schmitt on his face he said he didn't spit back and when they pulled his beard out he didn't pull that there's yeah do we have that spirit yeah are you there ready to flick back at somebody if they if they're a bit negative to you yeah no no you got the Spirit of Christ you want he opened not his mouth just think all that he went through all that he endured and he was God he said he could have called 10,000 angels to destroy the world and set him free but no what would you do well if I could do this and I could do that yeah what would you do and you got the Spirit of Christ you're gonna do what Christ would do oh well well I wouldn't do this I wouldn't do it wait a minute he was he was tested through his life he was tested at Calvary and you're tested in your everyday living it might be an individual it might be issues and my certain things that happened in your life and you're tested just to see oh you're going to act and react you're tested to see oh you're going to respond and you can respond as Jesus did now you want to spawn with the Spirit that Jesus had amen look look how we responded to Judas he wasn't he didn't he didn't get mad and you know get ready to kill him and ready to do this you you look what you did you did you betrayed me barely beat some silver well I tell you a lot of believers today or between them for less than 30 pieces of silver might be one piece of silver they've betrayed Jesus more yeah god help us or they betray Jesus oh my what if God asks you to sacrifice a relationship with somebody will you do it yeah because sometimes our relationship with Jesus cut cuts off our relationship with with somebody else it's not that you want it it's just it just happens but your Lord not my will don't be done yeah if you don't allow that then your life is not worthy of the gospel no brother oh yeah prophet said it he did yes he did yeah and not only that Jesus preached it why well Lord well Jesus said come follow me well he says suffer me first to go bear bury my father he's led the dead bury the dead Lord North surely you you got a more better spirit than that Lord you know you should let the man go back and to attend his father's funeral most people don't even stop to think about that he said no he said let the dead bury the dead he said come follow me yeah another one said Oh master let me go back and say goodbye to my family and friends and so on and so on Jesus said what no don't do that come follow me he's just not willing to protect this and this and this for my sake it's not worthy of me what your life is not worthy of the gospel see no wonder the prophecies you're gonna be surprised who made it and you'll be surprised who didn't make it beer doubt but he didn't pull though there's they slapped him but he didn't slap them he prayed for them walked on humbly he was an example of humility are you he was full of faith why he noticed words wouldn't couldn't fail and he said he so lived by the word till he became the word Oh God he said let me all bow my both hands to God before this audience let me live like that let this word shall become that knee and as this word is the same thing let my words be this word let the demerit a shove my heart let him be in my heart and on my mind Tyus Commandments upon the posts of my intelligence tie them upon the posts of my heart and let me just see him and he said when tasted when temptations Rises let me see Christ and he said when things go wrong let me see him and when I get ready and the enemy he said tries to make me hangry let me see Jesus and what he'll do amen he said he was so much in the word tell him and the word become the self same thing you you see there is if I don't find it I'll tell you what the Provost said concerning the rich young ruler they see even though they Christiane's they love to hold to the creeds and he said a man that's going to be a success in this day has to go with this modern trend of thinking and let me say that good and clear he said you're going to be a success you have to go with the modern thinking of this day and he should they go down and say oh isn't he a darling isn't he wonderful he can just there stay there so straight and he never keeps us over 15 minutes not me listen and he said our pastor he said don't always brawl us out about these things he says shame on that pastor any man that can stand in the pulpit and look upon the sin of this day and not cry out he said there's something wrong with that man he's not worthy of the gospel that he claims to be preaching amen that's true god help us he said did to say he said where the carcasses there the Eagles will be gathered together Eagles he said not buzzards Eagles he said where the sloppiest and the carrion and he's sure then the buzzards gather but where the fresh clean meat is Eagles gather certainly where the word is eagle food they'll gather so they don't come to the spiritual feast that they are invited to do you believe that God has give give America an invitation the last 15 years to a great revival to a spiritual face did they come no sir than to reject to come is that life worthy the gospel though they call themselves that no he said what it where is your treasures do you want to be some great somebody and he said if you are your nobody he says you get to a place till you don't want to come to me a great somebody you want to be a humble little servant of Christ that's the way out a man he said I hear something brother venom you better back up on that statement he said the people are not neurotics he said this people is not neurotics they're only educated but the prophet of God said they are educated new writings and he said I want to ask you a question please explain their actions of today if they're not neurotics he said tell me what makes them act like they do if they're not neurotics he said every fellow is pulling for his denomination he is greedy he said when the gospel of Jesus Christ can be preached and proved the God of heaven in the form of his pillar of fire wave over the people so that Jesus Christ is in the last session of his coming he said giving them the last sign a man he said yes they are neurotics highly educated degrees college he said we put some time on it more time on education and educating our children he said to algebra biology then we have to the Bible and Jesus Christ and the churches endorsed it when the Bible condemns it he said his the ministry neurotics yes educated neurotics amen I was looking for a certain quote there with me by the battlements referring to the rich young ruler and that he was putting the emphasis on money yes he said he was he was a religious man and to a certain extent he was spiritual jesus said have you kept this and kept this and kept this yes he said I've kept that except my youth she's my youth he said I kept it all and that's more than I you can see here I can say but brother Brown said what did he do he said he was putting the emphasis more on he said on the letter of the word he was putting more dances on on natural family than on spiritual and he said he didn't want he didn't want to change his relationship with his natural family no no he didn't want he said the gospel to interfere with his relationship with his natural family he wanted to maintain that and that's why that he refused when Jesus said come follow me because there's anything you have a separate problem is your natural family why because the emphasis is now put on your spiritual family a man not that you're going to despise your natural family it's not that you all you didn't want nothing to do with them no no no but you're gonna give preeminence more premise to your spiritual than to your natural and he brings that out in this in this message here somewhere something one time of a life worthy let's compare the life of st. Paul he said to the rich young ruler and he said the same light struck both man both had the same invitation from Jesus Christ he said is that right and he said they both were was well trained in the scriptures they were both theologians and Jesus told the rich young ruler keep the commandments and he said I have done this from my youth and he was a trained man and so was st. Paul both were well trained in the scriptures and he said both of them had the word and he said one added from a knowledge and the other one added the germ of life and he said that light flashed across in front of Paul and he said Lord who are you and he said I am Jesus he said earlier I am he said he was ready and he said the light struck bold man and he said one was Dermott eyes and the other was not and he said that's the way it is today there's a church spiritual and a church natural and he said the rich man and his excuse he said he couldn't do it he said he was too weighed down with too many friends of the world and he said he didn't want to quit associating and that's what's the matter with a lot of people today here's a lot that don't want to cut out relationships they didn't want to do want to lose this didn't want to lose that you know there's sometimes God will let you go over here let you do this late to do that there's other two other times that God wants to cut it because he knows that the emphasis is not what it should be amen that that that that relationship is more important than their relationship with Jesus yeah and that's when he wants to cut it nothing against them it's it's his see creig deceit his sons his daughters yeah he said he was too weighed down with too many friends of the world and he didn't want to quit associating and that's what's the matter with a lot of people today no you got to give more premise to Jesus a man when it comes to your relationship with others you let him control it you let him control you nor your will be done not mine oh yeah you pray for others I pray for them and so on oh yeah but then move on by the grace of God amen it says he had the rich man's life though he was a believer could you call that kind of a life amongst the intellectuals and entertainments he had to hear the entertainment and a beggar laying at his gate down there he gave his toast and talked about his great faith he had in God before daylight the next morning before the Sun come up he was in hell there's your intellectuals he said when Paul the light struck him he first took all his knowledge and he got away from the intellectual group and he walked in the spirit of Jesus Christ glory to God but as smart as he was he never even used big words thank God I'll finish with this quote now he the only way to live a life worthy is select Christ and his word which he is the word let Christ His Word reflect itself so perfect in you till God vindicates what he said in the word for Christ died that he might present himself before God a sacrifice and it turned back in the form of the Holy Spirit to reflect himself through his people to carry on his work reflecting himself through you to fulfill his promise word in those future days like John the Baptist heard when he heard Christ come amen and Christ walked that into the water and John said behold the lamb of God nobody else saw it but John saw it that light coming down from heaven like a dove and a voice saying this is my son in whom I am pleased to dwell Jesus walked out into the water Emmanuelle before a preacher that was supposed to be a radical but he walked out into the water before the people and said I want to be baptized of you amen grace of God he was the message of the hour we are he said we are the message of the hour amen so brother sister god help us let go let God have his way to produce a life that is worthy of the gospel amen amen there's also some thoughts in this message on souls in prison now amen oh yeah it's serious brother oh but the word the word is not going to do this two words not going to do that oh yeah if you're gonna believe it if one thing the word is going to accomplish in you is to is to kill the ol nature kill it yeah he wants to kill the old nature but it down amen so that your new nature's got the preeminence and brother just think well what kind of a sacrifice is that to let gold the old nature what kind of a sacrifice is that they give pre Emma's to the new nature grace hey man sorry to keep you so long but the will of God be done god bless you let's sing at Calvary amen years I
