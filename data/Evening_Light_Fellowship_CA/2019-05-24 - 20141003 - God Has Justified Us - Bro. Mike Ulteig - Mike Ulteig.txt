moment well it's really nice to be here with you and Newfoundland or Newfoundland depending on how you want to say it but it all means the same thing and it's really an honor and a privilege to be here and appreciate the invitation by but your pastor brother Geralyn and brother Mark and just been having some good fellowship in the last couple days and I guess this is my first time in this area I didn't even know you as part of Canada until I went to my weather map and was looking up the weather and it I was trying to put in st. John that kept coming up kept coming up Canada wouldn't say Newfoundland I couldn't figure out what was going on so I don't know if you're part of Canada or of Canada's part of you because I think y'all were in existence before they ever got civilized so then I got a little history lesson by brother Gerald today and and I found out y'all was the first this and the first that and the first this and the first that and so I guess this is the first place that that some of the explorers trying to find the other side of the world came to first and and I think this was a stopping off place for there for the early pilgrims and and those that were migrating over to the United States and and I understand you even got on a little settlement of the Vikings so you got a little bit of everything here but I pray the Lord will bless our services and it'll be something that'll be helpful to you because the time that we're we're living and we need you know I thought about Peter when he wrote second Peter and and he knew it wasn't going to be very long before he was going to leave the scene and he was looking how when the Lord had prayed over him and how that he knew that he was going to be bound and even knew the death that laid ahead of him and he said there was one thing that he he wanted to make sure that the people were established in the present-day truth and we want to be established in this truth we want to we don't want to be insecure we want to know who we are or come from we don't have to worry about where we're going because if you know where you come from you know where are you going Jesus never said you all are going to hell he said I know where you come from your daddy's the devil so if you knew where you come from then you know where you're going and so we came from God and and he said I come from God and I'm going back to God so then we that's what this message came to do because Paul said in he said there will come a day that you'll know even as you're known and I remember years ago brother Bisco was preaching and he said that were known he's talking about that it was to be a like a like a professor and he was teaching us students and then one day the students knowledge comes to the same level as the as the teacher that knowledge becomes the same and so and how that God knew us down through the church ages they could never they could never know how that they were known as God knew them they had a partial reach into that but under the opening of the word and and under the endtime message we found out now how that we were in him an attribute before before creation was he didn't create us we we came out of him because anything that's created has a has an end and so we weren't really created but we we were in a sense of creation but we came out of him because we were part of him because that's his eternal life and eternal life never has a beginning and an end sometimes you have to get you know I know that you've had some videos and so sometimes when you preach the first time someplace people have to kind of get adjusted to you and you know they want to see how you part you here we're kind of built buckle you got on what kind of shoes you wear and what kind of hubcaps you got and what your wife looked like you know usually that has a lot to do with what you are you know and they won't everybody get settled down and kind of get used to you then he can you can kind of preach but I'm 72 years old and I guess it was nineteen nineteen seventy three I was an atheist and my mother-in-law was a backslidden Pentecostal and she had come into the message just knew and the friend of hers that come out of Pentecost into the message and they'd been talking and she's rededicated her life and and so the Lord spoke to her and told her to come over to to our house and to talk to me and enter her daughter which my wife and dream is Janet and and so in two weeks I was saved in my in my home and from that day Lars never been it's never been the same you know we have our ups and downs as Christians and sometimes we get into the dark valleys and depression and and but you know there's one thing I find when you've had a true experience with God you might you might get disappointed and you know a preacher he always when he gets disappointed he he's gonna quit preaching and go find a bench someplace and said he never thinks about quit going to church but he just gonna the thread is I'm gonna quit preaching and I'm gonna find me a bench to sit down in the back somewhere and let off the pressure you know but I can't I can't think of one time in my life since I was saved that I ever desire to go back out in the world there there's nothing there's nothing there there's nothing but vanity and emptiness and sadness and disappointments and and so in 1973 when it was converted there in my dining room with my wife me and her both and we were baptized and come into the message and so this is the only thing I've known as a Christian and I've explored other things I've not lived in a box and I'm not I'm not a an ostrich type that when I would hide my head in the sand and be afraid of the be afraid of science and be afraid of other religions that I might see something real and but you know I've looked at other things and there's just nothing there there's nothing there every every religion every religion has a founder even even Buddha at the founder of of the Buddhists and and then when you have a founder they they they live off the experiences of that founder and then they they build supernatural tales around the experience that they that that founder had my boot in he said under a tree and and then they they build and fabricate things around that and then the founder dies and and they live off of that experience that that founder had with God and they never really have their own and I was reading that out of HG Wells outline of history and but he said you know Christ was not a founder he was the seed of Christianity [Music] so brother branham is not the founder of the gospel he was a prophet that Christ that God sent to you and I a mouthpiece we're not following a founder we are we are part of the scene we're not we're not following anything in that aspect we are that life made manifest and Jesus great power when he defeated Satan here when he came out of the wilderness and and Satan came and challenged him he defeated him because he knew who he was because it had been revealed to him but Brown said one day that he was reading in the scriptures and he read I'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption nor a soul to stay in hell and it was revealed he knew that was him it spoke of him and that's where he defeated Satan because he wasn't insecure a person that's insecure when you're challenged by the enemy you feel that you have to prove something sometimes as young Christians when we go back to work we try to prove her a Christian and so when sank and challenged Jesus to prove who he was he didn't have to prove who he was because he knew who he was and as soon as you accept the challenge of the enemy and you step one foot forward to try to prove who you are he's already got you right there because when you're trying to prove who you are to somebody there's a there's a there's a there's an insecurity in there you're not only trying to prove it to them but you're trying to prove it yourself so we don't have to prove to anybody that were Christians we don't have to prove to anybody that we're born again so what God is wanting to do through this message is to establish you that you know who you are and not just by revelation but you know experience experience has a way of making the word real in your life when you hear he's a healer and you see people let her heal that's that's one thing you can believe that but when you experience it experience makes the word alive it's a it's an inner woman fabric of your Christian experience your whole life so brother Brown said you can receive the Holy Ghost without sensation but he never said you could receive without an experience there has to be an experience in your life some kind of an experience between you and God alone you don't have to prove to anybody who you are and God wants us to know because this is the time this is the time more than any other time in the history of Christianity or mankind that it says that we will know even as we are known so then the knowledge of God and the knowledge of the sons of God come up to an equal basis in that knowledge when Jesus said if you two know me you know known the father that's a progressive understanding as they as they walked with Christ and listened to his teachings and and then watched how the dead were raised in the sick were healed and if if their knowledge would have progressed their experience with him they were to realize to recognize that he was God in flesh he said if you don't know me you'd have known the father and that knowledge was a progressive knowledge so it all spoke of this in time because brother Branham and talking about st. John 1420 he said in that day you know that I'm in the father and the father and me I anoon you and I well down through the church ages the first part of st. John 14 why if you didn't know me you don't know him the father that was the deity of Christ that's been released and its fullness down through the church ages but Saint John 14:21 released in its fullness until the evening time he said that's this day so they had a partial revelation but by the opening of the word and then because it's time God anointing that word in your heart now it's it's not just recognizing the deity of Christ it's not just only recognizing the the the Godhead and being able to place that but this is the day of a manifestation of the sons of God we're not waiting for sons of God because John said now are we the sons of God but we're waiting for the unveiling and in that unveiling that's not just to the world but it's unveiling to you and it could only come through the opening of the word and god of inspiring that word into your hearts and I think a lot of what we're waiting for right now is the inspiration to strike the word and God controls that however much God leads your soul to believe that's how much that's how much faith that you can have and that's how much power that you can have and so there's things that we know he says when when she recognizes her position then she'll be gone well we recognize it in the word itself but there's something that God is not release to uni through faith he said we'd have accepted the great truths of the Bible but too many it's not made real because it hasn't been quickened so faith is the substance of things hoped for and hope is an intellectual faith an intellectual is not in a negative sense but intellectual faith means that you've seen something you've read something and you believe it you hold it in faith but that's not the faith of God it's when God quickens that hope and it becomes a substance it becomes a reality now there's no question there's no wrestling it's actually just put away and now you're moving on to something else you didn't actually forgot about it because it's real it's something that you hold on to so there's there's things that God has brought to us through the whole in other word but he hasn't quickened it into us yet because he waits for that time to bring the inspiration on the word that sent us now that we believe that we're walking into and we know that we're standing right on the on the threshold you open that door and there's a threshold right there and we're standing right at the threshold of the changing of time into eternity you know the judgments falling into this world our desires is as Peter to be established in this present day truth not in a dogmatism and not like an ostriches I just believe what the Prophet tells but by the inspiration of God into our hearts that this word is made real and life to you and me right in the reality of the quickening of the word and may we just stand together and we would just want to open up our Bibles I want to start and Mark or Matthew chapter 5 [Music] this microphone it's got a green light is it did is it just not on and on my microphone you got a kickstart - Lord we'll get started okay but we're going to start in Matthew we're gonna start in Matthew 25 are 25 in Matthew 5 in verse 17 through 20 and then what I would like to do if it's the Lord's will we want to I want I want to take Enoch as the as the bride that is to be translated not to resurrected bride but bride to be translated and then I want to I would like to take know in and to show the connection between the two ministries and then if the Lord permit then we can we can bring into that two third pull if we if the Lord permits that and so I want to start out here in Matthew 5 and the reason why is I want to minister just a little bit on righteousness and kind of get us all in the on the same page and you may have played this before but I'm not going to take a series on unrighteousness but I would like to just to speak because it's very it's very pertinent to Enoch and to Noah and really to all the things but but it'll tie in and so once that we build up a basis of language so to speak then we can refer back to that and it makes it makes sense to us without having to take so much time later on to build up on these words so in in Matthew chapter 5 and this is probably just pretty basic in verse 17 think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets I am not come to destroy but to fulfill for verily I say unto you till heaven and earth pass away one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled so I want you to know that grace did not come at the expense of the law because Christ came to fulfill the law that grace might take effect into our lives but the way that some people preach and believe grace today it come at the expense of the law but it didn't because the law had to be fulfilled and we know it's a law of redemption of what taking place in the Garden of Eden law so Christ didn't come to pronounce some kind of special blessing and and that we'd escaped in him but he come to fulfill the judgments and to pay the penalty and not to destroy the law verse 19 whosoever therefore shall break one of these least Commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall but whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven for I say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees he shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven as we bow our heads Heavenly Father lord I thank you for your mercy and grace and and for your children your people that's gathered here together Lord as they gather at different times all over the world your living body your living organism that you've that you even more feed yourself that you have Tabernacle yourself into the hearts of your children and Lord together we make up a the temple of God individually we make up the house of God in the temple of God and we offer up sacrifices this evening of praising and worship and Thanksgiving and my prayer is Lord that you'd bless each one i bless these services if time goes on and you delay your coming and till the time that you have chosen yes Lord may we worship you until you come and may we be we be found Lord that when your desire was that when the Son of Man would return would he find faith and and Lord we want to have the faith as that that little little woman Lord that was contending continuing for an inheritance with that unjust judge the Lord we are contending for our inheritance as the children of God not contending with you but with the world it would try to withhold it from us but we've become we've become heirs of the world through the righteousness of faith Lord may you feed your your sheep tonight yes Lord as only you can feed on the meat without you we can do nothing and anything that we can do without you is nothing and you promised us in your word that wherever two or three would gather together to be in our presence so you're the center of our gathering tonight so father may you take this take this this evening in each heart each soul and and the voice and the ears may you take it into your control and may you establish us in this present day truth as only you can do we ask this in the precious name of thy Son Jesus Christ amen you may be seated you know we're we're gonna talk on unrighteousness tonight if we can and just kind of go over it a little bit and I know that you probably know a lot about it I and fellowshipping with with brother Mark and and brother Gerald I know that that this church is not probably liked the church that was an auntie you know that was an established church and and when when the church you know the first missionaries was the church so God ever writes another book of Acts you know who the last missionaries are gonna be it's gonna be the church because it says in in acts the eighth chapter that talking about when Paul went through there was really going house to house every house I mean he they must have had a good spy system you know they must have had some Judas's because he knew where to go they knew where to find him and hunt him up and it said in the church was scattered abroad all except the apostles they they stayed there in Jerusalem and it said the church went everywhere preaching the word and then Philip went down to some areas so the church you know preaching does not always stand behind a pulpit but he said preaching the gospel is to make the word work it's to demonstrate the power of the Holy Ghost so they they went out you know and the and the pastor and all the evangelists everybody stayed there in Jerusalem and they didn't run down to the store and start buying modern fashions and electronic gimmicks and games and televisions and computers you know sometimes you're afraid what might happen if the pastor passes away to some churches they just my goodness they start fighting fussing fuming scattered all over the world but but this this the original church when everywhere preaching work because it was a reality it wasn't it wasn't some kind of a social gathering under under a pastor that they had they were looking to in a place their absolute him you know it's good to have true leadership men and women that are borned again of the Holy Spirit and and the life of Christ God working in them but we each we each are offered by God to have our own experience and but it was at that time the church at Antioch was established and then we find that that Barnabas which was a prophet amongst the the early church and he must have been a he must have been recognized as a teacher because they sent him up to Antioch to instruct the church and to bring them deeper into the word and when he went up he went and we know the story he went and got Paul and come over and and and they together they they pastored that church so that church was established that was an established church and it had been established by the Holy Ghost and now Paul and Barnabas had come inspired ministers called of God and they were teaching that church for several years but you know when when Paul and Barnabas took their first missionary journey there was some there were some brothers that come in from headquarters ministers you know and they'd been you know how it is they were they didn't sit under John and Peter and James and and they had credentials they come from headquarters and they'd said under under real men but somehow they didn't have the message just exactly right and when they came down to Antioch and they were preaching and they were anointed and and they had a handle on that word and they'd set they had set up there under under those Holy Ghost filled men and they started teaching you couldn't even get saved till you got the Holy Ghost you know it turned that church upside down here it was men it already had the Holy Ghost already saved but you know this just doctrine come along and all of a sudden they didn't have nothing and that was an established church so we're never so established that Satan can't come in and if he comes in a lot of times you know you'll come in through personalities and and credentials but but we need to look to Christ and to the revealed Word and then if that person speaks he said they knew the early church was not was not a deceived Church they took those apostles that claim to be apostles and they they weren't like like Antioch they tried it with the word and they knew they were false prophets false apostles but they did leave their first love so we don't we don't want to be a church that's not deceived but we've left our love we want the love and the word because we've been promised everything so we in here that at Christ is is speaking and and we notice that first thing is he says that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees these shall in no case enter into the kingdom of God so now one thing that we find here that in order to enter into the kingdom of God and the kingdom of God doesn't come with observation and it's not word early but it's in Word and power and the kingdom of God is the word made manifest because Jesus was standing amongst those Pharisees and they came in it said they demanded that he should tell him when the kingdom of God was to come he says well he said you know the kingdom of God doesn't come with observation you can't see it with the carnal of the natural mind or the natural spirit and he said the kingdom of God is is is among you and he said it's within you but he was talking and it was twofold because the kingdom of God was right in the middle of that group it was among them but the kingdom of God was in Christ because he was that word made first and so the kingdom of God is the word made manifest in every age but it's not recognized by man even though that they can see this now it's me on Jesus if my side comes would he do any more miracles in him well no but you know he breaks the law and so there was a contention they were kind of trying to figure this thing out he says it doesn't come with observation or worldly wisdom but it comes it comes by inspiration so he says you can enter in the kingdom of God without righteousness and now I find that there was a righteousness of the Pharisees and we're not talking about the righteousness of the Pharisees so much in a negative way because we know at that time that they'd been 400 years without the voice of God without a prophet and so they had they had had great champions of faith they'd had two Maccabees they had fought they had they had delivered Jerusalem and they rebuilt a Temple and established the temple worship and we know it wasn't a dead time it was a time of activity and there was a time of great champions of faith but it was 400 years without the voice of God so 400 years without the voice of God and when that time was closing the the priesthood was already in a bad condition because we find Malachi rebuking them and and teaching things to the church that they shouldn't have been teaching so we now we had 400 years without a prophet and we knew it gone it come to a condition that they were they were teaching the Bible and things but but because that they had they had introduced their traditions into it and traditions is is is supposed to be what they thought was spiritual inspiration there was the written law that was given to Moses that he wrote down and then they said that there was an oral law that there was things that God revealed to that he spoke to Aaron so we had a written law and we had an oral law and that oral law was he handed them through the through the high priesthood and through their priesthood and so then then the the ministry or the priesthood had a had a special access to what they called the oral law and then they had the written law now the written law never changed and the problem with the world law it had come to a time that that oral law which was supposed to be inspiration that came from God was contradictory to the written law but the people because it was a time at the after coming to Christ the people valued the Word of God and they were they were they were really applying themselves to the word and because they were they had a lot of questions and the Pharisees couldn't answer all that because they were so busy with their outward showing her prayers and things and not really digging into that word so it that's where the scribes and the lawyers rose up because they were trying to study that word and break it down and look at it and and they devoted their whole life to that to bring the answers to the people and so it had come to a time now that the oral law or or these interpretations of the law now held more weight with the people than the actual written word did but when Christ came he didn't go to oral law or spiritual inspiration he went to the word because the word is the absolute and if God sends anything to anybody it'll be his word because he sent his word to heal him and the saving from their instructor their destruction and so when Antioch had that that infectious disease coming in then they all gave their testimony video it was when James stood up and said and so agrees the prophets I will build again the tabernacle of David referring to the calling to the Gentiles so he said there so we're leaving off they don't have to speak in Qatar they don't have to be circumcised because the question was over the token so God sent the word by inspiration to James and by that word that was the absolute that all the testimony had been confirmed and judged by so if God sends anything he'll send his word and that's what he's sent in his last days he sent his word if he sends anything tonight or tomorrow the next day he'll send his word and when he sends his word he sends it to his children he'll quicken that so now we've got unless that your righteousness would exceed so now and I preached a little message and I call it progressive righteousness or dispensational righteousness because if I go back to Jeremiah 31 and in verse 31 of Jeremiah 31 it says behold the days come saith the Lord that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah see now right here that those that believed in circumcision the Judaizers that had come into Christianity could come right back here and point to this say that promise is to the Jews it's not to the Gentiles so they had had hundreds of years of Gentiles coming in being proselyte 'add and and and swearing that they would believe the law of Moses and then they'd be circumcised they came in as proselytes and so they had hundred years of this so they said in order now to be partakers of this of this new covenant it's given to two Judah it's given to the Jews not to you Gentile so if you want to be partakers of they had they had good word they could go back to I mean they were just not grabbing things out of the air because the Antioch Church was was a was an established church but when they brought those scriptures they could make those things look so real but it distorted what God was doing at that time I've heard people say well you couldn't get the Holy Ghost till you come into this message the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost and it ain't never left but how much how much power that you have you know the Holy Ghost is not waiting pounds is not measured in pounds and ounces and leaders and gallons it's measured in how much revelation has been released in your life and God controls that however much he leads your soul to believe that's how much faith that you can have that's how much power so truly we have more Holy Spirit by the measure revelation that's been released to us but but Luther had a hundred percent for his day because he's bribed when he died he was bribed he he can't be converted on the other side like the Mormons or somebody and he's not going to get the Holy Ghost become bright at a resurrection he's coming up in the resurrection because he is part of that bride so then he had to be bride when he went down or he'll never come up in the bride in that in that resurrection that second coming to Christ so he goes on to say here not according to the covenant that i made with your father's father's in that day and the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt he's referring to the to the to the ten commandments and the law of Moses also included the moral law the Civic law but are the civil law all of the law that was given to Moses was considered the law of Moses it wasn't just the Ten Commandments it was it was all that revelation that God had given to them which my covenant they break though I was a husband onto them saith the Lord but this shall be the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days saith the Lord I will put my law in their inward parts and write it in their hearts and will be their God and they shall be my people so now we've got a promise for a what we called a New Testament or our second covenant the first covenant is based on your ability to perform he's going to Road it out and now you live according to that standard and then he said now that the New Covenant is what I'm gonna do I'm gonna put it in your hearts I'm gonna write it in there so then the New Covenant was not what you were gonna do is what God was gonna do in you God is not calling you to a life tonight that's what the law did that's what the church does it calls you to a life it demands that you live a certain way it calls you to a religious life but God is calling to a life that's in you there's a seed that lays in there and he quickens that and brings it to life and he's calling to a life he doesn't cut he doesn't deal with his outer man he doesn't deal with the spirit he doesn't deal with the second man he comes through that but he's dealing with that inner man because once he has the inner man he's got the whole vessel because that soul that's been born again it brings that whole unit under subjection but man deals with the outside he tries to protocol you know but the gift lays within take a man that's called to ministry well the old school says now you sit down and and you sit under my ministry for a while until you get your doctrine and thing straight and that's fine it says let a novice you know wait on it's gift and then you learn certain protocols how to stand you know how to minister and those things and you start you start with the outside of that vessel but God doesn't do that he's made each of you different we come from different nations so then we with different nationalities and we've got different social upbringing and and God knew word that she was going to be born he know you're the language that you'd speaking he knew the color of your skin he knew all that he knew whether you'd be an introvert or an extrovert he knew whether you'd be a procrastinator or ax or a now person he knew everything about you and he's not trying to change the outer man God reaches past the outer man and he reaches down inside and cultivates the gift so it's not shaping the man on the outside its cultivating and bringing to life that man that's on the inside he said clean the inside of the pack clatter platter first so the laughlin cleans the outside right but it never touched the inside so Paul if we go over to Philippians in Philippians chapter three and just to save a little time Paul goes down as a as a Jew in Philippians chapter three and talks about being born to the tribe of Benjamin and and how that he was circumcised and Pharisee of Pharisees II he goes through he goes through his religious credentials as part of the the original Church we'll say part of Israel because she became to the the treasure chest of God's Word that he called them to be a priest in other words they were to be a priesthood to all the other nations and he poured he poured his word into them and they were to minister his word to all the other nations I think it's called a repository that's where you you deposit something you put your treasure things and so god they were the repository of god's revelation of who he was well he is here's the approach to him and the very ones that held it they were so meticulous in protecting that word and they could copy that word and they could write for Bibles and no air in there they were meticulous but they didn't know what the author had said so when it came time the very people that God had appointed to be the very treasure chest of his revelation rejected him and so it's repeated to get in the end time the church was the repository not just at the revelation but of his own life and when it came down to Laodicea the very ones that was to contain that life put that life from him Paul said to the Jews he said you judged yourself unworthy of eternal life because you put this from you God don't judge man man judges himself by putting forth or receiving sotol now he talks about his life under the law and in verse 7 we pick it up and he says but what things were gain to me those I counted loss for Christ they doubtless and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I've suffered the loss of all things and and that doesn't mean that things was taken from him like it was during the martyrs age he wasn't talking about things that had been taken from him he was talking about things that didn't mean anything to him the loss of all things not what would been taken from him well the church says I can't do this anymore and I can't do that anymore it was it was things that that he lost interest in things that that he once strove for now it meant nothing to him because because Christ had been revealed to him now the first part of Paul's life was striving for righteousness under that law because in Paul was a seed and that seed thirsted for God just as David thirsted for God and Paul thirsted for God and and he taken the avenue of that date to approach God he went to the the repository he went to the vault he went to the bank he he he went to the Pharisees the strictest of the sexes they their whole their whole ministry was to keep the church separated from the world the Sadducees they were Hellenized as they were they were modernizers they were mixing in with the church and been given political favor by the Romans that that it was the Sadducees that became the high priest but but the Pharisees we could call the fundamentalist but yet there was corruption in there but Paul didn't look at the corruption he taken that word and and they say back in those days there was a there was a tradition or a saying that if a man could keep all of the commandments one day for 24 hours that he would bring them aside and Paul longed to see that Messiah because in him was a thirst for God so he sought he sought the presence of God and without righteousness no man could come into his presence and so with all of his heart and all of his strength all the fiber of his body he he pursued God and that righteousness it would bring him into his presence but the closer he got the further away he got he was a driven man and when he found Christ in that Damascus Road and so how wrong that he was it was not what he could do it what God was going to do then he began a journey to set the captives free because he was in prison with him and now he had been loosed now he was going back into the prisons to loose them out of the prison house of religious dogma and Aaron only he could separate the law because he sought that righteousness with all of his heart all of his strength he wasn't a church member he was seeking him many times Luther's parallel to Paul's life the Paul sought him with all his heart and all of his strength and when he saw that he was wrong he was a can you imagine how crushed he was because he loved God so much and saw how so wrong that he was in his approach for that righteousness so he said I counted all those things dung and everything's a loss for Christ because now nothing meant anything but Christ and because that he was a sinner of his life he wanted to bring Christ to the rest of the people that there might be the center of their lives not him he knew that he was an instrument and God was going to use him to sow seed but only God could bring life to that scene but there were sores and there was waters but without God there could be no life just a church member with a new idea of new thought a new revelation the Christianity was more than 9 it was a life of the seed Jesus said if this seed doesn't fall to the ground it remains alone but if it falls to the ground and it fell to the ground what was that scene it was deity wrapped in flesh and on the day of Pentecost that seed came forth in a multiplied form now deity was wrapped in in flesh in a hundred and twenty people in a church that was the seed that went down that came up sons of God made manifest on earth that had been lost down through time and he come to redeem that which was lost now to save if I have if I have something sitting here a glass of water or something in it and it falls and I reach down here while it's falling because if it falls and hits the ground it's going to break bust up so I reach and I stop it I've saved it but I haven't redeemed it I haven't restored it until I place it back from whence it fell that's Redemption this is salvation but it's got to be restored back to its original position to be redeemed God didn't come just to save us he came to redeem us he didn't come to create a new atom race he came to redeem a fallen race Christianity is not built on replacement it's built on resurrection that's where his great power was he said Israel I have created you for my glory now what is his rayul done as a nation as a people for his glory nothing but his great glory was manifested that he scattered into the graves to the nations of the world and he gathered him back in by his own power let it sound to those trumpets and bringing him back he glorified himself by doing what man could not do what a nation couldn't do they couldn't restore themselves they couldn't get their homeland they couldn't get the temple they were in bondage in you and I we're in graves dead in our sins and trespasses and he has created us to glorify himself now what the church can do not what you can do but what he is done in your life because he is a power and resurrection in life [Applause] it's not what you're gonna do it's what he's done in you he's not calling you to a life he's not calling you to a message he's calling to the life that's in you so he goes on to say verse 9 and be found in him not having mine own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith and then he goes on to say that now that word that refers back to what he's already said that is a conclusion I took this car I over hauled the engine I restore dit back new seats new radio back to the original I painted it I put windows sure that I might be able to drive it I did all that that that I might be able to drive it so he says and to be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law in other words the law was based on his performance he said unless your righteousness would exceed the righteousness of the law you can't enter into the kingdom now his life was blameless if I'd had taken the law and I would have examined his life by the by the law he would have been perfect but have been blameless but he still couldn't enter into the holiest of holies he still could not come into the presence of God with that righteousness but there had to be a righteousness that would exceed and he said it's the righteousness of God that which comes from God by the faith of Jesus Christ so then that righteousness comes from God it's not a man it's not of the church it's not of any earthly source but that righteousness comes from God which is the faith of Jesus Christ that why did he want that righteousness why why didn't he just want the cloak of the outside covering of the law why did he want that true license that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his suffering and being made conformable unto his death being made conformable unto his death in Philippians 2 you read verse 7 of chapter t says but made faint itself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross so now if the scripture tells me to take up the cross and follow him and Paul says that I might be made conformable on his death to be conformed to his death not to be crucified not nailed but he humbled himself you know what humility means to submit yourself not in timidity but not my will I will that was the true humility of Christ is that he humbled his will to the will of God in his life he wanted to have children he wanted to have a family because the Indian was the attributes of God and God wanted to have children but he he suffered those things because he knew what is calling he knew is a creature of time he knew what he was called he knew what the finish was and he humbled himself he submitted himself to the will of God not my will but thy will even to the cross that he submitted his own life into the hands of God so what is true humility is not how humble and timid that you can be in all holy let me open the door for you true humility is to give God the preeminence his word preeminence even when it's contrary to your own will and desires that's the cross and he said that my life might be made conformable to the life of his death to the cross that I might submit my will to his will that's true humility and humility doesn't come without a crushing doesn't come without chastisement doesn't come without experience it comes from knowing him in a relationship not knowing about him but falling sick falling down and him coming and picking you up and delivering you from a prison house of unbelief and doubt that many have fell into the snares of Satan and fell away from the way of truth trying to find truth trying to find peace they didn't have an absolute they didn't have an experience so they went back looking for something else but the scripture says there ain't nothing else there's no other sacrifice there's no other hope and to turn him down and go for another sacrifice there is no other sacrifice there's no other blood that pays Redemption there's no other way into heaven except through Christ there's no accepting accepting his life in his death in his resurrection and God has accepted him so now we find that there's to righteousness one which is of God and one which is a man in Christ that unless that your righteousness exceeds the righteousness then he goes on he says you know the law said don't commit adultery and Paul did blameless but he says I say unto you if you looked upon a woman and lusted after her in your own heart you already committed adultery so now he was bringing it to a higher order of righteousness because now there was something that caused you to sin and you can harness that person you can harness your temper but when the right circumstances come and it's Unleashed what you need to do is be rid of it and only God can take that you can harness your impatience you can sit there inside tapping but you can come to the place that you sit and and you look also patient on the outside but on the inside you're running up and down and you're stomping your feet you know I've watched people that live in sin sometimes and they come into the church and the Holy Spirit comes through the ministry and strikes that and they come out they get mad but you know after a while they can sit there and they look at him and he can come right to their house right to their doorstep and you know man especially in this message just come under so much self-control you can just look that preacher right now I'd never never bad as I it's kind of like a child when he tells the first lie oh my that poor thing you know it's written from his head just told but after he's been caught he begins to learn he learned how he got caught so then when he starts to grow after a while you can't tell when he's lying and when he's you know it's like it's like the AIDS virus they've come up now with with uh not so much an antidote but they come up with a concoction that you can you can drink this and so it puts the AIDS virus kind of in submission not that it's dead or or dormant but then the outside activity of the body now you look healthy so in these areas where you used to go where they were where that AIDS virus was they look like zombies dark eyes and skinny and losing weight and just look horrible but now you go in those communities they look healthy but now the virus is spreading three times faster so when that opening of the word then they learned don't cut your hair you need to wear dresses man don't go to the bar don't go to pool hall and they begin to outwardly late look healthy but inwardly they have been converted its a deceiving age and that that virus is it's very smart you know where it goes to it goes to the white blood cells and the white blood cells is the immune system that's the Holy Ghost the immune system of the body is the Holy Spirit the body of Christ and it doesn't just go to the immune system it doesn't just go to the white blood cells but it goes to the memory system that that white blood cell is made up of a memory system from what I understand and and the white blood cells so you got the soldiers and you got the commander now the longevity the life of the of the memory system is longer than the soldiers but in that memory system that it tells the soldiers there's an invasion and it sends the soldiers out to fight that infection and the way that that AIDS virus works from what I understand it doesn't attack that it doesn't attack the white blood cells it it permeates it it goes inside of it and it kills it from the inside so when they tried to find the headship or the all that they could kill that virus he was in it was in the memory system and if they if they if they destroyed that then they destroyed the whole mewn system so it hit it it's just like the Palestinians in them and the is today whether they do they go into the hospitals and they hide their armor they they fire from houses and that's what the aid system did he went in there they went into Judas it's coming into the message and we're right on the pre pitiless in an age once at the last virus conquers the highest order of penicillin or antibiotic we got were right back to the pre pill and sealing agent were right on the brink of it this was God's strongest antibiotic they'll open another word to finish all sin that Christ that had to intercede for down to the church ages no more intercession because of all God's Fuller's of his antibiotic his truth his gospel has been unleashed and people are conquering it but they're dying inside they look healthy but they're full of adultery they're full of gossip and greed and envy and hatred but on the outside they can really mask that thing good because now they got the the word to dress that outer man with and to harness it but it's only harness sin sin is still in there God's not come to judge the outer life he's come to judge that soul and it's a soul that he came to redeem that's where he places his life and the memory system is the ministry by the Holy Spirit bringing back to your memory what God has spoken and he's invaded the pulpits like he did it Antioch he come and he invaded the ministry that came and spoke and took and took away their their immune system the Holy Spirit by losing their confidence and going back to an old system hybridize into that system [Applause] [Music] to righteousness in Romans nine well just let's see let's move along here because we we want to use is that really as a platform to preach what we want to say Romans 9 and verse 31 we want to read Romans 9 and verse 31 but Israel which followed after the law of righteousness now the law of righteousness meant exactly the the pursuit that Paul had in his life the law of righteousness means that they were they were trying to attain to God's righteousness through the obedience of the law through their performance but we find that no matter how much blood was shed no matter how much they had a spotless life they could still not go into the holiest of Holies and Paul said what we saw the earth was only a picture of what was really in heaven because when Abraham and them died in the Old Testament they could not go to that sixth dimension they went into paradise which was in the fifth dimension because that gate had not been opened into the sixth dimension because there was no blood so what we saw on the earth was what being reflected in heaven and Paul said it was evident that the Holy Ghost hadn't made away into the holiest of Holies so Neil now Paul is writing here he says but Israel would and he's talking about himself because he knew what his life was but but Israel which followed after the law of righteousness hath not attained to the law of righteousness we're for because they sought it not by faith now I want you to notice here that it wasn't what they were seeking that was wrong it was how that they were seeking it the seeked of baptism of the holy spirit is not wrong it's how you seek it what they thought was good but how they sought it was wrong wherefore because they sought it not by faith but as it were by the works of the law for they stumbled at the stumbling stone as it is written behold I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock of offense and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed brethren my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved for I bear them record that they have a zeal of God but not according to knowledge revelation man's knowledge but not revelation for they be an ignorant of God's righteousness ignorant of his revelation and going about to establish their own righteousness not having submitted themselves there's that humbleness recognizing God the presence of God recognizes werden submitting yourself having not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God so they be an ignorant of God's revealed truth had went out trying to find it and so under the power of man's reasoning they came up with their own answer but it was the wrong answer because they were ignorant of God's revealed word and so trying to find that revealed word they came up with their own revealed word but Jesus Christ is the end of the law for righteousness man's performance brother Brennan said if you repent and are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ then God is obligated to give you the Holy Ghost and if he doesn't it means you didn't come to a true confession so people that are seeking the Holy Ghost and could have it but because their own preconceived ideas of what the Holy Ghost is they don't believe they have it and some don't have it and because of their preconceived ideas they believe they have it I spoke in tongues yeah but you're wearing shorts and you go out here in bathing suits I've got the Holy Ghost and then a woman comes to brother Branson crying and I just I don't know if I got to hold he goes now he said here was a woman that had the Holy Spirit and didn't know it preconceived ID ideas so Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believeth so now it has nothing to do with our performance so people that are seeking the Holy Ghost and he says you haven't come to a true confession they go back and I say okay just see I've repented of this and that I left that out in other words they're trying to come to a true confession or complete confession as the Catholic Church says right and after you confess and they probe into your mind in your heart and try to come up with secret things that they actually plant the seeds in your own heart to bring out so yeah that whoa yeah I guess that's right a true confession is in your heart it's not how many things it's not how many rocks you turn over because when you come to the end of that road and desperation and you say there ain't no other way but Christ that's a true confession till you become broken it's not it's not it's not like it's not like joining the church and apologizing but being crushed like Paul was crushed like you and I when we comin and it was snot and tears and crying maybe we didn't understand everything but down in the heart you know I always think of Abigail how she was married to neh ball and when you look that name up it means everything evil to call him it was a blockhead it was hatred jealousy overbearing everything that you look up that name she said his name was a fool and we were married to the law she was married to neh ball and the Bible said that she was a woman of a good at understanding and a ball said I don't know who this guy is she said David there's a man that's hunting and seeking your life but God has wrapped your life up in his name and when you come to the throne well she knew a lot about David because in her was a seed but her first marriage kept her from David they couldn't have a relationship they couldn't have a courtship and she was a woman of integrity and she wasn't gonna flirt with she come and she said let the guilt fall on me David I wasn't there when they told my husband these things but they came to me and told me and and I come repenting I'd take the guilt upon myself forgive me and she offered that offering up of the other sheep and the and the bread and those things and she went back and when they've all heard about it he turned his heart turned to stone and after about ten days God struck him and she was freed from the law of her first husband but she came to that repentance and when God brought you to that place of repentance there was a law in God's Word that Satan had to loose this hold on you and when a ball died and David heard now they could marry because she wasn't under the law the first husband and the Bible said that we're dead in Him the husband didn't die the law didn't die we died and so that law that first husband had no control over you can't walk up to him grave and said now you can't get married she's dead she's not under that vow no more and it said that we were dead in our lives are hid in Christ and he has hid us from the law because we died and now were married to him and the law has no power over us now because he taken all that was written against us that husband and everything and he nailed it to the cross because we actually died in him because we're part of him so Paul goes on down to save and it's good to go back and study it verse 10 he says for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture says whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed so it goes down and down in it in it well let me read it first 13 for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a cheat without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah saith Lord who has believed our report so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God so then Paul also writes in Hebrews 4 he said they all heard the gospel under Moses right but he said but it didn't profit many of them it didn't benefit them because it wasn't mixed with faith and that word mixed is like married to it it becomes one it's not two elements like oil and water and you mix it up but it's two elements that become one element a marriage becomes one and when faith faith is married to that word it becomes one it becomes the inspired word he comes reality so you go back to Deuteronomy 29 and he says he said look he said go back and look what I did to the Egyptians look back what I did there in Egypt look at your shoes all of you Nathan look at your shoes Cara Moses Joshua everyone you look at your shoes they haven't wore out you ever thought about that and wore out honey hey you know he's right we've been a lot of miles didn't work so look at your clothes he said well you're right he said remember when you're hungry and I fed you when he was thirsty I i watered you but yet I God speaking I have not given you a heart to perceive and that word precede means to be understand a heart but the heart man believeth but Josh when Caleb they believed because they had been inspired by God back down there in Egypt but to the rest they weren't inspired they walked in the message they looked at the message they per took the blessings of the message they said under the inspired preaching of the messenger but because it was not inspired when they came to Katie's Bardia they could not trust God with their lives he said I did all this that you might know that I am the Lord your God but they couldn't recognize it they couldn't believe it and they fell away so then hearing the word is not faith hearing of the word is not faith but you can't have faith without hearing the word because faith cometh by hearing but hearing is not faith everybody that hears the word doesn't walk out of here with faith but those that it's inspired to by the Holy Spirit it becomes married to them it becomes faith it's the substance of things learned it's the substance of things it's the reality of God's presence and power so hearing the word is not faith but you can't have faith without hearing now wait a minute you can't hear unless there be a preacher and he can't preach unless he's sent of God because faith cometh by the hearing and hearing that word hearing he says that means hearing the word of God it doesn't mean just hearing but hearing the word then God has to supply that word that you might have faith but even if he supplies that word to you you can't have faith until he inspires it to you [Applause] until he inspires it quickens it to you by the Holy Spirit it's not faith so then God has to first supply that word before that you can even have faith and because that he supplies that word doesn't mean that you have faith because all it heard didn't obey they didn't believe when they came to caters Bardia they said let's see if we go across we die if we stay here we live we going across Joshua said Caleb said God deliver us out of Egypt look at his power look he destroyed the enemy at the Red Sea he's God we're his children we're in a time of inheritance and it's a fulfillment of his promise and we're the children of that promise and he is our defense he'll deliver the enemy and my inspiration they said we can take it because they were looking at God's power that had been revealed to them but to the rest it was only a hope it wasn't faith it wasn't a substance it was a thing they fed off until they came to the crossing and when it came to the crossing they couldn't believe they couldn't they couldn't humble themselves they couldn't take up the cross they couldn't if a man seeks to save his life you'll lose it but if he's willing to lose it he'll save it because Christ is the one that holds that life it's not me it's not you it's not the doctor God uses doctors he uses you and me for one another but it's God that brings life it's God that heals and the only allowed man to break into his laboratory of healing been merciful upon the people I'm the LORD thy God that heal all thy diseases now let's look at a couple examples and then we'll just we'll close but let's let's go to Hebrews 11 and in Hebrews 11 we're trying to build so that we can that we can come back now and take a look at at Enoch and Noah but in Hebrews 11 it says now faith is the substance of those things hope for and it's the evidence of those things not seen so then those things that are not seen faith looks at it and it receives that he goes on to to go through the through the heroes of faith this old chapters on faith and faith is a revelation from God and righteousness comes through faith and that's what we're talking about tonight for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God and so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear now look by faith Abel offered up on to God a more excellent sacrifice and Cain so that tells me that Cain had an excellent sacrifice because he had a more excellent sacrifice so we could put it this way as an example Cain came with the firstfruits and he was testifying that there would come a resurrection that was an excellent revelation firstfruits testifying of a resurrection but now Abel came with blood because without blood that resurrection brings us to a judgment so then he came with the blood that applies in atonement that when we come in that resurrection we have an advocate so his was more excellent so Abel by faith so now for able to have faith God had to supply some word because you can't have faith no matter where we go in the scriptures now we know that faith cometh by the hearing of the word of God and God has to supply that word he has to supply that to man that he might have faith and yet he can't have faith unless he inspires him so somewhere god supplied that word to Abel and inspired it to him and he taken a lamb and he offered it up as a sacrifice that blood of that lamb didn't do nothing for him there was no righteousness in that blood of that lamb that he shed it said that that sacrifice gave testimony that he was righteous it was only a testimony of his revelation the faith is what gave him the righteousness because remember that Adam in in Chapter in chapter 5 of Genesis you read it it says an Adam was created in the image of God and after the image of God or likeness of God Adam was created so eNOS his daddy was was Seth eNOS Seth and his daddy was Adam and his daddy was gone but it said that when Adam brought forth Seth he brought forth his son in his own image oh now something's happened because Adam was created in the image of God but when the Adam brought forth a child it was in his image now if he hadn't sinned and he would have retained the power of the spoken word then when the inspiration struck him he would have spoke that germ and that egg in the womb of Eve and she would have had a child because that's the way Christ came and that would have been what it wouldn't have been the son of Adam it would have been the son of God the spoken word and Adam would have come forth a baby and he would have groped till he got to about 24 that's all the older he would ever gone because the seed would come to its maturity and there was no downhill ride on death but he lost the power spoken word so he began to multiply like animal life and it brought forth human beings that were dominated by the second dream and not the first rim not the soul but the spirit and so every man that was born was born in the image of Adam a fallen son of God because everyone came forth in His image in all we all died in Adam so we know that when Abel came for he was in the image of Adam a fallen man if he had been a son of God he wouldn't have needed a sacrifice he could have walked right into the holiest of holies but he did not have the righteousness to go through that veil it would have been death and so Cain had a revelation it would take a sacrifice and there had to be an altar but it was it was own interpretation it was his old I did it wasn't completely wrong but there was a secret element that God didn't reveal to him he knew there was a resurrection he knew there was an altar but he offered up the law he offered up his own ability but God had a secret and he revealed that secret to Abel that it wouldn't be man but every God that would deliver man in a man and so by faith not by the sacrifice he obtained righteousness before God Joel we went on to read about Jobe he was perfect upright the word upright means righteous and he was just like every man born in sin where did he get his righteousness from where did he get his perfection from where did he get his sinlessness tongue from his unblemished God said he's righteous before me where did he get it from brother Brent said he was a prophet so he looked up into the word because the first Bible is there's a creation god expressing himself in creation when you write there's people can take a letter that you write they can tell you everything about you because there's something the way you write you're expressing part of your character there's people that study how you dress the shoes that you wear colors that you wear clothes that you wear and they they can tell you everything about you there's people they say well what's done what what what day were you born what time of the morning even in afternoon I tell you everything about you why because everything that we personify everything we expresses is an expression of our character the way we talk they listen to you how the hundreds of the heart the mouth speaketh and so God when he created he was expressed and he could not create without expressing himself attributes of himself so job looked up into that Bible as complicated as it was as many stars but God inspired him and focused him on something and he and he caught a revelation that it was through the shedding of blood that would be the forgiveness of sins and we know that because when he offered up the sacrifice for himself and then he offered it up for his children just in case they committed some secret sin so the sacrifice pertained to sin but there was a secret element that he didn't know yet what happens when man sure enough God forgives sins and he was tested and tried because the church the Deacons when they come down the church theology and it was true that when men sinned God judges man but they didn't have the elevation of Revelation a job had that there was a forgiveness of sin and if God forgives sin he does not judge men according to that but yet it looked like he was being judged they came with the church doctrine they said look at your sons can you done either did no your daughter's can you deny your fences your cattle look at all they pointed gods judging you because God judges sin and they came and they had all our theology and all our scriptures and joke looked at it and his wife come showed him all the things around the house he hadn't done how come you never run the crime ruling you you say you don't finish this bedroom but Jane even painted the walls yet and the fences are tore down and and look at this and look at that and by turn she got through with him she says now do you maintain your integrity and that word means innocent see you know she knows all the secrets of his life those when the pastor comes home said oh I just don't know what to do Bunnie o church you know and you know she knows all his frustrations she knows when he loses this temper when he gets angry she knows everything about him and then when she got through she says now do you maintain your innocence e your integrity and he was sitting there and after all what the church told him what she told him he's hot hold man you know he's probably about that high he probably could have crawled under a rock like they say and he just looked over at that sacrifice and that revelation he had he said yes I do because before God he revealed to me that through that sack I know the evidence doesn't look like it but I believe what he revealed to me that that blood didn't do nothing for job it didn't give him no righteousness it was only the testimony what the heart man believeth what the mouth he speaketh on the salvation with a hearty believes and with that expression of that sacrifice of that revelation but the righteousness came because God chose him and revealed to him his word that had taken it taken the shedding of blood but there was an element he didn't know there was yet a further opening of the word 1/7 feel sort of the speak because now you come down to the place that he had boils and he now it was not only his children but now it was him had come down to the front door and he thought he said oh if I just knew where his seat was if I knew where throne was I'd go knock on his door I want to talk to him and he was that real that he said if I just know what trees behind if I know where his seed is this tone is I would knock he was real to joke he was so real to him he said if I could just find him I'd want to speak to him and God didn't reveal his presence so you know what he did he walked over there to those ashes where he offered up that sacrifice because that sacrifice spoke of the presence of God to him and he sat down on those Sascha's and waited for him and he scraped visible he got in the middle of the ashes of his revelation said I'll wait till my change come and he was he was looking he was looking in the mirror of death and he thought a man dies shall he live again and right in the middle of that of that great turmoil and rage and seeing tsunami and earthquake in his life God coming yield to him he's a tall he said I wish that I could write this revelation down in stone that he would live forever but if I die and the skin worms eat this flesh I'll stand in this flesh and I'll see my Redeemer and not another not as a stranger but I don't know him and he'll know me and the see of him seventh seal broke open [Applause] let me let me read something here just the word just means righteous upright to justify means to free from blame declare guiltless to absolve from charges justification is a justifying or being justified righteousness is just and upright so we see that righteousness and just spoke speak of the same thing but because of the way that we came into the world we don't come into the world just we have to be justified to become just now a pardon a pardon does away with the penalty but leaves the person still guilty back in the old days out in the West and in America they had the outlaws and they just could not catch him they were robbing banks and stagecoaches so they said look if you stop all this and and give up your weapons will pardon you and if they did that then they gave them a pardon now the pardon does away with the penalty but you're still guilty it never declares you innocent and all he puts away the penalty under the Old Testament there was a forgiveness but there was not a true justification there was a justification that man might become righteous like a Abraham it was imputed to him so if I take a court system in the purity of a court system that this man is charged or a woman this person is charged with a crime and we have the prosecutor and we have the defense and they come up before the court system and would you say the judges the court there there's no jury but just this is the judge and the prosecution comes up and it presents its case and the defense they come up and they present their case now if the judge says he's innocent then he has been justified by that court system now under the perfect system than in the eyes of that court that man has never been guilty he has never been guilty because he's there to judge whether he's guilty or not and if he judges an innocent no matter what the prosecution said this man has always been innocent because the declared innocent is declare he was not guilty so in the eyes of the court he never was guilty so then true justification doesn't have anything to do with the sentence of penalty it has to do with the verdict justification is not a divine work it's a divine verdict and God is the justifier but if the only looks at you as a sudden says I forgive you you're justified you're only pardoned because you're not innocent but you cannot be penalized because you're innocent and because you're innocent there is no penalty so god declare you just threw justification and the only way that he can do it that a pardon comes at the expense of the law because the law is not carried out so then Christ lived a life for you and I and he gave his life freely for you and I and paid the penalty of sin that he did not deserve and when he arose again on the third day and was received up into heaven and the perpetuation was when he sprinkled the blood on the mercy seat and the Holy Spirit came back as a witness that God had received him [Applause] so then we are justified in Christ and in him were innocent and in the eyes of God we never was guilty yes you did it but Christ your sacrifice he is justified he hadn't pardoned you he has declared you innocent there cannot be no penalty but if you're pardoned and a new governor comes in and decides to do away with those pardons then they can bring you back up and send you because you're still guilty but if you're innocent there is no pardon so we haven't been just forgiven he says the people forgiven he says you still remember it because why you're still guilty but when Christ descended into the lower parts and preached to the souls it was in prison and he stopped by paradise because now there was a blood atonement and they were part of the sheathe wave if it had only been Christ and resurrected there would have been no evidence of Redemption but when he taken Abraham and all those it was in paradise and rose up to that dimension and hell of a happy again and they said who's out there say the lord of glory and he came with the blood and they rose with him and went into that sick dimension he said I go to prepare a place for you what he did he went in there and sprinkled blood that when you died you would go into that 6th dimension not forgiven but justified and not justified because you're just children of God not justified just because he loved you he loved Abraham they'll remember Melchizedek had no blood for him he had to become a man and crucified and descended down into hell and stop by paradise and God all those who died in faith embracing the promise for all because they had representation because God had inspired him and by faith they died embracing the promise [Music] we don't have a hope that we're gonna be saved we are saved our hope is in the second coming we're looking to that second coming we're not hoping to get saved we're saved if we accept that sacrifice one more example and then we'll close for the night locked 2nd Peter chapter 2 I read about lot and it says a lot it said it fixes he was a just man I think that's 2nd Peter 5 second Peter five second Peter six second Peter chapter two verse six and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overflow making making them an example upon to those that after should live ungodly and delivered just lot he's just vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked for the righteous man called him a righteous man for that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing vexed his his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds and the Lord knowing how to deliver or can I say separate to deliver the ungodly let me find my place for the Lord north how to deliver the godly out of the temptations and to reserve the unjust on to the day of judgment to be punished so jesus said father he said sanctify them chapter 17 John and that word sanctify means to set apart the word holy means set apart when you read that word sanctifying the Old Testament New Testament you read that word holy it means set apart set apart for God sanctify them Father through thy truth and thy Word is truth so how does God separate the godly from the unjust by faith but wait a minute how could luck be just he never heard from God well if I go to Matthew 10 there's the answer Matthew 10 and look toward the end of the chapter the last two or three verses last two verses verse 40 Matthew Tim he that receiveth you receiveth me he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me he that receiveth the prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a Prophet's reward he that recognizes a prophet to be a prophet of the Living God and accepts that believes it in his heart that he is the mouthpiece the voice of God he receives a reward now what is that reward its righteousness because now it says what does it say receives a prop and he that receiveth the righteous man so now he that believes God receives the voice of God or the revelation of God he receives his righteousness by believing that prophet is sin of God he's not believing the Prophet he's believing the voice of God through that prophet and he recognizes him to be the voice of God and God is supplying that word to that individual through that prophet and if he believes that recognizes him to be the source and voice of God and he believes it in his heart he's righteous now you take that righteous man that has received the word of that prophet and he and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward and what is that look at the next and whosoever shall give to drink on to one of these least ones a cup of cold water the least ones that believes the testimony of that righteous man not the righteous man but the least one of these that believes the righteous man to give them a drink of water chilling no wise loser reward it's a lot his daddy dies and his daddy's brother his uncle Abraham never had no children but he longed to have children you know some people they want children so bad they can't have children so they adopt children and they pour all her love under that child as that child's our own child and Abraham didn't have no children now his brother dies and here's a boy a son and he takes him as his only son and he raises him and he nurtures him and they travel together they walk down that dusty road together and he tells him about God and his experience with God and God is revealed to him things he talks about his visitations he talks about the revelation that God had given him and you know what lot believed him even though the promise didn't pertain to him it pertained to his step daddy but he believed him and because he believed him God imputed that to him for righteousness because see he was a prophet the only problem was is that Abraham had an experience and lot didn't he never had a personal experience so when the angels came down he believed but brother Branham said he didn't see the fire hanging over Sodom it wasn't a reality it was real enough that he preached it but he could not separate himself from that destruction showing that he doubted whether it might would come or not one place brother Brown said he didn't really believe that God would destroy that life around him and yet he believed a message but there was no powers faith was paralyzed it wasn't dead it was in a straitjacket he was paralyzed and kaneto straight he couldn't do nothing and in an in Genesis 19 in about verse 29 it said and God looked down and the fire was falling was falling down on Sodom and God looked down and you know what it said he saw a lot down there and when he saw a lot you know what that scripture said it said and he remembered Abraham he looked down the fire was falling then there was lot and he remembered Abraham and he delivered lot out of Sodom and your prayers for your loved one he said Lord would you destroy the righteous well he might not have really believed the message but he did believe it we're not creating loopholes I'm just telling you what the scripture said he accepted a profit as a profit and he believed what he said even though he didn't have the faith that took him out of the danger god looked down and he remembered his bride he remembered either any delivered law so lot got his righteousness from Abraham which caught this inspiration of God on the word that came to him and he believed him it was imputed to him to righteousness and he that receives a righteous man in a name of a righteous man or prophet in the name of the Prophet receives that reward and God loved him and they remembered Abraham any delivery as we bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we thank you so much for your word and your word is real it's true it's unchangeable it's unalterable and you never change your revelation you add information you make it clearer you never change your Bible you only open up the word that it would become clear to us where man becomes questionable about it he doesn't understand it but without being born again he cannot see the kingdom of God he cannot understand it and the kingdom of God is within you you are the kingdom of God because you are the Word made flesh for this day it doesn't come with observation and you just can't enter into it you can't join it but you must be born again Heavenly Father may you bless your people tonight for their patience and their long-suffering and through the multitude of words as one man said man does a little with much and God doesn't much with a little a little sometimes father we spend a lot of time speaking but only you can bring the inspiration one word one phrase and the inspiration from the Holy Spirit from you on that individual opens up a whole flood of vision and view of thy presence in thy word so father may you on the law the hearts tonight Lord that they might be established in the presence of God and to know you in the power of your resurrection father I ask that tonight in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen brother Gerald if you come god bless you god bless you brother hey man our brother Mike and brother drill has something in common and brother of Macondo we can't read the clock hey men and we are long winded a man but now it's the depth of the revelation of the eighth of the revelation by the grace of God as we almost do it maybe one day we will as Paul did when he preached and preached and preached and preached right on through the midnight and that young man fell and was killed but I tell you the preaching did produce something a man they were in the spirit and Paul was in the spirit favor in the revelation and and the righteousness of God was present a man the rightness was there and people did I guess were up startled and upset but Paul just went down and made all remedy student he's not dead he's alive so brother I tend to this why it produces faith you know and he if your heart is into it you become one with the word that that's mean that's going over the pulpit then then faith is going to going to be there God is going to be there God is going to honor your your faith you know your your hunger and your thirst for the word a man by the grace of God so has it got it honored it right there when when Paul preached and he went back it he didn't stop preaching you think you know well they're looking at their watch and they're looking at the clock and you're yawning and so on and they're stretching and oh well I I think I preached long enough now that poor young man fell out and and this have no it brought God on the scene in resurrection power and Paul got up and went back preached to them and preached the sunrise yeah you know maybe they thought oh well now I guess I guess our brother's going to going to bring him to a close now no he went on to sunrise they may have brother and that's the way we got a preach that's right as I said before you know forsake not the assembling of yourselves together and much more as you see the Day approaching and somewhere as I said I have a poundage yet but I did see it somewhere the prophet of God said that the time is coming when he said what I want he said when you want her to meet every night just not one not two or three nights a week but every night they met and and another time he said were mentioned today with our brother Mike and now that he said that oh well preached 45 minutes and people have taken that out of context they take this out of context they've take the message out of context they take doctrine out of context and they took that out of context I just got to preach 45 minutes well what else did he say he said if there are sinners in the middlee preached 45 minutes make an altar call base it is all believers he says you can stay all night amen but we're more conscious of our natural things than we are our spiritual amen let just leave the natural outside and let's dwell on the spiritual God look after that oh but I might have to do this and I might have to do that well he'll give you the strength for it you give you the wisdom for it it'll give you the leadership for it if you give him first place Amen by the grace of God so appreciated our brother's ministry tonight on true righteousness a man true righteousness and not by the letter of the word but by the spirit the Jews did have they did have and there are many that you know that Jews had that righteousness by the letter of the word the message the law as it were but and many have a righteousness by the letter of the message but how many have righteousness by the spirit of the message the Holy Ghost amen true righteousness or a true rightness you can have it outside but do you have an insight remember again what he said in Hebrews the Hebrews series he said you can go out and you can have long hair you can have this kind of clothing and all of that and you can be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but if it's not my faith out of the heart he said his dead works it is all good works it is and not it and our brother was bringing it out this is and is this not true righteousness it is not the righteousness of God amen it is of the flesh by the letter of the word a man and so forbid that we are only carnal believers not spiritual and King was carnal as our brother brought out Ava was spiritual Isaac was spiritual his meal was carnal a man he saw was carnal and Jacob was spiritual so you got you got this side you got that side so god help us to make sure you're on the right side make your calling and election sure sir brother it's without a doubt the Lord has made it clear to us tonight regarding the righteousness of God the true righteousness of God from the inside versus the righteousness from the outside you can have it outside but the greater the condemnation amen so Greece we need it from the inside out to be led by the spirit a male and he brought it all out in his past tense it's not what I've done or can do or will do is what he's already done a man and I thought he was going to read it because he went to Hebrews 11 and I eastern Hebrews the eleventh I said well maybe he needs e Bruce chapter 10 and if he was going to make a series out of it and go another our ego you get to he was after 10 and it struck me this week and just let me just read just five verses here six verses and he said by which will we are sanctified the will of Christ God in Christ by the which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God for by one offering he has perfected forever them that are sanctified as says where of the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for the after that he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them and he referred to that in Jeremiah bleagh and this is the Covenant that I will make with them that after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws I'm glad he brought that out God don't do away with the laws he magnified them because sometimes were accused of doing away with the law because we don't keep Saturday Sabbath yeah but as I said to that Adventists brother I said he magnified the law going from natural adultery - I said just thoughts the thought about it and the lusting in your mind your or your feelings I said he magnified it and I said now I should have no other gods before me and it could be you know well not just to being of a Trinity but it could be anything because your your your house can become your God your vehicle can become your God your children come become your God but those and you get more priam anything you get more preeminence to and it enters your relationship with the Lord that's a God that is a God and thou shall have no other gods before me and I said brother concerning what you're saying about the seventh day and say I must see some you know labor on Saturday and and go to church once on Saturday and that's it for the week I said no my brother I said you see some your did work so since seven days a week I I said an enter into God's Sabbath that was the what the reaction I got he had nothing to answer because he knew it was the truth I so remember the Jews did not enter into God's Sabbath because of unbelief they refused him I said that natural day only takes the spiritual God magnified it from one day to 70s and I just sees him from natural where labor and work I said you cease from your dead works of sin seven days a week an injury and of God Sabbath praise the Lord God's Sabbath rest and he said I will put my laws into their hearts and into their into their minds when I write them good and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more why can't we believe why can't we Billy our brothers brought it out it's not our righteousness as he is we have none except what he computes to us why can't we believe from the heart what was preached tonight let it be forever settled in your soul Lord your servant smoke it this it's and and again it's not the saying brother Mike it is thus saith the Lord it had not us and brother Mike in to threaten and remember that's how Jesus overcome the devil it is written it is written it is written II he could have exercised power he could have done this to the devil done that to the devil yeah do you know anyone that measure but he didn't he just came back to the wind with the word Amen because everything comes back to the word then the Alpha and the Omega of these plans and his purpose and his pattern by the grace of God wonderful Oh God Elvis God bless brother Mike yeah God's once again God has driven it on to us stop weren't one read about it and accept it stop warning about it and believe it amen stop stop down Ethan and I'm wondering about this and that and trust me take my word it is forever settled why their sins and iniquities will I remember no ma I thought oh that's good praise the Lord that's cool hey man good why cuz God's looking at your heart hey man God Elvis he brought it about the AIDS virus and the and the sickness in the earth typing it to the spiritual and what product came to my mind was some what the problem is said it and I know maybe 1954 there's coming a germ warfare upon the earth and is it gonna come up on all without what inoculation is gonna save you the Holy Ghost come up on all without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're right brother amen no the Lord was right the Lord was was was was bringing forth the truth again emphasizing it again that the baptism did it didn't just come this this age the policy has been pouring himself into the church ever since the day of Pentecost now finally he's the fullness of him in his image in the church in the end the bright the baptism of the Holy Ghost hey man god help us to recognize who we are a man we need and he said you know the problem after all God's done you know the problem he said the bride has got to come to the place to recognize who she is and he said when she does he said then the rapture will go it's like I said told you that when I was in the parking lot and at a supermarket summer one night and I'm looking at the closet and what what are you coming and he spoke back to me and he said son there's not one uncommon when are you gonna I'm already here where are you going hey man get out lift up their heads of understanding Amy it's right there oh it's right there eternity your theophanies no from no further than 12 feet from you and it draws near you he said the promises to what for he said to give you strength like a charge gonna do a battery but he said what we're going to do is in the rapture when the resurrection comes he said we're just gonna go right into our theophany and into a glorified state instantly praise the Lord brother but you got to believe what you heard tonight you got to accept what you heard tonight that the righteousness of God is not past tamps our present tense future tense it it's just done for or it forever it was eternal in the mind of God then he's before the foundation of the world thought Elvis to Billy there is a righteousness as our brother brighto can adjust to remind you of this of the law the flesh for the letter of the word seeming the message and there's the righteousness of God in the soul by the Holy Ghost he brought out of a job to it good experience a good example Joe did one job judge job by his personal own personal experience another judge him by tradition and another one judged him by his knowledge that he had see me like he knew more than Joel and as I preached some time ago that's the three approaches to the message and they all had their judge you that way but God pointed the job God where the him God turned around now he said to those three he said the last job to pray for you that's good as he said he saw Joel oh yeah that was hit that's good he looked down I saw Joel it's encouraging I mean he looks down and sees you pleading the token for your family your children your family some friend or somebody got laid out in your heart it's good god looked down and saw what abraham that's good thank the Lord that is good god help us but God's going to see when he sees you hey man as the Bible tells us God said I'll do this and I'll do that now do this now do that and he said only the prophets have delivered their own Souls by their own faith it's their own righteousness but he said I will bring their sons and their daughters that's encouraging please believe God accept what he has said tonight a man so that when he looks down had this one or that one he sees you that's good isn't it rather a man praise the Lord see what's he looking for faith and that one was under that that token that Abraham had praised God bless your brother Mike it was wonderful [Music] just before we have him because we want to there's a couple of brethren we want that time so I have some fellowship with
