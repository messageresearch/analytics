minds Lord but in our lives daily heavenly father that we will walk in a higher plane than we've ever lived before we pray Lord grant us Grace now we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray it amen amen turn if you would to Genesis chapter 1 in Genesis chapter 1 it's good to be back appreciate brother Mark taking the service on Wednesday night heard good reports about it amen I didn't get to listen to it but I got to see his notes and and there's some wonderful things in there that tied in even as we will be speaking on some things this morning amen just uh obviously many of you have heard I didn't get my moose I uh Nelson put me on on four and I had two in my sights and I picked one and fired and apparently I didn't hit it so it was 150 M Easy Shot should have had it don't know what happened um and I have no excuse for that this morning but I got a lot closer to another one I got 2 meters away from one and missed that one but that was a good Miss because I was driving brother Mark Subaru at the time and uh a big big cow launched herself Cal moose launched herself out of the ditch as I was coming home from Brother Barry and sister Darlene guys and she uh I was traveling very slowly by God's grace I was doing under the speed limit on new Bay Road which is a miracle in and of itself cuz nobody does it amen but she just jumped out and uh she knew she couldn't get across and so she turned at the last second and just started Galloping next to me at 40 km an hour so uh your Subaru is in one piece brother Mark not a scratch on for as I know so God's grace there but uh you know if I if I would have hit her I probably would have put a tag on her just to get one no I wouldn't have done that I but I do I did get to see brother Barry sister Darlene of course brother Nelson guy helped me for the first day and a half went to over to brother Hank and sister vernes as well and had a wonderful time with them didn't make it to brother uh to see brother Doug and sister Beverly unfortunately since I was hunting the whole time and just not able to get away it's about uh almost 3 hours 2 hours and 45 minutes each way so uh you have to take a full day to go see them and then Blanc and the kids are traveling back this week want to remember them in prayer they leave late late Tuesday night fly through the night get here Wednesday just before church so want to remember them brother Dale safe in Evon I don't know if you mentioned that but I spoke to him this morning so we thank the Lord for that amen and then we also want to remember the December 21st I think it is the Christmas program remember each F 22nd uh each family with children is supposed to do a song or a testimony or scripture recital or something like that so um sister Priscilla I haven't talked to her about this but you're supposed to let her know what you're going to be doing sooner rather than later so please reach out to her so she can put together a program and do that amen by God's grace amen Genesis chapter 1 says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and God did something God divided the light from the darkness amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning we're taking a second service on this thought of the revealing of our identity by the Holy Ghost amen and I thought it was very interesting very good what brother Mark was preaching about on Wednesday night like I said I wasn't able to listen but just looking at the notes there were some things that really clicked into where we were going uh for this service I knew well ahead of time where I was going to be preaching the Lord had kind of given me a message already so it was wonderful to see that I love to see continuity and support in these things and kind of filling in some of the cracks and building a foundation and building it up hey it's line upon line it's word upon Lord we've got a five-fold Ministry we've got Elders here we've got whatever God needs for us amen so I believe that God works on each heart and each soul to to bring what the people need amen but we're talking about the Holy Spirit this morning and how it reveals Lord our our our identity how it shows us who we are because if we don't see who we are how can we progress in our Christian walk amen how can we even start our Christian walk if we don't know that we're children of God but we know that you can't be in a Plan of Redemption if you weren't a part of God in the very beginning that that that word re or that that that that uh that start of the word the re means you have to be something if in order to be re something amen I can't be renewed if I wasn't new I can't be reset if I wasn't in order before I can't be restarted if at some point I wasn't started already so you can't be redeemed if you weren't deemed at one point amen you can't be redeemed back to God if you weren't in God in the first place amen so we understand that this is something that was way before we ever came into existence in this natural life and born to our natural parents and these different things amen and so there's an opportunity when we are re anything to go back to our original condition and that's what the Plan of Redemption is it's to bring us back to our original position in Christ I like how brother Mark talked about Adam's creation and God's creation and we're not a part of Adam's creation because Adam's creation fell and we're here and we're in it but we're in it but we're not of it amen that is not our source it's not our strength it's not our life in any way we're not a part of it we're we're really a part of God's creation and that's what the holy spirit is here to do is to show us who we are and what we're supposed to be and that's what the whole process of redemption is about amen so we're just here for for the ride really that's what we are this process amen we're not here as brother Mark said to direct to control amen but we're here to surrender to keep our lives clean by by Clean living to make ourselves accessible to him so that he can do a work to change us and then in that work be able to use us for the benefit of his work in the kingdom of God Amen but we read in Genesis 1 and this was the same scripture we opened with last Sunday but we read in Genesis 1 how God created light and we talked before what that light was but I want to focus more on that that fourth verse and it says and God saw the light that was good and God divided the light from the darkness now I I put up this photo of the Earth because you can see that there's a portion of the earth that's in light and there's a portion of the earth that's in darkness and I don't care how much you think you're in light if you're in darkness you're in darkness the shadow is the Shadow the light is the light and there is no in between now you will see here there's a fuzzy point where that light transitions Into Darkness or that light starts to fade away and darkness starts to come in and unfort fortunately that's where the majority of people seem to want to live is right in the fuzzy line amen but there's a supposed to be a separation of light and darkness and what good god did in the beginning was he put a distinguishing line between himself and everything else anden that word divide there means to separate to make a distinction to exclude to set apart or to withdraw from something amen it struck me even at the end of last service how at the beginning God was putting in divine dividing lines between himself and everything else Amen in Genesis 1 God created light we know that was the pillar of fire for God to dwell in but God created something that distinguished him from everything that already was everything was Darkness everything was void everything was in chaos everything was out of order but when God created something it was the opposite of what was already there of the way that things were and the way that the systems were amen there was nothing welcoming or life sustaining in the universe at that time and so when God created a body for himself to dwelling it was the opposite of what was there because that's what was needed for change to happen if you leave things the way they are nothing's going to happen they say that's the definition of insanity is doing the thing you've always done and expecting something different to come out of it and so God created something that was completely different and he drew a distinction between himself between his attributes between his dwelling place and he did that by creating a light and that light was the opposite of the darkness that was there amen and God did it the scripture says as a way of separating who he is from everything else there is nothing like God he stands alone he's an absolute amen and the and I'm telling you this morning that when God did that that is the reason why you are where you are today this morning he drew a distinction between himself and everything else in that Pillar of Fire was every attribute every plan every word every person that would be a part of God every part of the family of God was in that light form and there was a separation there and that's why you can sit here this morning under the hearing and the preaching of the word and you can receive it and it can do a work in your life this morning only because you were part of that separation amen that was a word dwelling place for God and guess what we're a part of it amen because we're a word dwelling place for God today that light was given for purpose as we spoke of last service last Sunday and it was to use the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit to produce a way for life to be sustained the atmosphere of the Holy Spirit brought the word the creative word of God and what that did is that set the tone so that this Earth could come into a place of life amen and it was for our purpose it was for our good it was for our life it was for our benefit and it was supposed to be a wonderful place that we could share with God on a regular basis now we know that Humanity fell in the Garden of Eden and what happened after that is that Darkness started coming back in and how did it come in it came by way of what knowledge by Logic by reasoning and that's maybe a scary thing to say this morning because this world is trusting that logic and reason are going to get us out of where we are today but logic and reason are what got us into where we are today so we're in a spiral of Destruction and we keep thinking we can get ourselves out of it and the only thing that can get us out is the thing that would have kept us out in the beginning which was to go back to the word of God that's the only thing that will change the situation amen we have to come back to what God gave adam in the first place and what's that total separation amen don't do it stay away from it amen but if we look at the elect of God right up to the time that Christ came we would say that they were in religious light they did not have the full light amen but they were under a law and that law only had one outcome and that was death under the law if you if you if you broke a law then there was judgment and in the end after judgment always Came Death not always by the law but by sin so it made a way for us to have temporary access occasional access to God but we couldn't come into the full light remember in that shikina Glory inside the holy of holies only one man one time a year could come in but that man still died because he couldn't stay in that light but he could only go in once a year and so in the end the the law was only a provision for us to be able to access God but at the end of it there was always death people died and died and died died why because God said the day that you eat thereof is the day that you die and so sin had a hold on top of us amen we couldn't get out of it it had a headlock on us it had a choke hold and so at the end people kept dying they could not come into the fullness of what God had and so they were always looking over their shoulder wondering did I break one of the 613 Commandments of Moses law and if they did then they had to make a a reparation they had to make a sacrifice they had to get under the blood quickly because if they didn't if they didn't clean up if they didn't right now then the law would come into effect and guess what the law always won the law always won there was no getting out from under the law you know brother Mark has told this many times about that man that was gathering sticks to to to make a fire to to to make breakfast on a Sabbath morning and they came to Moses and they said you told him not to do it what do we do now we caught him doing it and Moses went in to check with God and God said kill him why cuz the law said you don't do any servile work on on a Sabbath and so he died under the law the law always wins you couldn't fight the law you couldn't beat the law so they weren't fully dark and they weren't fully light under the law it was a shadow Paul says it was a shadow it wasn't total darkness but it was partial light and partial darkness and if you've been in Shadow you know it's a place you don't want to stay because it has none of the benefits of darkness and it has none of the benefits of light you know if you're trying to sleep what do you want total darkness you can rest in darkness as long as you're not scared and if you're in light you can have warmth and comfort and you can grow and you can feel happy and all of these different things amen but when you step out of a shadow into the full light then something just changes doesn't it you know I I walked out this morning and it's cold but it's sunny and as long as that sun is there then you feel good I've been hunting in Alberta when it was -30 before the sun came up and I would get in early when it was dark and sit there in the woods for a while hunting for animals and you got to get there early so that you don't disturb them and any any noise you make by the time the sun comes up and you can see then they've always they've forgotten that you're there but as that sun would come up I remember distinctly it warmed up to minus 19 but as soon as that sun hit me I had to start taking off my clothes at minus1 19 why because the sun's on me and it changed what the situation in that in that cold minus 19 the cold I've ever had it in Newland isus 20 and and you just want to die why cuz there's no sun and there's wind but if it's calm and that sun's out it just changes the whole situation and I was literally sweating in my heavy clothes atus 19 so I started to take it off take it off by the end I just had on a shirt and a and a a fleece and that was it and snow pants Inus 19 why the sun changed everything like this morning it's cold but boy I'll take cold and sunny over warm and cloudy any day there's just something about being in the light that that changes but we see here at the beginning that God divided God created a separation between light and darkness it was a work of Distinction and we take it for granted today that light and dark don't work together but that is actually a design feature that God built in that's the way that God made light to be it's an attribute of God it's an attribute of light is that when light is there Darkness cannot be present at the same time now I'm just building up to our our service this morning just a quick refresh for those that weren't here or those that have forgotten perhaps remember remember we read this last service and it's speaking of Christ the word in the beginning says in him was life and the life was the light of man and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not this is John taking us back to what we just read in Genesis 1:4 and it says the darkness comprehended not the light that word comprehend means it did not seize it did not overtake it could not grasp it could not capture it could not make it its own in other words when God created light there was a battle there there was a struggle between light and darkness because Darkness was what was and light was what is amen you have a past and you have a present and there's a difference now of opinion and darkness wanted to continue but God creates an attribute of himself to bring in and that light comes in and darkness can't control it Darkness has no power when light is there amen the light said you can't win you can't control you can't keep things the way they are now that I'm here you have to leave it was a total separation of what was now with what what is and that is God is in the building amen God is in the house amen that sounds so simple to us because when we walk into a dark room what do we automatically do we switch on a light and all the darkness disappears but that's something that God has built into light amen what was dark now becomes light with a simple flip of a switch amen and we think that's just the way would that it was but but God at the beginning there was a disagreement that was happening and it was a disagreement of what was reality cuz reality was chaos and darkness but God comes in and he says I'm about to change what reality is here and I'm going to do it by bringing light into the situation and when I do that then everything that you thought was real everything you thought was the way it had to be is now going to change purely on the basis that light is here that's the way that God was doing it why light destroys Darkness it destroys it it literally cannot exist where light is amen God set a law of Separation by way of light and we read this service this quote last service and I want to get us settled into our thought this morning he says now in the beginning this was our finishing quote he says in Genesis 1:3 we find that there was Darkness upon the earth and the spirit of God moved upon the water and said let there be light and there was light and God saw that the light was good and God separated the light from the darkness then he says these words so the word of God began to separate the light from the darkness from the beginning that's a process of time it doesn't mean that he said it and it happened immediately but something happened and maybe it was just a little light to start but in that little spot it was still light and in that little spot was victory was change was life was light Hallelujah it only took a little spark for there to be a change but it started to grow Hallelujah and grow and grow and all of a sudden there's this great light there and all of a sudden the atmosphere completely changes but it started with just a little spark the word becoming reality and as God starts to step into it it grows and it grows and it grows and he says what does it do it separates light from Darkness from the beginning he says so does it remain until this day what light is trying to come in and Destroy Darkness trying to change what's going on in our lives amen it's a process of time notice the effect think of a seed that's buried in the earth they typically bury a seed 3 to 6 Ines under dirt and if you're 3 to 6 Ines under dirt I don't know if you've ever been there but it's dark there's no light 3 to 6 Ines under the dirt a seed that's under there cannot see the light but when light comes it does not see it but it can feel the effect of the light nonetheless you got your spiritual thinking caps on this morning amen that that seed it's under the atmosphere of the light and what does it do it brings warmth and warmth starts to change the soil around it starts to loosen it up and what happens is that seed that's in darkness starts to rot and it starts to break its shell under the atmosphere of the light amen it can't see the light but the light is still causing a separation from Darkness don't we see that in people all the time we have see we we see people that that are they haven't surrendered to Christ they haven't fully accepted the word of God but yet there's something that's drawing them upward to him and they don't even realize it's happening I I've got multiple people in my mind right now that don't realize that God is calling them and yet they're responding to the call of God because what there's light that's changing the things around them and it's changing their situation and there's a lifechanging experience that's going on and they don't realize what's going on but what happens it's pulling them it's drawing them to the word it's drawing them to a church it's drawing them to Fellowship it's drawing them away from the things of the world it's a process and it's going on even if it's not done they don't even realize they're coming into the light but there's one Glorious Day Hallelujah where that thing that's been sprouting and sprouting and sprouting and as it gets close maybe it's not quite through to the surface but there's a little crack in the dirt and it sees something it's never seen before and then what happens is that makes it work all the harder to keep coming up and one glorious morning what happens it breaks through and it's in full sunlight and then it really starts to grow and it realizes there's more to this life than darkness and rotting and seeds and and cold that's what's happening when light causes total separation from Darkness amen I thought that it was so good what brother Mark said that about a clean heart and a clean mind being required for perfect Faith it's causing you to come out from all of those things that are holding you down amen that's what the light's supposed to do it's supposed to create a total separation from unbelief amen how by disconnecting us from the darkness and bringing us into the light you know you look at that first church age you look at when Christ was there and then and then that first portion of that first Ephesian Church age with the disciples and Paul and they were a perfect Church led by the Holy Spirit they were a perfect Church in Perfect Light doing the perfect works of Jesus Christ and then they fell from there remember what Revelation 2 says they fell from their first love they fell from their leadership of the Holy Spirit and what did they do they went back to the Lo the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil they went back to the logic and the reason of the leadership of men and they fell away from that amen and what happened is they went into more and more Darkness into each Church age and it looked like the darkest was in the Dark Ages socalled Catholic Church is controlling everything Antichrist if there ever was one bound people in dogmas and religions and worship of saints and worship of Mary and and purgatory and all these different things people are buying their ability to sin God forbid God forbid in the darkest of times but then what happened is God sent light just a crack through Martin Luther and what did he do he said the just shall live by faith and it was just a little bit of life but it started back that growth of that tree that had been cut down and then it comes along John Wesley and he says you can live a Sanctified life you can be cleaned up you can do things in your life that that are pleasing to God and you can set yourself aside from those other things and then he came through Pentecost a little more light and there was gifts that were in the church but then there came a full word again and what does it do it shows a bride that there's a higher plane that it's not just gifts and it's not just having fun but there is a higher plane where you can live in total separation from unbelief amen but yet in that Perfect final age it's the darkest of them all in leoda Christ is outside he's outside and he's knocking on the door trying to get in the churches have put them out they are literally today worshiping Satan thinking they're worshiping God because they have created a god of their own mind and that is not Christ that is not Christ I saw a female preacher talking again about this story of Jesus and the saraph phenician woman she said he called him a dog and she says that's not the kind of Jesus I pray to you know what it is she doesn't understand her word and so she has created a god of her own making and in doing so she put God completely out of her life you can't do it you can't do it amen we're in the darkest of Ages that's ever been today everyone said praise the Lord no no it's horrible isn't it it's horrible it's the darkest it's the most perverted I don't mean to sound down but that's what the word of God tells us it was the worst of Ages it is the worst of Ages amen but yet we have a hope and that's that in the this time there's a light that's coming that's our hope is that there is light in the time of Darkness amen remember we've we've read this many times before Isaiah 60 says arise Shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon the it's and behold the darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee and the Gentiles shall come to thy light amen and Kings to the brightness of thy Rising gross Darkness are we in Gross Darkness this morning like I said before gross means it's heavy there's a lot of it but I also like gross meaning disgusting Darkness that's where we're at today tell me this quote isn't the truth if it isn't exactly the truth he says man wants to look like woman women wants to look like the man it goes to show there's a perversion a dark Spirit hanging over a gross Darkness over the people and he says it's the hour of the calling out there's a Darkness over Egypt before the calling out then the token was applied it's time for the church to get the token or gross darkness is upon the people see you only have one or the other there is no middle ground it's the token of the Holy Ghost or it's gross Darkness he says yes it he says clean out the cupboard clean out this house oh we have a good oldfashioned house cleaning let the blood be applied and then the token will come in he says clean it out sanctify it amen there's a s there's a separation that's coming and remember in in Egypt and Goan there was a separation in the time of Darkness that when when that that the the the land of Egypt went into darkness for 3 Days Goan was still in light but that was only a type of the real shadow that was coming and that was death and life and it was only the token that was going to keep them safe amen but there's that separation going on here now and it's a separation of light and darkness and it's a promise of time it's a a process of time and that's so often the struggle with the our Christian walk is that there's time involved today everything is immediate you know I've got the fastest internet that Bell can give me and somehow I still don't think it's fast enough it takes one and a half seconds to load a web page and I'm thinking how in the world can this take that long to do why because I've become accustomed to the speed in the old days of dialup it would take you a minute to load a page and then we got cable modem and it took 20 seconds and we were like wow this is amazing and now it takes one and a half seconds and we think why is is taking so long there's a process of time that's going on Amen but what is it it's trying to let the Holy Spirit clean the house out let the token be applied so that he can have free reign in our lives amen you got something you can't kick this morning apply the token clean the house clean the house you got friends you can't let go apply the token you got something that's that's that's got its claws into you this morning apply the token amen so much of this is based on Choice it's not based on something that's been put on us somehow amen but in this in this this this last stage what does that light come to do show us who we are that's the final Revelation for the bride is when she knows who she is the rapture will go not who she thinks she is who she is the reality of who she is amen not who we were born as to our mother and our father but who we were before the foundation of the world our true position in Christ amen the light is the word and the power is the holy is is the holy spirit that's quickening us to it in this last time in this worst of Ages when everything's muddled when everything mixed up when there's no absolute when when there's nothing that's right or wrong when everything is Gray we've got a scripture that's especially for us says it but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that at evening time it shall be light you know we call ourselves evening Light Fellowship here why because that's the season we're in we're in the time of the evening light and you don't get into this you don't get into this body by attending this church you don't get into this body by believing a particular Doctrine you don't get into this body by any way but only because you're a part of the word of God that's the only way you can be part of this Fellowship is that you're a part of the word how do you become a part of the word by one Spirit we're baptized into one body the only way you can be a part of that church not this church that church of the evening Light Fellowship is to be baptized into the body by the Holy Spirit that's the only way to do it amen this is the calling out time this is the separating time this is the sanctifying time this is the rapturing time this is the resurrecting time there's a distinction that's being drawn between the bride and everybody else Paul said in Ephesians but all things that are reproved are made manifest by the the light for whatsoever does make manifest is light what's the Holy Spirit doing calling us into light that's what he's doing if we walk in the light as he is in the light then then we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all our sins he's calling us to walk into the light calling us to our origin calling us back to the full word calling us back to a place where we can live and breathe as we were meant to amen calling us back to a place where God has the full preeminence in our lives Paul would say it this way he says for ye were sometimes Darkness but now remember in the beginning was Darkness but then the light came he says but now are ye light in the Lord walk as children of light it says there we were sometimes darkness that means it was a temporary condition it was circumstances that's not our inheritance it's not who we are but it's what's all around us it's our environment is Darkness amen but he says now you are light in the Lord amen in circumstances there was Darkness amen we weren't that eternally but we were born Into Darkness okay you got to be very careful this morning that you don't think that because I am that's who I am no that's the conditions that's the circumstances that are around you that's why the light comes is to pull you out of those things so you can see that's not who I am that's not who I was meant to be the things we deal with church this morning are just circumstances and conditions that's it it's not your inheritance it's not the promise of God it's not your true nature it's not what you were born into it's just the environment that's around us amen these things are not Eternal they're not Eternal they're temporal they're meant to go away amen listen to what Jesus said CU we're talking about the Holy Spirit revealing who we are look at the woman at the well if you want to talk about somebody who is sometimes Darkness you talk about a woman that was sometimes Darkness it was that woman at the well listen to this leam says watch that woman they says watch these Pharisees and trained up and UPS you see they said that man is a beb he's a devil look when that light flashed across that little predestinated seed there when it struck the real seed of God that was before the foundation of the world the name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life he says when it struck it he says then quickly she recognized that in her condition she recognized it see we would say that's who she is she's a prostitute she's a woman that's had five marriages all of them failed she's living common law she's been disappointed she's been broken she's been hurt she's been abused she keeps making the wrong decision after the wrong decision she's frustrated she's tired she's worn out but that's not her that's just her condition but it says when that word struck her in her condition she still recognized it he says brother I say that woman knew more about God right then than half the people in the United States right why she was ordained before the foundation of the world what is it when light comes something happens when light comes we start to see not just who he is but we start to see who we are and when it comes all the excuses go away she didn't walk away listen under that oh under that presence under that anointing that was there the Messiah son going forth sign going forth showing her who she was showing what was going on in her life showing her her failures did she shrink did she back away no the more he spoke the closer she got the more I pointed out her flaws and her fails she said tell me more tell me more oh I know who this is I know who this is tell me any more come on oh it didn't back away she didn't back away she said go tell me some more cuz I know when the word comes he'll tell me and when he comes he'll tell me and he'll tell me and he won't putp me down but he'll lift me up into Heavenly places oh church that's what the word is trying to do this morning that's what the holy spirit's trying to do not trying to get us to back away in shame or embarrassment but to come in and say that's me that's me and the word is here the spirit of God is here to discern the needs of my heart that's what he's trying to do he's not trying to put us down he's trying to get us out of the dirt he's trying to get us out of the muck he's trying to get us out of the filth that holds us back he's trying to get us out of the shame trying to get us out of the embarrassment nobody knows this nobody deals with this let me tell you there's more people dealing with it this morning than you think why cuz Satan's a good enemy but the word is here by the spirit to what let you see who you are let you see who you are amen we're supposed to walk as children of light supposed to be a clear distinction dabbling in the world isn't holy church dabbling in the world is not holy that's compromise and with compromise always comes a price to pay amen it's backsliding and it hurts us more than we think I'm telling you this morning you can trace everything you're struggling with to a choice you made you may not have a TV but you have a phone or you have a computer amen you may not watch movies but you watch YouTube and listen if you don't have an ad blocker you're going to see the same things that you're going to see on TV and let me tell you this by personal experience you can watch something that you think is the cleanest of the clean and it'll still get you because they always drop something in there they always do why because they're in darkness they can't do otherwise darkness is coming through whether you want to or not and so how you manage that is going to determine what you're going to struggle with throughout the next days and weeks I speak by personal experience you think it's so simple and Har and it what is it doing it's just filtering in a little bit instead of a lot listen you can poison yourself slowly but poisons poison no matter what you may not intend to hear things you may go in with the best of intentions church but guess what it's coming from a polluted stream you've got to be so careful preaching to myself you got to be so careful amen you may not read certain books but you'll listen to podcast you may not go certain places but you'll talk to people that do listen Satan's going to try and get into our lives one way or the other and we've got to be so careful to draw a line of separation amen because this flesh is sticky it has a sticky nature and anything that gives it Comfort anything that gives it ease of Life anything that gives it entertainment anything that gives it satisfaction it'll say give me more and more and more of that James said it this way he says let no man say when he's tempted I'm tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he has drawn away of his own lust and enticed and when lust has conceived when lust produces its intentions it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death lust starts up here and what's the gateway to the mind it's the eyes and the ears and the mouth it's the senses it's the five senses amen but it doesn't have to be sensual lust doesn't have to be sensual lust is is Desiring anything carnal so listen it can be Financial it can be educational it can be job oriented it can be intellectual emotional edible digital electronic anything it can be a lust amen vehicular I I talked to to to the boys and the first thing that Samuel tells me is all the cars he saw in California because it's sunny and warm there dad I got my picture taken in front of an Aston Martin Vulcan wow you know loves it he loves it right but you got to be careful you got to be careful we all have weaknesses amen me oh three of us me Joe and Vel okay everybody else is strong Joe Vel this is for you everyone else can turn out for the no sister Leah giggled I think she's in on it too amen four of us we all have areas of our life we need to keep covered by prayer committal to God and consecration listen sister Justine can handle some things I can't and vice versa don't look around to say what's right or wrong look at the effect it has in your life and that'll tell you if it's right or wrong for you amen listen I'm out there with brother Nelson guy at the at the cabin he told me he's broken three phones I think in the last year because he gets sick and tired of them wants nothing to do with them most of us would cry if our phones were broken he willingly breaks them because he hates them he hates them guess what he doesn't have a problem with phones but some of us do some of us have problem you know what scripture says If thy eye offend thee pluck it out some of us can't handle certain apps programs access whatever it might be friendships stores listen some people can't handle credit cards some of us can if you can't handle it get rid of it put it out of your life was it gain the whole world what does a profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul you want to limp into heaven you want to go in in the power of the Holy Ghost amen how do you overcome walk away that's how you overcome you walk away take it out of your life amen but yet we have a great hope amen we have a great hope and it's that light has to be separated from darkness and God is doing that work amen and you and I were with him in the beginning and we've already been declared which side we're on and because were're in him we're on the side of light and light always wins light's going to win one way or the other we read this before Paul says ye are all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the light nor of Darkness that's not determined today that was determined in Genesis 1 you always were a child of light but you were born in circumstances of Darkness but there's a holy spirit moving now by the word that's going to let us see who and what we are amen remember what we read in John 1 5 it said that Darkness could not comprehend the light it could not seize it it could not control it it could not hold it it could not understand it it could not overcome it it could not make it its own I'm here to tell you this morning whatever is holding you can't hold you why because you're a Child of Light Darkness can't overcome a Child of Light oh I'm not saying there's not battles I'm not saying there's not struggles I'm not saying it's not a process of time but I'm saying the dividing line has already been drawn and you've already been put on the side that has light that means light has to win it means you've got to break through amen you might be in a battle this morning I know nothing about you may have had the darkest two weeks of your life this last of it doesn't matter you may think nobody's dealing with the things you're dealing with you may be frustrated because it's so simple and nobody else is struggling with it let me tell you there's a lot more people struggling with things today than they'll tell you amen as a preacher I know it You' be amazed the things that people come up for prayer for mature Christians amen we're all in a battle no great ones amongst us amen no great ones amongst us amen I don't care where you are this morning if you're a Child of Light there's Victory on the way cuz light destroys Darkness amen Look what Jesus said he says Jesus answered them verily verily I say unto you whosoever commit a sin is the servant of sin that real word there is slave whoever commits sin is the slave of sin and that servant that slave abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth forever the Amplified says there a slave isn't a permanent member of the household but a son is he says now if the son therefore shall make you free ye shall be free indeed you shall be free for real you'll truly you'll actually be free I want you to notice the language there Jesus is saying if you commit sin you're the slave of sin now what is sin see this world would say well not this world the religious world would say that sin is smoking drinking fornicating partying rock and roll music that's not sin sin is to disbelieve the word of God and then what happens is when you disbelieve the word of God what it is is you believe something else over the word word of God and that allows you to do what the word of God says you shouldn't do see we're talking about the attributes of sin we need to go back to the source which is we disbelieve the word of God if only for a moment amen so if you believe something else above the word then Paul says or Jesus says you're a slave Amen to stay where you are makes you a slave but then he says if you are a slave if you don't believe the word of God you can't stay in the house with the father that's not a place for done Believers that's a place for believers amen he says what happens is you come in and you come out that's what slaves do don't they they come in and they go out they come in and they go out they don't get to stay there but they have moments of respit they have moments of protection see a slave has temporary benefits of the Master's house but in the end he still has to go out every night but then he says if the sun will make you free if the sun will make you believe then when you believe you'll start to realize you're not a slave you're a son you're a child of God you're a daughter of God and it'll change something about you amen you'll notice here that our our intended position is not as a slave our intended position is as a child of God but he says you what you were sometimes Darkness you thought you were a slave but now I'm here to tell you you're a son you're a daughter of God what's he trying to do get us out of that slave slave mentality I can't help it I can't change it I can't beat it I can't do it I can't win I only lose I only go so far I never go far enough that's a slave mentality he said no no I got to get you all the way in total separation from unbelief amen we think we have to come to God as God is we think we have to come in perfect we think we have to come in with our dress right with our music right with our looks right with our house right with our family right with our marriage right with our job no no no that's not the way we come to God that's the way we leave he does a work but you can't come in if you're perfect healthy people don't need doctors that's what Jesus said he said I came for the sick I came for the needy I came for those that are struggling with life so we don't have to be like God in order to come to God Paul would talk to the Corinthians he says know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived listen to the list of of things here neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor emed nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God what a horrible list what a horrible bunch of people they had better not ever come into our church I'll tell you if I ever get one of those in our church we're going to have the deacons boot them out no you notice that half of these are learned behaviors you don't become a party animal just because you become a party animal because your parents are party animals you don't have common law relationships just because you do it because people teach you how to do it they teach you it's okay all of these things not all of them but a lot of them covetousness drunkards I'm not a drunkard why I was never taught to be a drunkard but I guarantee you if I lived in a house of drunkards I'd have probably been a drunkard learn Behavior amen but so many of these things come from our family heritage they come from the way that we're raised our genetics even and their their damages caused by people leading us astray by poor example you say none of those ought to be in the church and then Paul says and such were some of you so that means we got to welcome them into the church that's the ones that need to come into the church cuz ye were sometimes Darkness Hallelujah ye were sometimes Darkness but ye are what washed now you're children of light ye are Sanctified you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God what's the spirit trying to do show you what you are not what you think you are it's trying to get you out of the idea of just because I am this way I always will be this way they were full-blown Sinners they were the worst of the worst every possible way filthy vile ungodly perverted but they were children of God nonetheless Hallelujah let me tell you your little problem this morning compare to that you might be one of those things there may have been people that were all of those things he says but ye are washed they were children of God Amen how many times did Paul have to rebuke the Believers Paul constantly rebuked why because we need to be changed and if we need to be changed that means we're not what we're supposed to be the idea that you might have to repent of something is a good sign because it means you're being changed if we're never changing that means we're stuck and if we're stuck that means we're backsliding we need to be changing constantly amen change means we aren't where we ought to be just yet amen and that means we have to have some real honesty about what we're doing in our lives and where we're at some of these people didn't know better until Paul came along and preached to them but once they knew better then they were held accountable but what was it when that light crossed their path that seed in their heart sprung to life and they realized I'm a Child of God but yet Paul would come to others and he'd say listen you've been taught better and you're still doing it he says and now the holy spirit's calling you out knock it off or I'm going to come over there Paul didn't pull any punches he says you've been top better than your living get your act together start acting like the people of God you really are Jesus said a servant a Slave is bound by sin not allowed to stay in the father's house all the time he says let God set you free truly free and you can live as a Sons meant to live Paul would say in Galatians he says but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons verse six is one of my favorite scriptures in the whole Bible and because ye are Sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying Abba Father wherefore thou are no more a servant but a son see Jesus said if the son will set you free you'll be free indeed how's he going to do it signs and wonders great ministry no he says wherefore Thou Art no more a servant but a son why because the spirit of God is in your heart that's the only thing that'll change a person he says this and if a son then an heir of God through Christ every promise in the book belongs to you the Holy Spirit didn't come to you because you made a choice the Holy Spirit came to you because he made a choice way back when light was separated from darkness and he put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life on the side of light and said nothing's going to stop it Darkness isn't going to hold it back life is going to come forth where only death and Chaos were before that's the reason it comes because you are a child of God because you are sons of God because you are Daughters of God not because I did right not because I was born in a certain family not because I had a certain Minister growing up because you are a son or daughter of God that's why the Holy Spirit came to you amen for what purpose verse 7 to show you you're not a slave you're a son that's the reason it comes it's trying to elevate your thinking it's trying to get you into your position amen you're not a servant anymore you don't have to live in darkness you don't have to come in and out of the word of God you know brother Brown talk what was it that that message the inner Veil and then he talks about why are people so tossed about they're in they're out they're up they're down they're up or down listen a yo-yo is not the life of a true Christian it's steady oh we still have our bumps absolutely amen we have our bumps but we're not in and then we're not not out we're not saved one day and lost the next we're not sure one day and then we're unsure the next amen there's an anchor in the veil why there's an anchor of the Soul by the holy spirit that says I am a child of God that's the anchor that I have this morning amen that's what God's trying to get us to that servant could only temporarily get some of those benefits listen you can be a religious person and you can get some of the benefits you can have provision at times you can have health at times you can have Grace at times but at the end of the day you're going to go back out because of your unbelief and you lose those benefits see where's the servant's rest it's in his Works where's the son's rest in his position it's in his position he's saying you're the servant's going in and out in and out he's working working working the son just stays there why because of who he is that's all that's going on there amen why there's a dividing line that's been drawn and slaves are in darkness sons are in light amen they're in the presence of God being fed daily if they'll take it the only reason that son leaves is if he chooses to leave the father doesn't push him out amen you can lose benefits this morning because you choose to leave the word you can lose the protection you can lose the provision by your own actions but God's not forcing you out you're doing it amen we've got a choice to make amen why cuz we're in a relationship now not of works but of Love Of Trust then we're in also a relationship of authority amen I've read this quote again before but I want to read it again and it'll settle our hearts this morning I think it'll encourage Us in the battles we're facing brother Braham said this he says he chose us in love before the foundation of the world he didn't choose us by our works he didn't choose us because he knew we'd be great people he chose us in love before the foundation of the world now watch having predestinated us under the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will he says isn't that wonderful he loved you he loved you before there was a world he knew your nature he knew your weaknesses he knew your habits he knew all about you what you were going to be and then when he looked all over the great universe as it was he said I Choose You he says and when he did that before there ever was a spe of light then you're Eternal with God what was it you were in the original light not before Sunshine not before Moonlight not before Starlight you were in the original light and that light comes back now to show you who you are brother Ram puts it this way he says darkness is gathering what's it gathering for to show the light you say why is this world in such gross Darkness so that you can be revealed he says Isaiah 60: verse one Rise and Shine for the light has come to you that's the reason I can say shalom the light has come to you God's peace to the elected woman to the elected lady those who G before the foundation of the world called out and ordained to that the rest of them will never see it they'll never know nothing about it the Bible said so and Jesus said no man will come to me except my father draws him first and all the father has given me will come he says there stood Judas light shining up here but back in his heart was dark seed and when The Showdown came the darkness showed here was a little old woman he's speaking of the woman at the well all blacked out up here in front see by appearance Judas was a child of light and she was a child of Darkness God's not looking at that those are just conditions and circumstances he says but down here was a predestinated seed and when the light came it scattered the darkness and it showed forth we know messiah's coming and when he does he will show these things and Jesus said I am he but Judas doubted it yet supposed to be walking in the light he said see the light up here in the head doesn't matter it's the light down here in the heart that counts the light up here will walk and fellowship and everything else but when the real power of God comes in it can't come back to this dead seed and it'll reflect off in a denomination but when it's back down here a genuine predestinated seed when that light comes AC down here shows all the darkness away from you and puts you in fellowship with Christ he was the one who gave you life when before the foundation of the world otherwise you'll never see it what God Said what's he saying there's got to be a separation at some point that woman at the well in total darkness Church five marriages failed living common law but when she met the seventh man when she met the seventh man everything changed I believe she was with that group in Acts 8 that got the Holy Ghost remember Philip goes down to Samaria and he preaches and they're all baptized in jesus' name and then when the disciples heard that that Christ was preached in Samaria they go down and they what Peter and John go down they lay hands on them and they all get the Holy Ghost I believe she was one of them but that process of Separation started when the word crossed her path and she received it and accepted it amen what happens if there's no separation we're in a gray Zone we're in a partial Shadow we're in compromise that's what Leo deia is it's neither dark nor light it's neither right nor wrong it's neither hot nor cold it's a place of compromise it's a place of backsliding Amen God's desire is light or darkness that middle Zone where people are so comfortable that's the death zone it's a place of total compromise amen how do you know you're a child of God when the word comes your way you accept it that's it that's the way it's always been to whom did the word of God come in Corinth Sons that's what the scripture says amen you'll accept that light when it comes it doesn't matter what condition you're in doesn't matter how good you are how religious you are how spiritual you are or how much of a drunkard or a whatever a pervert whatever it might be what happens is what will you do with the word when it comes your way doesn't matter how good you were before what matters is what happens afterwards because if you receive it you'll be changed after that amen why because there's a separation that's going on of light and darkness brother BR puts it this way he says every Christian in here that's born again when God called you called for total separation if he didn't you got the wrong call amen did he call for total separation sister Brenda sister Moren amen some of us didn't have to separate that way brother Grant was it a total separation brother vichel it was a total separation wasn't it see so many of us are blessed with support of Christian families but some of us some of you you had to make a total separation from the very start but to deny it would be to deny who you were something is pushing you brother Vel I don't imagine you had an enjoyable moment with your family and Satan was there no doubt trying to get him to compromise in the smallest of ways why trying to get him out of the light but something inside of him Rises up and says not today not today I'm a Child of God can't do it to deny it would be to deny who I am to be it' be to deny who's inside of me and he can't help it amen how long did Abraham's separation take God comes and he says get thee out of thy land out of thy Kindred get away from all of it and what did Abraham do see we don't we don't like to put it this way but you know what Abraham said no see he left his land but he took his dad and he took lot Abraham wasn't obeying Church partial obedience entitles you to nothing total obedience entitles you to the Token remember and so Abraham leaves and I think it what took seven years for his father to die and then I don't know how many years it took for lot to go off into Sodom and then and only then did Abraham start to receive His blessings see it's a process of time who's in control there Abraham Abraham was controlling that that separation God gave the order God gave the means God gave the blessing God gave the promise but now it's on Abraham's lap Abraham are you going to separate or not and how quickly he did it determined how quickly he was going to get his Blessing brother puts it this way he says it is a total separation we're not to go back into the world no more or have anything to do with the world but cleave on only unto God Jesus is coming after a bride a woman a church that's separated from the things of the world or the cares of the world notice the things of the world or the cares of the world cuz the cares of the world are the things that choke out the Christian walk remember what he said in the parable of the swer cares of the world can choke us out as much as separation from the word itself see we say well I don't do this and I don't do this and I don't do this but if the cares of Life have overcome our Christian walk then guess what we're dying nonetheless he says she is separated from the Fashions of this Modern Age that we live in she is separated from the cares and the traditions of churches she is separated only to God he says and God is the word and as husband and wife is one so does the bride and the word become one for the word is living through the bride that's how that's her credentials that's her identification the word is living through her you're looking for where is Christ today where is the word being lived out now where's Church Creed being lived out now where are people mimicking the ministry but where is the word being lived out today that's what we're looking for remember when Peter and John stood before the the Pharisees and the council and they've been they went out and they' done signs and wonders and they put him in jail and they brought him forth and when they stood him before him they saw that they were ignorant and uned but one thing they saw they' been with Jesus why because they were the word was coming through them the same way it did through him signs wonders and IND Doctrine the whole package was there but R says that should be our attitude take the way with God's people regardless of whether it's hard or easy go anyhow be ready to go anytime now wherever he might call you you say well what if I do that what if you don't do that like I said before what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world but loses his soul we've seen people in this church make hard decisions for the word and has God ever failed us church has God ever neglected to come down and pour out a bounty on the decisions that we make according to the word I say he has he has every time he blesses us every time amen is it easy anybody here thinks separation is easy nope I got one shake of the head separation is not easy is it but it's necessary we have to walk in the light and that means Darkness has to go to the sideen you know what the hardest thing I find is is it's hard to be separate when people around you have the best of intentions when you're at work and people are trying to include you and people are trying to do certain things and they're trying to do everything they can and yet you just can't do it because that would go against the word of God they're not trying to make you do anything bad they're trying to accommodate they're trying to be generous they're trying to be gracious but yet it's still not enough and you have to say I'm so sorry I just can't do that and all you can do is trust that they can look at your life and look at your attitude and realize it's not personal you're just having to do what you have to do amen but beyond that like I said one of the hardest things is when that light of the word washes over you personally that woman at the well I Marvel I Marvel at her response the sarap phenician woman's the same way Jesus said it's not meat to give the children's bread to the dogs and she said yay Lord but the dogs eat the crumb off the floor that fall off the table she didn't get all oh can you imagine today if you said that to a woman of this world you'd be on the news you'd probably be charged but something in her responded to that word she said yay Lord you're absolutely right that woman at the well when he says bring your husband I have no husband he says you've said said truly for you have had five and the one you're with now is not your husband like I said she didn't back away you'd think maybe she thought you know if she was anybody else she have thought maybe he's coming on to me maybe he's a Jew maybe he's going to get all up on his high horse and he's going to start preaching at me about how I'm going to hell and I'm not a true child of God because I'm a half breed I'm a half Jew and I'm a half a gentile and there's no way I can go in and I'm outside of the Covenant she had every opportunity and I'm sure Satan would have wanted her to respond in the way that people today would but yet something in her said there's more to this than what I can see and church that's the total grace of God but yet that's the hardest thing is when the word gets personal and we're sitting under the hearing and the preaching of the word and he comes down and he does that and I have to raise my hand say yay lord it's me being a pastor being a preacher doesn't exclude you from struggles Satan's pushing harder on the ministry probably than anyone else don't think we don't fail at times so when he gets personal what do we do do we open the door where no light is or do we close the door and say not today because here's the thing light's coming one way or the other and we can go easy and we can open the door or we can close it and he can kick it in because one way or another light's going to win Church light's going to win this body is completely overwhelmed by sin it's born in sin it's bound by sin it's shaped in sin amen and it's going to take a resurrection and a Rapture to change it I reminded of the story I'm told of Aunt s dicks what was she 998 and she's in the old folks home she's laying on her bed she can't even get around and she's talking about the Battle she's facing how hard can it be how hard can it be your your food's taken care of you've got a bed there you you know you would think how can you have a real struggle in there you can't really see anything you can't hear anything and yet she would say Satan's fighting me so hard why we in a battle there's a separation going on Amen youo in our living room we have pot lights that are built in and they're controlled by a dimmer switch and when we're in that room we turn the lights on by flipping a switch but then that dimmer switch controls whether the lights are low or they go all the way up to very very ey scorchingly bright amen it's all based on what we do with that dimmer switch I thought about this I thought we're kind of like these lights Jesus said let your sight light so shine before men and we've got a controller built in so what brother Mark was talking about having a clean heart and a clear mind amen the problem is not the electricity in the CH in the house there's more than enough electricity to make those lights as bright as I could ever want them the question is what am I going to do with the dimmer switch that's the only thing I hold that control amen and so there's a way that those lights can be totally off or they can be glaringly bright and it's up to me how bright that light goes I can put a damper on the Holy Spirit I can put a resistor in my life I can put a resistor in my life amen I can do things that hold him back and it dampens my faith that dampens my walk and that dampens my light amen that's my choice the problem ain't the electricity the problems the dimmer switch limitation isn't on God's in church limitation is on me how much will I let go how much will I Surrender I'll tell you let him do it one time and Watch What Happens let the Holy Spirit have full control lay it down one time clean it up one time set yourself aside one time and say say Lord I'm here and watch what happens I'm a living testimony of what God can do in a life you have your own testimony I have mine God can clean you up from lust God can clean you up from Pride God can clean you up from cynicism God can clean you up from self-loathing God can clean you up from depression I say that as a personal witness amen but you got to let him have full control listen there's some things in our lives that we shouldn't even talk about but we can sit here and say today that's what I used to be we don't give glory to that we give glory to the god that took us out of that amen we don't glory in in the fact that we did a wrong thing or we were Bound in sin and hardship and we made bad choices what we glory in is that what I'm not what I used to be like that saying was in that woman amen what did she say I'm not what I want to be I'm not what I ought to be but thank God I'm not what I used to be amen my testimony this morning is I'm no longer a slave I'm a Child of God Paul said to the Corinthians remember in the Corinthians he told them all Corinthians were a rough Church they needed a lot of work but Paul says now where the Lord now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty Paul didn't say because you're a horrible Corinthian Church then God isn't there no no he says you're children of God holy spirit's come to you and you had horrible lives and you've had horrible situations and you've had this one doing this and you got to throw them out of the church and you got to bring them back in later and I was just testing you and it was a hard Ro it was a hard go but Paul never says because of what you are today God has abandoned you God won't work with you God won't change you but he says now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty what's Liberty to the believer living where we ought to amen living by the word not how we like to humanly speaking but how we ought to by the word of God he says but we all with open face beholding as in the glass the glory of the Lord are changed unto the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord that word Glory means the manifestation of God to manifestation of God in other words you don't have it all in a moment but God is revealing himself in you God's revealing himself in you and he's going step by step by step Page by Page day by day bit by bit it's a process of Time Light being separated from Darkness it's pushing out as the world is turning around into the into the light of the Sun what happens is what was in darkness now becomes light and under a full Revolution the whole thing sees light amen bit by bit Moment by moment change from one thing to another to another to another that means it's going to take time it's like that dimmer switch and what's happening is God is slowly raising the dimmer switch to the resurrection and Rapture setting amen as brother Mark preached on that Faith what's happening is Faith is moving up and up and up not bound by conditions not bound by circumstances now but what is it doing it's elevated by the word where you're looking at what the word says not what the situation says when you're looking at what the word says not what your circumstances say where you're looking at what the word says not what your DNA says it's being built up from glory to glory to glory to glory to glory until you're in the perfect image of Christ that he had before you before the foundation of the world Amen Paul says because the creature itself also shall future tense be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God it's a process that finishes with a body change it's a process of time that finishes with a body change amen there's something that's going on throughout the whole thing I've read this quote before and we're almost done this morning he says all that comes to me I'll give them Zoey my own life will give them my own life and they shall never perish and I'll raise them up at the last day in other words everyone that comes to me I'll wrap him in me now what is he he's light and he's life he says amen and he'll become a part of me and he can no more die than I can die for I'm Immortal and can't die and his soul is Immortal and can't die and I'll raise him up again at the last day he says then that just makes us when the old trials get hard say in me dwelleth the spirit of God there's no good thing in here but him that's in there he says I'm not my own I'm his I don't look for the things of the world I look for him for my hopes are built on him someday I shall see him and that's all I have long for what I live for is to bring people to him he says and I tell you the old shackles begin to drop off and you start walking a new again he says again sometimes we stop walking don't we we sit down and we say you know what I'm done and we watch everybody going by in their lives and their Christian walk and they're better than me and boy they're sure not struggling and boy what do we do we sit down but he says no no no he'll come by he'll remind you he ain't about you son it's not about you daughter it's I can do all things through Christ and then what happens is you pick yourself up again I think I did 48 kilm of walking in the bush this week over 5 days that's not walking on nice smooth easy roads that's walking through bushes through trees through swamps let me tell you by the fifth day I wanted to do this and wait for the Moose to come to me in the cabin we get tired don't we we get tired we get weary I was dehydrated I was sleep deprived I was dried out my eyes were bugging me again I did not want to go out I felt like the United States Postal Service cuz we got sleep we got rain we got snow and we got wind and what do what does their thing say neither slay sleep rain nor sleep nor snow nor hail I got almost all of it sitting out there but what something in me said the moose aren't going to come into the living room the resurrection is not coming to me if I'm sitting on a couch but something Rises up within us and says Get Up Soldier get up child of God kick those shackles off and keep walking again that's it that's it something keeps holding me I'm not holding it something keeps holding me the spirit of God raises up a standard and what is it brother Ram says he's pouring more of his spirit in that's my hope that's my rest that's my strength this morning it's not my discipline that gets me out in doing this Christian walk every day that's for sure barely gets me out for the Moose he says I tell you the old shackles begin to drop off what is that that's what a slave wears he says they begin to drop off and you start walking a new again I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me what does the scripture say a just man fth seven times and Rises up again it's not about the falling down it's about the getting up amen and that's what the spirit of God is doing this morning look at Rahab a prostitute can you imagine her life we don't know how old she was when Jericho finally fell but the word came her way and she accepted it and she married a captain in the Army and she went into the natural lineage of Jesus Christ changed in a moment that woman at the well five husbands common law with the six then meets the seventh the Son of God a son of man a prophet and she started changing she wasn't totally changed but light started working in her life and darkness started to go out she left her water pots she left her shame she left all the feelings of ostra being ostracized and she went in and she started started testifying she lost all her inhibitions from her choices and started testifying of the word and the church and the and the the people came out and I believe Jesus was there for two or three days and they said to they said now we we came out because of what you said but we stayed and we believed because of what he said what they got the same thing that she got and later on the disciples came back and led them all into what Total light the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're going to close with some quotes here he says it's God's promise he' pour out his spirit in the last days and that's what they would do notice they laid their hands on the sick everything that was in God's promise I shall pour out my spirit in the last days upon All Flesh your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and all these different promises he made everything is laying right there in God's promise Jesus redeemed it to us and if we are ordained on that ground if we are ordained to be on that ground it's like the eagle walking in the chicken's Nest he says if you're ordained on that ground the holy spirit is here to find you and when it finds you you recognize its call you know the hour you're living you know that these things are supposed to happen he says and quickly you're raptured up to meet it oh anybody here raptured this morning you were raptured then you recognize your place you recognize your position you recognize who you were the Rapture happened then but it's a process of time it's a done deal there but you've got to go through the process of the Rapture now he says quickly you're raptured up to meet it and now you're setting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus Oh What A Promise what a heavenly father who would give us these things the spirit quickens their fellowship with God so that they call the dead back to life in that day they laid their bodies upon the dead and they came to life he says listen closely they did the same things that Jesus did because the same spirit that was upon him was upon them and if one spirit makes a man act this way it makes the other one act that way he says then how can this come upon how can this come upon and say he's got the spirit of God and deny the works of God it can't do it notice God's life which is in the Greek called Zoe moved through them and in them it quickened their minds to his word he says now let me say it real quietly now the spirit of God that moves among the people quickens the mind of the person to the promise of God see it does it look and then he says now see I'm trying to show you and just let you realize now of the I'm speaking now of the Church of the church and also quick Quicken to life in him we have so many people that believe the Book of Acts for the day of the book of Acts but they don't believe it today but BR say I'm trying to get you to realize if the Same Spirit did that in them and it's in you today then the same spirit will do the same thing in you today it'll cause you to fulfill the word for your day he says although they only were his attributes to begin with only his attributes what an understatement you're only an attribute of god sister Lydia you're only an attribute of God hallelujah you're only an attribute of God I'd look at it the other way that's all I am there's nothing else why because light separates from Darkness the only thing that's in me in the reality of God's word is his attribute and everything else is being separated under the hearing of the word by the Holy Spirit he says but if God said in this day back in the beginning John Doe will be my servant millions of years ago now John Doe is born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world speaking lies because he's Immortal but maybe he gets a little religious feeling he'll go join a church maybe he'll join a Pentecostal church he might join anything but let him get under the atmosphere of God once Amen brother Grant you can be in a Pentecostal church and get under the real atmosphere under the the real word and he says what one see John Doe is bound to recognize who his father is he's not a church member we're not message Believers we're children of God otherwise we're just another denomination he's let him get under the atmosphere of God once see John do is bound to recognize who his father is just as that eagle recognized who the mother was it's God to realize it see only that John Doe is God's attribute that's become a word spoken and then the Holy Spirit seeks that word out here it is he says he calls him gives him everlasting life and brings him into the presence of God God's word God had the same when he saw Jesus it was the finished work that God finished with Jesus when he said it's finished all the plan was finished and when the spirit of God comes upon you and you truly are one of God's attributes that he spoke of he says now if you're not you'll wonder and frustrate and run here and there and everything else and never come to the knowledge of the truth I don't want to be that he says but if you're one of those the old things pass away right quick and you become new and the Plan of Salvation is finished hallelujah praise the Lord he says you're ready to obey every word that God ever spoke of you for you to do you're submissive to to his word the abstract to the contract the title deed belongs to you the debts are all paid it's all struck off as it was at the day of Pentecost amen God bless you let's stand this morning amen I've taken my time amen but I believe God's been in it amen it's a done deal your soul is sealed to the day of redemption of full Redemption amen doesn't mean the natural battle is over doesn't mean this flesh doesn't have its fights and its frustrations but the soul is settled amen you've already been set in Heavenly places in Christ amen your soul has been redeemed back to God where it was in the beginning and all it's doing is what's in that soul is pulling you right along that's all that happens when the Holy Spirit goes to working is what's in you starts to pull the rest of your body and your spirit into alignment back into what you were at the very beginning that's the final work of the holy spirit is to get this body into its original condition amen that means sickness has to go that means depression has to go that means the desires have to go we need a glorified body I can't wait for a glorified body amen this one's starting to feel old especially after a week of moose hunting amen I'm ready for a new one I'm ready for a new one amen but I've got to let go I've got to surrender I've got to clean up the circuits I got to get this mind set aside this life consecrated in a greater way not by works but to make me accessible to him amen so that he can have the full preeminence and do what he needs to do in my life amen God bless you this morning Heavenly Father Lord we're thankful for your light this morning Lord we're thankful for a call in our soul lord that responds to your word Lord even when it feels uncomfortable when it hurts Lord when it causes issues Lord yet there's something that keeps drawing us towards you Lord we're so thankful for that we're thankful we're children of light this morning that we're children of God Lord that we're not slaves Lord that we can stay in your presence to be fed to be provided for to be protected Lord we are so thankful for your goodness this morning Lord I pray you help us Lord to rest in our position to rest in our calling Lord that we would make our calling in election sure as Paul told us to but Lord having done L that Lord to let you have full preeminence day by day Lord that you could use us for your glory Lord that having redeemed us use us to redeem others Heavenly Father Lord let us be a light that cannot be hid I pray Lord let there be a clear distinction of our lives and darkness Lord that people could see the reality of a living Christ this morning Lord I pray you be with us in the coming week Lord as these winter months start to come in Lord and things get darker and grayer Lord we pray that your light would just shine through us Heavenly Father give us strength give us courage give us Faith Lord God lord Lift us into a higher plane I pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen It's Already Done 11:36 11:36 it's already done oh it's already [Music] done the Battle Is Over the victory is one and it's already done and

work work already things he's already done Deliverance he's already given prayers he's answered healings he's given amen sometimes we got to pick ourselves up by the bootstraps and remind ourselves of what he's already done so we can build our faith for what he's about to do amen if the trial seems long if the claws that Satan has in you seem to be awfully deep these days just remind yourself he's delivered me once he'll deliver me again he's provided for me once he'll provide for me again he's changed me once he'll change me again he's revealed himself in me once he'll reveal himself in me again amen Encourage Yourself scripture says David came back to ziggle and everything was taken his family was gone the other families were gone of his men but the scripture says David encouraged himself in the Lord and then he went and he said God do I pursue and God said pursue and thou shalt recover all David was in a place of Disobedience he was in the land of the Philistines but when he went back to to God God was faithful and he says go and recover all and I'll be with you and that's exactly what David did amen before we go this morning I want to sing two songs just to remind ourselves we're children of God the first one I want is I've been changed I've been reborn 293 amen have you been changed this morning have you been set free this morning then let's remind ourselves and let's remind Satan a little bit hey he's already started to work that means he's going to finish it the light's already moving Darkness has to flee amen and we'll encourage ourselves this morning
