[40:56] your members which are upon the Earth
[40:59] fornication uncleanness inordinate
[41:01] affection evil concupiscence and
[41:03] covetousness which is idolatry now most
[41:05] of those aren't words we know so I ran

[41:10] deprive of power the evil desire lurking
[41:13] in your members those animal impulses
[41:16] and all that is Earthly in you that is
[41:18] employed in sin a man without the Holy
[41:20] Ghost is a beast that's what he is
[41:22] that's what we fell we fell from being
[41:24] sons of God from daughters of God to our
[41:26] Beast nature in Eden when we we lost
[41:29] that relationship with Christ he says
[41:31] these are those things that are within
[41:33] you sexual vice impurity sensual
[41:36] appetites Unholy desires and all greed
[41:38] and covetousness for that is idolatry he
[41:41] says the deifying of self and other
[41:44] created things instead of God we're
[41:47] talking tonight as you'll see we're
[41:48] going to take another service on the
[41:50] worship of a weakness but he says the
[41:52] deifying of self it's worshiping our
[41:54] natural tendencies it's putting them
[41:56] above the word of God putting them above
[41:57] the spirit of God and allowing them to
[42:00] have control in our lives but notice now
[42:02] these are all things you do with your
[42:04] body but then he says for which thing
[42:06] sake the wrath of God cometh on the
[42:08] children of Disobedience but then he
[42:10] continues and he says in the which ye
[42:12] also walk
[42:14] sometime you all have dealt with this he
[42:16] says he says when ye lived in them
[42:18] that's the past tense that ought to make
[42:20] us say hallelujah this evening amen that
[42:22] we used to maybe be there but by God's
[42:24] grace we're not there tonight but then
[42:26] he continu he says okay you've done all
[42:28] of that but he says now also put off all
[42:30] of
[42:32] these and we start to look at this and
[42:34] we realize uh
[42:36] oh as far as I know we're not engaging
[42:39] in
[42:40] fornication but look at this list he
[42:42] says anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy
[42:49] communication out of your mouth now Paul
[42:51] has moved from the outward expression
[42:53] the outward beastly acts and now he's
[42:55] moving to something that has seen in the
[42:57] mind and in the heart this is the
[43:00] expression of what's really inside of
[43:02] you this is intentions now amen these
[43:04] are anger rage bad feelings towards
[43:07] others curses and slander foul or
[43:10] abusive language amen these are emotions
[43:13] and reactions to things and then he says
[43:16] lie not one to another seeing that ye
[43:18] have put off the old man with his deeds
[43:20] and have put on the new man which is
[43:23] renewed in knowledge after the image of
[43:26] him that created him see we were
[43:27] supposed to be created in the image of
[43:29] God and we were created in the image of
[43:32] God in the origin of all these things
[43:34] Adam was created in the image of God the
[43:35] scripture says but what happened is we
[43:38] fell from God's God's position and God's
[43:40] image and we were tainted by sin and now
[43:43] we're in the image of something other
[43:45] than God in our nature in our flesh in
[43:47] these different things and Paul says hey
[43:49] you put on a new man in a new image this
[43:52] is not the old man with the old image
[43:53] now you put on a new man with a new
[43:55] image and so watch out for these things
[43:57] because they're still sticking around if
[43:59] you're not careful you've got to bury
[44:00] these things you've got to kill these
[44:01] things amen God bless you this evening
[44:03] you can take your seats and as I said
[44:05] we're continuing our series on
[44:06] manifesting time and and we've got a a
[44:09] subtitle of teach my hands the war and
[44:11] then we got a Subs subtitle of the
[44:13] worship of a weakness and this is our
[44:15] second part with this and I apologize
[44:17] for those that weren't here for the last
[44:19] service because it may not make so much
[44:21] sense as as it it would have if you
[44:23] heard that but just hold in there with
[44:25] me those of you that weren't there but I
[44:26] wanted dig into this idea of weaknesses
[44:29] some more today and and I know this can
[44:31] be difficult amen I I'm being very
[44:33] pastoral with these things but I want
[44:35] you to know I'm not here with a message
[44:37] of condemnation I'm not I'm here with a
[44:40] message of hope I'm here with a message
[44:41] of Promise amen Satan's message beats
[44:43] you down God's message convicts you and
[44:45] then it takes you up to where his word
[44:47] says you ought to be amen but it's never
[44:49] easy to confront ourselves it's never
[44:51] easy to stand in front of the mirror of
[44:53] God's word and see that my life is
[44:55] different than what his word says but
[44:57] that's what we're here to do remember we
[44:58] read that that quote last service where
[45:01] brother brandham says when you come to
[45:02] church you come here to see those little
[45:05] things that need to be changed where
[45:07] you're off a little bit where you aren't
[45:08] matching up with the word of God and
[45:10] those things are what we come to church
[45:12] to correct we're not just here to get a
[45:14] pad on the back we're here to be
[45:16] corrected by the word and it's not
[45:18] always a spanking it's a simple telling
[45:20] you the truth of the way things are
[45:22] that's it that's where correction starts
[45:24] it's instruction is correction at its
[45:26] lowest at its first level then from
[45:28] there it moves to reinforcement then it
[45:30] moves to discipline then it moves to
[45:32] punishment amen and all these different
[45:34] things but so often we just we like to
[45:37] sit here and we say this is who I am and
[45:40] we say God loves me and God does love
[45:41] you but he doesn't love you in the way
[45:43] that would keep you the way you are God
[45:45] loves you enough to change you into His
[45:47] Image not to leave you in the broken
[45:48] image that we're in in this flesh amen
[45:51] amen but I've got a Bible that says that
[45:52] we don't have to stay there amen I've
[45:55] got a life that says we don't have to
[45:56] stay there not because mine is perfect
[45:58] but I know what I used to be and I know
[45:59] what I am now and they are not the same
[46:01] thing Hallelujah but I spoke in last
[46:03] service about some of my own struggles
[46:05] as a husband as a father how my
[46:07] upbringing broken home these different
[46:09] things influence that you know some of
[46:11] the the the aspects of of my struggles
[46:13] in my life I talked about my genetic
[46:15] background coming from an Easter
[46:17] European and German bloodline which
[46:19] doesn't put a whole lot of importance on
[46:21] emotions as far as Germans are Contin
[46:23] concerned we have two emotions that's it
[46:27] and so that bleeds into things that
[46:29] bleeds into family it bleeds into into
[46:32] church it bleeds into Ministry and
[46:33] marriage and these different things and
[46:35] so I had to come to a place where I said
[46:37] Lord there's got to be more than what
[46:39] I've got amen and there has to be more
[46:41] than the these things that I struggle
[46:43] with and so we we talked about excuses
[46:46] last service and how when we react the
[46:48] wrong way when we snap when we overreact
[46:50] when we shut down we always have a
[46:52] reason for it and in our own minds those
[46:55] may seem plausible or reasonable
[46:57] but just because they seem reasonable
[46:58] doesn't make them reasonable and it
[47:00] certainly doesn't make them true and it
[47:02] definitely doesn't make them right amen
[47:04] it might be it be that way to me and I
[47:06] might think I've got it but it doesn't
[47:08] always point to the root of the problem
[47:10] and the answer to our problems is not
[47:12] just this is the way I am there's a
[47:15] beast nature that we're fighting there's
[47:16] a there's a natural instinct in this
[47:18] flesh that we have to be able to push
[47:21] back against and what the first thing
[47:22] that gets that out is to put away the
[47:24] excuses and say God let your word be a
[47:26] be truth let your words be truth and let
[47:28] everything else be a lie and not rest in
[47:31] these things amen and so we saw that
[47:33] ultimately what happens is as these
[47:34] things are are in our lives and in our
[47:36] in our nature and whatnot people start
[47:38] to tiptoe around us and they start to
[47:41] not talk about certain things and they
[47:42] start to not do certain things about us
[47:44] and let me tell you church that is not
[47:46] the Liberty which in Christ has made us
[47:47] free when we've got a tiptoe around our
[47:49] spouse when we've got a tiptoe around
[47:51] certain people or certain things in the
[47:53] church that is not what Liberty looks
[47:55] like that is not what God has ordained
[47:57] for a bride in this last age amen we are
[47:59] to be free how often did did they did
[48:01] Brother Paul in particular talk about he
[48:04] who the son is set free is free and did
[48:06] indeed when he was here and I believe
[48:08] that the part of this is facing up to
[48:10] where we come short and things that
[48:12] we've inherited and and hurts and
[48:14] offenses and and just facing up to it
[48:16] and saying Lord I want to move past it I
[48:19] want to move past it I don't want to
[48:20] worship it I don't want to force people
[48:22] to bow down to be in bondage to the way
[48:24] that I react and the way that I do
[48:26] certain things
[48:27] so Jesus said in John he says then said
[48:29] Jesus to those Jews which believed on
[48:31] him if you continue in my word then are
[48:34] ye my disciples indeed and ye shall know
[48:37] the truth and the truth shall make you
[48:39] free then he'd continue in John 14 he'd
[48:42] say I will pray the father and he will
[48:44] give you another comforter that he may
[48:47] abide with you forever even the spirit
[48:50] of Truth whom the world cannot receive
[48:52] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[48:54] him but ye know him for he dwelleth with
[48:57] you and shall be in you there's the key
[49:00] to this whole thing Church shall be in
[49:02] you he says I will not leave you
[49:04] comfortness comfortless I will come to
[49:07] you what the spirit of Truth you know
[49:09] the world says the truth hurts and there
[49:12] is some truth to that amen but the
[49:14] intent of Truth is not to hurt you the
[49:16] intent of Truth is to free you amen God
[49:19] never said I'm going to set you free and
[49:21] it would feel good he said I'm going to
[49:22] set you free and I'm going to set you
[49:24] free by the truth its purpose is to give
[49:26] you Liberty not to make you feel good
[49:28] about how you are right now that is not
[49:30] what it's supposed to do he says the
[49:32] spirit of Truth is a
[49:34] comforter not to leave you in your
[49:37] current condition but to make a way for
[49:39] you to come into the condition that God
[49:41] wants you to be in amen the comforter is
[49:44] not a
[49:45] coddler God is not a coddler and we're
[49:47] going to get into that a little bit
[49:48] later amen but the the comfort that we
[49:51] have is that if we walk in the light of
[49:53] God's truth then everything we go
[49:55] through is for our good
[49:57] and we know that he'll do nothing to us
[49:59] except we are needful of those different
[50:01] things then he would continue in John 14
[50:04] he says but the comforter which is the
[50:06] Holy Ghost whom the father shall send in
[50:08] my name he shall teach you all things
[50:11] and bring all things to your remembrance
[50:13] whatsoever I have said unto you now
[50:15] catch this this is what the comforter
[50:17] does peace I leave with you my peace I
[50:20] give unto you not as the world giveth
[50:22] give I unto you he says let not your
[50:25] heart be troubled neither NE Let It Be
[50:27] Afraid so in other words the spirit of
[50:30] Truth brings peace and it casts out fear
[50:35] and then what it does is it takes those
[50:37] things that are so difficult in our
[50:39] lives and it says you don't have to
[50:40] worry or fear about those coming
[50:43] out in first in John 16:13 he says this
[50:47] how be it when he the spirit of Truth is
[50:49] come he will guide you into all Truth
[50:53] for he shall not speak of himself but
[50:56] whato ever he shall hear that shall he
[50:58] speak and he will show you things to
[51:01] come you I was studying on this and and
[51:03] I have a fair bit here tonight if I'm
[51:05] honest and so I I had to trim some
[51:07] things out but brother brandham would
[51:08] say he says the holy spirit is the
[51:11] prophet he's the prophet for the age
[51:14] because what happens is we tend to look
[51:16] at the prophet and we say well that's it
[51:18] it all stops with the prophet he says no
[51:20] you've missed the mark the Holy Ghost is
[51:23] the prophet and he sends a fivefold
[51:25] Ministry to work through those men to
[51:27] work with what's in your life it's to
[51:30] discern the thoughts and intents of the
[51:31] heart it's to preach and bring the word
[51:34] to your life as it's needful and that is
[51:36] the holy ghost that does it that is not
[51:38] a man that does it if by God's grace
[51:40] your need is met tonight it is not
[51:42] because I sat down and studied it is not
[51:44] because I knew something it was not
[51:46] because I did something it is because
[51:48] the holy spirit is here to speak into
[51:50] your life that is the only way this
[51:51] works otherwise we just end up with
[51:53] religion and denomination and I don't
[51:55] want any of that amen but we're all born
[51:57] in sin we all have flaws and faults and
[51:59] the word is here to correct it amen to
[52:02] bring us subject to the authority of the
[52:04] word of God not here to beat us over the
[52:06] head God's not here to be unnecessarily
[52:09] cruel or painful or any of those things
[52:11] but the word is here to set us free and
[52:13] let me tell you when you've been in
[52:14] bondage things get a little creaky and
[52:16] things get a little tense and tight me
[52:20] if you've ever had to sit in one
[52:21] position if you've ever been to a uh you
[52:24] know maybe to a conference or something
[52:25] and they didn't get give you a bathroom
[52:27] break for the first 4 hours and you get
[52:28] up everything is stiff and your muscles
[52:30] are sore because it's it's gotten used
[52:33] to being in a certain position and when
[52:34] your bonds are broken when you haven't
[52:36] been able to move or exercise guess what
[52:38] things are going to be a little tender
[52:40] for a while but that doesn't mean you're
[52:42] not
[52:43] free amen sometimes the pain is proof
[52:46] that you're free that you're moving on
[52:48] from these different things amen but I
[52:50] want you to see he says the spirit of
[52:52] Truth when he's come he'll guide you
[52:54] into all truth that is a
[52:57] Journey it is not instantaneous you do
[53:00] not get the Holy Ghost and then know
[53:01] everything and lose everything bad and
[53:03] gain everything good you have the
[53:05] potential to fulfill every word of God
[53:08] that is meant for you when you get the
[53:09] Holy Ghost but it is not an
[53:11] instantaneous thing we see that in every
[53:14] person in the Bible even Christ himself
[53:17] grew and matured so we do as well amen
[53:21] so it's not a certain thing but it
[53:23] always leads us into the word of God
[53:25] that's needful for our lives and evil
[53:27] for the age that we're in amen the holy
[53:30] spirit always points the believer to the
[53:32] word for their age remember brother
[53:34] Braham says we cannot live in the glare
[53:35] of another age we cannot live in the
[53:37] message of another age moses' message
[53:39] was true but it's not for us we can
[53:42] apply it to our lives but it is not for
[53:44] us our message is in Revelation three
[53:46] our message is in Revelation 10 our
[53:48] message is in Malachi 3 and 4 and these
[53:50] different things it's in the book of
[53:52] Ephesians and that's where the holy
[53:54] spirit is pointing us to but he's a
[53:56] comforter he's a guide he's a
[53:59] discerner amen it's not me or any
[54:01] minister or any gifted person that does
[54:03] it it is the holy spirit that achieves
[54:05] these things in the believer's lives it
[54:07] has nothing to do with me amen and when
[54:10] the Holy Spirit puts a finger on our
[54:11] lives then we've got to see beyond that
[54:13] man to see that it's God that's speaking
[54:15] even if the man knows something and
[54:17] that's when you have to be able to trust
[54:19] your pastor that's when you have to be
[54:20] able to trust the minister is that when
[54:22] they speak things that you know apply to
[54:23] you that you say he's not preaching at
[54:25] me he's preaching in for my good amen
[54:28] because he loves me because he's
[54:29] concerned about me and it's God that's
[54:31] doing it it's not a man that's doing it
[54:32] believe me there are things that I have
[54:34] said and that I'm going to say that are
[54:36] extremely uncomfortable for me to say
[54:38] because I know that there are people
[54:40] that they apply to in a very specific
[54:42] way and it's going to seem like I'm
[54:43] preaching at them and this has happened
[54:45] it it happens all the time it's not just
[54:47] this this particular message or service
[54:50] but I have to stay true to what I've
[54:51] been led to preach amen that's that's
[54:54] all I've got and and I may walk out
[54:57] feeling very uncomfortable and wondering
[54:58] what people are going to think but in
[55:00] the end it's in your lap and it's up to
[55:02] you what you'll do with it
[55:03] amen amen so the holy spirit is not just
[55:06] here for the preaching of the word it's
[55:07] here for the fulfilling of the word amen
[55:10] that's it's it because it's power behind
[55:12] the word that does it but it's a guide
[55:14] it's a comfort it's a teacher it's a
[55:16] revealer of the word it's here to bring
[55:17] all the clarity that we need to our
[55:19] lives now we're talking about worshiping
[55:21] a weakness this evening and I want to
[55:23] share a story with you about a woman
[55:25] that was bound and brother Brandon
[55:26] talks about this and she came for a
[55:28] visit because she was so torn up because
[55:31] she'd Fallen away from the life that she
[55:33] had been living now I want you to catch
[55:35] what she Fallen away from because she's
[55:37] convinced that Satan had gotten a hold
[55:39] of her and now she was full of demons
[55:41] watch how this unfolds now so she's
[55:43] talking to brother Bram she said well
[55:45] one Minister told me I had seven devils
[55:47] and the other lady Minister said I only
[55:49] had five now there's two of them gone
[55:51] somewhere so she came and stayed in in
[55:54] his house there about two hours in the
[55:55] house until God began to
[55:58] speak and said lady listen you come from
[56:01] St Louis she saides how'd you know it I
[56:04] said your husband's on the police force
[56:05] that's right and I said you used to be a
[56:08] lovely housekeeper she said that's right
[56:11] I said recently your house looks like a
[56:13] hog
[56:16] pin this is her falling this is her
[56:19] failure she said that's right she said
[56:22] your daughter I said your daughter's
[56:24] over there now taking care of your
[56:25] husband' she said that's right who told
[56:27] you that notice the symptoms now she's
[56:30] got a
[56:31] problem she used to be a good wife she
[56:34] used to be a good housekeeper but she
[56:36] has completely let her house go she's no
[56:39] longer being a husband to her or a wife
[56:41] to her husband and things have gotten so
[56:43] bad that her daughter has had to come
[56:46] and take care of the house for
[56:48] her and she's convinced that Satan has
[56:51] gotten a hold of her life by demonic
[56:54] power okay
[56:57] and so she's gone and she's gone to a
[56:58] minister and he says you've got Seven
[56:59] Devils she goes to a lady Minister she
[57:01] says five she's sitting there saying
[57:03] where did the other two
[57:04] go I'd be like at least I got rid of
[57:08] two but she saiding where did the other
[57:10] two go what happened why did they leave
[57:12] she's all broiled up she's all roiled up
[57:16] because she's got a literal failing in
[57:17] her physical
[57:19] life brother Bram says I just kept
[57:21] talking because I was in a vision and I
[57:23] said you went down to a little place
[57:24] first you went to a doctor yes he gave
[57:27] you shots yes those shots were called
[57:28] hormones yes she didn't tell him that
[57:32] she told him about the two ministers and
[57:33] then he repeats he says you went down to
[57:35] a place and they told you you had Devils
[57:37] yes because you had a real funny feeling
[57:39] yes they sent you to California yeah and
[57:42] some man told you you had Seven Devils
[57:43] yes you went to a woman she said you had
[57:45] five Devils yes and they told you to
[57:47] come to me that's right she said how did
[57:49] you know that I said the holy spirit
[57:53] said so amen the Holy Spirit is here to
[57:57] reveal all
[57:59] things to lead you into all truth now
[58:02] listen to what he says I said you
[58:04] haven't got any Devils to begin with
[58:06] that's right she said I haven't I said
[58:08] no I said lady surely you know your
[58:10] mother went through menopause it's the
[58:12] menopause something natural and I said
[58:14] what do you think those hormon shorts
[58:16] are for she said I don't know I said
[58:18] it's for the change of life that's what
[58:20] it is no Devils at all it's just
[58:22] absolutely your condition of life she's
[58:26] so bound up because some preacher told
[58:28] her something and then another one came
[58:31] and confirmed it that she thinks she's
[58:33] demon-possessed
[58:35] but as soon as he tells her what the
[58:37] real problem is he says she began to
[58:42] relax my wife was cooking she had said
[58:44] earlier I cut it out for the sake of
[58:45] time she says I will not eat until I am
[58:49] delivered my wife was cooking some bacon
[58:51] and eggs out there and she began to look
[58:53] through the house and I said kind of
[58:54] hungry she refused to eat
[58:56] then she said yes she went out and ate
[58:59] three eggs a big bunch of toast two cups
[59:01] of coffee a lot of jelly and she was
[59:03] just as happy as she could be praise the
[59:07] Lord then she said are you going to pray
[59:09] for me and cast it away I said cast what
[59:12] away she said the thing I said there's
[59:15] nothing to Cast Away she said well I
[59:18] Never Felt So Good In My
[59:20] Life Church what has changed in her
[59:24] body nothing
[59:26] not a single thing has changed but she
[59:29] says I've never felt so happy in my
[59:31] life she said whatat must I do here's
[59:35] the medicine go home straighten up your
[59:38] house do what you should have been doing
[59:41] all along he doesn't say you're a
[59:42] horrible woman he says go do what you're
[59:45] meant to
[59:46] do cook your husband a nice big apple
[59:49] pie about that thick and I'll bet you he
[59:51] does that amen praise the Lord then when
[59:55] he comes in tonight throw both arms
[59:57] around him kiss him sit down get on his
[1:00:01] lap and tell him you love him and Live
[1:00:03] Like a Lady ought to he says that's
[1:00:05] exactly that's all there is how
[1:00:11] carnal see sometimes we get so bound up
[1:00:14] in Satan that we forget there's things
[1:00:16] in this body that just are the way they
[1:00:19] are okay women you're going to deal with
[1:00:23] hormones you deal with them every month
[1:00:26] in a fluctuating cycle guess what
[1:00:29] there's going to be days when you don't
[1:00:30] feel like cleaning your house there's
[1:00:32] going to be days when you don't feel
[1:00:33] like cleaning there's days when you
[1:00:34] don't want to be around anybody and
[1:00:36] guess what it ain't Satan it's just this
[1:00:39] flesh you live in amen us men we pretty
[1:00:42] much only have one thing and we're just
[1:00:44] flat all
[1:00:45] way slight Rises for stress slight Downs
[1:00:49] for vacation time but otherwise we're
[1:00:51] mostly level most of us not all of us
[1:00:54] most of us but you and you deal with
[1:00:56] that all the time and Satan can get in
[1:00:58] there and he can start to use that
[1:01:00] against you and make you feel like
[1:01:02] you've lost something guess what we're
[1:01:04] living in Fallen flesh and you have ups
[1:01:08] and you have downs and that has nothing
[1:01:09] to do with your soul or your Eternal
[1:01:12] destination many times many times okay
[1:01:16] now watch what he says here brother John
[1:01:19] how are we going to get over these
[1:01:20] things he says see all the pouring on of
[1:01:23] oil all the Stomping kicking all the
[1:01:26] loud hollering wouldn't do a bit of good
[1:01:28] he says it's the truth that makes you
[1:01:31] free that's true he says ye shall know
[1:01:33] the truth and the truth shall set you
[1:01:36] free why am I saying this I'm saying
[1:01:38] seek God when you have a situation when
[1:01:42] you got a problem seek God you know what
[1:01:44] that woman needed she didn't need
[1:01:46] somebody to pray over her she needed
[1:01:48] somebody with a gift to wait on God to
[1:01:51] find the answer for her and tell her
[1:01:53] what her problem was and as soon as she
[1:01:55] realized
[1:01:56] this is only temporary this is only
[1:01:58] natural I'm going to get through it I'm
[1:02:00] going to make it I'm still a Christian I
[1:02:03] still have the Holy Ghost she relaxed
[1:02:06] you know when I was in Texas we got hit
[1:02:08] from behind in our car by a guy doing 80
[1:02:10] kilometers an hour he never hit the
[1:02:11] brakes and what happened is I I was the
[1:02:14] LA I was the only one to see it and so I
[1:02:16] braced myself and so when he hit I was
[1:02:19] braced and so my body resisted the
[1:02:21] movement whereas everyone else in the
[1:02:23] car they just kind of you know from
[1:02:24] behind it would just drive you back into
[1:02:26] the seat and so that everyone was fine
[1:02:28] except for me and so I had constant pain
[1:02:30] in my back and I went through
[1:02:31] Chiropractic treatments and massage
[1:02:33] therapy and all these things and I did
[1:02:35] it for months and then I got insomnia
[1:02:37] from the pain and all these things so I
[1:02:39] couldn't sleep I couldn't go to work
[1:02:40] longer than 4 hours couldn't do anything
[1:02:43] I couldn't sleep I go in my car and
[1:02:45] drive till 2:00 and 3: in the morning
[1:02:47] just cruise around for something to
[1:02:49] do but what happened is eventually I got
[1:02:52] an MRI and they said you've got a
[1:02:55] bulging disc you've got a herniated disc
[1:02:57] it'll go away in time and almost as soon
[1:02:59] as I heard that I started being able to
[1:03:02] sleep and I started being able to go
[1:03:04] back to work and things started
[1:03:05] dissipating why I knew what it was now
[1:03:08] it took the stress away it took the
[1:03:09] worry away it kept the kept the laye
[1:03:11] away at night in bed looking up the
[1:03:12] ceiling wondering what in the world this
[1:03:14] is am I going to deal with it the rest
[1:03:15] of my life as soon as I realized what it
[1:03:17] was and that it was going to be okay
[1:03:19] then magically everything became
[1:03:22] okay nothing spiritual now Satan will
[1:03:25] jump on that and that's the spiritual
[1:03:27] battle but the actual problem is not a
[1:03:28] satanic thing it's just this body it's
[1:03:31] just the way it is
[1:03:33] amen listen to this he says for the word
[1:03:36] of God is quick that word means Alive
[1:03:40] Church that's what I love about what we
[1:03:42] believe we believe in a living God a
[1:03:45] present God a God that's here this very
[1:03:47] evening speaking to his people meeting
[1:03:49] their needs it's alive it's the I am
[1:03:52] it's the everpresent god the word of God
[1:03:54] is alive and
[1:03:56] powerful that's a beautiful thing alive
[1:03:59] is great but it's got power behind it
[1:04:01] that's even better it says and sharper
[1:04:03] than any two-edged sword piercing even
[1:04:05] to the dividing the under of Soul and
[1:04:08] Spirit making the difference between
[1:04:10] what's in you and what's trying to get
[1:04:12] into you he says of the joints and the
[1:04:15] marrow and is a discerner of the
[1:04:17] thoughts and intents of the heart you
[1:04:19] know I've been reading I read the
[1:04:21] gospels in a loop a and I was reading
[1:04:24] there and Jesus is talking talking to
[1:04:26] the different ones and what happens is
[1:04:28] the thing that ticks them off the most
[1:04:30] is when he discerns what's in their life
[1:04:33] as long as it's about everybody else
[1:04:35] they're okay but the minute it says and
[1:04:37] they perceived that he spoke about them
[1:04:40] it says and they sought his
[1:04:42] life because he went to the source of
[1:04:45] their problem he exposed the root issue
[1:04:48] that was in them and they hated him for
[1:04:50] it because they knew it was
[1:04:54] true amen
[1:04:56] but see the truth came to them and
[1:04:58] because they were not of him they could
[1:04:59] not receive it but the truth comes to us
[1:05:02] and you can say the exact same thing to
[1:05:03] a Believer you can put a finger on their
[1:05:05] life by the word and they will say yay
[1:05:08] Lord that's me that's me why because we
[1:05:12] see the truth comes to set us free yes
[1:05:15] it exposes the issue but it is not there
[1:05:17] to embarrass us it's not there to shame
[1:05:20] us it's there to set us free amen God
[1:05:24] isn't exposing these things to embarrass
[1:05:26] us he exposes it so we can receive
[1:05:28] healing we can receive deliverance we
[1:05:30] can get a full Liberty amen from these
[1:05:33] things in our lives sometimes it sets
[1:05:35] our mind free like I was talking about
[1:05:36] my
[1:05:37] accident sometimes it sets our Emotions
[1:05:40] free I didn't know I had more than a
[1:05:42] couple until he set mine free now I know
[1:05:44] you're sitting there grinning and saying
[1:05:45] John emotional see I see one right here
[1:05:47] she can barely hold it in you think I'm
[1:05:49] not emotional now imagine what I used to
[1:05:52] be what there's a there were things that
[1:05:55] were B modled up that I had to learn to
[1:05:57] let go of and when I learned to let go
[1:05:59] of those things then all of a sudden I
[1:06:00] realized hey life isn't so bad in these
[1:06:02] areas you learn to let things go you
[1:06:04] learn to express it you learn to praise
[1:06:06] and the thing is it wasn't just in my
[1:06:08] personal life it was in my spiritual
[1:06:09] walk that I can now Express things to
[1:06:11] God it's okay to say I love you to
[1:06:13] someone it's okay it's okay to show
[1:06:16] appreciation to show affection in these
[1:06:17] different things I know most of you
[1:06:19] realize that but guess what that doesn't
[1:06:21] come natural to me and I had to learn
[1:06:23] those things and there was a liberty in
[1:06:25] those things
[1:06:26] anden it helped to change my life but
[1:06:29] our natural inclination is to hide from
[1:06:31] anything anything that brings up
[1:06:34] something in our life that might be
[1:06:36] embarrassing or shameful or or or stir
[1:06:39] up those triggers or those hurts or
[1:06:40] offenses and what not
[1:06:42] amen because it seems like there's a
[1:06:45] spotlight have you ever been in church
[1:06:46] and it just seems like the preacher has
[1:06:48] got a a thousand megawatt light on you
[1:06:52] and you can't escape from it I've been
[1:06:54] there many many times and and you think
[1:06:58] oh my goodness but it reminds me of my
[1:07:01] conversion is that when I stood in the
[1:07:03] light of his calling my
[1:07:05] name I didn't care that he was exposing
[1:07:08] all of my flaws because there was a love
[1:07:11] there there was a concern there there
[1:07:13] was a draw there was a pull that brought
[1:07:16] me into further into that light despite
[1:07:19] the embarrassment despite the shame I
[1:07:22] felt and it took almost 45 minutes for
[1:07:25] for me to get from my from my Pew up to
[1:07:28] the front to to to to give my heart to
[1:07:31] the Lord because there was such a big
[1:07:32] line up there but in those moments what
[1:07:35] he did was he cleaned me
[1:07:37] out oh what a wonderful feeling when he
[1:07:40] cleans you out and you feel not
[1:07:43] worthy but you feel
[1:07:46] accepted and I didn't worry about the
[1:07:49] light then because I was standing in the
[1:07:52] light of his grace not in the light of
[1:07:54] his judgment Hallelujah
[1:07:56] that's what his word comes to do is put
[1:07:58] his grace in our lives not to judge us
[1:08:00] to turn it down is to receive judgment
[1:08:03] to to accept it his grace upon Grace
[1:08:06] upon Grace amen his mercies are new
[1:08:08] every morning and it's a beautiful place
[1:08:11] for the believer to live in but we've
[1:08:13] got to accept the light don't run from
[1:08:15] the light church don't run from the
[1:08:17] light
[1:08:21] tonight Paul says this in Ephesians he
[1:08:24] says all things that are approved are
[1:08:26] made manifest by the light for
[1:08:29] whatsoever do make manifest his light I
[1:08:32] this is Amplified version it's a it's a
[1:08:34] a mishmash of multiples because some of
[1:08:36] them just said certain parts perfectly
[1:08:38] it said but all things having their true
[1:08:41] character exposed By the Light are made
[1:08:44] manifest for it is light that makes
[1:08:47] everything
[1:08:48] visible scripture says if we walk in the
[1:08:51] light as he is in the light and we have
[1:08:54] Fellowship
[1:08:56] one with another then the blood of Jesus
[1:08:59] cleanses us from all of our sins we
[1:09:01] cannot run from the light of the truth
[1:09:05] amen I've said it many times I don't
[1:09:07] believe this church runs from the light
[1:09:09] I'm Amazed by the things that you're
[1:09:11] willing to admit and and confess and
[1:09:13] come up and say that was just for me
[1:09:15] young and old alike that's a wonderful
[1:09:18] trait to have there are people that have
[1:09:20] come up for here up here for prayer and
[1:09:23] I've said it before I'll say it again
[1:09:24] anything you say to me me up here stays
[1:09:26] with me I don't tell my wife I don't
[1:09:28] tell the deacons I don't tell anybody
[1:09:31] but there are things that people have
[1:09:32] admitted to up
[1:09:34] here that took great courage to say I've
[1:09:37] got an issue and I say God bless you for
[1:09:40] doing that because that shows what's
[1:09:43] inside of you is that you want to be
[1:09:45] right more than you want to have an
[1:09:46] image that you want to be in his way
[1:09:50] rather than just have a facade of
[1:09:52] perfection in your life that's the
[1:09:54] believer that's going to overcome is the
[1:09:56] one that says I need some overcoming
[1:09:59] amen that's what makes you an Overcomers
[1:10:00] you have something to overcome inside of
[1:10:03] our Lives
[1:10:05] amen but see it's so so much simpler and
[1:10:08] so much easier isn't it to just take
[1:10:10] these things and push him down and push
[1:10:12] him down and put him in a wind put him
[1:10:14] in a a room with no windows and just
[1:10:17] lock the lock the door and and throw the
[1:10:19] key away but that's not the life of a
[1:10:21] Believer you know when I was studying
[1:10:23] this I looked at Peter because
[1:10:26] I want to encourage and I think this is
[1:10:27] a trap for the young people so many
[1:10:29] times but I think it goes for all of us
[1:10:31] is that we think we get the Holy Ghost
[1:10:34] and therefore we have no
[1:10:36] issues now maybe you don't think that
[1:10:38] but I know that's something that young
[1:10:39] people deal with because the question
[1:10:40] that every young person seems to to to
[1:10:43] to dwell on is do I have the Holy Ghost
[1:10:45] or not and see what Satan does is he
[1:10:47] comes in and he says oh you wanted to do
[1:10:50] that or you actually went and did it you
[1:10:52] don't have the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[1:10:53] wouldn't do that well let's go look at
[1:10:55] some somebody who had the holy ghost
[1:10:56] that was a chief Apostle that had the
[1:10:58] Keys of the Kingdom and let's look at
[1:11:00] his life let's look at somebody we know
[1:11:02] had the Holy Ghost and let's see what he
[1:11:04] says and we're going to look at two
[1:11:07] tonight because Peter had a weakness and
[1:11:09] Peter's weakness was that he couldn't
[1:11:12] stand up for what he believed when it
[1:11:14] came to cultural differences he treated
[1:11:17] the Gentiles one way and then he treat
[1:11:19] them differently in front of the Jews
[1:11:21] remember what happened was that when
[1:11:22] they he was just with the Gentiles he'd
[1:11:24] eat with them he'd Fellowship with them
[1:11:25] but as soon as the Jews came then he
[1:11:27] would push the Gentiles away and he'd
[1:11:29] only spend time with the Jews and so the
[1:11:32] Jews think he's great but the Gentiles
[1:11:33] are saying oh so you don't really
[1:11:35] believe what you the message you got
[1:11:38] that Vision you had of coming to the
[1:11:40] Gentiles that that everything we do is
[1:11:43] accepted now that you can live as we do
[1:11:45] and God still accepts you you don't
[1:11:46] believe that and it was causing a
[1:11:48] division in the church the chief Apostle
[1:11:51] was causing a split in the church cuz he
[1:11:53] had a weakness and he was full of the
[1:11:55] Holy
[1:11:56] Ghost twice filled with the Holy
[1:11:59] Ghost catch this but remember now Paul
[1:12:02] comes to town and the word Prophet never
[1:12:04] backs down the word Prophet never backs
[1:12:06] down he says but when Peter was come to
[1:12:08] Antioch I was Steed him to the face
[1:12:11] because he was to be blamed he says I
[1:12:13] went to Peter one-on-one face to his
[1:12:15] face and I said you're the
[1:12:18] problem remember we're to walk in the
[1:12:20] light even when it's uncomfortable he
[1:12:23] says for before that certain came from
[1:12:25] James he did eat with the Gentiles but
[1:12:27] when they were come he withdrew and
[1:12:29] separated himself fearing them which
[1:12:31] were of the circumcision and the other
[1:12:33] Jews dissembled likewise with them see
[1:12:35] everybody was fellowshipping together
[1:12:37] had a nice big group and then when Peter
[1:12:39] pulled away the other Jews that had
[1:12:41] accepted Peter's message of the Gentiles
[1:12:43] being partakers of grace and the gospel
[1:12:46] with them pulled away with Peter so now
[1:12:49] the Gentiles have lost all fellowship
[1:12:50] with the
[1:12:52] Jews it says fearing them which were
[1:12:55] they dissemble with him likewise in so
[1:12:57] much that Barnabas also was carried away
[1:12:59] with their dissimulation so Peter's got
[1:13:01] a weakness and now everybody is
[1:13:03] following along and worshiping Peter's
[1:13:05] weakness because Peter's in such an
[1:13:07] honorable position nobody's willing to
[1:13:09] stand up to
[1:13:11] him listen if it's my weakness and I
[1:13:14] force you to bow to it and it takes you
[1:13:16] to a bad place guess who's
[1:13:17] responsible this
[1:13:19] guy cuz I'm bringing you to a place
[1:13:22] where you can't obey the word of God cuz
[1:13:25] I've got the influence I've Got The
[1:13:26] Power I've got the position I'm not
[1:13:28] saying I have it I'm saying if you're in
[1:13:29] that as parents as officers of the
[1:13:31] church members of the ministry whatever
[1:13:33] it might be if you have influence over
[1:13:35] people and your influence leads them to
[1:13:37] do wrong you answer for it amen that's
[1:13:39] the burden of
[1:13:40] leadership he says but Paul says but
[1:13:43] when I saw that they walked not U
[1:13:45] rightly according to the truth of the
[1:13:46] Gospel I said unto Peter before them
[1:13:49] all why there's one thing that brother
[1:13:52] Eugene taught me he said he taught all
[1:13:54] of us he said if your if your mistake is
[1:13:57] public your apology is public if your
[1:13:59] mistake is private your apology is
[1:14:01] private and guess what if you won't make
[1:14:03] it right then it has to happen in public
[1:14:05] that's the way it goes that's the
[1:14:06] escalation of the things inside the
[1:14:07] church Paul says I said to Peter before
[1:14:09] them all if thou being a Jew livest
[1:14:12] after the manner of the Gentiles and not
[1:14:13] as do the Jews Why compell Us th the
[1:14:15] Gentiles to live as du the Jews so Peter
[1:14:18] Paul says to Peter you're contradicting
[1:14:20] the very gospel you brought buddy what's
[1:14:22] up with that and Peter had to stand
[1:14:25] there and
[1:14:27] repent that was the only option because
[1:14:30] it was obvious to all of what his
[1:14:32] weakness was and how he had led astray
[1:14:34] the early church already just in that
[1:14:37] one little weakness he had in his flesh
[1:14:39] they put Peter's personal weakness above
[1:14:41] the good of the body and above the word
[1:14:43] Above All Else above the word that's
[1:14:45] what we're looking for here because the
[1:14:47] word puts the good of the body in it's
[1:14:48] right place amen we want to come under
[1:14:51] the the the the subjection of the word
[1:14:53] amen we're we're not to go around
[1:14:55] calling people out that is not a
[1:14:57] Ministry calling people out is not a
[1:15:00] Ministry there's a five-fold Ministry
[1:15:02] and none of them are calling people
[1:15:04] out okay but there are absolutely times
[1:15:08] where we have to have the courage to say
[1:15:10] to a fellow believer I'm sorry but the
[1:15:14] word says you're
[1:15:16] wrong and the hardest thing is if we've
[1:15:19] been letting it slide for days or weeks
[1:15:22] or months or God forbid years and we
[1:15:24] find have to go and say I'm sorry I
[1:15:26] should have said this a long time ago
[1:15:28] but you are off the
[1:15:31] word yeah I've talked to different ones
[1:15:33] at different times and I've had people
[1:15:35] come tell me um brother Joe shared a
[1:15:37] story actually and I won't tell it uh in
[1:15:39] in public but he there was a brother
[1:15:41] that told him he was doing these certain
[1:15:43] certain things and and it wasn't even a
[1:15:45] member of this church it was somebody
[1:15:46] away and and brother Joel just looked at
[1:15:48] him and he said brother what are you
[1:15:52] doing that can't be God's will for you
[1:15:55] and your family and he had to have that
[1:15:57] courage to stand up and say I love you
[1:16:00] enough as a brother and sister I love
[1:16:02] you enough as a spouse I love you enough
[1:16:04] as my child whatever it might be I love
[1:16:06] you enough to say that ain't
[1:16:09] right and that man came back to him and
[1:16:12] he says you're right we've gotten out of
[1:16:13] kilter with this we've let it go too far
[1:16:15] and now it's dominating our life and we
[1:16:18] hope after this you know maybe we'll
[1:16:19] we'll trim it back or these different
[1:16:21] things but the hardest thing is it's
[1:16:22] people we love it's people we honor it's
[1:16:24] people we respect it's people that are
[1:16:27] above us Elders even as it might be but
[1:16:30] that doesn't put anyone above the word
[1:16:32] they put Peter above the word and it
[1:16:34] split the church it's the accountability
[1:16:37] to the word that keeps us on the
[1:16:39] straight and narrow and that's what each
[1:16:41] one of us is here to do amen and the
[1:16:44] simple fact is sometimes we're on this
[1:16:45] road to glory and we start driving on
[1:16:47] the wrong
[1:16:48] side sometimes we get off on a detour
[1:16:51] and the worst thing is when we just stop
[1:16:54] and somebody needs to come along and say
[1:16:57] hey you need to get back to the middle
[1:17:00] or you need to get
[1:17:01] going or you need to come back from
[1:17:04] where you left off of doing these things
[1:17:06] and it takes courage to stop and say I
[1:17:08] love you enough to tell you this because
[1:17:10] that's the only motivator for this is
[1:17:12] love for that
[1:17:14] personen you
[1:17:17] know we talked about it's it's it's
[1:17:20] never a Ministry to go around and and
[1:17:23] call people out but there is a way that
[1:17:25] we speak to each other and there's a way
[1:17:27] to handle these
[1:17:28] things Paul does it in Galatians
[1:17:31] 6 Brethren if a man be overtaken in a
[1:17:34] fault ye which are spiritual restore
[1:17:38] such a one in the spirit of meekness
[1:17:40] considering thyself lest thou also be
[1:17:42] tempted now I've seen my share of people
[1:17:44] going around that tried to correct
[1:17:46] people all the time and thought everyone
[1:17:47] was wrong I used to be one of them till
[1:17:49] I got
[1:17:51] converted we being
[1:17:53] honest if if I can't be honest I can't
[1:17:56] preach what's the point what's the point
[1:17:59] but I thought everyone was a hypocrite
[1:18:00] I've said this before this is not news I
[1:18:02] thought everyone in this church was a
[1:18:03] hypocrite because guess what none of you
[1:18:05] are
[1:18:07] perfect but here's the thing when I got
[1:18:09] saved and I started getting myself in
[1:18:11] the light of his word I saw enough of
[1:18:13] myself that wasn't perfect that I'm not
[1:18:14] too worried about whether brother Mark
[1:18:15] and sister Moren are perfect whether
[1:18:17] brother Gerald's a perfect Pastor
[1:18:19] whether I've got perfect parents or
[1:18:20] parent it didn't matter when I'm focused
[1:18:23] on myself I'm not looking at other
[1:18:24] people people but I saw that we're all
[1:18:27] believers we're all in the same boat
[1:18:28] we're all in the same fight and we're
[1:18:30] just trying to serve God but I'll tell
[1:18:32] you one thing Paul says here you know
[1:18:34] how somebody is in in a in a Godly
[1:18:36] correction mode check their
[1:18:39] attitude because if they're in it for a
[1:18:41] gotta or and I told you so or I'm right
[1:18:44] and you're wrong that is never of God
[1:18:46] that's not it but what he says if
[1:18:48] they're spiritual they will come in a
[1:18:51] spirit of meekness and Paul says that
[1:18:54] means you're coming with the full
[1:18:56] knowledge that but for the grace of God
[1:18:59] I'd be right there with you and I don't
[1:19:01] care who we are we can go there we can
[1:19:05] go there amen and God will sometimes let
[1:19:08] us fall just to help us know you're not
[1:19:11] all that in a bag of chips as they used
[1:19:12] to say
[1:19:14] Amen but one thing I have found is that
[1:19:17] people that are always making a habit of
[1:19:19] correcting others usually need it the
[1:19:21] most that is a life's lesson and I say
[1:19:24] that because I need needed it I say that
[1:19:26] by personal experience
[1:19:28] amen but you know sometimes the hardest
[1:19:31] thing we can talk about brothers and
[1:19:34] sisters in the in in the church we can
[1:19:36] talk about our our children
[1:19:39] even but the hardest thing to do is talk
[1:19:42] to our
[1:19:44] spouse because we know them inside and
[1:19:47] out and here's the problem they know us
[1:19:49] inside and out and so if I talk to my
[1:19:52] wife about something that's going on in
[1:19:54] her life you know what she has
[1:19:58] ammunition lots and lots of
[1:20:04] ammunition it's true because I ain't
[1:20:10] perfect and so what happens is when you
[1:20:13] start to talk to your spouse about
[1:20:14] something that they don't even maybe
[1:20:16] realize they're dealing with or they've
[1:20:18] dealt with for a long time or they're
[1:20:19] struggling with and you can see it and
[1:20:21] they seem to think it's not that big of
[1:20:22] a deal then what happens so often is
[1:20:24] they come back with but y
[1:20:26] you and they react and they shoot back
[1:20:30] and pretty soon it turns into a battle
[1:20:31] rather than a helping session
[1:20:34] amen or what they want is a
[1:20:38] hug and you've given them lots of hugs
[1:20:40] and it hasn't made a difference and so
[1:20:42] what they need is a Kumbaya session no a
[1:20:45] come to Jesus session amen I come to
[1:20:49] Jesus session to say this is bigger than
[1:20:51] you and it's affecting all of us it's
[1:20:54] it's affecting me it's affecting the
[1:20:55] kids it maybe even affecting the church
[1:20:57] depending on what it is but to sit down
[1:20:59] there and say I know you want a
[1:21:01] hug but we need to move past the hug and
[1:21:03] into the action stage we need to move to
[1:21:06] the getting better stage amen like we
[1:21:08] said God doesn't cuddle us he Comforts
[1:21:10] us along the way but he doesn't coddle
[1:21:12] us cuz codling leaves you right where
[1:21:14] you are remember we read that quote
[1:21:16] where brother bam said that God's
[1:21:18] talking to Moses and he's given him all
[1:21:19] the answers he's got a solution to every
[1:21:21] problem and every reason why he
[1:21:22] shouldn't be a deliverer and then by the
[1:21:24] end he points to the scripture where it
[1:21:25] says and God's anger was kindled towards
[1:21:27] Moses because he said Moses I've given
[1:21:30] you every answer and you still won't
[1:21:33] move he said and he gets angry with us
[1:21:35] he gives us a kick in the pants I love
[1:21:37] you but and he gives us a whack and says
[1:21:40] get on with it now stop being such a
[1:21:43] child can we say
[1:21:46] Amen I'm getting
[1:21:53] nervous because I I want to go into
[1:21:55] family weaknesses and inherited traits
[1:21:57] and these things just for a bit because
[1:21:58] these are often the biggest cause of
[1:22:01] issues in our families and our marriages
[1:22:03] and even within the church If we're
[1:22:04] honest anden you know and and we can
[1:22:07] look at this from two sides we can when
[1:22:09] it comes to Natural inclinations we can
[1:22:10] look from the bad and guess what look at
[1:22:13] my family we've got inclinations towards
[1:22:15] infidelity for Pride temper all these
[1:22:18] different things we also have good
[1:22:20] inclinations and we rather focus on
[1:22:22] those but I want you to see something
[1:22:24] because it doesn't matter if they're
[1:22:26] good or bad they're all in the flesh and
[1:22:29] in the end they're not going to get you
[1:22:30] to heaven and they're not going to give
[1:22:32] you the victory amen but I want to go
[1:22:35] into this by the scriptures we always
[1:22:36] want to go to the word for this I don't
[1:22:37] want to sit here and throw psychology at
[1:22:39] you or these different things but we
[1:22:41] want to go in the scriptures and I if we
[1:22:42] go to David's family we see a a
[1:22:44] beautiful picture of how these things
[1:22:46] can progress because David was a man
[1:22:48] after God's Own Heart and now that's
[1:22:50] something to be desired but it's not
[1:22:52] something to be inherited I can't get a
[1:22:55] good heart from my father my natural
[1:22:58] father or from my mother I can't inherit
[1:23:01] that that's a soul condition and that is
[1:23:03] ordained by God it has nothing to do
[1:23:05] with who my mommy or daddy was listen
[1:23:07] look at Rahab look at
[1:23:10] Ruth who were their parents
[1:23:13] idolators not exactly the best of the
[1:23:16] best and yet there was a seed Gene of
[1:23:17] God inside of them amen so it's not
[1:23:20] coming from them from from our parents
[1:23:22] but you see David generally lived a
[1:23:23] clean and Godly life and he made some
[1:23:25] pretty big mistakes but he was always
[1:23:28] quick to
[1:23:29] repent amen we're talking about
[1:23:31] worshiping a weakness the quickest way
[1:23:33] to get one of these weaknesses out of
[1:23:34] your life is admit you have it say
[1:23:36] you're sorry and ask God to take it out
[1:23:38] of your life that that's the simple
[1:23:40] thing I don't have any big answers for
[1:23:42] you here tonight except confess it
[1:23:44] apologize and make it right fathers I've
[1:23:46] learned the greatest thing you can do to
[1:23:48] your children is apologize when you step
[1:23:50] out of line amen remember we are not
[1:23:52] supposed to discipline them in anger if
[1:23:54] we're if we're spanking them if we're
[1:23:56] yelling at them that is not godly if
[1:23:58] we're doing it in Anger we are supposed
[1:24:00] to be doing it in love and I have had to
[1:24:02] repeatedly apologize to my children at
[1:24:05] times for doing things in Anger even
[1:24:07] though it's the right thing to do I did
[1:24:09] it the wrong way and I had to show them
[1:24:11] daddy ain't above the word daddy's not
[1:24:13] above apologizing and daddy's not above
[1:24:15] making it right that's the easiest way
[1:24:18] to teach those things to our children
[1:24:20] amen so David rules well and he stayed
[1:24:22] true to God and yes he had his mistake
[1:24:24] but he always came back but then we see
[1:24:26] Solomon come forward now and Solomon
[1:24:28] comes to the throne and God blesses
[1:24:30] Solomon with wisdom because he asks for
[1:24:33] it Solomon was like you and I he was not
[1:24:37] smart he was not intelligent above and
[1:24:39] beyond everyone he did not have wisdom
[1:24:41] above everyone remember what is wisdom
[1:24:42] is it's knowledge
[1:24:44] applied and that comes with experience
[1:24:46] and Solomon says I need wisdom I need
[1:24:49] experience without having it and God
[1:24:50] says you'll have it and because you ask
[1:24:52] for this cuz it's the best thing you
[1:24:53] could ask for is Young Ruler I'll give
[1:24:55] you everything else that you didn't ask
[1:24:56] for as well but we see what happened
[1:24:59] here was that David was pure before God
[1:25:01] and he always repented but if we look at
[1:25:03] David's life carefully we see David had
[1:25:05] a a particular weakness and it was
[1:25:08] women it was a woman if we want to be
[1:25:11] frank but the thing is is that David had
[1:25:14] always kept that covered up but as soon
[1:25:16] as David got out of his post of Duty now
[1:25:19] the natural flesh came in and David saw
[1:25:21] a woman and took her to himself and she
[1:25:24] was another man's wife so David had some
[1:25:27] issues with that but he got it under
[1:25:29] control how did he get it under control
[1:25:32] church he went back to his post of
[1:25:34] Duty that's what he did but now Solomon
[1:25:37] comes along and he's David's son by Beth
[1:25:40] Sheba so guess what basba has a problem
[1:25:43] with infidelity
[1:25:44] too so you got David has an infidelity
[1:25:47] problem you have BBA has an infidelity
[1:25:49] problem you put it together and what do
[1:25:51] you get a double dose of infidelity so
[1:25:54] so Solomon now potentially we would say
[1:25:57] in his body he has an issue that is
[1:26:00] worse than his mommy and daddy have
[1:26:03] church we look at our kids and wonder
[1:26:04] why they're struggling more than we did
[1:26:06] just realize sometimes they get a double
[1:26:08] dose of something we only have a half
[1:26:09] portion of and they're getting both guns
[1:26:12] from both sides of the family if they
[1:26:14] have it and they're fighting a battle
[1:26:15] that you've never had to fight we have
[1:26:17] to be so careful how we treat these
[1:26:19] things when we're dealing with our
[1:26:21] children amen that we're not hard on
[1:26:24] them for having some not so good traits
[1:26:26] and same with our spouses for that
[1:26:29] matter be gentle on
[1:26:31] me she smiled I think I'm
[1:26:35] good listen to this so David serves and
[1:26:38] he stays true to God all his way now
[1:26:40] Solomon loved many strange
[1:26:42] women together with the daughter of
[1:26:44] pharaoh women of the moabites ammonites
[1:26:46] Z zidonians and Hittites and
[1:26:48] websites and of the Nations concerning
[1:26:51] which the Lord said unto the children of
[1:26:52] Israel now notice every one of these he
[1:26:55] says ye shall not go into them neither
[1:26:57] shall they come in unto you for surely
[1:27:00] they will turn away your heart after
[1:27:01] their gods to marry these women to take
[1:27:05] these women to his bed whatever it was
[1:27:07] Solomon had to disobey a direct order
[1:27:10] from the word and what took him there
[1:27:12] one one step down the wrong path led to
[1:27:15] step number two led him to step 700 let
[1:27:18] him to step
[1:27:19] 1,000 one after the other see he didn't
[1:27:21] fix the mistake he kept it in his life
[1:27:24] and it brought him to the next one to
[1:27:25] the next one and to the next one it said
[1:27:27] and he had 700 wives princesses and 300
[1:27:30] concubines and his wife turned away his
[1:27:33] heart it says for it came to pass when
[1:27:36] Solomon was old that his wives turned
[1:27:38] away his heart after other gods and his
[1:27:40] heart was not perfect with the Lord his
[1:27:42] God as was the heart of David his father
[1:27:44] for Solomon went after ashth the goddess
[1:27:46] of the zidonians and after milcom the
[1:27:48] abomination of the ammonites and Solomon
[1:27:51] did evil in the sight of the Lord and
[1:27:52] went not fully after the Lord
[1:27:54] as did David his father Solomon started
[1:27:57] beautifully because he asked for wisdom
[1:28:00] but what happened is the further along
[1:28:02] he got in life and in his kingdom he
[1:28:04] started to try and make his kingdom
[1:28:06] prosper by politics rather than by the
[1:28:09] wisdom that God had given him and he
[1:28:10] started to rely on his flesh and on his
[1:28:12] mind and it took him completely out of
[1:28:14] the word of God so then Solomon dies and
[1:28:17] riabal takes his place now remember
[1:28:20] Solomon wasn't naturally wise but he
[1:28:22] ruled with wisdom because he asked for
[1:28:24] it so riab coming behind him does not
[1:28:26] have wisdom he's the same as everybody
[1:28:29] else and so rabam doesn't ask for wisdom
[1:28:31] of God he ask for wisdom of men and so
[1:28:34] he goes to the old men and they give him
[1:28:36] proper counsel and then he goes to young
[1:28:38] men his own age young people listen up
[1:28:41] if you're looking for wisdom do not go
[1:28:42] to young people your own age go for
[1:28:45] those that are ahead of you that have a
[1:28:47] proven track record of dealing with what
[1:28:49] you're wanting dealt with or making the
[1:28:51] decisions you're looking to make with it
[1:28:53] and so what happen is those young man
[1:28:54] what did they do they pump up his tires
[1:28:56] they make him feel good about himself
[1:28:58] they said hey riab it's time to flex
[1:29:00] your muscles it's time to show who's the
[1:29:02] boss and so he went out and he he he was
[1:29:05] going to make life harder for all of
[1:29:06] Israel and they said see you later and
[1:29:08] in one moment he drove the whole Kingdom
[1:29:10] right into a ditch and he lost the whole
[1:29:12] thing except for Judah they walked away
[1:29:15] from him
[1:29:16] wholesale so we go from David who was
[1:29:18] near perfect to Solomon who's going
[1:29:20] downhill and then Solomon passes it on
[1:29:22] to rabom and you have the same genetics
[1:29:25] coming all the way through there amen
[1:29:27] and watch how far this gets out we're
[1:29:30] only into the third generation now it
[1:29:32] says that and rabol the son of Solomon
[1:29:34] reigned in Judah and he was 41 years old
[1:29:36] when he began to Reign he reigned 17
[1:29:38] years the city of the Lord to choose out
[1:29:40] of all the tribes of Israel to put his
[1:29:42] name there and his mother's name now
[1:29:43] catch some of the issue here his
[1:29:45] mother's name was NE an ammonius so he's
[1:29:48] the son of Solomon and a woman that came
[1:29:51] from an incest incestuous background so
[1:29:53] his genetic pool is all messed up
[1:29:56] now remember Ammon came from lot it's
[1:30:00] from a daughter that laid with her
[1:30:02] father it says and and and what's the
[1:30:04] result of ri's rule Judah did evil in
[1:30:06] the sight of the Lord and they provoked
[1:30:08] him to jealousy with their sins which
[1:30:10] they had committed above all that their
[1:30:12] fathers are done so they were worse than
[1:30:14] anyone before them because riabal
[1:30:17] couldn't
[1:30:18] correct so for they also built them high
[1:30:20] places images Groves on every high hill
[1:30:22] and under every Green Tree and there
[1:30:24] were also sodomites in the
[1:30:27] land oh it's not just Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:30:31] now it's come into the children of
[1:30:34] Israel because guess what lot and his
[1:30:36] daughters left but they didn't really
[1:30:39] leave make Believers right says there
[1:30:43] were also sodomites in the land and they
[1:30:45] did according to all the Abominations of
[1:30:47] the Nations which the Lord cast out
[1:30:48] before the children of Israel so now
[1:30:50] they've lost the victory completely
[1:30:51] they've lost the presence of God they've
[1:30:53] lost the worship of God they lost all
[1:30:55] morality and it comes back to a tainted
[1:30:59] King then after that we come into the
[1:31:01] fourth generation with abim who's riabal
[1:31:03] son and he's the grandson now of a
[1:31:06] foolish man with an ancestros woman and
[1:31:08] he's been raised by a father that says
[1:31:10] anything goes a father that refused to
[1:31:12] correct the people or his
[1:31:15] children and so we see he can't do
[1:31:17] anything good in himself it says now in
[1:31:18] the 18th year of King jeroboam the son
[1:31:20] of nebat reigned abijam over Judah and
[1:31:23] he w walked in all the sins of his
[1:31:25] father which he had done before him and
[1:31:26] his heart was not perfect with the Lord
[1:31:28] his God as the heart of David his father
[1:31:31] and he slept with his fathers and they
[1:31:32] buried him in the city of David and ASA
[1:31:34] his son reigned in his
[1:31:36] dead now we're coming to the fourth
[1:31:39] generation and we think everything's
[1:31:41] doomed says and in the 20th year of
[1:31:43] jeroboam king of Israel reigned ASA over
[1:31:45] Judah and 41 years reigned he in
[1:31:47] Jerusalem and his mother's name was maah
[1:31:50] the daughter of abishalom now abishalom
[1:31:52] is Absalom so now he is the son he his
[1:31:56] mother is the daughter of absolum a man
[1:31:58] who had rebellion and pride and
[1:32:00] arrogancy and foolishness in him he's
[1:32:04] not coming from some great
[1:32:06] lineup but he's got a little bit of
[1:32:08] David in there it says and ASA did that
[1:32:11] which was right in the eyes of the Lord
[1:32:13] as did David his father and he took away
[1:32:15] the sodomites out of the land and
[1:32:16] removed all the idols that his fathers
[1:32:18] have made now watch this we're talking
[1:32:20] about worshiping a weakness he says and
[1:32:22] also make a his mother even her he
[1:32:25] removed from being Queen because she had
[1:32:28] made an idol in a Grove and ASA
[1:32:30] destroyed her Idol and burnt it by the
[1:32:32] Brook Kidron so ASA uses his position
[1:32:35] now to do things that his father
[1:32:36] wouldn't do brother Paul preached on a
[1:32:39] new generation and I'm Not For a Moment
[1:32:41] saying here that our parents did things
[1:32:42] we didn't do but one thing's for sure
[1:32:44] we've got a hold to the word when our
[1:32:45] parents have moved on Amen the the the
[1:32:48] young men that have come up and taken
[1:32:50] positions of authority and influence in
[1:32:52] this church we've got to hold the line
[1:32:54] amen we don't back away from those
[1:32:56] things one inch one inch because if we
[1:32:58] give Satan an inch he'll take a foot we
[1:33:00] give him a foot he'll take a mile we've
[1:33:02] got to hold fast to the things which we
[1:33:03] know are true and Ace has no respect of
[1:33:05] persons and so his mother is an idolator
[1:33:08] he says you cannot be in a position here
[1:33:10] don't worry I'm not trying to take
[1:33:11] anybody out of
[1:33:14] position but he says you can't do this
[1:33:18] you're an example to the people you're
[1:33:20] my mother and you're doing this and
[1:33:22] they're looking at you I'm sorry you
[1:33:24] cannot be in this position and he takes
[1:33:26] her out of position and he takes her
[1:33:29] idols and he destroys
[1:33:30] them but catch this cuz he's trying to
[1:33:33] hit the reset button he says but the
[1:33:35] high places were not removed but
[1:33:37] nevertheless asa's heart was perfect
[1:33:40] with the Lord all his days see we see
[1:33:42] here this thing and we're going to get
[1:33:43] into this in a moment with Paul ASA had
[1:33:45] a desire to do right but his courage
[1:33:48] only took him so far his natural
[1:33:51] inclinations could only take him so far
[1:33:53] and so he had an imperfect work but he
[1:33:56] did a great work and he brought them
[1:33:57] back to the true worship of God but what
[1:33:59] he didn't do was take away all of their
[1:34:01] Idols but he himself took it and he said
[1:34:03] an example amen but we look through
[1:34:05] there and we've got David was perfect
[1:34:07] Solomon started perfect and then went by
[1:34:10] way of idolatry and then riab comes and
[1:34:12] he's no good and then abim comes and
[1:34:14] he's no good and then we got ASA and
[1:34:15] he's a pretty good guy why am I saying
[1:34:17] this church I'm saying this to say it
[1:34:19] doesn't matter who your parents are it
[1:34:21] guarantees nothing good and it
[1:34:22] guarantees nothing bad bad we're going
[1:34:24] to deal with issues in these bodies that
[1:34:26] has nothing to do with anything as far
[1:34:28] as we can tell but it's there it's there
[1:34:31] just because of the Fallen nature the
[1:34:33] Fallen flesh that we live in our
[1:34:35] attitude our mindset our likes our
[1:34:36] dislikes our emotions our approach with
[1:34:38] people our words how we do all these
[1:34:40] things it's all tied to our family line
[1:34:43] and there's a natural inclination built
[1:34:45] into this body that each and every one
[1:34:46] of us is living in amen it's literally
[1:34:49] encoded into our
[1:34:52] bodies isn't is it amazing how you look
[1:34:55] and especially those of you that have
[1:34:56] multiple children how different you can
[1:34:58] have three or four children that come
[1:34:59] from the same couple why they're encoded
[1:35:03] different ways they've got a genetic
[1:35:05] structure there amen but here's the
[1:35:07] thing like I said earlier we want to
[1:35:08] make some of it good because it seems
[1:35:11] good and some of it bad because it's
[1:35:13] obviously bad but that is completely
[1:35:15] contrary to the
[1:35:16] word Paul said this Romans 7 are you
[1:35:20] with me this
[1:35:22] evening Paul says for I know that in me
[1:35:25] that is in my flesh dwelleth no good
[1:35:30] thing you say well boy I I I've got a
[1:35:33] gentle nature and my son has it my
[1:35:35] daughter has it that's a good thing no
[1:35:36] sir Paul said there is no good thing
[1:35:40] we're going to get into why he says for
[1:35:42] to will is present with me but how to
[1:35:45] perform that which is good I find not he
[1:35:47] says even when we want to do good even
[1:35:49] if we have a natural inclination to do
[1:35:51] good somehow we seem seem to keep doing
[1:35:54] the wrong thing he says for the good
[1:35:57] that I would I do not and but the evil
[1:36:00] which I would not that I do can't do
[1:36:02] right when I want to and all I do is
[1:36:04] wrong even when I want to do
[1:36:05] right church this is a prophet
[1:36:09] speaking if he's got issues guess what
[1:36:13] we all have issues amen let's not get
[1:36:16] high on our horse and think well that's
[1:36:17] just the other
[1:36:19] people Amen brother Vel
[1:36:23] but then he jumps down like I said I'm
[1:36:26] not here to drag us down I'm here with a
[1:36:28] message of hope I'm here with a message
[1:36:29] of promise I'm here to show you what the
[1:36:31] word can do by the Holy Ghost but Paul
[1:36:34] says but I see another law in my members
[1:36:36] in my body Waring against the law of my
[1:36:38] mind he says I've got one thing up here
[1:36:39] and I've got another thing here he says
[1:36:41] and bringing me into captivity to the
[1:36:43] law of sin which is in my members he
[1:36:46] says this body is bound in sin and there
[1:36:50] is no freeing the
[1:36:52] flesh it's always there it's hardcoded
[1:36:56] it's in your DNA to not do the things of
[1:36:59] God and he says oh Wretched Man that I
[1:37:02] am who shall deliver me from the body of
[1:37:04] this death now most of us know what's
[1:37:06] coming in re in Romans 8 but let me say
[1:37:09] this you will not get to Romans 8 unless
[1:37:10] you go through Romans 7 first because we
[1:37:13] have to realize where we are we have to
[1:37:15] realize the battle we're in we have to
[1:37:17] be honest about it we've got to know our
[1:37:18] strengths and our weaknesses because
[1:37:20] Satan loves to focus on those things but
[1:37:22] the thing is people always say I can't
[1:37:24] help it and you know what they're
[1:37:26] right when we say we can't help it we
[1:37:29] can't help it it's literally built into
[1:37:30] us there's something inside of them
[1:37:32] that's driving
[1:37:33] us okay can I I'll use myself when I
[1:37:37] look at my mom and my dad I can look at
[1:37:40] things and and I can see strengths and I
[1:37:43] can see lots of potential but I can see
[1:37:45] lots of weaknesses and with them come
[1:37:46] great pitfalls okay I could go on and on
[1:37:49] and guess what both my parents
[1:37:51] contribute to the good and both my
[1:37:53] parents contribute to the bad amen my
[1:37:56] mom is filled with the Holy Ghost that
[1:37:58] does not make her genetic
[1:37:59] predispositions perfect my dad is not
[1:38:02] serving the lord and does not have the
[1:38:03] Holy Ghost and doesn't that doesn't make
[1:38:04] what he brings any worse than my mom's
[1:38:06] it's just flesh and it's sinful flesh in
[1:38:08] those things amen but as I said earlier
[1:38:11] even the good things can be
[1:38:13] pitfalls maybe you know there are some
[1:38:15] people that are just born to work and
[1:38:18] you give them a task and they'll work
[1:38:19] and they'll work but here's the thing
[1:38:21] that can be taken and turned into
[1:38:24] workaholic you take somebody that's got
[1:38:26] Charisma and that can turn into somebody
[1:38:28] that is manipulating and seducing people
[1:38:31] it can be a good thing or it can be a
[1:38:32] bad thing and here's the thing in this
[1:38:34] flesh dwells no good thing and so it
[1:38:36] always leans to imbalance to destruction
[1:38:40] and to selfishness that's what this body
[1:38:42] is inclined towards because It Wants
[1:38:44] What It Wants and we think that because
[1:38:46] it wants it it must be good for it and
[1:38:48] that is obviously not true that's
[1:38:50] obviously not true
[1:38:51] amen but here's the thing
[1:38:54] I don't have to be bound by my strengths
[1:38:57] nor do I have to be bound by my
[1:38:59] weaknesses that's what we're here to
[1:39:01] talk about is to tell you they're in
[1:39:02] there but say you don't have to be bound
[1:39:04] by those things I don't have to fear
[1:39:06] those things I don't have to worry about
[1:39:08] those things in me in my spouse in my
[1:39:10] children why because I can do all things
[1:39:12] through Christ who strengthens me
[1:39:14] there's liberty for us amen I don't have
[1:39:16] to live in the fleshly inheritance of
[1:39:18] Lanny and Sandy klet I don't have to
[1:39:20] live there I don't have to worry about
[1:39:21] it listen Paul the Apostle came from a
[1:39:23] great family and look at all the issues
[1:39:25] he
[1:39:26] had but he didn't stay in those
[1:39:29] issues like I said many of you know my
[1:39:31] father I love him dearly but he's a very
[1:39:33] flawed person living in the reality of
[1:39:35] those flaws
[1:39:42] tonight I said it I mean it's true it's
[1:39:46] okay to say amen I won't be hurt by it
[1:39:48] as brother Gerald obviously saw there
[1:39:51] amen but if I stayed up and I and I I
[1:39:54] dwelt on the things that my father could
[1:39:57] potentially have passed on to me
[1:39:58] genetically I would never get any
[1:40:02] sleep
[1:40:04] amen but here's what I tell you what I
[1:40:06] do I guard my life against those things
[1:40:11] which have been shown to follow my
[1:40:13] family line and that's not fear that's
[1:40:17] Prudence amen listen we don't have a
[1:40:20] problem with alcohol but if we had
[1:40:21] alcohol there's one thing I would make
[1:40:23] make sure I never did and that's drink
[1:40:25] alcohol you know what we have in my in
[1:40:27] my dad's side
[1:40:29] infidelity so you know what that means
[1:40:32] is that anyone that I don't truly know
[1:40:34] and trust has the Holy Ghost I don't
[1:40:36] want to have anything to do with them if
[1:40:37] they're a
[1:40:38] female I put up a natural barrier there
[1:40:42] my wife and I were talking about this I
[1:40:43] said I don't even know when a woman's
[1:40:44] FLIR flirting with me anymore because I
[1:40:46] just am not looking for it and I don't
[1:40:47] even understand what they're doing why
[1:40:50] because I put a barrier there that says
[1:40:52] listen I have a wife that is the only
[1:40:55] woman I need a relationship with in this
[1:40:56] world and so every other woman gets put
[1:40:59] behind the wall of intimacy of any sort
[1:41:02] emotional physical intellectual all of
[1:41:05] those things there's only one woman for
[1:41:07] that and that's my wife why because I've
[1:41:09] seen what it does in my family and my
[1:41:12] dad suffered from it his dad suffered
[1:41:14] from it and I guarantee you that it's
[1:41:16] been hitting trees all the way down
[1:41:17] through our family line why so I guard
[1:41:20] that not out of fear listen I'm just
[1:41:23] following what the word says I should do
[1:41:24] in the first place but I'm extra careful
[1:41:26] about that because there's an
[1:41:27] inclination in my family for it amen we
[1:41:31] ought to guard Our Lives by staying away
[1:41:33] from anything that's sketchy anything
[1:41:35] that's against the word but if there's a
[1:41:37] natural inclination in the family above
[1:41:39] all guard those remember brother ra says
[1:41:41] the devil has one punch coming you've
[1:41:43] got one area of your life what I do is
[1:41:46] anything that I think could be there I
[1:41:48] guard it I guard it and I don't even
[1:41:50] open that door I don't even open that
[1:41:53] door by God's grace amen and that's our
[1:41:55] that's our part of it is to keep them
[1:41:57] covered not feed
[1:41:59] them but the point is this this body has
[1:42:02] all sorts of unsavory
[1:42:04] inclinations it has things it wants to
[1:42:06] do it has things it likes and the word
[1:42:08] says it's wrong and the body says but I
[1:42:09] want it
[1:42:10] anyways amen but here's the thing for
[1:42:13] the believer this body is not in
[1:42:16] control and if it is it doesn't have to
[1:42:19] be in control if I could put it that way
[1:42:21] Paul gives us hope Paul gives us answer
[1:42:23] for our weaknesses I love Paul because
[1:42:25] he's so honest about who he is and what
[1:42:27] he's dealt with and these different
[1:42:28] things and he spends all of Romans 7
[1:42:30] telling us of this great battle of that
[1:42:33] that each one of us faces in these
[1:42:34] natural bodies these things that are
[1:42:36] inherited intrinsic to being in a fallen
[1:42:38] condition even as a born- again child of
[1:42:41] God it's okay to be honest with our
[1:42:43] struggles like he did in Romans 7 but
[1:42:45] we've got to make the step now into
[1:42:47] Romans
[1:42:48] 8 and Paul says
[1:42:51] this there is there for
[1:42:54] now no
[1:42:56] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[1:42:59] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:43:02] after the spirit remember what 1
[1:43:03] Corinthians 12:13 says by one Spirit
[1:43:05] we're baptized into one body we are not
[1:43:08] under condemnation just because this
[1:43:10] body wants things that are against the
[1:43:12] word that's what Paul says he's been set
[1:43:14] free from is the condemnation that comes
[1:43:17] with
[1:43:20] desire he's saying that hasn't got a
[1:43:22] hold hold on me anymore that doesn't
[1:43:25] rule me that doesn't make me feel
[1:43:28] bad why he says because I'm walking in
[1:43:31] the
[1:43:33] spirit and when we fall we always have a
[1:43:36] way back Paul says I'm not under
[1:43:38] condemnation for anything that happens
[1:43:40] in my life now why because as a believer
[1:43:43] in sincere repentance we always have a
[1:43:45] way back to fellowship with God it's
[1:43:48] always there his grace never fails this
[1:43:50] Paul says nothing can separate us from
[1:43:52] the love of God if we'll repent
[1:43:55] amen but then he says this for the law
[1:43:57] of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus
[1:44:00] what's that it's the law of Grace by the
[1:44:01] blood of Christ hath made me free from
[1:44:03] the law of sin and death for what the
[1:44:06] law could not do in that it was weak
[1:44:08] through the flesh what's he saying he's
[1:44:09] saying this body could never please God
[1:44:12] so don't think it's ever going to please
[1:44:15] God he says God sending his own son in
[1:44:19] the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin
[1:44:21] condemn sin in the flesh in other words
[1:44:23] he puts it in the flesh and says that's
[1:44:25] not you that's just flesh he says that
[1:44:28] the righteousness of the law might be
[1:44:30] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[1:44:32] flesh but after the spirit he says for
[1:44:35] they that are after The Flesh do mind
[1:44:37] the things of the flesh but they that
[1:44:39] are after the spirit the things of the
[1:44:41] spirit he says for to be carnally minded
[1:44:44] is death but to be spiritually minded is
[1:44:46] life and peace what is the greatest
[1:44:48] battle ever fought in the
[1:44:50] mind how you look at these things will
[1:44:53] help you get the Liberty from these
[1:44:55] things because if we're caught up in the
[1:44:57] carnality of this flesh we're bound but
[1:44:59] if we're caught up by the baptism of the
[1:45:01] Holy Ghost in our lives that takes us
[1:45:03] Beyond those things then we have a
[1:45:04] liberty
[1:45:07] now he said because the carnal mind is
[1:45:09] enmity against God for it is not subject
[1:45:12] to the law of God neither indeed can be
[1:45:15] so then they that are in the flesh
[1:45:17] cannot please God so don't try and make
[1:45:20] that a part of your Christian walk
[1:45:23] it's just dead flesh it's Fallen flesh
[1:45:27] it is failed flesh it is sinful flesh
[1:45:30] there's nothing good in it don't drag it
[1:45:32] into your relationship with
[1:45:35] God why he says but ye are oh he says so
[1:45:40] then they that are in the flesh cannot
[1:45:42] please God but ye are not in the flesh
[1:45:46] Hallelujah ye are not in the flesh he
[1:45:48] says but you're in the spirit if so be
[1:45:51] that the spirit of God dwells in you
[1:45:53] now if any man have not the spirit of
[1:45:55] God he is none of his so there's a
[1:45:57] difference there's something that is
[1:45:59] shifted now to where he's La he's lost
[1:46:01] in this flesh it's overcoming him it's
[1:46:04] condemning him but he comes into Romans
[1:46:05] 8 and he says now I've got something
[1:46:07] that's taken me beyond that and it's the
[1:46:10] spirit that sets me above
[1:46:12] it he would say this in second
[1:46:14] Corinthians 5 he says therefore If any
[1:46:17] man be in Christ remember what he said
[1:46:20] that that uh he says um those that are
[1:46:23] in there is no condemnation to them
[1:46:25] which are in Christ Jesus then he says
[1:46:27] therefore If any man be in Christ he is
[1:46:30] a new
[1:46:32] creature that word creature literally
[1:46:34] means creation he is a new creation amen
[1:46:38] not a made over one not just a washed
[1:46:41] one not a fixed one you are a brand new
[1:46:44] creation by the
[1:46:47] spirit amen completely new and he
[1:46:51] confirms it he says old things things
[1:46:53] are passed away passed away means dead
[1:46:56] old things are dead behold all things
[1:47:00] are become new Hallelujah that's the
[1:47:04] place we stand in tonight Church you say
[1:47:06] I can't get over this you can get over
[1:47:08] it you can get past it you can overcome
[1:47:10] it if you dwell and live in the spirit
[1:47:12] if you're filled with the spirit of God
[1:47:14] remember what brother Brandon would say
[1:47:15] he he came to this point and he says I
[1:47:17] am no longer the son of Charles and Ella
[1:47:21] brandham
[1:47:23] you know what that does church that sets
[1:47:25] you free from what Charles and Ella
[1:47:26] brandham were that sets you free from
[1:47:29] what William brandham is that sets me
[1:47:30] free from who Jonathan klette was is
[1:47:32] because I'm no longer Jonathan klette
[1:47:35] because he says I heard an eagle voice
[1:47:37] that called me beyond what this flesh
[1:47:39] held me back in and it took me to a
[1:47:41] place where the word could have
[1:47:42] preeminence in my life and I could have
[1:47:44] victory over things that my daddy
[1:47:46] couldn't and my Mommy couldn't and my
[1:47:47] brother couldn't and my sister couldn't
[1:47:50] I've got a victory that no one in my
[1:47:51] family has by the spirit that's the
[1:47:55] greatest thing I've said this so many
[1:47:56] times the last few service the greatest
[1:47:58] thing you can recognize is I am a child
[1:48:00] of God I am not a child of my parents I
[1:48:03] am a child of almighty God and His royal
[1:48:07] blood flows through my veins and I who
[1:48:10] is wretched and blind as can be can say
[1:48:13] praise God praise God I'm a child of the
[1:48:16] king
[1:48:17] amen I want to share a story as we start
[1:48:20] to close
[1:48:23] I want to show what this looks like and
[1:48:26] this is going to help the parents and
[1:48:27] this will help the young people brother
[1:48:29] Bram gives his story and I'm sorry it's
[1:48:32] a little bit long but I think it'll help
[1:48:33] us tonight he says for instance just a
[1:48:35] few days ago I was called on a scene a
[1:48:37] little something going on there was a
[1:48:39] fine young man a very fine boy he was
[1:48:41] going with a little girl he was courting
[1:48:43] her very fine little girl out of a fine
[1:48:45] family that's exactly what we want isn't
[1:48:48] it good boys going with good girls
[1:48:50] what's the problem he says and this boy
[1:48:52] all of a sudden came up with a some kind
[1:48:54] of an idea and he just walked away now
[1:48:57] brother B doesn't give us details here I
[1:48:59] if I were to guess I would say he
[1:49:01] probably committed to marrying her and
[1:49:02] then walked away that's what I think but
[1:49:05] I that's just me he did something wrong
[1:49:08] to the little girl and as much as
[1:49:09] promised her to do a certain thing and
[1:49:11] then didn't do it that's what makes me
[1:49:12] think that and instead of coming to the
[1:49:14] girl and apologizing like a gentleman
[1:49:16] should do he it just wasn't in him to do
[1:49:19] it good boy from a good family
[1:49:23] Now Catch what happens
[1:49:25] here and the father and the mother
[1:49:27] called me to the scene and saidwe would
[1:49:29] desire to know what is wrong with our
[1:49:31] boy and he says now it's not easy to do
[1:49:34] sometimes but you must be truthful and
[1:49:37] honest he's not saying he the prophet
[1:49:40] has to be it he's saying you as parents
[1:49:42] have to be truthful and honest about
[1:49:44] what's going
[1:49:47] on he says therefore the boy was a
[1:49:49] Christian as far as a Believer he had
[1:49:52] repented and had been baptized and had
[1:49:53] his position among the Believers but yet
[1:49:56] had not received the baptism of the Holy
[1:49:58] Spirit no matter how much he thought he
[1:50:00] had he says you thinking you have and
[1:50:03] having it is two very different two
[1:50:06] different things he says you might be
[1:50:08] able to try and say you have and you
[1:50:09] might be able to show some evidence of
[1:50:11] some emotion but unless your life is
[1:50:13] vindicating what you're professing to
[1:50:15] have you still haven't got it no matter
[1:50:17] how many motions how much you jump run
[1:50:19] Sensations speaking in tongues shouting
[1:50:22] whatever you might lay it upon it's all
[1:50:23] right I believe in all that too but
[1:50:25] unless your life copes with your
[1:50:27] testimony then you haven't got it in
[1:50:29] other words unless you know what coping
[1:50:30] is those of you that have worked with
[1:50:32] with materials before a cope is when you
[1:50:34] cut two materials so that they fit
[1:50:35] perfectly together and he's saying if
[1:50:37] your testimony doesn't cope exactly with
[1:50:39] your life if what you say you believe
[1:50:41] and you are doesn't cope with what you
[1:50:43] actually are he says then there's a
[1:50:45] problem right he says because the fruit
[1:50:49] of the spirit vindicates what you are
[1:50:51] just like the fruit of any any tree
[1:50:53] tells what it is Jesus said by their
[1:50:55] fruits you shall know them now he's
[1:50:56] trying to tell them he's going to tell
[1:50:57] them what's wrong with their son but
[1:50:59] catch why he's willing to do it Church
[1:51:01] he's willing to do it because they say
[1:51:03] we want it straight we want the truth
[1:51:06] brother brandom we don't want our image
[1:51:09] preserved we don't just want to facade
[1:51:12] we want to bring him to a right place to
[1:51:14] a reality in God above all
[1:51:18] else they're want to know is it a spirit
[1:51:20] is it a false anointing is he under some
[1:51:22] influence what can we do how can we help
[1:51:24] is there anything we can do church
[1:51:25] that's what real parenting is lay the
[1:51:28] family pride aside and say God we need
[1:51:31] you because we're all in Fallen
[1:51:34] flesh amen they want an answer they want
[1:51:37] Liberty for their son more than they
[1:51:39] want their image
[1:51:40] preserved he says now this young
[1:51:42] fellow's parents we're talking about
[1:51:43] these things family weaknesses his
[1:51:45] mother is German no reflection on the
[1:51:48] German but there's a strain in that
[1:51:50] family and that is they'll just sit and
[1:51:52] you can talk to them and they'll just
[1:51:53] stare you right in the face brother
[1:51:55] Gerald said that's what I used to do in
[1:51:57] church of course you're not supposed to
[1:51:58] talk back in church but he says that
[1:52:01] girl's sister the mother of this boy her
[1:52:03] sister I've come down the street many
[1:52:04] mornings and this young lady would be
[1:52:06] sitting out there in the yard and I'd
[1:52:07] say good morning to you and she'd just
[1:52:08] look at me and I'd stop and I'd say sure
[1:52:10] if I'm morning she'd just stand and look
[1:52:12] right at you an intelligent woman and
[1:52:14] I'd say come and up and see us sometime
[1:52:16] and she'd just stand and look he says
[1:52:18] she's got a way that she doesn't respond
[1:52:20] to things
[1:52:22] then he says well her brothers are that
[1:52:24] way father and mother's that way now the
[1:52:27] father of that boy okay so the the the
[1:52:29] mother has a strain of not responding to
[1:52:31] things they says let's talk about the
[1:52:34] daddy now the father of the boy is
[1:52:36] strictly an Irishman Moody High tempered
[1:52:39] High strong do we have any Irish people
[1:52:40] here I think we do we do listen up here
[1:52:44] you
[1:52:45] are Moody High tempered High strong we
[1:52:47] we picked on the Germans we got to pick
[1:52:49] on the Irish
[1:52:50] right he says that that's his whole
[1:52:53] family like that except one other out of
[1:52:55] the family that's converted this mother
[1:52:57] and father both are Christians filled
[1:52:59] with the Holy Ghost and they brought
[1:53:01] this young man up in the way of the Lord
[1:53:03] and now the young man's about 17 or 18
[1:53:05] years old something along there very
[1:53:07] fine kid and he's been a real model boy
[1:53:09] at home nice kid brother Braham has
[1:53:12] nothing to say bad about this boy and
[1:53:14] yet this boy has done something that's
[1:53:16] clearly wrong and then he says and he's
[1:53:19] got a brother that's just vice
[1:53:21] versa same family same lineage he says
[1:53:24] this boy's a good boy except for this
[1:53:26] one thing and then he's got a brother
[1:53:28] that's just a black sheep Jacob and
[1:53:31] Esau same family same parents two very
[1:53:34] different
[1:53:35] boys like Paul and
[1:53:38] Joe
[1:53:40] no right but I want you to see this he
[1:53:45] says the mother's family lives close to
[1:53:47] a fine church but do you think they'd
[1:53:49] ever come over there no and they they
[1:53:52] know it's right but it's just not in
[1:53:54] them to ask forgiveness or ask pardoning
[1:53:57] they just won't do it it's just not in
[1:53:59] them he says now the genes and the
[1:54:02] father and the mother of this boy no
[1:54:04] matter how much they are converted Still
[1:54:07] Remains the flesh that's been bred out
[1:54:09] to this boy therefore the boy has a
[1:54:12] complex in him just like his mother's
[1:54:14] family and they are not forgiving they
[1:54:17] will not apologize and that's where that
[1:54:19] boy stands so in other words this boy
[1:54:21] has an inherent problem in his body and
[1:54:24] he can't do a thing about it in his
[1:54:26] present
[1:54:29] condition he says now I said to the
[1:54:31] father no matter how much youve raised
[1:54:32] him up I said now look at you out of
[1:54:35] your family all of them drunks fighting
[1:54:38] shooting cutting and so forth and then
[1:54:40] now look at your family to the mother
[1:54:41] there are a bunch of people just sit
[1:54:43] there and won't speak very independent
[1:54:44] and so forth irreverent to
[1:54:47] religion that's a hopeless combination
[1:54:52] but I love this he says' but it's not
[1:54:55] you he says OU the only one of all your
[1:54:59] sisters and brothers and you are sweet
[1:55:01] sister Brenda kind and
[1:55:04] forgiving amen
[1:55:07] amen what does that and your tree part
[1:55:11] of that family tree yet you have
[1:55:14] received the Holy Ghost that's the thing
[1:55:17] that made you tender and sweet it's not
[1:55:20] your people anymore it's it's your
[1:55:23] Christ that lives in you
[1:55:26] Hallelujah she still got everything in
[1:55:28] her flesh but it has become subject to
[1:55:31] the Christ that lives inside of her
[1:55:33] Hallelujah he says your whole family is
[1:55:36] like that except you why because it's
[1:55:39] your Christ that's living in you now
[1:55:42] that's why you are the way you are
[1:55:43] sister Brenda that's why you are the way
[1:55:45] you are sister Morin you look at your
[1:55:48] families my wife's the same thing look
[1:55:50] at your families and but for the great
[1:55:52] of God there go you but Christ lives in
[1:55:55] you and it sets you apart from
[1:55:56] everything that's dragging them
[1:56:00] down
[1:56:02] Hallelujah you know we tend to focus on
[1:56:04] the things that reflect our parents and
[1:56:06] our family heritage and these
[1:56:09] things what about the things that
[1:56:11] reflect the Christ that lives within us
[1:56:14] hey sometimes Satan gets things over on
[1:56:16] us but let's focus on the things that
[1:56:18] we've gotten over on satan mean let's
[1:56:21] focus on the victories that we have in
[1:56:23] our lives that reflect our heavenly
[1:56:25] father you know as I was sitting in that
[1:56:27] office something came to me and it said
[1:56:29] you know what happens so often is when
[1:56:30] we're with family we revert to family
[1:56:34] traits we ought not to do that because
[1:56:37] there's a Christ that's living in us
[1:56:38] that that family needs and what happens
[1:56:41] is we say well they understand us they
[1:56:43] know us that's the way we do it no you
[1:56:46] used to be that now you're a child of
[1:56:49] the king now you're the bride of Christ
[1:56:52] it's your testimony it's your Rising
[1:56:54] above those things that could save those
[1:56:57] ones that are still Bound by their
[1:56:58] family genetics and traits amen God help
[1:57:01] us to do
[1:57:03] that so he says to the wife says to the
[1:57:06] mother it's not you it's Christ Living
[1:57:08] in you now you're not bound by those
[1:57:09] things that are bounding your boy then I
[1:57:11] said to the father look at your family
[1:57:13] prac practically all of them are drunks
[1:57:15] and so forth I said and how moody and
[1:57:17] high tempered and high strong but you're
[1:57:19] not you're kind forgiving what is it the
[1:57:22] Holy Spirit you're no more what you are
[1:57:25] in this flesh he says it's Christ in you
[1:57:28] and I said now that same thing has to
[1:57:30] happen to your
[1:57:33] son our children are not saved by Mommy
[1:57:36] and Daddy Having the Holy Ghost he says
[1:57:39] the father raised up and said my son
[1:57:41] went to the altar he was baptized
[1:57:43] correctly in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:57:45] and water baptism in the pool said I
[1:57:47] know my son has come to Christ and I
[1:57:49] said that may be all right all the out
[1:57:52] Ward motions he might be identified as a
[1:57:54] Believer with the Believers but until he
[1:57:57] is regenerated born again I'd advise
[1:58:00] that young man to never marry a woman
[1:58:02] he'll make hell on Earth for her until
[1:58:04] that gentle sweet forgiving Spirit of
[1:58:08] Christ comes in he says then that will
[1:58:10] be a paradox in itself to take the very
[1:58:12] nature of a boy that's bred between
[1:58:14] father and mother now catch this young
[1:58:17] people listen up and yet in his
[1:58:20] intellectuality he is trying his best to
[1:58:24] overcome it don't we see that not just
[1:58:28] in our kids we see it in ourselves
[1:58:30] sometimes
[1:58:31] Amen in their intellectually they know
[1:58:34] that they ought not to do it and so
[1:58:36] they're trying to defeat it in their
[1:58:39] mind and we praise the Lord that they're
[1:58:41] fighting that they see that this is not
[1:58:43] the way they ought to be but catch what
[1:58:45] he says here he can't do it he'll never
[1:58:49] overcome it Christ will have to over
[1:58:52] overcome it and when he lets Christ in
[1:58:54] then he's already overcome then it'll be
[1:58:57] a perfect Paradox when a man is born of
[1:59:00] the spirit of
[1:59:01] God you we look at our kids inclinations
[1:59:04] at times and and we can be dismissive of
[1:59:06] it because we say well I was there and
[1:59:10] now I don't I used to be that way and
[1:59:14] now I'm not but that's not the answer
[1:59:16] for our children the answer is to teach
[1:59:19] them now because they're going to have
[1:59:21] to cope with with that until they get
[1:59:23] the Holy Ghost and the greatest way they
[1:59:26] can cope is by being taught what's right
[1:59:27] and wrong and being held to that
[1:59:29] standard of right and wrong you know
[1:59:34] it's we coddle them when they're young
[1:59:36] don't we because they're
[1:59:38] cute but here's the thing is if we
[1:59:41] cuddle it when they're young guess what
[1:59:43] happens is they grow into cuddled adults
[1:59:46] and you know what cuddled adults are
[1:59:49] useless
[1:59:50] useless cuz CU nobody's taught them how
[1:59:53] to get up pull themselves up by the
[1:59:56] bootstraps and just get down to things
[1:59:58] to get real with God to get it to get in
[2:00:01] into the path that they're supposed to
[2:00:03] be doing and so often what happens and
[2:00:05] this is we're being very honest here
[2:00:07] tonight sometimes we refuse to check
[2:00:09] their weakness because we've got the
[2:00:11] very same one that we haven't
[2:00:13] overcome
[2:00:15] amen we tell our kids you can't have
[2:00:17] screen time and then we put four hours a
[2:00:18] day on our
[2:00:20] phone we're hypocrites
[2:00:23] we've got a weakness and we're trying to
[2:00:25] tell our kids you can't do it and
[2:00:26] they're looking at us and saying but you
[2:00:27] do it and you know what they're
[2:00:29] absolutely right and so they need to see
[2:00:32] victory in us so that they know that
[2:00:33] there's victory for them as well we're
[2:00:35] not here there to discipline them into
[2:00:37] Victory we're there to show there's a
[2:00:39] way to live above these things and you
[2:00:41] can help yourself if you stay away from
[2:00:43] it but in the end the victory is not
[2:00:45] going to come through discipline it's
[2:00:46] going to come by the baptism of the Holy
[2:00:48] Ghost in their lives
[2:00:50] amen David struggled David the king of
[2:00:53] Israel struggled to correct his sons and
[2:00:54] we saw that Rebellion prevailed so far
[2:00:56] down his family line he struggled with
[2:00:59] Absalom and these different ones and
[2:01:00] then Solomon it got into riabal and
[2:01:02] these different ones what's the problem
[2:01:04] God gives our children God-fearing Holy
[2:01:06] Ghost filled parents and then we coddle
[2:01:10] instead of train and AD
[2:01:13] admonish God hasn't given our children
[2:01:16] Holy Ghost filled parents so that we can
[2:01:19] let them buy with everything we've got
[2:01:21] to be honest with these things that's
[2:01:23] why I share the things I do from this
[2:01:25] Pulpit so you can
[2:01:26] see hey been there struggled with it got
[2:01:30] the victory over most of it still
[2:01:32] getting the victory over some of it so
[2:01:34] you can see that there's a path there's
[2:01:35] a progression but there is a victory to
[2:01:37] be had in these sorts of things because
[2:01:39] listen if we don't teach them how to
[2:01:41] deal with these things Satan will teach
[2:01:43] them how to dwell in their weaknesses in
[2:01:45] their hurts and their pains and their
[2:01:48] excuses and it will lead them to a place
[2:01:49] where they don't even want a changing
[2:01:51] experience with Jes Jesus Christ because
[2:01:53] they've been taught it's okay to stay
[2:01:54] that
[2:01:57] way brother Braham says it this way God
[2:02:00] doesn't have any
[2:02:01] grandchildren the old Pentecostal father
[2:02:03] and mother under an experience brought
[2:02:05] you in and you just come into the church
[2:02:07] and sit there and automatically you are
[2:02:08] Pentecostal he's talking about the
[2:02:10] original Pentecost he says he doesn't
[2:02:12] have grandchildren he only has Sons and
[2:02:14] Daughters you have to pay the same price
[2:02:16] and get the same holy ghost that they
[2:02:19] did you got to be a son and a daughter
[2:02:22] not a grandson and a granddaughter he's
[2:02:24] not an old doting grandfather soft and
[2:02:26] lets his kids get by with anything bless
[2:02:28] their little hearts that's n and Pop's
[2:02:31] job isn't it not the parents he says he
[2:02:34] is God the Eternal one look at all the
[2:02:38] things brother brand mentioned about in
[2:02:39] that family drunks hot teered Moody High
[2:02:41] Strung unmoving unable to apologize
[2:02:44] unable to Humble themselves that's a hot
[2:02:46] mess of a
[2:02:48] family and we've all got it we've all
[2:02:51] got it if we go go far enough back
[2:02:52] that's a hot mass of a family and you
[2:02:54] combine two of those together and you
[2:02:56] get it even worse that's why the world
[2:02:58] is where it is is because it keeps
[2:03:00] getting worse not getting better because
[2:03:01] it's Satan's
[2:03:03] Eden and so our children come into this
[2:03:05] world and they're in a battle from the
[2:03:07] day they're born to come into that
[2:03:08] reality of being a new creation in
[2:03:10] Christ and so we've got to help them to
[2:03:12] realize that there's a battle but
[2:03:14] there's a victory and the way to that
[2:03:16] Victory is not through discipline it's
[2:03:18] through a new birth amen
[2:03:23] we have to help them fight those things
[2:03:25] by example teaching it yes by discipline
[2:03:29] but never by
[2:03:30] coddling like I said coddle children
[2:03:32] become useless
[2:03:34] adults I read in there in the office
[2:03:37] says he that spareth the rod hateth his
[2:03:39] son but he that loveth him chasteneth
[2:03:42] him be times that means all the
[2:03:45] time doesn't mean we beat on our kids
[2:03:48] but it do means we correct them
[2:03:49] according to the word so they can see
[2:03:51] there's a way to live life
[2:03:53] amen as we
[2:03:56] close Paul says this know ye not that
[2:04:00] the unrighteous shall not inherit the
[2:04:02] kingdom of God be not deceived neither
[2:04:05] fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers
[2:04:08] nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves
[2:04:10] with mankind nor thieves nor Covetous
[2:04:13] nor drunkards nor revilers nor
[2:04:14] extortioners shall inherit the kingdom
[2:04:16] of God he's just said half of these
[2:04:17] things belonged in the lives of that
[2:04:19] mother and father of that son andul Paul
[2:04:21] comes and says now that cannot inherit
[2:04:23] the kingdom of
[2:04:25] God now catch this and such were some of
[2:04:30] you you used to be this way why because
[2:04:33] that's the way the flesh inclines itself
[2:04:36] he says but you are washed ye are
[2:04:38] Sanctified but ye are justified in the
[2:04:41] name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit
[2:04:44] of our God Amen such were some of you
[2:04:50] you look at that
[2:04:53] some of those I could say sort of I
[2:04:55] could sort of see that you know but some
[2:04:58] of those are pretty
[2:05:00] rugged one of those is the worst I could
[2:05:03] imagine and it's preeminent
[2:05:06] today and Paul had those kinds of people
[2:05:09] in the Corinthian
[2:05:11] Church and every single one of them
[2:05:14] overcame
[2:05:16] it brother says this you are a slave and
[2:05:21] if you're a Christian you're a slave
[2:05:23] you're a bondslave of the bondslave of
[2:05:25] the Lord Jesus if there's two people of
[2:05:27] you both spirit and body and if you
[2:05:29] cater to the flesh you're a slave of the
[2:05:31] devil and you'll crucify the soul that's
[2:05:33] in you for the Bible said the soul that
[2:05:35] sinth that Soul shall die and you have
[2:05:38] to crucify the Flesh in order to be a
[2:05:40] bondslave in your flesh to be a servant
[2:05:43] of Jesus Christ he said so you're a
[2:05:45] slave anyway you take it you can't get
[2:05:47] away from it amen let's stand together
[2:05:50] if we would
[2:05:52] there's only one way to overcome these
[2:05:54] natural
[2:05:55] weaknesses that's the New Birth by the
[2:05:57] Holy Ghost baptism doesn't do it
[2:06:00] confession doesn't do it it takes a
[2:06:03] dying out it takes a dying out it takes
[2:06:06] a passing away it takes a becoming a new
[2:06:09] spiritual creation a new creature in
[2:06:11] Christ and what does that do Church it
[2:06:13] puts God on the throne of your heart and
[2:06:16] it puts God in your soul it puts the
[2:06:18] Holy Ghost in in in the position in the
[2:06:20] seat of power inside of your life you
[2:06:24] know we look at what Paul just talked
[2:06:25] about and those are some horrible things
[2:06:27] to deal with and hey we all have some of
[2:06:30] those inclinations and maybe some of us
[2:06:32] partook in them before we came to the
[2:06:35] Lord in these different things you know
[2:06:37] he said there talked about a feminite
[2:06:38] that's a homosexual lifestyle people ask
[2:06:40] us these days you know where do we stand
[2:06:42] on those alternate Lifestyles and you
[2:06:44] know what our our stance on those is the
[2:06:46] same as everything else that he listed
[2:06:47] in there amen I have no problem with
[2:06:51] people saying well they can't help it
[2:06:52] they're born that way they
[2:06:54] can't I can't help being a liar I can't
[2:06:57] help being a thief or a gossiper or a
[2:06:59] glutton or any of these things they're
[2:07:00] all part of a sinful
[2:07:02] nature but Paul says such were some of
[2:07:05] you so my stance is you got to get to
[2:07:08] the point of it was you but now it ain't
[2:07:10] you and there's only one way to do it
[2:07:12] and that's the New Birth by the baptism
[2:07:14] of the Holy Ghost amen the power of God
[2:07:16] through the word cleanse them sanctify
[2:07:19] them justify them as if you never ever
[2:07:21] did it in the first place prepared you
[2:07:23] for service and then put you into
[2:07:25] service xgay people became Holy Ghost
[2:07:28] filled
[2:07:29] Christians by the Holy Ghost so when
[2:07:33] somebody says where do you stand on it I
[2:07:34] say I've got a gospel that can deliver
[2:07:36] them from that the way it delivers me
[2:07:38] from everything that I'm dealing with
[2:07:39] and guess what God looks on that the
[2:07:41] same as he does on a liar same as those
[2:07:43] that live common
[2:07:45] law same as those that are out there
[2:07:47] lying and eating McDonald's every day
[2:07:49] it's all the same to God it's all sin
[2:07:51] and every single one of us needs the
[2:07:53] exact same solution and that is the
[2:07:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost to put the
[2:07:57] power of God inside to overcome all of
[2:08:00] this stuff amen they have a different
[2:08:03] struggle than I do but we've all sinned
[2:08:05] and come short of the glory of God and
[2:08:07] there's only one solution for every
[2:08:09] single one of us amen God's love is not
[2:08:12] to accept them as it is God's love will
[2:08:15] accept them as they are to change them
[2:08:17] into what they're supposed to be what
[2:08:19] love would it be that leaves them in
[2:08:20] their sinful condition unpleasing to
[2:08:23] him but we're a new
[2:08:25] creation amen we don't have to be bound
[2:08:29] by Family
[2:08:32] traits like I said I've talked about my
[2:08:34] father and his
[2:08:36] father church that
[2:08:38] cycle got broken when he gave me the
[2:08:41] Holy Ghost I've said this before you
[2:08:44] know I I remember talking to a guy one
[2:08:46] time and he tried to diagnose me with
[2:08:47] daddy issues finally my wife said I
[2:08:50] think you're barking up the wrong tree
[2:08:51] tree here cuz Jonathan doesn't have
[2:08:52] those things and this is my testimony is
[2:08:54] that when I received the Holy Ghost I
[2:08:57] knew I had a
[2:08:58] father and he was not flawed and he
[2:09:01] didn't leave me a bad
[2:09:03] inheritance he didn't leave me a a
[2:09:05] tainted
[2:09:06] will everything he left for me was pure
[2:09:09] and good and holy and I'm growing back
[2:09:13] into that image of the father that bore
[2:09:15] me truly amen Before Time Ever began
[2:09:19] amen Cycles can be broken they are being
[2:09:21] broken en in the lives of Believers
[2:09:23] today such were some of you some of us
[2:09:25] come from some pretty rough
[2:09:27] stock but yet we stand here today with
[2:09:30] the victory by God's grace by the
[2:09:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost to receive the
[2:09:34] word for our day and walk into a
[2:09:35] resurrection and a Rapture I say praise
[2:09:37] the Lord this morning amen that we've
[2:09:39] got an answer for Satan that we've got
[2:09:41] an answer for sin that we've got an
[2:09:42] answer for these bodies that it does not
[2:09:44] have to have dominion for us but we've
[2:09:46] got something that can be on the inside
[2:09:47] that can give us dominion over it amen
[2:09:50] amen let's bow our heads Heavenly
[2:09:53] Father Lord Jesus thank you Lord thank
[2:09:57] you Lord for an answer thank you Lord
[2:09:59] for a weapon Lord thank you for

[2:10:25] testimony this evening in this church
[2:10:27] Lord as we see Sons and Daughters of God
[2:10:29] being restored back to their rightful
[2:10:31] image but Lord we know it's a battle
[2:10:34] every day and we know we win sometimes
[2:10:36] and we lose sometimes and Lord we're
[2:10:38] here to get more more victories and less
[2:10:40] losses Lord we're wanting to come to the
[2:10:42] day where Satan is bound by
[2:10:44] circumstances that he can do nothing in
[2:10:46] our lives Lord I pray you lift up our
[2:10:48] faith Lord help us not to look to this
[2:10:50] flesh it's failings its sicknesses its
[2:10:52] inclinations Lord May condemnation be
[2:10:55] erased this very evening Lord but where
[2:10:57] conviction comes Lord May repentance

[2:11:01] relationship with you Lord and may we
[2:11:03] know that there's Victory and love
