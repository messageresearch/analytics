brother brandham said Jesus showed us he said when Satan tempted him he defeated him by the word it is written he said showing that the weakest Christian can defeat Satan with the word and then the characteristic of the Overcomer is he that can hear what the spirit says to the churches that's what we're looking for is a people that can hear it that can live it that can accept it can believe it can put it into action amen man God bless you just wanted to greet each one this morning amen good to have our different visitors here amen it's good to have brother George Smith with us as well it was a 20-day or 20 hour trip for him to come up with big delays we didn't get to bed till almost 2: a.m. on uh I guess it was Friday morning by the time we got to bed but he's made it through and he's here to to talk to us this morning and I have no idea ultimately what he's decided on he talk to me about a couple different things but it'll be a surprise this morning to see exactly what he says but uh we just want him to take his Liberty this morning I in brother brother George is a straight shooter amen straight shooter he's not going to fluff it up he's not going to make it something he's not he's just going to give it to a straight so we want him to have his Liberty this morning that he'd feel welcome amen let's just uh sing this one more time as he would come amen Oh by his word [Music] ien amen if we make it it'll be by his word w be because of your name who your grandpa was by his word amen it's good to be here this morning let's open the Bible to Acts chapter 1 Acts chapter 1 and begin at verse 6 when they therefore were come together who are they it's Jesus and 11 disciples remember one checked out at 11 when they were come together they asked him a very important political question Lord will you at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel this is only the second resurrected being they've seen they saw Lazarus now they see this one and that's the best thing they could come up with they're just like us right and he said unto them it is not for you all to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power but you shall receive power when after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and over in Judea and over in Samaria and all the way to New Finland last point on the planet and when they had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and the cloud received him out of their sight let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace and mercy to us we thank you Lord that you have called us unto your word because you knew before the foundation of the world that we'd be gathered in this nice place under the blood of Jesus Christ we're not here under the name of any church any uh hierarchy but under the blood of Jesus Christ we thank you for these who have come out this morning we pray that you'd bless each one help us Lord only to speak truth only things it would edify we ask this in jesus' name amen you may be seated it's good to be here and uh I'm here for three reasons one is Brother John invited and I'm very thankful and very thankful for a young man with Clear Vision that is now taken over may God bless brother Gerald we had a had a nice time last night okay that's reason number one reason number two I felt led of the Holy Ghost see when somebody invites well that's already like 51% but then we got to have the rest you know and so I felt led to be here and reason number three um as you know God deals in dreams now all my dreams disappear minute I open my eyes you know like some of you but some people dream uh spiritual dreams and so um I've got a good friend out west that uh God uses in dreams and so latest dream he had um he was he's telling me about it and he only speaks Spanish okay and so keep that in mind and so anyway he is um he's like a fly on the wall in brother brandom's living room in Jeffersonville that's the dream and so what he sees there Rebecca and I are sitting by the fireplace and over here in the the two chairs the sister brandham and brother Neville they're talking discussing things and um pretty soon brother Neville gets up to leave you know goes towards the door and sister brandom goes with him to the door say goodbye and then uh remember brother the Neville died in 74 sister Bram died in 81 and then they said Rebecca come come over here so she goes over there she she left in 2006 we'll cover that later and uh they're over there at the door I'm still by the fireplace and they said to me you keep doing what you're doing so that's why I'm here today keep doing what I'm doing so I'm not an Entertainer I'm only a faithful witness and we're trying to stay balanced I know that's a odd word to some people but uh okay you guys did a good job yeah it's balanced got to check if a Pulpit is out of balance we got to start somewhere else you know okay but that's there to keep your eyes on something that doesn't fail you must have balance now I noticed last night when we were enjoying the food over there some people were a little bit out of balance you know like three cups of coffee is too much you know but um we're here to have a good time in the Lord and um uh in our scripture it doesn't say anything about an attorney Jesus Christ is the righteous one he's our attorney it doesn't say anything about a judge because nobody qualifies it doesn't have many no matter how many years you've been traveling this road and who your ancestors are nobody's a judge um a lot of times and I know there's people right here that have the little thing in their ear they go through the airport and they're just blabbing away who are you talking to you know I'm only hearing half the conversation so if I get close I can hear half then I can pass judgment on what I hear we do that all the time we hear the neighbors arguing we can make a judgment on whatever we think we heard but um nobody qualifies for a judge only to be a witness so we trust that someone can learn today from our testimony uh I'm the only one that can tell this story you all have a testimony also we heard some of it last night and when we get on the other side and there's no clocks there's no Sunrise Sunset then I can sit down and listen to everyone your story and um so I'm the eagle that was born in the Baptist chicken yard and I learned right away that okay God's grace brought me to a fuller Revelation the word says all this also we don't have any right to throw rocks at the chicken yard there's there's other eagles over there maybe now those chickens are looking at us they look at you your family they're all out here they're watching to see how your Revelation how your religion carries you through the current crisis you know so all we got to do is live the truth we don't have to worry about all those other people and so um we must find balance in our Christian walk now in our world today there are about 7,000 known languages now some people it's 100 people some it's a thousand and they're Millions but 7,000 distinct languages okay the Bible is only in 700 languages the New Testament is in 1500 languages so people are busy still getting the translation into those languages and uh on October 6th 1536 a long time ago there was a man by the name of William tind in England and his aim was to translate the Bible into English we didn't always have this English translation okay people died that you might have this okay and so there's still people that don't have Bibles we're busy buying Bibles to put into people's hands in South America right now and so when my parents graduated from uh Bible School in 1944 uh their idea was as young Christians having been trained you know in Bible uh knowledge and so forth they wanted to go and find a tribe in the mountains of Mexico south of El Paso that had no written language only oral but see it's hard for us to believe in 2024 that there's people out there that don't have a written language we can all read and write there's people right here in this town probably that can't read but there's people out there that don't have a written language so they um uh bought a I think they bought a used Navy truck or something it's a four-wheel drive thing and and here they go two young people stuff they thought they needed and they're going to go find these people well um they uh went as far as the truck would go and then they had to park it because there's no more road so we got to get our stuff together and rent some horses and go four days camping out every night sounds like a lot of fun right now camping out to me is holiday and express not out there in the Rocks but anyway they're on the way up there and they find these people and so the first thing is to make contact with people that don't speak Spanish of course they didn't know a lot of Spanish either but um this unknown Unwritten language and you have to talk with them and get their trust and start learning words that they're saying you know wood or whatever they say wood is you got to make a dictionary it's a long process well after a while excuse me being up there uh as happens in you know the young Christians or young married life they're going to have a baby born so they come out the four days on the horse and instead of getting back in the truck and going back to Grandma's house in Arizona they got on the train and went to Mexico City and that's where their first first child was born in late August 1945 that was me so that's why I can claim Mexican citizenship because I was born there of American parents well eventually uh over the next 20 years it became obvious that I was the first of 10 children five boys and five girls okay and um so this whole idea of of getting the language into written form and then after you have a dictionary then you can proceed to Gospel of John that can take 20 years we see we we can't understand that we live in immediate times and so my dad wasn't that kind of a patient man I'm an eyewitness to that and so he decided to leave that blessing to someone else and eventually it did get done um but see these people to teach them to read their own language that that's a whole another project so what they did I found out later they they made the dictionary translated John and maybe Romans or whatever and they put it on audio they put on little records and the people they can hear that oh yeah that's our language so it all worked out well anyway so my dad left that to someone else and he moved over to the East Coast of Mexico over near the gulf and that's where he established a um a Bible school for ministers and Sunday school workers and so forth and it's still there today and so we were there when it began that's when I I think I entered the second grade over there so I had all of the uh I had I think I had the first grade in in America but all the other six grades were in Spanish everything is in Spanish all the multiplication tables all the numbers in my head are all in Spanish right bla yeah see that's my buddy she understands the language and and so um so here I was the only white kid in this school we lived about I don't know 2 or 300 miles south of Laredo Texas and I'd made some friends in school and so um we didn't they didn't have pencil sharpers we didn't I don't know if they had invented them or we didn't have one down there every kid had a single-edged razor blade yeah hidden in his book he take it out and sharpen his pencil and put it back well today they put you in jail for that you know times have changed and so one day this kid gets a a real sharp point on his pencil and when I was looking off somewhere else he jabbed me in the arm and when he saw that I had red blood like him then we could be friends so I don't know what his parents have been telling him but um I made some friends well anyway so I'm growing up on the East Coast of Mexico and being the missionary Son Well we on the front row every service no back then I don't know about up here but back then the kids didn't didn't have any answers they didn't ask us questions what would you like dear no here's your pancake here's your orange juice when you finish it you can get away from the table well it's different today and so nobody asked us would you like to go to church today get your car we're leaving and so here we are in the in the in the front row well finally by the time I'm about 9 years old I realized Jesus died for me too not just for the Mexican people but for me and so because the scriptures says all have sinned all the L kids all the everybody the Snows all the cofas all the brandom all the Smiths all have sinned and come short of the glory of God we can't make it without Jesus Christ you can't make it without the cross you know and so whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved and I remember receiving the Lord Jesus as my savior and I was baptized in the Baptist Church on Easter Sunday of 1955 a long time ago now we had the same Bible okay we we only knew part of it we didn't know the whole book and so U by the time we get to 1958 and stay awake we're going to get to the good part here in a little bit but by the time we get to 1958 I've been through all six grades of school in Spanish and of course in home my mother was teaching us you know certain English things we needed but she had some rules well you can imagine of course by then she only had about I think maybe five kids but anyway uh she was a very strict disciplinarian and uh she said now at home in the house we speak English you can speak Spanish outside the only person you speak Spanish to here is the hired help that we have and such was the rule that um if American missionary showed up you know and spoke perfect Spanish we didn't speak Spanish to him oh you're Greeno we speak English to you and even today I can get around people and they they know me because of the message and and they won't speak English to me they only speak Spanish so anyway so I celebrated my 13th birthday in Houston Texas I've been sent to America to finish the next sixth grades of course I didn't have a vote in it well they decided way you go and so all these new experiences in an American school you know nobody speaking Spanish and so I thought well you know if I take Spanish as an elective in my seventh grade that should be whiz well it wasn't quite that easy because I grew up with Spanish and so this is just the way you talk I didn't know the rules why this and why it's ridiculous and just like with the English spelling well you know we have the certain way we pronounce it and got short a and long a all this nonsense in the rules and the exceptions to the rules well what a waste of time just memorize the words it'll always be the same I mean business is not spelled like business or Arkansas or a lot of other things you know so anyway um here I am in the in American school and eventually my family moved up uh I did spend I think I spent the ninth grade with the menite people in Chihuahua and um So eventually I ended up in in Tucson Arizona where my mother was born raised living my living with my grandfather 1962 going to high school you know 10th grade and uh so then my parents moved to Tucson and you know got the home kind of established but you know um in this school now I don't know how big the schools are here but in Tucson at that time this high school was 2 200 kids it's a lot of people and so I was the one that had the reputation I'm the new kid that didn't go to the dances didn't smoke didn't drink and you know my friends were were um uh the U people from Salt Lake City you know that they have they no Bible but then when it gets tight they go to their other book you know the Mormons and so um here we are living in Tucson going to this big school and so one day uh this girl comes up to me and she says now now we know you're so picky but we know we I don't know how many we was but we know exactly the girl for you well I wasn't necessarily looking for a girl uh I was happy in the Baptist Church I was helping to lead the singing you know and and here I was a uh junior in high school and so I said well where is she well she's way over there getting on the bus and so the next day they introduced me to Rebecca Brandon well sure enough most beautiful girl I'd ever seen and she had that southern Indiana accent that kind of set her apart so people like to hear her talk you know because nobody in Tucson talk like that and um and so here we both meet and we're both 17 you know Rebecca meet George and so she said now you have to meet my dad my dad's preacher well they didn't scare me because we'd had a lot of preachers come through our house and then the interesting thing is God moved these people from Indiana um you know over 2,000 kilometers to Tucson and just a block from my house wow how convenient that was and so I go to meet her dad and I'd never n I'd never heard this name before okay we're in the Baptist Church we don't care about the Pentecostals and all those people we we knew what was what we knew and so I go to meet her dad and here's a man in the backyard with no shirt on you know cutting the plants or something and and she introduces me and then she disappears here I'm with her dad and remember I'm not scared I never heard of him before all I knew this got this is the next step you got to take to get closer to the girl and so we talked a little while and but see I was there for a purpose I had a a mission I wanted to know her better but I had to come through him and so we talked for a little while and he gave me permission yeah that's simple well see what I found out later he was scanning the hard drive you know all the way maybe till today and so um being a prophet he could do that I had permission he had the problem because there were some other guys that was kind of waiting there a little opportunity and they knew who he was and they were scared to death well they lost out and so um at the time I was driving a a four-year-old Ford pickup let see back then we didn't have dual cab we didn't have air condition have nothing you know had three speeds and um and so but it was clean you know it wasn't ugly and but her brother she had a big brother that had a brand new red Chevrolet and I thought M this might be a problem older brother but he was a skinny kid like me so didn't matter and uh but her dad drove a Ford so we got along just fine well when they moved from Indiana to Arizona uh it was by Vision you've all heard you know the story and so um they didn't know how long they were going to be they moved because they were going to tear up the driveway and he shouldn't be there well anyway at that point Rebecca had been in classical piano training piano teacher down the road little days uh I think almost 10 years when all of a sudden you take a a girl out of you know mid uh junior year 11th grade cross country there's no piano there's no friends there's no church no trees no nothing well she can be a little of it you know scatterbrain and um so and they don't know how long they're going to be there they live in a duplex apartment and um so one day brother Randon is getting his kids together to go to supper before I ever met him and um he looks in the back of the station wagon there's only two kids where's where's Rebecca oh she's at the corner you know Sister ma said and we'll pick up her on the way so he goes to the corner stops and goes in well as he approaches the house he hears the piano yeah there's two girls there's 20 fingers on one piano and they're playing and it's not down at the cross or Jesus loves me or anything like that it's uh it's not it's not Beethoven or braam or anything it's just rock and roll you know 17-year-old kids and so boy his heart stretched to break he bangs on the door and so she comes to the door now he was a balanced man he wasn't didn't jerk his Bell off what are you doing no all he said it's time to go so we go and she said I never heard another word about that for two months you know well when he tells the story about that experience it's uh in one of the questions answers of uh August of 64 it sounds like she's really headed to the world you know this is just playing the piano at the neighbor's house but he said and then she met George and he's a Christian in the problem how's that because I was taken to the Baptist church every Sunday and he was very happy he even went with us a few times and uh so you're wondering well why didn't you just drop it all God has a way of doing things why are you here today why didn't you move to California wherever Europe you're here God has a way of doing things and so um so I got to know him a little better of course this was in early 63 maybe I don't know if it was February or March somewhere in there but then when he's preaching in in Tucson in early June first meeting I went to uh now I'm seeing the man of God you know in the pulpit and the gift and all the wow this is right there in the Bible and um so I'm I'm going home that night and I said now Lord this is this is serious it's either something that came straight from you or it's the biggest hoax that ever hit the earth you know there's nowhere to put a a pen in it it's real and so God began to reveal me you know reveal to me this is the the truth now brother R traveled a lot but when he was home you know in Tucson I could visit we could spend time together we could discuss scripture whatever and he was a real friend uh he he enjoyed talking about the scripture and I was always welcome you know and so people ask me well what attracted you to this ministry well the bait on the hook was the girl that was obvious but um but then with William brandom that was different that was that was you know two different tracks and um and what always impressed me right from the first met time I met him uh I knew a lot of people that had studied the Bible they had read the Bible and but here's a man that's actually living the spirit of the scripture it's like he tells the story about U um about uh Daniel Boone or about Tarzan or something where you read that stuff they want to live in the tree you want to be like that well he was he was exhibiting the spirit of the scripture you know just that simple and so I'd already read my Bible through I think twice by that time but I hadn't seen anybody that could actually live it like he was living it and that's what attracted me and that that was what what led me to it I wasn't in the in the Pew watching The Miracles no I was I was watching the life of a man that was preaching the word and so we were taught to read the Bible and memorize and so forth but he was actually living it so that's what attracted my attention and of course the supernatural that was just better yet but um even you know my mother had taught us you read your Bible and you pray every day well here's William brandom you want to get closer to God you read your Bible and pray it's it's best formula so anyway as uh just maybe a little glimpse into what I call the prophetic Dimension um the life that he lived how you you hear it on tape but what's behind that what how did how did we get to that point well you know prophets speak from eternity everything is present tense brother Brandon could say now the other day what if we say the other day that might have been Wednesday or Tuesday but to him it could be 5 years ago you know um and then when he when he is addressing the crowd well he's not just seeing 50 people he might see 400 you know um because he's living in in two dimensions and the other dimension is faster than this one and we have the scripture where Elisha and his helper were in the house and and they were under siege you know and and so Elisha says the young man go out and see what's going on so he goes out there and all he can see is soldiers and swords and horses oh he comes back shaking and tells Elisha what he saw now Elisha didn't smack him and you know get upset he just put his hand on the Lord open the young man's eyes now go check again well there's all these angels on the hillsides wow a whole lot more than there were soldiers well that's the prophetic Dimension okay so brother brandham is um scheduled for these meetings in Houston Texas in January of 1950 and um it was a different Houston than it is today there's still some godly people there and so while he's in this 10-day campaign there was a Baptist minister that thought it was his job to prove that this is all wrong just a bunch of psychology you know and so it even got into the newspapers and so then um brother Bosworth was helping brother brandom at the time in the meetings and he said now brother brandom this is getting pretty serious out here we got to do something we got to answer these questions brother B said no we're not going to waste one night on one man when there's hundreds need to be prayed for So eventually brother Bosworth convinced him that he could do it calmly but it's going to get hurt and um so word got out that there's going to be a debate well now instead of a Auditorium for 6,000 he says they went into the auditorium of 30,000 but if you check the internet that new building only held 9,000 people so he's seeing a whole lot more than what we think you know and so they're in this new building and and so brother Ram said well I'm not going to church tonight you guys handle it I'll come tomorrow night and so they scheduled up for a certain night and so um but the holy spirit said no you need to go to church you need to be there so it's him and his wife and four-year-old Rebecca little bitty thing and um and then brother R's brother so the four of them and so they go and they way up in the balcony where you can see down here and so he um he's up there and he's watching the go on down there and so brother Bosworth says to the Baptist Minister well to begin with one question we have seven compound names of Jehovah you know Redemption can we bring those from the Old Testament to the New Testament yes or no can we apply those to Jesus Christ well the Baptist Minister had to think a minut it because now he's getting fixed to get hung because if he says no then there's no salvation and if he says yes then it includes Divine Healing and that was the big deal still to this day that Divine Healing is not in the atonement well so they had a bit of a debate and you can hear most of this on tape but um um when it's over it kind of come to an end brother Bosworth says now I believe brother brandom's in the audience well yeah I mean it's it's difficult to pick somebody out right here with 50 people but if you have N9 or 10 or 30,000 let's see where is he you know and brother brand said he came in in Disguise not don't what he did to disguise himself but he came in nobody knew he was there there okay so he's way up there in the balcony he's right on the edge and for the first time four-year-old Rebecca is sitting on his lap wow because all the other services that she's in he's up here and she sees all the other little girls sitting on their Daddy's lap so this is a very proud moment for her she remembered it very well four years old and so he um he starts to get up you know to come down and his brother sitting there and said don't you dare get up well I have a riot here and and his wife intervene she don't worry he knows what he's doing so he puts Rebecca in his seat and he comes walking down and he said there were so many sick people there there was there was cases that would make the heart of an Iron Man melt pretty stiff you know and so he comes down comes to the pulpit and he speaks a few words and he said I don't need to speak anymore because he's here now the Baptist had um had hired these two professional uh photographers take pictures because he was going to win and these pictures would show that he was right and all that and so they in fact I even spoke to one of them I met him years years later and uh they um they were taking pictures you know they fancy equipment but when they went to develop them only one picture turned out and it's this one here some of you might not have seen this but this is a very real photograph we have people today saying is fake well that's their opinion we know it's real and um and so this is the only picture that came out you know and then later we find out where brother R says uh it's better if you have the picture than the real thing com in the room because your eyes good you know good fool yet and then in another place we find out where he uh he's I think in at least two occasions he's talking about a a sister that was in the hospital um very very sick now ready to die and she had this picture in the on in a frame beside her bed in the hospital and she her testimony was that the fire came off of the picture and came over her and she got healed and went home so he says it's better to have the real one than than if you know the picture the real one that came in the room well anyway God knows what he's doing God has ways of of doing things he doesn't need our little brain you know Psalm 46:10 be still I'm God got all figured out don't need your opinion you know well years later when Rebecca you know was listening to the tape the way we would today she um she heard brother R tell about the fact that when he was coming down he said 500 ushers made a way for me to get down here well the only person she knew that was in the meeting was her mother so she said mom you know you were there did you see the the 500 ushers and no dear those were Angels see that's other dimension that we can't see otherwise that got him right to the you know at the first row back there but God knew what he was doing you know and there's many other uh instances of what we call a prophetic Dimension which is the word I use you don't have to use it but uh for example whenever his mother-in-law died in 1960 um he um you know went through the the funeral and bual now they're at the house and uh sister ROM's crying and and him trying to be a good husband and everything well dear what's wrong well Bill you don't understand she's so far away you know and he said now look I can't open your eyes but you'll have to believe me she's right there on the end of the couch they're only as far away as you put them you see now we don't believe in spiritualism like the people that built this church but we do believe in a Hereafter they're waiting for us well time goes on and um we'll be another hour or so lunch is right there we don't have to go far we got free parking out here so come to the end of 1963 and the brandom are going back to Indiana for Christmas and he's going to speak at the Tabernacle well you guys remember maybe you don't but I do when when your girlfriend leaves for two weeks it's like a year you know just and so I hitch a ride with some other people and drove straight through and surprised them for Sunday December 29th and so I'm there at the church and sitting right over here to the right of the the the pulpit and brother B's preaching oh man here we are in the brand Tabernacle and all this is going on marvelous you know so between Services well I I go to lunch with with the brandom's and so we're um we're sitting at lunch now he knew that we were in school together he knew that we were in choir together at the school and music and so forth but he said now George I want you to sing tonight in church said me at the ROM Tabernacle yeah what what in the world would I sing here and um he said well tonight we're going to have a u a healing service so it'd be good if you could sing then Jesus came well uh I never heard that song yeah Baptist Church Shame Shame and um so we learned it well so he came out to preach and he he thank for the song and he was very proud that Rebecca had played in church for the first time see her her training was classical music and so here she played and he was very proud of that well he came out and preached to look away to Jesus well we moved forward to 64 and um we graduated together from High School if you were going with somebody that could be your partner otherwise they'll put you according to size you know but um so our parents were for sitting in the audience they they were very pleased and it was a very proud day for brother random he said finally brandom has graduated you know and there's not been another one since you know or the other two well uh that's May of 64 then in July brother Brandon was preaching in in Philadelphia at the uh big celebration they had for the 4th of July and when a person would ride to church with brother brandham uh it would be brother brand and Billy Paul in the front and then Rebecca and her friend Betty were in the back and they wouldn't be there for the whole service they'd come in in time for him to come in to speak and so they got there and the place full there's no seats anywhere you know so they don't know where to put these two girls well they found them some seats up the mezzan where they could you know see and hear and um so they're sitting up there well brother random comes in and it was a long table and his his seat let's say was over here you know right next to the pulpit and brother Roberts is speaking and so while brother Roberts is speaking brother Brandon reaches out and touches his coat you know down at the down at the bottom of the of the coat just real real easy and um and he looked down and he he didn't even match he had the brown coat with a blue jacket or what blue pants and here's this man in a probably a$1 th suit at the time and so he preached the mighty message you know that that day the Mighty God unveiled and then when they're leaving the service Rebecca said I saw what you did you know feeling the coat and he said oh sis you wouldn't believe it was such fine fine cloth you know I looked down I didn't even match well his outfit probably cost $49.95 you know but and the other man's got a ,000 suit on but they were both called of God they both had a different job to do and um but but that was just to show the difference you know and then another time uh I think it's on tape where brother brandom uh is speaking in a large Auditorium they got the big curtain behind him and he said now I want to show you here at the end of the service the reason for the success of these meetings and he had him raised a curtain and there on the floor was old John Ryan with a white beard all stretched out praying he says that's the reason of success because brother REM didn't have a push button Ministry it all depended on prayer okay so we got to tell you a little bit about the courtship I mean this is you know long time ago um and just like you guys don't want to tell all secrets of your courtship either do you might tell barries but not yours so we couldn't have any dates during the week because we're in school and uh when I did bring her home I had to be you know be 11 o'clock and then we had church on Sunday and so forth and so I would bring her home and they Liv in duplex apartment right on the street there was no gated community or anything and so we U were standing on the porch and trying to say good night and everything all of a sudden the light comes on big porch light right here and so what in the world so a little hand comes out if I put a quarter in the hand hand goes back in the light goes off it's pretty simple formula yeah that was my young brother-in-law's earliest adventur separating Believers from their cash you know and uh so at our house we had a a black phone on the wall with a dial and my dad of course raising all these kids he said now the telephone is for uh is for uh communication not for visiting well that makes sense unless he needed to visit and it was different you know he always said we have a democracy here I have the vote that's what he rant things um but at the brandom house by the time they're hooking up their phone in ' 63 we had the push button phone but it's still connected to the wall they didn't have you know walkway phones and you know we we like we heard last night these weren't invented yet this is the most marvelous thing ever there's more power here than in the what they sent to the Moon Moon you know but nevertheless and we were young we like to talk on the phone we only lived a block away but still it's just something about it well so brother R has this phone every you know different people got the number and they been calling for everything you know brother R should I buy the white car or the red now if they ask me I don't care but they didn't ask me and so he talks to him well he got tired of that so he's looking at the phone one day well on the bottom of the phone on the back side there was a dial and if you dialed it one way the ringer was louder and if you dialed the other way it was off what do you think you did turned it off enough of that nonsense so you calling him you call in the house and you could hear it ringing but he can't hear it ringing off and so Rebecca is oh what are you going to do said it looks real simple remember we're like uh 17 18 at the time and I said look you you set your your uh watch just like mine okay okay got it now at 7:00 Lord willing I'm going to call you but thanks to your dad it's not going to ring so at 7:00 you pick it up I was there and so I had a long cord to the wall so she could take that phone and go in the closet and shut the door and we had some privacy so you see love conquers all and um so here I am with this four or 5-year-old truck uh no air conditioning no nothing well you've been there owna some of you and 100° in the summertime so sometimes he would offer us his Cadillac wow that was like a big Mercedes today and so why did he have a Cadillac he never wanted a Cadillac the Christian businessman offered him yeah we going to buy you a new Cadillac every year just like we do so and so no not me he he normally drove a Ford station wagon and he'd drive it for two years and then he would trade it in for a new one because of high mileage well so out in California there was a man named arganbright he was the treasur of the Christian businessmen and without asking brother random he was getting his new Cadillac uh at the end of 55 getting his new 56 Cadillac so he gives the keys to the 55 Cadillac to these two flunkies now look guys drive this to this address you park it don't talk to anybody come home so they did well brother Ren comes home one day here's this huge CAD like from here to the wall it's beautiful I mean it's a big four-door Fleetwood with two four barrel carburetors and it was huge and had a great air conditioning so he put it in the garage you know real quick and then eventually he put a little ad in the paper and said now look I'm going to be driving this car you're going to see me drivve in this car I didn't buy it with your money this was a gift you know on and on and it was great for traveling so he had offered this Cadillac to us so we could go out well back then uh some of you remember the gas that I would buy for my truck was 22 cents a gallon that's like what 5 cents a liter anyway but for the Cadillac had to buy the expensive gas was 36 Cents a gallon and there was no self- pump you had to pull in the guy comes out and um so we' to get $2 worth Big Spenders and um so anyway we were attending the Baptist Church and uh in my truck well I'd come by to get her so I'm driving and here's Rebecca and there's my sister who's 2 years younger than me and the other four or five kids are in the back no top just you know going to church and so brother R would come out to see us sometimes he always tell us goodbye if he was home sometimes you go with us and one time he comes out and he he you know sees us and my what a fine load of young preachers you have here I didn't see no young preachers I saw young brat Brothers you know but uh he could see farther than I could see well sure enough they all became good baptist ministers until this day and so uh uh life rocks on here we are in ' 64 and U Rebecca told us one time about they were in a restaurant and there was a policeman uh you know at the other table and as soon as his food came well his radio started making noise and he had to go and he left the food and goes out buzzes away with a light flashing brother Brand's still eating everybody else kind of nervous and so brother brand said now um don't worry little boy fell out of a tree here a few blocks away and he's going to be okay and Rebecca said now we knew that everybody's daddy didn't do that so they had interesting life and um then towards the end of 64 the Lord spoke to him said look you need to find a house because you're going to stay so up to then you know most all 63 and 64 they'd been in this apartment and uh not knowing what the future held kids in school and so forth he's traveling preaching and so he starts looking for a house and he felt you know the holy spirit's directed him to this kisac you know one way in one way in one way out and there's these three houses up there that this old man had built and almost finished him but he thought well we'll let the owners finish it the way they want it and so brother brand was very much attracted to one of the houses he could see the mountains very clearly he liked and there was room on the property to add on the den room that he always dreamed about to have his trophies you know because he was a hunter okay so they made the deal well so brother Brandon was standing in in the doorway looking out and the Builder standing outside they're talking and while they're talking uh here's little Joseph about what eight or nine years old at the time and you know how kids run their hand up the door jam always sticking fingers where they don't belong and so he's headed for the the door jam you know the hole so brother brand was talking to this man and without even flinching or anything he reaches in his pocket and gets his knife and opens it up and sticks it in the hole brings out a scorpion and Joseph was headed towards that so see those kind of things okay something's different here this isn't the ordinary guy and um so they made the de and then all of 65 they're adding on the den room they're bringing the animals from from Indiana to put on the wall and finishing the house the carpet I even helped them with some of the furniture and things and um so that was most of 65 well um in May of 65 okay I've been out of school for a year and I didn't have the right baptism didn't have the Holy Ghost uh didn't have a job didn't have money didn't have a car didn't have a house mean that was just the next bum on the street really but I I knew he was a Prophet by then and I thought I needed a wife you know hey wait till you have a few things to offer you know so so I go and and uh made an appointment okay he's not busy I go in and talk to him and so uh the two of us sitting there and um uh he he commences to tell me about all these trips I don't know what all kinds of details and finally after a long what seemed like a long time I said now brother Ram I'm here for a purpose you know I have something on my mind of course he's looking right through me you know and I said well you must noticed how I really uh in love with your daughter and I'm here to ask for your permission and your blessing to marry Rebecca well everything changed then eyes got real narrow and um he uh he said well I tell you what course he knew my condition he said I'll give you guys permission to be engaged but don't even think about marriage until you both receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes sir now a smart person okay what's step number one you know no life goes on and so here again that's in May so in the summer they go off for two months I don't know how I got back there but I was back there for about 3 weeks and that was when he was preaching and only ones at the end time and I was sitting from here about far closer than the piano listen to that message it was going right over you know few people were listening to the details of what he was preaching and um several other very important messages well so he preached on August the 1st of 65 and he he addressed baptism like normally so that night I said hey now I know we're going to be getting in the station wagon and going west this week will there be time before we go that you can baptize me correctly you know Christian baptism oh sure sure well he had been waiting you know over two years for that and so on Monday August 2nd we uh went down to the church and he baptized me and turned out that was the last person he baptized which didn't know at the time and um so then you know my life started changing so now we're back in Tucson in uh August of 65 and okay now I had the girl under contract I had the B ISM I had a car things are looking better you know and so we're driving around in my car and uh all of a sudden he says now George if you ever get the opportunity to go to Israel your Bible will be a new book well thank you I wasn't thinking about Israel I thinking about the girl got to be honest and um so sure enough you know prophets could see way in the future uh this last June just a year ago was our last last trip that we made might go again we don't know but that was trip number 48 and brother Gerald and sister Betty were on one of our trips and it's a life-changing experience I mean it's a very small country very small it's not like Canada um see when when God divided up the land Isaac had 12 sons and Israel had 12 sons so he divided up the land and Israel's people got a few more square miles than Isaac's people and they've been fighting ever since and so because of the wars and the politics Israel is now living on 177% of the original land and who knows what's going to happen in the future but it's my understanding from scripture that Israel will end up all by itself with no friends and it's headed that way so anyway that was about about August in September brother R speaking in Phoenix and he's a big hotel and so Rebecca and I drive up there I let her out at the door and I go park the car well she walks into this this big uh hotel where this meeting is and her friend Sharon is back there waiting for her and so you know when girl gets engaged seems like the hand is always up here someplace you know they see the ring and so Sharon Cesar from a long ways off and she says is this about George that Baptist guy yeah but she he says she said Rebecca he he's he's a Baptist and Rebecca said yeah have a daddy likes him and a problem so later in September um brother B's finishing up the house and brother green out in Texas uh his mother was a seamstress and brother Perry had collected some money privately to put the drapes in the house so he was in town and in Tucson hanging the drapes he had a couple Services there and so brother uh brandham says to him now look brother Perry it looks like this kid's going to be my son-in-law take him home pray for the Holy Ghost now why didn't brother BR just put his hand on me and be done no it didn't work that way so I go home with him and um back to Texas now when you think you have bad weather Texas is the worst it's always humid you're always you know drenched so I go over there and visit with him about the second day I'm there brother Blair from Louisiana came over to use brother Green's phone to call brother brandom and when he called he was already out of the house but they put him on the list soon as he comes back he'll call you so here's these two brothers waiting for the phone call you know I'm over in my room reading my Bible I think and so I uh I just felt inspired hey they're both over there doing nothing why don't we just have prayer so we KNE at a bench in the Sunday School room I think it was and so we're praying and they knew who I was why I was there I didn't know I was there seeking the Holy Ghost they knew that but I didn't know that and so while we're praying it um it seemed like I could see with my eyes clothes you know a cloudy sky high clouds Sun peeking in like pencil you know certain areas and uh and that's what I remember well then the phone rang so it was brother Brandon calling for brother Blair but it was brother Green's phone so he goes to answer the phone and uh but brother brand says but I want to talk to George first okay so I go and greet him he says I want to be the first to congratulate you on receiving the baptism of Holy Ghost so he knew how hardheaded I was and he knew what was going on even though he's thousand miles away and he was identifying this experience and sure enough from then on it just got bigger and bigger well the next day I get a a letter call from my mother also in Arizona and uh I had received a letter from the President Johnson that they needed me in the military because of the war and so forth well I had Mexican citizenship I could have took off to Mexico and forget the whole thing no you give Caesar what Caesars and um So within a week I was a US Soldier with baptism of Holy Ghost and God protected me during those two years in the service well come to November of 65 and um brother B's preaching in shreport which was only an hour and a half from where I was in the Army so Rebecca came down I got a pass able to go up there for for a couple of days and so on Saturday morning I had a uh few minutes with brother brandom and I said you know I don't know what they're going to do with me I just finished basic training I don't know what what's going to happen because there was some things very serious serious things going on in the world and he said George don't worry footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord didn't pray didn't say I see a vision no nothing just quote of scripture so um that same day Saturday nights when he preached I've heard but now I see well um I was home for Christmas holidays in ' 65 they let us go from the Army and I'm home with my family and the plan was randoms were going to go to Jeffersonville he was going to preach Christmas and then come back he had to collect his new car because he ordered the 1966 station wagon and then come back and move into the new house so they're going to leave Rebecca in town to move the stuff from the apartment where they've been for almost three years now over to the new house and get it all ready so when they came back they can move right in well now when brother r traveled he had some very um uh fast rules you know one of them was that we got to leave early so at 6:00 we're leaving we're rolling you all go to sleep it's fine but we're going to get there so that mean he's leaving very early and the other thing was that if he traveled by himself or with Billy they just wear blue jeans and some boots and whatever but if he was with the family he'd dress up a little bit you know and the third thing was that that he always uh placed the Bible as the last thing in the suitcase that way nothing's on top of the Bible which makes good sense and on tape he says you don't put anything on top of your Bible not even my books which he had very few books at the time and so he had that respect and that that way he way he functioned well I was young but I wasn't you know quite crazy so I wasn't going to go up there at 5: in the morning so I went up the night of the 17th of December to say goodbye and you know uh say goodbye to him and so we're in the bedroom by ourselves and on the chair by the by the door is his boots and blue jeans and things for the next day and I knew what his rules were and I said what's this all about he said well guy never knows when he might have car trouble I thought to myself hm this guy never has car trouble he kept it you know pristine um he didn't say nothing about him but by the time Saturday night came along cuz that was 17th was Friday night by the time Saturday evening came around he was already in a head-on collision which is a whole another story but we were able to go up there on Sunday to Texas where he was and um very serious they had his all bandaged had a tra in him he couldn't talk and during the six days that he was in the hospital like I say no cell phones the only phones on the wall how many quarters you have and brother Perry was taking care of the phone calls but um during those 6 days I got into to see him once and there was 12 beds in the ICU and during those six days all the other 11 beds got better and moved on but on the night of the 24th of December God said that's enough took him home we weren't ready for that we didn't expect that and at first we were like the disciples you know desponded now what are we going to do there's no leader nobody fill his shoes and you know all this stuff going on but you know brother R says you're going to find out one of these days that when you go to heaven you don't fly off somewhere else you're still right here just in another dimension faster than this so it's only as far away as you want to imagine you know well so now we got all this confusion going on trying to settle it down trying to get back level and we traveled to Jeffersonville on on some U hired planes I couldn't stay for the funeral I wasn't a blood relative I had to get back to the Army but I had a funeral service on the 29th of December of 65 and um but sister brandham had suffered greatly in the in the accident she no doubt was was dead but she was back but she had a concussion Billy was very young he couldn't make any decisions so the can't decide where to bury him whether here in jonville or out here where our new life is in Tucson so the funeral director said don't worry I got a place I can keep him when you decide you let me know well life goes on I'm I'm out of the picture I'm I'm in the Army you know in fact they're training me to be a cook yeah for minimum 100 people we know the word says in second Timothy for God is not given us a spirit of fear but of power and love and a sound mind and Paul wrote over in Philippians and the peace of God which passes all the things you can understand will keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus the whole thing comes down to Jesus Christ you know so we're learning to listen we're learning to uh read for ourselves learning to pray and we became I think generally we became anchored in the word uh the prophetic word and the written word uh you see the message that we Proclaim is only the implified version of scripture it fits here perfectly we don't have to say yeah but brother BR said no it's all part of it it's all one big book you know and uh God was on the scene with God there's no surprises I'm away you know all this is going on back east and the missionary work started to begin spreading the message it's not like the people that come to your house door you know two by two and try to sell you stuff no they people saw the the changed lives they saw the change lives of Gerald and all these other people hey I want what you have you know so uh small group started to form well when we get to March of 66 um I had my training finished and I already had papers I knew where I was going and so I called Rebecca one day and I said um let's get married next week next Wednesday okay let's do it well so I go back Tucson we have a private ceremony to house with families my mother couldn't be there for the the wedding of her firstborn because she was in false labor with number 10 I'm not a woman but you'd think after you'd know but anyway um so we had a private ceremony then we uh traveled back to jonville for the burial which is going to be on April 15th or April 11th rather so that was our honeymoon and so we uh we get back there and and come uh Monday April 11th and I have the you know organize the burial service well in Indiana it can rain just gently for two or three days at a time you know well this is one of those occasions just rainy and um so Billy Paul had always stayed close to his grandmother which was Hope's mother and she was a very very difficult person very hard never been to church he never saw her cry never saw any emotion but he left his two little boys with Grandma while he went to the burial okay Monday morning and when he comes back from the burial uh for the first time he sees his grandmother wiping her eyes and um she said you know even the heavens weep for that man after all those years well we left that afternoon flew to California and on the 15th of April I got on plane with a bunch of other guys like me and went to Vietnam for one year and so back then we didn't have didn't have phones didn't have FaceTime all we had was letters no vacation one year that's it but God was keeping us you know she was busy taking care of her mother and and brother and sister I was busy cooking for 500 people you know over there and um but it was a trial by fire but God Spirit kept us you know so after two years in the military I began working with the translation of the message into Spanish now the first translation we did was a small track uh he ascended on high and give gifts unto men small track a lady had produced and she asked if I would do it in Spanish well I did that when I was still in high school brother Bram saw it he was he was you know pleased with it so when I get out of the military uh they had a spot for me at spoken word Publications to Simply set type and so I can see something's wrong with this translation that somebody did and so I go back to the table sure enough some things were left out so it would start all over again so all these years we've been involved in getting brother brandham into this other language where people can imagine that he's speaking Spanish see we read our Bible and we you know we get in there and we imagine that Peter speaking English well he didn't speak English you know so and and all these words of Jesus and read well that's good there might have been some more this is what what came down so we're trying to Simply put William brandham in another language where they can have the same blessing we have you know that's been our priority well today uh it's much different we've got all translated and I'm working very closely with brother Barry in getting it printed in China get it distributed all over Latin America and that's that's kind of the current situation but if we fast forward 40 years now uh we get to October of of' 06 and by this time Rebecca was very very ill she had had um a kidney removed along with the tumor which the whole thing was about the size of a football now there was much prayer people everywhere was praying there was much faith and this wasn't just anybody this somebody that lived with William Brandon for 19 years she knew what Miracles were she knew what faith was better than I did and um but I can see here you know going down every day and I said now look God can certainly raise you up the next 20 minutes you can be brand new you've seen it happen but if God chooses to take you home then you find your dad and you wait for me there okay well um so I've got a very serious appointment a few days later in October of 06 uh a friend of ours back in uh Virginia a young lady she called and she said you know you know uh I was getting up from lunch today and right across the table was this Vision he say it's only happened twice in my life and here there was this Vision here's all these people and brother Brandon preaching Faith to him and here's a prayer line and all this is going on and then he says and all of a sudden he raised his hand and you little sister thank you for praying for my daughter Rebecca and tell George everything's going to be okay well when you hear your name from the other dimension you tend to pay attention you know and so I okay it's going to be okay maybe not the way I want it but Hebrews 13:8 is still in effect so November the 28th of ' 06 uh the Lord took her home and uh after the funeral I remember praying I said Lord keep me keep me busy and keep me balanced and keep me focused so the focus is beyond the curtain of time it's just ahead you know we're keep staying very busy we've been all over the world uh just like this trying to increase encourage the bride now we have other we have a whole Bible full of messages we don't just give the testimony but balance is very essential even in your life whether you're young or old in your food and everything you do I mean these nice cars they got to be balanced they don't work right you know so uh you know for every one of us there's a there's a line in the road you won't go past that line you can eat all the broccoli you want you're not going past the line we don't know where the line is but God knows and if you check the obituaries they didn't all die at 90 years old you know so only God knows and um we were married just over 40 years we had three children two boys and a girl we have now three grandchildren now I finally got a granddaughter yeah because she married in so like it or not I'm related to Pastor John because it's his niece and it's my granddaughter so um uh a lot of times when I'm in churches and there's time they uh they want to ask questions well I was in a church in Congo not too long ago and there's about 5,000 people I'm the only white person you know so got speak in English translators speak in lingala and so as soon as I finished well the pastor jumps up and he said now um we don't know when brother George is coming back has anybody got a question yeah I got got a lot of questions well they ask the question in one language he translates it and then here's the answer and so it takes time but all they have is time they're not like us here's here's a church of 5,000 people or more you look outside and there's maybe 10 cars and there's um there's probably 200 motorcycles cheap ones and about 500 bicycles everybody else walked so time means nothing and so the only question I remember uh the one sister sent up a question she said now since the Lord took your wife why you still wearing the ring I thought man these people notice everything you know you and uh I said well because my commitment to Rebecca wasn't until death to you part but it's forever oh okay now we understand so that's why we're at the Ring of course it has a secondary uh purpose that I can't share with everybody but that's to scare away desperate women because there's some out there so God's keeping us very busy and uh with the translation work but it's kind of it's all done now we just got to get it printed and get in their hands but the missionary work is evolved more now to humanitarian work because we got people in like right now in Brazil there's flooding rain rain rain it's up to the second story in some places okay I know of 300 families they had to flee and they lost everything Believers and who knows how many others so got to help them and then there's also the the people in Honduras that are some are very busy in missionary work uh we got one brother that he's Fearless he hears from people way up on the mountain someplace so they get in a boat it's not a boat like your thinking it's a Dugout canoe it's a log that's been hollowed out it's 30 ft long and about so wide and they'll go down the river with a motor on the back for eight hours and then get on a horse go eight hours up into the mountains and finally get there people anxious to hear the word there's baptism and that goes on every week uh there's people in in um in Malawi central Africa that are very uh good at missionary work they have these two motorcycles you know they're like 200s or whatever they are they're cheap two guys get on and they go into the mountain regions and preach the gospel to these people they have baptisms that's going on all the time and we're we're helping them with that and so things are happening so when somebody tells you that there's no more blood on the mercy SE they're lying because God is still calling God is still calling these people they're baptized they're coming in still it's still going on in Venezuela where it's so poor um it's poor for the for the people I know because see what communism does it erases the middle class you have the rich people they just get better you know because the drugs and so forth and the poor people there's a lot of them but there's no middle class so the poor people that we know they can't afford because groceries are up a th% you know and it's going to be a different price next week so we're trying to help them with groceries it's like maybe uh six or between six and 10 families with groceries have a roof over their head and um so there's these people that are being baptized they don't have any clothes they they're say shorts or whatever they have that's that's all they have so we send them we send them clothes we have people that are making clothes and donating clothes in America we sent it down there we got a safe way to get stuff and they're happy oh wow another box it's like Christmas you know and so a lot of things like that are going on that we're helping with but my humble advice to you today you guys that are married make her happy that's all you got do make her laugh if she's only laughing at your crazy jokes it's okay make her happy and you know a lot of times we talk about um the idea of marriage is 50/50 even in Spanish we have the idea of the other half of the orange you found her but you see it's much more than that because if you if you figure marriage is 50/50 then when you put your head on the pillow at night you're going to wonder did I win did she win you know CU it's it's always competition right John yeah and and so the idea is 8020 you give 80% just sacrifice but she's doing the same thing and then you meet everything's fine so you got to be honest with your with your mate and uh you know people are watching us all the time even over here on this island people are watching oh those Believers over there got a bargain on the Catholic Church they're watching you yeah they're watching and um to see how we cope and dark Le OFA and but the thing is what do they see in you see when brother Brandon was here there were people I knew him personally they basically worshiped him they baptized in his name they had candles you know it looked crazy I knew they were wrong I had enough Bible from the Baptist Church enough holy ghost that I knew they were wrong but we got the same thing today there's there's worshippers there's people that are not balanced you know and so uh instead of Downing them what has people seen in me have they seen an angel in me have they seen Jesus Christ today uh John 13:35 by this shall all people know that you're my followers how do those people out there know that you're followers of Jesus Christ because you dress better because your car is better no the love you have one to the other they're watching and that's the way they're going to know okay okay so um yeah we're very involved in missionary work in we're printing in Mexico printing in South America printing in China even in the US and providing you know humanitarian Aid to these people but see the the gospel has reached the highest level of the drug world now I know there's people right here in this island that would give anything for those drugs right you probably know some of them excuse me and that's the reason that those guys are in business because there's people up here demanding they got to have it so the um um we had we don't have now but we had a radio broadcast where there would be some songs and they put on a portion of brother R's tape and it was English Spanish English Spanish a lot of people benefited and so one of the uh people that heard the broadcast at one point was a man that you probably heard of his name is Cho I mean short he was top drug dealer drug mover millions and billions of dollars he heard the broadcast and then it kind of struck him and he told his people how get in contact with them see what this is all about and U so they sent him a a life story book you know I had the drawing on the front and he read it hey I like this said tell them we need 10,000 well we don't have 10,000 so we sent him a memory stick here you print it with your money because they got all kinds of money so they printed that he's got when he was still free we'll get to that a minute but when he was in business he had 10,000 people in his army with good guns so he spread those out to all them he printed Church A's books he printed all kinds of things for his people um eventually he says yep I believe the only difference is he hasn't been baptized now he went through a big trial which uh the US government played all kinds of money now they he locked up in a maximum security out in Colorado and maybe someday they'll call let us end to baptize him but all kinds of those people have heard and they believe so we're just trying to Shine the Light let them know there's a reality you we're not worshiping William Brandon we're worshiping Jesus Christ the Lamb of God but this is the restoration Prophet that brought us back to the truth okay so the same brother I told you about earlier had another dream one time and um he um he was he said he was in heaven he was there he can see some things and he's talking to brother brandom and I said no wait a minute he doesn't speak Spanish and you don't speak English yeah but we could understand each other okay so they're talking and um a whole bunch of details but um he said now now brother BR down there where I live there's a bunch of people say You must come back and do these things you got a big list of things you got to do when you come back he said look I have said everything I've had to say that part's finished but if I was to come back the way they h desire I would have to take a few people to the Woodshed and you know what that means I mean we're going to go out there I'm going to beat the fire out of you and when you finish crying you can come back in you know well so they're talking and then he uh he noticed this young girl standing there next to brother brm kind of hanging onto his arm he looked at her oh that's young Rebecca and so uh he looked at her and she gave it the big smile and she says you tell George I'm right where he told me to wait so it is going to happen and we want to stay balanced you know how we stay balanced read one page of your church age book every day you read one chapter out of your Bible you listen to the prophet for 30 minutes and you pray you do those four things starting today you'll be better balanced in your life the church all run smoother and brother John can preach more freely agreed may God bless you I liked how he started out he said we are not qualified to judge only qualified to witness so often we only have half the story maybe not even half the story you know but if we can say tell what we saw when we were walking in he was talking about you know how Philip went to Nathaniel And he said we found this guy and Nathaniel says well how am I going to you know why he said come and see come and see for yourself and if you're not convinced then you can walk away but you come and see and see if he doesn't mean the same thing to you that he means to the rest of us and then he said God has a way of doing things not obvious not our way not our time but God has a way of doing things let me tell you this if there's any young Baptist men out there looking at my daughter there's no way there is no way amen but when you're a prophet you can do certain things because you can see sometimes the end from the beginning we can't do that so I'm going to I'm going to correct brother George here just for a moment and say if young men from other churches from other denominations come in for your daughters Brothers do not give them to them amen but when a prophet sees what's coming down that road he can do it if he's got thus sayeth the Lord I don't have thus sayeth the Lord amen but I I thought that was an amazing thing because most of us would say no right rightfully so we would say no but that Prophet looking further down could see exactly what was coming and he had no problem with it amen I love how he said the reason for that Ministry success is the prayers of faithful people you know who John Ryan was right he was the the man who got healed of his blindness but he he went up for the prayer line and brother Bram says okay you're healed and the next day John Ryan came back and said I thought you said I was healed and brother Braham said I thought you said you believed and two weeks later he's in the barber's chair and they're giving him a hard time about it and his eyes come open because what happened is he went he testified for two weeks hear all about it hear all about it I'm Healed of my of my blindness these things and he testified without it yet being there and then while they're making fun of him in the barber shop his eyes came open and then he really had that you know and I didn't know that that was a that was a new thing for me that he followed along then and prayed for those meetings but how many times can we point to that and it was the prayer of a faithful mother of a faithful Saint that's back in the background and we don't know what it was brother Bron would talk about that that woman that that got on her knees and she got a burden to have meetings and she she you know brought in a minister and she hired a place and only one young man got saved but it was Dwight Moody I think was the one he said that woman's pray prayers a million souls to Christ through her prayer to bring the man in that would bring in those different ones amen but through it all he says the footsteps of a righteous man are ordered of the Lord and I love how he said the first witness is your changed life amen that people can look at the way we live the things we say the things we don't say the things we do the things we don't do and that is our witness before we ever open our mouth amen amen that was just wonderful let's all stand together if we would and I'll invite brother Bob's already here I think but we're going to sing that song he's got it all in control anden I thought that was just beautiful that through all those things you know it it struck me when he said you know brother brandham died and they just they were despondent much like when Christ left he died and what do we do now what do we do now but he said what did we start to do we started to pray we started to read our Bible we started to dwell on the word and all of a sudden we knew what to do we knew where to go and we got a burden and we started to do the work of the Lord and sometimes that's what's got to happen is the the great soldiers have to die so that great soldiers can rise up behind them and carry the battle and carry the word forward amen that's beautiful let's sing it he's got it all in controls we hand it over to brother Bob and he's got it all in control he's got it all in control for he put that reassurance way down in my soul he's got it all in [Music] control my father knows [Music] I love everything I go through he knows what for amen my father knows what I need bless the Lord I put my life in [Music] yes amen I put my life [Music]
