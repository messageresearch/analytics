[46:25] the trust for seeking the truth a man
[46:28] the truth for us not abandon what is
[46:31] written as reference tear is going on in
[46:33] your life and going down and Maile a man
[46:36] beyond the sacred page I seek the Lord
[46:38] that's going beyond this into the
[46:40] manifestation of a man not just the
[46:43] letter of the word but the spirit of the
[46:45] word a man so that we're going to have
[46:47] whether bottle of God refers to tonight
[46:50] and that is a spiritual faith a man but
[46:53] his to many said just got an
[46:54] intellectual faint they got a faint by
[46:57] the letter of the word but not the
[46:58] spirit of a man so entrusted by the
[47:01] grace of God that we have Holy Ghost
[47:03] faith a man not intellectual not and not
[47:06] even in our heads but in our hearts
[47:08] because if God is looking for faith he's
[47:12] looking in your heart and that is the
[47:14] faith that pleases God it's not what's
[47:16] in your head it's what's in your heart
[47:18] so entrusted by the grace of God that we
[47:20] have their faith that pleases him
[47:22] amen by the grace of God so the Lord
[47:25] bless you we're going to go into a
[47:28] message by the prophet a man I could
[47:31] take it maybe take several certain
[47:33] sermons on it the problem of God is
[47:35] taking one sermon but as I had already
[47:38] mentioned on Sunday that somebody said
[47:41] to me you know well in our church when
[47:44] we have communion we just do the
[47:45] communion service and the foot washing
[47:47] but the proud of God would minister the
[47:50] problem of God would preach and not not
[47:53] just for a few minutes and in fact this
[47:55] radio is just before they have a
[47:57] communion service a man in Brenham
[48:00] tabernacle and he preaches for an hour
[48:02] and a half so by the grace of God
[48:05] according to the will of God we want we
[48:09] one here the how and a half but I've
[48:11] moved it forward so that maybe it'll be
[48:13] around an hour but he goes into an hour
[48:15] and a half he had not only that he
[48:18] didn't come to preach but rather brother
[48:20] Neville when brother Neville saw brother
[48:22] Branham back in Jeffersonville and had
[48:24] the tabernacle he he called on the
[48:26] Prophet to come up and and just talk for
[48:29] a little bit he said a little bit
[48:32] but again brother oh if he only knew
[48:35] that he was he was buddy the Prophet he
[48:37] was inviting God he was inviting Jesus
[48:39] to the pulpit a man and it was Justin
[48:42] but it wasn't for a little bit a man he
[48:44] went on for a whole night and he said I
[48:46] wish I had more time
[48:48] a man so brother I shall eternal it is
[48:51] God is not even when it comes to me just
[48:53] a few minutes here in a few minutes
[48:54] there no in the beginning was the word
[48:57] the Word was with God the Word was God a
[48:59] man and brother it took two thousand
[49:02] years for God to bring this to pass to
[49:06] two thousand years for God to write his
[49:08] word a man not just a few minutes not
[49:12] just what we would like just as quick as
[49:14] we can no no we will we'll follow his
[49:17] leadership Amen why because when we get
[49:19] into the word we're getting out of time
[49:22] and into eternity
[49:23] amen so brother in the nights right here
[49:27] and he said I know he said that some of
[49:29] you he said are hungry and he says you
[49:31] want to go get your dinner or supper
[49:32] whatever and he said don't do that
[49:34] because apparently some got up and left
[49:37] the Tabernacle before he said you left
[49:40] he said to go get your meal but he was
[49:43] putting more and more emphasis on the
[49:44] spiritual meal not your physical a man
[49:47] because brother there was a time when
[49:49] when believers just fasted and prayed
[49:51] fasted and pray and they would go on for
[49:54] days and not not eat anything a man they
[49:57] would drink water but they wouldn't eat
[49:58] natural food why because the emphasis
[50:01] was on the spiritual a man let's put the
[50:04] emphasis on the spiritual but the
[50:06] matthew was saying I hope by the journey
[50:07] you were going to preach me man well I
[50:09] said I'll preach and we're brother
[50:11] branham to a man so he will get it out
[50:15] of the mouth of two or three witnesses
[50:16] may be let it be established a man so
[50:19] the public of God is going to minister
[50:21] on this subject here and it is
[50:23] blasphemous names and it was in nineteen
[50:26] and sixty-two but he highlights the fact
[50:29] and it's it's amazing he highlights it
[50:32] that it that it the problem he cities
[50:35] Brenham tabernacle and he said this is
[50:37] your problem and this is what he wanted
[50:39] to highlight that what he felt was a
[50:41] problem with the Saints that he was
[50:43] dealing with
[50:44] a mayor just trying to find where that
[50:46] was okay right here and he should now
[50:51] get this lesson hey man let's get to
[50:54] listen we're not coming ears just hear
[50:56] this doctrine this theology and this
[50:58] theology no no we want to get the real
[51:00] faith that pleases God so he said get
[51:03] this listen eat less and he said why he
[51:05] said here is what's wrong with the
[51:08] Brenham Tabernacle what preaching
[51:11] blasphemous names he was just he was
[51:14] just the exhorting as far as he was
[51:16] concerned he wasn't preaching he was
[51:18] exhorting but he said this is what's
[51:20] wrong with the Branham Tabernacle and he
[51:22] said there's a two different kinds of
[51:24] faith and the rattled Tabernacle was
[51:26] manifesting the wrong time
[51:28] any event oh yeah the wrong kind of
[51:31] faith he says see it's not that it's
[51:33] this so I pray you will recognize that
[51:35] as beginning to the message on
[51:37] blasphemous names a man and then you're
[51:40] going to catch and a man then you'll
[51:43] make your calling your election sure
[51:44] make sure you got the right kind of
[51:46] faith amen
[51:47] so I pray the grace of God that we got
[51:50] God's feet I pray the grace of God we
[51:52] got it got it got the faith of the word
[51:54] amen
[51:55] and it's not in her heads it's in our
[51:57] hearts and I'm the Prophet is
[51:58] highlighting the fact that many have
[52:00] faith in their heads but they don't have
[52:02] it in their hearts amen and that's what
[52:05] God is looking for because brother if
[52:07] God is going to do it going to manifest
[52:09] his will and he's going to move
[52:11] according to his will he's gonna make
[52:12] his will flesh it's got to be faith in
[52:14] the heart a man he's gotta have somebody
[52:17] that believes in their heart there are
[52:20] many that believe in their head but how
[52:21] many believe in the heart
[52:23] many are believing the message in their
[52:24] heads but I'm here believing in the
[52:26] heart and as I said on Sunday it's a sad
[52:29] but it is true that made there's many a
[52:32] believer they just say well I'm a
[52:33] believer what do you mean well I mean
[52:35] the message oh yeah they act like it
[52:39] they talk like it Amen but they're not
[52:41] living like it and that I give you pre
[52:43] evidence to the message in their heart
[52:46] amen it's all the head but not the heart
[52:49] is their physical being is their
[52:50] feelings but not in the heart it is not
[52:53] faith so I pray the grace of God you
[52:56] know
[52:57] trait but I pray the grace of God it is
[52:59] the faith that peace is gone because
[53:01] without faith it is impossible to please
[53:04] him and it's got to be is faith it's
[53:07] gotta be what he reveals and how he
[53:09] reveals it and where he reveals it and
[53:11] brother and what does God do it and how
[53:14] does he do it
[53:14] where does he do it in the heart amen
[53:17] and it is by the Holy Ghost it's got to
[53:19] be a Holy Ghost State Amen not religious
[53:23] faith for spiritual faith by the grace
[53:25] of God and we'll get into that and just
[53:28] pray the grace of God brother he-man and
[53:32] to us as we go into the word tonight
[53:34] pray the grace of God as your pastor is
[53:37] going to highlight on some things and
[53:38] also keep in prayer our brother brother
[53:41] Jonathan that will be traveling this
[53:43] weekend and our brother John and we pray
[53:47] the grace of God to our brother John and
[53:49] the Lord will help him especially
[53:51] concerning the things that he has
[53:52] endured these last few hours are cooked
[53:55] 24 hours of two days
[53:57] amen so it and it is the situation's the
[54:01] circumstance that struck me when I was
[54:04] into the Internet and I in the news and
[54:08] they were highlighting what was
[54:09] happening on that street where our
[54:10] brother was living and where our brother
[54:12] John was working so I pray the grace of
[54:15] God to our brother John because of what
[54:17] he has witnessed and what he has
[54:19] experienced is not easy no indeed it is
[54:22] not easy a man because he witnessed he
[54:25] witnessed the injuries of an individual
[54:29] he witnessed the death of an individual
[54:30] and he was there of course - I believe
[54:34] he was there to carry out a blanket or a
[54:36] sheet to lay over him so we pray God
[54:39] whoever he is we pray God rest his soul
[54:40] a man and and pray the grace of God to
[54:44] the police who were investigating amen
[54:47] so grace grace to those that were
[54:49] responsible and I understand that after
[54:52] that
[54:53] somebody witnessed the fact that there
[54:55] was two or three people that came up
[54:57] came back to that area and one of them
[55:00] was crying they were crying because of
[55:06] what happened and of course then they
[55:09] saw somebody and they took off and they
[55:11] left again so they are they don't know
[55:13] so God knows who they are I pray God
[55:17] bring conviction in their hearts so the
[55:19] Lord help us and God's grace to our
[55:21] brother John as of course he deals with
[55:24] these and it's not going to be overnight
[55:26] it might be something that will come
[55:29] back and back and back to his memory of
[55:31] what he is witnessed they met one thing
[55:34] is certain he won't forget his trip to
[55:36] Newfoundland amen oh yeah brothers not
[55:41] only as fellowship with us but what he
[55:43] experienced out there in the world and
[55:45] brother again it's a sign that the world
[55:47] is insane the problem of God not whether
[55:50] Fright Night is going going to come to
[55:52] pass it has come to pass the father of
[55:54] God said many many years ago he said
[55:57] this world is going insane and you're
[56:00] good we're going to witness that
[56:02] insanity and we are witnessing it
[56:03] because what's going on and what we're
[56:05] witnessing almost every day one time
[56:08] with me maybe be a year so many years
[56:10] before something like that would happen
[56:12] in Newfoundland but now you don't know
[56:14] what the next day is going to bring
[56:16] forth because it's the end of all things
[56:18] so god help us is my prayer amen
[56:22] and god bless our brother john to deal
[56:25] with these issues no doubt they'll come
[56:27] to his memory many times and of course
[56:30] we still welcome our brother back to
[56:32] Newfoundland if the Lord let him let him
[56:34] that way if he filled it of the Lord if
[56:36] is the desire of his art to come back
[56:38] and fellowship with us we were certainly
[56:40] looking forward to it but being prayer
[56:42] for our brother as he travels on Monday
[56:45] a man and also prof course pray for our
[56:48] brother Jonathan as he would journey
[56:51] here and he will arrive on a late on a
[56:53] Friday night and
[56:55] and I understand he'd be leaving to go
[56:57] back to rich Colombia on a Wednesday so
[57:00] the Lord bless him and also god bless
[57:02] sister Blanca in her needs right now and
[57:06] the family amen
[57:09] also I was wondering if anybody else
[57:12] would have what I've been looking for
[57:14] and that is a picture of something that
[57:19] happened in the ministry of Woodham
[57:20] Branham I went through a folder of
[57:22] pictures that I had but I didn't find
[57:24] that picture I have seen that picture
[57:26] and I might have a copy of it somewhere
[57:28] else in my files but it's a picture of
[57:32] the prophet of God when he was
[57:34] ministering to the sick and deserting
[57:36] the thoughts and intents of the heart
[57:37] and praying for the sick and to finally
[57:41] he looked to his right and there was a
[57:43] sister sitting in the sin then one of
[57:46] the seats and she had a shadow over her
[57:48] and somebody went and the probably God I
[57:51] lighted it and somebody took a picture
[57:53] and sure enough there was the sister
[57:55] sitting there and the shadow was over
[57:57] her and I'm not sure maybe the Prophet
[57:59] had prayed for her and she was healed
[58:02] and then the shadow left a man so I've
[58:05] been looking for that picture I don't
[58:06] know if anybody else has got it or seen
[58:08] it the picture of that sister is sitting
[58:10] in the congregation with that shadow
[58:13] over her amen
[58:15] her brother's tremendous things that
[58:16] have happened in in the ministry of
[58:19] Malachi for a man and you know what all
[58:22] of it points to it all points to the
[58:24] coming of the Son of man not a son a man
[58:27] but the son of man and again reminding
[58:30] us of what the Prophet is saying he said
[58:32] I am NOT the son of man he said I am a
[58:36] son of man he said revealing or
[58:39] introducing the son of man a man and
[58:42] that's that is the truth if there's
[58:44] anyone that's been introduced in this
[58:45] hour in this age it is the son of man a
[58:48] man because it wasn't William Brennan
[58:51] doing what he did but it was it was
[58:54] Christ with us amen because that pillar
[58:57] of fire came down a man in 19 and 33
[59:01] praise the name of the Lord
[59:03] amen and he begin to ministers through a
[59:06] prophet to reveal himself as he meant
[59:09] through John and brother was John didn't
[59:11] introduced him he didn't introduce
[59:12] himself
[59:13] it was the messenger that introduced him
[59:15] a man when John baptized him he came out
[59:18] of the water and he and John said behold
[59:21] the lamb of God that takes away the sin
[59:22] of the world
[59:23] a man sir John knew who he was that was
[59:27] the messenger who had to introduce him
[59:29] to the world and brother there was a
[59:30] messenger in this hour this age and
[59:32] again we know Malachi for speaks of 2
[59:35] and as what he's pointing the father's
[59:37] to the children and is plenty the
[59:39] children back to the father's it was the
[59:41] it was the Jewish fathers pointed to the
[59:44] Pentecostal children now it's the
[59:46] Pentecostal fathers plenty of her and
[59:48] the children and putting us back to the
[59:50] Pentecostal father's and what God was
[59:52] doing on the day of Pentecost a man he
[59:55] was revealing himself as Lord and Savior
[59:58] and he's revealed himself in this hour
[1:00:00] again to the bright brace the name of
[1:00:02] the Lord and but as he was crucified
[1:00:05] then he's crucified now the word I pray
[1:00:08] God that we're not going to crucify the
[1:00:11] influence of the word in our lives
[1:00:13] amen we're going to let him go beyond
[1:00:15] our heads and into our hearts by the
[1:00:18] grace of Almighty God amen so pray God
[1:00:21] will speak to our hearts speak to our
[1:00:24] souls sure they're going forth of this
[1:00:26] word tonight concerning blasphemous
[1:00:28] names amen
[1:00:30] and as I said it wasn't he didn't come
[1:00:33] to preach the sermon
[1:00:34] he's just what the Lord laid on his
[1:00:35] heart amen when when brother Neville
[1:00:38] invited him out amen and so great the
[1:00:43] grace of God as we go into the word
[1:00:48] share a quote with you that I received
[1:00:52] that brother gave it's the other night
[1:00:53] and brother David had it framed and and
[1:00:57] on he's in his bedroom on one of the
[1:01:02] furniture and I said oh I think I should
[1:01:06] share that with the Saints so he said
[1:01:08] you could take it and it said this is
[1:01:11] from the search ages and he said the
[1:01:15] cloudy skies and storms of life are no
[1:01:19] signs of God's disapproval
[1:01:22] sometimes we feel bad things experience
[1:01:25] negative things in our lives is not a
[1:01:27] sign of God's disapproval a mayor he
[1:01:30] said neither our bright skies and still
[1:01:33] waters of his love and approval know a
[1:01:37] mayor
[1:01:38] it says his approval of any of us is
[1:01:42] only in the beloved
[1:01:44] and that's Christ amen we want approval
[1:01:49] we got to be in Christ amen Christ in us
[1:01:53] and not in our flesh but in our hearts
[1:01:55] and he said his love is elective which
[1:01:59] he had for us before the foundation of
[1:02:01] the world
[1:02:02] does he love us yes but Alma out shall
[1:02:06] we know we shall know because he said so
[1:02:10] do we believe it and if we love he loves
[1:02:13] up we love him
[1:02:14] amen and he said we should know him
[1:02:17] because he said so and manifested that
[1:02:20] he did love us for he brought us to
[1:02:22] himself and he gave us of his spirit
[1:02:26] placing us as sons are you a son of God
[1:02:30] we're either the children of the of God
[1:02:33] or the turn of the devil
[1:02:34] you're either seek the seed of God or
[1:02:37] serpent seed I pretty grace that we are
[1:02:40] not serpents eat my brother it's your
[1:02:44] attitude your spirit your motives your
[1:02:46] objectives actions and reactions that
[1:02:48] reveal what spirit you are under are we
[1:02:53] serpent seed or the seed of God oh my
[1:02:57] let's find out what the seed of God are
[1:02:59] they act that they talk what is their
[1:03:01] spirit what is their attitude do you
[1:03:03] have their spirit and attitude brother
[1:03:06] god help us anybody it is very serious
[1:03:10] and it's less and less and less in this
[1:03:13] world because jesus said if he didn't
[1:03:16] shorten time to be no flesh saved grace
[1:03:18] of God to us amen
[1:03:21] he brought us to himself and he gave us
[1:03:24] his spirit now do you have his spirit or
[1:03:27] do you have the devil's spirit a man oh
[1:03:30] yeah there there's that pulse anointing
[1:03:35] so I prayed we got the true anointing
[1:03:37] and if it's true it'll be in our hearts
[1:03:40] and in our souls and how shall I prove
[1:03:42] my love to him it says by believing what
[1:03:46] he said and by conducting myself with
[1:03:49] joy amidst the trials that he and his
[1:03:52] wisdom allows to come to pass that
[1:03:54] you're going to be thankful even for the
[1:03:57] trials thank you Lord you want to bring
[1:03:59] up what's in me you want to bring up my
[1:04:02] faith or lack of faith amen
[1:04:05] I trust he's bringing out it's your
[1:04:07] faith amen in him
[1:04:09] by the grace of God and let's make sure
[1:04:11] it's the Holy Ghost faith and the
[1:04:13] problem of God is bringing it out in
[1:04:14] this message blasphemous names amen the
[1:04:18] true faith and a false fee amen
[1:04:21] but they're going so close who deceive
[1:04:23] the very elect if possible a man so god
[1:04:26] help us brother is my prayer as we we
[1:04:29] will go into the word Lord bless you
[1:04:31] turn with me to st. Matthew's Gospel
[1:04:33] chapter 24 say Manya's Gospel chapter 24
[1:04:43] praise the Lord
[1:04:45] so God's grace for the family of those
[1:04:47] that were involved in the Bond Street
[1:04:49] tragedy oh yeah we said oh that was this
[1:04:53] that was this yeah but if you're a
[1:04:55] father if you're a mother of your
[1:04:56] grandfather grandmother you're going to
[1:04:58] enter into the to the sorrow that
[1:05:00] they're going to feel and that they're
[1:05:02] going to send so now he that apparently
[1:05:04] like I said like that like those that
[1:05:06] came back after all that after the
[1:05:09] shooting that what and they were crying
[1:05:12] one of them was crying oh yeah so so
[1:05:16] maybe they felt bad about the tragedy so
[1:05:19] we pray the grace of God the conviction
[1:05:20] of the Holy Ghost in their hearts and
[1:05:22] souls amen and God comfort those that
[1:05:26] need his comfort and in Matthew 24 and
[1:05:30] beginning to read at verse 32
[1:05:40] we'll start with verse 31 again when the
[1:05:43] Son of man shall come in his glory and
[1:05:45] all the holy angels with him because
[1:05:51] they could have called twelve legions of
[1:05:52] angels our brother Dave was asking me a
[1:05:55] couple of nights ago or last night
[1:05:57] whenever no and he was asking me how
[1:06:00] many is in Allegiant well there was
[1:06:02] three five and six thousand in Allegiant
[1:06:05] and he could have called twelve legions
[1:06:07] yeah of angels and then they used the
[1:06:11] word Legion because during the days of
[1:06:13] Christ the the Legion of the Roman
[1:06:16] soldiers involved around 5,000 to 6,000
[1:06:19] soldiers a mayor and Jesus referring to
[1:06:22] the twelve legions of angels he could
[1:06:24] have called thousands a man of angels
[1:06:28] and he said when the Son of man shall
[1:06:30] come in his glory and all the holy
[1:06:33] angels with him then shall he sit upon
[1:06:37] the throne of his glory amen
[1:06:41] Alleluia and yes sit upon the throne of
[1:06:45] his glory and before him shall be
[1:06:47] gathered all nations and he shall
[1:06:49] separate them one from another as a
[1:06:51] shepherd divideth his sheep from the
[1:06:54] goats let's make sure that we're sheep
[1:06:56] and not goats amen and he shall set the
[1:07:00] sheep on his right hand but the goats on
[1:07:03] the left and then shall the King say
[1:07:06] unto them on his right hand come ye
[1:07:09] blessed of my father inherit the kingdom
[1:07:12] prepared for you from the foundation of
[1:07:15] the world Alleluia

[1:07:20] I was thirsting and he gave me drink I
[1:07:25] was a stranger and he took me in did you
[1:07:28] I preached on that going to hell because
[1:07:32] not because of what you did because what
[1:07:33] you didn't do amen
[1:07:36] because jesus said in as much you didn't
[1:07:38] do it to these you didn't do the least

[1:07:42] about what they did but anyone on sin
[1:07:44] but you didn't do this and he set them
[1:07:47] to hell he caught why because then as
[1:07:50] much you didn't do it on to the least
[1:07:53] didn't do it to me they rejected him so
[1:07:56] brother I pray gracious that God's not
[1:07:58] going to judge us for rejecting him
[1:08:00] they thought we refused to help this one
[1:08:01] refused to help that one any man that
[1:08:04] we'd be refused to encourage this one or
[1:08:06] comfort this one a man to be there for
[1:08:08] those in need
[1:08:09] oh yeah if you're not there for those in
[1:08:12] need

[1:20:45] if you will it might be good I want to
[1:20:47] use this shirt I had someone didn't have
[1:20:50] it to put on front last week so we he
[1:20:52] thought made it in it would give a
[1:20:54] little better for today I wanted to talk
[1:20:56] on it because it pertained to a dream a
[1:21:00] sister had I wonder
[1:21:02] his sister Shepherd is in the church
[1:21:04] this morning I met her the other night
[1:21:06] and the first time I'd seen the woman
[1:21:08] actually I didn't even know who she WA
[1:21:09] is I guess she's not yes would you mind
[1:21:12] would it be anything out of the way if I
[1:21:14] referred to that dream sister Shepherd
[1:21:16] you wouldn't mind would you all right
[1:21:18] sorry and before we approach that let's
[1:21:22] bow our heads now again gracious
[1:21:25] Heavenly Father to thee we give praise
[1:21:28] for all thy goodness and mercy and now
[1:21:32] quietness down Lord that we might study
[1:21:35] the word of the Living God
[1:21:39] as it comes to us through vision and is
[1:21:44] confirmed by the holy spirit backed up
[1:21:47] by the Bible so we pray that you'll give
[1:21:50] us understanding that we might know what
[1:21:52] to do in these last days as we see the
[1:21:55] evil powers settling around us now the
[1:21:59] battle the final battle is just about to
[1:22:03] be thought help us lord is real water
[1:22:06] strong let us keep the shield of faith
[1:22:10] up with a word of God the sword and move
[1:22:13] forward in Jesus name Amen
[1:22:17] now
[1:22:24] thinking of moving forward a battle like
[1:22:29] a battle set in a ray ready to go into
[1:22:32] action a real battle to fight the fight
[1:22:38] of faith sister Shepard here and brother
[1:22:44] Shepard who are very gracious friends of
[1:22:48] ours and who come to this Tabernacle and
[1:22:52] they are a precious children of God and
[1:22:55] and this sister Shepherd when I was
[1:22:59] picking up my mail the kind that Billy
[1:23:02] can answer just somebody say save me so
[1:23:04] many prayer clothes and I pray with him
[1:23:06] he just answers them back but when it's
[1:23:08] an individual letter I have to answer it
[1:23:10] myself you see so I picked up my
[1:23:13] individual mail and so I was taking it
[1:23:19] home and I was reading in there said
[1:23:21] from sister Shepherd and it was a dream
[1:23:24] that she had had some months ago and she
[1:23:29] never could get it just right until two
[1:23:32] or three Sundays ago when I taught all
[1:23:33] this this seven church ages and and the
[1:23:39] seven fruits second Peter how it takes
[1:23:43] the second Peter one to add to our faith
[1:23:48] the first foundationally is faith second
[1:23:53] add to your faith virtue to your virtue
[1:23:56] and knowledge from knowledge temperance
[1:23:58] temperance patience to patience
[1:24:01] godliness and from godless brotherly
[1:24:03] love brotherly kindness and then love
[1:24:05] being the capstone seven all those
[1:24:08] things
[1:24:09] seven Church ages see and seven stars of
[1:24:14] the church ages and all of it is
[1:24:17] tempered together by the Holy Spirit
[1:24:20] now that's what it takes to become a
[1:24:24] servant of Christ Christ build this
[1:24:27] church in seven Church ages his bride a
[1:24:30] person woman Church seven
[1:24:35] ages constitute and make the bride some
[1:24:38] out of this age and some out of that
[1:24:40] agents some out of that ages all
[1:24:42] together and shaping it like a pyramid
[1:24:47] like Enoch you built the pyramids that
[1:24:50] we believe and the capstone never was
[1:24:52] put on top of them because the headstone
[1:24:55] was rejected and we taken out not as
[1:24:58] doctrine but as to understand just
[1:25:02] through the church here that these God
[1:25:09] makes his self perfect in three
[1:25:12] he makes yourself perfect and Father Son
[1:25:15] Holy Ghost
[1:25:16] three officers of one God he makes this
[1:25:19] self perfect and justification
[1:25:21] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost
[1:25:23] come perfect works of grace he makes
[1:25:26] yourself perfected in three comings
[1:25:28] first time to redeem his bribes second
[1:25:30] times you receive his bride third time
[1:25:32] in the Millennium with his bride and
[1:25:35] everything is perfected in threes and
[1:25:40] seven is the worship number of God God
[1:25:43] is worshiped in seven completed now
[1:25:47] perfected and completed and the strange
[1:25:52] thing was not to bring this in but just
[1:25:55] to show you the last deer that I got had
[1:25:58] five points on one side and three on the
[1:26:00] other see grease and perfection now
[1:26:05] notice on this like Christ God wrote
[1:26:10] three Bibles the first Bible was in the
[1:26:13] sky called the zodiac now if you don't
[1:26:17] know the book of Job just forget about
[1:26:18] it call because job is the one explains
[1:26:21] it how that he looked up and he named
[1:26:24] those things in the sky and notice in
[1:26:27] the zodiac what you start off with the
[1:26:30] first thing in the zodiac is the Virgin
[1:26:34] the last thing in the zodiac is Leo the
[1:26:38] line the first coming of Christ through
[1:26:40] the verge of the second coming Leo the
[1:26:43] line the line of the tribe of Judah then
[1:26:47] deena completed in his day are back in
[1:26:50] that day appear me and of course you
[1:26:54] haven't got time to background it and
[1:26:56] show how that that pyramid come up
[1:26:59] through the chambers and so for this
[1:27:00] speaks right straight to the end time
[1:27:02] now they're in the King's Chamber now
[1:27:04] for the measurement but the headstone
[1:27:07] never was put on the pyramid and that's
[1:27:10] such perfect architecture ER or masonry
[1:27:13] until even a little thin razor blade and
[1:27:17] they don't know how they ever build
[1:27:19] don't understand could ever erase your
[1:27:22] brain slice along the sides where that
[1:27:24] martyr should be in the dough barter in
[1:27:26] it it just perfected tucked together so
[1:27:31] that's what it is what Christ and the
[1:27:33] church becomes one there's no mortar
[1:27:36] between there's nothing between just God
[1:27:39] and the person God Christ and the person
[1:27:44] now but the capstone they've never found
[1:27:48] it you know the stone scrolling heaven
[1:27:50] England the arty the Kings are two to
[1:27:54] crown him and so forth but the headstone
[1:27:57] notice on American dollar bill you'll
[1:28:01] see if on the American dollar bill on
[1:28:04] the one side the left side is the
[1:28:06] American seal an eagle with the spears
[1:28:10] in his hand on the second side this is
[1:28:12] called a seal of the United States but
[1:28:15] on the next side is the peer made and
[1:28:18] above it a great eye and under here says
[1:28:22] the Great Seal why would it be the Great
[1:28:27] Seal in this nation even above the seal
[1:28:30] of our nation see no matter what she
[1:28:33] ever did God makes us speak just the
[1:28:35] same see he makes the sinner speak out
[1:28:38] he makes the nation speak of it
[1:28:40] everything has to speak of you more to
[1:28:41] you you want to believe it or not it's
[1:28:44] right there
[1:28:44] now nor sees the eye and at the eye of
[1:28:47] God and because that the cap didn't come
[1:28:52] off the head seal because it was
[1:28:54] rejected which was the son of God
[1:28:57] the cornerstone of the building the head
[1:28:59] seal of the pyramids and all this now
[1:29:02] now I'm I don't like to sometimes they
[1:29:08] take these things and it gets out
[1:29:11] amongst brethren in churches of other
[1:29:14] churches and when they do that then the
[1:29:17] Brethren sometime gets a wrong
[1:29:19] impression that I'm saying something
[1:29:21] about brethren but I'm not I if you
[1:29:25] could just listen and understand see I
[1:29:28] am NOT speaking against any brother
[1:29:31] cause that's not becoming to rather to
[1:29:34] speak of each other we should speak far
[1:29:37] one another not against each other but
[1:29:41] when I speak sometime of certain
[1:29:43] organization like Presbyterian methodist
[1:29:45] or so forth they say CII's against it
[1:29:48] I'm not against the brother in there or
[1:29:52] the sister either
[1:29:53] the system is separating Brotherhood
[1:29:56] it's what my speak against God's
[1:29:59] children are one family and are not
[1:30:02] different groups and some of it I have
[1:30:04] nothing to do with it because that's
[1:30:06] Presbyterian I'm Methodist see now that
[1:30:09] isn't see that it's the system of that
[1:30:13] organization that breaks up that
[1:30:15] Brotherhood see now that like I said if
[1:30:18] you were going down the river and an old
[1:30:19] shaggy looking Bolton's go to try to
[1:30:22] make the fall and I know that that isn't
[1:30:25] going to work well then I'm not
[1:30:27] screaming a rebuking you I'm trying to
[1:30:30] get you how that boat see because it's
[1:30:32] the boat that's going to break up and
[1:30:34] and you'll be left sitting alone in the
[1:30:37] water so so it's not it's not the
[1:30:40] brother in the boat but I'll holler at
[1:30:42] the brother to show you what's fixing to
[1:30:44] happen while all these systems that man
[1:30:48] has made in their achievement has got to
[1:30:51] break up that's all we might have to
[1:30:53] come we have to come to unity to
[1:30:55] Brotherhood that's been my purpose of
[1:30:57] life is to try to unite and not break up
[1:31:01] an organization but then drop their
[1:31:03] ideas and be brother say every
[1:31:06] born-again Christian
[1:31:07] that's the idea that's where L stood
[1:31:10] well now if their brother would notice
[1:31:13] it ah
[1:31:14] many of our brethren even in our Full
[1:31:17] Gospel rank they do not believe that the
[1:31:20] Baptist and Methodist and the Lutheran
[1:31:23] and then have a chance but not they may
[1:31:26] be right but I don't agree with that I
[1:31:29] believe it's a age here of the Luther
[1:31:31] Age in this age here which was called
[1:31:34] obvi the Sardis age and then the
[1:31:37] Philadelphia age for the Methodists and
[1:31:41] then the Pentecostal layout see an age
[1:31:43] of these those are angels and God in
[1:31:47] each one of those ages TUC unelected
[1:31:51] people and in that if Hebrews 11 says
[1:31:56] that them without us has not made
[1:31:59] perfect and see but now the church has
[1:32:01] come from this coming in a minority all
[1:32:04] time so it's down into the 50 costal age
[1:32:08] now the reason I'm saying this that you
[1:32:11] might get an idea on what to assist your
[1:32:13] dreams and her dream is certainly
[1:32:16] comparison to what I've been teaching
[1:32:18] notice now here now all these Saints a
[1:32:22] first Peter the 6th and 7th verse tells
[1:32:26] it from by your faith that's first now I
[1:32:29] say that people claim to have these
[1:32:31] virtues without even being born again
[1:32:34] and I believe I've made a rude remark
[1:32:36] and says like a black bird trying to put
[1:32:38] peacock feathers in himself and make
[1:32:40] yourself a peacock you can't do it
[1:32:42] there's to be a natural feather growth
[1:32:43] drumming the inside of nets put that
[1:32:45] feather out and always not always been
[1:32:49] accused to being hard on our sisters
[1:32:52] about wearing bobbed hair and manicure
[1:32:55] all over their faces tough
[1:32:56] I've always been accused being hard on
[1:32:59] our sisters it is that I got anything
[1:33:02] against that I don't say the woman isn't
[1:33:04] a good woman that she's some speak the
[1:33:07] halacha or something that isn't my
[1:33:09] attitude but it's this when she puts so
[1:33:12] much artificial on the outside shows as
[1:33:15] a lot of artificial on the inside think
[1:33:18] we're off to be filled up with
[1:33:19] because the outside always expresses
[1:33:23] what's on the inside by their fruits you
[1:33:25] know the anything and we're Christ or to
[1:33:28] be in there and to cure for the God and
[1:33:31] there's here for other things instead of
[1:33:34] so much artificial pumping you know
[1:33:37] green eyelids and unhuman looking and
[1:33:40] all that kind of stuff I just don't go
[1:33:42] for it and I don't be the Bible that's
[1:33:44] either so I like to be just what we are
[1:33:48] notice now if she hasn't got any
[1:33:51] fingernails and wants to put some on it
[1:33:54] she hasn't got any teeth and need some
[1:33:58] having got an arm and you need both
[1:34:00] haven't got hair and you need some you
[1:34:02] haven't got these things that's
[1:34:04] different but when you pull out you're a
[1:34:07] real good teeth because they're just not
[1:34:09] as bright as you should be and you don't
[1:34:12] know if you got red hair you won't black
[1:34:15] and you go down here you're colored
[1:34:16] black just because you're done wrong
[1:34:19] yeah I think so but the main thing is no
[1:34:22] scripture for that going to bother your
[1:34:24] hair there's scripture for that that
[1:34:26] plenty of that so there ain't we wanted
[1:34:28] I am sure that's right now now our
[1:34:31] sister in dreaming she dream that sheet
[1:34:35] well first she was disturbed what's the
[1:34:39] use of going on and trying to struggle
[1:34:43] through life if God requires us to
[1:34:45] receive the Holy Ghost and we don't have
[1:34:47] it now I don't think they may be taping
[1:34:52] this but the adult if they do it's for
[1:34:54] the church alone now if some brother
[1:34:58] would get a hold to this and you hear my
[1:35:00] voice brother on this remember I'm just
[1:35:03] teaching to my church you always before
[1:35:05] your congregation examine the the tapes
[1:35:08] and if you don't want your con Gatien
[1:35:10] here and don't let him here but I'm just
[1:35:12] trying to say to this a little group
[1:35:14] here that I as brother nevla knob of the
[1:35:17] Holy Spirit is trying to pastor ever and
[1:35:21] to teach them now there's some of these
[1:35:24] things that you might miserably disagree
[1:35:28] with so if there is just like I always
[1:35:30] said about eating fried chicken when you
[1:35:32] the bone you don't feel the chicken away
[1:35:34] he is still the bone away so Oh way to
[1:35:37] do that eat and cherry pie you're ready
[1:35:38] to seat you until the power you just
[1:35:40] fill the seat away so you do the same
[1:35:42] thing in listening to this now I believe
[1:35:46] that if the reason that there's so much
[1:35:50] confusion today about the Holy Spirit
[1:35:54] it's not correctly topped I believe that
[1:35:58] the baptism is taught and you say the
[1:36:00] baptism but then the like you say
[1:36:04] automobile but now I've got several
[1:36:08] mechanics in this church and I don't
[1:36:10] know one thing about so if I make a
[1:36:11] mistake breath remember I'm not a
[1:36:13] mechanic there has to be Carl's and
[1:36:16] plugs and parts and vowels and
[1:36:18] everything else it makes the automobile
[1:36:20] and when you talk about the baptism the
[1:36:23] Holy Spirit there's a lot goes with that
[1:36:26] hmm see there's a lot goes with that and
[1:36:31] here's what I think that God is proving
[1:36:35] the holy spirit is sheer see our Peter
[1:36:40] said first faith I watch it real close
[1:36:45] now we're going to teach this for a few
[1:36:46] minutes faith now is your first and add
[1:36:50] to your faith virtue to your virtue
[1:36:53] knowledge to your knowledge temperance
[1:36:56] to your temperance patience to your
[1:36:59] patience government irregardless
[1:37:02] brotherly love brotherly kindness and
[1:37:04] then love and anyone knows that love is
[1:37:09] God God is love see now that's then from
[1:37:16] this and that bringing it into the seven
[1:37:19] churches God is building in seven Church
[1:37:24] ages a bride for Christ amen through the
[1:37:29] Philadelphia Flatiron
[1:37:30] Ferguson sumerians emphasis a church
[1:37:34] agent Jesus said if the if the
[1:37:37] bridegroom come in the first watch are
[1:37:40] the seventh watch
[1:37:43] all these virgins awakened they were up
[1:37:47] there wolf the purchase of Elvis's
[1:37:50] Samaria Fergus cetera
[1:37:53] Cyrus Philadelphia and Leo seal did you
[1:37:56] notice that it was the seventh age that
[1:37:59] when he came and woke up those sleeping
[1:38:03] versions that brings him all the way
[1:38:05] back down to here c4 in this through the
[1:38:10] years ages he has built a bra board a
[1:38:17] bride begotten a bride order for Christ
[1:38:20] and the same way that he forgets this
[1:38:23] bride he has begot individuals now I'm
[1:38:28] back rounding this so that you will see
[1:38:31] when the sister's dream is being told
[1:38:33] now these failure
[1:38:36] absolutely must be in the Christian
[1:38:39] before the Holy Ghost ever seals them
[1:38:42] before this comes down on top and makes
[1:38:45] their complete unit now our sister
[1:38:49] Serena she was worried whether she had
[1:38:52] the Holy Ghost or not once she laid down
[1:38:55] across the doable where her husband was
[1:38:58] reading a paper and she's got little one
[1:39:00] says I had and they're always making the
[1:39:03] noise and things and so in this she fell
[1:39:06] asleep for approximately ten minutes or
[1:39:08] fifteen and she dreamed and she never
[1:39:10] could understand it or give it all
[1:39:12] together from a year ago almost until
[1:39:15] this message it was taught then while
[1:39:17] was teaching it all come back to her and
[1:39:19] she dreamed that she was praying she's
[1:39:23] walking the floor first before she dream
[1:39:25] and wringing her hands and thinking lord
[1:39:28] have I got the Holy Ghost
[1:39:30] can you prove to me some says because it
[1:39:33] and I shouted or some said because I
[1:39:35] hope it's him we believe it all that but
[1:39:38] I have a really God I believe in all
[1:39:40] those things those virtues speaking in
[1:39:42] tongues and shouting in all kinds of
[1:39:44] demonstrations I believe in every bit of
[1:39:46] it
[1:39:46] but if it's there without this there's
[1:39:49] nothing wrong
[1:39:51] ah see you got a share notice and she
[1:39:55] was worried tonight so she just laid
[1:39:58] down close to do a poll where her
[1:40:00] husband was reading and she went to
[1:40:01] sleep and she dreams she is up on a
[1:40:04] mountain and in this mountain the best I
[1:40:09] haven't got the paper before me but I
[1:40:10] think it's like this she dreamed that
[1:40:12] she saw a rock box like like a framework
[1:40:17] sitting right in top of this mountain
[1:40:20] and her husband but just behind her and
[1:40:25] she saw a large man standing there with
[1:40:27] work clothes long sleeves rolled up
[1:40:29] bathing the most pure water that she
[1:40:32] ever seen and pouring into this box this
[1:40:35] rock box sitting is top of the mountain
[1:40:38] and the rock box would not hold water
[1:40:41] and it rolled right out there and it's
[1:40:44] balled up all the trash and sticks and
[1:40:46] everything in there and boiling out and
[1:40:48] roll down the mountain and it rolled
[1:40:50] over her feet and she was standing right
[1:40:52] in that stuff only it didn't stick to
[1:40:54] her and and then she asked why the box
[1:40:59] didn't hold it and the man said that is
[1:41:01] not water that's the Holy Ghost and said
[1:41:05] nothing will hold it and said then he
[1:41:08] went back and got another big bucket and
[1:41:10] it was full of honey and poured the
[1:41:13] honey into there so no hole this and she
[1:41:17] thought that the boxer's a rock box is
[1:41:19] going to burst out and spill the honey
[1:41:21] but it isn't he finally stuck together
[1:41:22] and held it she turned and went down the
[1:41:25] mountain going down the mountain she
[1:41:28] stopped at the bottom of the mountain he
[1:41:30] looked back she saw five streams of this
[1:41:33] pure crystal water not contaminated by
[1:41:36] the things that didn't went through
[1:41:37] steel Puri clear coming swiftly then he
[1:41:41] slowed up then almost fading out and she
[1:41:47] was wondering would it ever reached the
[1:41:49] bottom of the mountain five stream and
[1:41:51] she woke up I think that's just about
[1:41:53] toast to being right in such a Shepherd
[1:41:54] now no more than I picked up the letter
[1:41:57] and open before I read it I saw a dream
[1:42:01] now
[1:42:02] dreams are interpretive now many of you
[1:42:04] come to me with dreams and say thanks to
[1:42:06] me about dreams I said wait a minute she
[1:42:08] never told it all think you go back and
[1:42:10] pick it up then if you can't tell what's
[1:42:13] your dream how you know the
[1:42:14] interpretations right or not see you've
[1:42:16] got the Hat you've got to see the dream
[1:42:18] a vision has to show the dream and when
[1:42:22] you see the dream that the person green
[1:42:24] they can tell them before they tell you
[1:42:27] then you know the interpreter philosophy
[1:42:30] that's in the scripture also Daniel one
[1:42:32] time what's that right said they're
[1:42:34] happy by just having to think of that
[1:42:36] thing see but you always see the dream
[1:42:38] now
[1:42:39] if its reputation drive a person to
[1:42:42] start telling your dream you can stop
[1:42:43] and say wait a minute and it was so and
[1:42:45] so while sewing salt plus so and so and
[1:42:47] then you say that's exactly right see a
[1:42:50] man the other day was trying to tell me
[1:42:51] a dream that he dream he said well he
[1:42:53] said I said nah brother whatta Julie
[1:42:56] about that as a coach he's the water
[1:42:58] report I said you dream that she threw a
[1:43:00] rock up in the air and I shot and got
[1:43:02] some mind he said that's exactly the
[1:43:04] truth brother man and they just picked
[1:43:06] the last part of it out yesterday mm-hm
[1:43:08] so there ya see why do you don't tell
[1:43:11] the truth of it but you see the always
[1:43:13] reveals back what tells you your dream
[1:43:17] what's your dream then you know it's
[1:43:19] right now here's interpretation of her
[1:43:22] dreams she was bothered about the holy
[1:43:25] spirit now it's the must-see scene the
[1:43:28] box on top of the mountain was the rock
[1:43:33] rock box is rock confession now like
[1:43:38] Jesus said in the scripture he said
[1:43:43] Peter said she said who does man say ah
[1:43:46] son of man am once at dark eyes Moses
[1:43:49] and so forth and he said but who do you
[1:43:52] say I am
[1:43:52] he said God - cries - son the Living God
[1:43:55] now some people saying of the Catholic
[1:43:58] Church says the Roman Catholic Church
[1:43:59] says that his can what the rock was that
[1:44:04] jesus said upon this rock I'll build my
[1:44:07] church and the gates of Hell shall not
[1:44:08] prevail against it they said it was upon
[1:44:11] Peter
[1:44:14] and Peter was that rock because Peter
[1:44:16] means little stone now on this little
[1:44:20] stone I'll build my church and upon
[1:44:22] teacher the apostolic succession they
[1:44:28] built the church then the Protestant
[1:44:31] church says that's wrong that it was up
[1:44:34] on himself he built the church now not
[1:44:37] to be disagreeable but up to my way of
[1:44:41] seeing it it's both wrong because he
[1:44:46] never filled up on Peter
[1:44:47] nearly did ability upon himself but it's
[1:44:49] up on Peters revelation of who he was
[1:44:52] see Judas man say I the Son of Man start
[1:44:55] Christ the Son of the Living God blessed
[1:44:58] art thou simon son of jonas flesh and
[1:45:01] blood has not revealed is you some
[1:45:03] similarity but my father which is in
[1:45:06] heaven has revealed to you darah Peter
[1:45:08] upon this rock of confession upon this
[1:45:11] revelation I'll build my church and
[1:45:15] that's been each church age has had that
[1:45:18] rock confession all up to this rock
[1:45:21] confession of the lady on SIA and now
[1:45:25] you cannot make a Holy Church there's no
[1:45:30] such a thing as a holy church or holy
[1:45:32] organization the Holy Spirit can be
[1:45:35] preached in it but in there you find
[1:45:37] good and bad Renegades indifferent and
[1:45:39] everything else so an organization will
[1:45:42] not hold your case a we got it no recip
[1:45:46] has no sir the Holy Spirit is poured out
[1:45:49] on individuals it's the individual so
[1:45:53] therefore the rock this latter-day
[1:45:56] Pentecostal church which has received
[1:45:59] the Holy Spirit they did at the first
[1:46:01] all rounds of the agents they receive
[1:46:03] the Holy Spirit but not in the measure
[1:46:05] that they have it now cause it's a
[1:46:06] restoration of the first as we take the
[1:46:08] candlesticks Alpha and Omega how they
[1:46:11] lift the first camel it went higher
[1:46:13] higher got dimmer dimmer and then come
[1:46:14] back again see first and last and so
[1:46:17] forth now but in this church age the
[1:46:21] message is being poured into
[1:46:24] but the church body itself in all
[1:46:27] together like this this Tabernacle will
[1:46:29] say that's where she comes to church
[1:46:31] this tabernacle is not a Holy Ghost
[1:46:34] Tabernacle there's no such a thing
[1:46:38] individuals that come into this church
[1:46:40] is Holy Ghost Tabernacles
[1:46:42] there are Tabernacles that contain the
[1:46:45] Holy Ghost but not the church in the
[1:46:47] body of group therefore it runs out but
[1:46:50] what this man who was flooring the water
[1:46:53] the messenger to the church pouring the
[1:46:55] message into the church but what was the
[1:46:58] water doing it was bawling out all the
[1:47:00] trash that was in it that's what the
[1:47:02] Holy Spirit does boils it up now now the
[1:47:07] honey represented brotherly love
[1:47:11] brotherly kindness which is this age I
[1:47:15] just got you telling see a brotherly
[1:47:18] kindness the age that we live in now now
[1:47:21] you might say look I sure don't like
[1:47:25] brother nails
[1:47:26] I sure don't like brother Jones I don't
[1:47:29] like brother so-and-so and something
[1:47:32] like that but just let something happen
[1:47:33] to him come on your hearts broke and is
[1:47:38] here to kill you
[1:47:39] see we can't obtain brotherly kindness
[1:47:42] and feelings for one another
[1:47:44] see look the main pane and a group of
[1:47:49] people why do you care for that brother
[1:47:50] because you broke bread with your
[1:47:52] daughter as you will tonight you
[1:47:55] fellowship with you you shook his hands
[1:47:57] you worship with him he's your brother
[1:47:59] and you might do something in the flesh
[1:48:02] that you would disagree with cause you
[1:48:04] just kind of still wish you often to do
[1:48:06] but shun evil little but in the bottom
[1:48:09] of your heart or something happen to
[1:48:11] that brother it would just nearly kill
[1:48:12] you or that sister oh I'm an old man I
[1:48:15] was once young and I'm old I've seen it
[1:48:18] down to the age do that hear people say
[1:48:21] oh I just won't have the more to do with
[1:48:22] him and something happen to that man and
[1:48:24] then it kills you me thanks Oh God I'll
[1:48:27] let my precious brother go without
[1:48:28] making them friends with even singing
[1:48:30] thanks see it's brotherly love it looks
[1:48:33] like it won't stick but it does
[1:48:34] the honey it's thick now in so much that
[1:48:40] she come from there down the hill to the
[1:48:44] bottom of the hill
[1:48:45] now this glorious life was gushing over
[1:48:50] Hills in five streams now five is a
[1:48:54] number of grace j esus f AR th gra cec-5
[1:49:01] is a number of grace five streams was
[1:49:06] pouring from up here at the top down
[1:49:09] tear each one of these ages had that
[1:49:13] rock confession the saints are sleeping
[1:49:16] waiting waiting waiting wait and see
[1:49:19] onto this age but soon the Holy Ghost
[1:49:24] being poured out from Christ will come I
[1:49:29] will seal up the church then the church
[1:49:34] will be raptured it'll be a complete
[1:49:36] unit of God a bride for Christ who will
[1:49:41] be the head of all things you follow me
[1:49:44] now
[1:49:45] now she was wandering not in her dream
[1:49:48] she was wandering with this little
[1:49:50] stream with this little stream ever get
[1:49:54] to the bottom see it was drying up now
[1:49:57] being achiever self now here's what I
[1:50:02] want you to get you now she herself was
[1:50:05] wondering about her own self did she
[1:50:08] have the Holy Ghost now shouldn't say in
[1:50:11] this a few days ago thinking at the
[1:50:13] Church of these spiritual enough to
[1:50:15] catch it and maybe I'll go return this
[1:50:18] tape off right in half but of course I
[1:50:21] don't really get out amongst brethren
[1:50:22] but you could speak with tongues you
[1:50:27] could shop you could dance you could
[1:50:29] cast out devils do anything you want to
[1:50:31] instill not have the Holy Ghost did nun
[1:50:36] disciples come back rejoicing and
[1:50:38] shouting because the Devils are subject
[1:50:40] unto that
[1:50:41] and Jesus our mom was Judas then our
[1:50:47] Jesus Satan that day when he comes that
[1:50:49] many will company as they lured him out
[1:50:51] cast out devils and in your name done
[1:50:53] mighty works then I'll say depart from
[1:50:55] me you workers of iniquity I didn't know
[1:50:57] yet those things are not indications of
[1:51:00] the Holy Spirit battle fruit you shall
[1:51:04] know hey now
[1:51:07] you say brother brandy we should we
[1:51:09] speak with tongues absolutely that's
[1:51:11] gifts of God but those gifts of God
[1:51:14] without these virtues in them it makes
[1:51:17] us total block to the unbeliever it's
[1:51:20] not accepted by God
[1:51:22] this has to be first then when you have
[1:51:24] faith virtue knowledge temperance
[1:51:26] patience godliness and Brotherhood up
[1:51:29] then the Holy Ghost come down and see
[1:51:31] you as a unit as soon as he steals the
[1:51:36] church ages as unit the way he makes
[1:51:38] this bride is the way you make this
[1:51:40] individual may our same material like
[1:51:44] Eve was made out of animal rib from the
[1:51:47] side here is the things that you have to
[1:51:50] have first you can't impersonate them
[1:51:54] you can't imitate them they've got to be
[1:51:56] God said and God formed imitation only
[1:52:01] causes confusion it's like I said could
[1:52:04] you imagine seeing a buzzard sitting
[1:52:06] there with a dull feather stuck these
[1:52:08] wings they stammered up he's not a dog
[1:52:11] he's a buzzard vulture could you imagine
[1:52:14] a black Berber the peacock feather in
[1:52:16] his wings as they see that's coming he's
[1:52:19] sucking but it has to come from the
[1:52:23] inside out and produces Christianity God
[1:52:29] by the power of the Holy Spirit our
[1:52:33] sister had her feet wet when she got the
[1:52:35] bottom all of us know sister Sheppard to
[1:52:38] be a charitable her house is open her
[1:52:41] brother I don't care if it's a boom
[1:52:43] better water it is they'll feed him do
[1:52:45] anything they can to help him along
[1:52:47] Oh God accepted that her found
[1:52:50] nation part and here's not get decision
[1:52:54] here is what's wrong with the with the
[1:52:58] our journal for this here's what's wrong
[1:53:01] with a random camera you see there is
[1:53:05] two different kinds of fate there's two
[1:53:08] different times of virtue as I had the
[1:53:10] other day two different kinds of
[1:53:12] knowledge two different kinds of
[1:53:13] temperance one thing just probation you
[1:53:15] got that is the kind of temperance that
[1:53:17] God's talking about that ungodly
[1:53:20] uncontrollable tipper you got me
[1:53:22] now that's time that's back but patience
[1:53:25] and so forth there's a mockery of it of
[1:53:28] pretending to be on nature giving faith
[1:53:32] on nature giving virtue there's a nature
[1:53:36] given difference all these things on
[1:53:39] nature given and the biggest part of our
[1:53:43] faith is mental thing
[1:53:47] by hearing the word we brings us to a
[1:53:50] mimic recognition of God but if this
[1:53:55] coming from above
[1:53:57] yeah oh brother if it ever strike this
[1:54:00] there is a godly spiritual peace then
[1:54:07] what does that face do that face
[1:54:11] recognizes only the word no matter what
[1:54:16] anything else says it only recognizes
[1:54:18] the word because in the beginning was
[1:54:20] the word and the words with God and the
[1:54:22] Word was God and the words still God and
[1:54:25] the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:54:27] it and when the word itself is pouring
[1:54:29] into our faith our middle faith becomes
[1:54:33] a spiritual revelation
[1:54:39] Oh a builder my church yeah not upon a
[1:54:44] middle conception of church joining a
[1:54:47] middle consecutive that but all their
[1:54:50] regulation when them streams of grace is
[1:54:54] pouring for that minimum fee that you've
[1:54:56] got oh this is spiritual relation how
[1:55:02] build my church there's a gates of hell
[1:55:05] can't prevent it against it mmm city
[1:55:07] this shows they would be against it but
[1:55:10] I'll never prevail
[1:55:11] oh what a glorious thing now seeing the
[1:55:17] faith these five streams I had a piece
[1:55:19] of chalk here but I guess you never
[1:55:21] brought it down but the five streams you
[1:55:24] see coming out through here tippers this
[1:55:26] together it's been the Holy Spirit that
[1:55:30] made the emphasis Church there's the
[1:55:32] Holy Spirit that's birth the Sumerian
[1:55:35] church the Holy Spirit that gives a
[1:55:38] pergamus Church and the thought Tyra
[1:55:40] Church in the dark ages
[1:55:42] it's a Holy Spirit that's built that
[1:55:47] it's pulled out of all the organization
[1:55:50] systems down through ages like then
[1:55:53] there's our elected a predestinated
[1:55:56] bride of Jesus Christ that the Holy
[1:56:00] Spirit is called out of the Elain
[1:56:02] and spit the Holy Ghost in this a steady
[1:56:05] steady
[1:56:06] backpack that our two top Emma the Holy
[1:56:10] Spirit then I have been the individual
[1:56:13] sees virtues and your knowledge and
[1:56:15] tempers is added to our faith then when
[1:56:18] the caps don't come the Holy Spirit he
[1:56:21] meant sit together amen
[1:56:24] there's the Baptist of the Holy Spirit
[1:56:26] that's right your short today right let
[1:56:30] me see here I got some text row down
[1:56:32] here let's see I had a picture drawn
[1:56:35] here for her dream
[1:56:37] you can't see it from there now coming
[1:56:40] from the Holy Spirit
[1:56:42] why does Jung then he will give to you
[1:56:45] supernatural faith spiritual faith
[1:56:50] that here is the violence then sets
[1:56:53] spiritual faith recognizes only the
[1:56:56] water no matter what anybody else says
[1:57:00] they don't they don't do the good that
[1:57:02] only knows the word but somebody say the
[1:57:05] days of miracles is fast that faith only
[1:57:07] knows the word somebody says he no such
[1:57:10] name is the baptism the Holy Ghost that
[1:57:11] faith only knows or that's real
[1:57:14] spiritual thing you see that's right see
[1:57:16] it only knows the world
[1:57:18] name that was number one number one
[1:57:21] coming to you you're a middle page right
[1:57:24] here comes the Holy Spirit coming down
[1:57:27] into your middle faith make me the
[1:57:29] spiritual faith in the spiritual faith
[1:57:30] only recognizes the word now number two
[1:57:34] three then you have spiritual you be has
[1:57:38] a holy spirit and will seal all of these
[1:57:42] things into you as that only spirit
[1:57:45] covers this from your face up to the
[1:57:48] Holy Spirit filled you in with Christ
[1:57:50] and then you become Allah open your arms
[1:57:59] you become one see you and Christ
[1:58:04] Ava live together as that day you rolled
[1:58:08] it on in the father the father me I knew
[1:58:11] and you and me then that's a sealed unit
[1:58:17] of the Lord God now and then they are
[1:58:22] vindicated and placed when that time
[1:58:25] takes place they become vindicated sons
[1:58:29] and daughters of God
[1:58:31] do you remember over in the book of
[1:58:34] Matthew the 17th chapter the first to
[1:58:38] the fifth verse Jesus on that
[1:58:40] Transfiguration you've heard here you
[1:58:43] him that's serving I just here about a
[1:58:45] year ago freeze that comes to a popper
[1:58:47] here you him the placing of a son in
[1:58:50] Ephesians 1:5 also God has predestinated
[1:58:54] us not the adoption of son see a family
[1:58:57] when a son is born into it is
[1:58:59] man but that son had tutors to raise it
[1:59:04] and if that son never did come to the to
[1:59:07] be the right kind of a son he never
[1:59:08] become error but if he was the right son
[1:59:12] and the son that would obey his father
[1:59:15] then that son was adopted or placed
[1:59:20] positioning he'd become heir what the
[1:59:23] father had and that's what God was doing
[1:59:26] on my Transfiguration when he took his
[1:59:29] own son actually had been proven to be
[1:59:32] the right son he has stood all
[1:59:35] temptations he took him up on that
[1:59:37] Transfiguration and over shouting youth
[1:59:40] in the old testament they took his son
[1:59:41] resting in a nice pretty garment and
[1:59:44] setting out before the public and they
[1:59:46] had a ceremony of placing or we call it
[1:59:48] adopting and glaciers airplanes they
[1:59:51] call refer students adopting son yes now
[1:59:53] but placing a son ministers will
[1:59:56] understand and spiritual Bible readers a
[2:00:00] placing this son in other words the son
[2:00:03] was the son when he was born
[2:00:04] that's where our Pentecostal people made
[2:00:07] their mistakes being born into the
[2:00:09] family by the Holy Ghost that's right
[2:00:12] but then we must be the right kind of
[2:00:16] children tutored by the right tutor even
[2:00:19] Sita if a man back in your age thought
[2:00:23] affirmed his son he wanted to be a right
[2:00:26] kind of son he got the best tutor he
[2:00:28] could find the best teacher because he
[2:00:30] wanted his son to come up to the artist
[2:00:32] and see so he got the right tutor now if
[2:00:36] a man were to think of the best tutor
[2:00:38] how about God our Father I he never got
[2:00:42] bishops and Cardinals and priests he got
[2:00:44] the Holy Ghost to be our tutor and the
[2:00:48] Holy Spirit is our teacher
[2:00:50] Haddy he's in the church and he takes
[2:00:54] message to the Father and then what if
[2:00:57] the father the tutor come up sit well
[2:00:59] father I ain't go to get some kind of
[2:01:02] tutor that wants a straw in his head -
[2:01:04] no offender we call it say aha tell the
[2:01:06] father something other little boys are
[2:01:07] renegade anyhow but if I tell the father
[2:01:09] the father will give me a raise that is
[2:01:11] the right
[2:01:12] attitude er a right kind of tutors asked
[2:01:15] tell the truth then the holy ghost tells
[2:01:17] the truth when he comes before God you
[2:01:18] up yeah
[2:01:20] so he comes up why do you think he'd
[2:01:21] blushed today to see your daughters are
[2:01:24] all cut their hair we control them hey
[2:01:26] your sons are so organized minded they
[2:01:30] just let the pc-12 the Heather Knutson
[2:01:32] and they're adopting this for this and
[2:01:34] this for that hi must blush but how that
[2:01:37] tutor would love to comes to old huh
[2:01:39] that sons a real son he's just like the
[2:01:42] father oh how I'd love to say that see
[2:01:44] then the father swell dot and pride says
[2:01:46] this is my son that's exactly what God's
[2:01:49] doing
[2:01:49] oh not Transfiguration hey no it's that
[2:01:51] fear opposes it elijah and fear all
[2:01:54] excited the supernatural has done the
[2:01:56] peter got excited status field three
[2:01:58] Tabernacles one for you and one for
[2:01:59] Moses one for a while he was yet
[2:02:01] speaking God shut up he said this is my
[2:02:07] beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased
[2:02:10] cheri him see God put himself in the
[2:02:14] background and this is my son Moses
[2:02:18] represent the law the prophets rested
[2:02:20] represent is justice we could not
[2:02:23] realize lawful
[2:02:24] we cannot minimize justice I don't miss
[2:02:28] just as I want mercy I can't keep it all
[2:02:32] and I'll take me to justice but I need
[2:02:35] his mercy and God check those all if
[2:02:39] justice has been met in him he's here
[2:02:45] that's him that's the one now in the Old
[2:02:48] Testament well that son was adopted or
[2:02:51] placed into the family his name was just
[2:02:53] as good over check as his daddy's one
[2:02:55] huh yes sir
[2:02:57] they didn't have a head a ring and he's
[2:02:59] a science city and it spit on it place
[2:03:03] it that was a sickness
[2:03:05] that was justice he wore his daddy's
[2:03:06] dream his signet
[2:03:09] and that was just as good as his dead
[2:03:11] man now when Jesus had been obedient
[2:03:16] Jesus took our God places
[2:03:21] this is him now with the member is
[2:03:25] followed by the holy ghost into the
[2:03:27] family of God and it's proven the heavy
[2:03:30] right using the God can see virtue
[2:03:35] knowledge tempers patience brotherly
[2:03:38] kindness and godliness
[2:03:39] he then God feels he more places he ever
[2:03:45] there that's when you see the sons and
[2:03:48] daughters of God then Ephesians 4:30
[2:03:52] says grieve not the Holy Spirit of God

[2:06:16] in you by God then your seal then
[2:06:19] there's no put on a balance you're just
[2:06:21] yourself
[2:06:22] that's when vision perfect Holy Spirit
[2:06:28] works of God everything is made manifest
[2:06:31] because why you and Christ become one a
[2:06:35] I hope that's understood you in Christ
[2:06:39] be come on I had something else a head
[2:06:40] roll down here I want to think of brings
[2:06:43] us to the place of life then you become
[2:06:46] have eternal life now got the Greek
[2:06:51] election unum the emphatic die Glocke I
[2:06:55] studied in the day of the word not in
[2:06:58] John 14 or John 3:16 we find more places
[2:07:02] have everlasting life
[2:07:04] another place that says have eternal
[2:07:06] life but in the Greek and the Greek
[2:07:09] version in the Hebrew it says life
[2:07:12] without end in the Greek word has a ah
[2:07:17] in AH a in almost like a on a on is a
[2:07:24] space that's heavy as a number that
[2:07:28] can't be number just beyond ministry
[2:07:30] opinion but this is a audience of time
[2:07:34] eternal and the English word part is
[2:07:39] we orders eternal a onion our life
[2:07:43] without in C and if you got life without
[2:07:48] you how can you perish you have become a
[2:07:53] part of the eternal and there's only one
[2:07:55] thing eternal sex is not eternal
[2:07:58] no he becomes Satan hell is not eternal
[2:08:03] hell was created is not eternal and
[2:08:07] these bodies are not eternal they were
[2:08:10] created but the Spirit of God is eternal
[2:08:14] it never had a beginning our it never
[2:08:17] has an end and the only way we could
[2:08:18] have eternal life from that Greek word
[2:08:20] Zoe which means God's own life we have
[2:08:23] read the company part of God when we
[2:08:27] become sons and daughters of God and we
[2:08:30] have a body enough so the positives us
[2:08:34] that recognizes this word from here to
[2:08:37] there that recognizes is a Audion life
[2:08:39] life without in it God yeah
[2:08:43] amen the other day on the trip I had a
[2:08:49] discussion did you hold a witness not no
[2:08:52] disregard anybody's believe we got
[2:08:55] plenty of em in convert sitting here
[2:08:57] from Jehovah Witness one of our trustees
[2:08:59] the Church of Jehovah Witness wasp and
[2:09:02] what saved him and his family's father
[2:09:03] was a reader from the woods and that all
[2:09:06] of us brothers and sisters now not
[2:09:07] always come in receive the Holy Ghost
[2:09:09] because of the visions of God tell them
[2:09:12] what they did and what they see had done
[2:09:14] it now but here Jehovah Witness in there
[2:09:19] look it says that the breath that you
[2:09:24] breathe in the soul now that cannot be
[2:09:29] right the breath that you breathe is not
[2:09:33] solely if it is your your one time your
[2:09:35] one kind of soul next time you're
[2:09:37] somebody else's breathe that soul look
[2:09:38] where you be now the breath is wind and
[2:09:43] wind is what you breathe into your
[2:09:46] nostrils now they take the scripture
[2:09:49] from back and God breathe breath
[2:09:52] nostril and he became a living soul now
[2:09:57] I want to ask you something if he was a
[2:10:00] man what kind of a breath was he
[2:10:03] breathing before God breathed his breath
[2:10:05] of life into man see what kind of bread
[2:10:10] is a breathing living man well then if
[2:10:13] that be so then every animal is a living
[2:10:17] soul cause they breathe a human soul in
[2:10:19] our soul in Oregon then Jesus wouldn't
[2:10:21] had to die their animal sacrifice of
[2:10:23] insufficient see so brother the argument
[2:10:30] don't stand but what God did he breathes
[2:10:34] a breath I'll teach her life a living
[2:10:43] soul a soul I can't die huh watch now
[2:10:49] we're gonna get into honey pump to your
[2:10:51] elbows
[2:10:52] hey don't breathe a breath of eternal
[2:10:56] life into his nostrils and he became an
[2:11:00] eternal soul
[2:11:02] Oh God breathe not what nature done but
[2:11:07] what God did breathe a breath of life
[2:11:10] into his nostrils and he become a living
[2:11:12] soul then you say to me Adam died
[2:11:15] brother branham but remember before
[2:11:25] those who he foreknew he is call ya got
[2:11:29] a lamb Jerry demon he was a type and him
[2:11:34] fell then the lamb was provided for Adam
[2:11:39] because already in his nostrils that
[2:11:41] become the breath of the eternal God and
[2:11:44] he become a living soul he was a son of
[2:11:47] God not his breath is the African word I
[2:11:53] don't know what the Greek word is at
[2:11:55] work right now but the African were to
[2:11:56] call amalia which means the winds an
[2:11:59] unseen force animal fries Amaya
[2:12:04] sinners dream a Moya then why would we
[2:12:07] struggle for eternal life if that's the
[2:12:09] eternal soul breathes into us by breath
[2:12:11] while they'll be struggle for eternal
[2:12:12] life if that fire spread see hits can't
[2:12:17] do it but God
[2:12:19] specially upon Adam breathe the breath
[2:12:23] of eternal life and he become an eternal
[2:12:26] person with God yeah my god

[2:27:10] is also in the branch I go to join that
[2:27:20] it can't I've seen a tree not all going
[2:27:24] brother share Jardin Arizona had nine
[2:27:26] different citrus fruit what was it it
[2:27:30] was a it was an orange stream a navel
[2:27:34] orange but it had a it had a lemon a
[2:27:37] tangerine a tangelo and a grapefruit it
[2:27:41] had all time I still have that tree
[2:27:44] looks I brush it can you tell me is that
[2:27:46] trees an orange tree sure how come I
[2:27:52] said I'd see grapefruit tangerine here
[2:27:55] tangelo here and lemon heard all these
[2:27:57] other priests how does it come he said
[2:27:59] well you see they're grafted in
[2:28:00] oh I said what I want to ask you
[2:28:03] something now you pick this grapefruit a
[2:28:04] lamb it off now I'm next year it will
[2:28:07] rot it will come forth then with a
[2:28:09] orange out that order said it come forth
[2:28:12] from the lemon see you can't do that you
[2:28:22] can't join in but he said every time
[2:28:25] that that tree gets a year old it puts
[2:28:27] out a new branch it comes worse as
[2:28:29] oranges if the vine itself puts out the
[2:28:34] bridge and what we've tried to do is the
[2:28:37] jon memmer's into him and we live on
[2:28:40] name of Christianity because we are as
[2:28:42] it's in a common way of saying we're the
[2:28:45] citrus fruit the Christian Church but
[2:28:48] when the vine itself puts forth the vine
[2:28:50] it'll be like the first body's put forth
[2:28:52] if the first vine is put forth they
[2:28:55] wrote a book of Acts behind it if it
[2:28:57] ever puts forth another one you'll write
[2:28:59] a book outside right so you're only
[2:29:02] joining lodges but when you're born out
[2:29:06] of line you got a fruit that's right you
[2:29:10] got a simple what do you do with it you
[2:29:11] have a form of godliness and deny the
[2:29:13] power their Holy Ghost you're not
[2:29:19] speaking in tongues you develop visions
[2:29:21] you do not prophesy you did not healing
[2:29:23] and yet call yourself a name no wonder
[2:29:26] the Holy Ghost said a power of a groups
[2:29:30] of people full of blasphemous names
[2:29:34] calling themselves Christian with forms
[2:29:37] of godliness but denying the power there
[2:29:40] are from such turn away for this as a
[2:29:43] sword that they'd silly women laden with
[2:29:45] divers lust all kinds of organizations
[2:29:48] the church is packing so much of this
[2:29:50] kind of society in that conversation
[2:29:52] what about the Society of Jesus Christ
[2:29:55] think we have all these other things and
[2:29:58] we burden the church down now there you
[2:30:02] are you never can join a church you join
[2:30:05] a lodge
[2:30:06] you're a member of a large of a group of
[2:30:10] people just like a lot of this we
[2:30:11] believe in this we have our orders we
[2:30:13] have our secrecy and so forth you do the
[2:30:15] same way on your honor
[2:30:16] so cultures but you cannot join church
[2:30:20] you join the lodge of members but not a
[2:30:25] church for you are born into that church
[2:30:28] and go by yourself down wait a minute
[2:30:31] Wow I'll close God can't we just ride
[2:30:43] together with that spirit yeah then it
[2:30:46] tapers in a vigil together with that hey
[2:30:49] man see then you were born into that
[2:30:53] Kingdom and there's a various life that
[2:30:56] was in this churches in that church and
[2:30:58] back back back and the variant life that
[2:31:01] was in the hall the vine Jesus isn't a
[2:31:05] member hey hey boy the same things I do
[2:31:14] hey there's the truth member of the know
[2:31:22] comedy testament of how the brain works
[2:31:25] for that individual proofs where he came
[2:31:28] there's life justifies what he is are
[2:31:31] you what never what body you belong to
[2:31:33] the body Christ
[2:31:35] well did you Jordan I didn't house
[2:31:37] before today hey I was born in it you
[2:31:41] don't have to tell him they know what's
[2:31:43] happened
[2:31:43] you're just how can you a lot of cameras
[2:31:45] put a bushel over he said no no when
[2:31:48] you're born into that kingdom of God
[2:31:51] then the life the very life that was in
[2:31:54] Jesus then you're interested in souls
[2:31:57] then you don't have to beg people come
[2:31:59] to the altar you don't have to beg for
[2:32:01] somebody come seek with those are at the
[2:32:03] on earth the faintest automatically flow
[2:32:06] because it's seer opinion hey you are a
[2:32:11] unit of God your seal with the Holy
[2:32:14] Ghost now do you know what the Holy
[2:32:16] Ghost means don't means I jumped up and
[2:32:19] shouted I had a strange feeling that was
[2:32:21] alright I've jumped up and shouted head
[2:32:23] strange feeling I spoke and on the topic
[2:32:25] the Holy Ghost speaks in tongues sure
[2:32:26] I've interpreted yes sir I believe that
[2:32:29] too but that even is that is what I'm
[2:32:31] talking about they can be a leak up here
[2:32:34] somewhere there could be a leak here in
[2:32:36] your patient that somebody smite you
[2:32:39] once on the face do you turn together
[2:32:40] but you said that dirty hypocrite
[2:32:43] then there's a leak somewhere scruffy
[2:32:49] all right but you know what I mean but
[2:32:52] when you're sealed you do the body of
[2:32:55] Christ and you're a spirit-filled and
[2:32:59] your son of God oh I thought for another
[2:33:20] two or three or four pages amen
[2:33:23] get the message goes on to page 46 45
[2:33:27] sorry so we we finished up page 37
[2:33:32] but again all I can continue on but the
[2:33:37] power of God said I'll be about 10
[2:33:39] minutes but he went a little longer than
[2:33:41] 10 minutes I can understand that when
[2:33:43] you get into the end of the world
[2:33:45] amen and as a minister as a servant of
[2:33:49] God it's when you get into it it's hard
[2:33:51] to get out of it
[2:33:52] amen because the anointing is still
[2:33:54] there to keep moving on praise God for
[2:33:58] the word thank God for the revelation of
[2:34:00] the word I pray grace O Lord that you'll
[2:34:03] that it'll be seat on the inside and
[2:34:05] amen we water it with more of the word
[2:34:08] more the word amen and it's going to
[2:34:10] it's going to be man made flesh in you
[2:34:12] and in me so that that's good he said do
[2:34:16] you know what the Holy Ghost means it
[2:34:18] don't mean I jumped up and shouted I had
[2:34:20] a strange feeling that's all right
[2:34:22] he's I jumped up and shouted and had
[2:34:24] strange feelings I spoke in tongues I
[2:34:26] believe the Holy Ghost speaks in tongues
[2:34:28] I've interpreted and so on he said but
[2:34:31] that isn't what I'm talking about there
[2:34:33] can be a leak here somewhere there can
[2:34:35] be a leak there he said in your patience
[2:34:37] let somebody smite you on one side of
[2:34:39] the face do you turn the other amen
[2:34:42] it's a challenge you can have the gifts
[2:34:45] of the Spirit but still not have the
[2:34:46] life of the Spirit amen if you got the
[2:34:49] Holy Ghost in your soul you're going to
[2:34:51] turn the other cheek
[2:34:52] amen but if you don't have the Holy
[2:34:54] Ghost in your soul you can have it in
[2:34:56] your flesh as it were and if someone
[2:34:58] smoked you on the Wonder
[2:34:59] the right cheek you won't turn the other
[2:35:01] you'll smite them they met you you want
[2:35:05] to spite them and we get remembered
[2:35:07] again when I would naturally physically
[2:35:09] swipe beat somebody on the cheek it
[2:35:11] might be something you say about them
[2:35:13] and so on and to somebody else so and if
[2:35:17] they hear it well they could turn around
[2:35:19] say some of you oh no oh you're thinking
[2:35:22] so brother-sister we've got to have a
[2:35:25] right spirit and a right attitude and
[2:35:27] the right spirit and the right attitude
[2:35:28] is Holy Ghost they may and it's not just
[2:35:31] you know Nia again in our flesh and not
[2:35:33] the none in our heads but it's in our
[2:35:36] souls it's on the inside of the inside
[2:35:39] if God is dealing with any part of us
[2:35:41] it's a it's the soul a man and if you're
[2:35:44] born again you're born again on the
[2:35:46] inside of the insight not that this this
[2:35:49] robe of flesh shall drop and rice and
[2:35:51] sees the everlasting price and show
[2:35:55] while passing through the air farewell
[2:35:57] farewell sweet hour of prayer amen
[2:35:59] because we're going to that we're going
[2:36:01] to get rid of this old fleshly body and
[2:36:03] we're going to get a glorious body like
[2:36:05] unto his glorious body
[2:36:07] it's glorified body and brother Ram goes
[2:36:10] on and he said oh I wish I just had
[2:36:12] about 10 minutes to read something here
[2:36:14] he said would you bear with me he said
[2:36:17] for another 10 minutes and he went on
[2:36:19] and I assumed that they went on into the
[2:36:22] communion service after just think how
[2:36:25] in half preaching and then the communion
[2:36:27] but he referred reference description
[2:36:30] there was a man of the Pharisees named
[2:36:32] Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews and the
[2:36:36] same came therefore to Jesus by night
[2:36:38] and said unto Him rabbi we know that
[2:36:41] thou art a teacher from come from God
[2:36:43] for no man can do these miracles that
[2:36:45] God be with him and he said see them
[2:36:49] sented rien courts they recognized that
[2:36:51] he was the son of God they knew it and
[2:36:53] here was their ruler right there telling
[2:36:56] him we know that you're a teacher from
[2:36:58] God and so on the very life of God is
[2:37:01] flowing through you we know that you
[2:37:03] your teaching is not of your own it's of
[2:37:07] God God is proving it the life of God
[2:37:10] flowing through it and jesus answered
[2:37:12] and said
[2:37:13] earlier I say unto you except a man be
[2:37:15] born again he cannot see the kingdom of
[2:37:18] God amen and that was a mystery to
[2:37:23] Nicodemus email and he said how can a
[2:37:27] man be born again he said well he
[2:37:30] entered the second time into his
[2:37:31] mother's womb no he said you're born of
[2:37:34] the flesh is flesh but you gotta be born
[2:37:36] of the Spirit born of the baptism of the
[2:37:40] Holy Ghost the Baptist little ghost is a
[2:37:42] new birth a man and he said jesus said
[2:37:45] Marvel not that I said unto you ye must
[2:37:47] be born again
[2:37:49] and how many believers are born again
[2:37:50] how many believers got the new nature
[2:37:52] now in their souls controlling them
[2:37:56] controlling their their in their lives
[2:37:58] controlling their thoughts controlling
[2:38:00] their motives and their objectives it's
[2:38:02] the new nature now it's not the old
[2:38:04] nature as I said the old nature that is
[2:38:07] thinking in favor of the flesh well I
[2:38:09] got to do this I want to do this I want
[2:38:11] to do that because you feel it's going
[2:38:13] to be best for your for your physical
[2:38:14] being but no if you're born again you're
[2:38:18] going to do that which is missed where
[2:38:19] you spiritually amen what is the will of
[2:38:22] God Lord for me to do what do you want
[2:38:24] me to do where do you want me to go how
[2:38:26] do you want me to do it when do you want
[2:38:27] me to do it it's it's what God wants not
[2:38:30] my will father
[2:38:32] don't be done but again many so-called
[2:38:35] believers many so-called Christians
[2:38:37] they're out there to just doing what
[2:38:39] they feel to do to profit them spirit
[2:38:41] and then a spirit or a bus physically
[2:38:43] all this is this will be good for me
[2:38:45] physically this be good for me naturally
[2:38:46] this it could be good for me financially
[2:38:48] well they've got nothing to do with it
[2:38:50] what if what about your spiritual being
[2:38:52] a man you got it you go to make your
[2:38:55] calling and election sure but making
[2:38:57] sure you're in the spirit filled with
[2:38:59] the Holy Ghost baptized with the Holy
[2:39:01] Ghost in your soul you're not
[2:39:03] experiencing God in your flesh not
[2:39:05] experiencing God in your heads it's
[2:39:07] experiencing God in your soul on the
[2:39:10] inside of the inside a man you've got a
[2:39:13] lot of well the vast majority of
[2:39:15] Christians today and it's becoming that
[2:39:17] way around the message the vast majority
[2:39:19] of believers today they're living
[2:39:21] according to the to the flesh they're
[2:39:24] living according to or what they the
[2:39:25] physical person
[2:39:26] the the physical part of the field is
[2:39:29] the best and all this would be good for
[2:39:31] me this would be good for me but again
[2:39:34] your soul or your flesh are you looking
[2:39:38] for natural prosperity or spiritual
[2:39:41] prosperity a male if you're born again
[2:39:44] in your soul you're looking for
[2:39:47] spiritual prosperity and Lord attended
[2:39:50] college why should I care
[2:39:52] they're building a mansion for me over
[2:39:54] there built like that Briard that
[2:39:56] brothers say years ago and I no doubt I
[2:39:58] might have to tape somewhere where he
[2:40:00] preached and he said the biggest lies
[2:40:02] told are told in church and that's the
[2:40:05] truth and he mentioned that song he said
[2:40:08] a Tanner at college why should I care
[2:40:09] but he said most do what he said they're
[2:40:12] building a mansion for me over there cuz
[2:40:14] most want this they want that deny
[2:40:16] satisfy what a tender a cottage no no
[2:40:19] they don't have that attitude if you got
[2:40:20] the Holy Ghost you do you don't care
[2:40:22] whatever God wants that's that's fine
[2:40:25] with me it's fine with you by the grace
[2:40:27] of God oh yeah
[2:40:28] death to me those with that attitude and
[2:40:31] their spirit brother that's the ones
[2:40:33] that are ordained for the rapture that's
[2:40:35] right because they're focusing on the
[2:40:37] spiritual not the natural you're spoken
[2:40:40] focusing on the eternal not the temporal
[2:40:43] so brother I pray God that we're born by
[2:40:46] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[2:40:49] nature that controls us is the nature of
[2:40:51] God the nature that controls us the
[2:40:53] nature of Jesus Christ in us we're going
[2:40:56] to do what he wants us to do when when
[2:40:59] he wants us to do it ow he wants us to
[2:41:00] do it where he wants us to do it it's
[2:41:02] all we want to glorify him give him the
[2:41:05] glory the honor and the praise to God be
[2:41:09] the glory
[2:41:10] so he said Marvel not that I said unto
[2:41:13] you you must be born again the wind
[2:41:15] blows where it listed and he said the
[2:41:18] winds he said thou canst not hear the
[2:41:21] sound thereof cannot tell whence it came
[2:41:25] where it goin
[2:41:26] he says so is everyone that's born of
[2:41:29] the Spirit
[2:41:30] you don't live the a life to this
[2:41:34] understanding to those over there no I
[2:41:36] thank God for the baptism of the Holy
[2:41:40] Ghost I thank God for the time when I
[2:41:42] was born again a man and you went out
[2:41:44] and you put the end of Sunday as the
[2:41:46] emphases on that and and people even
[2:41:48] even Christians looked at you what are
[2:41:51] you doing that for
[2:41:52] what are you doing this one why did you
[2:41:53] why did you do this why don't you do
[2:41:54] this no I said whatever God wants me to
[2:41:56] do that's what I want to do and wherever
[2:41:59] God wants me to be it's what I asked was
[2:42:01] but I want a man not my will father
[2:42:04] don't be done most to say that
[2:42:07] spiritually to believe this doctrine and
[2:42:09] that doctrine but I'm many going to say
[2:42:10] that for their for their for the life
[2:42:12] thing God wants them to live for the job
[2:42:15] well God wants you to have for the
[2:42:17] education God wants you to have are you
[2:42:21] govern are you governed by the Lord and
[2:42:22] the Holy Ghost or is it is it your own
[2:42:24] natural physical desires god help us
[2:42:29] amen so brother Nicodemus did say to him
[2:42:36] how can these things be and jesus said
[2:42:38] unto Him art thou a master of Israel and
[2:42:40] don't know these things and he said
[2:42:43] verily I say unto you he said we speak
[2:42:46] that we do know and testify that which
[2:42:48] we have seen and you receive not our
[2:42:51] witness you can receive the word you're
[2:42:56] gonna believe the word is is preached or
[2:42:58] just filtered out filter out yes well I
[2:43:02] don't agree with it I don't really
[2:43:03] filter that him no they golf he'll throw
[2:43:07] your life hey not you filtering not you
[2:43:11] but let God do it a man he say I've told
[2:43:16] you earthly things and you believe not
[2:43:18] how sure you believe if I tell you
[2:43:20] evidently things amen
[2:43:26] and if you're a Christian you focus more
[2:43:28] under heavenly and less under earthly
[2:43:31] more on the spiritual unless under
[2:43:33] natural amen
[2:43:37] so he said if I told you earthly things
[2:43:40] you believe not I was are you sure you
[2:43:42] believe if I tell you evenly things he
[2:43:44] said figure that out he should you know
[2:43:48] one time what think you of Christ a new
[2:43:50] son is he
[2:43:51] and they said the son of David and so on
[2:43:54] so he goes on to challenge the fate of
[2:43:57] random tavern echo and is challenging
[2:44:00] the faith of all believers
[2:44:01] Amen or do we have intellectual faith do
[2:44:05] we have the faith in our heads or is it
[2:44:07] faith in our souls if it's faith in our
[2:44:10] heads we control the faith if it's faith
[2:44:12] in our souls the faith controls us amen
[2:44:15] so I pray God that we have faith in our
[2:44:19] souls but but have you in the decisions
[2:44:22] you have made and you consulted the Lord
[2:44:25] in the decisions you make do you talk to
[2:44:29] the Lord about a purse nor what's your
[2:44:31] will what do you want me to do lord I
[2:44:33] don't care what it is in all thy ways
[2:44:37] acknowledge him and he will direct your
[2:44:40] paths no most people make their own
[2:44:43] decisions for this especially natural
[2:44:45] things they make their own decisions
[2:44:46] they don't consult the Lord grace to us
[2:44:50] that's why there's gonna be very very
[2:44:52] few going the rapture that there's not
[2:44:55] many not many consulting the Lord giving
[2:44:59] preimage to the Lord because brother if
[2:45:02] we're going to give premise to the
[2:45:03] natural person we're gonna miss the
[2:45:05] rapture because the rapture the rapture
[2:45:07] is getting pre MS to the spiritual the
[2:45:09] new creature in Christ by the grace of
[2:45:11] God amen
[2:45:14] so are we are we are you do you feel
[2:45:17] that you're a new creature of Christ do
[2:45:19] you feel that you're born again a son
[2:45:22] daughter of God amen
[2:45:24] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost so that
[2:45:29] totally now in my heart my soul my mind
[2:45:31] everything I I just consult the Lord I
[2:45:34] put everything in the hands of God Lord
[2:45:36] not my will dine me never an hour the
[2:45:40] bright will come to that place it's this
[2:45:42] hour amen for the resurrection and the
[2:45:45] rapture and there'll be nobody else
[2:45:48] going only those that are going to pray
[2:45:50] that prayer not my will don't be done oh
[2:45:53] yes it's going to be it's going to be
[2:45:56] difficult for us to a certain extent but
[2:45:59] he'll send his angel to encourage us to
[2:46:01] strengthen us oh yeah the angel came and
[2:46:04] ministered to Jesus
[2:46:05] just think of that angel came to
[2:46:07] minister that flesh to encourage it and
[2:46:10] he cried out not my will thine be done
[2:46:13] so the angel comes and I believe God
[2:46:15] sent his angel to encourage us in the
[2:46:18] revealed Word a man so god help us
[2:46:21] brothers to stay with the word give
[2:46:24] preeminence to the word there with me
[2:46:29] and he said but let me give you this
[2:46:31] first climax where does all these things
[2:46:34] come from that I have showed you and he
[2:46:37] said I said here they are they are in
[2:46:41] the Word of God
[2:46:42] it is thus saith the Lord and I said all
[2:46:45] you bear bear me record witness this
[2:46:48] that my commission is stay with the word
[2:46:51] and I said what's the matter with all of
[2:46:53] you
[2:46:54] can't you understand the word you must
[2:46:56] understand the word and he said I put
[2:47:00] the climax to them and told them that
[2:47:02] the things that they have seen me do is
[2:47:05] found in the word every bit of it in the
[2:47:08] word because I am commissioned to do
[2:47:11] those things he said all background it
[2:47:15] on the word then this great marvelous
[2:47:17] climax grace brothers bringing the bride
[2:47:22] to a climax of eternity amen
[2:47:36] he said the shadows are closer to end he
[2:47:39] said be on your gird for the time will
[2:47:42] come when they will not endure sound
[2:47:43] doctrine but after their own lusts shall
[2:47:46] they heap to themselves teachers having
[2:47:47] itching ears amen
[2:47:50] they turn from the truth unto fables
[2:47:54] we're living in that hour and he said
[2:47:57] all man has turned against me there's no
[2:48:00] man with me he said Paul said even demas
[2:48:03] has forsaken me loving this present
[2:48:06] world a man and many a believers going
[2:48:09] to forsake that the true Ministry
[2:48:11] because they love this present world
[2:48:14] amen let me finish with I'll just read a
[2:48:18] few verses from 2nd Timothy 3 and he
[2:48:21] said this know also that in the last
[2:48:24] days perilous times shall come
[2:48:28] you and I are dealing with perilous
[2:48:30] times beyond your car be on your guard
[2:48:33] amen
[2:48:34] like I said it's so closer we deceive
[2:48:36] the very elect if possible and they
[2:48:40] didn't say that they're not lovers of
[2:48:41] God but they're lovers of their own
[2:48:44] selves that's true
[2:48:47] most everybody caught up with themselves
[2:48:49] and what they want to do how they want
[2:48:51] to do it when and where no it's got to
[2:48:53] be the Lord Easter they are covetous
[2:48:56] they are boasters they are proud they
[2:49:00] are blasphemers amen
[2:49:03] well blasphemous names they're
[2:49:07] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[2:49:09] unthankful unholy well last we missed
[2:49:13] names well that's the churches out there
[2:49:15] yeah but it's also doctrine people that
[2:49:19] I cut off with this cut up with that
[2:49:20] kind of was something else around the
[2:49:22] message to just get caught up with the
[2:49:24] message and not not just of us in the
[2:49:28] message that the message being you amen
[2:49:32] so I said disobedient to parents
[2:49:34] unthankful unholy amazing without
[2:49:39] natural affection trucebreakers false
[2:49:41] accusers
[2:49:43] incontinent fierce despisers of those
[2:49:46] that are good yeah god help us keep the
[2:49:53] right attitude in the right spirit
[2:49:54] they're going to despise those that are
[2:49:56] determined to stay with the world amen
[2:50:00] that despise those that are going out
[2:50:02] there and their spiritual they're not
[2:50:04] natural they're not religious they're
[2:50:06] spiritual they won't like them and since
[2:50:10] they are trade traders they are a heady
[2:50:12] there I minded know what that this is
[2:50:15] the truth if there's ever an hour of an
[2:50:18] age of people that our traders they're
[2:50:20] heading their high-minded and their
[2:50:23] lovers of pleasure more didn't say
[2:50:26] didn't not love God but their lovers of
[2:50:29] pleasure more than lovers of God they're
[2:50:33] giving preeminence to the natural things
[2:50:35] and less to the spiritual so it says
[2:50:40] they have a form of godliness amazing
[2:50:44] they have a form of godliness but
[2:50:46] they're denying the power thereof the
[2:50:49] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[2:50:52] and it says from such turn away amazing
[2:50:59] for of this sort are they which are
[2:51:02] crept into houses led captive silly
[2:51:05] women laden with sins led away with
[2:51:08] divers lusts and again when it comes to
[2:51:12] the loss she lust after the things of
[2:51:14] the world I'm not just talking about
[2:51:16] sexual these things
[2:51:17] the Bible's not just talking about that
[2:51:19] but lusting after the world and the
[2:51:21] things of the world oh we want to we
[2:51:25] want to break it down to just physical
[2:51:27] sexual losses and so on no no God looks
[2:51:31] at what you're hungry for what you're
[2:51:33] thirsting for naturally and there's many
[2:51:36] that are lusting after this part of the
[2:51:38] world that part of the world that part
[2:51:40] of the world yeah was why the prophet of
[2:51:43] God said you're gonna be surprised who
[2:51:44] made it who didn't make it you condemned
[2:51:47] that person out there oh they do this
[2:51:52] they do that or doing this they're doing
[2:51:54] that yeah
[2:51:57] their attitude might be better than our
[2:51:59] hours than yours and that's what gals
[2:52:04] looking at their heart so let's keep her
[2:52:09] attitude raiding our spirit around
[2:52:11] definitely and it says they are ever
[2:52:14] learning and never able to come to the
[2:52:18] knowledge of the truth never able to
[2:52:22] come to the revelation that God is
[2:52:25] pointing us to in the message of the
[2:52:28] hour and it's the revelation of the
[2:52:30] resurrection and the rapture and brother
[2:52:33] we got to let take the emphasis away
[2:52:35] from the natural put it more and more
[2:52:37] and more on the spiritual amen just
[2:52:42] think ever learning and never able to
[2:52:45] come to the knowledge of the truth so
[2:52:48] we're learning this we're learning that
[2:52:50] you've learned other things tonight
[2:52:52] through the Prophet but are we coming to
[2:52:54] the knowledge the correct and vital
[2:52:56] knowledge of the truth by the grace of
[2:53:00] God and as Janice and Jambres withstood
[2:53:04] Moses duties also resist the truth men
[2:53:08] of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning
[2:53:10] the faith but they shall proceed no
[2:53:12] further for their folly shall be
[2:53:15] manifest unto all men as theirs also was
[2:53:20] but thou has fully known my doctrine
[2:53:22] manner of life purpose faith
[2:53:25] long-suffering charity patience
[2:53:28] persecutions afflictions which came unto
[2:53:30] me at Antioch and Iconium and what
[2:53:34] persecutions I endured but out of them
[2:53:36] all the Lord delivered me and he said
[2:53:39] yea and all that lived will live godly
[2:53:42] will live godly in Christ Jesus shall
[2:53:45] suffer persecution a man
[2:53:48] Paul want the Lord to take this and take
[2:53:51] that but God said Paul my grace is
[2:53:54] sufficient for you Paul want the Lord to
[2:53:57] to improve his sight and so on because
[2:54:01] he was getting blind physically blind
[2:54:03] you know he says see with large letters
[2:54:06] I've written what because he couldn't
[2:54:08] see with the small letters
[2:54:10] we large letters I've written unto you
[2:54:12] and so on and he prayed to the Lord the
[2:54:14] Lord said Paul my grace is sufficient so
[2:54:17] the Lord never healed him of his of the
[2:54:19] veil his vision you didn't go on amen
[2:54:22] by the grace of God so brother we want
[2:54:25] God to do this we want God to do that no
[2:54:27] no not my real father
[2:54:29] don't be done Amen Lord if I'm going to
[2:54:33] endure this in all things be thankful
[2:54:35] all that live godly in Christ Jesus

[2:54:41] so this let's let's go forth living
[2:54:44] godly let's go for maybe living out the
[2:54:47] word and if we're persecuted to God be
[2:54:50] the glory amen
