claim those precious things heavenly father lord lord how it humbles us to see those words lord to sing it lord from a heart that knows that it was my sin that put you on that cross heavenly father lord and if everyone else in the world was perfect lord yet you had to die for my sin all because our price had to be paid and lord we're here tonight in commemoration of the price that you paid lord but not just the price that you paid lord but what you opened up when you paid that price lord the door that was opened lord the blessings that were released lord the placing that was given back to the believer if they'll only walk in faith lord by the grace that you've given so lord we want to say thank you tonight yes [Music] we could say it all day it'd never be enough amen lord we could write of your love from the rise and of the son to the going down of the same and we'd never run out of things to say but lord let us simply just say thank you amen lord may our lives be a thank you lord that resonates far beyond our words lord may our lives just reflect lord show appreciation lord show the effect of the price that you paid that day lord now minister through lord your servant this evening lord grant grace to the hearer to hear lord that your spirit will move powerfully among us to change our lives lord to draw us closer to you we pray lord remembering the many other services that will no doubt fire up this evening lord or remembering our youth that are at the camp in louisiana lord we pray especially for them lord but i know many services are going on this weekend lord may your holy spirit just draw in the lost lord may it sanctify us anew to your word lord may it fill us anew with your power lord that your life would live amongst us in a greater way that all could see it though we ask these things humbly in jesus name amen and amen god bless you man if you'll turn the scriptures to genesis chapter 2 and then genesis chapter 2 this evening as you're turning there it's uh been some time since i was up here somebody was asking me if i figured i'd remember how to do it i said i hope so amen but i just wanted to to say thank you for those certainly that that put the the time and effort into the special meetings while brother ed hammermeister was here i've talked to him many times since and he says his mind just keeps coming back to the weekend he had here and how much he enjoyed it and he just felt the kinship and the unity with the people here he he felt at home with us so that's uh that's the best thing i think that any ministry wants to hear is that people that come from other places that are believers are at home with us amen so i wanted to pass on not only my thanks and brother gerald's thanks for for those that attended and supported in in the services but also we had those that had a guest over that was unplanned maybe and and hosting fellowships and bringing meals and and doing all the things that you did so just thank you so much to each one of you that did that amen we will be having some special meetings in may also i discuss this with brother gerald a month or two ago and so we've got another minister coming in and we'll send out an announcement on that um soon with the details lord willing so amen genesis chapter two maybe a bit of an odd verse to start on easter weekend but uh but here goes nothing amen it says in the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil amen drop down to verse 16 it says in the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die let's turn ahead to genesis chapter 3 and verse 22 and the lord god said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life and then god bless his word you may be seated this evening amen it's uh you know it's a commemorative weekend you know and we're we're certainly dwelling on the last few days of the life of christ and the events that happened over that special weekend and as i said maybe a bit of a a weird scripture to start with but when you look at what put them on the cross it goes no further than genesis amen happened almost immediately that they fell and so i wanted to start from there to see why it put him on the cross and i have to say i was getting a little nervous on sunday when brother mark was speaking because he kept walking all over the two sermons that the lord has laid on my heart for this weekend but i'm just trusting that's god's affirmation god's confirmation amen that he has a thought that he wants to get to the people amen so i want to take a a sermon tonight of of a title of it is finished and this one's been on my heart literally since last easter so i've been dwelling on this for quite some time and and uh just felt that if brother joe would ask me to preach then this is the one that we would preach but it's certainly changed a lot over the year as i've been dwelling on it so just trusting that god is in it amen but it's a heavy day this evening when we look back at this day and in history whenever it was that that christ was killed amen it was uh it was a friday night and and he had gone through so many things in the in the previous day you know and he hadn't just gone through great moments with the disciples but he'd gone through some some harrowing moments he'd gone through pain he'd gone through agony even before it ever started in terms of the physical pain that he was going to go through and he was in the garden of gethsemane and he's he's sweating as it were great drops of blood that's the agony that's going through is it's literally transforming him physically inside the agony of knowing what's coming his way amen but i think it's harder on us because we think it's we remember that it's us that put him there amen as we were singing there that it was my sins that caused those bloodstains amen that put him on the cross that held him to the whipping post that made him stand in the hall as he was falsely accused by one after another after another to stand there the perfect lamb of god that had no sin and yet to stay there and keep silent the entire time because he had to pay a price for me and he had to pay a price for you amen and sister maureen's saying that song during the special meetings how it behooves us not to forget the price that was paid amen every single day when we're making decisions really it needs to run through the price of or the idea of was this what he paid the price for the way that i'm living my life the decision that i'm making the things that i'm prioritizing in my life does that pay homage to the price that he paid or does it reflect a different inspiration in my life him am i doing it for some other reason because he wasn't dragged in front of people he wasn't spit on he wasn't punched he didn't have a crown of thorns placed on his head so that we could live a life of our own making amen but he called us to a place where we would surrender our lives to him and because of that he he willingly walked up to the where they nailed him to a cross and he held himself there amen he chose to endure that suffering amen he didn't have to he was built for it remember well i know when i spoke last last easter that we showed where brother brown said that he had a body that was built to take the beating amen none of us could have handled that in the flesh that we have in this sinful flesh we would not have have survived the beating and the whipping that he took but god made him a special body that could live long enough so that he could fulfill everything that was required to him in the scriptures and then he would give up his life willingly for the sake of us amen it ought to keep us so humble so gentle even when you think of him standing there right the lamb of god perfect sinless spotless he's been told he's been proven in the face of two or three witnesses that he was sinless and perfect and yet he opened not his mouth amen and how often we have to what raise our mouth open to what defend ourselves amen to to to try and put somebody down to try and put ourselves back to where we feel we ought to be amen our land nature is supposed to be coming from him amen the nature we have is supposed to be that of a lamb not a wolf what does a wolf do when it when it gets when it gets faced with difficulty it bears its teeth doesn't it it growls it snaps it barks at you but what does the lamb do the lamb just lays down and gives its life amen that's what it was that he did amen and it's something that we ought to be able to do in our lives amen but i want us to turn to john 19 if we would tonight because i want to look at the the last few moments of jesus life because when we look here we see a beautiful thing because it wasn't just jesus that died on that cross amen but it was the word that died and when we look at and when we look at christ as the word not just as a man not just as a body that's anointed with the spirit of god but when we look at it as the word we start to understand why jesus did the things he did amen that this was not just a man but this was the word and flesh walking amongst us amen it says in john 19 verse 28 it says after this jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished so in other words knowing that he had fulfilled everything of every part of every purpose that god had for him on this earth in terms of the great plan of redemption it says that the scriptures might be fulfilled saith i thirst so knowing that everything's done as far as he knows it needs to be done he says there's still one thing left that has to be fulfilled and he says i'm thirsty because what he looked in psalm 69 21 and he saw where they had to give him the goal and so he said i thirst that doesn't mean he thirsts but it meant that the scripture had to be fulfilled and they had to give him that goal so even before he lays down his life the word is sitting there and saying the word still has to be fulfilled and that's what i'm focused on is the word being fulfilled in my life before i lay it down he had to finish that last prophecy before he could lay his life down that's how committed he was to the plan was he wanted to die no doubt many many hours many minutes before this he's going through great agony but yet he said the word has to be manifested in my life and there's one more thing i've got to do before i lay my life down it says now there was said a vessel full of vinegar and they filled a sponge with vinegar and put it upon hyssop and put it to his mouth now i want you to catch something here because they said that they used hyssop to give him the gall now we know that hyssop was used in the original passover to do what to apply the blood to the door nobody had to taste what was on the hyssop before amen but the blood that was placed on the hyssop was put over the door so that you didn't have to taste of the judgment of god so you didn't have to taste of the pain and suffering that was due you based on the sins that you had committed in that year right the the hyssop was used to apply the remedy to keep judgment off of you but now that the perfect sacrifice is there what is the hyssop doing now it's not laying off judgment but it is literally giving him a taste of what has been put off for for 4 000 years of people sinning and now he gets to taste what before was only pushing our sin away the hyssop brings to him what the gall the bitterness the pain the suffering that we should have been feeling all along and they put it to his mouth amen a man finally tasted what the blood had covered for so long is what's happening here it says and when jesus therefore have received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost he didn't die because his life left it says he gave up the ghost he gave it up willingly he let it separate from himself knowing that his purpose was finished and then knowing that he had done everything that god had called him to do he gave up the ghost and he laid his life down for you and i only after he fulfilled everything everything that the word had said about him up to that point would he lay his life down until then he would stay there and he would stay there and he would jared the antagony and he would endure the pain and he would endure the the suffering in the embarrassment he's naked on a cross naked on a cross no clothes like they paint they show in the in the movies and the paintings in the books he was stark naked in front of everybody right his bones were showing through his hands and his back where they whipped him and drove the nails through and yet he chose to stay there until the final thing was fulfilled that he was called to do and then and only then he said it is finished brother brahm said this he says that bee of death come down and circling around to sting him you know like any be it has a stinger in it but you know god prepared a flesh that time and it was the flesh of god he's drawing the distinction because if you and i were stung by that bee it had no effect on the bee but he says god had prepared a body god had prepared a flesh to treat this thing or a little differently and when that stinger once anchored in that son of god into a manual when he pulled himself out he had no stinger left amen death had sung so many people up to that but when he stung this flesh when he stung this man when he stung this body the stinger stuck amen what he took the sting right out of death no wonder paul could say death where is thy sting grave where is thy victory but thanks be to god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ he says he could sting elijah and die he could sting elijah and remain with his singer but you know if a bee ever stings deep enough he can't sting no more he pulls his stinger out so there was no human flesh he could anchor in oh my no one he could anchor in but when he put it in emmanuel that time he lost his stinger thanks be to god yes sir he failed on that one amen but i don't want to focus tonight on the pain and the suffering amen we're so thankful for that but what is the point of focusing on that if we don't realize the effect of all of that pain and suffering amen so tonight i want to focus on why he did it why did he go and endure the day of suffering and pain and embarrassment and all these things why did he hold himself to that whipping post amen he's sitting there and he's got the first lash and he knows 39 more are coming and that first one was agony and he says i've got a stick for the next 39 and he wills himself to go through it what i did to do it paul says this and i know i read this last last easter but it's a beautiful scripture in hebrews 12 it says wherefore seem we are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking under jesus the author and finisher of our faith where are you in this scripture jesus is the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and has set down at the right hand of the throne of god for consider him that endured such contradiction that means such opposition and rebellion of sinners against himself lest ye be weary than faint in your minds now i want you to catch something there because he says christ was facing opposition and rebellion from what those who he was trying to help the ones he came to die for were the ones that put them there and the ones that called out against them and he's dying for their sake and they're the ones that are giving them the hardest time and then paul says you guys have to remember the same thing because otherwise you're going to get what weary and faint in your minds why because there's those that we're trying to help and guess what they're in opposition they're in rebellion to us they're thankless they're loveless they lack appreciation they don't understand what you're doing for them and if you've been a parent for any time at all you'll recognize that in your own children many times is that you're laying down your life for your children if you're a child of god and they often don't realize what's going on and especially as they get into their teen years what is it they start to what reject the love and the grace that you're showing them because they don't understand what's going on he says you can't get weary in your minds when you're doing this because you're going to face opposition just like christ did amen and because if you want the same results you've got to go through the same holocritics you've still got to go through the trial you've got to go through the tribulations and so often it's easier for us to focus on what the the shame and and the the the despising that jesus went through because that's what we have things that we're going through that don't feel so good but my challenge tonight is ask is can we be identified in the joy that took him through the pain and suffering i mean not just for what he did but in what we're doing ourselves and what god has placed in our lives in the trials and tribulations that we go through can we look through it with eyes of joy to see that there's a bigger picture than where i'm standing today in the condition that i'm in where my family is where my marriage is where my finances is where my career is where my walk with god is where my faith is can we see that where there's a lack yet we've got to look with joy to see that there's something beyond it and there's a bigger picture amen amen i think that we ought to have the spirit of christ on us that is focused on as jesus was on understanding that there's a joy that lies ahead that makes everything we're going through worth it amen because he saw beyond what he was doing to see what lay beyond and it was you and i with him right it wasn't just us and it wasn't just him but it was two of us together amen standing together in glory amen amen we need to recognize we're in the purifying fire that's where we are today i counsel of thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire amen revelation 3 that's in the laodicean church age those that come out of it they're going to be purified aren't they james 1 says my brethren counted all joy when you fall into divers temptations let me stop there he says different temptations different kinds of temptations let me say this if you're going through the same one over and over again you haven't learned the lesson and that's why you keep going through it but when you go through different ones what does that show that shows that you're growing that shows that god is maturing you and he's taking you through these different things to show you what's in you to show you where you're lined up with the word and to show you where you need to line up with the word to draw you to the place where you can see the word coming out of you as you go through these trials and temptations verse 3 says knowing this that the trying of your faith works patience faith doesn't doesn't uh generate immediate results can i say it that way it says what the trying of your faith works patience so often we think i don't have faith because the result is not immediate the scripture didn't say that if you had faith it was immediate it said if you have faith it's going to happen but the timing is always in god's hands amen but it says what that faith work is patience and then he says but let face patience have her perfect work not faith have ever perfect worth work but but patience because patience is god the proving of your faith do you have what you say you have right it's not the immediacy of the results that proves the faith but whether you stay there until you get the results that god has laid on your heart to believe for amen let patience have a perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing i mean this is the joy that is set before us is that if we go through trials and temptations if we pass the testing of god then what waits for us is a maturity and a perfection that is entire and complete and lacking nothing as a body amen not one of us is going to be perfect and entire in terms of the entire word of god because we're still in these these two-thirds cursed bodies amen but as a body of the the bride of christ there's nothing going to be lacking right whether it's gifts whether it's whether it's ministries whether it's love joy peace all of these things it is all going to be available to the bride amen there's nothing lacking in her it says in verse 12 blessed is the man that endureth temptation for when he has tried he shall receive the crown of life which the lord hath promised to them that love him let no man say when he is tempted i am tempted of god for god cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed and then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death now he's pointing us back to what the original sin in eden which we just we read the effect of at the beginning of the service amen but it's he's reminding us if you're dealing with death you can trace it back to sin every time now you say well what is death we're not just looking to end of life but what is sickness but the death of health amen that is just something that is supposed to be in its fullness and its maturity and it's not why because it's dying because of what unbelief amen we we have uh sickness in our body because we're in bodies that are full of unbelief we're in a fallen condition amen and so we're being restored to a place and we'll get into this more tomorrow evening or tomorrow morning or sunday morning lord willing where the body is now going to respond to the very life of god that is within you but in the meantime we're dealing with death in our lives death in our bodies death in our relationships and all he's doing is trying to bring us back to where life is and then when he died it was allowing us to have access now to that tree of life that have been guarded by those flaming swords for so long amen what inevitably when we look at these things we find unbelief sitting at the bottom because that's what sin is amen sometimes god is letting things go downhill so that we can see there's a root of unbelief waiting at the bottom of what we're dealing with right and he's trying to get us to see you haven't accepted my word for that spot in your life you haven't opened that door in your life to me and because of that there's going to be a root of unbelief and it's going to bring death in that situation until you open the door and let the word come in amen amen it's so tiring sometimes isn't it when you're going through trials when you're going through temptations and it seems there's no end like i said jesus standing there at the whipping post so no doubt he slumped after the first one right that's a cat of nine tails it's got metal on the end that digs into the flesh and when he was done he was more marred he was more disfigured than any man in history and the first one comes down and he knows there's another 39 because he knows the scriptures he knows he's got to take the 40 lashes amen and sometimes we're sitting there and we're on lash number one lash number two and what is it it's god just stripping us down breaking us down because what this has to die this has to die amen we're buried with christ but we're not just buried with him because he died but we've got to die ourselves amen and i don't want to get into my sermon for the next time too much but we've got to have this that dies and then it's got to die out completely so that he can spring up the newness of life amen we have to be able like christ to enter into the into these things willingly amen and not saying lord give me a trial but when the trial comes saying lord show me what your purpose and your plan is here and let me walk through it graciously trusting you in everything that comes my way ephesians 2 says for we are his workmanship workmanship not just the creation amen we're a new creation we're a new creature but there is a working that's going on to bring us to what we are that means he's got to mold us he's got to shape us right we are created in christ jesus unto good works which god had before ordained that we should walk in them that ought to make us show that we were what before ordained that we should walk in good works right not of myself not of yourself but he chose us to walk in good works wherefore remember that ye being in times past gentiles in the flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time ye were without christ being aliens from the commonwealth of israel strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in this world now i don't identify so much with this scripture being raised in the message the way i have but i think the brother mark and brother bob and these ones that were just walking around pure heathens would you say brother mark really pure heathens you know catholic but having no idea of who and what god was and all of a sudden he walks down and he touches you on the shoulder and he says hey listen and your and your ear over and you say what's that why that sounds awfully good that sounds like home and you didn't even know you had a different home right what was it it was god stepping down to you who were aliens if this was a weight loss program this would be the before picture right it says you are aliens strangers from the covenants of promise having no hope and without god in this world now listen if you're raised in the message you're no different than that until you come to a new birth you are exactly that right because we're all aliens until we get the new birth but amen there are those here that have been completely outside of it that had no identification with the message and god dropped down and he touched them in a special way and here we stand today at church because of it right that what but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were far off sitting in that pew i was afar off far far far off and looking to get further away until he came and put his finger on my heart and said no you're not allowed to do that you're going to come with me and i said okay because why he touched me he came and talked to me and it wasn't just words on a page then it wasn't just message doctrine it was god knocking and saying hey time to walk with me i said okay recognized i was a son amen but now in christ jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of christ amen hallelujah thank you for that lord for he is our peace who had made both one and had broken down the middle wall of partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of commandments contained in ordinances for to make in him in himself of two one new man so making peace that he might reconcile both unto god in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereof that literally means when he says slain the enmity it literally means he killed the hatred and destroyed the cause of separation that's what christ did at calvary was he killed what separated us from god that's an amazing thing god could not breach that barrier remember there were flames there were swords of flame guarding the way to the tree of life nothing could pass and then he says christ killed the thing that was between us and came and preached peace to you who were afar off that's you and i and to them that were nigh that's the jews for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father that's the new birth now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the lord in whom ye also are builded together for inhabitation of god through the spirit if we were talking about a weight loss program this is the after picture amen that you are what built together not built singly not built singly remember i've said it before that thing that brother paul haylett said that stuck with me he said a sheep by itself is called only one thing in the scriptures and that is lost remember we are built together for inhabitation of god through one thing and one thing alone the holy spirit amen so when jesus christ said those words it is filled it is finished he fulfilled the payment for the sins of humanity and paved a way for us to where god can now dwell once again with humanity amen and what the blood of christ covers all of our sin brother gerald read this in the one of the the recent services in first john 1 he said and these things we write we unto you that your joy may be full remember we're looking through eyes of joy to what's waiting for us he says so then is this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that god is light and in him is no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth didn't say believe it not he says we don't do it but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus his son cleanses us from all sin prophet of god says it this way he says but christ the kinsman redeemer has made a way of escape for every believer on this earth today so there's no excuse for us there's no reason to doubt there's no reason to worry there's no reason to fear he says he's made a way for all of us i can point yonder to calvary where god himself was made flesh when he held the stinger of death and took my place as a sinner and paid the price and he laid out the welcome mat to me to come home whosoever will let him come and drink from the fountains of the water of life freely and he that comes in i will in no wise cast out praise the lord amen he what lays out the welcome man for the returning son and daughter amen amen what is it he doesn't stand there you know so often we approach and maybe we haven't quite lived the way we ought to or we've we've slipped or something and we think he's standing there with arms crossed and chest out and glaring down at us is that what we see here what is it we have we have christ laying out a welcome mat for his child to come back he didn't say come to me as a believer he said come to me as a child and i'll turn you into a believer amen he doesn't say you know the church is not a place for perfect people to come it's for hurting people to come and to be turned into a mature bride amen he doesn't ask us to come in perfection he just asks us to come and he does the work right because if he calls you it's his work from start to finish we don't start it so we can't finish it and we can't do anything in the in between because it says as we read earlier that he is the author the start and the finisher of our faith so what is it he draws us to him he knocked down the wall of partition he killed the thing that separated us which was sin and unbelief amen he gave us clear access to him as it was in eden and now there's no angel guarding the tree of life in fact we have the opposite we have an angel of life pulling us to the tree of life right we have an angel of life we have an angel messenger in this age and he's saying what to john he says go and take the book go eat of the tree of life he's actually stopped he's not guarding it anymore but he's compelling you he's driving you he's pushing you to go and taste of that word of life which is christ amen brother brown says this he says look here it is i hope you get it just as sure as man is born of a woman he has to die it's just that sure if he's born of christ he's got to live he's got to live he can't help it he's got eternal life christ said he had now in that day god guarded the tree to keep them from getting it but now that swords turn right back the other way now running them right into the tree so that they will receive the life driving people hurting them up to the tree of life how marvelous amen that's what we heard in this age was the angel that tells john representing the bride go and take the book it hasn't been available it's available now go take it and eat it and eat it and eat it and eat it because it's yours you're a part of it but you got to eat it you can't just stand there looking at it amen then the prophet of god takes it one step further he says when he come and was made flesh and anchored the stinger of death and pulled it out where you and i can walk in the face of it death can't bother us hallelujah he says for every believer that's in christ jesus is perfected forever praise god perfected forever finished work we're in a body of time but it's a finished work because as soon as he said it was finished it opened the door for the planet redemption to start rolling downhill and once it starts rolling nothing can stop it satan can get there he can build walls he can build barriers he can try and stand in front of it and redemption flattens every one of it because the price has been paid and he has nothing that can hold it back now yeah he can he can't hold up our sins right god they don't even exist before the blood used to cover it so he couldn't see it through the blood now they don't even exist brother brahm says the revelation of justification is not that he can't see it it's that you didn't do it in the first place there is no record of it therefore you didn't do it in the first place so satan cannot stand there as an accuser of the brethren because god is saying i can't see anything and if i can't see anything it never existed because god can see everything except what sins that are under the blood amen amen this word of promise is what reminding us of the effect of christ's death on that cross and his resurrection that that that that sunday morning stands eternally right perfected forever brother brown says this he says now that super sign was a virgin born child that was to last forever an eternal sign and that child is not dead they killed him he died certainly the stinger of death killed him but god raised him up again and here he is after 2 000 years of all the hardships and locusts and palmer worms eating on it there is still a remnant of people that believe god and keep his word amen i fear we're getting to the point in the message where we believe god but we won't keep his word he says there'll be a bride number one two just as certain as i'm standing in this pulpit there'll be a bride that's washed in the blood of that lamb and that lamb will be living among them showing super signs of his resurrection after 2 000 years the same thing he did when he was here on earth he says i believe that amen amen amen this is because super saiyan 1962 brother branham is saying the super sign is not william branham he's saying the super sign is the life of christ in a multi-membered bride amen that's where we're standing today isn't it it's got to be that place amen everything in the old testament pointed towards christ coming and christ dying but when he breathed his last plan his last breath the plan of redemption started moving forward and satan can't stop it now it's got to keep moving forward in matthew 27 jesus when he had cried again with the loud voice yielded up the ghost and behold the veil of the temple was rent and twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent now when jesus died and i i've seen so many people preach on this and i've heard brother branham preach on this and they look at this scripture and they say when he died the earth shook there was a great earthquake and the sun went dark and the veil was was torn from the top to the bottom showing that it was god tearing down that partition to show that he wasn't living behind there anymore that he was going to be moving into another veil amen but more often when we hear these things they say what that was the earth mourning that was the earth crying that was the earth letting us know that our creator had died and given his life for us and it was sorrow that shook but i want to read this quote because brother branham gives this in 1964 as part of his christmas message and we know that brother branham said that after the seals were opened my bible became a whole new book now i want you to listen to this because this oh i so loved this when i read it because it gave me a whole new appreciation of what happens when god gives you a revelation listen to this he says when the great shepherd was smitten that great sheep prophet when he was smitten back there he said it is finished and that minute as soon as this shepherd was smitten it was over sin is settled and there was no more sin they were clean the penalty was paid the believers whose names were written in the book of life predestinated from the foundation of the world it was finished that very minute that jesus said it was finished he that great shepherd had come for a sheep it was finished god's right hand was full from pulled from his bosom smitten then on easter he returned it what that hand and raised it up again to his bosom and it extended it down to you and i in the form of his word to redeem us back to the original garden from which sin took us the hidden secret of his great heart was revealed by a prophet shepherd no wonder listen to this this is what made me oh it was amazing he said no wonder the mountains jumped and shouted on that day no wonder the sun hit its face and screamed for joy no wonder all nature broke loose the wind shook the trees till they shook and shook and joyed and jumped they seen the prophet shepherd on the mountain redeem every name on the book of life and they seen that their own nature was redeemed amen so it wasn't sadness that made them act that way the prophet says it was joy that made them act that way it was joy that made them shout it was joy that made them break into why because their nature was being redeemed back this is his proof he says they screamed and jumped and the world went into an earthquake the mountains rent the rocks fell out the sun went down and everything taken place he says like any meeting when the shepherd reveals to you it's finished i've seen jumping spells and joy spells but there was nobody hurt the mountains rung out the sun went down and everything took place but there was nobody hurt and i've seen meetings where the power of god was revealed to the people that they were free from the world and the things of the world and the joy of the lord fill the congregation they stood and screamed and cried and shouted to the top of their voice for the glory of god i never did see anything disorderly they was always right in order because they have recognized that their names that have been written on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world the great prophet shepherd had brought them the message and they were delivered the prophet shepherd no matter what the other ecclesiastical realm said about it they knew what had happened oh my that's why we shout that's why we scream that's why we dance that's why we raise our hands is because we know what has happened not what will happen what has already happened though i don't see anything i know it is a finished work amen that's why we shout is because we've received a revelation that it is finished just as them shepherds did back there they knowed what took place what is it nature itself bore witness of the redemption plan unfolding amen it testified that we were on the garden back to eden nature cried out that fellowship with god was restored even as that veil was torn what did it show anyone can come in you don't have to be a high priest you don't have to be a member of the ministry you don't have to be a member of this family this tribe this nation even everyone has access to that tree of life if they'll walk in the light as he is in the light amen and what do we have now the earth is groaning for the manifestation of the sons of god it's not screaming for joy now it's saying the time is at hand isn't it that's what the scripture says that it's groaning for the manifestation of the sons of god and what is it doing we see all these things happening they call it climate change you know what it is nature says what it won't be long we're ready for full redemption it's about that time get ready people remember jesus said how is it that you can't discern the times we look here and we see all these things happening we ought to see that nature is saint it won't be long soon we'll be going home amen brother bram said this he said sickness superstition and the devils had us pinned us down but there was no way out and the church had gone wrong they went off on denominational things and the pharisees and sadducees and washing of pots and pans that's how far their religion it got was they were worried about the washing of pots and pans if we get there brother we are a denomination and the word of god become of no effect but they'd sit there for days and and talk about it and and debate it and go back and forth and use message quotes to debate who's right and who's wrong wouldn't they that was the message for their day it was the law of the prophets and they'd sit there and they'd say i got a quote for this and i got a quote for that he says and what the word of god had no effect in their life but this little dove came down and there's only one thing that could take place there had to be a redeemer but being wounded broken beaten torn and he knowed his way back home so from calvary's cross where they bruised him mashed him tore him like a bunch of wolves upon him he made his flight from calvary and he landed in heaven's door saying it's finished it's finished they are free sickness can be healed now sinners can be saved the captive can be made can be set free what was it as we read in that quote earlier it was the hidden secret of his great heart being expressed nature was expressing it and now he was going to fall on sons and daughters of god to express the very same thing what is it the word expressed once more we have access now to the tree of life which is christ himself amen and what is it they had the word back then the word's always been there but now they had a living word that was a difference it was a living word not just living in on the pages but it was living in the life of a man and now it was coming down to a bride that he called out from his side he says we're trying to let the sinner know that god loves him and he's already saved him if he will just accept it it's the work that christ finished at calvary when he made that all-sufficient word saying it is finished the whole plan of salvation all that could be done for mankind by the heart of god was finished when christ said those words you want to add to it there's nothing more to add he says it is finished and when he said those words everything that god could ever do was finish god's plan was completed we just have to have faith to receive what he has finished for us i want to read a quote from the ephesian church age that's the first stage so this is after christ died he comes back of course we have we have the the folly of the holy spirit on on the day of pentecost and we see what the book of revelation says to them and it says to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god he couldn't say this until christ had died because the way had to be made the price had to be paid he says what a thrilling thought this is that tree of life in the garden of eden which could not be approached unto because of the fall of adam is now given to the overcomer the flaming sword of the guardian cherubim has been sheathed but it was not sheathed er its blade was bloody with the blood of the lamb he says let us meditate upon this truth a while as we consider why the tree was denied to adam and his descendant descendants but now allowed again god's intention for his creation man is to express his words in genesis adam was given the word to live by a life lived by the word would be the word expressed i want to read that again a life lived by the word would be the word expressed that's our job that is true is it not but did adam live by that word no because he was to live by every word and he failed to take heed of every word then there arose moses what a great and mighty man he was yet he also failed to live by every word and that prophet the type of the great prophet to come failed in anger to obey the word there was also david the great king of israel a man after god's own heart he failed by adultery when he was tempted but eventually in the fullness of time there came one the head even jesus who also must be tempted to see if he would live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god then was satan foiled for here was one who lived by it is written and that masterpiece of god overcame by reflecting god's word amen you want to overcome reflect god's word and then this was manifest then was this manifested perfect one given to the cross as the perfect lamb of god for the perfect sacrifice and on the tree he received the wounds unto death that we by him and because of him might eat of the tree of life and then that tree of life freely given would enable us to overcome and express the word of god but now to these sons of god who by him overcome are given the privilege of the paradise of god and the constant fellowship of jesus christ there will never more be any separation from him whither he goes his bribe will go what is his he shares with his beloved on a joint air relationship the secret things will be revealed the dark things will be made plain we shall know as we are known and we shall be like him this is the heritage of the overcomer who has overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of testimony to jesus christ how we long for that day when the crooked roads will be all straightened along for that in my life the road's there it's got to be straightened out in here doesn't it praise the lord and we will be with him time without end may that day hasten its appearance and may we hasten to obey his word and thereby prove our worthiness to share his glory listen you have no worthiness in your in your righteousness and the things you do he says your worthiness is when we obey his word that's the only thing that makes you worthy that shows it doesn't make you worthy shows you worthy to share his glory he that hath an ear let him hear with the spirit say to the churches how tragic it is that this first age did not listen to the spirit instead it listened to man now listen to this he says but thank god in the last stage there will be a group rise up the true bride of the last day and she will listen to the spirit amen period not occasionally not once or twice she will listen to the spirit in that day of gross darkness the light will return by the pure word and we will return to the power of pentecost to welcome back the lord jesus i like what brother gerald said the other day i believe brother ed mentioned it as well when he was here we're going back to the power of the pentecostal church but we do not have the same message because theirs was they go under the world and preach all the gospel with signs and wonders following but our message it's not that the signs and wonders are not supposed to follow brother brown made that very clear that never went away and it was very evident in his ministry and we see it going on but we don't see it as the major focus amen why because the word is here right it was to draw people to that word the words here now we're moving on from that but what our we have the same power but our anointing is to overcome and is to overcome as we heard here by obeying every word that is the overcomer in this age is that they will live by every word again amen what we've we've heated the voice we've gotten ourselves out of denomination and i'll say it again if you're sitting in here and saying that this is what gets me into heaven because i attend a message church you have made it a denomination that is not what gets you in but it's when he's knocking on your heart and you let him in that's when you get life inside amen and that's when you receive the new birth and that's when you move on with him amen so we must be outside of all influences all groups all denominations all ministries that would try and do what make the word of god ineffective in our life listen the minute a minister tries to make you do something he's making the word of god ineffective because the word has to have that effect not a man driving you to do it amen that's where legalism crept into the message was they said you got to listen to me or else and what they may have been right every time but that's not wakes that makes a believer live they live by the life of christ in them which is the holy spirit amen what is it like enoch we're going to have an enoch anointing and that's that we we have one revelation before we go and it's that we please god why because he's walking with us he's talking with us he's living in us his thoughts are our thoughts his ways are our ways right we've died and he's alive right and we're gonna understand hey i'm just like he is and that's when we have that adoption time that final adoption the great adoption if i could put it that way what is it because at that time we recognize we are him right he's in us in the same fullness as a body as he was in christ when he was hearing man what am i getting at here i'm telling you that what jesus christ went through all the way to calvary was for one thing that was the set in motion a redemption plan that would bring you back to god just like it was in the beginning to where you don't have a barrier between you and god right where you're not praying into a brass ceiling where you can speak and you know that he hears where you can ask and know that he has answered right not in your time but in his time but you know he's answered and even as a even as uh her brother ron say this morning that when god answers it's always good right meaning it's always right you may get an answer different than what you asked for but it's always right the way he answers amen listen nothing can stop this plan it's finished it's finished we're just in this body of time proving what ourselves our character our nature dying out we're going to take the character we develop here and it's going to go with us in our theophany bodies that's how that's the kind of character the bride's going to have is that it can go with her because it's the only part of god that's in her when she's here but let me say this even your lack of faith won't stop god's program amen i can prove it by the word even your lack of faith your unbelief won't stop it your big mistakes your small mistakes your habits your secrets won't stop the plan of redemption because why he already said it's finished so you can't stop it because it's already done that's what he meant when he said it's finished it's done it's as good as done he's speaking from the mind of god when he does that we're in this body of time but it's already finished and jesus said i'm not going to lose a single one so if you are a child of god if you are a son of god if you are a daughter of god you cannot be lost there's no way i think brother mark mentioned it he says if god won't get you to do what he wants here he'll take you but he'll take you he doesn't give you over to satan he'll take you and he'll put you over there and you lose your reward but you don't lose your soul right he's not going to lose you no matter what you do amen the scripture says in romans 8 that what he says neither tribulation distress famine peril death life angels principalities and powers can't separate us from the love of god what makes you think that your lack of faith could stop it you can listen the faith that you have is of god anyways we'll get into it more in the next service but you can't even have faith unless god gives it to you not to walk off this planet that's for sure amen what faith comes by hearing which is understanding and understanding comes by the word of god so you can't even have faith until god gives you understanding what is it what do we call an understanding from god revelation so unless god reveals it to you you can't have faith in the first place right if you believe you've accepted his word you've obeyed his word and he's given you life by the holy spirit you can't stop yourself from making it right the eternal life of god in you cannot die amen right it's going to carry you all the way through we get so caught up in our mistakes and failures sometimes i know i do i'm probably my biggest critic because i'm a perfectionist i always want to be right i always want to be good i always want to have the right reaction and guess what i don't and so what happens is you start to say well where is the nature of christ in this situation why didn't i do it this way why didn't i do it that way and you start to beat yourself up amen but what i get caught up in looking at the circumstances in my reaction to him rather than saying that he said it's a finished work and he's going to get me there right one way or the other he's going to get me there listen i need further sanctification in my life and you do too if only to give more time and energy to the things of god it's not that you have bad things in your life it's that you've got to give more to him and that requires sanctification sanctification just means taking more out so that he can put more in that's really what we're looking at so when i'm lacking what do i do i go to god and i say i'm lacking i don't try and cover it up i don't try and hide in the shadows i don't try and say yeah but i have a wonderful i'm a minister i got it all no i don't have anything more than you do i got a gift to preach that's it a call to preach maybe not even a gift just a call by that i'm the same as everybody else right what is it we all have failures we all have faults we all have these little things that trip us up sometimes they're big things so i do as i go to god and i say god i've got a bad attitude i'm a natural cynic that doesn't play well with christianity right right i'm distrustful by nature so what do i do i go to god and i say god this ain't going to fly in the rapture you said it's finished you said i was going to be complete and entire and needing nothing so lord i'm coming to you and then it's up to him to do it not up to me to do it but it's up to me to stop pretending and go and say i have a need remember the zeal for the age for laodicea was one of repentance the prophet said what is it because they said i'm rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing that's their mindset is i've got it all and he says no you've got to repent and you've got to let me mold and shape you and beat you until the purity of the character of christ is inside of you so you've got in order to get to that place you've got to recognize i'm not where i ought to be not that i don't have the holy ghost not that i'm not a believer but that there's something has to be taken out to get to where we're going amen to get to purity everything in pure has to be taken out and listen we're full of it we're full of impurities i can say i am amen but listen i don't try and manufacture it why you can't manufacture the fruits of the holy spirit it just happens and it's got to be his life doing it not you because what you'll find is it'll work to a point and then you'll hit something that the that the human nature can't overcome and you'll fall down every time but it's when the supernatural is needed that's when you'll know you've got it amen amen i've got a hair i've got to bear the fruit of the holy spirit and that's by promise not by command and then i don't bring it on i don't turn it on i don't turn it off it just happens right and if it doesn't happen then i go to god and i say we need to talk we need to talk amen it's on him to supply my need it's up to me to confess i have a need amen all i'm doing is reminding him hey you said it's a finished work i'm not finished so let's get to the finishing party man brother bram said this jesus in his prayer said father i sanctify myself jesus becomes sanctified do the church to the church he could have gotten married but he didn't do it he become sanctified he said sanctify them father through the truth thy word is the truth now let's lay aside every weight now this is where we get personal you got a temper you got something about you makes you talk when you ought not to talk oh god he says lay it there now lay it there and watch the fire of the altar come down and take it away now watch what he says next he says watch the love of god lick it up because we think it's this destructive power right that he consumes it and rips it out of your life but brother brahm says it's the love of god that will destroy it in your life amen when the love of god is shed abroad in your heart remember brother branham said when somebody does you wrong and they've just they've done you wrong like you justly know you know that they did you wrong he says you go into your prayer closet he says and you pray until god gives you a revelation of why they did it he said and then you'll feel sorry for that brother or sister and you'll pray for them to come back to where they need to be that's when the love of god licks it up as opposed to i sit there and try and manufacture forgiveness amen he says watch all that old selfishness the way you've been talking to your wife the way you've been talking to your husband the way you've been talking to your neighbor the way you've talked about the people in the church lay it all on the altar this morning and the fire of god will come down and take it right away and divine love will burn in its place that's what i want love he said you can have all of this but he says not but perfect love can enter there all this listen i know people that have all this in this church how many of us have that i believe we've got people in this church have that too but this is the great separator because it takes the holy spirit together you can do all of this you can walk this walk you can there's plenty of denominational believers that i can point to that have this sort of a life how many have this you can't do that one without the holy spirit that's where the new birth comes in and takes us to that point amen amen i like yeah divine love will burn this place he says you've got sickness lay it on the altar and say lord here it is create in me a clean heart create in me a healing power and see what god will do god will do it this morning i like what brother gerald said i asked him after the service last last time he preached he said faith will work out what god has worked in and i said where did you get that he said that's mine came from me that was the lord that's what it was that was one of the most amazing things i've heard from anybody in a long time faith will work out what god has worked in a man we want faith to move mountains sometimes listen to this because we're believers you know who told somebody to do something because they were a believer satan if thou be the son of god do so and so and you know what satan comes in and he'll tempt us and he'll say you're a believer you should do this you should do that you should be here you should be there that's not the spirit of god in you right when the spirit of god comes in it raises up a standard it points you to the word and it gives you a faith to act on it but if we start doing things because we're believers and we're supposed to do it that has nothing to do with the holy spirit moving in our life we are supposed to move by inspiration remember brother branham said with about the bride he said she will have the word and she'll know what to do with it and she will have dust saith the lord or she will hold her peace she'll stay quiet right so we don't do things because we're believers amen we have faith as we have revelation so unless god reveals it to you it's just a hope whatever you're believing for whatever you're asking for whatever you're looking for it's hope until god does it and we can believe till we're blue in the face and it won't make a lick of difference right you don't put old wine and new bottles the scripture says now these days you know if i i looked at the wine bottles there for communion they're glass that doesn't make sense to us today but in the old days what did you carry your wine in it was a skin it was an animal skin and so they put new wine in new skin because the skin would stretch as the wine expended as it aged but if you put new wine in an old skin what happens with an old skin is it loses its flexibility older sisters and brothers listen up we lose flexibility as we get old don't we not just naturally either right he says you can't put old revelation in a new bottle and you can't put new revelation in an old bottle right they've got to grow together so listen you'll sit there and you'll say hey do i have faith for the rapture listen if you've only been serving the lord for 10 years you don't why new revelation new bottle you've got to age your revelation your faith has to grow as you do it when you get the holy ghost brother brahms you says you have the potential to create a world and go live on it he says but the law of god won't allow you to do it but he says you have that potential in you but as you grow in faith as god opens things up to you then your faith grows for what he shows you and until he shows you you can't have faith for it that's the way it's going to go amen so you don't get the holy spirit and immediately become ready for a rapture you are qualified for the rapture but you're not rapture ready in the sense if you don't have the faith for the rapture because what it's got to grow in you it's got to well up inside of you it's got to build up and then it's going to blow and that's when we go but god's got to bring that to you amen your revelation grows it causes your faith to grow and you can't force it you can't force revelation study does not give you revelation it didn't work for nicodemus and it didn't work for paul right until god opens your eyes then you're not going to go anywhere amen you can't make it up all you can do is the one thing we're told that brings faith amen spiritual understanding that's brought on by the hearing of the word brother braham says this he says and you are true and honest and just and upright and holy and respectable he says not because that isn't christianity you do that that's just the fruits of christianity because you believe it's the attributes of your faith in christ jesus and your birth as his son amen see a good tree can't bring forth corrupt fruit but a corrupt tree can bring forth corrupt fruit they just bring forth good fruit and by their fruits you shall know them he says now if the holy spirit comes into this building tonight and would declare his word to be the truth and you go out disbelieving you'd be a sinner if god tells you what your life has been and what it will be and if you know that what has been is the truth and tells you what will be if you go disbelieve it worse things than this will come upon you go ye and sin no more now sin doesn't mean go out and drink and carry on it says go ye and disbelieve no more amen there you are he says you know what i find the greatest trouble with the pentecostal church today is i'll extend this to the message positionally they don't know what they are amen your sons and daughters of god and a lot of times you're looking for something great to come but you already got that the greatest can be given to you now now he says we are the sons of god not we will be we are now and we're seated together in heavenly places in christ jesus right now oh my he says when faith like that gets in the church the devil moves away from the place satan hasn't got any legal rights at all over a christian every time a man gets saved god just writes out a whole big bunch of checks like that and puts his name at the bottom and said here they are fill them out are you scared of it he says fill it out whatever things you desire when you pray believe you receive it it'll be given to you mark 11 24. he says see just believe it we don't do checks anymore do we most of us we do e-transfers but even with e-transfers it's not always instantaneous if i send a hundred dollars it goes immediately if i send fifteen hundred dollars they take their time with that don't they to make sure it's authorized and everything's good to go and all of these different things i send i transfer between accounts sometimes and if i send a small amount it's in my email right away if i send a bigger amount sometimes it takes an hour for them to push it through because they have people checking everything right it's no different with god right you write the check that doesn't mean it goes through that day the funds are always there is what brother branham i'm saying the funds are always there sometimes it takes a while to make the transfer amen that's all it is amen when jesus died and said it was finished that's when every redemptive blessing was loosed so when it comes to healing deliverance the fruits of the spirit love joy peace patience all these different things when he died every single one of those was made available access to god you don't have to go through a ministry amen you don't have to go through a person you can go direct one-on-one and talk with god anytime you want right the veil was torn right every redemptive blessing was made available and brother brown says are you scared are you too scared to use them because he says they're all available when they were when he said it was finished that's when it was all available to us right god starts with faith for salvation right and even that is not your faith scripture says what that what by grace through faith are you saved and that not of yourself it is the gift of god amen so if it's the faith of god that starts it not your faith then why are we sitting here wondering if we're going to have faith for the next step it's the faith of god that started it it's the faith of god that keeps it moving and it's the faith of god that's going to finish it amen so why do we worry why do we stress am i going to make it am i going to be delivered am i going to be healed am i going to do this am i going to have that am i going to reflect this hey he started it it's his faith that started it brother mark when he was walking down the road that first time he didn't all of a sudden have faith to say hey i'll bet you if i talk to god right now he'll listen to me and make me his child did you no what happened god gave a call and gave him the faith to respond and that's grace that's grace because you had nothing to do with it brother mark there's nothing good or bad that he did to deserve it right it was just god dropped it in there and then god gave him the faith to respond to it amen so why do we worry about faith for the next step whatever it is whether it's relationships whether it's marriage whether it's career whether it's ministry whatever it might be why do we worry right if he started it he's going to finish it in each and every one of us amen for some of us it's faith to let him lead us take your hand off the steering wheel that's a great one for a believer you know they had that song jesus take the wheel we need to do a lot of letting jesus take the wheel amen for some of us it's our finances stop striving stop straining stop checking every nickel as it goes i'm a testimony to that i probably still need to do it you know what you check everything because you think well i gotta do my part and god's saying listen i got the cattle on a thousand hills and you're sitting there looking at nickels buddy what are you doing be careful don't lose your joy over it if you lost your joy you've gone too far is that the easy way to put it when you lose your joy god ain't in control right amen sometimes it's faith to be healed and guess what i look at great ministries great men and guess what they prayed for people look at brother branham himself prayed for people healed instantaneously supernatural miracles by the thousands maybe the millions and yet he has a problem with his stomach that doesn't go away until the last year of his life did brother branham lack faith anybody here want to accuse the prophet of god of lacking faith no god had to show him that now is the time and he said when god showed him remember when he was up in sabino canyon he saw that thing leap at him and he moved out of the way it impaled itself on the thorns and died that's when it went away for good right didn't have anything to do with his faith it was what there was more going on and that's the thing is so often we think it's about the event it's about the moment it's about the situation it's about the trial and it's not it's about the big big picture because it's not just about your healing it's not just about your deliverance see god's only got this much time and he's got to cram this much into it so it's not just your healing it's not just your deliverance it's not just your career it's not just your finances it's not just your marriage but it's all this character building that he's trying to go through remember patience is the one that has the perfect work faith keeps you going to have the patience that's all he's trying to do is let us sit back and say all right lord i'm believing i'm acting on that belief and that means it's up to you to let the check go through and when it goes through it's going through and i'll never have to wonder again and the bill will be paid from my side where i can see it he says we are here studying and we must have faith in what we're coming for because remember all redemptive blessings have been already purchased can we believe that with all of our heart that all the redemptive blessings was purchased god achieved that for us through calvary with jesus christ jesus said to the father it is finished what is finished the whole plan of salvation everything is finished all the promises that i made is how brother branham puts it all the promises that i made are finished the deposit is put before god that all sins are forgiven and we're back from the slave market and all has been redeemed he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace is upon him and with his stripes we were healed it's all finished so what's he saying he's saying listen in the all these redemptive blessings are there and all you have to do is write the check how do you write the check revelation of god drops down you say father i'm believing your word you make your confession and then it's up to him to bring it to pass and you stay with that confession amen and in all that though he's going to bring you to maturity he's going to bring you to a place where you are born of his bone flesh of his flesh word of his word thought of his thought where he can trust you to act in his situation in his stead in a situation i should say amen he's bringing us to a oneness he's bringing us to a christ-like love he's developing a christ-like character in us and we think we lack faith and all we lack is sight to look beyond to see the big picture we're not lacking faith look at abraham 25 years abraham did he lack faith he kept walking he didn't go back home right he didn't marry another woman now he made some mistakes so i love i can identify with abraham and david and moses and all the rest even joseph right but what faith keeps you moving while god does the work in the rest of your life amen the the delay is not due to our faith but it's due for our need of growth and if god gave us everything we wanted when we wanted it we would be spoiled brats and you know what the devil says he says because you're a believer and you didn't get it immediately you're not a real believer you don't have the holy ghost and you don't have faith and nothing is further from the truth amen what is it god's using everything for our good even when we think we're failing the problem is we think we're failing and again has nothing to do with us so you're saying he's failing but you put it on yourself and you get mad at yourself but really what you're saying is god's failing because it's his work start to finish so stop blaming anybody and just sit back and let god do it and then move through the trial move through the situation he says now then we have a right then when we come to god and ask him for his help and that's what we're for here tonight here for tonight now if i'm telling you that work is already finished which the bible declares that it is finished then what could i do for it if it's already finished he said i can't add to this i can do something for you if it's already done the only thing i can do is point you to the time it was finished and the scripture that says it was finished and that's about all that can be done it rests within your personal faith in the finished work of jesus christ at calvary that's the only gospel i know that's written in the bible the work was finished at calvary and we only look to that place we only look to that place do we look elsewhere because if we're looking elsewhere then it's not going to work but by faith we draw dividends off of our eternal salvation i love how he puts that what are dividends when you buy into a certain stock or a certain company then every quarter as they make money or even if they don't make money these days they'll send whoever owns stock in that company a portion of money so that's a portion because you have ownership you automatically get money from them every single quarter that's all he says redemptive blessings are just god's dividends to you because why you have a part of him you are a part of him therefore you get the benefits of being a part of him amen he says what we only look to that place and by faith we draw dividends off of our eternal salvation this is the earnest of our salvation the scripture says he says now we look and live we believe that's all he's asking you to do look live believe now jesus when he died after making that promise he said the same things that he did the church would do until he returned again i'll be with you and in you to the end of the world and the things that i do you shall also greater than this or more than this will you do for i go to my father god was operating through one human being jesus and when he returned to god he operates universally in every believer's heart around the world listen i can start and i can start quoting names from sister sister betty to brother gerald to sister lily to sister rebecca and joe and come all the way down here and go all the way around and i can put your name right there it says he operates universally in every believer's heart around the world this is not some special call to to men or ministry or special gifts this is to everyone that he is called to believe this end time message he operates universally through every single one of us amen jesus said it is finished what was he pointing to you and i he's letting you and i know hey don't worry be not afraid how many times did the angel say be not afraid when he came with amazing things be not afraid don't be worried don't be anxious why it's a finished work right it still has to play through time but the veil was torn so that we could have access to god we could have access to the holy spirit brother braham says you just look to the finished work of calvary any time you get in into an issue anytime you get into trouble any time you see there's a lack you look to the finished work of calvary and say that's where i'm drawing my strength from i'm drawing strength because he said it's finished not because i feel finished and then if we go by the way we feel by the energy we have by the happiness we feel on a day-to-day basis we are going to be of all men most miserable and women right but if we look to that finished work then we can rest that he's going to make it all work through it men we don't look at symptoms we don't look at failures amen we don't look to our lack our slackness our mistakes we look to a finished work and believe that as he's looking at us through the blood of christ that means we're going to make it through no matter what and when christ comes he says we'll see him because we will be just like he is amen amen let's stand together if we would amen we're stuck in this body of time that's our curse is that we're stuck in a body of time but we're reading a word that's inspired from eternity so he sees the finished work he sees where we're going to end up he sees what you're going to go through and how it's going to change you and how it's going to grow you and how it's going to mature you in these things brethren says you're free because of it you're free because of it not because you have nothing here but you're free because he says it's a finished work and you can rest that no matter what you're going in amen but we just what holds us back we don't recognize what's going on right we're too busy looking at the situation we're so busy looking at the problems we're so busy looking at ourselves and god just needs to raise our sights a little bit higher to point us to the joy that comes when you realize that there's a bigger thing going on there's a bitter pig picture being painted and then we look and you know if this was my life right here and and all i was concerned about is i was surrounded by dirt it wouldn't be much of a picture but if you look in here and i'm surrounded by a tabernacle and the sacrifices and all these other people i'd say hey life isn't really so bad but if all i'm looking at is where i'm standing with my dirt it's a tough life i'm living isn't it he says lift up your eyes a little bit higher amen what's the trial to believe when you see no evidence when nothing's moving you feel like nothing's changing the thing is this when you're walking on the slightest of inclines you walk on it long enough you get to a much higher level but you don't really notice that incline and that's often the way it is with the believer sometimes you're walking for a long time seems like nothing happens and then you look around and you say whoa what happened i tell the story of my mom remember with the makeup and she came to the message and she still loved having makeup and she said to god she said lord i like my makeup your prophet said we shouldn't wear it so i'm going to ask you to take it away she didn't try and stop wearing makeup she just left it in his hand she said six months later i realized i wasn't wearing makeup anymore why slow gradual slope right sometimes god steps in supernaturally and you heal people you know they they get saved and they give their life to god they get baptized and they're they're on drugs they're smoking alcohol and they just go boom and they just jump 10 stories in a leap because that's god cleaning them up that's a sanctifying work but when we're looking at growth growth never happens like that even the fastest growing things like bamboo in the world they can grow six inches over you know in 24 hours but it's still not immediate there's still got to be something happening amen that's what we've got to do is trust that it's a finished work even when we don't see anything happening amen amen let's bow our heads if we would heavenly father lord what peace it is to know that it's finished lord and though we're stuck in time lord though we're stuck in these twice cursed bodies heavenly father lord though we often seem like we're lacking so much lord yet we know the promise says that we will be complete and lacking nothing when this is all said and done and lord we just ask that you would help us to surrender ourselves anew lord as we dwell on the great sacrifice that you made lord may we know that it was not for nothing lord that you didn't just do it on the off chance that somebody might take its benefits but lord that you did it for a pre predestined a for ordained group of people lord that are going to live the very life of christ lord on this earth lord we pray that you would lift our eyes up a little bit higher lord may we not look at each other lord the faults and failures lord the prophet said if you go looking for them you'll find them every time but lord if we can look to the word that is within each other lord we know that we can join together and we'll make it through lord that will be built together into an inhabitation for you lord we pray your grace this evening lord as we move into the the other orders of the service lord may you just minister to hearts and souls lord we pray there will be healing in the cup that there will be deliverance in the cup or that there would be lord the love that we spoke of in the cup lord that you would just put a supernatural touch in our hearts and souls lord that your holy spirit would have free reign in this church we pray lord in jesus christ wonderful name we ask him amen and amen he's got it all in control 11 16. he's got it all in control well he's got it all in control
