[41:37] have here amen amen it's good to be home
[41:39] brother Bob that was a good song service
[41:40] you set me up beautifully this morning
[41:42] for what the Lord's laid on my heart
[41:44] amen so John 14 and: 16 says and I will
[41:47] pray the father and he shall give you
[41:49] another comforter that he may abide with
[41:51] you forever even the spirit of Truth
[41:54] whom the world cannot receive
[41:56] because it seeth him not neither knoweth
[41:59] him but ye know him for he dwelleth with
[42:01] you and shall be in you I will not leave
[42:04] you comfortless I will come to you yet a
[42:07] little while and the world seeth me no
[42:09] more but ye see me because I live ye
[42:12] shall live also and he says at that day
[42:15] you shall know that I am in the father
[42:17] and you in me and I in you now that's
[42:20] full restoration that's the full
[42:22] revealing of the word now that's the
[42:23] unity of the word that's the revealing
[42:25] of who God is God above us God With Us
[42:28] God in us that's the whole thing there
[42:30] but I want you to see now because in
[42:32] verse 21 he's going to give us a
[42:33] description of what this looks like see
[42:37] we can elevate it into some Grand
[42:38] theology some great mystery some great
[42:41] Doctrine but if you look in verse 21 he
[42:43] tells you what this looks like he says
[42:45] he that have my Commandments and keepeth
[42:48] him he it is that loveth me and he that
[42:52] loveth me shall be loved of my father
[42:54] and I will love him and will manifest
[42:57] myself to him amen God bless you you can
[43:00] have your seats this morning and we're
[43:02] continuing on our series on manifesting
[43:04] time and we're just getting into the the
[43:05] meat of things as we move into this this
[43:07] topic of of adoption I want to take a a
[43:10] single thought as a continuation of our
[43:12] last service and I was driving home on
[43:14] Sunday and this thing just dropped into
[43:15] my mind and I quickly put it in an email
[43:18] to myself so I wouldn't forget it and so
[43:20] I want to take a title this morning of
[43:23] confirmative action now we see today
[43:26] that they have this thing called
[43:27] affirmative action and I know all about
[43:29] this my wife is Hispanic and in the
[43:31] states they have this thing called
[43:32] affirmative action where if you're of a
[43:34] certain race a certain ethnicity a
[43:36] certain background then they give you
[43:38] opportunity based on what you are rather
[43:41] than or who you are rather than what you
[43:43] are in other words they don't give you a
[43:45] scholarship or they don't give you an
[43:46] opportunity because you're the best for
[43:48] that but they give you the opportunity
[43:50] because of how you look or your
[43:51] background or your ethnicity of these
[43:52] things amen so you're given an
[43:54] opportunity regardless of your
[43:56] qualifications or with Le less emphasis
[43:58] on your qualifications but that's not
[44:00] the way God works and so I want to take
[44:01] a bit of a play on words this morning
[44:03] and call this confirmative action and
[44:05] the thought that came to me as I was
[44:06] driving home because we've been been
[44:09] focused on adoption and the thought that
[44:11] came to me is this that adoption is all
[44:15] about conduct it's all about how you act
[44:19] it is the only thing that God's looking
[44:21] at by the time we come to adoption
[44:23] because what you have to have is you
[44:24] have to take what's in your mind you
[44:25] have to take what's in your heart and it
[44:27] has to now be lived in your life and
[44:28] that's what I mean by conduct doesn't
[44:30] mean it's the only thing but in adoption
[44:32] what the father's looking at is how you
[44:35] act how everything you are comes out
[44:37] into your day-to-day life that's what
[44:39] he's concerned with because when you act
[44:41] the way you feel when you act the way
[44:43] you believe when you act according to
[44:45] the word that's inside of you that's
[44:47] when he knows that you're finished work
[44:49] that's when he knows that you're ready
[44:50] for a time of responsibility so when we
[44:52] start talking about conduct people can
[44:54] get real uptight sometimes times because
[44:56] we can get into legalism and how you
[44:58] dress and how you do this and how you do
[44:59] that we're not talking about that this
[45:01] morning we're just talking about the
[45:02] general conduct of a son and we open
[45:05] with John 14 I love John 14 there's so
[45:07] much there there's godhead in there
[45:09] there's predestination there's our
[45:11] purpose on Earth there's the guarantee
[45:12] of the word for the True Believer and
[45:14] all these different things but more than
[45:16] anything it shows us the relationship
[45:18] between the children of God and God
[45:19] himself it shows us our position it
[45:21] shows us our place it shows us his
[45:23] expectations for us and we see here in
[45:26] John 14 it's the key to an overcoming
[45:28] life the key to the overcoming life is
[45:30] the Holy Spirit and without the Holy
[45:32] Spirit we're just Pretenders that that's
[45:34] just where we end up isn't it because
[45:36] when before the Holy Ghost we're
[45:38] believing unto something and here's the
[45:40] thing unless you get it you'll always
[45:41] believing unto and you'll never get it
[45:43] amen you'll never come to a place of uh
[45:46] of overcoming life and we're destined to
[45:47] be miserable because you're always
[45:49] believing for more than you have now
[45:52] here's the thing in a way we're always
[45:53] believing for more than we have because
[45:55] I'm believing for a res resurrection and
[45:56] a Rapture amen I don't have it yet but
[45:58] yet I have the earnest of the
[45:59] resurrection and that's a great comfort
[46:01] to me and it's leading me and it's
[46:02] growing me and it's maturing me and it's
[46:04] maturing all of us into a place where
[46:06] we're going to take a resurrection and a
[46:07] Rapture but Paul knew all about the
[46:09] miserableness of not having the Holy
[46:11] Ghost and he talks about it in Romans 7
[46:14] and he came to an understanding you'll
[46:15] see if you go through Romans 7 Paul
[46:17] thought he lived when he was Saul he
[46:19] thought he lived a perfect life by the
[46:20] law and then when he saw that he
[46:22] couldn't actually meet the requirement
[46:24] of the law it put him in into depression
[46:26] it put him into miserableness it made
[46:28] him wretched because he realized that
[46:30] the thing that he thought had saved him
[46:32] was the thing that condemned him and he
[46:34] got to a place where he recognized that
[46:36] there was this battle inside of him that
[46:38] he couldn't he couldn't win and in
[46:39] Romans 7 and 21 we find Paul says I find
[46:43] then a law that when I would do good
[46:46] evil is present with me now I don't know
[46:49] about you but that goes for me every
[46:51] single day anytime you want to do
[46:52] something right Satan's there to try and
[46:55] what inspire your carnality Inspire your
[46:58] flesh to rise up and refuse to do what
[47:00] the word tells us to do when you want to
[47:01] do the right thing then guess what Satan
[47:03] will put a thought in you to go do the
[47:05] thing that keeps you from doing the
[47:06] right thing it may not be wrong what
[47:08] he's telling you to do but if it holds
[47:10] you back from doing the right thing then
[47:11] that's sin remember script the scripture
[47:14] says that if you know to do good and do
[47:15] a not then that is sin to us and
[47:17] sometimes that's what Satan's trying to
[47:18] do not so much get us to do a bad thing
[47:20] but not get us to do the right thing
[47:22] amen God wants us to do his will amen
[47:25] but then he says for I Delight in the
[47:27] law of God after the inward man amen our
[47:29] desires are to do the right thing can we
[47:31] say that this morning I desire to do the
[47:33] right thing to live right to think right
[47:35] to act right all these different things
[47:37] but Paul says but I see another law in
[47:39] my members Waring against the law of my
[47:42] mind and bringing me into captivity to
[47:44] the law of sin and my members Paul says
[47:47] everything inside of me wants to do
[47:49] right but yet this flesh Rises up and I
[47:52] keep losing the
[47:54] battle Paul was frustrated because he
[47:56] says every time I try and do the right
[47:58] thing this flesh Rises up and it ends up
[48:00] condemning me it ends up getting in my
[48:02] way he says it's bringing me into
[48:05] captivity to the law of sin which is in
[48:07] my members that tells me that my members
[48:09] are there's no good thing in them as
[48:11] Paul said there's nothing in here that I
[48:13] can rely on to take me into the will of
[48:15] God there's got to be something else
[48:16] that happens in my life and he says oh
[48:19] Wretched Man that I am this is what
[48:21] we're talking about without the Holy
[48:22] Ghost you're wretched because you know
[48:24] there's a higher place you know there's
[48:26] a higher place of living but you can't
[48:28] do it he says who shall deliver me from
[48:31] the body of this death see there's this
[48:34] place between realizing that you want to
[48:36] do right and you're unable to do right
[48:38] and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[48:40] that stretch there is
[48:41] miserableness because you want to do
[48:44] what you hear you want to do what you
[48:46] you have preached to you want to do what
[48:48] you read in the scripture but there's in
[48:50] your body no good thing to make it
[48:51] happen and so you need a nature change
[48:53] you need a heart change you need a
[48:55] spirit change change and then you need
[48:56] to be filled with the spirit to bring
[48:58] into production the word that God brings
[49:00] across your way amen so it's a place of
[49:03] wretchedness because you have a desire
[49:04] to do the right thing but you lack the
[49:06] will to do it amen and so you're stuck
[49:09] in the cycle of ups and downs and in and
[49:11] outs brother Brown would preach a
[49:12] message why are people so tossed about
[49:14] what is it they lack an anchor what is
[49:16] it the holy spirit inside of and every
[49:18] one of our Lives amen what is it we have
[49:20] this knowledge we have this
[49:21] understanding we have an open book this
[49:23] morning we have a message that's been
[49:24] given to us and we have so many things
[49:26] in there that tell us how a Believer
[49:28] ought to live and what's available to a
[49:31] believer in their life but do we have it
[49:34] all do we have it all we can be
[49:37] miserable if we never have it but the
[49:39] goal is to get it amen and it comes to a
[49:41] place where we realize that I have no
[49:43] ability in myself to produce the word of
[49:45] God to produce what he wants to do in my
[49:47] life but we're not stuck on being
[49:48] wretched amen this is a series about
[49:50] what it means to manifest the word of
[49:51] God it's for the Overcomer it's for the
[49:53] children of God that are born again by
[49:55] the spirit of God and that live by the
[49:57] power of God in their lives amen but
[49:59] there's nothing in me that can live an
[50:00] overcoming life I'm doomed I'm doomed
[50:03] I'm doomed there's nothing in me that
[50:04] can do
[50:05] it but Paul would say this in First
[50:07] Corinthians he says for the kingdom of
[50:09] God is not in word but in power you got
[50:13] the Amplified says for the kingdom of
[50:15] God consists of and is based not on what
[50:20] talk but on power amen Jesus said the
[50:24] kingdom of God is within you amen so
[50:27] that's what matters is what's within me
[50:29] first and foremost so what we have
[50:31] inside us is not based on what I say or
[50:33] what I think I have but it's got to be
[50:35] based on a power it's got to be R based
[50:38] on a reality of what's inside of me it's
[50:40] got to be God inside of me that makes
[50:42] this whole thing work then Paul will go
[50:43] into second Corinthians and says we have
[50:45] this treasure in Earth and vessels that
[50:47] the Excellency of the power may be of
[50:50] God and not of us amen I think the
[50:52] greatest Revelation that a a young
[50:54] Christian or a new Christian has is that
[50:56] there's no good thing in this there's
[50:59] nothing good in this that can produce
[51:00] the word there's nothing inside of us
[51:02] that is excellent compared to God he
[51:05] says we have it in Earth and vessels in
[51:07] other words we have it in flawed cracked
[51:10] failed vessels so that when something
[51:12] good comes out of it we can say that's
[51:14] got to be him cuz this thing can't do
[51:15] that it's not built for it it takes
[51:17] something greater than us to produce
[51:19] it then Peter would say blessed be the
[51:22] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[51:25] which according to His abundant Mercy
[51:28] amen I'll take Mercy every single day
[51:30] Church according to His abundant Mercy
[51:33] had begotten us again he's born us again
[51:36] unto a lively hope a Living Hope by the
[51:39] resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
[51:41] dead to an inheritance Incorruptible and
[51:44] undefiled and that fadeth not away
[51:46] reserved in heaven for you who are kept
[51:48] how by the power by the power of God
[51:52] through what faith you've got to have
[51:56] faith but it's got to be his power he
[51:58] says unto salvation ready to be revealed
[52:00] in the last time why am I saying this
[52:02] over and over again to help us to see
[52:05] that without the Holy Spirit we are
[52:07] doomed to fail we are doomed to fall we
[52:11] are doomed to wretchedness we're doomed
[52:13] to desperation we're doomed to all these
[52:15] things without the life in C inside of
[52:17] us we'll be just like the priesthood in
[52:18] Jesus day that's all we be remember
[52:21] Jesus said you're like Whited sepers
[52:23] you're like tombs and on the outside
[52:25] they're white and they're bright and
[52:27] they look beautiful you go to some of
[52:28] these cemeteries they have some amazing
[52:29] tombs there beautiful but he says inside
[52:32] you're just full of Dead Man's Bones
[52:34] it's rotness inside the outside looks
[52:36] good but the inside's no good he says
[52:38] therefore the whole thing is rotten
[52:40] because it's just a product of your
[52:42] imagination it's a product of your life
[52:44] it's not a product of a power inside of
[52:46] you it's a religious life and for some
[52:49] that's enough but for the child of God a
[52:51] religious Life Won't satisfy us listen
[52:53] to what brother Bram says he says his
[52:56] character has changed
[52:59] me amen remember last service we talked
[53:01] about the different things that that are
[53:03] in a child that's ready for adoption and
[53:05] one of them was character and that's
[53:07] really the starting point for it this
[53:08] morning he says his character has
[53:10] changed me that means that the character
[53:13] I'm looking for is his amen that the
[53:16] life I live has to be by the character
[53:17] of Christ in me he says when it came to
[53:20] me I was once a sinner and now I'm saved
[53:23] he says I once was lost now I'm f I once
[53:25] loved the things of the world I hate it
[53:27] now I once cared not for God but I love
[53:30] him now something happened to me
[53:32] something happened to you what is it
[53:34] it's God's work declaring his character
[53:37] in each and every one of us he loves us
[53:40] he's interested in your welfare you say
[53:43] brother John I'm just a little believer
[53:44] I'm just a little this and that I'm a
[53:46] little nothing we're all nothings but he
[53:48] says he cares about you he's interested
[53:50] in your welfare he's interested in your
[53:52] healing he's interested in your soul
[53:55] won't you let him have his way in your
[53:56] life don't doubt him for nothing you go
[53:59] believing him and God will give you the
[54:01] desire of your heart for it's his Good
[54:04] Will to do it he longs to do it but the
[54:07] thing of it is he says we get all
[54:10] frustrated stand still now obviously I'm
[54:13] not preaching against the when we talk
[54:15] of conduct this morning I'm not
[54:16] preaching against a a clean life but to
[54:18] the contrary but we're preaching about
[54:20] confirmative action and we see that
[54:22] there's more to just living by the law
[54:25] amen there's a life inside of us because
[54:27] you can live by the law but not want to
[54:29] do it and that is not what we're looking
[54:31] for brother Bram says when his character
[54:33] comes to me which is what the mind of
[54:35] Christ by the Holy Spirit he says I once
[54:38] was lost but now I'm found I once was
[54:40] lost but now I'm saved I used to like
[54:42] the world now I hate it I didn't used to
[54:45] care about him now I love him there has
[54:47] to be a work on the inside and it's the
[54:49] character it's the Life of Christ inside
[54:51] of us that draws us into willingly
[54:53] surrendering to his plan to his purpose
[54:55] to his ways of doing things amen this
[54:57] isn't legalism it's an outward
[54:59] expression of an inward
[55:01] work remember where we started in John
[55:04] 14 it says at that day you'll know me
[55:07] that I am in the father and you and me
[55:08] and I in you he says he says he that had
[55:12] my commandments so first he's got to
[55:14] give them to you you're only responsible
[55:16] for what God gives to you if he gives it
[55:19] to you you're responsible for it amen
[55:21] we're expected to live by what God shows
[55:24] us what you're hearing this morning God
[55:26] will hold you accountable for but if
[55:28] you're not here this morning then it
[55:30] doesn't matter God won't hold you
[55:31] accountable for it he'll hold you
[55:32] accountable for what you see and what
[55:34] you hear he says he that have my
[55:36] Commandments and here's the big thing
[55:39] and keepeth
[55:41] them we can sit here and say we've got a
[55:43] message we've got a message we've got a
[55:44] message what are we doing with it amen
[55:47] what's it doing in US is the big picture
[55:49] it's the big question he says he it is
[55:52] that loveth me Jesus said if you love me
[55:54] keep my Commandments
[55:55] he says and he that loveth me shall be
[55:57] loved to my father and I will love him
[55:59] and I will manifest myself to him Jesus
[56:02] is saying I've told you what I expect
[56:05] I've taught you I've showed you I've
[56:06] given you an example and now I expect
[56:09] you to have a life that matches what
[56:10] I've told you amen we've got to we've
[56:13] got to see that the revealing the key to
[56:15] the revealing of God in each of us is
[56:17] not just that he gives us his word but
[56:20] that we keep his word that he gives us
[56:23] the giving is not the proof
[56:26] it's the keeping that's the
[56:27] proof right many heard him willingly but
[56:30] how many were there on the day of
[56:32] Pentecost Lots were there to get fed by
[56:34] the Loaves and the fishes but how many
[56:36] went up to the room in Pentecost how
[56:38] many turned their backs on them brother
[56:40] banam he had the sign in the hand and
[56:41] then he had the discernment and then he
[56:43] had these different things but under the
[56:44] opening of the word everybody bailed on
[56:46] him what they had the word but they
[56:48] couldn't keep the word there was nothing
[56:49] in them to hold them to it amen our
[56:51] lives are proof for God the father's
[56:54] looking for how we act not just how we
[56:56] speak if I can put it that way if our
[56:59] lives don't match our confession then
[57:01] there's something wrong there's a
[57:02] disconnect somewhere and we've got to
[57:04] grow up we've got to come into a greater
[57:05] maturity amen the holy spirit's here to
[57:07] bring what's in our heart out of our
[57:10] Lives that's what he's trying to do is
[57:11] take it from here and bring it out so
[57:13] people can see it listen I can say all
[57:15] day long I love broccoli and you'll all
[57:17] know I'm lying why because I don't eat
[57:21] it it's that simple we can say we love
[57:24] God but if I never eat it we can say we
[57:27] love his word but if we never eat it we
[57:29] can say we love the preaching of the
[57:30] word but if we're never in church what
[57:31] does that tell us we don't love it
[57:34] because we're not eating it we're not
[57:36] doing it brother Braham says if you
[57:37] believed it you do
[57:38] it so if you believe it then you'll what
[57:41] you'll take action on what you're
[57:43] hearing Jesus is saying you love say he
[57:45] says saying you love my word is not
[57:47] enough you got to do it you got to take
[57:49] it and you got to put it into your life
[57:51] remember he told that parable of the two
[57:52] boys and the father says go work work in
[57:55] my Vineyard and one says no and one says
[57:58] yes but the one says yes I'll do it
[58:00] didn't go do it and the one that says no
[58:01] I won't went and did it and Jesus said
[58:03] which one loved his father the Saucy one
[58:06] that refused but then went and did it he
[58:08] said because in the end he did the will
[58:10] of the father he was rebellious to start
[58:12] but he surrendered to the will of the
[58:13] Father the other one said yes I'll do it
[58:15] he had a great thing coming out of his
[58:17] mouth but his heart wasn't in it and he
[58:18] didn't go do what the father
[58:20] said but we're considering this thought
[58:23] that adoption is all about conduct and
[58:24] when we opened up in John 14 it shows us
[58:27] what God has for us but I want to take
[58:29] us back to to the Old Testament and we
[58:31] know the Old Testament is law it's not
[58:33] Grace but let's let's understand this
[58:36] that just because we're under grace
[58:37] doesn't give us license to sit at home
[58:39] on the couch and do nothing and sit here
[58:42] and say well I'm poor me I have this I'm
[58:44] that I have this sickness I have this
[58:45] failing I have this natural weakness I
[58:47] have this no no no Grace is here to
[58:49] cover those things while God does a work
[58:51] to take them out of our Lives amen we
[58:53] don't sit here with excuses that's
[58:55] disgrace the grace is here to cover us
[58:57] until we can come to the place that God
[58:58] wants us to be amen God's all about
[59:01] changing us that's what the Holy Ghost
[59:03] is his power to produce a son or a
[59:05] daughter of God but look at what they
[59:07] could do to a son this is Deuteronomy 21
[59:10] church I'm so glad I don't live under
[59:12] the law I'm glad that his mercies are
[59:14] new Every Morning Deuteronomy 21 says if
[59:17] a man have a stubborn and rebellious son
[59:20] which will not obey the voice of his
[59:21] father or the voice of his mother and
[59:24] that when they have hasten him will not
[59:25] hearken unto them then shall his father
[59:27] and his mother lay hold on him and bring
[59:30] him out under the Elders of his City and
[59:32] under the Gate of his place and they'll
[59:34] say unto the Elders of this city our son
[59:36] is stubborn and rebellious he will not
[59:38] obey our voice he's a glutton and a
[59:40] drunker he won't listen he never listens
[59:43] there's nothing good in
[59:46] him can you
[59:48] imagine can you imagine maybe 21 22
[59:52] years old and your parents drag you
[59:54] kicking and screaming to the gate of the
[59:56] city and their public confession is he's
[59:59] no
[1:00:01] good this is the
[1:00:03] law it says and all the men of his City
[1:00:06] shall Stone him with stones that he die
[1:00:09] so shalt thou put evil away from among
[1:00:12] you and all Israel shall hear and
[1:00:16] fear that's what the law looks
[1:00:21] like you know sometimes we do that
[1:00:26] somebody messes up somebody does
[1:00:29] something what do we say they're no good
[1:00:33] there's no pattern of good works there
[1:00:35] waste of time waste of energy God
[1:00:39] doesn't waste his time on us and yet he
[1:00:41] come back to us time and time and time
[1:00:43] again when I fail when I mess up and he
[1:00:45] comes back and he keeps drawing me back
[1:00:46] that's why I love to be under grace but
[1:00:48] sometimes our actions don't reflect
[1:00:50] Grace the same way does it let's not be
[1:00:52] quick to put people out
[1:00:55] amen Saul was a persecutor of the
[1:00:58] church and his purpose was to be the
[1:01:01] prophet to the age amen God can turn
[1:01:04] anything around amen let's be careful of
[1:01:06] what we do but they bring that son in
[1:01:08] front of the elders and they'd say his
[1:01:10] conduct does not reflect our
[1:01:12] expectations we've done everything we've
[1:01:14] done we can we put everything we can
[1:01:16] we've had patience we've tried and we've
[1:01:18] tried and we've taught and we've taught
[1:01:20] and we've taken them to counseling we've
[1:01:21] taken them to the priest and we've
[1:01:23] spoken to the ministry and we've laid
[1:01:24] hands on him and we've done everything
[1:01:26] and nothing has changed he's a drunkard
[1:01:28] and a
[1:01:29] glutton and they killed him there and
[1:01:31] why did they do that so that the next in
[1:01:34] line could step in to the position of
[1:01:36] authority in the family because you put
[1:01:38] a drunkard and a glutton in in authority
[1:01:41] and what will he do he'll do everything
[1:01:42] selfish it's all about him he won't do
[1:01:44] anything for anybody else he's inwardly
[1:01:47] focused and that would destroy the
[1:01:48] family so for the sake of the family and
[1:01:50] for the sake sake of the tribe they kill
[1:01:52] that boy so that the next one in line
[1:01:54] could take the position in in terms of
[1:01:56] the The
[1:01:58] Inheritance now we're talking about
[1:01:59] conduct this morning and I want you to
[1:02:01] understand the first thing is that
[1:02:02] conduct reflects
[1:02:04] character amen you can't say I've got
[1:02:06] character that's good and then your life
[1:02:08] is bad it doesn't work that way the way
[1:02:11] you act and the way you live shows what
[1:02:12] your character is remember character is
[1:02:14] an inner work amen it's the real you
[1:02:17] it's your real thoughts it's your real
[1:02:18] desires it's the it's the tress inside
[1:02:21] of you and we can hide it and we can put
[1:02:23] up a facade or around it but in the end
[1:02:25] what happens is our conduct is the outer
[1:02:28] expression of our inner character
[1:02:30] conduct proves character amen it's your
[1:02:33] inner person being expressed on the
[1:02:34] outward side of things listen to what
[1:02:36] brother Bram says he says notice when
[1:02:38] the child was born he was a son that's
[1:02:41] relationship you're you're you're a son
[1:02:43] nothing changes that you're born to your
[1:02:45] father and your mother he says but his
[1:02:48] conduct had to do with his inheritance
[1:02:50] now inheritance is position son is
[1:02:53] relationship but inheritance is position
[1:02:55] he says now I want you to be real honest
[1:02:57] now don't you think we've tried to push
[1:03:00] the inheritance just a little bit
[1:03:01] further than our conduct went we're
[1:03:04] looking inwardly this morning this is a
[1:03:06] rubber meets the road sermon in other
[1:03:08] words he's saying don't you think we're
[1:03:09] trying to claim more than we've
[1:03:12] lived are we claiming we're in a certain
[1:03:15] position but our life doesn't really
[1:03:17] show we're in that position we want all
[1:03:19] the benefits we want all the authority
[1:03:21] we want all the recognition but our life
[1:03:23] doesn't quite queue up with where we're
[1:03:25] supposed to
[1:03:27] be he says that's what's the matter
[1:03:29] today we should be on way on up the road
[1:03:32] Yonder but we're B way back down here
[1:03:35] why he says it's been our conduct we
[1:03:38] have no respects respects for what the
[1:03:43] father's will the father's purpose the
[1:03:45] father's plan amen the full word amen we
[1:03:49] we we've got a nation we've got a world
[1:03:51] of selective hearers today don't we well
[1:03:54] what they want the scripture says
[1:03:55] they'll Heap to themselves teachers
[1:03:56] having itching ears that'll just tell us
[1:03:58] what we want to hear rather than what we
[1:04:00] need to hear Paul said I have not I have
[1:04:03] not uh shun to declare the full counsel
[1:04:05] of God to you selective hearers want
[1:04:08] what affirmation or encouragement only
[1:04:11] you're good where you're at rather than
[1:04:12] the correction of raising us up to a
[1:04:14] higher level amen no respects he says
[1:04:17] that's our problem it's been our conduct
[1:04:19] we have no respects he says when that
[1:04:21] son was born into the family he was a
[1:04:23] son at Birth
[1:04:24] but his inheritance was not yet
[1:04:26] determined it depended on his character
[1:04:30] so though being a son and if he was a
[1:04:32] disobedient son he would not inherit
[1:04:34] anything but still he was a son that's
[1:04:37] the grace of God and me that's
[1:04:39] predestination as though you may not
[1:04:40] come into adoption yet you'll never lose
[1:04:42] your relationship he says but if he was
[1:04:45] an obedient son he was heir to all
[1:04:47] things and we've been taught that when
[1:04:49] we're born again we're sons of God catch
[1:04:52] that when are we born again church not
[1:04:55] at baptism not at repentance when we get
[1:04:58] the Holy Ghost brother B says he's
[1:05:00] saying we've been taught that when we
[1:05:02] get the Holy Ghost we're sons of God he
[1:05:04] says that's true but that's just the
[1:05:07] beginning then he says it's your
[1:05:10] character from then on what makes the
[1:05:12] diff What means the difference so we
[1:05:14] can't claim to have the character in The
[1:05:16] Life of Christ if our life doesn't
[1:05:18] actually show these things amen this is
[1:05:20] what adoption is all about is when our
[1:05:22] lives match our confession our
[1:05:24] profession our expression amen whatever
[1:05:27] is coming out of our mouth matches up
[1:05:29] with what's in our lives amen when what
[1:05:31] we say we believe is what we live day by
[1:05:33] day when our decisions in every part of
[1:05:35] our Lives match what what the word says
[1:05:38] amen it's a day-to-day thing it's an
[1:05:41] everyday thing not just the church
[1:05:43] Sunday and Wednesday thing listen to
[1:05:46] what Jesus said this is after after he
[1:05:48] meets the woman at the well in Samaria
[1:05:50] and Jesus sath unto them my meat is to
[1:05:53] do the will of him that sent me into to
[1:05:55] finish his work the Amplified says Jesus
[1:05:57] said to them my food my nourishment is
[1:05:59] to do the will the pleasure of him who
[1:06:01] sent me and to accomplish and completely
[1:06:04] finish his work Jesus said my daily food
[1:06:08] is to do the will of
[1:06:10] God how often do we need food now we
[1:06:14] might make it away a day or two or three
[1:06:16] or four without
[1:06:18] food but really we need food every
[1:06:21] single day and Jesus said my food my
[1:06:24] nourishment is to do the will of my
[1:06:25] father you know what that tells me if
[1:06:28] that's our meat then that ought to be a
[1:06:30] day-to-day thing is that we wake up and
[1:06:32] we say God what is your plan and your
[1:06:35] purpose for me today I'll tell you
[1:06:37] church I've been changing the way I pray
[1:06:39] in the mornings it just feels like
[1:06:41] there's a focus there's a narrowness
[1:06:42] that's coming down and that narrowness
[1:06:44] is Lord what do you want me to do today
[1:06:48] don't let me just bumble around Amen to
[1:06:51] recognize that I'm a Son of God to
[1:06:53] recognize that you're Sons and Daughters
[1:06:55] of God and that you have a purpose to be
[1:06:57] here and it's not just to make a living
[1:06:59] it's not just to go to work it's not
[1:07:01] just to go to school it's not just to
[1:07:03] raise your kids but it is to be the
[1:07:05] embodiment of the word that people can
[1:07:07] see and so be quick to grasp the
[1:07:11] opportunities you know I went last night
[1:07:13] and and someone from the homeschooling
[1:07:15] group uh the the the man's wife told
[1:07:17] blona that Jonathan and I could go play
[1:07:19] hockey and I honestly wasn't really
[1:07:21] wanting to play last night I was tired
[1:07:23] out and whatnot but I told my wife that
[1:07:25] and she said oh I think you should go
[1:07:26] and I said no I'm going to go why
[1:07:28] because I might get an opportunity to
[1:07:30] witness that's the reason I went was not
[1:07:33] to go play hockey the reason I went is
[1:07:35] because that's a group of professing
[1:07:36] Christians there that I might have a
[1:07:38] positive influence on that I might be
[1:07:40] able to witness to them of something
[1:07:42] that they haven't received yet that's
[1:07:44] the reason to do it and I find that's
[1:07:46] the way my prayer is this these days is
[1:07:48] say Lord what would you have me to do
[1:07:51] and help me to be quick to catch what's
[1:07:53] happening in the moment
[1:07:54] to be quick to speak to be quick to
[1:07:56] respond to have an answer for the hope
[1:07:58] that lies within us amen we're not just
[1:08:00] bumbling around this world where lights
[1:08:02] where cities on a Hilltop we ass salt
[1:08:05] that the people need amen every single
[1:08:09] day I've got to be seeking the will of
[1:08:12] God every single day you've got to be
[1:08:13] seeking the will of God Lord help me to
[1:08:15] reflect you today that's what we want to
[1:08:18] be we're getting so close church when
[1:08:20] the last one comes in we can get out of
[1:08:22] here amen I want the last one to come in
[1:08:25] so I can get out of here and if he can
[1:08:27] use me then let him use me let me not be
[1:08:29] bumbling around but let me be quick to
[1:08:31] hear what the spirit saying quick to
[1:08:33] understand what's happening in a
[1:08:34] situation that we can get the last ones
[1:08:37] in remember this ought to be a continual
[1:08:39] thing seeking the will of God remember
[1:08:41] the scripture says they that are as many
[1:08:42] as are led by the spirit of God they are
[1:08:45] the sons of God that's a daily thing
[1:08:48] that's not just a a here a bit or there
[1:08:50] a bit but every day God's got a
[1:08:52] leadership for his children I believe
[1:08:54] and it's a character inside of us that
[1:08:56] seeks the will of God only that's what
[1:08:58] Jesus said I do only what the father
[1:09:00] shows me and he spent his time seeking
[1:09:04] the father's will that's how he spent
[1:09:06] his time he sought the will and then he
[1:09:07] did the will and then he went and sought
[1:09:09] the will and he did the will day in day
[1:09:11] out without any changing amen that's
[1:09:14] that charact that's where our character
[1:09:15] comes from is when I lay down who I am
[1:09:18] what I am what I think what I want and I
[1:09:19] say Lord what would you have me to do
[1:09:22] today Lord I'm reporting for
[1:09:24] Duty like good soldiers I'm reporting
[1:09:27] for Duty what would you have me to do
[1:09:29] today that's the character of Christ is
[1:09:31] to seek the will of God brother say this
[1:09:33] he says all scriptures dovetail together
[1:09:35] that's Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:09:38] today and forever he says let's watch
[1:09:40] the type of person he was let's look at
[1:09:42] his character and watch his ministry and
[1:09:44] as he worked then he works now okay
[1:09:46] catch that as he worked then he works
[1:09:48] now as he was then he is now and will be
[1:09:51] forever and just what he did in them
[1:09:53] days he'll do it today he'll be just the
[1:09:55] same forever he's the same Jesus
[1:09:58] yesterday today and forever the same
[1:10:00] type of
[1:10:01] character so that's what we ought to be
[1:10:04] we ought to be just like him that's what
[1:10:06] the adopted Sons and Daughters of God
[1:10:08] will look like and he confirms it he
[1:10:10] says a man that professes to be a
[1:10:12] Christian must have a Christlike nature
[1:10:15] if it isn't there's another nature there
[1:10:18] which isn't Christlike he says if I told
[1:10:20] you the spirit of Christ was in me I
[1:10:22] must act like Jesus you must act like
[1:10:25] Jesus your character and conduct must be
[1:10:27] bolded like that catch that your
[1:10:30] character and your conduct must be
[1:10:35] molded molding means you're not in your
[1:10:39] final condition you're not in your final
[1:10:42] shape we won't be till we
[1:10:44] go we're all a work in
[1:10:47] progress amen from the old to the young
[1:10:50] we're all a work in
[1:10:52] progress he said says your character and
[1:10:54] conduct must be molded like that he says
[1:10:57] and the Holy Spirit molds that conduct
[1:10:59] when he comes into you when you're
[1:11:00] really born again of the spirit of God
[1:11:02] and you'll see this time and time again
[1:11:03] throughout the message that brother BR
[1:11:05] would tie conduct and character together
[1:11:08] they're a match pair you can't divorce
[1:11:10] them you can't divorce your conduct from
[1:11:11] your character or other ways your
[1:11:13] conduct ultimately shows your character
[1:11:16] now you can live a religious life but
[1:11:18] what happens is when the squeeze comes
[1:11:20] when the pressure comes when the money
[1:11:22] starts to go out when your health starts
[1:11:24] to go when your relationships start to
[1:11:25] fall away when your church offends you
[1:11:27] when these different things happen what
[1:11:29] happens is that your real nature comes
[1:11:31] out and that's when you find out I've
[1:11:35] got it or I don't got it that's when God
[1:11:38] finds out God knows all along but that's
[1:11:41] the report card that he gets he failed
[1:11:44] that test she passed that
[1:11:48] test right it's when the rubber hits the
[1:11:51] road when things get Twi tight
[1:11:54] that's when character comes out day to
[1:11:56] day when everything's perfect money's in
[1:11:57] the bank Health's great church is great
[1:11:59] everything's great that doesn't take
[1:12:00] character doesn't take character to do
[1:12:03] that but now when things come and you
[1:12:04] got to make a decision and you got to
[1:12:06] choose between what your flesh wants and
[1:12:08] what the spirit of God wants that's when
[1:12:09] character shows that shows who's really
[1:12:11] in charge inside of us that shows what
[1:12:13] we really believe what we really want
[1:12:15] what we really think is in those times
[1:12:17] of testing brother BR would say oh if we
[1:12:19] are the sons and daughters of the king
[1:12:21] the king of kings let's conduct our care
[1:12:23] character as
[1:12:25] Christians that's right yes we are
[1:12:27] aliens we're pilgrims and we're
[1:12:28] strangers here this is not our world
[1:12:31] we're seeking a kingdom that is to come
[1:12:33] this is not our home and though we be
[1:12:35] tossed about and made fun of by the
[1:12:37] world and called this that and the other
[1:12:39] in old fashioned and all like that what
[1:12:40] do you care you don't want to be
[1:12:42] patterning yourself after some kind of a
[1:12:44] movie star or some television star or
[1:12:46] something you're a daughter of God
[1:12:48] you're a Son of God let's act like God
[1:12:51] we are the children of God we know and
[1:12:53] we are Sons and Daughters of the king
[1:12:55] let our character reflect what his
[1:12:59] presence no matter how rough it gets I
[1:13:02] was reading that last night and I just
[1:13:03] threw my hands up and I started to cry
[1:13:05] and I said Lord let my life reflect your
[1:13:09] presence let my life reflect the fact
[1:13:12] that I am a temple of the Living God and
[1:13:14] let that be what shines out of my life
[1:13:16] on a day-by-day basis amen I almost
[1:13:19] named this service the conduct of his
[1:13:22] presence it just jumped out of me so
[1:13:24] much we are the Temple of the Living God
[1:13:26] church and if it's there then what ought
[1:13:29] Our Lives to be on a daily basis on a
[1:13:31] moment by moment of basis amen the key
[1:13:33] to character is not just reading your
[1:13:36] Bible the key to character is not just
[1:13:38] praying the key to character is that his
[1:13:41] presence is in your life and that is
[1:13:44] overcome you remember we I'll get to it
[1:13:48] in a little
[1:13:49] bit character comes by what being in his
[1:13:53] Pres presence and his word being
[1:13:54] quickened to your life making it live
[1:13:58] that's what character is
[1:14:00] amen it's not enough anymore Church to
[1:14:03] say God you know my
[1:14:04] heart we're coming into
[1:14:07] adoption and that means what's in your
[1:14:09] heart has to come out into your life
[1:14:12] amen day-to-day Life by what we do by
[1:14:14] what we say how we spend our time the
[1:14:16] decisions we make the words we say all
[1:14:17] of these things it all feeds into that
[1:14:19] report card that God is Reading in our
[1:14:22] lives he'd say this back in the Old
[1:14:24] Testament when a father owned a big
[1:14:26] Kingdom and a child was born into that
[1:14:27] Kingdom he was a son as soon as he was
[1:14:29] born he would be air of all the father
[1:14:32] he would be heir of all the father had
[1:14:34] if his character was right he says but
[1:14:38] first his character had to be proved he
[1:14:41] says now you ministers know where I'm
[1:14:42] going to it's the placing of a son now
[1:14:44] notice he says he's got to have the
[1:14:46] right character and then the character's
[1:14:49] got to be proved so the first thing that
[1:14:51] happens is the character has to be put
[1:14:52] in and that's the desire that's the will
[1:14:55] but then what has to come in there is
[1:14:57] power to prove that character which is
[1:14:59] that you live what is really inside of
[1:15:01] you he says before we can be heir of all
[1:15:04] things before you can step into your
[1:15:06] position in the body of Christ your
[1:15:08] character has to be proved how by your
[1:15:11] conduct that's the proof of your
[1:15:13] character is your conduct the evidence
[1:15:15] that you've got character is your life
[1:15:19] how you live your life the decisions you
[1:15:21] make and all of these different things
[1:15:22] you can't divorce the two things your
[1:15:24] character and your conduct are exactly
[1:15:25] the same thing brother BR would say this
[1:15:27] that's your character your conduct so
[1:15:30] you can't sit here and say my life is a
[1:15:32] wreck but I've got good character it
[1:15:34] doesn't work that way I've got good
[1:15:36] character but my family's a mess no you
[1:15:38] don't I've got good character but I keep
[1:15:40] making the wrong decisions no you
[1:15:43] don't the conduct you live is the
[1:15:45] character you have doesn't mean you're
[1:15:48] not believing for more doesn't mean you
[1:15:49] don't want more but it hasn't solidified
[1:15:52] itself it hasn't anchored itself inside
[1:15:53] of us amen church this is rubber meets
[1:15:55] the road I'm sorry amen but this is
[1:15:57] where it's at is does our life remember
[1:15:59] we talked about does our life cope with
[1:16:01] our confession we talked about that last
[1:16:03] service the child was coming up and when
[1:16:06] he was young perhaps the duor would come
[1:16:07] to the father and we do with our kids so
[1:16:09] many times don't we well he's got a good
[1:16:12] heart and he's trying so hard and that's
[1:16:15] that's okay when they're young because
[1:16:17] there's a real molding that's happening
[1:16:19] there and they're coming into a new way
[1:16:20] of thinking and a new way of acting
[1:16:22] because remember we're all born in sin
[1:16:23] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[1:16:25] seeking lies we're all selfish it's just
[1:16:26] some of us are more selfish than others
[1:16:29] amen I look at my kids and I can
[1:16:30] definitely see that our youngest is the
[1:16:32] most selfish that we've ever had there's
[1:16:35] a lot more molding that's happening to
[1:16:37] him but there has to come a time where
[1:16:41] the tutor doesn't just say he has a good
[1:16:43] heart or she has a good heart but the
[1:16:45] father wants to know well how does she
[1:16:48] act I I I appreciate she's got a good
[1:16:50] heart but how is that translating into
[1:16:52] how she acts
[1:16:53] how's that translating into the
[1:16:54] decisions she makes how's that
[1:16:56] translating into his friendships how's
[1:16:58] that translating into how he spends his
[1:16:59] time what does his heart look like now
[1:17:02] in terms of his day-to-day life because
[1:17:05] the actions have to come into line with
[1:17:06] our professions amen the father has to
[1:17:09] come to a place where he trusts us to do
[1:17:11] the right thing not just know the right
[1:17:13] thing to do amen knowing to do the right
[1:17:17] thing is not the same as doing the right
[1:17:19] thing that's just knowledge and if you
[1:17:21] don't do it it'll it'll destroy you but
[1:17:24] to know to do it and to do it that's
[1:17:26] what the that's what the father's
[1:17:27] looking for and then that what's in the
[1:17:29] heart has to become the life and until
[1:17:31] we get to that point we're not going to
[1:17:32] come into adoption because our conduct
[1:17:34] has to be reflective of the nature of
[1:17:36] Christ inside of us not just the words
[1:17:38] that we can we can pair it out about
[1:17:39] what the word says about a
[1:17:41] situation let's live what the word says
[1:17:43] about the situation not just talk about
[1:17:45] it Jesus would say this this people
[1:17:49] draweth nigh unto me with their mouth
[1:17:51] and honth me with their lips but their
[1:17:52] hearts far from me in other words what
[1:17:54] we say doesn't mean anything to
[1:17:57] God what we do matters to God that's our
[1:18:03] proof watch what brother Braham says he
[1:18:05] says and now when this duty of this
[1:18:07] teacher of raising the son was to bring
[1:18:09] the word to the father how he progressed
[1:18:12] he says and his conduct determined his
[1:18:16] inheritance now what's our portion there
[1:18:19] our conduct and what's God's portion
[1:18:23] inheritance he makes the decision to
[1:18:25] give us the inheritance when our conduct
[1:18:28] lines up with his expectations he says
[1:18:30] if he was a good son he would inherit
[1:18:32] all the father had if he wasn't a good
[1:18:34] son then he got nothing he wasn't worthy
[1:18:37] yet he was a son and just because now
[1:18:40] catch this church this is this is as we
[1:18:43] go into adoption later Services remember
[1:18:45] this just because you have received the
[1:18:48] Holy Spirit that doesn't mean that
[1:18:50] everything's just going to be poured
[1:18:52] into your hand
[1:18:53] in other words you don't get GI wrapped
[1:18:55] everything that God has for you remember
[1:18:57] that quote where brother Braham says he
[1:18:58] says he says everything you get you have
[1:19:01] to fight for he says just get the Holy
[1:19:04] Ghost once and you'll find that out you
[1:19:06] got to fight for every step that you
[1:19:10] take now remember brother Bram saying
[1:19:12] here receiving the Holy Spirit doesn't
[1:19:14] mean you get everything handed to you
[1:19:17] you know what that means the holy
[1:19:18] getting the Holy Spirit doesn't mean
[1:19:20] you're automatically in a position of
[1:19:21] adoption you you got to prove yourself
[1:19:24] amen character is a victory he said and
[1:19:27] a victory means there's got to be a
[1:19:29] battle and there's got to be an action
[1:19:31] and the action has to be the right
[1:19:33] action and that proves that you've got
[1:19:34] character amen there has to be an event
[1:19:37] that happens as we said before when the
[1:19:39] marriage drains away your or when your
[1:19:41] money drains away your health falters
[1:19:43] your marriage is struggling Works
[1:19:44] pushing God out your pastor Falls your
[1:19:46] church offends you whatever it is you've
[1:19:48] got to win the Victory and the Victory
[1:19:50] Is Over You not over the other one see
[1:19:55] that's the thing we forget character is
[1:19:57] about winning the battle Over Me Not
[1:19:59] Over You amen somebody offends me
[1:20:03] character is when I what win the battle
[1:20:06] over me not over them that's what we'll
[1:20:08] see in adoption is that so many people
[1:20:09] think adoption is outward facing
[1:20:11] adoption first is inward facing and the
[1:20:13] greatest thing we've got to defeat is
[1:20:15] ourselves that's the real victory that
[1:20:17] we've got to receive amen remember we
[1:20:19] read that quote where brother Bram said
[1:20:21] you've been able to conquer yourself and
[1:20:23] commit yourself to Christ you see to
[1:20:25] humble yourself before him that's really
[1:20:28] power see so often we think we're
[1:20:30] fighting demons and sicknesses and
[1:20:32] principalities and Powers we are but
[1:20:35] first we got to defeat
[1:20:37] ourselves first thing I've got to beats
[1:20:39] John
[1:20:40] klette and when he dies and he's
[1:20:43] defeated now that's somebody that God
[1:20:45] can use but that takes humility and it
[1:20:47] takes a real hard honest look in the
[1:20:49] mirror of the word to see where I'm at
[1:20:52] amen and we've got to be open to
[1:20:53] correction we've got to be open to
[1:20:55] change we've got to be open to coming to
[1:20:57] a higher level we've got to come to the
[1:20:59] place where it's on Christ the solid
[1:21:01] rock I stand not on me there's nothing
[1:21:04] in me that's going to do this so I don't
[1:21:07] believe that a person can just flat out
[1:21:08] say when I get the Holy Ghost I'm
[1:21:09] adopted because brother Bram just said
[1:21:11] when you get the new birth not
[1:21:12] everything's handed to you adoption is
[1:21:15] when you get the
[1:21:16] keys when you get Authority he says but
[1:21:19] you don't get that you got to be proofed
[1:21:21] first there's something that's got to
[1:21:22] happen because otherwise what do we do
[1:21:24] we'll
[1:21:25] presume and that's to venture without
[1:21:28] Authority and what happens is we fall
[1:21:30] flat on our face because we said
[1:21:31] something or we did something that
[1:21:33] wasn't the will of God and God can't
[1:21:35] back it up that's it it's that simple
[1:21:39] church this is I'm preaching it as
[1:21:40] straight as I can this morning because I
[1:21:42] don't want any excuses and I don't want
[1:21:44] any misunderstandings if we presume God
[1:21:47] won't back us up and you'll find the
[1:21:50] adopted son comes to the place where he
[1:21:52] captures the the vision and the plan of
[1:21:53] the father not himself and so the only
[1:21:56] thing that matters is what is God's
[1:21:59] will brother Brown would say this he
[1:22:01] says that's the reason the church he
[1:22:02] says that's the reason if the church
[1:22:04] would get quiet just a little bit what
[1:22:08] quiet mean listen instead of
[1:22:11] talking right sit still instead of
[1:22:13] running
[1:22:15] around and wait instead of getting up
[1:22:17] and leaving without an
[1:22:19] answer that's all he wants us to do if
[1:22:22] we're looking for his will I don't need
[1:22:25] to talk except to say Lord I'm here to
[1:22:28] find your will that's it and stay there
[1:22:31] until he gives it don't presume don't
[1:22:34] run around don't say I'm adopted son I'm
[1:22:36] adopted daughter I just need to no no no
[1:22:38] find his will and then speak the word
[1:22:40] remember what the what the what brother
[1:22:42] Brown would say he'd say she will have
[1:22:44] thus sayeth the Lord or she will stay
[1:22:47] silent amen that's a position of
[1:22:49] adoption hold to God's unchanging hand
[1:22:52] let him make the decision and then you
[1:22:54] walk in faith in what he tells you to do
[1:22:56] he says that's the reason if the church
[1:22:57] would just get quiet just a little bit
[1:23:00] and quit trying to say I'm assembly I'm
[1:23:02] a Oneness I'm a trinitarian I'm this I'm
[1:23:04] that and the other now you think that's
[1:23:06] outside of this message Church you're
[1:23:08] wrong we've got people saying today well
[1:23:10] you don't believe what my pastor
[1:23:11] preaches you don't preach it the way my
[1:23:13] pastor preaches you don't agree with my
[1:23:15] pastor you don't preach it this way
[1:23:16] brother you don't do it that way brother
[1:23:18] and what do we do we've got a bunch of
[1:23:20] denominations come on got a bunch of
[1:23:23] denominations rallying around men
[1:23:25] instead of what stepping back and
[1:23:26] realizing this is the body of Christ and
[1:23:29] if we can look at it through the Eternal
[1:23:31] way of God's looking we'd see that this
[1:23:33] is a body not a bunch of individual
[1:23:35] churches we're forgetting that we're all
[1:23:37] one we've been baptized into one body by
[1:23:40] one spirit and I don't care who your
[1:23:42] pastor is if you've got the Holy Ghost
[1:23:44] you're going to make it regardless of
[1:23:46] what another Pastor another preacher
[1:23:47] another brother another sister might say
[1:23:50] church we got to keep our eyes on him
[1:23:54] brother says your
[1:23:56] christs so in other words don't put
[1:23:58] other people in or out and don't put
[1:24:00] yourself in or out in that way don't
[1:24:02] identify yourself with a group don't
[1:24:04] identify yourself with a Doctrine don't
[1:24:06] identify yourself with an idea you're
[1:24:08] Christ you're bought with a price amen
[1:24:11] Look to Him He says you're Christ and
[1:24:14] the purchase of his blood he says you've
[1:24:16] got no right to break fellowship with
[1:24:18] people like
[1:24:21] that no right to break fellowship with
[1:24:24] people based on what they
[1:24:31] preach come
[1:24:33] on church I'm going to hit it because I
[1:24:36] hate it I hate it I hate it I hate it
[1:24:40] people tearing apart churches because
[1:24:43] they can't give somebody Grace to grow
[1:24:44] the way God gave them Grace to grow and
[1:24:46] the way somebody else gave them the same
[1:24:47] Grace to
[1:24:48] grow half the time is just a
[1:24:50] misunderstanding anyways they believe
[1:24:53] the exact same thing but he says you've
[1:24:55] got no right to break fellowships with
[1:24:57] people unless they're living the wrong
[1:25:01] Life Church we can only live as high as
[1:25:04] God's raised us I can't make myself a
[1:25:07] greater Son of God than I am you can't
[1:25:09] make yourself anything greater we've got
[1:25:11] to live as God grows us my trust is that
[1:25:13] he'll get me where I need to be and
[1:25:16] he'll get you where you need to be he
[1:25:18] says we got no right to break
[1:25:20] fellowships with people like that unless
[1:25:22] they're living the wrong life draw any
[1:25:24] fences or
[1:25:26] barriers now people say well if they're
[1:25:28] off the word what then sometimes they
[1:25:30] just haven't come to the place you're at
[1:25:34] yet I I've been preaching for nine years
[1:25:38] I go talk to a minister that's been
[1:25:39] preaching for 40 guess what he's going
[1:25:41] to know and believe things I haven't
[1:25:43] even comprehended yet does that mean I'm
[1:25:45] out because I don't understand it the
[1:25:48] way he does no has nothing to do with it
[1:25:51] but we draw lines based on our ideas of
[1:25:54] what we ought to have right now and
[1:25:56] where we ought to be we can't do that he
[1:25:59] says we're all one in Christ Jesus for
[1:26:01] by one Spirit we're all baptized into
[1:26:03] one body the body of Believers so
[1:26:07] character produces conduct and conduct
[1:26:10] reflects character brother Brown would
[1:26:11] say conduct is character that's it it's
[1:26:14] that simple your action speak louder
[1:26:16] than your words your life is proof of
[1:26:18] your character period end of story you
[1:26:20] can sit there and testify all day long
[1:26:22] about what you believe and what you know
[1:26:23] and what you have and what you don't
[1:26:24] have all I'm going to look at is your
[1:26:26] life that's that it's that simple and
[1:26:28] that's all that God's looking at God
[1:26:30] doesn't do a halfway job by giving us
[1:26:32] the truth and then not giving us the
[1:26:33] life behind it amen it's supposed to be
[1:26:36] a Living Word not just an intellectual
[1:26:38] word because if it's really in our heart
[1:26:40] it's got to come out into our life
[1:26:42] otherwise we'll get it wrong every time
[1:26:43] if it stays in our head that's what the
[1:26:45] priesthood had in Jesus day and they
[1:26:47] missed the word by A Thousand Miles they
[1:26:49] missed the Living
[1:26:50] Word and what they do he says you're of
[1:26:52] your father the devil that's where they
[1:26:55] ended up what was all this training
[1:26:58] for the the the father that tutor that
[1:27:00] had the son tutor what was all the
[1:27:01] checking up about what were all the
[1:27:03] report cards for so that the father
[1:27:05] could know when he could trust that son
[1:27:07] to step into a position of
[1:27:08] responsibility to put him into action to
[1:27:11] put him into work and know that he
[1:27:12] wouldn't Buckle under the load and he
[1:27:14] wouldn't presume to do things that he
[1:27:16] ought not to
[1:27:17] do that he wouldn't go out on his own
[1:27:19] idea his own
[1:27:20] Vision I was talking with a a brother a
[1:27:23] while ago and I and he said he said if I
[1:27:26] get a new minister in my church he says
[1:27:28] I don't let him preach for 12
[1:27:30] months 12 months I said he said yes 12
[1:27:33] months I said why he said so he can see
[1:27:35] what the ministry here is doing and so
[1:27:38] he can see what God's doing in the
[1:27:39] people and he can either decide to get
[1:27:41] on board with it or he can choose to go
[1:27:43] someplace else he says but otherwise
[1:27:45] they come in and they want to change
[1:27:47] they want to change the people they want
[1:27:48] to change the church they want to do all
[1:27:50] those things he says they've got to come
[1:27:52] in and see what God's doing first before
[1:27:54] they can presume to get in there and be
[1:27:55] a part of it right see what happens is
[1:27:58] we've got we can't just step in you know
[1:28:00] um if you've ever worked at all you'll
[1:28:03] get new employees come in they always
[1:28:05] want to change things
[1:28:07] up and there is a place and there's a
[1:28:09] time for that but first you got to
[1:28:11] understand what's really going on before
[1:28:12] you can make any
[1:28:13] changes that's what he's talking about
[1:28:15] here the son that's what we're talking
[1:28:17] about he's got to be able to catch the
[1:28:18] father's Vision he's got to understand
[1:28:20] what's going on so that he doesn't get
[1:28:22] caught up in his own thinking and he can
[1:28:24] continue to do the will of the father
[1:28:26] even if the father's not there to tell
[1:28:27] him to do it all the time he's got those
[1:28:29] principles baked into him he says the
[1:28:31] father taken him out into a public place
[1:28:33] and set him up before the public his
[1:28:35] same son that had been born in his home
[1:28:37] years before all the time his son but
[1:28:40] his character and his conduct had
[1:28:42] brought him to another office character
[1:28:45] and conduct another position a higher
[1:28:48] level of responsibility a greater
[1:28:49] position of impact and importance he
[1:28:51] says I hope you see it our character
[1:28:54] should have us up into a place where we
[1:28:57] can be in an office to do
[1:28:59] what build a great great ministry have
[1:29:02] people look at us have a tremendous
[1:29:05] impact influence
[1:29:07] recognition he says so we can be in an
[1:29:10] office in a position to meet the crisis
[1:29:13] of this hour that we're
[1:29:16] in God's training us for what's coming
[1:29:20] he knows it from the beginning to the
[1:29:22] end and he's training us so that when
[1:29:24] the crisis comes we're fit to handle the
[1:29:28] crisis but I want you to see what that
[1:29:31] looks like he says what a shame we
[1:29:33] are 1956 he didn't have a high opinion
[1:29:36] of the church but notice how we meet
[1:29:39] this
[1:29:41] crisis notice how we handle the
[1:29:44] crisis when the crisis comes and I'm all
[1:29:46] prepared and I'm an adopted son how do I
[1:29:49] meet the crisis do I meet it head on
[1:29:50] with what I know
[1:29:52] he says but will God answer in a type of
[1:29:55] crisis in a time of Crisis how do we
[1:29:58] meet a crisis we go to the father and we
[1:30:02] say what is your
[1:30:05] will what would you do what's going on
[1:30:08] here Lord I've shared this before I'll
[1:30:10] share it again sometimes people ask me
[1:30:12] to pray about something and I pray but I
[1:30:15] don't pray the prayer they're asking I
[1:30:17] go and I say Lord what's your will for
[1:30:19] the situation because my emotions can be
[1:30:21] drawn to a certain area but that doesn't
[1:30:23] make it God's will remember Jesus went
[1:30:25] to the pool of basa or
[1:30:29] Bethesda and he came in there and
[1:30:31] there's maybe dozens maybe hundreds
[1:30:32] maybe a thousand people I don't know
[1:30:34] laying there and he goes and he heals
[1:30:36] one man now me and my carnality would
[1:30:40] walk in there I'd see all of those there
[1:30:42] I know I've got power I know I've got
[1:30:44] Authority and I'd want to go and heal
[1:30:45] every single one of them wouldn't I sure
[1:30:48] we want to heal everyone we want to make
[1:30:50] everyone whole he goes in and he heals
[1:30:52] one and he walks out and not only that
[1:30:54] but he takes Flack for letting him carry
[1:30:56] his bed on a Sabbath
[1:30:58] day one
[1:31:00] person but how do we meet the crisis we
[1:31:02] go back to the father he says but God
[1:31:05] will God answer in a time of Crisis he
[1:31:07] says he will not only answer but he will
[1:31:10] make manifest in the time of Crisis if
[1:31:13] the people assemble together no matter
[1:31:15] of two or three whatever it is and pray
[1:31:17] there he said he would hear from Heaven
[1:31:21] God wants us to be to the place that
[1:31:23] when the bullets start
[1:31:24] flying when things are just going
[1:31:27] haywire and things are just moving so
[1:31:30] fast and it's chaotic he's got a people
[1:31:32] that'll drop to their knees and say Lord
[1:31:35] what would you have your servant to
[1:31:39] do that's an adoption ready child of God
[1:31:43] you say brother John I got to make a
[1:31:44] decision be still and know that I am
[1:31:48] God seek the
[1:31:50] scriptures pray before God confirm it
[1:31:53] through that and walk forward but don't
[1:31:56] be scared to wait you know this world
[1:31:58] wants us to make quick
[1:32:00] decisions and the scripture never gives
[1:32:02] us a place to do that we ought to be
[1:32:05] able to wait on the Lord to trust that
[1:32:07] he can show us what he wants us to do in
[1:32:09] these
[1:32:09] areas we're ordained to meet the crisis
[1:32:12] of the hour to handle it with Grace and
[1:32:15] with a Christlike nature at all times
[1:32:18] the squeeze the pressure the timeline
[1:32:20] ought not to change us into some
[1:32:22] freak like the world to answer the way
[1:32:25] they would amen God's preparing us for
[1:32:27] what lies ahead so that when that
[1:32:28] squeeze comes all that comes out is
[1:32:31] Christ The Living Word amen because
[1:32:33] we've gone to him we know him we know
[1:32:35] he's our source of strength and
[1:32:36] encouragement and Direction and these
[1:32:38] different things we're tied to him you
[1:32:40] know what hap what has to happen
[1:32:42] someplace along the road is we've got to
[1:32:43] fall in love with
[1:32:46] Jesus that's it cuz what holds us
[1:32:49] together what holds my wife and I
[1:32:50] together when things aren't so so good
[1:32:53] love love that's what holds me to him is
[1:32:56] love I know he loves me and I know I
[1:32:59] love him but I know he loves me more
[1:33:01] than I love him too amen but someplace
[1:33:04] along the line I've got to fall in love
[1:33:06] with him so that when everything hits
[1:33:08] the fan I'm okay with it and like job
[1:33:11] said though he slay me yet I'll trust
[1:33:14] him though I lose it all yet I'll trust
[1:33:16] him though he moved me to the
[1:33:19] godforsaken land of Newan land I'll
[1:33:21] Trust trust him not only that I'll enjoy
[1:33:23] it I'll enjoy it amen why cuz he does
[1:33:28] all things good he does all things for
[1:33:30] my good he's got me in the palm of his
[1:33:32] hand I don't have to be driven by the
[1:33:34] world's timeline I can rest and trust
[1:33:37] that he's got it in control listen to
[1:33:39] this he says now listen Presbyterian
[1:33:42] friend Methodist Baptist Pentecostal
[1:33:44] when you're born again he says that only
[1:33:46] puts you in the family it's your
[1:33:48] character your conduct that gives God
[1:33:51] confidence in in you the reason we
[1:33:53] haven't got the great church marching on
[1:33:54] today is because God can't find people
[1:33:57] to put his confidence
[1:33:59] in now watch what breaks his confidence
[1:34:03] he says the Holy Spirit keeps saying
[1:34:05] they're tearing up they're breaking up
[1:34:08] they're doing this they're off on the
[1:34:09] lines what is it it's men creating
[1:34:12] divisions you know what sometimes it's
[1:34:14] women creating divisions I was reading
[1:34:15] an ax the other day you know what
[1:34:16] happened they stirred up the Jews
[1:34:18] stirred up The Devout women to C
[1:34:21] problems they ain't always Brothers
[1:34:23] sometimes it's
[1:34:25] sisters let's not put it all on the
[1:34:27] ministry either he says they're off on
[1:34:30] the lines stay with God's word that's
[1:34:33] God's truth that's the pattern that's
[1:34:34] the blueprint that's the reason the
[1:34:36] church today has got all kinds of isms
[1:34:38] and everything in it is because they
[1:34:40] don't stay with the word they won't
[1:34:42] listen to the Holy Spirit the Holy
[1:34:45] Spirit won't testify of one other thing
[1:34:47] but God's word that's exactly right I
[1:34:51] said said it already but this is where
[1:34:52] the rubber meets the road when you see
[1:34:54] people tearing churches apart it's never
[1:34:57] the Holy
[1:34:59] Spirit if God wants to tear a church
[1:35:01] apart he'll do
[1:35:02] it because God raises up and God takes
[1:35:06] down God lets left Saul in in in control
[1:35:09] for what 15
[1:35:10] years a king that did not have the
[1:35:13] spirit of a king on him he left him in
[1:35:16] control for 15 years and you know we'd
[1:35:19] say brother Ed hammermeister gave me a
[1:35:21] book called called the three
[1:35:22] kings it's a story of David and the the
[1:35:25] things he went through but you know what
[1:35:27] happens is there's a line where they're
[1:35:29] trying to get Absalom to to take power
[1:35:31] and he says no no no no no and then
[1:35:33] finally it gets to the point where he
[1:35:34] says I've got to do this no you don't no
[1:35:39] you don't that's God's anointed and what
[1:35:41] did David say time and time again that's
[1:35:43] God's
[1:35:45] anointed what do you mean he's off he's
[1:35:48] got an evil spirit on him yeah God
[1:35:51] anoint anointed him and until God
[1:35:52] anoints somebody else not just anoints
[1:35:55] them but puts them in
[1:35:57] position I'm not making a move David
[1:36:00] knew if God anointed him God would put
[1:36:02] him in position he didn't have to push
[1:36:04] for it and so many times what happens is
[1:36:06] we get frantic in the situation and we
[1:36:09] forget that it's God's church it's his
[1:36:12] body it's his bride we don't have to do
[1:36:14] a thing if someone's off God will either
[1:36:17] correct them or he'll remove them that's
[1:36:19] the way he does it's the way he does it
[1:36:22] but we don't have to go splitting up and
[1:36:23] tearing up and doing all these things
[1:36:25] God's in control let's have patience for
[1:36:28] it that's one sure sign of people being
[1:36:30] out of the will of God I read you two
[1:36:31] quotes on this that they're tearing
[1:36:33] apart other people listen we've had
[1:36:36] people leave this church we've had
[1:36:38] people come to this church I've been in
[1:36:39] churches where we had tons of people
[1:36:40] leave we've had people come in God
[1:36:43] doesn't say this is the only place you
[1:36:45] can go to church God's got a fivefold
[1:36:47] Ministry spread out across the entire
[1:36:49] world he's got got somebody to feed you
[1:36:53] and if it's not here that's okay doesn't
[1:36:56] have to be here but praise the Lord if
[1:36:59] he'll give you some place to feed
[1:37:01] because he's got to feed you and he's
[1:37:03] got a five-fold ministry that's there to
[1:37:04] do it you know brother Bram said the
[1:37:07] only thing we take out of here is
[1:37:10] what
[1:37:12] character and if our character doesn't
[1:37:14] allow us to get along here how do we
[1:37:15] think we're going to get along up
[1:37:17] there amen we ought to be able to put
[1:37:20] aside our differences person draws a
[1:37:23] Line in the Sand to put you out what do
[1:37:25] you do walk with
[1:37:27] God somebody calls you out what do you
[1:37:29] do walk with God somebody disagrees with
[1:37:33] you what do you do walk with God just
[1:37:36] keep walking just live the life of
[1:37:38] Christ that's all he wants from us I
[1:37:40] don't answer to anybody else now it's
[1:37:42] easy when people walk away and they just
[1:37:43] walk away my wife and I were talking
[1:37:45] about this the other day you know people
[1:37:46] have left this message and some of them
[1:37:48] just went peacefully into the night and
[1:37:49] that's literally where they went into
[1:37:50] the night night and they're in darkness
[1:37:52] today and it's horrible but they went
[1:37:54] peacefully but what about when they're
[1:37:56] feisty what about when they're combative
[1:37:58] and do websites like believe the sign
[1:38:02] what do you do
[1:38:03] then do we respond as they've
[1:38:06] responded that's not the conduct of
[1:38:09] Christ what about when they drag your
[1:38:11] name through the mud what then Jesus
[1:38:15] said they did it to me they're going to
[1:38:16] do it to you that's right like get over
[1:38:19] it that's part of our
[1:38:22] it's just part of being a Christian
[1:38:23] things aren't always going to be nice
[1:38:26] people aren't always going to be nice
[1:38:27] and sometimes the one that disappoint us
[1:38:29] most are professing believers and you
[1:38:31] know what I got to grow up and you got
[1:38:33] to grow up and I'm going to disappoint
[1:38:34] you and you're going to disappoint me
[1:38:35] and we got to be able to get over it
[1:38:37] that's the conduct of adopted Sons and
[1:38:39] Daughters of Christ is they move on
[1:38:44] regardless you know
[1:38:46] what we did training when I was in
[1:38:49] BC and they're talking about conflict
[1:38:52] resolution and they said what do you do
[1:38:54] if somebody's got a problem with you at
[1:38:58] work and I said the first thing I or
[1:39:01] they said what have you know and what if
[1:39:02] you don't like somebody or somebody
[1:39:03] doesn't like you they said what do you
[1:39:05] do I said the first thing I asked myself
[1:39:06] is have I done something to
[1:39:09] them and she looked at me and she said
[1:39:11] are you serious I said yes she said I've
[1:39:13] never heard anybody say that anymore
[1:39:15] listen I'm
[1:39:17] imperfect and sometimes God will use a
[1:39:19] donkey to correct me
[1:39:21] and sometimes he'll use a senior
[1:39:22] Minister that I really respect to
[1:39:24] correct me but correction is correction
[1:39:26] and if it's by the word I've got to be
[1:39:28] able to say Lord is there any truth to
[1:39:30] what they're saying and if there is help
[1:39:33] me to humble myself and be corrected
[1:39:37] whether it's a donkey or whether it's a
[1:39:39] senior Minister that I love and respect
[1:39:41] I've got to be able to accept word
[1:39:42] correction regardless of the source and
[1:39:45] if I can do that then I can move on with
[1:39:47] God can't
[1:39:48] I watch this he says and now if if the
[1:39:51] other fellow draws the line you just
[1:39:53] live right along his line Don't force
[1:39:54] the issue you get as close to that
[1:39:57] person as you can he says you be the
[1:39:59] salt and God will make him thirsty if
[1:40:01] you'll be the salt you are the salt of
[1:40:03] the earth and salt if it contacts
[1:40:07] saves he says and and it salt creates a
[1:40:10] thirst and people will thirst when they
[1:40:12] see you talking about the Seven
[1:40:15] Seals when they recognize the mystery of
[1:40:18] godhead when they really understand
[1:40:21] destination no people will get thirsty
[1:40:23] when they see you living the life that
[1:40:25] you should live as a son and daughter of
[1:40:27] God ye are what written Epistles seen
[1:40:32] and read of all
[1:40:34] men what does it look like Paul said
[1:40:36] this I am crucified with Christ
[1:40:38] nevertheless I nevertheless I live yet
[1:40:41] not I but Christ liveth in
[1:40:45] me that's the
[1:40:47] believer that's the hidden life that's
[1:40:50] the overcoming power I'm dead but now
[1:40:52] I'm alive and it's because Christ is
[1:40:53] living in me the life which I now live
[1:40:56] in this flesh in this sing flesh I live
[1:40:58] by the faith of the Son of God who loved
[1:41:01] me and gave himself for me he said
[1:41:03] didn't he didn't say Christ visits me
[1:41:06] Christ drops in from time to time he
[1:41:07] says Christ lives in me amen we're a
[1:41:10] temple of the Living God this is a
[1:41:12] permanent
[1:41:13] residence it's the everpresent
[1:41:16] god in our lives day by day he lives in
[1:41:20] us and that's the only thing that's
[1:41:21] going to make a difference is when
[1:41:23] Christ is living in me I can know the
[1:41:25] message front to back I can memorize
[1:41:27] this Bible and it won't make a
[1:41:29] difference if I don't have Christ inside
[1:41:30] of me to make it live the way it's
[1:41:32] supposed to
[1:41:34] live he says the only way people will
[1:41:37] see Jesus is when they see him in
[1:41:41] you Church look at our responsibility
[1:41:44] this morning ye you are written Epistles
[1:41:48] and if Christ Spirit dwells in you and
[1:41:50] brings your conduct into subjection to
[1:41:52] his spirit and makes you act like him
[1:41:55] and talk like him walk like him live
[1:41:58] like him he says see people see Jesus in
[1:42:04] you that's why I said people aren't
[1:42:06] responsible for what I preach here this
[1:42:07] morning if they don't come here but they
[1:42:10] ought to see what's being preached here
[1:42:11] in your life and that's when they become
[1:42:13] responsible for it because a light has
[1:42:15] crossed their path the word has crossed
[1:42:18] their path the manifestation of Christ
[1:42:20] has cross their path and they'll be
[1:42:22] judged by the life you live question is
[1:42:26] do we have a life that can judge them
[1:42:28] not looking to put somebody out but
[1:42:30] looking to make somebody thirsty looking
[1:42:32] to catch their
[1:42:34] attention so that somebody would see
[1:42:36] what's the attraction on the
[1:42:37] mount it's Christ in you the hope of
[1:42:41] glory but we know Satan wants to hinder
[1:42:43] us and if he can't stop us he wants to
[1:42:46] slow us
[1:42:48] down he wants to get us sitting on the
[1:42:50] sideline
[1:42:52] he wants to get us immobile he wants to
[1:42:53] get us mired in doubts and fears he
[1:42:55] wants to get our attention off the
[1:42:58] prize he wants to present another
[1:43:00] purpose to us or failing that he wants
[1:43:01] to give us another road to that purpose
[1:43:04] that's what he did with Jesus remember
[1:43:06] he offered him all of the world without
[1:43:08] the
[1:43:09] cross that's not the way character is
[1:43:11] won character is a victory it means
[1:43:13] there's got to be a battle you've got to
[1:43:15] stand firm on what the word of God says
[1:43:18] but God's Got a Way he's got a plan he's
[1:43:19] got a purpose for these things
[1:43:21] and that's what we've got to fight for
[1:43:23] find his will and stay in it and that's
[1:43:26] a daily thing that's a morning thing I
[1:43:29] love when brother Dwayne was here you
[1:43:30] know and he reminded us and it was it
[1:43:32] was just for me if for nobody else he
[1:43:34] said what's the first thing you do when
[1:43:35] you wake up in my head I said pick up
[1:43:37] your phone and he said you pick up your
[1:43:38] phone right you check your messages
[1:43:41] anybody try and call is anybody texted
[1:43:44] what emails do I have waiting for me and
[1:43:45] he says you need to get into prayer and
[1:43:48] dedicate your life to God for that day
[1:43:50] to set the tone for what's going to
[1:43:53] happen right if I start my day with God
[1:43:57] I've got a lot better chance of me me
[1:44:00] recognizing that he's there throughout
[1:44:02] the day and catching what he's got for
[1:44:04] me to do and
[1:44:05] say listen to what he says he says but
[1:44:07] what's happened to you
[1:44:10] church you've seen so much television
[1:44:13] you say brother John I don't have
[1:44:14] television YouTube Tik Tok Snapchat
[1:44:17] Instagram Disney plus Amazon Prime you
[1:44:21] name it we've got it church I carry
[1:44:23] around a television with me every single
[1:44:25] day and most of us do as well so let's
[1:44:27] not pretend we don't have TVs
[1:44:31] anymore he says so much of the things of
[1:44:35] the world it's so easy for your old Adam
[1:44:38] nature to drift into that to act like
[1:44:40] the rest of them the old Adam feeds on
[1:44:43] what tree of knowledge the new Adam
[1:44:46] feeds on one thing Christ The Living
[1:44:49] Word what you feed is what will progress
[1:44:53] in your life it's that white dog black
[1:44:56] dog remember which one wins the one I
[1:44:57] feed the most there's a battle every day
[1:45:00] and the battle is often one in what
[1:45:02] you're feeding you feed right you'll win
[1:45:05] he says may I repeat this again in the
[1:45:07] offering of the atonement in the days of
[1:45:09] Moses when Moses brought the children
[1:45:11] out there was to be seven days that
[1:45:12] there was to be no leaven among the
[1:45:14] people anyone knows that in Exodus it
[1:45:16] says no leaven shall be found in your
[1:45:18] camp at all for seven days that seven
[1:45:20] days represented the full seven Church
[1:45:22] ages see no 11 but what is that he says
[1:45:26] no Creed no world Jesus said if you love
[1:45:29] the world or the things of the world the
[1:45:30] love of God's not even in you see and
[1:45:33] we're trying to mix that you can't do
[1:45:36] it you've got to come to one thing to
[1:45:40] believe in other words you can only
[1:45:42] believe one thing and here they are
[1:45:45] you're either going to believe God
[1:45:47] you're going to believe your church or
[1:45:50] you're going to believe the
[1:45:52] world he says you cannot mix it together
[1:45:54] you can't hold to them old things at the
[1:45:56] other Church before you did you've got
[1:45:58] to take the message of the hour he said
[1:46:01] what was left over don't let it stay
[1:46:02] till morning to come into this other age
[1:46:05] but burn it with fire and be destroyed
[1:46:07] that the age that you're living in the
[1:46:09] message of this age it's got to be
[1:46:11] brought out of the scriptures and
[1:46:13] Vindicated and proved by God that it's
[1:46:16] God doing
[1:46:17] so reminds me of Elijah up on Mount
[1:46:19] Carmel he says let us not help between
[1:46:22] two opinions if God be God let us serve
[1:46:25] God make a decision stick with it do you
[1:46:27] believe what you say you believe then
[1:46:29] let's live by it let's let our conduct
[1:46:32] show what we really believe if this be
[1:46:34] truth then everything else has to be
[1:46:37] false you can't mix two truths that
[1:46:40] disagree with each other they can't
[1:46:43] happen he says then you either receive
[1:46:46] that or reject it that's eternal life
[1:46:49] the leaders ship of the Holy Spirit
[1:46:51] leading his church now watch what he
[1:46:52] says he says the choice of your conduct
[1:46:56] oh oh we have a choice brother John
[1:46:59] absolutely we do he says you can't mix
[1:47:02] it now you're either for God or against
[1:47:04] God and the outward Expressions show
[1:47:07] exactly what's on the inside exactly
[1:47:10] what's on the inside the outward
[1:47:12] expression your conduct shows exactly
[1:47:14] your character what's on the inside see
[1:47:16] he says many of you think I got the
[1:47:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm going to
[1:47:19] heaven he says that don't mean one thing
[1:47:21] that you're going to heaven no sir you
[1:47:23] can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:47:25] every hour of your life and still be
[1:47:27] lost and go to hell the Bible says so he
[1:47:29] says uhuh that's exactly right now I
[1:47:31] want you to catch what he's saying
[1:47:33] there as he's talking about the
[1:47:35] scripture that says that the rain falls
[1:47:37] on the just and the unjust because
[1:47:39] remember he's talking to mostly
[1:47:40] denominational Christians and they
[1:47:42] believe that when the spirit Falls
[1:47:44] that's when you're saved that's just the
[1:47:46] presence of God we're in church and the
[1:47:49] Holy Spirit sweeps through here here we
[1:47:50] get to feel it and what is it it's the
[1:47:52] it's the the the the Heavenly rain on
[1:47:54] our dry and parched souls and we can
[1:47:57] raise our hands and we can shout and we
[1:47:58] can do all these different things he
[1:48:00] says that's not eternal life that's just
[1:48:03] the rain falling and the weeds enjoy the
[1:48:06] rain just as much as the wheat does
[1:48:08] right that's not it I said it last
[1:48:10] service but if our time in the presence
[1:48:12] of God is only in
[1:48:14] church then we either don't have what we
[1:48:17] think we have or we're living way below
[1:48:19] our privilege
[1:48:21] way below our
[1:48:23] privileges we ought to be able to
[1:48:25] experience the presence of God anytime
[1:48:28] anywhere absolutely absolutely but you
[1:48:32] know how it's because you keep that
[1:48:34] relationship
[1:48:36] open you prioritize
[1:48:39] it those of you that are married the
[1:48:41] marriage works great when you do what
[1:48:43] prioritize your spouse when you give her
[1:48:46] when you give him your time your energy
[1:48:48] your affection your attention
[1:48:51] yes your money whatever it might be your
[1:48:53] body whatever when you are focused on
[1:48:56] prioritizing that relationship magically
[1:48:58] the relationship gets better it's weird
[1:49:00] how it works it's not weird makes
[1:49:03] perfect sense you prioritize it and
[1:49:05] things all of a sudden get better it's
[1:49:07] no different with Christ you get into
[1:49:10] his presence once you'll want to be
[1:49:12] there all the
[1:49:13] time I love how when David brother bam
[1:49:16] says David didn't have to get prayed up
[1:49:18] when he went to meet Goliath he already
[1:49:20] prayed up he' already made everything
[1:49:23] right the line between him and heaven
[1:49:25] was crystal clear there was no filters
[1:49:28] there there was no blocking it there was
[1:49:29] no hidden
[1:49:31] sins everything between him and God was
[1:49:33] perfect and so David could just walk
[1:49:35] right into the will of God and just move
[1:49:37] right on why the lines of communication
[1:49:39] were open the relationship was
[1:49:41] established he didn't have to go and
[1:49:43] make things right he' just come right
[1:49:44] into the presence of God and God would
[1:49:46] hear his prayer and he moved right on
[1:49:47] with it David was known we preached on
[1:49:49] this recently he would go into the
[1:49:51] presence of God he'd get the will of God
[1:49:52] and he'd come out and he'd lead the
[1:49:53] people to battle and they always won the
[1:49:55] victory why cuz he took time to get the
[1:49:57] will of God before he made a move that's
[1:50:00] what we ought to do if we can worship
[1:50:02] here we ought to be able to Worship in
[1:50:03] our car in our home in our prayer Closet
[1:50:06] in our basement whatever it may be
[1:50:09] church when you're reading the message
[1:50:10] when you're listening to it when you're
[1:50:12] reading your Bible things ought to jump
[1:50:14] out that this is God speaking to me
[1:50:18] Desiring a relationship with me
[1:50:20] right
[1:50:23] amen we're temples of the Living God I
[1:50:26] say we're living below our
[1:50:28] privileges he says if God Saves you
[1:50:31] knowing he's going to lose you he
[1:50:32] defeats his purpose so brother R was
[1:50:34] talking about there is when the the
[1:50:36] presence of God falls on us that's not
[1:50:37] salvation that's not eternal life but
[1:50:39] when it seals your soul that's eternal
[1:50:41] life he says if he if he he saves you
[1:50:44] knowing he's going to lose you he
[1:50:45] defeats his purpose he doesn't do that
[1:50:47] when he saves you you're saved he that
[1:50:49] heareth my words and believeth on him
[1:50:50] that has sent me had eternal life and
[1:50:52] shall never come into judgment but has
[1:50:54] passed from Death unto life he says so
[1:50:56] you're still a son and daughter but
[1:50:58] you're living under your privilege now
[1:51:01] watch what he says and your conduct each
[1:51:04] day as the Holy Spirit brings it before
[1:51:06] the father gives away the things that
[1:51:09] you do he says and you're still a son
[1:51:11] and daughter but you'll never be brought
[1:51:13] to the place where you should
[1:51:15] be you know what that tells me what
[1:51:18] holds me back what holds me back is what
[1:51:21] brother Matt
[1:51:22] does no what holds me back is what I do
[1:51:26] my conduct holds me back what I do dayto
[1:51:29] day holds me back what keeps me from
[1:51:31] stepping into a greater role in the
[1:51:32] kingdom of God my conduct not yours
[1:51:38] mine I can't blame anyone in my life for
[1:51:43] what they've done for my
[1:51:45] conduct and when you come into adoption
[1:51:47] or you're ready for adoption what you
[1:51:49] realize is you stand on your own two
[1:51:50] feet and you take responsibility for
[1:51:52] every decision you ever
[1:51:54] made that's it I can't control you you
[1:51:58] can't control me you can't make me live
[1:52:00] a certain way and I can't make you live
[1:52:01] a certain way my conduct determines
[1:52:04] where God will place me what holds me
[1:52:06] back from a greater gift in my life my
[1:52:09] conduct I'm the limiting factor in this
[1:52:13] equation I'm the one that holds God back
[1:52:15] because I've got to prove to him I've
[1:52:18] got to go through a time of testing to
[1:52:20] where I do the right thing the right way
[1:52:22] the right time right attitude right
[1:52:24] motive right objective and then he knows
[1:52:26] he can trust me and that takes time that
[1:52:28] takes seasoning that takes training amen
[1:52:31] what is it God Compares my conduct to
[1:52:33] his word and either get a thumbs up or a
[1:52:35] thumbs down there is no middle you
[1:52:38] either pass or you fail and if you fail
[1:52:40] then you go around the mountain again
[1:52:41] and if you pass then he moves you on to
[1:52:43] the next trial the next test the next
[1:52:44] role the next position but God wants us
[1:52:47] to take
[1:52:48] responsibility what happened in the
[1:52:51] garden first thing Adam did passed the
[1:52:54] buck not only did he pass the buck onto
[1:52:56] his wife but he says the wife that you
[1:52:57] gave me he blamed God and he blamed his
[1:53:00] wife and he didn't blame
[1:53:02] himself what is it fear caused him to
[1:53:06] push it to somebody else but perfect
[1:53:08] love casts out fear and we can stand on
[1:53:10] our own two feet we can take the licks
[1:53:12] we can take the punishment we can take
[1:53:13] the correction and say Lord help me to
[1:53:15] do better next time amen but even in all
[1:53:18] of this there a higher
[1:53:21] plane seriously brother John there's
[1:53:24] more to this yes there
[1:53:27] is because here's the thing sometimes
[1:53:30] and I listen I've learned this myself
[1:53:33] I'm still learning this you can do the
[1:53:35] right thing the wrong
[1:53:38] way sure absolutely attitude approach
[1:53:43] method motive objective that all plays
[1:53:45] in to doing the right thing it's not
[1:53:48] just right to it's not just okay to be
[1:53:50] right you've got to do it right amen how
[1:53:53] we do is just as important as what we do
[1:53:57] catch this Paul talks about this to
[1:53:58] Timothy I love Timothy because he he's a
[1:54:01] young man growing up into Ministry and
[1:54:03] and Paul left no excuses on the table
[1:54:05] for for Timothy no matter where Timothy
[1:54:07] was in life Paul had a work for him to
[1:54:09] do and a way to grow and a way to mature
[1:54:11] and Paul says the servant of the Lord
[1:54:13] must not strive but be gentle unto all
[1:54:16] men after to teach impatient the amplify
[1:54:18] puts it this way says a servant of the
[1:54:20] Lord must not be quarrelsome fighting
[1:54:22] and contending instead he must be kindly
[1:54:25] to everyone and mild-tempered preserving
[1:54:28] the bond of Peace he must be a skilled
[1:54:31] and suitable teacher patient and
[1:54:33] forbearing and willing to suffer wrong
[1:54:38] oh whoa willing to take a beating while
[1:54:43] doing the right thing and not
[1:54:46] respond he says in meekness instructing
[1:54:49] those that oos themselves in other words
[1:54:51] people are doing damage to themselves
[1:54:53] and you're trying to keep them from
[1:54:54] doing it you're doing it for their sake
[1:54:56] it's not comfortable for you but it's
[1:54:57] for their sake he says if God per
[1:55:01] avventure so he says just on the off
[1:55:02] chance that God will give them
[1:55:04] repentance to the acknowledging of the
[1:55:06] truth the Amplified says he must correct
[1:55:08] those who are in opposition
[1:55:11] how with courtesy and gentleness in the
[1:55:15] hope that God May grant that they will
[1:55:17] repent and be led to the knowledge of
[1:55:19] the truth
[1:55:20] accurately understanding and welcoming
[1:55:22] it and that they may recover themselves
[1:55:25] out of the snare of the devil who are
[1:55:27] taken captive by him at his will you
[1:55:30] want to change somebody you got to come
[1:55:32] in the right
[1:55:33] way a brother shared this quote with me
[1:55:36] recently and it just hit me like a ton
[1:55:38] of bricks I thought it was so powerful
[1:55:40] brother Braham says it's not what you do
[1:55:42] it's the way you do
[1:55:43] it so sometimes it's not what you say
[1:55:47] it's the way you say it I said this is
[1:55:49] something I'm learning stepping into a
[1:55:51] pastoral role you got to
[1:55:53] grow and you can make mistakes at times
[1:55:55] and you got to learn from that reset and
[1:55:57] go forward but brother bradam here if
[1:56:00] you go back and look up the quote he's
[1:56:01] talking about that hunting guy Bert
[1:56:04] remember Bert he had the meanest
[1:56:06] eyes and what did he do he would go and
[1:56:08] he would shoot The Fawns and it was a
[1:56:11] conservation mechanism it was legal to
[1:56:14] do the game wardens wanted them to do it
[1:56:16] they had too many deers so they were
[1:56:17] saying just kill the young ones he said
[1:56:19] he he said Bert would kill eight or 10
[1:56:21] but he said but he enjoyed doing it and
[1:56:24] he would do it to shock people he
[1:56:27] enjoyed showing that he liked to kill
[1:56:30] something harmless and cute he was
[1:56:32] shooting bambies right that just that's
[1:56:35] a horrible thing to do kill a small
[1:56:37] animal and he loved to do it but
[1:56:39] remember what changed his heart was when
[1:56:40] he gave that call and even though that
[1:56:43] Doe knew it was hunting season she stood
[1:56:44] up and she offered her life because she
[1:56:46] thought that her young were there and it
[1:56:48] changed his heart and brother BR him
[1:56:50] brought him to Christ
[1:56:51] there but what he's talking about here
[1:56:53] is that some people take joy in putting
[1:56:56] people down or putting people
[1:56:59] out rather than trying to bring them in
[1:57:02] they're really trying to put them
[1:57:04] out remember we have I know we've heard
[1:57:07] it people will say give them the word
[1:57:11] test oh just give them the word
[1:57:13] test talk to them about serpent seed
[1:57:16] talk to them about godhead talk to them
[1:57:18] about predestination if they don't
[1:57:19] accept that they're not children of God
[1:57:20] come on we've all heard it I know I've
[1:57:22] heard it multiple multiple times but you
[1:57:25] know what we don't hear give them the
[1:57:27] word test with a word
[1:57:31] attitude this is the word attitude Amen
[1:57:35] Let Your approach be as in line with the
[1:57:37] word that you're hoping to bring with
[1:57:39] them amen let your approach be something
[1:57:42] that would draw them in rather than push
[1:57:44] them away because so often what pushes
[1:57:46] them away is not what we're saying it's
[1:57:48] how we're saying it amen they might even
[1:57:51] agree if they had time to sit down and
[1:57:53] calm down and not be offended at how
[1:57:55] we're saying things but they can't
[1:57:57] because we're too abrasive we're too
[1:57:58] rough we're harsh and overbearing we
[1:58:00] have a take it or leave it attitude
[1:58:01] rather than in there contending for
[1:58:03] their souls contending for their souls
[1:58:05] that's what we're doing this is a life
[1:58:06] and death situation our response to the
[1:58:09] Eternal Word of God determines where
[1:58:10] we're going to
[1:58:11] go and our attitude can change exactly
[1:58:14] where they end up they may never come
[1:58:16] into a new birth but they may receive
[1:58:18] eternal life that's right just because
[1:58:20] they've accepted Christ as their savior
[1:58:23] if we're arrogant in our approach how
[1:58:24] can it be
[1:58:26] Christ amen the more we know the more
[1:58:30] humble we ought to
[1:58:31] be if we're trying to get the beam out
[1:58:33] of somebody else's eye let's make sure
[1:58:35] we've got it out of our own as well amen
[1:58:37] you know my wife and I spent hours
[1:58:38] talking to a minister one time a very
[1:58:40] senior Minister and we are asking them
[1:58:42] questions and we are poking and we were
[1:58:44] prodding and it couldn't have been
[1:58:45] comfortable for him and you know what he
[1:58:48] did he answered patiently and calmly and
[1:58:53] quietly for hours and hours and hours
[1:58:57] and hours way into the wee hours of the
[1:58:59] morning didn't get impatient didn't get
[1:59:02] offended senior Minister who are you to
[1:59:05] challenge me who are you to talk no no
[1:59:06] no he sat there and he laid out
[1:59:08] everything he believed scripture quote
[1:59:11] scripture quote time and time again no
[1:59:14] problems why apt to teach patient meek
[1:59:19] if he wanted to he probably could have
[1:59:20] torn me apart but he didn't he wanted me
[1:59:23] to see where he was coming from that's
[1:59:25] how Fellowship ought to be that's how
[1:59:26] witnessing ought to be that's how
[1:59:28] Ministry ought to be amen but you know
[1:59:30] what then I had a minister come to me
[1:59:32] after that that disagreed with the way
[1:59:33] that man preaches with that
[1:59:36] Doctrine you know what he didn't say he
[1:59:39] didn't say oh I heard you had him and
[1:59:41] you let him convince you I heard you
[1:59:44] gone over to the other side brother John
[1:59:46] he said maybe when you have some time
[1:59:49] you can tell me about what you've
[1:59:51] learned he didn't presume that I changed
[1:59:54] he didn't presume I'd gone to the dark
[1:59:56] side he said maybe when you get time you
[1:59:59] can share with me how your view has
[2:00:00] changed and why it's changed or how it's
[2:00:04] changed I love both those men dearly and
[2:00:07] they're on opposite sides of a Doctrine
[2:00:09] right now but both of them showed the
[2:00:12] right
[2:00:13] attitude both of them had the right
[2:00:15] spirit and I trust they'll maintain that
[2:00:16] Spirit not just in private but over
[2:00:18] their pulpits as well
[2:00:19] but that's how it ought to be amen
[2:00:22] because here's one
[2:00:23] thing I don't know it all I Used to Know
[2:00:26] It
[2:00:28] All then God changed
[2:00:31] me but I don't know it all and that
[2:00:33] means I've got to be able to be
[2:00:34] corrected I've got to be able to be
[2:00:35] taught I've got to be able to see
[2:00:37] there's more than what I've got there's
[2:00:38] more than what I know there's more than
[2:00:39] what I understand there's more than even
[2:00:41] what I believe that there's always
[2:00:43] something there and I'll tell you what
[2:00:44] if we've got an open heart to it God
[2:00:46] will bring somebody with the right
[2:00:47] attitude and the right Spirit to help us
[2:00:48] come that way way amen he's got somebody
[2:00:50] prepared to do that God's always got a
[2:00:52] witness available if we've got our heart
[2:00:54] to receive it but bra says that's what
[2:00:57] the Pentecostal Church ought to do yet
[2:00:59] we're made fun of and called every kind
[2:01:00] of a name that we could be we ought to
[2:01:02] conduct ourselves like Sons and
[2:01:04] Daughters of God because God is our King
[2:01:08] women ought to dress and act like ladies
[2:01:12] men ought to be men ought to be Sons and
[2:01:15] Daughters of God our character Our
[2:01:17] Testimony ought to stand high in the
[2:01:19] City the Bible said that you are the
[2:01:21] salt of the earth and the salt is the
[2:01:23] Savor if it
[2:01:25] contacts put salt here and meat there
[2:01:28] it'll never save the meat man if you got
[2:01:30] it in the salt shaker here and you got
[2:01:31] the meat here it doesn't do any good you
[2:01:33] got to put them together he says you got
[2:01:35] to put the salt and the meat together
[2:01:36] and salt creates a thirst I tell you
[2:01:39] what we need tonight is to be so salty
[2:01:41] till we make men and women thirst to be
[2:01:43] like you scripture says we're in the
[2:01:46] world but we're not of it but that
[2:01:47] doesn't mean we sit at our home in our
[2:01:48] country couch the salt has to be out
[2:01:51] where people can contact it and the
[2:01:53] light has to be out where people can see
[2:01:54] it we do not isolate ourselves from the
[2:01:57] world we don't get into
[2:02:00] relationship right we don't tie
[2:02:02] ourselves to the world but we have to be
[2:02:04] in it so they can have a witness so that
[2:02:06] they can have a testimony of what it's
[2:02:08] supposed to
[2:02:10] be he says go on say if there was ever a
[2:02:12] Christian I don't go to her church but
[2:02:15] she's really a Christian there's the man
[2:02:17] I don't go to his church I go to another
[2:02:18] church but if there was ever a Christian
[2:02:20] there's one of them that's what salt
[2:02:22] looks like he says that's what we want
[2:02:24] that's the kind of character that God
[2:02:26] wants the Holy Spirit to bring record to
[2:02:27] him oh if this boy was a good boy his
[2:02:30] life of God reflected in him the life of
[2:02:32] his father reflected in him he says now
[2:02:35] we're sons of God then God ought to
[2:02:37] reflect his life in you Jesus said if I
[2:02:39] do not what the works of my father then
[2:02:43] believe me not but if I do the works of
[2:02:45] my father believe the works he says
[2:02:47] there you are we ought to be reflecting
[2:02:50] the life of God in our life God ought to
[2:02:54] reflect we ought to have all the doubt
[2:02:56] and everything so beat out of us in such
[2:02:58] a place till when when God wants to say
[2:03:00] now see one of my children there he's
[2:03:02] got so and so and one of mine here he'll
[2:03:04] not get squirmy and go jumping from
[2:03:05] place to place he believes my word he
[2:03:08] stands right there right out at the top
[2:03:10] yes sir nothing can make him change
[2:03:13] because he's reflecting my life amen God
[2:03:18] bless you let's stand if you
[2:03:24] would we've taken a title of
[2:03:27] confirmative
[2:03:28] action that the life we live the conduct
[2:03:30] we have confirms what's inside of us
[2:03:34] amen and God's trusting us God's got
[2:03:36] faith in us God's Got A belief that we
[2:03:38] can handle what's in there in our path
[2:03:40] amen but you see here that brother
[2:03:42] Braham says he's he's got confidence
[2:03:44] that we'll come to a maturity where we
[2:03:45] won't be moved off the word no matter
[2:03:48] how hard it is
[2:03:49] you know I think so many times what we
[2:03:51] want to do is we want to agree in any
[2:03:53] way possible that we end up stepping
[2:03:55] over the word many
[2:03:57] times but we've got to be able and I
[2:03:59] think this goes especially amongst us as
[2:04:01] Believers man if you see me doing
[2:04:03] something wrong don't come and try and
[2:04:06] and
[2:04:07] wishwood it over have a Straight Talk
[2:04:11] amen that we would provoke one another
[2:04:13] to Good Works rather than massage what
[2:04:15] we're doing to try and make it into good
[2:04:17] works that we can be serious about these
[2:04:20] things because if we can't do it with
[2:04:21] each other we'll never do it with the
[2:04:23] world we've got to have an honesty and
[2:04:25] sincerity amongst ourselves I think
[2:04:26] before we can move on to those outside
[2:04:28] but he's put a responsibility on us to
[2:04:31] present the word to this age even if
[2:04:33] they never come to church even if they
[2:04:36] never step foot inside this building
[2:04:38] even if they never hear the end time
[2:04:39] message preached that they would still
[2:04:40] see there's something there that they
[2:04:42] need that's different especially to
[2:04:45] those that are in denominations that
[2:04:47] think they're okay where they're at
[2:04:49] brother B puts it this way and we're
[2:04:50] closing on this quote he says you know
[2:04:53] there's so many of us and most all of us
[2:04:56] influence Somebody by the things that we
[2:04:58] do and the way we live and the things we
[2:05:01] say we influence somebody somebody is
[2:05:04] watching your life he says and when we
[2:05:07] profess to be Christians what type of
[2:05:09] life should we live if somebody is
[2:05:10] watching us he says in your life that
[2:05:12] you live will reflect an influence on
[2:05:14] somebody their Eternal destination will
[2:05:19] rest upon the way that you live and the
[2:05:22] things that you do he says for they
[2:05:25] watch
[2:05:27] you what responsibility do we have this
[2:05:31] morning remember I've said read that
[2:05:33] scripture that says all we do do all in
[2:05:36] the name of the Lord
[2:05:37] Jesus that's what's going to convince
[2:05:40] people is that we don't go into our
[2:05:44] house and we're different indoors than
[2:05:45] we are Outdoors that we're different in
[2:05:48] church than we are when we're out in the
[2:05:50] world that we go to job our job and
[2:05:52] we're one person we're in the building
[2:05:54] here and we're another person but that
[2:05:56] continuity of life that continuity of
[2:05:59] conduct is what God's looking for that
[2:06:01] no matter where we go we never put the
[2:06:04] word
[2:06:05] aside and we acknowledge the god of our
[2:06:07] life no matter where we go it's amazing
[2:06:10] what happens when you have the mindset
[2:06:12] Lord help me be a witness you'll realize
[2:06:15] there's a lot of opportunity out there
[2:06:18] and it's just in the simplest of things
[2:06:19] that we say sometimes and people will
[2:06:21] look at
[2:06:22] you and then you got an opportunity to
[2:06:25] share more about what God's doing even
[2:06:28] something as simple you know out at the
[2:06:30] ski hill and somebody said yeah we're
[2:06:31] having great weather and I said yeah
[2:06:32] thank God it's an answer to prayer
[2:06:35] something as simple as that they go whoa
[2:06:38] yeah and then they see commenting on my
[2:06:40] my daughter and my wife and they're
[2:06:41] wearing skirts oh I really like that
[2:06:43] where did you get that in these
[2:06:44] different things everywhere we go church
[2:06:46] people are looking and they're watching
[2:06:48] and they don't even know what they're
[2:06:49] looking at sometimes until we open our
[2:06:51] mouth to let them see why we are the way
[2:06:53] we are but that's what he's looking for
[2:06:56] people that will live the same in and
[2:06:59] out of
[2:07:00] church in and out of their
[2:07:02] homes whether they're with a Believer
[2:07:04] they're not with a
[2:07:06] Believer no matter what the situation
[2:07:08] the environment the pressures whatever
[2:07:09] it will be that their actions their life
[2:07:12] stays right with the word day in and day
[2:07:14] out that's when he says he's ready to be
[2:07:17] adopted is when we act the way we say we
[2:07:19] ought to act when we live the way we say
[2:07:22] we want to live when we eat the things
[2:07:24] we say we want to eat and when we
[2:07:26] produce the thing that we say is the
[2:07:28] desire inside of our hearts amen God
[2:07:31] bless you this morning let's just bow
[2:07:32] our heads Heavenly
[2:07:36] Father Lord we know this is a work of
[2:07:38] your
[2:07:39] hands Lord and like the scripture says
[2:07:42] it's not by might it's not by power but
[2:07:45] it's by your spirit but Lord we see here
[2:07:48] that your Prophet said that we make a
[2:07:49] choice of our
[2:07:51] conduct Lord that every single day every
[2:07:54] single moment we make a
[2:07:55] choice
[2:07:57] life or not
[2:07:59] life Lord there's no riding the
[2:08:03] fence Lord we've got to make a
[2:08:06] decision I'll live for you or I'll live
[2:08:09] for
[2:08:11] myself and Lord we're coming to a place
[2:08:13] Lord we're in the adoption season Lord I
[2:08:16] believe you're wanting to raise us into
[2:08:18] a place where we could do your Works in
[2:08:21] a greater way than we ever have before
[2:08:24] but Lord you're looking at our conduct
[2:08:25] you're looking at what we respect you're
[2:08:27] looking at what we
[2:08:28] prioritize Lord I pray that as you look
[2:08:31] Lord that what you see would please
[2:08:33] you Lord I pray that my life would
[2:08:36] please you I pray that the life of each
[2:08:37] and every believer that's here this
[2:08:39] morning Lord would be pleasing to you
[2:08:42] Lord and we know we're so imperfect Lord
[2:08:44] we fall flat on our face so many times
[2:08:47] Lord forgive me Lord forgive us where we
[2:08:50] say the wrong thing Lord we might be
[2:08:51] trying to do the right thing but we flub
[2:08:53] it up with our emotions or adding our
[2:08:56] little bits into it Lord grant us Grace
[2:08:58] Lord forgive us Lord and help us to be
[2:09:00] gracious one to another Lord let us as
[2:09:03] your scripture says provoke one another
[2:09:05] to Good Works Lord let us be found
[2:09:07] walking Faithfully each and every day
[2:09:10] Lord that the report card you get will
[2:09:12] be pleasing to you Lord fill us with
[2:09:15] your spirit lord I can't do this on my
[2:09:17] own Lord there's no one here can do it
[2:09:20] Lord but we're trusting in
[2:09:22] you lord it's a work of your hands
[2:09:25] you're the author and the finisher of
[2:09:27] our faith and Lord we're committing our
[2:09:29] lives and our ways to you but Lord we've
[2:09:32] got choices to
[2:09:34] make Lord you're laying that
[2:09:36] responsibility on us Lord help us to
[2:09:38] choose right Lord that others could have
[2:09:41] life as we have it or granted now we
[2:09:44] pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it
[2:09:47] amen
