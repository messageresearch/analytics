Lord may just be mixed with faith father tonight and may we invite you father to be with us we thank you for everything Lord and we commit this service into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ amen all right let's turn to Ephesians 4 start at verse 15 okay verse 15 but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ For Whom the whole body whole body fitly together joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase the body unto the edifying of itself in love you may be seated okay so tonight is part seven in our study in Nehemiah uh I also want to do um he's not here but I thoroughly enjoyed having brother Mark up here last Wednesday the master himself Mark the Revelator um really really enjoyed having Dad back so it's nice to have that teaching back I do not have the confidence whatsoever the delve into Revelation like he does and it's great to hear it I think everyone enjoyed it and um be good to have him up soon okay so part seven uh so last time that we talked about Nehemiah we he was talking to the King of Persia and that's where he did the instant prayer for favor with the king the king gives him the authority that he needs the resources Nehemiah goes to Jerusalem when he gets there he doesn't tell anyone that he is there and he wants to see what the lay of the land is like um he inspects it sees how bad it is um that way he can get a plan together he goes to the Lord to praise um we also uh taught about how Nehemiah wasn't just under the authority of a king he was also under prophecy where we saw in the 70 weeks of Daniel where it was prophesied that the wall would be restored it's one thing to have the authority of the Persian king it's a whole other thing to have the authority of the Heavenly King so the next bit was that uh once he has the plan together he talks to the people he gives them the vision inspires them to restore the wall because at this point this was u a long period period of restoration once Cyrus the Great uh gave them Freedom it was an immediate restoration of everything when they got there initially they had resistance um from the um Samaritans and the different Arabs and the different ones there and they had to fight for it and they had ups and downs God had to sent Ministry to inspire them and after a while things degradated where God had to send erra to clean up the land apply the token so it took time that restoration process took time it was a line upon line here a little there a little kind of a process and then we also talked about the primary enemies that neiah had which was selat and toaya who were uh tobah was an amonite and sambat was a moabit and they were a constant Thor on neemias side you know we learned how sbl's name essentially means the same as Satan and he acts like Satan and he gives them a hard time the entire time but without a test there is no testimony and Nehemiah was going to have a testimony coming out of this and he was going to show how a Believer reacts to resistance you don't pay it no mind you don't have to fight it you just say you have no right no Memorial here and you walked away and at any point they were constantly trying to do trapped after trapped after trapped and neemi just ignored it cuz his purpose was to restore the walls and everything for him was driving towards that one purpose because without the walls the people were open to attack so it didn't matter what they were doing if they came on his Turf that's when they started doing The Sword and the the the shovel because we don't go looking for the devil if the devil steps on our territory that's when we deal with them but we don't have to negotiate with them we don't need to talk to them we don't need to listen to them we don't need to do any of it so we learn about them and their background and uh essentially the last part we saw was where Nehemiah was saying you have no right no Memorial here I'm not going to argue with you okay so uh this time around we're going to go through chapter three and chapter 3 is a bit of a an odd chapter in the book of Nehemiah it's a lot like those like uh Luke 2 I believe it is where it's or Luke 1 where it's you know Joseph had James and James had Isaac and Isaac had you know Rio BMA or whatever it's a very long chapter with a lot of this family took care of this section of a wall this family took this section of the wall and I was dying to not do it but I felt to do it and because there's good stuff in it and same thing with with those bat chapters like honestly if you read through it there are things in it because if you look at the um in Genesis where it talks about the the first seven from Adam to uh to Noah the meanings of those names spell out the Plan of Redemption literally word for word of what God was going to do so it it pays to read your Bible even the boring Parts because in the boring Parts there's little nuggets and chapter 3 is one of those chapters so it's going to be a little bit different tonight in terms I'm not going to go go through chronologically because it's just it's a lot of like this Tower is built this pool is built this wall was built this gate was built but they're still good in it all right so we're going to talk about how Jerusalem has gone through many things over the thousands of years that it it's existed it's been fought for over constantly it's been built massively it's shrank down it's had the Ottomans it's had the Muslims it had the British it had you know the Crusader Knights it had the Templars it's the history of Jerusalem is is is incredible because Jerusalem is is part of Prophecy and it's something that God has treasured and therefore Satan wants it and he's always tried to destroy it and he's always tried to to ruin in in whatever way so we're just going to quickly go through where jsdm started and what Nehemiah was dealing with so the first Biblical reference that we see to Jerusalem in the Bible is found when Abraham encounters mzc because MDC is known as the king of Salem so that's the first mention of Jerusalem in the Bible and Salem as we know is is is peace and mzc was the king of Peace as we know he was Christ in another form and thank God for a prophet to reveal that because no one knew that until he came around so he was the king of Peace So the actual name then Jerusalem is then mentioned in Joshua after Joshua and the Israelites take AI uh in Joshua 10:3 so when you add Jer uh jeru to Salem it means city of Peace okay and brother Bram says uh in the Bible when you because you always you see Zion you see Jerusalem you see the city of David there's many different names for Jerusalem but when you see Zion Zion means the bride you can literally insert bride anytime you read it so Jerusalem is near and dear to God's heart so in this first instance here we see this is what constitutes the city of David ignore all the little words I took this from a study Bible online and I couldn't get rid of the words okay so the lines in the words ignore them okay they're not important the whole point I want to I want to show here is that Jerusalem it's good to visualize what it is that we're talking about because it's like for those who were blessed enough to be able to go to Israel when you read the Bible before you go to Israel versus what the Bible is like after you read or you go to Israel sorry it's two very different experiences okay so the same thing here if if you see it it makes makes more sense okay so this here is what the city of David looked like okay so before David David took the city of David it was um it was the Fortress of Zion from the jebusites and this was around a th000 BC um and we all know the story about how joab goes to the well goes up through opens the gates and they essentially kill everyone and they take it so the city of David doesn't really expand because David was told by God that no you're not going to build the temple you're a bloody man okay but he had to do the bloody work in order for his son to benefit from it so he what he what David does is that he prepares for his son like what a good father should do for his children okay and David collects all the Timber from Lebanon he collects all the gold he collects all the jewels all the things that the temple is going to need he collects it and this hill that you see up in the passive City there that is Mount Mariah okay Mount Mariah is famous in scripture as a place where Abraham sacrificed or tried to sacrifice Isaac that was where that happened okay so once David is done from the scene Solomon then takes the initiative and builds the temple exactly where that happens okay so the city of David is essentially right now is just two two Hills you got the kidon valley below and you got other things all around it so it's very small very very small when Solomon comes around then you see it expands up north and this is all from the same perspective so you'll see how it grows and this is from the western side of the mount olives looking towards the city so the city David then expands North and you see that's where in the back there you see the temple the Temple Mount Solomon's Palace and all that after Solomon passes on it goes through many generations and Hezekiah is the next big one and he expands it all the way to the west and it's a huge expansion that he does here and Hezekiah is actually famous in scripture for that there was a lot of arch or um a lot of uh I'm forgetting the word but like great building projects that he did like uh when sakb and the Assyrians were around he he prepared uh by getting a a tunnel dug to bring in fresh water into the city so he was he was a man of renown in that way so after the city of Jerusalem is expanded to the west and you have Hezekiah do all that then it wasn't many generations before the Babylonians come and it left like this okay whole place is burning Nebuchadnezzar does a great job of destroying the city he destroys the temple he destroys all the walls the gates it's left Ru it's not a nice place to live so what Nehemiah comes back to again ignore all the words you see to the to the left here it's all destroyed it's all gone okay so all s or all Nehemiah is building is this old portion of the city of David and the temple it's not this big huge thing because everyone thinks about jwm as what you see in like Jesus of Nazareth or whatever this huge thing because it it it it was only this during the time of Nehemiah so in 400 years from Nehemiah to Jesus it expands to this agree a lot of that has to do with Herod the Great Herod the Great massively expanded the temple uh as you can see the the it was very Roman inspired huge columns um and it just it's this huge thing and just for everyone's um interest behind the temple there is the is is the Western Wall and the Western Wall is is where the floor is of the temple the Western Wall is this type is a retain wall it's the retaining wall so that's all that's left of Solomon's Temple that the Jews have access to is that behind the temple the retaining wall that's it and then were the um I wish I had a pointer up in this corner up there where it's kind of a v that's where they say gol gotha was was behind the city Mount of olves is here where gets semon was but it's behind the city is where go goth and they can't really Peg it down because it's 2,000 years but they they they think they found a a um it's called um the GOL goth is called the place of the skull and there's literally a place where it literally looks like a a human skull you guys have seen yeah so that's where they presume it is so anyways so that's what everyone thinks when they think of Jerusalem is this huge expansive thing it's not it's this city of David solon's Temple and the walls and that whole length it's still not a small thing don't get me wrong it's still two and a half miles of walls okay so about 220 acres is is the total menal land that Nehemiah needs to restore here this is not a small project and what's crazy is that they say they finished this between 40 and 50 5 days a bunch of inexperienced Farmers Merchants Etc 40 to 55 days okay so if we turn to neemi 2 I'm going to be reading through this it's up to you if you want to read it but I'm going to be going through it so at this point Again The Remnant in Jerusalem are are ashamed they are open to the attacks of the enemy and at that point it's it's people like the amonites and all the different old enemies that they have uh and a city with broken wolves is all is always a shameful thing and you see in Proverbs where uh a man who doesn't have self-control is Like a Man Without Walls so the the the city was not a safe place to be in it wasn't a comfortable place to live and it was uh reproach upon the name of Jehovah so Nehemiah when he gets there he says in uh chapter 2: 17 then said I unto them you see the distress that we are in how Jerusalem lith waste and the gates there are burned with fire come and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem that we be no more our approach then un told him of the hand of my God which is good upon me as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me and they said let us rise up and build so they strengthen their hands for this good work so Nehemiah comes with a vision with that a vision the people perish and he inspires their faith okay and faith is contagious provoke one another unto good works and like you'll see in scripture and even in our own lives if one person Rises up with faith it can spread you look God only needs one you look at a Revival God just needs one sincere yielded person and God can go through that person and spread and we've seen it in our own church where you go through JY seasons and you just need a couple praying people and God can work through amen it's like that U Chad's favorite sermon of all time power versus Force by Brother Lonnie Jenkins and he talks about how when you have a when you have a supernatural being living in your heart and you're along with other people who have that same supernatural being in their heart when they focus towards something when they start praying towards the same goal it's like a giant bunch of laser beams focusing on the problem and that thing goes amen because it's creative Force amen you know it's just Jesus even said it like you're are gods and you have creative power and in in in in the power of the tongue is death and life so Nehemiah here he C he catches the vision when he hears about the problem he gets the authority of the king and he goes to the people he inspires them and now they in all this time they are discouraged they're afraid they're not doing anything and then finally they have the faith to do the job so as we've seen like this is a huge job that they have to do two and a half miles of walls that they have to restore and to rebuild this is not a small job okay so he needs help Nehemiah can't do it all himself you know he he would have died building the first gate but he needed people but he's also just administrator he was just a soft-handed white collar wine cup Bearer okay I'm sure he didn't really work with stone much helping the king but God chose him okay his ways are not our ways you know his thoughts are not our thoughts and God specially selected him for his character and you see why God chose him for his character by the way he reacts when trouble Rises what does he do does does he freak out like Saul or does he go to prayer as David does and we see it in Nehemiah even though he's not a noble he's not a priest he's not a prophet he's not even a preacher he's not the Son of a Preacher he's just a simple administrator who has a burden who has a sincere heart that's yielded to the Lord and that's all God needed for this situation for God to move okay so he can't do it all himself he needs everyone to help and to do the work to rebuild the walls so like I said in chapter 3 it's it's Nehemiah and it doesn't say specifically it's Nehemiah selecting each person but it's kind of obvious through the scripture that each person was given a portion of the wall to do and you see some in you see an instance where uh for one section the uh the leaders of the group that was sey to refus to do the work but everyone else does it and everyone else does it willingly willingly because if you remember in scripture when Moses was building the Tabernacle and Gathering all the things for the Tabernacle Tabernacle the number one requirement for anyone working on that Tabernacle was what they had to be of a willing heart no one was going to be coerced into doing anything why is that it's the principle whatsoever is not of faith is sin and if you got to drag someone to do something leave them be leave them be it's no different than the the the parable that Jesus talks about how he he uh the about the father who asked the one son to do the job he said no the other one said yes ends up not doing it the other one who said no ends up doing it who was the better one the one who said no and ended up doing it because it showed at the end of the day it wasn't just lip service it took him time to get to to get around to the idea of doing it to have the burden to do it but he end up doing it so whatever the role the person has to be willing in the church at the home at the job whatever it may be if you got to force someone to do it leave them be it's not going to be a blessing it's going to be done out of there's going to be a spear behind it you don't want it you don't want it so God if if God can have someone who's of a willing hurt then that's all he need needs because he just he works through empty human vessels and if that person is willing to do it then they've yielded themselves to the job to do it they've let go of their own ego they've let go of their own wants and desires how it should be done and they'll just do as God says am all right so Nehemiah div divies out all the different uh sections of the walls and it it and you see it's it's it's everyone it's not just the inhabitants of Jerusalem you got people who live outside Jerusalem you got Farmers you got Merchants you got everyone and everyone is asked to do the job and when you go through the the the different verses of it as you see here the first one and next unto them repaired metalia the gibeonite so what's a gibeonite a gibeonite is a gentile the gibian or the Gibbon nightes were the ones who uh when Joshua was coming in they were afraid they would be destroyed like Jericho and AI so they were the ones who disguised themselves with the old um clothes and they made themselves look like they came on a long journey and they gave themselves old wine skins filled with old wine to show that it's been such a long time they had rotting bread everything they thought of everything and Joshua didn't pray about it made an alliance with them it comes out that they lied to Joshua Joshua can't get mad at them because he never went to the Lord about it so what Joshua does is that because you have deceived us you're going to be our servants forever and what the end up being is they are servants uh at the temple so you will always see in Scripture A Gian night in the area of the temple so Nehemiah is giving the work to Gentiles all right let's continue and Jon the marinite the men of gibian and of mispa Unto the Throne of the governor on this side the river so we have gentiles next unto him repaired yuil the son of harah of the goldsmiths next unto him also repaired Hanah the son of the apothecaries and they fortifi jwim unto the broad wall so Goldsmith obviously is someone who worked with gold uh and the apothecaries is like an ancient pharmacist um another interpretation of it is a perfumer anyways potato potato so um you have white caller people working on this Matt and you have goldsmiths like Matt and you have apothecaries like me working on it okay both equal you know responsibilities and stuff very different skill sets but willing hurs working towards the same goal so we have Gentiles we have white collar we have blue collar and as you move on you see here and next unto them repaired Rafi the son of her the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem okay wow so this is essentially and you see this a lot in this chapter where like there's a lot of these towns have they rule half of it it's not like a full mayor of the city or whatever like it's like a half mayor so we have you know the executive we have the the highest Echelon of society working on this and next onto him repaired uh repaired shalum the son of hes the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem he and his daughters so he's this guy is the ruler of the other half of Jerusalem and what's interesting about this one is that him and his daughters are the ones repairing it okay that's interesting so you got Gentiles you have goldsmiths you have apothecaries you have rulers and women it's interesting and after after him prep the priest the men of the plane and you have the priesthood everyone here is rolling up their sleeves and going to work there's no egos here okay so despite the status of their wealth level of Education whether or not they're even experienced working at repairing you know stone walls and Gates Building towers and making sure that the the gate is straight when you build it and it's all it's everyone everyone's part of it and what was the number one requirement was the number one requirement you need to have at least five to 10 years of stonean uh credentials you need to go to the stone University you need to have grade a stone tools and maybe we'll interview you no it was everyone and their dog can come and help because desperate times call for desperate desperate measures and when you see I don't mean this wrong but when you see in Scripture that like he and his daughters are helping that's that's when you know okay everyone's in when the Bible mentions the women it's it's very for a very specific reason so you have all tribes working on it you have people from the Royal tribe of J Judah you have you know the benjamites you have everyone working on it you have the priesthood you even have the high priest working on and we'll get to that in a little bit so at the end of the day it didn't didn't matter what they brought to the table God didn't care all he cared about was were you willing and do you want to fix the situation okay and so what what does that mean for us so if we go to First Corinthians chap 12 starting at verse 13 for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be bonded or free and have been made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many if the foot shall say because I'm not the hand I am not of the body is it therefore not of the body and if the ear shall say because I'm not the eye I'm not of the body is it therefore not of the body if the whole body were an eye where were the hearing if the whole were hearing where were the smelling but now hath God set the members of every one of them in the body as it hath pleased him and if were all one member where were the body but now are they many members yes yet but one body so it makes a bit more sense in the Amplified for by one Holy Spirit we're all baptized into one body spiritually transformed United together whether Jews or Greeks Gentiles slaves or free and we were all made to drink of one Holy Spirit since the same Holy Spirit fills each life for the human body does not consist of one part but of many Limbs and organs if the foot says because I'm not a hand I'm not part of the body is it not on the contrary still a part of the body if the ear says because I'm not an eye I'm not part of the body is it not on the contrary still a part of the body if the whole body were an eye where would the hearing be if the whole body were an ear where would the sense of smell be but now as things really are God has placed and arranged the parts in the body each of them just as he will and saw fit with the best balance of function if they were all a single organ where would the rest of the body be but now as things really are there are many parts different Limbs and organ orans but a single body I thought the amplifi did a great job there because God has placed and arranged the parts in the body each one of them just as he willed and saw fit with the best balance of function okay it is God who places in orders each person in the body as a whole locally in the body and everywhere because he is the master builder and he knows what he's doing so a Church body is a variety of members and each church is different from one another you have churches who are more emotional and you got churches who are a bit more teaching and you have ones that are you know more gifts on display but it's all the one body you got churches who are very focused on missions they're missions missions missions and God has a reason for that because each person each Church in the body has a different role for a different reason and and not everyone can be the same thing okay so every person no matter the variety of members God has placed each and every one of us in the body for a particular purpose and for a reason and all through your life God has ordered your life in such a way to prepare you for the position that you're in and it's always a continual training everything that you go through is for training the good and the bad and it's up to you whether or not you're going to learn from it so if you want to be of use be thankful for the things that AR that that that you know sharpen you down as iron sharp with iron so another man sharpens another man like it it's you need that friction in your life to constantly make you uh keep you on your toes to be of use to the body to to to be in the channel and without those trials without those moments of just clinging to the Cross you're you're going to just Sail on through life and you're not going to be of any use to anybody because it's only through great suffering do you have great blessings and it doesn't mean that the most suffering person is automatically going to get the most blessings it's not it's not the equation okay but what it means is that without the honing without the grindstone without the day in day out God rubbing those those bad spots away from your life you're not going to be of use you're not going to be of the the most potential that you need to be so uh there's a great quote here from a prisoner God sometimes takes his people out like that and shaves a few of their own wheels off shows them that they just can't do what they want to do you know what I mean they're not in Liberty to do what they want to do before they could come into full power and be a love slave to Christ they have to be shaved off and then presented sometimes he takes them to the desert to do that to shave them off and then bring them out the anointed one to fulfill the purpose that he's ordained to be number one example of that is Moses you have someone who's been for 40 years trained by the Egyptians to be the best possible General to be the best possible pharaoh to be the best possible everything that you can be and God has to go out for 40 years and beat it all out of them and brother Carmen talks talked about it he gave him an equally tempered wife and that's what God used he used his wife and a bunch of sheep to prepare arguably one of the greatest prop phets the Bible has ever seen to be ready to deliver his people from the greatest nation at the scene so God can use anything like there there's times where we're like oh man if I could just get away and just be a Hermit and not have to deal with people it doesn't matter if you bring your wife and your kids and your dog God's going to use it if you just bring your dog God's going to use it it doesn't matter God's going to use anything and if it's just you he'll use the weather it's say God is not bound by anything we we are the ones who think that we can get away with it but God knows so everyone in the church body whether it be the local body or the the the greater body has the one goal to further the kingdom of God doesn't matter what we bring to the table doesn't matter how little we think we are or how important how unimportant we think we are how little people may notice you or thank you God is not limited by your thoughts God is not limited by your complexes he's not limited by your upbringing he's not limited by your lack of intelligence or your abundance of of intelligence he's not limited by the people around you he's not limited by your resources around you nothing is can limit God here because Satan what what what is Satan trying to do he's trying to constantly undermine you and your effect in the local body so he's trying to use whatever he can to to to siphon the effectiveness of your life and that's why we have to be conscious and and and always examining our lives in terms of the things that are filling up our time for one and also examining our life for things that are displeasing to the Lord and that's where you know phones are obviously the the the most obvious one that's filling up everyone's time but it could be you know a complex that you have or a way of thinking or if you're constantly like I'm I'm the lowest one I'm I'm no good I'm no matter what it is it's you're the one limiting yourself your confession your confession is important you know like I just said like out of the mouth is life and death it doesn't mean that you have to be you know I'm the greatest all the time that's not that's not what we need to be but you don't need to just do the job of the devil where you just pound yourself into the ground until you're making it easy for him so throughout your life Satan is always examining you he's always looking at okay why is this guy's weakness and he's constantly trying to probe and push wherever he can to get you to crumble and you know throughout your life he doesn't let up he's always active he's always trying to push probe no matter what it is and that's why we always have to be like the um the 300 with with kidon where we constantly have to be aware constantly examining constantly feeding in order to be aware and have the discernment to recognize the devil at every one of his tricks because like brother Bram said the devil is allowed one punch and you got to cover that area all your life constantly and it's your job it's your job to cover that now how do you cover that read your Bible and pray everything comes back to that so we have an adversary you you read in Zechariah there's a a vision that um Zachariah has of the high priest and he's he's dressed in filthy robes you have the angel Lord on one side and you have the devil on the other accusing him and the high priest is uh the the angel Lord says to him give him pure white clothing but the thing of it is is that the devil's right there accusing him constantly and throughout our life the devil's just right there constantly accusing no matter if it's true or not he's constantly accusing and that's why you got to discern every thought that comes in because he's not coming in you know I'm the Devil he's not going to be that obvious he's go like for a Believer he's going to be coming in slly he's going to be coming in subtle and that's why you got to examine every thought that comes in is it of God or is it of not don't let any Nest be built up okay this next uh quote here if God when I was in alien from him so loved me till he stooped down to get me and pick me up that gives me confidence that he wants to use me he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen something in me he's seen something in you he had a reason to save you look at the people that's unsaved today look at the millions he could have took beside you but he took you amen no one can take your place you're in God's economy no one can do that that's his love to you then why then won't Your Love reach right back to him and there's a love affair so essentially what he's saying here is that the grace of God to you is that he chose you despite your upbringing despite you know the coffees being criminals he chose dad a hippie you know with a giant afro who had no more a red AF afro with no more consciousness of God than Jo blow down the road but what did God see God saw that c genina God and said that's my son and he's going to start a work which he did not of anything of that he can lay claim to not of his own Merit but God chose him and he chose you and he chose you for a purpose and no one can take your place no matter how much the devil may say likewise or you may say to yourself likewise you have a purpose you have a place and God will use you and he doesn't need you to be perfectly prepared yourself he's he's going to take you and he's going to go Smash and then start rebuilding you okay he's going to take all the old uh things that your parents planted in you that should never be planted you in terms of complexes or issues or whatever he's going to he's he's going to work with you mold you prepare you it's going to take time but once he has you in a place where he can use you then it's a matter of yielding it's a matter of saying Here I Am Lord send me amen and after that you have to trust that wherever he sends you he will take care of you no matter what happens especially when it's all going to ruin around you we all have those Seasons where it's just it feels like there's four trains coming at you from every direction and if God has placed you there having done all the stand you stand even though the trains are getting closer you got to trust I love the quote brother brandom I don't have it here but he talks about how I he says I love those moments where I come up to a cliff and and he says I don't know what to do and what God does is that he either takes me above the cliff or he takes the cliff away God is not limited by time matter our space he's not limited by our thoughts he's not limited by Satan he's not limited by circumstances and God is a master of the last second answer you look at the three Hebrew children when did he answer when they were in the fire everyone is falling dead around them nothing's happening okay we're good I guess we're going to step in step in nothing happens okay I guess we'll just walk around and then they see the Fourth Man In The Fire And what what is the only thing that burns what's the only thing that goes away in the situation the Rope binding them and their enemy the guard that threw them in there that's the only two things it's at the end of the trial is the reward you have need of patience because God or brother Bram talks about overcoming he said overcoming is not God having you in a pipe God reaching his hand in going you overcame that's not overcoming God has a part for you to play in it and that's why you you see in the greatest battle ever fought my favorite message and he talks about that little chick and he said that chick has one Instinct it's desperate for life and what do it do it does the only thing that it knows to do at that point which is to Peck and Peck and peck on the same spot it has no idea why it's doing that and it's just going to keep on pecking until what it's through and if any one helps that thing it stunts it forever so you got to let it Peck and Peck and Peck until the whole thing it it headed through but it's still got to Peck because the whole thing got to go and as soon as that chick is out it's free and it has the strength that it needs to last the entire Journey amen that's right so that's why when it comes to the Christian walk the most important thing with the birth is the death the death before the birth is the order without the without the death there's no birth without the death there's no life without the death there's no strength amen and you see it with people they have a dried eyye confession and they never change and they're of no use to anyone or to themselves but what God requires in his children is the death amen and when you have really died and you know it you know when youve really died it's like I've I've said this before John said I I I had the worst sounding conversion experience he has ever heard in his life it was miserable and the only other person I know of that had a similar one was Mom where you know everyone knows with Mom it's strong Irish Catholic Family a lot of issue and God just throws in a hand grenade and boom but God allowed it and through through that she gets the Holy Ghost and for me was the same thing I had to die hard so that I knew that anything that I could do afterward had to be because of him because I started off so low so unconfident so broken I knew that anything that I could accomplish from then on out was him and not me I was a wreck I was a wreck cuz what did God do he broke me but then what does he do he starts remolding you his gentleness has made me great David talks about in Psalms and it's through those moments of that death experience it feels like the worst thing in the world but it's the tender hand of Jehovah because why when you're pecking through that experience what you don't realize is that it's giving you the strength to the next journey and no one else can help you you got to do it yourself God has no grandchild you got to do it and when you come up to those moments you just start pecking you just start calling out to Father God to Father Eagle I'm coming I'm coming okay so just turning here so with the uh the book of nemiah you see there's mentions of Gates and walls okay so if we see here in Nehemiah 3 verse three but the fish gate to the sons of H built who also laid the beams thereof and set up the doors thereof the locks thereof and the bars thereof So within the the the city of Jerusalem there's 10 Gates which we can see here in wow that's small okay I'll read it out so there's 10 Gates the fish gate the Sheep the fish gate the Sheep gate the inspection gate the East Gate the horse gate the water Water Gate the fountain gate the dung gate the valley gate and the old gate and they all had their different uses uh the Sheep gate is the gate in which the uh Temple priests would bring the sheep and the different sacrifices into the temple so that's where that was located and you can see it's right at where the temple was the fish gate is where the uh the fishermen of the sea gallilee would bring in their fish to sell which is strange because it's up near the temple but that's where it was the inspection gate is has to do with the military where uh David would uh inspect his men and then all the way down to the dung gate that's where all of Jerusalem's refuge and rubbage was taken out through so they would take it out to the valley of uh there's a valley there below and they would burn it so there's 10 Gates and all throughout everyone's building it and some people are building a gate some people are building just a wall some people are building a weight and a wall and a gate some people are building pools some people are building Towers there's a lot to it but you know you look at the Sheep gate you know that that's high visibility the temple priests go through there a lot of prestige I got the Sheep gate guys and they come down to the dung gate I got the dungate Nehemiah chose me for the dungate who is volunteering for the dungate I'm sure Joe was okay God bless you brother Joe so no one had a choice in the matter of what part of the wall they were given Nehemiah here is a type of the Holy Ghost where it's selecting the right person for the job the right person for the Sheep gate was the high priest and the priest those were the ones who built the Sheep gate because it had to be done in a certain way and you go through there's different rulers there's different Merchants there's different people taking care of each wall but who wants the dungate it's where all the trash goes all the rubbish it stinks so the problem is is that if someone who is chosen to do the dungate is driven by ego and they don't want to do it the city is still at risk every part of the city has to be restored for everyone to be safe every part the good parts and the bad parts the good jobs and the bad jobs someone got to do it they got to do it well they got to do it willingly and they got to do it they got to do it otherwise it's a way for the enemy to get in so what does that mean for us continuing from 1 Corinthians 12 and the IE cannot say unto the hand I have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet I have no need of you name much more these members of the body which seem to be be more feeble are necessary and which seem to be more more feeble or I think I read reread that verse 23 and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon those we bestow more abundant honor and on our uncomely parts or like ugly Parts have more abundant comeliness for our comely Parts have no need but God has tampered the body together having giving more abundant honor to that part which lacked that there should be no Schism in the body but that the members should have the same care for one another and whether one member suffers all members suffer with it or one me member be honored all the members Rejoice with it now you are the body of Christ and members in particular again in the Amplified the I cannot say to the hand I have no need of you nor again the head to the feet I have no need of you but quite the contrary the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are absolutely necessary and as for those parts of the body which we consider less honorable these we trait with greater honor and our less presentable parts are treated with greater modesty while our more presentable parts do not require it but but God has combined the whole body giving greater honor to that part which lacks it to the part that needs it so that there be no division or Discord in the body that is lack of adaption of the parts to each other but that the parts may have the same concern for one another and if one member suffers all the parts share the suffering and if one member is honored all Rejoice with it now you collectively are Christ body and individually you are members of it each with his own special purpose and function so you see it with with the body if the smallest part of the body gets hurt the whole body is aware of it and the body starts sending it the resources and it's and whatever it needs to help fix that thing but what Paul is saying here is that the the the more comly parts don't need the greater appreciation it's the uncommonly parts those are the ones that need it and I was trying to think of the um of something in the body that's like ugly and everyone can't stand and you know other than Dad hating his gallbladder that's the only thing I can really think of but the one thing is mucus everyone hates it but it's necessary because without mucus you're defenseless cuz mucus is is is a is a substance that the body creates to lubricate the whole body it's needed in the body to catch any germs or any diseases that come in and then expels it it's a necessary part of the body but the body needs it we may not like it during the process of it but it's doing the job that it was designed to do it's an uncomely part a necessary part of the body that without it the body suffers or could die there are other things like the little finger the small insignificant little finger the little finger may not be the mightiest it might not be the thumb that can do so much with the index finger but the little finger constitutes 50% of your grip strength and in ancient Japan the way they would um punish captured Samurai was by cutting off above the first knuckle the little finger cuz without that little finger you couldn't grip a sword so that Samurai a was defense was defenseless and was then reliant on other people to protect him because the way their swords were they had to have that that little finger for the grip strength so it's little but it's mighty and without it the body is hindered okay and same thing in the body there are certain positions in the body that may seem unnecessary AR or unrecognized or whatever it may be but without certain positions the body will suffer this great quote here that I found um 64 the voice of the sign you're each one set in God economy just for its place one fasts all the all the time and communes with God while another one casts out Devils because this one is fasting but it's the whole body of Christ working together the unity so the preacher is having all this this success why oh he's this great Gifted Man and God is with him all that stuff yes for sure but it you're discounting all the other people behind that man fasting praying laboring and helping that man to get where he needs to be because you look at a pastor a pastor is nothing without his wife laboring behind the scenes helping him losing out on all the time that she deserves for the family you look at you know the prayer Warrior before the special meeting some of the greatest special meetings we ever had was because of praying people so the one person who's casting out the Devils may get all the credit but it's the guy behind the scenes fasting and praying unseen that is causing God to move in the first place and without that man fasting there's no move of God each part is critical and it it it's uh each part benefits each each other by relying on each other and what it is is that both the one who's casting out the Devils has to realize that it's only by the grace of God a that he's doing it and B is the guy praying behind him that God is answering and without that humility the body will suffer so if we go to the next one here that's it every piece in the church must work together and must keep up your part of it so we see what time we're living in we may be closer than we think we are and that's why this is especially important in this day and age because according to the vision of the Bride that brother brandham saw each bride member had to be in unison in Step together and that unity and that Harmony is essential before the Rapture because without it it's Discord and God God is not the author of confusion and that's why God is allowing the tests that's why God is allowing the trials that's why God allows issues to arise in the church to rub the bumps off each other to allow us to get into greater Harmony because if you go off by yourself the only one that suffers is you that's not true everyone suffers because you pull away because you're depriving the body of your lick of fire and your position it's no different than the body if the body if one part stops working the whole body is going to start suffering for it the body may get by with without the spleen for a little bit and it can get by but it's not going to be functioning as highly as it would before but as you get into the critical things it's going to start even uh worsen from there so each member of the body has to appreciate has to uphold and it has to be thankful for each and every person that it's with because without that the whole body will be start going to Discord that's why it's so important to thank people for what they do it's so important to to praise them for what they do should someone be able to to do it without it absolutely but it doesn't mean that you never give them that because you don't know what people need it's like a minister the best thing you can do for a minister is thank him thank for what he did especially like with special meetings where they're laboring for three days or three services or whatever they are spent thank them they're not going to mind okay so this kind of lines up with this next scripture here for through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the father now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints in the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together growth unto a Holy Temple in the Lord in whom you're also building together for a habitation of God through the spirit so we are fitly framed together just like Solomon's Temple God is working shaping honing putting people in the right positions letting people leave to go into their own position that's why we don't give people you know a hard time if they do leave because God is leading them and God is obligated to them to lead them so each person has to be in the right place for the whole body to then be a function and a force so if you are in a position that's kind of like the dungate it's an underappreciated position it's a position that's not recognized it's a position that may not get a whole lot of credit it's a position that goes unseen and unthanked for a long time you are built for that role and you need to be able to do that role in day out without anyone having to hey you need to pray today you need to be able to do that yourself and if you are in that position God requires it of you to be thankful to be in that position you got to be content whatsoever place you find yourself and if God has something greater for you praise the Lord but you got to be found serving in the position that you're in you look at David where was he he was found serving in the position before he became king he was found serving humbly quietly in his father's she fold you have to have character in each position that God places you in and to be thankful to be in that position you look at Joseph same thing he was thankful and God blessed him even when he was in prison God blessed him because he was thankful when he was part of uh paar's uh household God will not give you something that you can't handle he builds you he grows you he uh it's like an Isaiah he talks about like I will harden you to hard things God is a good trainer he's a good coach he's slowly building up you look at their businessmen you didn't start off with a full business we start off small and then it growed and it growed as you had the character and the strength they handle it okay but when you're in those positions say like Joseph in the prison what a frustrating place to be in where is the promise of God I'm stuck here what what am I doing here but part of the process of him producing life was him suffering for it and without that suffering period without that growth and character he went from a boy rejected by his Brethren and sold into slavery he has to go through that process of forgiving them through those years he has to go through the the the the the process of gaining character to be able to handle situations correctly for the time that when his the people that hurt him the most came back to him that he would treat them correctly did he test them yes but he forgave them and he went through the process and found that they were changed then he revealed himself so when if you're found in a position that you you may not appreciate or you feel that you're not used to your greatest potential God requires patience of you because if you are constantly wanting something greater God cannot give it to you because clearly you can't handle it but if you're willing to wait if you're willing to have patience in that position let God use you to the greatest potential within that position then he can start using in a greater way no matter what it is if it's the housewife praying at home i' I've said it before that it it God calls it or saying god brother brandom calls it the Fifth Gospel it's such a critical function within the body is is the mother praying for her children but at the end of day if God has chosen you for for that role you just you got to work through it you got to have patience but God sees the Unseen sacrifices he sees the the the the countless hours spent where no one sees it God see the struggles he sees the frustrations but God doesn't have any unpaid bills so you look here Hebrews 10 cast not away therefore your confidence which have great recompense of reward for you've need of patience that after you've done the will of God you may receive the promise for yet a little while and that and he that shall that shall come will come will not t now the just shall live by faith and if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back unto predition but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul so you can't draw back you can't draw back you got to continue and continue and continue and if that's the role that God has for you the rest of your life then serve Faithfully be found faithful when he returns Moses no one else could take his place no one else could do the job he was ordained to do it and brother and sister if you got to eternal life you areain to do a certain thing maybe a good housewife maybe something else but nobody can take her place God has made you a place don't try to take someone else's place that's carnal impersonation see shows there's something wrong with you be what you are just exactly don't be nothing else and it's true don't try and act outside of what God made you be who you are if you're a shouter be a shouter if you're a crier be a crier if you're neither raise your hands be what God has made you to be there's nothing worse than people copying because what what what's it do it does nothing God's not pleased with it people usually can see through it it's doing nothing so just be yourself if you're a teacher be a teacher if you're a housewife be a housewife if you're a deacon be a deacon don't try to be something else if you're a businessman be a businessman be the best businessman you can possibly be but you got to be contended in your place you can't be something else you can't be chasing something that's not yours to have God's not pleased with it it will go nowhere you'll just have scars from it so the last bit here is um talking about just a contrast and Leadership that we see in Nehemiah 3 so in verse one then Elish the high priest rose up with his Brethren the priest and they builded the Sheep gate they Sanctified it and set up the doors of it even with the Tower of Maya they Sanctified it unto the Tower of henel so Nehemiah gives the vision for the people the ministry take a hold of and they lead they're the first ones and they lead by example Ministry leads the way and the people follow but we have a contrast here so in verse five and next onto them the dees repair but their nobles put not their nexts to the work of their lord and The Deco were just a a city outside of Jerusalem and the Nobles refused to be a part of the work but nowhere do you see Nehemiah going up there and rebuking them dragging them back to the post to do the job he doesn't do it because the principal St still is true it's whoever is of a willing heart so what happens the de coites despite their nobles not doing it the decoit they continue to work doesn't matter about the Nobles we're still going to do it and they take care of their part and not only do they take care of their part they go above and beyond if you go to verse 27 after them the Toco repar another piece over against the great tower that lith out even until the wall of oel so despite leadership in their life failing they finished the job that they were ordained to do and they did another piece they went the Second Mile and what does that say it says that even with ineffective leadership in your life you can still be a blessing above and beyond what you can think or imagine you look at a church if a Pastor is not what he should be the people can still run the people can still be a blessing the church can still be a blessing above and beyond a family despite the mom or the dad not being where they need to be can still be a blessing the children can still be an effect is it harder yes 100% is harder way harder but just because someone above you fails doesn't mean that you fail and what it what what it is is that God all God knows what you can handle and I've seen it that when people go through those situations where they're left on their own to deal with it at a time where they should never have to deal with it it makes them strong makes them very strong and you see you know you see you know uh with certain churches we like if the ministry is not where it should be and the people don't care and they still push forward it creates strong Christians very strong Christians grounded Christians Christians who know how to talk to their God because there is a desperation that comes when God takes away something critical from you and what it is is that God is calling someone up higher that despite the circumstance that you're in you can grow despite missing something critical and here the too is are an example of that you can go above and beyond despite missing critical people in your life you have no excuse because true Holy Ghost leadership you see here in in verse 5 they thought they were above it they put not their nexts to the work we're Nobles we shouldn't have to do it but you see the high priest do it you see the other rulers and nobility do it because the basis of Holy Ghost leadership is humility it has to be humility be before you can lead you got to learn how to follow because you look at the example is Christ he you see here but he made himself a no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of man and being found in fashion of man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him name which is above every name so that has to be it has to be this the basis of Holy Ghost leadership is humility having a servant's heart and laying aside your ego CU you didn't bring anything to the table when God called you it's only by grace that you are where you are and anything you accomplish is only because of God's grace to you and and at a moment's notice God can take it from you when you were little in your own eyes that's what Samuel said to Saul when Samuel took away the kingdom when you are little in your own eyes that's when you were at your at your most and that's why you have to be so careful with success because if you let the success go to your head and you take credit for it you're bound for a fall that's why you always got to keep yourself grounded always just recognizing the how how much grace God has given us because without it you'll become exalted in your heart and proba Goth before a fall all right if the musicians want to come we can close out so in Romans 12 for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God hath dealt to every man The Measure of Faith for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and every one members one of another having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of Faith or Ministry let us wait on our ministering or he that teacheth on teaching or he that exhorteth on exhortation he that giveth let him do it with Simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that showeth Mercy with cheerfulness let love be without dissimilation or hypocrisy upore

and curse not rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep be of the same mind one toward another mind not high things but condescend to Men of low estate be not wise in your own conceits and the Amplified the last verse there says live in harmony with one another do not be hotty conceited self-important exclusive but associate with humble people those with a realistic self viw do not overestimate yourself so if you want to stand we close out here with uh this quot so we want to keep it running smoothly sweetly and in order of the Lord so just remember that your part may be the mainspring or it may be the little some little hand or some little part or the winding stem whatever it may be or it may be the hands on the face of the cloth that tells the time whatever it is it takes all us all working together in harmony with the Gospel of Jesus Christ to bring this to pass so at the end of the day it it's it's not about what you think you are it's about what God thinks you are and we got to be careful that we don't limit the effectiveness of our life by putting ourselves in a lower position than what we actually are because if we're going to be a a a Victorious people you know going into the Rapture every part of our life has to be in line and in order we got to be fitly framed in the in the body of Christ we have to be serving to the best of our ability no matter what every day and without that you know it's just God is going to have to discipline you he's going to have to whip you into shape to get where you need to be so the whole point of this here tonight is that it's an equal playing field everyone's the same in God's sight it's us who arrange ourselves into this guy's big I'm little this person's very little I'm big it's only us that do that not God and every one of us has a purpose and God is waiting to release that purpose to the body to the blessing of the body all right let's pray dear Jesus we just thank you for this day we just
