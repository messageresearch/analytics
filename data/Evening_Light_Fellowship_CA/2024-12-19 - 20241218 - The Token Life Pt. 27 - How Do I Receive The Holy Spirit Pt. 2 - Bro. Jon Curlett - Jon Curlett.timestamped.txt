[39:21] 238 very familiar scripture it says now
[39:25] then Peter said unto them repent and be
[39:28] baptized every one of you in the name of
[39:30] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[39:32] and ye shall receive the gift of the
[39:34] Holy Ghost for the promis is unto you
[39:37] and to your children and to all that are
[39:39] a far off even as many as the Lord Our
[39:42] God shall call amen God bless you you
[39:44] can have your seats this evening as you
[39:45] can imagine we're continuing our series
[39:48] on on the Holy Ghost and I want to take
[39:50] a a second service on how do I receive
[39:52] the Holy Spirit and before I do I wanted
[39:54] to make a clarification from last
[39:56] service since I made such a big deal
[39:58] about uh about the the scripture that
[40:01] I'm about to talk about and I stand by
[40:03] my comments and I stand by my references
[40:05] but I got some things kind of crossed up
[40:07] when I said it and I was quoting that
[40:09] scripture Matthew where Jesus said go
[40:11] into all nations and uh and and bring
[40:15] people into discipleship and he says
[40:16] baptizing them into the name of the
[40:19] father son and of the Holy Ghost and and
[40:22] and what happened is as I'm studying I'm
[40:23] always on my computer I I have my Bible
[40:26] there uh sometimes but usually I'm just
[40:28] reading electronically and so I will
[40:30] have different versions of the Bible
[40:31] open at different times and so what I
[40:33] had was the Amplified Bible open when I
[40:35] read that and so when I read it and I
[40:37] said I I read into the name of the
[40:39] father Son and Holy Ghost I said I've
[40:41] never read that that way how did I miss
[40:43] that and so what I read was this so I
[40:45] read in the in the service I read the
[40:47] Amplified version but indeed the King
[40:49] James version says in the name of the
[40:51] father Son and Holy Ghost so we weren't
[40:52] repeating it wrong all along but what we
[40:55] were doing I believe for most of us
[40:57] certainly the way that we read it is we
[40:58] read it the way that Peter said it in
[41:00] Acts 238 which is baptizing them in the
[41:03] name of the Lord G of Jesus Christ and
[41:06] that is not the same as the word in in
[41:08] Matthew 28:19 that word in Matthew 28
[41:11] 28:19 means into and it means to change
[41:14] your position or your condition it is
[41:17] not doing it in the name of Jesus Christ
[41:19] it's not doing it on the basis of Jesus
[41:21] Christ This is a baptism that brings you
[41:24] into the name of the Father and Son and
[41:26] Holy Ghost it's a baptism that brings
[41:27] you into Jesus Christ and the only
[41:29] baptism that'll do that Paul said in in
[41:32] Corinthians was that it was by the one
[41:34] spirit amen so it's a holy spirit
[41:36] baptism that he was talking about there
[41:39] not just water baptism so I want to
[41:41] clarify that you weren't reading your
[41:42] Bible wrong I don't have a wrong Bible
[41:44] you don't have a wrong Bible but usually
[41:46] when I'm studying a scripture I always
[41:48] take it back to the original language
[41:50] and I'd never really studied that
[41:52] scripture that much it seems so
[41:53] straightforward and simple and we've
[41:54] heard it many times but sometimes you
[41:56] just need to go look at it it and God
[41:57] will open up something and I believe it
[41:59] was a good thing that I did that amen so
[42:02] we'll come back to our service this
[42:03] morning or this evening on on how do I
[42:05] receive the Holy Spirit and I want to
[42:07] spend some time on this verse here it
[42:08] says for the promise is unto you and to
[42:11] your children and to all that are a far
[42:14] off and I want to really dwell on this
[42:16] because if we can see what what Peter's
[42:18] talking about here we'll never limit who
[42:20] the Holy Spirit can come down and touch
[42:22] you know we look so often I remember
[42:24] brother Isaiah Brooks talking about a
[42:25] young lady that came into his church one
[42:27] time and she had green hair and she had
[42:29] tattoos and she had studs and chains
[42:31] going from every different orifice and
[42:34] and extension of her head and her body
[42:37] and she came into a service and she
[42:39] received the word of the hour and she
[42:40] was baptized and she was converted and
[42:42] she received the Holy Spirit now you
[42:45] wouldn't think that somebody walking in
[42:46] off the street in one service could have
[42:48] that happen but Peter's talking about a
[42:50] whole bunch of different people here
[42:52] when we look at this and we cannot limit
[42:54] it based on how people look and how they
[42:55] talk where they're at in life how
[42:57] they're raised and these sorts of
[42:58] different things amen it's God that
[43:00] knows it's God that calls and you'd be
[43:02] surprised who responds to the word you'd
[43:04] be surprised how some of the people in
[43:06] this church looked before they received
[43:07] the holy spirit
[43:09] amen I remember I don't want to tell I'm
[43:12] Blanca's parents but I remember seeing a
[43:13] picture of her mom and her dad before
[43:15] they got saved it was quite scandalous
[43:17] if I was to be honest amen some of us
[43:19] were not some of us some of you some of
[43:22] you were definitely not the way you look
[43:23] tonight amen and and I remember brother
[43:25] Mark telling me when he went up to to to
[43:27] gr Falls they almost didn't want to let
[43:29] him in the door cuz he looked like a
[43:30] beatnik or something like that with long
[43:32] shaggy hair and and these different
[43:33] things amen but it wasn't them that was
[43:36] calling them it was God that was calling
[43:37] them and God knows how to find his
[43:39] children amen so Peter says yes it's to
[43:41] you but he's saying it's not just for
[43:42] you people today it's not just for the
[43:44] ones that are present here today but
[43:46] it's to your children it's to them that
[43:48] are far off amen and you know I've seen
[43:50] many times that people are more
[43:52] concerned about their children than they
[43:53] are about themselves but often you we've
[43:56] got a we've got a realize that it does
[43:57] us no good if we're pointing to somebody
[43:59] else and we don't get what we're trying
[44:00] to give them or we're trying to get them
[44:02] to get Peter starts off and he says
[44:04] first of all it's for you don't take
[44:06] this message don't take this revealed
[44:08] word don't take this moment and say this
[44:10] would be good for somebody else make
[44:13] sure you're included first brother
[44:14] Braham says if there's going to be one
[44:16] person going the Rapture make sure it's
[44:18] you amen I believe it's a I believe
[44:20] scripturally we know it's more than one
[44:22] but if it was to only be one you ought
[44:24] to have this confidence that I've
[44:25] received the word and God has come down
[44:27] and he's confirmed himself in my life in
[44:30] my soul and I'm going to make it if
[44:32] nobody else does Amen but after that he
[44:35] says it's for your children once you get
[44:37] it now God's got somebody else to work
[44:39] with we see on the day of Pentecost he
[44:41] had to get somebody to get it first
[44:43] brother mam said you want Revival in
[44:44] your church he says you get your fire
[44:46] lit don't say God touch somebody else
[44:48] don't say God go to do a work for
[44:50] somebody else say God do a work in Me
[44:52] God change me God do something for me
[44:54] that'll make somebody else want what
[44:56] I've got amen so let's not look to our
[44:58] children to get something we don't have
[45:00] yet but once you've got it now God's got
[45:03] somebody to work with so maybe he can
[45:05] use you to do it that's what he did with
[45:07] Peter Peter couldn't give anybody the
[45:09] Holy Ghost Peter couldn't even preach
[45:10] the inspired word until he got the Holy
[45:13] Ghost but as soon as he did he converts
[45:15] 3,000 people by the preaching of the
[45:17] word that's what it took amen it's got
[45:20] to start with somebody and I say God let
[45:22] it be me God let it be you let it be the
[45:24] the one that's praying let it be the one
[45:26] that's that seeking for somebody else
[45:28] but in ourselves we can't do anything
[45:31] God's still got to do the work but if we
[45:33] can get ourselves out of the way God can
[45:34] maybe do something and we can see a life
[45:36] in our children that's changed amen but
[45:39] so often what happens is people want it
[45:41] for their kids and what happens is they
[45:43] they just set them up for failure you
[45:45] know we've had people asked to have
[45:47] their children dedicated in this church
[45:49] and we always have a chat with them
[45:51] beforehand and you say have you been
[45:53] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[45:55] no I've never been baptized do you go to
[45:57] church no I don't go to
[45:59] church well why would we dedicate your
[46:01] child if you're not dedicated yourself
[46:04] there's no dedicating a child if the
[46:06] house isn't dedicated to God if the
[46:08] parents aren't dedicated to God then how
[46:10] is that child going to be raised in the
[46:11] nurture and admonition of the Lord we'd
[46:13] just be giving them a lie it'd be a
[46:15] Catholic lie that because I prayed over
[46:18] that child or because I laid my hands on
[46:19] that child that they're now dedicated to
[46:21] God we don't dedicate our children
[46:24] because we've taken them up and the
[46:25] pastors prayed over them we we dedicate
[46:27] them by living a life according to the
[46:29] word of God and setting an atmosphere in
[46:31] our home really this is just a formality
[46:34] that that is an expression of what we're
[46:36] already doing and that's that we're
[46:37] dedicating their lives to God by the
[46:39] lives that we live and the house that we
[46:41] have that we raise them in and we hold
[46:43] things according to the standard of the
[46:45] word of God Amen but I'll tell you this
[46:48] Jesus blessed children and I'm happy to
[46:50] do that and I've told people they met
[46:52] there we've talked to people that were
[46:54] divorced and remarried living common law
[46:56] and they have a child and what happens
[46:58] so often seen it in my own family even
[47:01] uh that they have a baby and and they
[47:03] don't themselves care about their own
[47:05] Souls but they care about the soul of
[47:07] that child and so they start to talk to
[47:09] you and they say how do I make sure my
[47:11] child is saved how do I make sure that
[47:13] my child is not going to be judged how
[47:15] do I make sure that my mistakes won't
[47:17] affect my child Jesus when they brought
[47:19] the children to him he blessed them
[47:21] doesn't say he dedicated them but he'll
[47:24] pray a blessing on them if you want your
[47:25] child prayed for all pray over them
[47:28] Absolutely I'll say God give them grace
[47:30] and mercy and turn them into a child of
[47:32] God but we can't dedicate them to him if
[47:34] the fames not dedicated themselves amen
[47:37] but the greatest mercy God gives our our
[47:39] children as parents that are living
[47:41] according to the word of God that have
[47:42] been filled with the spirit amen but I
[47:45] want to focus so much for a bit here on
[47:47] this thought of for them that are far
[47:49] off and when we look at that so many
[47:51] times and we're not wrong when we think
[47:53] it we think well it's those that are
[47:55] coming down the road we think that that
[47:57] you know knowing what we do now it's
[47:58] those that are coming in the the the
[48:00] ages to follow and the 2,000 plus years
[48:03] that are going to follow we think he's
[48:04] talking about all of those down the
[48:06] future and that's true but it also means
[48:08] those that are far away from where they
[48:11] ought to
[48:12] be and and if you look at the the root
[48:14] of that scripture it can talk about a
[48:16] long time a duration of a of a long
[48:19] period it can talk to those that are way
[48:21] away from where they're supposed to be
[48:23] but when Peter talks about this thing of
[48:26] those that are far off the root of this
[48:28] word is that there are those who are
[48:31] under the patience and longsuffering of
[48:35] God even in their Condition it's not
[48:38] about how far they are it's about the
[48:40] patience and longsuffering of God that's
[48:42] calling them despite where they are amen
[48:45] that no matter their condition no matter
[48:48] it's almost like the the you know that
[48:50] that story of the rich man that died and
[48:52] there was a vast Gulf between him and
[48:54] God this scripture is speaking of those
[48:57] that it seems like they're such a vast
[48:58] Gulf that they can never come to God
[49:00] that their lives are so messed up
[49:02] they're so filled with with drugs or
[49:04] alcohol or partying or rock and roll or
[49:07] religion as the case may be that there's
[49:09] no getting through to them this
[49:11] scripture is for them those that seem
[49:14] unsavable that seem so Bound in Pride
[49:17] and self-righteousness that are lost in
[49:19] the things of the world this scripture
[49:20] says those are the ones that this
[49:22] promise is for for those that we think
[49:25] are unsavable untouch table
[49:28] unmovable that's what this is for the
[49:31] ones that we think it's impossible for
[49:33] them to come this promise is for them
[49:36] literally what he's saying is This
[49:37] Promise is for anywhere a child of God
[49:41] is
[49:42] found you look in the scriptures they're
[49:44] found in a lot of different places
[49:45] aren't they you got Rahab a a a
[49:48] prostitute in a in a in a city that
[49:51] doesn't even know the Living God that
[49:54] worships idols and guess what he went
[49:56] and her you got a woman at the well
[49:59] that's that's got a blend of religion
[50:01] that doesn't know if she's coming or
[50:02] going she's
[50:04] broken she's broken she has no hope she
[50:07] she can't even raise her head probably
[50:09] to pray to God she's so messed up and
[50:11] guess what he still found her look at
[50:14] zakus zakus was a
[50:17] cheat nobody likes zakus he he had
[50:20] turned on his own people and yet on his
[50:23] way to go to to Jerusalem to be
[50:26] crucified
[50:27] what happened the Holy Spirit found
[50:29] him Peter was a
[50:32] coward Peter was a coward and he walked
[50:35] away in a time of Jesus greatest need
[50:37] and yet the Holy Spirit still came to
[50:39] him after he' gone off fishing
[50:42] naked Peter had gone back to his old
[50:45] ways and the Holy Spirit still came and
[50:47] found him what a promise that is it says
[50:51] God saying this is God saying you can't
[50:53] go so far that I can't get you remember
[50:56] what David said if I dwell in the depths
[50:58] of sea if that if I if I lay my head in
[51:01] Hell behold thou art with me that's the
[51:04] kind of Holy Spirit we're talking about
[51:06] when we say who can get the Holy Spirit
[51:08] how can they get it it doesn't matter
[51:09] where you are he can come and touch you
[51:12] he can drop in the the strangest of
[51:14] places for those of us that are praying
[51:16] for family for for siblings for children
[51:18] that are gone out for members that have
[51:20] left this church whatever it might be I
[51:22] say God knows where they are and if
[51:24] they're his child the promise is for
[51:27] them that are AAR off they may not even
[51:31] know who they are most of them don't
[51:33] some have been running away their whole
[51:35] lives some don't even know that they're
[51:36] a child of God and the Holy Spirit says
[51:39] I'm going to go find them this promise
[51:41] is for each and every one of them amen
[51:43] listen to what Paul would say a little
[51:44] further on in Romans
[51:47] 9 he says that he might make known The
[51:51] Riches of his glory on the vessels of
[51:53] Mercy which he has a for prepared under
[51:56] Glory remember there's vessels of Wrath
[51:59] there's vessels of Destruction and
[52:00] there's vessels of Mercy look who these
[52:03] vessels of Mercy are they're they're not
[52:06] vessels that have mercy they're vessels
[52:08] that receive Mercy he says even us whom
[52:11] Heath called not of the Jews only but
[52:14] also of the Gentiles as he saith also in
[52:17] Hosea I will call them my people which
[52:20] were not my people and I will call her
[52:23] beloved which was not beloved so you
[52:26] have is Israel that was chosen remember
[52:28] he calls Abraham and Jacob and Isaac and
[52:31] all those different ones and they have
[52:33] this promise to come out but in the book
[52:35] of Hosea he says I'm going to go to
[52:37] those that aren't of the lineage of
[52:38] Abraham I've got a people out there and
[52:41] their vessels to receive mercy and they
[52:43] don't have a clue and I'm going to call
[52:45] them beloved who I've never called
[52:47] beloved before before that all they got
[52:49] was judgment all they got was God using
[52:52] them as a tool to to chastise Israel for
[52:55] their unbelief and then God would come
[52:57] in and he'd wreck them up again and they
[52:59] had these ups and downs of being used by
[53:01] God and then discarded by God horrible
[53:03] people and idolatry and and their lives
[53:06] and shambles and sensuality and all
[53:08] these things and God said out of those
[53:10] people I'm going to find vessels of
[53:12] Mercy I'm going to call them beloved
[53:15] who's the Beloved church it's the Bride
[53:16] of Jesus Christ he says I'm going to go
[53:19] get people that don't even know who I am
[53:21] and I'm going to turn them into my
[53:23] multinational multi-member bride
[53:27] he says and it shall come to pass that
[53:29] in the place where it was said unto them
[53:32] ye are not my people there shall they be
[53:35] called the children of the Living God
[53:38] he'll pull them out of situations he'll
[53:40] pull them out of religion he'll pull
[53:42] them out of common law relationships
[53:44] he'll pull them out of rock and roll
[53:45] he'll pull them out of wherever they are
[53:48] and you say God isn't in it God's not in
[53:50] him but he's got vessels of Mercy that
[53:52] are embedded in those places and he
[53:54] comes along and he steps and he grabs
[53:56] them out and he says you're mine you're
[53:58] mine you're mine you're mine we're
[54:01] blessed to be born into this but not all
[54:03] of us were and God in his great
[54:06] predestination knowing those names on
[54:08] the Lamb's Book of Life came down and
[54:10] said I don't care where you're found
[54:13] what I care is what's inside of you cuz
[54:16] I placed it there and he's coming and
[54:18] he's seeking after that which he has
[54:19] planted a long time
[54:21] ago that's what he's doing in these
[54:25] situations he's going out to where you
[54:27] say there's nothing there and he says
[54:29] I've got one I've got two and you don't
[54:33] know who they are and you won't believe
[54:35] it until you see it who my children
[54:37] are listen to what brother Braham says
[54:39] he says he redeemed you a seed that was
[54:42] forn by God whose names were put on the
[54:45] Lamb's Book of Life before the
[54:47] foundation of the world and that Gospel
[54:50] Light of the Resurrection the
[54:52] confirmation of the word he says how did
[54:54] we know he was the Christ because he
[54:57] proved what he talked
[54:59] about he says How will I know the
[55:01] message of the hour he says God proves
[55:03] what he promised and he talks about it
[55:07] that is the identification that we are
[55:09] beneficiaries with him in the
[55:11] resurrection he proves what he has
[55:13] talked about now let me stop there
[55:15] because we have to be honest in our
[55:16] lives we have to be honest in our walk
[55:18] with God in our relationship with Christ
[55:21] we have to be able to look at ourselves
[55:22] in the mirror of the word and say this
[55:24] is where I am it's not wrong to say I'm
[55:28] not where I ought to be I'm not to we
[55:30] what he promised it's okay to say that
[55:33] but we don't ever want to stop there
[55:35] amen but notice what did Brother Ram's
[55:37] talking about here he says God proves
[55:40] the word by bringing it to pass but
[55:42] before he can prove it he's got to bring
[55:44] it and how does he bring it he brings
[55:47] his word he talks about it he shares it
[55:49] with us amen he tells us he warns us he
[55:52] gives us light of events that are ahead
[55:54] of us we can look in our Bible as I've
[55:56] said so many times in the past few
[55:58] months and we can see exactly where
[56:00] we're at by the word we know exactly
[56:03] where we're at we know we're at the end
[56:05] of the end we know we're at the end of
[56:07] the seventh Church age we know that
[56:09] we've been called come out of her my
[56:10] people we know that it's an individual
[56:13] Affair we know that it's the time of
[56:15] Revelation
[56:17] 108 amen we're past the prophet now now
[56:20] we're at the place where we have to take
[56:22] the book and we've got to eat it and
[56:24] it's got to do something in our lives
[56:26] this is where we're at we know it by the
[56:28] word we know it by the conditions around
[56:30] us so he yes he shows us things but the
[56:33] thing is he promises us as well he
[56:36] promises us a resurrection he promises
[56:38] us a Rapture he promises us healing he
[56:42] promises us a changed life amen he
[56:44] promises us a glorified body now do I
[56:46] have all of those working in me in their
[56:48] fulfillment this
[56:50] evening they're working but I don't have
[56:52] them all I don't have the fullness of it
[56:55] yet amen human speaking when we don't
[56:57] have something we don't like to talk
[56:58] about it God's the opposite God says
[57:01] though you may not have it though it
[57:02] doesn't appear yet I'm going to talk
[57:04] about it because when I talk about it it
[57:06] happens and then the Holy Spirit comes
[57:08] behind it and it makes it come into
[57:10] reality amen but there's that period of
[57:12] honesty we've talked about the trial of
[57:14] our faith between the promise and the
[57:17] talking and the proving or the reality
[57:19] amen and that's where we have to be able
[57:21] to say I know that he's my healer I know
[57:24] that he's my provider I know that he's
[57:26] my guide even though I don't see it now
[57:28] brother Bob sang that song the Healer
[57:30] before I came to the platform on Sunday
[57:33] and my eye was bothering me so much and
[57:35] I said Lord that's for
[57:37] me so many times I'm praying for other
[57:39] people sometimes I've got to stop here
[57:41] and say stop looking at everybody else
[57:43] and say Lord let your word be born in my
[57:45] body today listen my soul is sealed but
[57:48] this body needs the word this evening
[57:51] amen my life needs the word this evening
[57:53] my family needs the word this evening
[57:55] not just sit here and get and I'm not
[57:57] getting caught up in my high horse by
[57:58] God's grace but sometimes I have to
[58:00] check myself and say listen this is not
[58:02] just for those that are listening this
[58:04] is for you that's talking
[58:06] too what's good for the goose is good
[58:08] for the gander I need his healing touch
[58:10] and by God's grace it's gotten better
[58:12] since that service it was getting worse
[58:14] and worse and now it's getting better
[58:16] and better but it's not there all the
[58:17] way but I'm still saying he's my healer
[58:20] I'm still saying he's my provider I'm
[58:22] still saying he's alive and well that
[58:25] Jesus Christ is is not dead amen but
[58:27] he's living in me to tell the world that
[58:29] he's alive today amen that doubt not to
[58:32] stop us from believing or confessing the
[58:34] word but we know there's a gap between
[58:36] so often the believing and the
[58:38] receiving but why do I believe it
[58:41] because I'm a part of it that's why I
[58:43] believe he's come to me he's revealed
[58:45] himself to me he's revealed his message
[58:47] to me he's told me you're a part of me I
[58:51] didn't respond to Barry coffee the night
[58:53] I got saved I didn't respond to Donnie
[58:55] Reagan I responded to the almighty voice
[58:58] of God Calling My Name saying you're a
[59:01] part of me and it was so personal that I
[59:03] knew that a man had nothing to do with
[59:06] it that's what the word is supposed to
[59:09] do because remember the new birth is a
[59:11] personal revealing of Christ to me as an
[59:15] individual not a member of a
[59:16] congregation not a member of the klet
[59:19] family not a member of The Message
[59:21] Church in St John's Newland or
[59:22] conception Bas but to me because my name
[59:26] was written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[59:28] before the foundation of the world
[59:29] that's why I believe it amen that's why
[59:31] I'm here tonight amen we're a word bride
[59:34] swn before the foundation of the world
[59:37] written our names into the Lamb's Book
[59:39] of Life amen and so we're trusting the
[59:41] process we're trusting the word that
[59:43] we've received that the holy spirit's
[59:45] coming behind it and it's moving even
[59:47] when we can't see it he says what he
[59:50] promised to do in Christ he proved on
[59:52] the resurrection what he promised to do
[59:54] in the days of Moses he proved it what
[59:57] he promised in the days of Enoch he
[59:59] proved it and in all the days of the
[1:00:01] Apostles he proved it he says now in
[1:00:04] this day he proves what he said because
[1:00:07] why because they are a part of the sea
[1:00:10] that seed that was represented on the
[1:00:13] book of life that he came to redeem back
[1:00:16] to God again he says oh what a message
[1:00:19] that's a message that they received on
[1:00:21] the day of Pentecost amen they received
[1:00:23] a message that said this is the season
[1:00:26] for Joel 2:28 this is the season for
[1:00:29] Ezekiel 36 it's for a pouring out of the
[1:00:32] spirit on you a new heart a new spirit
[1:00:35] and then the personal Spirit of almighty
[1:00:37] God and it's for you it's for your
[1:00:39] family it's for your children it's to
[1:00:42] everyone that will respond to this word
[1:00:45] that's the message that they heard
[1:00:48] amen and then they lost
[1:00:50] it and then they lost it and for for for
[1:00:53] church age after church age they fell
[1:00:55] away
[1:00:56] why because they forgot what gave it to
[1:00:58] them in the first place they forgot
[1:01:01] where it came from it was not it was yes
[1:01:04] it came through the voice of Peter but
[1:01:06] it came from the Throne of God it was
[1:01:08] the word the revealed word coming to
[1:01:10] their hearts and it was the work of the
[1:01:12] holy spirit that started it and what did
[1:01:15] they do they turned to men they turned
[1:01:17] to ideas they turned to programs they
[1:01:19] turned to their own logic and
[1:01:21] reason and what did they do they put God
[1:01:24] completely out amen and then what
[1:01:27] happened after that fourth Church age
[1:01:29] God came in the fifth Church age and he
[1:01:31] said the just shall live by faith
[1:01:32] through a man called Martin Luther then
[1:01:34] he came to John Wesley he says you need
[1:01:36] to live a clean life you need to live a
[1:01:37] Sanctified life and then he came through
[1:01:39] the Pentecostal church and He restored
[1:01:41] the gifts and it was God building back
[1:01:43] to that original church but it didn't
[1:01:45] stop at Pentecost because they had the
[1:01:47] gifts but the giver was coming behind it
[1:01:50] amen they needed the fullness of the
[1:01:52] word and you can't have the fullness of
[1:01:54] the spirit without the fullness of the
[1:01:55] word
[1:01:56] that's what Peter brought was an open
[1:01:58] word
[1:01:59] amen and we know that that that that
[1:02:02] that's the way that God has been working
[1:02:04] is that we don't see the fullness until
[1:02:06] the very end we see a a sheath offering
[1:02:09] didn't we we saw a Prophet come and he
[1:02:12] showed us what an adopted son of God
[1:02:13] looks like but we're all being changed
[1:02:16] bit by bit into that very same thing
[1:02:19] whether you're a man whether you're a
[1:02:20] woman if you're a child of God you're
[1:02:21] coming to a place where he can use you
[1:02:23] like that but I want you to watch how
[1:02:26] opened it
[1:02:27] up because we know for the first while
[1:02:29] the disciples stayed in Jerusalem and
[1:02:31] they preached to the Jews and they faced
[1:02:33] lots of persecution and threats and
[1:02:35] Peter almost lost his head and an angel
[1:02:37] came and took him out of the jail but we
[1:02:40] saw in Acts 2:47 it says that the Lord
[1:02:42] added to the church daily such as should
[1:02:45] be saved God
[1:02:48] added I can't add you can't add it takes
[1:02:52] God to do it amen but who was added
[1:02:54] those who respond responded to the
[1:02:56] preaching of the word there were those
[1:02:58] that responded to the gifts those that
[1:03:00] responded to the Miracles but it was
[1:03:02] those that responded to the word that
[1:03:04] were saved we see Simon the Sorcerer
[1:03:07] remember he looks and he sees them
[1:03:09] laying hands on people and they're
[1:03:10] getting the Holy Spirit and he says
[1:03:12] teach me how to do that I'll pay
[1:03:14] whatever it
[1:03:15] takes guess what Simon didn't become a
[1:03:18] part of the church CU he wasn't
[1:03:20] responding to the word he was responding
[1:03:21] to the authority he wanted to have power
[1:03:24] he wanted to have image he wanted want
[1:03:25] to have something he could leverage for
[1:03:27] his own
[1:03:28] gain that's not who God's adding
[1:03:30] in but we come to acts chap 10 and it's
[1:03:33] the story of of the House of Cornelius
[1:03:36] and how they're saved and I want to use
[1:03:37] this as an example tonight I'm teaching
[1:03:39] I know as I go through this and and some
[1:03:41] may know it but I want it I want it to
[1:03:43] be clear tonight how we get it and who
[1:03:46] it's for and how God does these things
[1:03:49] and in Acts 10 we read that there was a
[1:03:50] certain man in cesaria named Cornelius a
[1:03:53] centurion of the band called The Italian
[1:03:55] so he's a gentile he's not a Jew but the
[1:03:58] scripture says he was a devout man and
[1:04:01] one that feared God doesn't didn't say
[1:04:03] feared a god feared
[1:04:05] God he says with all of his house which
[1:04:09] gave much alms to the people and prayed
[1:04:11] to God always so Cornelius was a Jewish
[1:04:13] convert he was a convert convert to
[1:04:16] Judaism he served as well as he knew
[1:04:19] amen he worshiped the one true God he
[1:04:21] was a kind man he was a prayerful man
[1:04:24] amen but he didn't know the Full Gospel
[1:04:26] but he lived it as best that he could he
[1:04:28] was sincere in what he did it says and
[1:04:31] he saw in a vision evidently about the
[1:04:33] ninth hour of the day an angel of God
[1:04:36] coming into him and saying unto him
[1:04:38] Cornelius and when he looked on him he
[1:04:41] was afraid and said what is it Lord and
[1:04:43] he said unto him thy prayers and thine
[1:04:45] arms are come up for a memorial before
[1:04:47] God see Cornelius wasn't just a talker
[1:04:50] Cornelius was not just a church
[1:04:52] attendee Cornelius prayed in his own
[1:04:55] prayer clock it Cornelius had his real
[1:04:57] walk with God Cornelius lived what he
[1:05:00] believed he didn't have a public life
[1:05:01] and then a private life that was
[1:05:03] different he was a sincere devout man
[1:05:05] amen what you saw out there was what you
[1:05:07] saw in here God says that's what I saw
[1:05:11] he's coming to
[1:05:13] sincerity but listen sincerity isn't
[1:05:15] going to be
[1:05:17] enough lots of sincere people there but
[1:05:19] they're only sincere as far as their
[1:05:21] religion will let them be but God's
[1:05:24] looking for people that will receive the
[1:05:25] word as it's revealed to them he says
[1:05:28] and now send men to japa and call for
[1:05:31] one Simon whose surname is Peter he
[1:05:34] lodge with one Simon a t Tanner whose
[1:05:36] house is by the seaside he shall tell
[1:05:39] thee what thou oughtest to do so
[1:05:41] Cornelius has been living a good life
[1:05:43] he's been living according to the the
[1:05:45] word as it's been revealed to him but
[1:05:47] God comes to Cornelius he says Cornelius
[1:05:50] there's more for you to live there's
[1:05:52] more for you to do there's more for you
[1:05:53] to believe you've done well I'm
[1:05:55] commending you for it and because you've
[1:05:57] done well I'm going to bring you into
[1:05:58] the rest of it he says send for a man
[1:06:01] he'll tell you how to live now watch
[1:06:03] this because God's working on the other
[1:06:05] side so often we think that we're
[1:06:07] pulling or we're pushing and what it is
[1:06:09] is God's working on both ends to bring
[1:06:10] things together I can't tell how you how
[1:06:13] many times it's happened in a service in
[1:06:15] Fellowship you just get a an unction to
[1:06:17] go talk to somebody about something even
[1:06:20] at work bring something up and what
[1:06:22] happens is somebody responds quickly to
[1:06:24] it and what is it it's God working on
[1:06:25] both ends to bring something to pass
[1:06:28] amen it's a beautiful thing when God
[1:06:30] starts moving and it's not me that's
[1:06:32] that's trying to make something happen
[1:06:33] he always prepares the way you'll find
[1:06:35] he says and when the angel which spake
[1:06:38] unto Cornelius was departed he called
[1:06:40] two of his household servants and a
[1:06:42] devout soldier of them that waited on
[1:06:44] him continually and when he had declared
[1:06:46] all these things unto them he sent them
[1:06:47] to japa now on the tomorrow as they went
[1:06:50] on their journey and Drew nigh into the
[1:06:52] city Peter went up onto the Housetop to
[1:06:54] pray about the hour and he became very
[1:06:57] hungry and would have eaten but while
[1:06:59] they made ready he fell into a trance so
[1:07:02] Watch What Happens now Peter wants to
[1:07:04] eat and God puts him into a vision about
[1:07:06] eating instead and he saw heaven opened
[1:07:09] and a certain vessel descending upon him
[1:07:11] as it had been a great sheet knit at the
[1:07:13] Four Corners and let down to the Earth
[1:07:16] and wherein were all manners of
[1:07:17] four-footed beasts of the earth and wild
[1:07:19] beasts and creeping things and and fouls
[1:07:22] of the air so You' got to realize that
[1:07:24] for the Jew there's only certain certain
[1:07:25] food that certain animals they could eat
[1:07:27] and what's coming down now is a sheet
[1:07:30] full of animals that he's not allowed to
[1:07:31] touch he's not allowed to touch he's not
[1:07:34] allowed to eat for sure so this is a
[1:07:37] horrifying thing for Peter this would be
[1:07:38] a nightmare for us because all of these
[1:07:40] are unclean animals and he's avoided
[1:07:42] these all his life and now God's
[1:07:45] bringing down something that he's
[1:07:47] avoided all his
[1:07:48] life and it's a move of God Watch What
[1:07:52] Happens now it says and there came a
[1:07:55] voice to him saying rise Peter kill and
[1:07:58] eat so this is contrary to Moses law now
[1:08:01] remember Peter knows this is contrary to
[1:08:04] moses' law but Peter is no longer under
[1:08:07] the
[1:08:07] law but Peter still has the condition of
[1:08:11] the law because he's been raised that
[1:08:13] way it's like brother visho when he came
[1:08:15] to us he tried the hamburgers and he
[1:08:18] tried the chicken and guess what he
[1:08:19] tried it for a while but guess what that
[1:08:21] old legalistic Jan nature was embedded
[1:08:24] in his DNA and he can enjoy it no matter
[1:08:26] how much we tell him how good it is it's
[1:08:28] not wrong is it it's not wrong to eat it
[1:08:31] it's not wrong not to eat it it's just
[1:08:33] how he's been raised and Peter's been
[1:08:35] raised and though he's had a new birth
[1:08:37] and the law has now been fulfilled he
[1:08:39] doesn't have to do these
[1:08:41] things it's still an abhorrence to him
[1:08:44] he wants nothing to do with
[1:08:47] it and Peter said not so Lord for I have
[1:08:51] never eaten anything that is common or
[1:08:54] unclean and the voice spake unto him
[1:08:57] again the second time what God had
[1:08:59] cleansed that call not thou calm and he
[1:09:01] says ' don't call it polluted if I tell
[1:09:04] you it's clean it's clean he says this
[1:09:07] was done Thrice it was done three times
[1:09:09] and then the vessel was received up into
[1:09:11] heaven God made sure that Peter got the
[1:09:13] gist of what was being said it didn't
[1:09:15] just come once and then disappear God
[1:09:17] repeated it three times so that Peter
[1:09:19] would have no doubts about what he was
[1:09:21] saying but watch now now while Peter
[1:09:24] doubted in himself what this Vision
[1:09:26] which he had seen should mean he doesn't
[1:09:27] know what it means he knows what it was
[1:09:29] but he doesn't know what God means by it
[1:09:31] behold the men that were sent from
[1:09:33] Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon's
[1:09:36] house and stood before the gate so this
[1:09:38] is God now orchestrating things as soon
[1:09:40] as he's got Peter ready to go then those
[1:09:42] men are at the door God's working on
[1:09:45] both ends it says and they called and
[1:09:47] asked whether Simon which was Sur named
[1:09:48] Peter were lodged there while Peter
[1:09:51] thought on the vision Peter's trying to
[1:09:52] figure out what's going on the spirit
[1:09:54] said unto him behold three men seek
[1:09:57] theee arise therefore get thee down and
[1:10:00] go with them doubting nothing for I have
[1:10:03] sent thee so these men are asking but
[1:10:06] God is
[1:10:07] sending Peter wouldn't go with three
[1:10:09] Gentiles came to his door but the spirit
[1:10:12] now moving on Peter is getting him to do
[1:10:14] something he would never have done
[1:10:16] before he says then Peter went down to
[1:10:19] the men which were sent unto him from
[1:10:20] Cornelius and said behold I'm he whom
[1:10:22] you seek what is the cause wherefore you
[1:10:25] come what do you want and they said
[1:10:27] Cornelius the Centurion a just man and
[1:10:29] one that fearth God and of good report
[1:10:31] among all the nations of the Jews was
[1:10:33] warned from God by a Holy Angel to send
[1:10:36] for thee into his house and to hear
[1:10:38] words of thee so we know what happens
[1:10:40] Peter says all right I've been told to
[1:10:42] go I'll go he walks all day with them
[1:10:45] and he walks back to cesaria and as soon
[1:10:47] as he walks down Watch What Happens it
[1:10:50] says and as Peter was coming in
[1:10:51] Cornelius met him and fell down at his
[1:10:54] feet and worshiped him but Peter took
[1:10:57] him up saying stand up I myself also am
[1:10:59] a man and as he talked with him he went
[1:11:02] in and he found many that were come
[1:11:04] together now you have to realize that
[1:11:06] for a Jew to be in the home of a gentile
[1:11:09] made them ceremonially unclean to touch
[1:11:12] a gentile made them ceremonial unclean
[1:11:15] and it separated them from the temple
[1:11:18] they had to go out they had to spend a
[1:11:19] certain amount of time they had to wash
[1:11:22] and only then could they come into the
[1:11:23] presence of God so p is now in a
[1:11:26] condition where under the law he cannot
[1:11:28] approach God he can't be in a house of
[1:11:31] worship he can't go hear the word in the
[1:11:33] synagogue he can't be with Saints of
[1:11:35] like Precious Faith he is in a
[1:11:37] precarious position according to the law
[1:11:40] and yet he's
[1:11:42] there and he said unto them you know how
[1:11:45] that it is unlawful for a man that is a
[1:11:47] Jew to go to keep company or come unto
[1:11:50] one of another Nation he says you know
[1:11:52] what you're asking me to
[1:11:54] do Cornelius you know for sure because
[1:11:56] you know what our law teaches you you're
[1:11:58] converted to it he says but God has
[1:12:02] showed me that I should not call any man
[1:12:05] common or unclean see God's not just
[1:12:07] working on Cornelius God's working on
[1:12:09] Peter because Peter's the one with the
[1:12:11] keys to the kingdom and so God's got to
[1:12:13] get him to go where Peter doesn't want
[1:12:14] to go amen sometimes we got to get a bit
[1:12:18] dirty with our gospel I don't mean that
[1:12:21] we go on Satan's territory I'm saying
[1:12:24] we've got to be able to get
[1:12:25] uncomfortable with the people we're
[1:12:26] dealing with listen not everybody that
[1:12:29] comes to God is going to come in dress
[1:12:31] right acting right talking right looking
[1:12:34] right that ain't the way they're coming
[1:12:37] in we've been lucky so far brother
[1:12:42] vichel but guess what they may be
[1:12:45] cursing they may be in our church and
[1:12:47] let something slip sometimes and you
[1:12:49] know what we're supposed to do Church
[1:12:51] look past it cuz why it's God that's got
[1:12:54] to clean them up
[1:12:55] not our not our righteous
[1:12:58] indignation not the fact that we're
[1:13:00] clean that won't clean them up them
[1:13:02] being convicted of it won't do it it's
[1:13:04] going to take a working of the Holy
[1:13:06] Spirit to change their lives amen
[1:13:09] Peter's saying I'm not supposed to be
[1:13:10] here you know I'm not allowed here by
[1:13:12] the law he says but God told me not to
[1:13:15] call you unclean and if you're not
[1:13:17] unclean I can't treat you like you're
[1:13:19] unclean I've got to give you the same
[1:13:21] opportunity I give anywhere else amen
[1:13:23] what was God doing he was undoing
[1:13:25] Peter's legalism now he was undoing the
[1:13:28] traditions of man amen God had to change
[1:13:32] Peter before he could change
[1:13:35] Cornelius can we receive that message
[1:13:37] this evening sometimes he's got to
[1:13:39] change me before he can help me change
[1:13:40] you sometimes he's got to teach me a
[1:13:43] lesson so that I can teach you the
[1:13:44] lesson amen we can't hold ourselves away
[1:13:47] from the working of the word we've got
[1:13:49] to let him do the work in us before we
[1:13:51] can help somebody else sometimes the
[1:13:53] change that's needed is not in them as
[1:13:54] much as it it's in us if we're ever
[1:13:56] going to be effective in the kingdom of
[1:13:57] God so he says God show me don't call
[1:14:00] you polluted don't call you unclean
[1:14:02] therefore came I unto you without gain
[1:14:04] saying that word without that phrase
[1:14:06] without gains saying means without
[1:14:07] objection in other words he obeyed
[1:14:11] willingly in his heart or in his flesh
[1:14:13] maybe we'd say he didn't want to go
[1:14:16] that's not where he was comfortable but
[1:14:17] God didn't have to whip Peter down the
[1:14:19] road he gave him a a vision to show him
[1:14:21] what was going to happen then he
[1:14:23] confirmed what he wanted him to do and
[1:14:25] Peter obeyed willingly he says as soon
[1:14:27] as I was sent for he says I asked
[1:14:30] therefore what intent youve sent for me
[1:14:32] he says I've obeyed the spirit I've done
[1:14:34] exactly what he said now tell me what
[1:14:36] you want and Cornelius then tells him of
[1:14:39] his own Vision how that God told him
[1:14:40] that Peter would tell him what was
[1:14:42] necessary for life and so Peter launches
[1:14:44] into this sweet little sermon it's only
[1:14:47] I think eight or 10 eight or 10 lines we
[1:14:49] would say but Cornelius has accepted the
[1:14:52] old
[1:14:53] Covenant but because he's a sincere
[1:14:56] believer God sends him the New
[1:14:58] Covenant because he's living by the word
[1:15:00] that he has God brings the word to see
[1:15:02] what he'll do with that God knows what
[1:15:04] he's going to do with it church he knows
[1:15:05] his own amen but it's so beautiful what
[1:15:08] happens here and it emphasizes why we
[1:15:10] believe as we do about how you get the
[1:15:12] Holy Spirit and how it
[1:15:14] comes and watch this because this is
[1:15:16] Peter speaking now he's giving the
[1:15:17] revealed word he's giving the New
[1:15:19] Covenant and it says and he commanded us
[1:15:22] he's speaking of Christ to preach unto
[1:15:23] the people and to testify that it is he
[1:15:26] which was ordained of God to be the
[1:15:28] judge of the quick and dead to him give
[1:15:31] all the prophets witness that through
[1:15:33] his name whosoever believeth in him
[1:15:36] shall receive remission of
[1:15:39] sins see Cornelius would have had to try
[1:15:42] to cover his sins he couldn't go all the
[1:15:44] way in as a gentile he could only have
[1:15:46] most be in the outer
[1:15:49] Court he's saying here's a way for you
[1:15:51] to get where we
[1:15:52] were but it'll be a completely different
[1:15:55] situation cuz we have to go in day after
[1:15:57] day this will do the work in one shot
[1:15:59] he's saying if you believe on this man
[1:16:02] on this this son of God that we're
[1:16:03] preaching if you accept him if you
[1:16:06] believe the words I'm telling you he'll
[1:16:07] forgive you of your sins he'll change
[1:16:08] your life and the scripture says while
[1:16:12] Peter yet spake these words the Holy
[1:16:15] Ghost fell on all them which heard the
[1:16:17] word church what brought the Holy
[1:16:20] Ghost the preaching of the revealed word
[1:16:24] that's it now listen it can start with
[1:16:27] John
[1:16:28] 3:16 for God so loved the world that he
[1:16:31] gave his only begotten son that
[1:16:33] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:16:34] perish but have everlasting life that's
[1:16:36] really what Peter preached right there
[1:16:38] because that was the revealed word for
[1:16:39] the age so don't put somebody down cuz
[1:16:42] they're preaching just John 3:16 if
[1:16:44] you'll accept that God will take you
[1:16:46] into acts
[1:16:47] 238 and it'll take you into water
[1:16:49] baptism and it'll take you into the
[1:16:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost but as he
[1:16:53] spoke these words the Holy Spirit fell
[1:16:56] why because the revealed word was being
[1:16:58] preached Paul would say in Corinthians
[1:17:00] he says for after that in the wisdom of
[1:17:02] God the World by wisdom knew not God he
[1:17:05] says it pleased God by one thing the
[1:17:08] foolishness of preaching to save them
[1:17:12] that
[1:17:13] believe this is why I do it I don't
[1:17:16] think this is the best
[1:17:19] way I'm not saying I don't believe that
[1:17:21] I'm saying there could be better Ways by
[1:17:23] intellect by by human
[1:17:26] reasoning we could we could do something
[1:17:28] uh that that that uh subliminally
[1:17:31] affects you or something like that we
[1:17:33] could do TV ads we could do all sorts of
[1:17:34] things but God says listen like it or
[1:17:37] lump it it's the foolishness of
[1:17:38] preaching that's going to do the job
[1:17:41] it's the foolishness of preaching that's
[1:17:42] going to convert Souls amen and while
[1:17:45] Peter preached the Holy Spirit fell on
[1:17:47] those people and in a moment sealed
[1:17:50] their souls to Eternity while Peter's
[1:17:53] preaching the word people were filled
[1:17:56] while people's preaching the word people
[1:17:57] were truly saved they didn't have an
[1:17:59] altar call he didn't make some big pull
[1:18:02] they didn't have a big shouting event
[1:18:03] beforehand they didn't make a scene but
[1:18:06] while Peter preached the Holy Spirit
[1:18:08] fell on them listen I'm okay with alter
[1:18:11] calls I'm okay with inviting people up
[1:18:13] we do it from time to time but it
[1:18:15] doesn't have to happen that way all that
[1:18:17] has to happen is as the word is coming
[1:18:19] you say that's for me Lord I'll take it
[1:18:22] the way you give it listen the world
[1:18:23] would say today what Peter was laying
[1:18:26] down they were picking up as the word
[1:18:28] was coming there their heart was saying
[1:18:30] I'll take it that's for me and they
[1:18:32] responding the Deep to the Deep to that
[1:18:34] word that's going and their heart is in
[1:18:36] a condition and God's standing there I
[1:18:39] can just see it in my head this evening
[1:18:41] I sometimes I think God's like a big kid
[1:18:43] and forgive me if that sounds
[1:18:44] sacrilegious but he's sitting there and
[1:18:46] he's looking for the opportunity to
[1:18:49] fulfill his word God's just looking for
[1:18:52] the chance and if that door just cracks
[1:18:54] open and just a little bit the big boot
[1:18:56] of the Holy Spirit comes in he says I'll
[1:18:58] give you my promise I'll give you my
[1:19:00] word I'll give you my spirit just give
[1:19:03] me a chance just give me a chance and
[1:19:06] you take him at one word and he'll
[1:19:08] fulfill it and then he'll give you
[1:19:09] another word and then he'll fulfill it
[1:19:11] and one after the other after the other
[1:19:14] God just wants to give it to you so much
[1:19:18] but you've got to open that door and
[1:19:20] while he's preaching Cornelius and his
[1:19:22] household devout people sincere believer
[1:19:24] Bel they said I'll accept that and as
[1:19:26] they did it their heart condition was
[1:19:28] right and God gave them the holy spirit
[1:19:30] amen God's just aching to do these
[1:19:33] things brother Braham says it this way
[1:19:34] he says be determined don't be defeated
[1:19:37] you can't be defeated you're children of
[1:19:39] God God promised the Holy Spirit to
[1:19:42] every believer he wants to give it to
[1:19:46] you tonight more than you want to
[1:19:49] receive it more than you want to receive
[1:19:52] it the desire of God is so great to have
[1:19:55] his children restored into fellowship
[1:19:57] and there's only one way we get there
[1:19:59] and it's by the Holy
[1:20:00] Spirit he says now don't tell them how
[1:20:03] you want to get it tell them you want it
[1:20:05] no matter how it comes you want it you
[1:20:08] want something to Anchor your heart and
[1:20:10] soul away till all doubts and fears will
[1:20:13] pass away and joy bells of heaven will
[1:20:16] ring through your soul he says God will
[1:20:19] take care of the rest of it see we don't
[1:20:21] come in and say God take care of
[1:20:23] everything say God give me an anchor for
[1:20:26] my soul give me something that assures
[1:20:29] me that I've been changed from I pass
[1:20:31] from Death unto life he says God will
[1:20:33] take care of the rest of it you just ask
[1:20:36] him to give you the baptism of the Holy
[1:20:39] Spirit such a beautiful picture
[1:20:43] Church sitting there maybe like we are
[1:20:45] tonight in a living room somewhere in in
[1:20:49] an open courtyard or something like that
[1:20:51] and while the word is being preached God
[1:20:54] comes down and he seals their soul to
[1:20:56] Eternity
[1:20:58] amen Peter talking about the promises of
[1:21:01] God later in one of his books he writes
[1:21:04] this and this I believe is our message
[1:21:06] here this is for us today and he says
[1:21:08] knowing this first that there shall come
[1:21:10] in the last days scoffers walking after
[1:21:13] their own lust are we there church he
[1:21:15] says it's the last days this was not for
[1:21:18] them that's for this is for us this is
[1:21:20] our scripture he says and saying where
[1:21:23] is the promise of his coming for since
[1:21:25] the fathers fell asleep all things
[1:21:27] continue as they were from the beginning
[1:21:29] of the creation see as the apostles died
[1:21:31] as Paul died as Peter died as all of
[1:21:34] them died the signs and wonders died
[1:21:36] with them in most cases they say where
[1:21:39] is God where is his coming see it was
[1:21:41] all just a farce it was just for that
[1:21:43] day there's no reality to it and they
[1:21:46] start to make fun of it and they start
[1:21:47] to live a life according to their
[1:21:50] desires CU they don't believe what God
[1:21:52] said they see how long been they see how
[1:21:55] long we've been preaching there's a
[1:21:56] Resurrection coming there's a Rapture
[1:21:58] coming there's a bride that's going to
[1:22:00] have a body change and because it hasn't
[1:22:02] happen they get cocky we've seen it with
[1:22:05] these people that criticize this message
[1:22:07] they're awfully
[1:22:09] cocky but notice what Peter says for
[1:22:12] this they are will they willingly are
[1:22:14] ignorant of that by the word of God the
[1:22:17] heavens were of old and the Earth
[1:22:18] standing out of the water and in the
[1:22:20] water they're saying he's saying the
[1:22:21] very thing that they're living on God
[1:22:23] created it
[1:22:25] he says whereby the world that then was
[1:22:27] being overflowed with water perished it
[1:22:30] took 120 years for God to destroy the
[1:22:33] Earth the way he promised and I'd
[1:22:35] imagine in year 119 they were pretty
[1:22:38] cocky Noah what are you doing Noah You'
[1:22:42] spent all this time preparing this place
[1:22:45] preparing this Ark preaching the same
[1:22:47] stupid message and nothing's happened
[1:22:50] Noah look around we've had a great time
[1:22:52] and you've lost so much time to this
[1:22:54] belief you have but in year 120 nobody
[1:22:58] was criticizing them anymore were they
[1:23:00] he says it's the same thing today but
[1:23:03] watch he says but the heavens and the
[1:23:04] Earth which are now by the same word are
[1:23:07] kept in store reserved unto fire against
[1:23:10] the day of judgment and predition of
[1:23:12] ungodly men God's not going to be mocked
[1:23:14] there's judgment
[1:23:16] coming he says but beloved be not
[1:23:18] ignorant of this one thing that one day
[1:23:20] is with the Lord as a thousand years and
[1:23:23] a thousand years is one day we've
[1:23:24] preached on this time means nothing to
[1:23:26] God but verse 9 is where I want to go he
[1:23:28] says the Lord is not slack concerning
[1:23:31] his
[1:23:32] promise you look at what brother
[1:23:34] brandham said this bride would
[1:23:36] be how much do we have today if we're
[1:23:40] honest of the Fulfillment exactly the
[1:23:43] way he preached it how much do we have
[1:23:47] half maybe 2/3 maybe do we have it all I
[1:23:51] don't believe
[1:23:53] so but the words
[1:23:55] there but the reality may not be here
[1:23:57] yet we know there's a quick short work
[1:24:00] coming we know that there's a a 30 to 40
[1:24:03] days that's coming we know there's a
[1:24:04] Resurrection coming we know God's got it
[1:24:07] mapped out in a particular timeline so
[1:24:09] that doesn't worry us but he says God is
[1:24:11] Not slack concerning his
[1:24:13] promises as some men count
[1:24:16] slackness he says see people say he's
[1:24:18] slack because it's taking so long but
[1:24:21] don't judge God according to man's
[1:24:23] condition or man's standard
[1:24:24] ards he says but he is longsuffering to
[1:24:29] usw not willing that any should perish
[1:24:32] but that all should come to repentance
[1:24:34] notice he's not longsuffering to the
[1:24:37] world he's longsuffering to you and I
[1:24:41] he's longsuffering to his children cuz
[1:24:43] he's not willing that they should perish
[1:24:45] listen the whole world is going to
[1:24:46] perish this is not who he's talking
[1:24:48] about he's talking about his children
[1:24:50] and this is a reflection of what he said
[1:24:51] to them that are a far off to them that
[1:24:54] aren't where they supposed to be to them
[1:24:57] that are on the path but not there yet
[1:24:59] he says it's his longsuffering that's
[1:25:01] holding it back so you can get into
[1:25:03] position so you can come into maturity
[1:25:05] so you can come into what God has
[1:25:07] promised he would do in this age he's
[1:25:09] saying I'm not going to let any one of
[1:25:10] them slip Jesus said I won't lose a one
[1:25:13] that you've given me Peter's warning us
[1:25:15] he says hard times are coming it's going
[1:25:17] to seem like nothing's happening it
[1:25:18] seems like the world is winning the word
[1:25:20] is losing people are going to dismiss
[1:25:23] the preaching of the word people are
[1:25:24] going to dismiss the promise of the hour
[1:25:26] but verse 9 is meant for us it says
[1:25:28] God's not slack God's not going to leave
[1:25:31] one word
[1:25:32] unfulfilled and his word was given to
[1:25:35] you and I so there's a promise for each
[1:25:37] and every us us he's not willing that we
[1:25:40] should perish how do you perish
[1:25:43] Church be separated from God that's what
[1:25:46] perish means it's not the loss of this
[1:25:48] Breath of Life it's to be separated from
[1:25:50] God he's not willing that any of us
[1:25:52] would be separated from him so what's
[1:25:54] his promise his promise is to those that
[1:25:57] are far off I'm going to give them my
[1:25:58] spirit I'm going to go out and I'm going
[1:26:00] to grab them some I might have to grab
[1:26:02] by the Scruff of the neck and some of
[1:26:04] them I might just have to give them a
[1:26:05] hug of love for
[1:26:07] once but whatever it takes from either
[1:26:10] of those extremes I'll bring them in
[1:26:12] amen he's not going to back down he
[1:26:14] wants every one of us to come to a place
[1:26:16] of repentance because that'll lead us to
[1:26:18] the holy spirit
[1:26:21] amen Watch What Happens now the Holy
[1:26:23] Spirit Falls is Peter's
[1:26:26] preaching it says in they of the
[1:26:28] circumcision see some Jews came with
[1:26:31] Peter sometimes the thing that's needed
[1:26:32] is for us to get out our tradition so
[1:26:34] that other people will we got a lot of
[1:26:36] traditions I'm speaking generally not
[1:26:39] specifically sometimes we need to stop
[1:26:41] and say you know what that's all it is
[1:26:43] is a
[1:26:44] tradition cuz when Peter went everybody
[1:26:46] else had what they had freedom to follow
[1:26:49] cuz he's got the keys to the kingdom
[1:26:51] he's being led of the Holy Spirit and
[1:26:52] they're trusting him and so the Jews are
[1:26:54] in there in the house with Peter they're
[1:26:56] ceremonially unclean because Peter was
[1:26:58] led by the spirit to get out of his
[1:27:00] legalism
[1:27:02] amen it says and they of the
[1:27:04] circumcision which believed were
[1:27:05] astonished as many as came with Peter
[1:27:07] because that on the Gentiles also was
[1:27:09] poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:11] for they heard them speak with tongues
[1:27:13] and magnify God then answered Peter can
[1:27:16] any man forbid water that these should
[1:27:18] not be baptized which have received the
[1:27:20] Holy Ghost as well as we and he
[1:27:22] commanded them to be baptized in the
[1:27:23] name of the Lord then prayed they him to
[1:27:26] T certain days now watch how the prophet
[1:27:28] of God lays us out it's such a beautiful
[1:27:29] picture here he says Cornelius he was a
[1:27:32] great man an honorable man he built
[1:27:34] churches he respected the Jews because
[1:27:36] he knew their religion was right he paid
[1:27:39] alms he prayed every day but when the
[1:27:41] Holy Ghost came now watch what he puts
[1:27:43] here he says something had been added to
[1:27:45] the church he needed a guide God sent
[1:27:48] him the Holy Ghost he sent it in the
[1:27:52] person of Peter
[1:27:55] see church sometimes we're Hing we're
[1:27:57] asking God to come down and know what
[1:27:59] God's trying to do is send him the Holy
[1:28:01] Ghost in
[1:28:02] person a portion but while we gets a
[1:28:05] portion anyways watch how he lays this
[1:28:07] out he says he sent it in the person of
[1:28:10] Peter for while Peter yet spake these
[1:28:11] words the Holy Ghost fell on them God
[1:28:14] used the guide through Peter he used it
[1:28:17] because he guided Cornelius to the right
[1:28:20] way remember Peter didn't go of his own
[1:28:22] of his own desire but he went by the
[1:28:24] leading of the spirit amen when we do
[1:28:27] what the spirit tells us that's when
[1:28:28] it's effective not when I come up with
[1:28:31] an idea of program a a missions program
[1:28:33] or Outreach but when God would show me
[1:28:35] what to do as he did Peter that's when
[1:28:37] it's effective it says and while he was
[1:28:40] yet speaking the Holy Ghost fell on them
[1:28:42] Gentiles then he said can a man forbid
[1:28:45] water that these should not be baptized
[1:28:47] see it's still the God speaking not
[1:28:50] Peter because that was a bunch of
[1:28:52] Gentiles unclean dirty to him and he
[1:28:55] didn't even want to go but the guide
[1:28:57] said I'm sending you you do things you
[1:29:00] don't think you would do when the guide
[1:29:02] gets complete control when you let him
[1:29:05] guide you see everybody's got to grow
[1:29:08] under the anointing of the Holy
[1:29:10] Spirit he says oh how wonderful it is to
[1:29:12] be led by the Holy Spirit he is the
[1:29:15] guide he spoke through Peter and told
[1:29:18] him what he must do then when they all
[1:29:21] received the Holy Ghost he said we can't
[1:29:22] forbid water seeing these have received
[1:29:24] CE the Holy Ghost like we did at the
[1:29:25] beginning and they baptized them in the
[1:29:27] name of the Lord Jesus now who led him
[1:29:30] to do that he says the guide that was in
[1:29:32] him didn't Jesus tell them take no
[1:29:34] thought what you're going to say because
[1:29:36] it's not you that's speaking it's the
[1:29:39] father that dwelleth in you he doeth the
[1:29:42] speaking when you're LED
[1:29:45] go when you're asked to talk talk when
[1:29:48] you asked to be quiet be quiet too amen
[1:29:51] we've got to be sensitive to those
[1:29:52] things brother BR would continue in
[1:29:54] another message he says that's the
[1:29:55] Apostolic Church moving in the spirit
[1:29:58] wherever God said Peter went down to
[1:30:01] follow the lord he says and if a man if
[1:30:04] God could ever get a man and woman today
[1:30:07] in this Tabernacle anywhere else that'll
[1:30:10] pay no attention to what's going on
[1:30:12] around them but submit themselves to the
[1:30:15] Lord as an individual unit he says God
[1:30:20] will lead the same man today that he led
[1:30:23] then
[1:30:24] as an individual unit now God's not the
[1:30:27] author of chaos and he's not the author
[1:30:30] of division so he's not going to lead
[1:30:32] two people to get into a headbutting
[1:30:35] contest but if God leads you to do
[1:30:37] something you do it
[1:30:40] amen I'm not here to lead you I'm here
[1:30:42] to point you to the word so the Holy
[1:30:44] Spirit can lead you he says he proves
[1:30:47] that he's with us watch this what we
[1:30:50] need today is a humble submitted life
[1:30:55] submit yourself don't squeeze yourself
[1:30:58] back don't do nothing but lead straight
[1:31:01] with the Holy Spirit and what the spirit
[1:31:03] says do do quickly don't say well I'll
[1:31:06] wait and find out what this is and that
[1:31:08] is he says what the holy spirit says do
[1:31:11] go do it why because souls are relying
[1:31:13] on our obedience God's trying to use us
[1:31:16] for a purpose amen we need to be quick
[1:31:18] to hear and quick to obey and one
[1:31:21] thing's for sure you got to know your
[1:31:22] Bible to know who's talking to you
[1:31:24] too many people are being led by the
[1:31:26] spirit and they're contrary to the word
[1:31:27] and it's not the spirit leading them but
[1:31:29] it feels real good and it usually
[1:31:31] benefits them rather than others he says
[1:31:34] obedience is better than sacrifice do
[1:31:37] what the holy spirit says do he says
[1:31:40] what we need tonight is to let loose of
[1:31:42] all our little squeezy ideas and let the
[1:31:45] Holy Spirit lead he says you're taught
[1:31:47] here you know what's right and wrong but
[1:31:49] what you need tonight is a great big
[1:31:51] bundle full of the love of God poured
[1:31:55] out in your heart and all differences
[1:31:57] washed away he says bury it with the old
[1:32:00] year as it passes out let it go let's
[1:32:02] start a new life A New Beginning he says
[1:32:05] if you're already born in the kingdom of
[1:32:07] God you've already got the holy spirit
[1:32:09] in you the only thing you have to do see
[1:32:12] this isn't the end you get the Holy
[1:32:13] Spirit that's the start church that's
[1:32:15] the real start he says the only thing
[1:32:18] you have to do is cut loose from those
[1:32:19] things of the world that's holding you
[1:32:21] down he said let us lay aside every wait
[1:32:24] and the sin that does so easily beset us
[1:32:26] that we might run with patience the life
[1:32:29] the race that set before us he said lay
[1:32:31] aside the race lay aside the weights so
[1:32:35] we see here that the spirit can come to
[1:32:38] a person at any time it can happen after
[1:32:42] repentance and baptism it can happen
[1:32:45] before water baptism it can happen
[1:32:48] without a person realizing
[1:32:50] it now you say how is that possible
[1:32:53] Brother John it can happen and you'll
[1:32:55] know something's changed but you won't
[1:32:57] realize what's actually happened
[1:32:59] absolutely absolutely you can have a
[1:33:02] changed life you can have a changed mind
[1:33:04] you can have changed desires you can
[1:33:06] literally become subject to the word and
[1:33:08] not realize that it's the baptism of the
[1:33:09] holy spirit that did it why because you
[1:33:11] haven't been taught you don't know
[1:33:12] what's going on all you know is I'm not
[1:33:14] the way I used to be but you still got
[1:33:17] it you still got it we're going to talk
[1:33:18] about this in a little bit but this is
[1:33:20] the sovereignty of God and I think he
[1:33:22] did it for people just like me cuz us
[1:33:25] Germans we like a law and we like a
[1:33:28] formula and we like it to be done the
[1:33:29] same way every time and you know what
[1:33:32] God says he says I'm going to do it my
[1:33:33] way I'm going to be Sovereign I'm going
[1:33:36] to be God I'm not going to raise my hand
[1:33:38] he says I'm going to be God and you can
[1:33:39] be you and he says I'll give it when I
[1:33:42] see it's the right time and it's up to
[1:33:45] him to see it because God's looking at
[1:33:47] the heart and that's one thing I can't
[1:33:49] see I can see what comes out of it and I
[1:33:52] can interpret that and I can put some
[1:33:54] discernment behind it but in the end I
[1:33:56] don't know what's in your heart God does
[1:33:58] and that's what happened amen that's
[1:34:00] what happened on the day of on this day
[1:34:02] at at Cornelius house is they're
[1:34:04] receiving the word and God says their
[1:34:07] heart's right their heart is receiving
[1:34:10] it that's all I need to do and he drops
[1:34:12] down and he fills him with the spirit
[1:34:14] amen but there's one thing that I know
[1:34:16] it may not come the same way to every
[1:34:18] person it may not come in the same order
[1:34:20] of events but one thing's for sure it'll
[1:34:22] always come the same way and it'll have
[1:34:24] the same effect it'll come by the word
[1:34:27] the holy spirit always comes by the word
[1:34:30] and it'll change your life amen it'll
[1:34:33] have the same effect it'll produce the
[1:34:35] fruit of the spirit how does the Holy
[1:34:36] Spirit Come it comes with the word a
[1:34:39] portion and it sees what you'll do with
[1:34:41] it and if you'll accept that then it'll
[1:34:43] give you the next and the next and the
[1:34:46] next and he says they're receiving the
[1:34:48] word and what does he do it's an act of
[1:34:50] your faith and he comes behind and he
[1:34:52] seals it with the spirit it's his
[1:34:54] acceptance of Your Action it's his
[1:34:55] acceptance of your reaction to the word
[1:34:58] of God Amen you accept it you live it
[1:35:01] you rest on it you obey it and God comes
[1:35:03] behind it and he seals it with his
[1:35:04] Spirit watch what brother brandham says
[1:35:06] about this he says now while he yet
[1:35:08] spake these words the Holy Ghost fell
[1:35:11] then Peter said can we forbid water
[1:35:13] seeing that these received the Holy
[1:35:14] Ghost like we did he said I believe
[1:35:17] their sins were already gone for the
[1:35:20] Holy Spirit would have not come in and
[1:35:22] he would not have come in unless had
[1:35:24] been a predestinated vessel he knew that
[1:35:27] they would follow follow what the word
[1:35:31] baptism is just an outward expression of
[1:35:33] an inward event so God doesn't need us
[1:35:36] to be baptized with water what he needs
[1:35:38] is our life to die out and when that's
[1:35:41] died out then he can come in amen and he
[1:35:43] can forgive our sins what happens when
[1:35:45] we're baptized is what we've received
[1:35:47] the word we've subjected ourselves to it
[1:35:49] and in obedience we just go or baptized
[1:35:51] but really we've already been quickened
[1:35:53] our life has been changed hopefully by
[1:35:54] those things the heart has already been
[1:35:57] changed and you're agree in agreement
[1:35:58] with the word and you've been cleansed
[1:36:00] of your sins so God could come in and
[1:36:01] dwell in you they still had to be
[1:36:03] baptized properly brother Braham says
[1:36:05] why because the word requires it and the
[1:36:08] Order of events doesn't matter you'll
[1:36:09] still obey the word of God no matter
[1:36:11] what but they were saying ien to the
[1:36:13] word maybe not so much with their mouth
[1:36:15] but their hearts were saying it and as
[1:36:17] soon as that heart was cleansed God
[1:36:18] could come in and dwell in it brother
[1:36:19] brandom says their sins were gone that's
[1:36:21] why the spirit could come in why because
[1:36:24] they were children of God receiving the
[1:36:25] word of God that's all that was
[1:36:27] happening there amen they had walked as
[1:36:29] far as they could in the light of God
[1:36:31] and then God sent them further light and
[1:36:33] that further light was to receive his
[1:36:34] very life and as soon as they receiv
[1:36:36] received the word that said it was
[1:36:37] possible they receiv received the
[1:36:39] promise of it as well amen that's the
[1:36:43] word it came by way of man but what
[1:36:45] changed them was not Peter what changed
[1:36:46] them was the Holy Spirit through the
[1:36:48] word too often we're focused on this guy
[1:36:51] we're focused on men we're focused on
[1:36:53] Ministry amen listen what we bring may
[1:36:55] be lifechanging but we are not
[1:36:57] lifechanging we need our lives change we
[1:36:59] come we go we rise we fall and it's the
[1:37:02] only the holy spirit that can anoint us
[1:37:03] and if we can surrender to that
[1:37:05] anointing that's what makes us effective
[1:37:07] I've sat in services in this church in
[1:37:10] our old little church in brother Gerald
[1:37:13] in the in the small congregation and
[1:37:14] churches we've had there I've been in
[1:37:16] churches all around the globe and had
[1:37:17] the Holy Spirit pin me to my seat
[1:37:20] sometimes in good ways and sometimes in
[1:37:21] bad ways and guess what it was was not
[1:37:23] the man I knew it wasn't the man cuz the
[1:37:26] man didn't know but the Holy Spirit came
[1:37:29] through that word and changed my life in
[1:37:30] so many ways gave me direction gave me
[1:37:32] leadership gave me
[1:37:34] correction set me straight corrected my
[1:37:37] attitude whatever the need was there
[1:37:39] amen I'm not receiving the man I'm
[1:37:41] receiving the word coming through the
[1:37:42] man we've got to be able to separate
[1:37:44] those things I've seen what happens
[1:37:46] again even in this church when people
[1:37:48] take that that what's coming over the
[1:37:50] pulpit and they say well that's just the
[1:37:51] man he knows somebody told about me
[1:37:54] no no no ain't nobody talking it's the
[1:37:57] Holy Spirit and you got to receive it
[1:37:59] that way God helped me to keep myself
[1:38:01] out of those things amen but when the
[1:38:04] Holy Spirit comes to reject it you know
[1:38:06] what happens is you end up falling
[1:38:08] away if only in that little area of your
[1:38:11] life because you won't be corrected
[1:38:13] we've got to receive it as the Holy
[1:38:15] Spirit speaks amen like I said God
[1:38:17] helped me not to get involved in those
[1:38:19] things but BR says this he says come
[1:38:21] back to God and his Bible come back to
[1:38:25] the gospel truth let some organization
[1:38:28] wrap you away from the things of God he
[1:38:30] says don't you never do that you come to
[1:38:33] God back to God's simple way just fall
[1:38:36] on your knees and say Lord God I don't
[1:38:38] care what or how you give it to me but
[1:38:40] I'm here for it he says Watch What
[1:38:42] Happens and be sincere about it he's
[1:38:45] more anxious to give it to you than you
[1:38:46] are to receive it you don't have to T
[1:38:49] and T and T there's no such a thing he
[1:38:52] says while Peter yet spake these words
[1:38:54] the Holy Ghost fell on them that heard
[1:38:55] it right he says the trouble of it is we
[1:38:59] don't want it enough we don't want to
[1:39:02] Humble
[1:39:04] theirselves that's a hard thing to say
[1:39:07] we don't want to Humble
[1:39:09] ourselves I remember my own self before
[1:39:12] I gave my heart to the Lord The Humbling
[1:39:14] came from one I don't like to be
[1:39:16] corrected and listen you can't come to
[1:39:19] God unless you can be corrected that's
[1:39:20] what repentance is is accepting
[1:39:22] correction
[1:39:24] but two I didn't want to be responsible
[1:39:25] for what I had to
[1:39:27] know you don't because as soon as you
[1:39:30] know the truth and you say I'm going to
[1:39:31] commit my life to Christ now you're held
[1:39:33] accountable for it and guess what
[1:39:35] scripture says it's the sons that he
[1:39:38] chastises and if you've heard enough of
[1:39:40] brother Gerald's preaching you know that
[1:39:41] he preached chastisement plenty of times
[1:39:43] and so you knew what's coming if I don't
[1:39:45] live it then I'm going to get beat up
[1:39:47] I'm going to get a spank and I'm going
[1:39:48] to get a whip and I'm going to get put
[1:39:50] in my place and I didn't like to humble
[1:39:52] myself to that idea I wanted to do my
[1:39:55] thing but guess what like I said before
[1:39:57] I was miserable anyways might as well be
[1:40:00] miserable in the right way than in the
[1:40:01] wrong
[1:40:02] way it's not why I gave my heart to the
[1:40:05] Lord but listen Satan will run circles
[1:40:07] around us with his logic that's for
[1:40:09] sure he says we don't want to Humble
[1:40:11] ourselves I want to close with this one
[1:40:13] story I know many of you have heard it I
[1:40:15] don't think maybe the young people have
[1:40:17] and I've taken this and if you'll
[1:40:18] forgive me I've combined some of the
[1:40:20] it's all from the same same message and
[1:40:22] same quotes but I've kind of cleaned it
[1:40:24] up a bit to make it easier to read and
[1:40:25] to shorten it cuz it is a little bit of
[1:40:27] time but we'll close on this thought but
[1:40:30] brother Adam's talking about this man
[1:40:32] that spent years trying to get
[1:40:35] saved and he kept trying and he kept
[1:40:37] trying and what do we mean by get saved
[1:40:40] receive the Holy Spirit the world will
[1:40:42] talk about salvation all these different
[1:40:43] things but when we talk about saved we
[1:40:45] mean receive eternal life receive the
[1:40:47] holy spirit amen so this man had a wife
[1:40:49] that went down to a Pentecostal meeting
[1:40:51] and she received the Holy Spirit and in
[1:40:53] a meeting there and he was trying to get
[1:40:55] the Holy Spirit as well and he just
[1:40:57] couldn't seem to do it he said no matter
[1:40:58] where he went or what he listened to and
[1:41:00] so he came to brother Bram for help
[1:41:01] figuring that brother Bram could sort it
[1:41:03] out he says people say you're a prophet
[1:41:04] maybe you can help me so listen to this
[1:41:07] he says look I went to all of Billy I
[1:41:09] went to Billy graes meetings a great
[1:41:11] famous preacher brother Bram says he's a
[1:41:13] wonderful man of God doing a great work
[1:41:15] for God and he said I went to his
[1:41:17] meetings and he told all that wants to
[1:41:19] be saved raise up your hands I raised my
[1:41:21] hand up and went into an inquiry room
[1:41:23] then they told me back there I had to
[1:41:25] accept Jesus I got down and prayed he
[1:41:27] told me now do you believe in Jesus
[1:41:29] Christ they said yes I accept him as
[1:41:31] personal savior he said now you're
[1:41:33] saved and he said nothing happened to
[1:41:39] me young people how many times you've
[1:41:42] gone to
[1:41:43] camp and somebody said do this and do
[1:41:46] that and do this and do that you'll know
[1:41:48] when you're changed you'll know when
[1:41:50] you're changed you won't have to take
[1:41:52] somebody word for it he knew he hadn't
[1:41:56] changed he knew he hadn't changed he
[1:41:58] said nothing happened to me he said I
[1:42:00] went them for a couple of years and I
[1:42:03] found the Free Methodist people who said
[1:42:05] I had to get happy enough to shout they
[1:42:08] prayed over me and everything till I got
[1:42:09] happy enough to shout they said now you
[1:42:11] got it you got sanctification I went out
[1:42:14] and said I was searching for all I could
[1:42:16] I still didn't have it see you got to be
[1:42:18] convinced in your own
[1:42:19] self ain't nobody going to going to
[1:42:22] going to resolve your questions it's got
[1:42:24] to be a a personal revelation to you he
[1:42:27] said then I went to Brother o Robert's
[1:42:29] meetings Church he's going to all the
[1:42:30] great Ministries he's going to all the
[1:42:33] great churches he's going to the ones
[1:42:35] that have the most signs and wonder he's
[1:42:36] going all over the place he's going
[1:42:38] anywhere he thinks there's a hope or a
[1:42:41] chance don't think people aren't doing
[1:42:43] it today within this message I'm going
[1:42:45] to go to this brother's church because
[1:42:46] they get results I'm going to go to
[1:42:48] church listen you got to accept the word
[1:42:50] you've been
[1:42:51] given God will do the work the man's not
[1:42:54] going to do the work you got to you got
[1:42:55] to let the word do the work he said I
[1:42:57] went to Brother o Robert's meetings they
[1:42:59] went into the room and told me I had to
[1:43:00] receive the Holy Ghost and I had to
[1:43:02] speak with tongues or I didn't have it
[1:43:04] he says I went back and there and they
[1:43:05] prayed over me and told me to talk to
[1:43:06] the Lord I spoke with
[1:43:08] tongues he said I still ain't got it he
[1:43:11] said and I don't know what to do Church
[1:43:14] Revival after Revival camp meeting after
[1:43:17] camp meeting church after church
[1:43:19] ministry after Ministry and he says I
[1:43:21] still ain't got what I'm looking for
[1:43:24] the frustration sometimes that people go
[1:43:27] through and sometimes it's our fault
[1:43:29] that we put our kids through this I'll
[1:43:30] speak to that specifically we put them
[1:43:33] through it and we put them through it
[1:43:34] and we put them through it church let
[1:43:35] God do the work let him speak listen
[1:43:38] we've had people receive the Holy Ghost
[1:43:40] here and we've had people go away and
[1:43:41] receive the Holy Ghost we've had people
[1:43:43] that had to leave to get the Holy Ghost
[1:43:44] there we've had people that had to stay
[1:43:46] to get the Holy Ghost listen God will
[1:43:48] work through an anointed
[1:43:51] man doesn't matter what people think
[1:43:53] about the man if God has chosen him and
[1:43:55] God has placed him God will use him and
[1:43:57] God will bring what's needed in the
[1:43:59] church now listen to what brother
[1:44:01] brandham says he says my brother the
[1:44:03] only thing is you're just confused said
[1:44:06] I want to ask you something did you
[1:44:08] always love the Lord Jesus he said well
[1:44:11] I belong to the Presbyterian church but
[1:44:13] I just went there and Bam said well I
[1:44:16] want to ask you what happened and what
[1:44:18] took place that you changed your mind
[1:44:21] all at once what's better abam saying
[1:44:23] he's saying what's driving this in the
[1:44:25] first place why do you keep trying to
[1:44:27] get saved why do you keep going to
[1:44:29] church why do you keep going to camp
[1:44:31] meetings why do you keep trying all
[1:44:32] these different things under different
[1:44:35] Ministries and he said well my wife she
[1:44:38] went down to the Pentecostals and she
[1:44:40] got the spirit and so then she came back
[1:44:42] up and she was happy brother Braham said
[1:44:45] well what do you think about that did
[1:44:46] you criticize it he said no he said I
[1:44:47] just thought well I'll see how it lasts
[1:44:50] and it went on she seemed to have it he
[1:44:52] said one day I was coming coming in from
[1:44:53] making a sale out in the yard and I
[1:44:56] happened to reach in my pocket and
[1:44:57] somebody had given me a little old tract
[1:45:00] I sat down in the office and began to
[1:45:02] read this tract and the awfulest feeling
[1:45:04] came over me does anybody remember that
[1:45:06] awfulest
[1:45:08] feeling you'll never forget it it's
[1:45:10] called conviction and it is absolutely
[1:45:14] awful but it's awful with a
[1:45:17] purpose as opposed to
[1:45:19] condemnation he says the awfulest
[1:45:21] feeling came over me that I ought to get
[1:45:23] right with God he said I've been
[1:45:24] searching ever
[1:45:26] since brother BR says I I want to ask
[1:45:29] you something he said when this feeling
[1:45:31] come over you you've never been able to
[1:45:33] get out of it he said no sir I haven't
[1:45:35] he said I said well that's when you
[1:45:37] receiv received Christ I said it doesn't
[1:45:39] mean raising up your hands that's all
[1:45:41] right speaking in tongues that's all
[1:45:43] right shouting that's all right he says
[1:45:44] but that's the attribute of Christ after
[1:45:47] he comes in I said to receive Christ is
[1:45:51] to receive the person in Christ Jesus to
[1:45:54] receive him as life shouting speaking in
[1:45:57] tongues and all demonstrations those are
[1:45:59] all attributes that follow this he says
[1:46:01] but first is to receive
[1:46:04] Christ he's trying to let the brother
[1:46:06] see what was going on in the whole time
[1:46:09] he says then he said then brother Bram
[1:46:11] I've been saved all this
[1:46:13] time I said sure look do you love him he
[1:46:17] said with all my heart he said one time
[1:46:19] you didn't love him he said that's right
[1:46:22] and now you love him he said well that's
[1:46:23] the truth I said well you had him all
[1:46:26] the time and he jumped off the porch and
[1:46:29] began crying and holding me in his arms
[1:46:31] and he said oh god I've been a Christian
[1:46:33] all these years what's he been doing all
[1:46:36] along Church he's been seeking to get
[1:46:38] right with God he's been obeying the
[1:46:42] word as it came to him he's been doing
[1:46:45] what the people told him to do amen but
[1:46:47] what happened is he he received the word
[1:46:50] from that little tract and when he
[1:46:53] received that word he was quick to
[1:46:56] life amen he was living a life that
[1:46:59] loved Christ he was living a Sanctified
[1:47:02] life he was living a clean life he was
[1:47:04] going to church he was doing everything
[1:47:06] a Christian does and seeking to be a
[1:47:08] Christian and didn't know what had
[1:47:10] already happened that's why I said you
[1:47:12] can get it without realizing what's
[1:47:15] happened doesn't mean it didn't
[1:47:19] happen but he had he had no clue that
[1:47:21] what had gone on in his life
[1:47:23] watch what brother BR says he says well
[1:47:25] his thoughts changed something did it
[1:47:27] for him Hallelujah as a man thinketh in
[1:47:29] his heart see Christ the Creator came to
[1:47:32] him in a still form and created his own
[1:47:36] Spirit took the man's nature away to
[1:47:37] love dancing and the world and carrying
[1:47:39] on and from that time he just laid it
[1:47:42] aside and was hungering for after God
[1:47:45] and God was in him all the time he says
[1:47:47] it was God in the beginning it was God
[1:47:51] all along that was drawing him to to
[1:47:53] this and he had no clue what was going
[1:47:55] on and he was under conviction why cuz
[1:47:57] he didn't meet somebody else's
[1:47:59] experience somebody else's
[1:48:02] requirement he said as a man thinketh it
[1:48:05] has to become a thought before it be can
[1:48:07] become a word and a word expressed
[1:48:09] materializes I believe in my heart that
[1:48:11] I'm a Christian because I have accepted
[1:48:14] the Lord Jesus Christ if I don't cry if
[1:48:16] I don't move if I don't do a
[1:48:20] thing don't build up
[1:48:23] what your experience with Christ is
[1:48:24] going to be don't decide what it's going
[1:48:27] to be before it's there let him do it he
[1:48:31] says in my heart first I believe that
[1:48:33] Christ died for me in my stad amen I
[1:48:35] accept it as a Christian I believe it as
[1:48:37] a Christian then it's in my heart then I
[1:48:40] express it in a word I am a Christian
[1:48:43] Hallelujah he says then I start walking
[1:48:45] as a Christian talking as a Christian
[1:48:48] Living as a Christian being as a
[1:48:50] Christian and by my fruits I'm
[1:48:52] recognized ized by the World As a
[1:48:55] Christian see we're not here to seek an
[1:48:58] experience by somebody else's standards
[1:49:02] amen somebody else's
[1:49:05] expectations the way it worked for
[1:49:06] somebody else is not the way it might
[1:49:08] work for us we can't go around that poor
[1:49:11] man was chasing for years something he
[1:49:13] already had why because he was listening
[1:49:15] to other people and looking at the boxes
[1:49:17] they had created rather than looking at
[1:49:20] what the word said about him people were
[1:49:22] trying to fit his experience with God
[1:49:24] into their box and because it didn't fit
[1:49:26] it said you must fit it into our box or
[1:49:27] you don't have it they drove him crazy
[1:49:30] the New Birth the the receiving of the
[1:49:32] holy spirit is not defined by my
[1:49:35] experience or yours it's defined by the
[1:49:37] word that's it and it's the results
[1:49:40] we're looking for not the events that
[1:49:43] lead up to it he can come any way he
[1:49:46] wants he can come through anybody he
[1:49:49] wants you can be walking down the street
[1:49:52] meditating on something you heard in
[1:49:54] church and God can give you the Holy
[1:49:55] Spirit or you can be in church and you
[1:49:58] can you can respond to a to the to the
[1:50:01] calling of God and come up and yes go to
[1:50:04] the Altar and and give your heart to God
[1:50:05] and God can fill you with his Spirit it
[1:50:08] could be after you're baptized it can be
[1:50:10] before it can be as a 9-year-old and it
[1:50:12] could be as a 90-year old brother B
[1:50:14] talks about that old lady sorry he saw
[1:50:17] he was beyond the curtain of time
[1:50:18] remember and this young woman came up to
[1:50:20] him and she said oh brother brandom she
[1:50:22] says don't you recognize me and he says
[1:50:24] no and she said you prayed for me and I
[1:50:26] and uh I received the Lord and she was
[1:50:28] over 90 years
[1:50:30] old listen don't put a timeline on it
[1:50:34] but brother Bram says listen tell them
[1:50:36] you want it just tell them you want it
[1:50:39] however it comes whenever it comes by
[1:50:42] whichever Ministry which by ever word by
[1:50:44] whichever service by whatever moment
[1:50:46] whatever it is let him know you want it
[1:50:48] and then he said stay there and say I'm
[1:50:50] not leaving until I get it
[1:50:53] yes we got to go to work yes we got to
[1:50:54] go go to school yes we've got to live
[1:50:57] this life and these things but don't
[1:50:58] leave the promise until he gives it to
[1:51:00] you
[1:51:03] amen you know we talk about sending our
[1:51:05] kids away and hoping they'll have an
[1:51:09] experience too often what we get are a
[1:51:11] camp experience not a Christ
[1:51:14] experience why because emotions are
[1:51:16] running High hey the holy spirit's there
[1:51:18] I'm not saying it's not but under that
[1:51:20] atmosphere lots of things happen
[1:51:23] but that doesn't mean you've met Christ
[1:51:26] you've been in his presence you've seen
[1:51:28] what the Holy Spirit can do but it's the
[1:51:30] changeed life we're looking for because
[1:51:33] otherwise what are we doing we're
[1:51:34] running them from Camp to Camp from
[1:51:36] revival to Revival and unless the
[1:51:38] service goes a certain way unless the
[1:51:39] worships a certain way unless the
[1:51:41] preachers a certain way then what do
[1:51:43] they do they lose their experience
[1:51:45] because their experience was bound in
[1:51:46] the box of camp it was bound in the box
[1:51:48] of so- and so's church it was bound in
[1:51:50] the box of what so and so told them no
[1:51:52] take it back back to the word and say
[1:51:53] Lord I want an experience that matches
[1:51:55] your word Above All Else amen amen let's
[1:51:58] stand if we
[1:52:00] would listen a lot of people today are
[1:52:03] seeking an experience of their own
[1:52:05] definition God took Peter's definition
[1:52:07] and he kicked it out the door he said
[1:52:10] Peter I'm going to grow you and then I'm
[1:52:11] going to go bring some other people to
[1:52:13] life once you can get out of this little
[1:52:14] rut you're in once you can get out of
[1:52:16] this old way and this old tradition of
[1:52:18] doing things amen sent him to
[1:52:20] Cornelius the Holy Spirit fell even
[1:52:22] while he spoke sent him to Samaria to
[1:52:25] the people that were half in and half
[1:52:27] out that didn't know how to worship God
[1:52:29] and gave them the Holy Spirit then he
[1:52:31] takes Paul and he turns him to the
[1:52:32] entire Gentile world and he brings out a
[1:52:35] people that he would call beloved that
[1:52:37] had never been called beloved before
[1:52:40] amen we need to see it's God who decides
[1:52:43] it's not me it's not you it's God that's
[1:52:46] got to put the call in their life and
[1:52:48] he's got to come to them personally and
[1:52:49] individually amen I don't want a camp
[1:52:53] experience I don't want my kids to have
[1:52:54] a camp experience I want them to have a
[1:52:56] living personal relationship with Jesus
[1:52:59] Christ you know what we need to do
[1:53:01] Church fall in love with
[1:53:03] Jesus fall in love with
[1:53:06] Jesus you fall in love with him
[1:53:09] everything else will go into its perfect
[1:53:12] place because we're going to have ups
[1:53:13] and downs in life we're going to have
[1:53:14] ups and downs in church we going to have
[1:53:16] ups and downs in our marriages and our
[1:53:18] jobs and school and all these things but
[1:53:20] he's the one thing that never changes
[1:53:23] and when you you are satisfied that
[1:53:24] you've met him and that he's met you
[1:53:28] that he's come in and live with you
[1:53:29] remember the scripture says they came to
[1:53:32] they'll come to at the end of the day
[1:53:33] and they'll say well we did this and we
[1:53:35] did that and he says I never knew you
[1:53:37] listen I've met a lot of famous people
[1:53:39] but they don't know me I know them but
[1:53:41] they don't know me the new birth is when
[1:53:43] he comes down and says I know you I know
[1:53:46] who you are cuz you're my child your
[1:53:49] name's written it's not just written on
[1:53:50] the Lamb's Book of Life it's written in
[1:53:52] the p Palms in my hands and I can't lose
[1:53:54] a one of you and I'm here to let you
[1:53:56] know you're a child of God Amen that's
[1:53:58] what'll settle us I have never forgotten
[1:54:01] when God called me his child and he made
[1:54:04] it abundantly clear he was talking to me
[1:54:06] I'll never forget it nobody could ever
[1:54:08] take it away I said this before I talked
[1:54:10] to brother Barry coffee after those
[1:54:11] meetings were over and I told him what
[1:54:13] he said and he looked at me and he's
[1:54:14] like I don't remember ever saying that
[1:54:17] had nothing to do with what he was
[1:54:18] talking about but the voice that I heard
[1:54:20] was very specific to me and called me
[1:54:22] out Donnie Reagan the same thing what
[1:54:26] it's not Donnie Reagan it's not Barry
[1:54:27] coffee it's not Jonathan klette it's got
[1:54:30] to be the Holy Spirit wooing calling
[1:54:33] amen and he made it personal to me that
[1:54:35] I am a child of God that's why I stand
[1:54:37] here today that's why I come to church
[1:54:39] that's why I believe what I do is
[1:54:41] because he called my name personally and
[1:54:43] nobody can ever change that amen that's
[1:54:46] what we need God bless you let's bow our
[1:54:49] heads Heavenly Father
[1:54:54] Lord how we need your presence in our
[1:55:01] lives Lord how we need a personal
[1:55:04] touch Lord not a church
[1:55:07] experience not a Wednesday night or a
[1:55:09] Sunday Morning Experience

[1:55:16] us that assures us Lord

[1:55:44] one Lord I pray that you would reach
[1:55:49] down Lord that they would feel the call
[1:55:51] of your spirit Lord Lord
[1:55:53] Jesus that they recognize this isn't a
[1:55:55] game it's not a
[1:55:57] religion lord it's not just a church
[1:55:59] service Lord but it's the Holy Spirit
[1:56:02] calling them to
[1:56:04] you Lord I pray you put such a desire in
[1:56:06] their hearts Lord that it would burn
[1:56:09] within
[1:56:10] them Lord that awfulest feeling of how
[1:56:14] much they need you Lord and that they'd
[1:56:16] seek you and theyd do all that they can
[1:56:19] according to your word Lord to set Lord
[1:56:21] their life in a condition to receive you
