[41:37] in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen
[41:40] amen God bless you this morning amen
[41:43] good to be in the house of the Lord
[41:44] let's turn if we would to Psalms 51.
[41:48] Psalms 51 certainly enjoyed that song
[41:51] service this morning and
[41:53] it's uh
[41:55] it's a big thing I miss is not being
[41:56] able to to worship with the people and
[41:58] when he started singing our God is
[42:00] tremendous I just wanted to come back in
[42:02] here and just just start worshiping but
[42:04] I see that you guys carried the day in
[42:07] here amen so God bless you God bless
[42:08] brother Josh for for just yielding
[42:11] himself and these things I mean Blanca
[42:14] and Jensen are homesick this morning
[42:15] want to remember them in prayer of
[42:17] course we've got Camp coming up this
[42:18] weekend so no service on Wednesday but
[42:21] Friday night at the camp brother Andrew
[42:23] Glover will be here so remember him in
[42:25] prayer he's supposed to arrive Friday
[42:26] morning so we just trust the Lord will
[42:29] get him here because if he doesn't get
[42:31] here then we're not going to have a
[42:32] service that evening probably so let's
[42:34] just pray that God gets him here on time
[42:36] and without issue certainly remember the
[42:38] camp each one and brother Paul and
[42:40] Sister Kim are running the camp and they
[42:42] have my full support they've run the
[42:43] major decisions through me so please
[42:45] follow their instructions their requests
[42:48] whatever it is they ask of you they have
[42:49] my full support they're speaking for me
[42:51] in that situation so so please work with
[42:54] them they've got a lot of work they're
[42:55] doing and with a young baby and these
[42:57] things they don't need any hassle from
[42:58] anyone so let's just put our shoulder to
[43:00] the wheel let's do what we can amen it's
[43:02] a group effort they can't do it all
[43:03] themselves and so we want everyone to
[43:06] just get in there and do what they can
[43:07] and I was so pleased to just see out
[43:09] there as soon as they put the board up
[43:10] for for help everybody put their put
[43:12] their names on the list and there was no
[43:13] holding back or you know let's see if
[43:15] everybody no no everybody jumped in and
[43:17] that's what we want to see and that's
[43:18] what that's what makes a camp is when
[43:20] everybody's pulling their load and we're
[43:22] not just leaving it to the two or three
[43:23] that that have a burden so God bless you
[43:26] for that let's let's keep it on our
[43:27] hearts amen let's be an expectation not
[43:29] just for the young people but for each
[43:31] and every one of us that's going to go
[43:32] away men that God will just bless us and
[43:34] speak to us through brother Andrew
[43:35] Glover as he as he comes to minister
[43:37] amen Psalms 51 and verse 6 this is David
[43:41] speaking this is this is David's
[43:44] prayer David's conversation with god
[43:47] after the Bathsheba incident he said
[43:49] behold thou desirest truth in the inward
[43:52] parts and in the hidden part Thou shalt
[43:55] make me to know wisdom Purge me with
[43:57] hyssop and I shall be clean wash me and
[44:01] I shall be whiter than snow make me to
[44:04] hear joy and gladness that the bones
[44:06] which thou has broken May rejoice
[44:09] hide thy face from my sins and blot out
[44:12] all my iniquities creating me a clean
[44:15] heart o God and renew a right Spirit
[44:17] Within Me cast me not away from thy
[44:20] presence and take not thy Holy Spirit
[44:22] from me restore unto me the joy of thy
[44:26] salvation and uphold me with thy free
[44:29] spirit amen God bless you you can have
[44:31] your seats this morning and we're taking
[44:33] a third service on on this thought of
[44:35] the order of life and we're still
[44:37] speaking on manifesting time of course
[44:39] and I just want to spend a service on on
[44:42] a new heart and a new spirit before we
[44:44] move into what it means to have the
[44:46] infilling of the Holy Spirit and and the
[44:48] fullness of the new birth of the
[44:49] finality of the new birth and I want you
[44:51] to see this morning what's possible with
[44:53] the new heart and a new spirit both the
[44:54] good and the bad
[44:56] because it's not all good and it's not
[44:59] all bad and it's going to depend on on
[45:01] really what's what's in there and what
[45:02] you'll surrender yourself to but what I
[45:04] also want us to see is what happens when
[45:06] we overstep what's in our heart and we
[45:08] go further than what God has actually
[45:10] placed in there and the and the dangers
[45:12] that happen from there when we get
[45:13] outside of our position or our Authority
[45:15] or the responsibility that he's he's
[45:17] given us in this life and I want to
[45:19] start with a scripture then go to a
[45:20] quote that I read last service but and
[45:23] the scripture would say this this is
[45:24] Solomon he says for as he thinketh in
[45:26] his heart
[45:27] so is he and he's speaking of a man he
[45:29] says as a man thinks in his heart that's
[45:31] exactly what he is and then I read the
[45:33] the there's a couple quotes I'm going to
[45:35] just re review here from last service to
[45:37] set a tone this morning and brother
[45:39] Brandon would say this he says so God
[45:40] had to give you a new heart not a
[45:43] patched up one
[45:45] he says a new heart that's your
[45:47] intellect that you think with a new way
[45:50] of thinking so a new heart is a new way
[45:52] of thinking it's a new approach then
[45:54] when he gave you a new way of thinking
[45:56] you say yes that's right the Bible looks
[45:58] to be reasonable I didn't use I used to
[46:00] didn't believe that I believe it now now
[46:03] there is your great Revival see they say
[46:06] yeah sure I don't want to go to hell I
[46:08] want to accept Christ that's all right
[46:10] that's good he says that's just your
[46:12] first step he's saying that's your great
[46:14] Revival that was that's what was going
[46:16] on in the churches that time and we'll
[46:18] see as we get into the statue of a
[46:19] perfect man much later that he'd say
[46:21] that you think that's the new birth
[46:24] that's your great Revival as you get
[46:26] this new heart or you get this new
[46:28] spirit and that's your Revival because
[46:30] you know something's changed but he says
[46:31] no no that's just one of the first steps
[46:34] it's a great thing don't don't not have
[46:37] a Revival because the process isn't done
[46:39] but don't think that that's the end of
[46:41] it all and then he would say this he
[46:43] says
[46:43] now the heart is the center of the
[46:46] emotions of the human being your heart
[46:49] is the middle of you that's exactly
[46:50] right so God puts a new heart in the
[46:52] middle of the old man then he puts a new
[46:54] spirit in the middle of the new heart
[46:56] and then he puts his spirit in the
[46:58] middle of the new spirit now I want you
[47:00] to catch the title here he says this
[47:02] this this message is called why some
[47:04] people can't keep the victory
[47:07] and he's talking about a Revival earlier
[47:09] and you have this great Revival but he
[47:11] says you've got to go all the way Beyond
[47:13] just the new heart you've got to get a
[47:14] new spirit inside of that new heart and
[47:16] then he has to put his holy spirit
[47:18] inside of this he's saying this is the
[47:20] heart is the center of your emotions
[47:21] it's how you think it's how you believe
[47:23] and God has to give you a new one
[47:25] because the nature the natural heart the
[47:27] human heart the Natural Instincts that
[47:29] you have they're no good he can't patch
[47:32] it up he's got to give you a new one and
[47:34] all you have to do is look around this
[47:36] world and see where people are following
[47:37] their heart and you'll see that you
[47:39] can't patch that up you've got to give
[47:41] them a new one amen but he says when he
[47:43] gives you this new heart now you can
[47:45] hear the word of God and you can connect
[47:47] with it you can believe it you can
[47:49] accept it you can say it's reasonable
[47:50] you can now start to be fed by the word
[47:53] of God it can start to have an impact on
[47:54] your life
[47:55] then he says you get a new spirit I read
[47:57] this last service you get a new spirit
[48:00] you quit you're drinking you get a new
[48:03] spirit you quit you're lying
[48:05] so now the new heart says I'll listen to
[48:08] the word the new spirit makes you stop
[48:10] doing certain things and it makes you
[48:11] start doing things as well and then he
[48:13] says you can do most anything with that
[48:16] Spirit but that isn't what God's talking
[48:19] about a new spirit he says I'll give you
[48:22] now watch I'll give you a new heart and
[48:24] a new spirit why he'd have to give you a
[48:26] new spirit to live for him while you
[48:28] couldn't even live with yourself with
[48:29] the spirit you did have you couldn't
[48:31] live with your neighbor you couldn't
[48:32] associate with the next man on the next
[48:34] corner you couldn't associate with these
[48:36] Christians why you'd have had an awful
[48:38] spirit so he has to give you a new
[48:41] spirit I'll give you a new heart and a
[48:43] new spirit now watch he says and I will
[48:45] put my spirit in you there's the
[48:47] difference I'll put my spirit in you
[48:51] notice he doesn't say that the new heart
[48:53] and the new spirit won't have an effect
[48:54] they absolutely have an effect but he
[48:57] says the Difference Maker is when his
[48:59] Spirit goes inside of those he's got to
[49:02] put that inside of us he puts a new
[49:04] spirit in you and that's your spirit
[49:05] that's my spirit it belongs to us it's
[49:08] ours it is not his it's from him but it
[49:11] belongs to us and it can be influenced
[49:13] and it can be controlled by anything
[49:17] it's meant to be controlled by the Holy
[49:19] Spirit brother Brown would talk about it
[49:21] that it has an inclination towards the
[49:23] word of God it has an inclination
[49:25] towards the things of God it's meant to
[49:27] be controlled by the Holy Spirit but yet
[49:30] because it's not the Holy Spirit you
[49:32] still have a choice
[49:33] you still get to decide what's going to
[49:35] influence you amen it's meant to be
[49:37] compatible with God
[49:39] that spirit in that new heart is meant
[49:41] to be compatible with God but what he's
[49:43] Desiring is for you to allow the Holy
[49:45] Spirit to sit in the control tower on
[49:48] the inside of the inside and that's
[49:50] what's ultimately going to make the
[49:51] difference because until that point you
[49:53] have a new spirit and it's allowing
[49:55] things in and out all day long
[49:57] because there's nobody seated with
[49:59] authority in the control tower of your
[50:02] heart you allow it you decide what
[50:04] Spirits are in there and what Spirits
[50:05] aren't in there it's all up to you amen
[50:07] but brother Brown would say with this
[50:08] new heart and this new spirit he would
[50:10] say it's the desire to do the right
[50:12] thing
[50:13] the desire to do it
[50:15] but he didn't say it's the power
[50:17] but he says it's the desire to do the
[50:19] right thing the holy spirit's going to
[50:21] be the power but the new heart and the
[50:22] new spirit that's the desire for these
[50:24] things and when I was reading these
[50:26] things it reminded me of that that
[50:27] message he preached on the wheel in the
[50:29] middle of the wheel and the where the
[50:30] the scripture where Ezekiel Saw God in
[50:32] the middle of the wheel and you look at
[50:34] that and he would say the outside is
[50:35] your heart
[50:37] and then inside that you have a spirit
[50:39] and that's the spokes of the wheel and
[50:41] then he says in the very middle is the
[50:43] Hub
[50:44] and that's the Holy Spirit and you'll
[50:46] notice that nothing can turn unless the
[50:48] Hub turns
[50:50] if the hub's not turning then the wheel
[50:52] is broken
[50:53] but if the Hub turns
[50:55] everything else turns the outside can't
[50:58] turn unless the inside's turning the
[50:59] spokes can't rotate unless the hub's
[51:01] turning him in what is it he says
[51:03] there's got to be something in control
[51:04] in the middle that drives your life that
[51:08] moves you that leads you and guides you
[51:10] that brings you to his purpose you're
[51:12] tied to the movement of the Holy Spirit
[51:14] the leadership of the Holy Spirit not to
[51:16] what you want you're not bound by
[51:18] conditions you're not bound by
[51:19] circumstances just because you're on a
[51:21] hill doesn't mean you have to roll
[51:23] The Hub determines what's going to
[51:25] happen and they would say this in the
[51:27] book of Acts they said for in him we
[51:29] live
[51:30] that means he's our source of life
[51:33] he says in him we move that means he's
[51:36] our leadership and guidance then it says
[51:38] and in him we have our being therefore
[51:40] he is our identity we are in him we are
[51:43] lost in him we are Christian we are Mrs
[51:45] Jesus Christ we are the word made flesh
[51:48] today
[51:49] amen our life our leadership and our
[51:52] identity are all inside of him brother
[51:54] Brian we'll put it this way he says
[51:55] Ezekiel said when I saw him he was a
[51:57] wheel in the middle of the wheel
[51:59] standing way in the middle of the air in
[52:01] other words the whole creation was
[52:03] resolved revolved around that Hub in the
[52:06] wheel every spoke every Rim everything
[52:10] else depended on the Hub in the wheel
[52:12] the wheel in the middle of the wheel in
[52:14] the middle of the air what's he saying
[52:16] everything is supposed to revolve around
[52:18] Christ in the center of our life
[52:20] we sing that song Jesus at the center of
[52:24] it all
[52:25] but is he
[52:27] is he
[52:30] he's saying he's supposed to be at the
[52:32] very center of it all we're supposed to
[52:34] be led by him we're not supposed to lead
[52:35] him we're supposed to be under his
[52:37] headship not our own we're supposed to
[52:38] be under his guidance we're supposed to
[52:40] move when he moves and we're supposed to
[52:42] stay still when he stays Stills and
[52:44] that's where we want to be found today
[52:45] that's where we want to be found today
[52:47] is where the holy spirit moves and then
[52:49] we follow after it but as we're looking
[52:51] at this order of life and how the new
[52:53] birth happens for a son or daughter of
[52:54] God I want to spend some time this
[52:56] morning on a new heart and a new spirit
[52:58] because remember this is where brother
[52:59] Braham says people get wrecked
[53:01] this is where people get held up this is
[53:03] where people fall by the roadside and
[53:05] what happens is they have something
[53:08] you have a new heart you have a new
[53:09] spirit it's something and it's from God
[53:11] and it's special and it's even
[53:12] Supernatural but what happens is they
[53:14] get to a place where what they have does
[53:17] not meet the need for their life
[53:19] and what happens is their testimony
[53:22] and what they have inside start to
[53:25] diverge because they don't have the
[53:27] strength inside they don't have the
[53:28] power inside they don't have something
[53:30] that holds them and their life is going
[53:31] one way and their testimony that they're
[53:33] saying goes another way because
[53:35] something hasn't been settled on the
[53:36] inside they don't have that Dynamic
[53:38] inside of them that's going to keep them
[53:40] all the way and then they realize I
[53:42] don't have what I what I thought I had
[53:43] and then what happens is they walk away
[53:47] if you don't have what you need that
[53:49] means there's something you can have
[53:51] that's the wonderful thing about is
[53:52] don't stop there and say well I don't
[53:54] have it and therefore I've just got to
[53:56] stop no say I'm going to press until I
[53:57] get what I need
[53:59] because if he's called me to the walk
[54:00] then he's got to provide the power to
[54:02] get me through to the end don't stop in
[54:04] that place amen but but don't leave God
[54:06] or or what happens oftentimes and I've
[54:08] seen this certainly recently is they
[54:10] make a big mistake
[54:12] and they say how can the Holy Spirit do
[54:14] that
[54:15] and it's a good question because the
[54:18] Holy Spirit wouldn't do that
[54:20] in simple fact except the Holy Spirit
[54:22] wouldn't do that brother Tim shared a
[54:24] quote with me where brother Brandon was
[54:25] was talking about you know his wife and
[54:27] and he said now if he says I believe if
[54:30] I cheated on my wife she'd forgive me
[54:33] but he said my comforter won't even let
[54:37] me do it
[54:38] brother Brown said I'm incapable of
[54:40] cheating on my wife because I've got
[54:42] something inside me that won't allow me
[54:44] to go there
[54:46] and what is it it's a sign to people I
[54:48] don't have what I needed to have
[54:51] we're not just talking backslidden we're
[54:53] talking doing things that the Holy
[54:54] Spirit absolutely forbids it cannot
[54:57] countenance those things and so what
[54:58] happens is it's a shock to them and they
[55:00] say well I don't have it and they walk
[55:01] away and sometimes this takes decades I
[55:03] know Believers that have walked away
[55:05] after 20 30 even 40 years and they get
[55:07] there and they don't read and then they
[55:09] realize I don't have the Holy Ghost and
[55:11] they leave rather than staying there and
[55:13] getting down on their knees and saying
[55:14] Lord I'm not moving until you give me
[55:16] what I have need of and then that's the
[55:18] determination of a believer in their
[55:20] heart is I'm going to get the Holy Ghost
[55:23] because that's the Difference Maker in
[55:24] all of these things right
[55:26] we're going to be preaching on the
[55:27] Statue of a perfect man and a little
[55:29] ways up the road but I want to borrow a
[55:31] quote from there just to set a bit of a
[55:33] stage this morning because we want to
[55:34] see how these things fit inside of a new
[55:36] heart and a new spirit
[55:37] brother Brown says this he says now I
[55:39] want to say this that there are some
[55:41] people he's preaching preaching from
[55:43] second Peter 1 the statue of a perfect
[55:44] man right add to your faith virtue
[55:46] virtue knowledge wisdom all these things
[55:48] he says I want to say this that there
[55:50] are some people who have a portion of
[55:53] this virtue knowledge wisdom patience
[55:57] and so forth that don't even profess to
[56:00] be a Christian
[56:02] he says and that's true there's some
[56:04] people have a portion of this that don't
[56:05] even pretend to be Christian but he says
[56:07] that won't do it
[56:10] notice he doesn't say they don't have it
[56:12] but he says what they have is not going
[56:15] to make them a Christian it's not going
[56:16] to get them across the Finish Line it's
[56:18] not going to get the maternal life it's
[56:19] not even going to give them the victory
[56:21] but yet he says they have a portion of
[56:24] what a Believer has
[56:26] he says it's like a black bird trying to
[56:29] put peacock feathers in his wings to
[56:31] make him a peacock he only disgraces
[56:33] himself be better to stay a blackbird
[56:35] see when he tries to exercise these
[56:38] things without being a Christian he's
[56:41] just simply out of place and we've
[56:43] absolutely met people I'm sure that each
[56:45] of you could go down in your mind right
[56:46] now and you can think of people you've
[56:48] met and when you first met them or you
[56:50] spent some time around them you look at
[56:52] their life and you say they have some
[56:54] character
[56:55] they have characteristics they have a
[56:57] morality they have a patience or a
[56:59] strength or a moderation they even have
[57:02] brotherly kindness
[57:03] there are people I know that you can do
[57:05] just about anything to them and they
[57:07] don't get offended
[57:09] they don't cut off the Friendship
[57:10] they'll keep coming back and they'll
[57:12] love you and they'll appreciate you
[57:14] and you say what do we say about people
[57:16] like that we say they're a good person
[57:20] they're good people and they are good
[57:22] but they're not godly good
[57:25] but they have some characteristics that
[57:27] we admire amen and we can't deny that
[57:30] they even have maybe an unusual amount
[57:34] maybe even more than we do at times it
[57:36] seems
[57:38] and brother Brandon would say they can
[57:40] have the virtues of second Peter 1 and
[57:43] not be a Christian
[57:44] but he says it's a portion
[57:46] it's not the full meal deal but it's a
[57:48] portion of these things
[57:50] but the point I'm making is that even as
[57:52] brother Brad was talking about the gifts
[57:53] and we spoke last service that you can
[57:55] have these virtues without the Holy
[57:59] Ghost
[58:00] and we'll see it we're going to see it
[58:01] as we talk about some characters this
[58:03] morning how you can have a measure or a
[58:06] quantity enough that would be noticeable
[58:08] it would be admirable that people would
[58:10] say well that's a good manner that's a
[58:11] good woman and yet you don't have the
[58:13] Holy Ghost yet you may not even be a
[58:15] Christian
[58:16] but yet every one of us has a something
[58:19] on the inside of us that inclines us
[58:21] towards God
[58:22] we don't all start out with these great
[58:24] attributes they're in us but they may
[58:27] not be obvious but there's something in
[58:28] us that's coming towards God but until
[58:31] we're sealed with the holy spirit all
[58:33] they are is attributes that come and go
[58:36] and then they hit the wall because guess
[58:38] what life will take us right up to the
[58:40] edge of those attributes
[58:42] and then it'll go
[58:45] and you're tumbling over and you've got
[58:47] no patience
[58:49] you've got no strength
[58:51] you've got no faith
[58:53] why because it's not sealed
[58:55] but I would say it's not mortared
[58:57] together it's not tied down it's not
[58:59] finished
[59:00] it's not a complete work
[59:02] Paul would talk about it in Romans 7. we
[59:04] spoke about this in previous Services
[59:06] where you talk about that fight within
[59:07] them and he says their desire is there
[59:09] the new heart and the new spirit's there
[59:12] I've got a desire to do right but he
[59:15] says evil is always there and I keep
[59:17] going to the evil
[59:19] the desires there
[59:21] but the power to do it's not there and
[59:22] he says who will deliver me from the
[59:24] body of this death
[59:26] Paul was fed up with it he was sick and
[59:28] tired of being sick and tired of not
[59:30] having the victory
[59:31] but we're talking about the heart of a
[59:33] Believer now and I want to spend some
[59:34] time with Saul and David this morning
[59:36] because they're a perfect example of two
[59:39] people with the exact same anointing
[59:41] with two very different results
[59:43] and we see that the difference is not
[59:45] the anointing but it's the heart itself
[59:48] because David never had any more than
[59:49] Saul had
[59:50] and so God didn't short shift Saul when
[59:53] it came to giving him an anointing of a
[59:55] king they had two very outcomes they
[59:57] were both very flawed men
[59:59] both chosen by God and yet have very
[1:00:02] different outcomes
[1:00:03] I want to show you what Saul looked like
[1:00:05] when God chose him
[1:00:07] he says in he's speaking of Saul's
[1:00:09] father it says he had a son whose name
[1:00:10] was Saul a choice young man and goodly
[1:00:13] and there was not among the children of
[1:00:16] Israel a goodly or person than he from
[1:00:20] his shoulders and upward he was higher
[1:00:21] than any of the people so Saul was big
[1:00:24] muscular handsome and he was taller than
[1:00:26] everybody else in the Kingdom to look at
[1:00:28] Saul was the best of the best and God
[1:00:30] said to Samuel he says this is him and
[1:00:33] so Samuel took a vial of oil and poured
[1:00:35] it upon his head and kissed him and said
[1:00:37] is it not because the Lord hath anointed
[1:00:39] thee to be Captain over his inheritance
[1:00:41] he said and the spirit of the Lord will
[1:00:44] come upon thee and thou shall prophesy
[1:00:47] with them he's saying you're going to go
[1:00:48] by the school of prophets and you're
[1:00:49] going to prophesy
[1:00:51] and he says and you shall be turned into
[1:00:54] another man
[1:00:56] and let it be that when these signs are
[1:00:58] come unto thee that thou do as occasions
[1:01:00] serve thee for God is with thee says so
[1:01:03] as these opportunities arise as events
[1:01:05] unfold he says step into it because God
[1:01:06] has put them in front of you and you're
[1:01:08] meant to go inside of them now we see
[1:01:10] right after that that Saul's going
[1:01:12] because remember he's looking for the
[1:01:13] donkeys that his dad had lost and he
[1:01:15] goes by way of the school of prophets
[1:01:17] and as soon as he's in the school of
[1:01:18] prophets he starts to prophesy and
[1:01:20] people start saying is Saul a prophet
[1:01:23] is he numbered among the prophets do we
[1:01:25] have a new prophet in our midst but as
[1:01:27] soon as he leaves then that goes away
[1:01:29] but in all of that Saul doesn't tell
[1:01:31] anybody I'm going to be king he doesn't
[1:01:33] say I'm anointed to be king he's under
[1:01:35] an anointing and it's causing him to do
[1:01:37] new things
[1:01:40] but he's not even yet a king yet
[1:01:41] he's still under an influence and it's
[1:01:43] having an effect on him then we go to
[1:01:45] where Samuel's announcing the new king
[1:01:47] and it's kind of like they have a stage
[1:01:48] up here and Samuel's up there and he
[1:01:50] says I'm going to introduce your new
[1:01:51] king to you
[1:01:53] and then they say well where is he
[1:01:56] he says I don't know so they literally
[1:01:58] had to go ask God where is Saul
[1:02:01] it says therefore they inquired of the
[1:02:03] Lord further if the man should yet come
[1:02:05] to them so they said is he going to come
[1:02:06] out or is he not going to come out who
[1:02:08] is he where is he and the Lord answered
[1:02:10] and said behold he had hid himself
[1:02:12] amongst the stuff
[1:02:15] Saul was hiding out because he didn't
[1:02:18] think he should be king
[1:02:21] let me tell you something
[1:02:23] if you don't think you should
[1:02:25] you definitely want to hold off
[1:02:29] don't let people pull you into it don't
[1:02:30] let people push you into it don't let
[1:02:32] people pry you into it don't let people
[1:02:34] cajole you into it don't let people joke
[1:02:36] you into it
[1:02:38] you wait
[1:02:40] he says he hath hid himself among the
[1:02:42] stuff so Saul was modest
[1:02:45] Saul felt unworthy Saul didn't think he
[1:02:47] should be doing this it says and they
[1:02:49] ran and fetched him then some when he
[1:02:51] stood up among the people he was higher
[1:02:52] than any of the people from his
[1:02:53] shoulders and upward and Samuel said to
[1:02:55] all the people see ye him whom the Lord
[1:02:58] had chosen that there is none like him
[1:03:00] among all the people
[1:03:02] now I want you to notice something here
[1:03:03] God says nobody can touch Saul he's the
[1:03:06] best of the best but who is he what is
[1:03:09] he using as a measuring stick
[1:03:11] the Kings like everybody else has
[1:03:13] this is not God's choice this is God's
[1:03:16] choice based on the people's desires he
[1:03:19] says this is the best you're going to
[1:03:20] get in this Kingdom you wanted a king
[1:03:23] like everybody else here is a king just
[1:03:25] like everybody else he says there's
[1:03:26] nobody else like him this is the most
[1:03:28] kingly of men that we have inside of
[1:03:30] Israel
[1:03:31] and the people shouted and said God Save
[1:03:34] the King and Saul is now anointed by God
[1:03:38] the presence the spirit the holy spirit
[1:03:40] is on Saul
[1:03:43] in those days God could anoint a man he
[1:03:46] couldn't fill him in but he could anoint
[1:03:48] the man God could put an anointing on
[1:03:49] that man to draw him into the purpose
[1:03:52] and pill and plan of God but that
[1:03:54] anointing did not control him it was an
[1:03:57] influence not a control amen it was more
[1:04:01] like the brooding of the holy spirit
[1:04:02] that we talked about where the presence
[1:04:03] of God is around you and it's calling
[1:04:05] you and it's making an impression it's
[1:04:07] trying to get you to a certain place but
[1:04:09] it's with you it's not in you and
[1:04:13] there's a big difference in that because
[1:04:14] we can experience this this with us when
[1:04:17] we're in a service
[1:04:18] and the presence of the Lord comes down
[1:04:20] even the personal presence of God is in
[1:04:23] the building and you can feel that
[1:04:24] remember brother Brandon will be in the
[1:04:26] in the prayer line and he'd have people
[1:04:28] come up and they'd come up and he'd say
[1:04:29] now you feel that you feel that you know
[1:04:32] something's here don't you you're in the
[1:04:33] presence of the Angel of the Lord and
[1:04:36] they could feel that and it's a presence
[1:04:38] and it's an anointing but it's only with
[1:04:40] them it's not in them
[1:04:42] and so there's great potential when the
[1:04:44] Lord is with you
[1:04:46] but it's not the filling the infilling
[1:04:48] of the holy spirit amen
[1:04:50] so we know the story about Paul I
[1:04:51] preached on it for the Paul has preached
[1:04:53] on it extensively with the young people
[1:04:54] I know and Saul did well for a very
[1:04:57] short time but within two years Saul
[1:04:59] makes a fatal mistake
[1:05:01] two years and Saul is toast in the eyes
[1:05:03] of God and what was his mistake he
[1:05:06] strayed from his calling as king and he
[1:05:09] stepped into the office of prophet he
[1:05:11] stepped into a ministerial office
[1:05:13] instead of a kingly office and he
[1:05:15] offered a sacrifice instead of waiting
[1:05:16] for Samuel to show up and at that moment
[1:05:18] God said the kingdom is going to be
[1:05:20] taken away from you his impatience and
[1:05:22] his worry and the pull of the people
[1:05:24] caused him to step out of his place
[1:05:26] and Samuel said to Saul thou Hast done
[1:05:28] foolishly thou has not kept the
[1:05:30] Commandment of the Lord thy God which he
[1:05:32] commanded thee for now would the Lord
[1:05:34] have established thy kingdom upon Israel
[1:05:36] forever
[1:05:37] but now thy kingdom shall not continue
[1:05:39] the Lord hath sought him a man after his
[1:05:42] own heart and the Lord hath commanded
[1:05:44] him to be Captain over his people
[1:05:46] because thou has not kept that which the
[1:05:49] Lord commanded thee
[1:05:50] but I want you to consider something
[1:05:52] this after this Saul still got victories
[1:05:56] Saul still ruled as King Saul still
[1:05:59] defeated his enemies he still kept the
[1:06:01] land safe he still kept the people safe
[1:06:03] and the prophets still kept coming to
[1:06:06] him to tell him what to do
[1:06:08] but did you ever notice Saul always
[1:06:10] needed a prophet
[1:06:12] Saul had no relationship with God
[1:06:15] God couldn't speak to Saul
[1:06:17] but with David the only time he needed a
[1:06:19] prophet was for correction
[1:06:21] otherwise God worked with David all
[1:06:23] along
[1:06:24] God could work with David God couldn't
[1:06:26] work with Saul
[1:06:29] God had respect for that kingly position
[1:06:31] God didn't forsake the people because
[1:06:33] the leader had fallen and so for the
[1:06:35] sake of the people he kept trying to
[1:06:37] lead Saul he kept trying to guide us all
[1:06:39] he kept giving Saul his orders and his
[1:06:41] commands and Saul never had his own
[1:06:44] leadership from God he always had to go
[1:06:45] through an intermediary he always had to
[1:06:47] go through a prophet
[1:06:49] and he's still anointed king God says
[1:06:52] I'm taking the Kingdom from you I've
[1:06:54] found somebody that's just that has a
[1:06:55] heart just like mine but he's still
[1:06:57] anointed and he's still King God didn't
[1:06:59] move a single thing from there
[1:07:01] and yet Saul could never truly humble
[1:07:05] himself to fully obey the word of God
[1:07:08] Saul was a 95 percent believer
[1:07:12] he'd go just to the edge and they'd stop
[1:07:14] he'd never do it exactly the way God
[1:07:17] told us to do it
[1:07:18] he could never do it
[1:07:20] he could never do it
[1:07:22] his repentance was always in the moment
[1:07:26] and then he come right back around and
[1:07:27] he'd make the same mistake over and over
[1:07:30] and over again and not only that when he
[1:07:32] made the mistake he doubled down he'd
[1:07:34] say no no I did it I did what the Lord
[1:07:36] said and you know we see at the end when
[1:07:37] he goes after agag and the amlikites and
[1:07:40] and God said destroy everything destroy
[1:07:42] the animals and and he tells Saul you
[1:07:44] know he saved some of the animals and he
[1:07:46] comes to Samuel and he says Samuel I've
[1:07:47] done what the Lord command and Samuel
[1:07:49] says how can you say that when I can
[1:07:50] hear the cows moving and the and the
[1:07:52] goats bleeding and the Sheep banging I
[1:07:53] mean the evidence is in front of you
[1:07:55] that you didn't do it and yet Saul was
[1:07:56] so blinded by his own importance by his
[1:07:59] own desire for people to look up to him
[1:08:01] that he couldn't even see that he
[1:08:03] disobeyed the word of a god and then
[1:08:05] he'd act repentant when the prophet
[1:08:06] finally pinned him down he'd act
[1:08:08] repentant
[1:08:10] but what would he do
[1:08:11] he'd always come back to but don't make
[1:08:13] me look bad
[1:08:15] that's all he wanted he didn't want to
[1:08:17] look bad he didn't want to be
[1:08:18] embarrassed he didn't want the people to
[1:08:19] see him get knocked down like that
[1:08:24] Saul this is Samuel talking to him he
[1:08:26] says
[1:08:27] Samuel said to Saul stay and I will tell
[1:08:29] thee what the Lord has said to me this
[1:08:30] night he said to him say on and Samuel
[1:08:33] said when thou was little in thine own
[1:08:35] sight
[1:08:36] was thou not made the head of the tribes
[1:08:38] of Israel and the Lord Anointed The King
[1:08:40] over Israel so Saul's stepped changed as
[1:08:43] soon as he stepped into kingship
[1:08:45] and it wasn't a humble change it was a
[1:08:47] prideful change
[1:08:49] Saul went backward the minute he became
[1:08:52] king
[1:08:54] he never moved forward
[1:08:56] he says and the Lord sent thee on a
[1:08:58] journey and said go and utterly destroy
[1:09:00] the Sinners the amalekites and fight
[1:09:01] against them until they be consumed
[1:09:03] wherefore then didst thou not obey the
[1:09:05] voice of the Lord but this fly upon the
[1:09:08] spoil and this evil in the sight of the
[1:09:09] Lord
[1:09:10] these are the potential actions of a
[1:09:12] Believer with a heart inclined towards
[1:09:15] God but without character for their
[1:09:17] position
[1:09:19] Saul's a believer
[1:09:22] Saul is a a predestinated son of God
[1:09:26] but what is it he stepped higher than
[1:09:29] his character
[1:09:30] he stepped higher than he's meant to be
[1:09:32] Saul Saul was was weak he wasn't meant
[1:09:35] to be a king he wasn't chosen because he
[1:09:38] was kingly he was chosen because he
[1:09:40] looked like a king not because he
[1:09:42] actually was a king inside of him on the
[1:09:45] inside of his heart
[1:09:46] his position was higher than his
[1:09:48] character and his heart was not
[1:09:49] compatible with kingship Saul was not a
[1:09:52] great leader
[1:09:54] Saul was a great figurehead but he
[1:09:56] wasn't a great leader his approach is
[1:09:58] thinking his desires were not those of a
[1:10:00] king and if you look in the scripture
[1:10:01] you'll realize the problem with Saul is
[1:10:03] that he was never proven
[1:10:05] and he was never trained
[1:10:08] he was never tested before he was put
[1:10:10] into position he was put into position
[1:10:12] with an anointing but without any
[1:10:14] training without any testing Saul
[1:10:15] skipped out on King's School
[1:10:17] David went through it for 15 years Saul
[1:10:19] skipped it
[1:10:21] and that was God showing that the
[1:10:22] appearance was not going to get us there
[1:10:24] the way we look the way we think or even
[1:10:26] our natural heart even a new heart won't
[1:10:28] get us there there's something has to
[1:10:30] happen there's a training there's a
[1:10:31] proving that has to go
[1:10:34] but Saul was a Believer he didn't go to
[1:10:35] hell when he died remember Samuel said
[1:10:37] you're going to be with me
[1:10:38] you're going to be with me Saul
[1:10:41] you're going to die in battle and your
[1:10:43] sons are going to die in battle but
[1:10:44] you're going to be with me he was still
[1:10:46] a predestinated Son of God but he was
[1:10:48] outside of what his true calling he was
[1:10:51] meant to be just a regular guy
[1:10:55] it's okay to be a regular guy
[1:10:58] most of us are meant to be regular in
[1:11:00] the sense that hey you can't have too
[1:11:01] many chiefs
[1:11:03] but
[1:11:04] stay in your lane
[1:11:06] stay in your lane
[1:11:08] if God will train you you'll be ready as
[1:11:10] you step up into these different things
[1:11:12] Saul was a good man but ruined by the
[1:11:14] desires of the people
[1:11:16] it was the people put him there
[1:11:19] if the people never ask for a king if
[1:11:20] the people never forsaken the prophets
[1:11:22] if they never walked away from God then
[1:11:24] Saul would never been put in the
[1:11:25] position it was the desires of the
[1:11:27] people that destroyed him he was and
[1:11:29] then he was destroyed by a lack of
[1:11:30] preparation as well
[1:11:32] God said you you guys want a king I'll
[1:11:34] give you a king but don't expect me to
[1:11:36] train him you're going to have to work
[1:11:37] with him
[1:11:38] and then in the end he was overcome by
[1:11:39] his own ambitions
[1:11:41] Saul started falling pretty quickly
[1:11:44] within two years Saul had fallen and yet
[1:11:46] even after he falls he says I want to be
[1:11:49] king more than I want to be right and he
[1:11:51] keeps going and making the same mistake
[1:11:52] over and over again he got a taste
[1:11:54] of what it meant to have power
[1:11:56] to have influence to have money to have
[1:11:58] whatever he wanted to be able to control
[1:12:00] people in these different things and
[1:12:01] that was his downfall was he wanted that
[1:12:03] more than he wanted to be right with God
[1:12:06] I know us we know Samuel went in the
[1:12:07] morning after this he was just
[1:12:09] heartbroken because he saw the effect
[1:12:10] not just on Saul I believe he saw that
[1:12:13] Saul was a good man at heart
[1:12:15] but way out of his League way over his
[1:12:17] head and the people were suffering
[1:12:18] because of it as well and then God comes
[1:12:20] and he says hey quit your morning I've
[1:12:22] got somebody else prepared go and anoint
[1:12:24] him and so we know Samuel goes over to
[1:12:25] Bethlehem and he goes to the house of
[1:12:27] Jesse and and Jesse starts to bring his
[1:12:30] sons perform and of course the way they
[1:12:31] did those days you started with the
[1:12:33] oldest and so eliab was the oldest that
[1:12:35] said and it came to pass when they were
[1:12:36] come that he looked on eliab and said
[1:12:38] surely the Lord's anointed is before him
[1:12:41] and the Lord said unto Samuel look not
[1:12:43] on his countenance nor on the height of
[1:12:45] his stature because I have refused him
[1:12:47] for the Lord seeth not as man seeth for
[1:12:51] man looketh on the outward appearance
[1:12:52] but the Lord looketh on the heart
[1:12:56] eliab was the oldest no doubt the
[1:12:58] biggest the strongest and Samuel said
[1:13:00] this is the obvious choice and God said
[1:13:02] obvious is not the way I work
[1:13:05] obvious is not the way I work right
[1:13:07] God's thoughts are higher than our
[1:13:09] thoughts and his ways are higher than
[1:13:10] our ways and they're incompatible they
[1:13:12] don't work together
[1:13:14] he says I'm looking at the heart and
[1:13:15] eliab's heart is not going to do the job
[1:13:17] as king
[1:13:18] says in Samuel said unto Jesse are here
[1:13:21] all thy children because he went through
[1:13:22] the whole all the whole the whole list
[1:13:24] of brothers and they all went before him
[1:13:25] he says well maybe the next one then
[1:13:26] maybe the next one hey they all look
[1:13:28] good God said no none of them I've
[1:13:29] rejected them all and he said there
[1:13:31] remains yet the youngest and behold he
[1:13:33] keeps the sheep and Samuel said to Jesse
[1:13:35] send and fetch him for we will not sit
[1:13:37] down till he come hither
[1:13:39] he says we're not going to eat until
[1:13:40] we've seen the last son and he sent and
[1:13:43] brought him in now he was Ruddy and with
[1:13:45] all of the beautiful countenance and
[1:13:47] goodly to look at that means he was
[1:13:49] handsome
[1:13:50] it's not that God doesn't choose
[1:13:52] good-looking people but he doesn't
[1:13:53] choose them because they're good looking
[1:13:55] your looks matter not to God Christ came
[1:13:57] and there was nothing about him that was
[1:13:59] good looking
[1:14:00] it's not that he can't use a
[1:14:02] good-looking person but he doesn't
[1:14:03] choose him because they're good looking
[1:14:04] because that's what Saul was Saul was
[1:14:07] just good looking but he didn't have
[1:14:08] anything inside that would resonate with
[1:14:10] God
[1:14:11] he said and the Lord said arise anoint
[1:14:13] him for this is he then Samuel took the
[1:14:16] Horn of oil and anointed him in the
[1:14:17] midst of his Brethren and the spirit of
[1:14:20] the Lord Came Upon David from that day
[1:14:23] forward
[1:14:25] so Samuel rose up and went to Rama
[1:14:27] it says but the spirit of the Lord
[1:14:30] departed from Saul and an evil spirit
[1:14:33] from the Lord troubled him
[1:14:34] now remember God doesn't have evil
[1:14:37] spirits
[1:14:38] but we see that what Satan and his
[1:14:41] demons can come before the Throne of God
[1:14:42] in those times and they can come there
[1:14:44] and God can allow them access he did it
[1:14:47] with job he did it with the lying
[1:14:49] prophets of of Ahab remember when
[1:14:51] Jehoshaphat came a lion Spirit came up
[1:14:53] before God and he says I'll go down and
[1:14:56] I'll make those prophets prophesy
[1:14:58] falsely and God allows it and what
[1:15:00] happened is God allows an evil spirit to
[1:15:02] come take the place of the spirit that
[1:15:03] was resting on him from God as soon as
[1:15:06] the spirit the kingly spirit falls on
[1:15:08] David it can't stay on Saul anymore and
[1:15:10] so it jumps away
[1:15:12] but I want to show you something here
[1:15:13] that's critical as we're talking about
[1:15:15] the New Birth because David has a heart
[1:15:18] that's like God's heart
[1:15:20] the difference between Saul and David is
[1:15:22] David's heart is like God's heart that
[1:15:25] means his thoughts are Godly
[1:15:26] the way God thinks his motives are like
[1:15:29] Gods his objectives are like Gods he's
[1:15:32] subject to the word of God and he does
[1:15:34] things fully according to the word
[1:15:36] that's the big difference between the
[1:15:38] two of them but this isn't the infilling
[1:15:40] of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:41] he has the Holy Spirit on him and we'll
[1:15:44] read a quote where brother Brown says it
[1:15:45] he has the holy spirit with him but this
[1:15:47] is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:51] we know that Joel 228 ports forward to
[1:15:53] it John the Baptist pointed forward to
[1:15:54] it Jesus pointed forward to it this is
[1:15:56] what they could have then which was an
[1:15:57] anointing on them but not in them and
[1:15:59] brother Brown says it this way he says
[1:16:01] from that day the Holy Spirit was with
[1:16:04] David he said God was with him he went
[1:16:08] back out into the Wilderness happy
[1:16:10] that's an amazing thing the kingly
[1:16:12] spirit is all him a holy spirit
[1:16:13] anointing is on him to take him into
[1:16:15] kingship and he goes back into his
[1:16:17] little job as a shepherd and he's happy
[1:16:20] they went on back down and the spirit
[1:16:22] departed from Saul he'd backslid and
[1:16:24] went so far away from God until the
[1:16:26] spirit had left him and an evil spirit
[1:16:28] took his place and come on Saul you know
[1:16:30] what a sinner can't backslide
[1:16:32] only a Christian can backslide
[1:16:34] Saul was a Christian he was a he was a
[1:16:36] professing Believer he was a Believer it
[1:16:38] says and Saul was all Moody and in a bad
[1:16:40] humor and kicking things around all out
[1:16:43] of sorts like some people gets on Monday
[1:16:45] morning
[1:16:47] I saw a couple people laugh
[1:16:50] because what if your anointing is only
[1:16:53] in church
[1:16:54] come Monday morning you're all out of
[1:16:56] sorts
[1:16:58] you want to know if you've got an
[1:16:59] infilling
[1:17:00] or just an anointing on you
[1:17:02] how does your action on Monday compare
[1:17:04] to your action on Sunday when you're in
[1:17:05] church
[1:17:06] amen
[1:17:08] he says so he was out of sorts all the
[1:17:12] time and we see Saul Saul was a Grumpy
[1:17:15] Bear he was like a bear with a wounded
[1:17:17] Paul throwing Spears at everyone yelling
[1:17:19] at everybody accusing them of working
[1:17:21] against them even his own son everything
[1:17:23] was against Saul in his head everybody
[1:17:26] was out to get him
[1:17:27] he says he was all out of sorts he was
[1:17:29] out of sorts all the time did you know
[1:17:32] that's an evil spirit
[1:17:36] if our Mondays look like that
[1:17:39] there's something missing
[1:17:43] we're talking about an anointing and an
[1:17:44] anointing can lift off of you
[1:17:47] it can pull away and you can pull away
[1:17:50] you can backslide out of an anointing
[1:17:52] you can pull away from these things an
[1:17:54] anointing isn't part of you but it's
[1:17:56] with you and it's on you but it can go
[1:17:58] away as well and how do we know that
[1:18:00] because it went away from Saul and it
[1:18:02] rested on somebody else it's separated
[1:18:04] from Saul the king anointing moved from
[1:18:06] one man to another
[1:18:08] and in Saul's place now something's got
[1:18:10] to take it and so an evil spirit comes
[1:18:12] down
[1:18:13] why because he was focused on image
[1:18:16] image is what ran Saul's life he wrote
[1:18:19] he wanted to look correct rather than be
[1:18:21] correct
[1:18:22] he wanted to look respectable rather
[1:18:24] than be respectable
[1:18:27] but understand this David and Saul are
[1:18:30] both believers
[1:18:31] both sons of God
[1:18:34] both called of God and yet one is in his
[1:18:37] right position and one was completely
[1:18:39] out of his element yet with the same
[1:18:41] anointing David didn't get anything more
[1:18:43] than Saul did in this anointing it's the
[1:18:45] exact same anointing what was on Saul
[1:18:47] came on David and yet has a completely
[1:18:49] different result
[1:18:51] Saul shouldn't have been King at all
[1:18:52] that's a simple truth he shouldn't have
[1:18:54] been King but there was nothing in him
[1:18:56] that would allow him to do these things
[1:18:57] the king anointing from God couldn't
[1:19:00] overcome what was in Saul's heart
[1:19:02] and you get a right heart you get a
[1:19:04] right Spirit a new heart a new spirit
[1:19:07] just the anointing on you is not going
[1:19:09] to override that
[1:19:10] because you're still in control
[1:19:12] it's yours it's not his it's from him
[1:19:15] but it's still yours
[1:19:17] you need us you need something inside of
[1:19:19] the control tower
[1:19:20] Saul never grew in character
[1:19:23] saw never matured Saul never improved
[1:19:25] with time in fact Saul went downhill
[1:19:27] almost from the day he started in there
[1:19:29] he had a few good moments but even we
[1:19:31] see what he did with Jonathan he was mad
[1:19:32] at his own son and was going to kill his
[1:19:34] son for giving them Victory because he
[1:19:36] got a religious attitude and tried to
[1:19:37] put something on the people that the
[1:19:39] scriptures never told him to do and then
[1:19:41] Jonathan goes and eats some honey and
[1:19:43] Saul says I'm going to kill you for that
[1:19:44] because I said we weren't going to do it
[1:19:46] Saul was holding the people back from
[1:19:48] Victory out of a religious spirit and
[1:19:50] Jonathan went and did the Practical
[1:19:51] thing and got a great victory
[1:19:54] so I'll turn against everyone he
[1:19:55] couldn't yield to the will of God all he
[1:19:57] wanted was him him me me me I I
[1:20:01] exact same anointing on David produced a
[1:20:04] completely different result and it was
[1:20:06] because he had the heart of God inside
[1:20:07] of him he had a heart like God's inside
[1:20:09] of him
[1:20:11] Saul's request to Samuel was don't
[1:20:12] embarrass me
[1:20:14] don't walk away from me get down and
[1:20:16] pray with me let the people see that
[1:20:17] you're still with me don't let them know
[1:20:19] I'm messed up don't let them know I've
[1:20:20] lost the kingdom
[1:20:22] just make me look good in front of them
[1:20:24] but what was David's after David failed
[1:20:26] God what did what did David do when he
[1:20:28] failed when he he killed Uriah and he
[1:20:30] took Bathsheba and he he committed
[1:20:31] adultery and he committed murder
[1:20:35] consider that church a man after God's
[1:20:39] Own Heart committed adultery and
[1:20:41] committed murder
[1:20:44] remember brother Brown says with that
[1:20:45] new spirit you can do just about
[1:20:47] anything
[1:20:49] why because you're not sealed
[1:20:52] the control tower is open for discussion
[1:20:59] still a child of God
[1:21:01] still a child of God and that's Grace
[1:21:02] Church
[1:21:04] a child of God can commit adultery and
[1:21:07] they can commit murder in the process of
[1:21:10] the new birth why because they're not a
[1:21:13] finished work
[1:21:14] and that's why we look to Grace
[1:21:16] and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:21:18] but let's look at what we read and this
[1:21:20] was our opening scripture I'll read a
[1:21:22] few more I'll start a little earlier for
[1:21:24] it in Psalms 51. this is David's prayer
[1:21:27] to God after it's made very clear that
[1:21:30] he sinned with bathsheb and it's all out
[1:21:32] in the open
[1:21:33] he says have mercy upon me o God
[1:21:36] according to thy loving kindness
[1:21:38] according unto the multitude of thy
[1:21:41] Tender Mercies blot out my
[1:21:43] transgressions
[1:21:44] David never makes an excuse
[1:21:47] he doesn't give a reason but you
[1:21:50] committed adultery and you committed
[1:21:51] murder it's not like there's a religious
[1:21:52] spirit can make that right
[1:21:54] but you'd be surprised how many people
[1:21:56] will do it
[1:21:57] the murder of man's character
[1:22:00] and they'll go out and they'll take a
[1:22:01] man's wife they'll remarry do these
[1:22:03] different things and they'll put a
[1:22:04] religious spin on it
[1:22:06] he says Wash Me throughly from mine
[1:22:09] iniquity
[1:22:10] and cleanse me from my sin for I
[1:22:13] acknowledge my transgressions and my sin
[1:22:17] is ever before me he's not trying to
[1:22:19] hide it he's not trying to bury it he's
[1:22:21] not trying to put it on anybody else he
[1:22:22] says I did it
[1:22:25] because what the prophet said Thou Art
[1:22:26] the man and David said you know what I
[1:22:28] am the man
[1:22:30] I did it
[1:22:32] shouldn't have done it but I did it
[1:22:35] and he humbled himself
[1:22:37] and he went to God and he asked for
[1:22:39] mercy
[1:22:40] he said against thee the only have I
[1:22:43] sinned and done this evil in thy sight
[1:22:46] that thou mightest be justified when
[1:22:48] thou speakest and be clear when thou
[1:22:50] judges behold I was shaping an iniquity
[1:22:53] and in sin did my mother conceive me
[1:22:57] behold thou desirest truth in the inward
[1:23:00] parts and in the hidden part Thou shalt
[1:23:03] make me to know wisdom he says Purge me
[1:23:06] with hyssop and I shall be clean now
[1:23:09] remember what did they use hyssop for
[1:23:11] they use it to apply the blood on the
[1:23:13] doorposts
[1:23:14] of the home and what did it do it
[1:23:18] Justified the entire house
[1:23:21] the blood covered the sins of those that
[1:23:23] were inside of it
[1:23:25] but he says listen it's not enough to
[1:23:27] just put it on the doors of my house
[1:23:29] he says I want it on the doors of my
[1:23:31] life
[1:23:31] I need blood on me I need you to purge
[1:23:34] me I need you to cover me I need you to
[1:23:37] what take this sin away
[1:23:40] he's saying God you've got to do this
[1:23:42] work not me
[1:23:46] Purge me with hyssop and I shall be
[1:23:47] clean wash me and I shall be whiter than
[1:23:50] snow
[1:23:52] make me to hear joy and gladness that
[1:23:55] the bones which thou has broken May
[1:23:57] rejoice
[1:23:59] brother Brian would talk about the
[1:24:00] shepherd remember him when he's got a
[1:24:01] disobedient sheep that keeps wandering
[1:24:03] away what does he do
[1:24:05] he takes the leg and he places it over a
[1:24:07] rock and he strikes it and he breaks the
[1:24:09] leg
[1:24:10] he says and then he sets that joint
[1:24:13] or that bone he says and then he carries
[1:24:15] that lamb around
[1:24:17] for weeks until it can walk on its own
[1:24:19] he says and that's so that the Sheep
[1:24:21] will get attached to the shepherd
[1:24:23] David says you've broken some bones
[1:24:26] he says fix them
[1:24:29] he says hide thy face from my sins and
[1:24:32] blot out all mine iniquities
[1:24:34] create in me a clean heart o God and
[1:24:38] renew a right Spirit within me he says
[1:24:41] cast me not away from thy presence and
[1:24:44] take not thy Holy Spirit from me
[1:24:47] permanently
[1:24:49] he's saying don't remove my anointing
[1:24:51] God because without it
[1:24:53] I'm going right back to Saul
[1:24:56] I'll be in a Saul condition
[1:24:58] he says I won't be able to do what you
[1:25:00] call me to do if you take that anointing
[1:25:01] from me he says restore unto me the joy
[1:25:05] of thy salvation and uphold me with thy
[1:25:07] free spirit David acknowledged with no
[1:25:10] excuse he messed up
[1:25:15] and then he truly repented
[1:25:19] he didn't try and hide
[1:25:22] then try and step away
[1:25:25] the woman that thou gave me
[1:25:28] right no no he said this one's on me
[1:25:30] it's all on me
[1:25:32] and I need you to do something in my
[1:25:34] life he asked for an immortal change he
[1:25:36] asked for a cleansing he knew he'd
[1:25:37] messed up he knew that he was lacking
[1:25:39] something and he didn't care about his
[1:25:40] image
[1:25:41] he didn't care about Restoration in the
[1:25:43] eyes of the people all he wanted to do
[1:25:45] was get back in the presence of that
[1:25:48] anointing
[1:25:49] that's all David wanted to do why
[1:25:51] because God had withdrawn that anointing
[1:25:53] from David in his sin
[1:25:55] David said you've you've pulled away
[1:25:58] you've pulled away but you got to come
[1:26:00] back I need you back
[1:26:03] why because that anointing can raise and
[1:26:05] drop rise and drop based on David's
[1:26:08] actions
[1:26:09] he says get me back in your presence God
[1:26:12] that's where I belong
[1:26:14] better is one day in your courts than
[1:26:15] thousands elsewhere he says one thing if
[1:26:18] I desired all David wanted to do was be
[1:26:21] in the presence of God and that's the
[1:26:22] only thing
[1:26:24] what is it he lost the feeling of joy of
[1:26:26] his salvation brother I would say Time
[1:26:28] Time Again David never lost his
[1:26:30] salvation he lost the feeling of it he
[1:26:32] lost the joy of his salvation he lost
[1:26:34] the satisfaction of his relationship
[1:26:36] with God
[1:26:38] what he was just going through a Daily
[1:26:40] Grind now because he was in the doldrums
[1:26:43] he messed up
[1:26:45] and he wasn't feeling it if we could put
[1:26:47] it that way and he was crying out to God
[1:26:48] saying come back come back I need you I
[1:26:51] can't live like this I don't want to
[1:26:53] live like this
[1:26:55] church is not wrong to ask God to
[1:26:57] restore the emotion of our relationship
[1:27:00] my wife and I at times in in our
[1:27:03] marriage
[1:27:04] you know I've spoken about this many
[1:27:05] times we had times where it felt
[1:27:07] clinical
[1:27:08] and it felt like a business transaction
[1:27:09] at times where it was just go to work
[1:27:11] and come home and do this and do that
[1:27:13] and you're just in a role rather than in
[1:27:15] a relationship
[1:27:17] that's no way for a marriage to work
[1:27:20] it's no way for a Christian to have a
[1:27:21] relationship with God where it's just
[1:27:23] well I'm going to go to church on
[1:27:24] Wednesday nights I'm going to go to
[1:27:25] church on Sunday mornings I'm going to
[1:27:26] read my Bible I'm going to no no that's
[1:27:28] clinical that's roll that's role playing
[1:27:32] but if there's no joy there if there's
[1:27:33] no peace there there's no love there if
[1:27:35] there's no satisfaction there then what
[1:27:37] is it doing
[1:27:38] it's not wrong to ask God to restore the
[1:27:40] joy the emotion of the relationship
[1:27:43] because it's supposed to be there
[1:27:44] brother Brown would say if there's no
[1:27:46] emotion there is no life
[1:27:48] there's got to be something there love
[1:27:50] will have emotion attached to it peace
[1:27:51] obviously has a motion attached to it
[1:27:53] rest in these different things amen we
[1:27:55] need to enjoy our walk with God
[1:27:58] even in the hard times we ought to be
[1:27:59] able to say he's with me and I'm okay
[1:28:02] with what's going on
[1:28:05] you notice what happened when that King
[1:28:06] anointing lifted with David
[1:28:08] became on David became judgmental
[1:28:12] and he lost his discernment
[1:28:15] because that story compared to what
[1:28:17] David had just gone through is so
[1:28:19] obvious that you'd think David should
[1:28:21] have got it
[1:28:22] it was a very obvious thing to talk
[1:28:24] about
[1:28:25] and yet his conscience didn't bother him
[1:28:28] and he immediately went to judgment he
[1:28:30] became religious he became zealous
[1:28:32] without conscience or humility and he
[1:28:34] didn't actually look inward he was
[1:28:35] always at turned now towards the outward
[1:28:37] and he was so quick to judge somebody
[1:28:39] else why because that anointing has gone
[1:28:42] away and he lost his discernment
[1:28:43] didn't even realize he was talking about
[1:28:45] him
[1:28:46] but what restored David Church
[1:28:50] what restored David back to where that
[1:28:53] anointing could come back on him to
[1:28:54] where he could step into his kingship
[1:28:55] again
[1:28:56] repentance
[1:28:59] but even with repentance under the law
[1:29:02] of Moses David was supposed to die
[1:29:06] king or not David was supposed to die
[1:29:09] let's know what the prophet of God says
[1:29:11] what saved David when his own judgment
[1:29:15] said the man will die he'll pay to the
[1:29:18] uttermost and he'll pay for it with his
[1:29:20] life
[1:29:21] and the prophet said surely
[1:29:24] Grace
[1:29:25] you'll not die
[1:29:26] you'll not die David Grace has saved you
[1:29:29] it was Grace to David that saved him oh
[1:29:31] my if it hadn't been for Grace where
[1:29:33] will we all be
[1:29:35] he says is that right certainly
[1:29:36] Sovereign Grace is from a sovereign one
[1:29:40] Sovereign he says what can it do
[1:29:42] Sovereign can do whatever it wants to
[1:29:47] Sovereign can do whatever it wants to
[1:29:51] Sovereign Grace can only be given by one
[1:29:53] that's Sovereign and God is Sovereign so
[1:29:56] he can give Sovereign Grace therefore
[1:29:58] being Sovereign Grace don't have to ask
[1:30:01] anybody
[1:30:06] the bride
[1:30:08] supposed to be gracious
[1:30:11] freely you've received freely give
[1:30:14] our thoughts ought to be gracious
[1:30:16] our approach ought to be gracious our
[1:30:18] response ought to be gracious
[1:30:20] because it's Grace that called us
[1:30:23] Grace is supposed to flow through us
[1:30:26] he says therefore being Sovereign Grace
[1:30:28] don't have to ask anybody it doesn't
[1:30:30] have to it does what it wants to isn't
[1:30:33] that wonderful it doesn't have to ask
[1:30:34] can I do this or shall I do this can I
[1:30:36] must I will I doesn't do it it does it
[1:30:39] itself Grace is Sovereign therefore he
[1:30:42] can save the vilest
[1:30:44] he can save the impurest
[1:30:46] he can save the immoralist
[1:30:49] he can heal the sickest he says
[1:30:51] hallelujah
[1:30:53] we're talking about a new heart and a
[1:30:55] new spirit we see two sons of God
[1:30:57] with a heart inside of them
[1:31:00] and the only difference is that heart
[1:31:02] same role same anointing Same Spirit
[1:31:06] two very different outcomes David for
[1:31:09] all God's compliments about his heart
[1:31:11] still committed murder and adultery
[1:31:16] David had good intentions
[1:31:19] and you know what David's good
[1:31:21] intentions
[1:31:22] took the ark from where it was resting
[1:31:25] and he put it on a card of oxen and
[1:31:28] caused a righteous man to put his hand
[1:31:29] out and die when he tried to touch the
[1:31:31] ark and he wasn't allowed to because he
[1:31:33] wasn't a priest David's good intentions
[1:31:35] got a righteous man killed
[1:31:37] why
[1:31:38] because he didn't check his intentions
[1:31:40] with the word
[1:31:42] he had the right idea
[1:31:45] he had a good idea
[1:31:46] but he didn't check it with the word he
[1:31:48] had an anointing of the spirit of God
[1:31:50] that was calling him to bring that Ark
[1:31:51] back but he didn't check it with the
[1:31:54] word David didn't have a new birth he
[1:31:56] just had an anointing and that meant it
[1:31:58] was subject still to him rather than to
[1:32:01] God
[1:32:02] David had a heart that God said his his
[1:32:04] heart's just like my heart and yet he
[1:32:06] was able to do some pretty bad things in
[1:32:07] his life
[1:32:08] but one thing about that heart is that
[1:32:10] it kept bringing him back to God
[1:32:14] it kept bringing him to repentance it
[1:32:16] kept bringing him to seeking the
[1:32:18] presence of God more than everything
[1:32:19] else when David lost his kingship
[1:32:23] see Saul of Saul lost his kingship or
[1:32:25] when salt had a a threat against his
[1:32:28] kingship he always struck out it was
[1:32:30] always violence
[1:32:31] it was always violence with Saul and yet
[1:32:34] David when Absalom takes the kingdom
[1:32:35] away and he's walking out and there's
[1:32:37] that guy comes out and he's cursing he's
[1:32:39] throwing rocks and and one of the sons
[1:32:40] you know Joe abber one of them says let
[1:32:42] me go take the head off that guy and he
[1:32:44] says no leave him Lord told him to do it
[1:32:46] don't worry about it
[1:32:48] why the law gives the Lord takes away
[1:32:51] all David cared about is is a is am I in
[1:32:53] the will of God
[1:32:55] is God still with me personally not
[1:32:58] blessing everything around me but is God
[1:33:00] still with me do I still have that
[1:33:01] relationship that connection
[1:33:04] if God puts a new heart and a new spirit
[1:33:06] in US it'll bring us to repentance every
[1:33:08] single time
[1:33:10] because that's the heart for this age is
[1:33:12] to repent that's the Zeal of this age is
[1:33:14] to repent and if you're going to come to
[1:33:16] the fullness of the baptism of the Holy
[1:33:17] Ghost there's got to be something in you
[1:33:19] that causes to us to repent that causes
[1:33:21] us to acknowledge our shortcomings that
[1:33:23] causes us to to talk about a need for
[1:33:25] deliverance that causes us to to seek
[1:33:27] leadership and guidance in these
[1:33:28] different things what is it David call
[1:33:30] it he said there's a deep crying to the
[1:33:32] Deep
[1:33:33] he said as the deer pants for the water
[1:33:35] so my soul longeth after thee David's
[1:33:38] only desire from that heart like God's
[1:33:41] heart was to seek the presence of God
[1:33:44] we're going to close with a thought here
[1:33:45] from Jeremiah and I love Jeremiah
[1:33:47] because he talks about the heart and he
[1:33:49] gives us such a clear picture of the
[1:33:51] dangers of the heart
[1:33:52] and the blessings of a heart if God's in
[1:33:54] it
[1:33:55] he says thus saith the Lord curse it be
[1:33:58] the man that trusteth in man and make it
[1:34:01] flesh his arm and whose heart departed
[1:34:03] from the Lord in other words he who
[1:34:04] depends on himself and those around him
[1:34:07] he says for he shall be like the heath
[1:34:09] in the desert and it shall not see when
[1:34:10] good cometh but shall inhabit the
[1:34:12] parched places in the wilderness in a
[1:34:15] salt land and not inhabited now that's
[1:34:17] not a good place to be in a desert you
[1:34:19] don't get any benefit from the rain and
[1:34:21] you're in a salt land and nothing grows
[1:34:23] in the salt land that's what they used
[1:34:24] to do in the old days is when a a a a
[1:34:26] country came in and conquered another
[1:34:28] one they'd salt the fields because it
[1:34:30] destroys the fields for decades because
[1:34:32] it ruins the mineralogy and you can't
[1:34:34] grow anything in it
[1:34:35] but then he says blessed is the man that
[1:34:37] trusteth in the Lord and whose hope the
[1:34:40] Lord is
[1:34:41] for he shall be as a tree planted By the
[1:34:43] Waters and that spreadth out her Roots
[1:34:45] by the river and shall not see when he
[1:34:47] cometh in other words it's not affected
[1:34:48] by heat it's not affected by
[1:34:50] circumstances it's not affected by tough
[1:34:52] circumstances
[1:34:53] but her leave shall be green
[1:34:56] and shall not be careful in other words
[1:34:58] shall not be worried or anxious in the
[1:34:59] year of drought neither shall cease from
[1:35:01] yielding fruit so in other words the
[1:35:03] conditions don't keep the believer from
[1:35:05] producing the fruit of the Holy Spirit
[1:35:08] reproduce no matter what why because
[1:35:10] we're planted by a different well we're
[1:35:12] planted by a different River of water
[1:35:13] we're always provided for
[1:35:16] amen
[1:35:18] but watch this transition though as
[1:35:20] Jeremiah comes in
[1:35:22] because he's contrasting between a man
[1:35:24] that trusts in himself and a man that
[1:35:25] trusts in God and he brings it back to
[1:35:27] the root of the problem and he says the
[1:35:29] heart is deceitful Above All Things
[1:35:33] all things
[1:35:35] and desperately wicked
[1:35:37] now that's not a good combination
[1:35:39] deceitful and wicked because it means
[1:35:42] it's always going to lead you the wrong
[1:35:43] way
[1:35:44] always
[1:35:46] always always
[1:35:47] he says who can know it who can
[1:35:50] understand it who can predict it he says
[1:35:52] I the Lord search the heart
[1:35:54] I try the Reigns that word Reigns
[1:35:56] actually means heart so he says I search
[1:35:57] it and I try it even to give every man
[1:36:00] according to his ways and according to
[1:36:03] the fruit of his doings so what's this
[1:36:06] warning here don't trust your heart
[1:36:09] even if you get a new heart
[1:36:12] it's not enough to trust the new heart
[1:36:16] because that new heart is supposed to
[1:36:18] lead you to God it does not replace God
[1:36:20] it's supposed to lead you to the
[1:36:21] indwelling of the Holy Spirit it doesn't
[1:36:23] replace it amen we have this saying that
[1:36:25] there's no deceit like self-dece
[1:36:29] it's a religious spirit today in in this
[1:36:31] laodicean church age and it's the
[1:36:33] highest form of Deceit that we face
[1:36:34] today because our heart tells us our
[1:36:37] heart
[1:36:38] tells us what's right
[1:36:39] and it blinds us to the word of God
[1:36:42] the words mantra today the world is
[1:36:44] saying follow your heart
[1:36:46] and you know what they're preaching it
[1:36:48] in churches follow your heart
[1:36:51] you can't do that remember David had a
[1:36:53] heart to build a house for the Lord
[1:36:56] and the prophet came and said do it do
[1:36:58] what's in your heart David
[1:37:00] the prophet didn't even check with God
[1:37:02] God the prophet said that sounds like a
[1:37:04] great idea do what's in your heart then
[1:37:06] the prophet goes away and God says no no
[1:37:08] no no
[1:37:09] David can't do it because he's a man of
[1:37:11] blood
[1:37:12] he says his son will build the temple
[1:37:14] so what did David do then Prophet comes
[1:37:16] back says sorry you're not allowed to do
[1:37:17] it great intentions good idea but it's
[1:37:19] not for you to do it but David said I'll
[1:37:21] prepare the way for it then
[1:37:22] I'll get everything prepared so that
[1:37:24] they can build it I'll get the materials
[1:37:26] together I'll get the contracts together
[1:37:27] I'll get everything prepared so that
[1:37:29] when my son he comes he's got everything
[1:37:31] that he needs to build it but yet his
[1:37:33] inclination of that heart was to do
[1:37:35] something and God didn't have it in his
[1:37:37] will for David to do it don't trust your
[1:37:40] heart
[1:37:41] your heart is the most deceitful thing
[1:37:43] there is and is desperately wicked
[1:37:44] Jeremiah said
[1:37:46] it's why we need a new one
[1:37:48] and even that new one isn't perfect
[1:37:51] but it's inclined towards the right
[1:37:53] thing but it's still going to be a
[1:37:54] battle amen that's why we follow what
[1:37:56] the word of God says not what feels
[1:37:58] right
[1:38:00] we hear it a lot even in message circles
[1:38:02] I feel led to do such and such I feel
[1:38:06] led to go so and so but you know what we
[1:38:08] don't hear
[1:38:10] I feel led to do such and such because
[1:38:13] the word says it
[1:38:15] and we've taken the leading
[1:38:20] and what ignore the word
[1:38:24] brother Brown says the holy spirit will
[1:38:25] lead you to the word
[1:38:27] not just the holy spirit will lead you
[1:38:28] but the holy spirit will lead you to the
[1:38:30] word he'll give you a basis he'll give
[1:38:31] you a foundation for your life for your
[1:38:33] decisions for your actions for the
[1:38:34] things you do and say and what happens
[1:38:36] is we go by what we if we were really
[1:38:38] honest we'd say it's a gut feeling
[1:38:40] but a gut feeling is not necessarily the
[1:38:43] Holy Ghost it has to be founded on the
[1:38:46] word of God Amen that's why we put the
[1:38:48] word of God in front of us as fine as
[1:38:50] frontlets and not our heart and not a
[1:38:52] new heart and not a new spirit we put
[1:38:54] the word in front of us and the word
[1:38:55] leads and guide us always
[1:38:58] always if it ain't in the word you're on
[1:39:01] your own
[1:39:03] you're on your own now the Holy Spirit
[1:39:04] can lead you in areas where maybe the
[1:39:06] word doesn't have something specific for
[1:39:08] it we Face a lot of Temptations we Face
[1:39:10] a lot of situations today we have a lot
[1:39:12] of Technology we have a a way of living
[1:39:14] today that's quite different than they
[1:39:15] ever imagined in Scripture
[1:39:17] but God has provided us a word to get us
[1:39:20] through
[1:39:21] so I have a hard time when somebody says
[1:39:23] well there's nothing in the word about
[1:39:24] it I believe there's always something in
[1:39:25] the word if we'll wait and be patient
[1:39:28] and pray and trust God will show us
[1:39:31] something in the word he'll do it
[1:39:33] because he's promised to lead us and
[1:39:34] guide us amen
[1:39:36] David's good intentions in his heart got
[1:39:37] him to bring the heart the the ark back
[1:39:39] to Jerusalem but his presumption of how
[1:39:41] to do it got a man killed why David's
[1:39:44] not a priest Dave is not supposed to
[1:39:46] move the Ark of the Covenant King's not
[1:39:48] supposed to do that the ministry's
[1:39:49] supposed to do it he got out of his Lane
[1:39:51] and it killed a man
[1:39:54] David numbered the people
[1:39:56] against the word of God
[1:39:59] he took a census why does the king Take
[1:40:01] a census to see how many people are
[1:40:04] there to see how many warriors he has to
[1:40:06] see how powerful his kingdom has become
[1:40:08] and God had forbidden them
[1:40:10] don't ever take a census
[1:40:12] because he says I am the one that makes
[1:40:14] the difference in you you're not going
[1:40:16] to win by Charities not going to win by
[1:40:17] horses you're not going to win by how
[1:40:19] many great warriors you have you're
[1:40:20] going to win because I'm with you and
[1:40:21] David disobeyed it and he got literally
[1:40:24] thousands of people killed because he
[1:40:26] got caught up in his own kingship
[1:40:28] even with a heart that was inclined
[1:40:30] towards God
[1:40:32] this new heart is meant to make you
[1:40:33] listen
[1:40:35] it's meant to make you learn
[1:40:36] it's meant to make you seek after the
[1:40:38] things of God give you a new approach a
[1:40:40] new way of thinking a new desire the
[1:40:41] prophet of God said it's supposed to
[1:40:43] drive you to the word of God but you
[1:40:46] still have a choice even with a new
[1:40:47] heart and a new spirit that's why we
[1:40:50] take everything back to an absolute
[1:40:52] which is the scriptures
[1:40:54] not on the feeling because remember the
[1:40:56] heart he said is the center of emotion
[1:40:59] and just because it feels a certain way
[1:41:00] doesn't mean that's the way it's
[1:41:02] supposed to be
[1:41:04] what is it we've got to put something in
[1:41:07] the middle of that heart that is an
[1:41:09] absolute in and of itself that is a
[1:41:10] token
[1:41:11] that is a finished work it's a seal
[1:41:15] that's what we're looking for is not a
[1:41:16] feeling but it's an absolute inside of
[1:41:18] us Church everyone in the Old Testament
[1:41:20] was looking forward to what we get to
[1:41:22] experience today in the full New Birth
[1:41:24] they experience justification under the
[1:41:26] blood of bulls and goats under the
[1:41:27] atonement brother Brahm said they
[1:41:29] experience justification their sins were
[1:41:31] covered and they were allowed to
[1:41:33] approach God in a certain way not in
[1:41:36] fullness but they were allowed to
[1:41:37] approach God he would work with them he
[1:41:39] would teach them he would bless them in
[1:41:40] these different things those sins were
[1:41:42] placed on animals the animals paid the
[1:41:43] price with their life and so those
[1:41:45] people could experience justification
[1:41:47] and sanctification in the fact that they
[1:41:49] could what they could walk around and
[1:41:51] they could they could hear the word that
[1:41:53] was preached by Moses and the priesthood
[1:41:55] and these different things and they
[1:41:56] could live a Sanctified life
[1:41:58] Paul lived a Sanctified life
[1:42:00] when he was Saul he lived a Sanctified
[1:42:03] life he says according to to the way
[1:42:04] that it's taught he says I was a perfect
[1:42:06] man there's no flaw in the way that I
[1:42:08] lived according to the word they had
[1:42:10] Sanctified lives but yet they did not
[1:42:12] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:42:14] but they could have a cleaned up life
[1:42:16] and they could be sinless under that
[1:42:17] blood but yet they could not approach
[1:42:19] the presence of God they could not be
[1:42:20] the dwelling place of God the best thing
[1:42:22] they could have would be an anointing on
[1:42:24] them that could come and go based on
[1:42:26] their actions
[1:42:27] but they couldn't have something that
[1:42:28] was with them all the time they were
[1:42:30] anointed and listened Church they did
[1:42:32] amazing things with that anointing
[1:42:35] they did Supernatural things under that
[1:42:37] anointing Joshua stopped the Sun and the
[1:42:39] Moon
[1:42:40] and yet he did not have the Holy Ghost
[1:42:41] Inside of him
[1:42:43] shamgar killed 600 Philistines look at
[1:42:45] what David did as a young man killed a
[1:42:47] giant
[1:42:48] under an anointing but yet not having
[1:42:50] the holy spirit in himself
[1:42:54] they all look towards what we were to
[1:42:56] what we would have and the scripture
[1:42:58] says that without us they can't even be
[1:43:00] made perfect everything they were
[1:43:01] looking for was something that was down
[1:43:03] the road and we get to get it
[1:43:05] but I want to close the script this this
[1:43:07] service on a scripture and a quote here
[1:43:08] and they're they're both prayers one's
[1:43:10] by David and one's by Brother Branham
[1:43:12] and we've got Camp next week and I just
[1:43:14] wanted to kind of set a tone as we start
[1:43:16] to close us down this this morning
[1:43:19] because I believe this is our hearts cry
[1:43:20] each one
[1:43:22] David would say this in Psalms 139
[1:43:24] search me o God
[1:43:27] try me
[1:43:28] and know my thoughts
[1:43:30] and see if there be any wicked way in me
[1:43:34] and Lead Me in the way Everlasting
[1:43:38] brother Graham says we want to be led by
[1:43:40] your holy son Jesus Christ to eternal
[1:43:42] life
[1:43:44] this is 14 sorry this is
[1:43:47] 18 17 days before he dies
[1:43:50] I got those numbers wrong last time he
[1:43:52] didn't die in the 25th he died on the
[1:43:53] 24th
[1:43:55] so he's 17 days 1207 17 days before he
[1:43:59] dies he says we want to be led by your
[1:44:01] holy son Jesus Christ to her eternal
[1:44:03] life give it to our hearts tonight Lord
[1:44:06] tear out the old Stony heart place into
[1:44:09] us the new heart the heart of Flesh the
[1:44:12] heart that you can talk to and deal with
[1:44:14] and we will not be haughty or different
[1:44:18] he says may the Holy Spirit never leave
[1:44:20] Lord may it come and ordain this people
[1:44:24] oh I thought only ministers could be
[1:44:26] ordained your priests and kings
[1:44:30] he says ordain this people speak to them
[1:44:32] tear up their Stony wills and put in the
[1:44:36] will of God
[1:44:37] save everyone father give us of thy love
[1:44:40] get us to a place Lord that will get
[1:44:43] away from all the emotional part
[1:44:46] not without emotion but to get past the
[1:44:49] emotion to the real solid part of the
[1:44:52] feeling
[1:44:52] the heartfelt part the deepness of the
[1:44:56] spirit The Riches of God the kingdom of
[1:44:59] the spirit in our hearts he says granted
[1:45:02] o great leader great holy spirit before
[1:45:05] you take your flight into the skies with
[1:45:08] your church
[1:45:09] amen God bless you let's stand together
[1:45:10] if we would
[1:45:12] amen is that our hearts cry this morning
[1:45:15] I said before even when you get the Holy
[1:45:17] Ghost there's still a sanctification
[1:45:19] that continues
[1:45:20] there's an ongoing work there's
[1:45:22] something that he's always working with
[1:45:23] in our lives amen
[1:45:25] and the greatest sign that we've gotten
[1:45:27] cold is that we stop asking for change
[1:45:30] we stop asking to be like the word we
[1:45:32] stop asking for deliverance we stop
[1:45:33] asking for power we stop asking for God
[1:45:36] to move in our lives in the way that he
[1:45:37] has in the past
[1:45:39] when we're so settled that nothing is
[1:45:41] moving
[1:45:42] that's when we've gotten cold that's
[1:45:43] when we've gotten starchy that's when
[1:45:45] we've gotten formal
[1:45:47] but when we had that cry in our hearts
[1:45:49] that says Lord
[1:45:50] I want more
[1:45:52] Lord I need more
[1:45:54] Lord the challenge is rising in front of
[1:45:56] me
[1:45:57] my family is rising in front of me
[1:46:01] I need more
[1:46:02] to meet the challenge of this day
[1:46:05] I need an assurance
[1:46:09] your brother Brown says he says when you
[1:46:10] pray you've got to have a token
[1:46:13] you've got to have something that you
[1:46:15] say you gave me this
[1:46:18] you gave me this so I could meet my
[1:46:20] needs
[1:46:21] not so I could run around and play
[1:46:23] church not so I could run around and
[1:46:24] pretend I'm a manifested Son of God but
[1:46:26] you gave me a token so that I could come
[1:46:29] before your throne of grace so that I
[1:46:31] could go to the bank of heaven and say I
[1:46:34] have a need
[1:46:36] and that's why we need that Holy Ghost
[1:46:37] is because that is the security the
[1:46:39] assurance that our prayers are heard
[1:46:42] because why he says when you ask it in
[1:46:44] my name
[1:46:45] he says I'll give it to you
[1:46:48] you've got to have a token for your
[1:46:49] Assurance you've got to have a settled
[1:46:51] feeling in your heart
[1:46:53] unknowing that he's finished it
[1:46:57] he sealed it
[1:46:58] and everything is settled
[1:47:00] then he says you ask what you will
[1:47:03] and I'll give it to you whatever you ask
[1:47:05] in my name I'll give it to you then John
[1:47:08] would say whatever we ask according to
[1:47:09] his will
[1:47:10] he'll give it to us that takes a token
[1:47:14] that takes something in the control
[1:47:15] tower
[1:47:17] rather than just a new spirit and a new
[1:47:19] heart
[1:47:20] but it takes the word in flesh once
[1:47:22] again
[1:47:23] not just in Christ
[1:47:25] not just in a prophet but in Sons and
[1:47:28] Daughters of God that have been filled
[1:47:30] with the spirit and sealed to the day of
[1:47:32] their Redemption amen
[1:47:34] hey man let's bow our heads each one
[1:47:35] Heavenly Father
[1:47:38] Lord surely we have need of you
[1:47:44] Lord we've been blessed
[1:47:48] by your goodness by Your Grace by your
[1:47:49] forgiveness
[1:47:52] Lord by a finished work at Calvary
[1:47:54] but Lord that was the starting place to
[1:47:56] the redeeming
[1:47:58] Lord in the adopting of Sons and
[1:47:59] Daughters of God
[1:48:01] and Lord there's something in us that's
[1:48:03] crying out Abba Father
[1:48:05] Lord there's something in us that says
[1:48:07] there's more
[1:48:08] or there's something in us that says
[1:48:11] I've got to die
[1:48:14] so you can live
[1:48:16] Lord I pray you keep us humble
[1:48:19] Lord but in that humility Lord may we
[1:48:21] have great expectation
[1:48:23] or for the work and will of your word in
[1:48:25] our lives nor for the leadership and
[1:48:27] guidance of the Holy Spirit Heavenly
[1:48:29] Father
[1:48:31] Lord may we seek you with all of our
[1:48:32] hearts and all of our souls
[1:48:34] Lord because the scripture says when
[1:48:36] we'll seek you we'll find you when we'll
[1:48:38] knock you open
[1:48:40] Lord and what we have need of will be
[1:48:41] given to us
[1:48:43] Lord what we have need of today is more
[1:48:45] of you
[1:48:46] to offer a deeper relationship
[1:48:49] Lord where we can have the emotion
[1:48:52] and we can have the Dynamics of that
[1:48:54] emotion Heavenly Father
[1:48:56] Lord fill us a new with your life we
[1:48:57] pray
[1:48:58] Lord bless your people we ask
[1:49:01] in Jesus name
[1:49:03] amen
[1:49:04] do we know that song touch your people
[1:49:05] once again
[1:49:07] I don't have it down brother Rachel that
[1:49:09] one just came to me there touch your
[1:49:11] people once again
[1:49:15] touch your people world once again
[1:49:22] with your precious
[1:49:26] Holy Hand of course
[1:49:30] let your kingdom shine
[1:49:34] upon this Earth
[1:49:38] through a living
[1:49:41] glorious Church
[1:49:46] not for temporary
[1:49:53] but to restore

[2:08:07] no matter what we do how we struggle how
[2:08:09] we fight Lord
[2:08:11] it was in your hands all along Lord
[2:08:15] and the true Revelation comes father God
[2:08:17] when we can truly set ourselves aside
[2:08:20] and believe that
[2:08:23] one of the hardest things is it's fairly
[2:08:26] easy to believe for others Lord but
[2:08:28] sometimes to accept healing in these
[2:08:30] things for ourselves
