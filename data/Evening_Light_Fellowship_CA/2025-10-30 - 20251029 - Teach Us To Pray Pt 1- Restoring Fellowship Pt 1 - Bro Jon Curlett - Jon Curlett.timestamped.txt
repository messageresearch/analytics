[34:31] out in the afternoon. They they didn't
[34:33] really exist. I wouldn't have been able
[34:34] to preach no matter which time I left.
[34:37] And uh so I I've got to leave first
[34:39] thing in the morning. So brother Mark
[34:40] will take the Sunday morning service and
[34:42] then brother Garfield will take the
[34:43] Wednesday uh evening service. So
[34:45] remember them in prayer that God would
[34:47] just make them a blessing. Just help
[34:49] them settle in and that he would speak
[34:51] to his people. Amen. We want to remember
[34:53] I think brother Joe mentioned it but the
[34:55] saints in Jamaica just uh they went
[34:57] through the worst storm in their
[34:58] history. Uh we got a an update from
[35:01] brother Keith Reid this morning and he
[35:04] said that the the electricity is out
[35:06] pretty much across the entire island. Um
[35:08] they've got some property and damage and
[35:11] livestock challenges. Most of the trees
[35:13] are down across the entire island, but
[35:15] everyone is safe. So we praise the Lord
[35:17] for that. When you uh when you hit land
[35:19] at 185 miles an hour, people usually
[35:22] die. But uh by God's grace, they've been
[35:24] preserved. So we thank the Lord for
[35:26] that. They've got a lot of work ahead of
[35:27] them, a lot of hard days ahead of them.
[35:29] and we just trust the Lord will grant
[35:31] them grace there. I'm not sure if
[35:33] they'll be a way for us to maybe help
[35:34] them. We'll see what happens as things
[35:36] kind of unfold and and kind of come back
[35:38] into some semblance of order. So, we
[35:40] want to remember them especially
[35:42] tonight. Amen. Psalms chapter 66,
[35:46] just a short scripture tonight. David
[35:48] says this, "Blessed be God which had not
[35:51] turned away my prayer nor his mercy from
[35:54] me." Amen. God bless you. You can have
[35:56] your seats. And we're starting a new
[35:58] series tonight. You can hold the
[36:00] applause. Amen. But we're going to
[36:02] primarily do this on the Wednesday
[36:04] nights as far as I can tell. And on
[36:06] Sundays, we'll probably do the other
[36:08] series that the Lord has laid on my
[36:10] heart. And that allows those that only
[36:11] make it to Sundays to get every bar,
[36:13] every bit of that series. And and then
[36:15] the rest of
[36:20] we're going to do one series on
[36:22] Wednesdays and we'll do another series
[36:23] on Sundays. and I'm not bound by chains
[36:26] in those things. We'll follow the Lord's
[36:28] leading however he would do it. But
[36:29] that's my intention is to is to do this
[36:32] series primarily on Wednesdays. We want
[36:33] to do a series on prayer. And uh just a
[36:37] I I listed 10 or 11 questions in here
[36:39] that will kind of come up along the way.
[36:41] And some of these have been asked to me
[36:42] and some of them have been brought up
[36:44] just people don't ask them but by their
[36:46] actions or by their statements that they
[36:48] make then we know that these are
[36:49] questions we need to answer. Questions
[36:51] like what is prayer? That that seems
[36:53] like maybe a a silly question, but what
[36:55] is prayer? Why do we pray at all? How do
[36:58] we pray?
[37:00] What's the goal or purpose of prayer?
[37:04] Why do we pray if God has already
[37:06] determined what's going to happen? If
[37:09] that's the case, then do my prayers even
[37:10] matter at all? What happens if I pray
[37:13] contrary to God's will?
[37:16] Does God only do certain things if we
[37:18] pray?
[37:20] Do we have to pray to receive certain
[37:22] things from God? How do we know how to
[37:26] pray about situations?
[37:29] What makes God listen to my prayer?
[37:32] Anybody want God to listen to your
[37:33] prayer? I'll tell you this. We want an
[37:36] answer, but do we want him to listen?
[37:38] That's a that's something we'll get into
[37:40] as we go. And what makes God act on my
[37:42] behalf on my prayer? So, we're going to
[37:45] get into these different things. And you
[37:46] know, sometimes we just think that
[37:48] prayer is well, we just get down and we
[37:49] say something to God and then he does
[37:50] something or he doesn't do something.
[37:52] But prayer is so much more than that.
[37:53] There's so much more depth to it. And
[37:55] really, we're going to try and set a
[37:57] foundation tonight. And I'll tell you
[37:59] this, this is meant to be mostly
[38:01] teaching certainly, but there's going to
[38:02] be some preaching because I'll tell you
[38:04] this, if you don't have a strong prayer
[38:06] life, you're going to struggle as a
[38:08] Christian. Absolutely. Amen. We have to
[38:10] have a real prayer life. It's absolutely
[38:12] essential to a Christian. And you can
[38:14] read your Bible until you're blue in the
[38:16] face. But if you cannot talk to the
[38:18] author, if you do not have a personal
[38:20] relationship with the author, you're
[38:22] going to struggle in your life until you
[38:24] come to a place where you have a real
[38:25] prayer life and where it's a priority in
[38:27] your life. And by that, I I don't mean
[38:29] that you say a prayer every day. I mean
[38:32] that you pray every day. That you
[38:35] commune with God every day. And that
[38:37] we're honest and we're sincere when we
[38:39] do those things. Amen. Because if
[38:41] there's one person you can't fool,
[38:42] church, it's God. If I go in and I'm
[38:44] trying to tell God what I think he wants
[38:46] to hear, what I think I'm supposed to
[38:48] say, that is not what God receives. What
[38:50] God receives is a sincere and honest
[38:52] heart before him. Amen. And so we we
[38:55] won't get very far with him if we're
[38:56] trying to do it by form or by by by
[38:59] tradition or something like that. So I
[39:01] want to just take a simple series uh
[39:04] title called Teach Us to Pray here
[39:06] tonight. And I'm going to start tonight
[39:07] with a a subtitle of restoring
[39:10] fellowship. And my hope, don't hold me
[39:12] to this, my hope is to try and take this
[39:15] in little bite-sized chunks for the
[39:17] Wednesday night so that I don't tire you
[39:19] out too much. And I know sometimes I
[39:20] keep you late on Wednesdays and and I
[39:22] can honestly say it's never my intention
[39:24] to go long on a Wednesday. I know we're
[39:26] often tired and kids have school and we
[39:28] got to get up in the morning. But my
[39:30] intention is to just try and keep it
[39:32] tidy and concise, but sometimes a
[39:33] preacher's got to preach and we trust
[39:35] the Lord is leading in those things.
[39:37] Amen. So, I want to preach tonight on
[39:39] restoring fellowship. But I want to take
[39:41] us back to the beginning to set a
[39:42] foundation. If you've heard me preach at
[39:44] all, you know that when I start
[39:45] something, I like to take us to the
[39:46] beginning because if we can see what it
[39:48] is in the beginning, we can see what
[39:50] it's supposed to be when God does a
[39:51] restoring work in our lives. Amen. And
[39:54] so when we go back to the beginning, we
[39:56] see how it was in Genesis. And we're
[39:58] talking about restoring fellowship here
[39:59] tonight. And it says, "And they heard
[40:01] the voice of the Lord God walking in the
[40:03] garden in the cool of the day. And Adam
[40:06] and his wife hid themselves from the
[40:08] presence of the Lord God amongst the
[40:10] trees of the garden." Now remember in
[40:12] the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve as as
[40:15] perfect beings without sin had three
[40:17] major benefits or attributes because of
[40:20] their condition. Amen. They had one
[40:21] thing and that was primary in their life
[40:23] and that was fellowship with God. They
[40:25] had unfettered
[40:27] access to Christ. Amen. With no
[40:29] boundaries or no limits to it. The
[40:32] second thing they had was eternal life.
[40:33] They were sinless children of God,
[40:36] perfect in God's eyes, made in God's
[40:37] image, and holding his own eternal life
[40:40] inside of them. And then the third thing
[40:41] they had was dominion over the over the
[40:44] earth. They had total control over their
[40:46] environment. Okay? So they have
[40:48] fellowship with God. They had eternal
[40:50] life. and they had dominion over the
[40:51] earth. And remember what God said. He
[40:53] says, "I'm going to make man in my
[40:54] image." And so what we saw in the
[40:56] beginning was people that were perfectly
[40:59] reflecting God in their environment.
[41:01] Amen. God was a master over everything
[41:04] he made. And he put man into his own
[41:06] domain. And he was to be God within that
[41:09] domain. Not a God to be worshiped, but
[41:11] he was to be a God that had dominion and
[41:14] full control over the environment of the
[41:16] earth. And so Adam was that perfect
[41:17] expression of God. And so when God
[41:19] placed Adam on this earth, Adam was to
[41:22] be on the earth as God was to the entire
[41:24] universe. He was supposed to have full
[41:26] dominion, full control. He was the head.
[41:29] He was the apex. He was the top dog.
[41:31] Whatever you might want to say, we are
[41:33] meant to have total control over our
[41:35] dominion. So God placed us on earth just
[41:38] to be like him. It was built for our
[41:40] pleasure. It was built for our benefit.
[41:43] It was supposed to be something that
[41:45] that had value to us, that gave us
[41:47] meaning for our lives. And so God wanted
[41:49] us to be just like him in our lives, in
[41:51] our expression, in the way we spent our
[41:54] time. And God knew that when we sinned,
[41:57] we would lose that. And so God built
[41:59] into all of this, a redeeming work to
[42:01] get us back into relationship with him.
[42:04] Amen. To give us back relationship with
[42:06] him, fellowship with him, eternal life
[42:08] and dominion. But I want you to see
[42:10] something because when we look at the
[42:12] fall, and that's really where we're
[42:13] going to start tonight, we see that
[42:15] eternal life and dominion relied on
[42:18] fellowship.
[42:20] Remember what was the tree of life? Who
[42:24] was the tree of life? It was Christ.
[42:27] Everything flowed from Christ. When they
[42:29] lost access to the tree of life, they
[42:31] lost eternal life. And with eternal life
[42:33] went dominion. They were no longer gods.
[42:36] They were just humans. There was nothing
[42:38] there. Amen. Why? Because Christ was the
[42:40] tree of life. And when you lose Christ,
[42:42] everything that he offers you goes with
[42:43] them. And so they were left to their own
[42:46] means and their own ends. And I want I I
[42:49] read this scripture here in Genesis 3:8
[42:50] to show us what God normally did and
[42:54] then how Adam and Eve reacted to it.
[42:56] Amen. Because each day, remember, in the
[42:58] cool of the evening, Christ would come
[43:00] down and he would walk in the garden and
[43:01] he would bring, he didn't even have to
[43:03] call Adam and Eve to him. They would
[43:05] come to him willingly of their own free
[43:06] will, of their own desire, and they
[43:09] would be so happy to see him. And it was
[43:11] such a peaceful and loving time. And
[43:13] they would walk together with him, and
[43:14] they would talk together with him, and
[43:16] he would share things with them, and
[43:17] they would share things with him. And
[43:18] brother Brown would say, "At the end of
[43:20] the day, then he would lay them down
[43:21] under the tree on his lap, and he would
[43:23] put them to sleep." So all was perfect
[43:26] rest, and it was a time of perfect and
[43:29] direct fellowship. But what broke down
[43:32] the fellowship?
[43:34] This is key to our service this evening.
[43:36] What broke down fellowship? What is it
[43:38] that separated them from God? It was
[43:41] disobedience to the word. That's the
[43:43] thing that pushed them apart. Remember,
[43:45] we see here Christ is walking in the
[43:47] trees of the garden in the cool of the
[43:49] day. And let me ask you this, who broke
[43:52] the fellowship?
[43:55] Did Christ break the fellowship,
[43:57] church? He was where he always was doing
[44:00] what he always did. Who broke the
[44:01] fellowship? Humanity broke the
[44:04] fellowship. Adam and Eve broke the
[44:06] fellowship. It was mankind that hid. It
[44:08] was mankind that refused to show up. It
[44:10] was mankind that was ashamed. It was
[44:12] mankind whose conscience was bothering
[44:14] them. And so they pulled back and God
[44:17] was there trying to draw them into
[44:18] fellowship, but they had separated
[44:20] themselves from him. Church, that ought
[44:23] to be a consolation for us tonight. God
[44:26] is always fighting for fellowship. God
[44:28] is always desiring fellowship, but it's
[44:31] us that tends to pull back, not him.
[44:34] Amen. It's us that tends to to to let
[44:36] these things go. God never stops wanting
[44:38] it. God never stops desiring it. God
[44:41] never stops trying to make a way for us
[44:43] to come back to fellowship. Amen. But
[44:45] it's us that come and go. It's us that
[44:47] get hot and cold. It's us that have zeal
[44:49] and then we go into a backsliding
[44:51] condition. It's us that pulls away. And
[44:53] he's always staying right there looking
[44:55] for fellowship with his children. He's
[44:57] always there to do it. Amen. Church, if
[44:59] you've stopped talking to God, it's not
[45:00] cuz he's left.
[45:03] It's because what? You've walked away or
[45:06] you're in disobedience and you refuse to
[45:08] come out of that disobedience.
[45:11] Today, that's the way it would be.
[45:12] You've walked away. He has not walked
[45:14] away because he's always in the same
[45:16] place. He's always walking with the
[45:18] word. We have to walk away from him to
[45:20] separate our fellowship away from him.
[45:22] Amen. So, what broke that fellowship
[45:24] with God? It was disobedience to the
[45:27] word of God. It was the actions of Adam
[45:29] and Eve. It was a mistake by Eve. She
[45:31] thought she was doing the right thing.
[45:32] It was intentional by Adam for the love
[45:34] of his wife. But what it doesn't matter
[45:36] really who did what. What matters is
[45:38] that they disobeyed the word. And that
[45:40] did a work inside them. Church, they
[45:42] broke the word. But something broke
[45:44] inside of them when they did that. They
[45:47] went from being happy to see Christ, of
[45:49] wanting to see Christ, of loving to
[45:51] seeing Christ, to drawing back because
[45:53] something in them had changed. And all
[45:55] of a sudden, they knew they were not the
[45:57] way they were before. They pulled back
[46:00] from it. Amen. They went from being so
[46:02] happy to being ashamed of themselves.
[46:05] And they didn't want to be in his
[46:06] presence. We know that God would draw
[46:08] them back in and he would he would tell
[46:10] them what had to happen because of this.
[46:12] And he would say to Adam, "Adam, because
[46:14] you've done this, you're going to fight
[46:16] the earth and it's going to push back
[46:17] and you're going to live by the sweat of
[46:19] your brow and the earth's not going to
[46:21] be cooperative and you're going to have
[46:22] to fight every day to live." And then he
[46:24] said to Eve, because you've done this,
[46:26] your desire is going to be to your
[46:27] husband, and you'll be under his
[46:29] headship, and your desire will be before
[46:31] him, and you'll have pain complicated,
[46:34] you know, uh, multiplied in your
[46:35] conception, these different things. And
[46:38] so God, they when they lost their
[46:40] fellowship with God, he turned them to
[46:42] an imperfect fellowship. He turned them
[46:44] to imperfect relationship because of it.
[46:47] And now the man was tied to the woman as
[46:49] a protector and as a provider. And the
[46:51] woman's tied to the man now for headship
[46:54] and preservation of life. Amen. But
[46:56] that's not the way it was meant to be.
[46:57] If that fellowship was broken and they
[47:00] lost it with the one that mattered most.
[47:02] Brother Brandham would say this and he's
[47:03] speaking of Adam in the garden. He says,
[47:05] "Now notice him in his glory back there
[47:08] when he had sinned. God felt so sorry
[47:10] for the poor fellow. See him and Eve
[47:13] going away, going out of the fellowship.
[47:16] They would have to shift for
[47:18] themselves." He says, "What could they
[47:20] do?" They had a loving father who would
[47:23] take care of them, but now through
[47:24] disobedience cut off all fellowship. He
[47:28] says, "No more fellowship." They had to
[47:31] make it for themselves. church. This is
[47:34] the human condition. Without fellowship
[47:36] with God, you're on your own. And look
[47:39] what he calls him. The poor fellow
[47:42] having to shift for themselves. He says,
[47:44] had to till the soil and earn the living
[47:46] by the sweat of their brow. They had to
[47:48] get sick and die in all kinds of
[47:50] troubles and heartaches and
[47:52] disappointments. Why? He says severed
[47:55] fellowship. He says no more fellowship
[47:58] with God. It couldn't be.
[48:01] church. If you're struggling, what's the
[48:03] answer? Get back into fellowship.
[48:07] If you're struggling with the way things
[48:09] are going in your life, what's the
[48:10] answer? Get back into fellowship. Cuz
[48:12] that's what caused the whole thing in
[48:14] the first place was severed fellowship
[48:16] by disobedience to the word. And so, we
[48:18] can see here that fellowship with God is
[48:21] on the basis of the word of God. It's
[48:23] through the word of God. Now, that might
[48:26] seem obvious to you and I because we're
[48:28] well taught by God's grace. But there
[48:30] are billions of people today that are
[48:33] claiming to have fellowship and
[48:35] relationship with Christ. And they can't
[48:38] tell you the word that has corrected
[48:40] them lately. They can't show you the
[48:42] word that's living in their life. Amen.
[48:45] They can't tell you how the word applies
[48:46] to their daily life. And yet, they'll
[48:48] sit there and say, "But I have
[48:49] fellowship with Jesus Christ all day
[48:51] long." But that's impossible. It's
[48:54] impossible to have a relationship with
[48:56] the God and deny the very word that he
[48:58] gave us. Amen. They claim the blood of
[49:00] Jesus, but they refuse the word of
[49:02] Jesus. Amen. That's a big problem
[49:05] because that's not how God works. God's
[49:07] fellowship is always through his word,
[49:10] not through works. It's always through
[49:13] his word. Amen. They've got a
[49:15] relationship now with a God of their own
[49:16] making, and they're completely fooled.
[49:18] And so, they're worshiping someone other
[49:20] than Christ. That's what the scripture
[49:22] says. Amen. But in the garden of Eden in
[49:25] Genesis 4 where we read that God slew an
[49:28] animal for the sins of Adam and Eve. And
[49:30] we see there that the word and the blood
[49:32] get tied together. That's what happens
[49:35] there. Amen. Why? Because God would
[49:37] always cover our sins so that he could
[49:40] bless us with his word. But he had to
[49:42] find a way to to to cover the
[49:44] transgression so he could give us the
[49:46] blessings. And the way to do it was by
[49:49] shed blood. God's intention was always
[49:51] to preserve life.
[49:53] God values life. God wants to save
[49:57] people. God wants to preserve people.
[49:59] Amen. But after the fall of in the
[50:01] garden, God moved fully into a plan of
[50:03] redemption to restore us back to our
[50:06] original condition. And how did he do
[50:07] it? By the blood of the lamb and the
[50:10] word of God. The two of them are tied
[50:13] together. Remember, you always had to
[50:15] come under the shed blood. But let's
[50:17] look at First John chapter 1. It says
[50:18] this. This then is the message which we
[50:21] have heard of him and declare unto you
[50:23] that God is light and in him is no
[50:25] darkness at all. And if we say that we
[50:28] have fellowship with him and walk in
[50:31] darkness, we lie and do not the truth.
[50:33] So you can't say I'm in fellowship or
[50:35] I'm in relationship with God and then
[50:38] live in darkness.
[50:40] The two are incompatible because God is
[50:43] light. And if you have God in your life,
[50:45] then there has to be light there.
[50:46] Darkness has to vanish. Amen. We're
[50:48] talking about habitual life now. We're
[50:51] not talking about mistakes. We all have
[50:53] our moments throughout our day and our
[50:55] week where we do things we ought not to
[50:56] do. But our habitual life is in light
[50:59] because we're walking according to the
[51:00] word. Okay? We have fellowship with God
[51:03] and we keep coming back to that light if
[51:05] we happen to to step away from it
[51:07] momentarily. But he says, "But if we
[51:09] walk in the light as he is in the light,
[51:12] we have fellowship one with another. We
[51:15] have fellowship with Christ and we have
[51:16] fellowship with each other. It's all
[51:18] tied together. Amen. It's one big body.
[51:21] He says, "And the blood of Jesus Christ,
[51:23] his son, cleanses us from all sin." Now,
[51:27] we take this over to Psalm 119, and it
[51:29] says, "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet
[51:32] and a light unto my path." Amen. In
[51:34] other words, th the word is with me so
[51:37] that I can walk right, so that I can
[51:38] live right, so that I can see where I'm
[51:40] supposed to be going. So, the word is
[51:43] the light of God. And so if we take that
[51:45] and we transpose it back into first John
[51:48] 1, we say if we walk in the word as he
[51:52] is in the word, we have fellowship one
[51:54] with another. And the blood of Jesus
[51:56] Christ his son cleanses us from all
[51:59] sins. So the purpose of the blood is to
[52:01] cover our sins so we can come back into
[52:04] fellowship. And that fellowship is
[52:06] through the word of God. Does that make
[52:09] sense this evening? The blood restores
[52:11] us to fellowship through the word.
[52:14] That's the requirement of it. The basis
[52:16] of fellowship is God's word because
[52:18] that's how he reveals himself.
[52:21] That's how he shows himself to us. You
[52:22] can't love God and hate his word. And
[52:24] you can't know God unless you know his
[52:26] word. You can see him in nature. You can
[52:29] see him in the laws of nature. You can
[52:31] see him in the beauty of nature and
[52:32] these things. But to truly understand
[52:34] him, you need his word. The other things
[52:36] reflect, but the word really reveals.
[52:38] Amen. and and it gives us some way for
[52:40] us to potentially understand with him
[52:43] and connect with him. Now, Burban would
[52:45] say this. He says, "And today, men who
[52:47] refuse to walk in the light of Christ,
[52:50] not refuse the sacrifice of Calvary, but
[52:53] what? Refuse the light of the word,
[52:55] which is Christ himself." So today, men
[52:58] who refuse to walk in the light of
[53:00] Christ, you have spurned mercy. So
[53:02] there's nothing left but judgment.
[53:06] That's what they had in Eden
[53:10] but for the blood of Christ.
[53:13] Judgment. That's all that was left. Now
[53:15] listen to this. He says there's
[53:17] something beyond the veil yonder that
[53:20] pulls the Christian. He can't explain
[53:22] it. He doesn't understand it himself.
[53:24] But there's something in that fellowship
[53:26] that he has with Christ. He says sever
[53:29] him from there. He becomes a wanderer.
[53:34] You're looking and you're looking. I'm
[53:35] reminded of Brother Barry Coffee going
[53:37] around the world looking for truth,
[53:39] looking for meaning. And what was it? It
[53:41] was here all the time. If only he was a
[53:44] little more like brother Mark.
[53:48] But some people, they are prone to
[53:50] wander
[53:51] and some people find it right away. But
[53:53] I'll tell you this, as a child of God,
[53:55] you're always searching until there's a
[53:56] satisfaction that comes into your soul.
[53:58] And that's only met through
[54:00] relationship, through fellowship with
[54:02] Jesus Christ.
[54:03] Now we know God made a provision right
[54:05] there that day for all humanity. And his
[54:08] provision was to take the life of an
[54:09] innocent and dues it to to cover the
[54:13] blood of that innocent would cover the
[54:15] sins of the guilty. It was a life for
[54:17] the life. And we saw that when God made
[54:20] made clothes for Adam and Eve, it was
[54:22] the clothes of the animal he had killed
[54:24] in theirstead. That's an extreme event.
[54:28] You talk about extreme. They went from
[54:30] perfect life and peace and joy to death
[54:36] just like that. But God knew what was
[54:39] coming and God had made a provision for
[54:41] it. But they went from perfection to
[54:44] blood covered in a day in a moment.
[54:47] Amen. Church, that shows how seriously
[54:49] God takes his word. But it also shows
[54:52] how seriously he takes fellowship with
[54:54] his bride, with his people, with his
[54:56] children. Amen. church. Why was God so
[54:58] intent on this? You think about what
[55:00] happened that day. Why didn't God just
[55:03] wipe it all away? I mean, it was only
[55:06] two people.
[55:08] Why not just wipe it all off and start
[55:10] it all over again?
[55:12] That would be my inclination. We barely
[55:14] just got started.
[55:17] Why don't we just boot them out and
[55:19] we'll speak a new one into existence?
[55:21] We'll take Satan out of the equation so
[55:23] that we don't have this problem in the
[55:25] future and let's just start it clear and
[55:27] perfect.
[55:31] Why didn't God do it? One, God knew it
[55:34] was going to happen.
[55:36] God could have stopped it from the
[55:38] beginning, but he chose not to. Amen.
[55:40] And the prophet of God would tell us
[55:41] that God wanted to express his own
[55:43] attributes. He wanted to express his
[55:46] attribute of a savior, of a healer, of a
[55:48] liberator, of a conqueror, of a
[55:50] deliverer, of a provider, all these
[55:52] different things. But I want you to see
[55:54] that the word had been given. And when
[55:56] the word had been given, he couldn't go
[55:57] back on it.
[55:59] He had put the names in the lamb's book
[56:01] of life, but he'd also put a sentence of
[56:03] judgment for those that transgressed it.
[56:05] And so, he had to let it play out. He
[56:07] was bound by his own word to do it. And
[56:10] so, God came down. And hidden in that
[56:12] entire word was a work of redemption.
[56:15] And that was the great thing that God
[56:17] was trying to do. God was going to bring
[56:19] us all the way back to what we had in
[56:21] the Garden of Eden with Adam and Eve.
[56:23] And in that, he would produce a people
[56:25] with character that would not fall.
[56:29] That's what he's been trying to do.
[56:30] That's what he is going to do. That's
[56:32] what he is doing today. Is God is
[56:34] producing a bride that has his full
[56:37] character and nature. and he will work
[56:39] through those people in a redemptive
[56:41] work to restore them back to what they
[56:43] had in the very beginning. Listen to
[56:45] this quote. It's so beautiful for us
[56:47] believers. He says, "In order to
[56:49] restore," we're asking the question, why
[56:51] didn't God just wipe it off? In order to
[56:54] restore fellowship again, God made a
[56:56] provision right there in the garden. If
[56:58] there would have been any other
[56:59] provision better, God would have made
[57:01] it. But God made the only provision and
[57:04] the only basis of restoration to that
[57:07] blessed eternal fellowship was through
[57:09] the blood of an innocent victim.
[57:13] He says God made a way back to
[57:15] fellowship. That's the only basis God
[57:17] ever had or has now or ever will have.
[57:20] He says it makes me feel religious
[57:22] knowing that there is a way that there
[57:24] is a God provided way. church that out
[57:26] to give us confidence this evening is
[57:28] that if he makes a way, it works.
[57:31] Because God doesn't give us a way that
[57:32] leads us to failure, that leads us to
[57:34] disappointment, that leads us to a dead
[57:36] end. You ever driving down a road and
[57:38] you think you know where you're going
[57:40] and you end up in a dead end? Husbands,
[57:43] don't raise your hands.
[57:45] We do it sometimes. We think we know
[57:47] where we're going. We think we know the
[57:48] end and we get there and the ways
[57:50] thereof are the ways of death. That's
[57:52] what the scripture says. But when we
[57:54] follow God's way, it leads us to a
[57:56] certain end. It leads us to where he
[57:58] says it's going to go. That ought to
[58:00] make us feel religious. He says, he
[58:02] says, "And what may God provide this
[58:05] way?" Hallelujah. He says, "Because God
[58:08] is love, and love demands fellowship."
[58:13] Love demands fellowship. What a thought.
[58:15] Fellowship is not optional with God.
[58:18] Fellowship is not take it or leave it.
[58:21] or we have it today, we don't have it
[58:22] tomorrow. Who cares? No, he says love
[58:25] demands fellowship. Fellowship is a
[58:27] requirement of love. Amen. It's the
[58:30] expression of love, if I could put it
[58:32] that way. And so God is insistent on
[58:34] having fellowship with his family. Love
[58:38] does not exist without fellowship. Amen.
[58:40] They're part and parcel of each other.
[58:42] And so the very nature of God's love is
[58:44] that there has to be fellowship with his
[58:46] creation, with his children, with his
[58:49] family. That had to happen. God couldn't
[58:51] leave us on our own without a way back
[58:53] just on without a hope or without having
[58:55] the love of God in our lives. It wasn't
[58:57] enough for God to just say, "Well, I've
[58:59] got children on earth. I'm a father. I
[59:01] have a family." And then he would stand
[59:03] back and watch us battle and fight and
[59:05] and and shift on our own for the rest of
[59:06] our lives. That's not fellowship. That's
[59:09] not fatherhood.
[59:11] Fathers, we are not a father because
[59:13] we've brought children into this earth.
[59:15] We're a father because we've got
[59:17] fellowship with our children. That we're
[59:19] working with them day in and day out.
[59:21] That there's a relationship there and a
[59:23] on a on a daily thing that involves us
[59:25] in their life that connects us that
[59:28] causes a communion between us. Amen. So
[59:30] God wouldn't stand back in his love and
[59:32] let us battle this whole thing out
[59:34] ourselves. But he had to restore
[59:36] fellowship because it was a requirement
[59:38] of love. Amen. That's what he's trying
[59:40] to do. Works and knowledge and effort.
[59:43] That's all great, but it's not love.
[59:45] Amen. That's not the attribute of love.
[59:47] That love requires fellowship. And
[59:49] that's what God's working to restore is
[59:50] a closeness with his people. And how
[59:53] does he do it? By the shedding of blood.
[59:56] He says then upon the basis of the shed
[59:59] blood, Adam and Eve had a road back home
[1:00:01] again to fellowship with God.
[1:00:05] That's the first thing. That's the
[1:00:06] biggest thing. That's the greatest thing
[1:00:08] we could have is a fellowship with God.
[1:00:10] He says it was used all down through the
[1:00:12] ages. all down through every age it was
[1:00:14] used. He says the book of Job's the
[1:00:16] oldest book in the Bible. But Job now
[1:00:18] the only way that he had to come to God
[1:00:20] for fellowship was through the shed
[1:00:22] blood of the lamb and a burnt offering.
[1:00:25] You know, we think about what happened
[1:00:27] after the the fall in the Garden of
[1:00:29] Eden. Did Adam and Eve have perfect
[1:00:31] fellowship with God after that?
[1:00:34] Did they have constant access to God?
[1:00:38] Could
[1:00:40] they just have a chat with God anytime
[1:00:41] they wanted? No, they couldn't. Why?
[1:00:45] Because they could not go to him. He had
[1:00:48] to come to them. It was on his sovereign
[1:00:51] will. It was on his sovereign grace, not
[1:00:53] on their own. They had to wait on him.
[1:00:56] They could not do it of their own will.
[1:00:58] So fellowship was now on the basis of
[1:01:01] him, not on us.
[1:01:04] Amen.
[1:01:06] There was a wall there that they
[1:01:07] couldn't go through. They didn't have
[1:01:09] access to the tree of life anymore. They
[1:01:11] couldn't just walk up to that. Amen. He
[1:01:13] had to come back to them. And why was
[1:01:15] that, church? Because their sins were
[1:01:17] covered, not erased. That was the
[1:01:20] barrier that was between God and man was
[1:01:22] that sin barrier. Amen. That book of
[1:01:24] remembrance was covered in right letter,
[1:01:26] red letters of all of our misdeeds, of
[1:01:28] all of our sins, of all of our unbelief,
[1:01:29] of all of our faults and failures. And
[1:01:31] they couldn't have fellowship if they
[1:01:34] tried. They couldn't have perfect
[1:01:35] fellowship. One, God couldn't come down
[1:01:37] in perfect fellowship, church. But even
[1:01:40] we wouldn't be accepting of perfect
[1:01:42] fellowship because our own conscience
[1:01:43] wouldn't allow us to come into it. We
[1:01:46] have our own holdups. We have our own
[1:01:48] our our things in our our life and our
[1:01:50] mind that hold us back, our complexes
[1:01:52] and these different things because
[1:01:54] remember what separated them from God in
[1:01:56] the first place was them, their acts,
[1:01:59] their conscience, their issues. It was a
[1:02:02] guilty conscience that held Adam and Eve
[1:02:04] back. It wasn't God judging them. It was
[1:02:07] them judging themselves. It was
[1:02:08] something internal to them that pulled
[1:02:10] them back. Amen. So, the conscience that
[1:02:13] held them back was the greatest barrier
[1:02:14] that they had.
[1:02:17] They're under condemnation. They're
[1:02:18] under that cloud of guilt, sorrowful,
[1:02:21] ashamed, worried about what he was going
[1:02:23] to say, unsure of what was going to
[1:02:24] happen. Search, let me say it this way.
[1:02:27] Until your conscience is fixed, you
[1:02:29] won't come into true fellowship.
[1:02:32] You won't because you know what you're
[1:02:33] dealing with when you come into the
[1:02:35] presence of almighty God. And you cannot
[1:02:37] stand in his presence condemned.
[1:02:40] You don't want to come into his presence
[1:02:41] condemned. And if there's something
[1:02:43] that's bothering you, you don't want to
[1:02:45] come in there because you know he knows
[1:02:48] and you're unwilling to go into his
[1:02:50] presence. Amen. God might be willing,
[1:02:52] but you won't.
[1:02:56] That's why we fight coming up for prayer
[1:02:58] and coming to the altar so many times.
[1:03:01] is we think we're unworthy. And let me
[1:03:04] tell you, church, we're unworthy.
[1:03:06] But that can't be the barrier. Amen.
[1:03:09] That can't be the barrier. Not in this
[1:03:10] day and age. Amen. But you can't
[1:03:12] approach God if you're uncertain of
[1:03:14] where you stand with him. Amen. You
[1:03:16] won't bow your head in prayer if you
[1:03:17] feel like you're unworthy. If you feel
[1:03:19] you're guilty, you're not going to go to
[1:03:21] God unless you know he'll receive you.
[1:03:24] And usually the problems are up here.
[1:03:25] The complexes are up here. They're in
[1:03:27] our hearts and in our minds, not on
[1:03:29] God's end. But that's the thing that
[1:03:31] holds us back. Remember what it says in
[1:03:33] Hebrews 10 because that conscience is
[1:03:36] what bothered people for so long. And he
[1:03:38] says, "For the law having a shadow of
[1:03:40] good things to come and not the very
[1:03:43] image of the things can never with those
[1:03:46] sacrifices which they offered year by
[1:03:48] year continually make the comers there
[1:03:50] unto perfect." People would come year
[1:03:52] after year and they give the sacrifices
[1:03:54] according to the law but it never
[1:03:56] perfected them.
[1:03:58] He says for then would they have not
[1:04:00] ceased to be offered because that the
[1:04:02] per worshippers once purged should have
[1:04:04] had no more conscience of sins. So in
[1:04:05] other words, if the blood of lambs and
[1:04:07] bulls and goats was truly effective,
[1:04:09] wouldn't their consciences have been
[1:04:11] clear? Wouldn't have they walked away
[1:04:12] free men and women and able to go into
[1:04:14] the presence of God? But they weren't.
[1:04:17] Why? Because the sins were only covered.
[1:04:20] They weren't erased. and our memory and
[1:04:22] our conscience would remember them time
[1:04:23] and time again. The debt was growing,
[1:04:26] but it was covered.
[1:04:28] But it's like if I was to put a blanket
[1:04:30] over this pew, over this pulpit, and
[1:04:32] then slowly stack books on top of it.
[1:04:34] You can't see what's underneath, but you
[1:04:36] know, it's getting bigger and bigger.
[1:04:37] And that's the way our sins were. And
[1:04:39] that's the way our conscience and memory
[1:04:40] was was we knew it was under the blood,
[1:04:42] but we knew it was still there. And
[1:04:44] someday we were going to have to answer
[1:04:45] for it. If God was just, if God was
[1:04:48] going to hold himself to his word, he
[1:04:51] says, "But in those sacrifices, there's
[1:04:53] a remembrance again made of sins." Every
[1:04:55] year, every year you went and you gave
[1:04:57] your sacrifices for your sins, and it
[1:05:00] reminded you that you were sinful. The
[1:05:02] very law of God, the very requirement of
[1:05:04] God reminded you that you weren't worthy
[1:05:06] to go into the presence of God, that you
[1:05:08] were flawed, that you have made mistakes
[1:05:11] that year, some of them big, some of
[1:05:12] them black, some of them dark, some of
[1:05:14] them more ashamed than others.
[1:05:17] And so, you know, every time you went to
[1:05:19] to plead the for the grace and mercy of
[1:05:22] God, it reminded you that you needed it
[1:05:25] and it reminded you that you weren't
[1:05:27] worthy and that you didn't have anything
[1:05:29] that was redeeming in your life. And he
[1:05:31] says this, for it's not possible that
[1:05:33] the blood of bulls and goats should take
[1:05:35] away sins. So, God did didn't just have
[1:05:39] to take care of sin, but he had to take
[1:05:41] care of the effect of sin. And that's
[1:05:44] what we're looking for. Amen. It had to
[1:05:45] be something that wouldn't just take
[1:05:47] away what I did, but it would take away
[1:05:48] the memory. It would take away the the
[1:05:50] burned conscience. It would take away
[1:05:51] the hurt. It would take away the
[1:05:53] complexes. It would take away the
[1:05:54] barriers that held me back from him, not
[1:05:57] just him back from us. Amen. And that
[1:05:59] was going to take more than a a precious
[1:06:01] little lamb or a precious little goat or
[1:06:03] a bull or something. And we saw that in
[1:06:05] type in the garden when he killed that
[1:06:07] animal that was there there for their
[1:06:10] sin. But it was pointing to a greater
[1:06:12] sacrifice that was going to come that
[1:06:14] would restore fellowship. And we'd see
[1:06:16] the impact immediately when he did that
[1:06:18] because when Christ came, he would
[1:06:20] settle the sin question forever. And so
[1:06:22] he came and he died on the cross of his
[1:06:25] own will of his own will. Church
[1:06:27] completely surrendered to the word
[1:06:29] purpose of his life. And that day, it
[1:06:31] wasn't a an animal dying, but it was a
[1:06:34] man dying. It was a man for a man. It
[1:06:36] was like for like. And that's the only
[1:06:38] way that the price could be paid. Was a
[1:06:40] willful one. Perfect. Give his life for
[1:06:45] the imperfect, for the sinful. It was a
[1:06:47] God man. It was a son of God dying. And
[1:06:50] then, and only then was a path opened up
[1:06:52] to that fellowship all over again.
[1:06:54] Because before that, church, it was on
[1:06:56] God's terms. God would come down. God
[1:06:59] would go up. God would talk to this one.
[1:07:01] God would talk to that one. It was on
[1:07:03] God's whims that God could have
[1:07:04] fellowship. And it was only when God
[1:07:06] lowered himself to talk to us that we'd
[1:07:08] have any sort of fellowship. But we see
[1:07:10] what happened that day on Calvary when
[1:07:12] Christ gave up the ghost and died the
[1:07:14] veil of the Holy of Holies are split
[1:07:16] from top to bottom showing that it was a
[1:07:19] work of God. And what was he doing? He
[1:07:21] was tearing open the veil that only
[1:07:23] allowed one a year, imperfect though he
[1:07:26] was for a moment into the presence of
[1:07:28] God. And he was tearing that veil wide
[1:07:30] open. And what was he saying? He's
[1:07:32] saying the door's open. Now it's not on
[1:07:34] the basis of me. Now it's on the basis
[1:07:36] of you. You can come in if you're
[1:07:38] willing to go my way. And he showed it
[1:07:41] was a work of God because it wasn't torn
[1:07:43] from the bottom up. It was the top down.
[1:07:45] Showing it was a sign from heaven that
[1:07:46] God was opening up the way back to
[1:07:48] fellowship. And anyone could come into
[1:07:50] the Holy of Holies. Anyone could come
[1:07:52] into the shikina glory if they would
[1:07:54] come his way. Amen. Look at what it says
[1:07:58] in Hebrews chapter 10. It says, "And
[1:08:00] every priest standeth daily ministering
[1:08:02] and offering oftenimes the same
[1:08:04] sacrifices which can never take away
[1:08:07] sins. Doing the same thing over and over
[1:08:10] again, church, with no lasting effect.
[1:08:16] Total waste of time in terms of effect.
[1:08:19] But what it did was it pushed it forward
[1:08:21] one more year. It pushed judgment away
[1:08:23] for one more year. And it gave God a
[1:08:26] chance to be merciful rather than
[1:08:28] judgmental.
[1:08:29] But it wasn't resolving anything,
[1:08:31] covered, not erased. He says, "But this
[1:08:33] man, Jesus Christ, after he had offered
[1:08:36] one sacrifice for sins, forever sat down
[1:08:39] on the right hand of God, from
[1:08:41] henceforth expecting till his enemies be
[1:08:43] made his foottool." Now catch this verse
[1:08:46] 14. For by one offering,
[1:08:51] church, you don't have to make any more
[1:08:52] offerings. We're not the Catholic
[1:08:54] Church. You don't have to make any
[1:08:56] offerings. You don't have to do any
[1:08:59] penance.
[1:09:01] For by one offering he has
[1:09:05] perfected.
[1:09:08] See, we just read before it says it
[1:09:10] could never make,
[1:09:13] let me see, the comer there unto perfect
[1:09:16] is what it says if I'm not mistaken.
[1:09:18] Amen. It says that they could never do
[1:09:21] that with one. They did that with
[1:09:22] millions of animals and it never perfect
[1:09:25] perfected a person. By one offering it
[1:09:27] says he had perfected
[1:09:30] for how long?
[1:09:34] It's only good for today.
[1:09:36] It's only good for yesterday. It's only
[1:09:39] good for him but not for me. No, he has
[1:09:42] perfected forever them that are
[1:09:45] sanctified. Church, we're not clean
[1:09:47] today and tomorrow we're dirty. We're
[1:09:49] not in today and out tomorrow. We're not
[1:09:51] saved today and rejected tomorrow. We're
[1:09:53] not accepted today and kicked out
[1:09:54] tomorrow. By one offering he had
[1:09:57] perfected forever them that are
[1:09:59] sanctified, those that come in under the
[1:10:02] blessing of that work. He says where for
[1:10:04] whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness
[1:10:07] to us. So the Holy Ghost is a witness to
[1:10:10] you in your soul. Your confirmation that
[1:10:12] you are perfected through Christ.
[1:10:15] That's it.
[1:10:18] That's the finishing work. That's the
[1:10:20] confirmation to you, church. Do you need
[1:10:22] the Holy Ghost? You need the Holy Ghost.
[1:10:24] That's the only thing you've got that
[1:10:25] says that he's accepted you, that he's
[1:10:28] perfected you. Amen. You're perfect in
[1:10:30] God's eyes. That's what the Holy Ghost
[1:10:31] says. You're perfect in my eyes. He
[1:10:34] says, "For after that," he had said
[1:10:36] before, "This is the covenant that I
[1:10:38] will make with them. After those days,
[1:10:40] sayeth the Lord, I will put my laws into
[1:10:43] their hearts, and in their minds will I
[1:10:45] write them, and their sins and
[1:10:47] iniquities will I remember no more.
[1:10:50] Church, you look at the Old Testament,
[1:10:51] and what is God always doing? Reminding
[1:10:54] them of their sins.
[1:10:56] This is what you did. This is what you
[1:10:58] did. This is what you did. And here's
[1:11:00] what I had to do. But we come into the
[1:11:02] New Testament. What is he pointing us
[1:11:03] to? The blood. The blood. The blood. The
[1:11:06] mercy. The grace. The mercy. The gracy.
[1:11:09] the grace. And what is it? You're
[1:11:10] spotless. You're perfect. You're without
[1:11:13] wrinkle.
[1:11:16] That's for the old folks.
[1:11:19] Without wrinkle. You got a new body
[1:11:21] waiting for you. He's pointing us to the
[1:11:24] finished work of Calvary rather than to
[1:11:26] ourselves.
[1:11:28] So let me ask you if if what's keeping
[1:11:30] you out of fellowship is yourself, you
[1:11:32] need to read the scripture a few more
[1:11:34] times and say, "Lord, I'm going to take
[1:11:36] the finished work of Calvary and the
[1:11:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost to show that
[1:11:40] I'm allowed to come into your presence
[1:11:41] and fellowship with you one more time."
[1:11:44] Amen. Church, he says, "What? And their
[1:11:47] sins and and their iniquities will I
[1:11:51] remember no more." If he can't remember
[1:11:54] it, it didn't happen. He's the final
[1:11:56] say, church. If it ain't on his videos,
[1:11:58] then it doesn't exist. Satan has nothing
[1:12:01] against you if God says you didn't do
[1:12:03] it. Amen. He says, "Now where remission
[1:12:06] of these is, where forgiveness, where
[1:12:08] release, where freedom of these is,
[1:12:10] there's no more offering for sin."
[1:12:11] Church, you don't have to pay a debt
[1:12:13] that doesn't exist.
[1:12:16] If somebody were by God's great grace to
[1:12:19] just go into TD Bank tonight and pay off
[1:12:22] our church mortgage, when brother Mark
[1:12:24] goes in next week as a as a treasurer to
[1:12:26] make a payment and he says, "I'm here to
[1:12:28] pay the mortgage." You know what they're
[1:12:29] going to say?
[1:12:31] What mortgage?
[1:12:36] Are you catching what I'm saying?
[1:12:39] When you go and you put it under the
[1:12:41] blood and then you go and try and pay
[1:12:44] him back for what he's already forgiven
[1:12:46] you for, he says, "What are you talking
[1:12:48] about? You don't have to pay for that. I
[1:12:51] paid for that. The debt is already paid.
[1:12:54] There's nothing on your record except
[1:12:56] grace, grace, and more grace.
[1:13:00] Don't try and pay a debt that's already
[1:13:02] been paid.
[1:13:05] Let it go.
[1:13:07] If he can't remember it, why should you?
[1:13:09] Amen.
[1:13:11] He says, "Having therefore, brethren,
[1:13:13] boldness." We're going to get into
[1:13:16] boldness later on in this series. Amen.
[1:13:18] Not ashamed, not cautious, not creeping.
[1:13:23] You know, my youngest especially, when
[1:13:26] he knows he's done something he ought
[1:13:27] not to do,
[1:13:29] and he's coming into my presence cuz
[1:13:31] mama sent him,
[1:13:33] you know what he does? He goes real slow
[1:13:39] and he's usually crying before he gets
[1:13:41] there
[1:13:42] because he is convinced that what he's
[1:13:45] going to find is not going to be a good
[1:13:48] time cuz he knows he's done wrong. He
[1:13:52] knows he's in for discipline and dad's
[1:13:54] the worst when it comes to discipline
[1:13:57] cuz dad's the one that does the
[1:13:58] spanking. Dad's the one that puts him in
[1:14:01] his bed. Dad's the one that lays down
[1:14:03] the law harder than anybody else.
[1:14:07] Do you think he has boldness when he
[1:14:08] when he's in that situation? No.
[1:14:12] But what brings him running into my
[1:14:15] presence?
[1:14:18] When he knows I want him there.
[1:14:22] When he knows there's nothing between
[1:14:24] him and I. When he knows he hasn't done
[1:14:27] anything wrong. When he knows he's in
[1:14:29] good standing. Now he's coming in with
[1:14:31] boldness.
[1:14:32] See, church, what we think is because
[1:14:34] I've done wrong, I can't come in with
[1:14:35] boldness. That's what the blood's for.
[1:14:38] Now, you still got to come in in
[1:14:39] humility. You got to come in with a with
[1:14:42] a a a heart of sincerity, repentant, but
[1:14:46] you can still come in with boldness.
[1:14:48] Why? Because like Esther, he wants her
[1:14:52] in his throne room. He wants to draw her
[1:14:55] in. And so, we can come with boldness.
[1:14:59] Why? By invitation.
[1:15:02] He's the one that tore the veil. He's
[1:15:04] the one that opened the way. That's our
[1:15:06] invitation to come boldly to his throne.
[1:15:10] Having therefore, brethren, boldness to
[1:15:12] enter into the holiest by the blood of
[1:15:14] Jesus, not by your works. How many of us
[1:15:18] go a and as we go to sleep at night, we
[1:15:20] say, "Lord, I did good today. How
[1:15:22] thankful I am to you."
[1:15:25] And we're so confidence in our prayer.
[1:15:27] confident in our prayer because we've
[1:15:29] been good today. That's not why we enter
[1:15:31] with boldness. We enter in boldness by
[1:15:34] the blood of Jesus.
[1:15:37] That whether I had a good day
[1:15:41] or whether Satan beat me more times than
[1:15:42] I beat him, we still come in with
[1:15:44] boldness. Why? By the blood of Jesus
[1:15:47] Christ. by a new and living way which he
[1:15:50] hath consecrated for us through the
[1:15:52] veil, that is to say, his flesh, and
[1:15:55] having an high priest over the house of
[1:15:57] God, let us draw near.
[1:16:00] Church, what does that tell me?
[1:16:03] This ain't on him.
[1:16:06] He's ready. He's willing.
[1:16:10] He's waiting.
[1:16:13] And it's up to us to draw. It's up to us
[1:16:16] to come close. It's up to us to accept
[1:16:18] the invitation.
[1:16:20] It's up to us to come into fellowship.
[1:16:23] He says, "Let us draw near with a true
[1:16:26] heart, a sincere heart in full assurance
[1:16:30] of faith, having our hearts sprinkled
[1:16:32] from an evil conscience." In other
[1:16:34] words, the working of the blood, the
[1:16:36] accepting of the finished work of
[1:16:37] Calvary cleanses our conscience from
[1:16:40] what we've done, and it no longer holds
[1:16:43] us back from fellowship in the presence
[1:16:45] of God.
[1:16:47] That's what the Holy Ghost does in our
[1:16:49] life. That's what the blood of Jesus
[1:16:50] does. He says, "Let us draw near with a
[1:16:52] true heart and full assurance of faith,
[1:16:54] having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[1:16:55] conscience and our bodies washed with
[1:16:58] pure water." Oh, so this isn't just an
[1:17:01] inward work, is it? No. This is a life
[1:17:03] that's being sanctified. This is a life
[1:17:05] that's being cleaned up as well, church.
[1:17:07] The blood is not just for the
[1:17:08] conscience. The blood is for the whole
[1:17:10] thing. It's cleaning out of your entire
[1:17:12] life. He says, "Let us hold fast the
[1:17:14] profession of our faith without
[1:17:16] wavering. For he is faithful that
[1:17:19] promised." Amen. Church, you know what
[1:17:22] can be the most disappointing thing is
[1:17:24] you get an invitation and you get turned
[1:17:26] down at the door.
[1:17:28] He's saying, "No, no, no. He promised
[1:17:30] you can come. He promised you can come
[1:17:32] in. He promised you can come in boldly
[1:17:35] and you can come in and he can clean up
[1:17:37] your life.
[1:17:39] He can erase your conscience.
[1:17:42] He can make you come into fellowship
[1:17:43] with him.
[1:17:45] Brother Brown would talk about the
[1:17:47] effect of the blood and how it turns
[1:17:49] what is so obviously sin into the very
[1:17:51] righteousness of Christ through the
[1:17:53] blood. Because through the blood he can
[1:17:55] only see us as sons and daughters of
[1:17:56] God. He says this. He says, "Well, we
[1:17:59] through wrongdoings are red. Though your
[1:18:02] sins be scarlet red, he's quoting the
[1:18:04] scripture. Though the shed blood," he
[1:18:05] says, "through the shed blood of the
[1:18:07] lamb of the Lord Jesus." God looking
[1:18:09] through there red through red looks
[1:18:11] white. He says they shall be white as
[1:18:13] snow. Though your sins be scarlet, they
[1:18:15] shall be white as snow. Why? Because
[1:18:16] he's looking through the blood. I know
[1:18:18] as kids we used to have those those
[1:18:20] tinted glasses and you could mix the
[1:18:22] different colors. And what happens if
[1:18:23] you take uh something that's red like
[1:18:25] the the the
[1:18:27] little marker in my Bible? If I looked
[1:18:29] at that through a red glass, what would
[1:18:31] it what color would it be? It would be
[1:18:34] white. And he's saying through the blood
[1:18:36] of Christ, your sins, though they are
[1:18:38] scarlet, though they are against you.
[1:18:42] Remember, you never want your your
[1:18:43] accounting books to be red. You want
[1:18:45] them to be black. Black means you're
[1:18:47] making money. Red means you owe money.
[1:18:49] He says, "So though you owe money
[1:18:50] through the blood, it looks white. It's
[1:18:53] pure. It's clean." He says, "See, not
[1:18:56] through your something else, but through
[1:18:58] the blood, the only place that he can
[1:19:00] fellowship outside of there, your own
[1:19:02] righteousness, he'll never see it." See
[1:19:04] what he's saying? He's saying through
[1:19:05] the filter of his blood. That's the only
[1:19:07] thing that'll keep you clean. It's the
[1:19:09] only thing that keeps you clean through
[1:19:11] God. I preached on this before. When we
[1:19:13] look at the faith chapter, when you read
[1:19:15] about Abraham and Sarah in the in the
[1:19:17] Old Testament, in the book of Genesis,
[1:19:19] they see we see all their faults and
[1:19:21] failures. We see all their mistakes. We
[1:19:23] see all the things they took into their
[1:19:24] own hands. And you get to Hebrews 11 and
[1:19:26] it's by faith. By faith, by faith.
[1:19:29] Where's their sin? It's white. He can't
[1:19:32] see it. It's pure. It's been erased by
[1:19:34] the blood of Jesus Christ. And all he
[1:19:36] can see now is their faith. How they
[1:19:38] stuck with the word of God. I say praise
[1:19:40] the Lord to that. That's how he's
[1:19:41] looking at you and I this evening. He
[1:19:43] says outside of that, your own
[1:19:44] righteousness, if he looks at you
[1:19:46] through your own righteousness, all it
[1:19:48] does is magnifies
[1:19:50] your own sin. He'll never see your good
[1:19:53] works. He'll never know it until you
[1:19:55] come beneath the blood. Then he sees you
[1:19:57] as his own beloved son or his daughter.
[1:19:59] He said red through red looks white.
[1:20:02] Praise the Lord. He says, "No matter
[1:20:04] what you've done, sinner friend, when
[1:20:06] God looks and sees you confess your sins
[1:20:08] as being wrong, and God looks through
[1:20:10] the blood of the Lord Jesus, he sees you
[1:20:13] snow white."
[1:20:16] He says, "No matter what you've done,
[1:20:17] he's looking through you through
[1:20:19] Christ's blood." He says, "You're
[1:20:21] redeemed, precious thing. God will never
[1:20:24] condemn you no more. He can't condemn
[1:20:27] you." That's why we have to apply the
[1:20:29] blood because when we stand before him
[1:20:31] and we say, "Lord, I've been good. Lord,
[1:20:34] I've done this. Lord, I've done that."
[1:20:35] We're saying, "Lord, judge me through my
[1:20:37] works." And guess what? That doesn't
[1:20:40] hide the sin. But when we say, "Lord,
[1:20:42] I'm pleading the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:20:44] to come into your presence." All he can
[1:20:47] see is perfection. That's what the blood
[1:20:49] of Jesus Christ does you. He says he'll
[1:20:51] never condemn you no more. He can't
[1:20:53] condemn you. Job's always interesting to
[1:20:55] me because Job is before the law. We
[1:20:59] read there earlier. We're going to get
[1:21:00] into this a little bit in the next
[1:21:01] service, Lord willing. Yet Job still
[1:21:03] sacrificed.
[1:21:05] Everything was through the blood. We
[1:21:06] look at Abel. Abel sacrificed. Noah
[1:21:09] sacrificed. Abraham sacrificed. Children
[1:21:11] of God always seemed to understand that
[1:21:13] they had to go through the blood. And
[1:21:15] you know what? everyone else tried to do
[1:21:17] works.
[1:21:19] It's not that the children of God don't
[1:21:21] have works. It's that they understood
[1:21:22] that was never going to be enough. And
[1:21:24] that's a revelation. That's a
[1:21:26] revelation. You're not the bride of
[1:21:28] Christ tonight by works. You're the
[1:21:30] bride of Christ because he chose you and
[1:21:33] he gave the blood of Christ to cover
[1:21:34] you. Amen. It's that unmmerited ring of
[1:21:37] grace that we're wearing. Amen. It's
[1:21:40] through the blood of Christ that we can
[1:21:42] be restored back to perfect fellowship.
[1:21:44] Watch this as we close tonight.
[1:21:48] This is absolutely one of the top 10
[1:21:50] scriptures in the Bible as far as I'm
[1:21:52] concerned. Romans 8. There is therefore
[1:21:56] now,
[1:21:58] not tomorrow,
[1:22:01] not later on, not when we go in a
[1:22:03] rapture, not when we go in a
[1:22:04] resurrection. There is therefore when?
[1:22:06] Now, today. Right here. There's
[1:22:09] therefore now no present tense forever
[1:22:13] unchanging.
[1:22:15] There's therefore now no condemnation to
[1:22:18] them which are in Christ Jesus who walk
[1:22:21] not after the flesh but after the
[1:22:23] spirit. No condemnation.
[1:22:26] In other words, there is nothing to hold
[1:22:28] you back from fellowship with God
[1:22:31] anymore.
[1:22:32] Okay? Zero. God has no condemnation
[1:22:36] towards us. So why do we let us hold it
[1:22:39] back from him?
[1:22:41] That's the human condition. We're trying
[1:22:43] to be worthy
[1:22:46] rather than thankful rather than
[1:22:48] accepting. Amen. If we are in Christ by
[1:22:51] the indwelling spirit, we have the
[1:22:53] witness that we've been perfected in our
[1:22:55] souls. Then what can separate us from
[1:22:56] the love of God? Remember what he said?
[1:22:58] Love demands fellowship.
[1:23:02] Love demands fellowship. Amen. So love
[1:23:04] tears down the barriers that Satan has
[1:23:07] placed, that our mind has built up, the
[1:23:09] complexes we have. And love tears that
[1:23:11] down to restore us back to fellowship so
[1:23:14] that we can come completely into the
[1:23:15] redemptive work of Christ. Amen. Tears
[1:23:19] down everything that we've built,
[1:23:22] church, we can't even stop the work that
[1:23:23] he's doing. That's a wonderful thing to
[1:23:26] know. He says, "For the law,
[1:23:29] this is a law for us. For the law of the
[1:23:31] spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made
[1:23:34] me free from the law of sin and death.
[1:23:36] Remember, there's two laws. There's the
[1:23:38] law of life in Christ Jesus, and that's
[1:23:40] what brought us above the law of sin and
[1:23:42] death. Law requires judgment. Love
[1:23:45] requires fellowship. So that means death
[1:23:47] and fellowship are going to have to
[1:23:49] fight it out.
[1:23:51] Law and life are going to have to law
[1:23:53] and love are going to have to fight it
[1:23:54] out. And guess what wins, church? Law
[1:23:57] versus love. Love wins every time.
[1:23:59] That's what Calvary was. It was
[1:24:01] loveinning. And so it demands
[1:24:03] fellowship. Amen. Our judge has now
[1:24:05] become our advocate. The prophet of God
[1:24:07] would say,
[1:24:09] "There's no one to condemn us anymore.
[1:24:12] There's no one to place a sentence. Sin
[1:24:14] has been condemned." Amen. Why? Because
[1:24:16] love demands fellowship.
[1:24:18] He says, "For what the law could not do,
[1:24:20] and that it was weak through the flesh,
[1:24:22] God sending his own son in the likeness
[1:24:24] of sinful flesh and for sin condemns sin
[1:24:27] in the flesh." In other words, Christ
[1:24:30] Christ's sacrifice condemned sin in
[1:24:33] itself. It judged sin. It sentenced sin
[1:24:36] and it put it away.
[1:24:39] Sin was judged. Instead of you being
[1:24:42] judged, sin was judged. It meant it was
[1:24:44] locked up forever. No longer to have a
[1:24:46] hold on our life. And it's condemned in
[1:24:48] the flesh. Church, whatever sins are
[1:24:50] here, stay with the flesh when we go.
[1:24:53] This sin, this this flesh is never going
[1:24:55] to be perfect. That's why it gets left
[1:24:58] behind and we go into a glorified body
[1:25:01] because sin is condemned in the flesh.
[1:25:04] But it's the soul that God's coming
[1:25:06] after in our lives. He says, "Why? That
[1:25:08] the righteousness of the law might be
[1:25:09] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[1:25:12] flesh but after the spirit." Brother Ram
[1:25:16] says this as we close.
[1:25:18] But when our body becomes in tune with
[1:25:21] God, becoming a part of him, then our
[1:25:25] soul can pick up the power of the Holy
[1:25:27] Ghost to vindicate the presence of the
[1:25:29] Lord Jesus Christ in all of his power
[1:25:33] and omnipotence.
[1:25:36] That's a quote. When our body becomes in
[1:25:39] tune with God,
[1:25:42] that's the whole thing, church.
[1:25:45] It starts with a soul work, but he wants
[1:25:47] to get this whole thing in tune. And
[1:25:49] that's really where our our Sunday
[1:25:51] series is going to be going, becoming a
[1:25:53] part of him. He says to vindicate him in
[1:25:56] all of his power and omnipotence. He has
[1:25:58] risen from the dead. He lives among us
[1:26:00] today. He says, "And he wants fellowship
[1:26:04] back with his people again. His great
[1:26:06] majesty, his glory is now spreading
[1:26:09] forth. and he's desiring to fellowship
[1:26:11] again with his people like he did in the
[1:26:15] Garden of Eden. Amen. God bless you. You
[1:26:18] can stand this evening. Amen. We've set
[1:26:21] a record. I think
[1:26:24] I know I haven't talked much about
[1:26:26] prayer, but we're getting there. But
[1:26:28] we're setting the basis for why we have
[1:26:30] prayer in the first place. And we'll see
[1:26:32] that prayer leads us into fellowship.
[1:26:35] That is our fellowship with God. That's
[1:26:37] the personal connection. And that's the
[1:26:39] the daily connection that we have with
[1:26:41] God. And we'll see that fellowship is
[1:26:43] the basis for prayer. It's not a I need
[1:26:45] this and I need that, but it's a desire
[1:26:47] for fellowship that brings us into
[1:26:49] prayer. And that's what turns it into
[1:26:51] what it's supposed to be in our
[1:26:52] Christian walk. And so much of what we
[1:26:54] are as believers flows out from that
[1:26:56] prayer life, from that communion, from
[1:26:58] that time that we spend with God day by
[1:27:01] day. Amen. Amen. I trust this has been
[1:27:04] okay today. It's setting a foundation,
[1:27:06] like I said, and we'll get into more
[1:27:08] depths and maybe some of these these
[1:27:09] questions that we've talked about, but
[1:27:11] my goal is to try and keep it as short
[1:27:13] as I can and concise so we can just come
[1:27:15] in and we'll eat supper for 45 or 55
[1:27:18] minutes and then we'll go out and we'll
[1:27:20] rejoice and go on our way and go back to
[1:27:22] our beds. Amen. God bless you this
[1:27:24] evening. Let's bow our heads if we
[1:27:26] would. Amen. Heavenly Father,
[1:27:32] Lord, sin demanded justice,
[1:27:37] Lord. Sin demanded judgment,
[1:27:40] Lord, but love demanded fellowship,
[1:27:43] Lord. And through your redemption plan,
[1:27:45] Lord, that's what we've received today
[1:27:46] as we've got full fellowship back with
[1:27:49] you, Lord, as much as it can be
[1:27:50] experienced in these sinful bodies that
[1:27:52] we live in. Lord, we're thankful that
[1:27:54] you've made a way. You've made a
[1:27:56] provision. Lord, there's an open door
[1:27:58] standing for us. Lord, there is an
[1:27:59] invitation to come into your presence
[1:28:01] and to spend time with you, heavenly
[1:28:03] father. Lord, I pray you help us to take
[1:28:06] that invitation every day, Lord. That we
[1:28:09] would find our way into your presence,
[1:28:11] Lord. Not by formality, Lord. Not by
[1:28:13] form, not by tradition, Lord, but that
[1:28:16] in our prayer time, Lord, in our prayer
[1:28:18] closet, Lord, that we would have true
[1:28:20] communion with you, each one, Lord. that
[1:28:22] it would draw us into personal
[1:28:23] connection with you, heavenly father.
[1:28:26] Lord, I pray your grace, Lord, that you
[1:28:28] would just strengthen us through this
[1:28:29] series, Lord. That you would take it and
[1:28:31] use it, Lord. That you would teach us,
[1:28:32] that you would encourage us, Lord, that
[1:28:34] when we come out on the other side,
[1:28:36] Lord, not only would we understand,
[1:28:38] Lord, what you're trying to do, Lord,
[1:28:39] but we would experience, Lord, the very
[1:28:42] things you've talked about in these
[1:28:43] things. Lord, bless your people. We pray
[1:28:46] in Jesus Christ's name we ask it. Amen.
[1:28:50] Sister Priscilla, you're going to hate
[1:28:51] me. Paid in full. Can we put paid in
[1:28:55] full up there? See if we can we can put
[1:28:57] our our way through this tonight. I'm
[1:29:00] sorry that just came to my mind as I was
[1:29:02] standing here. And this is an old Curlet
[1:29:04] song as many of you know. So, we're
[1:29:06] going to sing this a little bit tonight.
[1:29:10] Justice called for a payment for sin.
[1:29:17] No one worthy could [singing and music]
[1:29:19] be found among men.
[1:29:24] But the precious son of God [music] with
[1:29:28] a cross and thorny [singing] crown paid
[1:29:32] a debt with the blood of the lamb.
[1:29:37] [music]
[1:29:39] Paid in full by the [singing] blood of
[1:29:43] the lamb.
[1:29:45] [music]
[1:29:46] Oh, free from sin, free to live now I
[1:29:51] am. [music]
[1:29:54] And it reads on the page where my sins
[1:29:59] were written down, [singing] paid
[1:30:01] [music] in full by the blood of the
[1:30:06] lamb. [music]
[1:30:09] Oh, how great was the
[1:30:11] [music and singing] debt that I owe. Oh,
[1:30:16] bound to pay for the seeds
[1:30:19] [music and singing]
[1:30:20] I had sown.
[1:30:24] [music] But in Jesus, my Lord, a great
[1:30:29] treasure [singing] I have found. [music]
[1:30:32] I'm redeemed by the [singing] blood of
[1:30:36] the lamb. [music]
[1:30:39] made it full by the blood of the lamb.
[1:30:44] [music and singing]
[1:30:46] Oh, freed from sin. [music] Free to
[1:30:49] live. [singing]
[1:30:51] Now I am.
[1:30:55] And [music] it reads on the page where
[1:30:59] my sins were written [music] down. Paid
[1:31:03] in full by the blood of the lamb.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; and justice called for a payment
[1:31:14] for sin.
[1:31:17] [music] Oh, no one worthy [singing]
[1:31:20] could be found among men.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, but the precious son of God with a
[1:31:30] cross and thorny [music and singing]
[1:31:32] crown paid the debt with the blood of
[1:31:38] the lamb.
[1:31:41] Oh, [music] paid for by the blood of the
[1:31:46] lamb. [singing]
[1:31:49] free from sin, free [music and singing]
[1:31:51] to live. Now I am.
[1:31:57] And it reads [music] on the page where
[1:32:01] my [singing] sins are written down, paid
[1:32:05] [music] in full by the [singing] blood
[1:32:09] of the lamb. [music]
[1:32:12] know how great was the [singing] debt
[1:32:16] that I owe
[1:32:19] [music]
[1:32:20] bound to pay for the [singing] seeds I
[1:32:25] have sold.
[1:32:27] [music]
[1:32:28] But in Jesus my Lord, a great treasure
[1:32:33] [music and singing]
[1:32:34] I have found. I'm redeemed by the
[1:32:39] [singing] blood of the lamb.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Paiden full by the [singing] blood of
[1:32:48] the lamb.
[1:32:50] [music]
[1:32:51] Oh, free from sin. Free to [singing]
[1:32:55] live. Now I am.
[1:32:58] [music]
[1:33:00] And it reads on the page where my sins
[1:33:05] were [music and singing] written down.
[1:33:08] paid him for by the blood of
[1:33:12] [music and singing] the lamb.
[1:33:17] He has forgiven me. Uh it's a 956 and
[1:33:22] then my chains are gone. We kind of roll
[1:33:23] into that.
[1:33:34] He
[1:33:36] has
[1:33:37] forgiven [music]
[1:33:40] me.
[1:33:42] My sins [singing]
[1:33:43] [music] have been washed
[1:33:46] from his memory
[1:33:50] by the blood [singing] of the lamb
[1:33:54] [music] of Calary.
[1:33:56] [singing]
[1:33:59] He [music]
[1:34:01] has
[1:34:03] forgiven
[1:34:05] me. [music]
[1:34:07] He
[1:34:09] has
[1:34:11] forgiven [music]
[1:34:13] [singing] me.
[1:34:15] My sins have been washed
[1:34:19] from his [music and singing] memory
[1:34:23] by the blood of the lamb [music]
[1:34:27] at Calary.
[1:34:32] He
[1:34:34] has
[1:34:36] forgiven [music]
[1:34:38] me. Oh, he [music]
[1:34:42] has [singing]
[1:34:44] forgiven
[1:34:46] me.
[1:34:48] My [singing] sins [music] have been
[1:34:51] washed
[1:34:52] from his memory.
[1:34:56] By [music] the blood of the lamb
[1:35:01] at Calary,
[1:35:03] [music and singing]
[1:35:05] he
[1:35:07] has
[1:35:09] forgiven [music]
[1:35:11] me. My chains [singing] are gone
[1:35:16] and I've been set [music]
[1:35:18] free.
[1:35:21] My savior
[1:35:24] [music]
[1:35:25] ransom me.
[1:35:28] And like a flood,
[1:35:32] his mercy [music]
[1:35:34] grace,
[1:35:36] unending [singing]
[1:35:38] love, [music]
[1:35:40] amazing grace.
[1:35:44] My [singing] chains are gone.
[1:35:48] I've [music] been set free.
[1:35:52] My God, my Savior
[1:35:57] answer [music and singing]
[1:35:58] me.
[1:36:00] And like a flood,
[1:36:04] his mercy [music and singing]
[1:36:06] brings
[1:36:08] unending love. [music]
[1:36:12] Amazing grace. One more time. [music] My
[1:36:17] chains are gone.
[1:36:20] I've been set free. [music]
[1:36:24] My [singing] God, my Savior
[1:36:28] [music]
[1:36:29] ransom me.
[1:36:33] And like [singing] a [music] blood
[1:36:37] his mercy reigns
[1:36:40] [music] unending love.
[1:36:44] Amazing [singing]
[1:36:46] grace
[1:36:49] he came to me. 570
[1:36:55] He came to me. [music]
[1:37:03] He [singing] came to me [music]
[1:37:10] when I [singing] could not come
[1:37:15] to [music] where he was.
[1:37:19] He came to me.
[1:37:25] [music]
[1:37:26] That's why he died.
[1:37:31] [music]
[1:37:34] on Calary.
[1:37:38] [music]
[1:37:42] When I could not [singing] come [music]
[1:37:47] to where he was,
[1:37:51] he [music] came to me.
[1:37:57] He came to me.
[1:38:03] [music]
[1:38:05] He [singing] came
[1:38:07] to me. [music] Hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:38:11] Lord. Hallelujah. When I [singing] could
[1:38:15] not come. Praise your name. Thank you,
[1:38:18] Lord. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord.
[1:38:22] Praise your name. Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:38:25] Thank you, Lord.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; That's why. Hallelujah.
[1:38:32] Yes. Thank you, Lord.
[1:38:36] On [music and singing] Calary.
[1:38:42] [music]
[1:38:43] But when I [singing] could not come
[1:38:48] to where he was,
[1:38:52] he came [music] to me. Sing it one more
[1:38:55] time.
[1:38:58] For he came to [music] me.
[1:39:06] He came to me.
[1:39:11] [music]
[1:39:14] When I [singing] could not come
[1:39:18] to [music] where he [singing] was,
[1:39:22] he came to me.
[1:39:29] That's why he died [music]
[1:39:37] on Calary.
[1:39:40] [music]
[1:39:44] When [singing] I could not come up
[1:39:49] to where he was,
[1:39:53] he [music] came to me.
[1:40:02] You know, I look back at my own life and
[1:40:06] I see the arrogance and the criticism
[1:40:09] that kept me back.
[1:40:11] But, you know, through all that, there
[1:40:12] was always a pull.
[1:40:14] Bad attitude, bad ideas, wrong
[1:40:17] impressions,
[1:40:19] selfishness,
[1:40:21] intellectuality,
[1:40:23] my own sense of my own greatness.
[1:40:27] Through it all, church, he came through.
[1:40:29] I'll never forget the light, the night I
[1:40:31] gave my life to my Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:40:38] I'll tell you this. I went from thinking
[1:40:39] a lot of myself to thinking nothing of
[1:40:41] myself.
[1:40:43] Prophet of God would say, "In that
[1:40:44] presence, you can't condemn anybody
[1:40:47] else. You can only see your own faults."
[1:40:49] And I saw very clearly how much I needed
[1:40:52] him. But I also saw what he [music]
[1:40:54] would do if I would let him do something
[1:40:56] with me. Amen.
[1:40:58] When I couldn't go to him, he came down
[1:41:00] to me. And he called and he wooed and he
[1:41:03] called and he pulled until I finally
[1:41:05] answered. Amen. And the prophet of God
[1:41:08] would say, "If you got that pull,
[1:41:11] it's the greatest thing you could ever
[1:41:14] have."
[1:41:16] And he'd say, "Don't wait one more day
[1:41:18] to give [music] into it.
[1:41:21] Don't take another minute, but give it.
[1:41:23] Yield to that call. Yield to that pull.
[1:41:27] You haven't given your life to him.
[1:41:28] Yield to that. You haven't been in his
[1:41:30] presence. Say, "Lord, I'm coming back
[1:41:32] into your presence. I feel that pull. I
[1:41:34] feel that draw.
[1:41:36] I'm going to come through the blood and
[1:41:38] I'm going to trust that you'll do a work
[1:41:40] in my life. Amen. I'm so thankful he
[1:41:42] came to me. Amen. And I'll tell you this
[1:41:45] and I've said it many times. When I laid
[1:41:48] my burdens down,
[1:41:51] you've never seen a person feel lighter.
[1:41:54] Brother Be talks about feeling all
[1:41:56] scoured out. That's the most glorious
[1:41:58] feeling. Church, that's what his
[1:42:00] presence is meant to do to us day by
[1:42:02] day. Scour us out. make us feel clean.
[1:42:07] Make us be what he sees. Amen. Not to go
[1:42:11] in feeling broken and beat up and
[1:42:14] failed, but to go in and be refreshed,
[1:42:16] be cleaned out, fit for service, [music]
[1:42:19] and then to walk out and be ready to do
[1:42:21] his will one more day, one more week,
[1:42:24] one more month. Amen. I just want to
[1:42:26] encourage you, church. Don't run away
[1:42:28] from his presence.
[1:42:30] If you got something between him and
[1:42:31] you, make it right through the blood.
[1:42:33] There's nothing he can't make right, but
[1:42:36] come back into his presence and let him
[1:42:37] [music] work a new in your life. Amen.
[1:42:40] We're going to sing one more song. We're
[1:42:42] going to sing that song. Thank you,
[1:42:43] [music] Jesus, for the grace that you
[1:42:45] have given. 10:21.
[1:42:47] Who did we have open up in prayer,
[1:42:48] Brother Joe, Brother Mark, Brother Bob,
[1:42:51] welcome back. We're going to have you
[1:42:53] close in prayer if that would be okay.
[1:42:55] [music] You're good for that. Amen. Have
[1:42:57] him close in prayer. Let's remember
[1:42:59] those that aren't here. Let's remember
[1:43:01] the saints in Jamaica. Let's remember
[1:43:03] the service on Sundays. Brother Mark
[1:43:04] takes that. Amen. I I wish I could be
[1:43:07] here. I don't know if I'll be able to
[1:43:08] listen. Maybe on the plane if the Wi-Fi
[1:43:10] is good enough. I I think I'll be able
[1:43:12] to do it, brother Mark. So, if so, I'll
[1:43:14] be listening in [music] and uh enjoying
[1:43:16] it from there. Hopefully, I don't get
[1:43:18] taken down by the air marshals for
[1:43:19] saying amen. [music] Amen. But looking
[1:43:21] forward to that. Sure. Appreciate you
[1:43:22] taking that. Then remember, Brother
[1:43:24] Garfield as well, church. He's a busy
[1:43:26] busy man and he's still going to come
[1:43:28] preach for us. So, just uh be in prayer
[1:43:30] for him. Come expecting. can come and
[1:43:32] join and I know the Lord will do
[1:43:34] something special for you. Amen. Let's
[1:43:36] sing this and let's thank him with all
[1:43:38] of our hearts. Amen. If [music] you've
[1:43:39] understood what it means to to
[1:43:41] experience the blood of Christ in your
[1:43:43] life, I'll tell you this. You got
[1:43:45] something to thank him for tonight.
[1:43:46] Let's sing this.
[1:43:49] Thank
[1:43:51] you [music]
[1:43:54] Jesus
[1:43:59] for the grace that [music and singing]
[1:44:01] you have
[1:44:03] given us.
[1:44:07] though I can't [music] repay, but from
[1:44:11] my heart I'd like to say that I
[1:44:17] thank you. [music]
[1:44:22] Thank
[1:44:24] you my Jesus [music]
[1:44:32] for the grace that you have
[1:44:36] given us.
[1:44:40] Oh, I [music] can't repay. But from my
[1:44:44] heart, I'd like to say that I
[1:44:50] thank [music] you.
[1:44:55] Thank [music]
[1:44:57] you, my Jesus,
[1:45:01] [music]
[1:45:04] for the grace that you have
[1:45:08] given us.
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; Though I [singing] can't repay, but from
[1:45:15] my heart, I'd [music] like to say that I
[1:45:22] thank [music] you.
[1:45:25] Amen. As brother Bob comes, I just want
[1:45:28] to say thank you to the musicians. Amen.
[1:45:31] And I want to say thank you to Sister
[1:45:32] Priscilla,
[1:45:34] Brother Paul, Brother Joe, Sister Moren
[1:45:37] back there, and Brother Bob as well. You
[1:45:39] know, I come every service, but even
[1:45:42] when I don't preach, they're here every
[1:45:44] service, and we certainly appreciate
[1:45:45] that. And we haven't uh made a swap out
[1:45:49] because we're unhappy with Sister Moren.
[1:45:50] Far from it. But she is slowly backing
[1:45:53] away from this. And so, Sister Priscilla
[1:45:55] will be taking the Wednesday nights,
[1:45:56] Lord willing, moving forward. She has
[1:45:58] been for a little bit. But I want to say
[1:46:00] thank you to her for taking that up.
[1:46:02] She's got a lot on her plate. She's
[1:46:04] homeschooling three kids. She's got a
[1:46:06] husband, a home to run, and she's taking
[1:46:08] this on as well. So, especially for her,
[1:46:10] [music] I say thank you for that. But,
[1:46:12] Brother Bob's been doing this for many,
[1:46:14] many decades now. And he will probably
[1:46:17] also soon be backing away somewhat, but
[1:46:20] we'll see what the Lord's timing is on
[1:46:21] that. But, amen. I want to thank them
[1:46:23] while they're here, while they're in
[1:46:25] their right mind, while they're able to
[1:46:27] accept our thanks and appreciation for
[1:46:28] that. It's a sacrifice every single time
[1:46:32] they're here. And it's not just in
[1:46:33] service. You talk to Brother Bob. He'll
[1:46:36] spend hours in prayer looking for God's
[1:46:39] leadership for songs. Sister Moren, I've
[1:46:41] been in the house and she'll play for
[1:46:43] hours and just go through the song books
[1:46:45] over and over and over again to stay on
[1:46:47] top of it. Most churches can't play 15
[1:46:50] songs out in the world. We've got 1,200
[1:46:52] that we can play almost at the drop of a
[1:46:53] hat. That takes real dedication. So, I
[1:46:56] want to just show my appreciation from
[1:46:58] them. I I might be the preacher, but
[1:46:59] theirs is a ministry of its [music] own.
[1:47:01] And there's a blessing and an anointing
[1:47:03] that comes with it. And we are to the
[1:47:05] great benefit of those gifts that we
[1:47:07] have here and the sacrifices they make
[1:47:09] and their spouses that give up that time
[1:47:12] and [music] that that fellowship with
[1:47:13] them so that they can be a part of the
[1:47:15] body and do a part in the body. So,
[1:47:17] thank you to each one of you. Sure
[1:47:19] appreciate you. God bless you. Amen.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Heavenly Father, we just bow Lord
[1:47:28] once again to thank you, Father, as we
[1:47:30] just saying, Lord, to thank you for the
[1:47:32] grace that you've given us. Unworthy as
[1:47:34] we are, Lord, you still knew us before
[1:47:36] the foundation of the world, Father. We
[1:47:39] were in your thoughts then, Father. And
[1:47:41] by grace, Lord, we're in your thoughts
[1:47:43] now. And so, Lord, we just thank you for
[1:47:45] that. And we thank you, Lord, for the
[1:47:47] way you've led us over the years,
[1:47:49] Father. the grace that has lifted us up,
[1:47:51] Father, and and and helped us, Lord,
[1:47:53] through all the battles and and
[1:47:56] pressures that [music] we've had over
[1:47:57] the years, Father. But Lord, you've been
[1:47:59] the victor, Father. You've given you
[1:48:01] fought the battles, Lord, and you've
[1:48:03] given us the victory, Father. And so,
[1:48:06] Lord, as we come down to the end of all
[1:48:08] things, Lord, we just want to thank you,
[1:48:11] Father, that you've made a way for us,
[1:48:12] Lord, and that, Father, we can look back
[1:48:14] and see, Father, how you've led us over
[1:48:17] those all those years, Lord. and to
[1:48:19] know, Father, that we've come to the
[1:48:21] place where we know, Lord, that there's
[1:48:23] a a heaven to gain, Lord, there's a hell
[1:48:25] to shine, Lord, and the enemy is going
[1:48:27] around as a roaring line trying to
[1:48:29] devour us, trying to throw us off, Lord.
[1:48:31] But, Father, we know, Lord, that there's
[1:48:33] one greater than he that's in this
[1:48:35] world. So, we pray that you would be
[1:48:37] with us, Lord. Strengthen us, Father, as
[1:48:39] we continue on, Lord. And, Father, we
[1:48:42] just pray that you bless those, Lord,
[1:48:44] that are suffering tonight, Lord,
[1:48:46] because of the hurricane, Lord. And
[1:48:48] Father, those in Jamaica, Father, we
[1:48:50] thank you that you preserve life, Lord.
[1:48:52] And we pray, Father, that you continue
[1:48:54] to help them, Lord, to recover,
[1:48:57] Father. And Lord, all those that, Lord,
[1:48:59] that may be in the path of the storm as
[1:49:01] it continues on. We're just praying,
[1:49:03] Father, that your presence will be there
[1:49:05] to guide, guard, and protect each one.
[1:49:07] So bless us as we leave this place
[1:49:09] tonight, Father. We just pray, Father,
[1:49:12] that your presence would go with us
[1:49:14] [music] and that, Lord, your light would
[1:49:15] shine upon us and in us, Father. And
[1:49:17] that, Lord, you'd lift us up, Father,
[1:49:19] into heavenly places as as we continue,
[1:49:22] Father, to just trust you, to believe
[1:49:25] you, Father, with all of our hearts as
[1:49:27] we commit ourselves into your hands
[1:49:28] tonight in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[1:49:31] Amen. Amen.
