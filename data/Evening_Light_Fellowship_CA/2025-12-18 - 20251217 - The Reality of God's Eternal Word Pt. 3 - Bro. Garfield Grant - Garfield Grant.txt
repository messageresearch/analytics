Eternal God and Father Lord we thank you for tonight we thank you for the grace Lord God that you have extended towards our lives Lord oh God it's not because we're good it's not oh God because Lord there is an righteousness Lord God we are presented but Lord with humbler hearts we come before your presence Lord And Lord God, the grace we can do, Lord, is to take ourselves out of the way, Lord God, and allow, Lord God, your Holy Spirit to come, Lord, and to speak to our hearts. Lord God, we love you tonight, Lord. Because, oh God, of what you have done for us, the scripture declares that while we are yet sinners, Lord, you died for the ungodly. And the least we can do tonight, Lord God, is to offer ourself, Lord, our bodies, our thoughts, oh God, our minds, our heart, oh God, as a living sacrifice, Lord. that Lord you will come Lord God and dwell in our hearts Lord God and possess our reigns and Lord God that we will be living instruments in your hands Lord God for your manifestation bless your people Lord God and may you be among us Lord God as we speak Lord God Lord you understand the needs of your children and all the requestes all the needs that were mentioned the sicknesses and oh God you're still the bomb in Gilead you're still the great physicianord Lord. And so God, we put all the cases in your hands tonight, Lord God, that you will come forth and and be the one, oh God, to be acknowledged, Lord God, to be the healer, to be the deliverer tonight, Lord. Bless your people, Lord God, as we come believing. And we say thanks for hearing and answering prayer. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. We say, "Amen." Amen. Do you love him tonight, church? God is truly a wonderful God. And tonight we we're just grateful to be standing at my point of duty. It's one of my greatest joy to serve the people especially the bride of Jesus Christ. And so you know I stand here in service to the body of Christ. Amen. I have been um this is like uh my third uh uh service and um we'll be reading from um 1 John 5. Oh, the topic is posted here. So, you can take it for your notes there. And it begin reads us. If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater. For this is the witness of God which he has testify of his son. He He that believeth on the Son of God has the witness in himself. He that believeth not God had made him a liar because he believeth not the record that God gave of his son. And this is the record that God has given us eternal life. And this life is in his son. And he that has the son has life. And he that has not the son of God has not life. You may be seated tonight. I think this is where we left off the last time. Hallelujah. You know, brother Brandham spoke of, you know, when he he said that, you know, the son of God is not another God really, but it was the eternal spirit that was being manifested. You see, the invisible God, hallelujah, made visible in the form of sunship. And that sunship is just really God in a bodily form where he can express himself. So we saw the word the Bible said in the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the world was God. Brother Breton explain it perfectly. He said God emptied himself into Christ either or he poured himself or hemorpher himself into Christ. And so we saw God the eternal spirit uh was made visible in Christ uh hallelujah praise God. And so God bearing record of Christ UH THAT HALLELUJAH THAT THE life that is in him the eternal life was himself. And God bearing record of his son. And he said, "And if you HAVE GOD, IF YOU HAVE THE SPIRIT, UH, the only way you can get the spirit is by having the son, is having the Jesus Christ." Because without having Jesus Christ, hallelujah, you have no life. You know, I I tonight, you know, I've been studying this topic for a while and I'm very curious about, you know, my Christian journey about this part that, you know, we are called to very observant. I, you know, observe a lot of stuff and and um I recognize church from my own experience really, you know, um I recognize there's more to this Christian faith. you know, there's so much more to it. And you know, I my experience started back, you know, in Jamaica. You know, I was young about 13 Bob about 13, 15, 14 there about and I got sick and you know, I got sick to a point where I, you know, for about a year I couldn't do anything. I couldn't travel on the road. I couldn't take my exam. I couldn't have gone to school. I was sick. I wasn't a Christian back then. I was just a young man trying to find my way and I got sick and it was bad, you know, real bad. And like every weekend my mom would take me to the doctor, you know, just to get some medical help and and you know, um, nothing worked. you know, she spent money, you know, a lot of money in order to, you know, to see the doctor until we end up doing, you know, the MRI and uh, you know, we did CAT scan and, you know, and all sort of things, but nothing and it went like that for about a year until, you know, my mother told me that, you know, she gave up, you know, she did everything possible as a mom, you know, and, you know, she said that at the stage at where I was, she was preparing for funeral. Yeah. She she she was embracing for the bad news, you know. But in my young days, I she had a a a a New Testament Bible, Brother John. And I took that Bible from her. And I remember what I did. I opened the scripture. You know, I didn't know what I was doing. I was looking for hope somewhere, right? Because if medical science was wasn't there to help, then I was looking for hope, right? And and so I turned that Bible and I put it under my clothes. And so whenever time I started feeling sick, I I would press the Bible against my skin. And in my mind, I believe that there was something would have left from the the Bible on, you know, under my skin and and it works. You know, it felt, you know, each time I started feeling sick, I pressed on it and I started feeling a little better. But I found something in that experience. you know, I told her that I wanted to get baptized and my first baptism was in the denominational church and and so two weeks after I got baptized, um I remember she had a dream, brother John, and the dream was that she saw me uh I was I fell into a foring like river and and it was so high and boisterous and it was taking me along the path and she said that she saw this guy, he was passing and he saw me in the water and I was drowning and the guy jumped into the water and saved me and you know and and he said she said that in the dream I was rescued and I said yes that's exactly what I was looking for and brother Bob from that day from that day my life was never be was never the same there was a total turn around from the experience You know, every time I started feeling sick, I keep on reminding myself and reminding the sickness of that dream. I I keep on telling that devil, remember the dream. Remember the dream. And that was like 35 or something years ago, right? But the thing that really comes to mind is what is it about a simple dream? That's what draw my my thought into Christianity. WHAT IS IT A dream could do that medical science couldn't have done? And I said, it's I had to stop a little bit. I said some there's something about this Christian faith that that they're so different. But I found something in that experience that as I grow I begin to realize looking at life and and this mortal life and seeing exactly what it is that there's so many ups and downs, so many instances of of struggles and and sicknesses AND AND AND WORRIES and all of these things that will come your way in in this mortal life. But I FOUND MY EXPERIENCE BACK THEN POINTS ME TO SOMETHING that was greater than this mortal life. And so I have used that instant in in several experiences really. You know I've had a you know different times when you know when the situation becomes so bad. But when I remember what he did for me back then hallelujah. It gave me confidence to believe that the God that was able to make something create an experience out of nothing. Hallelujah. And so I began focusing on that until God, you know, he was gradually being bringing me into so into into THE REALITY OF OF UNDERSTANDING HOW WHAT THIS Christian faith is really. And so I BEGIN REALIZING THAT THERE'S more to this Christian faith than what you know we and more to this mortal life also that than than we are really looking at really. And so when I came to the message, YOU KNOW, I STARTED OUT, YOU KNOW, you know, we were like, you know, like kids, you know, getting a new toy. We we saw brotherham's message and we we were very elated, you know, brother Bob about the message. We we had this quote based type of thing but it didn't really mean much to us really until one day we had a brother from overseas and he preached a message and something struck me again AND I BEGIN REALIZING HALLELUJAH THAT there's life in this message life real life that can change the order of things and so I start reading the message more in and in a different light because I begin realizing THAT BROTHER BRANDHAM HAD this message here. It it came to Hallelujah. There was something about this message that we have to understand. So I started reading the books all over again because I began realizing that there's more to this message. Hallelujah. And so pointing back to brother I'm going back to the the notes that's my story. But I want you to understand where I'm going tonight because this motor life look at the church. We are here in church tonight and it feels as if there's like it's like a rhetorical decimal BUT THERE'S MORE TO IT CHURCH. THERE'S MORE to this MORTAL LIFE. THERE'S MORE TO OUR EXISTENCE. There's more to our to to our experiences. And so, hallelujah. I want us to stop a little bit and look at that. You know, BROTHER BENAM IN he spoke of the mind of Christ. He said, "What are those thoughts of God?" He said, "The eternal thoughts of God." Let me ask. He said, "Are the thoughts of God eternal?" He said, "The thought of God are eternal and they are real." You see, our definition of re of reality, brother Mark, is what we see, what we can touch, WHAT WE WHAT WE CAN HEAR, but but what we we prescribe as reality. Well, here a prophet is pointing to something that was real, much more real than what we we we're used to. That there's a there's a greater experience, HELLO, IN GOD THAT WAS NOW POINTING BACK to us that IS NOW CALLING US BACK TO THE THE REALITY OF GOD. ARE YOU GETTING ME CHURCH? SO, BROTHER BAM SAID, "ARE THESE THOUGHTS OF GOD? ARE they real?" He said, "Yes, they are." Hallelujah. Now we understand the father of God. Brother said they were made expressed in word. And so when we SPEAK OF THE WORD, WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT dead letters, BUT WE ARE SPEAKING OF THE LIFE THAT IS IN the word. ARE YOU THERE WITH ME CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. Praise God. So when we said THE THOUGHT OF GOD, THERE WERE MADE EXPRESS in Christ the word. BUT BUT THE WORD IS THE LIFE OF GOD. IT IS THE SPIRIT OF GOD that was made word which was the THE ETERNAL LIFE THAT WAS made expressed. Hallelujah. So that they are not just simple like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up which one day will be translated in substance and form. They are already real and eternal and part of God. Hallelujah. And so we look at this mortal life. all things. This is to be just part my my my my curious that I just see everything right. Look at this mortal life here. I was saying to my wife the other night, it feel like a rhetorical decimal. You know, every morning she wakes, she go to work. I take her to work, she works, she does everything. So I asked her, "Honey, what you do today?" She said, "The same thing I do every day." you know it feels like a rhetorical decimal YOU KNOW BUT LET US look at it a little bit a little bit further like for example I was once in Jamaica and here I'm in your fund how did I get here the choices you make why did you make that choice Huh? Why did brother B sit there and not over there? What is happening? What what what what is unfolding in our life experience? It seem AS THOUGH LIFE AS WE see it we we are just moving like like robots but we are stepping into something AND AS WE WALK AND as we move and as WE BREATHE IT IS UNFOLDING something it is unfolding AN EXPERIENCE. HALLELUJAH. Without even knowing that we are doing it. So unconsciously things ARE HAPPENING AND WE ARE PARTICIPATING AND WE are looking back and WE ARE SAYING WE ARE LIVING. Are you there me church? BUT THE LIFE THAT WE ARE POINTING TO THAT WE CALL LIVING IS MORTAL LIFE. Are you there me church? AND AS WE EXPRESS IT as we live and and move and have our being. HALLELUJAH. WE'RE LIVING under immortal CONDITION THAT SUBJECT US. YES, WE SEE THINGS ARE HAPPENING. ARE YOU ME CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. BUT IF WE can stop and see exactly what is being unfold. Hallelujah. This mortal life, our things are expressing our own life AND THE CYCLES THAT WE EXPRESS LIKE HALLELUJAH. Like I I'm here. I'm in school. What am I doing in school? I just did some exam the other day and they were hard, you know, but I I'm doing it right. And brother Mark, I'm almost done. I saw that three years ago. And if I was in Jamaica, I wouldn't have been in school here. You see what I'm saying? So something there's something about it. But we need to stop and look and see. Right. Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. SO WE ARE SEEING THIS PART THAT IS CALLED MORTAL LIFE. And each time we see something like we see something sick OR WE SEE SOMETHING HALLELUJAH THAT IS UNDER the condition. Hallelujah. It expresses the weaknesses of this mortal life. Hallelujah. But said THE REASON WHY HALLELUJAH IT IS THE WAY IT IS. HE SAID WHEN THEY LOOK OUT AND you see a tree, they're struggling. HE SAID THERE'S ANOTHER TREE SOMEWHERE THAT DOESN'T HAVE to struggle. Are you hearing me, church? You see, when we look into this side of things, we see the weaknesses and THE STRUGGLES AND THE FAILURES. WE SEE THE DEFEAT. UH BUT CHURCH, I HAVE GOOD NEWS FOR YOU. THERE'S ANOTHER REALM SOMEWHERE. HALLELUJAH. WHERE THERE'S NO STRUGGLE. ARE YOU HEARING ME, CHURCH? THERE'S GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE AND EXISTENCE. Oh my. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. HALLELUJAH. IT SURE THERE'S A PLACE SOMEWHERE. HALLELUJAH. Where it can't die. Hallelujah. So all our action, all our works, ALL THAT WE DO, HALLELUJAH. IT PRODUCES one thing. It produces death. WHAT IS THAT? IT COMES to an end. It started AT A POINT, BUT IT COMES TO AN END. It produced, it comes, IT COMES UP, BUT THERE'S A TERMINATION. HALLELUJAH. Praise God. No wonder the Bible said IT'S APPOINTED AND MAN WANTS TO DIE. BUT AFTER DEATH, HALLELUJAH, THERE COMES THE JUDGMENT. WHAT IS THAT? IT'S A TERMINATION. LIFE STARTED BUT IT COMES TO AN END. HALLELUJAH. You know the other day I was talking to brother Bob and he we were talking about how young he was at one time. We hear brother Bob is not so young anymore AND PROBABLY HE'S GOING A LITTLE BIT SLOWER YOU KNOW BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT IS you know you know it's NOT GOING UP IT'S COMING DOWN AND THAT WHAT IT IS HALLELUJAH AFTER YOU REACH CERTAIN age you start going back you're pressing back from when you came are you there with me church it comes to an end hallelujah hallelujah why because it produces debt that's what THIS WHAT A LIFE DOES it produces death. So we in in one sense it looks like living. Hallelujah. You know AND ANOTHER SENSE HOW IT comes to AN ABRUPT IT STOP. That's it. Hallelujah. And the Bible said it stays there until judgment. Hallelujah. to hear brother Benham said you know brother and I'm I'm quoting this because uh brotherham was looking talking to his sister Dolores at the the time when his mother was transitioning but said I said Dolores there's an oak tree left of your window she said yes I said all summer long has It it been pretty with them green leaves. Yes. I said, "Who are they now?" She said, "Well, they are brown, yellowish, green." So, I said, "When when was they the prettiest? When they were green or when they are like now?" She said, "Now." And I said, "Yet they are dying." That's when life is most beautiful. It's a That's right. When she got to a place, I said to her, I said, "Mama, how does it feel now?" She said, "Wonderful." When she got to a place, she couldn't speak no more. I said, "Mama, I'm your preacher boy." Yet, Billy, do you recognize me? She couldn't speak no more. I said, "If Jesus still mean as much to you as he did the day you received him in the form of the Holy Ghost, bat your eyes real fast." And she battered her eyes and the tears running down her cheek. Then for a little while, then a little wind came in the room and she went out with hate. He said, "Oh yes, see it's all right. A tree hungs its leaf and the first thing you know that leaf begins to color when life leaves it. He said what happened? The life is in the leaf. It goes back to the root of the tree where it comes from only to come back again in the springtime to bring another leaf. He said and we are on a tree of life when we are reborn. He said when life leave this he said the life goes back to God that gives it to come again in the millennium with a leaf that can't drop off the tree the amen there you are eternal that perpetual life. Hallelujah. He said we have eternal life. You see they it's a they fall comfort is a what it is natural typing the spiritual. Hallelujah. And so church hallelujah we are not JUST SPEAKING ABOUT A life that is dying because we see and we feel it in our bodies. But if YOU RECEIVE ETERNAL LIFE, HALLELUJAH, WHAT YOU RECEIVE IS ANOTHER LIFE in this mortal life. ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH? AND THAT ETERNAL LIFE, YOUR JOURNEY, AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, CHURCH. YOUR JOURNEY TO ETERNITY DOES NOT START WHEN YOU GET TO HEAVEN. IT STARTS HERE AND NOW. HALLELUJAH. Your journey TO THE ETERNITIES. HALLELUJAH. IN OTHER WORDS, HALLELUJAH. THE EXPERIENCES UH JUST AS HOW YOU'RE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE MORTAL LIFE. HALLELUJAH. YOU MUST BE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE ETERNAL LIFE HERE and now. Hallelujah. Praise God. And so Peter SAID 1 PETER 1 and verse 23 HE SAID BEING BORN again not of corruptible seed but incorruptible seed by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever. Hallelujah. He said for all flesh IS AS GRASS AND THAT IS TRUE BY MARK. ALL OUR FLESH IS LIKE GRASS. HALLELUJAH. AND THE glory and all the glory of man as the flower of the grass. for the grass witherth. That's what is happening to US. UH THIS MORTAL LIFE LISTEN. HALLELUJAH. WE WANT TO HOLD ON TO IT. WE WANT TO ACHIEVE as much out of it. But let me tell you something. WE HAVE SEEN IT OVER AND OVER. We worked so hard. Brother M. IS THAT TRUE? WE WORKED SO HARD TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING. AND BROTHER MARK, THERE COMES A DAY YOU SIT ON YOUR VERANDA, HAVE YOUR BLANKET OVER YOUR SHOULDER looking on, AND NOTHING THAT YOU WORK FOR HAVE no use for you. It's just there. ALL YOUR LABOR IS JUST THERE. ARE YOU THERE, MY CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. WHICH means that if THIS IS THE ONLY HOPE THAT YOU HAVE, YOU LABOR, THEN YOU DIE. BUT THERE'S GREATER HOPE, CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. IN ETERNAL LIFE. ARE YOU THERE, CHURCH? SO, I'M NOT JUST POINTING YOU TO JUST LIVING TO THE CONDITION OF MORTAL LIFE, BUT I'M POINTING you to eternal life because this one, it withers and it fade. YOU FEEL YOUNG AND STRONG AND BEAUTIFUL. HALLELUJAH. WHEN YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR, H THE PROJECTION THAT you see, it's all LOOKING GOOD. HALLELUJAH. BUT YOU KNOW little by little the creeks and and THE CRINKLES START SETTING. WHAT WHAT WHAT IS HAPPENING? DEATH IS SETTING in eventually it fall away. But the Bible said but the word of the Lord endure it forever. And this is the word by which the gospel is preached. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And so church, this life, this seed is corruptible. This seed of corruption, this seed will comes to an end. This seed will get sick. This seed will get tired. This seed will get RARELY YOU. HALLELUJAH. YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF IN SITUATION AT TIMES YOU'RE WONDERING HOW DID I GET HERE? HALLELUJAH. BUT THAT WHAT THIS LIFE PRODUCES. THERE'S NO CERTAINTY HERE. ARE YOU THERE, CHURCH? IT COMES TO AN END BY REASON OF THE LIFE THAT is it's operating through. HALLELUJAH. AND SO IT CANNOT BE THE ULTIMATE OF OUR FAITH. THERE GOT TO BE MORE THAN THIS CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. Because it cannot be sustained. And so I'm bringing the contrast between the two. Hallelujah. But said in the message a prisoner he said and now when I see like you're sitting up there using fans talking it said that mean you're living but it's only only a shadow of life because anything has got to have darkness in it TO MAKE A SHADOW. IT'S A SEA BECAUSE A SHADOW has to possess so much darkness and so much light to make a shadow AND IT CAN BE ALL TOGETHER DARK AND IT can't be alltogether light. Hallelujah. He said it is if there's DARK IT IS REAL dark and it is light. He said there's no shadow. Nothing make a shadow. But if it's MIXED WITH DARK AND LIGHT IT MAKES A SHADOW. WHAT BETTER BUT I MUST TALK YOU ABOUT CHURCH LIFE HALLELUJAH AS LONG AS HALLELUJAH WE LIVE HERE AND WE SUBJECTED AND WATCH MY WORD carefully because hallelujah IF WE'RE SUBJECTED HALLELUJAH TO THE CONDITION OF THIS MORTAL LIFE UH H THAT EACH TIME SOMETHING HAPPENED THERE'S NO THERE'S NO RESOLVE TO IT WHAT HAPPENED TO US CHURCH HELLO WE HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED BY THE DARKNESS HALLELUJAH AND SO AND SO THE DARKNESS IF IT IS ALLOWED IT WILL TAKE YOU OVER. NO WONDER DAVID SAID THOUGH I WALK TO THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH AND FEAR NO EVIL FOR THOU ART WITH ME. ARE YOU THERE CHURCH? BECAUSE IT'S JUST A SHADOW BUT BUT IT HAS LIGHT IN IT. WE GOING TO SEE AS WE GO ON SAID we are really shadows of light. Hallelujah. In other word, the the experience that we have HERE SPEAKS OF NOT JUST HOW IT'S NOT ALL TOGETHER DARK. IN OTHER WORDS, WE HAVE SOME SEMBLANCE of experience that will POINT US BACK TO THE REALITY OF GOD'S WORD. BUT YET, STILL THERE ARE INSTANCES that will keep us into captivity. ARE YOU THERE, ME, CHURCH? BUT WHAT WE NEED IS NOT JUST TO LIVE UNDER A SHADOW EXPERIENCE. WHAT WE NEED IS AN EXPERIENCE THAT WILL BRING GOD ON THE SCENE IN HIS FULLNESS. HALLELUJAH. So we really a shadow of light. You're reflecting life from somewhere. So you if you are a Christian, this being a shadow, it only prove there is a life where you can't die because this life has death in it. BUT A SHADOW BECAUSE YOU'RE A LIVING moving creature with abilities to see and think and move and talk the five senses of the of THE BODY BUT YET YOU KNOW THERE ARE THEY ARE dying and there's so much trouble you know it can be it's a it's a reflection see there's life and death mixed together hallelujah hallelujah and so church this mortal life. It comprises of that life and death mixing together. Hallelujah. And we're going to see that tonight. That's what is it? Hallelujah. But listen. Hallelujah. As we live and of of our experiences really. Hallelujah. Is it in our Christian journey? Hallelujah. THE EXPERIENCE ALSO MUST BRING OUR FAITH INTO OPERATION. HALLELUJAH. that at times when you sick AND YOU BELIEVE GOD HALLELUJAH WHAT WHAT YOUR FAITH DID IT TAKES the situation AND BRING SOMETHING A RESULT HALLELUJAH THAT WAS UNEXPECTED HALLELUJAH AND SO WHEN THE DOCTOR SAY IT'S IMPOSSIBLE AND YOUR FAITH SAY I BELIEVE GOD ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH WHAT IS IT IT'S LIGHT AND DARKNESS ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH HALLELUJAH BUT FOR YOU WHO BELIEVE GOD WHO'S A CHRISTIAN LISTEN THE DARKNESS CANNOT WIN. HALLELUJAH. PRAISE GOD. WHY? BECAUSE OF YOUR FAITH IN THE UNFAILING WORD OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Praise God. And so, brother, in scripting this, we getting there a little bit. In in scripting this, HE SPEAKS OF THIS LIFE AS A BOOK, you know, like a book. And you know a book, a story, brother Mark, it has characters. It has different sceneries and plots and high points and low points. And it's like a book. You know, you're you're reading it and hallelujah. and and you know, Revelation 20. In verse 11, he said, "And I saw a great white throne, and to him that sat on it, from whence's face the earth hurt, and the heaven fled away, and there was found no place for them." And I saw the dead, small and great, standing stand before God. And the books were open, and another book was open, which was the book of life. And the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the book according to their works. Now that is very important. Hallelujah. Because listen, it was what was written in the book they were judged by. Are you THERE CHURCH? AND SO THESE THAT WERE JUDGED AT THE WHITE THRONE, THIS IS NOT THE BRIDE. THESE ARE THEY THAT CAME UP IN ON the second resurrection BUT THEY WERE JUDGED BY THEIR WORKS. ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH? REMEMBER WHAT THE BIBLE SAID? HALLELUJAH. BY YOUR WORKSH YOU CANNOT BE JUSTIFIED. THERE'S NO WORK. THERE'S NOTHING THAT YOU CAN DO IN THIS MORTAL LIFE UH THAT WILL REP REPRESENT RIGHTEOUSNESS OF PERFECTION. ARE YOU THERE WITH ME CHURCH? BUT NOW HALLELUJAH. THE BRIDE IS NOT JUDGED BY HER WORKS. THE BRIDE IS JUDGED BY HER FAITH. ARE YOU THERE IN THE ME CHURCH? AND SO SHE WAS RAPTURED BASED ON HER BELIEF IN GOD. BUT HERE THE BOOKS THAT HAS THE RECORD. WHICH RECORD? THE RECORD OF THEIR LIVES. THE THINGS THAT THEY DO HERE. BUT CHURCH WHEN YOU SEE IT, YOU'RE SEEING LIGHTS AND PEOPLE JUST LIVING AS THE WEATHER THE WAY THEY WANT. BUT LISTEN, BUT WHEN GOD WAS REFERRING TO THEIR HURTY EXPERIENCE, HE SAID THEIR LIFE WAS WRITTEN IN A BOOK AND IT WAS RECORD THE EXPERIENCES. HALLELUJAH. And so, hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. But the bride was already raptured. She was justified not by works but by her faith. Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. And so when it came into this mortal life church became sinful. The script of our life remember when we came into the this world when we when we were born we were born in sin and THE SCRIPT OF OUR LIFE WHAT WAS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK. HALLELUJAH. OH MY. IF YOU COULD HAVE SEEN MY LIFE BEFORE AND READ WHAT'S THERE. IT WAS ALL BAD. HALLELUJAH. THE RECORD OF MY LIFE. LISTEN CHURCH. EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US. UH GOD HAS A RECORD OF YOUR LIFE. IT'S IN THE book and it IT CAPTURES YOUR EXPERIENCE HERE AND HURT ALL THE INSTANCES. EACH TIME YOU YOU'RE IN CHURCH IS RECORDED. THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING TO YOU, YOU BEING IN CHURCH, YOU'RE NOT JUST HERE. HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE HERE, BUT BECAUSE IN GOD'S RECORD, GOD HAD ALREADY POSITIONED you being here. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU THERE, MY CHURCH? AND SO WHAT YOU'RE DOING, HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE UNFOLDING THE SCRIPT. HALLELUJAH. AND YOU'RE STEPPING INTO THE REALITY OF the script. ARE YOU THERE, MY CHURCH? SO WHEN WE ALL CAME INTO THIS WORLD, HALLELUJAH, OUR LIVES WERE INSCRIPTED. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] AND WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE. BUT WE KNOW THAT WE HAD LIFE. AND OUR LIFE WAS RECORDED IN THE BOOK OF LIFE. So all WE WERE UNFOLDING WAS LIFE. ARE YOU THERE CHURCH? BUT THE STORY, OH MY, the story of my life. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. IF YOU HAD READ THAT PART OF THE STORY OF THE MARK, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE WANTED TO BE acquainted with me because the STORY OF THAT SIDE OF MY LIFE WAS BAD ME CHURCH. BUT GOD HAVE IT IN A SCRIPTURE THAT THERE HAS COME A TIME IN MY EARTHLY JOURNEY IN MY EXPERIENCE. HALLELUJAH. THAT I WOULD COME IN contact with another life. Are you there ME CHURCH? AND SO THAT I'VE EXPERIENCED IT CHANGES THE ORDER OF MY LIFE. UH I'M NO LONGER SUBJECTED TO THE BOOK OF LIFE. UH ARE YOU THERE CHURCH? I'M NOW SUBJECTED TO ANOTHER BOOK. HALLELUJAH. Praise God. Hallelujah. So there's an order to our life. Hallelujah. The story of our lives. You know there's so much story really. You know, you know, man, I I I could tell you, you know, when me when I met my wife, you know, I just saw her at at a at a game at a we had a sport day and I met her there and you know, I was just bold went up and saw this beautiful young lady and I I said a few words and not knowing that three years after 3 years after brother John I would met her again. How did that happen? I don't know. But it was as a result of meeting her, I was able to meet the virgin there Lynston because if I was in ANOTHER PARISH, I WOULDN'T HAVE MET HER. And I would and I'm almost CERTAIN I WOULD HAVE MET THE VIRGIN THERE. But you know what I'm saying TO YOU? BUT IN GOD'S RECORD, GOD HAD ALREADY POSITIONED ME TO BE A PART OF THE BODY OF CHRIST. SO WHAT DID HE DO ACCORDING TO HIS RECORD? HALLELUJAH. WHEN YOU READ THE SCRIPT, GOD WAS SEEING THE DETAIL OF THE CONTENT OF MY LIFE. SO WHAT DID HE DO? HE ORDERED MY MY LIFE, MY STEP ACCORDING TO HIS WORD. HALLELUJAH. He lead me TO THE POSITION WHERE I NEED TO BE TO HEAR THE RIGHT THING OF THE RIGHT TIME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. It's the story of your life. Hallelujah. BUT THIS TIME, YOU'RE NOT THE ONE THAT IS TELLING IT. THIS TIME, GOD [screaming] IS THE ONE THAT IS TELLING THE STORY. HALLELUJAH. Because he's not reading it as it unfold. Hallelujah. But said, hallelujah. Your name of your first nature was born and put in a book of life. This is it church. You are written in this book of life, everything that you will do, EVERYWHERE YOU WILL GO, EVERY person that you meet, every time you pray, every time you be in church, every time you sing, everything that you do is recorded. AND ALL YOU'RE DOING IS SIMPLY ACTING IT OUT. [screaming] Are you there, church? Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. YOUR FIRST NATURE WAS BORN and put in a book of life. And all your deeds, hallelujah, was wrote in it too. Everything you done under that nature was put in a book called the book of life. You see there notice in Daniel when he came to the ancients of days whose hair was as white as bull and 10,000 time 10,000 came with him to minister to him. He said that's the bride. And then the books were open and another book was open which was the book of life. It says see there are saints already there the church the bride and another book was open which was the book of life. Hallelujah. Praise God. So I want you to see WHAT I'M SAYING TONIGHT CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. THAT the story is a story of life. Hallelujah. It's a story. THIS JOURNEY IS A JOURNEY OF LIFE. IT STARTED WITH LIFE. BUT WHEN WE CAME, THE LIFE THAT WE HAD, HALLELUJAH. COULD NOT GO ANY FURTHER. THE BIBLE SAID THREE SCORE AND 10 AFTER WHICH YOU YOU GO DOWN. NOW YOU THERE ME CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. BUT I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS MORTAL LIFE. I'M TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING GREATER. HALLELUJAH. GREATER IN EXPERIENCE, GREATER IN UNDERSTANDING, GREATER KNOWLEDGE, SOMETHING THAT IS GREATER THAN OURSELVES AND THAT IS ETERNAL LIFE. HALLELUJAH. ETERNAL LIFE, CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. PRAISE GOD. HALLELUJAH. Can can you bring that image up for me? Hallelujah. You know, I got this image from one of the brother. He he preached on it and I think this image fits perfectly. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You see what we're looking AT TONIGHT, CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. You know, brother talked about what the triunity of our beings. Hallelujah. And so we are body, spirit and soul and physically, you know, you know, we we our body, you know, human element, you know, physical form where we interact and we live and we BREATHE AND WE DO ALL OF THESE NATURAL STUFF REALLY BY our five senses. And so YOU KNOW BUT GOING BACK to the soul you see IN THAT WHITE ERA. HALLELUJAH. YOU SEE HALLELUJAH BROTHER Benam said we had ARE PART OF CHRIST AT THE BEGINNING. WE WERE [screaming] A PART OF THE WORD TO BE TO IN THE BEGINNING. AND SO IF YOU HAD COME BY WAY OF THE WORD IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU CAME LIVING and expressing THE ETERNAL LIFE OF GOD THEN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO SHADOW INSIDE OF YOU. YOUR SOUL WOULD HAVE BEEN ENGULFED WITH LIGHT AND EXPERIENCE OF THE ETERNITIES. ARE YOU THERE CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. AND LISTEN. AND IF YOUR SOUL, HALLELUJAH, DOES NOT HAVE ANY LINEAGE WITH GOD, THAT'S HOW DARK YOUR SOUL WILL BE. IT WILL BE TOTAL DARKNESS AND ABSENCE. ARE YOU THERE, MY CHURCH? BUT PRAISE GOD. HALLELUJAH. WHEN WE CAME INTO THE WORLD, HALLELUJAH, WE BECAME SINFUL BY REASON OF BIRTH. HALLELUJAH. THE BIBLE SAID WE WERE BORN IN SIN AND SHAPED IN INIQUITY. In sin we were conceived and because of THE SINFUL NATURE OF OUR BIRTH, WE CAME INTO THE WORLD. HALLELUJAH. WITH THAT DARKNESS, BUT LISTEN CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. BUT IN HALLELUJAH. THAT HARD COMPARTMENTAL brother Barry was preaching about it. He said 3% HALLELUJAH. OF THE LIFE INSIDE HALLELUJAH. IS A SEED GERM of life. ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH? WHAT'S THIS? IT IS LIGHT THAT IS THERE BUT THAT LIGHT IS DOMINANT. IT DOES NOT TAKE THE DOMINANCE FORCE. ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH? AND SO WHAT WE WERE EXPERIENCING, WE WERE EXPERIENCING THE DARK SHADOWS OF THIS LIFE. HALLELUJAH. BUT LISTEN. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. LISTEN. BUT IF YOU BELONG TO GOD, IF YOU ARE A CHILD OF GOD, WHEN YOU CAME INTO THIS WORLD, GOD HAD PUT A LITTLE LIGHT in it. Are you there, MY CHURCH? THAT KNOWING THAT ONE DAY, ONE DAY ALONG YOUR JOURNEY, ONE DAY ALONG YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCE, HALLELUJAH, THAT LIGHT, HAL WILL BE MAGNIFIED. ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH? THAT ANOTHER LIGHT, HALLELUJAH, WHICH IS THE LIGHT OF his presence, WILL COME AND DO WHAT? AND STRIKE THAT SEED. HALLELUJAH. And so if you were BORN INTO THE SMARTER LIFE AND YOU DID NOT HAVE THAT DREAM SEED OF LIFE INSIDE OF YOU, HALLELUJAH, there's nowhere possible you CAN GO BACK AND CLAIM A SUNSHIP OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. CHURCH, LISTEN. OUR JOURNEY, HALLELUJAH. OUR JOURNEY DID NOT START WHEN WE CAME HERE, BUT OUR JOURNEY STARTED in Christ. BUT BECAUSE WE WERE BORN WRONG, WE CAME WITH A LIFEUH THAT'S DYING. HALLELUJAH. BUT GOD PROMISED that when he came, when we came here, HE PLACED A LIFE THERE AND HE PROMISED THAT ONE DAY, ONE DAY, CHURCH, HALLELUJAH, HE'S GOING TO change our experience. He's going to take THE DARKNESS OUT AND HE'S going to bring that light to life. Oh my. Oh, sorry to be shouting. I'm getting a LITTLE BIT EXCITED. HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE there's hope in it, church. There's hope in it. THERE'S HOPE IN THIS LIFE. HALLELUJAH. YES, WE ARE LIVING MORTAL. YES, WE ARE SUFFERING. YES, we we feel defeated. But church, THERE'S HOPE. THE HOPE IS THAT GOD PUT A LITTLE light in it knowing that one day, one day he's going to come and he's GOING TO KNOCK AT YOUR DOOR. And when he knocks, he said, "If you hear my voice," he said, "Open the door and let me in. Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. God want to change your experience. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But what he does before he does that, brother M. Hallelujah. He had to come and to strike the seed. Brother said we did not become seed by our new birth, but because that germ seed of life was there. Hallelujah. That's why we are able to reborn for inse there's nothing to quit in. Are you there ME CHURCH? THERE'S NOTHING TO COME ALIVE. THERE WILL TAKE A FORM OF GODLINESS UPON THE FLESH AND UPON the spirit but it cannot reach the soul. Are you there church? Oh my church is a living experience of living eternal. I I want TO TELL YOU TONIGHT uh that THERE GOT TO COME A TIME UH HALLELUJAH LIVING IN YOUR MORTAL STATE UH THERE GOT TO COME A TIME JUST AS HOW YOU ACCEPT BY YOUR FIVE SENSES THE MORTAL CONDITION THERE GOT to come A TIME HALLELUJAH FROM HALLELUJAH in your eternal state you got to move away from your mortal condition and step in your eternal condition there you got to there going to come a time when you got to step in the eternal eternal life that is in you now. It got to come alive. So the Bible said in the beginning 1 John 1 was the word. When the word was with God and the word was God, the same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him that without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life and the life is the light of man. Hallelujah. The life is the light. Hallelujah. And so when he that light was struck by the by the life of God, it is to bring that germ seed of of life. Hallelujah. Alive in you to produce the eternal things. So that germ of life was in us when we came into the world. Hallelujah. But we say we know that it was dominant. Hallelujah. Waiting for the time. Hallelujah. Amen. Waiting for that hour. Waiting for the the experience. Hallelujah. And listen what I'm saying TO YOU BECAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU JUST TO FEEL LIKE because you're in CHURCH HEARING ME. HALLELUJAH. THAT THAT THAT THIS IS NOT JUST REGULAR SERVICE CHURCH. But it is a time where Hallelujah. when the Holy Spirit uh is calling back to the seed in you. Are you there, church? Either to WAKE IT UP OR TO GIVE IT MORE EXPERIENCE OF ITSELF. ARE YOU THERE IN THE CHURCH? BECAUSE THERE'S always something happening with the seed. Hallelujah. It's not just you sitting down, nothing happening. THERE'S ALWAYS AN EXPERIENCE. JUST AS YOU WAKE UP, HALLELUJAH. AND YOU GO OUT AND YOU WORK AND YOU WORK AND YOU UNFOLD AND YOU UNFOLD. You do this, YOU GO THERE, YOU UNFOLDING THING. IF YOU'RE A CHRISTIAN AND GOD IS IN YOUR SOUL, THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING HAPPENING. ARE YOU THERE, CHURCH? SOMETIME YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN IT. SOMETIME YOU CAN'T DO IT. ALL YOU CAN DO IS SHOUT. SOMETIME YOU JUST WALK AROUND. SOMETIME YOU CRY. WHY? BECAUSE something is happening on the inside. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. And so when we came into this mortal world, Hallelujah. Now we start talk languages. Hallelujah. We are in a mortal world because we are living in mortal bodies. Hallelujah. But we are not mortal people. Oh my. We are not mortal people. We're immortal people, but we're just LIVING IN A MORTAL BODY. HALLELUJAH. You know, ONE THING I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED, YOU KNOW, EACH TIME in the in the in in the in the biblical experiences, you know, when we see when the angel of the Lord comes and and HE VISIT THE PROPHET AND the presence of that angel will cause the prophet TO FALL LIKE A DEAD MAN. HALLELUJAH. AND AND so the angel have to touch AND TO REVIVE. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHAT IT IS, CHURCH. THIS MORTAL BODY CANNOT CONTAIN THE ETERNAL THINGS. ARE YOU THERE, CHURCH? THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU CAME INTO THE IMMORTAL BODY, HALLELUJAH. YOU ARE SUBJECTED TO mortal experience. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And so, Hallelujah. What am I saying to you? I'M SAYING YOU HALLELUJAH. THE WAY GOD HAS the work of immortality INSIDE YOU. IT'S NOT just changing your soul. HE'S CHANGING YOUR BODY, your spirit, and your soul. Because everything has to come OUT OF THE EQUATION OF eternal church. It's an OPERATION CHANGE. BUT IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU'RE SEEING. It depends on what you're looking at. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And so when we came into the world, we life was dominant because of our first birth. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He created a part for you and I church to bring that seed to life by our whole life experiencing. Hallelujah. The Bible says in him was life and the life was the life of man. Hallelujah. And so church in this life WE SAW INSTANCES HAD A REFLECTION. HALLELUJAH. NOT OF this life. Hallelujah. saying to you, hallelujah, as we go, AS WE JOURNEY, WE BEGIN HAVING more and more experiences and we how did that happen? Hallelujah. All I did, and this is the foolishness of what God is doing. All the pieces of the most The dream of producing life in the simplest form the highminded will instances instances instances. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. GOD IS BRINGING WAR and more of the genocide experiences. HALLELUJAH. AND AS YOU LIVE AND something come against you. Hallelujah. God another instance OF REVELATION OF HIMSELF. HALLELUJAH. Praise God. Oh, I didn't realize that Mike was there. Oh my. Yeah, I think I got it right. instances, the revelation of God keep on unfolding. It doesn't come all at once, but little by little, little by little, experience by experience. Today, you're not feeling well, and you put it in the church group. Can you pray for me? Hallelujah. And next year, this time, you didn't even remember that you HAD A REQUEST. HALLELUJAH. WHY? BECAUSE GOD REMOVE it completely. remove it. Even from your own memory, you don't even remember that it's there. Are you there, MY CHURCH? BUT WHAT GOD IS [screaming] DOING WITHOUT INSTANCES, GOD IS NOW DRAWING YOU BACK TO SOMETHING THAT IS REAL. HE SAYS, "YES, YOU GET SICK, BUT I AM YOUR HEALER. YES, YOU NEED, BUT I AM YOUR PROVIDER." ARE YOU THERE, MY CHURCH? AND SO, IT IS IN THE SHADOW. It is in the DARKNESS WHEN IT FEEL ALL HOPE IS LOST. THAT'S WHEN GOD STEP DOWN AND bring the supernatural on the scene. Oh my. GOD DOES AN OPERATION. BUT WHAT IS HE DOING? HE'S BRINGING THAT LITTLE SPECK OF LIFE. HE'S BRINGING IT TO LIFE BY THE EXPERIENCE. OH CHURCH, YOUR JOURNEY IS NOT EMPTY. IT IS FILLED WITH THE JOY OF GOD IN YOUR SOUL. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. It's happy. It's joyful to know that in my time of weakness, in my TIME OF TROUBLE, HALLELUJAH, GOD WANT TO CHANGE MY EXPERIENCE. He want to bring me into a greater order of the UNFOLDING OF THE LIFE. WHERE WHERE'S THAT LIFE? It is in you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But I want you to understand what is happening to you. Hallelujah. Because you see, we could take it all the way to heaven, but one DAY WE'LL GO TO HEAVEN. BROTHER MARK, CAN WE EXPERIENCE IT IN HEAVEN? WELL, LISTEN. I'M NOT IN HEAVEN RIGHT NOW. I'm here alone. I am here. If I'm going to experience God, I want to experience it now. &gt;&gt; If God is a healer, I want to know now. &gt;&gt; IF HE'S A PROVIDER, I WANT TO KNOW NOW. ARE YOU THERE, CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. AND SO THE experience is change is TAKING US OUT OF THE MORTAL EXPERIENCES AND HE'S NOW BRINGING US BACK TO OUR ETERNAL STATE WHERE WE NOW SEE START SEEING THE IMPOSSIBLE AND THE THINGS THAT COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED IN A NATURAL sense but THE SUPERNATURAL IS STEPPING IN. ARE YOU ME CHURCH? AND IT'S something sometime you can't even explain what is happening to you. You can't. You try, but you can't because sometimes it's it's impossible really to explain the supernatural things of God. Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. And so we saw in the book of Hebrews, Hebrews 11, hallelujah. The experience that they had, we saw faith brought the victory. And this is what I'm saying to you all. These are people who NEVER HAD THE BAPTISM of the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. You know the baptism of the HOLY GHOST IS CHRIST in you. THE HOPE OF GLORY. YOU KNOW WHAT CHRIST COMES TO DO? HALLELUJAH. HE COMES IN THE SOUL IN THE FORM OF THE HOLY GHOST TO DO WHAT? TO NURTURE THE SOUL BACK TO ITS RIGHTFUL STATE. ARE YOU THERE, CHURCH? SO, IT'S NOT ABOUT ME. It's not about you. It's not about none of us. IT'S ABOUT THE CHRIST THAT IS IN YOU. ARE YOU THERE, MY CHURCH? BUT THESE PEOPLE NEVER HAD THE HOLY GHOST. THEY HAD AN ANOINTING THAT CAME UPON THEM. HALLELUJAH. AND GAVE THEM AN EXPERIENCE. AND YOU HEAR WHAT THE BIBLE SAID. THESE ALL DIED IN FATE, NOT HAVING RECEIVED THE PROMISES, but but having seen them a far off, and were persuaded of them, AND EMBRACED THEM, AND CONFESS that they were strangers and pilgrim on the hurt. For they that say such thing, for they say such thing declare plainly, that they seek a country. And truly if THEY HAD BEEN MINDFUL OF THE country from whence they came out of they might have had opportunity to HAVE RETURNED. BUT NOW THE DESIRE A BETTER COUNTRY THAT IS AN heavenly whose WHEREFORE GOD IS NOT ASHAMED TO call them their their God for he has prepared for them a city. Verse 23 he said for through faith subdue kingdom water righteous that obtain promises stop the mount of lon hallelujah quench the violence of f of fire escape the hedge of the sword out of weakness were STRONG WALKED VIOLENT IN FIGHT TO FIGHT THE HARNESS OF THE ALIENS women receive the dead race to life again and others were tortured not accept accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others a trial of cruel mocking and scorching. Yeah. Mohovah bonds and imprisonment. They were stoned. They were s of sunder were tempted were slain with a sword. They wandered about in sheepkin and godskin being destitute afflicted of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in desert, in mountain, in den. Hallelujah. And cave of the hurt. AND ALL AND THESE ALL having obtained a good report. Oh my. HALLELUJAH. HAVE YOU READ THE REPORT? Have you read the REPORT WHEN NOAH WAS THERE AND GOD SAW THE WORLD THAT IT WAS ALL SINFUL AND GOD SAID, "I'M COMING DOWN TO DESTROY IT." HALLELUJAH. BUT THE BUT NOAH FOUND GRACE. &gt;&gt; HE FOUND GRACE. AND WHAT GOD DID? OH MY. LET'S GET INTO STUFF TONIGHT. OH MY. WHAT GOD DID? HALLELUJAH. GOD STEPPED DOWN. HALLELUJAH. AND GAVE NOAH A WORD. HALLELUJAH. DO YOU KNOW CHURCH? [screaming] HALLELUJAH. THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WHEN NOAH WENT OUT AND HE GOT THAT COPPER WORD AND HE WAS CHIPPING AWAY WHAT HE WAS DOING. HE WAS WRITING HIS EXPERIENCE UPON THE heavenly things. ARE YOU THERE MY CHURCH? The thought didn't come from Noah. It came from God. ARE YOU THERE MY CHURCH? AND SO IT'S TIME NOAH GET THE HAMMER AND HE WAS NAILING. HE WAS BRINGING FORTH A part of the revelation. HALLELUJAH. BUT WHERE WAS THE CHURCH? WHERE WAS NOAH? He was not in heaven. He was right here on earth. Hallelujah. AND SO THE EXPERIENCE THAT HE HAD WAS UNFOLDING MORE OF THE MIND OF GOD. And so the intention is the intention IS IS TO BRING GOD'S WORD IN MANIFESTATION. HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES BY WAY OF THE WORD, IT CHANGES THE EXPERIENCE. IN TIME OF DEATH, IT CHANGES THE EXPERIENCE. In time OF SIN AND WORLDLINESS, IT CHANGES THE EXPERIENCE. HALLELUJAH. Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. So we can focus. Hallelujah. On this life, Hallelujah. And look at it. It feels so innocent. As if, hey, let's just continue with it. It feels good. It feel achievable. It feel successful. We could continue with it. We could continue believing. Hallelujah. But at the end of it, there's great hope. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But this is what I want you to catch this now. HALLELUJAH. BUT WHAT GOD WAS DOING, YOU SEE, CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. THE BIBLE SAID BROTHER SAID AND AND PAUL WRITES ALSO HERE HE SAID BY FAITH NOAH BY FAITH ABRAHAM what was ABRAHAM'S EXPERIENCE HALLELUJAH GOD BROUGHT HIM DOWN TO A POINT WHERE IT WAS TOTALLY IMPOSSIBLE THERE WAS NOTHING THERE TO SUGGEST THAT WHAT GOD SAID WOULD HAVE BEEN BROUGHT TO PASS HALLELUJAH BUT YOU KNOW WHAT THE BIBLE SAID BUT THE BIBLE SAID ABRAHAM kept his his testimony HE KEEP ON BELIEVING ME, CHURCH. AND THE MORE IMPOSSIBLE IT BECOMES, THE MORE HE LEAN TOWARDS THE SUPERNATURAL, BELIEVING THAT THE GOD WHO MADE THE PROMISE IS MORE THAN ABLE TO BRING IT TO PASS. ARE YOU THERE, CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. AND SAY OUT OF THE IMPOSSIBLE WHEN SARAH WAS 90. HALLELUJAH. AND AND AND ABRAHAM WAS GOING INTO HIS 100. HALLELUJAH. GOD BROUGHT IT TO PASS. HALLELUJAH. BUT LET ME ASK A QUESTION. WHEN THE BIBLE SAID ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, WHAT DID HE REALLY BELIEVE? HELLO. PAUL SAID, "WHAT DID ABRAHAM FOUND?" HALLELUJAH. He found THE MIND OF CHRIST. HELLO. BECAUSE ISAAC WAS NOT THERE. But where was Isaac? ISAAC WAS IN THE MIND OF GOD. Are you there, my church? AND IT TOOK FAITH TO PULL THE SUPERNATURAL INTO THE NATURAL to make the supernatural made express. HALLELUJAH. PRAISE GOD. OH, GOD IS A SUPERNATURAL GOD. HALLELUJAH. BUT WHAT WAS HE DOING? And follow what I'm saying to you now. Hallelujah. Hopefully we can finish this story. Hallelujah. But what was he doing? HE WAS BRINGING HALLELUJAH. THE LIFE. IT WAS THE LIFE. HAL THE streak of life. IT WAS CHRIST. BROTHER said in Abraham, it was Christ in Noah. IT WAS CHRIST IN JOSHUA. BUT WHAT IT WAS CHURCH? IT WAS THAT LIFE. WHICH LIFE? ETERNAL LIFE. HALLELUJAH. ARE YOU WITH ME, CHURCH? IT WAS COMING DOWN. BROTHER MARK, IT WAS GOING AND EACH TIME WE REACH A DISPENSATION, THE SEED CATCH THE WORD FOR THAT DISPENSATION. ARE YOU THERE, CHURCH? AND MANIFEST THE PROMISE. HALLELUJAH. AND SO WE SEE CHRIST IN NOAH, CHRIST IN ABRAHAM. WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING? WATCH THE LIFE. DON'T LOOK AT THE PERSON. WATCH THE LIFE. ARE YOU THERE, MY CHURCH? BECAUSE WHEN THE LIFE COME, IT PRODUCES THE WORD. HALLELUJAH. So the life was moving along. Hallelujah. It was moving along. Hallelujah. But brother Bam used this word. HALLELUJAH. IN THE TOKEN MESSAGE brother said. But when the life comes, THE LIFE COMES THROUGH THE BLOOD. ARE YOU THERE, CHURCH? WHICH WE UNDERSTAND, BROTHER MARK, WHAT THE BLOOD IS. THE BLOOD IS NOT THE CHEMISTRY, BUT THE BLOOD IS THE WORD. ARE YOU THERE, CHURCH? AND SO THE PEOPLE, HALLELUJAH, the seed in the hedgeh, they receive the blood. IT'S A BLOODY WORD. THEY CATCH THE BLOOD FOR THE H. AND THE BLOOD THAT THEY CATCH PRODUCES THE LIFE. ARE YOU ME CHURCH? SO WE'RE ABLE TO WATCH THE BLOOD STREAK. UH IT'S A BLOOD STREAK ALL THE WAY FROM GENESIS. HALLELUJAH. WHAT THAT BLOOD PRODUCES? IT PRODUCED eternal life. CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. ALL THE WAY FROM GENESIS. HALLELUJAH. The life comes through the blood. It was Christ's life all the way. Hallelujah. It depending on what you're seeing. The Bible could be a good story book and it could be a story of the life, eternal life in word form. You know why it's important for you to see the life that was before? Because in your day, in your experience, you got to see Christ for your day. that you may experience the word the Christ as he unveiled for your day that you can manifest the word hallelujah for your day. That's why it has to come through the blood. Hallelujah. It got to come through the blood which is the word of God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So it's just to catch a glimpse of that life and step into that perfect life. Hallelujah. And it changes the person of who you are. Hallelujah. And so you I'm saying to your church, hallelujah. Hallelujah. If you hear his voice tonight, hallelujah, he's knocking at your door, h is trying to let you know that the reason WHY YOU'RE HERE IN CHURCH, you're here in church BECAUSE THE VOICE OF GOD IS HERE. AND THE VOICE OF GOD IS CALLING BACK TO YOU. HALLELUJAH. HE SAID TODAY IF YOU HEAR MY VOICE HE SAID HARDEN NOT YOUR HEART HE'S KNOCKING AT YOUR HEART'S DOOR BECAUSE HE WANT TO COME IN and he want to change IS YOUR EXPERIENCE THE VOICE OF GOD THAT ECHOES THE LIFE THAT SPEAK THE BLOOD THAT SPEAK IS KNOCKING AT YOUR DOOR HE WANTS TO BRING YOU OUT OF THIS MORTAL EXPERIENCE HALLELUJAH ARE YOU TIRED ARE YOU SICK THERE'S A VOICE HERE TONIGHT UH THAT CAN CHANGE YOUR EXPERIENCE HALLELUJAH BUT YOU GOT TO LET HIM IN. HE'S KNOCKING AT YOUR HEART DOOR AND YOU HAVE TO LET HIM IN. AND SO HE SAID, "TODAY, IF YOU HEAR MY VOICE, HARDEN NOT YOUR HEART." BUT YOU JUST OPEN THE DOOR A LITTLE BIT. HALLEL AND WHEN CHRIST COMES IN THE HOUSE, YOU KNOW WHAT HE DOES, BROTHER JOHN? He expresses himself. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And so when he comes and he knocks and he enters, you know, brother Ben said, and Paul in Romans 8, Paul said, For we know that the whole creation is groaning and travailing in pain together until now that not only they but ourself also which have received the first fruit of the spirit that's Christ that even we are ourselves are groaning within oursel waiting for the adoption to with the redemption of our bodies but said he said oh my oh my don't that make you old folks feel good. It ought to make us all feel good waiting for the hour. We understand that this will take place at the final resurrection. They say, "See, nature is groaning. We are groaning. Everything is groaning because we realize there's something not right. And the only way you can groan and wait for it is because there has been a new life come in here that speaks of a new world. Hallelujah. He said now these things that the groaning in our bodies he said did you notice the tree have it struggle for life. It was it want to live and you notice an animal in death how it struggles. And notice a human being everything nature is groaning. We in ourself are groaning. See we know there's something wrong. So see from these verses that something has been lost both to man and hurt. It says creation of all type has lost something. Hallelujah. He said for we see from this inspired word that there it is groaning for some reason. And when nature and people as the Bible said are groaning, it show is something that there's not in they're not in the ought to be condition. They have fallen from somewhere. So now we don't need anybody to interpret that for us. See, of course, we know it WAS ETERNAL LIFE THEY'RE falling from and they lost their claims on eternal life. But the fall of Adam and he who fell from eternal life to death in the Garden of Eden brought all nature under them to death. Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. But let let me say this to you church. Oh my. I'm coming down. Hallelujah. But let me say this to you now church. HALLELU. BUT GOD DID NOT just leave us empty. Yes, we experiencing TROUBLES AND AND TROUBLE. GOD DID NOT LEAVE US EMPTY, CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. He did not just LEAVE US TO WALK BY OURSEL BECAUSE HE PROMISED IT. HE SAID, "I WILL NOT LEAVE YOU NOR FORSAKE YOU. BUT I'M GOING TO BE WITH YOU EVEN TO THE ENDING OF THIS WORLD." ARE YOU THERE WITH ME, CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE NOW, HALLELUJAH, KNOW THAT ETERNITY IS CALLING. HALLELUJAH. WE GOT TO MOVE OUT OF JUST A MODE, THIS THIS EARTHLY MORTAL MODE. HALLELUJAH. WE GOT TO NOW CHANGE OUR APPROACH. WHY? BECAUSE ETERNITY IS CALLING AND THE GROANING IN OUR HEART IS GETTING LOUDER AND STRONGER. ARE YOU THERE CHURCH? IT'S GROANING FOR LIFE. HALLELUJAH. Eternal life uh eternal experiences. Oh my. Oh my. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So every now and then we have flashes of experiences. Hallelujah. AND I SAID, LORD, CAPABLE OF THE REVELATION OF YOURSELF, LORD GOD, WHATEVER CONDITION TONIGHT, LORD GOD, LET ME NOT JUST EXPERIENCE IT FROM A MORTAL STANDPOINT, BUT LORD GOD, LET ME STEP INTO THE ETERNAL STANDPOINT OF YOUR ETERNAL LIFE OF YOUR ETERNAL WORD. LORD, LET YOUR WORD LIVE IN ME. LET IT BE A LIVING EXPRESSION, A LIVING MANIFESTATION. LORD GOD, I WANT TO BE A VESSEL FOR YOU, A HOUSE FOR YOUR EXPRESSION. LORD, USE ME. HALLELUJAH. MANIFEST YOURSELF THROUGH ME, LORD. Use me, Lord. Use me, Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I think we just gone, you know. I think we there's a little bit more and we're finished. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You see the Bible said, hallelujah, under the bulls, the blood of bulls and goats, how God could not bring that life. He could not bring that eternal life. Hallelujah. Because it was under the shadow. And remember the shadow was type and shadow. IT WAS IT HAD DEATH IN IT, CHURCH. So it could not bring forth the life of God in its perfect order because it had shadow in it. to the blood of bulls and goats could not reach your heart. Are you there church? But one day, ONE DAY CHURCH, A PERFECT SACRIFICE CAME, a perfect blood that COULD CARRY THE LIFE OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. NOT IN YOUR BODY, NOT IN YOUR SPIRIT, BUT IN YOUR SOUL. HALLELUJAH. THE LIFE OF GOD. WHEN JESUS DIED AND THE B AND HE GAVE UP THE GHOST, WHERE DID IT GO TO? HALLELUJAH. THAT PART OF HIMSELF. UH HE WAS SEARCHING THE HURT LOOKING FOR THAT SEED. ARE YOU THERE WITH ME CHURCH? AND ONE DAY I HEARD A VOICE. HE CALLED MY NAME. I SAID, "SON, DAUGHTER, YOU BELONGS TO ME. YOU ARE MINE. ARE YOU THERE CHURCH? HALLELUJAH." IT'S LIKE AN eagle and he scream. HE SAID, "CHILD, COME OUT OF HER. COME OUT OF YOUR MORTAL SICKNESSES. Come out of your mortal sin AND COME BACK TO ME. ARE YOU THERE, CHURCH? THE VOICE OF GOD IS CALLING YOU TO DO WHAT? TO CHANGE YOUR EXPERIENCE. &gt;&gt; To change your experience. To bring something new to you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We just take one more verse. Second Timothy 1 verse 8. He said, "Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor for me is prisoner, but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God, who will save us and call us with an holy calling." You hear what the Bible said. He save us and he call us with an holy calling. Not according not according to our works and that is so important because church from an eternal STANDPOINT IS NOT WHAT YOU CAN DO IS NOT HOW SPIRITUAL YOU can become is not how anointing YOU CAN BECOME. ARE YOU THERE CHURCH? NO WONDER THE BIBLE SAID IT'S NOT BY MIGHT NOR IS IT BY POWER BUT BY MY SPIRIT SAY THE LORD. BROTHER BOB, THERE GOT TO COME A TIME WHEN THE BROTHER BOB GOT TO COME OUT OF THE PICTURE. IT'S NO LONGER YOU. ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. HE JUST CALLED YOU WITH AN ONLY CALLING FOR WHAT REASON? HALLELUJAH. TO BRING YOUR LIFE INTO A TRUE EXPERIENCE OF THE WORLD. HALLELUJAH. NOT BY YOUR OWN WORKS. NOT IT'S NOT ANYTHING SPIRITUAL THAT YOU PERFORM. BUT THE BIBLE SAID, "BUT ACCORDING to his own purpose and grace, which he has given us in Christ before the foundation of the world, but is now made manifested by the appearing of our Lord, of our Savior Jesus Christ, WHO WAS ABOLISHED DEATH AND HAS BROUGHT LIFE AND IMMORTALITY TO LIFE THROUGH THE GOSPEL." OH CHURCH, THE GOSPEL THAT YOU'RE HEARING TONIGHT, CHURCH, IT HAS A IT HAS A SPECIAL RECIPE OF ETERNAL LIFE OF ETERNAL INGREDIENTS. ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH? THAT WHEN YOU HEAR THE WORD, THE GOSPEL OF YOUR SALVATION, IT DOES SOMETHING TO YOUR HEART. ARE YOU ME CHURCH? IT MAKES YOU BECOME ALIVE. WHAT IS HAPPENING TO YOU? H THE ETERNAL LIFE BECOME AWAITING. ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. And you what I'M SAYING TO YOU? HALLELUJAH. ONCE THAT ETERNAL LIFE BECOME SPARKED, ONCE IT BECOME QUITTEN, CHURCH, it cannot BE STOPPED. THERE'S NO DEVIL IN HELL THAT CAN STOP IT. ARE YOU ME, CHURCH? THEY WILL TRY TO STOP YOU, BUT THEY WON'T PREVAIL. SATAN CANNOT PREVAIL. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. SATAN WON'T PREVAIL. WHY? BECAUSE IT'S CHRIST IN YOU. ARE you there, CHURCH? THE HOPE OF GLORY. THE BIBLE SAID GREATER IS HE THAT [clears throat] IS in you THAN HE THAT IS IN THIS WORLD. ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH? YOU CAN LOOK AT THE WORLD BUT CHURCH LET US TAKE UP THE VISION. LOOK ON THE ONE THAT is in you. Look at what he promised because everything that HE SAY IT GOT TO COME TO PASS. HALLELUJAH. So the revelation got to come through the blood. The blood of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And we saw a blood that could not produce, but he gave us a blood. Hallelujah. You will find later on as we go into this. You know, you'll find out that that the bride received the blood for a day, the message of the hour through which the life of God will come. Hallelujah. A perfect revelation. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. And so Jesus said, Hallelujah. I got to quote this one before I leave. In St. John 14, Jesus said, "And I will pray the Father that he will give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever, even the Spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive." Because it sat him not, neither knoweth him. But you know him, church. Church, you know him. You know him, church. For he dwelleth with you and shall be in you, and I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you. Hallelujah. Praise God. It's a YET A LITTLE WHILE AND the world see me no more, but you shall SEE ME. OH MY CHURCH. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT? HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE ENEMY IS DOING. HE'S TRYING TO PULL YOU BACK INTO THIS MORTAL LIFE AND YOU'RE TRYING TO FIND GOD THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE. BUT LET ME TELL YOU THIS CHURCH, I HAVE BEEN THERE. I KNOW WHAT THE DEVIL DOES. HE TRIED TO BUG YOU DOWN WITH LIFE CONDITION. HE TRIED TO BUG YOU DOWN WITH SICKNESS. BUT CHURCH, HALLELUJAH, EVERY TIME HE COMES, POINTING BACK TO THE SCRIPTURE, POINTING BACK TO WHAT GOD SAY ABOUT YOUR LIFE. IF YOU ARE SICK TONIGHT, THE BIBLE SAY HE WAS WOUNDED FOR YOUR TRANSGRESSION. HE WAS BRUISED FOR YOUR INIQUITY. THE CHASTISEMENT OF YOUR PEACE IS UPON HIM. AND BY HIS STRIPE IS YOU ALREADY HEALED. Are you there ME CHURCH? THAT'S GOD'S PROMISED word to you. And it got to come alive. It got to come alive. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. The revelation of God comes through the blood. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And so the Bible said in closing, I promise I close now. And so the Bible said, hallelujah. And so there got to come a time in our earthly journey, in our earthly experience. You see, because we are covered with mortality on our mortal experience. The Bible said there got to come a time, h when this mortal life got to be swallowed up, hallelujah, into immortality. In other words, Paul said, "Let me show you a mystery. We shall not all sleep. Yes, we all will be tried. SOME OF US, BROTHER MARK, WILL NOT MAKE IT OVER, BUT by reason of witnesses, and that's all fine if the believer go to sleep. But let me say THIS TO YOU, CHURCH. NOT ALL OF US TONIGHT. THEN YOU SEE SIT HERE." HALLELUJAH. NOT ALL OF US WILL FALL ASLEEP. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, BUT WE ALL SHALL BE CHANGED. FOR PAUL SAID, "BEHOLD, I SHOW YOU A MYSTERY." HALLELUJAH. FOR THIS MORTAL, THIS MORTAL, COME ON CHURCH. HERE IT IS. THIS MORTAL. HALLELUJAH. NOT JUST THE BODY, BUT THE ENTIRE MAN OF WHO YOU ARE MUST PUT ON IMMORTALITY. HALLELUJAH. ARE YOU ARE YOU ME CHURCH? IN OTHER WORDS, GOD THROUGH YOUR HURTLY EXPERIENCE IS IMMORTALIZING YOU. YOU HAVE BECOME IMMORTAL AND LITTLE BY LITTLE YOU'RE FEELING the effect OF IMMORTALITY RISING TO YOUR BODY, RAISING TO EXPERIENCE. IS GOD DOING THE WORK OF GRACE UPON YOUR LIFE? We are being immortalized by the gospel. We are being moved transferred out of mortal life into immortal life. And just as how you see this a battle, this is a battle. It is a battle. And you'll accept your five senses say it's a battle. And you know it's a battle. But just as you can affirm that the life of God will affirm the things of God that it's much real than anything that you have ever experienced. And we are drawn into something that is bigger and greater than ourselves about the kingdom. Hallelujah. Church of the living God. It is the story of your life. What the script is saying about you tonight that you're more than conqueror through him who have loved you. What the script is saying tonight that God have already wrote the script concerning your life. And God is saying you are my children. You're my child rather and you belong to me. Church of the living God. Hallelujah. The story of your life. Hallelujah. It didn't start. It start here but it didn't finish here. Hallelujah. One day, one day. Hallelujah. God is going to take us out of this mortal life. Hallelujah. By the mortal experiences. You don't you talk about divine healing. You haven't seen anything yet. Hallelujah. You you listen the experience is going to get so real, so real until one morning, brother John, between 6:00 to 9, it's going to be LIKE LIKE YOU JUST like like Enoch is just WALKING AND YOU STEP OFF THE HURT. IT GOING TO BECOME SO REAL. BUT CHURCH, I'm saying this to you. It is real. I HAVE EXPERIENCED IT. It is real. Oh my. Oh my. I know. I just give one more minute. Listen. HALLELUJAH. 2008 THE DOCTOR TOLD ME THAT I WILL NOT BE BE HERE. THEY TOLD me they go AS FAR AS TELLING ME how to tell my wife to TO TO MOVE ON WITH HER LIFE BECAUSE I WILL NOT BE HERE. And when he said that to me, I said you uncircumcised Philistine making a claim upon the son OF GOD. I SAID ALL THAT YOU SAID TO ME, I DENOUNCE IT AND HERE AM I 2025. OH CHURCH, IT'S THE REALITY OF GOD'S WORD IS MORE THAN ABLE TO DO WHAT HE SAID. For every word is yeah and amen. HALLELUJAH. GOD IS GREAT and greatly to be praised. God bless you tonight. Oh my. Hallelujah. Thank you. Thought I was going to have to pull the plug there. Oh, amen. I so enjoyed that. I wasn't going to take the pulpit. I was going to let brother Bob take it. But you know, he it struck me as he was talking there and he was talking about at the end he says they're going to pull out the books. But there's a book of works and everyone else is judged by the book of works. And then based on what they did, he takes their name and he either scratches it out of the book of life or he circles it. But there's a chapter within the book of life where there is a people who are not judged by their works. And the scripture says whose names were written in the book of life before the foundation of the world that cannot be taken away. Everyone else was living their life. But within that chapter of the Lamb's Book of Life, there's a people that were living the story he wrote about them before the world ever began. And how did you know it was you? Because he called your name. He came and talked to you. How did Abraham know he was a child of God? God came and talked to him. And God told him, he says, "I've chosen you. I've got a promise for you. I've got a land for you. I've got a place for you. I've got a purpose for you." And then he said, "Walk." And Abraham walked for 25 years before he ever got a promised son. A 100 years old when he had Isaac. Completely impossible. Completely impossible. I love how he said it. He caught the mind of God. He wasn't believing in a son. He was believing in the word of God that had Isaac declared to be a part of his life before the foundation of the world. Amen. That's what it is when he comes to us is he's calling our name and he's saying, "I've already written the script." And you know what we say? We look at our mistakes. Look at Abraham. I've said this before. You look at Abraham's life full of mistakes. But he started to read it in Hebrews 11. Hebrews 11 is the faith chapter. Hebrews 11 is the book of life chapter. And when God reads Abraham's story into the Bible, he says, "By faith, by faith, by faith, by faith, no mistakes, no doubts, no wandering, no lies, no half- lives, no ups, no downs." He says, "By faith." Why? Through the blood. The word only is all he can see expressed in his life. Amen. Isn't that a wonderful thing? &gt;&gt; Don't just talk about Abraham now. It's for the bride. It's for the true believer. When he looks at us, he sees the word that he's declared about us before time began. And that's all he's looking for. The rest of it is under the blood. All he can see is that perfect faith that's coming forth. Amen. Let's stand together if we would. We're going to sing that song. He knows my name. Amen. And I have a maker. [music] He for my heart. And before even time began, my [singing] life was in his hands. [music] And he knows my name. [music] He knows my every [singing and music] thought. He sees each [music and singing] tear that falls and he hears me when I call. [music] Oh, I have a father. [music] He calls me his [music] own. And he'll [singing] never leave [music] me, no matter where I [music] go. And he [music] knows my [singing] name. [music] He knows my [singing] every thought. He sees [music] each tear that falls. And [music] he hears me when I [singing] call. And I [music] have a [singing] maker [music] before my [singing] heart. [music] And before even time [music] began, my life was in his hands. [music] And he knows my name. He [music] knows my [singing] every thought. And he sees [music] each tear that falls. And he hears me when [music] I [singing] call. [music] And I have a father [music] and he calls me his own. And [music] he'll never [singing] leave me, no matter [music] where I go. And he knows [music] my name. He knows [music] my [singing] every thought. He [music] sees each tear that falls. And he hears [music] me when I call. Draw me. Draw me Lord. 11:48. Sorry, that's not it. The other draw me. You alone are all I need. [music] For you hold my destiny. You alone are all I need. [music] In you alone who I am complete. [music] to draw me. [music] Draw me Lord and [music] I'll come running after you. [music] Draw me. Draw me, Lord, [music] and I'll come running after you. For you alone are all I need. [music] For you hold my destiny. [music] You alone [singing] are all I need. [music] In you alone [singing] I am complete. [music] So draw [singing and music] me, draw me, Lord, [music] and I'll come running after you. So draw [music and singing] me, draw me, Lord, [music] and I'll [singing] come running after you. [music] Draw me, draw me. So draw me, [music] draw me, Lord, and I'll come running after [music] you. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; So draw me, draw me, Lord, and I'll [music] come running after you. Amen. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly Father, Lord, I feel like we've looked into eternity tonight, Lord. And it's a wonderful thing to look there and see ourselves. Not because of what we've done, what we are, what we've chosen, Lord, but because in the before time even began, Lord, you said, "I'm going to have a family. I am a family, Lord. And you said, I'm going to let that life go out and it's going to produce me over and over and over again, Lord." And that's this Christian walk that we have, Lord. Lord, it's not just people, but it's life. It's your life coming through, Lord. And yes, we drop away and this one passes and that one, Lord, but that life just keeps coming back and back, Lord, expressing itself over and over again, Lord. And that's our prayer, our heart's desire, Lord, as we leave this building tonight and go back, Lord, into, Lord, our day-to-day lives, Lord. May it not be day-to-day life, Lord. May it be your eternal life being expressed through us, Lord. The things we say, the things we don't, the things we do, the things we don't, Lord. The things we wear, the things we listen to, Lord, the things we read, the things we watch. Lord, our conversations, Lord, our very thoughts, Lord, may they circle around the eternal word, Lord, that brings us back to you tonight. Lord, I pray for all these needs we've had. Lord, there's many sick. Lord, there's many away from us tonight. Lord, we pray your mercy and grace to them. Each one, Lord, we pray especially, Lord, for Mary Rouso, Lord, on death's bed. Lord, she's seeking your peace. Lord, I pray you go to her tonight, Lord. Pray in your grace for each one, Lord. Bless our brother Garfield, Lord, as he goes home tonight. Lord, may you just restore strength to him, Lord. Fill him with your spirit, Lord. Give him another message for us. We pray, heavenly father. Lord, just go with us now, we ask. We commit all these things into your hands. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; You are [music] here. You are [music] the [music] You are here to [music] stay. You [music] are here. How you [music] waiting for my [music] Holy Spirit [music] of you? We are changed [music] [music] [music] in your [music] name. We can see your presence. [music] [music] You are [music] wonderful. [music] [music] [music] You are [music] happy.

We are [music] Prais. [music] of the Lord. So [music] let my life now [music] come to bring all [music] that [music] to me.
