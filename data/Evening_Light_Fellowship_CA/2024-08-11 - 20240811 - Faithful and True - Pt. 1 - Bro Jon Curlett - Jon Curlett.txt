few announcements here brother Carmen Mills will be coming up from New Brunswick to speak for us on September 15 while I'm away in Edmonton and then brother Max Bang from Edmonton will come up to speak for us on September 22nd we know brother Carman of course assistant pastor to brother Ivan Carr but brother Max will be a new flavor for you and he's about this tall but he's about this tall in the Lord amen so he's a firecracker he's a real evangelist a young man that's been preaching for quite a while now and we're just trusting the Lord to bring him up and and give a blessing to the church so you keep them in prayer keep the camp meetings coming up in prayer as well that God would prepare brother Aron Oglesby just give him a message for the people and that we come in with great expectation amen God bless you Isaiah 55 and verse 6 says seek ye the Lord while he may be found call upon him while he is near you know there's a time and a season for God's mercy amen it's it's not all the time but there's a time for it and the time to take it is right now amen the scripture says today is the day of salvation you know they watched Noah's Ministry and they saw that door the ark was open until one day it wasn't and it wasn't Noah that closed it cuz our Humanity we keep it open forever but God has a time and a season and when he says it's open it's open and that's the time to get in and when he closes it it's too late and he can't open it it's done it's a finished work then he says let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord you know it says return you used to but you're not now he says and he will have mercy upon Him Praise the Lord and to our God for he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but WTH the Earth and maketh it bring forth fruit and maketh it bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the S and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whet I sent it amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and as you might imagine we are not continuing on our series on the Holy Ghost we started one and you know me I'm I like to get in a Groove and just go but the Lord has led me in a different direction this morning this is actually something I've I've studied for quite some time it's been sitting in my notes notes folder for three years and it was something brother Lonnie Jenkins spoke on and it just kind of opened up to me and I felt that I would take that this morning so I just want to take a service this morning maybe on Wednesday as well on this thought faithful and true amen faithful and true and we'll go back to our opening scripture where he says and this is God speaking now he says for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways sayeth the Lord now catch something here cuz God's trying to show us something that's what I love about the word is God's Not trying to hide something he's trying to show us something he's trying to open our eyes and he's trying to show how his thoughts are different than our thoughts and how his ways are different than our ways see we want God to do it the way we do it but God says I can't do it your way because your way doesn't work I've got my way and my ways are different than yours so he's trying to get us to catch the way he does it so we can get in line with it so we can see it so we can receive it rather than be stuck in our own stinking thinking amen he says for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts I don't care if you take the highest peak on this Earth you go to Mount Everest that's the highest point of Earth directly above that is the heavens no matter how high we get God's always higher no matter how spiritual we get no matter how great our Revelation is our education our learning learning our experience we can never attain to what God thinks and the way God does things his ways are beyond our understanding they're beyond our searching but he's trying to get us to grasp it in some way to this morning amen but we cannot attain to them by anything that we do or think amen we can't even approach the word of God with our thoughts my wife and I were talking about this on our walk yesterday and I I I was I was um watching a guy that said you know if if you want to study the word you've got to know I think the word is human etics and the first thing that came to me is I wonder what PE Peter thought about human etics when he was preaching on the day of Pentecost Paul had to forget his human etics he had to forget everything because it's man's thinking we think we're trying to we're trying by by sincerity we're trying to understand the word of God but one thing I found is you cannot preach this word without Revelation you can study till you're blue in the face and don't ever stop studying but it takes God to Quicken this word and open it up to the reality and the prophet of God said God interprets his word by bringing it to pass and let me show you where human etics has gotten them denomination that means it ain't found in human etics doesn't mean it's wrong doesn't mean it doesn't have its place but the study of the scriptures comes through the opening of the word to the person by the Holy Spirit and that's the way that God works in these things the the great mystery of the word is how God does it and everybody misses it for all their study for all their expectation for all their believing for all their teaching yet people miss it every single time and let me tell you we're in the season where we cannot miss it and here's the thing I'm here to tell you today we will not miss it praise the Lord he's faithful and true he won't let us miss it but even in Jesus day the disciples are there and they're seeing the word fulfilled they're seeing the word in flesh and they don't have a clue of what's going on and the scripture says he told them everything was going to happen and yet they understood it not and it's only after it's happened that they start to place the events of their life the events of Jesus into the scriptures and they start to realize it's already happened but that awakened them to the season they were in now praise the lord we might miss it but it won't hold us back we'll catch up eventually and we see that as soon as they catch where they are then they realize that there's more ahead and they put themselves in the season in the time of God and they step into it and they become a part of it but God help us set aside our preconceived notions this evening there this morning amen about the way that God's got to do things or the way God's going to do things listen I can't ever presume to know how he's going to do it but I am learning to trust amen and to see the glimpses and in those glimpses to have faith that picks up and says he's working I'm seeing just a little bit here I'm just seeing a little bit there but that's enough for Faith to spark up and I say he's moving God's on the Move God's doing something brother bam says it this way he says God has two ways in all things and that's the right way and a wrong way and your way and my way is the wrong way prophet of God says this he says my way is the wrong way and your way is the wrong way he says God's way is always the right way no matter how unright it seems to us yet God's ways are true and right and then he says these words their past understanding go explain job's experience to me how that would ever make sense to us why did Abraham and Sarah have to wait 255 years why did women have to have their children torn from them and people saw an aunder like Isaiah why it's all past our understanding but he knows all things he says they're past understanding but God works in mysterious ways his wonders to perform now I say that and we just got a bunch of amens but I want to ask you this morning when we think about it that way the question I've got to ask myself and you've got to ask yourself is am I trying to tell God how to do things because remember my ways are always wrong and his ways are always right the only time my ways are right is when my way becomes his way so the answer is not should I tell him what to do my answer ought to be Lord show me what you want done so I can get in line so I can get out of your way so I can get in the channel I can put my shoulder to the wheel and be a help rather than a hindrance in my daily life amen it's so spiritual in church we say amens one wonderfully in church don't we but we walk out the door and then the question is will we be as spiritual there as we are here this morning amen will we tell God what to do cuz he does all things well you and I not so much not so much amen we make a hash out of things it's a dog's breakfast when we're done brother Bob shared a quote with me this this week and and it was right in it slid right into these notes that I have perfectly you know don't ever be scared to share a scripture or quote with me you know why I love it one it helps me it encourages me but two it lets me know that you're reading and you're listening yourself because the growth that you get in these services for a couple of hours a week is not your major growth this is just little points to help get you along the way but that daytoday relationship with Christ that day-to-day reading and feeding on the word that's where the greatest growth is going to come dayto day that's where your Victory comes is that day-to-day relationship with Christ that you have don't ever think you're trying to influence me I love it I love it when somebody comes up and says Hey Brother John look at what a look at what I read this morning look at this just jumped out of me and I say praise the Lord praise the Lord but he sent me this quote and it says this we were speaking the other night on how the seed must die and everything around that germ of Life must not only die but rot but rot he says if it doesn't rot it cannot live see when you look at a seed it's there and it's in this nice tight sealed package and nothing can get in but the process of Life requires rotting first because the rot of that seed gives it the first bit of nutrients to grow into what it's supposed to be he says it it if it doesn't rot it cannot rot live and rot is completely done away with it's finished and until we get to the place that our own ideas and our own thinking are completely gone and it's rotted away from us then the germ of Life can begin to live amen we've got to completely lay aside the mind that we have the thoughts that we have the opinions that we have the ways that we would do it completely because God's got a different plan than ours guaranteed guaranteed he says the same thing as arrived again and Men won't believe people won't believe churches won't believe no wonder he says you can't be disappointed in it because the Bible said they wouldn't do it but it's you individuals you that's ordained to life he says look upon the fields now and see what hour we're living in he says come to life let the life that was in Christ come to you come in you he says the mind you said oh I think this I think this you ain't got no thought coming you let the thoughts that were in Christ be in you and what are those thoughts he says that's the word he says that's right think the thoughts that he thought he continues again he says you haven't got no thought coming are we getting in the picture this morning lay aside everything those are the things that easily beset us I think is our own thoughts and our own ideas he says you ain't got no thought coming it's what he said you deny your thinking he says you just say what he says that's really confession confession means to say the same thing he says if I confess that a certain thing taken place I say the same thing that took place that's what real confession is and he says he's the high priest of our confessions see saying the same thing God said see that makes it right cuz you're just repeating God's word amen remember we've read we've said this scripture so many times that they overcame by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony when our testimony lines up with the word of God then that's something that's going to happen and mean that's something that's real that's something that's truth that's something that's life is when we say what he's already said it's prophecy when it comes out of our mouth because it's his and it comes into us now and we're saying the same thing that he said I say God help us to think his thoughts this morning amen God and he says the only way we can do that is that we repeat the word of God too often we're sitting there trying to Hash through the situation rather than say what does the word of God say about my situation because if we focus on the word it'll give us faith if we focus on the circumstances it'll rear up our mind and our education and our logic and our reason and it'll put Faith completely aside and replace it with what the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and it never takes us anywhere good but God says here my ways are not your ways they way higher my thoughts are your not your thoughts they're way higher too and if we look in Isaiah and we continue here he shows us how his thoughts work and how his ways work so what he's trying to do is show us how the word Works he says for as the rain he's he's doing a simile here he's making a comparison for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither so in other words the rain and the snow come down in one form and they don't go up as rain and snow they come down and they stay down now we know today we have evaporation but he's saying God doesn't send it down and then just take it away he says it comes down and it stays there and it soaks the Earth he says it returns not thither but it WTH the Earth and maketh it bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the S and bread to the eater he says as the rain does that and it does this process so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it so this is the cycle of the word of God being revealed here God's trying to show us so we can see in our lives now when we take the word how that's going to work because we think today that everything's got to be immediate I take the word and it happens no he says the word is a cycle there's a proc process that goes with this so many times and there's a mystery and he says the word is like as rain and snow that come down from heaven we talk about washing of Water by the word the water is the word of God and we know that water is life water is life and when it comes to plants which is what he's comparing us to without water the plants will perish and with little water what do plants become spiky spiky you tell if you're around people that are grumpy all the time that have no joy that have no peace that can't say a good thing you know what the problem is church they haven't been sitting under a raincloud they haven't gotten any water they haven't gotten into the presence of God and it's just a little bit but you'll notice even a cactus blooms occasionally but it's spiky the rest of the time we ought not to be cacti this morning amen we ought to be getting into the presence of God but notice the presence of God the word of God is like rain and snow but here's the thing you've got to have something good in you for it to do any good for you remember brother Bram he he was wondering about false anointed ones and he that that man that had a gift of of tongues and another one that had interpretation and one of them lived a good cream clean Christian Life and the other one was cheating on his wife and he said God how does that work and he says in this scripture Kingdom that the the rain falls on the just and the unjust the weeds love the presence of God just as much as the fruit tree does but what's the what what is it doing in one it's bringing in both of them it's bringing forth what they are but the presence doesn't change the weed into a fruit tree it's still a weed and it still enjoys the rain but it doesn't change it what is it doing it's bringing out what's in you already that's what the word does and because some people read this and they reject it and what does it do it brings out damnation and judgment and there others will read it and it brings forth life eternal life and joy and love abundantly it's the same it has a completely different thing that it brings out but what's the intended purpose of this cuz remember the rain doesn't change who you are the presence of God doesn't change who you are you either are a child of God or you are not a child of God it's that simple but the purpose of the rain and snow is to water the Earth and what does that represent the Earth represents us you go to Matthew 13 the two Parables there we are the good ground and we are the good seed amen the water of the thoughts of God of the ways of God which is his word is now poured out on on Flesh on Earth to make it do what what does this do it makes it bring forth and Bud in other words it produces the conditions to bring out what's already there like we said the rain doesn't change you but it brings out what's in each and every one of us amen it'll produce what's inside that plant you'll find that plants that have lots of water produce lots of fruit lots of Blossom lots of blooms you go down into the into the rainforest those things they never stop blooming they've got so much nutrition so much water they just give and give and give and Blossom and Blossom and the trees go massively if you've been to British Columbia it's the same thing it it's a northern uh rainforest they have there and the trees will goow grow a foot foot and a half two foot a year in Newland we get about three inches a year why cuz we don't have the soil but we did we got the rain something else is wrong but BC they've got perfect conditions they have all that rain and these trees just grow massively massively why because they don't have to hold back they don't have to worry they don't have to wonder where their next meal is coming from they just drink in everything they've got every day and they just push it out push it out push it out amen why do they do it because there's no lack in them people that don't give you know what the problem is they don't have anything in them to give they're too worried about where their next meal's coming from where their next Revival's coming from and dayto day they're missing that day to-day watering that's supposed to be happening as as Believers amen but you run into people and they just give of themselves and give of themselves and it seems like they can absorb punishment they can handle this and they can handle that why they're drinking from an inexhaustible Fountain they've tapped into the River of Life amen why they know it's never going to go away remember what Jesus said we read this in a couple services go but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst but the water that I give him shall be where in him it's inside of you he says it shall be in him a well of water springing up unto everlasting life we go to David in Psalms 34 he says the angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear Him and deliver them he says oh taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him oh fear the lord ye his Saints for there is no want that means there's lacking they're lacking nothing there's no want to them that fear Him the Young Lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek the Lord shall not want they shall not lack any good thing you need something good from God you've got access to it this morning amen if you seek Him First David says this Psalms 1 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners and we all said three amens my wife and I were talking about this scripture yesterday on our walk we say Amen to those first two portions but then he says nor sth in the seat of the scornful you know what's scornful pride pride I'm better than he is I'm better than she is I got more than they do what are they going on about they don't have anything remember when brother Bram tells that story about those I believe it was two sisters I'm paraphrasing here forgive me if I get the details uh not quite right but I believe it it was early in his in his in his Christian experience and he's at that meeting and I believe it was two sisters started dancing in the aisle and you know where brother brandham sat in the seed of the scornful and he was in his mind he was putting him down and what did the Lord say to him he says if you had what they had you'd do what they do you know what we'll sit here here and somebody might start shouting somebody might start praising and we look into their lives and say but they're barely a Christian well if they can Shout with the little they have what's keeping us in our seats this morning amen if they can Shout with what the little that they've got what's holding us back it's we're sitting in the seat of the scornful amen we ought to be free and when somebody gets any lick of freedom and they express it we ought to be right there you know I've been watching clips of the Olympics and last night the United States basketball W gold and they're about 15 seconds from the end and it was at that point that that the player that had made the most impact that game he did this symbol where he said this and it was nighty night as in it's all over and he started shouting and he started dancing around and he started screaming because he knew it was finished and yet we can sit in our seats and nothing nothing expressed and we've got the liberty of the Holy Ghost ghost in our midst amen if they can do it over a stupid basketball game that everybody's going to forget within the next couple of months what are we to do with eternal life flowing through our bodies freeing us from our flesh freeing us from our past freeing us from family traditions free freeing us from our own thinking anden we ought to be able to worship him this morning I'm not giving you a hard time I'm saying we ought to be able to amen not sitting in the seat of the scornful let the Holy Spirit have its freedom in your life he says but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law do he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season now catch this he says his Leaf shall not wither when we're planted we don't have to go through Seasons where the fruit of the holy spirit is not there if we're drinking every single day his Leaf shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper coming back to Isaiah he says for he's talking about the effect of this now as the rain comes down the snow from Heavens returns not thither it Waters the Earth and makes it bring forth in Bud what is the purpose of it bringing forth and giving Bud he says that it may give seed to the S and bread to the eater now who is the S it's Christ that's the son of man again you go back to Matthew 13 what's he doing why is God blessing us why is God producing something in us why is God giving us the word and then manifesting the word in our life first of all to give back to him to give back to him he said freely you've received now freely give but catch this now it's not just it's not just to take his blessings or his Mercy or his grace or his promises but as we've received them now we give them to somebody else if God has healed you you know what you do you give a testimony so somebody else can grab onto that faith and get a healing themselves if you've been provided for then you can say you can go around and say God provides he's Jehovah Gyra so somebody else can get that man I so appreciate our visitors coming in and they sing a song and it's right in line with the service this morning God bless you God bless you richly for that they took because it's not just it's not just healings and Gifts it's not just money it's taking everything that God has given you for his glory and now using it for his glory and giving it back to him whether you're on vacation or whether you're at your post of Duty at home God bless you each one for doing that we don't have to preach to share this gospel amen the gospel is not a Doctrine the gospel is a life and every single one of us has a Life by the Holy Spirit that's in us and when that word is alive in us it can't help but produce something the fruit of the spirit is life it is love and joy and peace and patience in these things and so as we're walking through life the problem so many times times churches that were trying to explain it rather than just be it I saw sister Rebecca LaFontaine posted this thinging that said the world's not reading their Bibles they're reading you we're the only word that they're ever going to see and so we don't have to sit there explain it cuz they won't understand the explanation but they'll understand the impact cuz they may not understand why it works but they see in our life that it does work and then by God's grace they might say I want some of that God help me to have that amen our job is to produce fruit not explain how it happens cuz we can't we can't explain how it happens Church you tell me how you got delivered you tell me how you broke a family cycle you tell me how you came out from under a Catholic mushroom brother Mark you can't do it it just happened the third poll can't be explained remember they're in that little room and one goes in and he's got a short leg and he comes out and his leg is the same size the other one what happened I don't know all I know is it happened we're here to say it works taste and see I've tasted I can see you can see now it's time for you to taste and see if it works for you as well amen our our our lives are here to show what happens when you drink from an inexhaustible Fountain of the Living Word of God Amen seed to the sewer and bread to the eater it's to feed those around us it's to not it's not to serve or to to be served it's to serve amen it's not to receive you've already received you got your portion you're sealed to the day of your Redemption you have the the eternal life of God the Zoey life of God on the inside you have your reward now it's time for you to give to others remember the fruit on the tree is not for the tree it's for the the one that passes by and then we we we begrudge people when they take our fruit of patience that's what it's there for is to be used not to be looked at to be used when somebody tries to take joy from us guess what we to say it's okay I got more where that came from I've got something the world can't give and the world can't take it away I've got an inexhaustible Fountain springing up within me that'll produce some more tomorrow amen hallelujah can I say it this way you want to know what's in somebody give them everything they have need of and see what they do with it give them a blessing give them a gift give them a calling give them a position give them all the money they need and see what they do with it because if what they turn to is themselves there's a problem but if they can take that and they can put it back into the kingdom of God not to raise up their image not to make life the easiest but rather take it and say Lord what would you have your servant to do and then use it for its Kingdom Purpose that's when you know that God will keep blessing them it's really hard to be rich and serve God I think that's the reason why most of us aren't Rich It's Not Meant For Us amen our wealth is waiting for us you want to know what's on the inside give somebody a lot and see what they do with it because if they keep giving you know there's a reality there if they keep holding on to it that's not God I was reading in Ezekiel 34 the other day in my devotions and God was just blasting the pastors of that day the Shepherds of that day because they were taking everything they needed and the only thing they give back he said listen you you you don't just take everything but you don't go seek the lost you don't help the diseased you don't fix the ones that are broken you're not doing anything you're just take take Taking he said and then what you give them is the grass that you've trod under your feet into the mud and the water you give them has been soiled from you walking around in it and getting your good out of it and he says I'll destroy you and I'll make them sheep of my pasture and I'll feed them what they need they were 100% selfish seeking only their own benefit but if you're planted by the rivers of God if you're planted by the the living word when he sends something to you you'll produce something that is meant for somebody else amen your provision is in God I ain't providing for myself sure I've got a degree I've got an education I've got all these things but hey like I said before God has given me Grace where I didn't deserve it where others were more deserving but he gave to me because he knew that he could trust me with it it's the same thing for you if God can trust you with it he'll give it to you that's just the way he works Ecclesiastes 11 says cast thy breath bread upon the waters for Thou shalt find it after many days you go to the Amplified it says freely give your things to other people if you do that one day you will receive your things back now he's talking about this is really the law of the Harvest in one big sc one little scripture and that's that the word must be fulfilled because what we're giving out is not things what we're giving out is the word life that we have we're offering it to every single one that's going by so if you give out bad things you'll get bad things back you give out good things you'll get good things back you give a good testimony out you'll get a good testimony back you give a bad testimony out you'll get a bad testimony back but you got to see this he says he cast it upon the Water a a and and it'll produce something one day many days it says see we're talking about Cycles it's not I'm going to put it out today and tomorrow I get it oh I'm going to give a witness to my coworker and tomorrow they'll come in no no no no no this is a cycle it's many days it's a long game God's in it for the long game amen he says Thou shalt find it after many days you'll get back what you gave out why because the word cannot return void now you look in the scriptures and Waters always represents people notice it doesn't say water Waters everyone not just the people that like you not just the people in the church not just the ones that treat you nice those aren't the ones that need it the most they've got their own Supply by God's grace but it's the ones that don't don't have anything that are coming to eat from you that's why they eat from you is because they don't have any themselves those are the ones amen listen we had to be converted to serve Christ and everyone that's taking of our fruit needs to be converted the same way we do somebody had to be kind to us somebody had to be loving to us somebody had to give us time and patience and all of these things so that we could come to Christ somebody had to have consideration for us above their own needs and we've got to be able to do the same thing these people that are taking our fruit aren't necessarily going to be loving perfect appreciative come on people don't appreciate it much when Christians do stuff they just take it and run a lot of times and we've got to be okay with that because we've got more fruit to give every single day because we're in the presence of God feeding from the word of God Amen that never stops US people's response ought never to stop us from keeping on giving but we get burned and our our emotions flare up and we get offended and we get hurt but that's not the way it's supposed to work Braham says this he says that's why I want to put all my life for the Lord Jesus everything that I can do for him and I can only serve him as I serve his people you can only love him as you love each other I can only love him as I love you and you love me and together we love God and we become his children in that I serve you you serve me and that's we're serving God Jesus said in so much as you have done it unto the least of these little ones you've did it to me he says so if we want want a blessing let's be a blessing to someone else and a blessing will return anybody needing a blessing this morning another four you guys are doing good only four of you need a blessing for you four be a blessing you want your blessing go be a blessing see two any times when we're in need Our intention is let's go for me let's do everything to satisfy my need and he's saying no no no somebody out there is casting your need out on the waters you wait it'll come right to you you give remember that wi old woman came up and she gave those two mites we've read the quote a and in our hearts every one of us if we knew that that was her we didn't know Jesus knew it was her last two bit two pieces of money we wouldn't know that but even in not knowing that if a widow woman came up this morning a single sister came up and said here's everything I have I want to give it for me misss we'd say sister we don't need it we don't need it you hold on to it and God bless you for your willing heart and brother Braham says Jesus didn't stop her why because he knew what was coming down the road for her in response to the faith and the Willing heart that she had Hallelujah she cast her bread upon the water and something came back and I believe we'll find out in eternity what that was I think she's going to have a wonderful testimony in my one want I gave anyways and he supplied my every need if you want a blessing let's be a blessing to someone else and a blessing will return like casting your bread upon the Water it'll return that's true in all walks of life you'll find that he doesn't just say Christian he doesn't just say in the church he says in every aspect do this and you'll find you get something back he says you usually reap just as you sow so let's do good talk good and be kind and he says and people talk about us we'll say good things and kind things and good things will come our way if we give them out can we say Amen to that but can we say Amen when we walk out the doors because guess what not everybody's kind to us even professing Believers aren't always kind to us and what are we going to do are we going to stand back and say they ought to know better they ought to be more mature than that they ought to be further ahead or ought we to say kind things about that brother and sister and go into our prayer closet and say Lord help them Lord forgive them and Lord keep my attitude right in their shallowness right now maybe they're in a spot where they're a bit dried out that ought to put us in prayer on our knees not in offense Before the Throne of God saying Smite them Lord amen listen people get jealous people don't like it when we stand up and we refuse to compromise even within this message listen there's some things people do that I don't agree with in this message and they don't like it if I say I don't agree with with it but that doesn't mean I just give in and they might say things they might call me legalistic they might call me you know stick in the mud whatever it is young people you know what it's like you go off and you're on your phones and somebody wants to show you this and show you that we ought to be able to say we ought not to be looking at this kind of stuff what are you doing I don't want to see that what makes you think I want to see that and people will get offended because we stand up for our conscience for what the Holy Ghost would prick us there amen our chance our opportunity is in those moments when it's not going the way we like when people don't like it that's our chance in love in humility in meekness to express the hope that lies within us that's our opportunity he says so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void we ought to be able to shout over that scripture this morning if you're believing if you're resting in the word of God he says it shall not return unto me void he says remember my words they're not like yours my thoughts aren't your ways my ways are not your ways it's in a cycle amen they start with rain coming down and then that rain has an effect that causes things to come out inside of people and then it produces something that benefits others but here's the thing church he says it always works it always works he did not give us a time on this but he says it shall not return unto me void he's saying here's the promise behind everything when I think it and then I say it it will happen it has to happen it's going to happen though it seems like it's not happening it is going to happen that's the promise we're resting on this morning he says it shall not return to me void that word void means it shall not be without effect it shall not be empty it shall not be pointless you know what as humans we say a lot of empty pointless ineffective things God says I don't talk like that I don't think like that I don't do like that everything I say comes with purpose and behind that purpose is power to make it happen he says so shall my word be that go forth out of my Mo mouth it shall not return to me void but it shall accomplish that word accomplish it shall do it shall make it shall produce it shall deal with Hallelujah it shall deal with your situation it'll deal with that person it says it'll prepare it'll acquire it'll appoint it'll bring about it will work that's what his word is amen how is it going to accomplish it we want immediacy that's the nature of humanity right now we want everything B right now but it accomplishes it in a cycle he says it's going to accomplish it but remember it comes down as rain it Waters it C causes growth it growth brings fruit and the fruit is what we need for every situation but it's a cycle of times and Seasons but it doesn't mean God's not in it if you don't see fruit there's a cycle that's happening through all these things that's how God works see so often we look at the supernatural that happens that gives us our testimony but we forget all of the long hours we forget all of the prayer we forget all of the seeking we forget all of the battle all of the rotting all of the dying out that happens before that and we say it was God at the end and we don't realize it's been God from start to end it was God that started the work it was God that sent the word it was God that helped you to catch it it was God that helped you to rot it was God that helped it to grow and then it was God that helped it to come into its fruition it was God from the beginning to the end and we want to put our testimony at the end he's saying catch this I'm there from start to finish I'm there at the beginning I'm there in my trial sister Nikki as you were saying when I'm down in the valley I'm there and we think the mountain is a supernatural experience no the M the the supernatural experience is that he takes you through every bit of those things and brings you into a manifested word in your life Hallelujah you ever notice you plant something a and it it takes weeks sometimes for something to pop out of the ground and then it takes weeks more for it to grow up and then in one night you go to bed and you come back the next morning then there's a little tomato there and you say it's a miracle no the miracle was that it grew in the first place that it survived through all of the weather and all of the seasons and all of the difficulties and the kids knocking it over and then it finally produces fruit then we're saying that's the miracle no the miracle was life all the way through it was life that started it and it was life that produced the the Tomato at the end the tomato is not Supernatural the whole thing is Supernatural amen think of that great woman that helped Elisha remember she built the the house on or or the room on top of the house so that he would have a place to rest and relax that was the supernatural portion for that woman and she had no clue what she was doing because what it did was it set a foundation for Fellowship she became a friend of the prophet and then from that friendship came a cry of her heart to have a son and he gave her the son by God's Will and then so she's now got this wonderful blessing and we say there's the supernatural but God knew what she would need all long amen we say the testimony is the child the testimony is that she started the work she cast her bread upon the water and it came back in the form of a son God has no unpaid debts as I've said so many times but then that continues and he's Jehovah Gyra he sees the need and the relationship is still there and so when her son dies she knows where to go she knows who to talk to and she knows there's a power to provide for the need of her dead son and she goes there there and she gets him back to life again the testimony was God from the room to the Risen child every bit of it it's a cycle amen being faithful to produce good fruit brother Bram says this about that shunamite woman he says that woman came to the door then all the good things she had done little did she know when she had that bed made in there for Elisha and made his bed with her own Dan that someday her dead baby will be laying there and the body of that Prophet through the Christ would bring that baby back to life again he says you don't know what's happening when you try to do something for one another see she's planted she's cast her bread upon the Water she's stepped out she's done something with what she has and he says you have no clue what you just did you have no idea sometimes the words we speak the kindness the goodness the graciousness the Forgiveness the longsuffering we have for people what that's going to turn out to in later in our life and later in their life he says you don't know what's happening when you try to do something for one another try to help one another that's right like bread upon the Water it'll Return To You Someday so many of us are here and we've got children that are away we've got family that are away from God we've got uh young people that are away from God we've got members of this church we've got people we know that are sick that are fighting for their lives that are fighting an Affliction they've had all their life and we're sitting there and we're looking for God to do a mighty work but let me tell you the mighty work is the end it is not the beginning but it starts in something so little and it can be encouragement it can be the right special at the right time sisters and brothers it can be a word in due season it can be a kindness it can be an accommodation it can be a forgiveness when you don't think they deserve it and you cast it upon the Water and you realize that's what we're trying to realize here it's God's Great cycle there's a rain there's a seed that's there there's a rotting there's a growth and then there's a fruit and it's just God doing it over and over and over again he says it shall accomplish what that which I please that word please it says that which I Delight in take pleasure in that which I desire so it's not what I want it's not what you want it'll produce what God wants and it's by his Good Will and it's by his good pleasure and it's by his thinking not our thinking amen he says and it shall prosper it shall prosper not it might maybe it shall it's a declaration it's a guarantee it's a promise it's a promise you can hang your soul on it he says it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it this is where this thought of faithful and true comes from from this morning he says it shall prosper that means it will make progress see we think Prosperity is at the end no there's a path he says it'll make progress it will advance it will be profitable and then it will succeed prosperity in this case is a is a journey of getting better and better and better until it comes into Perfection Hallelujah see the word of God he says won't fall short it won't fail too often we look at the circumstances we look at the struggles we look at the barriers we see nothing of barriers here all we see is the word will come to pass that's all we see he doesn't look at those things he's not dwelling on those things and if he's not dwelling on it then why are we dwelling on it he never tells us to look at the circumstances he says only believe if thou cast believe all things are possible situations have no power except God gives them it's what Jesus said to pilate he saids you have no power except it was given you from above people have no power over us the word is where the power is the word is what has the promise behind it brother says this he says oh the blessedness of believing the blessing of not trying to figure it out church are you trying to figure out why and how and when and what's going on he says don't do that he says the blessing of just resting on God's word and say it's true and go on he says it's life it's real living oh my Hallelujah I want you to see something Church the unfailing part is not you the unfailing part is the word inside of you amen it's not me that's holding me up this flesh will fall this flesh will trip this mind will give out our emotions get the better of us but you'll never see God acknowledging those things except to say I'm a high priest that can be touched by your the feeling of your infirmities he says I know what it's like but that doesn't matter he never said it would hold him back he never said it would hold us back he never said it would stop the word he said my word will prosper it will accomplish that which I've sent it to do he said it will never hold you back ultimately we fight it's a battle we know that but it will not have our lives it will not take us it will not hold us back he conquered everything at Calvary Church he lived a sinless life and then he gave that sinless life for us so that we could have the victory this morning brother BR says this brother one day when I was lost worse than that I Heard a Voice say I'm still the mighty conqueror and he cleared away my sins and I laid my hand on the power of almighty God That Shook Me from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet and I've had my hand on that ever since at the end of this road My Savior Waits my loved ones wait and someday he says I hope to see them he says I'll hold to the road I'll hold to the wire of his glory remember he was talking about being lost in that snowstorm and his wife and his and his son I believe were down in the cabin and it was a storm that came in he was worried about their safety and he was all caught up in what a great Hunter and Outdoorsman he was and he says I'll find my way back and he realized he got into a circle uh uh what they call the march of death and he started going in circles going in circles and remember what happened he said he stopped and he prayed and he said Lord help me and he started walking with his hand up cuz there was a telephone line I believe that came down off the mountain that was a round hand height up here and he says if I can grab onto that I can follow it all the way down and he's saying I was lost wor and that he says I'll hold to the wire of his glory not rest on my own skill not rest on my own experience even my own Revelation I'll hold to the wire of his glory that leads from the cross to glory and trust him till I die for he has conquered what all my enemies church we cannot read this to say he has conquered all of your enemies he's conquered all of my enemies you have to say he's conquered my enemies for you personally he says he's conquered my sickness he's conquered my sins he's conquered my selfishness he conquered my ways and today I'm more than a conqueror in Christ Jesus who conquered for me for me this is not somebody else's relationship this is not somebody else's word this is my word and youve got to say it's my word as well it's your word it's for you amen it's got to be personal you know we look at the faith chapter in Hebrews 11 and it seems there like the people are the faithful and true ones I was reading it last night Abel and Enoch and Noah and Abraham Sarah Isaac Jacob Joseph Moses Rahab are all declared as Heroes of the faith but yet we know the reality of their stories we know they were not perfect we knew they slipped and fell we knew that they had shortcomings and failures and I'm not saying that to tear them down church I'm saying that to encourage you this morning because something else kept them going when they couldn't go themselves what was it it was a word promise that they laid hold of that was personal that was personal to them that's what kept them going when they didn't want to get up listen Joseph went from a pit to slavery to prison you telling me that he didn't have some some tough Ms and yet he served God in every situation he found himself in and he was found in abundance in all of those things what kept them going the word promised for their life and they laid hold of it and they believed it amen and that's what made the difference let me say it this way we've all failed we've all fallen short and that doesn't make a lick of difference to God hallelujah he doesn't care he doesn't care cuz he's already conquered he's already lived a sinful life he's already what given us a promise he swore an oath by himself he did not swear it based on your performance he did not swear it based on your Christianity he did not swear it based on your faithfulness but he said I am the only one I can trust and so I'll swear by myself they're going to make it Hallelujah that's where you're standing this morning is on his oath not on your oath we're oath Breakers if we're serious we're oath Breakers but his oath cannot fail because he swore by himself and he cannot lie he cannot fail amen his word is for us his word is to us but is not dependent on our Perfection or performance ever ever we're wrapped in Robes of his righteousness not our own amen he conquered and because he conquers we can do all things through Christ amen that's the power that keeps us going ahead it's him and us it's not me it's not my IPL it's not my power it's not my strength it's not my commitment it's the word inside of me that keeps pushing us even when I don't want to when you want to stop when you want to sit down by the side of the road when you just want to get away from it all there's something that keeps picking you up again and it's nothing less than the word of God inside of you by the power of the holy spirit amen he's faithful and true that's where our rest is Amen brother Bram said I'm not holding him he's holding me Hallelujah let me take it a bit further as we start to close we walk by faith amen we walk by faith and I think sometimes we can get this mentality that God doesn't understand the kind of pressure and the kind of struggle that comes with walking by faith why would God need Faith he's God all power all knowing knows the end from the beginning why does God need Faith but let me tell you God knows about faith because we see that Christ was willing to die because he had a promise that he would rise again remember it was God in Christ reconciling the world to himself God is in Christ God had to have faith Christ had to have faith on one scripture and he rested his entire Ministry his entire testimony on one scripture and it was this in Psalms it says for thou wil not leave my soul in hell and neither wil thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption NOW Watch What Happens CU jesus takes this one scripture Church two lines and he bases his entire Ministry and testimony on that one scripture he hangs his soul he hangs his resurrection he hangs his future Kingdom on one scripture cuz if every one of them's right except that one he's toast based on one scripture on that scripture Jesus says this Jesus answered and said unto them destroy this Temple and in 3 days I will raise it up then said the Jews 46 years was this temple in building and you will rear it up in three days it says but he spoke of the Temple of his body so you will never find anywhere in scripture prior to this that the scripture promises that Jesus would raise in three days this is his prophecy it is not a scriptural prophecy but Jesus now knowing the science of the day if I could put it that way he knows that after after 72 hours corruption sets in and he says I know that corruption won't set in because I've got a word promised for it so therefore I can declare I will raise up within that three-day window that's where he gets it from he says I'm going to rise from the dead in three days because the scripture says I can't see corruption amen stop and think about that he came up with his own testimony his own proof his own challenge based on the word of God and he spoke those words he took the word promise of his body not seing corruption and said I'll rise again on the third day that took faith that took faith and then he went to Calvary laid aside his righteousness took a beating a whipping like no other man had then he went to the cross and purely based on psalm 16 he gave his life gave his life he did not lose it they did not take it the scripture says he gave it he laid it down on the promise that it would be picked up again amen he laid it down of his own free will in total faith that the word that he had lived by so far was the word that he would raise by we're under the same promise Church the word we live by is the word that's going to raise us up at the end he didn't just give his life church he gave his life knowing he was going to hell it's one thing if we could say I'm just going to go into a state of nothingness and I won't know anything and then but no he had to go to hell the promise was you'll go to hell but I won't let you see corruption he gave his life knowing what he was going into can you wrap your head around that kind of Faith you better because it's no less than the faith that you have today because we give our lives we give everything to this word we live by this word though it seems to hurt though it seems to cause us trouble and distraction and all these different things we give it because we have faith that in the end it will accomplish and prosper what God has sent it for but BR says this the great triumphant General who came down and the word made flesh took the word and defeated Satan on every ground and said you destroy this Temple I'll raise it up in the third day why David and the word said that I'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption neither will I leave his soul in hell and he knew that that was one promise of God that he'd be raised up and he took that word and went to death with it and knowing that word had to come to pass he says there's not one word word of God's promise that but what will come to pass he said heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall not fail every promise is perfect he says and on that one promise in the scripture I'll not leave my Holy One to see corruption nor suffer him to see corruption neither will I leave his soul in hell he says now Jesus knew that corruption sets in the body after 72 hours the nose falls in now the corruption sets in the body and David said by the Holy Ghost a man inspired the word of God coming to this Prophet said I'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption he says and he knew before one cell would could would corrupt he'd be up out of the Grave he says why he was the word fortified by the word you say I'm the word what are you standing behind then if you're the word you'll get behind the word you'll be built on the word you'll be built up in the word the word comes to the word he says and he rose up he conquered death hell and the grave and himself come back in the form of the Holy Ghost to fortify the for this last day in this big ins slaught Onslaught where these great intellectual Giants are rising up and reasoning against the word he said but I'll not leave you comfortless I'll come again and be with you and I'll be in you again he said I'll pray the father he'll send you another comforter which is the Holy Ghost he will abide with you forever Hallelujah he says what is it the word gods are artillery in the human being Church you take the word in and it's quickened by the Holy Spirit and faith comes behind it he says it's God's artillery in the human being you are God's weapon against the kingdom of Satan think of it he says that great conqueror who conquered every sickness conquered every Superstition conquered every giant conquered everything there was to be conquered on Earth he died then and conquered hell conquered death conquered the grave conquered the atmospheres ascended up on high and come back in the form of the Holy Ghost he says and we are more than a conqueror through him that loved us church if that's what the power did then then what will the power do now it's the same power it's got the same overcoming elements in it I don't care what we're facing this is faithful and true he says what an army he's talking about you what an army what an army do you feel like an army this morning I've got some grins but do we feel like an army because this is what the Holy Ghost does is it turns you into a supernatural Army where the gates of hell can't Prevail against you you're an army says what an army like a mighty Army marches the Christian Soldier amen great Triumph he's in us not me he's already conquered it I don't have to do a thing but just believe him and walk on for He Is Risen he says the spirit is in us the great Victor the resurrection presence is in us we've raised from the things of the world from unbelief and Creeds to a living Christ with every Power of the enemy defeated you say brother I've been raised in the message it's still a Creed until Christ comes and lives in your heart and makes it live it's just an idea it's just a a fanciful thought but when he lives in you and makes it live in your life that's when it becomes a Living Word and it's a Creed otherwise he says even death itself is defeated hell's defeated the Grave's defeated every sickness is defeated amen he says it's not me a conquer he conquered it's not what I am it's what he is amen he says where is he at in me I've crossed from Death unto life Hallelujah ye who were dead in trespasses and sins hath he quickened and there's only one quickening power and it's the Holy Ghost amen Jesus risked his whole testimony his own his own Ministry on one scripture and said in 3 days I'll raise up you know in another portion of Matthew he says for as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly so shall the son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth he said that but that was never said anywhere else he took psalm 16 and he turned it into his own prophecy it wasn't a new word it was him speaking his testimony based on the word that was already given amen I want to bring it down to where we're at living today because we're in the harvest season amen we're at the end of all things we're at the harvest season we're in the maturing season we're at the the final age the final group and it's the alpha becoming the Omega again Jesus said this verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it abideth and bringeth forth much fruit Christ died he says I've got to die I've got to die if I don't die you can't rise so he died died and he rose again but he didn't just come as one person but he came back in the form of the Holy Spirit The Same Spirit that raised him from the dead and now that indwells every son and daughter of God the same power the same wheat the same Life Source the same DNA it's all within us amen and we're in the final age now where he's Gathering all of us in all of the mature weat into the Garners and he says it's time to go home and we're at the end of it all but Paul says this in Romans he says we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose it's his calling it's his choosing not ours you've got to be called he says for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren we're talking faithful and true we're talking about the word will accomplish what it's set out to do he says says moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified church I don't care about the first two if I don't get to the last one I want to get all the way to glorification amen I want to get to a body change I want to get to a resurrection and a Rapture now brother Lonnie Jenkins spoke on this and I I hope it's okay this morning if I read his words because he says it better than I ever could but I want you to see how he grasped this thought on he whom he justified them he also glorified he says Jesus knew that the word of God was perfect and here we see whom he justified them he also glorified is all one sentence he says it's not whom he justified and will'll see how they do and put them to the test and if they really work out then we'll glorify them that's how we feel if we're honest sometimes he says it didn't say that it's the ones that he's called of course we know that many churches have people there that God didn't call they got there somehow but God didn't call them there he says but to all that God Called to the word to the revelation of their hour whom he justified he's already glorified he says so just rest in that and the word will do the work Church what an encouragement that ought to be this morning to the bride of Christ has anybody Fallen this week has anybody been in a battle and felt like they've made no progress maybe it feels like we've stepped back and we're sitting there saying I can't even win a battle I can't get past this I can't get past this situation I can't get past this habit I can't get past this complex whatever it is but what is he saying he's saying it doesn't matter where you're at you've already been glorified it's not resting on your performance it's resting on the fact that he said you're already glorified you are sitting in Heavenly places right now in Christ Jesus you're wrapped in the robe of righteousness you're under the blood of Christ you are sinless you are spotless you have already got a glorified body waiting for you he's not waiting for our performance to glorify us but he already has a body prepared waiting for you and God doesn't prepare a body if there's not somebody coming for it amen so he's not saying well then they pass the test then I'll decide if they're going to have a Heavenly Body there's a body already waiting Paul said there's a one already waiting for us if we pass from this place amen we've got a new body prepared for us why because he's seen the end from the beginning his word is in us and it's going to produce it it's the Faithful and True Word but where are we now we're in the cycle of the word of God and if we're honest and and we think about it see God's thoughts and God's ways are down and they're here with us and we've got an open book and we've got an open Word and the seals are open and we understand these things but the understanding is not what makes it happen it's the cycle of the word of God coming down the presence of God quickening life and then there's a rotting away and then after the rotting comes some growth and after the growth comes almost full maturity but when full maturity comes then the fruit produces and it's the same thing that Christ produced but the thing is I have portions in my life that are fully mature by God's grace they reflect Christ but guess what I've got spots that are still rotting and that's where the battle is as we look at the rotting rather than the fruit that's already there and we wonder how can we do it but the glorification is going on because I'm already reflecting the mirror of the word and the life of the word in my life in part but remember what Paul says in the end we're not just going to see it in part but we'll see him as he is for we will be as he is but they're still rotting because there's a cycle they're still watering they're still growing there's still a breaking forth and it's all God it's all Supernatural it's all his will it's all his way it's all his purpose there's nothing out of kilter every single portion listen we got some messy situations in our past we got some SI messy situations in our present I think of some of the ones we're praying for that have left the Lord it looks messy Rahab was really messy Church Ruth was messy Joseph was messy but God was in it nonetheless amen see there's a start and God chooses the start church I don't choose it and you don't choose it we would say why would God wait listen I I started preaching at 35 years old why did he wait so long I could have done so much more if he'd done like so many others and started me in my 20s but this his choosing it's his calling it's his placing it's his working I clearly needed more work than most men do but that's God and God has a way of doing these things amen Jesus himself had to go through the things that we go through the scripture says that he increased in stature and favor with God and man he increased he did not start at the peak he started down here like the rest of us and he grew in it all and he produced a mature fruit in his life Paul continues he says what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us let me put it this way if the word says we're in we're in Hallelujah if the word says I'm a part of him then I'm there if the word says my name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world I'm in whether I see it or not whether I feel it or not even whether I believe it or not in this present moment you know the scripture says though we deny him he cannot deny himself why because we are a part of him we're a portion of him there's a word seed being expressed out of our lives and he cannot deny us cuz our names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life by the blood of Jesus Christ and they cannot be erased they cannot be erased amen if the word says I'm the elect bride of Christ who am I to argue the word says I'm the predestinated seed if I'm a part of the royal seed who am I to argue I say let God's word be truth and everything else be a lie amen Church don't fight it rest in it rest rest in it rest in the work amen take power take encouragement from the fact that he says you're not just Justified you're not just Sanctified you're already glorified it's a finished work from his standpoint and all we are is in the cycle of time but it's a faithful and true word and it's a faithful and true cycle amen and we've got to go through the cycle there's going to be rain Hallelujah we enjoy the rain don't we but after the rain comes rotting and that's the part we don't like but I'll tell you this if you've got rot in your life it's proof that you've received the word the way it was meant to be given CU it'll tear down this flesh it'll kill it it'll rot it and then it'll produce the Life of Christ amen then we're in seasons of growth now you look at these young boys that are growing a foot every week it seems like and what comes with growth Growing Pains things change real quick we like the fact that we're growing but often the growth doesn't feel so good but then you come now to the fruit bearing time and that brother Bram says is just laying in the presence of the sun that's getting in front of God and saying God let your word come forth amen and that's the resting you'll find that in that maturing with the wheat there's no more water going up to it it's already done it's a finished work and it just takes the presence of God takes the presence of the sun to bring that thing out completely he says he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us how shall he not with him also freely give us all things he says who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth we've already said he has already Justified it's a finished work amen church we don't have to answer Satan's accusations this morning if he's got it listen if you got something on your conscience repent turn around and walk the other way and that's all you have to do you don't have to explain it you don't have to answer for it it's God that justifies it's not Satan I don't have to answer Satan I don't have to give him satisfaction amen we claim the blood of Christ and we move forward he says who is he that condemneth it's Christ that died y rather that is risen again who's even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us who who shall separate us from the love of Christ that word who means who or what he's saying nothing what is it out there who what circumstances whatever it might be it doesn't matter nothing's going to stop us he says shall tribulation distress persecution famine nakedness Peril or sword as it as is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we're accounted as sheep for the slaughter he says nay in all these things we are more than conquerors how through him that loved us he says for I am persuaded church that's what the preaching of the word's supposed to do it's supposed to persuade you to let you see where you're standing this morning to let you see that your name's written there he says for I am persuaded can we say this morning I am persuaded amen I am persuaded that neither death nor life sometimes we'd almost wish we were dead that's why he's saying life won't stop us the the the cares of Life the situations of life and if if we pass on he says that won't stop it either nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor dep nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord Hallelujah church that's where you stand today not you will stand where you stand today as we close he says when you find anything in the Bible hang your soul on it Jesus did he says it's the truth just stay right with what God promised God will do it amen God bless you let's stand each one amen can you say praise the Lord this morning amen I'm so thankful I'm so thankful for his goodness I'm thankful that he's faithful when I'm not faithful I'm thankful he's got answers when I don't have answers he meets the needs when I don't see the way I'm thankful he overrides me church that he does what he thinks best even when I've got an idea anden I'm thankful that he's faithful to his word you know we can get caught up in that idea that he's faithful to us but he's not faithful to us he's faithful to the word that's in us because this is all going away he's not saving that he's saving the soul that's on the inside that word that seed Gene of God that's in there that's what he's doing and he's preserving the life that he placed there before the foundation of the world Paul says nothing can separate us but what's our part our part is to believe and walk forward that's all he ever asked us to do believe and walk forward day by day listen we choose what we drink and we choose what we eat don't we that's a day byday choice and that's going to determine whether you bring fruit or whether you get prickly like a cactus it's going to determine whether you bring forth beautiful blooms or whether you sit there and Wilt and everything Fades away and you're no good for anything that's the choice we we have our feeding is the choice we have but it's up to God to give the increase it's up to God to produce it inside of our life amen let's bow our heads if we would Heavenly Father every need supplied Lord that's what your word is that's what your power is that's what your presence is that's what your spirit is lord it's every need supplied but Lord you're calling us you're calling us higher Lord to a place place where we'll open every door to every room Lord we'll let your word shine a light in every portion of our life Lord that where we haven't even started rotting yet Lord we'll let that warmth of your presence and the Lord the water of your word come in and start us in a process of bringing forth fruit where right now there's just a hard shell Lord I pray your grace to us Lord you see my life you see my shortcomings Lord you see each one that's here Lord you see every need you see every situation Lord you see the battles that have raged Lord maybe for decades in some cases Lord but we know you're faithful and true Lord the an's on the way the victory is on the way Lord the word has gone forth Lord and it will not return to you void Lord let us feed on that word Lord let us find our situation let us find ourselves in that word Lord and cling to it let us hang our very Souls Our Lives our finances our relationships our Ministries our gifts Lord our children our spouses Lord whatever it might be Lord let us hang each one on your word and rest on the foundation Lord that it will not return void Lord give us Faith Lord give us courage to stand this morning Lord let us lay hold of what you've given Lord let it find anchor in our soul and produce a mature fruit we pray Lord grant it to each one in Jesus Christ's name amen my redeemer is faithful and true 11:34 my redeemer is faithful and true and everything he has said he will do and every morning his mercies are new my redeemer is faithful and true my redeemer is faithful and true and
