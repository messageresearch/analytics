we've got to resist the influence Lord every day Lord I pray you strengthen us this morning strengthen our experience Lord strengthen our walk Lord keep our eyes settled on your word I pray Lord speak to the people that are gathered here this morning we ask in Jesus Christ's name we're praying it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to John chapter 3 John chapter 3 and it's verse one I miscopied that John chapter 3 and verses 1 through3 to start amen want to welcome back brother Mark and sister Moren trusting they had an enjoyable break amen good to have them back and one of welcome our visitors as well God bless you I promise I won't preach for two hours today amen amen and uh certainly want to remember the Believers in North Carolina and East Tennessee brother Barry coffee shared a prayer request this morning just saying there's many that are trapped in small towns no internet no electricity no way in or out roads are blocked with Fallen trees from Hurricane Helen so we want to remember them and just trust that God will move quickly to provide them the grace and the the resources that they need amen also just a quick announcement I'll be gone October 15th to the 18th for work so I'll miss a Wednesday service and I'll make arrangements for someone to speak for that as well amen John chapter 3 and verse 1 says there came a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him Jesus answered and said unto him verely verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Amen you can have your seats God bless the reading of his word and we're continuing our series on the Holy Ghost and called the token life and I'm taking yet another service on this thought of what is the Holy Ghost and and a subtitle of the new birth last service we we spoke on the circumcision we'll touch on that for a brief moment here but we're talking about the new birth and I want to take a few services on this because I want us to know where we're at I want us to know what we have amen the the purpose of this series is to answer your questions to take away your doubts to help you see where you're standing today to see that you've made your calling and your election sure that we're not just sitting here in church and having a church experience amen but I want you to know where you're at when we're done here and I want you to be sure you know that God is moving in your life and there may be things I say maybe not today so much but you'll say I never realized that and if I had the Holy Ghost then how come I've never done that or never realized that well it's because you have the Holy Ghost that you can receive it now amen when we were when we when we received the Holy Ghost when we got a new birth we did not just receive a download of all of the knowledge and information and revelation of what the word has for us we have to grow we have to mature in Christ and so that means that we can we can live with things in our life we can do things and and until God gives us a revelation then there's nothing that we're held accountable to it's just there and and and it can be there but then God comes along and by the preaching of the word by the reading of the word by the conviction of the Holy Ghost however comes we realize hey that ought not to be in my life or I ought to be doing this or I ought not to do that or I ought to pull away from this or change that in my life and it's just God working with us Bit by Bit by Bit amen so so don't if you hear something you say well how can I have the Holy Ghost and think that or or do this or that don't don't pull away from your Christian experience because you're not perfect that that's not what the Holy Ghost was given for the the Holy Ghost was not given for Perfection the Holy Ghost was to bring us to maturity amen it's the blood of Christ that makes us perfect that's what I'm trusting in is not my perfection it's in his amen but rather if you hear something you say I I I I I ought to be doing that then say Lord I'm holding you to your word you've given me your spirit you've given me the baptism of your spirit in my soul now make it live the word that I've heard today or that I've heard in the week or whatever it might be amen because we're going towards a resurrection and a Rapture now I don't know about you but I don't know if I'm Rapture Ready yet I believe when I'm Rapture Ready then we'll go in a Rapture I believe when you're ready we'll go in a Rapture but until we're there that means I've got a to grow in I've got to grow in faith I've got to grow in maturity I've got to grow in Revelation of what God has for me in this life and so all I say is God keep me out of the way God help me keep growing day by day in my walk and let me not stand in the way of what you're trying to do inside of my life now we spoke last service on the old mostly from the Old Testament we talked about the Holy Ghost being the the true circumcision and it's the circumcision of your heart that that makes a separation from the world and the things of the world and the love of the world and it's God's way of taking us out of what Satan has created his Eden that he has here and drawing us back to the original Eden where we had full relationship with God and we had full Authority and Dominion by his word but today I want to take a bit of a different route here and talk about what the Holy Ghost is and what it means to us in a bigger way a and move us beyond the types and shadows and now bring us into the reality of what the word preaches and what the gospel preaches today and I've got a Title Here of the new birth and and and we have this phrase the new birth or being born again and I think it's one of the most misunderstood things in Christianity today because we have this idea that we're born again if we say the sinner's prayer or we come up and we go to the altar or even we get our we get baptized or we get sprinkled or we sign our name to a church book and none of those things mean you are born again and yet you have people that are preaching that all over this world that you're born again as soon as you say a sinner's prayer or something like this those things are all good some of them are even necessary but no one of them means that you are born again we'll see what it means to be born again amen and Jesus is the first person that ever used this term born again and we read it in our in our opening scripture this morning and he makes it very clear that being born again is beyond repentance and it's beyond baptism amen it's not just those things remember John the Baptist came with a message of repentance and baptism and that wasn't enough to make people born again when they when Jesus came there were not a bunch of people that were born again under John's Ministry and yet he preached repentance and baptism so that can't be it it's got to be beyond that amen amen we ought to know that so John knew the limitations of his own Ministry amen and he was just preparing the way for the full experience of the New Birth by the New Covenant under the Grace Covenant and his was a voice he said crying prepare ye the way of the Lord in other words he says my Ministry is to get you ready for the real Ministry to get you ready for this thing you've been praying for this thing you've been expecting what the word is said was going to happen I'm just preparing the way for the fullness of the word to come to you and it says in Matthew 3 speaking of John it says in those days Came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judea and saying repent ye for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand he did not say it's here he says it's coming I'm just preparing you for what's coming he says for this is he that was spoken by the prophet Isaiah saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make his path straight so the in the Book of Matthew it says that John is fulfilling Isaiah where he's a preparation for the Messiah coming but when we drop down to verse 11 this is John speaking now he says I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance now we're going to go to acts 238 in a little bit and there Peter says repent and be baptized that's what John's doing repent and be baptized he says but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I'm not worthy to Bear he says I can't even put his shoes on That's How Much Greater he is than I am he says he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire so catch that now the baptism of Jesus Christ is not of water it's of Holy Ghost it's of fire it's of spirit water baptism is required but that's not the real baptism we're looking for that won't do the job it'll it's a representation of a work but it won't do the work in and of itself amen so John's message was repentance it was a turning away from those things that are wrong in God's eyes and that was followed by water baptism but even the water baptism of John was not full or proper and we see when that it wasn't enough on its own because in Acts 19 remember Paul comes to these true believers they were True Believers and he says have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they said no we haven't we don't even know about it he says well how were you baptized in other words it matters how you're baptized and they said well we were baptized unto John's Ministry and he says no no no you haven't gone far enough that that was great you recognized John but John pointed to somebody else and you had to continue from John's Ministry into the ministry of Christ he says you need to be re-baptized unto Christ's Ministry in Christ's name in order to receive the full ministry of Jesus Christ and so as soon as they did that as soon as they were baptized in jesus' name then Paul laid hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost there was nothing wrong with them they just needed to follow the prescription and so that's what they did because they were real believers they followed what the word said they grew in their Revelation that's what we're supposed to do when we're talking with people you're talking with people that maybe don't have the Revelation you do don't tear away what they have build on the truth that they have ignore what's wrong but build on what they have if they all they have is that I've accepted Jesus Christ as my savior say well there's more than that have you receed the Holy Ghost since you accepted him as your savior but don't tear him down don't say you're not a Christian you're not a Believer they just maybe don't know what they need to do and the minute you tell them by God's grace hopefully they'll do it but we come to Jesus now and John is pointing to him and then when he comes he identifies him and from the very get-go Jesus is recognized as something special even by those that hated him his ministry was was full of signs and wonders his Doctrine was astonishing remember what the scripture says he didn't speak like the the priesthood of the day but he spoke with authority it's a sad State of Affairs isn't it nobody has Authority today everyone has multiple answers for one question they don't have truth if you've got three answers for the same question it might be this it might be that it could be this it could be that no we ought to have a truth that we're resting on and Jesus spoke with authority he never had to Waffle he never had to go back and forth he wasn't bowed by the the the the social norms of the day or by the injustices all he brought was the word and it was it was conis it cut through everything and it came right down to the truth of the word word of God but we see here in our opening scripture that Nicodemus comes to him and Nicodemus is a teacher he he's a is a part of the ministry and he he he comes to Jesus secretly by night he doesn't want to be identified with Jesus but he he he's he's curious about who he is and what he is it says there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do the Miracles that thou doest except God be with them he says there's nobody's done what you've done and so we know God's got to be with you but watch how Jesus comes back Jesus doesn't say you're absolutely right Nicodemus boy you've got a real Revelation Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God now that word that Nicodemus uses there no and the word that Jesus uses see are the exact same word and it means to be aware to behold to consider to perceive in reality and it's a new testament only word it's only used in the New Testament it's not that it didn't exist previously but it's that the word is a new testament word and it reflects the true understanding of who and what God is and that's what he's pointing at now Nicodemus uses it first and he says we know we're aware that you're a teacher come from God and Jesus comes right back at him and he says Nicodemus you don't have a clue we would think Nicodemus has an idea of what's going on Jesus comes back and says Nicodemus you can't even understand you can't perceive you can't see you're not even aware of what's going on because the only way to truly know and see who I am is to be born again all Nicodemus has is an inkling and it's not settled on anything because he's just wondering he's wondering he says we know you're from God but but who are you why do you how how can you do these things why aren't you you know why aren't you with us why are you outside of us and all he can't place him in the scripture he can't place the way he's living he can't place the way he's preaching but he's he's intrigued by it because there's something there that he doesn't have amen but remember he's a minister he's dedicated to the word of God and yet Jesus comes to him and says it is impossible for you to understand what's happening right now except you be born again and so Nicodemus comes back and he says how can a man be born again when he's old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born Nicodemus doesn't even know what being born again is he says can I go back into my mother that's impossible I can't be born again and Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of what water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God so you have to be born of water you have to be born of spirit two elements not just one not just the other both of them have to come together and we see what those things are he says that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit so catch that you can't have a spiritual Birth by natural means in other words you can't be spiritually born based on who your mama is who your daddy is who your minister is who your pastor is what church you're going to what your DNA is that has nothing to do with it you can't be spiritual based on your natural birth now that's of great comfort to some of us because some of us come from horrible families and guess what some of us come from spiritual families and we can rest on where we come from and say that means I'm automatically a child of God you're not a child of God proven until you're born of the water and of the spirit amen that's what makes you a child of God the spiritual birth is a new birth it's being born again and it has nothing to do with this nature that you have naturally with who your family is your ministry whatever it might be and he says Marvel not that I said unto thee you must be born again he says this beautiful thing he says the the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but can not tell whence it cometh and whether it go he says so is everyone that is born of the spirit now listen to this quote he says how can you tell people things of the spirit that's not born of the spirit you have to be born of the spirit to understand the things of the spirit Jesus said the wind bloweth where it listeth thou cannot tell which way it comes or where it goes see so is everyone born of the spirit they can't tell you a man that's born of the spirit doesn't take any thought he lets God do the thinking church when you're born again you can't go around and tell everybody what it means to be born again you can't tell them how it happened you can't tell them how you know you can't explain how it works amen it doesn't make sense to them it will never make sense to them and if we're honest Church many times we don't understand it fully ourselves we don't we don't we we we will go and do things we'll go and say things sometimes we won't say things we'll go here we'll go there and we don't know why we're doing it all we know is we feel led to do it or God help us we feel not to do it and that's the moving of the spirit in our life and you go tell somebody I'm not going there today why not I just can't go I'm not going on the road today I'm not going to that meeting I'm not taking that job I can't be with you here why not I just can't do it and you can't even explain it yourself there's something in you that's holding you back there's something checking you or sometimes praise God there's something that is forcing the words out of your mouth because it's the Holy Ghost inside of you that's saying Speak you must speak you must be a witness for me you cannot be silent you have to testify right brother Grant there are times where you have to speak no matter how uncomfortable it makes you or how uncomfortable it makes others we've got to be able to say I'm doing it and I don't even like it sometimes but there's something inside of me calling out saying you better do it and you have no rest until you do these things try and explain that to somebody where they're led by their feelings where they're led by their Comforts where they're led by what people think about them you can't do it amen Jesus said that's the way people that are led by the spirit that are born again by the spirit are they're the wind blowing here and there and all you know is that there's something going on but you can't explain it that's the way the people of God are we have to be so careful with these things though because we're in an age of feelings and emotions and the world says if you feel it it must be right isn't that the way it is today and look at the insanity it has produced in this world the world has gone completely at same but remember the leadership of the Holy Spirit the unction of the holy spirit will never ever ever ever Lead You contrary to the word of God ever it is impossible and we'll see why as we get into this service anymore I touched on this briefly when I spoke in Edmonton how we have come to the place unfortunately where we are LED going by the feeling of the unction rather than the foundation of the unction amen where we go by the feeling of what we feel led to do rather than the certainty of the word of God now I'll use myself as an example I study and I pray and I dwell before God when it comes to studying for services to preach and these different things and I have had many thoughts that seemed very good to me on the onset and I thought wow that is amazing and then what did I do I go and I do not write a sermon I do not bring out these things without going back to the word of God that's the only that's the only y thumb and that's the only absolute I have is this Bible right here and I've got to be able to start on the first page and take it all the way to the last page and there have been some thoughts that I pulled through sometimes all the way to Revelation and then it falls apart amen anybody that's studied or preached knows this and what did I do when I came to that point where it disagreed with the word of God church cuz I've got to have I make a decision do I get lifted up in Pride and say it's inspiration I'm going to force it through or I'm going to find a loophole or I'm not going to bring that one scripture that undo the total inspiration or do I throw it away because you cannot force inspiration through the word of God it has to fit easily so what do I do church when I hit that point where it doesn't fit the word I have to do one thing throw it away throw it away you have no other choice you have no other choice amen the word of God is what is inspire ired and my inspiration has to be subject to the word of God at all times at all times amen my inspiration has to come according to the word of God remember what Paul said in Corinthians he said he says Marvel not he says Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light in other words satanic inspiration can appear to be truth satanic inspiration let me blow your mind is 99% truth it just is incomplete or it misconstrues just a little bit and all Satan's trying to do is get you off the Mark just by one degree because when you go down the road that one degree turns into not just an inch off the center of the Target now you're a foot now you're a meter now you go far enough and you are so far off the target you say where did I go wrong you went wrong at the 1% where Satan lied to you and you believed it I have to check my inspiration through the word of God and you do as well amen two people are many people are choosing to pray and not come back to this it doesn't work that way you have to check your inspiration through this amen and the problem is is that this cuts through the fog when it says it here you have no excuse now you got to take it or leave it and you got to make a decision but if you just pray and say I feel I feel I feel then what are you left with your feelings and guess what the heart is deceptive above all things that's not it amen we can't rely on our heart to make the right decision my suggestion to you always start with prayer because what are you doing you're in God into your situation and you're saying God I want what you want not what I want so Lord will you show me what you would have me to do and then what do you do you go back to the word and you say Lord show me by your word so I have an absolute Foundation to rest on that is that is unchanging that's what we're supposed to do amen but in the end whether we've got a scripture or not we cannot explain ourselves to an unbeliever you can't even explain yourself to a nominal Christian because it make sense to them it will not make sense to them uh I'll leave it alone we can't explain our way of living we can't explain our way of Separation we can't explain the way we run our finances we can't explain our commitment to the body of Christ to somebody that doesn't have the Holy Ghost it makes no sense to them amen take this example try and explain to somebody how you know when you love someone isn't that the Great great test for our young people Mom Dad I really like him I really like her but how do I know when I'm really in love go ahead explain it brother Bob you know what he'd say go ask your mom and you know what she will spend a half hour explaining it and in the end they will be no closer to the truth because you can't explain love you can't explain the contradictions of love how it will make you do things that are even bad for yourself for the sake of that person it'll make you sacrifi I remember Blanca and I when we courted she was in California I was in New Finland 4 and a half hours time difference she didn't get home till 11:00 p.m. my time and I can't tell you how many times I stayed on the phone till 3 4 5 6:00 in the morning talking to her that ain't good for your health church it's not good for your sleep it's not good for it's not a good habit to get into and yet I would will L sacrifice my sleep for her I would spend money I didn't have to make her happy I would do things I didn't necessarily want to do because she wanted to do it because I loved her but then it moved beyond that to now living together and there's a greater sacrifice that comes with that and that's really when you find out was it in love or was it love but it's going to start with all sorts of things and when you see them and you get those fluttery feelings in your stomach and God your heart starts to go right all these things build up but no one of them is love and guess what there's many people went through everything I've just talked about and it ended up just being affection infection sometimes infatuation or lust why you can't explain it and so what do we come back with you'll know when you know and you'll know when you know usually much further down the Road when it's been tested and tried and proven as being love rather than in love because when you love you'll be loving rather than just in love but go and explain to somebody this is how you know that this is the one you can't do it it's got to be a revelation by experience proven by time that's the only thing that's the only thing we have amen so try to explain something like the Holy Ghost which is the epitome of love it is the greatest love and explain how to one person it's a hug and the next one it's a spanking the exact same love you can't explain it you can't explain it and yet that's what it is they've got to experience amen so don't try and tell people this is why I do what I do say I do what I do because I've met Jesus Christ and he's been made personal to me and that's all you're left with and say you've got to experience him the same way I've experienced him to know what I'm talking about and hopefully your life is enough of a draw to those people that they'll say I'm willing to do it I'm willing to do it Jesus Nicodemus answers Jesus he said unto him how can these things be how can what things be he said the blowing of the spirit the new birth and these different things and Jesus answered and said unto him art thou a master of Israel and knowest not these things in other words saying Jesus saying you're the best of the best you study the scriptures you know you know all of the Old Testament you know all of the Books of Moses you know all the books of the prophets and you don't know you need a new birth have you not read Ezekiel 37 which we read last service he says I'll give you a new heart and I'll give you a new spirit and then I'll place my spirit within you that's what I'm talking about Nicodemus he says how do you not know this why is Nicodemus so ignorant Church why were the priesthoods so ignorant because they didn't think they needed a new birth they were looking for messiah to come and affirm them where they were and say you're it you've got it you're great you've done exactly what I said enter into the joys of Heaven and the law was just there to as a placeholder until God could set them free from the law till he could fulfill it and set them free and bring them into Grace amen but these men were convinced of their own righteousness of their good standing of their piety uh of their righteousness before God their revelation of the word and they didn't think they needed to change that's why they weren't looking for it amen the greatest detriment to the New Birth that I know of is to think that you don't need to change and and there's two influences that I can think of that would bring something like that there amen the first is a religious spirit sometimes the people that need the New Birth the greatest are those that are sitting in church amen because they've got enough knowledge of the word of God a and of the word of God you live a clean life you try and do right and you figure that's more than enough to satisfy God and so you say God will God will come and affirm me God will confirm me rather than I need to be changed to be pleasing to God you're resting in what you know and and in what you have rather than the blood of Jesus Christ and the filling of the spirit but the second group you'll find is it's people that say God made me as I am therefore why do I have to change and this is what you find preeminently outside of Christianity is they say God made me this way why do I need to change but there's a fallacy in their thinking because we are not born in the image of God we are born in the sinful image of man see after Eden nobody was born in the image of God sin brought them to a fall and so we are not brought into this world in the image of God we're brought in under the curse of sin so what we have in this flesh is not of God's choosing now don't think God doesn't have a hand in it because he does he says in Jeremiah I that he formed Us in the belly of our mother life comes from him but we are not born as children of God or meant to be born we're not born in the image of God we're born in the image of our parents by their choice and by their will amen so you need to be changed but here's the thing whether you're born good or whether you're born bad we all need to be changed and whether you're born into a Christian family or whether you're born into an atheist family whether you're born into a Muslim family a Hindu family whatever it is you still need to be born again amen what you're born into does not change it because it's all sin and it cannot come before God Amen and yet Nicodemus I have to give him credit because for all that he has and for all that he is and for all of his position and all of his influence he knows one thing Jesus has something he doesn't have Jesus has something he doesn't have and so what he's coming he's saying what he's really saying is how do I get what you get how did you get where you are cuz I want to be where you are I've had it all I've got it all as far as it could take me and yet you are so far above me and Beyond me how do you get it where's this coming from amen Jesus Works were full fully Beyond theirs that they they couldn't touch him signs wonders Ministry The Authority by which he spake God backed him up time and time again and they could do nothing because remember what were their Works about their Works were all about self-righteousness they're trying to make themselves good because they obeyed the law remember what Jesus said you you know you you obey every little bit of the law even to the tithing of your mint and your cumin you'd have a little piece of mint and you take off a tenth of it and you bring it to the to the temple as a tithe so perfect and so exact and then he says you neglect the M weightier matters of the law Justice and all these different things their Acts were self-righteous and what were Jesus Works Jesus Works were service Jesus Works to set other people free Jesus Works were to fulfill all righteousness there's what self-righteousness his to was to fulfill righteousness what's righteousness to do the work of God his work was to do what God wanted theirs was to do it to promote themselves to lift themselves up and so you get to the place like the Pharisee that said I'm so glad Lord that I am not like this poor Publican down here we get there sometimes but let's not it as something that we can't overcome Nicodemus wasn't left in the Lurch Jesus said Nicodemus you're so self-righteous I can't help you no he said Nicodemus just be born again and it'll do what it's supposed to do amen Nicodemus had enough humility to come to Jesus and ask about it and that's a great starting point is if we can humble ourselves and say God I see I need more you may have a lot this morning but you always need more until we're out of here we need more and more and more and more and if we we can humble ourselves and say God I don't have it all imagine what God would do for us this morning and I don't believe anybody in here would ever say I have it all but by our actions we say I have it all or I have more than you that's the way it happens amen when we can't be corrected by somebody else when we can't be fed by somebody else when we can't be edified by somebody else that's when our actions are saying I have it all amen you know what God does then church God just goes over here and he says all right then you got it all go ahead do your thing that's what he does church I'm speaking by experience this morning I'm not preaching at you I oh I'm preaching by experience this morning God sits back and you know what we do is we sit over here and we get a critical spirit again I'm preaching by experience this morning we get a critical spirit and what happens eventually is we start we finally come to our ourselves and we say where did I get this where's my sarcasm coming from where's my my cynicism coming from why am I so negative towards everything around me and you know what it is self-righteousness has brought us to a place where it's just me that's going in it's just me can preach it's just me can edify it's just me can sing it's just me can worship it's just me me me me me we become the me monster and we get up into a seat of the scornful I'm preaching by experience amen absolutely 100% by experience this morning amen the worst thing we can do is compare ourselves to somebody else in the body of Christ because what we do is we use it to boost us up so that we don't have to change and we do it to put them down to make it feel like we don't have to grow and it's not of Christ ever amen church I've been corrected and edified by children yes even my own children amen when Sister Mary Beth or brother Jensen can raise their hands in worship that's edifying amen I've been corrected and edified by God forbid my wife yeah yeah I've been corrected and edified by other ministers I've been corrected and edified by people that aren't Christians so who am I then I'm nobody I'm nobody I'm nobody I certainly don't have it all amen but the minute I think that brother that sister is not as gifted as I am they're not called to as high in Ministry they're not as far along in their walk look at what they're doing in their life they can't help me they can't edify they can't even correct me that's when I become righteous in my own eyes and you know what the Holy Ghost has to go sit in the corner cuz I'm all about me again can't get anywhere with God like that amen a prideful heart will never do this Jesus said to Nicodemus Nicodemus says how's this going to happen he says verily verily I say unto thee we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and ye receive not our witness Jesus says I'm telling you what I know I know this by personal experience I'm telling you because I've seen it I'm telling you because I've experienced it he says and if you can't receive that he says if I've told you Earthly things and you believe not how shall you believe if I tell you Heavenly things Jesus says my gospel's reality I'm not talking about things I don't know about I'm talking about things I do know about and if you can't accept it down here how are you going to accept what I've got waiting for you up there there's got to be something happens in the land of the living the the scripture says talks about the blessings of God in the land of living the working of God the reality of God in the land of the living before we ever get up there into the land of eternal life there's a reality that the gospel that that has to happen here amen Jesus is saying if you can't accept my Earthly Ministry how are you going to get to your Earth your heavenly inheritance it's going to happen here before it happens over there you know I think it's a great failing we have even within this message is we have a great amount of knowledge and because we know it we think we have it we know so much we know so much the book is open the book is open the seals are opened it's a brand new book and and we can sit there and we can understand things that people wonder about we have authority in the word and we think because we know it we have the reality of it and that's not necessarily true it may be true but it's not necessarily true because knowledge won't do it if we don't have faith to put it into action knowledge won't do it if we don't have wisdom to apply it amen knowledge won't change US unless we've got the spirit of God to Quicken it inside of us because otherwise we're just going to know the word rather than become the word and it's just a mental thing rather than a living thing amen we can rest on The Laurels of our understanding and God's sitting there saying if you'd only compare your life to your understanding you'd see there's so much more available amen you ever run into somebody that can talk about the word all day long and yet they have no overcoming power in their life what is it they're caught up in the knowledge of the word without the reality of the word quickened by the spirit nothing wrong with having that but you got to move on from it amen the purpose of a mystery is to be revealed here not here we're the mystery revealing of Christ in this age it's not about talking about it it's about being it he doesn't want us to to just to to to just teach the word or or preach the word over a Pulpit he wants us to live it that's what preaching is is to speak and live what you're talking about amen so Jesus says you got to be born again Nicodemus so the question is what does it mean what is the new birth how are we born again is it a prayer we say is it an altar call is it attending a particular church is it a particular Ministry is it signing your name to a book is it a certain baptism is it a certain robe you have to wear is it a certain sign is it speaking in tongues what is it what's the new birth well Peter tells us how we get it he says for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers he's talking to the Jews now Peter was a messenger to the Jews they have the full word as they know it and he says it was vain tradition your conversation he says the life you have is vain tradition it will not do the job you got to move on from it he says but with the precious we were bought with the precious blood of Christ as of a land without blemish and spot amen the blood is our Redemption it pays the price and it gives us an opportunity to stand in the presence of God to return to our original position to return to our original inheritance he says who verily was for ordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times for you who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your Faith and Hope might be in God he says seeing ye have purified ified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently Jesus said by this shall all men know your my disciples by your love one for another but catch this now Peter tells us how we're born again being born again not of corruptible seed what's corruptible seed Mom and Dad genetic traits family heritage that's not going to save you because remember what what Paul said of himself he says when he was Saul he says I was of the stock of benjin I was a Pharisee among I was of the of the sect of the Pharisees I was the best of the best and what did that lead him to Antichrist he persecuted the true church he says so we're not born again of corruptible seed of the natural seed from Mom and Dad he says but we are born of Incorruptible by the word of God he says which liveth and ab it forever The Incorruptible seed is the seed Gene of God that he's placed inside your heart by predestination by election and it's the word that brings it to life he says for All Flesh is as grass and the glory of man is the flower of grass the grass withers and the flower thereof fth away in other words he says this corruptible thing you have this natural thing you have as good as it might look at times it's going to fail and it's going to fall and it's going to die he says but the word of the Lord lasts how long it endureth forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you so what is it that brings about the New Birth Church it's the word of God Amen it starts with the word of God it's the thoughts of God as as David said in the Psalms it's the Deep calling to the Deep there's something in you that responds to God and you cannot respond to God unless there's something in you to respond to amen Jesus said no man can come to me except the father draws him first there's something placed inside of us and what is it it's the word of God that's meant for you it's the thoughts of God about you it's the things that God thought about you before the world began and what happens is as the word comes your way you catch a hold of it and it it brings a light to you and something comes alive and you say hey that's me and you may have had no clue that that was you ever before like we said last service and may be reading a newspaper ad am man it might be uh the preaching of the word it might be you know uh my my father-in-law he was crossing the border from Mexico to the United States illegally and found a tracked a message tracked and that changed his life forever what is it it's the word of God coming your way amen and what happens is the holy spirit now comes behind that and when you receive it it quickens it and it brings it to life and now there's a new life that Springs up and that's a new birth because it's a spiritual birth it's not a natural birth you can't be born again outside of the word of God because it takes the word to let you know who you are you're just recognizing yourself it's like that story of of the farmer that took the chicken egg and put it under a Chicken and the Egg and the mother hand hatched it and he's out in the chicken yard and he's trying to live like a chicken and guess what when they are thriving an eagle is not thriving living on chicken food it's meant to eat fresh meat it's not meant to pick at worms and Grasshoppers and eat grain and these things it's meant to have the fresh kill of the word and so the eagle is there and yes it's growing a little bit but it's not maturing the way it's supposed to and then one day what happens Mama eagle flies over and she screams at Eagle scream and that eagle says that sounds like me I don't cluck like a chicken I scream like whatever that is what is it and it looks up and it sees this thing and all the chickens are running for their life because that's death to them but it's life to that eagle and he says is that you mama and she says that's me he says how do I get up there she says just start flapping your wings and he responds it's a deep calling to the Deep he knows now who he is and he may jump up on that chicken coop and flap his wings and he goes and he die bombs and he crashes but he knows because he can see her that there's a day where he's going to fly and what does he do he's using his strength to start to fly and he's getting better and better and then one day he just takes off and he Soares into the skies and he can't live on chicken food anymore amen there's something inside him that responded it's so simple Church you can't explain to somebody how you're born again all you can say is this is what happened to me you can go to church a long time but that's not the new birth you can sit under signs and wonders but that's not the new birth you can sit under the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost but that is not the new birth it takes the pure word to come and Quicken you so that you can live as Christ lived amen it takes the ordained word for your age and your season to cause you to come to spiritual life and then you have a spiritual birth and now you recognize I am a child of God Amen that's the Trap that Pentecost has laid for people is that they're relying on the new birth based on an experience or based on a gift of speaking into tongues rather than a life that's changed listen how easy is it to speak in Tong Paul said do all speak in tongues do all have healing are all ministers he said no they're not and yet they use it as an Evidence the easiest thing in the world would be to come into church and speak in tongues speak in tongues some are doing the real thing some are faking it but that just means I've got to come to church once a week and really all I have to do is speak in tongues once and I've got the new birth are you kidding me that's not what Christ did no it's a life changed it's a word accepted and living out of you that's the proof that you got the Holy Ghost easiest thing in the world is to come into church and speak in tongues once amen but Satan can mimic every gift that is in the church he can mimic it and so you can't rely on something can be mimicked you can't rely on something that the scripture says is without repentance gifts and callings are without repentance that is not where our hope is God wants people that can live the word when they're outside of church not just do something inside of church anyone can do it inside a church the rain falls on the just and the unjust when the spirit of God is in the building then anything can happen to anyone Saul prophesied in the days of David but he wasn't a prophet was he when he got in the atmosphere he did that and then what did he do he went out and he tried to kill David that's an anointing on you not an anointing in you that's a presence around you rather than the indwelling presence of Jesus Christ amen God wants people that will live by the spirit to bring the word to life every day not just come to church and do something and then walk out the door and nothing's changed amen we'll get into the evidence of the Holy Spirit later as we get into this series amen but I'm trying to set the standard early that the evidence is known by your life by the acceptance of the word in a way that makes it live not by gifts it's not about gifts being shown it's about a life being lived that's always what it is Jesus said by your fruits you shall know them not by your GI their gifts you shall know them Jesus never mentioned that by your fruits amen the only thing Satan can't reproduce is the word of God living in a human being because eventually what happens is the fruits will come through because he's not the author of Life he's the author of death and so it's going to die but it's the word that abides forever and ever and it say scripture says that he'll you'll be like a tree that's planted by the water and you'll bring forth fruit in her season in his season and it just stays and it's always there and it never changes but with Satan it always dies away and you see that we've known people that have served the Lord for 20 30 40 years in some cases and then they fall away why because Satan cannot produce the word of God in a human body it falls away eventually the fruit comes out but he can mimic and copy every gift he can produce a counterfeit for everything that's in the church absolutely 100% scripture says he's sitting in the temple being worshiped as God that's how close he is into religion he's in the middle of it he says your birth has to be changed in other words your natural birth you've been deceived you might have spoken in tongues you might have jumped up and down you might have shouted you might have done all of this that the other you might have been a loyal members so was Nicodemus see but he lacked the birth and when you deny the word try to place it somewhere else and do something to it and Scatter it away like that he says Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe go you into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he says as long as the gospel is being preached these signs shall follow tell me the place where he ever took it away from the church show me the scripture where he ever ever where he said he ever said just for so long he said unto all the world and to Every Creature he says yes you'd have to receive the kind of life he had in order to live his life he says but catch this and when you see his life then you will know his word amen there's your proof right there he says that's right when he the personal pronoun not a thought not an imagination not a sensation but when he the Holy Ghost has come he will take these things I've told you reveal them to you and will show you things that are to come he says that's the birth that's the Vindication that it is word when a man says he's got the Holy Ghost and denies the word of God and places it somewhere else how can the Holy Ghost deny his own word you can't do it you can't do it they have this doctrine of of the Apostles being the only ones that had the Holy Ghost in power and authority and yet you see all sorts of men going out around and doing things that weren't Apostles Steven was not an apostle signs and one ERS followed him right the Holy Ghost is power amen that's what we're looking for is the power to make us live a life and signs and wonders follow behind those sorts of things but you cannot say I have the Holy Ghost and I'm denying the word doesn't work because it's Denine itself we'll see this as we go on the scriptures Paul said where is the wise where is the Scribe where is the disputer of this world all these people that are trying to disprove trying to diminish and they're not just in the world they're in the Christian church as well sometimes the greatest DET detriment we have are the people inside of the Christian world it's because they're taking the power out of the word so that all you do is you just sit there like a lump and you never change you're back into legalism you're just doing with the Pharisees trying to live a good life that's not what Christ came to do he came to set us free amen he says for after that in the wisdom of God by the world the wisdom knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe what I'm doing here today is foolishness it is it's foolishness how in the world or why in the world would God use an imperfect man to do a perfect work because you look in Ephesians we're supposed to do a work that unifies and perfects the body and it's by the foolishness of preaching that a five-fold Ministry brings the bride to perfection he says it's foolishness to save them that believe the world will look at this and say foolish and then what do they do they'll listen to Media they'll listen to their favorite influencer they'll listen to their favorite sports caster more Faithfully than we do and yet we're foolish and they're not makes no sense they're drawn to what they like we're drawn to what we like amen he says for the Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom but we preach Christ crucified under the Jews a stumbling block and under the Greeks foolishness in other words the preaching of the gospel of Christ it stumbles the vast majority of the group it's foolishness to one and it stumbles the other Jews couldn't get past it and the Greek said this isn't wisdom this isn't intelligent enough we know more than this gospel you brought but he says but unto them which are called he says but Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God he says the foolish the the foolishness of preaching is what it's the power of God and the wisdom of God so the Jews and the Greeks rejected it but Greek SE means the Gentiles that's us but inside of each of those groups there's what there's a little elect group that will hear it and they'll receive it and it'll do exactly what it's supposed to do what's the difference one has the seed of God inside of them and the rest don't that's the unfortunate truth amen that's the only difference it's not a choice I make it's not a choice you make it's a choice God made before the foundation of the world that my name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life and that's why I can receive the word amen and so what happens is the word comes to the word the word comes to produce what it sent out and it was a seed of God that he put cast out into the world and now he's coming to bring it back to him he's not coming for me he's not coming for this he's coming for the word inside of me amen and that's a soul issue not a flesh issue that's why this flesh has to be changed it has to beor glorified he says because the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men church we live our lives by the word and we consider it the wisdom of God and yet the world is out there you know I I saw this hilarious article so um we had helicopter parenting remember where you were all over your kids and you were into everything and and then you had the the one where you kind of stand off and each was the wisdom of their day and now there's saying that was all wrong now we need a balance whoa can you imagine we need a balance we need to be close but not too close we need to stay away but not too far away it's the wisdom of man and you know what we were doing all along Church by the word staying in balance and you know what it produces good citizens what they've been trying to do all along by a simple reading of the scriptures we produce and that has nothing to do with the Holy Ghost that's just basic principle of how to raise your children right and it produces good citizens and the world is out there saying how do we do this and we've got psychologists and psychiatrists and Educators and all these things saying well how about we try this and how about we try this and let's do away with this and let's add in this and we definitely won't do this anymore and they're doing the same thing with their health aren't they this food's no good that food's no good don't do this don't do that and you know what they've realized now you can do anything you want it's genetics that'll determine whether you're healthy or not most times you don't get cancer because of what you eat you get cancer because of your genetics they say now they could be wrong who knows they keep getting it wrong but remember you couldn't have fat now they're saying no you got to eat fat oh you can't have eggs now you got to eat eggs can't eat milk now you definitely have to have milk don't ever eat wheat no you better have wheat it's got an essential no they have no clue Church what it's the wisdom of men is foolishness it has no Foundation they're ever learning and never able to come to the truth that's not just a spiritual thing it's a natural thing as well but it interesting as I was studying this and I I heard someone mention I was trying to remember who was who was it might have been a preacher that I was listening to or or something they they they they read this quote and I thought it was a good thing to bring to us because we're talking about the new birth and the leading of the Holy Spirit and and the foolishness of preaching now and brother bram's here and he he's talking about his first service now remember he's an ordained Prophet he's a seven Church AE messenger he's the angel of Revelation 10:7 and I want you to hear the report of his first service he says I remember the first sermon I preached I got up there and thought I did really well and all of the old ladies sat around and they cried a little bit you know and said oh what a wonderful boy the old Pastor Dr Davis was an old lawyer I went down and he said I want to see you down at the house I said all right I walked in next day you know all swelled out I said how did I do Dr Davis he said the rotness I ever heard deflated him like a Bo balloon I said what he said the worst I ever heard oh I said Brother Davis everybody was crying can I add something what if he said everyone was shouting everyone was dancing everyone was hollering nobody would stay seated everyone was clapping I could barely preach because of the response of the people we'd say there's Revival in the church I'm not saying that's not Revival church I'm saying that's not the proof amen everybody was crying he said yes they cry at funerals they cry at births everything else he says what it is Billy you never quoted one bit of God's word prophet of God he says you talked about some mother that had dung gone on or something like this and got everybody to cry said you're not born again of things and Sensations upon things and sensations of this Earth you're born by the word he says oh you cut he cut the wind right out of me and I'm glad he did see not jumping up and down hollering that isn't it it's not wrong church if we don't have some life in us there's something wrong come on let's preach it in Balance here I'm not going to throw it all out I'd love a jump and holler in church but we got to be who we are I like what brother Aon ogles be said he says you better have something behind the hooping and hollering and jumping and running around know why you're doing it but let's never suppress it let's never suppress it he says it's not that it's the word that makes alive the words quickened he says it's not experiences it's the word experiences follow the word but you've got to receive it Jesus spent three and a half years with his disciples preparing them for the new birth they got trained and they got tested and they failed and they let them down and they did all sorts of things but God was in it and God was doing a beautiful work with them and when it all came down to The Showdown what was The Showdown church was The Showdown signs and wonders what was it before Christ is crucified what was it that held Peter and the disciples was it the signs and wonders was it the walking on the water was it raising the dead was it it Healing The Sick was it putting the storm out of existence that wasn't it remember what Jesus said we preached on this recently he said unless you eat or he says if you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have eternal life and that sounds horrible to us without Revelation it sounds horrible it sounds anti-rip even and he never explained it and then at the Last Supper he comes and he explains it a bit and he says he says I am the bread of life and he says when you eat my flesh and drink my blood then you have it he says but what was Jesus he was the word John 1:1 in the beginning was the word the word was and the Word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us Jesus was the word what was he saying you got to eat the word you got to drink the word you've got to take the word you've got to take all of it not just a bit of it you've got to take the whole thing not just the part that looks good tastes good feels good you got to take all of this word and that will produce the word inside of you that's what you got to do amen he was saying consume the word and when you consume the word it'll become the word inside of you but at that point in time Jesus had preached a tough service and it was unexplained and it really threw his disciples for a loop now remember they had cast out Devils they' healed the sick they'd raised the dead not just the 12 but the 70 plus the 12 there's 82 of them there that have done all these signs and wonders but Church did you ever notice something the 12 disciples were called by name he chose them but the other 70 he did not choose they felt to call they came of their own accord not of his he didn't call them by name the 12 he called by name 11 predestinated to life one because he needed a traitor and he picked that traitor amen but the 70 they were not chosen they felt something they felt the pull of the Gospel but there was something lacking inside of them and we see where the Showdown happens and it is not over signs and wonders it's not over good feelings it's not over Revival experiences watch the separating line now Church watch the difference between a religious experience and those that are coming to a new birth so Jesus preaches that that that famous sermon unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part of me these things it says now many therefore of his disciples when they heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it who can understand it who can receive this' and when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them does this offend you there's a reproach that comes with believing this message he says what and if ye shall see the son of man Ascend where he was before he says it is the spirit that quickens now watch this carefully church this is where so many miss it because they say the spirit's moving the holy spirit's acting we've got it but that's not how Jesus preaches what the spirit is he says the spirit quickens in other words the spirit brings to life it gives life and it keeps it alive it keeps it alive because remember the parable of the S there's some things that died they started to life but they died why because there wasn't a ground prepared but when the spirit brings something truly to life it is alive forever because the word abides forever it's an eternal spirit of God Amen so he says it's the spirit that quickeneth he says the the flesh profiteth nothing so we can't brag on it it adds nothing to this it brings nothing to life all this flesh has in it is death Paul said in this flesh dwells no good thing so let's not talk about it let's not brag on it I got what you don't have no no no that's the flesh it has nothing to do with this he says the words remember he says it's it's the spirit that quickens he says the words that I speak unto you they are Spirit and they are life it's the words that I speak there spirit and life I thought it was the Holy Spirit that quickens I thought it was the spirit of God that quickens it is and it does how by the word because what is the word the spirit of God brings the word and when the spirit of and when the word is accepted the spirit of God brings it to a reality in your body in your life in your mind in your soul and it produces itself all over again and it's a total working of the holy spirit amen the spirit of God thought it the spirit of God spoke it the spirit of God wrote it and then God dwells in the word the spirit of God dwells in the word and so that's what makes it a living word is that the spirit of God is in it amen it's laying there waiting for somebody to take it waiting for somebody to receive it in faith and as soon as they do it comes to life and it becomes a reality in our lives by the holy spirit amen it's like Jesus said in the in the parable of the of the seeds in the sewer there's a fertile ground that will receive it there's a lot of books we can read but this is the greatest book you can read because it's the only one that has life inside of it there's a lot of things you can read self-help and this and that for dummies but this is the only one that has potential life in it amen many are called few are chosen but it's the chosen that read this and it brings them to life amen they don't just respond to it see lots of people will surr will respond to it they'll come to the altar they'll they'll have a a tearful moment something but how many will surrender to it let it have the the full preeminence in their life and let it live through them and and produce the word of God by the power of the Holy Ghost so he says the the flesh profits nothing but the words I speak unto you their Spirit their life remember our Birth has to be by the word because the words are spirit and life he says but there are some of you that believe not in other words there are make Believers with signs and wonders that aren't real believers they thought they were they thought they were they're not make Believers because they're they're insincere they're make Believers in total sincerity they didn't realize it signs and wonders following they raised the dead they healed the sick they cast out demons they preached the Gospel of Jesus Christ and yet they are make Believers he says there are some of you that believe not for Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that believe not and who should betray him and yet he gave them power go tell me how that works Church why because there's got to be a different separating line than the moving of the spirit and the signs and wonders and the gifts and it's always the word it's always the word he said therefore I said unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of the father that's the election and predestination of God and from that time many of his disciples went back what did they do Church they backslid what's backsliding oh I I went and I watched something I shouldn't I listened to music I drank I smoked no they went back to the old word that's it he says and walk no more with him then Jesus said unto the TW will you also go away then Simon Peter Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou Hast the great signs and wonders of eternal life no thou pass the words of eternal life he says and we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ the son of the Living God what was Peter holding on to church was he holding on to his walking on water experience of the the storm being being spoken out of existence was he he dwelling on the the raising of the Widow's son of the multiplication of the food for the 4,000 and the 5,000 no Peter was resting on the word his Anchor Point in Jesus was that he spoke the words of life and then the signs followed those things amen he was convinced by what he said first and by what he did second that's his Anchor Point amen the new birth is not just the hearing of the word it's the receiving of the word into a heart of faith and you obey it by faith and the spirit of God quickens it and makes it alive in you that's what the new birth is the new birth is when the word of God Is Made Alive In You by the Holy Ghost and you produce the same life that Christ did that's what the new birth is because I live you shall live also the things I do I live I Do by the spirit of Christ that's in me it's the same life it's the same spirit it's got to produce the same thing what do you do when you have the new birth you become a Christian Christlike that's what Christian means Christlike that's what the new birth is is you become like Christ not in his fullness because it's a multi-member body but you become a portion and you become the portion that he wants to reveal in you of himself and we have to be satisfied with that amen and you're changed from what you used to be into what you always were what you were meant to be Church what brought about the the the the new birth on the day of Pentecost how did they receive the Holy Ghost obedience obedience to the word what did Jesus say he says go and T until you be endued with power from on high and so what did they do they went and they waited They Carried and They Carried and They Carried and they waited for 10 days until God came down and filled them with the Holy Ghost amen they didn't move they didn't preach they didn't testify they didn't do anything they stayed there and they waited until God did what he promised and then as soon as he did what did they do Church they started Living the Life of Christ and they came down and they started preaching brother Brown would say that Peter comes down he's different now he's an inspired teacher he's got an anointing on him and they started showing these things and they started producing The Life of Christ and what is the first thing they did signs and wonders no they preached the word the first thing Peter did was he preached the word of God why because you cannot be born again outside of the word of God that's what it takes Peter comes down he starts preaching in maybe 5 or 10 minutes and look what it says happened in Acts 2 it says now when they heard this when they heard inspired preaching says they heard this they were pricked in their heart and they said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do tell us how to save ourselves tell us how to make this right tell us how to receive eternal life then Peter said unto them very simple repent repent doesn't just mean to say I'm sorry repent means you are going this way and you turn around and you go this way so it's not a repentance is not just a thing of the mouth it's a thing of the life you turn away in obedience to the word from what you ought not to be doing according to God's word and you start doing what he said to do that's true repentance then when you've done that he says be baptized every one of you oh in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost no no no no Peter's got the keys to the kingdom what is the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost Jesus Christ what is the revelation of Father Son and Holy Ghost Jesus Christ so you got to be baptized right be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the Holy Ghost it's that simple you don't have to shout you don't have to dance you don't have to fall on your face you don't have to sign your name you don't have to wear a certain robe repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you'll receive the Holy Ghost who is it for for the promise is unto those that are sitting under Peter's ministry here today alone that's what some people are preaching Church sad but true Peter says the promise is unto you and to your children here's the thing he's preaching to people that are from all over the world devout Jews to your children and to all that are a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call don't let anybody ever tell you this experience was only for the apostolic age it is for everyone today God put it in tell me where he took it out amen he's never changed his program that's the beauty of God is he doesn't change his program there's no variableness no shadow of turning once he do it does it once he's got to do it the same way over and over again otherwise what certainty do we have what what hope do we have in a foundation that's constantly shifting when he does it he has to do it all the way now Peter doesn't stop there it says and with many other words that word there is logos with many more Divine thoughts did he testify and exhort saying save yourself from this un generation it says then they that gladly received what his word they that gladly received the logos his Divine message this wasn't spir this wasn't Peter preaching church this is the holy spirit preaching a man is speaking but it's the Holy Spirit speaking through that man and what is it it's Jesus Christ all over again continuing his ministry The Works that I do you shall do also he says and as many as that and they that gladly received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about 3,000 Souls what a sermon what a sermon 3,000 people but you'll see the way God does it he starts with 3,000 then he goes to a different place and it's a few less and comes down and pretty soon they're just gleaning they do this big start to get the gospel out and then what happens is it's just one here one there one there one there we don't worry about a big church we don't worry about lots of people I've said it before Paul's Church in Ephesus had 12 he writes to the Corinthians and there's 12 there small churches small people amen that's not what we're looking for but watch what Peter says here he says repent be baptized and you'll receive the Holy Ghost he's talking water because look at the natural birth he's saying to get the spiritual birth you need repent water baptism and the spirit but a natural birth takes water blood and then spirit amen when a when a mother's pregnant and she's about to give birth what happens first is first comes the water when her water breaks then there comes the blood and then after that comes the baby and the spirit enters into the baby producing human life and now when Christ is on the cross then what comes out of his body they pierce his side and out comes water blood and spirit all over again and it's the same thing that's required for our spiritual birth amen there's water there's a washing of the word there's the blood there's the sanctification of the blood of Christ and then there's the spirit which is the the holy spirit's The Life of Christ that comes into you and produces a living word you can have water and and you can have blood and never get to the New Birth you can be justified you can be Sanctified but it takes the spirit to make you live again can you imagine a mom that the water breaks and the blood comes out but if the baby never comes out there's no birth there's a baby but it's not born it has to come out to be born again it takes the spirit to make the the the Life of Christ in you amen we can have a beautiful personal life we can have a beautiful Christian Life we can not do different things we can come to church we can pay our ties we can do all these things that is not the new birth that's what people with the new birth do but that is not the new birth amen if God isn't in us we haven't been born again we'll touch on that in the next service but the new birth is a total conversion it's a total change it's the whole effect of the word of God and it takes that which is old and it puts it to death and it starts with something that's completely new born by the word of God Paul said this as we're almost done he says therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature a new creation notice he says if there's a question there if you haven't been changed you can't be in Christ no matter how good we feel no matter how good our parents are no matter how much we believe this message no matter how often we come to church that's not it how well we're taught I had tremendous teachers I had brother Mark in Sunday school I had brother Gerald that taught I found when I went out and traveled around I was well taught there were people struggling over things that I consider to be so silly because I was well taught didn't give me the new birth though and as soon as I received Christ everything I thought I knew had to be reformed through the filter of the word of God by the Holy Ghost and I understood things differently I saw people differently I saw situations differently I saw min differently why because I've been born again as much as I Knew by knowledge when I got the Holy Ghost to completely changed the way I looked at things he says old things are passed away behold all things are become new we have to be in Christ to be a new creature a new creation we have to be in Christ because remember it's him in control it can't be you in control it can't be me in control as Pastor it's not about me in control in this church God forbid we ever get to that place Church God forbid we get to that place it has to be the Holy Ghost there and I've got to be surrendered to him and you've got to be surrendered to him otherwise we're just going to start our own little denomination here amen and it'll fail we'll go into apostasy amen why because I'm dead and it's Christ that lives in me it's got to be him in control it's got to be him that's giving the orders and all we're doing is carrying them out where his hands his feet where his mouth these different things Paul says it this way he says for in him we live and move and have our being in other words there's nothing outside of us there's nothing in us that isn't controlled by him it's all wrapped in him it's all tied up in him we live we move you say I'm just going to the store you're in Christ I'm just driving to work you're in Christ I'm just having a conversation you're in Christ I'm just shutting my mouth you're in Christ I'm just going to church you're in Christ everything we do we're doing it through him amen he says we live and move and have our being as certain also of your own poets have said for we also are his off Spring we are his children how do we get in church how do we get into the body of Christ Paul says you got to be in them how do we get in come to a message church that's what a lot of people are saying the word will take you into Christ but sitting in the church won't do it you got to receive what's being preached over that Pulpit because that's the spirit of God to you it's not a man it's not an idea it's not a theology Paul says this for for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body your Doctrine won't get you into Christ listen you can get into Christ and then he'll correct your Doctrine there's a lot of people have the correct Doctrine they don't have Christ that's just knowledge that's just knowledge amen but you got to have the spirit because otherwise the letter kills amen for by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have all been made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many all of us come the same way we're all a part of that body there's no big eyes and little 's we're all little 's he's the big eye he's the big cheese and then he's the head of the body last quote as we close he says we all know that any kind of a birth is a mess when a baby's born if it's on the floor if it's on a Shu pile or in a pink decorated hospital room it's a mess he says but it brings life that's what the new birth is it's a mess but it brings Life Church you can't have death without a mess you go walk in the forest sometime and you see things that are dying there's a mess you see an animal that dies it's a mess you see a human body that's been decomposing for a while it's a mess cuz a new birth means there's a death and there's a life and the dying part's messy and the birthing part's messy amen he says it isn't a style or a put on or a declaration of Creeds it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost he says and that's the secret of the real believing Church Born Again amen God bless you let's stand if we would we're going to dig into what that looks like we're going to dig into what that mess looks like am me I remember when I gave my heart to the Lord it was a mess it was a mess boy and there's always things that come out of it and there's repercussions and rtion and there's Ripp that go through your life and it makes a mess of things but it's just God doing a separating work so he can raise you up clean up your life so he can live in you amen amen God bless you let's bow our heads each one Heavenly Father Lord we're thankful you've sent us your word Lord for it's by Your Word we were born lord it's by Your Word we live Lord and it's the spirit in that word that quickens us and makes us into Lord a living word today Lord I pray your grace for your people once again Lord how can we grow unless we feed on that word Lord how can we mature unless we feed on that word Lord I pray you help us to have our that we would move and have our being and live Lord in you day by day Lord may this not just be a church experience Lord God may it not just be a thing when we're around Believers Lord but in the privacy of our life Behind Closed Doors Lord at work at school Lord wherever it might be Lord may your word have the preeminence in our lives lives Lord for we know Lord when your word has the preeminence Lord it'll bring itself out into US Lord I pray you help us to surrender day by day Lord you see my rough spots you see my warts and bumps and Lord my weaknesses Heavenly Father Lord I pray you'd fortify it with the word through prayer Lord I pray that we'd be able to look in the mirror of the word with honesty Lord and where we see change that needs to happen Lord we'd look to you and say Lord bring us into your image we pray Lord let us not have excuses this morning Lord let Pride not have its place in our life Lord but let us stay humble before your word Lord seeking your grace day by day to make us more like you we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen

Prevail I'll overcome you in the Book of Revelation it says they overcame by the blood of the Lamb it says and by the word of their testimony anden you've got to find your word you got to find where you're standing in this age and in this season you find your word and you start to testify that word and you Watch What Happens amen it'll build your faith it'll produce itself in your life but you got to testify the right word man there's a lot of people reading a lot of things today but if you read this and you find your place in it you start testifying by that it starts to do something in your life am man starts to give you a faith it starts to give you a hope it gives you a trust it gives you an expectation and you start looking to God and you start crying to God and you start praying to God and you start believing God and pretty soon what happens the word comes into reality amen and there's something that anchors you and there's something that holds you because you know his word can never fail that's what I'm resting on I'm not resting on some sermon I preach I'm not resting on some idea I have I'm resting on a word that is proven itself time and time again in my life amen that's what I'm looking for day by day and when I speak that word when I put it on my lips when I keep it in my mind when I keep it in my life then I start to live by that word in a greater and greater way amen that's what God's looking for is a people that will take that word and testify of it amen the the scripture says that the testimony of Jesus Christ is a spirit of Prophecy amen The Life of Christ will produce the prophecy of the word in your life and that's where your dwell in day in and day out is he said he said to him that overcometh I'm going to overcome to him that overcometh I'm going to overcome to her that overcometh I'm going to overcome amen and it builds us up day by day and it keeps our mind in the right atmosphere and in the right frame so that we can accept it when it comes our way and we're not pushing it away and we're not pulled to one side or the other but it keeps us focused on the things of God keeps us focused on getting to the end goal
