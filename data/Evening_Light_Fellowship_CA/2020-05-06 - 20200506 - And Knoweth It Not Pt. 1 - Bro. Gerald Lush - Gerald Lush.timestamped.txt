[46:04] me no I believe no Oh Ranger possible
[46:25] [Music]
[46:29] a man praise the Lord a man the Lord
[46:33] blushes here and again those on line and
[46:36] we pray the grace of God to be with us a
[46:38] man ministered to us here but also
[46:41] ministered to those on line of course
[46:43] and i feel as i heard a brother express
[46:47] one of the brethren online are on the
[46:50] internet rather that there was looking
[46:54] forward to everything changing so that
[46:57] the he wouldn't be preaching just to
[46:59] just to a few in any in the audience but
[47:02] he'd be preaching to all of them a man
[47:05] that they would come back to church
[47:06] again and now me that that he felt to
[47:09] that many a believer that was viewing it
[47:11] online and at home was longing for that
[47:14] time to get back to church any man so we
[47:17] pray the grace of god brother to to
[47:19] bring to bring it to pass we know you
[47:22] know this may be just a just a beginning
[47:24] of other things that we expect to come
[47:27] upon them upon the earth because we know
[47:29] things are going to change but we pray
[47:31] grace that our faith doesn't change just
[47:34] that it will get better and stronger
[47:36] amen and our faith by the grace of god
[47:40] to increase a man to it to our staying
[47:43] for the word of god so god bless us and
[47:46] may the lord help us during this time
[47:48] it's it's a trial especially for those
[47:52] at home it's a trial for the for the
[47:54] ministry to come and minister and again
[47:57] ministering to theophanies not
[48:00] ministering to the physical bodies but
[48:02] to theophanies but as i was thinking
[48:05] about that today and this thought also
[48:07] struck me and says son that's what i'm
[48:09] longing for i've been ministering to
[48:12] theophanies but the lord was saying son
[48:15] i'm longing to get together you all in a
[48:18] glorified body a man so you're looking
[48:21] for those to come back to the church in
[48:23] a physical condition and he said I'm
[48:25] looking for all the things to come back
[48:27] in a glorified body a man because he's
[48:30] been what I've been ministering to as it
[48:32] worked with the often Eason and so on
[48:34] that's what God's been ministering to a
[48:36] man but he's what is longing for that
[48:39] hour
[48:39] that moment to come for the change when
[48:41] we're gonna come home in glorified
[48:43] bodies oh this is wonderful a man and
[48:46] again God allowing these things to
[48:48] happen maybe to bring that that
[48:50] revelation to our hearts a man to make
[48:53] it more real to us for the glory of God
[48:55] Oh Lord we're looking forward to it to a
[48:58] man we're looking forward not just to
[49:01] get out of the flesh and into a
[49:02] theophany we're looking forward to get
[49:04] out of this and he doing a glorified
[49:05] body by the grace of God
[49:07] probably gods that were going to go from
[49:09] ear to theophany and into a glorified
[49:11] body by the grace of God so God's grace
[49:14] be with us and I pray that we're not
[49:17] going to lose that faith but brother
[49:19] that faith is going to keep us moving
[49:20] that faith is going to keep us looking
[49:22] up by the grace of God amen so grace
[49:26] that we're going to have the revelation
[49:27] the faith that pleases God the faith
[49:31] that will bring us to that Dourif I'd
[49:33] body a man praise the Lord
[49:36] so Lord bless us turn with me to the
[49:39] book of Proverbs chapter one and there
[49:45] was another message that I was thinking
[49:47] about maybe ministering on but we'll
[49:48] leave that until Sunday the Lord willing
[49:50] and by the grace of God and I think
[49:54] we've been notified that there'd be no
[49:57] service next way to sleep because we lab
[49:59] service with our brother Ben Friday
[50:01] Saturday and Sunday
[50:03] that's where brother Joseph started out
[50:05] that's where we ended up
[50:06] a man Friday Saturday and Sunday
[50:09] and so being prayer for our brother Ben
[50:13] a man and as I don't know whether it was
[50:17] ministry in his home or in a church or
[50:19] where and again I feel that most of the
[50:22] ministry and brethren would prefer to be
[50:23] standing me behind a pulpit and minister
[50:26] that way rather than sitting in their
[50:27] homes or even or even in an office and
[50:31] so on so we pray the grace of God be
[50:33] with our brother Ben a man as he would
[50:37] come come to minister to us amen and
[50:43] also to be in prayer I may be mentioned
[50:45] it I think in the last service but
[50:48] greetings from our brother
[50:51] Eber in st. Lawrence as I said he called
[50:54] but we didn't get his call he got a
[50:56] message he left a message on the phone
[50:59] to greet us all and to thank us all to
[51:01] say that he's doing good and the Lord
[51:04] and the Lord has blessed him Amen that's
[51:05] good praise the name of the Lord so
[51:08] let's be in prayer one for another and
[51:10] keep also our brother Eber in prayer for
[51:13] the glory of God amen
[51:15] and in proverbs chapter 1 and share with
[51:19] you some thoughts tonight concerning a
[51:21] message that the prophet of God again
[51:23] priest in 1965 and it's one of the last
[51:26] messages that the Prophet preached and
[51:30] not the last message but one of the last
[51:33] ones before is homegoing and he makes
[51:36] reference to it even in this message
[51:38] right here concerning his own home going
[51:41] that may be that he was going to go and
[51:44] maybe the Lord was going to take him off
[51:46] the off the scene and so on and that's
[51:48] exactly what the Lord did he preached
[51:50] this message in August and the 15th 1965
[51:55] and it was in December that the Lord
[51:58] called him home
[51:58] Amen brother and I felt that brother
[52:01] Brown in well after the oume the seals
[52:03] brother realm may be felt that he could
[52:06] could be going home
[52:07] amen he preached just not very many more
[52:11] messages and he said now he says that's
[52:13] another revelation on the seals and one
[52:16] of them was marriage in divorce and so
[52:18] on but he said another revelation on the
[52:20] seals and I believe there was other
[52:22] messages as well but it was it was the
[52:25] opening of the word he preached the
[52:26] seven seals and then after that he
[52:29] preached this this and this and this but
[52:31] it was further unveiling of the mystery
[52:33] of God a man and the finally brother we
[52:36] could we come to the hour when it's over
[52:39] and is finished and we know in December
[52:41] 1963 brother Bentham said ere I go he
[52:45] said back into evangelism amen because
[52:48] he felt that the other ministry was was
[52:51] over with was finished or that that God
[52:53] was was finished with it
[52:55] amen so he would go back into evangelism
[52:57] and wait on the Lord and that's what he
[53:00] did and he did come back of course to
[53:02] Benham tabernacle and
[53:04] maybe even in brother Jack Morris Church
[53:07] he would preach certain messages to
[53:08] believers a man that the Lord would lay
[53:11] on his heart on to the Lord called him
[53:14] home a man
[53:16] so I believe that whatever the Lord
[53:18] wanted the prophet of God to preach
[53:19] after the open the seals I believe that
[53:22] he had it done finished a man by the
[53:25] time the Lord called him home when we
[53:27] consider that the last message he
[53:30] preached was communion a man and I don't
[53:33] think that was that was by chance or and
[53:35] it wasn't a message he just greeted the
[53:38] people in Tucson Tabernacle in brother
[53:41] Greene's assembly brother green preached
[53:42] but brother branham he asked whether
[53:45] round get up and greet the people any
[53:47] any and he did explain to them
[53:50] concerning the communion a man then as I
[53:53] said before I can't see how that
[53:55] believers can say we shouldn't take
[53:57] communion when that was the last message
[54:00] that we have hearing brother Branham
[54:02] explained our need to take communion so
[54:06] god help us brother so again tonight the
[54:08] message that I want to share with you
[54:10] tonight and some of the thoughts in it
[54:12] not all the message for sure but some of
[54:15] the thoughts and I have ministered on
[54:17] this before and it may be quite some
[54:20] time ago but and it's a message and
[54:23] knoweth it not a man what a subject and
[54:28] knoweth it not what does that mean a man
[54:31] well there's something they should know
[54:33] what they don't know and I trust brother
[54:36] sister that that we're not guilty of
[54:38] that the things that we should know we
[54:40] don't know I pray the grace of God that
[54:43] we know what God wants us to know that
[54:45] we're not going to miss the revelation
[54:48] that the generation back years ago
[54:50] missed during the ministry of a prophet
[54:53] and and they this has happened this has
[54:56] happened this is gone this is fulfilled
[54:58] that's fulfilled God's doing this and
[55:00] he's to watch the problem he said they
[55:02] don't know it a man because they think
[55:04] this they think that and they're
[55:06] believers the same thing they're
[55:08] thinking this they're thinking that a
[55:10] man but brothers sister they don't know
[55:13] what they should know so god help us
[55:16] it's I pray great
[55:17] step we're gonna know what we should
[55:18] know a man and and and their lies I said
[55:23] I believe their last service that after
[55:25] after their brides gone dead they're
[55:27] gonna still gonna be preaching the
[55:28] message
[55:28] oh yeah they be here preaching the
[55:30] message that's why they're when we ask
[55:32] the question I thought it was to you a
[55:34] rapture already happened they didn't
[55:36] know it oh yeah I saw I believe there's
[55:38] gonna be pro con believers that are
[55:40] gonna be left behind
[55:41] why because to get into the intellect of
[55:44] it the letter of it but not the spirit
[55:46] of it and they're gonna miss it and they
[55:48] are missing what God is doing in the
[55:51] resurrection and the rapture amen so in
[55:55] the book of Proverbs as we go into the
[55:57] message and know that not chapter 1 and
[56:01] beginning to read at verse 22
[56:04] how long ye simple ones
[56:08] will deal of simplicity and that word
[56:12] means ignorance ignorance hour long he
[56:17] simple ones will ye love ignorant and
[56:20] thus corners delight in their scorning
[56:23] and the fools eight knowledge you know
[56:27] turn you at my reproof behold I will
[56:32] pour out my spirit unto you and I will
[56:34] make known my words unto you because I
[56:37] have called and he refused I have
[56:42] stretched out my hand and no man
[56:44] regarded but ye have said it not all my
[56:48] counsel and were none of my reproof did
[56:53] it recognize what God was doing and what
[56:55] God was saying regarding is his word I
[57:00] also will laugh at your calamity
[57:03] I will mock when your fear cometh and
[57:09] when your fear cometh as this desolation
[57:12] and your destruction cometh as a
[57:15] whirlwind when distress and anguish
[57:19] cometh upon you and these things are
[57:22] coming upon a generation that misses the
[57:24] rapture and then shall they call upon me
[57:27] but I will not answer
[57:30] a man they shall seek me early but they
[57:35] shall not find me for that they aided
[57:40] knowledge and did not choose the fear of
[57:44] the Lord a man choose the fear of the
[57:48] Lord in hearing his word choose the fear
[57:50] of the Lord in receiving his word
[57:53] a man to believe his word and it said
[57:57] they would none of my counsel they
[57:59] despised all my reproof this is amazing
[58:03] therefore shall they eat of the fruit of
[58:06] their own way and be filled with their
[58:10] own devices brother make sure we got his
[58:15] way and his devices make sure we're
[58:18] doing what he wants us to do because the
[58:20] Private Eye lights in the message on the
[58:22] anointed ones at the end time concerning
[58:24] false Christ and he said in say a false
[58:28] Christ he says plural he said it oh yeah
[58:33] false Christ he said they are there they
[58:36] have the anointing to Christ anointing
[58:39] he said but they have false teaching he
[58:41] said they're not following the
[58:43] leadership he said of Christ he said
[58:46] they got the anointing but he said they
[58:48] had their own ideas that they're gonna
[58:50] live by so brother's sister let's be
[58:53] careful this again let's make our colony
[58:56] and election sure by the grace of God oh
[58:59] I want the anointing I got the anointing
[59:01] yeah that's right but do you had the
[59:02] right teaching a man are you going to
[59:05] yield to his leadership therefore shall
[59:09] they eat of the fruit of their own way
[59:10] not your way but are we going to take
[59:13] God's Way and God's understanding and be
[59:16] filled with their own devices this is
[59:19] amazing
[59:21] for the turning away of the simple shall
[59:24] slay them and the prosperity of fools
[59:27] shall destroy them but whoso arkin athon
[59:31] to me shall dwell safely not just a
[59:35] recognized and acknowledges anointing
[59:37] but to acknowledge his counsel
[59:40] and his word drag knowledge is
[59:42] revelation it's not what we think it's
[59:45] what he thinks a man and again there are
[59:49] those that can have the anointing of God
[59:50] in their flesh and the prophets that go
[59:52] to hell oh yeah well I got the anointing
[59:55] I got the anointing yeah but let's prove
[59:57] it by following his leadership a man but
[1:00:02] whoso arkin it unto me should dwell
[1:00:04] safely and shall be quiet from the fear
[1:00:09] of evil god bless his word you may be
[1:00:12] seated
[1:00:12] and turn with me to Revelation chapter 3
[1:00:17] these are scripture references that the
[1:00:20] prophet of God I lighted in the message
[1:00:22] and knoweth it not in Revelation chapter
[1:00:28] 3 and verse 14 and this is where he gets
[1:00:34] his texts and knoweth it not and unto
[1:00:40] the Angel of the Church of the
[1:00:41] Laodiceans write these things saith II a
[1:00:46] man it's finished the faithful and true
[1:00:51] witness and the beginning of the
[1:00:56] creation of God because in the beginning
[1:01:00] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:01:02] and the Word was God and he said I know
[1:01:06] thy works that thou are neither cold nor
[1:01:09] hot I would that thou wert cold or hot a
[1:01:16] man not lukewarm God doesn't like that
[1:01:23] lukewarm attitude that lukewarm spirit
[1:01:26] amen
[1:01:27] God wants you to be cold or hot to be on
[1:01:31] fire and he said I know thy works that
[1:01:36] thou art neither cold nor hot I would
[1:01:40] thou wert cold or hot so then because
[1:01:43] thou art lukewarm god help us this is
[1:01:48] serious because they are lukewarm and
[1:01:51] neither cold nor hot
[1:01:54] will spew thee out of my mouth so if
[1:01:57] you're lukewarm in your relationship
[1:01:59] with God if you're looking for man your
[1:02:01] relationship with with with the brothers
[1:02:02] and sisters of your faith if you're
[1:02:04] lukewarm a man in your relationship with
[1:02:07] Jesus brother God will spill you out of
[1:02:10] his mouth a man you'll spit you out god
[1:02:15] help us because thou sayest I am rich
[1:02:18] and increased with Goods and have need
[1:02:23] of nothing and knowest not and this was
[1:02:28] his sex and knoweth it not and this is a
[1:02:32] generation that we are living in they
[1:02:35] believe this they believe this but don't
[1:02:37] know what God sees they don't know what
[1:02:43] God is seen in you they don't know what
[1:02:45] God has seen in us what God has seen in
[1:02:47] this church it's not what you're seeing
[1:02:50] but it's not what this one Caesar that
[1:02:52] one sees what is God seen there others
[1:02:54] are there that might come and say oh
[1:02:55] this is a wonderful church and then this
[1:02:58] is a wonderful group of believers what
[1:03:00] does God feel about it does God feel the
[1:03:02] same way a man we pray the grace of God
[1:03:06] a man that we're that we have is Grace a
[1:03:09] man praise the name of the Lord it's not
[1:03:12] what a man sees is what God sees and it
[1:03:15] says because thou sayest I am rich and
[1:03:18] increased with Goods and have need of
[1:03:20] nothing well praise the Lord God has
[1:03:22] blessed me God has blessed me with this
[1:03:24] God is blessing with that that's right
[1:03:27] a man God can bless us with many things
[1:03:30] and yet not be saved a man and he said
[1:03:36] I'm need of nothing and he said and
[1:03:38] knowest not that thou art wretched just
[1:03:41] think man sees one thing God sees
[1:03:44] another mine what God said what God sees
[1:03:48] light the man silver man sees light God
[1:03:51] sees darkness just think man thinks he
[1:03:55] got life and in far as God's concerned
[1:03:57] he's dead yeah grace brother this is how
[1:04:02] seriously is the hour that we're living
[1:04:04] brothers ever an hour
[1:04:07] an age that we got to make our calling
[1:04:10] and election sure is this one a man and
[1:04:13] we got it we gotta test it with the word
[1:04:15] morning noon and night
[1:04:16] Amen Genesis to Revelation Genesis to
[1:04:19] Revelation because of the hour that
[1:04:21] we're living in why because this is the
[1:04:23] most deceiving of all ages a man and so
[1:04:27] deceiving the Bible says it would
[1:04:29] deceive the very elect if possible yeah
[1:04:32] as well bad it's going to be in this
[1:04:35] hour and in this age that were brother
[1:04:37] they never dealt with these deceiving
[1:04:39] spirits in Luther's day in Wesley's day
[1:04:41] or even in the early Pentecostal age but
[1:04:43] in this hour a man because they they
[1:04:46] were there those spirits were there but
[1:04:48] not under the extent that they are here
[1:04:50] no no it's on a day it's in a greater
[1:04:54] measure in this hour and in this age
[1:04:56] there's more of it in this on this age
[1:04:58] than it was in the other ages a man it
[1:05:01] was just a little bit in the other ages
[1:05:03] but he got worse and worse and worse
[1:05:05] andhe finally jesus warned him he says
[1:05:07] he said be careful he said because if
[1:05:10] would deceive the very elect
[1:05:12] if possible why why does he the very
[1:05:15] elect because of the anointing yeah the
[1:05:20] anointing yes they're going to be
[1:05:22] deceived oh because they got they got
[1:05:25] the the Christ anointing because it is
[1:05:27] false Christ and the part of God said
[1:05:29] what is the false it's not a false
[1:05:32] Christ he said false anointing it's a
[1:05:35] false teaching he said he says they got
[1:05:38] the oil they got her true anointing he
[1:05:39] said it's the anointing of the Holy
[1:05:41] Ghost you gonna have that he said go to
[1:05:42] hell and he's yeah I'm right but he said
[1:05:45] what stop what it what is the the the
[1:05:47] problem with it he said they're gonna
[1:05:49] teach he said that which is not right he
[1:05:52] said they'll say this and say that amen
[1:05:55] but he stern they're not going to stay
[1:05:56] with the truth the whole truth nothing
[1:05:57] but the truth
[1:05:58] a man a man is gonna head to it or take
[1:06:02] from it that's the truth just thinking
[1:06:06] that and yet they yet they know they
[1:06:08] know the anointing of God they feel the
[1:06:10] anointing of God that struck me brother
[1:06:12] when we get to that message on the
[1:06:14] anointing once at the end time anointing
[1:06:17] and we were thinking older anointed by
[1:06:18] the devil no no
[1:06:20] it's God's anointing amen but it's
[1:06:24] Satan's teaching Satan is there to
[1:06:26] influence them hey man don't let Satan
[1:06:30] influence you in your thoughts in your
[1:06:32] words or your deeds god help us
[1:06:35] amen by the weekend we could have that
[1:06:38] anointing and believe all we believe the
[1:06:40] master we've read the message we believe
[1:06:41] this we believe that a man but brother
[1:06:44] be careful Satan might be adding to it
[1:06:46] or taking from it and that's what he's
[1:06:50] done in every age god help us
[1:06:54] amen and he said thou sayest I am rich
[1:06:58] increased with Goods have need of
[1:07:01] nothing and he said and knowest not just
[1:07:06] think under the anointing they think
[1:07:09] this they think this they think that but
[1:07:11] Christ has no he said you don't know he
[1:07:16] said that you are wretched what wretched
[1:07:19] no Lord we don't feel that way do we
[1:07:22] well he's in regards to what you feel
[1:07:24] that's what you are
[1:07:26] again it's not what you think what does
[1:07:28] God think there's not what you say not
[1:07:31] what you feel is what God sees a man and
[1:07:36] God looked down and said you're Richard
[1:07:39] and you're miserable and poor and blind
[1:07:42] and naked spiritually your wretched
[1:07:47] spiritually and he said you're a poor
[1:07:50] spiritually you're a miserable
[1:07:51] spiritually and you're boring and naked
[1:07:54] huh they think they don't think that I
[1:07:56] think it's just the opposite but he said
[1:08:00] I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried
[1:08:03] in the fire that thou may us be rich and
[1:08:06] white raiment that thou mayest be
[1:08:08] clothed and that the shame of thy
[1:08:11] nakedness do not appear a man who sees
[1:08:14] it God sees it and anoint thine eyes
[1:08:18] with eyesalve that thou may is see as
[1:08:22] God wants you to see as you need to see
[1:08:25] a male need not been on our guard
[1:08:30] because of the hour we're living being
[1:08:32] on our guard because of the warning
[1:08:34] Jesus gave us they would deceive the
[1:08:37] very elect if possible why I will
[1:08:41] deceive the elect I was going I was ago
[1:08:43] me that so that their clothes that it
[1:08:45] would deceive the elect of God to
[1:08:47] deceive the seed as it were professing
[1:08:50] to be the seat and our bed is it because
[1:08:53] it's going to be false Christ's false
[1:08:57] anointed ones and false prophets and
[1:09:02] show signs and wonders yeah
[1:09:06] god help us brother make sure if they're
[1:09:11] signs and wonders to make sure it's
[1:09:12] plenty to the word not man's
[1:09:15] interpretation of the word but God's
[1:09:17] revelation of the word concerning what
[1:09:20] he has done and what he is doing and
[1:09:23] what he will do a million praise that
[1:09:26] praise the Lord brother I tell you
[1:09:28] whatever God has done your point back
[1:09:30] and he'll show you what he's doing
[1:09:32] and give you the revelation of what he's
[1:09:34] going to do press on a may and Luther
[1:09:37] press on Wesley pressed on the
[1:09:39] Pentecostals were pressing on others
[1:09:41] were pressing on a main but is the bride
[1:09:44] moving on to the resurrection and the
[1:09:46] rapture amen
[1:09:48] God Elvis brother we're not going to be
[1:09:49] here looking for this looking for that
[1:09:51] but we're gonna be here because of what
[1:09:53] we have recognized God has been and what
[1:09:55] God is doing brother it's pushing us on
[1:09:57] to the resurrection it's pushing us on
[1:10:00] to the rapture to get out of here
[1:10:01] because the world is fading away the
[1:10:06] world is getting worse and worse the
[1:10:08] Great Tribulation is coming upon the
[1:10:11] world and what we're seeing happening
[1:10:14] around the world right now brother is a
[1:10:17] token it is evidence a man that it's on
[1:10:20] its way
[1:10:21] it's beginning oh well no that's this is
[1:10:24] not it no but it's it's leading up to
[1:10:26] that oh it's gonna get worse but this is
[1:10:30] just a beginning and it's o'mine God
[1:10:33] allows this and God will love maybe
[1:10:35] something else but it's just to get our
[1:10:37] attention and to get us to look up amen
[1:10:41] any one of these messages here the
[1:10:43] prophet of God again highlights it and
[1:10:45] says God all that God's going to do this
[1:10:47] and
[1:10:48] I was going to do that you let the devil
[1:10:49] do this you let the devil do that why he
[1:10:51] said to get us look up amen
[1:10:54] for the devil thinks we're gonna look
[1:10:55] down but he said God knows if we do this
[1:10:58] and this live we let Satan do that amen
[1:11:01] he said he's gonna strike us and we'll
[1:11:03] look up for the rapture hey man
[1:11:07] brother listen the Bible tells us when
[1:11:10] this happens when that Evans look up
[1:11:11] because your Redemption draws near amen
[1:11:15] so god help us brother now take it for
[1:11:18] granted

[1:11:21] denominational Creed or a Dogma some you
[1:11:25] know oh yeah I believe this and I
[1:11:27] believe that no brothers sister it is
[1:11:29] the Living Word of God ministering to a
[1:11:31] living sons and daughters a man that are
[1:11:35] pressing on to the resurrection and the
[1:11:37] rapture a man is not looking back to
[1:11:40] what God has done is going forward to
[1:11:42] what God's going to do amen because the
[1:11:45] Lutheran stopped and just focused on
[1:11:47] what God did and the Worth and the
[1:11:49] Methodists and the others and the others
[1:11:51] and the others amen revival after eBay
[1:11:53] oh and they just stopped and focused on
[1:11:55] what God did and made a denomination out
[1:11:58] of it even under the Pentecostals God
[1:12:00] did this God knew that eight million and
[1:12:02] brother there's many a so-called message

[1:12:37] gonna bring it to pass him amen brother
[1:12:40] to someone even even the early Preta
[1:12:42] Costas brother I turn to this that they
[1:12:45] thought that the Pentecostal message was
[1:12:46] going to take us on to the rapture and
[1:12:48] the resurrection that the Pentecostal
[1:12:51] message they thought was going to bring
[1:12:53] the coming of the Lord
[1:12:54] but then when God brought it on the
[1:12:56] scene through the Ministry of a prophet
[1:12:58] they never did they knew it not amen

[1:13:20] knowledge and understanding of it
[1:13:22] and everything was focused on the
[1:13:24] intellect of what God had done and today

[1:13:29] intellectual knowledge and letter of the
[1:13:31] word of what God has done in this hour

[1:20:02] Lord would have us to consider the
[1:20:04] thoughts of the message and knoweth it
[1:20:06] not because considering the message that
[1:20:09] we've been ministering on the god of
[1:20:10] this evil age and Satan's een a man
[1:20:13] brother do we consider and do we know
[1:20:19] the truth the revelation of the god of
[1:20:21] this evil age do we know the truth and
[1:20:24] the revelation of Satan's Eden are we
[1:20:27] recognizing father the brother/sister
[1:20:29] the things that God has prophesied the
[1:20:32] things that God has revealed to us in
[1:20:34] those messages amen
[1:20:37] are people recognizing the god of this
[1:20:39] evil age not as Jehovah but as the devil
[1:20:42] a mayor the same God got such a control
[1:20:46] changer got such an influence on the
[1:20:48] people a man that he becomes as it were
[1:20:50] a god a man and now it is Satan's Eden
[1:20:56] we've gone from God's Eden now we're
[1:20:58] down into Satan's Eden a man and brother
[1:21:01] in God's Eden Satan deceived and in
[1:21:04] insane scene the world has deceived a
[1:21:06] man and again praise the Lord Alleluia
[1:21:10] amen
[1:21:12] because jesus warned us that this debt
[1:21:14] that is in the last days the deception
[1:21:17] is going to be great we have to be on
[1:21:18] our guard
[1:21:19] you don't just assume you're in the
[1:21:21] message we don't you don't just assume
[1:21:23] that I'm a believer and you know I just
[1:21:26] got no worries no because you know I
[1:21:28] believe God sent a prophet I believe the
[1:21:30] seals are open I believe the mysteries
[1:21:32] of God are revealed so I believe this
[1:21:34] you know there's going to be a
[1:21:35] resurrection there's going to be a
[1:21:36] rapture yes you believe all that but are
[1:21:39] you easy believing it in your head or in
[1:21:41] your heart a man for many they got it in
[1:21:45] their heads but they don't have it in
[1:21:46] their hearts amen and brothers not going
[1:21:48] to give you faith in your in your head
[1:21:51] no no you got to have it in your heart
[1:21:54] if it's gonna if there's gonna be be
[1:21:56] faith amen
[1:21:58] a revelation in your heart not knowledge
[1:22:00] in your head and the prophet of God does
[1:22:02] also I like that where the where the
[1:22:05] were we got the knowledge of it and the
[1:22:06] intellect of it but not not the spirit
[1:22:09] of it grace of God brother and then
[1:22:12] again there's too many so-called
[1:22:13] believers out there they got to let the
[1:22:15] intellectual letter of the other message
[1:22:17] but they don't have the spiritual
[1:22:18] revelation amen and they're motivated by
[1:22:21] the letter of it but not the spirit of
[1:22:23] it oh yeah oh oh yeah yeah the Prophet
[1:22:28] said this see again did they go by the
[1:22:32] letter of the Bible and they go by the
[1:22:34] letter what William Branham said or
[1:22:36] William Brown said this and you know
[1:22:37] what
[1:22:38] as I've said B I said some years ago I
[1:22:40] said they take the Bible and they'll
[1:22:42] skip this chapter or that chapter some
[1:22:44] they'll skip a book yeah just skip that
[1:22:48] one on there just read this one
[1:22:49] they'll just read that one I like this
[1:22:51] one I like that one yeah it's the same
[1:22:53] thing with the message of the revealed
[1:22:55] word amen brother
[1:22:57] they'll take oh that's all right you
[1:23:01] know I prefer this message I prefer that
[1:23:03] message but they're not getting into
[1:23:05] this one or getting into that one amen
[1:23:07] and if they do as I said before and
[1:23:10] after a reading reading the message as
[1:23:12] the Bible they'll skip this or that and
[1:23:14] then get into a message and you'll skip
[1:23:16] this paragraph skip that paragraph and
[1:23:18] all they're just just flip that page and
[1:23:20] go on to another one they're doing that
[1:23:23] many a believers doing it because if
[1:23:26] they weren't they wouldn't be living the
[1:23:28] way they're living that's right they
[1:23:30] wouldn't be acting the way they're
[1:23:31] acting to wouldn't have the spirit that
[1:23:32] they got they're lacking the Holy Ghost
[1:23:35] whereas one time most believers they
[1:23:38] just had the Holy Ghost praise the Lord
[1:23:40] hallelujah is all wonderful but now just
[1:23:43] came to the place where less and less
[1:23:44] and less got the Holy Ghost you know
[1:23:47] it's the truth
[1:23:47] grace to us brother you're gonna make
[1:23:51] your call and election sure make sure
[1:23:53] you got the Holy Ghost amen by the grace
[1:23:55] of God it's a generation that knows not
[1:24:00] that Satan is the god of this age it's a
[1:24:03] generation that knows not that the world
[1:24:06] is in Satan's
[1:24:08] they don't stop to consider that what's
[1:24:10] going on they just think well we got the
[1:24:12] message we don't have to worry with this
[1:24:13] they're not to worry about you do I had
[1:24:15] to consider it a man such as the
[1:24:18] absolute deception of the world we are
[1:24:21] living in it's a generation that feel
[1:24:24] they are rich increased with Goods and
[1:24:27] need of nothing brother it's three
[1:24:29] things but that tree is not perfect oh
[1:24:32] yeah rich increased with Goods have need
[1:24:36] of nothing oh yeah three three
[1:24:40] confessions of faith but it's not
[1:24:42] perfect faith yeah
[1:24:45] but Jesus said they know not what they
[1:24:51] know not that they are Richard miserable
[1:24:55] poor blind naked five that's grace
[1:25:00] but the grace they're not willing to
[1:25:02] acknowledge amen
[1:25:04] how many are willing to acknowledge what
[1:25:07] God says sees and ask forgiveness Lord
[1:25:10] forgive me for thinking that forgive me
[1:25:14] for having those ideas amen grace
[1:25:19] brother sister
[1:25:20] let's realized let's see it see
[1:25:22] ourselves as God sees us we're gonna see
[1:25:25] ourselves rich increase with goods that
[1:25:27] need of nothing but I tell you this
[1:25:29] Jesus sees us as Richard miserable floor
[1:25:32] blind that that's grace but can you
[1:25:34] accept that you're going to take the
[1:25:37] perfection or the grace the grace of
[1:25:41] Christ that sees us as we really are
[1:25:46] amen brother let's not put our faith in
[1:25:51] the flesh let's put our faith in our
[1:25:53] souls amen
[1:25:55] again oh I think for the most part most
[1:25:58] people are rich they are increased with
[1:26:01] Goods they have need of nothing yeah
[1:26:04] naturally a lot of oats spiritually
[1:26:09] because spiritually Jesus said you're
[1:26:12] Richard what I'm Richard
[1:26:14] yeah knowing that you're miserable
[1:26:17] you're poor and you're blind and you're
[1:26:20] naked what no Lord because it because
[1:26:24] the church thought they were this they
[1:26:25] were good they were fine not nothing
[1:26:27] wrong but God comes to all my see as man
[1:26:31] sees himself now let's see him as God
[1:26:33] sees him a man down through the church
[1:26:38] ages man sees this God sees that and God
[1:26:44] says repent repent brother drop us to
[1:26:50] God help us repent of our ideas god of
[1:26:53] us to repent of our of ours of our
[1:26:56] spirit trying to control us
[1:26:58] yeah god help us they are blind indeed
[1:27:03] so I pray grace to the elect and grace
[1:27:06] to the Bride of Christ brother that will
[1:27:09] not be blind to what God has done and
[1:27:12] what God is doing
[1:27:15] amen bear with me take what the Prophet
[1:27:19] is said he said let's think of the
[1:27:25] louder see in church age and it's
[1:27:28] condition does it describe you or is it
[1:27:34] just a church and he said as far as I
[1:27:39] know he said I don't see anything to
[1:27:42] enter at this time he said the coming of
[1:27:45] the Lord Jesus outside of the readiness
[1:27:48] of his church the church wasn't ready as
[1:27:52] far as he was concerned for the coming
[1:27:54] of the Lord
[1:27:54] are we ready for the rapture he's come
[1:27:59] now is getting us ready to go
[1:28:02] amen and he said I think that is one of
[1:28:07] the prophecies concerning Christ outside
[1:28:13] the church and he has
[1:28:17] and the church is not ready amen he said
[1:28:27] look at Cain's children now they went
[1:28:30] into it when the sons of God saw the
[1:28:32] daughters of men were fair and they had
[1:28:34] taken unto them but wives and God never
[1:28:37] did forgive them god help us
[1:28:44] he said God never did forgive and they
[1:28:47] perished in the wilderness he said every
[1:28:50] one of them died and he said without
[1:28:53] hope without God and is eternally lost
[1:28:56] he said damned forever he said though
[1:29:00] they had seen the goodness of God and
[1:29:02] though they had drank from the fountain
[1:29:04] that never runs dry they drank from the
[1:29:07] smitten Rock and they had seen the brass
[1:29:10] serpent perform miracles and they come
[1:29:13] out from the baptism of Moses in the sea
[1:29:16] and they had seen the hand of God and
[1:29:19] they had eaten angels food and not all
[1:29:23] those things but they married into it he
[1:29:27] said let women bring them in marry among
[1:29:30] them now he said committed not commit
[1:29:32] adultery just marry among them God never
[1:29:35] did forgive it a man why because they
[1:29:39] were not ordained to enter to mix with
[1:29:44] the others and listen though they drank
[1:29:48] water from the fountain and they drank
[1:29:50] from the smitten Rock God judged them
[1:29:53] and knowing that there was a smitten
[1:29:56] Rock God told Moses to speak but they
[1:30:01] provoked Moses Oh Moses shouldn't have
[1:30:06] done that shouldn't have done that no he
[1:30:07] shouldn't but who caused it it was the
[1:30:11] unbelief of the people it was the lack
[1:30:14] of faith of the people and Moses got
[1:30:17] upset and angry and he struck the rock
[1:30:20] and God rebuke Moses for it he said told
[1:30:25] you to speak to the rock yeah now he
[1:30:27] struck the rock and it water came forth
[1:30:30] so brother you'd be careful yeah so
[1:30:35] sometimes the ministry and brethren
[1:30:38] strike of the rock don't strike the rock
[1:30:40] of the reveal word speak the word amen
[1:30:43] amen
[1:30:45] and he said God never did forgive them
[1:30:48] for what they did in inter mingling and
[1:30:51] intermarrying and he said that's the
[1:30:53] second time it met now he should err
[1:30:55] were on a third time and more deceiving
[1:30:58] now than ever
[1:30:59] don't think you can't be to see the
[1:31:02] devil is there to deceive you that's
[1:31:05] right
[1:31:05] knowing that he shouldn't make you
[1:31:07] believe it's the truth when it's not he
[1:31:09] should make you believe it's all right
[1:31:10] but it's not oh this is God this is the
[1:31:14] Holy Ghost you'd better make sure that
[1:31:16] it's according to the Word of God make
[1:31:19] sure that it's according to the will of
[1:31:20] God what is the will of God for your
[1:31:24] life
[1:31:25] what is the leadership of God in your
[1:31:27] life we can we get feelings we want to
[1:31:29] do this we think this is all right
[1:31:30] that's all right
[1:31:31] your minute make sure it's the Holy
[1:31:32] Ghost yeah and again make sure it's the
[1:31:38] leadership of God because Satan can be
[1:31:42] there to influence you to deceive you
[1:31:46] grace the prophet of God brings out what
[1:31:54] we have quoted many times from Matthew
[1:31:57] 24 and as they set up on the Mount of
[1:32:02] Olives the disciples came unto him
[1:32:03] privately saying tell us when shall
[1:32:06] these things be what shall be the sign
[1:32:08] of thy coming and of the end of the
[1:32:11] world and Jesus said the first thing he
[1:32:14] told him he said take heed that no man
[1:32:17] deceive you amazing why because the
[1:32:21] greatest thing you're going to have to
[1:32:23] be on your guard is against deception oh
[1:32:26] not against this or that or the devil to
[1:32:29] do this the devil to do that no noises
[1:32:31] take heed that no man deceive you he did
[1:32:36] say the devil no man why because
[1:32:40] gonna be false christs they're gonna be
[1:32:43] they're gonna be men out there preachers
[1:32:46] out there they're gonna be anointed but
[1:32:48] they're gonna preach to go to teach you
[1:32:50] wrong the false teachings they're going
[1:32:53] to add to the word you're gonna take
[1:32:54] away from the word oh yeah be on your
[1:32:59] guard take Heat we'll bring out more on
[1:33:03] the on that revelation concerning false
[1:33:05] Christ's yeah oh yeah they're gonna be
[1:33:11] didn't have a true anointing but but a
[1:33:13] false teaching grace of God oh yeah the
[1:33:19] proper God brings that out other
[1:33:21] ministry and brother and bring that
[1:33:22] brought that out all that brothers
[1:33:25] anointed that brothers anointed oh
[1:33:27] that's cool that's good yeah but is the
[1:33:30] teaching watch the anointing on the
[1:33:32] teaching grace to us no wonder jesus
[1:33:39] said Jesus knowing what was going to
[1:33:41] come to pass not only what we had to
[1:33:43] deal with he said take heed that no man
[1:33:45] deceive you yea for he said there shall
[1:33:55] arise false Christ's false prophets and
[1:33:57] shall show great signs and wonders
[1:34:01] insomuch that ever were possible they
[1:34:04] would deceive the very elect if yeah
[1:34:07] very elected if possible so we think
[1:34:11] we're elect they are near gird because
[1:34:15] the deception is so great they would
[1:34:17] deceive the very elect if possible don't
[1:34:20] get don't get there cause even believers
[1:34:21] to stumble yeah to compromise grace of
[1:34:26] God the prophet of God I lights even 9
[1:34:28] to 24 in fact he reads about 15 earth
[1:34:32] there are more scriptures from Matthew
[1:34:33] 24 God Elvis grace
[1:34:42] he said the second time admit and now
[1:34:47] we're on the third time more deceiving
[1:34:49] than ever it is more deceiving now he
[1:34:53] said than ever yet it is and again it
[1:35:00] can be a spirit get on you spirit get on
[1:35:02] the path the preacher oh yeah
[1:35:04] a spirit get on the brothers get on the
[1:35:07] sister and they'll just think this way
[1:35:09] and think that way oh well yes yes and
[1:35:14] be deceived he said I know that's hard
[1:35:17] and I've often wondered in many ways how
[1:35:20] will it ever be why do I have to talk to
[1:35:23] so rational to the people he said what
[1:35:27] makes it so and yet I notice if it
[1:35:29] wasn't God there wouldn't be nobody and
[1:35:32] he said not a woman would sit and listen
[1:35:34] at me but he should they come back
[1:35:36] because there's somebody that's got an
[1:35:38] anchor of truth he said that's right
[1:35:40] regardless they know it's right he said
[1:35:44] though he said I know it's hard what
[1:35:47] what he was preaching and he was getting
[1:35:49] harder and harder and harder as he got
[1:35:52] near the end of his ministry a man a man
[1:35:55] he knew that he had to lay it in so God
[1:35:58] wouldn't wouldn't judge him for it for
[1:36:00] refusing to declare it amen
[1:36:03] and he said listen the people the women
[1:36:08] of the world the church is in the same
[1:36:09] stage he said what's the natural type
[1:36:13] the spiritual rate each time and he said
[1:36:16] I know it's not popular to say it and if
[1:36:18] a man is not ordained to say it you'd
[1:36:20] better not say it because you're
[1:36:22] impersonating and they said you'll get
[1:36:24] in trouble sure enough and he said I'm
[1:36:27] only building and he said the hour is so
[1:36:29] closer to him and he said when you're
[1:36:31] going to see something happen and when
[1:36:34] something is going to take place and he
[1:36:37] said all this background here he said
[1:36:39] has only been laying a foundation for a
[1:36:42] short quick message that will shape the
[1:36:45] whole nation a man or brother not the
[1:36:50] nation we need to shake the bright shake
[1:36:53] the people
[1:36:55] but be on your guard look at yourself
[1:36:59] look at yourself in the mirror of the
[1:37:01] word and don't deny what you're seeing
[1:37:06] don't tell hold on I'll leave that no no
[1:37:10] you've got to deal with it if you're
[1:37:12] looking in the mirror of the word and
[1:37:13] God showed you this God's truth that
[1:37:15] didn't you got to deal with it
[1:37:16] oh no I'll just leave that with the Lord
[1:37:19] no God is true God want God leave me
[1:37:21] with you you got a deal with grace to us
[1:37:28] and he said remember he said the higher
[1:37:32] you rise in God the more sinful the
[1:37:34] whole thing looks oh yeah the higher you
[1:37:38] rise in God God's required more and more
[1:37:40] and more and you want to walk more and
[1:37:42] more in line with the word
[1:37:44] oh yeah amen
[1:37:48] you want to walk and live and live more
[1:37:51] pleasing to the Lord do you never please
[1:37:55] in the name of Jesus to many believers
[1:37:56] just assume too much I don't have to
[1:37:59] worry just leave that with the Lord and
[1:38:00] go on God's leading with you he wants
[1:38:03] you to deal with it
[1:38:05] there's too many more just a little I'll
[1:38:09] let God deal with that no God wants you
[1:38:11] to deal with it and if one thing God
[1:38:13] wants you to do is acknowledge it God
[1:38:17] wanted to deal with Alinea on to first
[1:38:19] acknowledge it and you confess it to him
[1:38:23] praise the Lord he says sometimes in
[1:38:28] prayer he says you can imagine when the
[1:38:30] Holy Spirit takes you up into a sphere
[1:38:33] that the whole thing looks chaos and
[1:38:35] then when you come back down he said you
[1:38:38] seem like you're to the people you're a
[1:38:41] rascal and you're nothing but all
[1:38:44] sarcastic and he should you're a fool
[1:38:46] because you stand as an old crank always
[1:38:50] rebuking the people but he said if you
[1:38:52] ever climb into these spheres one time
[1:38:54] when you can be in the presence of God
[1:38:57] not your emotion but through the genuine
[1:39:01] Holy Spirit lifting up he said the whole
[1:39:04] thing is written Ichabod the
[1:39:08] glory of the Lord has departed from the
[1:39:10] whole outfit Ichabod
[1:39:16] see it as God sees it amen
[1:39:19] God wanted you to get up and preach all
[1:39:21] of your believers God bless just a nice
[1:39:23] for you to see is here and those online
[1:39:26] at home and so on good praise the Lord
[1:39:28] yeah what does God see what does God see
[1:39:32] is God seen a son and a daughter or a
[1:39:35] religious person race to us a man
[1:39:43] remember Ichabod the glory of Lord has
[1:39:47] departed don't forget this
[1:39:53] don't forget this now he said people can
[1:39:58] live in in this spirit they can dance in
[1:40:02] the spirit they can shout in the spirit
[1:40:05] they can go to church in the spirit and
[1:40:08] he said they can absolutely have the
[1:40:11] real spirit of god anointed on that
[1:40:14] spirit but still be lost and he said
[1:40:19] just as the devil possessed as they can
[1:40:22] be with that spirit yeah and he said you
[1:40:28] can absolutely have the real spirit of
[1:40:30] god anointed on that spirit that's on
[1:40:32] you you know you can feel oh I feel the
[1:40:36] Holy Ghost I feel the Spirit of God yeah
[1:40:37] but you better make sure that the
[1:40:40] initial spirit you're dealing with
[1:40:42] is God controlled by God not the devil
[1:40:47] because the devil knows to speak this
[1:40:50] spirit on you that spirit on you your
[1:40:51] work on that God is there to help you
[1:40:54] overcome it
[1:40:55] the devil is there to help you you to it
[1:40:57] oh yeah that's all right don't worry
[1:40:59] about it
[1:41:00] Oh - so deceiving it would deceive the
[1:41:04] very elect if possible be on our guard
[1:41:07] amen
[1:41:09] so deceiving yeah you know oh but in my
[1:41:14] eyes to death that's not serious yeah
[1:41:16] but in the eyes of God it's this serious
[1:41:19] God's looking at our faith you know
[1:41:24] believe us thou this grace
[1:41:30] he said God helped this to sink in to me
[1:41:35] the whole thing is wrong God's Word is
[1:41:38] the ultimate and whatever that word says
[1:41:41] he said that's right and now he said the
[1:41:44] only way up here in these spheres that
[1:41:46] you could ever be in this little inside
[1:41:49] man he said you have to be for ordained
[1:41:51] because you were with God and you're a
[1:41:54] part of God amen
[1:41:56] he said I was in my father and I was
[1:42:00] also in my grandfather my grandfather's
[1:42:02] grandfather by seed I was in that and I
[1:42:07] was in Christ and you were in Christ
[1:42:09] before the foundation of the world and
[1:42:11] he came to redeem his own in his own
[1:42:14] that was in him hallelujah his children
[1:42:16] that was in him he came to redeem us
[1:42:21] those that he saw in theophany form he
[1:42:25] come to redeem his seed amen and
[1:42:29] brothers were truly redeemed a man truly
[1:42:34] forgiven truly got the revelation of it
[1:42:36] the Spirit of redemption brother we're
[1:42:39] going to we're going to live on a level
[1:42:40] that religious people don't live on
[1:42:44] we're higher by the grace of God
[1:42:50] he said he never come to deceive or he
[1:42:53] never come rather to save the devil's
[1:42:55] children he said they never will know it
[1:42:58] and they are so shrewd in the ways of
[1:43:01] their intellectual learning yeah he said
[1:43:04] that you can't compare with them at all
[1:43:06] and he's you can't talk them but he said
[1:43:09] by faith you see it by the grace of God
[1:43:13] amen
[1:43:24] they're with me amen and brother branham
[1:43:39] explains the dreams that certain
[1:43:45] brethren had for their junior Jackson at
[1:43:49] a dream and he explained it's rather
[1:43:52] random yeah putting brother Branham on
[1:43:57] his guard because of his ministry and
[1:44:04] brother Leo Mercer at a dream I don't
[1:44:09] have time to get into those dreams and
[1:44:11] brother Roy Roy rather Roy Roberson at a
[1:44:16] dream three of those brothers had dreams
[1:44:19] and they all come to brother Branham
[1:44:21] because all the dreams were for brother
[1:44:25] Branham you know to put brother Brett
[1:44:28] and brother Branham as they were on his
[1:44:30] garden on his toes concerning what was
[1:44:32] going on in his life brother of God
[1:44:35] dealt with the Prophet in that way how
[1:44:37] much more is God going to deal with us
[1:44:42] grace Sewell brother to have that
[1:44:45] humility to humble ourselves to what
[1:44:49] we're seeing in the mirror of the word
[1:44:51] oh I see this and I see that my brother
[1:44:55] come here when it comes to the word the
[1:44:58] word is here to correct us the word is
[1:45:01] there to get us to line up with the will
[1:45:02] of God what is the will of God amen
[1:45:09] brother sisters does not just apply the
[1:45:13] will of God to just spiritual well it's
[1:45:16] the will of God for the believe there's
[1:45:17] one God the will of God to believe you
[1:45:19] know and water baptism in the name it's
[1:45:21] the will of God to believe this well
[1:45:22] what what is the will of God for your
[1:45:24] life are you in the will of God for your
[1:45:30] life doing what God wants you to do and
[1:45:34] again when where and how
[1:45:37] I want you to do it there's a lot of
[1:45:39] believers brother they might be in the
[1:45:41] will of God spiritually when it come
[1:45:42] when it comes to or the doctrines of the
[1:45:45] scripture of the Bible and they know I
[1:45:47] believe this I believe that yeah but are
[1:45:49] you in the will of God for your life
[1:45:52] your day-to-day living I'll tell you
[1:45:58] this that's not there's not not many
[1:46:00] believers that are in the will of God
[1:46:01] for their day-to-day living and I'd like
[1:46:05] to be honest you know by grace of God
[1:46:07] that I have constantly in in in in
[1:46:10] growing up and in in education and
[1:46:12] getting getting a job getting training
[1:46:14] getting this getting that I I would
[1:46:17] always said Lord what is your will do
[1:46:21] you want me to do this Lord because I've
[1:46:24] got training for this and I got training
[1:46:26] for that or something else and then the
[1:46:29] Lord is this your will so I prayed about
[1:46:32] it and then ask goddess Lord if he sure
[1:46:34] will then I'm asking you to to let this
[1:46:38] work out this way let this happen this
[1:46:40] way and and the Lord would if it was his
[1:46:42] will the Lord did it that way as I asked
[1:46:45] him amen
[1:46:48] this is absolutely amazing so but how
[1:46:52] many people and it's for the glory of
[1:46:55] God but how many believers today make
[1:46:59] decisions without seeking the will of
[1:47:01] God
[1:47:02] I'll let the be honest most believers
[1:47:04] get up I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do
[1:47:06] that and and they just go do it they
[1:47:08] don't stop to consider maybe it's not
[1:47:09] the will of God oh well I don't think
[1:47:11] the Lord mine if I do this I don't think
[1:47:14] the lord of mine if I go here go there
[1:47:15] no yeah he died he will so the Bible
[1:47:19] says sons and daughters of God are led
[1:47:21] by the Spirit of God amen and in all
[1:47:25] your ways you acknowledge him that's the
[1:47:29] Bible but yet most people think all I
[1:47:31] got to do is is acknowledge God
[1:47:33] spiritually and in my baptism in the
[1:47:35] church I go to and this no it's in
[1:47:37] everyday living so there's not you that
[1:47:39] lives it's Christ that liveth in you and
[1:47:42] I allowed to be honest it's not correct
[1:47:43] Christ is not living in many believers a
[1:47:45] few because there's only a few others
[1:47:48] going to seek the Lord and to seek his
[1:47:50] counsel
[1:47:51] nice we'll what is your will Lord a man
[1:47:53] god help us because again many have
[1:47:58] their will based on reading rich
[1:48:00] increased with Goods and have need of
[1:48:02] nothing oh I believe that's the will of
[1:48:04] God yeah oh yeah
[1:48:07] oh God Oh Lord you bless me well you did
[1:48:10] this you did that
[1:48:11] and Jesus said you're Richard you're
[1:48:14] miserable you're poor and you're blind
[1:48:18] and you're naked
[1:48:19] why no Lord so we got this and we got
[1:48:23] that yeah but that God didn't give it to
[1:48:25] you that was you under the anointing of
[1:48:28] the devil oh yeah
[1:48:31] Satan told Jesus you do this and I'll do
[1:48:34] I'll give you this you do that and I'll
[1:48:37] give you this you worship me and he's on
[1:48:39] my I'll give you the control of the
[1:48:41] kingdoms of the world yeah
[1:48:44] I think I said Satan Satan as I would
[1:48:46] dare to do this say I would do that and
[1:48:48] people think it's God and it's not and
[1:48:53] Jesus said get behind me Satan how many
[1:48:57] would say that most today would think oh
[1:49:00] that's God Lord you blessed me oh you've
[1:49:04] got to prosper me you're gonna do that
[1:49:06] no sometimes God takes it away from
[1:49:07] there not give to you yeah well for you
[1:49:12] bring in your faith also that's alright
[1:49:13] Lord I know and you lead you but you'll
[1:49:15] be with me and you'll help me and you
[1:49:17] you you take me through yeah you know
[1:49:21] and if he blesses you then you're not
[1:49:24] gonna you're not gonna put your emphasis
[1:49:25] on that you're gonna say thank you Jesus
[1:49:27] oh I'll do it I'll use it for your glory
[1:49:31] glory they are said a month on eternity
[1:49:34] no most want to use it for their own
[1:49:37] glory but not the glory of God grace
[1:49:43] amen it's like that man just think when
[1:49:49] the prophet of God was here he was here
[1:49:51] and he was a millionaire and he would
[1:49:55] help support the ministry yeah but he
[1:49:59] didn't start out he started out very
[1:50:01] good but just remember what he did
[1:50:04] oh yeah he had a house and he had this
[1:50:07] knee had that it was good good good and
[1:50:09] finally in a dream the Lord dealt with
[1:50:12] him and told him to sell his house or to
[1:50:16] give it not sell it he give it to
[1:50:17] somebody yeah give it to somebody he
[1:50:21] mentioned to his wife and it was to a
[1:50:23] preacher I think and he told the dream
[1:50:26] to his wife she said yes she said I
[1:50:28] believe it and so they did it the will
[1:50:33] of God and where do they go from there
[1:50:36] gave this person that house they moved
[1:50:39] out and he moved into somebody they knew
[1:50:42] that was that was where it rich and she
[1:50:45] told them that they could live in the
[1:50:47] inner garage so they would left her
[1:50:50] house and went and lived in the garage
[1:50:52] oh yeah that's where they lived they
[1:50:56] slept morning noon and night and he went
[1:50:58] and did work here did that did that but
[1:51:00] they said did all they could do for this
[1:51:03] woman yeah - finally
[1:51:05] God blessed him and he became a
[1:51:08] millionaire yeah why God blessed him but
[1:51:16] he paid the price and if God took it
[1:51:18] from him he didn't mind if God gave it
[1:51:21] to him thank the Lord and he used it for
[1:51:24] the glory of God oh yeah
[1:51:26] and God and brother he came and he
[1:51:29] supported brother Branham he would have
[1:51:32] me to help here or help there and help
[1:51:34] somewhere else support of other others
[1:51:35] or their ministries as well it's her
[1:51:37] brother
[1:51:38] but if God took it from him he'd
[1:51:41] accepted as the will of God would you
[1:51:51] grace a tent or a cottage why should I
[1:51:57] care I like what that brother said he
[1:52:02] preached it years ago and I got it on
[1:52:04] tape somewhere and he said he said
[1:52:07] you're gonna he said yes where you sing
[1:52:08] he said the biggest lies you said you
[1:52:11] tell is in church he you sing those lies
[1:52:14] in church he said a tenor a cottage why
[1:52:17] should I care they're building a mansion
[1:52:18] for me over there but he should you do
[1:52:20] care he says not many say can really
[1:52:24] sing it and it's the truth most want a
[1:52:30] cottage but they don't want to tempt
[1:52:31] delivah but there's others out there
[1:52:34] they got the right spirit and right
[1:52:36] attitude if the Lord told to go live an
[1:52:38] attempt they live in a tent like that
[1:52:40] man lived in that courage yeah oh yeah
[1:52:45] if God wanted him stay there he'd stay
[1:52:46] there
[1:52:47] amen not my will father time be done and
[1:52:51] because he's added he was right the
[1:52:53] Spirit was right God left him a man to
[1:52:57] God be the glory
[1:53:01] listen he said
[1:53:13] referring to brother I Roberson's dream
[1:53:22] and he said it pact you toward the West
[1:53:24] brother branham he said I cried and walk
[1:53:28] the streets and after a while I went and
[1:53:30] sat at the table I happen to look up
[1:53:33] there at the head of the table and I
[1:53:36] could just see that much of you was snow
[1:53:39] weight and you were standing there and
[1:53:42] said you spoke with authority and there
[1:53:44] was no guessing to it every man
[1:53:47] understood exactly what you said oh my

[1:54:00] me warn you as a minister the gospel
[1:54:03] don't take any foolishness
[1:54:06] don't imagine not anything stay right
[1:54:08] there until this inside of the inside is
[1:54:12] anchored to the word that you're right
[1:54:16] in Christ because there's only one thing
[1:54:19] going that's going because we're in the
[1:54:22] most deceiving age that we ever lived in
[1:54:25] it would deceive the very elect if
[1:54:28] possible because they have anointing and
[1:54:30] they can do anything like the rest of
[1:54:32] them he said clean up your lives pay
[1:54:36] your debts and oh no man he said in the
[1:54:41] name of the Lord
[1:54:42] something is fixing to happen again this
[1:54:46] was august 65 and not long after that

[1:55:17] and still moving on by the grace of God
[1:55:21] toward the resurrection and rapture how
[1:55:23] much longer I pray and pray

[1:56:27] end of time to get into eternity grace

[1:56:37] going on in the world
[1:56:39] the coronavirus that's just not
[1:56:44] something casual but I believe is one of
[1:56:49] the signs of the end because again the
[1:56:54] prophet of God warned concerning the
[1:56:55] Greek this is going to happen he said in
[1:56:57] the world this is going to happen that's
[1:56:59] going to happen he's to remember he said
[1:57:01] there's coming a Great Tribulation upon
[1:57:05] the world and all that's going on now is
[1:57:07] going to lead to that Great Tribulation
[1:57:09] don't assume is just a casual thing it's
[1:57:12] just such just so it did that just
[1:57:13] happen that just happened no no brother
[1:57:16] I pray God that it's going to produce in
[1:57:19] us what the Scriptures tells us it
[1:57:21] should look up how many believers are
[1:57:25] really looking up for the rapture now
[1:57:27] expecting any time to experience the
[1:57:29] change many believers were taking a
[1:57:32] casual oh well that's God judging the
[1:57:34] world God join oh yeah there's in the
[1:57:36] world what's he doing for the bride
[1:57:38] you know the world's gonna do this
[1:57:41] world's gonna do that God is doing this
[1:57:43] guy's doing that but what's he looking
[1:57:44] for in the bright he's looking for that

[1:58:25] time for a wishy-washy give in
[1:58:29] compromising spirit in a person or in a
[1:58:34] church he said where's a man that is
[1:58:40] standing for what's right he said where
[1:58:42] is a man he said that's not afraid to
