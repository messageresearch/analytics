body soul and spirit lord lift up those that are down lord strengthen those that are broken lord heal those that are sick lord bring in those that are lost we pray in jesus christ's name we ask him amen amen if you'll turn in your scriptures this morning to luke chapter 1 luke chapter 1 amen good to be back in the house of the lord i've missed a lot of church recently between the cancellations and i've been sick and then when i wasn't sick it was kids that were sick and so i gave my wife a break and i'm still not 100 my voice is still somewhat off and i'm still hacking and coughing at times so i trust the lord will get me through this service amen but certainly thankful for the saints prayers and then i also want to thank the church just for their love and support for not only for me but for my family through the last year as you well know we don't have blood family here and so you guys are our family and you guys have stepped out of your ways to make us involved in your family things and include us and make sure that we feel loved and appreciated and i just want to thank you from from being my wife amen luke chapter one we're going to have a christmas new year's message this morning going to take a break from from the beating that we've been getting recently and uh and we'll go into just uh something that'll hopefully encourage us this morning and then luke chapter 1 verse 26 says and in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail thou that are highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women amen you can take your seats this morning may god add his blessing to the reading of the word amen this is perhaps a little bit of a different christmas and new year's message but the wonderful thing about when we read about the birth of jesus is there are so many things going on that you can applied in so many different ways and so before we opened our gifts at christmas i was reading this this portion of scripture and just uh something jumped out of me and and said you need to preach on that so we'll get to that scripture a little bit later but and then when you when you feel that unction you want to be able to move i mean you don't want to just stay where you are and where what's comfortable but just take that and go so i like i said it's it's been a bit of a tougher tougher run of series you know it's really challenging to us it's getting down to where rubber meets the road so this morning trusting that the lord will encourage us this morning and i want to take a title this morning of our belief his performance amen our belief his performance now we start with this beautiful event that happens here and it's a story well known to us and we see here mary just a young woman and they don't actually know mary's age but they estimate anywhere between 14 and 16 years old barely a woman if we could put it that way and she's walking through life and she's young and she's clean and she's beautiful and she's undefiled she's a real believer she's she's living her life according to what she's been taught you know and like many others at the world at that time you know mary doesn't jump out in any way perhaps from those that were around her if she were to walk through the synagogue nobody would say that mary was any greater or maybe even any lesser than anyone else she was just a regular person but yet we see here in luke chapter one and let's stay here this morning keep your bibles there because we'll spend our entire service there but in luke chapter one we have something happens and that's that in the sixth month the angel gabriel was sent from god into a city of galilee named nazareth now i want to start here because when god sends an angel the prophet of god says something's about to happen amen and he says very clearly in the message believe us thou this he says notice now when anything's going to happen on the earth first god sends a messenger and that messenger is anointed by an angel now in this sermon right here at the start he's actually talking about the birth of john the baptist and an angel comes to a man and that man takes the message amen so he says there's always a messenger but then there's an angel to that messenger amen we see that in the life of brother branham where he had the angel of the lord there you remember and he would come to him and then he would bring it to us he says and that messenger is anointed by an angel now sometimes minor angels come there's minor angels and major angels now this angel that came was gabriel who stands in the presence of god that was something major and he came down and when gabriel comes from heaven remember something's going to happen so this is a major event that's happening in mary's life we read that to say this mary is about to step into a major event because gabriel doesn't come down to just tell people things amen he's not just the casual messenger that god sends a thousand times a day to believers perhaps around the world but this is the angel this is the right hand man of almighty god he comes directly from the throne of god and says i have a message for you mary and then there's a special time that's about to happen and you need to know about it and verse 27 says he came who to a virgin espoused that means engaged to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin's name was mary now i want to point something out here because joseph isn't where he's supposed to be for this prophecy if you notice he is of the city of david he is from the city of bethlehem but he's not there yet but yet the prophecy is about to come into position amen there's something about to happen even though joseph is not where he has to be just yet amen mary is not of the line of david mary is not told that she is of the line of david but she is of somebody else as far as we know i haven't checked that i might be wrong but as far as i know mary was not of the line of david necessarily the way joseph was but yet she's brought in by marriage she's brought in by engagement no matter what her background is she's tied to the man and so she's tied to the prophecy that she's going to be of the lineage in the household of david when she brings forth this messiah because the messiah has to come from the house of david in terms of the natural lineage amen so everything is set in place here for what the prophecy to be fulfilled and if prophecy is going to come fulfilled then something has to be in its place amen god has to move things around he has to get people in place remember brother braham said when he saw the vision he says if there was a hat over there he says that hat had to be there before the vision could take place and he said i couldn't do it and nobody else could do it except the one that had that hat i couldn't force the prophecy i couldn't force the vision to take place and what we see here is god putting things into their place amen people that don't even realize they're part of the prophecy are being put into their place so that god can bring it to reality in their life amen because what once god has declared it's going to be one way it can only come that way god doesn't change his plan god doesn't change his word god doesn't change his way what god says will be because god cannot lie amen so we see here that god is setting up for prophecy to be fulfilled and god had to arrange for a clean woman right a believing woman a virgin of the right household or that was going to marry into the right household to be available for this prophecy to happen amen and until this angel speaks nobody knows that they're going to be a part of it amen that's what we need to understand in our lives sometimes is that even though god hasn't spoken yet yet there may be something that we don't know that's going to be fulfilled in our life amen we've got to be what doing as mary did walking along faithful in what we believe and trusting that we're going to be a part of something at some point amen that we are not here without purpose that we're not here without a plan but god has us here for a purpose and it is to fulfill prophecy amen we are a prophetic age amen we're in the eagle anointing here we've had a prophet that comes to us and he's brought us something that is for us each in particular specifically amen god has something for brother david god has something for sister maureen for brother mark and down through the church each and every one of us have a part to play and an angel has come to us amen that is what he came as he came to tell us that you were a part of something that's going to happen in this age amen now listen brother braham says this he says when god has spoke anything he will perform it now he's speaking about prophecy in general now he says amen you believe that he's going to have a church i don't know who's in it but he's going to have a church without spot or wrinkle it's somebody amen i don't know who it is but it'll be there you say where will they get it i don't know but it's going to be there for god has said so and god can't lie so he said in the principle don't worry about the how just worry about the what if you know the what then the how it doesn't matter because god said it and you don't have to worry you can take it and believe that it's going to happen amen amen mary and joseph were alive a long time joseph was quite a bit older than mary as best we know right he had no clue that he was going to be the father of the messiah he had no idea about it he had lived for maybe 40 50 years walking through life and he had no idea that he was tied into the scriptures amen but yet he was a part of it and not doing it yet amen but until god starts working in their lives they can't know but as soon as he does religion starts to become reality amen prophecy starts to unfold and they realize hey i'm a part of what he's been talking about a long time verse 28 says and the angel came in unto her and said hail beca or thou that are highly favored the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women the angel pulls her out from the entire crowd and says among all of the women you are blessed amen of all the people on earth you are blessed mary there's only one can fulfill this and you're the one amen you're the one that's going to fulfill this you're blessed because you've been chosen mary amen you've been highly favored and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be because he hasn't told her what she's got that's going to make her so blessed yet but he says you're blessed and highly favored now i've never had an angelic visitation in this way and i would imagine if he came an angel came to me i'd be wondering well what's this all about amen especially the angel gabriel i'm sure he was a mighty angel you know very imposing in his appearance and i'm sure mary had never had an angelic visitation all of a sudden he's standing there and he's proclaiming that you're special mary you're blessed and highly favored and she's saying well what's this all about what have i done what is it that's going to be so amazing you know is it a million shekels i'm going to win tomorrow in the judean lottery you know am i gonna have a wonderful life am i gonna have you know the the greatest king born perhaps maybe i'm gonna be part of the revolution who knows what was going through her head she doesn't understand because it hasn't been told or her part but she knows that something's about to happen that's really amazing amen but there's going to i want to say that to say this that there's got to come a place and a time in your life where god starts to speak to you by name where he says you are blessed and you are highly favored and you have a plan and you have a purpose and you have a role to play and i'm about to tell you what that is and we've got to be open to what he says our role and our and and his plan is for us amen there's got to be a time where that religion starts to become a reality where there's a relationship that develops out of all the things that we've heard and all the things we've been taught and all the services we've attended and all the preachers we've we've sat under there has to come a time where it becomes a reality and god says let's put it into react into reality now let's put it into a purpose let's put it into your life and take everything you've had to this point and make something out of it amen because mary didn't get here by happenstance she had kept her life clean she was a clean vessel for the coming messiah amen she had to be there and that was why because mary had taken the word seriously she had taken what the priest had taught she'd taken what her parents had taught and she'd held it in her heart and she'd done the right thing but it was for a purpose we don't just do the right thing to do the right thing but there's a purpose behind it and it is to make us prepared to bring forth life amen it is to make us prepared to bring forth a word for our day amen i don't care what your doctrine is in and of itself you've got to have the right doctrine but the right doctrine is not going to make you what god needs you to be it's a part of it amen i don't care how good your church is i don't care how good your pastor is the ministry you is your bloodline your family your schooling none of this matters that what matters is are you going to be ready when he speaks to you amen are you going to answer the call because how many have sat in a perfect church with perfect ministries and perfect doctrine and then god comes their way and they walk away amen they're too happy to sit with the understanding of it and and the teaching of it but they don't want to step into the reality of the word for their day but mary's willing to do it as we'll see amen amen we have to be able to see past the pages of the bible past the flawed men and the pulpits plus our our our parents that didn't do everything right and and past the things that have gone wrong in our life and see that there is a god behind it that is orchestrating all these things to bring us to a place where he can talk to us and we can respond in a way that will receive what he has for us amen brother braham says this he's talking about mary amen he says he came to a simple plain humble believer hallelujah he says he that's the way he does today too you don't entice god by the way you dress as in god doesn't come to you based on the way you dress you entice god by the way you live and think and act now i'm sure mary dressed right but what entices him he says is the way you live the way you think and you act he says god help us to get back to the old-fashioned holy ghost gospel i believe in it don't you old time backwoods sky blue sin killing religion that's right it'll help you and it'll save you what we've got to a place where what we've got is so much doctrine and so much truth and it is truth but we've missed out the fact that we've got to live it not just know it and that's what mary was doing was she was walking in a way that was pleasing to god we know right the angel said to her in verse 30 he says fear not mary for thou hast found favor with god and behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth the son and shall call his name jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the lord god shall give unto him the throne of his father david now he's telling her what this is all about and she is going to be the linchpin in the fulfillment of all of the law and the prophets they've been looking forward to this day where they would wouldn't have to sacrifice anymore they wouldn't have to go to the temple for all the feasts and this and that the other thing she is going to be the one that brings forth the messiah that they've been looking for for what four thousand years four thousand years is going to be fulfilled in mary's life and she's just a simple plain humble believer amen we're gonna have six thousand years fulfilled in our life six thousand years of waiting for what a full redemption and it's going to happen to who plain simple believers amen it's not going to be the big whats the big whos the big halves amen it's going to be the plain simple believers that'll just take him at his word and live that clean simple life before him and trust that he's going to do what he has to do in their lives amen verse 33 says and he shall reign over the house of jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end he say mary you're going to fulfill prophecy you're going to be the vessel through which everything that you've ever hoped for will come can you imagine that can you imagine if today an angel came to you and said sister brenda you're going to kick off the rapture can you that's that's literally what we're talking about here is in your life something's going to happen that's going to trigger the greatest thing that ever happened on this earth which was the redemption promise of god amen but it's no different for us he's going to come to you and he has come to you and said you're gonna be a part of it now this time it's not just one person it's a multi-member body amen all of us have to give birth to the word in this in this time in this age amen but that angel is coming to you and he's saying it's gonna start in you and it's gonna start in you and it's going to start in you and it's going to start in you until the whole thing just takes off and we're out of here amen what there's going to come a place where he fulfills his word amen in his completeness amen he's talking to mary that little old girl little tiny girl nothing there's nothing special about mary from the outside as far as we know amen plain simple believers it's not going to be the great ones amongst us and then it's not going to be the prettiest it's not going to be the greatest speakers it's not going to be the ones that have the answers all the time and then it's going to be the simple humble victorious believer that's going to walk out of here amen it's not going to be the most gifted one the most popular one this is not what's going to take us into that place amen it's going to be the simple humble believer that gets you there amen he's got to get you to be a nobody that's what he's trying to do he's trying to get jonathan curlett to be a nobody so that he can be something amen and he's got to do the same thing in each and every one of us get us to the place where we are nobodies amen well we are absolutely nothing and then he can fill that up and he can do something amazing with it you look at the ones that were great people in the in the in the scriptures you look at moses moses was a great somebody wasn't he moses had many years of training he had years of luxury he had all the strength he had all the military prowess he had the intellectual knowledge that was needed to deliver the children and what to do god do god took him in the backside of the desert for 40 years and beat the daylights out of him until he couldn't even talk that's where he ended up and then he came out with what power and demonstration because he knew there was not in his sufficiency it was in the sufficiency of the god that called him to do it in the first place amen he had all the position and all the power to do it in the first place god took him out of it and then brought him back with what god's strength not his with god's knowledge with god's word with god's understanding and that's what gave them an exodus out of out of egypt amen now he says what the holy ghost is going to come upon you and overshadow you sorry then said mary unto the angel how shall this be seen that i know not a man it's a great question i'm sure mary knew about the birds and the bees at this point and she knows to have a baby a man's got to be involved she also knows she hasn't had any relationship with any man so she says how's this going to happen i i'm not disbelieving you but i need to know the mechanism here i need to know how this is supposed to happen because i'm pure and i have no intention of being anything but pure so tell me how this is going to happen amen it's funny because mary is talking to a supernatural being she's talking to the angel gabriel and yet he's talking about a supernatural event happening and she's saying how while she's experiencing the supernatural right there it seems like it wouldn't be too big of a leap to say the supernatural is going to continue amen when god starts something supernatural expect the supernatural to continue amen but she's sure she says i don't know how this is supposed to be no doubt she's read the scripture and it says a virgin will conceive and she's she's saying i know how that that that's in there but how is it going to happen lord how is it going to happen what is it she's in a fallen condition she knows there's no spoken word babies anymore there's nothing that's going to happen perhaps the way it should have in the garden of eden something's going to have to change inside of mary because otherwise she needs a man to make this happen right isn't that really our trouble half the time is we're sitting here and we're believing in a supernatural god we've experienced the supernatural we've heard the supernatural we've seen the supernatural and then we run up against something and we say how is it going to happen it's going to happen the same way it always has god said therefore it will be right it is the supernatural from start to finish it's supernatural that you wake up every morning right it's supernatural that you're provided in this in this crazy age that we're in it's supernatural that we have our health it's supernatural that we have our sanity we just don't recognize it so often because it's become common to us but we are living supernatural lives that we can stay apart from this world every day of our lives amen so all it's looking for is just that little bit more of supernatural amen whether it's the healing of your body whether it's the saving of of your kids souls whether it's a change in your life that's needed whatever it is he's just looking you to take that next step forward amen and just say the supernatural has started so let's keep expecting the supernatural god to work in our lives amen we've got to look beyond what we can see beyond what we hear and do what seeing here by eyes and ears of faith amen amen but god's gracious to mary he has an answer for it says in the angel answer and said unto her the holy ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of god can i rephrase that this morning mary you won't have to do a thing mary it won't have to do with you mary you won't have a part in it whatever's going to happen in you is going to be supernatural mary when it comes to bringing forth the prophecy of god when it comes to bringing forth the promise of god mary you don't have a place in this all you have to do is sit still and the holy spirit is going to do the work inside of you and mary you probably won't even know when it happens do you know why brother braham says that we could have the anointing or the the the holy spirit without sensation because mary had it right here she did not have a sensation as far as she knew when conception occurred in her womb there wasn't something to tell her it had happened no doubt the next morning she started maybe to have morning sickness you know maybe the little poof started to appear in her belly or something like that but as far as we know there was nothing to tell mary that it had happened and yet it had happened and mary knew that and something changes in her life amen but this is what we have to understand friends is when we're looking to the supernatural it's not you that can do it mary can't sing herself into having the messiah she can't worship herself into having the messiah she can dance around the altar into having the messiah all she can do is trust that what he said will happen and move forward now there's one thing mary can do and we'll get to it in a little bit amen but the angel continues and this is a beautiful time because he says and behold thy cousin elizabeth she had also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who is called baron so elizabeth has john the baptist in her stomach and he's six months in there he says for with god nothing shall be impossible now elizabeth was past the time of bearing children so he points her and he says look there's another supernatural birth that's happening and she's your cousin and she's having the same thing you're having but in a different way but it's supernatural nonetheless and she's going to have a baby and he's going to be supernatural as well and mary said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word and the angel departed from her now mary never sees this angel again she has one experience with the angel gabriel and that's it right and that's all mary needed if you notice that's all mary needed she just needed him to tell her what and how and she was ready to go and she said be it unto me according to that word she didn't question she didn't doubt she just took it and she said whatever you say let it happen to me and she moved forward with it amen that's the place we have to find ourselves is where what we take the one word and we move forward when god says it when he quickens it to our heart we can take it and move forward and it has nothing to do with what we do say or feel amen we can move forward because god is the one that said it but watch what happens here brother branham is speaking of he's blending the two stories of john the baptist in jesus birth he says now i want you to know something come closely look when the angel came to the priest zacharias and told him that elizabeth was going to have a child by him he had plenty of examples before that hannah had had a child past age of baring sarah nearly a hundred years old or better had brought a child after the age of bearing plenty of examples but that callous priest failed to believe god but mary never she never questioned now when the angel came to zacharias it was the same angel gabriel and he had the same message your wife was going to have a child and he's going to be a special child but zachariah didn't have faith and brother branham says the reason why zachariah is struck mute is because he had examples to go by and he refused to believe the examples mary asked the same question as zachariah zechariah said how mary said how but in zechariah's case it was unbelief that asked how because brother bram says he had all the examples already he had his very line came from out of impossibility and he disbelieved amen but mary she was asked to do something that had never happened before she was allowed to ask how and it wasn't unbelief it was just clarification for her but zechariah was doubt that was asking and that's why he was struck mute but mary never she never questions he said behold the handmaid of the lord be it unto me according to thy word notice she didn't wait till she was positive she didn't wait till she felt something and felt life she started right then praising god for it for she had his promise brother brown continues he says brother sister give us some more mary's here who will take god at his word and not wait till you feel something or something happens take his word and start rejoicing about it hallelujah god said he's the healer i believe it he said he created me i believe it take his word and start rejoicing about it hallelujah that's the kind of people we need she went right around telling everybody she was going to have the baby and wasn't no sign or nothing of it she didn't have to have any signs only thing she had to have was god's word that's all we have to have god said so that settles it with me what about you believe it take him at his word and say it so and just go ahead that's all you have to have is his word it's bound to bring it forth he says you believe it brother stay with it hallelujah that's right stay with it it will bring results every time i've never seen it fail when a true heart comes before god and means business and took god at his word and started testifying of it and looking to the unseen then then god's promises always produces what it's asked for that's right amen we preached before that jesus christ is the high priest of one thing only our confession amen what is he saying he's saying confess his word i love mary said be it unto me according to thy word amen we get a lot of people talking words today and they're speaking things you see it in these ministries of spoken word for riches and wealth and and all of these things and they're speaking money into their lives and they're speaking this and that mary said beat unto me according to thy word and then mary went around and started repeating his word she didn't add to it she didn't take from it she just said what he said and she moved forward in it in full faith and belief amen amen we better be speaking his word amen you'll get into so much trouble if you start adding to or taking from we want to be able to take it back to his word to his promise for this age for me and for you amen but watch what happens to mary after this and this is a beautiful thing and mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into a city of judah and entered into the house of zacharias and saluted elizabeth the first thing mary does is she goes for some fellowship with somebody else that's going through the same thing she's going through amen what does she do she goes to confirm the word with somebody else that's received a prophetic message and then brother branham prints this beautiful drama here and it's maybe a little bit of a side path but i wanted to include it this morning i thought it was a good instruction for us and he says i can see elizabeth sitting here on the porch maybe doing her work knitting or whatever she might be doing and mary comes up real quick as soon as mary comes she sees elizabeth my both christian women as we would call today ran out and threw their arms around one another hugged one another kiss one another saluting each other oh i like that i like a good warm feeling don't you i hate that old corn cold formal way we've got people today they're so far away from one another you don't care for one another that's what's the matter even church members get the same way they don't care for one another why if anybody does anything wrong try to shove them down don't shove them down pick them up help them that's right don't try to criticize him and tell somebody else go to him with your arms around him and today they got so afraid they don't even want to shake hands anymore now we don't do that because of cove at half the time but he's saying just because you're not what in communion with one another there's not a unity there something's happened he says they don't even want to shake hands anymore he says you don't know who's sitting right next to you today and in church and that fellows made a mistake that's one of god's sons or god's daughters don't turn them down help him that's right put an arm around him you don't know what god could do with him if you just help him a little bit that's right amen when i was reading this i thought that was a good reminder amen don't let things come between us don't let mistakes or misunderstandings come between us amen let's help each other and do what see what god will do in our lives it's i love what he says there you don't know what god would do with him if you just help him a little if you'll just be the one that steps out that lifts them up that encourages that restores whatever the case may be if you'll do that you never know what god might be able to do with that person amen too quickly we move to criticize don't we we moved to criticize we moved to point out the flaws and the mistakes and the whatever it might be that's going on you know but he says don't do that he says don't put him down don't criticize her what put your arms around them draw them back in amen what drew mary to elizabeth was what a commonality a commonality for a supernatural birth and that's the commonality we preached about here amen if somebody else has that new birth you ought to be able to if they're a brother and brother you you can put your arms around if it's a sister shake her hands amen but we ought to be able to greet one another and be close to one another and encourage one another and then to draw each other in if we're if we're in commonality with that supernatural birthday meant by the holy spirit in our lives amen we ought to be able to hug the neck of every person that's got the holy ghost verse 41 says and it came to pass that when elizabeth heard the salutation of mary the babe leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost when i read this i thought when's the last time my conversation or my greeting had that kind of effect on a person and then when somebody sees me coming when i speak to somebody do they perk up right does something in them kind of rise up and well up that's life that's love that's encouragement that's growth that's strength or do they see me coming and they start to wilt a little bit inside and say what's he going to say to me today i thought it was great her greeting caused life inside of elizabeth amen we ought to bring life to one another amen we ought to be able to stir up the life that's already in there if we could put it that way when you come to a brother or sister and they say hey he's coming to my house she's coming to my house we're going to have a good time in the lord today there's going to be life there's going to be encouragement there's going to be testimonies amen i'm going to walk away better because they encouraged me because they came into my house today man you look here and there's an anointing that comes across elizabeth she gets a taste of what pentecost is going to have amen now she's not full of the holy ghost the way that they were on the day of pentecost this is an anointing that drops on her right this is an anointing that drops on her and if you notice the first thing it does is when that anointing drops on her it reinforces the word of god amen the holy spirit on you will cause you to reinforce the word of god not to go off in your own thinking or your own way but it will cause you to come back to the word and reinforce it to the one that you're speaking to amen it says and she spake out with a loud voice and said blessed art thou among woman women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb now that's what the angel said and she's saying what the angel said because why she's got the holy ghost on her causing her to speak she says and whence is this to me that the mother of my lord should come to me for lo as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears the babe leaped in my womb for joy amen this is the kind of fellowship i want us to have amen if we were to take something into the new year let's let our fellowship cause love and joy to rise up within the one that's when hearing of our words amen that the right word spoken to the right person would cause life to bring to come forth in there in their bodies amen in their souls and their spirits amen but you have to understand here that she's pregnant six months and this is the first time that elizabeth has felt life in her womb it's the first time that she actually has her her belly's getting bigger but yet the baby has not moved to this point six months in that's not natural that's not normal for a baby to go that long without kicking amen and the reason he hadn't kicked was because of unbelief as we spoke about before but the brabham says this he says then he came and he announced that john was to be born and zacharias that priest righteous man yet without the appropriate faith you get what i mean many people come in the line say i've been a christian for 30 years that's good but what about your faith now god can't heal you on the merits of your salvation he heals you on the merits of your faith if you believe hallelujah notice if you believe he never said to the gentile woman anything but said if you believe all right he says that's the question can you believe god and take him at his word oh my if we do that there be a hallelujah sweep across the country healings would come from everywhere you'd see men out on the street claiming god healed him stay with it god will bring it to pass that's right because he's under obligation he swore that he would do it would he say it zachariah didn't have faith for that baby to show life that was a punishment from god we could put it that way where zachariah couldn't talk because he couldn't talk because he wouldn't express the right thing so god god shot his mouth so he couldn't speak he could no longer bring unbelief to the situation and then mary comes in with faith and it causes that baby to kick for the first time amen what zechariah was paying a price because he would not believe amen but there that voice speaks full of faith full of the promise and that baby comes to life within elizabeth and it causes her to what causes her to worship it causes her to confirm the word because now she knows that the baby's going to be okay now that life is proven inside of her and she's got a rest there and a piece there that it's all going to be all right amen amen if there's one thing our voice is meant to do brothers and sisters it is to confess the word of god and let everything else be a lie amen let our voice be speaking the word of god let our lips give praise to god let our confession be the word of god is true and everything else is a lie and then the prophet continues with his little drama here he says and i can hear elizabeth say yes i am oh i'm so happy about it but mary i'm just a little afraid see it's six months with me as mother and as far as we know the baby has no life she was a little weary yet about it you know little john was there and that's all together unnatural you see it's not right so about two or three months you're supposed to feel life and here she was all this time and no life yet and mary said the angel gabriel met me and told me that i was going to bring forth a son also and i was to call his name jesus well just the time that she spoke jesus little john began to leap and jump in his mother's womb brother the name of jesus christ the first time the name of jesus christ was ever spoke it brought life to a dead baby what audit to bring to a holy ghost church when the name of jesus is spoken hallelujah yes that name jesus christ when it was first spoken by mortal lips it brought life to a baby that was dead in his mother's womb the bible said he received the holy ghost and was born from his mother's womb full of the holy ghost hallelujah oh my what's the matter with christians wishy-washy half jellyfish what's that that's a lukewarm condition isn't it you're not one and you're not the other you'll just stay in the middle and be nothing right you'll be cold water's at least good for refreshing and hot water is good for everything he says you won't be anything what is it you're wishy-washy half jellyfish get a backbone in you and stand up for god and what's right and today's stand for what the bible says and believe it with all your heart think what it done when jesus name was spoke it brought life to that dead baby what ought it to bring to your limbs sir what ought to bring to your sickness to you men sitting here and you over there take the name of jesus with you everywhere you go breathe it everywhere in prayer be loyal be holy live for god and god will confirm his word yes sir he swore that he would do it there you are and the word come into her ears and her baby began to leap for joy they were hugging one another i want to ask you what has your conversation been recently amen what have you been talking about recently amen are you speaking life or are you speaking life into something that's supposed to be dead dead situations past sins past mistakes past problems past people or are you bringing life into something that needs life because when mary came she spoke life into something that was supposed to be living she wasn't trying to resurrect the dead she was trying to cause the that which was dead to live because it was supposed to be alive amen when the holy spirit's moving we need to speak things life into things that need to live and let things that are supposed to be dead stay dead because the more we talk about them the more alive they stay amen but if we can speak the word into the things that need life then we'll start to see life come forth amen what is it we put the word in our midst and we cling to what god has promised to us and then we hold fast what he said and let that be our only confession amen now we're coming up to the title scripture for today and this is going to be my new year scripture this is my new year scripture it's verse 45 it says and blessed is she that believed are you believing are you a believer this morning because if you are blessed are you that believe for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord amen each one of us is holding things in our hearts for the coming year amen we've got things that we prayed about for maybe days months weeks maybe even years and we do believe it and why do we believe it because we look in the word and the word has told us what to believe amen so if you have believed you're blessed this morning but there has to come a time where that blessing becomes a reality amen you're not blessed just because you believe you're blessed because as you believe so it will happen amen and if you've taken the word of god if you've taken the promises of god and you believed that then now it's time for him to perform them amen after you believe he performs amen mary is blessed because as she has believed so will be performed in her the thing that she believed would happen amen amen like i said before mary can't do anything she can't sing herself into this she can't worship herself into it she cannot do anything to bring forth the christ in her but she can do one thing and that is belief amen and she can speak and she can confess and she can believe and confess and speak and that is all she has to do and then it's going to happen inside of her whether she feels it or not whether she recognizes it or not and i can tell you in your own life you know this as you've gone before god and you've said lord change me lord add to me lord take it away from me and you have confessed his word and his promise you don't know the moment it was taken away in most cases some of us you know you get saved and you had you know the the desire for liquor or smoking or what you know if you came out of the world that way but for most of us we weren't living that way but yet there's a supernatural event that happened after we believed and god did it and we didn't determine the time all we determined was that he was going to do it and then he did it amen and that's what we look at we're not going to feel it every time you're not going to feel something lift off of you every time but what's going to happen is you're going to look back and you're going to say hey it's been six months since i did that where did that go right it's been six months since i've felt this it's been six months since i saw that it's been six months since i reacted this way wow he's done a change in my life hasn't he why because i believed i took him at his word i committed it to him and i kept walking forward as he's called me to amen why blessed is she that believe for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord didn't say there'll be things that were told you from somebody else or things that you said to yourself but if it comes from god then he's going to perform it if you can only believe it amen jesus went places where he could do no great miracles because they disbelieved but where they believed he could do all things because the people believed he could perform right 9 23 says if thou can't believe all things are possible to him that believeth amen only believe right it's all we were asked to do that's what he said to the he said brother branham quoted it earlier he said to the gentile woman if thou can't believe right and here it is if thou canst believe our things are possible to him that believeth listen god didn't randomly choose mary right god didn't have a tumblr full you know like to do these lottery things and he put all the names of the virgin believing women in a tumblr and just rotated it around a couple times and then randomly draw a name and it said mary right no he chose mary because he knew that she would believe he had prepared a vessel that would believe so that he could perform what he had promised to do amen he hasn't just picked your name at random amen he didn't just pick david sharp out of the lottery tumbler what he was chosen he was picked specifically because god knew that he would believe and he would hold and he would overcome and he would have the victory in this final age and he went through every person that's sitting in this church this morning and every member of the bride of christ and he called your name out of what the lamb's book of life it was written there before the foundation of the world and he says they're going to believe and they're going to overcome and they're going to have the victory amen it's not random it's not random there's not a chance that you will fail if he has called your name it's because you will be victorious it's because you will believe maybe though you don't now yet you will believe and you will go in that rapture you'll step off this earth without seeing death amen god chose someone that would take him at his word but brahm says now notice when god makes a promise to you he will fulfill it you don't have to be afraid that he will not keep his word for god will keep his word that's true you just must trust him amen amen like mary we can't make it happen we can't make it happen i can't make signs and wonders happen i can't make miracles happen i can't change myself i can't give myself character i can't make myself a more effective preacher i can't make myself a more effective lay person i can't do anything except surrender to him and say lord your word calls for it therefore i will receive it and i will believe it and i will lay my life down and let you do it amen amen there's got to be a supernatural event that's going to happen for that life to come forth in this age amen brother branham was talking about isaac and abraham going to mount moriah by god's command he says he says abraham got close to the mountain and he said to the servants you stay here think of how his heart must have been beating knowing that he was going up there to kill his son and destroy the only hope he had of ever being the father of nations but he said he have received him as one from the dead and he was persuaded that god could raise him up from the dead see that abraham faith see what it means no matter how ridiculous it sounds if god said it he means it amen if god said it he means it god doesn't waste his time with idol words right god doesn't have things in there that he threw in to trip us up if god said it it's because he means it he is the way he keeps his word it's up to him to see it through not you to try to see it through it's up to him to see it through he says now listen close i just love this he said to those servants you wait here the lad and i will go yonder to worship and the lad and i shall return how's he going to do it when he's got the knife and it's sharpened he's got the fire in his hand he's got the wood on his back and he took it all off his own back and placed it on isaac a beautiful type of christ packing that wooden cross up the hill he said you wait here the lad and i will go yonder to worship and we shall return amen he says how oh my how are you going to get out of those wheelchairs it's none of your business to think about it he's talking to people listen brother branham services they would stack up wheelchairs after the service in some places they literally took truckloads of wheelchairs away because those people didn't need them anymore he says how are you going to get out of that wheelchair sir how are you going to get well it's none of your business to think about it how are you going to get well it's god's promise the only thing to do is keep moving on in another message he said he's jehovah jireh how will he do it i don't know that's his business but he said he would do it and i believe him jehovah jireh the lord will provide for himself a sacrifice no matter what it is the lamb was there he provided a lamb when it needed a lamb catch that when you needed a lamb he provided a lamb he didn't provide a a bowl he didn't provide a goat you needed a lamb he gave you a lamb when you have a need he'll give you what you have need of he he says you don't ask for for a piece of bread or fish and he gives you a stone right what you have a need he gives you what you have need of right trust him because that's the way god works you have a need he's jehovah jireh he gives you what you have need of he says he provided a lamb when he needed a lamb when you're sick and you need healing he'll provide for you if you need salvation he provides for you if you need a revival he will provide for you if the meal barrel's empty he will provide for you amen if you're all down-hearted and drooped over god will provide for you what he's saying he's not just god of one thing he doesn't just have one answer but he meets you where your need is and he gives you what you have need of every single time if you're all down-hearted and drooped over god will provide for you for he was wounded for our transgressions bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed amen the lord's provided sacrifice the lord's provided lamb we sang about it at the start of service i have a source of strength i have a source of healing i have a source of deliverance i have a a source of change what it's it's all there amen it's it's a wonderful thing that he has a a fountain open in the house of david for those who would believe amen you look at mary's response to this and it's such a beautiful thing and i believe this is a an instruction for us that when the supernatural is required in our life when god is moving when the word has been spoken and we take it we do what mary did and that's that mary did start to worship and she said mary said my soul does magnify the lord amen are we worried or are we magnifying and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my savior for he hath regarded the lowest state of his handmaiden i'm a nobody she says i'm just a girl it's like selena's saying at the the service right be born of me i'm just a little girl that's how mary was he's regarded the lowest state of his handmaiden for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed now this is a totally different mary isn't it mary doesn't just think this is going to happen mary knows this is going to happen and she is giving him worship and praise for what he has said will happen in her life she went from a lowly handmaiden to everyone will call mary bless to the point where they worship her today that's how blessed she is that's that's the high esteem that mary has is that people will pray to her because they think she's something special right but look at what she says you took me from low and you put me to high james 4 10 says humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up amen amen humble yourselves in the sight of the lord that's our part that's my part and then it says and he shall lift you up that's his party man if we lift ourselves up god pushes us down if we push ourselves down then god pushes us up amen luke 14 11 confirms it says for whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted mary thought herself a nobody she lived as a nobody and look where it got her it got her to being the vessel for the very messiah that she had been waiting for all of her life amen mary's opinion of herself was that she was a nobody that's what god's looking for we spoke about it earlier god's looking for nobodies today people that will say there's nothing here that's worth talking about but if you'll step in if you'll do something if you'll let your word be born in me then maybe we'll have something to talk about but she's not glorifying herself now she's glorifying the god that did it amen verse 49 says for he that is mighty had done to me great things and holy is his name can you imagine if i'm up here saying i'm great right what would you think if i was up here saying i'm a great man i'm a great preacher well you'd laugh probably but the point is i'm not up here to speak about me am i look at mary she doesn't say i am mighty she says he is mighty that had done to me great things because she needed a great thing done to her to get her to where she needed to be and she had nothing to do with it so she's giving all the glory and all of the praise to him because he's the mighty one that did it amen he's the mighty angel he's the holy spirit he's the life that dropped into her and made her into something out of nothing the glory is given to him she's not lifting herself up she's lifting up the mighty one that did it amen that ought to be the way we speak amen for he that is mighty had done great things to me and holy is his name and his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation he has shown strength with his arm he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts he hath put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree amen he has filled the hungry with good things and the rich he has sent empty away what a contrast amen he had filled the hungry with good things i want to ask are you hungry this morning do you have a need this morning that he can fill because if you're not hungry you're not going to get anything are you amen blessed are those that hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled if i'm sitting up here if i'm standing up here and i think i've got it all and i think i'm i'm in a in a rapture-ready form and i think i'm mr spirituality and stuff guess what god can't work with me kenny because i'm not hungry i'm not thirsty and i'm already i'm in a laodicean condition is what i'm in right if i'm sitting up here and saying i'm rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing i'm well clothed blah blah blah what is it i'm in a laodicean condition but he says what she says what he had filled the hungry with good things you've got to be hungry for the things of god you've got to recognize there's more to be had and there's a need for you to have more of him and then he can come in amen and with the rich and the rich he has sent empty away he had helped his servant israel in remembrance of his mercy as he spoke to our fathers to abraham and to his seat forever we're a part of that royal seat aren't we mary's not just speaking to israel now she's speaking to all of us write his seed forever she's saying you're a part of this as well amen it's all about god's work that's what this is all about when we look at this entire the the supernatural birth of jesus it was god gave his word of what was going to happen and he had one person that was ready to take his word at it exactly as he spoke it confess it and move forward and all of a sudden we have the supernatural messiah being born amen like i said we don't deserve it we can't make it happen but what we can do is we can what we can water it right we can we can set an atmosphere for growth can we that's what church is all about is an atmosphere for growth so that when the unsaved come in they realize there's more and that when life comes in then it grows a little bit taller in that service amen when we gather for fellowship when we gather together what is it it's to encourage one another to draw us up into that like precious faith amen to let life come forth just a little bit more to get that fruit to blossom out amen that's what we're looking to happen in our lives but there's one thing we can do is when he says it you believe it and that gives him the opportunity to put on the performance of what he said he would do amen but abraham says now i believe he will do it he has never failed me yet in all these years i believe him but you can understand what a challenge that is brother branham would stand up there remember he's over in india and they bring over the sun worshiper that had his head his eyeballs fried because he stared at the sun and he said he said can any one of you stand here and heal this man and nobody could and he gave them time to do it he says i have a god that can and he prayed for that man and he saw and he says he says but you can understand what a challenge that is because every time he stepped behind that pulpit he was looking for the supernatural and the expectation was that the supernatural will follow it's mark 16 all over again right he says can you imagine what a challenge it is because what the worst would come up to him and he had to believe that if god spoke it it would happen right and he had to repeat what god said he was when he was in that when he was in that channel brother branham didn't even know what he was saying half the time right he'd say was it true what he said he didn't even know it but he was a he was a microphone he was just repeating what that angel said to him time and time again can you understand what a challenge it is somebody said aren't you afraid aren't you afraid that they're going to bring up something that god can't heal that god can't fix that god can't change that god can't redeem no sir how can i be afraid and him right here by me amen you've got to believe he's with you brothers and sisters you've got to believe when he gave you the holy ghost that means he's with you he's in you every second of every day and he's there to fulfill his word in your life he says he it's his word it's not my word he says it's him it's his word it's not mine i'm just saying what he said and that's my confession confess means say the same thing the scripture which is god god in letter form the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and the word still is god the word still is god prophet's gone prophet's gone the word has remained the holy spirit has remained and he's what he's dwelling in you and in me that's right right the only thing that's changed is the messenger is gone but the one that was behind the messenger the other angel remember our pastor keeps saying they missed the angel behind him that's the one that's still here amen that's the one that's still here to take his bride off of this earth he says the scripture which is god god in letter form the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and the word still is god and the word said he's the same yesterday today and forever it's up to him to confirm it it's worth me to believe it now you believe it i shared this quote in a previous sermon but i thought it was a good way to finish he says where god is supernatural takes place for he is supernatural amen let's all stand together if we would i went a little short this morning i wasn't sure if my voice was going to hold up i remember just wanted to give a bit of a word of encouragement this morning as i felt led to do it then we're we're in a new year and the world is sitting there and they're making their new year's resolutions and they're vowing to be different and they're vowing to be better and vowing to change and guess what most of them don't make it three weeks that's that's what they say most of them don't get past three weeks with whatever they've promised to change amen i'd like to challenge you this morning not to make a commitment to change make a commitment to believe amen to let your confession be the promises of god as he has spoken them in his word don't make stuff up don't go looking around for something but go to his word mary had a supernatural experience and when you have that experience when the word is quickened to you when the message is quickened to you when something says that's for you whatever it is let this be the year that you believe it and you confess it and you say lord i believe it i'm looking for your performance now amen because there's got to be a time he doesn't give a prophecy he doesn't give a promise but that if you'll believe it he's going to perform it amen and my request is that we would have a year where we believe where we take that word and we put it on our lips don't just keep it in our minds and then put it on our lips let our confession let our testimony be lord i believe now i'm trusting you to perform what you've promised amen amen let's just bow our heads together heavenly father lord well your prophet said that you are supernatural and therefore where you are the supernatural follows and lord the very fact that we can stand here this morning and believe your word lord that we can confess it shows that there's a supernatural life within us lord that's calling for something beyond us amen but lord we want to lift our lives up to you this morning lord we want to lift up our weakness and our frailty lord our shortcomings lord and we want to put them away lord we want to put them inside and say lord i believe lord i believe your word i believe in spite of those weaknesses in spite of those shortcomings lord we believe regardless of what the word says regardless of what symptoms say regardless of how things appear lord we believe and we're trusting you to perform what we have believed because you said it and now we're repeating it back to you heavenly father lord we pray you would encourage your people lord for the coming year lord things seem to drag on so long with this pandemic lord it gets us down so often lord it hinders fellowship lord it hinders so many things lord but we're trusting for a supernatural breakthrough in our lives lord that our faith would be lifted up that as we would be perhaps stuck more at home lord that we'd use that time to draw closer to you lord that we'd set aside the things of this world a little more lord that we'd let you come in just that little bit greater each and every day so that your work could be born in our lives a little bit more lord lord we know time is short we hold up to our lost love loved ones lord those ones that haven't given their lives to you lord for those unsaved souls or we lift them before your throne of grace this morning lord we ask your holy spirit to go out and bring them into our into our midst or we pray that they would come to you lord not to a church not to a ministry lord that you would drop in where they are lord that your word would start to take hold and that would bring them into fellowship lord we pray lord many missing this morning lord sick and traveling these different things lord we pray your grace to them lord for the collins family lord homesick brother chad as he travels again lord pray for the tumbaya family lord praying that you would keep them safe
