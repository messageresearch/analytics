thank you musicians certainly appreciate sister Priscilla stepping up this morning it was interesting because I had put in my notes to close what this is my desire and she started with it and then underneath that I said sing thank you songs and brother Bob sang Too to kind of close it out you know so whether we've got the first string players or the second string or the third string or the eighth string and then God always moves and he grants us what we have need of Amen so certainly appreciate that just a few Updates this morning you can sit down if you want for just a few moments most of you don't know Brother David Nash but he's a missionary that has been traditionally based out of Washington state in the U.S but he's since moved down to Texas but I've known him for quite some years now and I'd reached out to him and said we want to support a missions group if we can or a missionary and he said well I don't have any needs right now and he hasn't had any needs for the last three years by God's grace but then he reached out and said I have a need I need to go to Honduras and Panama to preach and I don't have the money to do it so we paid for his tickets to go down so he sent us some pictures to myself from brother Mark and so on the left side is their youth group meeting this is a youth camp right here this is this is them preaching that's not him that's that's uh one of the translators I believe but this is their little youth group that they have there that they're preaching in uh I believe it's in Panama right now then on the right hand side is the building where they're having the special meeting so it's just a a covered open basketball uh a covered basketball court and they've got some plastic lawn chairs out there and they said they had 17 people there that have never heard the message of the hour so this is what it looks like there and then they go back into the mountains and these are the people that they're preaching to so just very humble dwellings humble sisters that are there um you know certainly not dressed or have the things that we do but they're hungry for the things of God and this is what he's doing as a missionaries he's going into places where they don't have a whole lot and he's sitting there and they're preaching them the word of God and signs and wonders following and it's just a wonderful thing so he wanted us to share these and as he continues on to the next stage of his journey no doubt he'll send us some pictures there but I wanted you to know this is your ties and offerings don't just support the local Ministry but we want to support things outside and I know brother Gerald has some some work that he does outside as well with other ministers but I wanted to kind of show you what we've done recently with Brother David Nash I also spoke with Brother John Andy's last week and this week and we're going to be having special meetings here on the weekend of November 18th through 20th he'll have three services as we traditionally do and so we're looking forward to that I spoke to Brother Steve Carr had a number of people reach out and check how the church was doing and how we're doing through the storm I think everyone thought it was hitting us but by God's grace it hasn't it was actually quite a nice day yesterday but brother Steve Clark sends his greetings as well I just got an email response from Brother Alec or brother Alec cater and just checking in with him and he said he was fine no damage to the place where he's standing they lost power for a little bit but otherwise he's okay I checked in with Brother John and sister Beatrix Pike in Cape Breton and that went right over ahead of them and he said we lost power but other than that the house is fine we're fine they have a generator for for things need be I checked in with brother Joshua Marshall yesterday or he checked in with me I should say and he said everything's fine there except a couple trees down so we thank God for that certainly it it hit hard and it hit harder than they thought it was going to hit I saw some pictures this morning and last night of Porter Bass Cape Breton pei and they truly got a lot of Destruction there so we certainly pray God's grace to them amen let's stand together if you would as we we go to the reading the word this morning we're going to open up in second Corinthians chapter 4. we read the scripture a couple Services ago and I said I was going to come back around and kind of tie things up in a hopefully in a pretty bow and this is the start of of that bow Lord willing so second Corinthians 4 verse 10 says always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be manifest in our body this is the the end goal for the believer this is the purpose of the believer that the life of Jesus will be manifested in this body amen for we which live are always delivered unto death for Jesus sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh there's a dying out that happens daily so then death worketh in us but life in you we having the same Spirit of Faith according as it is written I believed and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak amen God bless his word you may have your seats this morning amen I want to continue a course in the series on in his form with his mind and I want to take a title this morning of the voice of abundance amen the voice of abundance and that like I said we're kind of coming to and and maybe the theme of this this last portion of this series will be on the speaking bride the speaking bride and maybe just keep that in your heads as we're going forth over the next couple of of services that as we dig into this that we're thinking about a speaking bride because if you have a body and you have a mind then there's going to be a voice that comes out of it amen we don't just have the body of Christ we are not the form of Christ and we don't just have the mind of Christ Christ to sit there and do nothing but there is a voice that follows that when we have the mind of Christ and he's working in our life amen and this is a this is a huge topic this is this I could spend months on this and maybe not get into it and and why is that it's because this started with the word everything started with the word if you go to John 1 it says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh it started with the word and then as we've seen brother Gerald draw so many times sin happened and we dropped out of Eternity we dropped out of the word into these these sin-filled bodies and we have that little bump on the on the on the circle of Eternity and in there the word is not full the word is not full we're out of the word amen and what we have is we have a message that comes to draw us back to that fullness of the word it's Alpha and Omega it's the start and the finish so we started in the word and we're going to finish in the word and to get there we've got to have the word fully manifested into US amen we've got to be fully surrendered to that and the words got to be expressed through a bride again before we get out of this Earth amen so the word isn't static the word is informal but it's alive and it's well and it's supposed to be in a body of Believers amen it's Dynamic it has power it has changing power it has healing power it has restoring power it has all of these things within it and what we're looking for is to manifest it through our lives amen but just to lay a foundation in this entire you know last portion of a speaking bride I want us to remember that a word is a thought expressed and brother Branham said this so many times amen that a word is a thought expressed I mean it can't just stay a thought but it has to come out it has to be spoken and it has to be expressed through us in amen and it's not a word only in your mind it's not only a word in your emotions but it has to be something that flows through your lips and it only becomes a thought Express when it comes out of your mind when it comes from the inspiration and it comes out in the muscles of your face conform to what your mind says it should do and it speaks the word of God Amen it's when your body verbalizes or your body acts on what is inside of your mind amen that's right and before you express a word you have to have a thought you can't say a word without a thought behind it there has to be something to inspire it to prompt it to drive it to cause your mouth to speak those words that it's going to do and it's funny today because we often think that people are speaking without thinking if you look at the nonsense that's going on in the world today people are speaking without thinking we would think but it's not true they're actually thinking before they speak and they actually sincerely believe that the nonsense that's coming out of their mouth these days is absolutely the truth it's right it's the way to live it's the way to move forward it's the way to progress our society they're sincere in their belief and while they're wrong they are sincere and that is what's causing them to speak and act the way they do amen but before we get into this I want to set kind of a tone here and I've read this quote before and I want to use it to kind of set us for the next three services probably and it says notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never never did anything until it was first showed him by the father he says John 5 19 the reference scripture he says this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it therefore that word therefore means because because she receives it because she never doubts it nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again then he says here is the secret of this so listen closely he says the word is in the bride as it was in Mary now what was it before it was in Mary it was a thought in the mind of God spoken by the angel Gabriel and he says the Holy Spirit Will overshadow thee and you're going to Bear the son of God Emmanuel is going to come out of you Mary so as it was with Mary it was a thought it was expressed by the angel to her and then she received it and because she received it it happened right the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord now we covered this in earlier Services about how we die out we empty ourselves and then we're filled with something capital S something that is greater than us which is the holy spirit but that's not the end of the journey that's only the start of the real journey because he's wanting us to do something when he fills us with the Holy Spirit and it's to get ourselves Under full subjection so that we can be used amen we are here to express what the mind and thought and perfect will of God so we're looking to put our hands our feet our voice our energy into doing what he wants us to do for the kingdom of God and leave all else aside amen what did Peter say did we have we not left all Lord right can we say have we not left all I mean that's where we want to be is Lord have we not left all and are we not walking according to your purpose and plan but he says she has thus saith the Lord now that's taking it up a step isn't it can you say that everything I say everything I do how I spend my time how I spend my money how I spend my energy where I go whether I stay when I'm quiet when I talk can I say all of that is according to thus saith the Lord amen am I close enough to God am I sensitive enough to the holy spirit that when I do something I can say God has showed me to do this that I am in full compliance with the word of God if nothing else that I can have confidence that he's going to back me up in this situation that's where brother Branham is pointing us to this is perfect Unity here where you have thus saith the Lord it's not like you're a prophet in that sense but yet you have a more sure word of Prophecy we have a message that's been given to us we have a guidance we have an unction from the Holy Spirit we'll get into that leads us and guides us day by day and the only limitation is how much we'll yield we are the limitation it's not God that's holding back it's not God that's holding back if you are more of him it's because there's more of him to be had amen amen we'll get into this we'll receive but the prophet is talking about that the bride knows what he wants done with the word see you can't just read the word and walk off with it and say I'm going to do such and such I'm going to go such so and so I'm going to say this and do this no you have to have leadership on how to use the word of God amen guess what when Jesus went to the pool of Siloam he did not heal everyone there was power to do it all but he did not have authority to heal every single one of them right the leper only one came back and held on to his healing right there was only one woman with the issue of blood there was only one Centurion servant he did not heal everyone he did not deliver everyone he healed and delivered a lot but he did not heal and deliver all why because he was under the leadership of the holy spirit amen that was dwelling in him and so he knew what to do with the word amen amen I've heard brother Joe mention it I don't know that I've ever seen it in the in the message so it may have been hearsay but remember it was a story where brother Branham had those two men that were going around and they were so full of zeal but in their Zeal they were unwise in how they witnessed to people and they were causing offense where no offense needed to be caused and he said you need to be tied up to the snubbing post now we're not westerners we don't know what a snubbing post but a snubbing post is where you tie a horse so that it can't get away and it holds them tight it doesn't allow them to have freedom of movement he says you need to be tied down because you're using the word unwisely you're using your revelation of the word unwisely you have it but you don't know what to do with it brother bam says the bride performs the command of the word in his name because she has nothing she knows what he wants done so you have to be in the time and season there is a time and a season for everything right that means you can be out of the time and you can be out of the Season you have to be in line with the word not by your own interpretation amen you have to be under the inspiration for your day remember that they came to Jesus and they said how do we do the works of the Kingdom he says receive him who has been sent you've got to receive something first so if you're not under the inspiration of him who has been sent then guess what you're going to be off the word that's why we had a message was so that we know where we needed to go and what we needed to do amen and then on top of that you have to have the right motive and the right objective because you can try to do the right thing but if you do it for your own reasons and not his reasons then you're going to get out of step every time amen the perfect example is Moses right the greatest Prophet that ever lived aside from Christ You could argue but he was under the knowledge of his calling but he wasn't under the experience of his calling as a deliverer and so he goes out and he rescues two two Israelites from an Egyptian he kills the Egyptian and then the next day or two he goes and he sees them fighting and they he comes up and he tries to break apart and they said are you going to kill us too it was not the time for deliverance he was ahead of his time he was 42 years too early so even though he knew what had to be done he got ahead of God's program and all it caused was heartache and a dead Egyptian right that's right it's the same thing for us we're reading the word we're reading the message we're under the inspiration of an end time message but you've got to catch the time and season you've got to be tied to God Amen you've got to know what he wants done with it otherwise you're going to get disappointed every single time I remember I remember a brother saying I don't remember who it was but he was he was listening to a message where brother batam was talking about you know speak the word and have faith and he turned around and he said curtains move guess what the curtains didn't move because he was just trying to prove something there was no intent there was no glory to God coming out of it there was there was nothing for the kingdom of God but he was wanting to try and prove something to himself and God said okay and God just moved on right you've got to be in the anointing prophet of God puts it this way he says no matter how much you're called for the job God has to do the leading come on see he failed of all of his schooling he's talking about Moses and his military mind and his training as a great Egyptian leader scripture says that Moses was well trained he excelled in all of these things he had everything you would expect a leader to have he says but yet it failed because God had a program and we've got to work according to God's program no matter what we do we do how smart we are we've got to Humble ourselves and work according to God's program he says amen what is it there is a maturity that is required of a bride and then she has to know him before she knows what he wants done with what he has amen now for those of you that have been married a very long time we could talk to brother Gus and sister Elise or maybe sister Brendan brother Bob brother Mark sister Brenda brother jail sister Betty and I guarantee you that those women know what their husband wants done with their resources so they know how he wants her to spend her time the money how to use the vehicle where to go what to do how to prepare everything right there's probably not a lot of surprises left in those marriages why because there is a maturity in the relationship first and foremost and then after that then brother Bob doesn't have to worry about sister Brenda going out and spending 30 grand without talking to him if she does spend it she knows it's for something that he would want her to do it with that's the same thing with the bride is that you get the Holy Ghost and you say I'm ready to go I'm ready to go no no there has to come now a maturity within you and your relationship before you can ever step into what we're talking about here today amen now I'm going to go back to that quote that we're reading in the seven Church ages because I want you to see what happens when the bride correctly and in the right time and season says and does what God wants her to do it says she performs the command of the word in his name he says then then and only then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass so then the word is quick and you know what that means if it wasn't done correctly it will never be quickened it will never happen right it has to be done in the right time and season in the way God wants it and then the Holy Spirit quickens it it makes the word that's spoken live right you can claim it and preach it and say it until you're blue in the face but if it's not in God's season and Will it's not going to happen amen why because God didn't Inspire it it's inspiration sitting in the word but you've got to catch the time and season for it he says like a seed that is planted and watered it comes the whole full Harvest serving its purpose those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the Lord or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own words I want to stop right there because that is the only way it's ever going to happen is if it's him this this can have no part of it amen and I know that for myself from the ministry side that nothing can happen if I get my fingers mixed up in it if I start dabbling in things it messes up God's program it can't work that way but he'll do things that I am completely unaware of if I will just let him lead amen if I will just let him lead pull myself back and say Lord use this brother Brown said the gift is getting yourself out of the way and I have notes and I have notes and I have notes here but I can't tell you how many times I get off the notes and I don't know why and I don't know where and I just have to go trusting and it is the most difficult thing for a controlling engineer to do right but it's the same thing in our lives because you've got to recognize that he is leading and let go and let him lead even when it gets uncomfortable even when it goes off the plan that you had in your head yeah right they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his Earthly Ministry so now he works in and through the bride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do but he will now now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time so there are things that he could not do then that he's going to do now and he's and it's not just through a prophet he did many things through a prophet but now he's stepping into that multi-member bride amen we know it's the end time we know it's the end of the Gentile dispensation we know it's Rapture season we know it's separating time we know it's manifesting time but we cannot make it happen by our will remember what is it what does he say I believe it's in Zechariah says not by might nor by power that's right but by my spirit saith the Lord if there's one thing you can catch today in in this entire service is that you cannot make it happen he's got a time he's got a season he's got a place he's got a person he's got a man he's got a woman that he has anointed to do certain things and all you're doing is staying in the presence of God to be ready willing and able amen amen be patient be sensitive be ready to go but wait for him to start you on that Journey amen amen have patience we need patience because there's a lot of tarrying at the end if you notice in the scriptures there's a lot of tearing and then boom it just goes all of a sudden and then everything happens very very quickly and those that didn't stick around during the tearing they don't get to go in at the end you've got to hold all the way to the end we've read this scripture and we're talking about the the life of Jesus living through us and it said we having the same Spirit of faith according as it is written I believed and therefore have I spoken we also believe and therefore speak having the same Spirit of What doctrine teaching great preaching social license political will fear distrust no The Same Spirit of Faith amen it's the spirit of faith that cause us to believe First and speak second now remember what faith is Faith is a revelation of the will of God the prophet said so you get a revelation of the will of God and that is what causes you to speak and so often what we get is a revelation of our need and then we speak but you have to get a revelation of his will and then speak because again God is doing something we're not like the unbeliever where God can kind of sovereignly jump in and jump out and it's a one-time deal because he's taking us somewhere and he's developing us and he's maturing us and he's creating and developing character in us and he's drawing us to something and he's pushing other things out so he works differently with a Believer than an unbeliever and you'll see it time and a time in scriptures where somebody can come in touch Jesus and go out and we never hear or see them again and that was fine for them but with his children he works a little differently because there's a requirement of him to take us to the Statue of a perfect man or woman in Christ so he's going to use those things to bring us there which means we don't get to jump out of the fire all the time that he'll turn up the heat and he'll turn up the heat and he'll hold us in a place for a while to do what get some of the draw so get some of the world out get us away from bad relationships get us away from bad influences get us to realize we're we're stuck on something or addicted to something or we're we're under the control of something right and then when that's dealt with then he'll move the rest of it off of us he's got a plan he's got a purpose in these things amen our fruits are known by our words and they often reveal or in many cases betray what's really inside of us in certain areas of Our Lives Luke 6 43 says for a good tree bringeth forth not fruit bringeth forth not corrupt fruit neither do the corrupt tree bring forth good fruit so if you're getting mixed signals there's a problem isn't there if one day you're good and next day you're bad then there's a problem isn't there because he says you can't bring forth both out of the same tree he says for every tree is known by his own fruit four of thorns men's do not gather figs nor of a Bramble Bush gather their grapes a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and an evil man out of the evil Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh listen it's easy to say the right things in church isn't it it's easy to say the right things when you're around other believers and you're in the right atmosphere and you're under the right influence and everybody believes in and feels the way you do right but guess what religious people do that all day long every day they're in church every time they're in church every time they're around the good people that believe the way they believe everything is great but then you pull them out of it and all of a sudden guess what the words that are coming out of their mouth are not the same thing remember we're supposed to have thus saith the Lord in every aspect the way we talk the way we do things ought not to change based on who we're around now certainly we will temper things at times won't we guess what we're probably not going to talk about the Holy Ghost and the blessings of the service with our with our co-workers necessarily you know you'll lead them into those sorts of things but we ought not to to be ashamed of what we believe of what we do of how we spend our time amen they're certainly not ashamed he says if we're ashamed of him he's going to be ashamed of us I mean there ought to be no difference amen but if we say one thing and do another as the scripture is saying here then what is the problem the problem is what's inside your heart the problem is what's inside of you is not matching the words that come out and eventually your words will catch up with what's inside because that's going to come out and usually what it takes is pressure it takes disappointment it takes hurt it takes temper whatever it is it takes a time where you're not in complete control and all of a sudden those things slip out you're like whoa where did that come from amen amen and so you're saying now something's got to change in there right if you're saying you're delivered of something and then you keep going back to it then what's right your words or your life right you can't be delivered if you keep going back to it you can't say you got the victory if you keep slipping right remember I spoke a while ago where I said off times we're covering with repentance the things that actually require Deliverance when we're using the blood of Christ to cover something rather than the power of the Holy Spirit to kick it out of our life amen right to recognize what's going on that something's got a hold of us are we delivered or not because if our actions don't agree with our confession then there's a problem in there and we've got to resolve those two and bring it to a point amen funny thing is that's what the world is doing today we've got men that say I'm a woman I'm a woman and guess what that man can live like a woman all the days of his life but guess what the fruit of his life will still be that of a man he can never bring forth life the way a woman can no matter how many surgeries they do no matter how many hormones he takes his fruit will always be that of a man and yet the world will say you're a woman but guess what his life proves that he is not a woman no matter how much he shaves and how much he he primps and wears you know what I'm talking about he will never be a woman because inside he's not a woman he can't change what he is but guess what your words don't change you either but you know what the challenge for us is it's to say what the word says about us and then surrender so that the Holy Spirit can do that change Christians are the only people in the world that can change what they are in their natural ins in their natural way of things because why we're new creatures we're New Creations and then we're a new man we're a new woman in Christ we're the only ones that can actually be something different than we started out with why because we were something different in the very beginning in the very beginning that's really what we're going back to is our real self and that new birth just reveals what we were all along amen the idea is to what say what the word says and surrender to allow it to work in our lives brother Brown said but by their fruits you shall know them see your actions speak louder than what your confession proves see when you disbelieve God's word and count it as something gone by or take some book and it's dead and saying this is just as good as that it goes to show that you're not a Believer that's right you're not and if he was then you would believe God's word he would Express himself through his word now he was God's word expressed and he says now if you can't believe me he said believe the works that I do search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and that's the very thing that tells who I am tells who they are too see that's the one who says who I am and the scriptures tells who I am now listen to this he says because what that's great for Jesus he says then let me take that a little further will you the scriptures is what tells what you are he says that expresses you and that expresses me I love that it's not just a prophet the word does not just Express itself through a prophet but it expresses from all the way from Brother Gus on the front to brother Ellie on the or on the back to the front every one of us the word tells us who we are and it expresses us amen what a word is a thought expressed the written word is expressed through you you are a word ex you are a thought expressed through the word amen the scriptures tell what we are it's so loud that our voice cannot be even heard now remember you know we read in the scripture say it says that he's a high priest of our confession guess what even your lack of a confession will not stop the purpose of God that's what he's saying here is that there is a word that is above all and no matter what you think or say if you're a child of his he's going to get you across the Finish Line praise the Lord for that but it's a lot easier if you'll confess with your mouth right if you'll say I'll believe what it says rather than I'm a no good do nothing right let's say what the word says about us but in the end the word has a louder voice than anything we could ever say and it's not going to return to God void without achieving what he had sent it out for amen he says our life speaks louder than our voice see and it is God's way of letting us see what we are your life is what speaks and lets us know what we are Jesus says the same thing they are they that testify me they prove what I am and which one of you can condemn me of unbelief sin listen I'm talking about looking at yourself he says if I have improperly identified myself as being what the word said that I would be what's he saying stop and take a look at your life brothers and sisters stop and take a look and see how we've changed because guess what the changing of God is rarely like that usually your new birth experience is that and occasionally there's a Deliverance where you you have a sudden thing but otherwise it's what it's line upon line word upon word it's step upon step it's Bit by Bit by Bit that we progress and so what happens is we get to the end of the year and we say not much has happened in my life but if you stop and really think about what you were doing this time last year and what you're doing this year how you're spending your time how you're reacting how you're acting the words you're saying where you're going how you're spending your time how you're spending your money how your relationships have grown or maybe they haven't I don't know but the point is to look and see and actually ask yourself have I changed that's where you're going to see something because you should be changing Amen brother Brown says if you're not going forward you're going backward you're never standing still as a Christian so the idea is we should be able to look and see I have grown guess what we don't always do it we don't always do it we have down months we have down days we have down years sometimes it seems like but you know what I find so happens so often is we get to the end of it and we say I'm so tired and I'm so worn out and we think that means we haven't progressed we think it means we've lost the victory we think it means we lost the joy do you know why you're so tired and worn out because you've been in a battle because you've been pressing because you've been moving because you've been going forward and it's not easy if you're fresh as a daisy I would question whether you've actually grown quite frankly because we're in a battle we're on a journey and it's never ever ever easy except in very small moments of time where God gives us a respite so you're tired because you're growing listen when I finish a gym workout if I'm feeling fresh as a daisy I didn't work out and as a Believer if you're always feeling fresh as a daisy it means you haven't been struggling or striving that God hasn't put you through the ringer that's a problem so you're tired and worn out so often because you're in a battle now there is a remedy for that amen but your tiredness hey look at Jesus Jesus was tired all the time have you ever noticed that he was weary he was so tired that he fell asleep in Hurricane Fiona on the Sea of Galilee that's how tired he was had he lost the victory he stood up and said peace be still yes he hadn't lost the victory but that doesn't mean our body and our mind doesn't get tired right so take heart if you're tired that's good that's good it means God's working in your life it means that you have opposition if you don't have opposition then you're with the opposition amen brother bam says this and the message identification he says I wonder if we Christians could think that tonight wonder if we can look in God's looking glass of what requirements is of a Christian and identify ourselves that way I wonder if we could I wonder if we can identify ourselves tonight with John 3 16. and all the other kinds of scriptures Mark 16 and all those other places in Galatians I believe in different second Thessalonians the fruits of the spirit and so forth I wonder if we can identify ourselves Jesus said which one of you can accuse me that I haven't performed and done just exactly what the scripture said I would do nobody could say a word because he had truly identified himself look in the word so often we have a Christianity of relativism I look and I compare myself to brother Ellie and I say I'm either better or worse and if I'm worse than I try and do better and if I'm better than I say I'm good to go that's not it right we're all at different levels on the ladder but we've got to keep moving and so often what we're saying is that well I'm doing better than they are so I'm I'm pretty good no no no that has nothing to do with it lesson some bring forth 30-fold 60-fold and 100 fold the goal is to get to a hundred right the goals get to 100 so if you're 60 comparing yourself to somebody that's a 30-fold Christian that's not what it's about it's will you keep maturing and growing to go all the way amen we're talking about the voice of abundance today but before our voice speaks the thought must first exist amen we must believe and be convinced before we'll speak something that's right we have to amen we read the scripture that says out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh what does that mean what does abundance mean abundance means whatever is most plentiful whatever has the the advantage whatever is greatest inside of you is what's going to speak out of you amen is what's going to project out of you is what's going to live out of you in the end amen whatever is winning the battle inside of you that's how you know what you have an abundance of whatever is winning the battle inside of you that's what you're going to speak out of and that's what you're going to live out of Amen so whatever you're most convinced is important and valuable to you is what you're going to have inside of you right right because it's a treasure remember the scripture says a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart and the evil man are the evil treasure listen an evil person Treasures evil and a good man Treasures good so if you're speaking out of evil what does that mean is inside it means there's something evil imagine if you're speaking good it means there's something good inside of you amen you can call yourself a Christian but if all you talk about is sports then guess what the word is not in abundance if all you speak about is politics then guess what the word is not in abundance if all you speak about is making money then guess what the word is not in abundance if all you speak about is your career then guess what the word is not in abundance because that is the consuming fire that's inside of you is what you're what you're talking about all the time amen now you're saying well brother John we have to talk about things hey the the the political world is insane right now the the social world is insane right now the economic world is insane the environmental world is unseen the entire world is insane you say we've got to talk about these things and we do but we have to talk about them through the filter of the word of God and the inspiration of the holy spirit that has sent us a message today to tell us how to respond to those things amen we don't talk about it the way the world talks when I talk to my colleagues they're so down in the mouth and they're worried and they're tired and they're sick of everything that's going on and they have no Solutions but they can identify problems listen the Christian's way is not to identify problems ever ever it's to put it through the word and come out with what God's doing in the entire situation amen so if your conversation is filtered by the word then now you we know what's inside of you and if your conversation is not filtered by the word how do you know it because you're identifying problems all you're doing is looking at the symptoms all you're looking at is circumstances rather than where those are going to take you amen so what happens is is what's in abundance overpowers everything else and that's what you're speaking about now amen you look at the abundance of the things that are dark and wrong in this country and if you're not in the word then you're going to say we're going to hell in a handbasket but if you're filtering it through the word you're going to say the Rapture is getting close even so come Lord Jesus can we please get out of here right we're not trying to fix it we're trying to leave it we're understanding the effect is to get us to look up because his redemption's drawing not that the change of our bodies is here and we're shaping up so we can ship out that's what I would look for in a Believer is that we say even so come Lord Jesus not we need to fix this it is unfixable it's been unfixable since 1956. right when they turned down Christ for the last time and the prophet indicted them for the second crucifixion amen amen if you're in the abundance of the word and things get difficult at work what do you say all that live Godly and Christ shall suffer persecution praise the Lord it's got to happen it's got to happen all that suffer all all Every Christian will suffer persecution there's no getting out of it yeah I I would expect that most of us had already faced it even our kids are facing it to a degree at the Baptist school because they don't believe the way they believe you're going to have to deal with difficulties and the filter of the word will tell you that what this is something that God's using this is something that God's prophesied therefore it's a good thing let's keep moving on amen otherwise what happens is we're full of what discontent and no matter how much we try what we're going to come out with is dark thoughts right because we're not looking at it the way God looks at it we're not using the message that we've been given that's opened up the word opened up our eyes to see what's going to happen and so we're there and we're getting down and down and down and we won't have joy or peace no matter what because we're looking at the world as if that's going to be resolved it's not he's going to burn it listen God says it's so bad I can't even fix it yeah so I'll just wipe it off yeah not saying he can't fix it but his way of fixing it is to destroy it right come on Amen listen let me get down to home the way you think about the people around you will show what's inside of you the way you think about your spouse if you're married will show what's inside of you because guess what except for my wife none of you are married to a perfect spouse wow wow amen we know brother Grant is getting he's getting he's getting uh down home with us he's getting used to us when he says wow to the minister behind the pulpit but Hey listen none of us are perfect and nobody knows my faults and failings like my wife does because she sees me in my highs and my lows my ins and my outs all these different things doesn't she and she can sit there and she can dwell all day long on what I'm not and you know what's going to end up she's going to be unhappy I'm going to be unhappy and it's going to drive our marriage into a spiral and guess what I can do the same thing with her because I know her faults too both of them right but listen what we dwell on shows what's in abundance because remember a word is a thought expressed so her words to me will tell me what she's been thinking about and my words to her will tell her what I've been thinking about her amen a word is a thought expressed the idea is to express what the word says about your spouse to focus on what's good and commit what's not so good to God understanding that so often what's bad about them is what's good in you and that's why he's given him or her you is so that you can bolster them up not tear them down amen amen Philippians 4 8 says finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just can I jump back to honesty don't start with honest with the other person start with honesty with yourself okay it's the only place you'll ever get anywhere with God is honesty with yourself right say Lord I'm looking at me the only person I have control of in this entire world is me and even then only barely right start with yourself whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report that means good to be talked about testimonies confessions of the word of God it says if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things so in other words if there's anything that you can think of that will help you strengthen you encourage you or cause you to lift someone or something up in a Godly way be thankful and have an attitude of praise and dwell on those things and leave the rest with God amen that's right that's the filter of the word now that will allow what a word to be a true thought of God expressed dwell on the things that he tells you to dwell on and you'll get the results that he tells you you're going to get amen the abundance inside of us will win every single time every single time and like I said so often our words will betray us before our life ever expresses it I've said it before over the pulpit but you know when I was a deacon especially back in in out west and so many people are your friends on there and you'd see things that they say or like and do and it would be a an inner look into their life way ahead of before them ever leaving the message and I'd see it coming months and months ahead of time just based on the little things that they were liking or responding to or their words even to other believers why because they were feeding on something and it was an abundance that was what welling up and coming out of them and they couldn't contain it one way or the other right your light will eventually reflect and bear fruit based on what's in abundance inside of you amen amen we're talking about this theme of a speaking bride today and I want to tie that with this thought of abundance so first John 2 18 says little children it is the last time it's the last time and as you have heard that Antichrist shall come even now there are many antichrists so they had them then they're definitely going to have them now that's Alpha right that's Alpha Church we're Omega Church right so you've got Antichrist then he says but many are going to come right and many they're already now whereby we know that it is the last time what does Christ mean Christ means anointed one so he says there are going to be many anointed ones that are opposite of what Christ's anointing was there were many then there's going to be even more now amen they'll think they're anointed they'll act like they're anointed and believe me they are anointed but there is something that's wrong in that anointing there's something that's wrong in the in the vessel that is being anointed amen they profess to be like Christ but they are not like him John says here they went out from us but they were not of us this is what happens to an antichrist spirit is they leave the word he says for if there have been of us they would no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they them that they might but be made manifest that they were not all of us now notice these Spirits manifest themselves amen It's manifesting Time and manifesting Time causes what separation always separation because how can two walk together unless they agree oftentimes we don't realize there's a disagreement because it's buried inside that person but it eventually comes out and they leave what the reveal word of the hour amen we're not talking here because this is used as a weapon I've heard it too many times you leave our church then this is your scripture this is not about leaving this church amen this is a local body and God adds and he removes as he would amen not everybody has to come here right and not everybody has to stay here right but it's whether you leave the word is what we're looking at not whether or not you leave this church what is this church it's just one of many one of many where there are you know you there's there's a bazillion out there with god-filled Holy Ghost anointed Ministry and people to be a part of Amen we have no claim on anybody here amen God leads his children sovereignly now verse 20 says but ye have an unction from the Holy One and know all things why why do we know all things personal knowledge education years of ministry years under the message parents raised me right great husband great wife no he says because you have an unction from the Holy One he says you know all things and when you look into this it doesn't mean that you know everything that you don't have this entire Encyclopedia of knowledge or understanding because none of us do that's an attribute of God the sole attribute of God that we don't get to tap into amen but what it means is you know all things that you need for this life it means that whatever you have need of knowing god provides it that God has a is a resource that's available and he has made himself available through the Holy Spirit to let you know what you need to know it means that you know the truth and guess what I don't need to know the truth about situations that I'm not in I don't need to know the truth about things that don't affect my life but I do need to know the truth about what I'm going through and where I'm at in life amen so so you know the truth for your life for your decisions your challenges and that's what counts is that God is there to lead us and guide us and he calls it an unction from the Holy One John finishes and says I have not written unto you because you know not the truth but because you know it and that no lie is of the truth now listen to the prophet of God puts it he says Lord surely the people would know that your servants standing here with not an Earthly way of knowing that there's a spiritual contact between these people and thy servant he's saying surely they know that this is not me that's doing this up here he said and I'm trying to tell them that it's your Divine gift that was sent down from glory to manifest your presence as you told Nathanael before Philip called you when you were under the tree I knew you right brother Branham didn't know them what was it the angel of the Lord knew them amen he's just transmitting what God has already seen what God has already said what God's going to do even he says you told the woman about her sins you told them where to find the mules you knew where the fish was that had a coin in his mouth you know all things that's where the all things knowing comes from he says you know all things and listen to what he says and you reveal them to us as we serve you amen so without serving you're never gonna know but with serving you will know all the things you need to know and we know you said these things that I do greater shall you for I go unto my father he says and your spirit is here manifesting now I want to jump back to the scripture we just read where John says we know all things because we have an unction from the Holy One and that word unction is is very interesting because it's only used once in the Bible right here and that's it it's never used anywhere else that word unction means anointing anything smeared on an ointment usually prepared by the Hebrews from oil and aromatic herbs anointing was the inaugural ceremony for priests referring to the Teaching Ministry of the Holy Spirit guiding the receptive believer into the fullness of God's perfect will fullness of God's perfect will that's what that word unction means but the real word of it means to anoint by rubbing or pouring olive oil on someone to represent the flow the empowering flow of the Holy Spirit it says anointing literally involved rubbing olive oil on the head especially to present someone as divinely authorized meaning appointed by God to serve as a prophet a priest or a king now guess what we are not classified as Prophets but we are classified as priests and Kings aren't we amen so this you remember in the scripture that Unity is likened under the oil that flowed down over Aaron's beard Aaron was the high priest remember the first high priest right it says Unity anointing or Unity is like that oil that flowed over the anointing what is it it is an abundance of the presence the anointing of God so much so that it doesn't just get the top of your head wet but it comes down and it completely and he didn't have a nice trimmed beard like I have he had a lot more hair on top too I'm sure I was sure Yesterday by a woman I think that was getting paid by the pound but but there was enough oil poured on him that it didn't just kind of anoint the top of his head but it came and it soaked his entire head until it flowed down through his beard it made a mess right but what it represents the will of God by his anointing soaking and saturating you that's what it represented amen I want you to catch something about this because we think of anointing as just well I'll just pour a little bit of oil on you know if if I had this cup and this was oil and I just you know anoint me brother John we just we just pour a little bit right when you come up for a prayer you know we've got we've got the oil here do we dump it over your head no we just take a little bit and we anoint your forehead right that's what we would tend to think anointing is amen but an unction which is an anointing first service does not just involve a pouring but it's a rubbing they would literally take that oil and they would rub it into the person's head right almost like they were massaging the scalp right and this oil there was so much of it and they were just just working it into that person's head so that what when they walked away there was no pretending that they hadn't been anointed right it wasn't just on them but it was now in them that the the pores of their skin had soaked up that oil that it was now a part of their head at least for the next little while amen remember the you know you you don't get that kind of an anointing with just a quick drop you know we talk about a Splash and Dash do you know what a Splash and Dash is it's a racing term where they come in they just need enough gas to get across the finish line so they just put in a little bit extra and then they go out this is not a Splash and Dash This is a stain there and the oil is just pouring and I'm almost thinking it's like they got a one gallon bucket and they're just there and it's soaking his entire head and then they get in and they start to rub it into his head that's what this is talking about this unction is when what you're in the presence of God so much and for so long that it saturates your entire mind that it saturates your being that you can't escape from it if most of us said how if I if I said brother or sister how much do you want to be Anointed with oil this morning we'd say just just a little just give me a little right we just need a representation brother John this is not what this is talking about this is talking about a soaking a saturating where you are literally bathed in oil and it's a part of you and guess what you walk out and everybody knows you've been anointed everybody knows you have an unction because you've been in the oil you've been in the presence of God Amen I imagine it wasn't a fun time for those priests to sit there and that oil is just going all over them ruining their clothes ruining their hairstyle right sometimes in church what holds us back how are we going to look after this is done right how are we going to look if we're shouting and dancing and praising or Screaming or crying blubbering at the altar going up one more time nobody else seems to go up except for me you've got to be willing to stay there to get the unction you've got to be willing to get in the presence of God and stay there until he gives you what you need to get the job done amen what it might be longer than you prefer and it might take more than you prefer but it'll be just enough to meet what God needs out of you amen he'll give you as much as you want to amen amen this is the only place like I said in scripture that's used and it's tied to what bringing you to the truth to a place where you know all things that you need to know for your life amen amen it's not always about words sometimes you know we're talking about a speaking bride and we're talking about a voice of abundance but it's about knowing how to act how to react how to be quiet how to reach out how to stay back sometimes it's all these things it's about the leading of the of the Holy Spirit I've been reading the book of Acts again in my devotions and it's amazing to me how many times they were checked by the Holy Spirit because so often we're thinking go go go but guess what there was plenty of don't go don't go don't go Hold Steady stay here right and so many times in the end they would stay someplace for months sometimes a year and in the end that City would reject them and then they move on and you'd say Lord why did I stick around what was that all for we got 12 people 12 people Lord for a year surely there's a better Harvest someplace else but the Holy Spirit told them where to stay and they stayed there until it moved on what do we see it in the children of Israel right when the cloud moved they moved and when it stopped they stopped and it was what it was a it was a shadow by day was a guard by day was a protection by day then at night it was a light to guard them amen you do that you get a relunction one time and you'll know what it means to find the will and purpose of God but you've got to get it the first time you got to stay there long enough you got to soak it up you got to stay in the presence of God until you say Lord I know what you want me to do and that's why we can't get in a hurry it's also why you got to be prayed up and in a strong relationship with God so that when you do have to make a snap decision you're ready to go because what you know what it means to get in his presence and get the answer and to move on by faith amen you got to be ready for the times when you don't have time to prepare remember brother Brown said David was prayed up when he went to hickle when he went after Goliath David didn't have to get prayed up didn't have to get right he didn't have to repent he was able to go right into battle because he was already right with God he was close with God he knew what God wanted him to do brother Brown says now if in your life you have an absolute you do things ordinarily you would not do especially if you have a god-centered life the god-centered life makes a person do things that ordinarily they would not do very odd peculiar why is a Christian life so odd and peculiar it's because they're looking to God's word which is almost foreign to the world today it is foreign we're well past the almost foreign it's completely foreign where even suppose Christians don't even know what the word of God says he says now we have churches we have organizations we have religion or much of it around the world but that isn't what I'm talking about I'm talking about an absolute connected with Christ then it makes you an odd person you do odd things your thinking is altogether different than the thinking you once did because you found something that you've anchored of faith in someone that created the heavens and earth that his very word is itself is creative a God who spoke the world into existence and there is nothing too hard for him listen to this he says so it makes you creative yourself because you take his words and a word is a thought expressed we're going to be getting in to speak the word in the next couple of services but this is where it starts he says you take his words that's what the unction is for is that you get his words you get his plan you get his purpose you get his will and then you speak and move he says now Paul had got into that state to where he had not had a theological experience altogether but he had a personal witness he had met God one and two he knew that he was called of God and nobody had to tell him anything about it he was absolutely sure that God still remained God if the world could just do that if this group tonight sitting here could just remember that God is still God he's just as able to answer in this case at his as he is in the case of Divine Healing or anything else he is still God and if we can build our hopes not only our hopes but a positive thought upon what he says and we know that it is the truth he says and people act funny they seem to just forget about the negative side because they have found an absolute because it's the word of God Jesus said heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never fail so if we've got the Word of Promise then there's no failing to it it cannot fail we're talking about the voice of abundance this morning amen if we've got the Word of Promise then there's no failing to it it cannot fail back in John 1 2 it says let us therefore let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning if that which you have heard from the beginning shall remain in you you shall also continue in the Sun and in the father what was the promise I heard from the beginning it's a Book of Joel that they expressed in Acts 2 38 amen repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you'll receive the gift of the Holy Ghost he says that's what's going to carry you through and this is the promise that he hath promised us even eternal life these things have I written unto you concerning them that seduce you but the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in you and you need not that any man teach you but as the same anointing teacheth you of all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it had taught you you shall abide in him remember where we were talking about ye know all things he says as the same anointing teacheth you of all things and his truth and is no lie even as is taught you you shall abide in him I want to stop here because we read about the false Christ amen the false anointed ones earlier and then John rolls around he says but there is a real anointing there is a real Christ amen you are a real Christ if you have this anointing because that's what's going to teach you as you move through life but I want you to catch what he says in 26 because you've got to discern between the real anointing and the Antichrist anointing it's an anointing but it's an antichrist anointing and verse 26 it says that always looks like I cut it out in verse 26 it says concerning them that seduce you the Antichrist spirit is seductive because why it wasn't the original in the in the Garden of Eden it was seductive but it was seductive physically and guess what in this time what does it do it seduces You by telling you what you want to hear right remember because they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and so the anointing the Antichrist anointing is for those that will go to Ministries that tell them what they want to hear that well what mollify them so that they don't get convicted that will tell them they're fine to keep living the way they are keep doing things the way they're doing to be tied to the world and tied to Christ at the same time that will let them stay where they are that's the seduction is you're good the Way You Are don't worry about it don't worry about it don't think about what that's what a brother I'm saying he'd say don't don't tell me what your pastor says don't tell me what the clergy say don't tell me what your denomination says tell me what the word says right and that's what a seductive Spirit does is it tells you what you want to hear rather than what the word says you should hear amen it won't tell you what the full words of God says amen that's the telltale signs if you're sitting under a Ministry that will only confirm where you are without taking you further it's a seductive spirit amen I've been listening to the message presuming and the prophet God talks about people and they're following people because they are doing well they have great signs and wonders they have gifts they have Ministries that that that are exceptional in so many ways but he says you've got to you can't presume that that's what takes you you can't presume that that's right just because they have signs and wonders following because signs and wonders have followed all sorts of people through the through the scriptures right but will they preach the word of God because if they're an error on one portion of the word of God then you can guarantee they're going to be an error in other areas and you'll get off by that little degree remember and so if your gun is off by a little bit well at 50 50 yards it's not going to be off by much but if you're at a thousand yards you're going to be off by what 5 10 feet the goal is to stay in line all the way through right so you can have somebody that preaches like a church a house on fire church on fire is probably more like it a man that has signs and wonders that that has Gifts of visions and all these different things listen it's without repentance of scripture says right they're people that have gifts and it doesn't mean anything just means they have a gift we don't follow after that we follow after the word and as long as they preach the word then we follow that right because then we're not following the man we're not following the ministry we're following the word as long as they stick with it amen but the prophet of God would point to the scripture and he he'd say you know people will say well that we don't need ministers anymore because we have the spirit of truth that's gonna you know Jesus said it'll lead you into all things and then John comes and says that you know all things because the spirit teaches you he even says you have need not that a man teach you now there's a paradox there you would think but brother Brown will point us back to the book of Ephesians and the five full ministry and he'd say oh please church have faith just a little while see you must come under teaching you say I don't need no one to teach me after the Holy Ghost has come my friends that just gives me a little room to doubt whether you really got it or not then see the way you're acting with it see the thing you're doing now why if the Bible says the holy spirit is the teacher then why did the Holy Spirit put teachers in the church then to set the church in order the same Holy Spirit he says the same Holy Spirit can't say you don't need teachers and then put them inside the church he says sure we don't need any seminaries to go around a big bunch of men to look out those things the holy spirit is a teacher see it's a teacher and it gives some fellow a gift of teaching and then you must be subject to that gift there are literally churches that teach they're not in the message as far as I know because it wouldn't make sense you can't be teaching it if you're not behind the pulpit but that they don't need ministers I got the Holy Ghost and so I just walked through life I don't have to even go to church I don't have to do anything I can just trust the Holy Spirit to me and he's going to lead and guide me into all truth and I know all things but about says no no you can't do that there's a five-fold ministry that's given for the perfecting of the Saints it is the god-ordained way for us to get across the finish line right doesn't take the place of personal devotions doesn't play take the place of your relationship with God but it's there for effect amen and if we don't sit under it then we lose that effect amen and who taught us that Paul did Paul teach us that we all say yeah he taught us that in Ephesians no Paul didn't teach us the Holy Spirit took him out on the back side of the desert told him what to say and then he came back and told us we're not following Paul we're following the holy spirit that told Paul what to say in the first place amen and he said what follow me as I follow Christ right so we're not following a man we're following the the god that's behind the man amen the war didn't come from Paul Paul challenged him he said did the work come from you or did it come to you and it's when the when we're saying it came from us rather than to us that we get into problems as ministers amen it comes to us and we just pass it on and we point the people to the one that gave us the message in the first place amen we're talking about the abundance inside of you so if you're struggling to give the right thing then what does it tell you there's a lack of an abundance of the right thing inside of you that doesn't mean you're wrong inside it just means there's not an abundance of what you need inside of you and we talked to you know about the blueberry service I think is what we're going to call it from now on where we talked about the fruits of the spirit love joy peace patience kindness goodness Faith gentleness make this self-control these different things and we talked about how that fruit is given for other people to eat it's given for you to display but for them to eat and then so often we get mad because somebody that we think ought not to take that fruit takes the fruit but the purpose of a tree is to be fruit bearing not to determine who eats the fruit amen and so if you're struggling to act the right way to represent Christ to project Christ to people then what does it tell you there is a lack of an abundance inside of you and we all get it we all get it man it's no reason to pretend we don't amen if you're giving a lot of something you want to have a lot of something inside of you and the the more you're required to give the more you're going to be required to be next to a source that can fill you up quickly right you know maybe young people certainly the the young kids you know in elementary school and whatnot they're not called to give a lot they're takers not givers so they don't need the same thing but if you're a parent if you're a parent you got to be constantly tied to the source because your physical energy your mental energy your emotional energy your financial everything is going to be tapped out all the time if you don't have a source of abundance to keep that up inside of you right and that's our responsibility it's our responsibility to to be diligent to make sure that we're taking the time to get those things filled up amen we don't blame others in those situations when somebody causes me to lose my temper it's not their fault it's my fault yeah right it's my fault because I didn't have enough of the fruit of the Holy Spirit to get me over that hump right and my family knows it right when I fall it's not because they're bad it's because I I need to topping up in an area right so often what we're finding is what an abundance of everything but Christ because that's what the world's pressing in on us right that's the battle is they're trying to press in an abundance of everything it's insane I've shared a couple things with a few Brothers this week and talk about abundance hey brother Joe it's insane it's absolutely insane and we're just touching the tops of things we're not even getting down into the nitty-gritty and the the real influences Behind these things and you look at it and you say it's absolutely insane and it's pressing in everywhere it's it's in the schools it's in politics it's in the economy it's in the natural world it's in the environment everything is just pushing in on us and the thing is we're supposed to be a fountain of abundance and what we've got is we've got a plug coming down from the world that's trying to stop that up so they can inject something else inside of us amen what we're fighting our own hurts and frustrations and fears and complexes and shortcomings and the only way to get past that is get an abundance of the one that can fix all of those things that can take us past it amen there's nothing wrong with being hurt there's nothing wrong being offended as long as we don't stay there all right we got to move past it we got to get over those things what is it how do you get past it you get an abundance of something that will overflow it that will conquer it amen the Conquering the first conquering we have is not each other it's ourselves and then the only concrete I'm supposed to have over you and anybody else in this church or in the world is love the love of Christ which is not the way they might want it but love is the greatest conquering factor that we have in our life but the first thing I've got to conquer is myself and so if I'm looking and I'm saying you're the problem not me then what's it what is it I gotta look inside I got to be honest right I got to get closer to God Amen you got to get past what others are and seek God to change you sometimes we got to fix our glasses we got to fix our lens that we're looking through and that's a change that has to happen here amen like I said before I'm the only one who has control that that has control over me can't control vaishal can't control sister Delfina and anybody else in between Kenner I got to change what's here I got to change what's here amen and I'll speak for you know we're tired we get tired a lot don't we listen we're gonna be as tired and as busy as we allow ourselves to be tiredness you can't help but busyness we can absolutely do it listen I got an iPhone in there every Sunday morning and I get a notification of how much time I average on my phone for the week and I can go in and I can look at every single app that I do and I can see what I spent the most time on when I spent that time on it so I can look into my life and I can see that I average whatever that was and I can see where I'm spending my time and now I can look at that and say was that time well spent or was that time wasted how do I know what was the abundance that came out of me this week right because here's the thing we have plenty of time for God when things are not going their way when we're in pain when we're we're struggling with health when we're struggling with relationships when we have no money when things are just difficult and new whatever it might be we got plenty of time for God but as soon as that's gone then what happens is we go back to what an abundance of something else the thing is will we stay with the abundance so that when the next Crisis comes up we're ready for it and we got something to push it away to push us through it to take us all the way through it amen Hallelujah you give time to God he's going to honor it every time amen amen because how do we how do things multiply in a believer's life do we multiply it are we the great multipliers no he says give to me this is God he says and I'll give back to you press down shaken together and flowing out so you give him one hour of your time and watch what he does to the rest of your life you give him you take some of that time that you've been spending on those wasteful things and you give it to him and God will never leave you high and dry he'll take it and he'll multiply it and he'll turn it into something greater than what you're going to get in the first place amen he never leaves his promise unfulfilled right he always gives you more than you give him it's funny because you remember the scripture they he says you've robbed me and they say how he says in tithes and offerings now I'm not talking about ties and offerings but my mom always used to put it this way she said I give God a tenth of my time I thought that was a pretty good way to go at it and then anything above and beyond that would be an offering but you gave God a tenth of your waking hours and that's going to do you some good right that'll get you to where you need to go now you can go way further and we're going to touch on it a little bit amen but will be as busy as we want to be and you'll find out that things drop away pretty quick when you decide that something else is more important this is in the message presuming she says let me tell you brother no wonder the spirit of God has departed from the thing no wonder we're back just as cold as the Methodist or Baptists we've got to come out of this brother or sister or God will consume us that's exactly right we've got to come back to the power of God to Old prayer meetings and shakings of the Holy Ghost until men and women live holy and sanctified yes sir get the world and all the Hollywood and dressing stuff out of the thing my that's right brother yes oh how sin is so deceitful how easily it creeps in like that and takes the thing just grabs onto you and holds you and goes away with it he's saying what takes away your Holiness your consecration your commitment your sanctification Creeps in doesn't jump in with a why I'm gonna take it oh it slides in doesn't it seductive right slow and easy seducers don't just step in and go like that it's the long game right bit by bit to break down your barriers until they get what they want he says that's what's happening in the church is you've got these things that are sliding in and next thing you know they take it and grab it and you've lost it not lost it forever but you've lost it for the moment he says now we look back and see the Pentecostal church at the beginning we think about the Pentecostals 30 40 years ago we think about the Pentecostals post Nicene Council we think about them early in the early ages are iranius and Saint Martin Columbus and we feel that seeing them that we've got the same blessing they had so we pursue we can perceive that we can just go right on like they do we perceive that we can do the same things that they did but we can't do it under these circumstances under these conditions that the church is in now he says look what those men did look what those churches did what a sacrifice it was what they had to give up how they counted their lives not even nothing to them they stayed on their face day and night praying to the Lord I talked about a tenth of your time he says you want to get where they are it's going to take coming up a little higher they stayed on their face day and night praying to the Lord they went everywhere they could in search for every crack and Corner they could get to testifying of the kingdom of God to the people listen to this he says and today we just expect the pastor to bring it in his briefcase or the Evangelist and say bless God I belong to the church that's it see I'm a member there I believe in this church this church is all right sure building might be all re right might be nothing wrong no termites or nothing in it he says we're expecting the ministry to bring everything that we need and that'll be it to satisfy us for the week that we look to the men behind the pulpit and say we'll take what they got and that's good enough it's not never has been you've got to move on in your relationship with Christ I can't give you an unction because I'm not the Holy One the holy spirit is the Holy One that's why I have I don't think I have any fear of drawing people to me but that's why I would never want it is because I can't give you an unction I can't give you the will of God I've had circumstances recently in the church where people were talking to me about situations and my prayer was not Lord tell me what to tell them my prayer was Lord tell them what they need because they need the unction the unction is for them because it's their life it's their situation it's their drama whatever it might be they need the unction so Lord I'm praying that you'll go to them and speak to them show them what to do show them how to handle things show them how to speak help them to be quiet when they need to be quiet why because you need the unction for you and I need the unction for me he says the building might be wrong no termites or anything he says but what about the building the other building what kind of termites has it got in it that's the things that might cause us trouble the termites that'll eat into the soul oh how we need to check up instead of presuming that we're all right that's a sober thing this is 62. seals haven't been open yet but there's a calling there's a calling out come out of her my people and then he's saying you need to open up because you've been stuck in something that's that's saturated with termites and you've got to let the one come in that'll exterminate those things and get the building set of right amen amen there's a seriousness that comes when we realize how late it is and you say Lord I need more than I got now I need more than I got now that's for sure Lord will you give me that will you do a check on my life and get rid of the termites that are in there what do termites do termites don't take you out just like a hurricane do they they go in and they worm their way into the materials until it's full of holes and it loses its structural integrity and then in one day it crumbles but the work is done over tens or dozens maybe 20 odd years they go in and they just eat it from the inside out and you can't see it all you see is the little hole where they went in and then they go in they eat out all of the inside I want to cross with close with the scripture because it puts into perspective what we're talking about this voice of abundance and I'm going to take you when John and remember he says you know as the scripture says you know I believe therefore have I spoken and we believe and therefore speak he was referring to Psalms 116 and I'm going to read it as we close here this is David and he says I love the Lord because he hath heard my prayer and my supplications what's the abundance coming out of David's mouth here God answers prayer when I go to him he answers amen the abundance is not that there is no reason to go to God but that when you go he provides what you have need of because he hath inclined his ear unto me therefore will I call upon him as long as I live what's the abundance here David has an experience of knowing that God listens to him the Sorrows of death come past me and the Pains of Hell got hold of me I found trouble in sorrow now that doesn't sound like an abundance I want I was telling my wife earlier this week in my devotions I read the Psalms or Proverbs and then I go into two different books of the of the New Testament usually and but but in reading the book of Psalms I said I'm getting a bit frustrated with David because he's always down in the dumps woe is me woe is me but then I stopped and I thought about it David got his unction he got anointed and then he spent 15 years running for his life and I get a little upset after a week you know things aren't going the way I want after a week I'm kind of like what was me David went through 15 years and still had as many highs as he had lows if you look at the sums you know for every bad one there's a good one you know he always came back around but he had some really down moments in his life where everybody was against him and sometimes he didn't always respond or do the right thing did he he says the Sorrows of death have compassed me they've surrounded me the Pains of Hell have grabbed hold of me the abundance that we have does not limit us from feeling pain from feeling sorrow from being hurt from facing difficulties in life but if that's all we're dwelling on then that's what's going to come out isn't it but what does David say he says then after all that happened then called I upon the name of the Lord oh Lord I beseech thee to deliver my soul gracious is the Lord and righteous yea our God is merciful so when it got difficult he reached out and he says the abundance that's out of coming out of me now is that the Lord is gracious and he is righteous and he is merciful don't focus on the down focus on the righteous and gracious and merciful god that's going to pull you out of it amen the Lord preserveth the simple you know what we're called Simple a lot you know why because we say the word says it we believe it I'm going to act on it and it's so simple for us and other people they'll bring in Emotion they'll bring in Social license they'll they'll bring in the way things are going and no no and we just say no what does the word say and we're simple that way but that's the way we're supposed to be that's how you live a simple humble Victorious Christian Life you say with what the word says the Lord preserves a simple I was brought low he says and he helped me what's the abundance here your current experience is not a reflection of your heritage in Christ we're simple here we're Kings and Priests in reality amen amen right we're simple down here but we rule and reign with him right we are the Spotless sinless bride of Christ though simple we are the Spotless symbol simple bride of Christ amen he says return unto thy rest O my soul for the Lord had thou Bountiful down bountifully with thee what's the abundance here there's a place of renewal there's a place where you can go back that's what Redemption is taking you back and guess what we get places of renewal all through our life don't we where God just comes in and he steps in and he does the work and he brings you out of the dull drums and he brings you into a place of Deliverance and joy and peace in these different things there is a place of renewal he says return to thy rest O soul for the Lord had bound to flee with thee return to rest return to peace if you've ever had it you'll want it and if you've never had it you'll want to seek it he says for thou has delivered my soul from death and mine eyes from tears and my feet from falling what's the abundance here doesn't say he wasn't falling means it never took any hold of him it never had an effect on him didn't cause him to break his leg what is it God makes all things good god holds up God protects us and God eases our sorrows and our pains he said I will walk before the Lord in the land of the living I believed therefore have I spoken let's stand together if we would what was David speaking about here he says I believed what I believe in the grace of God I believe in the mercy of God I believe in the righteousness of God I believe in the strong right hand of God I believe in the rest and the peace of God he says and I have believed that and therefore have I spoken he talked a lot about the difficulties he was going through but like I said in the end he always came back to that place where he recognized the reality of God he recognized the hand of God he recognized the protection of God he recognized that nothing would stop the plan of God he recognized that he has called me and therefore he's going to take me across the finish line right my current situation is no reflection of my Heritage in Christ that there's a purpose and there's a place for all of these things and you may have to go through things I don't have to and I guarantee I'm going to go through things you don't have to amen but if we will confess with our mouths because we believe he is what he is and what he says he is he says I'm going to take you through and it's a lot easier to go through life if you'll confess the good things than the bad things because confessing the bad things gives you nothing there's no benefit of of talking about how bad things are how difficult things are amen but there is a benefit to talking about the things that he's promised us amen because he's going to do it he's going to do it though he tarries says Terry and wait because he's not going to tarry forever and God bless you let's just bow our heads together yeah Heavenly Father Lord we want to have an abundance of you Lord we want to be so full of you that it can't be contained Lord that inside of us Lord what's inside of us tells on us Lord that we can't hide it that Lord even if we would for some reason want to hide it Lord let the yet the Life of Christ would just flow out through US Lord and Lord we've got to bring this minded subjection while we want our voice to be that of yours Lord we don't want circumstance to dictate how we speak Lord we don't we don't want to dictate how we feel Lord how we look how things are going right now but we don't want to let our past

ordained Lord that we would draw closer and closer to you every day Lord that you would fill us every day with your love Lord that you would just Lift us into a higher plane Lord that we would see
