any lesser than when they came in Lord but may the word just be Lord transformed into our lives Lord Lord may we reflect the very image of Christ Lord help us to open every door every access point Lord every room of our life Lord that your Holy Spirit would have free reign we pray this morning in Jesus Christ's name we're asking it amen amen God bless you thank you each one and greet each one good to see sister Elise amen the visitor God bless you good to see brother Emanuel with us again this morning God bless you amen and turn if you would in the scriptures to Isaiah 61 we'll have three scriptures we read this morning one in Isaiah 61 then then Luke 13 and then 2 Corinthians 3 bit of a different service maybe this morning in the way we start but certainly good to be here amen want to remember the many needs we've got brother Joe traveling to Malawi so we want to remember him I'm headed out for my hunting trip I'll leave right after service Lord willing and I'll I hope to visit the Saints depending how quickly I get an animal then I'm hoping even to go all the way out west to uh visit brother Doug and sister Beverly if I can but certainly I'll be visiting with the Saints around central New Finland amen so pray for both of us that God would be with us grant us grace and favor anden I spoke with Brother David Nash yesterday he just landed uh yesterday he uh preached 13 times in 10 days while he was in Honduras the in the trip we sponsored him there including five TV services in the morning so he said it went very well and he just wanted to pass on his thanks and greetings to the church this morning amen certainly want to appreciate brother Josh this morning just right on the money with the service that we're the thought we're going to be be preaching on this morning so we're thankful amen that's the that's the spirit of God leading us and that's what we love is when God does things perfectly amen amen Isaiah 61 verse one very familiar scripture says the spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord ha anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound this is 700 years before Christ comes along and we know that then he comes along and he reads that in the synagogue and he says this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears amen and that scripture has been open ever since that scripture has been open that prophecy has been opened and nothing has changed then we come to Luke chap 13 Luke 13 and verse 11 Jesus says in Luke 13:11 he says and behold there was a woman with which had a spirit of infirmity 18 years and was bowed together and could in no wise lift herself up now she had a spirit of infirmity that meant that she was kind of crippled up she was bent over but you know there's people that have spirits of infirmity you know there's a person I know and and it seems like every time something happens in their body they've got the world's worst disease and the absolute worst possible thing it could be is what they believe it is it's a spirit of infirmity it's a spirit of Torment that tells that person that anytime you get sick it's something serious it's something bad it's something horrible it's something that's going to kill you it's something that's going to keep you in your bed for 10 days and you're never going to feel the same again in these different things Satan likes to get in our in our way that way he likes to send a a spirit to torment us that what the the absolute worst that could happen is what's going to happen to us that's a spirit of infirmity as well it's not what this woman has but that's a hypochondriac somebody that thinks that anything that can go wrong will go wrong and when something goes wrong it's the worst thing amen don't ever let Satan jump into you like that amen we believe the word that by his stripes we are healed no matter what it is and it's not allowed to stay amen it says but when Jesus saw her he called her to him and said unto her Heroman thou are loosed from thine infirmity so Jesus had read that the spirit of the Lord was upon him and now he comes to a woman and he calls her out and he delivers her it says and he laid his hands on her and immediately she was made straight and glorified god let's turn to 2 Corinthians 3 2 Corinthians 3 and verse1 17 says now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty see it didn't die with Christ it didn't stay with Jesus the prophecy continues amen it continued with the Holy Spirit and it's here today even now until the end of the age to have the same effect in our lives it says but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even by the spirit of the Lord where's our Liberty where's the Liberty we look here it says that it's the changing of Our Lives it's the changing of us from the natural into the spiritual it's the changing of us from what we were born as Humanity into what we have been told to be by the word of God it says our freedom is in our word position in Christ amen that we may be changed even as by the spirit of the Lord amen you can have your seats this morning God bless you each one anden we're turning another Corner this morning and we're still talking about the charity that that we've been talking about but I want to take a title this morning of the spirit of freedom and we're going to I think we're going to spend some time on this the Lord knows I've got plenty of notes and studying a lot on this but you know as it is you only touch the surface so many times but I want to tell you this morning I'm here to encourage you I'm here to strengthen you I'm here to to build up your faith this morning because we've spoken how long we've been in a time of restoration Redemption if you remember we did a series that was 47 Services long we talked about the the times of restoration and Redemption and and the purpose of God releasing the the Holy Ghost to the believer and the purpose of the Holy Ghost is to produce the Living Word that's what it's to do is to produce the Living Word whatever your portion is it's to make it live inside of your life amen but the apostles saw Falling Away of that power even in their time and remember they talked about wolves and sheep clothing it says they they they are going to to come and they even are now and we're seeing these things and they saw the drop off of the church but now we've got a time and we're in a a season where there's a restoration back to what they had in that original time amen and it's the power of the Holy Ghost by the full word of God to produce what he said would happen inside of this age amen we've talked about what charity is it's divine love it's the love of God but it's not just that it's the nature it's the person of God to make the word live in our life the way it's supposed to and we've talked about what it makes us do towards other people and we talked about how it is patient and it's kind and it can bear all things and it can endure all things and and it doesn't lash out in these different things but I want to start to talk about what it does for us as in what it does for me and what it does for you and your life the personal benefits of this what it does in your mind in your spirit in your family in your relationships in your work in your house in your body all of these things about what would happen if we'd let the Holy Ghost have its way in those things because the Holy Ghost is here to remove every hindrance to you living an overcoming life amen it's a it's a door opener it's a wall breaker and it's a chain relasing power for the for the for the believer today amen listen there when you get the Holy Ghost you may have fought battles all your life you may have issues you may have complexes you may may may have things that you have never won the battle over but when God gives you the Holy Ghost it is that you could overcome every single thing that Satan has placed in your life Baron that's it it is total overcoming power amen now I want to set us up this morning with with a quote and I've read this way way back when but I want to just kind of set a tone again this morning on this brother Braham said Canaan is a type of the Holy Ghost Egypt is the world that they come out of the Wilderness is where they were Sanctified a Sanctified called out Church Canan is where they settle down with the holy spirit cuz they still have wars they were saying that that it was a type of the Millennium he said or or the you know when all things are made new he says no they still got Wars he says if you don't believe you have wars just get the Holy Spirit once amen that's the start of war not the end of War he says but what are you doing what do you do in Canaan they were possessing their rights he says glory and they could not possess their rights until they got into Canaan he didn't say they didn't have rights before Canaan he said they couldn't possess rights until they got into Canaan because Canaan was where their rights were he says when they come into Canaan he says they didn't know nothing in the wilderness then when they come into Canaan then they had rights they had the promise all along but it was only in Canaan that they could receive what God had promised he says and we've got rights he says when you receive the Holy Ghost you're in Canaan you have to fight for it every inch of ground you have to fight for it yes sir so when God gives you the Holy Ghost when he seals your soul to the day of redemption what is it he's doing he's drawing the battle lines because you've made your commitment to him he's made his commitment to you he's put the seal on his soul and now you're identified you're identified which side you're on there's no doubt about it anymore Satan knows you're not on his side God knows your form Satan knows you're against him and so now every gun in hell is trying to hold you back from every promise in this word did you know there's some promises in this word you can't have till you get the Holy Ghost absolutely absolutely there are things that you cannot have there are things you cannot produce until you get the Holy Ghost because it takes the life the nature the character of Christ in you to produce those and put them in the way that they're supposed to be in your life amen but that's just a starting point because we're in this time of restoration Redemption and we've got things that are in the word for us and it takes the Holy Ghost to bring victory in our lives in certain things it takes the indwelling presence of God so let's go back to the scripture this morning as we set this up in Deuteronomy 31 it says and Moses called unto Joshua and said unto him in the sight of all Israel be strong and of a good courage for thou must go with this people under the lamb which the Lord has sworn under their fathers to give them and thou shalt cause them to inherit it Thou shalt cause them to inherit it Joshua was a type of the leadership of the Holy Spirit if you've got the holy spirit in your life will cause you to inherit the word Promises of God it's not going to hold back the holy spirit is not static it's not stagnant but it's a life force it's a pressure and it's something that's pulling you and it's pushing you into the promises of the word of God for you it says and the Lord he it is sorry yes and the Lord he it is that doth go before thee who's leading the way brother John he is he will be with thee he will not fail thee neither forsake thee fear not neither be dismayed where's our rest Church our rest is that he goes before us that he will be with us that he will fight for us that he gives us strength that he gives us F courage that he takes away all doubt amen the Holy Ghost is the power for the Christian walk you stand by the Holy Ghost and you fall without it you've got to have it to walk this fight amen you've got to swing the sword but he gives you the weapon that'll cut amen you've got to walk forward but but God is the one that makes the enemies fall before you it's the power of God in you that makes you do these things it's the power of God that makes your enemies fall before you that makes the walls come down that opens the doors that makes a way where there is no way amen he says fear not be dismayed don't look at them look at me look at the one that's going before you you've got to be able to see God you've got to be able to see what God's doing in your life you've got to be able to see the leadership you've got to be able to see the Promise you've got to know that you're where he wants you to be Deuteronomy 11 he says then will the Lord drive out all these nations before you he's the power he says and ye shall possess greater Nations and mightier than yourselves we're the ones that get the benefit of his work we're the ones that get the benefit of his power now guess what the power of the holy spirit in you looks a lot like work cuz you've still got to fight you've got to put your faith to the test you've got to put your life on the line but it's the power of the Holy Ghost that makes them fall he says it's going to be people that are greater than you that are mightier than you that have more than you that have been trained better than you but they will fall at your feet because I'm the one that fights for you you're going to face cancer but it'll go you're going to face doubts but it'll go you're going to face complexes but I'll defeat them you're going to face troubles and trials you're going to need things but I'll deliver and I'll provide and I'll do all that you need he's the one that's going to do it amen they've been the things that we've been hold held back from so long have to come to us by the power of the Holy Spirit Satan's been camped out on your rights for a very long time and it takes the Holy Ghost to move him off now watch what he says every place whereon The Souls of your feet shall tread shall be yours from the Wilderness in Lebanon from the river the river Euphrates even unto the uttermost sea shall your Coast be now notice he says every place that's an absolute but it's every place within the boundaries that I lay out so you got to be in God's boundaries not in your own boundaries Israel's never bless when they try and expand their land God's laid out a boundary Church he's given us a word and as long as you stay within the word everywhere that the soul of your foot will tread Belongs to You amen we've got to find our place in the word and stay there cuz that's where Victory is amen you got to stay with the word because that's our inheritance he says every place where on the souls of your feet shall tread shall be yours there shall no man be able to stand before you for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that you shall tread upon as he has said unto you notice God's using absolutes God's the only one that can use absolutes because he's the only absolute we can't do it I can't say every and no none but God can and he says every place you walk that means without exception everywhere you go in the word of God belongs to you if you got faith to go there it belongs to you and then he says no man not a single one that means everything you face Must Fall at your feet by the power of the Holy Ghost what's he trying to do he's trying to build their faith up cuz if your faith gets built up your feet will follow if your faith gets built up your life will follow if your faith gets built up your confession will follow and all of a sudden you can start walking into the word of God and into the promises that you've never gone before listen to what the prophet of God said he said and when God gave Israel the promised land while they were still in Egypt they had to fight for every inch of that land God told Joshua and Joshua 1 wherever The Souls of your foot Treads upon that I've given you for a possession so Footprints means POS possession some people can just get barely to the edge of the land some take the two-handed sword and cut their way through Philistines and amorites till they take the whole thing he says that's what we should do every promise is to us footsteps is possession walk right up and take it God gave it to us it's a promise and it's the truth and it's for us Satan hates it when you cross over Jordan when he sees a death to self Satan gets scared because his power is in your selfishness it's in your Beast nature when you die to self when you cross over Jordan and you come into Canaan you come into the power of the Holy Spirit The Living Word eternal life then what is it Satan starts to worry because now he doesn't have an inroads on you his inroad to you is s but that's been sealed the Holy Ghost has sealed your soul now and so now he's only dwelling with the Flesh and he starts to tremble why cuz he's been camping out on the word of God he's been holding you back believing you won't make it and when you get the Holy Ghost you've crossed over now you're in the land of the Holy Ghost now you're in the land of the full word of God and he realizes that your aim is to kick him out that your aim is to take what he's been holding back from you for so long he knows his time is Short scripture talks about it there's a time where Satan realizes his T time is short and he comes down with great wrath he's desperate he's doing everything he can to hold you back cuz the the further you go the less time he's got what did Rahab say to the Spy she says we've heard and we're all scared let me tell you Satan is scared of you this morning remember the prophet of God said when the weakest Christian Falls to their knees all of heaven trembles when you fall and you hold the token of the holy spirit before you Satan knows he's in trouble Satan knows he's got a fight on his hands and he knows he's got to leave because you're holding your Birthright you're holding the title deed you're holding your inheritance before you and he has no right to be there what was it she said we've heard of all the things that you've done and they weren't even in the land yet listen God does things with us before we get the Holy Ghost people get healed people get delivered there's provision all of these things are available to us but that's just before you get it imagine what it's like after you get it because it's now with a greater purpose now it's with a greater intent because it's not General now but it's the word of of God coming to life inside of you and that's what Satan hates the most is when he sees the Living Word coming out of your life but you notice in the desert they had their ups and downs you know in the desert they lost they had people taken hostage they refused the land they refused the promise but once they crossed Jordan there was no going back and God promised victory victory victory victory victory it was all Victory amen as long as could stay within the boundaries God promised them Victory this is what he said when not if church if you're not going to fight the fight will come to you if you got the Holy Ghost every gun in hell is trained on you you may not pick a fight but the fight's going to come to you so not if but when thou goest out to battle against thine enemies and see is horses and chariots and the people more than thou be not afraid of them when you face sit situations that are way more than you think you can handle don't be scared you got this cuz you're in my land you're in my word you're in your inheritance you're in the place that I have led you he didn't lead you didn't lead yourself I led you through I made a way I supernaturally parted the waters I've established you in the land now go take it he says for the Lord thy God is with thee which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt scripture says remove not not the ancient landmarks Moses said WR a book of remembrance when you think that things are too tough for you to handle think back on what God's done for you remind yourself of the things that God has delivered you from remind you of the provision of God remind yourself of the healing of God remind yourself of the leadership think back on what he's done cuz the god that started it is the god that's continued with you he hasn't changed he's still there he says and it shall be when you come nigh under the battle that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people Church there's a priesthood today there's a five hoold ministry that's here to help you get through the battle and we're here to give you Faith we're here to give you courage we're here to remind you of your place in the word so that you have courage that the place you're in is the place that belongs to you that you can take it it belongs to you it's for you and don't look at the barriers don't look at the things in front of you but look to the promise and look to the god of that promise cuz he's the one that's with you amen if you'll hear if you'll sit under the hearing of anointed word it'll prepare you for the battles in your life and it'll give you victory in your life as well he says and shall say unto them here o Israel ye approach this day under battle against your enemies let not your hearts faint fear not and do not tremble neither be ye terified because of them for the Lord your God is he that goeth with you to fight for you against your enemies and to save you he's a warrior to them and he's a savior to you I like that combination he's a destroyer to them and he's a savior to us amen Satan is looking to do anything he can to keep you from coming to this place he wants you to think you're defeated you're not enough you don't have enough you don't have it in you you're not what you should be Satan wants you to think you are what you used to be and he never wants you to know what you are in Christ he never reminds you of the truth of your position in Christ listen you made it this far you made it this far what can hold you back look how far you've come look at the things you've made it through and then press on to the next Point amen the only way that Satan had to keep Victory out of them was to put sin in the camp now here's the thing willful sin CU remember what happened aen willfully sinned he went and he found the Babylonian garment and he found the the wedge of gold and the the bit of silver and he knowingly took that into his home and hid it that was willful sin listen we walk in a dirty world you get dirty when you walk around dirty things we just had communion that's why they had to wash their feet it was it was the fact that when you walk in a muddy place you get mud on you I don't care how careful you are you're going to get dirty and that's why we have the blood of Christ that's why we repent every night dirt gets on us the idea though is to wash it off every day to put it under the blood but he says when you invite it in Victory leaves you willfully sin Victory leaves the home and here's the thing you'll notice things you used to beat you can't beat anymore because you let sin in the house why you open the door for Satan to come in that's willful sin that's the only way he's got to beat you is to put sin between you and him you and God willful sin that you'll be in iniquity amen when you invite sin in into your life by Disobedience direct Disobedience Victory leaves and they went and they went up against Ai and they lost they just sent up a few men they said figured oh it's a small town what something I should be able to beat as a mature believer but with sin in the camp they got their they got whipped cuz they invited sin in amen but through it all God promised Victory he's given us a blood covering he's given us a robe of righteousness if we're quick to repent he's quick to forgive right there's nothing going to hold us back the blood is there we've got an advocate with the father if our heart condemns us we have an advocate we've got somebody that can make it right we got somebody that can take care of our conscience amen but he's made every provision for victory and it's through the power of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives you know I've noticed that when God deals with the Jews he's very specific in the timelines you look at it and they are Picture Perfect to the year for what God said he was going to work with them you know you got the 70 week you got the 70 years of Daniel you got the 400 years for the children of Israel to be in bondage and all of these different things you have perfect timelines but let me show you when it came to can Canaan God only said one thing about the timeline little by little and he said and it won't be a year after all this time of working in a perfect timeline God says there is no timeline for this it'll just be little by little he says in Exodus 23 I will not drive them out from before thee in one year let the land become desolate and the Beast of the field multiply against thee by little and little I will drive them out from before thee until thou be increased and inherit the land in other words you got to grow to fill the land before I'll give you the land because otherwise what happens is we clear out everybody else and because you don't have enough people to fill the land other others will come in and they'll take it back from you we've got to grow into our inheritance you get the Holy Ghost that doesn't mean you stop growing it doesn't doesn't mean you stop maturing but it means you're maturing constantly that as the victories come you're filling up the space that it clears out and Bit by Bit by Bit day by day by day what's happening we gain strength we gain endurance we gain commitment we gain consistency all of these things you know the scripture talks about it Jesus talks about it he said when a when a demon Spirit leaves a person and it goes out for a while and then it comes back and it finds that life all cleaned up all cleaned up but no one res resent no one living there so it says hey this is a better place to live than before and it calls seven other demonic spirits and they Comm in it says the last state of that person is worse than they were in the beginning why cuz they didn't fill up the emptiness with something that would keep it out in the end that's the way our lives are as Satan a as Satan is cast out of our Lives we got to fill it with God when that door gets open and the Holy Ghost clears it out you got to fill the room you got to fill the room with the things of God as as things are taken out of our Liv lives we get more time you got to fill that with good things not with more things that Satan wants but you got to fill them with the good things of God you've got to put the word to action in your life to make sure that you're filling those rooms of your home that your land is taken care of so that things can't come in and make it worse than it were was before man as we go through these things there's going to be Trials of our faith you get the Holy Ghost it's the start of so many trials amen there'll be Trials of patience commitment there'll be Trials of our understanding and there to grow us and take is closer to God every single one is a purpose for a child of God every trial has a purpose in the world they they go through things and they learn nothing they get nothing from it so often but for a child of God it always has purpose and what is it it's to bring us closer to God always to bring us closer to God brother Braham said this he says it is written in one of the scriptures in the Bible that trials brought upon us are more precious to us than gold itself for it is God giving us these trials he says and we after we become his property our confession and our baptism and our promise to walk in life for him then every trial that comes upon us is to perfect us for his glory it's to bring us to a place where God can make himself more real to us than he was before the trial come how many want more of God get ready for trials how many want to know a greater Living God get ready for trials you don't have to raise your hands amen how many want to see God in a greater Supernatural element you got to get into situations that require more of a supernatural element you want to see greater power you got to get into a greater trial you want to see more of God you've got to come up against more of Satan don't you but it's for the purpose of glorifying God and drawing us closer I mean you if you've been with people you know I think of even my sister going through cancer and then miraculously healed but she said it does something to your life because when life hangs in the balance you seek God in a way you haven't before there's a desperation there's a sincerity there's a Holiness that comes across your life and what's it doing it's God bringing you closer to him that's all he wants us to do he's trying to produce the word in your life and that means everything else has to get pushed out and as good as we are as old as we are as long as we've been serving the lord in this good old way there's always things that need to be pushed out always it's a NeverEnding thing we're always having to grow amen so don't get upset with the trials if we understand the purpose embrace them and say Lord I'm going to come out of this closer to you than I was before and if that the trials are pushing us away then we've forgotten who we are and we've forgotten that we're a child of God and that God does these things for our good amen are you going through a trial today God's got a purpose God's got a purpose Isaiah said in chapter 54 and 17 said no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper no that's an absolute none zero zil nada nothing that comes against you can prosper that word Prosper means it cannot Advance huh can't even push you off your ground it cannot make progress and it cannot succeed doesn't mean they won't try there's many weapons formed against us there's many things are coming against us there's many things will come against us but he says not a single one of them is allowed to prosper against the believer he said this he says and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn there will be no accusation that can hold and there's full victory in the believer's Life what a place and that's your place in Christ spotless sinless Perfect Bride he says this is the Heritage this is the inheritance this is the property of the Servants of the Lord and their righteousness is of me saith the Lord I want to remind us of a quote I read just a couple Services ago and we're speaking on the Holy Ghost and what it does for us and in us and the power it brings to our life and brother Braham said when perfect love has come into the human heart all demons in hell all will never be able to upset it everyone cannot do it that's an absolute no weapon that formed against the shall prosper no weapon no person no Creed no Doctrine no Ministry no experience no complex no problem nothing can knock you off of your position as a child of God church I want you to to find your Anchor Point this morning if you are a child of God and you have received the Holy Ghost you cannot fall you cannot fall we read it last service remember in second Peter 1 Peter says if you go through this entire thing all these attributes from Faith all the way to brotherly kindness and then you get charity which is the Holy Ghost he says if you do this you cannot fall it's impossible you can't do it you can't do it when he seals your soul that's it it's a finished work it's done you cannot lose your Eternal reward you cannot lose your position in Christ you cannot lose the restoration that he's bringing about in your life amen how is this possible because when God takes up residence in your soul it's him that keeps you up it's him that makes you stand it's him that makes you walk it's him that makes you overcome it's Christ in me that's doing it it's not me I can't fall because it's him that's living inside of me I died I'm dead I fell now he lives that's why I can't fall because it's Christ in me the hope of glory that's keeping me on this way that keeps me pressing towards the promises of God that keeps me looking for leadership that keeps me trusting in his word day by day it's Christ in me that's living not me he's the mighty conqueror he's the power he's the life he's the Fountain of everything that I have need of in my life but around would say this he says we know that you're here we know that you're the same yesterday today and forever we know that you cannot fail we know that you've triumphed over the devil over his power over every principality and power you bound every unclean Spirit you cast out every devil when you were here on Earth now let's take it to us in John 5 it says verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me ha present tense right now right here today has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but his past already done it passed from Death unto life amen we've already been judged in Christ we've already been given eternal life and we stand now and we cannot fall because we're in him he said but as many as received him gave he the power to become The Offspring of God he said I give unto them eternal life eternal life comes from the Greek word of Zoey Zoey is that life Zoe is the life of God and the life of God living in you produces a Godly life just as certain as I'm standing in this platform and the man that's got it can no more perish than God can perish because God is in the man do you have the Holy Ghost this morning you can't perish because it's God in you church we tend to think in short terms we're human we tend to think of even to the the aspect of just our natural life well I was born I'm 44 years old today and it's all about the here and now but when you look at who you are you got to look big picture because you go all the way back to Eternity you go way back before time began when God had a thought of you and God has been working in this case for thousands and thousands of years to bring you to where you are today he had to set up Union after union relationship after relationship marriage after marriage immigration after immigration this after that to bring everything around to produce you right here today and it's a tangled web that nobody could ever unwave and it's the it's God himself that's been purposing and bringing you to this place today to where you can sit under the hearing of the word and accept it that you have been coming to a place where you can hear the truth and the truth can set you free that's the working of God and he thought it way back when and until and as soon as he thought it and he spoke it it's been working ever since to bring you to this place today where you are wherever you're at in life God has purposed it and God has worked it out amen and he's bringing you back into relationship that's his only thing is to bring you back to where you were in the beginning and nothing's going to stop him from doing that listen to this it says that's the same thing he does does when he gives you the Holy Ghost baptism with fire he can come and dwell with you and we can sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus because we are already in him not we will be we are now sitting in Christ Jesus how do we get into it by one Holy Ghost baptism by one Spirit we're all baptized into Christ which we are now we won't be in Christ he says we are he is the great spiritual King over the spirit that's in us because we were in him at the beginning I want you to see this next it he says see God in the beginning when he thought of you and thought of others like you thought of himself of being tangible that's why you're sitting here today is because God's thoughts became word and that word went forth and that word has to become tangible this whole series is on manifesting time what becoming tangible the word becoming tangible the promise of God becoming tangible God himself stepping into human flesh in Bride form and producing the word for this day he says God's thoughts were meant to be tangible you know what that tells me Church there's a tangible effect of being a Christian that it's not just hulum pokum and it's not just Theology and it's not just ideas and doctrines but it's a life it's an effect it's it's the very purpose of God coming through us it's not just sitting at home and reading our Bibles it's not just coming to church and warming a Pew and singing songs but it's the very life of God becoming real through you and I that's what he's looking for tangible word touchable word seeable word hearable word feelable word that's what he's looking for that's why he gives you the Holy Ghost so that the word can become tangible he says that was his thoughts see so he expressed his thoughts by word he said let there be Let There Be and there was and it's sitting in front of us today and the whole world misses it God revealed in Simplicity the thoughts of God are sitting in these pews today the expression of the thoughts of God are sitting in this pews today what do we call the word what do we call the thoughts of God Church the word the word is sitting in the pews today and it's by the power of the holy spirit that you can do it this morning that you can produce it he says his word cannot fail well I just told you you're the word the word made flesh so you cannot fail as long as the word has the preeminence put your name here I cannot fail as long as I'm with the word he said he's God and what a refuge that is what a consolation to know that we're not children just tossed about not knowing where we're going we know where we're going God promised it and he vindicates his promise church we know where we're going going we're in the last bid of the seventh Church age all that's left is a resurrection and a Rapture we're going in a Rapture by God's grace and if we go by way of the Grave we'll go in a resurrection and these body will be changed from Mortal to Immortal and in a moment in the twinkling of an eye will be changed and we be caught up to be with him that's what the power of the Holy Ghost is is the final expression is in that resurrection and in Rapture but in the meantime it's got a work here to do to produce the Victorious Life of the believer inside each and every one of us that's the purpose of God today amen the purpose of the Holy Ghost is to produce what God Said the word goes to the word the word produces the word that's what's happening here today the word is coming to the word and it'll knock down anything it needs to knock down it'll open any door it needs to open it'll go around anything it needs to go around it'll go under it'll do whatever it has to do to get where it's going to go to get where it's supposed to go to get you into that Resurrection Rapture he says he showed us he's speaking of Christ he showed us how it's done how did he do it by the word that's how he done it for he was the word and Jesus said if you abide in me and my words in you you're back to word again the Word of Promise that's what we are today the Word of Promise he says what is the Word of Promise to every Christian greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world he says then how do I overcome not me but the word that's in me I'm not trusting in this flesh this flesh is weak even as an experienced Christian this flesh is weak but greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world he says the word is God then I overcome the things of the world because it's the word in me if you abide in me in my words and you then just ask what you will so often we look at that as an external asking Lord I ask that you provide money Lord I ask that you provide for this or you do no no no ask for this first Lord this body this Spirit has needs and it needs to be the word like we said last service are our prayers about the natural or about the spiritual what is our focus is it to make a resurrection in a Rapture or is it to make our next bill payment he said says just keep pressing up you're coming up to the top as sure as anything see you've got to come to the top what is it the word is becoming flesh amongst us church if we know where we're going let's focus on getting there listen I'm I'm headed out to go moose hunting after this service is done you know what's going to happen as soon as this service is over I'm going to shake hands I'm going to run out the door I'm going to pack up the van and I'm going moose hunting why I know where I'm going I got a timeline to get there I got a purpose to get there and nothing is going to stop me by God's grace I'm focused on making it there before it gets too dark so I don't hit a moose on the way there right my only focus after the service make it to moose hunting but as a Believer what's our Focus make it to a resurrection and a Rapture and our mind needs to be set on the things of God on the purpose of God of the plan of God of of what God is trying to do in our lives rather than just the Munday of every day we've got to see deeper than that we've got to lay aside every fear every doubt every worry and say Lord lead me and I'll follow show me what's mine and you can only know what's yours by reading this by hearing this and Faith cometh by hearing and hearing comes by the word of God faith comes by understanding and understanding comes by the word you're not reading your Bible you're not hearing your Bible you're not coming to church whatever it might be you're going to miss out because there's an anointed place for you to hear these things it's to bring you into your word position like Mary said the word came to Mary and she didn't understand it all but she said be it unto me according to Thy word I can't explain all of this to you I can't explain how God works I can't explain why he holds or why he moves sometimes I can't explain the intricacies of of God's mind but all I can say is Lord I believe it Lord I believe you're doing it Lord I believe you've done it and Lord I believe I'm a part of it why because he came to me and he's come to you to tell you you're a member of the Bride of Jesus Christ this morning Paul said this what know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have of God and you are not your own church you know what it means there it means that I'm not my own it means I'm God's Property and when you belong to God that brings some real benefits with it amen it means we belong to him it means your life is under the authority of God that means it brings Victory it brings Holiness it brings peace it brings rest it brings love it brings contentment all of these things come when God has made the center of our Lives amen it brings Victory he says for ye are bought with a price what a price it was he says therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are God's you notice he doesn't say the soul cuz here the soul is already sealed that work's already done he says you're the Temple of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is already dwelling inside you so he says now glorify God in your body and your spirit remember last service we drew the three rings and in the inside is the soul and then the next is the spirit then the next is the body he says now that you've got God on the inside of the inside let God out let God into the rest of your life let him into your mind let him into your memory and your conscience and Imagination let them go in your five senses let faith of the word come forth and produce God in the rest of it let the Holy Ghost clean out the rest of it so that the rest of it can glorify God we don't have to sit here and say this flesh this flesh this flesh it's weak we know it but through the Holy Ghost we can make it of no effect if we let the Holy Ghost loose it'll make this flesh even glorify God it'll make our mind glorify God it'll Cast Away vain imaginations it'll Cast Away complexes it'll do things in our life that were not previously possible why because the holy spirit is being let loose in your life to glorify God that spirit in our body is our is our humanity and he's saying let God be glorified even in your Humanity you know what it does church it's a promise that takes away our excuse right you got the holy ghost that means everything in your life can be made subject to the power of the word everything you know I think about this has happened to me a number of times I'm sure men will understand our children if you've had your wife or children if you've had your mom ask you to clean something up and you go and clean it to the best of your ability and then when Mama or wife comes in what does she do starts cleaning why because she's got a standard that's higher than your standard she's got a vision of what that room should look like or could look like and it's different than yours she has a required cleanliness that's greater than yours and so as good as your job was before when Mama comes in the room the standard changes and she starts putting this here and that there and oh you missed this on the carpet no let's let's run a vacuum over this again pretty soon she does all the work that you did before I remember recently she asked me to clean up the the bathroom and I went and I wiped everything down she went in and wiped everything down all over again why she's got a higher standard and as clean as our lives are under sanctification under justification when the Holy Ghost comes in the standard goes up standard goes up why he's in the house and God's standard is higher than our standard and things that used to be okay they're not okay anymore God starts to clean up the house amen he's very particular about how his house looks because the house is now a reflection of him not a reflection of you his name is over the house His Banner Over Me Is Love right Jehovah nii our Banner we sang about it this morning his name's over the property now this is no longer the home of Jonathan klette this is now the home of Jesus Christ and he has a word standard for every aspect of the property church he doesn't just come in and clean the house he starts to work on the whole property because remember the house is the soul but then you got to thing around that and that's the close-up lands and then you got beyond that the body and that's the far sprung reaches of your entire life he says and every bit of it has to come to a place where it can glorify God you know you you look around when I was in BC things rot there I think faster than anywhere else in the world they get so much rain and it's such a temperate climate so anything that's wooden rots and you'll drive by these beautiful properties and the house is perfect but everything on the fringes is broken down the fences have rotted and they've fallen down and if somebody wanted to come in they could easily get in if animals wanted to get in or out they could but when God comes in he starts working on every element of our life those fences that were broken down he starts to build them up the gates that don't work he starts to repair right he starts to clean up the property starts to take out the dead stuff he starts to clean it up so it looks nice so it functions right he's turning it into a working property now instead of a shambled property why because it's his property now so he sets up a security system and he sets up guardian angels and he puts out patrols and he builds the fences up again and there's controlled access now through a gate and the only one that can open that gate aside from him is you so when bad stuff comes in it's because we let it in because he's cleaned it up he's made the he's made everything around it secure and the only one that lets it in is us it's the only way Satan can get in because he's in the house now and he builds everything up around it to keep everything back and everything that was in it that was bad he moves it out how many of you have driven around in we don't see it maybe so much in New Finland you see it more out west and you drive by a farm or something they got 18 rused cars out in the field somewhere old complexes old family issues old scars things you used to do God doesn't let those stick around Holy Ghost cleans them out moves them out because it's an eyes sore it's not befitting for the king all of these things he what is he doing he's cleaning it out because they don't glorify God anymore and you know what you got to let it go we deal with a lot of complexes I got to let it go the power's there to move it the equipment's there to haul it out I got to let it go sometimes we have Nostalgia for the old things let it go we hold on to hurts because it solidifies us in our bitterness no no we got to let it go the difference between simple sanctification which is the work of the Holy Spirit and the indwelling of the holy spirit is that the holy spirit is establishes full dominion over every aspect of your life it's there to raise the standard of the word to make us live to make us breathe the very word of God in every aspect of our life it's there to set us free from every attribute of sin brother B would say this many times he says you know if if an animal latches on to me he says I don't need to cut off the leg he says I just need to cut off the head he says go for the head don't go for the limb he says you'll get a much more immediate response if you chop off the head he says and that's what Christ did at Calvary is he chopped the head off of sin and every attribute every claw every tooth every bit of it that can harm you was killed at Calvary and so the only thing that holds you back is if you let it in cuz it's dead it's dead if Christ is in your life listen to what he says he says Satan the ruler of the earth he owns it he says it belonged to him but now Christ has redeemed it one time I was his property but not now one time that little woman was his property but not now he's talking about that scripture we read in Luke he says see he come to loose the grip of it he loosed the grip of sin of Satan upon my life upon your life and now we're not his he says have you often heard me say in prayer take your hand off of God's Property see amen have faith to claim your own have faith to claim your own what's a part of your property it's not just you you've got family that belongs to you he says have faith to claim your own that's your rights that's your rights all that loved you and all you ever loved will be over there claim your rights he says that's your rights take your hands off of her take your hands off of him see faith will do it Oh my he says not annihilate it but just take your hands off of it to loose it to let it go to pass it away what's he saying he's saying we don't have strength or or power to destroy demons but we have faith to cast them off we have power to cast them off because destruction isn't until the final judgment our place is not to judge our place is to Proclaim Liberty by the Holy Ghost he says the Earth will change he says it changes the Earth will change politics Will Change the religions will change the denominations will pass away politics will pass away and the kingdom of God shall be established he said and when I see the token I'll pass over you the Holy Ghost is our token he said it's a sign it's a sign that the price has been paid that Jesus Paid the price and you received it from him holding the token in your hand you have an assurance of Resurrection for the believer today we have an assurance of rapture he says you have the assurance that everything you have need of in this journey is provided in that token of his suffering at Calvary where he met the price of Every curse that could be put on you church if the price has been paid what is the cost the cost to me and you is nothing remember brother Braham talked about he said you know it's like you go into a candy store he says and if they tell you that the store belongs to you he says I just want to go in in there and start looking and trying and tasting everything that belongs to me the price is free it's a sure thing Victory is given the promises are given we're not talking the the silliness of prosperity Doctrine and whatnot we're talking about word promises he says that token speaks peace amen he says there is no devil can stand before before it there's nothing can stand before it because God has accepted it he says and you hold the token in your hand that the price is paid he says oh it's a positive token we won't get into it today but we're going to move into the next service on the thought of the Holy Spirit as the enforcer because that's what he is he's an enforcer but he's an enforcer that works by Allah law and the law is the word of God Amen we'll look at the intention the purpose of the Holy Spirit of the indwelling of God in our lives what I'm trying to get at this morning is we don't have to live in a defeated State we don't have to live in a tormented State we don't have to live in a discontented state we don't have to live in complexes and fears and worries why because you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost you know Satan loves shame have you ever noticed Jesus constantly went to to women that were in shame to people that were in shame the first great casting out of devils was Mary Magdalene you remember and she had seven demons and he cast them out of her that was a woman that was in shame then he comes to a woman at the well and she's had five husbands and she's living common law in a time where a woman wasn't supposed to do that after she married the first time that's still the same standard today by the way but she was six times she was five times over the limit for marriages and relationships living common law in that day that that that just wasn't something you did and yet she was living common law and Christ comes to a woman living in shame a woman that has to come to the well in the middle of the day CU she can't come with the good people with the real Christians and Satan had her bound and Jesus said I have need to go by way of Samaria cuz there's a a woman in shame that'll believe me when the Holy Ghost comes in that door opens wide Maria Bethany lazarus's sister she was the woman that was caught in adultery she was the one that came and anointed his feet not the woman caught in adultery but she was a woman of of lowest State shameful after shameful person set free by the very presence of the word made flesh and Satan loves to hold us back in shame when you get the Holy Ghost there's no room for it anymore there's no room because the Holy Ghost is there to give life and Liberty to open the doors and the only one that'll keep it Clos is you and I but he's there to bring light he's there to bring joy he's there to bring peace he's there to bring rest he's there to bring Deliverance he's there to bring Victory if we'll let him do it the only thing holding the holy goes back in our lives is us the only thing can stop it in my life is me because it's still free moral agency there's still a choice there listen to this as we start to close brother Braham said the strength of the Holy Ghost lays in God's promise if you can tie back to the word of God then you can have assurance that the Holy Ghost will do the work in your life but what happens today is we try and rest the word we try and control it we try and manipulate it to do things but if you can find it in the place it's supposed to be if you can place it the way it's meant to be then the Holy Ghost can go into action in your life we're going to pick up in the next service but I want to say this that you can you don't have to stay in the condition you're in any condition you're in that would hinder your walk with God you don't have to stay in it you don't have to stay there because why he's here to restore you back to full relationship I'm not saying there's not a fight clearly there's a fight clearly there's a struggle clearly there's a battle but I'm saying that Victory is assured we have the victory because we have the mighty conqueror inside of us amen he's there to break every chain he's there to cast out every doubt he's there to heal every sickness brother said to take care of every attribute of sin when he killed the head he took care of everything beneath it everything that Satan brings against us can be met by the power of God undefeated amen as the musicians come he said when God gives you the Holy Ghost it's settled Church you know what that tells me the greatest thing you got to settle in your mind is do I have the Holy Ghost that's the only thing that matters in this life is do I have the Holy Ghost he says you know where you stand you know what happened and you're sealed all the way till the day of your Redemption he says your destination of this Earthly Journey oh my that ought to make anybody just have faith and believe God and just rise up in the power of the holy spirit amen God bless you let's stand this morning what's he saying he's saying when God gave you the Holy Ghost he gave you victory over everything that stands in your path a resurrection and a Rapture everything everything there's a reason why brother bham could stand there and say I take every Spirit under control in this room why because the holy spirit said it not a man cuz the holy spirit said I'm here to Proclaim Liberty I'm here to open prison doors I'm here to heal diseases I'm here to change lives I'm here to give you a new mind I'm here to take away your complexes I'm here to give you Victory I'm here to give you faith I'm here to give you courage to take away the trembling you know sometimes we get so psyched up in our minds about what's what's coming our way or what we're in that it just binds us and we can't move we're immobile you know there's a there's a there's snakes that what they do is they they they they catch the eye of that animal and it hypnotizes them
