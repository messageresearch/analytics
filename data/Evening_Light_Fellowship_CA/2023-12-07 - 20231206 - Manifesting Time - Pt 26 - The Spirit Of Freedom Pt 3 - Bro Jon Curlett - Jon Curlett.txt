your worship and your glory Lord to hear your words Lord so that the eyes of our understanding could come open Lord that we would see ourselves in you our position in the word Lord that we would see where you've called us Lord and everything you've done to get us there amen and Lord all you're asking us to do is just believe Lord you said if thou can't believe all things are possible Lord we're Believers Lord that's our confession that's our title and Lord we're here to believe this evening Lord we're here to take you at your word Lord we're here to lift your name we're here to thank you for your goodness and Grace Lord we're thankful Lord that Lord the work's already done Lord just help us to step into that finished work tonight Lord not just here in this building Lord but as we go home this evening Lord as we live our lives Lord may we just day by day be stepping more and more into that perfect word that you've given us Lord bless us once again tonight Lord there's many needs been mentioned Lord we pray your grace to them each one Lord minister to hearts and souls now we ask in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen God bless you turn if you would to Second Timothy chapter 1 and have a lot of announcements here tonight and I'll repeat some of them on Sunday I'm sure but we want to remember those that are traveling this weekend so brother Joe will be traveling back so want to remember him he's traveling Saturday and Sunday and then Blanc and the boys leave Saturday and they get in early early Sunday morning so remember them Jensen's been vomiting the last couple of nights so we just ask God's grace especially that that would just clear up whatever is bothering him and that it be taken care of Amen so they get back and I I'm going to ask that we move back the church service on Sunday morning move it up to 12:00 instead of 11:00 I'll be up till about 3:00 a.m. uh picking up my family so I'm trying to get some sleep before I preach amen uh I might be more like Jeremiah and that I'm the the Weeping preacher but I don't want to be the sleeping preacher Amen on Sunday morning so if we could do that just meet on noon and brother Matt if you can send an email out reminding the Church of that I'd I'd appreciate it want to remember brother Garfield I spoke to him uh this yesterday morning and he's been very very sick I sent out the email but I just wanted to remind the church amen to just really keep him in prayer I know what it's like being in school and and just the stress of exams and especially in engineering and these things like he's doing but boy when you're sick it just takes it to a whole another level so we want to remember him amen uh you know I was think even in the office there we say you know the world will say well we're we're thinking about you thinking doesn't do it empathy doesn't do a thing amen but we know a God that can change situations that can heal his body and that's that's what I'm here for amen that's what we're here for is to pray for him and trust God to do the work amen I also spoke with brother Carmen Mills so I'll be heading out to Vancouver for work on January 20th returning Lord willing January 26 so that's a Sunday and a Wednesday I'll be gone and I wasn't sure what to do or who to talk to for the Sunday service and then brother Carmen Mills texted me and I'd talk to him about coming to minister and he said hey I've sold my house that's closed so we're getting ready for the big house building project next summer but until then I'm free I've got some and he told me he was going to be traveling down to South America and then also the US so he said I'm free January or I'm free March so I said January 21st is when I'd like you if you can come up so he said absolutely so he's going to come and he's going to preach s Saturday night and he's going to preach a Sunday morning we're not going to do a full set of meetings uh brother you know brother carman's got a a full-time job and he's full-time assistant there with brother brother Carr so I said I want to be sensitive to your needs he said in your situation he says listen if the people want to we'll take two we'll do two I said the people will want two so we're going to do a Saturday night and a Sunday morning service while I'm gone and then brother Paul as usual will do his adult Sunday school on the Wednesday night so be in prayer for that amen I I told Brother Carmen I'm very disappointed to to miss I had good fellowship with him and I've seen you know the service he preached there at brother Tim pritz and that so I believe you're in for a treat and I just wish I could be here but I'm thankful that I didn't even have to ask anyone God just brought somebody their way my way and just kind of filled in while uh while I'm gone amen so want to thank the Lord for that and just trust that Amen brother Bob enjoyed the song service that was perfect uh everything we're going to mention here tonight is is in the song service so praise the Lord for that and then sister Betty on the way in told Brother Matt she says I got my blood today and I am 100% cancer free hallelujah amen thank you Lord that's what we trust amen settle for nothing less amen than total healing total Victory amen so we thank God for that amen and trusting the Lord to just continue to guard and protect her every day amen second Timothy 1: 7 now before we read this Paul says in verse 6 he tells Timothy stir up the gift of God which is in thee now we're not all preachers like Timothy was but each one of us has the gift of the holy spirit inside of us and that's really what Paul's talking about because he says in verse 7 he says what stir up the gift that is within thee by the laying on of hands that's his preaching but he says what's behind that is what's really the gift he says for God had not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a A sound mind amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening and as you can imagine we're continuing on our Series in manifesting time and I'm going to take a third service on this thought of the spirit of freedom and I don't know if we're going to do another one but we'll see where we go but I have to say I've been enjoying this amen I I just I was studying on Monday and I just started crying just it's so beautiful what we have this message we've been given this this open word that we have you know we've we've got an open book book before us and it's got our names in it and God's calling our names and he's telling us who we are and he's telling us what he's provided for us and sometimes it's just overwhelming it's just overwhelming when we see the goodness of God and what he's done for us and what he's given us amen but you know sometimes we don't see the change but let me say whether we see it or not we're changing amen the scripture says we're changing from glory to glory amen he's building us up bit by bit and sometimes it takes a long time and then you look back and you realize he's been working on me amen and if he's been working on you he's going to keep working on you amen and that's really where our trust is and I was reading in my devotions in a Monday in Deuteronomy and I read the scripture that told them not to remove the landmarks and I want to read it this morning or this evening because it struck me how we've lost some landmarks today Deuteronomy 19:14 says Thou shalt not remove thy neighbor's Landmark which they of old time have set in thine inheritance which Thou shalt inherit in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee to possess it you know we spoke last service on Samson and how he got in trouble when he went looking into the land of the Philistines but here's the thing philistia belonged to Samson they' conquered it once already and then they got out of the word they got away from the love of God they got away from the things of God and the Philistines came in and they took it back but it really belonged to Samson but what happened is the Philistines went in and they removed the ancient landmarks that said this is the land of the Israelites this belongs to a child of God this belongs to a child of Israel and they've removed them out and they've forgotten that that lands were supposed to belong to them amen the the the the the landmarks that proved that this belonged to the children of Israel were long gone and so they would sit there and they would look at it and they wouldn't remember that belongs to me and many of them had a a personal position a personal place a possession in that land and they never had it because the Philistines had taken it back amen I believe Satan has moved the landmarks he's come in and he's he he's gotten on our land and he's taken these things and he's he he said they belong to me but I'll tell you God sent a prophet to restore the ancient landmarks and they open and full word of God and he's come and he's told us this belongs to you and he would say time and time again take it back take it back amen and I believe we're here tonight to say Satan give it back amen give us back what belongs to us not because we have something good or that that we've determined it but because God has told us in his word this belongs to you amen and I believe that's what we're doing here and that means we've got to commit to the battle amen we've got to commit to sticking it through we've got to commit to pressing for these things amen we've got to commit to trusting God and knowing that he'll do what he said he would do amen I want to talk a bit tonight as you can imagine maybe from our scripture I want to take a thought on fear and we're talking about the spirit of freedom but I want to talk about the weapon that Satan brings and it's fear and brother Bram actually preaches a message called the power of the devil and he speaks about this fear but I'm reminded of brother ER V NOA some of you might know him he was a a real talker and he was a minister at brother Ed bisc church for a long time and he actually gave uh uh message tapes and books to uh to Benny Hinn he was a close personal friend of Benny Hinn he comes from a Pentecostal background and a charismatic background but this is what brother Ernie V NOA always said about fear he said fear is false evidence appearing real amen so Satan's goal is to magnify reality beyond what it is to make you think that you can't defeat or you can't go through the situation or you can't overcome what's in front of you amen Satan's goal is to make it so big and so bad that he defeats Us by keeping us from even starting the fight in the first place if he can defeat you before you get started then he's won the battle hasn't he amen so he tries and he tries to blow it up and he tries to magnify it and it reminds me of in the scripture when the the the the 12 uh spies came back and Caleb and Joshua gave a wonderful report but the 10 of them said we are as grasshoppers in their eyes Satan wants you thinking you're a grasshopper in the eyes of himself and in the eyes of the the the demons that are on his side amen but God is here to restore us back to our position and say greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world you are more than able to conquer them amen as as J as as Joshua and Caleb said now when I was looking at fear you know fear has a natural purpose and its purpose is to help us make life-saving decisions you're supposed to have fear and fear is not supposed to paralyze you but fear is supposed to make you watch what you're doing so that you don't cause unnecessary harm and and and in an extreme case that you don't lose your life it's supposed to be based on reality it's supposed to be based on experience and it's supposed to be based on understanding but what happens so often is that our experiences are not what we think we are they are and so they magnify the danger they magnify the issue and it paralyzes us when we come into those situations again or it will project fear into a situation where it doesn't really need to be think of it as as children and you know brother Brandon remember you had that woman that came up and she had all these issues and he he went into her life and he says this all goes back to a time when a dog scared you fear had overtaken her life and all she needed was that fear to be exposed and then all of a sudden she was made well but it took a prophit to do that amen that the fear in her life was controlling her and keeping her from a victory that was needed inside of her body body amen if I was a young boy and I got hit while Cross by a car while crossing the street let me tell you I'd have a fear of crossing the road every time I had to cross the road and it maybe would come to the point where I would not cross a road and I'd be bound by my fear of crossing a road and yet day after day people thousands millions of people cross the road every day and they're not fearful about it and they don't get hit by a car but because I have one bad experience that fear holds me back from doing something that I ought to be capable of doing which is crossing a road and not getting hit by a car am man fear is supposed to moderate our approach it's not supposed to paralyze Us in its proper context What Fear will do is make me look before I cross the road but it won't keep me from crossing the road but Satan's trying to keep us from Crossing roads he's trying to keep us from moving forward in these things and that kind of fear has no place in a Believer if you are paralyzed by fear that is absolutely demonic influence inside of your life and that does not belong there and it takes the power of the Holy Ghost to move those things out as I was looking in that scripture I want to look at the Amplified here he says he's not given us a spirit of fear but he's given us a spirit of power of love and of a sound mind in the Amplified says for God did not give us a spirit of timidity you know what's timid babies and things that get eaten if you look in the animal world the things that are at the lowest part of the food chain are the most timid because they have no defense mechanism he says he's not given us a spirit of timidity he says of coward of craving and cringing and fawning fear you don't have to pull back you don't have to bow down you don't have to pull away from anything that Satan throws at you he says but he has given us a spirit of power and of love and of calm and well balanced mind and discipline and self-control so when we look at this we've been preaching on Divine love we've been preaching on charity and this all fits on under the window of Charity because charity is the Holy Ghost and here timoth what Paul is saying to Timothy is he's saying the holy spirit is a spirit of power it's a spirit of love and it's a spirit of a sound mind amen if you got the Holy Ghost then you're supposed to have power you're supposed to have love and you're supposed to have a sound mind in your day-to-day walk with God Amen it's supposed to settle us down so that Satan can't spook us he can't get us running he can't get us reacting he can't get us panicking God says fear not time After Time After Time in the Scriptures it seems like every time God comes with a message or God comes with a decree or God comes with a direction the first thing he says is fear not why because we're inclined to fear since the fall the first thing that happened as soon as Adam and Eve sinned was they got fear they got afraid if you remember but he says no when I come don't be scared because I'm here to take you out of fear I'm not to put fear inside of you there's a fear for God there's a respect of God but that's not what we're talking about we're talking about something that causes you to pull back to bow down to let something have its way in your life amen but every time God comes he says fear not it's tied to an explanation it's tied to a command or it's tied to his attributes that's so three things that you'll see most common and what is it it's God saying it's okay I'm here to help you through this situation and he says fear not so he can do two things he can get people to stop doing what they ought not to be doing or to start doing what they ought to be doing he's trying to get you to stop from going into danger or he's trying to get you to press into the promises amen we see one of the biggest fear not moments in the scripture and it's right as they're about to go into Canaan because remember they came into they came up to the border of Canaan and they feared and they wouldn't listen to the testimony and they wouldn't listen to Moses and they wouldn't listen to God and they pull back and God Ran them around the desert for 40 years but then he comes into the book of Deuteronomy and he's reminding them you've got a place to go and now it's not a time to turn back you've got to in and you got to take hold of This Promise he says you've got to go somewhere you've never gone before and that's why I'm here to lead you but you got to go you can't stay here it's time to go into the promise and it's a spirit of power that's coming to the Forefront here so in Deuteronomy one it says behold the Lord thy God has set the L before thee what's in front of you is by God's decision by God's ordination he says go up and possess it as the Lord God of thy fathers has said unto thee he says fear not neither be discouraged God's trying to build them up God's trying to pump them up to go into the promised land brother brandom says this he says we ought to be free he says if we study the word and believe the word give us room he's sure let's get out and get moving let's start exercising our faith let's do something with what God has given us if we believe it if we've got it then let's do something with it brother R would put it this way he says the first thing you know you get to petting your sickness around petting your little pettiness around and things like that because your neighbor doesn't believe in healing your neighbor doesn't believe in the Holy Ghost he says destroy the thing let's go over and take the land Hallelujah God said it's ours if he said it's ours if he said it's ours it belongs to us the promise is unto you and to your children and to your children's children as many as the Lord Our God shall call amen that's what the matter with the church tonight we got a wishbone instead of a backbone he says what we need is something in there that'll stand you up amen he says every man that ever amounted to a hill of beans had to fight for what he got God don't give it to you on a silver platter he said there's the promised land she's flowing with milk and honey but before you get there you're going to go through all these hivites and Canaanites and everything but don't you bow down to one of them remember last last service brother R said you don't have to knuckle down to to the devil you don't have to knuckle down to Satan you don't have to bow down before anything he says you destroy the things as you come to them scripture says sufficient to the day is the evil thereof don't be all worried about what tomorrow holds deal with what's in front of you today cuz that's the one that God has ordained for you to destroy today don't get worked up about the future why fear will magnify it focus on what's in front of you today he says destroy it as you come to them stop building a fire on the enemy's altar amen what is it the first step is always the hardest the first step and and every believer here knows that I know it you know the first time you step out on the word of God it's on faith and faith alone there's nothing to show you that it's right there's nothing to prove to you that it's right it's something in your heart that God has anchored and you step out and you say I believe it and then you act on it but the first step is always the hardest it's always the hardest and the question is what what if he doesn't answer what if he doesn't respond what if he doesn't do it what is it it's Satan putting fear on you to try and offset the faith that's inside of you by the Holy Spirit quickening the word here's the thing it's just as reasonable to say what if if he does but Satan will focus on us what if he doesn't but we ought to be thinking if we're rational creatures what if he does what if he does what he says but Satan's there and we've got an adversary that's playing with our mind to try and twist it so that a spirit of power and a sound mind can't work to get us focused on what if he doesn't church I'm here to tell you what if he does not what if he does but he will he said he would he's going to do it amen amen what is it Satan's trying to get our mind close to the idea that there is still the same God here today there's the same Holy Ghost here today that was in a prophet's Ministry in 70 years ago and in Christ's Ministry in the apostles 2,000 years ago the same Holy Ghost is here today to Quicken the word to us and to do the same Works in our lives brother brandom says the first you know really the first step is just a little out of your reach he says we have to accept it by faith it's just a little more more than the human mind can explain you can't explain God if you do then he's no more accepted by faith you have to believe him he that cometh to God must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek after him then he says in the message of the great Shining Light he says but it gives us consolation to know this that we do not hold our destiny that doesn't mean the path is not influenced by us cuz our choice every day deter what the road looks like but our destiny the Finish point is already determined for every Son of God you're already there it's done it's a finished work like I prayed about Lord help us to step into the revelation of a finished work that'll keep you going when time gets tough that'll keep you going when things are are when you're sick when the finances aren't so good when things are falling apart it's a finished work it's already done it's already done and all I'm doing is walk walking through a finished film man I like what brother Hank said to me the film's already done I just got to walk through it he says god holds our destiny we don't hold our destiny god holds our destiny and he has ordained it to be so and there is nothing that's an absolute there is nothing will ever interrupt the program of God we are bound to arrive you're bound to arrive he says then there was to be no fear he's talking about Mary and Joseph he says now Mary be Mary and Joseph themselves just common people not educated they didn't have the way of knowing these things that they were taking place right at that time was fulfilling the scriptures and it's the same today the things are taking place right in this day that we live in and many of us know nothing about it how God is moving but oh to see in this dark enveloping out time God's Great hand moves steadily on nothing shall stop it remember we walk by faith and not by sight just CU You Don't See see it doesn't mean it's not happening just cuz you don't hear it doesn't mean it's not being spoken just cuz you don't know it doesn't mean it's not being done God is moving his great hand moves steadily on I was talking to a minister recently about some things that are going on in this church and I said you know what we're praying and we're believing and things are starting to happen and it's starting to become matter of fact it's starting to become matter of fact I believe that with all my heart when I pray I believe what we pray for is going to happen that the need is going to be met not always the way we prayed for it amen but the need is going to be met one way or the other God moves on behalf of his children every single time that's just the way it is amen and I believe that's what's going to be happening as we move closer and closer to this Rapture is that we're going to get focused on the will of God we're going to get focused on the word of God we're going to get in the anointing of the Holy SP Spirit to catch what God wants done and we're going to start calling for it in a greater and a greater way amen that as we come closer to that the things of this world will grow strangely dim you I was thinking the other day if you look in a light and you look in a light for long enough if you close your eyes and go in a dark room you know what you can still see light cuz it's burned into your eyeballs and I was thinking if we could look at this word that much if we could look and look and read and read and absorb and eat and feed and feed it didn't matter how dark it got how quiet it got or how loud it got how alone it got when we closed our eyes this would be coming out and no matter what all we could see was the light of God's word making a way through every trial and every situation that we're dealing with Hallelujah if we could just get their Church where everything everything is focused on that great word that he's given us us he's given it to us it's the answer it says he sent his word to heal our diseases amen the spirit of Truth is here to make it alive to Quicken it in each each and every one of our Lives it's God moving in his people you know how I know it's happening not just in my life and yours because I see what you're praying for I see what you're asking for I see what you come up for prayer for and it shows that faith is rising that we're asking for things we've never had the courage to ask for we've never had the faith to ask for before and it shows that God is moving in his word amen you know the first time I prayed for someone as a minister it was an experience because you know what I am no different from you and people will ask you to pray for the most impossible things currently speaking the most impossible things and you sit there and you say how in the world am I going to pray for that well let me tell you when God called me to minister he called me to pray and he called me to pray effectively amen he called me to pray for sicknesses he called me to cast out demons he called me to pray to change situations that's the calling of a minister is not to just preach it in these notes but to preach it by a living gospel by the power of the Holy Ghost amen and let me tell you the first time I prayed and every time since then I've got to trust that his calling and his choosing puts me in a position to pray the way that he he needs me to pray for his people but it's not just for me how many times would brother brandham say he'd say lay your hand on the person next to you he says it's in you it's in you whether you're a mother whether you're a wife whether you're a husband whether you're a father whether you're single whether you're rich whether you're poor whether you're fat whether you're skinny it don't matter if you are a child of God God is calling you to pray and call on the things that he's given for his family each and every one of us is supposed to have that amen you know when I pray I I I I quiver because it's the the Holy Spirit that's there to take care of the situation it's not me sometimes I can barely talk because it's his presence that makes the difference it's nothing about me it's nothing about me but church we are ordained husbands you are ordained to take control of your families of your households of the atmosphere that's around there you are ordained to do it mothers you have the same authority over your children each and every one of you by the power of the Holy Ghost if you are a born again believer you ought to have a ought to have a confidence in the power that God has placed in you the authority he's given you by the holy spirit amen as a minister I had to find faith and I had to trust and I had to rest that God had called me to do this but it takes faith it takes Faith No Matter What Amen brother Bram says this he says I used to often time wonder what's the matter with the Christian Church they're so scared of things we're talking about fear he says why you got nothing to be scared about the first word nearly Jesus said after the resurrection fear not see don't fear don't get scared there ain't nothing going to happen nothing can happen nothing can bother a Christian you say things happen yes but nothing can change who you are nothing can change what you are nothing can change your destination nothing can change your purpose nothing can change what God has planned for you amen not even death itself can even touch the Christian he that heareth my words and believeth on him that has sent me have the everlasting life shall not come into condemnation but has passed from Death to life amen death itself has no Reign Over a Christian because Christ died in our stead amen he says what faith ought to do ought to build up in the people is something that'll tow the mark now we don't know what that means anymore but way back in in the in the early days the 16 17 1800s when they did boxing they didn't put as brother B said pillows on their on their fists and go in a nice marked out ring what they' do is they'd have people stand around in a in an area around a just a marked off area and then if there the two combatants the two boxers would come in and what they'd do is they' just Mark a line in the dirt and to start the match both of you had to come up and put your feet on the line you had to tow the line and as soon as your toe was there and his toe was there now you could fight and the and the they today they have you know they got 2 3 minutes for for a round back then the round lasted until somebody got knocked down and then when you got knocked down you chose whether you wanted to continue or not and if you wanted to continue then you had to come up you had to stand up and you had to tow the line again and go face to face with your with your combatant the opponent and it went and went until somebody couldn't tow the line you had to be tough back then cuz you got beaten until you couldn't stand up if you got knocked out you could still get up and to the line they'd throw water on you and say do you want to continue today no no if you get knocked down three times you're done no there you went until you couldn't tow the line brother Braham says we need something in us a faith that'll make us tow the line no matter how many times we get knocked down no matter how many things we go through we keep coming up and saying I'm still in this fight he says you'll get never get nothing by being a little jellyfish Christian no sir do you ever see a jellyfish you just hit them he splatters all over everything see a jellyfish you know what usually eats them the crabs and things along the side by the seashore comes up with his pincher and cuts him in two and takes him down cuz the jellyfish just lays there he says brother we need some Christians not jellyfish but with a backbone that'll stand he says oh I don't mean to fuss with people but stand for your god-given rights that Christ died for there's a price paid let's take it he says certainly not pushed around we don't have to be no sir he says we've got an inheritance and our inheritance belongs to us it's your privilege to have anything that you inherited through accepting Jesus Christ and dying to yourself he says how marvelous yes sir Satan said well I'll tell you what I'm going to do he says no you ain't going to do nothing that's the way to talk back to him we've got to stand up enough's enough you've talked enough remember the story of sister barns you've been talking for a long time now let me start talking back to you he says that's way to talk back to him say I know my position in Christ and you just might as well get away I ain't listening to you no more I've got an inheritance you got to know that you're a son and daughter of God that's why you need to read your Bible and pray every day that's why you need to spend time with God every day that's why you need to be in a spirit of worship every day is to keep reminding us because we're forgetful hearers and we're walking through a dirty world that's trying to remind us or trying to make us think we ain't children of God that we're just like them and because we're just like them we got to put up with the same things they do we don't have to put up with it we're children of God we're on a different set of privileges he says and we got a tital deed to it an abstract that goes all the way back to Calvary the day of Pentecost when he said this promises unto you to your children and them that's a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call an abstract deed clear all the way back to Pentecost how far does it go back and how many is it for as many as the Lord will call if the Lord calls you he gives you an abstract title all the way back now we don't really know that that title that that that phrase Abstract title but an abstract title d means it's been checked and it's been cleared and nobody has any leens to it nobody has any rights to it there's no debts owed on it it's free and clear and it belongs to the person that has the abstract title deed and he says when you are born again God gives you the Holy Spirit you have a tital deed to every promise in the word of God you have a tital deed in your name for every promise of God it belongs to you he said and the blood of Jesus Christ is just as good as it would have been shed 10 minutes ago it said every believer it's your profession are you going to use it are you going to use it he says you're just scared to use your rights that's all imagine this he he gives a situation he says when you go home tonight you Christians respectable people that's here sitting a big bunch of drugs drunks and things have moved in and taken over your house and say well what about this looky here they say this is a house isn't it yes well it's made for human beings isn't it yes well I'm a human being and I have a right to be here well you don't have a right to be there he says why cuz that's my house I've got a title theed to that that's my property I pay the taxes on it it's mine yes you have a right to be somewhere but you don't have a right to be here this is mine what's he saying you're meant to have a spirit inside of you but not any Spirit the holy spirit so any other spirit that comes you can say you don't have a right to be here CU I've already got the spirit that's supposed to be in this house it's already full take a hike go someplace else he says but you don't have a right to be there we don't believe in that kind of carrying on well he said I'm not going to get out he says well there's a law down here that says that he will get out as long as you can prove it's your house is that right Satan said now I'm going to take you prematurely I'm going to do this no you're not we got a title to this property of ours that's right we got an attorney sitting in glory with a blood sacrifice of his own life not only that but we got an FBI agent the Holy Spirit God's Great detective just leave the blood there and serve that warrant on him and watch the Holy Ghost put him out amen there you are it's yours whosoever will will let him come he says oh it's marvelous what's he saying Church he's saying he tries to put fear in you put the fear back where it belongs give it back to its originator remember the origin of fear is Satan it's sin it's unbelief it's a knowledge of your condition is the original fear because remember as soon as they knew that they had sinned the presence of God which they'd enjoyed for who knows how many how many years they hid from it why because they were afraid why of their condition they were scared that their condition was going to keep them out of acceptance from God that's the fear that Satan puts on us is about our condition so many times he says here's what you are here's what you have here's what you said here's what you did or here's what you didn't say and didn't do and you should have said and did right he gets us worried about our condition our faults and our failures and he's trying to keep you out of the word of God and he's trying to keep you out of the presence of God because he gets us thinking you got to be perfect to come into the presence of God that's not it our Perfection is not in ourselves our Perfection is in a perfect sacrifice it's under the blood that we are perfect not in ourselves Satan says you're not worthy let's look at what the word says where where are we at tonight listen we're believers but we aren't always feeling like we're in Heavenly places sometimes we feel like we're in a bit of a personal hell If we're honest it just seems like things have built up and built up and we listen I disappoint myself and if myself at times and if I disappoint me I know I disappoint God and sometimes we can get so caught up in our own disappointments that we say I can't even find him done too much gone too far can't get back to him let's read what the scripture says about where his Spirit can go David saidh shall I go from thy Spirit or whether shall I free from thy presence he says where can I get away from your spirit and how can I get away from you Lord he said if I Ascend up into heaven Thou Art there praise the Lord Brother John but what about the next part he says if I make my bed in hell behold Thou Art there that's contrary to what our Humanity wants to think when I get down and out when I mess up when I make mistakes he's not there no no it says you're still there if I make my bed in hell your spirit is still there to call me out to bring me out when we're feeling completely unworthy we're supposed to be in Heavenly places but sometimes our feeling is more like we're in hellish places he says even there he says Thou Art there he says if I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea even there there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me you can't get anywhere from the presence of God as a child of God it comes looking for you it comes wooing you it comes pulling sometimes it comes with a paddle but it comes as a child of God he always comes looking for you he comes getting you he draws you back to where you left him amen there's always a rope that's tied to us and it's our predestination I like what brother Steven stru says he says predestination is the rope that keeps bringing you back to God Amen back in in Eden after they sinned and they got afraid and they disbelieved there was angels that were guarding the presence of God and they guarded Christ with a sword to keep us back but ever since Calvary the Angels you'll notice have been trying to bring us back to him see in the old days only one man a year could go in one day a year into the presence of God into the holy of holies and that was the high priest one man year and he went in for himself with the blood and then when God covered his sins then he went in with the blood for the covering of the people then when he came out they knew that they were they was atoned for for another year only one man got to go into the Shina presence but after Calvary what happened the veil is torn and now every angel in heaven is trying to push us into the presence of God because it was death to go in before now it's death if we stay out brother brandom said everything that this word is trying to do is bring us to the presence of God to refuse its death to accept it his life talking about our condition that Satan uses against US 1 John 3 says this and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him for if our hearts condemn us God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things anybody's heart ever condemn him you don't have to raise your hand mine's condemned me many times if your heart condemns you he says God's greater than that the Amplified says whenever our hearts in tormenting self- accusation and makes us feel guilty and condemns us he says he reminds us we are in God's hands he says for he is above and greater than our consciences our hearts and he knows he perceives and understands everything he says nothing is hidden from him there's a remedy and the remedy is confession and repentance repentance means go the other way turn back to right and when you do that now you got to path back to where you need to be then we can move to verse 21 verse 21 says beloved if our heart condemn us not take care of your heart take care of the condemnation that's there because as soon as that's done now you can move back towards God he says then we have confidence towards God and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his Commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight anybody ever pray and you know things aren't right between you and God four of us I know I'm not asking you to raise your hands but you know when you pray ain't nothing going to happen right when you know you got to make something right you know I'm praying because I'm a Christian and that's what we do but you know for a fact ain't God God ain't hearing your prayer because there's a barrier between you and him and you got to confess your sin and put it under the blood you got to make it right otherwise the ceiling is like brass and it's just bouncing off and you're just doing this by rot you're doing it by by by habit and God ain't listening to you because you know better and you got to make it right it's that simple and as soon as you make it right condemnation lifts from your heart listen we ain't Catholic we don't have to go around beating ourselves up I did this I did that I didn't do this I didn't do that and we got to make ourselves miserable for 12 days no when and I'm a testament to this by God's grace I can say this with all my heart it's true true when I lay it before him it's done and I can move on as if I never did it brother Adam talked about I have no more conscience of sin I know what that means that when you lay it under the blood it's as if you never did it and it doesn't bother me one lick you're torn up until that point but you do it and you say Lord help me not to do it again and you go on in newness as if you never did it in the first place because he doesn't see you do it I've said this before you say God I did it again he says did what again he can't even remember you did it ever before it's new every time and it's forgotten every single time amen I look at this and I say church it's time to make Satan feel nervous we're supposed to have confidence and if we're confident that means somebody else is supposed to get nervous I say church it's time to start making Satan nervous amen it's time to be confident towards God like what's written here if our hearts don't condemn us then let's be confident toward towards God get your eyes off yourself get your eyes on the word and start being confident because this Spirit of power working in a bride it makes Satan very very nervous it did in Canaan and it's going to do it again this time remember what he said in Deuteronomy he says there shall be no man a be able to stand before you for the Lord your God shall lay the fear of who you lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that you shall tread upon as he has said unto you that's the spirit of power in a believer's life is it puts fear in Satan's kingdom because they know they're going to have to move very very soon they know things can't stay the way they are because Powers come in their way and it's in a bride that's anointed to do these things brother brah says it this way he says there's only two elements you can be controlled by that is either Faith or doubt a fear he says will accompany doubt if if you're fearing it's because you don't believe you don't believe as much as you ought to maybe I'll put it that way you've got more doubt than you've got faith and therefore fear can be in there Jesus said fear not Don't Be Afraid God keeps his word no matter what condition you are tonight God keeps his word Satan says you don't deserve it your condition ain't right you know what he's right but he's irrelevant Satan says a lot of things that don't matter there right but they don't matter we're in an unconditional Covenant Church you know what that means where you're at doesn't matter what you are in your flesh doesn't matter because he swore by himself cuz he could swear by no greater and he says I've got a bride and she is spotless she's without wrinkle she's my body she's my bone she's my flesh she is me and I am her that's what he said about about us Satan will say a lot of things about this flesh that are 100% true but they're Irrelevant in the word they're irrelevant when we look at Christ and the position he's put us in what's he doing he's trying to magnify us so we don't look at the Magnificent one the Savior the champion the Lord of Lord the King of Kings the Healer the deliverer that's what he's trying to get our eyes off of he's trying to say look at you and the scripture says our confidence is not in us our confidence is towards God Amen that's where we're resting I like what a brother said one time he said when a Christian wakes up in the morning every demon in Hell ought to be sounding alarms and saying look out they're awake Church we've been anointed to make life a living hell for demons that we would be so they would be so frustrated with us that they would say you take morine I'm sick and tired I can barely move she's got me black and blue you do it for a while her feet just hit the floor look out and not just our older ones but our younger ones as well that when they get up and they say we're going to try and put the world in front of them we're going to try and put fashion in front of them we're going to put worldly relationships in front of them we're going to try and throw rock and roll at them we're going to try and throw clothes at them they say you try it I've been trying it it ain't working I'm sick and tired I want an easier Target they ought to be frustrated with us the way we are frustrated with Satan so many times that's what we're meant to do we're meant to frustrate the kingdom of Satan that's our place brother Braham says this what we need today is a good oldfashioned Holy Ghost Revival to sweep the country to fill the people full of the vitamins of God's word where they'll know where they're standing and no know where they're standing and no you know that you know that you know it's a settled thing he says taking the fear out of the church now the people where we know that by Grace We're saved and we're filled with the Holy Spirit and sealed to the day of redemption yes sir it takes all the fear out Church we're not talking about a pep talk pep talks are good for the moment but they don't last we've got to have solid word-based preaching that lets you know where your foundation is so you know that you're standing on a place that you get to you get to hold that it belongs to you if it's word based that'll do it but if I get up here and I get you all rah rah R up that ain't going to hold cuz that's just the words of a man there could be an anointing here but that's not going to hold you if you don't have a resting place in the word of God pep talks are no good pep talks won't drive the fear out knowing who you are and where you stand will drive the fear out knowing you're a child of God filled with the Holy Ghost that's what's going to take it out brother BR says this he says When Faith takes a hold fear drops away I love this line he says Faith's got big muscles and a hairy chest he says when it speaks everything else keeps quiet cancer has to shut up Sister Sister Betty doesn't it cancer has to shut up praise the Lord he says and get out of the way tumor tuberculosis the rest of them moves out when Faith raises up and says set down that settles it the power of the devil sure he has the power and the reign of death but the second power that was given was faith and Faith put put Satan to shame he says certainly it does oh if we could only accumulate that kind of Faith tonight get that kind of Faith living amongst us mainly moving in our beings moving through the church now watch what he says not just the emotional Faith there's an emotional faith and it can only do so much it's still Faith but he says what not just the emotional Faith but a real Solid Faith what does that look like brother brandham a real real Solid Faith that won't take no for an answer he says know that God said so and that settles it what be perseverant there's power in perseverance to say I will not let you go until you bless me like Jacob did that you hold on and you hold on and you hold on until he does what he said he was going to do not an emotional Faith but a real Solid Faith that won't take no for an answer now that's where we start to transfer over now to the power of a sound mind now generally speaking when fear comes it it comes from looking at two things looking at yourself or looking at the situation or putting the two of them together now we get fearful because we know we aren't able to manage or control situations certainly when it involves people I can't I can't force you to do anything I can't force you to be anything I can't force you to respond a certain way and so we look look at things and we know we're not up to the task it's either out of our hands or it's too much to handle if we do have it in our hands Satan gets us looking at how poorly we handled it the last time he gets us looking at the personalities involved he gets us looking at the the the the the the the things that we've gone through in the past and he'll pull up every negative aspect of the of our past performance and say you can't handle it and you know what he's right but he's irrelevant but if he can't get you looking at yourself then he'll get you focused on the situation itself and he'll look at the impossibilities and the twists and the turns and the complexities and the years of history and the personalities and you know how they are and it ain't never change and they ain't never going to change sometimes we need to change but in it all he'll make you fearful that you can't sort it out and it'll just keep going the way it's always been going and then he'll take the two of them together and we'll compare our inability to the horribleness of the situation or the greatness required to get out of it and that causes us to worry and fear and stress and all of a sudden it takes the health right out of us stress is a killer we're going to read a quote where brother B talks about stress and worry it's a killer he says it's the greatest killer we've got but God has a remedy amen and it's the power of a sound mind now listen to this list in Isaiah 41 he says fear thou not for I am with thee what's he doing look to me I'm with you don't be scared cuz it's you be don't be scared cuz it's with it's me that's with you he says be not dismayed for I am thy God church is he God or is he thy God there's a difference yeah I saw a um there's a a well-known us female soccer player she is uh alternate lifestyle she def definitely doesn't believe in God but she had a uh a press conference the other day and she said if there is a she she said if there is any doubt there isn't a God she says what happened to me in my final game is proof that there isn't a God cuz she was in her last game before she retired and a couple minutes in she got a a uh career- ending injury so she didn't get to really play and she said that's proof there's God as if God would only do something good for her and that's the only way she believe in a god a woman that is Antichrist in every aspect effect of her life and then she says because God didn't do what God should have done that's proof that there isn't a god at all why he's just God to her but he's my God and he's your God and that's the way he's got to be he's got to you got to be able to say he's my Lord we sing that song He's My Lord there is no other one he's got to be your Lord you got to be able to say Lord you are my God and I'm coming to you because you're mine he says for I am thy God I will strengthen thee strengthen y I will help thee y I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness now I read that word be not dismayed and and I looked it up in the dictionary and dismay means to cause to feel consternation or distress to worry or to be alarmed and that's our definition today that's the modern definition but when you go into the scripture and see what they actually mean there that word dismay means to look at to regard to gaze at or to look around so what's God saying he's saying don't look around talking about the SP Spirit of a of a sound mind he says don't look at what you can see because everything that the Israelites faced everything the Jews faced was greater than them bigger more powerful uh more money whatever you want to talk about every time they're going into these things what they looked at was greater than what they had or what they were or what they brought to the table amen what what does that mean don't be a looker be a believer amen it's not what you can see that you can defeat it's what you believe you can defeat amen where would say it's not the size of the dog and the fight it's the size of the fight and the dog you got to recognize that there's someone inside of you that's really doing the fight and he's the one that's greater than whatever you're facing no one got anywhere with God by looking at natural things you can't show me a single person in the scripture that ever said oh yeah there's something natural that's going to bring me closer to God in the sense of it brought them to a place of Faith No they believed and then God followed they believed and then God did the work nobody's looking around saying oh yeah that proves God therefore I'm going to no no no they believe God and then God came behind and Vindicated his word but we need to turn our scriptural Eyes On Jesus amen look full in his wonderful face and the things of this world will grow strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace brother BR or the scripture says this thou wil keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee why because he trusteth in thee Isaiah 59 behold the Lord's hand is not shortened that it cannot save neither his ear heavy that it cannot hear in other words God hasn't changed God hasn't lost power God hasn't lost ability what's he saying is is you need you think somebody's so far gone that God can't reach all the way down he says God's arm's not so short it can't get there what he's done for others he can do for them his ear is not closed as long as the bride here there's Mercy as long as the bride is here there's blood to cover a multitude of sins everything is still available to people today I don't understand these people that preach that The Mercy Seat is closed I don't understand it because if they are we're all lost we need the blood of Jesus Christ every single day and if The Mercy Seat is closed then we don't have the blood to cover us he says it's not shorten that it cannot save neither is ears heavy that it cannot hear Brother Braham says it this way as long and as long as there is an eternity Christ will ever be the Savior and the way out of every problem every difference every trial everything you tell me what fits doesn't fit inside of that church he'll always be the Savior the way out of every problem every difference we get differences amongst us don't we he says of every trial and everything and therefore we when we are tied to him we don't get flustered and all worked up like all the world does but oh what will we do about this and what will we do about that we seem as if we're not even anchored but a man who has anchored his soul into Christ Jesus his trust is there knowing that when he asks the father anything in his name Jesus said I'll do it that said settles it it's the amen it's the absolute it's the ultimate when Jesus said ask the father anything in my name I'll Grant it he says now that's an ultimate that's it whatever you have need of When you pray what do you do believe believe that you receive it you shall have it that settles it that's all of it see if we're really anchored and believe it and we've made him our absolute there's the if and again if we really if we're really anchored and we believe it and we've made him our absolute cuz he does he is the absolute that takes us from all fear there's no fear when you're really tied to the Rock of Ages and when a man can pray the prayer of faith and anchor his soul Yonder in the word of God where all heavens and earth will pass away but that word cannot there is no fear let them come say whatever they want to our faith is in God and God Alone we believe it Church where's our anchor this morning we sang about it in service is our anchor in Christ the word you know he he says you've got to make him your absolute how do you know what your absolute is it's your first stop not your last stop it's the first place you go not the last place you go it's your source of help in a time of trouble it's your source of knowledge of direction of understanding it is everything you need is there and that's where you go you know he's your absolute when that's where you're going first off you don't go talk to a preacher you don't go talk to a Believer you go into the word of God and you pray before him and you say Lord You're my absolute show me your will and way because he's got the answer he's got the answer every single time when he's your absolute we go to him first brother B says you got to get away from your your own thoughts we're talking about the power of a sound mind that means my thoughts are not part of a sound mind he says you got to let the mind that was in Christ be in you you've got to stay there Watch What Happens now when we have a sound mind the mind of Christ till every sin of fear every sin of Doubt has gone from your heart and if you're there and God doesn't take you and omit your sins and send you into the presence of God he says there is something wrong with your experience now here's the thing remember I think it was job said that which I feared has come upon me sometimes we dwell on things that are going to cause us to fear and we got to get back what in the presence of God that's what this tells me we got to get in the presence of God when we're in fear when we're in worry when we're in stress we got to get to where he is because that's where that will get taken away the power of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives is there to take us away get us in this presence of God get us in a spirit of worship get us in a spirit of Praise get us in a spirit of Thanksgiving get us in a spirit of expectation get us set up to receive what he's got coming our way because our attitude will hold it back our our approach to these things amen if we can create an atmosphere of Faith where the the the spirit of God can nurture us and and grow us and mature us and get us ready for what he wants us to do or what he has for us it'll make a difference amen put on a sermon put on some worshipful music listen to this now not entertaining music as Believers we can have entertaining music and there ain't nothing wrong with it but it won't take you into the presence of God some songs are wonderful and the music's great and the vocals are great but it won't take you into the presence of God it's amazing it's beautiful but it ain't true worship but can I say something else brother Steve Bron said this and it stuck with me way back when he said don't go for melancholy music either you know why because Melancholy music affirms you where you are rather than takes you to where you need to be what it does melancholy music is empathetic empathetic rather than Victorious it says you're right to feel this way that's not going to help you you need to get out of where you're at you need music that'll take you out of that that means you got to get worship that'll that that'll lift you up that'll take you into the presence of God that'll remind you what God has said about you what God has done for you amen was it was it Watchman KNE that that that did that book practicing the presence of God something like that I don't know if it was Watchman KN but I think we need to start practicing the presence of God even the prophet remember had to call a musician to get into the presence of God sometimes he was so angry I think it was Jehoshaphat again wasn't it went down and they he ended up telling them you have to dig ditches and that you'll get the water you need and these different things but he was flustered he was flustered he was angry he was disappointed and so he said call a Minstrel and then after the minstrel came after the musician came and played a while it calmed the prophet down to where he could actually hear the voice of God because otherwise you know what would have happened Church he'd have presumed and he'd have probably spoke judgment rather than the will of God you know what happens sometimes is we walk we try and walk into the presence of God flustered and stressed and worried and we need to actually set ourselves in an atmosphere to calm us down so we can actually hear the voice of God and you know what'll do it the right kind of music music is a powerful thing absolutely powerful there's a reason why we start a church with worship why to set an atmosphere so you can receive the preaching of the word that tells me that if you're not in a mood to receive it then you need to get in a mood to receive it before you can receive it and music is the ordained way to generally do that you can put on a sermon that'll be fine whatever you want to do but something that'll calm you down that'll settle your spirit and that'll set your attitude right to to approach God and receive what God's got for you we've got to give ourselves a chance to get settled before we go in and dump everything on God settle down look what brother Bram says now we're talking about this young lady I mentioned earlier he's going to pray for her he's just prayed for her she's been delivered and she was she was all worked up he says no don't fear young lady look will you do as I tell you now you feel all right at this time because it's gone okay he's prayed he's cast it off of her when you come up here there was a dark shadow around you and it's gone now he says it scared you you can't help it it comes to you he he says but look now the unclean spirit's gone from you he walks in dry fa dry places now listen to this he says he will try to return again but you just take my word as God's Prophet here's her answer don't you never have a frown on your face does that seem impossible listen to this sing all day long and praise God no matter how you feel of what takes place notice he didn't say you'd always feel good he didn't say you'll never fear fearful feel fearful but he said sing and praise no matter what you feel feeling's not the problem letting the feeling take over is the problem and he says to counteract that sing all day long and praise God you got to keep that void filled up you got to keep something there to counteract what Satan's going to send your way he says or whatever takes place he says it'll leave you and it won't come no more now go do that you believe with all your heart he says that's right that's a killer kills more people than anything else but Christ is a savior they that walk upright before God he said he withhold no good thing from them praise the Lord he'll withhold no good thing from you but sometimes you got to keep an attitude of spirit and praise about you Amen brother R says it this way he says but you know if you're determined to see God God will make a way for you and there's no fear at all about nothing you just have one achievement one thought one motive one objective and that is one thing get to God he says and if God spoke to you you'll go I don't care what takes place God will make a way for you to do it if you're really anchored and know what you're speaking of that means we got to get in his presence and find out what he wants let him speak to us not just when it's coming over the pulpit like this but day by day by day let him just feed that word into us I saw I don't have the quote here with me but brother Bram says we need to feed this Engine with the word it's the only thing we run on the only thing a Believer runs on is the word of God the Holy Spirit feeds on the word of God your your Godlike nature inside of you that he's given you feeds on the word of God you got to feed it with the word and nothing else will take its place as good as music is it won't take the place of the word but it'll prepare you for it see music's great for feeling it's great for attitude but it won't do the work but it'll prepare you for the work but we want to talk as we just start to close now we're going to talk about the spirit of love that's the greatest weapon of all and we preached on that and I'm not going to belabor it this evening but I want you to understand one thing love works opposite to to fear love and fear are at complete opposites they're they're diametrically opposed they're at the opposite sides of the table or the circle I want to show what this looks like and in in the Book of Ruth Boaz is speaking to Ruth and they've had their their little meeting on the threshing floor and and he's expressed his desire to marry her and all of these things and and she's probably a little bit worried and he says to her now my daughter fear not I will do to thee all that thou requirest that's an absolute statement he says for all the city of my people do know that thou art a virtuous woman so Boaz is trying to set Ruth at ease that he's not going to back away from his promise and notice what he says he says Ruth you're a good woman that's what Christ says about us church that's the only one we ought to be listening to when it comes to our condition or our position is what our husband says and he says you're a virtuous bride you're a virtuous woman you're my my choice you're my thoughts you're my elected bride that's what I want to hear that's the voice that I want to listen to but notice what boas says he says I'll do all that you require now he didn't say I'll do everything you told me to do or everything you want me to do I'll said I'll he said I'll do everything you require in other words I'll do everything that is needed for you what your needs are I'll meet it whatever needs to be done to get you and I together I'm going to get it done and remember she goes back to to Naomi and Naomi says the exact same thing she says he's a good man he'll get it done don't worry about it sit back have some bread and just relax the man knows what he's doing and he's going to get it done nobody can stop him but what was Ruth's challenge Rest In Love rather than get all threatened with worry to say the first thing is he loves me he loves me that's our rest church is that he loves me my love for him waivers If we're honest based on our actions our love wavers our commitment waivers but his has never changed from the beginning and it will never change all the way through eternity he loves us and that's where our rest is amen he called us he chose us he changed us filled us with the Holy Ghost he forgave us and he's continued to work with us that's how we know he loves us is not just what he's done but what he's continuing to do he starts a work and he's going to be he's going to finish it amen this is what he Jesus said in or this is what John said he said in this was manifested the love of God towards us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him here in his love he says not that we love God that's not love he says but that he loved us and he sent his son to be the propitiation that's the atoning sacrifice for our sins and then in verse 18 He says there is no fear in love love that's an absolute you can't be in love and be in fear it doesn't work that way he says but perfect love casteth out fear because fear ha torment perfect love is the Holy Ghost In other words the Holy Ghost In You casts out fear that's God's sign that's God's token that's God's proof to you that you are signed sealed and delivered and there's nothing going to stop you and when you get the Holy Ghost that ought to be the Assurance in your heart that you don't have to fear anymore he says because fear had torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love so you can't be in love and in fear at the same time something's dominated he says but we love him because he first loved us when did he love me when I was perfect when I did the right thing no he loved us when we were unlovable when by every Godly standard there was nothing in us to love yet he loved us he gave his life for us he paid the price for us and now he's calling us and he's changing us and he's moving moving us back to our original condition amen we're not just under his love but we're in his love we're a part of him we're made a part of him amen we're bone of his bone flesh of his flesh and there's a security there's a just a a satisfaction that comes with knowing that he's working on me that he's given me this seal on my soul and he's not going to finish until he's changed this very body into a glorified body and brings me into his presence amen God's made us his choice he chose you he chose you brother Dale he chose you sister Rebecca he chose you called your name wrote your name before you did right or wrong good or bad he chose you you were in his thoughts you were in his mind you were built into him and now you're being expressed and he's come to draw you all the way back to him it's the security of being God's chosen bride that I'm talking about it's the power of love in our lives brother puts it this way he says a man that walks in Love Walks In in life and perfect love casteth out all fear he says then if here's the if if you can take him at his word and not fear a bit about it say Lord I love you you know you're going to I know you're going to answer because you promis me you would and I just know you're going to do it see it takes away all fear he says but when God says anything God stays with his word that he says you stay with it too God's going to stay with it so don't you move off of it but if you leave the word you leave God you leave your blessing and everything there he says stay and Obey God's word he says what God says God does you know as we start to close I've been dwelling a lot on something lately and it's this idea of torment and I'm preaching to myself here as much as this congregation but the scripture says fear has torment but perfect love casts out fear and I see torment I see tormented time and you know what it is is we've made it normal we've made it normal we've dealt with things for so long we've had things for so long that we've normalized it we've made it reasonable we've made it acceptable and you know the way we do that we look and we see other people that have it in the world but remember we're not of this world we're of a different Kingdom we have a different father we have a different Destiny what they have to deal with we don't have to deal with but we've got a world that'll put things on us and that'll prescribe things and tell us it can't be changed and nothing we can do about it and Satan starts running free in that area of our life because we've normalized what he's taken over we don't recognize that the ancient landmarks have been removed but the word of God is here to say you don't have to deal with it that's what the word is about it's to Quicken you to say I've been dealing with something I don't need to he's got me Bound in and I didn't even realize it and to set you free from those things Amen brother Braham says this way he says if you don't believe the Holy Ghost is right give it the same kind of try he says you might you might uh hear it on others but wait till it goes to work on you once then you'll know for sure that it is the gift of God can you say Amen to that this morning you that have the Holy Ghost when God goes to working on you through the Holy Ghost it changes you because here's the thing there's that that song I think I've quoted it before it says sometimes God calms the storm and other times he calms his child see the work is on you first he'll settle you no matter what sometimes he changes the situation sometimes he doesn't but the point is are you going to go through it all fretting and worried and stressed are you going to come through it calm and trusting and believing and relaxed in the love of God that he's given in You by the Holy Ghost he says it takes all temper all the sin all unbelief all doubts all fears he said even the fear of death goes away from you when the Holy Ghost comes in what's love the Holy Ghost When Love Comes in it takes all de fear of death away he says oh it's real friends if you've never received it don't let the night pass without receiving it what are we talking about church we're talking about letting the holy spirit of God flow through our lives in a way it's never before remember the problem is not that God's arm is shortened nor that he can't hear Brother bam says we got the flu all choked up all blocked up with unbelief with cares of this world right we've been looking too much and believing too little we've been listening to the wrong message we've been listening to the wrong messenger anden we're supposed to be walking in the word living in the word believing in the word amen one experience in the Holy Ghost one one filling Church it'll get you to Eternity but we're not just meant to make it to Eternity we're supposed to walk we're supposed to overcome we're supposed to have Victory we're supposed to have peace Joy rest all in the Holy Ghost and that takes baptism after baptism that takes experience after experience let me ask the older couples do you love your spouse more than you did before I hope you do and what did it take experience after experience Time After Time what to draw you closer and closer together and guess what you're more powerful now as a couple than you've ever been CU you're in unity now in a way that you've never been by God's grace amen that's what it takes with God don't get satisfied with say well I got the Holy Ghost that's great you're sealed to the day of your Redemption but that's not all it's given for it's given to free us it's given to take us through we don't have to show up miserable down in the mouth worn out stressed Driven Crazy thoughts going around in our heads all day long wondering worrying no we're supposed to have the power of love power of a sound mind the power of power amen I read this quote before but I'll I'll read this as we we close the musicians can come if they want brother says now let's lay aside every weight you got a temper you got something about you that makes you talk when you ought not to talk he says oh God lay it there now lay it there and watch the fire of the altar come down and take it away watch what he calls that fire he says watch the love of God Lick It Up watch that old selfishness that way you've been talking to your wife the way you've been talking to your husband the way you've been talking to your neighbor the way way you've talked about the people in the church he says lay it on the altar this morning and the fire of God will come down and take it right away what'll burn this place Supernatural power and authority he says Divine love will burn in its place he says you got sickness lay it on the Altar and say Lord here it is create in me a clean heart create in me a healing power he said see what God will do God will do it amen God bless you let's stand together if we would I've been listening to God in Simplicity bit by bit and I'm at the very end and I was listening to it this morning brother bradam is encouraging the people because he's talked about God in Simplicity he's trying to show them God wants to dwell in you this isn't just for for ministering it's not just for select people in the Bible but he says it's for you and God wants to dwell in you and that's the Simplicity of it and he's encouraging them and he's encouraging them and he's encouraging them and he's praying and he's calling out and he's calling out and then he says something's wrong you know what's wrong he says I see you're afraid to turn yourself loose he said God doesn't make a promise then go back on it it's the truth right here if you want it he says it's up to you that takes being in his presence to understand and after he says that then one by one you hear people just start to be set free in that church and one and he says there's one there's a sister she's got it and then a brother starts and then this one and that one and he says there you go there you go he's here cuz he can see the light moving I don't have that gift but he can see it and he's saying it's here it's here it's here if you only knew it was here it's here it's here and then he says you got to let yourself loose lay it down he said you've got to die to yourself I don't have the full quote here but I remember what he said he says you got to dot to yourself and lay it down lay your place down lay your position lay your rights down lay your offenses down lay your your your influence down lay your image down and just say Lord here I am consume me give me a sound mind set my mind at ease I know what it's like I've been in situations in my life where I didn't sleep the night because I was so busy running through every scenario figuring out how this was going to happen and if they do this then I'm going to do that and if they say this and I'm going to say that or how can I do this and how can I do that and how can I make ends me and your mind is just whirling whirling whirling and what is it it's torment absolute torment and I got nowhere with it except miserable tired and cranky there's no benefit to it but I sat there trying to figure it out until eventually I said I can't do it and you lay it down and you lay it down and say Lord I I can't get my way I can I couldn't fight my way out of a wet paper bag much less this situation so let you take it I'm going to let you take it and Lord just help me to dwell on you just dwell on you and let everything else go the way it's supposed to and then peace comes butam says you got to let it Loose Let Yourself Go pull out the situation and say lord it's in your hands it's your power It's Your Love it's your mind that I need let that loose in my life and it'll take care of every situation amen let's bow our heads Lord Jesus Lord the problem's not with you lord your power is not worn out Lord it hasn't leaked out of your word Lord you're not sleeping Lord You're not gone away to where we can't hear you Lord but you're quick to hear your children when they call and Lord all you're waiting for is to be invited into our situations in our lives Lord Lord you're waiting to be invited into our minds Lord even into our emotions Lord that get a hold of us so many times and Lord I'm praying for not just this congregation Lord but I'm praying for myself this morning Lord the scripture says early will I seek thee Lord help us to go early to you Lord to not lean on this arm of Flesh Lord to not get caught up in our rights and our ideas and our observations and our perceptions Lord but to lay all things at your feet Lord to take on that mind of Christ Lord to take on a power and that Spirit of love that that Spirit of power Lord that comes and moves situations Lord Lord that no matter what happens in the situation that gives us peace that gives us rest Lord that gives us that settled feeling that your Prophet talked
