[21:43] 4 amen just a few announcements of
[21:46] course I'm traveling to Pi for work this
[21:48] week so brother Mark will take the
[21:50] Wednesday night service while I'm gone
[21:53] amen want to welcome brother Chad sister
[21:54] Leah back amen God bless you good to see
[21:57] you and then we have brother iel that's
[21:59] leaving us Thursday I believe for 5
[22:02] weeks something like that I I almost
[22:06] wonder if we've done something for
[22:07] somebody to leave us for so long of
[22:09] their own free will but we know he's got
[22:10] to go back for a a wedding not his
[22:13] wedding but a wedding amen and uh so we
[22:16] pray the Lord to be with you brother Vel
[22:17] that he will guard and keep you that he
[22:19] will make you a witness a continuing
[22:21] witness amen as you're gone amen and uh
[22:25] I do want to thank brother Grant also
[22:26] this morning you know last service I
[22:28] said I've been
[22:29] using a a study from Brother Jason dears
[22:31] on this preaching but I was just about
[22:33] done this on yesterday and I remember
[22:35] that brother Grant had spoken to me
[22:37] about some of these things and shared
[22:38] some of those things and I went back and
[22:39] kind of fact checked myself and even
[22:41] made some changes so brother Grant thank
[22:43] you for that we're our body amen I never
[22:45] claimed to know it all to understand it
[22:47] all and there's many uh men that have
[22:50] gone before me to study the things we're
[22:51] going to talk about this morning and
[22:53] here's one thing I know I don't want to
[22:55] waste my time trying to figure it out
[22:56] when somebody's done the hard work so
[22:58] I'll use their work every time if I can
[23:01] and you know there may be things in here
[23:02] that maybe go beyond and and maybe some
[23:04] things that don't go quite as far in
[23:06] certain areas but I'm thankful for that
[23:08] so brother Grant God bless you for your
[23:09] service in this as well amen uh we want
[23:13] to remember Sister Melody as well she's
[23:14] getting close to her time of Deliverance
[23:18] amen and so that baby's due pretty
[23:20] quickly so we want to remember her
[23:21] brother Kingsley he's a business owner
[23:23] so he has a lot going on day by day and
[23:25] then you have a wife that's pregnant for
[23:27] the first time and about to deliver a
[23:29] baby for the first time and for those of
[23:31] you that remember the first one it's
[23:32] always usually the most nerve-wracking
[23:34] because you don't know what to expect so
[23:36] we want to remember her and brother
[23:37] Kingsley in particular in the coming
[23:40] days and weeks until the baby comes amen
[23:42] God bless you Ephesians chapter 4 we we
[23:45] read this scripture last
[23:46] service it says there is one body and
[23:50] one Spirit even as ye are called in one
[23:53] hope of your calling one Lord One Faith
[23:56] one baptism one God and Father of all
[24:00] who is above all and through all and in
[24:04] you all amen God bless you you can have
[24:06] your seats this morning and we're
[24:07] continuing our series on the Holy Ghost
[24:09] and we've been talking about what is the
[24:10] Holy Ghost and we're talking about the
[24:12] the idea of an indwelling God and we're
[24:15] looking at what the Holy Ghost has been
[24:16] and what it is in our lives and we know
[24:18] that it's God dwelling within us but we
[24:20] had to take a step back and like I said
[24:22] last service I I I thought we could
[24:24] maybe skip godhead for a while but I
[24:26] just had to go through it and so that's
[24:27] what we've been preaching on his his
[24:29] godhead and and and and what does God
[24:31] look like and how does he reveal himself
[24:33] and so last service we went through the
[24:35] attributes of God how that God's a
[24:37] spirit and that he he exists outside of
[24:39] this dimension of time and space and
[24:41] matter he can step into it but he's not
[24:43] bound by the laws of nature the way that
[24:45] we are amen he's outside of all these
[24:47] things he can enter in and he can
[24:49] interact with us here but he's not bound
[24:51] by the things that we are and in the
[24:53] Book of Psalms David would say this he
[24:55] said before the mountains were brought
[24:57] forth
[24:58] orever thou Hast formed the earth and
[25:00] the world even from Everlasting to
[25:03] Everlasting Thou Art God Amen from
[25:06] before it started there was an
[25:08] everlasting before and we can't even
[25:10] understand that idea that there was no
[25:11] time before there was time but even
[25:13] before that he was God and afterwards
[25:15] when it's all said and done and we go
[25:17] into eternity it's God it's God from
[25:19] start to finish there is no second God
[25:21] there is no third God there is no second
[25:23] person there is no third person it is
[25:25] God and God Alone it was it is the one
[25:27] true God and all of this and and I I
[25:30] will never pretend to understand God
[25:34] Amen we can't understand the greatness
[25:36] the we can't understand something that
[25:38] is not someone that is not created that
[25:40] doesn't have a beginning that doesn't
[25:42] have an end we just can't grasp those
[25:44] things but God is Jehovah his name is
[25:46] Jehovah and it means the self-existing
[25:49] one it means he's not dependent on
[25:51] something he isn't relying on something
[25:53] he's Unlimited in power he's Unlimited
[25:55] in strength he's Unlimited in in glory
[25:58] and the wonderful thing about that is
[25:59] that he does not change over time he
[26:02] does not change and so I say that to say
[26:04] this what we read about in here is who
[26:07] he is today and what he did then he can
[26:10] do today amen there is no limit on him
[26:13] so often oh I I I was just watching
[26:15] something that yesterday for a bit and
[26:18] and it it was a group of ministers
[26:19] sitting on a on a platform saying and
[26:22] they're preaching this doctrine of
[26:24] cessation that basically God only worked
[26:27] the way he did in the book of acts and
[26:28] he's never going to do it again and they
[26:31] completely ignore everything that
[26:32] happened after that including today
[26:35] including today why because they have
[26:37] put God in a box of their own doctrine
[26:39] of their own denomination and guess what
[26:41] because they don't believe it he can't
[26:43] do it he can't do it in their midst
[26:45] because there's no faith there remember
[26:46] the scripture says that Jesus went to
[26:48] capern or Galilee in these different
[26:50] areas it says he could do no great works
[26:52] there because of their unbelief and so
[26:54] he did a little miracle here and a
[26:56] little miracle there not because of
[26:57] their unbelief but because he found
[26:58] somebody with a little bit of Faith amen
[27:00] that's the only way he could do it amen
[27:02] but we can bind God by our unbelief amen
[27:05] so we don't ever want to put God in a
[27:07] box amen he's the unfolding God that's
[27:09] really where we ended last servic is
[27:11] he's the unfolding God he's revealing
[27:13] himself more and more and more and we're
[27:15] receiving a revelation in this age that
[27:18] has never been seen before except in
[27:20] part in the book of Acts because they
[27:22] fell away from it and now we're coming
[27:24] back into it amen but I'm getting ahead
[27:26] of myself already God help me amen but
[27:29] but we read last service how that first
[27:31] creation of God was light amen and and
[27:34] and it was Genesis uh chapter 1 verses
[27:36] or or chapter 1 veres 2 and 3 and it
[27:39] wasn't the sun and the moon and the
[27:40] stars because that was created on the
[27:42] fourth day but on the first day God
[27:44] created light amen and that light was
[27:47] the first born it was the first creation
[27:49] it was the word of God and we're we're
[27:51] showing that because we want to
[27:53] understand how God moves and works in
[27:55] this Dimension and he does it by the
[27:57] word me that's the way that he works
[27:59] inside of this God could have just
[28:00] worked everything by his great Holy
[28:02] Spirit he could have just done it as a
[28:04] spirit form outside of all of these
[28:06] different things he could have done it
[28:07] in a in a way that we couldn't see or
[28:09] feel or understand but he chose to come
[28:11] down now in a way that we could interact
[28:13] and he did it in a body of light and we
[28:16] talked about how that was that Perfect
[28:17] Light it's that pure light and the
[28:19] scripture says there's no shadow in him
[28:20] there's no variableness there's nothing
[28:23] that is not light inside of God because
[28:25] that is the attribute of God is that
[28:27] he's pure he is clean throughout there
[28:29] is no changing parts within him amen and
[28:31] then what happened God stepped into that
[28:34] light it was created and then he stepped
[28:37] into it amen he didn't create another
[28:38] being he didn't create another mind he
[28:40] didn't create another person rather God
[28:43] stepped into that light and that light
[28:45] became the dwelling place of God Amen
[28:48] that's the way it was we would say it
[28:49] was God above
[28:51] us some people would say it was God the
[28:53] Father brother Bram says God the Father
[28:55] sometimes and sometimes he says God the
[28:56] son because it's a creat being amen the
[28:59] father is not the created being he's the
[29:01] one from which things come so brother
[29:02] Braham generally says that is God the
[29:05] that is the sun being created and we'll
[29:07] see that as we go through here we can
[29:09] call it whatever title we want the title
[29:11] does not matter the point that matters
[29:13] is that God stepped into it amen and it
[29:16] wasn't another God it wasn't another
[29:17] person God stepped into it amen and
[29:20] really what we see that Pillar of Fire
[29:21] was is that is Christ that is the word
[29:24] that's who Christ is Christ is not a man
[29:26] Christ is the word that's the way we
[29:29] understand it and that's where the
[29:29] Trinity I think struggles so often is
[29:31] that they try and turn this into persons
[29:33] rather than the idea of the word being
[29:35] placed in vessel after vessel and it's
[29:36] just the revealing it's the unfolding of
[29:38] God as he goes through amen Christ is
[29:40] just the anointed one what it's the body
[29:42] Anointed with the very presence of God
[29:44] himself that's what the word is amen so
[29:47] why would we call this light the son why
[29:49] would we call it that because the son
[29:51] comes from the father amen that's the
[29:53] Christ it's the son is produced by the
[29:54] father he's a creation of the father and
[29:56] so all God did was he took the the
[29:58] attributes of himself he spoke it and it
[30:01] became reality and then he stepped into
[30:03] that himself the very person of God Amen
[30:06] so when we come to God we have to
[30:08] realize that the body he takes on is not
[30:10] something that we would necessarily call
[30:12] a body we look at bodies as the bodies
[30:14] that we have human bodies and those
[30:16] sorts of things it doesn't have to be a
[30:18] person but it can be a person God can
[30:20] step into a body that looks like a
[30:22] person and we'll talk about that in the
[30:23] service today but God can step into a
[30:25] body of light God can step into a body
[30:27] of wind God can step into a body of fire
[30:30] god can step into a body of cloud and it
[30:32] is still the person of God Amen it's
[30:35] still the person of God that's that's
[30:37] the way it is whatever God chooses
[30:39] whatever God creates whatever God
[30:41] purposes as soon as God steps into it
[30:43] that body is the dwelling place of God
[30:47] Amen it's not a second person it's not a
[30:50] second God or a third God or whatever
[30:51] you want to call it it's just God
[30:53] stepping into a body of his own choosing
[30:55] and making God is a Creator he can
[30:58] literally create a body like that and
[31:00] we'll talk about that a little bit as we
[31:01] go here he can create it and he can step
[31:03] into it and then he can step away from
[31:05] it and that thing can dis and he just he
[31:07] speaks it into existence he can speak it
[31:09] right out of existence it was there one
[31:11] minute and it's gone the next it wasn't
[31:12] there one minute and then it was there
[31:13] the minute God can step in and out of
[31:15] this Dimension any way he wants and
[31:17] reveal himself and we call this Pro
[31:20] process in morphe it's a it's a Greek
[31:22] phrase this transformation when God
[31:24] steps into a body and he wraps himself
[31:26] in something or he appears to be
[31:28] something then it's a Greek phrase
[31:29] called inor and it's God putting on a
[31:32] mask is the way brother BR would say it
[31:34] I like to go a little further I say it's
[31:35] God putting on a costume it's a full
[31:38] thing because the mask only hides this
[31:40] but a costume is the whole thing amen
[31:42] and God steps in and and you you re you
[31:44] say could that be God why because you
[31:47] can't see anything except this this
[31:49] entire thing that wraps around him amen
[31:52] amen it's not immediately obvious who he
[31:54] is by
[31:56] Vision he doesn't always here as a as a
[31:58] great Angel as a Shining Light sometimes
[32:01] it's a person you're talking to did you
[32:02] know you could talk to God and not
[32:04] realize it there's people in the in the
[32:07] Bible that did it they didn't realize
[32:08] who they were talking to at first but
[32:11] then they realized by Revelation why
[32:13] because the word reveals the word so how
[32:15] do we recognize God we recognize him by
[32:18] the word amen We compare what we're
[32:20] seeing and what we're hearing to what
[32:22] the word says and if it matches with the
[32:24] word then it must be the word whether
[32:26] it's a whether it's uh you know it's not
[32:29] normal whether it's something we hadn't
[32:30] considered something we hadn't thought
[32:32] possible when Christ came he was way too
[32:34] far outside of what they were expecting
[32:36] but if they would have compared him to
[32:37] the written word they would have found
[32:38] out he was the living word amen so I
[32:42] don't care how Supernatural something is
[32:44] I don't care if it makes us feel warm
[32:46] and fuzzy I don't care if it makes the
[32:48] hairs on our on our arms stand up I
[32:50] don't care how many goose pimples it
[32:51] gives us if it doesn't match the word of
[32:55] God or more to the point if it
[32:57] contradicts F the word of God it is not
[32:59] God I'm not saying it's not
[33:02] Supernatural because there are other
[33:04] Supernatural forces amen there's two
[33:06] kingdoms at War here there's a kingdom
[33:07] of Satan and there's a kingdom of God
[33:09] and the scripture says that Satan and
[33:11] his his his his demons are often
[33:13] revealed as angels of light the way they
[33:16] come is
[33:18] 99.9% light but there's a shadow there
[33:21] there's a variable there's a shadow of
[33:23] turning there's that variableness that
[33:24] you don't find in the word of God and so
[33:27] you can say you might be Supernatural
[33:28] but you are not of my kingdom and you
[33:30] can rebuke that thing and that's why I
[33:32] said you know when we talk about we get
[33:33] inspiration as as ministers and we go
[33:35] back to the word and we find it isn't
[33:37] 100% that's why we throw it all
[33:40] away we don't try and Salvage it because
[33:43] Satan is 99% light so many times but
[33:47] that one bit of darkness is what
[33:48] separates him from Christ the word amen
[33:50] our only discernment that we have church
[33:53] is this by the holy spirit it's the only
[33:56] discernment we have we we go by feelings
[33:58] we go by events we go by the
[34:01] supernatural that is not what determines
[34:03] whether it's the word of God whether
[34:05] it's God it's what matches up to the
[34:07] word of God Amen we test things by their
[34:10] fruit not by how they make us feel so
[34:13] often I think as message Believers we
[34:15] can come to the place where we're
[34:16] resting on what we've there's an
[34:18] intuition there you got to check that
[34:20] you got to check that because we are
[34:22] still in an unredeemed body and that
[34:24] intuition can absolutely be the flesh
[34:26] amen it doesn't have to necessarily be
[34:28] the Holy Spirit I believe as we grow and
[34:30] mature in Christ then often what happens
[34:32] is we'll get something that says wo and
[34:35] I believe that's the Holy Spirit not
[34:37] always but often it is and we learn to
[34:39] check that we learn to take it back to
[34:40] the word amen but God created this light
[34:43] and we walk through some of the
[34:44] scriptures showing that God is light
[34:45] that's his original creation his
[34:47] original attribute and and we saw that
[34:50] in in Genesis 13 it says that God
[34:52] separated the light from the darkness
[34:54] and the Darkness couldn't overcome it
[34:56] now we think of that as the natural way
[34:59] that light is but that is an attribute
[35:00] that God built into light that light and
[35:02] darkness could not be in the same place
[35:04] at the same time amen and the nature of
[35:07] light is that it reveals things and in
[35:08] Ephesians the next chapter from where we
[35:10] read it says but all things that are
[35:12] reproved are made manifest by the light
[35:15] for whatsoever does make manifest is
[35:18] light right sister Moren this is one of
[35:19] her favorite scriptures I'd never
[35:21] remembered it until she told me about it
[35:23] when I moved here and it's become a
[35:24] favorite of mine because in other words
[35:26] when something is
[35:28] revealed Darkness has to go away and as
[35:31] children of God we run to this rather
[35:35] than away from it you want to know if
[35:37] somebody's a real believer when the word
[35:41] exposes something that needs to be
[35:43] reproved what do we do church we come
[35:46] right up here and we say Lord Jesus
[35:49] that's me that's me and we humble
[35:52] ourselves to the word because what we
[35:55] are children of light we are children of
[35:58] God remember the scripture says if we
[36:00] walk in the light we choose to walk in
[36:03] it he gives it we choose to step into it
[36:06] amen if we walk in the light as he is in
[36:09] the light you can't walk with Christ the
[36:10] word unless you're in the light of the
[36:11] word amen if we walk in the light as he
[36:15] is in the light then we have Fellowship
[36:17] one with another cuz what you got to
[36:19] walk there and I've got to walk there we
[36:21] can't have fellowship if you're in
[36:22] darkness and I'm in light he says then
[36:24] we have Fellowship one with another and
[36:26] the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all
[36:28] sin amen that's the only way that it can
[36:31] work amen is that we walk in the light
[36:33] and we sometimes have to fight this
[36:36] flesh this flesh does not like to be
[36:38] reproved this flesh does not need to
[36:40] like to be revealed what its true nature
[36:42] is amen and so when those things pop up
[36:45] then what do we do we run to the light
[36:47] and we say God take it away your word
[36:49] has revealed it for a purpose and the
[36:52] purpose is not to shame me it's not to
[36:54] make me embarrassed it's to take the
[36:56] shackles off my life so that I can walk
[36:59] in newness of life in the freedom of the
[37:01] Holy Spirit by the word of God Amen
[37:03] that's why it's doing it inside of our
[37:04] Lives now I want to start where I ended
[37:07] last service how that God is the
[37:09] unfolding God and I said earlier that
[37:11] we've never had the the full revelation
[37:13] of God until this age because God's been
[37:16] doing a work and he did an Old Testament
[37:18] work amen of revealing himself and then
[37:21] he came and he lived in Christ in a man
[37:23] for 33 and A2 years and then after that
[37:26] he came and he had a third revealing of
[37:28] himself and that's in a people amen and
[37:30] that's in the the bride of Christ that's
[37:31] in the true church and God is moving and
[37:34] God was moving from Christ into a new
[37:36] light and that's where we read that
[37:38] scripture in the in the first uh service
[37:40] on this where he said ye are the he said
[37:42] I am the light of the world but then he
[37:43] comes he says ye are the light of the
[37:44] world what is it it's a further
[37:46] revealing of God and it's going to be in
[37:49] you and I but we're going to get to that
[37:50] way way further down in this series by
[37:52] God's grace amen but what am I trying to
[37:55] say I'm saying never limit the revealing
[37:57] of God
[37:58] God can reveal himself in any way he
[38:00] wants as long as he doesn't contradict
[38:02] this word it can be outside of the word
[38:04] but it cannot contradict the word amen
[38:06] God bound himself we say don't put God
[38:08] in a box but God absolutely put himself
[38:10] in a box with this word and he says I
[38:12] can't go against it why because it's him
[38:14] he is the word it came from him it's his
[38:16] very attributes and thoughts on these
[38:18] different things amen so we want to talk
[38:20] about this notion of God revealing
[38:22] himself by the word and remember we said
[38:25] last service you cannot answer Trinity
[38:27] do with Trinity labels it doesn't work
[38:30] because you'll keep trying to do you'll
[38:32] keep trying to find an explanation for
[38:34] something that you need not explain the
[38:35] way that they believe it remember we
[38:37] said that they call him God the son but
[38:39] you'll never find the phrase God the son
[38:41] in the scriptures we will find Son of
[38:43] God but we do not find God the son
[38:46] that's never there amen and there's a
[38:48] huge difference that is in those two
[38:50] phrases and we'll see that probably next
[38:52] service Lord willing when we start to
[38:53] talk about Jesus Christ the man but we
[38:56] ask what is a son and we say said the
[38:57] son is the expressed image or attributes
[39:00] of his father amen he's the DNA of his
[39:03] father he's the creation of his father
[39:05] and that's the simplest way to
[39:07] understand who the son is who the Son of
[39:09] God is it is the attributes it's the
[39:11] creation it's the visible portion of God
[39:14] the Son of God is the expressed and
[39:16] created attributes of God himself amen
[39:19] and we call all those things the word
[39:21] it's the literal the living the visible
[39:23] interpretation and attributes of God in
[39:26] this Dimension so all that God is is in
[39:29] the Son of God the nature the attributes
[39:33] when we get to Christ the man we'll see
[39:35] his literal DNA was God's DNA if there
[39:37] was such a thing amen but it's just God
[39:40] stepping into our reality it's God
[39:42] stepping into space and time and matter
[39:44] and interacting with us and the world
[39:46] around us it's not a second personality
[39:49] it's not a second mindset it's not a
[39:51] second attitude it's just God putting
[39:53] himself into a body that we can sort of
[39:56] see and understand
[39:58] with our limited understanding amen and
[40:00] the first body God wrapped himself in
[40:02] was light and we call that the pillar of
[40:04] fire amen as we said in the beginning
[40:08] the Genesis 1:2 says and God said let
[40:10] there be light and there was light and
[40:12] that was not the Sun the moon and the
[40:13] stars that's down in Genesis 1:14 in the
[40:16] fourth day rather God created a light
[40:19] and he stepped into this light amen and
[40:22] this was the first expression of the
[40:24] word of God Amen this is the first
[40:26] expression of the son of God and what
[40:27] was it it was God putting himself in the
[40:30] body it's the person of God stepping
[40:33] into the body of
[40:35] God I mean does that make sense the
[40:37] person of God the the the literal God
[40:40] stepping into a body that he prepared
[40:41] for himself but we'll see even later as
[40:43] we go into this service that even within
[40:45] that shell if we want to call it that
[40:47] body of light the literal theophany of
[40:50] God is dwelling inside of that amen the
[40:53] literal shape the form of God the
[40:55] celestial body of God is with in that
[40:57] light and we know that it's in the shape
[40:59] of a man because why we are in the image
[41:03] of God we are not created in an image of
[41:05] light we are created in an image of a
[41:07] body and so God has to have a body as
[41:10] well that's in we are in the image we
[41:12] are not perfect but it is going to look
[41:14] like our body amen we'll see it as we go
[41:16] by the scriptures but God steps into
[41:18] that body remember what we said the word
[41:20] was the word is the logos it's the
[41:22] thoughts of God that were spoken and
[41:25] then became reality amen the thoughts of
[41:28] God are powerful but they are powerful
[41:29] when they are spoken not just when
[41:31] they're thought it has to speak that's
[41:33] why we have to be a speaking bride not
[41:36] just a hearing bride is because when we
[41:39] speak it it puts it into action amen but
[41:42] it has to be the mind of Christ that
[41:44] puts it into action because it's then in
[41:46] his time and in his season as we do
[41:48] those things amen so God steps into this
[41:51] and what does he do remember we read
[41:53] read in Colossians 1 that everything was
[41:55] created through this being
[41:57] through the word amen it was it was the
[42:00] the first uh example that we have of
[42:03] Christ the anointed one amen and God
[42:05] continued his creation and he continued
[42:08] to speak the word and he said let there
[42:09] be and there was and every time he said
[42:11] it it was good what it it was an exact
[42:14] representation of what he had thought
[42:18] amen and so everything we see here is
[42:21] God working through this now the idea we
[42:23] have that that the Son of God is Jesus
[42:25] Christ the man is I think the hardest
[42:27] thing for people to understand because
[42:29] Christ is the anointed one he is not a
[42:31] man that lived 2,000 years ago remember
[42:34] Jesus said and we'll get into this next
[42:35] service Lord willing he says before
[42:37] Abraham was I am Jesus said that Jesus
[42:41] said that not that body there's
[42:43] something else that was I am in Christ
[42:45] that was the I am that he was talking
[42:47] about amen so we cannot say that je that
[42:49] Christ is the only is the man that was
[42:52] 2,000 years ago Christ is way before
[42:54] that Colossians 1 tells us that amen
[42:56] it's the Son of God it's the it is the
[42:59] the the visible God being revealed to us
[43:01] amen Jesus said I come from my father
[43:04] and I go back to my father and the next
[43:07] time we see Jesus is where he's on the
[43:10] road to Damascus having knocked Saul off
[43:12] of his high horse and Saul says
[43:16] Lord Jehovah who are you and who does he
[43:21] say I am I
[43:24] am
[43:26] Jesus what was he he started as light
[43:28] and he went back to light it's Christ
[43:31] the word it is not just a man
[43:35] hallelujah how do you fit that into
[43:37] Trinity Doctrine when he walked in flesh
[43:39] and then literally a couple of years
[43:41] later he is the literal Pillar of Fire
[43:44] identifying himself by name I am
[43:49] Jesus who you're
[43:51] persecuting so he's saying I'm Jesus
[43:53] this light is Jesus and he says oh by
[43:55] the way you're persecuting me and he's
[43:57] persecuting
[43:58] Believers God above us and God in us
[44:02] simultaneously how does that work you
[44:05] can't pull that through Trinity Doctrine
[44:06] it doesn't work amen but he starts here
[44:10] as a great light now listen to this it
[44:13] says now that was the pillar of fire
[44:15] that led the children of Israel was the
[44:17] Lord Jesus Christ he doesn't say Jesus
[44:21] Christ he says Lord Jesus Christ form
[44:23] the logos that went out of God Amen look
[44:27] don't don't when we come to this idea of
[44:28] the Son of God or Jesus Christ don't
[44:31] look for aen look for where the word is
[44:34] amen look for the expression of God
[44:36] don't attach Lord Jesus Christ just to
[44:38] the body of a man 2,000 years ago that
[44:40] walked on Earth that's a part of it but
[44:42] it's not all of it amen that's a
[44:44] revelation of God but it's not the full
[44:46] revealing the full revealing of God is
[44:48] Lord Jesus Christ when he walk this
[44:51] Earth he was not Lord he says you call
[44:53] me Lord and you say well for so I am but
[44:55] he was not revealing himself as Lord
[44:57] there he was completely subject to the
[45:00] father there but he's going to come
[45:02] later and it's in a different thing it
[45:03] is king of kings and Lord of lords
[45:05] that's the final Revelation that the
[45:07] world is going to see of him will be as
[45:09] judge and King amen but we see that Lord
[45:11] Jesus Christ is the full revelation of
[45:14] God not just the man that was here 2,000
[45:16] years ago then he would say this he says
[45:19] the great Fountain brother Bob that was
[45:21] a wonderful song service this morning
[45:24] the great Fountain of all eternity was
[45:28] that Spirit of love joy that Spirit of
[45:32] honesty he says that Spirit of tress in
[45:35] this Perfection and then out of the
[45:37] existence of the father went the logos
[45:40] which was the son he says which was a
[45:42] theophany now what's a theophany says
[45:45] which was the body of the great Jehovah
[45:47] God went forth in a Celestial body he
[45:50] says that's the logos the word spoke out
[45:52] of them great Fountains of life and went
[45:54] forth and there was the theophany which
[45:57] was God made into word amen we'll get
[46:01] into what a theophany is a little bit
[46:03] later in more detail but the simple
[46:05] definition of a theophany is that it's a
[46:07] Heavenly Body it's a Celestial body amen
[46:10] it's a supernatural body that's intended
[46:12] for everyone that is of the family of
[46:14] God to dwell in God has one you have one
[46:18] and I have one Jesus said I go to my
[46:20] father's house what to prepare he says
[46:23] there's many mansions there those are
[46:25] the theophany bodies of the children of
[46:27] God that are waiting for them amen
[46:29] that's what's waiting for us beyond the
[46:30] curtain of time and it joins our flesh
[46:32] body with our theophany body to create a
[46:35] glorified body amen not this flesh body
[46:38] as it is it'll be the redeemed flesh
[46:39] body that's the full day of our
[46:41] Redemption amen is when this body is
[46:42] changed into sinless Perfection unites
[46:45] with our theophany but I want to go back
[46:47] to what we read in John chapter 1 last
[46:49] service and and kind of just we're
[46:51] building from where we started last time
[46:52] and a few people weren't here and so I
[46:54] wanted to just take a bit of time this
[46:55] morning to go through it it's a Sunday
[46:57] morning I'm not going to rush I'm just
[46:58] going to try and take my time by God's
[47:00] grace he says in the beginning was the
[47:03] word the word was with God and the Word
[47:06] was God the same was in the beginning
[47:09] with God it says all things were made by
[47:12] him who the word and without him was not
[47:15] anything made that was made by who the
[47:17] word of God who is the word of God it's
[47:19] Christ Christ the word amen we read that
[47:21] in Colossians 1 last service Christ's
[47:24] identification is always the word and we
[47:26] see that the word means the expression
[47:28] of God Amen it's the anointed one the
[47:30] manifestation the expression the reality
[47:32] the visible God it says in him was life
[47:36] and the life was the light of man you
[47:38] know we have the word for for for God in
[47:40] the Old Testament is Jehovah and then we
[47:43] have it and we say it's Yahweh but but
[47:46] the actual word written out in English
[47:49] is YH wh and you cannot pronounce it
[47:52] it's not a
[47:54] word but the way they say that you
[47:56] pronounce it is you take a breath in and
[47:59] you put a breath out so this y HWH
[48:05] is that's how you pronounce the name of
[48:07] God and it says here he is the life and
[48:10] that life was the light of man literally
[48:13] our every breath expresses
[48:16] God you can't walk a day without
[48:20] expressing God every breath you make
[48:24] expresses the name of God as he revealed
[48:26] it in his original word
[48:29] amen but watch this Gap now it said and
[48:31] the light shineth in darkness and the
[48:33] Darkness comprehended it not okay that's
[48:35] the word the word the word the word the
[48:36] word is in light now we have this Gap
[48:39] this was all before the man Jesus Christ
[48:41] ever came on this Earth amen Christ was
[48:43] there before the literal body of Jesus
[48:45] came amen 4,000 years later because in
[48:48] verse 14 it says and the Word was what
[48:52] first it was made light now it says the
[48:54] word was made flesh that's Jes Jesus
[48:57] Christ the man and dwelt among us and we
[48:59] beheld his glory the glory as of the
[49:02] only begotten of the father full of
[49:06] grace and truth now we showed this in
[49:08] the slides last time and we said that
[49:11] God is a spirit he's not bound by this
[49:13] world and so he's kind of the the white
[49:15] line all the way around that's God
[49:16] outside of everything amen and God is a
[49:19] spirit he's invisible he's shapeless
[49:21] he's boundless he's Eternal and all of
[49:24] the the attributes of God are inside of
[49:26] him but then he had this idea of the
[49:29] thoughts that would relate to his bride
[49:31] to his family and he put those all
[49:34] together and we call that the word of
[49:36] God and it's the thoughts and attributes
[49:38] it's the plans it's the children of God
[49:41] it's the lamb slain before the
[49:42] foundation of the world it's the whole
[49:44] Plan of Redemption of the restoration of
[49:47] the production of the children of God
[49:49] and we take that whole thing and we call
[49:51] that the word and God wrote it down for
[49:53] us so we could see it so this is the
[49:55] word written it's not the word spoken
[49:57] it's the word written but before it was
[49:59] ever written it had to be thought and
[50:00] then it became spoken by God it became
[50:03] the spoken word the Loos now it does not
[50:06] leave God but rather it comes out of
[50:08] him God's still there it's still a part
[50:11] of God but the words come out and what
[50:13] do they produce they produce a light
[50:16] amen and in this in this light is where
[50:19] God would dwell and he would step into
[50:21] this light amen and that light is the
[50:24] word amen the word was meant to be more
[50:27] than the thoughts of God attributes are
[50:30] meant to be expressed thoughts are meant
[50:33] to be
[50:34] spoken and then they're meant to become
[50:36] something do we say words so that they
[50:39] can fall on deaf
[50:41] ears am I preaching this morning so that
[50:43] you won't change no I'm preaching so
[50:46] that you will change that you'll have a
[50:47] greater understanding you'll have a
[50:49] greater appreciation that you'll draw
[50:50] closer to God that you'll pull away from
[50:53] the things of the world the point of
[50:55] speaking words is that they would have
[50:56] have an effect and that comes from the
[50:59] very origin of Genesis that God had
[51:01] thoughts and he spoke them and the point
[51:03] was that the word was supposed to have
[51:05] an effect amen so we have this logos now
[51:07] we have this light and it is not all of
[51:10] God but it is completely God everything
[51:13] that's in it is God there is no nothing
[51:16] else that's in there amen there's no
[51:18] alternate opinions there's nothing of
[51:19] the satanic world or Kingdom there's
[51:21] there's no Shadows it's just God God God
[51:24] all the way through it's 100% God Amen
[51:27] amen and so God didn't create here a new
[51:30] Consciousness didn't create a new person
[51:33] God created a form and he stepped into
[51:35] that himself amen he put his own self
[51:38] into that body of light and he dwelt in
[51:40] there and through that body now he
[51:42] interacted with creation and actually
[51:44] brought creation into existence by the
[51:46] spoken word amen but what happens after
[51:50] this is God limited now is the word
[51:53] limited to a pillar of
[51:54] fire is that the only revealing of God
[51:57] is that the only revealing of Christ
[51:59] brother Grant's telling me no so I
[52:01] better be right I better be in agreement
[52:02] with them here right no that can't be
[52:05] the only way we see God we go through
[52:07] the scriptures and we see God revealed
[52:09] in so many different ways but it's
[52:12] always the same God really if we were to
[52:16] take the Trinity of Doctrine and apply
[52:18] it all through the scriptures we'd have
[52:20] to come up with about 19 different gods
[52:22] cuz if every time God steps into a body
[52:25] that becomes another part of the godhead
[52:28] then we'd have so many gods it wouldn't
[52:29] be funny but that's not the way it is it
[52:32] is one God revealing himself time and
[52:35] time again God in morphe God changing
[52:38] his costume his mask if we want to put
[52:40] it that way and we now we step out of
[52:42] Genesis 1 of The Creation story two
[52:44] where he puts Adam and Eve there now we
[52:46] go into Genesis 3 it says and they heard
[52:49] Adam and Eve heard the voice of the Lord
[52:52] God doing what
[52:54] walking in the Garden in the cool of the
[52:57] day and Adam and his wife hid themselves
[53:00] from the presence of the Lord God
[53:01] amongst the Trees of the garden garden
[53:03] So Adam and Eve are now interacting with
[53:05] God this is Jehovah
[53:08] God this is God the Eternal spirit and
[53:11] he's doing what he is not he's not
[53:14] gliding through in a pillar of fire
[53:18] pillars of fire don't walk I don't know
[53:20] if you know that they don't
[53:23] walk they float they move
[53:27] what walks Church bodies bodies walk
[53:31] people walk so God is now in a body
[53:34] walking throughout the Garden of Eden
[53:37] amen and so God God comes down in an
[53:41] image that matches the image that he
[53:42] created and he steps into a body and
[53:46] that body is not God God just creates a
[53:48] body and he steps into it amen but you
[53:52] can worship it as God because God's in
[53:55] there
[53:57] amen so I imagine that God came down and
[54:00] I would imagine he's in what we would
[54:01] call a glorified body it appears as
[54:03] flesh it looks as flesh you can touch it
[54:06] you can do all these things but it is
[54:07] Ageless it has nothing it's perfect it's
[54:10] a perfectly created body but who is
[54:12] walking there it's the word in a body it
[54:16] was in a body of light now it's in a
[54:18] body of Flesh it's the created body of
[54:20] God indwelt by God having a conversation
[54:23] with his children and he's interacting
[54:26] now with creation it's God and a body
[54:28] all over again and who is it church it's
[54:30] Christ it's Christ the word not the
[54:32] flesh man Jesus but it's Christ the word
[54:35] which is the revealing of God walking
[54:37] with and talking with his
[54:39] children we have to understand to
[54:42] understand God have we have to
[54:43] understand the purpose of the word and
[54:44] the purpose of the word is to reveal and
[54:46] produce
[54:48] God that's its only purpose and when you
[54:51] find yourself in it it's there to
[54:52] produce your portion of God that's
[54:55] really what's happening in all the these
[54:56] things is to produce to manifest the
[54:58] thoughts the attributes the nature the
[55:01] Judgment the plan the purpose of God in
[55:03] this Dimension so we cannot look at the
[55:05] word as a separate individual from God
[55:09] because it's not it's just God himself
[55:11] revealing himself inside of this
[55:13] Dimension that we're in God comes to us
[55:16] God is with us and God is in us and it's
[55:20] the same God all the way through but we
[55:22] see here in Genesis 3 that God is
[55:25] walking in a body with his children and
[55:27] interacting with them he can hand them
[55:30] skins amen he can talk he can turn the
[55:34] serpent can see and interact with him
[55:37] amen but then we jump a little further
[55:39] and this is where we'll spend the
[55:40] majority of the service with Abram
[55:42] because God is trying to produce the
[55:43] word in Abraham and what happens to
[55:45] produce the word the word has to come to
[55:47] you that's the way that it works amen
[55:50] the word has to come to you to produce
[55:51] the word inside of you that's why we
[55:53] have to sit under the true preaching of
[55:55] the word because because it's only the
[55:56] true word will produce the true
[56:00] word but God comes forward now and we
[56:03] have Abram coming and he's he's gone and
[56:05] he's rescued lot and he's taken his 300
[56:07] plus servants out and he's slaughtered
[56:09] the Kings out there and he's come back
[56:11] and he meets a man on the plains there
[56:14] and he has an experience with this man
[56:16] he's a king he's a priest and we see
[56:18] here a great Revelation in the
[56:19] scriptures and in Genesis 14 it says and
[56:23] mzc the king of Salem brought forth
[56:26] Bread and
[56:27] Wine the word and revelation of the word
[56:31] and he was the priest of the most high
[56:33] God and he blessed him and said Blessed
[56:36] Be Abraham of the most high god
[56:38] possessor of Heaven and Earth and
[56:39] blessed be the most high God which had
[56:41] delivered thine enemies into thine hand
[56:43] and he gave him tithes of all Abraham
[56:47] gave this priest this King tithe there
[56:51] was no law there was no requirement of
[56:53] ties at that time Church why did Abraham
[56:56] do do it Abraham did it by
[56:58] Revelation knowing who that was that he
[57:01] owed something to that man to that
[57:04] person that he was talking to and he
[57:06] gave it and not only that but God by
[57:09] Revelation through Abraham was making
[57:11] the way for an ironic priesthood that
[57:13] would come later that would owe God
[57:16] nothing Abraham paid the way for
[57:19] Levi scripture says Levi paid ties in
[57:22] the loins of Abraham God attributed
[57:25] those ties he didn't requ of Abraham he
[57:27] was taking those tithes for the sake of
[57:29] Levi and they would give their lives as
[57:31] a tithe they were the tithe Hallelujah
[57:34] they were the tithe of God out of the
[57:36] children of Israel he says I'm not going
[57:37] to take a little bit from every tribe
[57:39] I'm going to take one complete tribe and
[57:41] they will serve me and they'll be my
[57:42] priests and they're the only ones that
[57:43] can do it Abraham was Paving the way for
[57:46] people to serve God in a special
[57:48] way amen but we see that Abraham
[57:52] recognized who this man was but we see
[57:54] here it's just he's the king of Salem
[57:56] and he was the priest of the most high
[57:57] God that doesn't make a whole lot of
[57:59] sense why Abraham would do this but now
[58:01] we come to Paul in Hebrews 7 and Paul
[58:04] starts to tell us who this mzc was he
[58:07] says and from this mzc for this mzc
[58:10] rather king of Saum priest of the most
[58:12] high God who met Abraham returning from
[58:14] the slaughter of the Kings and blessed
[58:16] him to whom also Abraham gave a tenth
[58:19] part of all then it says it starts Paul
[58:22] starting to tell us who this mesc is he
[58:23] says first being by interpretation
[58:26] king of
[58:28] righteousness and after that also king
[58:30] of Salem which is king of Peace church
[58:32] there's only one king of righteousness
[58:34] and there's only one king of peace and
[58:36] it is not an Earthly
[58:38] King amen he says now listen these are
[58:41] the attributes of melchisedek see if you
[58:43] can catch who this is without father
[58:47] without mother without dissent he
[58:49] doesn't have a mommy he doesn't have a
[58:50] dad he doesn't have a family lineage he
[58:52] doesn't have a family history he doesn't
[58:54] have a family genealogy can't where he
[58:56] come from and can't tell where he's
[58:58] going he says neither having beginning
[59:01] of days nor end of
[59:05] life he never started and he never
[59:09] ends he says made but made like unto the
[59:13] Son of God oh so he is like the Son of
[59:17] God he's not the Son of God but he's
[59:18] like the Son of God he's like Christ but
[59:21] he's not Christ himself the Jesus we
[59:24] understand is what he's talking about he
[59:25] says he abideth a priest continually
[59:27] he's a priest forever is what he's
[59:29] saying he's not the Son of God but he's
[59:31] like unto the Son of God so this isn't
[59:33] Jesus here is what he's saying this
[59:35] isn't Jesus the man he says now consider
[59:39] how great this man was unto whom even
[59:41] the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of
[59:43] the spoils Paul says really think about
[59:45] it who was this man that Abraham gave
[59:47] all this money
[59:49] to his description in Genesis makes him
[59:52] sound yes like a great man a great king
[59:54] but when Paul comes and he starts to
[59:56] reveal the attributes of them he's more
[59:58] than a great man he's more than a great
[1:00:00] priest he has the very attributes of God
[1:00:04] himself amen the king of Peace the king
[1:00:07] of righteousness without a starting of
[1:00:09] days without an ending of days amen
[1:00:13] that's more than any priest or Minister
[1:00:14] I've ever met
[1:00:15] church as great as the ones we've met
[1:00:18] they don't compare to this consider this
[1:00:21] he has no parents he has no family
[1:00:22] lineage no known relatives nobody knows
[1:00:25] where comes from amen he's a priest
[1:00:27] forever he's more than Aaron ever
[1:00:30] was before Aaron was I am amen he's a
[1:00:34] great priest amen that priest wasn't
[1:00:36] even in existence at that point but
[1:00:39] watch what brother Ram says now he says
[1:00:40] the
[1:00:41] logos we want to see the origin of this
[1:00:43] that logos the great Fountain this great
[1:00:46] Fountain of spirit which had no
[1:00:49] beginning or no
[1:00:52] end he says this great spirit begin to
[1:00:55] form in the cre and the logos that went
[1:00:57] out from it was the son of God it was
[1:01:00] the only visible form that the spirit
[1:01:03] had he says and it was a theophany which
[1:01:06] means a body and the body was like a man
[1:01:09] Moses saw it when it passed by the Rock
[1:01:12] and when he looked at it he said it
[1:01:13] looked like the him part of a man it's
[1:01:15] the same type of body that we receive
[1:01:18] when we die here if this Earthly
[1:01:20] Tabernacle be dissolved we have one
[1:01:22] already waiting he says that was it that
[1:01:24] was the theophany which which was which
[1:01:26] was the son of God so he says that great
[1:01:31] fountain that Spirit it had no beginning
[1:01:33] nor end it has a theophany body it has a
[1:01:36] Celestial body it looks like a man he
[1:01:38] says Moses saw it so let's go to the
[1:01:41] scriptures and see what happened here
[1:01:43] because Moses said that that God says
[1:01:45] I'm going to show you the hinder part
[1:01:47] the hind part of a man the back of a man
[1:01:49] and then we'll come back to mzc to see
[1:01:51] who this man was but in Exodus 33 it
[1:01:53] says and the Lord said unto Moses I will
[1:01:56] do this thing that thou Hast spoken for
[1:01:58] thou Hast found Grace in my sight and I
[1:02:00] Know Thee by name and Moses said he said
[1:02:03] I beseech thee show me thy
[1:02:06] glory and he said God said I will make
[1:02:10] what all my goodness pass before thee
[1:02:15] and I will proclaim the name of the Lord
[1:02:17] before thee and they and will be
[1:02:19] gracious to whom I will be gracious and
[1:02:21] will show Mercy on whom I will show
[1:02:22] mercy and he said thou cannot see my
[1:02:25] face for there shall be no man see me
[1:02:28] and live God says under this
[1:02:31] dispensation under this revealing of me
[1:02:34] you can't see me face to face but I'll
[1:02:36] show you my
[1:02:37] goodness and that'll have to suffice
[1:02:41] Moses and the Lord said behold there's a
[1:02:43] place by me and thou shalt stand upon a
[1:02:46] rock and it shall come when my Glory
[1:02:49] passeth by that I will put thee in a
[1:02:51] cliff of The Rock and will cover thee
[1:02:53] with my hand while I pass by
[1:02:56] and I will take away mine hand and thou
[1:02:58] shalt see my back Parts but my face
[1:03:01] shall not be seen so I want to point out
[1:03:04] two things here the goodness of God is a
[1:03:07] body it's a body amen which is what the
[1:03:12] word made real the goodness of God is
[1:03:15] the word coming into reality in your
[1:03:18] life amen so God says to Moses he says
[1:03:20] Moses there's a rock here and I'm just
[1:03:22] going to move this maybe set it up a
[1:03:24] little bit
[1:03:26] and so God says Moses there's a rock
[1:03:29] here and I want you to step on the Rock
[1:03:31] he says but as I come close to you he
[1:03:33] says I'm you want to step into the Cliff
[1:03:35] of the rock imagine this rock is high
[1:03:37] like this he says so you can't see me
[1:03:39] coming and as I come by you Moses I'm
[1:03:42] going to put my hand here so that you
[1:03:45] can't see my face but as I Cross by you
[1:03:48] I'll lower my hand and you'll see the
[1:03:50] back of me and he says what you will see
[1:03:53] is the back part of what church a man
[1:03:56] amen I'll let you see my goodness the
[1:03:59] goodness of God is the revealing of
[1:04:01] himself in a body amen and so he walks
[1:04:06] by and Moses sees the backside of a man
[1:04:10] what is it Moses was speaking with what
[1:04:13] church a pillar of fire remember brother
[1:04:16] said he said they got the light perfect
[1:04:18] when they did it in the in the in the
[1:04:20] Ten Commandments and it's the whirling
[1:04:22] fire of God it's the pillar of God it's
[1:04:24] the logos it's the body of God but
[1:04:26] within that is the literal
[1:04:33] theophonic is standing there to see the
[1:04:36] goodness of God and he walks by in his
[1:04:39] natural shape and form in which we are
[1:04:42] created hallelujah what an experience
[1:04:45] Church Moses comes down from that
[1:04:49] mountain having seen only the back of
[1:04:52] God and the glory of God was on his
[1:04:55] entire ire body so that his face Shone
[1:04:58] like God himself if that's what you can
[1:05:01] get from being in the presence of God
[1:05:03] and only seeing the back of him what
[1:05:05] ought we to have this morning when we
[1:05:06] can see him face to face Hallelujah that
[1:05:09] Moses would have to wear a veil over his
[1:05:11] face because he had been in the presence
[1:05:14] of God a sinful man under the blood of
[1:05:16] bulls and goats and yet the transference
[1:05:18] of that Glory could come on to Moses
[1:05:20] just by being in his presence
[1:05:22] church if people could see God in Moses
[1:05:24] then what out they to see in us today
[1:05:27] amen cuz we read this
[1:05:29] earlier Moses could not see his face he
[1:05:32] could see his goodness but he couldn't
[1:05:33] see his face but watch what John said in
[1:05:35] John 1:14 he said the word sorry one
[1:05:39] quote brother Bram says God isn't
[1:05:40] without a body God has got a body and it
[1:05:43] looks like a man Moses saw it others saw
[1:05:46] it and it looks like a man that's the
[1:05:48] theophany body of God it's in the shape
[1:05:49] of a man it's not flesh like we
[1:05:51] understand it but it is a theophus
[1:05:53] Celestial
[1:05:54] body Moses said God show me your glory
[1:05:57] and God said I'll only let you see a
[1:05:58] portion of it but it's in the body of
[1:05:59] the word but now John comes along and he
[1:06:02] says what the word was made flesh and
[1:06:04] dwelt among us and we beheld what his
[1:06:08] glory the glory as of the only begotten
[1:06:12] of the father full of what church Grace
[1:06:15] and Truth we get to see him face to face
[1:06:19] amen we get to see him in the light of
[1:06:21] his full Glory why because we're under a
[1:06:23] New Covenant it's a Grace Covenant but
[1:06:25] it's a Grace Covenant with the spirit of
[1:06:27] truth that's bringing us all the way
[1:06:28] back to the word in the beginning anden
[1:06:30] that's where we're sitting this morning
[1:06:32] amen hallelujah God has a body and that
[1:06:36] body is a special body it's not like
[1:06:38] ours it was light and it was fire in the
[1:06:40] beginning but God has a theophany a a in
[1:06:43] the shape of a man and he dwells in it
[1:06:45] amen and we're in that image that's why
[1:06:47] we look the way we do and we're made in
[1:06:49] a particular form and it's a reflection
[1:06:51] of the form of God's body himself
[1:06:53] brother Brown goes to explain what a
[1:06:54] theophany is and this is not a message
[1:06:56] Doctrine this is scriptural this is the
[1:06:57] way it's always been understood I don't
[1:06:59] think anyone disagrees with this he says
[1:07:01] the logos that went out of God a better
[1:07:03] word for it was what we call a theophany
[1:07:05] he says a
[1:07:17] theophyl US make man in our image and
[1:07:20] what did he produce Adam in a spirit
[1:07:22] form Adam was in a theophany body
[1:07:26] that's what could happen without sin he
[1:07:28] could go straight into his theophany and
[1:07:30] then what happened is God created a body
[1:07:32] from the dust of the earth and then that
[1:07:34] theophany body joined with this Natural
[1:07:37] Body and It produced literally a
[1:07:39] glorified body Adam was living in a
[1:07:41] glorified body it's what we'll have when
[1:07:43] we are living here on the Earth again
[1:07:45] it's our theophany joined with perfect
[1:07:47] flesh amen and that produces a glorified
[1:07:50] body amen he says a theophany is a human
[1:07:53] body that's glorified it says not
[1:07:55] exactly with flesh and blood like it
[1:07:57] will be in its glorified stage see he's
[1:07:59] saying in when we come into and we pass
[1:08:01] into eternity or even into the
[1:08:03] Millennium we can eat and we can we can
[1:08:06] uh uh digest things and we can sleep and
[1:08:08] do all these different things in theory
[1:08:10] not sorry not sleep we can eat that's
[1:08:12] the point is we can we can interact with
[1:08:14] it he says it's in the form of a human
[1:08:16] body that doesn't eat neither does it
[1:08:18] drink but it's a body that's waiting for
[1:08:20] us as soon as we leave this one that's
[1:08:22] the kind of body that God was for he
[1:08:24] said let us make man in our own image
[1:08:26] and in our likeness so theophany doesn't
[1:08:28] need to eat it doesn't need to sleep it
[1:08:29] doesn't need to drink it exists it's in
[1:08:32] a spiritual form it's a Celestial form
[1:08:34] if we want to do that amen it's perfect
[1:08:36] in its form it looks like a physical
[1:08:38] body but it is not a physical body it
[1:08:40] can't touch two theophanies coming
[1:08:43] together they don't touch they're spirit
[1:08:46] it's a spirit body amen but I want us to
[1:08:48] come back to mchis because we'll come
[1:08:50] into this theophany as we move forward
[1:08:51] in this because we want to compare his
[1:08:54] attributes to those of God and we start
[1:08:55] to see this beautiful picture emerge
[1:08:57] brother Bram says notice this
[1:08:59] melchisedek as soon as he met Abraham
[1:09:01] coming from the slaughter of the Kings
[1:09:02] he says the mystery of God is now being
[1:09:06] made
[1:09:07] known Oh I thought he was just a king
[1:09:09] and a priest no no no this is the
[1:09:11] revealing of God who was he they can't
[1:09:14] find any history of him because he
[1:09:15] didn't have any father he didn't have
[1:09:17] any mother he never had any time he
[1:09:19] began he never had any time he'd ever
[1:09:21] die so whoever he was is still alive
[1:09:25] he says he never did have a beginning so
[1:09:27] he couldn't have been nobody else but El
[1:09:30] Elohim the self-existent self abiding
[1:09:34] almighty
[1:09:36] God he says now that we find out that
[1:09:39] this person had no father no mother no
[1:09:41] beginning of days nor ending of life he
[1:09:43] said it was God and here we have that
[1:09:45] Greek phrase I was talking about inor
[1:09:47] now that Greek word means to change was
[1:09:50] used changing himself in morphy from one
[1:09:53] person to another person it's not
[1:09:56] multiple persons it's the changing of
[1:09:58] God and how he is seen and
[1:10:00] revealed because we'll see that mzc
[1:10:03] there's a changing of the revealing of
[1:10:05] God and it will be Christ Jesus Christ
[1:10:07] on this Earth amen but there's a natural
[1:10:09] priest back then and it's God IM morphe
[1:10:12] God dwelling in a body he says imorph
[1:10:15] means that he changed himself he came
[1:10:18] down see he was light he was Pillar of
[1:10:20] Fire pillar of light he came down he
[1:10:22] says now the Greek word there means that
[1:10:23] something that could not be seen yet
[1:10:26] it's there and then it's changed and the
[1:10:29] eye can catch it so when God makes
[1:10:31] himself in morphe it's so we can see so
[1:10:35] we can understand so we can interact so
[1:10:37] that we can recognize what's going on he
[1:10:40] says that Greek word there and morphe
[1:10:42] was taken from the stage act that one
[1:10:45] person one person is changing his mask
[1:10:48] to make him some other character he says
[1:10:52] like in school they have one of
[1:10:53] Shakespeare's plays and one young man
[1:10:55] had to change his clothes several times
[1:10:58] that's why I say costume not just mask
[1:11:01] cuz if he wore the same clothes and just
[1:11:02] changed his mask you know who he was but
[1:11:04] you have to change the whole thing he
[1:11:06] says that one young man had to change
[1:11:08] his clothes several times because he
[1:11:10] played two or three different parts but
[1:11:12] the same person he came out one time he
[1:11:14] was the villain when he come out the
[1:11:16] next time he was another character he
[1:11:18] says now the Greek word imorph means
[1:11:20] that he changed his
[1:11:22] mask he says that's what God did it's
[1:11:25] the same God all the
[1:11:28] time the same God was made flesh and
[1:11:31] dwelt Among Us in morphe brought out so
[1:11:34] that he could be sing right that's God
[1:11:37] in human flesh in Jesus Christ he says
[1:11:39] and now the same God is the Holy Ghost
[1:11:43] he says father son Holy Ghost not three
[1:11:46] Gods three offices three acts of the one
[1:11:50] God it's the unfolding of God the
[1:11:53] revealing of God he says God and Morp
[1:11:56] masked in the pillar of
[1:11:58] fire god and morphe in a man called
[1:12:01] Jesus and then he says God and morphe in
[1:12:04] his church God above us God With Us God
[1:12:09] in us and then he says the condescending
[1:12:12] of God hallelujah amen watch how we see
[1:12:15] God being revealed here God above us the
[1:12:18] pillar of fire and we'll see that God
[1:12:20] does not always remain above us in that
[1:12:21] Pillar of Fire but that is where he
[1:12:23] naturally stays now he can come down and
[1:12:26] talk to us but then he goes back up
[1:12:28] again we can't bring him to us he has to
[1:12:30] choose to come to us we can't go to him
[1:12:33] he has to come to us every single time
[1:12:35] amen God above us in the pillar of fire
[1:12:38] amen his body of light and fire he's
[1:12:41] there he's visible but he's not really
[1:12:43] obtainable to us amen then we have God
[1:12:46] With Us by the way of the man Jesus
[1:12:48] Christ and it's God With Us it's not God
[1:12:51] the son it is God dwelling in a body of
[1:12:56] Flesh amen God through that Son of God
[1:13:00] that Crea body we could see him we could
[1:13:02] feel him we could hear him we could
[1:13:04] smell him we could we could we could go
[1:13:06] bug him if we
[1:13:07] wanted and then we could find him he was
[1:13:10] accessible we could come to him easily
[1:13:11] in our flesh if we lived in that day
[1:13:14] access was not hidden from the people
[1:13:16] when it came to Jesus everyone could
[1:13:18] come and talk to him everyone could come
[1:13:19] here and preach everyone could see him
[1:13:20] touch him talk with him have him talk
[1:13:23] back God With Us amen what is it God is
[1:13:26] moving closer and closer to his full
[1:13:28] purpose now he's moving closer and
[1:13:31] closer to the full revealing of himself
[1:13:32] through his word and what is that
[1:13:34] revealing it's that we would be a family
[1:13:37] that we would be in the perfect image of
[1:13:39] God that we'd have perfect relationship
[1:13:41] perfect fellowship with him that we
[1:13:42] would be of the same nature and the same
[1:13:45] form as the
[1:13:48] word that's all he's trying to do is get
[1:13:50] us back to what the word says we are
[1:13:52] amen and so we have God above us God
[1:13:54] With Us but then he says now we've got
[1:13:56] the Holy Spirit and it's God indwelling
[1:13:58] us it's God in us and that is the
[1:14:01] greatest condescension of all because
[1:14:03] now he's living in an imperfect form
[1:14:06] that God in his Holiness in his
[1:14:08] greatness in his power and in his
[1:14:10] majesty could Dain to come down to
[1:14:12] condescend and dwell in you and I is the
[1:14:15] greatest Revelation that you will ever
[1:14:17] have of this word is that is Christ in
[1:14:19] you the hope of glory amen God could
[1:14:21] come to Fallen humanity and under the
[1:14:23] blood of Jesus Christ and by the washing
[1:14:26] of the water of the word he can clean us
[1:14:27] up in our soul so that we could be a
[1:14:30] place a Dwelling Place of God know ye
[1:14:32] not that ye are the temple of God the
[1:14:36] holy spirit amen now we don't have to go
[1:14:39] to him see he was above us and we
[1:14:41] couldn't go to him then he was in Christ
[1:14:43] on this Earth and we could go to him but
[1:14:45] we couldn't be with him all the time now
[1:14:47] he's in us we don't have to go anywhere
[1:14:49] church we don't have to go anywhere he's
[1:14:51] with us all the time we don't have to
[1:14:53] seek him he's already sought us and he's
[1:14:54] found us us and he's living in us I
[1:14:57] don't have to come to church to get in
[1:14:58] the presence of God the presence of God
[1:15:00] is indwelling my life right now and when
[1:15:02] I walk out those doors it does not
[1:15:04] change his indwelling presence and that
[1:15:06] means it doesn't change his power
[1:15:08] doesn't change his sovereignty doesn't
[1:15:10] change his Holiness doesn't change his
[1:15:12] effect when I go out of church I ought
[1:15:13] to live the same life I live in here
[1:15:16] amen he's with us always brother says
[1:15:19] now we're getting where mzc is he says
[1:15:22] that's this mysterious person in the
[1:15:24] beginning was the word the word was with
[1:15:26] God and the Word was God and then the
[1:15:28] word became flesh and dwelt Among Us he
[1:15:30] says hold that there now notice his
[1:15:32] first being was Spirit God Supernatural
[1:15:35] I'll write the great Eternal he says
[1:15:37] second he began to form himself towards
[1:15:40] flesh he didn't say he was flesh he
[1:15:43] formed himself towards flesh in a
[1:15:45] theophany it's called the word a body
[1:15:48] it's towards flesh it's not flesh it's
[1:15:50] God the great spirit in that theophany
[1:15:52] body now taking on a form his b a body
[1:15:55] for himself that can dwell in flesh it's
[1:15:59] not flesh it can be in flesh amen so God
[1:16:02] creates a body of Flesh and then his
[1:16:03] theophany can join into that and now God
[1:16:06] can come down in humanity amen man
[1:16:08] that's the same thing that happened to
[1:16:09] Adam Adam was created in a theophany
[1:16:12] form in the image of God the image of
[1:16:15] God is Not That spirit that great spirit
[1:16:17] it's the image it's a visible shape it's
[1:16:19] a form so Adam was a theophany body a
[1:16:22] Celestial form like God and then God
[1:16:24] took the dirt of the Dust of the earth
[1:16:26] and he formed a flesh body and he threw
[1:16:29] put that spirit and he joined Adam to a
[1:16:31] fleshly perfect body and that was what
[1:16:34] life life on this Earth that's the
[1:16:36] perfect Son of God right
[1:16:38] there so if that's what Adam was then
[1:16:41] how could Christ be any different Adam
[1:16:43] was identified as the Son of God you go
[1:16:46] in the genealogies it says you know Seth
[1:16:49] was the son of Adam who was the son
[1:16:52] of God So Adam was a theophany placed
[1:16:57] into a natural body Christ is the second
[1:17:00] Adam what is he is the theophany of God
[1:17:03] in a natural body it's simple it's so
[1:17:05] simple
[1:17:07] amen he says this then is the state he
[1:17:10] was in when he met Abraham was called
[1:17:12] melkisedek he was in the form of a
[1:17:14] theophany he was the word it was a body
[1:17:17] there that God had created we'll touch
[1:17:18] on in a second he says he reveals
[1:17:20] himself in his great form of what he
[1:17:23] claimed he says as he imorph himself
[1:17:27] into his servants and proves himself oh
[1:17:29] my goodness
[1:17:31] servants not just bodies now he's
[1:17:33] talking about people God can come down
[1:17:36] and dwell in people and reveal himself
[1:17:37] the same way he did through mzc and the
[1:17:39] same way he did through Christ he says
[1:17:41] you know here he is in the form of a
[1:17:43] spirit he's brother Ram's drawing some
[1:17:45] different things out he says in the
[1:17:46] pillar of fire then he comes in the form
[1:17:48] of a morphe in a body now he appeared to
[1:17:51] Abraham IM morphe when Abraham was
[1:17:53] returning from the slaughter of the
[1:17:54] Kings here comes melkisedek and talk to
[1:17:57] him he says now the difference between
[1:17:59] you and him and you as a son he's saying
[1:18:02] here's the difference between God and
[1:18:05] you as a child of God he says see he was
[1:18:10] at the beginning the word an in morphe
[1:18:12] body he came in and lived in that in the
[1:18:15] person of melkisedek then later we never
[1:18:18] hear any more of mzc because he who
[1:18:22] Christ Living in him God living in him
[1:18:25] became Jesus
[1:18:28] Christ it's not that that body became
[1:18:30] Jesus Christ it was the revealing of God
[1:18:33] went from mzc a priest into Christ the
[1:18:38] priest that could mediate for us amen he
[1:18:42] says mzc was the priest but he became
[1:18:44] Jesus Christ in other words mzc was the
[1:18:47] theophany of God the body of God now
[1:18:49] expressed in flesh but that was in a
[1:18:51] perfect body it was in a created body
[1:18:54] amen that mzc was not born the way that
[1:18:56] Christ was born he was not born of a
[1:18:59] woman amen but he was spoken into
[1:19:01] existence by God God dwelt in it whereas
[1:19:03] Christ was born of a woman no DNA of her
[1:19:06] in him but born through the birth
[1:19:08] process that we have amen he grew up as
[1:19:11] a child amen but mzc was a spoken word
[1:19:14] body for God to dwell in amen he says
[1:19:17] now you bypass
[1:19:19] that because of sin you couldn't go
[1:19:22] theophany into here because your coming
[1:19:24] into a sinful body a theophany cannot be
[1:19:27] joined to a sinful body that's why it's
[1:19:29] waiting there it's waiting for this body
[1:19:30] to be redeemed cleared cleaned and then
[1:19:34] it gets joined and now we've got a
[1:19:36] glorified body so what we have is we
[1:19:38] have a spirit that gets joined to a
[1:19:40] physical body at the moment of birth
[1:19:43] that's all we have we skip our theophany
[1:19:44] we don't and he says he says because in
[1:19:46] that form he knew all things and you
[1:19:48] have never been able to know that yet
[1:19:51] why couldn't Adam be fooled church
[1:19:54] because he knew all things he was the
[1:19:56] word made flesh himself now Eve comes
[1:19:59] out of him and it's a
[1:20:03] portion right she doesn't know all
[1:20:06] things she doesn't know all things and
[1:20:09] it's just a representation of us we
[1:20:10] don't know all things we taken out she
[1:20:13] skipped the
[1:20:15] theophany cuz God separated Adam
[1:20:17] internally and he took out the feminine
[1:20:20] portion and he placed it in a woman but
[1:20:22] she didn't have that mindset before that
[1:20:24] Adam did Adam knew where he was before
[1:20:27] Adam had an understanding where he was
[1:20:28] that's why Christ could say before
[1:20:30] Abraham was I am because he could have a
[1:20:33] memory of it because it was God himself
[1:20:34] dwelling in him Adam had a
[1:20:37] representation before he ever came in
[1:20:38] this earth and it was in a theophonic
[1:20:40] body a theophany body amen but we
[1:20:43] couldn't do that we're meant to be born
[1:20:44] sinless imp Perfection and that would
[1:20:47] mean that we had a a recognition that we
[1:20:48] come from God and now we're here and
[1:20:50] it's God it's it's the nature of God
[1:20:52] that's dwelling in US amen we were meant
[1:20:54] to have that theop body joining to a
[1:20:56] perfect body and we would be living here
[1:20:58] in what we call glorified
[1:20:59] bodies Adam was living in a glorified
[1:21:02] body and the minute he sinned he lost
[1:21:05] it amen but because of sin we bypassed
[1:21:08] that and now we're in a Redemption
[1:21:10] process to take us back to those things
[1:21:12] and so when we're changed in a moment in
[1:21:14] the twinkling of an eye as the scripture
[1:21:15] says our bodies are changed this fleshly
[1:21:18] body is now what redeemed amen it's
[1:21:21] cleaned up God just separates all the
[1:21:23] sin out of it amen and that's joined
[1:21:25] with our theophany body that Celestial
[1:21:27] body that's waiting and now we have a
[1:21:28] perfect glorified body and then what it
[1:21:30] is is the celestial the Heavenly joins
[1:21:32] with the Earthly and that's really the
[1:21:34] true Oneness that's a true revelation of
[1:21:36] Oneness is When Heaven and Earth come
[1:21:38] together in Perfection under without sin
[1:21:41] Amen brother R says and when the soul
[1:21:43] leaves the body it takes its journey
[1:21:46] into a place of rest into a body that's
[1:21:48] in the form and shape of this body but
[1:21:50] it isn't this type of body he says
[1:21:52] you'll meet your loved ones you couldn't
[1:21:54] shake their hands you could talk to them
[1:21:55] you could look at them they look just
[1:21:57] like they do here cuz when Peter and
[1:21:59] John and James saw Moses and Elijah they
[1:22:01] recognized them on Mount Transfiguration
[1:22:03] he says but it's a body he says and then
[1:22:06] when that body kind of a Celestial body
[1:22:08] when it returns back to the Earth it
[1:22:10] picks up the substance that it once
[1:22:12] lived in and then it becomes a glorified
[1:22:15] body and that body is the one that we'll
[1:22:17] see the Lord Jesus in his resurrected
[1:22:19] body he quotes the scripture does not
[1:22:21] appear what we shall be said Paul but we
[1:22:23] know that we shall have a body like his
[1:22:25] own glorious body for we shall see him
[1:22:28] as he Isen so a perfect body is a
[1:22:31] glorified body is just the theophany
[1:22:33] joined with the redeemed perfected
[1:22:36] Earthly body and that's what makes it a
[1:22:38] glorified body it's Heaven and Earth
[1:22:39] joining amen it's the word coming to the
[1:22:42] word it's the soul joining with what
[1:22:44] everything else was there in the
[1:22:46] presence of God before this world ever
[1:22:48] began
[1:22:49] amen we're coming to a close talking
[1:22:52] about mzc he says now the true re of
[1:22:54] melkisedek comes into view what he says
[1:22:57] he was God the word before he became
[1:23:02] flesh so he was a theophany he combined
[1:23:04] that theophany into a flesh body of his
[1:23:06] own making spoke it into existence amen
[1:23:11] and interacted with Abram he says God
[1:23:12] the word cuz he had to be no one else
[1:23:14] could be immortal like him see I have
[1:23:16] father and mother you did too Jesus had
[1:23:18] father or mother but this man had no
[1:23:20] father or had no mother Jesus had a time
[1:23:23] he started this man didn't Jesus gave
[1:23:25] his life he says this man couldn't
[1:23:27] because he was life and it's the
[1:23:30] self-same man all the time he says I
[1:23:33] hope God reveals it to you the self-same
[1:23:35] person all the time so God reveals
[1:23:38] himself now to Abraham in the form of a
[1:23:40] king of a priest of a special man and
[1:23:43] now we jump forward in time with Abraham
[1:23:45] and God's dealing with him and God often
[1:23:47] spoke to Abraham in different ways and
[1:23:49] and by way of a dream or a voice and
[1:23:51] these different things and he might not
[1:23:52] see anything but then God would come to
[1:23:55] him in these bodies that look like flesh
[1:23:56] and that were flesh but we see that
[1:23:58] God's coming down now to confirm this
[1:24:00] Covenant with Abraham and God has
[1:24:02] Abraham s sacrificed the different
[1:24:04] animals and then what does God do to
[1:24:05] Abraham he puts him asleep because God's
[1:24:08] coming down to confirm his Covenant
[1:24:10] remember we saw his glory was Grace and
[1:24:12] Truth that's our covenant and with
[1:24:14] Abraham it's Grace God had to take
[1:24:16] Abraham completely out of the equation
[1:24:19] so Abraham goes to sleep and then
[1:24:21] there's a gross Darkness like in the
[1:24:23] original but out of the original we see
[1:24:26] this watch how God comes down cuz he's
[1:24:28] got to do it on his own he says it came
[1:24:30] to pass that when the sun went down and
[1:24:31] it was dark Behold a smoking furnace and
[1:24:34] a burning lamp that passed between those
[1:24:37] pieces now God's revealing himself light
[1:24:40] and fire a consuming fire amen what is
[1:24:45] it it's the pillar of fire it's God and
[1:24:46] light passing through the sacrifices
[1:24:48] confirming his Covenant to Abraham what
[1:24:50] is it it's the word coming to Abraham
[1:24:53] and the word is passing through and
[1:24:55] saying this is my Testament this is my
[1:24:57] Covenant to you Abraham and when Abraham
[1:24:59] wakes up it's a finished work Hallelujah
[1:25:02] when Abraham WS up it's a finished work
[1:25:04] there's no stopping it there's no UND
[1:25:05] doing it amen but listen it's the Lord
[1:25:08] himself appearing to Abraham when you
[1:25:09] read this and just for the sake of time
[1:25:11] I'm not going to do it this morning but
[1:25:12] it says the Lord the Lord the Lord this
[1:25:14] is Jehovah God coming down and he's in
[1:25:17] the form of a pillar of fire and light
[1:25:19] again he was just in the form of a
[1:25:21] priest of a of Flesh
[1:25:25] and so God's just changing his form time
[1:25:27] and time again not a different God the
[1:25:28] same God time and time again and he's
[1:25:31] identified by his name then we jump
[1:25:33] forward just a few more chapters and we
[1:25:36] see God all over again and he's changed
[1:25:38] his appearance all over again and he's
[1:25:40] in a flesh body but it's not the same
[1:25:41] flesh body as
[1:25:43] MDC it says and the Lord the word there
[1:25:46] is Jehovah God himself the self-existing
[1:25:50] one and the Lord Jehovah appeared unto
[1:25:53] Abraham and the Plains of mamory and he
[1:25:55] sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the
[1:25:57] day and he lifted up his eyes and looked
[1:25:59] and lo three Gods stood by him no three
[1:26:03] men flesh he says and when he saw them
[1:26:07] he ran to meet them from the tent door
[1:26:09] and bowed himself towards the ground now
[1:26:11] notice it's three men there's no light
[1:26:13] here there's no fire here there's no
[1:26:15] wings creeping out from under their
[1:26:17] robes this is three men Flesh and Blood
[1:26:20] now we know that two of them are
[1:26:21] destroying Angels but the other one is
[1:26:24] God himself and it's not
[1:26:26] melkisedek it's the Lord in a completely
[1:26:30] different
[1:26:31] revealing and Abraham said my Lord if
[1:26:33] now I have I found favor in thy sight
[1:26:36] pass not away I pray thee from thy
[1:26:37] servant let a little water I pray you be
[1:26:39] fetched and wash your feet and rest
[1:26:41] yourselves under the tree and I will
[1:26:43] fetch a morsel of bread and comfort you
[1:26:45] your hearts after that ye shall pass on
[1:26:47] for therefore are ye come at to your
[1:26:50] servant he says and they said so do as
[1:26:52] thou Hast said and Abraham hasted into
[1:26:54] the tent under Sarah and said make ready
[1:26:57] quickly three measures of fine meal
[1:26:59] knead it and make cakes upon the Hearth
[1:27:01] and Abraham ran into the herd and
[1:27:03] fetched a calf tender and good and gave
[1:27:05] it unto a young man excuse me and he
[1:27:07] hasted to dress it and he took butter
[1:27:10] and milk and the calf which he had
[1:27:11] dressed and set it before them and he
[1:27:14] stood by them under the tree and they
[1:27:15] did eat so they were flesh they could
[1:27:19] eat this is not just theophanes now this
[1:27:21] is not this is an actual flesh body they
[1:27:23] could eat could talk they could interact
[1:27:25] in every way we can you could touch them
[1:27:27] feel them it was God and angels IND
[1:27:29] dwelling flesh exactly like you and
[1:27:32] I and they said unto him where is Sarah
[1:27:35] thy wife and he said behold in the tent
[1:27:39] and he
[1:27:41] said I personal pronoun Jehovah God is
[1:27:46] the one that came down Jehovah God says
[1:27:49] I will certainly return unto thee
[1:27:52] according to the time of life and lo
[1:27:54] Sarah thy wife shall have a son and
[1:27:56] Sarah heard it in the tent which was
[1:27:58] behind him now Abraham and Sarah were
[1:28:00] old and well stricken in age and it
[1:28:02] ceased to be with Sarah after the manner
[1:28:03] of woman therefore Sarah laughed what
[1:28:07] out loud within herself this is an
[1:28:11] internal
[1:28:13] laugh like when one of my boys says he
[1:28:15] can beat me at arm wrestling what do I
[1:28:17] do I laugh
[1:28:19] internally Sarah laughed internally she
[1:28:21] did not say this out loud she didn't
[1:28:22] laugh out loud she didn't go
[1:28:24] she didn't bust out laughing she laughed
[1:28:26] within
[1:28:27] herself saying after I am waxed old
[1:28:30] shall I have pleasure my Lord being
[1:28:32] old and the Lord said unto Abraham
[1:28:36] wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I
[1:28:39] of shy bear a child which am old is
[1:28:41] anything too hard for the Lord at the
[1:28:43] time appointed I personal pronoun will
[1:28:47] return unto thee according to the time
[1:28:49] of life and Sarah shall have a son then
[1:28:51] Sarah denied saying I laugh not for she
[1:28:54] was afraid and he said nay but thou did
[1:28:59] laugh so there's a great mystery here
[1:29:02] God is revealing himself in flesh yet
[1:29:04] again completely different appearance
[1:29:07] how is God in another form how does this
[1:29:10] happen what is it that that makes it
[1:29:13] possible for God to step down and be
[1:29:15] completely unrecognizable in his form
[1:29:17] and yet it's God all over
[1:29:19] again says this he says then what
[1:29:21] happened he says this was God and the
[1:29:23] reason he had become from logos to flesh
[1:29:27] he says how do you he says what happened
[1:29:30] to that 5 minutes before that he was the
[1:29:32] logos it was God above us dwelling in a
[1:29:34] pillar of fire in a theophany he says
[1:29:37] but what did he
[1:29:38] do Church do not limit God he just
[1:29:42] reached over he says now our bodies are
[1:29:44] made out of 16 different elements of the
[1:29:46] world we know that it's made out of
[1:29:47] potach a little calcium petroleum Cosmic
[1:29:49] like atam so forth all bunded together
[1:29:52] it makes this body it comes from the the
[1:29:54] dust of the earth he says now and here
[1:29:57] this great theophany standing there that
[1:29:59] great Jehovah God you know what he said
[1:30:03] he just reached over and got a handful
[1:30:04] of atoms got a little light and poured
[1:30:07] it in like this and went a body and just
[1:30:10] stepped right into it that's all see I I
[1:30:14] love how he says that's all no big deal
[1:30:18] Hallelujah Church where are you at in
[1:30:20] your life this morning what struggles
[1:30:23] are you facing this morning that seemed
[1:30:25] completely impossible compare it to the
[1:30:28] creation of a body in a moment in the
[1:30:31] twinking of an eye and I say to you this
[1:30:33] morning he's a God that can do anything
[1:30:36] we have need of this morning Hallelujah
[1:30:39] he said he says and he just stepped
[1:30:42] right into it that's all said come here
[1:30:43] Gabriel that great Archangel went step
[1:30:45] in that come here Michael the angel has
[1:30:48] right side you step in
[1:30:50] that easy peasy lemon squeezy as the
[1:30:53] kids say no big deal Hallelujah no big
[1:31:00] deal he says God and two angels walked
[1:31:03] down here in human flesh and drank the
[1:31:06] milk from a cow ate the butter out of
[1:31:07] the milk and ate some cornbread and ate
[1:31:09] the Flesh of the calf two angels in God
[1:31:11] the Bible said so he says that's
[1:31:14] mzc it's not the flesh man mzc what is
[1:31:18] it it's the theophany in a body the
[1:31:21] theophany of God in a body he says that
[1:31:23] Abraham met coming from the slaughter of
[1:31:25] the Kings he says that's the Son of God
[1:31:29] he's not saying it's the same flesh he's
[1:31:30] just saying it's the same God dwelling
[1:31:32] in flesh amen because Abraham recognized
[1:31:35] him by Revelation not by sight and he
[1:31:38] compelled him to stay amen what was it
[1:31:41] it was the word of God dwelling in flesh
[1:31:43] how do we know the scripture says it the
[1:31:45] Lord Jehovah God Amen and it keeps
[1:31:47] repeating it but he keeps identifying
[1:31:49] himself by the word he says here's the
[1:31:53] word promise
[1:31:54] and I'm going to do it here's the word
[1:31:57] promise I'm going to do it oh you don't
[1:31:59] think it can be done guess what I'm
[1:32:01] going to do it I I I I I I'm completely
[1:32:06] out of the equation church amen what did
[1:32:09] the word do when it came as we close it
[1:32:12] discerned the thoughts and intents of
[1:32:15] the heart Sarah laughed and she
[1:32:18] doubted and the word said did you laugh
[1:32:24] why did you laugh why are you doubting
[1:32:26] it haven't you seen what I've done all
[1:32:27] along she said no I didn't laugh he says
[1:32:29] no you did
[1:32:31] laugh amen what is it the word does the
[1:32:35] word doesn't discern what is said Church
[1:32:37] the word discerns what is
[1:32:39] thought
[1:32:41] amen when the preaching of the word
[1:32:44] comes it's not what the pastor knows
[1:32:47] it's not what the preacher knows it's
[1:32:49] what the word of God knows amen
[1:32:54] it's not just words it's the living
[1:32:55] thoughts of God it's a revealer of the
[1:32:57] truth that's what God is Hebrews 4:12
[1:33:01] says for the word of God is quick it's
[1:33:05] alive and Powerful that's the saddest
[1:33:08] thing I think when I look at
[1:33:09] denominations today like I said that
[1:33:11] panel of ministers sitting on a platform
[1:33:13] telling people God's not
[1:33:15] alive that's what they were saying
[1:33:17] That's essentially what they're saying
[1:33:18] is that God God lives in his word and he
[1:33:22] stays on the pages
[1:33:24] What a Sad place when Hebrews 4:12 says
[1:33:27] the word of God is
[1:33:29] alive alive in the land of the living if
[1:33:33] we want to put it that way and people
[1:33:35] are saying God's dead he lives in his
[1:33:38] word now he does live in his word but
[1:33:40] his word is where
[1:33:42] what he
[1:33:45] abides amen it's always meant to be in
[1:33:47] flesh it's always meant to be in a body
[1:33:49] it's not meant to stay on pages it's not
[1:33:50] meant to stay in his mind it's not just
[1:33:52] meant to come out of his lips it's
[1:33:53] supposed to be alive he says it's alive
[1:33:55] it's quick and powerful and sharper than
[1:33:58] any two-edged sword piercing even to the
[1:34:00] dividing AER of Soul and Spirit and of
[1:34:03] the joints and Marrow and is a discerner
[1:34:06] of what the thoughts and intents of the
[1:34:10] heart amen God bless you let's stand if
[1:34:12] we would this
[1:34:13] morning church you want to know if the
[1:34:15] word is present it's a discerner of the
[1:34:18] thoughts and intents of the heart amen
[1:34:21] the word looks beyond what I know the
[1:34:23] word looks beyond what the preacher
[1:34:24] knows what the people in the
[1:34:25] congregation know it looks even beyond
[1:34:28] what you know about yourself amen have
[1:34:30] you ever sat in a service and the
[1:34:32] preaching of the word is coming forth
[1:34:34] and you see something about yourself you
[1:34:36] never saw before what is it it's the
[1:34:39] light it's the light of the word
[1:34:40] revealing who you are and it's revealing
[1:34:43] your current condition so it can take
[1:34:45] you out of it to bring you into your
[1:34:47] real condition amen that's why I said
[1:34:49] when we see that church we don't run
[1:34:51] from it we run to it we say God more
[1:34:53] more we're here we might as well deal
[1:34:55] with it amen I don't want to deal with
[1:34:57] it through a right Throne judgment I
[1:34:58] don't want to deal with it through a
[1:34:59] tribulation I want to deal with it now
[1:35:01] because the word is coming to me for a
[1:35:03] reason and it's to get me ready to get
[1:35:05] out of here amen it's the word coming to
[1:35:07] the word it's the Deep coming to the
[1:35:09] Deep what so we can come back into full
[1:35:11] fellowship with God Amen God wants to
[1:35:13] dwell in flesh again God is dwelling in
[1:35:16] flesh again but he wants to have the
[1:35:18] preeminence like he did in Christ Jesus
[1:35:21] amen we'll go there in our next service
[1:35:22] Lord willing amen I want these shackles
[1:35:24] off church I want this flesh gone amen I
[1:35:28] say Lord pour your spirit in this
[1:35:29] morning amen and burn out these things
[1:35:31] that hold us back amen every doubt every
[1:35:36] laugh sometimes we hold God back because
[1:35:38] of that doubt and all he's waiting for
[1:35:40] us to do is get in an atmosphere of

[1:53:35] Lord amen let's
[1:53:38] um well before we sing this
[1:53:42] one um I was just advised that this uh I
[1:53:47] guess around North America around the
[1:53:49] world this is Pastor appreciation
[1:53:53] day uh in my opinion every day should be
[1:53:57] Pastor appreciation day because he's
[1:54:00] god-given isn't he god-given to us and
[1:54:04] uh but we take advantage of the fact
[1:54:06] that it is Pastor appreciation day and
[1:54:09] we just want to give brother
[1:54:12] John and sister
[1:54:15] Blanca uh a little gift of a token of
[1:54:18] our appreciation and our love and for
[1:54:21] all that you've done for us come on up
[1:54:22] Sister Blanca yes
[1:54:26] um see she was called when John was
[1:54:29] called to the
[1:54:30] ministry brother ROM said right so uh I
[1:54:34] always figure that the pastor's wife is
[1:54:36] somewhat the unsung hero you know
[1:54:39] because they're behind the scenes
[1:54:40] supporting him uh supporting the pastor
[1:54:43] when uh things are rough and things
[1:54:46] don't go the way he feels he should be
[1:54:47] going and all that we discussed a little
[1:54:49] bit that this morning so uh uh so she's
[1:54:54] not to be forgotten and certainly don't
[1:54:57] forget to pray for her because she needs
[1:54:59] it to have the wisdom to help him when
[1:55:02] he needs that shoulder so on behalf of
[1:55:05] the church this is a token of our love
[1:55:07] and
[1:55:08] appreciation God bless you brother John
[1:55:10] amen and sister Blanca don't go
[1:55:16] anywhere I did this for my wife once in
[1:55:20] broad daylight and my neighbors Yow what
[1:55:21] did you do
[1:55:23] wrong so uh she didn't do anything wrong
[1:55:27] but she deserves this as well God bless
[1:55:29] you Sister amen praise the Lord yeah
[1:55:33] okay go ahead
[1:55:39] yeah I appreciate that but I was talking
[1:55:42] with brother Paul and sister Kimberly a
[1:55:43] couple nights ago and I just want to say
[1:55:45] how happy we are here how content we are
[1:55:49] amen you are a wonderful wonderful group
[1:55:51] of people there's no Slackers there's no
[1:55:54] problems I mean occasionally there are

[1:55:58] wonderful congregation amen and you're
[1:56:01] growing in God you're growing in Grace
[1:56:03] you're growing in faith and we see God
[1:56:06] moving in your lives and that is the
[1:56:07] greatest thing that's the only thing
[1:56:10] that's the only thing I want to see is
[1:56:12] Christ Living in you I don't want you to
[1:56:14] take on my attitude or my spirit by any
[1:56:16] means amen but we want to see Christ
[1:56:19] Living in this church so from the bottom
[1:56:21] of my heart from the bottom of our house
[1:56:23] I want to say thank you to each and
[1:56:24] every one of us that it supports Us by
[1:56:26] your prayers yes by your tithes and
[1:56:28] offerings but mostly by your presence
[1:56:31] and pulling on the word of God Amen it
[1:56:34] takes a church to make these things
[1:56:37] happen not a pastor not a preacher not a
[1:56:39] minister it takes a full body amen so
[1:56:41] when you come into service and Amen
[1:56:44] brother Bob when you're prayed up amen
[1:56:46] when you're ready you're seeking you're

[1:56:55] believe we've got that here so I say God
[1:56:57] bless you we love and appreciate you all
[1:56:59] and just trust the Lord to continue
[1:57:01] working in your lives that he would fill
[1:57:03] our young people with the the holy
[1:57:05] spirit amen that he would draw back
[1:57:07] those that are lost that are sitting out
[1:57:09] there that he would make their lives so
[1:57:11] miserable so miserable that the only
[1:57:14] hope they have is to come back to the
[1:57:16] thing that they can't seem to stand
[1:57:17] right now amen that the spirit of God
[1:57:19] that went and woed across and brooded
[1:57:22] over the Earth in the beginning would
[1:57:24] come back to those little frames those
[1:57:26] little flesh bodies and he would just
[1:57:28] woo on them until he could bring them
[1:57:29] back into his presence and baptize their
[1:57:32] Spirits their souls with his holy spirit
[1:57:35] amen amen God bless you thank you each
