[15:25] How vast beyond all
[15:31] measure that he should give his only
[15:38] son to make a wretchy's
[15:44] treasure. How great the pain of searing

[21:44] name
[21:46] Lord? When all others
[21:49] forsake, you said you will never leave
[21:51] us nor depart
[21:53] us. No matter our trials, our ups or
[21:57] downs, you have always been
[21:59] there. You sealed us, Lord, and that is
[22:03] what we will boast
[22:05] in. Thank you, Father God, for what you
[22:08] have done, what you continue to do, what
[22:11] you're doing in this church, Lord. What
[22:13] you're doing in our souls, what you're
[22:15] doing through our pastor, Lord. And we
[22:18] pray, Father God, that we hear every
[22:21] idle word that you speak, Lord, because
[22:23] you said there would be a little
[22:28] church. Why not us,
[22:31] Lord? Help us, Father God, to move into
[22:35] position to focus, Father God, and stay
[22:38] in

[22:48] wonderful service in your presence,
[22:50] Lord, we want to take the time and
[22:51] invite you to come.
[22:54] Anything God stresses of the week,
[22:57] anything that might be going on in our
[22:58] lives, Lord, we lay it together as one,
[23:01] Lord, before your feet, pray that you
[23:05] squash it, Father God, that we may enjoy

[23:14] hear, Lord, we put all these people on
[23:17] the prayer list, Lord. We we lay them

[43:35] they have the keys to their home. So, we
[43:37] praise the Lord for that. For giving
[43:38] them their first house here in Canada.
[43:40] So, praise the Lord for that. I wanted
[43:43] to thank the church for all the work and
[43:44] support that went into the meetings this
[43:46] week. Of course, by your attendance, but
[43:48] also the hard work for helping out for
[43:51] the fellowship, the breakfast, the the
[43:53] fellowship on Sunday. uh people that
[43:55] helped me with giving rides to brother
[43:57] Jonathan Martin. Uh the meals that were
[43:59] given even to our family to help out and
[44:01] things like that. So certainly
[44:02] appreciate that. He had a wonderful
[44:03] time. Had nothing but good things to say
[44:05] about the congregation, the worship, the
[44:07] pull on the word, the services. So we're
[44:10] thankful for that. Amen. God bless you
[44:12] each one. Want to wish sister Moren also
[44:14] a happy birthday. Amen. She had her
[44:16] birthday this week. I won't give her
[44:17] age, but uh we thank the Lord that he's
[44:20] brought her through another year and
[44:21] trusting he'll bless her in the coming
[44:23] year as well. Amen. God bless you. 2
[44:26] Timothy 1:7 says this. We've been
[44:28] reading this a lot and we're going to
[44:30] continue to dig into it. Amen. For God
[44:32] had not given us the spirit of fear, but
[44:35] of power and of love and of a sound
[44:38] mind. Amen. God bless you. You can have
[44:40] your seats this evening. I want to
[44:42] continue our thought on on uh on the the
[44:44] the life of the Holy Spirit in us. And
[44:46] we're continuing this thought on no room
[44:48] for fear. And I certainly felt like I
[44:50] could just pick up right where brother
[44:51] Jonathan Martin left off this past
[44:53] weekend with some of the things we'll be
[44:55] speaking on. Amen. And he said some
[44:57] things that just kind of provided a nice
[44:59] stepping off point. But I've always said
[45:00] the hardest service to preach is the one
[45:02] after special services because the
[45:04] special speaker is gone and now it's
[45:06] just the pastor. Used to be I was the
[45:08] special speaker, now I'm just the
[45:10] pastor. Amen. But I believe that uh we
[45:12] want to always continue in that
[45:14] atmosphere. And sometimes we want to
[45:15] continue in that preaching style and
[45:17] those different things. But I was
[45:19] telling brother Jonathan how much I
[45:20] appreciated his preaching because he
[45:22] didn't just get up here and try and rah
[45:23] rah. It was scripture after scripture.
[45:26] It was quote after quote, laying the
[45:27] word in, laying the word in. And that's
[45:29] what I look for in a preacher. Amen.
[45:31] Because we've got to have a foundation
[45:32] for our experience. Amen. We've got to
[45:34] have a foundation for our lives. Amen.
[45:36] We've got to have a foundation for our
[45:38] decisions, a foundation for our faith.
[45:40] And Paul said, "I can lay no foundation
[45:42] than that which is laid, which is Christ
[45:44] Jesus." Amen. The cornerstone. And I
[45:46] believe that's what we got this this
[45:47] this last weekend. Amen. The feeling
[45:49] won't keep you. The emotion won't keep
[45:52] you. The chills and goosebumps won't
[45:54] feel you keep you. The tears won't keep
[45:56] you. Amen. It is the spirit of God
[45:58] inside you pointing you back to it is
[46:01] written that will keep you no matter
[46:03] what changes. Amen. Because things will
[46:05] change. Life will come at us.
[46:06] Circumstances come at us. Amen. But it's
[46:08] the it is written. It is the word, the
[46:10] engrafted word inside of us. That's what
[46:12] holds us when everything else falls
[46:14] away. Amen. So, we're trusting in those
[46:16] things. Amen. But I want to take a bit
[46:18] of a step back this evening and we're
[46:20] talking about no room for fear. And
[46:22] whenever we talk about fear, we have to
[46:24] talk about faith because they are they
[46:26] are two opposing forces in this world.
[46:28] And one of them comes from one source
[46:29] and the other comes from another source.
[46:31] Amen. And so they have two very
[46:34] different sources and they have two very
[46:36] different effects. And so I want to take
[46:37] us back to where fear came from. Because
[46:40] if we know where fear came from, we know
[46:41] where it ought to go. If we know who
[46:44] it's from, then that means we need to
[46:45] know whether we need to listen to it or
[46:47] or or or go with it or whether we can
[46:49] push it back. And we go into the
[46:51] scriptures, we go into Genesis. Genesis
[46:53] is the C chap is a C book. You can find
[46:55] everything there is to find in Genesis.
[46:58] The attitudes, the the the ideas, the
[47:01] doctrines, the thoughts, it's all there.
[47:03] whether it's of God or whether it's of
[47:04] Satan, you we we find it all inside of
[47:06] Genesis. And this is speaking now of
[47:08] Adam and Eve. And it says, "And they
[47:10] heard the voice of the Lord God walking
[47:12] in the garden in the cool of the day.
[47:14] And Adam and his wife did something they
[47:16] had never done before. They hid
[47:19] themselves from the presence of the Lord
[47:22] God amongst the trees of the garden. And
[47:25] the Lord God called unto Adam, and he
[47:27] said unto him, "Where art thou?" And he
[47:29] said, "I heard thy voice in the garden
[47:32] and I was afraid because I was naked and
[47:37] I hid myself." Now to most of us that
[47:39] seems completely
[47:41] normal. But you have to understand
[47:43] something that Adam had always been in
[47:45] that condition and he'd never hidden
[47:47] himself before. So something has changed
[47:49] with Adam. And we see here that fear is
[47:51] mentioned for the first time in the
[47:53] scripture and we see some attributes
[47:55] that we can assign to fear as we go
[47:57] through this. And the first thing that
[47:59] fear does is that fear pulls you away
[48:02] from God. Fear does not drive you to
[48:05] God. Fear pulls you away from the
[48:07] presence of God. The first time that
[48:09] fear was felt, it caused Adam and Eve to
[48:11] hide themselves from God, to actively
[48:14] give themselves away from his presence.
[48:17] It pulled them away. Amen. In other
[48:20] words, fear takes you away from family,
[48:23] from relationship, from position, from
[48:26] authority.
[48:27] It takes you away from everything of God
[48:29] and it takes you really into self. Amen.
[48:32] Amen. And and remember we read in Romans
[48:35] 8, we've read this a number of times. It
[48:36] says, "For you have not received the
[48:38] spirit of bondage again to fear, but
[48:40] you've received the spirit of adoption
[48:42] whereby whereby we cry aba father." In
[48:45] other words, the spirit of God inside of
[48:47] you will cause you to go towards your
[48:49] father, towards God, towards the word,
[48:52] not pull you away from it. Amen. That
[48:55] Holy Spirit is the very life of God. And
[48:57] it pulls you back to him. And therefore,
[48:59] we have to conclude something that might
[49:01] seem obvious, but we've got to say it.
[49:03] Fear is not from
[49:06] God. I want to say that again. Fear is
[49:09] not from God. The very time we see fear,
[49:13] it did not come from God. It did not
[49:14] pull them to God. Amen. Now, there is a
[49:17] fear of God and that is based on
[49:20] reverent fear and respect. It's reverent
[49:24] respect for God. It is not fear that
[49:26] takes you out of his presence. It's it's
[49:28] a fear. It's a respect that draws you
[49:30] into his presence and causes you to obey
[49:33] what he says to do. If we look in
[49:36] Proverbs, it says the fear of the Lord
[49:38] is the beginning of wisdom. And the
[49:40] knowledge of the holy is is
[49:43] understanding. In other words, the
[49:45] respect of God, the re the reverent awe
[49:47] of God brings you into proper
[49:50] understanding and wisdom. It'll guide
[49:52] you right. Amen. But it will not keep
[49:54] you from him, but rather it'll draw you
[49:57] to him. Amen. But when we look at the
[49:59] fear that showed up in Genesis 3, it was
[50:02] not fear that drew them to God. It was
[50:04] not fear that caused them to have the
[50:06] wisdom of God, but rather it brought
[50:08] them shame and it brought them
[50:11] embarrassment and that pushed them away
[50:13] from the presence of God. Why? Because
[50:16] they had disobeyed. Amen. Okay. If we
[50:19] look at what they said in ver in Genesis
[50:21] 3, it said, "And he heard thy voice in
[50:23] the garden and I was afraid because I
[50:24] was naked and I hid myself." But if we
[50:26] go literally the last verse of the last
[50:29] chapter before it says, "And they were
[50:31] both naked." And the man and his wife
[50:34] and they were not ashamed. So what
[50:36] happened, church? Did their condition
[50:40] change? Nothing changed about their
[50:42] condition. They were naked before,
[50:44] they're naked after. So, their condition
[50:47] hasn't changed, but what's happened is
[50:49] they've heard a lie from Satan. They've
[50:52] accepted it. And when they acted on that
[50:55] lie, it changed what they thought about
[50:58] themselves. And what they thought about
[51:00] themselves was a lie compared to what
[51:02] God had told them. And it kept them now
[51:05] out of the presence of God. Amen.
[51:07] They've listened to somebody besides
[51:09] God. And it has changed their opinion
[51:12] about themselves. It has changed their
[51:13] awareness about themselves. What was it?
[51:16] The word had protected them from shame
[51:18] because they were living by the word
[51:20] which meant they had nothing to be
[51:21] ashamed about. They were made in the
[51:23] image of God. They were made in the
[51:25] glory of God and there was nothing to be
[51:27] ashamed about. But when Eve listened to
[51:29] Satan, now she had something to be
[51:31] ashamed about because she got a
[51:32] revelation. But it wasn't a revelation
[51:34] of the purity of the word. It was a
[51:36] revelation of her own brokenness and her
[51:38] own failings because she tried to do
[51:40] something on her own. and it took her
[51:43] out of the presence of God. Listen to
[51:45] this. He says, this is a quote. He says,
[51:47] "Don't fear. Fear is of the devil." He
[51:52] says, "Everything Jesus would say, fear
[51:55] not. Fear not." Constantly fear not.
[51:57] Fear not. Is that right? Right. He says
[51:59] it's always fear not. He says, "Now God
[52:02] doesn't want you to fear. He wants you
[52:05] to
[52:06] believe." What brought
[52:08] fear?
[52:10] Unbelief. Unbelief. Amen. Action. And
[52:13] what did that unbelief do? It brought
[52:14] them into action that was contrary to
[52:16] the word. And what happened? It started
[52:18] in here and it came out here. I love
[52:22] what brother Jonathan Martin said this
[52:23] weekend. He said, "Your influence will
[52:26] tell on you." And what happened is her
[52:28] influence started to tell on Eve because
[52:31] what? She started to act on what the
[52:33] influence told her and it revealed
[52:36] itself. And what did it reveal itself
[52:38] through? Shame and fear. separation from
[52:41] the presence of God. Voluntary
[52:43] separation from the presence of God to
[52:45] make it even worse. Amen. So if you're
[52:47] scared, if you're fearful, if you're
[52:49] worried, if you're anxious, that is not
[52:51] of God. Jesus said, "Be anxious for
[52:56] nothing." Nothing. We're going to talk
[52:59] about some absolutes this evening. Jesus
[53:00] said, "Be anxious for nothing." Don't
[53:03] worry about a single thing. Nothing.
[53:07] Amen. Why? Because the source of fear is
[53:10] unbelief that comes by accepting a lie
[53:12] from Satan. Amen. The source of fear is
[53:15] accepting a lie from Satan. I want you,
[53:18] if you get nothing else tonight, get
[53:20] that. That fear is accepting a lie from
[53:23] Satan. And when you accept that, then
[53:25] fear can follow in behind it. Because
[53:27] fear comes from what? Listening to that
[53:30] wrong influence, from that wrong idea,
[53:32] that wrong person. And it takes you away
[53:35] from the full and true word of God.
[53:38] Remember, Satan's lie was mostly true
[53:40] except he added one word. He was
[53:43] repeating the word, but he added that
[53:44] one thing in and he turned a positive
[53:46] into a negative.
[53:48] That's it. He just flipped it. But he
[53:50] was quoting almost the entire word.
[53:52] Amen. So if the if fear comes by
[53:55] listening to a lie from Satan, then what
[53:57] is the antidote to fear? Listen to the
[54:00] truth from God. Just go opposite with
[54:03] it. What's the opposite of Satan? What's
[54:05] it's God? What's the opposite of a lie?
[54:07] Truth. So, if you'll listen to the truth
[54:10] from the right influence, it'll take
[54:11] fear out of your life. But the thing is,
[54:13] you've got to conquer the unbelief by
[54:15] faith. That's the only way that this is
[54:17] going to work. And we'll we'll get into
[54:19] that this this evening. Amen. By God's
[54:21] grace. Amen. So, notice now the spirit
[54:24] of fear pointed to their condition. The
[54:26] spirit of fear pointed to their
[54:29] nakedness. And we know that the original
[54:31] sin was. And so we know that their
[54:33] nakedness was tied to sin now and it
[54:36] caused him to be shamed. So if that's
[54:38] what Satan does and he points to your
[54:40] condition and he points to your failure,
[54:42] what will the spirit of God do? He can't
[54:45] point to us cuz we're not going to make
[54:47] it. Our strength is not enough. Our
[54:49] failures are going to get in our way. So
[54:52] it's got to point to something else. And
[54:53] that's what we read in our opening
[54:55] scripture where he said, "For God has
[54:57] not given us a spirit of fear." Let me
[54:59] say this. The spirit of fear is that
[55:00] which which looks to it to yourself.
[55:03] Your fear comes when you can't do it.
[55:07] That's where it comes from. And that's
[55:09] why we start to worry is because things
[55:11] are taken beyond our power, beyond our
[55:13] control, that are taken beyond our
[55:15] ability to manage the situation. It's
[55:17] beyond us. And so we start to fear. He
[55:19] says God has not given us that spirit,
[55:23] but he's given us a different spirit. He
[55:25] says it's a spirit of power, a spirit of
[55:28] love, and a spirit of a sound mind. Now,
[55:31] let me ask you something tonight. Which
[55:33] of us we could say is an example of a
[55:36] spirit of
[55:38] power? Who's the strongest in the room?
[55:42] Brother Kingsley,
[55:46] maybe. Would we point to him and say,
[55:48] "He's got a spirit of power. He's the
[55:51] strongest of all of us.
[55:54] biggest
[55:57] muscles. But would we say that what he
[56:00] has is enough to conquer any
[56:02] situation? I'm afraid not, brother
[56:04] Kings, that you'd be weighed in the
[56:05] balance and found wanting just like the
[56:07] rest of us.
[56:10] Amen. What about as an example of
[56:12] love? We've got some tremendous
[56:15] Christians
[56:16] here. But how many of us would put our
[56:19] hand up and say, "I'll be an example of
[56:21] the spirit of love.
[56:24] In
[56:26] everything, the hands would come down
[56:28] and it would start with the oldest and
[56:30] it' go all the way to the youngest
[56:32] because we know that even if we've never
[56:34] acted in certain ways, we've still
[56:36] thought it. We still had the attitude.
[56:38] We've still had a a conversation with
[56:40] our spouse that nobody else heard about
[56:42] that person. We've still gone before God
[56:45] and we've grumbled and
[56:47] complained. We've still reacted badly.
[56:50] Nobody else may know it, but we know it.
[56:51] And so, the hands come down. What about
[56:53] of a sound mind? Listen, I've got a
[56:55] pretty good sound mind. Would I throw my
[56:56] hat in the ring? Sound mind speaks to
[57:00] moderation,
[57:03] self-control? I'm known for that. But
[57:07] would I say I have the power of
[57:09] self-control? No. I remember one time I
[57:12] came home. I'd just been at the gym.
[57:13] Nobody was home. My wife had not
[57:15] prepared supper the way she usually did.
[57:16] I was hungry. You know what I did? I ate
[57:18] six Oreos.
[57:21] Where was my self-control that day? Gone
[57:24] in the face of my
[57:26] need. So, none of us can stand here as
[57:29] an example of power and love and a sound
[57:32] mind. But yet, Paul says, I'm going to
[57:34] point you to a spirit of power, of love
[57:36] and a sound mind. What's he saying? He's
[57:38] saying, don't look at your condition.
[57:40] You got to look at something beyond your
[57:42] condition. This is not about my
[57:44] strength. It's not about your power.
[57:46] It's not about our love one for another.
[57:48] It's got to be something that's beyond
[57:50] us. That's what the spirit of God does.
[57:53] Satan points to our condition when it
[57:55] suits
[57:57] him. You'll notice Satan will tell you,
[58:00] "You're more than enough." When he wants
[58:02] you to fail, and then he'll tell you
[58:04] when you're going up against him, you're
[58:05] never enough. When he wants to get you
[58:07] out of position, he says, "You can do
[58:09] this on your own." And he wants to keep
[58:10] his position, he says, "You're not
[58:12] enough for me." Satan flip-flops. He
[58:14] can't make up his mind whether we're
[58:15] conquerors or
[58:16] losers. And the thing is, if we listen
[58:18] closely, we'll find him going that way
[58:21] back and forth. Because the minute you
[58:22] stand on the word, you're a loser. But
[58:24] the minute you do what he wants, then
[58:26] you're a winner. He's trying to get us
[58:28] off by looking at ourselves all the
[58:30] time.
[58:32] Amen. Paul's not pointing to our
[58:34] condition. Paul's pointing to somebody
[58:36] else. Paul's pointing to something else.
[58:39] And it's something that has power. It's
[58:40] something that has love. It's something
[58:42] that has a sound mind. Amen. That's why
[58:44] Paul says we need to receive the spirit
[58:45] of God is because in ourselves we're not
[58:47] going to win it. We're not going to do
[58:49] it. We can't do it. Listen, we've had
[58:51] some wonderful services over this
[58:52] weekend, but it's not going to be me
[58:54] that gets me through. It's not going to
[58:55] be you that gets us through. We've got
[58:57] to receive a spirit that takes us out of
[58:59] fear and brings us into faith. Amen. And
[59:01] that's what the spirit of God is here to
[59:03] do. He's there to take me from where I
[59:05] am to where he is. To where I am and
[59:08] what his word says. That's what the
[59:09] spirit of God is there to do. He's there
[59:11] to close the gap so that we can come out
[59:13] of our humanity and we can step into
[59:15] deity. That's what he's here to do.
[59:18] Amen. He's trying to take us to what he
[59:20] wants us to be. Paul says it so
[59:22] beautifully. He says, "We have this
[59:24] treasure." Now, the word there is
[59:26] actually treasury. We have this
[59:28] treasury. It means a storehouse where
[59:30] good and precious and valuable things
[59:32] are stored. So, in other words, the
[59:34] value of a treasury is not the treasury.
[59:37] It's what's in the treasury.
[59:40] Okay. So, we have this treasury in
[59:42] earthn vessels, in clay vessels, in
[59:45] pottery. No metals in this
[59:48] scripture. Sorry, I didn't move this
[59:53] forward. I think, give me a second.
[59:56] There we go. Yeah, we have this treasure
[59:57] in earth and
[59:59] vessels, clay
[1:00:01] vessels. If any of you have ever dropped
[1:00:05] a clay pot, what happens when you drop
[1:00:07] it?
[1:00:09] Even if it's on on carpet, you might get
[1:00:11] lucky. Really thick carpet. But if it
[1:00:13] drops on anything other than a well-
[1:00:15] padded surface, it shatters every time.
[1:00:18] There's no resilience in
[1:00:21] clay. It breaks on impact. Now, you make
[1:00:25] something out of metal, you drop it, it
[1:00:27] might ding, it might dent, it might bend
[1:00:28] a bit, but it doesn't break easy. But
[1:00:31] clay, clay breaks. If you put clay in a
[1:00:34] sudden change of temperature, it breaks.
[1:00:38] Paul's speaking here of the fragility of
[1:00:40] us. We're earthn vessels. We're clay.
[1:00:43] We're pottery vessels. They're not known
[1:00:45] for strength. They're not known for
[1:00:47] their resilience. Amen. He says we have
[1:00:50] this treasury in earthn vessels. Amen.
[1:00:53] He says, why? That the excellency of the
[1:00:56] power may be of God and not of us. When
[1:01:00] he speaks of excellency, it means the
[1:01:02] beyond measure, the exceeding, the
[1:01:05] abundant. In other words, it's far more
[1:01:08] than we could ever be in ourselves
[1:01:09] because we are just earththing vessels.
[1:01:12] He's saying you're built in a way so
[1:01:15] that when our life turns out good, we
[1:01:18] can't take the credit cuz we know that
[1:01:21] if it were left up to us, we'd break and
[1:01:23] shatter at the smallest of events.
[1:01:26] Okay? So all of this, we're just a
[1:01:29] treasury and we're good because of what
[1:01:32] has been placed in us, not because of
[1:01:34] who we are in and of ourselves.
[1:01:37] Amen. But you'll never see God pointing
[1:01:39] at us as the limitation. That's the
[1:01:41] beauty of this. He's saying, listen, you
[1:01:45] are nothing to be talking about. You're
[1:01:48] weak. You're
[1:01:50] frail. Praise the Lord. He says, "That's
[1:01:53] so that you know that when it all works
[1:01:56] out for your good, it's because I was in
[1:01:58] you, not because you were in you." Amen.
[1:02:01] That's what he's trying to do. He's
[1:02:03] trying to get us back to trusting him
[1:02:06] fully.
[1:02:08] Amen. But you'll never see God limiting
[1:02:10] us based on our
[1:02:13] limitations. It's never based on our
[1:02:16] failures and flaws. That doesn't stop
[1:02:19] him.
[1:02:20] that doesn't slow him down and that
[1:02:23] doesn't remove us from
[1:02:25] consideration. It never enters into
[1:02:27] God's mind to look at our condition as
[1:02:30] some sort of prerequisite for him to use
[1:02:32] us. Quite the contrary, in fact. Amen.
[1:02:34] We are chosen in our weakness. You look
[1:02:37] at when God came to Gideon and he calls
[1:02:39] Gideon now a mighty man of valor. Gideon
[1:02:44] is a coward hiding and he's he's
[1:02:47] threshing grain in a wine press and he's
[1:02:50] doing that because it wasn't the season
[1:02:51] of grapes so nobody would look in the
[1:02:53] wine presses for him to do for for
[1:02:56] anything that would be good. So he's
[1:02:57] hiding out from the from the Midionites
[1:02:59] threshing his grain there. God comes up
[1:03:01] and says, "Oh Gideon, thou mighty man of
[1:03:03] valor." And Gileian Gideon says,
[1:03:05] "Listen, my tribe is the least of the
[1:03:08] tribes. My family is the least of the
[1:03:11] families and I'm the least person of all
[1:03:13] the persons in my family. And God says,
[1:03:15] "Perfect. That's just what I'm looking
[1:03:18] for." Not only looking for, cuz this is
[1:03:20] not a volunteer position. I've chosen
[1:03:23] you, Gideon. I've chosen you. That's the
[1:03:26] way that God works in these things.
[1:03:27] Amen. Listen to this. He says, "Here is
[1:03:30] something to console us." You want some
[1:03:32] consolation this evening? Here it is.
[1:03:34] Here is something that encourages. Out
[1:03:36] of weakness and humility, God chooses
[1:03:39] the people to build his kingdom out of.
[1:03:42] We ought to say amen to that.
[1:03:43] Hallelujah. Out of what? Weakness and
[1:03:46] humility. He says if we ever get to
[1:03:49] heaven, if we ever stand in the presence
[1:03:51] of God with his church, we'll stand as a
[1:03:54] bunch of people that have been weak and
[1:03:55] rejected and cast out by the world and
[1:03:58] know what nothings. He says, "Isn't it
[1:04:00] strange that God likened us to sheep? A
[1:04:03] sheep is the most helpless thing there
[1:04:06] is. You know, the scripture says all we
[1:04:09] like sheep have gone astray. We've all
[1:04:12] left the shepherd. We've all gone out on
[1:04:14] our own. He says there's nothing so
[1:04:16] insufficient of defense than the sheep.
[1:04:19] A rabbit can run. A squirrel can get in
[1:04:21] a tree. A dog can bite. A lion can tear.
[1:04:23] A horse can kick. A bird can fly. But a
[1:04:25] sheep stands
[1:04:27] helpless. You know, this struck me just
[1:04:30] now. You know, the only thing that can
[1:04:32] protect a
[1:04:33] sheep, lots and lots and lots of
[1:04:38] wool. Have you ever seen they they this
[1:04:40] has happened a number of times now where
[1:04:42] a sheep got away and it went out in the
[1:04:44] wild and it survived long enough that
[1:04:46] the wool that it that it grew completely
[1:04:49] enveloped its body. You you couldn't
[1:04:52] really see anything except two four
[1:04:53] hooves on the bottom and a little bit of
[1:04:55] a mouth and nose coming out the front.
[1:04:57] You couldn't even see the eyes. All of
[1:04:59] the wool had surrounded it and hardened
[1:05:01] up to where nothing could kill that
[1:05:03] sheep. The only protection you'd have is
[1:05:06] the fruit of the spirit being so big
[1:05:07] nothing can get to you. That's the only
[1:05:09] thing they've got is to be a sheep. Be
[1:05:12] be a maximum sheep. Be the the greatest
[1:05:14] wool producing sheep that there is. And
[1:05:16] when they shaved it, I think there was
[1:05:18] something like 70 pounds of wool on a 50
[1:05:21] lb
[1:05:22] sheep. That's all it was was just wool.
[1:05:25] And how happy he was when he finally got
[1:05:27] rid of that. cold but
[1:05:30] happy. He says, "And that's the way God
[1:05:32] wants us. Realize that we are totally
[1:05:36] insufficient." Then God takes that
[1:05:40] person, the insufficient ones, the ones
[1:05:44] that need grace, and he begins to mold
[1:05:48] himself into that person. He says, "And
[1:05:52] make his hands do what God would have
[1:05:54] his hands to do. to make his lips speak
[1:05:56] what God's lips would speak because
[1:05:58] they're not his. They're God's. He
[1:06:01] begins to build a character, begins to
[1:06:04] take this weakness and to make his own
[1:06:07] self. That's why God wants weak people
[1:06:10] because strong people fight the process.
[1:06:13] Strong people think they don't need the
[1:06:15] process. Strong people try and keep
[1:06:17] themselves as part of the process. And
[1:06:19] he's saying here, no, God wants you
[1:06:21] completely insufficient. So you say,
[1:06:23] "I'll take anything you give me cuz it's
[1:06:26] better than what I'm bringing to the
[1:06:27] table." And the hard thing is sometimes
[1:06:29] we got to be knocked off our high horse
[1:06:31] to get there. Paul certainly was. Moses
[1:06:33] certainly was. I've been listening to
[1:06:35] the message Paul a
[1:06:37] prisoner. And he talks about Moses
[1:06:40] thought he could do it on his own. He
[1:06:43] said, "And God had to take him out on
[1:06:44] the backside of the desert and beat out
[1:06:47] every bit of the idea that he had
[1:06:50] something to offer.
[1:06:53] Church, if there's one thing we've got
[1:06:54] to get rid of, it's the farce of human
[1:06:57] ability. As a Christian, you're not a
[1:07:00] Christian, have at it. But as a
[1:07:02] Christian, our human ability will get us
[1:07:05] nowhere in the kingdom of God. Amen. It
[1:07:08] is a total and complete farce. And
[1:07:10] that's why there's got to be a dying
[1:07:11] out. I love what Brother Jonathan said
[1:07:13] this past weekend. He says, "The spirit
[1:07:14] of revival is a daily dying out." I
[1:07:17] thought that was absolutely tremendous.
[1:07:19] Lord, keep me out of it so you can be
[1:07:21] the one that's in it. What a beautiful
[1:07:22] thought we had. Amen. So, what does God
[1:07:25] do then? He begins to build a character,
[1:07:27] begins to take this weakness and to make
[1:07:30] his own self in it. Amen. The first
[1:07:32] thing God has to do with do is deal with
[1:07:35] our fear. That's the first thing he has
[1:07:36] to do. And you think about it, we can
[1:07:38] take it back to the scripture because
[1:07:39] what does he do to deal with our fear?
[1:07:41] He gives us the antidote. Faith. It's
[1:07:44] the first thing he does. Remember what
[1:07:46] Paul said. He says, "For by grace are ye
[1:07:48] saved through
[1:07:49] faith." He says, "And that is not of
[1:07:52] yourself. It is the gift of God." Amen.
[1:07:55] We're born under a spirit of bondage, a
[1:07:58] spirit of fear. Paul made it very clear.
[1:08:00] The very anointing that was on Christ
[1:08:02] was to take us out from what fear had
[1:08:04] brought us into. Absolutely 100%. The
[1:08:07] thing is, babies are born fearless. Did
[1:08:09] you notice
[1:08:11] that? They don't have any fear when
[1:08:13] they're born. Yes, they're screaming and
[1:08:15] they're crying, but it's not a fear.
[1:08:17] It's a change. But babies aren't scared
[1:08:20] of lions and tigers and gunshots and
[1:08:23] falling off the
[1:08:25] bed. They're not scared of where their
[1:08:27] next meal's coming from. They have no
[1:08:29] worries. They're in the moment. But the
[1:08:32] older they get, we teach them to fear
[1:08:35] because what? Fear keeps them
[1:08:38] alive. That's what it does. Scientists
[1:08:41] will say it's an evolutionary thing.
[1:08:42] fear. It keeps us alive. Amen. But we're
[1:08:45] not here to learn fear. We're here to
[1:08:47] unlearn fear. We're here to learn faith.
[1:08:49] Amen. So that it because it's only by
[1:08:52] having faith that we can step into what
[1:08:54] God has for us. Amen. God defeats fear
[1:08:56] by faith. And that faith, the scripture
[1:08:58] says, is a gift from God to us. It's a
[1:09:00] it's a love gift to us, if I can put it
[1:09:03] that way. Abraham says there are only
[1:09:05] two faculties that govern a human. One
[1:09:08] of them is faith, which brings results.
[1:09:12] He says, "And the other is fear which
[1:09:14] has no value in it at all." I was
[1:09:17] talking to a man this week that had gone
[1:09:19] through something. He said, "Brother,"
[1:09:20] he said, "John," he says, "You know, I
[1:09:22] just I don't think the result is going
[1:09:23] to be what I thought it should
[1:09:25] be." And I said, "Why are you saying
[1:09:29] that? Why are you saying that the result
[1:09:31] of this is going to be bad?" He says,
[1:09:33] "Well, I don't feel that I did it as
[1:09:35] well as I could
[1:09:36] have." I said, "Don't borrow that." I
[1:09:39] said to every stage that you've come
[1:09:41] through, you've been successful. Why
[1:09:44] would you start thinking you're not
[1:09:45] going to be successful? What do you gain
[1:09:47] by being in that attitude? He's going to
[1:09:51] have to wait till August to find out if
[1:09:52] he's if he's passed his test or not. And
[1:09:56] from now till August, he says, I'm just
[1:09:57] trying to get myself up from my failure.
[1:09:59] I said, you don't even know if you're
[1:10:00] failed and you're wallowing in your
[1:10:02] failure already. Don't do that. I said,
[1:10:05] you'll be miserable till August. focus
[1:10:08] on what you've gotten so far and trust
[1:10:10] that you'll get the same result now. And
[1:10:12] I said, I've gone through these things
[1:10:13] before, you know, professional tests and
[1:10:15] these things. I said, many times I
[1:10:16] didn't think I did so well and I made it
[1:10:18] through every time. Sometimes way better
[1:10:20] than I thought I did. Sometimes way
[1:10:22] better than I deserve to. So I said,
[1:10:24] don't don't look at things that
[1:10:26] way. It doesn't bring any results to sit
[1:10:28] there in fear, worry or anxiety. It's
[1:10:31] not of God. He says faith of is of God.
[1:10:34] Fear is of the devil. Fear makes you
[1:10:38] weary. Fear makes you
[1:10:40] wonder. If you're weary this evening,
[1:10:44] consider it might not be of
[1:10:47] God. If you're
[1:10:49] wondering, it might not be of
[1:10:52] God. He says, "And if I was going to die
[1:10:54] in the morning, what good would it do me
[1:10:55] to get all stowed up about it? What if I
[1:10:58] was going to be electrocuted in the
[1:10:59] morning and my life had to end tomorrow
[1:11:00] morning? What good would it do me to
[1:11:02] worry about it? Absolutely nothing." He
[1:11:04] says, "Well, you're saved. What good
[1:11:06] would it have do to have faith?" It's a
[1:11:08] good question. He says, "Faith can sign
[1:11:11] my
[1:11:12] pardon." Now, what's he talking about?
[1:11:15] Remember what they they determined in in
[1:11:17] the Civil War was a young man that had
[1:11:20] failed in his soldierly duty. And so,
[1:11:22] they they they they put him up and they
[1:11:25] charged him. They found him guilty and
[1:11:26] he was going to die. They were going to
[1:11:28] shoot him. And his mother went and
[1:11:30] pleaded to Abraham Lincoln. And Abraham
[1:11:31] Lincoln said, "Okay, I'll pardon him."
[1:11:33] and he sent the pardon and the young man
[1:11:36] refused it because he thought they were
[1:11:38] they were playing a cruel joke on him
[1:11:40] and he refused the pardon and therefore
[1:11:42] they took him out and they shot him and
[1:11:44] it went to court and the court ruled
[1:11:46] that a pardon is not a pardon unless
[1:11:49] it's received as a pardon. You've got to
[1:11:51] accept it. The fact that it exists does
[1:11:54] not mean that you don't that that you're
[1:11:55] pardoned. You have to accept it.
[1:11:57] Brother's saying here he says faith will
[1:11:59] sign the pardon. It'll take what God's
[1:12:01] given me.
[1:12:03] Amen. He says, "Sure, there's value in
[1:12:06] faith." And he says, "What? Don't be
[1:12:08] weary. Don't be scared." That's the
[1:12:09] value of faith. You don't have to get
[1:12:11] caught up now in the emotions. He says,
[1:12:13] "Don't be upset. Just have faith and
[1:12:15] believe." And he says, "And the only way
[1:12:17] you can have faith, you have to have
[1:12:19] love first. For love produces faith and
[1:12:22] perfect love casts out all fear." We
[1:12:25] read in the last service where we that
[1:12:26] scripture where it says we love him
[1:12:28] because he first loved us and because he
[1:12:31] loved us because we are his children.
[1:12:33] He's called us and he's given us his
[1:12:35] spirit and he's gotten us to believe his
[1:12:37] word and take it into our hearts. Amen.
[1:12:39] And that all happens at the new birth
[1:12:41] when what? When when we take God at his
[1:12:43] word by faith that he gave us in the
[1:12:45] first place and we start to walk
[1:12:48] according to the word. And that faith as
[1:12:50] I said earlier it's a love gift from God
[1:12:52] to draw us back to him.
[1:12:54] You can't move unless he calls you
[1:12:56] first. And that comes from a faith that
[1:12:58] he gives you
[1:13:00] himself. The Bram says this. He says
[1:13:02] when you are saved, God gives you faith
[1:13:04] to rise from the muck of the earth. Your
[1:13:07] faith overcomes the things of the world.
[1:13:10] See, he calls it your faith. But where
[1:13:12] did it come from?
[1:13:14] God. He says, what is your faith? Your
[1:13:17] faith in that act that God has done in
[1:13:20] you to make you a son of God. You quit
[1:13:23] your line. You quit your stealing. You
[1:13:24] quit your drinking. Why? Because your
[1:13:27] faith raises you above it. He says,
[1:13:29] "Amen. If you don't do it, you don't
[1:13:31] have any faith." Because he said, "By
[1:13:33] faith are you saved and that through
[1:13:34] grace." Now, catch this. He says, "As
[1:13:36] much as your faith will be released,
[1:13:39] that's how much power you can have."
[1:13:43] Wow. That's why I said it's not your
[1:13:45] faith. It's his
[1:13:47] faith. It's the faith of God. It's not
[1:13:51] your faith. You claim it as yours
[1:13:53] because he gave it to you. But it comes
[1:13:54] from him. It's of him. I It is him in
[1:13:58] and of itself. Amen. He says, "Because
[1:14:00] in you dwells the power to make heavens
[1:14:02] and earth." Church, I want more of that
[1:14:04] kind of faith. How are we going to get
[1:14:07] it? How are we going to get more
[1:14:09] faith? How did we get faith in the first
[1:14:12] place, church? Faith cometh by hearing
[1:14:15] and hearing by the word of God. Faith
[1:14:19] comes by the word of God. You want more
[1:14:21] faith? Get into the word of God. Listen
[1:14:24] to it, read it, hear it, watch it, dwell
[1:14:28] on it, sing it. Some way get into the
[1:14:31] word. It's the only way that you're
[1:14:33] going to keep moving forward. It's the
[1:14:34] only way it'll happen. Amen. He says,
[1:14:36] "God dwells in you, and you are sons and
[1:14:38] daughters of God." Amen. There you are.
[1:14:40] But it's your faith. And Jesus said,
[1:14:42] "According to your faith, be it unto
[1:14:44] you. If thou canst believe, all things
[1:14:46] are possible. Verily I say unto you, if
[1:14:48] you say unto this mountain, be moved and
[1:14:50] don't doubt, but believe that what you
[1:14:52] have said, what? You'll have it. He
[1:14:55] says, then what kind of people ought we
[1:14:56] to
[1:14:57] be? Having faith in this great redeeming
[1:15:00] Christ that lives in us, this smitten
[1:15:03] rock that never leaves the
[1:15:06] church. Why do we worry? Why are we
[1:15:10] anxious? Why are we fearful? Because
[1:15:12] we've forgotten the rock that never
[1:15:14] leaves the church.
[1:15:16] He says, "I am with you always, even to
[1:15:18] the end of the world. The everpresence
[1:15:21] of the great gusher of salvation and
[1:15:24] power that poured forth from Calvary
[1:15:26] into the church, the ever presence of
[1:15:28] the living God, the great flowing
[1:15:31] smitten rock that goes with us in our
[1:15:34] journey." Amen. That faith to receive
[1:15:36] the word of God is a gift from him
[1:15:38] itself. And it's the starting point of
[1:15:40] redemption. Amen. Overcoming starts with
[1:15:43] faith. Salvation starts with faith. Your
[1:15:46] healing starts with faith. Your trust
[1:15:49] and your rest starts with faith. It all
[1:15:51] comes back to faith. And it is a faith
[1:15:54] that is personal to you. It is not
[1:15:56] mama's faith. It's not daddy's faith
[1:15:58] that might have helped get you to where
[1:16:00] you are. But to walk forward, you've got
[1:16:02] to have your own faith. You've got to
[1:16:05] know that you've had something. You've
[1:16:07] you've received something. You've
[1:16:08] experienced something. And it's got to
[1:16:10] be anchored in your soul. Amen. Because
[1:16:13] what? It's got to make you see and
[1:16:14] accept things that nobody else will.
[1:16:17] It's got to make you live the way nobody
[1:16:18] else will. It's got to be a personal
[1:16:20] thing. Amen. And everyone else that
[1:16:22] can't see it. Why? Because they're under
[1:16:24] a spirit of bondage again to fear. And
[1:16:26] they can't operate in a faith realm.
[1:16:28] Why? Cuz they're under a fear
[1:16:30] realm. Watch how this works. Now, we're
[1:16:33] preaching on no room for fear. And that
[1:16:35] means if there's no fear, then something
[1:16:37] else has to be in that room of our life.
[1:16:39] There has to be something else to fill
[1:16:40] it. Fill it. Fill it. Amen. And we'll
[1:16:43] see by the prophet that he ties it back
[1:16:45] to scripture that perfect love casts out
[1:16:47] fear. How? By producing faith. And we
[1:16:50] won't cover all this tonight. It'll take
[1:16:52] at least another service. But we'll
[1:16:53] start the thought tonight. Amen.
[1:16:55] Remember what I want to take us back
[1:16:57] now. I want to take us to real world
[1:16:58] example. And we go back to Exodus 23
[1:17:02] where God is giving the promise again of
[1:17:05] the promised land to the children of
[1:17:06] Israel. And he says, "Behold, I send an
[1:17:09] angel before thee to keep thee in the
[1:17:10] way and to bring thee into the place
[1:17:13] which I have prepare prepared." So, in
[1:17:15] other words, if you're following the
[1:17:16] pillar of fire, you're in the right
[1:17:19] place. Now, notice the pillar of fire
[1:17:21] did not lead them straight to the
[1:17:22] promised land. He took them out to a
[1:17:25] place where they could be
[1:17:26] trapped and then he destroyed their
[1:17:29] enemy. Then he took them through the
[1:17:31] water. Then he took them into the
[1:17:33] desert. He took them into hardship. He
[1:17:36] took them into
[1:17:38] drought, but he always brought them
[1:17:41] out. So if you're where the pillar of
[1:17:44] fire is, you're in the right place
[1:17:45] whether you think it's the right place
[1:17:46] or not. Where he is, there's where
[1:17:49] you're supposed to be. In other words,
[1:17:51] church, if you're following the word,
[1:17:53] have confidence in your position. Don't
[1:17:55] worry about the conditions that are
[1:17:56] around you. He says, "Beware of him and
[1:17:59] obey his voice. Provoke him not, for he
[1:18:01] will not pardon your transgressions, for
[1:18:03] my name is in him." He says, "But if
[1:18:05] thou will indeed obey his voice,"
[1:18:08] church, what was his voice? Who was his
[1:18:11] voice?
[1:18:13] Moses. Moses said, "Mo, God said to
[1:18:15] Moses, Moses, you'll be a God to them,
[1:18:17] and Aaron will be your prophet." The
[1:18:18] voice of God was
[1:18:20] Moses. That's the position God had
[1:18:22] placed him in. And do all that I speak.
[1:18:25] Then will I be an enemy unto thine
[1:18:27] enemies, and an adversary unto thine
[1:18:30] adversaries. For mine angel shall go
[1:18:33] before thee, and bring thee into the
[1:18:34] Amorites, and the Hittites, and the
[1:18:36] Parizzites, and the Canaanites, and the
[1:18:38] Hivites, and the
[1:18:41] Jebusites. Can we say amen
[1:18:44] there? We don't want to say amen, but la
[1:18:46] read the last bit. And I will cut them
[1:18:49] off, church. God never gave them this
[1:18:52] this beautiful picture of you're going
[1:18:54] to walk into a land that anybody would
[1:18:56] love to live in and it's going to be
[1:18:58] empty.
[1:18:59] God gave them a menu of what they were
[1:19:02] going to eat in there. And it was
[1:19:03] Jebusites and it was Amorites and it was
[1:19:05] parizzites and Canaanites and Hivites
[1:19:07] and a bunch of
[1:19:08] otherites. God never hid the
[1:19:11] truth. But he said, "I'll cut them off.
[1:19:14] They're there, but they're not going to
[1:19:15] be there for long. When you step in,
[1:19:17] they'll start to go out cuz I'm going to
[1:19:19] cut them off." Amen. He literally gives
[1:19:22] them the names of who they're going to
[1:19:24] defeat.
[1:19:26] He says, "And I will send my fear before
[1:19:30] thee and will destroy how many
[1:19:34] church?"
[1:19:36] "All the people to whom thou shalt come
[1:19:40] and I will
[1:19:41] make all thine enemies turn their backs
[1:19:45] unto thee." Marital tip: never use
[1:19:50] absolutes. You always, you
[1:19:52] never. God loves to use absolutes
[1:19:55] because he's the only thing that is an
[1:19:58] absolute. And I want you to see
[1:20:00] something here. He says we you will
[1:20:03] destroy. I will destroy
[1:20:06] all. That means no ifs, no ands, no
[1:20:11] buts, no exceptions. He says, I will
[1:20:15] destroy every single one that comes
[1:20:19] before you. Did God say only the short
[1:20:23] fat
[1:20:24] unarmed
[1:20:26] Amorites are the ones you're going to
[1:20:28] defeat? Cuz even the least of us can
[1:20:30] beat a short fat unarmed Amorite. He
[1:20:33] didn't say that. He didn't say, "Now, if
[1:20:35] you get into a battle and it's just the
[1:20:37] women and the children, you'll win." He
[1:20:40] didn't say
[1:20:40] that. God God made no no emergency
[1:20:45] clauses to get out of this promise.
[1:20:49] God didn't say, "Now listen, you're
[1:20:51] going in and you're the
[1:20:55] underdogs. You don't have enough
[1:20:57] soldiers to take the whole land. So,
[1:20:59] you're going to have to be okay with the
[1:21:00] occasional draw and you might even lose
[1:21:03] a few times." He never said any of that,
[1:21:05] church. He said, "I will destroy
[1:21:10] all." Why did he do it, church? because
[1:21:13] he didn't put the pressure of victory on
[1:21:15] the
[1:21:16] people. Too often we're sitting there
[1:21:18] saying, "How am I going to get the
[1:21:19] victory?" God never put the pressure of
[1:21:22] victory on them. He put it on himself.
[1:21:24] And he said, "I will send my fear before
[1:21:27] you, and I will destroy all that come
[1:21:30] before you." The pressure is not on me.
[1:21:33] The pressure is on God. He never comes
[1:21:36] into this. And he's never resting on our
[1:21:38] weapons. He's never resting on our
[1:21:39] health. He's never resting on our
[1:21:41] intellect, on our education. He's not
[1:21:42] resting on our church history. He's not
[1:21:44] resting on our family dynamics. He's not
[1:21:46] resting on our marriage. He's not
[1:21:48] resting on our strength or our good
[1:21:50] looks or anything of that. He says, "I
[1:21:52] will do it.
[1:21:54] You just got to go in." That's the only
[1:21:57] thing that he's requiring of them. He
[1:21:59] never said, "I'm relying on you to beat
[1:22:01] the enemy." He said, "I'm going to
[1:22:05] destroy
[1:22:06] them." That's it.
[1:22:10] Why do we
[1:22:11] fear? Because we think he's relying on
[1:22:14] us or we start to rely on us and all of
[1:22:18] a sudden things start to go sideways.
[1:22:21] Amen. He said, "I will overcome." Let me
[1:22:24] bring in what we read what Paul said.
[1:22:26] I'm going to do it so that you'll see
[1:22:28] that the excellency of power works in
[1:22:30] people that don't have weapons, don't
[1:22:32] have chariots, don't have horses, don't
[1:22:34] have formal training, don't have the
[1:22:36] numbers, don't have the siege
[1:22:38] weapons. And that way you'll know that
[1:22:40] it's me that's doing it and it's not
[1:22:42] you. That's the beauty of God. He never
[1:22:44] puts the pressure on us. But I'll tell
[1:22:47] you this, church, he gave us the same
[1:22:50] absolutes. See, we can look back there
[1:22:52] and say, "Well, that's for them." No, he
[1:22:53] gave us the same absolutes. I was
[1:22:55] reading this in devotions. Amen. I want
[1:22:57] you to catch the absolutes. I love when
[1:22:59] God gives me an absolute. Listen to
[1:23:02] this. Bless the Lord, oh my
[1:23:07] soul. And oh, how
[1:23:11] much? All that is within me, bless his
[1:23:13] holy name. God asks us to give
[1:23:16] everything we've got. Now, church, did
[1:23:20] he say, "Bless me if you have a good
[1:23:22] voice."
[1:23:24] Worship me if you're a great
[1:23:29] singer. Did he say worship me if you're
[1:23:32] a good
[1:23:34] person? Bless me if you've got a good
[1:23:36] name in the
[1:23:38] community. He didn't. He just said,
[1:23:40] "Give me what you've got. Give me
[1:23:43] everything you've got and bless me. Rest
[1:23:45] on my name. Rest on my holiness. Just
[1:23:49] give me what you've got. Give me
[1:23:50] everything you've got because I'll use
[1:23:52] it.
[1:23:54] He says, "Bless the Lord, oh my soul,
[1:23:56] and forget not all his
[1:24:01] benefits." In other words, don't pick
[1:24:03] and choose the benefits that are for you
[1:24:06] based on some random criteria you came
[1:24:09] up with because you're not worthy,
[1:24:11] because you're weak, because you're a
[1:24:12] woman, because you're a man, because
[1:24:14] you're married, because you're not
[1:24:15] married, because you're not a minister,
[1:24:17] because you are a minister. church, we
[1:24:19] can come up with all sorts of reasons
[1:24:20] why we don't get all of God's benefits.
[1:24:23] And I've heard people repeat it to my
[1:24:24] face. And I say, "Where is that coming
[1:24:26] from? That ain't that ain't of God." He
[1:24:29] said, "Remember all his benefits?"
[1:24:33] Amen. What? Who forgiveth all thine
[1:24:38] iniquities? Now we're getting down to
[1:24:40] some meat, aren't we? Listen, he didn't
[1:24:43] say, "I'll just forgive the little white
[1:24:45] lies." church. He forgives the
[1:24:46] prostitutes as much as he forgives the
[1:24:48] little white
[1:24:49] liars.
[1:24:52] Amen. God sets no qualifications to
[1:24:56] forgiveness for his children. I'll
[1:24:59] forgive everything you do. As his
[1:25:02] children, we have a price to pay.
[1:25:05] Forgiveness doesn't mean there aren't
[1:25:06] consequences, but it means he doesn't
[1:25:08] hold it against us. There's no mark
[1:25:10] against you in the book. Amen.
[1:25:15] Listen, he he he'll forgive
[1:25:18] everything. He'll forgive your
[1:25:20] pornography habit as much as he'll
[1:25:22] forgive your dismissive attitude. He'll
[1:25:24] forgive your missing church as much as
[1:25:26] that arrogance that you bring along
[1:25:28] sometimes. Amen. There is nothing he
[1:25:30] won't forgive his children, but he'll
[1:25:33] deal with it. He'll deal with it. Amen.
[1:25:35] And that's a blessing of God. He says,
[1:25:37] "Who forgives all thy iniquities." But
[1:25:40] look at this one. Who health healeth all
[1:25:42] w all
[1:25:45] all of thy
[1:25:48] diseases? Can I preach it? Not just
[1:25:52] colds, not just runny
[1:25:54] noses, not just aches, not just
[1:25:57] pains, chronic
[1:26:00] diseases, real
[1:26:03] issues, lifechanging
[1:26:05] issues. There was that man that was lame
[1:26:08] for 37 years.
[1:26:11] There's a man that was blind, I think,
[1:26:13] to 40. There's the woman with the issue
[1:26:15] of blood, 12 years, chronic conditions.
[1:26:19] Church, if he can conquer death, he can
[1:26:21] conquer your disease. He put no
[1:26:23] qualifications on it. He was wounded for
[1:26:26] our transgressions. He was bruised for
[1:26:28] our iniquities. Chastisement of our of
[1:26:30] his our peace was upon him. And by his
[1:26:33] stripes, we are healed.
[1:26:36] Period. He didn't put any limits on it.
[1:26:39] Why are we putting limits on
[1:26:41] it? Don't you love it when he says, "All
[1:26:44] your diseases, all your iniquities,
[1:26:47] remember all my benefits." Church, he's
[1:26:50] not trying to hide himself from us. He's
[1:26:51] not trying to hold us back. He's trying
[1:26:52] to get us to take it. Why? Cuz we often
[1:26:55] don't take it. We make up reasons for
[1:26:57] why we don't deserve it, why we
[1:26:59] shouldn't get it. And he's sitting there
[1:27:01] saying, "No, it's all for you, my
[1:27:02] children. You're my loved one. You're my
[1:27:05] bride. You're my family. It's for you.
[1:27:08] It's meant for you alone.
[1:27:11] Literally created for you. The attribute
[1:27:13] of God is there for you to take hold of.
[1:27:16] He says, "Who redeemth thy life from
[1:27:18] destruction? Who crowneth thee with
[1:27:21] loving kindness and tender mercies?"
[1:27:24] Romans 8 says, "What can separate us
[1:27:26] from the love of God?" And then it gives
[1:27:27] all these circumstances and and all
[1:27:29] these events and all these harsh things.
[1:27:31] And then it says, "Nay, in all things we
[1:27:33] are more than conquerors through him
[1:27:34] that loved us." It's his loving kindness
[1:27:37] that brings us back to him. Amen. But
[1:27:39] that redemption is a process of time.
[1:27:41] And that's what hurts us so many times.
[1:27:44] It's the gap between the promise and the
[1:27:46] reality. Creatures of time. He says,
[1:27:49] "But what is it that crowns us? Our
[1:27:52] goodness, our
[1:27:53] graciousness, our skills, our gifts?"
[1:27:56] No, it's his tender mercies and his
[1:28:00] loving kindness. Amen. His banner over
[1:28:02] me is love. That's what we have at the
[1:28:04] end of all this. He says, "Who
[1:28:06] satisfaith thy mouth with good things?"
[1:28:09] You ever have somebody say, "Try this."
[1:28:10] And they put something in and it wasn't
[1:28:11] a good thing. That ain't God. It's good
[1:28:15] things. It's good things. Why? So that
[1:28:18] thy youth is renewed like the eagles. He
[1:28:21] says, "Like as a father pityth his
[1:28:23] children, so the Lord pityth them that
[1:28:26] fear him." You ever see your children
[1:28:28] trying to do something and they're just
[1:28:30] giving it everything they've got and
[1:28:32] nothing's happening?
[1:28:34] I mean, I I can't tell you how many
[1:28:36] times I've seen my own children, other
[1:28:37] people's children, and they're just
[1:28:39] heaving and pulling and grunting and and
[1:28:42] everything they've got into it and
[1:28:44] nothing's happening. And usually they
[1:28:46] end up just stomping away or breaking
[1:28:47] down in tears and we pity them. And what
[1:28:50] do we do, church? We go over and the
[1:28:52] thing that they can bear, they just
[1:28:54] can't do, we do with the simplest of
[1:28:57] ease, don't we? Because why? Daddy and
[1:29:00] mommy, we're supernatural compared to a
[1:29:02] kid.
[1:29:04] He says, "God's just like
[1:29:06] that." Catch this. He says, "For he
[1:29:08] knoweth our
[1:29:11] frame, and he rememberth that we are
[1:29:14] dust." In other words, he's not relying
[1:29:17] on how we're
[1:29:18] built. He knows how we're built, and it
[1:29:22] doesn't impress
[1:29:25] him. He's not
[1:29:27] looking I'm going to say it to brother
[1:29:29] Kingsley. He's not looking at brother
[1:29:30] Kingsley and saying, "Look at that guy.
[1:29:32] Now, that's a guy that can handle a
[1:29:34] burden." No. Cuz the things that God can
[1:29:38] bear will crush us. The things that God
[1:29:41] can move with a breath from his mouth or
[1:29:44] the flick of a finger, we couldn't move
[1:29:46] in a thousand years with all of our
[1:29:48] technology and strength and skills and
[1:29:50] abilities. He knows our frame. In other
[1:29:54] words, our frame is not what limits him.
[1:29:59] It's not what holds him back. So don't
[1:30:01] use your frame as an excuse tonight,
[1:30:03] church. Don't use your frame as an
[1:30:05] excuse. Amen. Like I said earlier, God
[1:30:09] came to Gideon. He says, "Thou mighty
[1:30:10] man of valor." And Gideon's like, "Say,
[1:30:12] what me?" And you find that all God did
[1:30:16] was he kept taking it down to the point
[1:30:18] where it was
[1:30:20] ludicrous. By the time that Gideon's
[1:30:22] done, he goes from over from, I think,
[1:30:23] 30,000 soldiers to 300. and they're
[1:30:26] going to take on an army of over
[1:30:29] 120,000.
[1:30:30] 300
[1:30:34] 120,000. God took it to the point where
[1:30:36] it was completely obvious the battle
[1:30:39] belongs to God. And then what did he do,
[1:30:42] church? The scripture says that the
[1:30:44] Midionites killed more of themselves and
[1:30:46] God killed more of the Midionites than
[1:30:49] Gideon and his men ever did. God just
[1:30:51] needed somebody to stand there and do
[1:30:53] what he told him to do. That's it. Just
[1:30:56] do what God told you to do. The battle
[1:30:58] belongs to God, not to you. What do we
[1:31:01] do? We sing that song. The battle
[1:31:02] belongs to God, not to you and me. Leave
[1:31:04] it in his hands and shout the victory.
[1:31:06] Be not afraid. Be not dismayed. For the
[1:31:08] battle belongs
[1:31:09] to For the battle belongs to God, not
[1:31:13] you. I think that's the way it goes. I
[1:31:15] think we're good.
[1:31:18] Amen. But Satan wants to point to our
[1:31:21] frame.
[1:31:22] Listen, some of us think we have a bit
[1:31:24] better frame than others. But when it
[1:31:27] comes to the the the road we've got to
[1:31:29] walk, the battles we've got to fight,
[1:31:31] our frame ain't going to do it. The best
[1:31:33] of us aren't going to do it. It's going
[1:31:35] to take something more than that.
[1:31:38] Amen. That's why we need a spirit of
[1:31:41] power inside of us. Spirit of love and
[1:31:43] of a sound mind because God's trying to
[1:31:44] get us out of the first that I spoke
[1:31:46] about of human ability and get us into
[1:31:50] deity. That's what he's trying to get us
[1:31:52] into. And that means this frame has to
[1:31:54] be taken out of the picture so the
[1:31:56] excellency of the power can be of God.
[1:31:58] Let's go back to this promise we were
[1:32:00] reading in Exodus 23. God says, "I'm
[1:32:02] going to clear it all
[1:32:03] out." Says, "And I will send hornets
[1:32:06] before thee, which shall drive out the
[1:32:08] Hivite and the Canaanite and the
[1:32:09] Hitittite from before thee." Now catch
[1:32:12] this. We're saying, "Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:32:15] But I will not drive them out from thee
[1:32:16] before thee in one year." In other
[1:32:18] words, it's going to take some time,
[1:32:20] church. Receiving the promise is going
[1:32:23] to take some time. It's a process of
[1:32:25] time. It does not happen in a moment.
[1:32:28] Amen. He says, "Lest the land become
[1:32:30] desolate and the beast of the field
[1:32:32] multiply against thee. By little and
[1:32:35] little, I will drive them out from
[1:32:36] before thee until thou be increased and
[1:32:39] inherit the land." So, in other words,
[1:32:41] you'll conquer as much as you can
[1:32:43] occupy.
[1:32:44] God's not going to have you conquer land
[1:32:46] just to have you pull back because
[1:32:47] you're not strong enough to hold it. You
[1:32:50] got to have the numbers. You got to have
[1:32:52] the faith. You got to have the people to
[1:32:53] fill it up as you take it. He says, "And
[1:32:55] I will set thy bounds from the Red Sea,
[1:32:58] even under the sea of the Philistines,
[1:33:00] and from the desert under the river. For
[1:33:02] I will deliver the inhabitants of the
[1:33:05] land into your hand." And we all
[1:33:08] said, we all said, "Amen."
[1:33:12] And then he said, "And thou shalt drive
[1:33:15] them up before thee." And we say, "Say
[1:33:17] what
[1:33:18] now?" You said you were going to destroy
[1:33:20] them all. You said you were going to
[1:33:22] send the hornets there. You said you
[1:33:24] were going to kill them all. You said
[1:33:25] you were going to push them. And now
[1:33:27] you're saying, "I've got something to
[1:33:29] do. We got something to do, church. We
[1:33:33] got something to do."
[1:33:34] Amen. Notice what he says. God's putting
[1:33:38] fear of them
[1:33:41] that really the Israelites ought to have
[1:33:44] had. He's swapping out that fear.
[1:33:47] Amen. But what's our part? We've got to
[1:33:50] step out with
[1:33:52] him. My part is not to win. My part is
[1:33:56] to
[1:33:57] walk. Is to act on what he said. That's
[1:34:00] my only portion. I can't win in myself.
[1:34:04] But what I can do in myself is I can
[1:34:06] walk. That's a choice. That's a choice.
[1:34:09] But it comes through faith. We know
[1:34:10] this. Amen. We have to step out in
[1:34:12] faith. And once we start
[1:34:14] stepping, we can't stop because stopping
[1:34:18] is
[1:34:19] backsliding. You got to keep walking. If
[1:34:21] we walk in the light, as he is in the
[1:34:22] light, we've got to walk as he walks.
[1:34:24] Move as he moves. Remember when they
[1:34:26] crossed in the Jordan, he said, "Set the
[1:34:27] ark first cuz you've not gone this way
[1:34:30] before. You don't know where you're
[1:34:31] going. Let me lead you and you follow."
[1:34:34] So we follow the word into battle. And
[1:34:36] as the word leads us, we walk. And we
[1:34:39] walk and we walk. And when the word
[1:34:41] stops, we stop. But if it keeps moving,
[1:34:43] then we keep moving. Right? Line upon
[1:34:46] line, word upon word, step by step.
[1:34:49] Everywhere that your footsteps are,
[1:34:51] that'll belong to you. Footsteps is
[1:34:53] victory. We've heard these things. Amen.
[1:34:55] We'll go from victory to victory. But
[1:34:57] there's time between
[1:34:58] victories. It's not all just as soon as
[1:35:00] I walk, I've got the victory. No, you
[1:35:02] got victory because you took the step.
[1:35:05] That's the promise is as you walk,
[1:35:07] you'll get the victory. Amen. Isn't that
[1:35:09] the message that we heard this past
[1:35:11] weekend? You got to take that word and
[1:35:13] you got to walk with that word. You got
[1:35:15] to make it personal. You got to make it
[1:35:16] yours. You got to say, "It belongs to me
[1:35:18] as a child of God, as a son or a
[1:35:20] daughter of God." You got to know they
[1:35:22] are for
[1:35:23] you. That's the point of all this. This
[1:35:25] is why we come into service twice a week
[1:35:28] is to let you know that this is for you.
[1:35:30] This is about you. It's your land. It's
[1:35:32] your promise. It's your God. It's your
[1:35:34] faith that he's given you. It can't just
[1:35:37] come from the pulpit. It just can't come
[1:35:38] from our elders or our parents. It's got
[1:35:40] to be a personal thing that God has
[1:35:42] given to
[1:35:45] you. You make steps. You know, I trust
[1:35:48] after this weekend, we've seen some
[1:35:49] great leaps. I'm trusting that. I'm
[1:35:51] believing that. But what do you do
[1:35:54] now? We're not going to have weekend
[1:35:56] after weekend of special meetings. We're
[1:35:59] not going to have men that preach like a
[1:36:00] house on fire every
[1:36:02] service. We're not going to have the
[1:36:04] emotion of it all.
[1:36:07] What do we do
[1:36:09] now? Where do we
[1:36:11] go? You look at Israel. They've been
[1:36:14] delivered out of Egypt by a mighty hand.
[1:36:18] Strongest nation in the world. And God
[1:36:21] destroyed them. Made a laughingtock of
[1:36:23] the Egyptians. Took them out with all
[1:36:25] their wealth. Took everything from them.
[1:36:28] We're borrowing
[1:36:29] it, right? And just walked away. Then
[1:36:32] the the Egyptians were dumb enough to
[1:36:34] chase them down and God destroyed their
[1:36:36] army. So now they have no wealth and
[1:36:38] they have no army. Opens the Red Sea,
[1:36:40] takes them through, feeds them, waters
[1:36:43] them, multiplies them, takes care of
[1:36:45] them, gets them into a place where
[1:36:47] they've got a a place of worship where
[1:36:49] the presence of God can come down. Gives
[1:36:51] them a word. And now he brings them
[1:36:54] right up to the border of
[1:36:56] Canaan. He takes them to the border of
[1:36:59] what he promised.
[1:37:01] And we know what happens there. Moses
[1:37:03] sends the spies into there. Now
[1:37:06] remember, we're preaching on no room for
[1:37:07] fear. And watch what happens as those
[1:37:10] spies come back. Says, "And they
[1:37:12] returned from searching of the land
[1:37:14] after 40
[1:37:15] days. And they went in and came to Moses
[1:37:18] and to Aaron and to all the congregation
[1:37:20] of the children of Israel under the
[1:37:22] wilderness of Perin to Kadesh, and
[1:37:24] brought back word unto them, and unto
[1:37:26] the congregation, and showed them the
[1:37:28] fruit of the land." So they brought back
[1:37:30] evidence of the land. Now catch this.
[1:37:33] And they told him and said, "We came
[1:37:35] into the land whether thou sentest us,
[1:37:36] and surely it flowest with milk and
[1:37:38] honey, and this is the fruit of it." In
[1:37:40] other words, they said, "What God said
[1:37:42] is
[1:37:43] true." And we'd say, "Praise the Lord."
[1:37:46] Testimony service. Bring it on,
[1:37:48] brother. But watch
[1:37:50] this. Everything they've said to this
[1:37:52] point is great. Amazing place to live.
[1:37:54] Great views, great food.
[1:37:58] Nevertheless, this is a really long way
[1:38:00] of saying
[1:38:04] but. But but the people be strong that
[1:38:07] dwell in the land and the cities are
[1:38:09] walled and very great. And moreover, we
[1:38:12] saw the children of Anch there. The
[1:38:14] Amalocites dwell in the land of the
[1:38:15] south. The Hittites, the Jebusites,
[1:38:17] Amorites dwell in the mountains. The
[1:38:19] Canaanites dwell by the sea and by the
[1:38:20] coast of Jordan. Church, is anything
[1:38:22] here something that God didn't tell
[1:38:24] them? God to God literally named these
[1:38:28] people for them. There's nothing new
[1:38:30] here. Nothing new. There's there there's
[1:38:33] nothing that God hadn't revealed to them
[1:38:35] already. Amen. God never pretended
[1:38:39] otherwise. And Caleb stilled the people
[1:38:42] before Moses and said, "Let us go up at
[1:38:46] once and possess it for we are well able
[1:38:50] to overcome it." Now, I love when a
[1:38:52] believer comes into this sort of a
[1:38:54] situation because they stand up and they
[1:38:56] try and cut it off before it can grow.
[1:38:58] And Caleb says,
[1:38:59] "Whoa, we don't talk like this. This is
[1:39:03] not the talk of the promised children.
[1:39:05] This is not the talk of the royal seed
[1:39:07] of Abraham. This is not the kind of
[1:39:09] things we talk about." Sometimes we need
[1:39:12] to curb our
[1:39:13] talk. Watch what we're saying. Is it of
[1:39:16] fear or is it of faith? He says, "Don't
[1:39:19] do it." And what does he do? Caleb
[1:39:21] rushes to get them to hear the rest of
[1:39:24] God's message. And his message was, "And
[1:39:28] you will drive them out." He says,
[1:39:29] "Let's go up and drive them out." Cuz
[1:39:30] that's what the word says. Read all the
[1:39:33] word, people, is what he's saying. Don't
[1:39:35] stop here. Read it all. Get the full
[1:39:38] message. Get the full promise. And
[1:39:40] that'll keep us moving
[1:39:42] forward. Church, don't do the devil's
[1:39:44] job for
[1:39:46] him. Don't build up the situation. Don't
[1:39:49] build up the barrier. If you're going to
[1:39:52] build up the barrier, finish with this
[1:39:54] and I can't wait to see how God gets me
[1:39:57] through
[1:39:58] it. Cuz if you dwell on the barrier,
[1:40:00] what happens? Faith creeps in and faith
[1:40:02] goes out the door. Don't do the devil's
[1:40:05] job for him. Keep reading the word. Put
[1:40:07] circumstances in their proper context.
[1:40:10] What was the proper context for this?
[1:40:12] Nothing they've said here is wrong. But
[1:40:14] they stopped without putting it into
[1:40:16] context, which is thou shalt drive them
[1:40:20] out. That's the context. They're
[1:40:23] ordained to
[1:40:25] destruction. That's the context. You
[1:40:28] say, "I'm sick, Brother John." It's
[1:40:29] ordained to destruction. "I'm weak,
[1:40:32] Brother John." It's ordained to leave
[1:40:33] you. "I struggle, Brother John." That's
[1:40:36] okay. You're ordained to overcome. Put
[1:40:39] it in context. Victory. Victory. always
[1:40:43] victory. Amen. Those people were
[1:40:46] ordained to run
[1:40:50] away. What a horrible place to be.
[1:40:53] Ordained to lose. And yet you got the
[1:40:55] people that are ordained to win coming
[1:40:58] in and all they can do is talk about
[1:41:00] losing. Caleb says, "We are well aable."
[1:41:04] In other words, guys, this isn't going
[1:41:06] to be
[1:41:08] hard. It's not a stretch. We're not
[1:41:10] going to get there by the skin of our
[1:41:12] teeth. We're well aable. It's like Paul
[1:41:15] said, "We are more than conquerors." In
[1:41:18] other words, our victory is
[1:41:21] abundant. It's not a narrow victory.
[1:41:24] It's a solid and total victory where the
[1:41:27] outcome was never in question.
[1:41:31] He says, "But the men that went up with
[1:41:32] him said, 'We be not able to go up
[1:41:34] against the people, for they are
[1:41:37] stronger
[1:41:38] than they're stronger than our
[1:41:41] frame. They're stronger than we." And
[1:41:44] they brought up an evil report of the
[1:41:46] land which they had searched under the
[1:41:48] children of Israel, saying, "The land
[1:41:49] through which we have gone to search it
[1:41:51] is a land that eateth up the inhabitants
[1:41:53] thereof, and all the people that we saw
[1:41:55] in it are men of a great stature."
[1:41:58] And there we saw the giants, the son of
[1:42:00] Anch, which come of the giants. And we
[1:42:03] were, oh my goodness, look at
[1:42:07] this. We were in our own sight as
[1:42:12] grasshoppers. Look at the total reversal
[1:42:15] here. We were in our own sight as
[1:42:18] grasshoppers and so were we in their
[1:42:20] sight. Church, what is the source of
[1:42:22] fear here? What is the source of
[1:42:24] anxiety? What is the source of pulling
[1:42:26] back? It's because they started looking
[1:42:28] at themselves and they were giving a
[1:42:31] comparison of them to the circumstances,
[1:42:33] of them to the enemy, of them to the
[1:42:35] armies, of them to the
[1:42:37] cities. I don't know if you notice this,
[1:42:40] but we always lose the
[1:42:42] comparisons. That's the devil's job is
[1:42:45] to make the comparisons because if we
[1:42:46] live the lose the comparisons, we never
[1:42:48] enter the fight. That's what I'm saying.
[1:42:51] Don't do Satan's job for him. Don't
[1:42:53] build up the strength of your enemy.
[1:42:57] This too shall pass.
[1:43:01] Amen. You've been ordained to
[1:43:03] lose. I love
[1:43:05] it. Remember what we said. Fear comes
[1:43:08] from listening to a lie from Satan. And
[1:43:12] Satan's
[1:43:14] lie is to what? Get you focused on your
[1:43:17] condition rather than the word
[1:43:20] promise. God never said, "You're big
[1:43:22] enough to do it. You're strong enough to
[1:43:24] do it. You're skilled enough to do it.
[1:43:25] You've got enough numbers to do it. God
[1:43:27] said, "I'm going to do it." So why are
[1:43:30] we looking at ourselves? That's what
[1:43:32] caused them to not start in the first
[1:43:34] place. They started comparing
[1:43:35] themselves. Amen. Nothing the 10 spies
[1:43:39] said was untrue on the face of it. But
[1:43:43] remember what truth is or a lie is so
[1:43:45] many times. It's 99% truth. And what is
[1:43:47] it? It eliminates that one little detail
[1:43:50] that changes the context of everything.
[1:43:54] You ever have somebody tell you a story
[1:43:55] about a situation and they leave out
[1:43:57] that one little detail that if you knew
[1:43:58] that detail, it would put them in a bad
[1:44:00] light instead of the good light that
[1:44:01] they
[1:44:02] painted and they may have only done one
[1:44:04] thing wrong, but that one thing wrong
[1:44:05] changes everything. We all do it. It's
[1:44:08] human nature not to give the facts. What
[1:44:11] they did is they gave the facts, but
[1:44:12] they didn't give all the facts. They
[1:44:14] didn't give all the facts because they
[1:44:17] said what the land was like, but they
[1:44:18] didn't remind themselves of the promise.
[1:44:20] Caleb was the only one that had the
[1:44:22] faith to do that. Amen. What' they do?
[1:44:24] They forgot the whole word. They forgot
[1:44:27] the whole truth. And they took a partial
[1:44:29] truth. And a partial truth will bring
[1:44:31] you to fear every single time. You need
[1:44:34] the whole truth. The whole word.
[1:44:37] Amen. Or what Paul said in Romans. He
[1:44:40] says, "For what if some did not believe?
[1:44:42] Shall their unbelief make the faith of
[1:44:43] God without effect?" God's always got
[1:44:45] someone to believe. He says, "God
[1:44:47] forbid, ye, let God be true, but every
[1:44:50] man a liar." The only way you can tell
[1:44:53] the truth is to say everything the word
[1:44:55] says. Everything it says. That'll put
[1:44:57] everything in its proper place, in its
[1:44:59] proper context. Not pick it apart, not
[1:45:01] pick and choose. Not use anything in
[1:45:03] yourself to say, "I'm not worthy. I'm
[1:45:05] not able or anything." Say, "This is
[1:45:06] what the word says, and that's where I'm
[1:45:08] going to stand." That's the only
[1:45:09] foundation we have, church. What did
[1:45:12] Caleb do? He said, "Keep reading the
[1:45:13] word, folks. Keep reading the word. Go
[1:45:17] all the way into the promise because he
[1:45:18] said you'll drive them out. So, let's go
[1:45:20] do the driving out part. Instead of
[1:45:22] talking about how many of them there are
[1:45:23] and how big they are and how hard it's
[1:45:24] going to be and how impossible it's
[1:45:26] going to be, he said, "Let's just go and
[1:45:28] do it. God has brought us here. The
[1:45:30] pillar of fire is here. The word has
[1:45:32] been
[1:45:33] given. We're in the line of duty. Let's
[1:45:36] go in and do it." God didn't lead us up
[1:45:39] to take us
[1:45:41] back. Amen. God didn't lead us here to
[1:45:45] make us fall back. We're supposed to go
[1:45:47] forward.
[1:45:49] Why was it that Caleb could say this?
[1:45:51] Because he wasn't looking at
[1:45:53] himself. Caleb wasn't looking at
[1:45:56] himself. Caleb was looking at the God
[1:45:58] that made the
[1:45:59] promise. Caleb was looking at the pillar
[1:46:02] of
[1:46:03] fire. Caleb was looking at the God that
[1:46:05] had never left them
[1:46:07] hanging. He said, "He did it all the way
[1:46:09] here. He'll keep doing it." That's why
[1:46:12] they needed that book of remembrance so
[1:46:14] they could remind themselves from time
[1:46:15] to time, "Hey, God's with us."
[1:46:19] Amen. This farce of human ability won't
[1:46:22] get us in a rapture. Won't get us the
[1:46:23] victory. It won't take us through this
[1:46:25] life with overcoming power. We need a
[1:46:27] spirit of power and love and a sound
[1:46:28] mind. And that only comes by a heart
[1:46:31] that's subject to the word of God. And
[1:46:33] the only way that happens is by the
[1:46:35] spirit of God. Amen. Why? Because our
[1:46:37] faith got to be in the only thing that
[1:46:38] doesn't change or fail. And that's the
[1:46:40] word of God. That's the only thing we've
[1:46:42] been given that doesn't fail. Look at
[1:46:44] the result of this now. And all the
[1:46:47] congregation lifted up their voice and
[1:46:48] cried and the people we that wept that
[1:46:51] night. How you react is your choice,
[1:46:53] church, but your reaction will tell on
[1:46:56] you. The reaction here tells us what
[1:46:58] they were feeding on. And it's the same
[1:47:01] thing for us. Your influence will tell
[1:47:03] on you eventually. And here we see their
[1:47:05] responses. They're crying and they're
[1:47:07] weeping. Why? Because fear has crept in
[1:47:09] and faith has run out the door. And all
[1:47:12] the children of Israel murmured. They
[1:47:14] complained against Moses and against
[1:47:15] Aaron. And the whole congregation said
[1:47:17] unto them, "Would to God that we had
[1:47:19] died in the land of Egypt? Or would God
[1:47:21] we had died in this wilderness? And
[1:47:23] wherefore had the Lord brought us unto
[1:47:25] this land to fall by the sword that our
[1:47:27] wives and our children should be a prey?
[1:47:29] Were it not better for us to return unto
[1:47:32] Egypt?" Catch what they're saying,
[1:47:34] church. They said, "Listen, it would
[1:47:36] have been better if we never left Egypt
[1:47:38] in the first place. And has God taken us
[1:47:40] this far just to destroy us? God has
[1:47:43] provided their every
[1:47:46] need
[1:47:47] supernaturally and they're sitting here
[1:47:49] and saying, "Has God abandoned
[1:47:53] us?" What a ridiculous
[1:47:57] thought. But don't we think the same
[1:47:59] thoughts sometimes? We get so far and
[1:48:02] then we say, "Where is God? Where's the
[1:48:04] God of Vishel?
[1:48:06] Vashel." We get to a point and we say,
[1:48:08] "Has he abandoned me? Why am I going
[1:48:10] through this? If he started the work,
[1:48:13] he's going to be faithful to complete
[1:48:15] it. Go start reading your book of
[1:48:17] remembrance tonight. Go start looking at
[1:48:21] what he did because if he starts the
[1:48:23] work, he's got to finish a work.
[1:48:25] Otherwise, he's an imperfect
[1:48:28] God. The God that started it will be the
[1:48:31] God that's there all the way to the
[1:48:32] finish.
[1:48:35] Amen. God had done everything. destroyed
[1:48:37] Egypt completely, taken its wealth,
[1:48:39] brought them through the Red Sea, gave
[1:48:41] them water, gave them supernatural food,
[1:48:43] gave them a word, gave them a prophet,
[1:48:44] gave them a pillar of fire by by night
[1:48:46] and a pillar of cloud by day to keep
[1:48:48] them shaded, made sure the clothes
[1:48:50] didn't wear out, everything they had
[1:48:53] need of, every need supplied. And they
[1:48:55] come up and they haven't lost their
[1:48:57] needs, but they see a challenge in front
[1:48:59] of them, and they say, "God must have
[1:49:01] abandoned us. We'd be better off back in
[1:49:04] what we were in.
[1:49:08] complainers. That's what they were.
[1:49:10] That's all they could do. Church,
[1:49:12] complain. It's a sign of fear.
[1:49:16] Complaining because you've got no faith
[1:49:18] that God is in the story, that God is in
[1:49:20] the situation, that God is leading you,
[1:49:22] that God is guiding you, that God will
[1:49:24] provide you. Brother John Andy shared
[1:49:27] this. He didn't share it with me
[1:49:28] knowingly. He shared it on WhatsApp. And
[1:49:29] and I thought it was a wonderful quote
[1:49:31] just to take this evening.
[1:49:34] doesn't start so wonderful, but it ends
[1:49:36] wonderfully. You know, those people
[1:49:38] complained so much that Moses even lost
[1:49:40] his
[1:49:41] patience. Moses that stood in the gap
[1:49:43] for them eventually got so sick and
[1:49:45] tired of their complaining. That's how
[1:49:47] bad it was. Catch this now. He says, "I
[1:49:50] think one of the most horrible things is
[1:49:52] to see a man or a woman that's
[1:49:53] constantly
[1:49:55] complaining. I've always thought, God,
[1:49:57] keep me from it." See, that weakens
[1:49:59] faith all the time. You know,
[1:50:02] complaining weakens faith. He says, "I
[1:50:05] know." And now this is for you older
[1:50:09] folks. I know as they get older, each
[1:50:11] one of us, we're going to get something
[1:50:13] happen and something happen. And I know
[1:50:16] those little things are going to keep
[1:50:17] accumulating that as you get older, they
[1:50:19] just have to. That's the way it is
[1:50:21] sometimes. I'm getting a nod. things
[1:50:23] build up and things build up and our
[1:50:26] bodies don't start to they don't do what
[1:50:28] they used to do and our kids don't do
[1:50:30] what they used to do and the church
[1:50:31] doesn't do what it used to do and the
[1:50:33] preacher's
[1:50:35] different things change and it's not
[1:50:38] easy to go through change. Listen, I'm
[1:50:40] only 45 and I still don't like
[1:50:43] change. It's tough and guess what? We
[1:50:46] can let those things build up on
[1:50:49] us or we can have something else happen.
[1:50:52] He says, "But I think one of the most
[1:50:54] horrible things is for Satan to crown
[1:50:56] some person's life." Remember we read
[1:50:58] earlier that he crowns us with his
[1:51:00] loving kindness and tender
[1:51:01] mercies. He says, "A crabed old man or
[1:51:05] an old woman, you see, I hope I don't
[1:51:08] get to that place. I hope that I can
[1:51:10] bear it, my burdens." He said, 'I want
[1:51:12] my life crowned with the glory of God,
[1:51:16] his longsuffering, his gentleness, his
[1:51:19] peace, his meekness, and filled with the
[1:51:23] Holy Spirit. In other words, he says, I
[1:51:25] want to have an experience with God that
[1:51:27] lasts me to the end. Amen. God help our
[1:51:31] older people. It's tough dealing with us
[1:51:33] younger generation and the even younger
[1:51:35] generation and the changes that life
[1:51:37] brings and all of these different
[1:51:38] things. But we don't need any crabby old
[1:51:41] people here. We need solid, stable,
[1:51:45] loving,
[1:51:47] gracious old
[1:51:50] people.
[1:51:52] Amen. I was telling somebody, your
[1:51:54] pillars in the church, you don't have to
[1:51:55] move. You don't have to move. In fact,
[1:51:58] it's better if you don't. But stand
[1:52:00] still and be stable. That's what you're
[1:52:02] called to do. You're a stabilizing
[1:52:04] factor to this church. And crabby,
[1:52:07] stabilized people don't exist. They just
[1:52:10] don't work very well. He says, "I want
[1:52:12] my life crowned with the glory of God,
[1:52:14] his longsuffering, his gentleness, his
[1:52:16] peace, his meekness." He says, "And
[1:52:18] filled with the Holy Spirit." Now, watch
[1:52:21] what happens here. You talk about crabby
[1:52:23] people, your influence will tell on you
[1:52:25] and it comes out as crabiness a lot of
[1:52:27] times. I speak by experience. Amen. What
[1:52:30] is it? We let life get a hold of
[1:52:33] us. All of a sudden, things start to
[1:52:35] come out. We're starting to close now.
[1:52:39] He says they started, they cried and
[1:52:41] they
[1:52:42] cried. Watch what it turns now. Watch
[1:52:45] what fear turns into. And they said one
[1:52:48] to another, "Let us make a captain, and
[1:52:50] let us return unto Egypt." Fear leads
[1:52:54] you into
[1:52:56] rebellion. Complaining takes you into
[1:52:59] rebellion. What does complaining do?
[1:53:00] What happens? God's not doing it for me.
[1:53:02] I'm going to do it myself. And that is
[1:53:05] nothing less than rebellion against God.
[1:53:08] Amen. Now, they're going to pick their
[1:53:10] leader. God had given them a leader. And
[1:53:14] he was a leader that stood up for them,
[1:53:16] that stood in the gap for them, that
[1:53:18] protected them, that went to God and
[1:53:20] asked for mercy for those people. They
[1:53:22] had the best leader they could get. It
[1:53:24] was a man that was completely
[1:53:25] surrendered to God. And they said, "Let
[1:53:27] us pick a man now. And
[1:53:30] now, let us go back to
[1:53:33] Egypt." Problem is, church, they weren't
[1:53:35] turning away from Moses. They were
[1:53:36] turning away from God. And look at where
[1:53:38] it took them. It took them back to their
[1:53:41] original condition.
[1:53:43] That's how bad their complaining got was
[1:53:45] they thought it was better to go back to
[1:53:47] Egypt and be a slave than to stand as
[1:53:49] free men and women on the edge of the
[1:53:51] land of promise with a challenge ahead
[1:53:52] of
[1:53:53] them. Can you imagine wanting to go back
[1:53:57] to a life of
[1:53:58] slavery? That's how far it took
[1:54:02] him. Then Moses and Aaron fell on their
[1:54:05] faces before all the assembly of the
[1:54:06] congregation of the children of Israel.
[1:54:08] and Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the
[1:54:10] son of Japuna, which were of them that
[1:54:12] had searched the land, rent their
[1:54:13] clothes. And they spake unto all the
[1:54:14] company of the children of Israel,
[1:54:16] saying, "The land which we pass through
[1:54:17] to search it is an exceeding good land."
[1:54:20] They're saying, "Come on, guys. Let's
[1:54:22] preach it the way God gave it to us." He
[1:54:25] says, "If the Lord delight in us, then
[1:54:27] he will bring us into this land and give
[1:54:29] it to us a lamb which flows with milk
[1:54:31] and honey." Church, the Lord had
[1:54:33] delighted in them. He was delighting in
[1:54:35] them, and he will continue to delight
[1:54:37] with them.
[1:54:38] They were the apple of his
[1:54:40] eye. God's been with us. God's with us.
[1:54:42] God's going to keep being with us. Let's
[1:54:44] go ahead. They said, "Only rebel ye not
[1:54:47] against the Lord, neither fear ye the
[1:54:50] land, the people of the land, for they
[1:54:52] are bred for us. Their defense is
[1:54:54] departed from them, and the Lord is with
[1:54:56] us. Fear them not." This is where you
[1:55:00] see real faith stand up. Real character
[1:55:01] stand up. Everyone's screaming.
[1:55:03] Everyone's crying. Everyone's wondering,
[1:55:05] everyone's anxious. Everyone's lost all
[1:55:07] hope and they're saying listen to the
[1:55:10] word. Remember I said God gave them a
[1:55:12] menu of what they were going to eat.
[1:55:13] They said here's the
[1:55:14] menu. Anybody want to feels like eating
[1:55:17] some Amorites? Let's go get us some
[1:55:19] Amorites. Some Jebusites. Bring it on.
[1:55:22] Cuz God said we'll destroy them. Every
[1:55:24] single one. They're bread for us. Fear
[1:55:27] them not. Anybody here scared of bread?
[1:55:33] The
[1:55:35] densest piece of bread thrown at your
[1:55:38] head still ain't going to do a whole lot
[1:55:40] of damage, is it? Bread is not a worry
[1:55:43] or a concern to a soldier, is it? We eat
[1:55:47] it. It's not a weapon. He says, "These
[1:55:50] people, they're bread to us. We're going
[1:55:52] to eat them for breakfast, lunch, and
[1:55:56] supper."
[1:55:59] Yeah.
[1:56:02] Cancer, it's bred for
[1:56:05] us. Lost ones bound by Satan, it's bred
[1:56:10] for us.
[1:56:12] Why? He's got to destroy everything that
[1:56:14] comes against his
[1:56:16] children. Can't stand. He can't
[1:56:19] stand. But what happens? We look at that
[1:56:23] name cancer.
[1:56:26] We look at chronic
[1:56:28] diseases and we
[1:56:31] say
[1:56:32] big been there a long
[1:56:35] time been rough so
[1:56:38] far. No, they're bred for us. We're
[1:56:41] meant to conquer them. They're there for
[1:56:45] us to conquer
[1:56:47] them. That's our promise.
[1:56:53] But all the congregation bade stone them
[1:56:56] with stones. And the glory of the Lord
[1:56:58] appeared in the tabernacle of the
[1:57:00] congregation before all the children of
[1:57:01] Israel. And the Lord said unto Moses,
[1:57:04] "How long will this people provoke me?"
[1:57:06] And how long will it be before they
[1:57:08] believe me for all the signs which I
[1:57:10] have showed among them? What's it going
[1:57:12] to take for us to believe, church? How
[1:57:15] far does God have to take us before we
[1:57:17] stand on our own two feet and say,
[1:57:18] "Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. I
[1:57:21] finally believe or Lord, I'm going to
[1:57:24] keep believing. I've trusted you so far.
[1:57:26] I'm going to keep trusting you even when
[1:57:27] it looks like it's
[1:57:29] impossible. Depends what spirit's on
[1:57:32] us. He says, "Because these men which
[1:57:35] have seen my glory and my miracles which
[1:57:37] I did in Egypt and in the wilderness and
[1:57:39] have tempted me now these 10 times and
[1:57:42] have not hearkened to my voice." 10
[1:57:44] times God had given them a chance to
[1:57:45] believe and they turned them down. every
[1:57:47] time the whole congregation had failed
[1:57:50] except for
[1:57:51] two. He says, "Surely they shall not see
[1:57:54] the lamb which I swear unto their
[1:57:56] fathers, neither shall any of them that
[1:57:58] provoked me see it. But my servant
[1:58:00] Caleb, because he had another spirit
[1:58:03] with
[1:58:04] him, you say they didn't have the
[1:58:06] baptism of the Holy Spirit." They had an
[1:58:08] anointing on them, though. He had a
[1:58:11] different spirit, a spirit that's not a
[1:58:13] bondage again to fear.
[1:58:16] He says, "He hath followed me fully, and
[1:58:19] him will I bring into the land where
[1:58:21] unto he went, and his seed shall possess
[1:58:25] it." Amen. We're going to close here,
[1:58:28] but what is it that shows faith instead
[1:58:30] of
[1:58:33] fear? Kachi
[1:58:36] knows. What is it that shows faith
[1:58:38] instead of fear? It's always works. It's
[1:58:41] always works. It starts with a
[1:58:43] confession of the mouth. Now, that's not
[1:58:46] easy, is it? It's not easy to say, "I'm
[1:58:48] healed," is it? It's not easy to say,
[1:58:50] "He's my provider." It's not easy to
[1:58:52] turn down opportunities and say, "The
[1:58:53] Lord will
[1:58:54] provide." It starts with the mouth, but
[1:58:57] it's got to come down into the hands and
[1:58:59] the
[1:59:00] feet. It's got to come into the
[1:59:03] decisions. So, faith always
[1:59:05] moves where God wants fully. He says,
[1:59:09] "He hath followed me fully. He's done
[1:59:12] everything I've required of
[1:59:15] him. Faith
[1:59:17] trusts. Faith speaks. And then faith
[1:59:21] moves. That's it. Speaking is not
[1:59:24] enough, church. You got to move with it.
[1:59:27] You've got to act on it. Amen. Faith
[1:59:30] testifies of the word when circumstances
[1:59:33] don't seem to agree. Caleb says,
[1:59:36] "They're bred for us. We're more than
[1:59:38] able. We're going to win." And he's
[1:59:41] facing a land that's got way more people
[1:59:42] than they've got. Way more weapons, way
[1:59:44] more skills, big cities. They've got
[1:59:48] everything that Israel doesn't have. He
[1:59:49] says, "We're more than
[1:59:50] able, fully convinced that God was with
[1:59:55] them." That's how faith
[1:59:57] acts. Remember what it says in Hebrews
[2:00:00] 11. It says, "Without faith, it is
[2:00:01] impossible to please him. For he that
[2:00:04] cometh to God must first what? Believe."
[2:00:08] You got to have faith. But you got to
[2:00:10] have faith in two different things,
[2:00:11] church. Watch this now. You must believe
[2:00:13] that he is. And you've got to believe
[2:00:16] that he is a rewarder of them that
[2:00:18] diligently seek him. Amen. Faith is not
[2:00:20] based on what we can see or feel or hear
[2:00:24] or smell or
[2:00:26] touch. Faith is is based on a belief
[2:00:29] that first of all, God
[2:00:31] exists and that he rewards you when you
[2:00:34] come to after him. But you don't just
[2:00:38] come to him eh if he gives it, if he
[2:00:41] gives it, if he doesn't, he doesn't. It
[2:00:43] says them that diligently seek him.
[2:00:46] That's the ones that come and they
[2:00:51] knock. It's been a
[2:00:54] day. I should probably stop knocking.
[2:00:57] No, they knock until he
[2:01:00] opens. They call until he
[2:01:03] answers. Amen. They wait until he shows
[2:01:08] up on the scene and then they walk as
[2:01:12] long as he leads. That's what faith
[2:01:14] does. That's what faith does. It's it's
[2:01:18] those that can keep
[2:01:20] trusting even as things spiral into a
[2:01:23] worse condition many
[2:01:25] times. How many times do you see that in
[2:01:27] the scripture where things get worse
[2:01:28] before they get better? Look at Gyrus's
[2:01:30] daughter. Lord, if you'll come and touch
[2:01:32] her, she'll be okay. They're on the way
[2:01:35] back. Don't come. She's dead. Jesus
[2:01:39] says, "If thou can't believe, all things
[2:01:40] are possible." And he comes and he's in
[2:01:42] the house. Then, and he raises her from
[2:01:44] the
[2:01:47] dead. Diligently seeking means you don't
[2:01:49] stop until you have the word in your
[2:01:53] possession. Or maybe I would say it this
[2:01:55] way, until you have the word of your
[2:01:58] possession. You don't stop until you've
[2:02:00] got what he's promised you. That's those
[2:02:02] that diligently seek him. Brother Ram
[2:02:04] says this. He says this is the keynote
[2:02:06] to the scriptures. You know what a
[2:02:07] keynote is? A keynote is a central or
[2:02:10] fundamental element. We could also call
[2:02:13] it a keystone. A keystone is a thing
[2:02:16] that goes in and it locks a structure in
[2:02:18] place. He says this is the key note of
[2:02:21] the scriptures. Faith. He that cometh to
[2:02:24] God must believe that he is and a
[2:02:27] rewarder of those that diligently seek
[2:02:30] him. Amen.
[2:02:32] You know what faith does church? Faith
[2:02:35] makes it
[2:02:36] personal. Faith puts your name where
[2:02:40] there is no
[2:02:43] name. Where it says that he health all
[2:02:46] thy
[2:02:47] diseases. You don't say thy diseases.
[2:02:50] You say my
[2:02:51] diseases. Amen. That when we we we read
[2:02:55] in Acts 2:38 where it says the promise
[2:02:57] is unto you and to your children. You
[2:02:59] don't read your children. Amen. Sister
[2:03:01] Mor, we read Anna, right? We read David.
[2:03:05] We read Martha. We read Sharon. We read
[2:03:09] Naomi. We read those that have gone
[2:03:12] away. We say the promise is still for
[2:03:14] them. We're not looking to the
[2:03:16] circumstance. We're looking to the word.
[2:03:18] And we write the names in by faith. We
[2:03:20] make it personal to us. What good is a
[2:03:23] God that heals you but won't heal
[2:03:26] me? I'm not saying he's useless. I'm not
[2:03:28] trying to say that. But if he's my God,
[2:03:30] then I want him to heal me, too. A God
[2:03:33] whose promises are only for Justine, but
[2:03:35] not for Sister
[2:03:37] Brenda. That's not a God I believe
[2:03:40] in. Amen. Faith puts your name next to
[2:03:43] it. And when you put your name next to
[2:03:45] it, now it's your inheritance. Now it
[2:03:48] belongs to you. Now you've got rights.
[2:03:51] Now you got authority. Now you've got
[2:03:53] the ability to say, "Lord, you enforce
[2:03:55] it. Now I put my name there.
[2:04:00] Every redemptive blessing, remember,
[2:04:01] we've been taught every redemptive
[2:04:03] blessing has been given to the church
[2:04:06] when Christ died at Calvary. He says,
[2:04:07] "And you've been handed a blank check,
[2:04:10] and all you got to do is have faith to
[2:04:12] write your name on the check." That's
[2:04:15] it. That's what faith does. It makes it
[2:04:19] personal to you, not just to everybody
[2:04:22] else. Amen. God bless you. Let's
[2:04:25] stand. I'll tell you this. What is it
[2:04:28] that makes faith personal to us? And
[2:04:31] this is where we'll start next service,
[2:04:33] Lord
[2:04:34] willing. It's personal because it starts
[2:04:37] with the fact that he loved us. And he
[2:04:40] loves us. And everything that we have is
[2:04:43] because he loves us. The hardship is
[2:04:45] because he loves us. The good times is
[2:04:47] because he loves us. The challenges are
[2:04:50] because he loves us. The trials are
[2:04:51] because he loves us. That in everything
[2:04:54] we're going through, it's for our good.
[2:04:56] That's Romans 8:28. We know that all
[2:04:59] things work for
[2:05:00] good to them that love God, who are the
[2:05:04] called according to his purpose. Our
[2:05:06] faith is resting on the fact that he
[2:05:08] loves us and there's nothing we're going
[2:05:10] through that isn't going to benefit us
[2:05:12] in the long run. Amen. And there's no
[2:05:14] promise that he withholds from us except
[2:05:17] for a time and that's to prove our faith
[2:05:20] and to show that God is in control.
[2:05:22] Amen. God bless you. Let's bow our
[2:05:24] heads. Heavenly
[2:05:26] Father, Lord, our faith is in one thing.
[2:05:30] It's that you chose us. We didn't choose
[2:05:32] you, Lord. And that you've given us your
[2:05:34] spirit, Lord. And that's our only hope
[2:05:37] of overcoming in this world, Lord. It is
[2:05:39] your work from before the foundation of
[2:05:42] the world, from before time ever began,
[2:05:44] before we ever stepped foot onto this
[2:05:46] earth, Lord. It is your word. It is your
[2:05:48] choosing. It is your election, Lord. And
[2:05:51] even the very faith that we have comes
[2:05:53] from you, Lord. We're resting in you
[2:05:55] this morning. We're not resting in our
[2:05:57] frame, our abilities, our strengths,
[2:05:59] Lord. But Lord, I'm trusting this more,
[2:06:02] this evening, we're not held back, Lord,
[2:06:04] by those things either, Lord, but that
[2:06:06] we're looking to the perfect God that
[2:06:08] has called us, that has filled us, that
[2:06:10] has anointed us to take you at your
[2:06:12] word, heavenly father. Lord, I pray you
[2:06:15] increase our faith tonight, Lord. and
[2:06:16] over these coming days. Lord, we thank
[2:06:19] you for your goodness in the meetings
[2:06:20] this past week. Lord, we're thankful for
[2:06:22] faith that brought so many to stand and
[2:06:24] claim you at your word. Lord, to take
[2:06:26] you at your promises, Lord. I pray you'd
[2:06:29] build up our faith, Lord. Help us to
[2:06:31] hold fast, to diligently seek, Lord, to
[2:06:33] hold, Lord, to stand the test, Lord,
[2:06:36] that we come out on the other side,
[2:06:37] Lord, with a full victory each one. We
[2:06:39] pray, Lord. Grant we ask in Jesus
[2:06:41] Christ's name we pray it. Amen.
[2:06:48] Amen. Do you know that song Jesus hold
[2:06:50] my hand as I travel?
[2:06:54] 795.
[2:06:57] Amen. I sing this pretty quick just so
[2:06:59] you
[2:07:00] know. As I travel through this pilgrim
[2:07:05] land, there is a friend who walks with
[2:07:09] me.
[2:07:12] He leads me safely through the sinking
[2:07:16] sand and it is the Christ of
[2:07:19] [Music]
[2:07:22] Calary. Oh, this would be my prayer,
[2:07:26] dear Lord, each day to help me do the
[2:07:30] best I
[2:07:33] can. For I need thy light to guide me
[2:07:38] day and night. Blessed Jesus, hold my
[2:07:44] hand.
[2:07:46] Jesus, hold my
[2:07:49] hand. I

[2:08:10] [Music]
[2:08:12] plea. Oh

[2:08:17] me. When I kneel in prayer, I know I'll
[2:08:22] meet you there. Blessed Jesus, hold my
[2:08:29] hand. Oh, when I wander through the
[2:08:33] valley into the
[2:08:36] setting of the
[2:08:40] sun. Lead me safely to the land of
[2:08:45] rested by a crown of life have won.
[2:08:52] Oh, I have put my faith, dear Lord, in
[2:08:56] thee that I may reach the golden
[2:09:01] strand. Oh, there's no other friend on
[2:09:06] whom I can depend. Blessed Jesus, hold
[2:09:11] my
[2:09:14] hand.
[2:09:16] Jesus, hold my hand. And I
[2:09:21] need thee every
[2:09:25] hour

[2:09:30] land. Protect me by thy
[2:09:35] saving
[2:09:36] power.
[2:09:38] Hear my people please.
[2:09:42] Oh
[2:09:44] Lord, look down on
[2:09:47] me. As I kneel in prayer, I know I'll
[2:09:52] meet you there. Blessed Jesus, hold my
[2:09:59] hand. Oh, let me travel in the light
[2:10:04] divine that I might see the blessed way.
[2:10:11] Keep me that I may be holy thine and
[2:10:16] sing
[2:10:17] redemption song
[2:10:21] someday. Oh, I will be a soldier great
[2:10:26] and true and ever
[2:10:29] firmly take a stand.
[2:10:33] Oh, as I
[2:10:35] onward and daily meet the flow. Blessed
[2:10:40] Jesus, hold my
[2:10:44] [Applause]
[2:10:45] hand. Jesus, hold my hand.

[2:11:23] you there. Blessed Jesus, hold my
[2:11:29] hand. He has made me glad. I will enter
[2:11:32] his gates. It is

[2:18:01] before we go, we're going to sing that
[2:18:03] song. Feeling so much better. It's
[2:18:06] number three. Feeling so much
[2:18:09] better. Amen. Trust we're feeling better
[2:18:11] this
[2:18:12] evening. Trusting we're enjoying the
[2:18:14] presence of the Lord. Trusting his
[2:18:17] promises. Amen. Amen. Remember the needs
[2:18:20] that have been mentioned already. Pray
[2:18:22] for one another. I wanted to thank the
[2:18:23] Lord for his grace with my eye. It
[2:18:25] certainly has been healing very, very
[2:18:27] quickly. Getting back to normal very
[2:18:29] quickly. And I'm just very thankful.
[2:18:31] Amen. I'm thankful that I don't have to
[2:18:33] deal with it and thankful that it's
[2:18:35] going away. Amen. Doctors can do
[2:18:38] everything they do, but it takes God to
[2:18:40] heal. We know that. Amen. And the
[2:18:42] surgeon was very pleased. He said, "It
[2:18:44] went better than I expected. I got
[2:18:45] everything out of it." And he said, "But
[2:18:47] it looks pretty big." And when I came
[2:18:48] out, my wife, she just looked at me in
[2:18:50] horror because it it wasn't lumpy the
[2:18:53] way it was, but it was so swollen and
[2:18:55] bloody and just a real mess to it. And
[2:18:57] it didn't look good for about a day and
[2:18:58] a half, but then it started to really
[2:19:00] clear up. And you know, Satan will punch
[2:19:02] at you. You know, we're going to get
[2:19:05] into this maybe next service, but he
[2:19:06] says, you know, yeah, your eyes taken
[2:19:08] care of, but it'll the eyelid will never
[2:19:09] be the same, and you'll have a lopsided
[2:19:11] face, and the eyelid's going to be
[2:19:13] stretched out, and then it's going to
[2:19:14] come back. Satan likes to beat up on us.
[2:19:16] He likes to put fear in us. Amen. But
[2:19:18] all I've been saying is, Lord, you're
[2:19:21] the healer. You're the promisekeeper.
[2:19:24] It's your word. I'm just going to keep
[2:19:26] saying it's doing better every day. And
[2:19:28] guess what? It's doing better every day.
[2:19:31] So, I want to praise the Lord for that.
[2:19:32] I'm very thankful. Thankful for your
[2:19:33] prayers. Thankful for your concerns.
[2:19:35] Thankful for your close stairs to see
[2:19:38] how it's going every time. Amen. But
[2:19:40] it's good to be on the healing side of
[2:19:42] things. That's for sure. Amen. So,
[2:19:43] praise the Lord for that. Let's just
[2:19:45] sing this. And uh, Brother Vich, I'm
[2:19:47] going to ask you to close in prayer
[2:19:48] tonight if you
[2:19:50] would. Feeling so much better. We're
[2:19:54] talking about this good old bread.
