[38:09] Amen.
[39:29] Before I drew a single breath, before
[39:35] the light had touched my skin, you
[39:38] formed
[39:42] me.
[39:45] before I knew you even cared. And every
[39:50] moment since, you've always been for
[39:57] me.
[40:00] It's still you that I want. It's still
[40:05] you that I want. Oh,
[40:11] it's still you that I want after
[40:16] everything.
[40:19] You're still my everything.
[40:23] Before I heard about the cross, you went
[40:27] to Calvary and beyond
[40:31] to know
[40:34] me.
[40:37] From when I played the prodal to when I
[40:42] stumbled home, your love came running.
[40:51] It's still you that I want. It's still
[40:55] you that I want. Oh,
[41:02] it's still you that I want. After
[41:06] everything,
[41:08] you're still my everything.
[41:17] It was you inside the desert when I had
[41:22] nothing to eat. And it was you back in
[41:26] the fire saying, "Child, you're safe
[41:30] with me." And it was you who tamed the
[41:34] lions till they drifted off to sleep.
[41:38] And it was you who held the waters. So I
[41:42] barely wet my feet. And it's your heart
[41:46] that draws me closer. It's your hand
[41:49] that's guiding me. And it's your
[41:52] shoulder that I cry on. How those
[41:55] shoulders carried me. And it's your ways
[41:59] that I'm still learning. It's your grace
[42:03] that I still need. And it's your word
[42:06] that I build my life on. It is the lamp
[42:10] onto my feet. And it's your stripe that
[42:13] brought my healing. It's your death by
[42:16] which I rise. And if your grave don't
[42:20] have a body, that means death ain't
[42:23] holding mine. And it's your song I'll
[42:27] sing forever. Unener
[42:30] by time. Let angels ask me in a thousand
[42:35] years who my heart desires. It's still
[42:39] you.
[42:45] It's still you that I hold. Oh,
[42:51] it's still you that I want after
[42:56] everything.
[42:58] You're still my everything.
[43:02] After everything.
[43:05] Still my everything.
[43:08] After everything.
[43:11] It's still you for me.
[43:15] After everything,
[43:18] you're still my everything.
[44:23] bright.
[44:26] Do you remember
[44:31] way back to your former
[44:37] where you was
[44:40] stood in position
[44:44] having dominion and all things under
[44:47] your feet.
[44:50] But you fell.
[44:53] You fell from that fellowship
[44:57] and you wonder
[44:59] where you went wrong.
[45:03] So you cry out. Yes, you do.
[45:08] You thirst for the latter rain
[45:12] and you'll fight for the power again.
[45:17] See the palmer came in your life and
[45:22] ate. Then the conqueror came in your
[45:27] life and ate. Then the caterpillar and
[45:31] locus.
[45:33] But God promised.
[45:36] Yes,
[45:37] he promised.
[45:40] And I will restore,
[45:44] say the Lord.
[45:46] I will restore
[45:50] the Lord.
[45:52] Jehovah promised a Holy Ghost promise.
[45:58] I will restore.
[46:01] Thus say the Lord.
[46:04] I will restore.
[46:07] Thus say the Lord.
[46:11] Power
[46:13] shall come from an eye
[46:18] after the Holy Ghost comes upon you. And
[46:23] you shall be witnesses
[46:26] unto me throughout the world.
[46:30] All my glory shall all men behold.
[46:35] Oh, I shall come
[46:39] unto you as a former rain
[46:42] and as a latter rain. To you shall I
[46:46] come and all men shall know
[46:51] that you have the evidence
[46:55] that my Jesus rose from the dead
[47:01] and in your own atmosphere in your
[47:04] atmosphere.
[47:06] God will visit you. He will visit you
[47:11] there. For you were meant to be mighty
[47:15] men of our love.
[47:20] And I will restore,
[47:23] say the Lord.
[47:26] I will restore,
[47:28] say the Lord.
[47:31] Jehovah promised a Holy Ghost promise.
[47:37] I will restore.
[47:39] Thus says the Lord,
[47:42] I will restore.
[47:45] Thus says the Lord,
[47:49] power
[47:52] shall come from an eye
[47:56] after the Holy Ghost comes upon you. And
[48:01] you shall be witnesses
[48:04] unto me throughout the world.
[48:09] All my glory shall all men behold.
[48:13] Oh, I shall come.
[48:17] Unto you as a farmer rain,
[48:21] as a latter rain, to you shall I come.
[48:25] And all men shall know
[48:29] that you have the evidence
[48:33] that my Jesus he rose from the dead
[48:38] and in your own atmosphere
[48:41] your atmosphere.
[48:44] God will visit you. He will visit you
[48:48] there. For you were meant to be mighty
[48:52] men of all.
[48:58] And I will restore,
[49:00] say the Lord.
[49:03] I will restore,
[49:06] say the Lord.
[49:09] Jehovah promise, a Holy Ghost promise.
[49:14] I will restore,
[49:17] thus say the Lord.
[49:20] I will restore,
[49:23] thus say the Lord. And I will restore,
[49:28] say the Lord.
[49:31] I will restore,
[49:33] says the Lord.
[49:36] They over promised a Holy Ghost promise.
[49:42] I will restore.
[49:44] Thus, say the Lord.
[49:47] I will restore.
[49:50] Thus, say the Lord. Jehovah promised. A
[49:55] holy ghost promise.
[49:58] Jehovah promised a Holy Ghost promised.
[50:04] I will restore.
[50:07] Thus say the Lord.
[50:10] I will restore.
[50:13] Thus say the Lord.
[51:50] Lord, I hear you calling me
[51:55] into a deeper life.
[52:01] Away from all my doubts and fears.
[52:06] away from all my strife.
[52:11] And through the noises around me, I can
[52:17] hear your still small voice
[52:21] calling me
[52:24] to walk a little closer.
[52:31] You're calling me
[52:35] to walk a little closer.
[52:43] Dear Lord, I hear you calling me
[52:48] into a deeper life.
[52:54] Away from all my doubts and fears.
[52:59] Away from all my st.
[53:04] And through the noises around me, I can
[53:10] hear your still small voice
[53:14] calling me
[53:17] to walk a little closer.
[53:24] calling me
[53:27] to walk a little closer.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Teach me how.
[53:35] &gt;&gt; Teach me how I must spend my time.
[53:41] As the days roll on,
[53:46] I need to know I'm growing with the
[53:51] breaking of each dawn.
[53:56] Give me more of your spirit that I can
[54:01] live more conscious, Lord, so I can walk
[54:09] the lane. little
[54:12] closer
[54:15] so I can walk
[54:19] a little
[54:22] closer.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; I've seen you pray.
[54:27] I've seen you break the barriers down
[54:32] but separated
[54:35] us.
[54:37] Now in you I have more confidence.
[54:43] In you I've learned to trust.
[54:48] growing in my understanding
[54:53] of your holy love. Now I will walk
[55:00] a little
[55:03] closer.
[55:07] Now I will walk
[55:11] a little
[55:14] closer.
[55:15] Teach me how
[55:20] I must
[55:24] as the days roll on.
[55:29] I need to know I'm growing with the
[55:34] breaking of each.
[55:39] Give me more of your spirit that I can
[55:45] live more conscious, Lord, so I can walk
[55:52] a little
[55:55] closer.
[55:58] So I can walk
[56:02] a little
[56:05] closer. I've seen you pray.
[56:10] I've seen you break the barriers down
[56:15] and separate
[56:18] us.
[56:20] Now in you I have more confidence.
[56:25] In you I've learned to trust.
[56:30] I'm growing in my understanding.
[56:36] of your holy love. Now I will walk
[56:43] a little
[56:46] closer.
[56:49] Now I will walk
[56:53] a little
[56:56] closer.
[56:57] Calling me. You're calling me
[57:03] to walk a little closer so I can walk.
[57:10] &gt;&gt; So I can walk
[57:13] a little
[57:16] closer.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Now I will walk.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Now I will walk
[57:23] a little
[57:26] closer. Yes, I will walk. Yes, I will
[57:31] walk. Walker
[57:37] closer.
[57:58] Amen.
[58:02] We want to walk a little closer each and
[58:06] every day.
[58:08] Praise the Lord. Joined the specialists.
[58:10] They were just wonderful.
[58:13] Amen. I'm sure the Lord was pleased with
[58:15] them all.
[58:17] Amen. Why don't we stand
[58:21] and uh let's sing uh 10:05
[58:26] the chorus. Touch your people once
[58:28] again.
[58:30] Just the chorus. There you go. We'll
[58:32] sing that as our brother comes and be in
[58:35] prayer for him as he brings the word and
[58:39] we're all expecting tonight
[58:42] just like we were expecting last night,
[58:43] but we're expecting more tonight. See,
[58:46] praise the Lord cuz God's got more to
[58:47] give. Amen. Praise the Lord.
[58:52] Okay, let's sing it and uh we'll turn it
[58:55] over to brother John when he comes.
[59:02] Touch your people once again
[59:09] with your precious holy
[59:13] hand
[59:15] we pray. Let your kingdom shine upon
[59:21] this earth
[59:24] through a glorious
[59:27] church. Hallelujah.
[59:30] Not for temporary
[59:37] but to restore authority
[59:43] and power. Let a mighty rushing wind
[59:49] blow
[59:50] in.
[59:53] Hallelujah.
[59:55] Touch your people once again
[1:00:01] and touch your people once again.
[1:00:09] Bring your glory.
[1:00:14] We pray. Let your kingdom shine upon
[1:00:20] this earth
[1:00:23] through a living glorious
[1:00:26] church.
[1:00:29] Not for temporary
[1:00:36] but to restore authority
[1:00:42] and power a mighty rushing wind
[1:00:54] touch your people once again.
[1:01:00] Amen. That's our prayer, isn't it? You
[1:01:02] know, the prophet of God would say, "Let
[1:01:04] the Holy Ghost take the meeting." Amen.
[1:01:07] I remember I don't remember cuz I wasn't
[1:01:09] there, but the scripture talks about
[1:01:11] when Solomon dedicated the temple. And
[1:01:13] the presence of God was so powerful that
[1:01:15] none could even speak. And they just sat
[1:01:18] there and they based in the presence of
[1:01:20] God.
[1:01:22] You know, brother Aaron and I were
[1:01:24] talking on the way over and he said,
[1:01:25] "You know, I I understand why they call
[1:01:27] it the foolishness of preaching
[1:01:31] because God could do it so many other
[1:01:32] ways. He could speak from heaven. He
[1:01:35] could do it in a miraculous way. He
[1:01:37] could do it direct to our minds and our
[1:01:39] thoughts, but he chose men to do it."
[1:01:42] Amen. And it works if we'll let him work
[1:01:44] and if we'll believe that he's working
[1:01:46] through it. Amen. So, we're here tonight
[1:01:48] to not to hear Aaron preach
[1:01:51] Not to hear a minister preach. We're
[1:01:53] here to see the Holy Ghost do a work in
[1:01:55] his people by his servant. Amen. So,
[1:01:59] we're going to sing that song, Fill My
[1:02:01] Cup, Lord, I lift it up, Lord, as we
[1:02:04] hand it over to him. It's good to see
[1:02:05] each one here. Good to see Jod and Karen
[1:02:08] with us tonight. Good to see brother
[1:02:09] Filon made it with sister Joanne. God
[1:02:11] bless you. Each one that's here tonight.
[1:02:13] We do this for the body. I love to bring
[1:02:16] ministers in and my friends and get the
[1:02:18] fellowship, but it's for the sake of the
[1:02:20] body. And so we just want to absolutely
[1:02:22] ring everything we can out of these out
[1:02:24] of these weekend meetings. So just lift
[1:02:27] your need up to him as we sing this this
[1:02:28] morning. God knows your heart and God
[1:02:31] can pull that minister
[1:02:33] down that path that he needs to go to
[1:02:36] address your need tonight. He can take
[1:02:38] him off his notes. He can change his
[1:02:40] sermon. He can change the entire
[1:02:41] direction of a service just for the need
[1:02:44] of one of his children. Amen. So you
[1:02:46] come in faith tonight. You come
[1:02:47] believing and you lift up your hand. You
[1:02:49] say, "Lord, I've got a need tonight." As
[1:02:51] you sing this and you watch what he does
[1:02:53] throughout the weekend for you. Amen.
[1:02:55] Let's sing this as brother Aaron comes.
[1:03:00] Fill my cup,
[1:03:04] Lord.
[1:03:06] I lift it up,
[1:03:10] Lord.
[1:03:13] So come and quench
[1:03:18] this thirsty
[1:03:20] of my soul.
[1:03:27] Bread of heaven.
[1:03:32] Feed me till I want to.
[1:03:40] Fill my cup,
[1:03:44] fill it up, and make me home.
[1:03:53] So fill my cup.
[1:04:00] I give me
[1:04:15] my soul
[1:04:21] of heaven
[1:04:27] You are
[1:04:30] God
[1:04:33] with my
[1:04:37] lift
[1:04:38] up and make me.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that one more time tonight.
[1:04:46] Oh, till my cup
[1:04:50] Lord
[1:04:53] I lift it up
[1:05:01] and
[1:05:04] this thirsting
[1:05:06] of my soul
[1:05:12] and bread of heaven.
[1:05:19] me till I walk.
[1:05:23] No more
[1:05:26] is my God
[1:05:33] and me.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is that your desire tonight? That
[1:05:40] he would come and fill your cup a fresh
[1:05:42] and a new. that like they sang in the
[1:05:45] song that we could just have a closer
[1:05:46] walk. Lord, that's our desire is just to
[1:05:49] take another step tonight. That's it.
[1:05:51] Let's just bow our heads to him. Father,
[1:05:54] Lord, if we could just ask one thing,
[1:05:56] Lord, it would just be, Lord, that you
[1:05:57] would come and draw us closer to you,
[1:05:59] Father. That you'd come and take control
[1:06:01] of this service, Lord. That you would
[1:06:03] just speak, Lord, to your children.
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; Lord, move me aside. Don't let me be a
[1:06:08] hindrance. Don't let my notes be a
[1:06:10] hindrance. Don't let anything hinder
[1:06:12] this service, Father. Lord, if it be for
[1:06:14] one, that's worth it all. Lord, if it be
[1:06:17] for all of us, we're here to receive it.
[1:06:18] Lord, we we thank you. We we praise you,
[1:06:21] Lord. There's there's none like you in
[1:06:23] heaven and earth. And I just want to
[1:06:24] give you thanks, Lord, that I have the
[1:06:26] opportunity, Lord, to worship you in
[1:06:28] spirit and truth tonight, Lord. I pray
[1:06:30] it'll please you. I pray that you'll
[1:06:32] move and take control. And Lord, that
[1:06:34] the human element, Lord, will be limited
[1:06:36] so that the supernatural element, Lord,
[1:06:38] can be magnified in our life. Thank you
[1:06:41] for that. Father, we just look to your
[1:06:43] word now and ask that you'll bless it in
[1:06:45] Jesus name. Amen. Thank you very much.
[1:06:48] If if you have your Bibles with you
[1:06:51] tonight, you'd like to turn with me to
[1:06:52] the word, we're going to look in Genesis
[1:06:54] 1, verse one. We're going to start
[1:06:56] Genesis 1:1, read through verse three,
[1:06:59] and then we're also going to look in
[1:07:00] Ephesians 2.
[1:07:03] Amen.
[1:07:05] Isn't God good to us? Amen. Praise the
[1:07:08] Lord. We just thank God for this
[1:07:09] opportunity. Thank our good friend,
[1:07:11] brother John, once again for the
[1:07:13] invitation and just thank you all for
[1:07:15] your support, your love, your
[1:07:16] friendship. I I truly count it an honor
[1:07:19] to to be with you. Amen. Genesis 1:1.
[1:07:22] Tonight we're going to speak on the war
[1:07:25] for for atmospheres.
[1:07:27] The war for atmospheres. And I I guess
[1:07:29] you can say in some ways we're kind of
[1:07:31] continuing a theme from last night
[1:07:33] because the truth is we're in a fight.
[1:07:34] We're in a battle. And nothing's going
[1:07:36] to come easy to us. You know, we're
[1:07:38] called to it. We we can't relax because
[1:07:42] the atmosphere of the day is like a
[1:07:43] raging river. And I've told our young
[1:07:45] people at home, Satan doesn't have to
[1:07:47] get you to recant. He only has to get
[1:07:50] you to relax. Because if you relax in a
[1:07:53] raging river, it's going to take you
[1:07:54] away. Amen. So, it's a constant battle
[1:07:57] to gain ground. Amen. And it's a real
[1:07:59] battle that we're in. Genesis 1:1, it
[1:08:02] says, "And in the beginning, God created
[1:08:04] the heaven and the earth. And the earth
[1:08:06] was without form and void, and darkness
[1:08:08] was upon the face of the deep. And the
[1:08:10] spirit of God moved upon the face of the
[1:08:12] waters. And God said, "Let there be
[1:08:15] light." And there was light. Amen. If
[1:08:18] you'll also look with me in Ephesians 2,
[1:08:20] Ephesians 2 and verse one, we'll read
[1:08:23] down through verse 7.
[1:08:26] And verse one says, "And you hath he
[1:08:28] quickened who were dead in trespasses
[1:08:31] and sins." I say, "Amen." Thank you,
[1:08:33] Jesus. Right there. Amen. Where in time
[1:08:36] past you walked according to the course
[1:08:38] of this world, according to the prince
[1:08:40] of the power of the air, the spirit that
[1:08:43] now worketh in the children of
[1:08:45] disobedience, among whom also we all had
[1:08:48] our conversation in times past in the
[1:08:51] lust of our flesh, fulfilling the
[1:08:53] desires of the flesh and of the mind,
[1:08:55] and were by nature the children of
[1:08:57] wrath, even as others. But God,
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; but God, Amen. who is rich in mercy, for
[1:09:07] his great love wherewith he loved us,
[1:09:09] even when we were dead in sins, hath
[1:09:11] quickened us together in with Christ by
[1:09:13] grace you are saved, and hath raised us
[1:09:16] up together, and made us sit together in
[1:09:18] heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in
[1:09:21] the ages to come, he might show the
[1:09:23] exceeding riches of his grace and his
[1:09:25] kindness towards us through Christ
[1:09:28] Jesus. Amen. and you may have your seats
[1:09:30] this evening.
[1:09:38] You know, we live in a time and I don't
[1:09:40] have to tell you this if you pay
[1:09:42] attention at all to your surroundings.
[1:09:44] We're in a time where where the
[1:09:46] atmosphere is around us is very
[1:09:49] unsettled.
[1:09:50] uh many many times I think we don't
[1:09:53] recognize even as Christians the
[1:09:55] significance and the role of atmospheres
[1:09:58] in our lives. Amen. I think it's
[1:10:00] important uh to have the right
[1:10:03] atmosphere if you want a good marriage.
[1:10:04] It's important to have the right
[1:10:06] atmosphere if you want to uh to have a
[1:10:08] good home. It's important in our church
[1:10:10] services. Amen. We we have to create the
[1:10:12] right atmospheres. And I I would go so
[1:10:15] far to say that the importance of
[1:10:17] atmosphere to to a Christian really
[1:10:19] cannot be overstated. Uh brother Brandon
[1:10:22] would make it very clear to us that it
[1:10:24] takes the right atmosphere in order to
[1:10:26] bring results. And I just want to throw
[1:10:28] a uh read a few quotes to you real quick
[1:10:31] just to establish this. Brother Brandham
[1:10:33] says we cannot have a healing service
[1:10:35] here until people gets in the spirit of
[1:10:38] a healing service. We cannot have a
[1:10:40] filling of the Holy Ghost until people
[1:10:42] gets in that kind of an atmosphere. And
[1:10:45] he says, "Wake the people up to a
[1:10:48] spiritual atmosphere." Oh, it it takes
[1:10:50] that to bring children into the kingdom.
[1:10:52] It takes the atmosphere. He says,
[1:10:55] "Right, this night while we're sitting
[1:10:57] here, if if this right atmosphere would
[1:11:00] take place, this entire group would be
[1:11:03] refilled with the Holy Ghost. Every sick
[1:11:06] person would be made well. It's the
[1:11:08] atmosphere that does it. Amen. He goes
[1:11:10] on to say, "God's word under the right
[1:11:13] atmosphere will produce exactly what it
[1:11:16] says it'll do. It's got to be in the
[1:11:18] right atmosphere, though." And one thing
[1:11:21] is, Satan recognizes this as well. And
[1:11:24] so, he wars against the atmosphere. He
[1:11:27] stirs things up at home. He stirs things
[1:11:29] up on the job. He he stirs things up on
[1:11:32] your way to church, maybe between you
[1:11:34] and the spouse, maybe a a a sideways
[1:11:38] word is said, something to get you off
[1:11:40] track. So when you come into the house
[1:11:42] of God or even go about your daily
[1:11:43] business, your atmosphere is disturbed.
[1:11:46] Your atmosphere is all stirred up and
[1:11:49] it's in order to hinder faith to keep
[1:11:51] you from receiving all that you could
[1:11:54] receive if you were operating under the
[1:11:56] right atmosphere. Amen. So, so, so it's
[1:11:59] imperative that we recognize this and in
[1:12:02] turn we fight to foster the right kinds
[1:12:05] of atmospheres in our lives. Of course,
[1:12:08] it's important in the house of God, but
[1:12:10] I would say it's important in the home
[1:12:12] even more so that you raise children in
[1:12:15] the right atmosphere, that your marriage
[1:12:17] operates under a right atmosphere, that
[1:12:19] you carry the right atmosphere about you
[1:12:21] as you go about your day-to-day business
[1:12:23] to show the world that you don't have to
[1:12:25] live tore up. You don't have to live
[1:12:27] agitated. You don't have to live bowed
[1:12:29] down. But you operate in an atmosphere
[1:12:31] of peace and an atmosphere of the Holy
[1:12:34] Spirit. Amen. Because I if the
[1:12:36] negativity
[1:12:38] of the atmosphere around you can get to
[1:12:40] you because look, you're not going to
[1:12:42] change the atmosphere of the world. All
[1:12:45] right? But you can't let that atmosphere
[1:12:47] get to you and begin to operate through
[1:12:49] you because then what happens is it
[1:12:51] begins to rob you and those around you.
[1:12:55] that if you come in from a frustrated
[1:12:57] day at work and you bring that uh that
[1:12:59] atmosphere into the home and you begin
[1:13:01] to fuss and quarrel, you begin to rob
[1:13:03] the peace from the home. So it doesn't
[1:13:05] just rob you. When you let that
[1:13:07] atmosphere get to you, you also allow it
[1:13:10] to rob those around you. Amen. But but
[1:13:13] when a man lives in the negative, when
[1:13:16] that atmosphere of this negative world
[1:13:18] and that pressure begins to press in and
[1:13:20] he allows it to get in and he begins to
[1:13:23] live in the negative, then he will
[1:13:24] produce negative results.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Negative people produce negative
[1:13:30] results. Really, it's a self-fulfilling
[1:13:32] prophecy.
[1:13:34] You got that woe is me atmosphere and
[1:13:36] attitude and and that's what you're
[1:13:38] going to produce. Well, it never happens
[1:13:41] for me.
[1:13:43] God never moves for me and everything
[1:13:45] goes wrong for me. And then what happens
[1:13:48] is it bleeds over into your attitude at
[1:13:51] church. And you come not expecting God
[1:13:54] to bless you. You come not expecting God
[1:13:58] to move for you and not expecting him to
[1:14:01] deliver you and not expecting him to
[1:14:03] answer your prayers. And what happens is
[1:14:05] your expectations are met.
[1:14:10] your expectations are met and you leave
[1:14:12] saying, "See, I knew it." But if you
[1:14:15] would come saying, "I know today is my
[1:14:17] day. I know the word says he's going to
[1:14:19] answer. I know God's going to move. He
[1:14:21] promised to meet me here. I'm coming
[1:14:24] saying, God, today this is my service.
[1:14:26] This is my moment. This is when you're
[1:14:28] GOING TO OPERATE IN MY FAMILY. This is
[1:14:30] when you're going to deal with my child.
[1:14:32] I'm expecting it." And then those
[1:14:34] expectations WERE MET. WHAT A DIFFERENT
[1:14:36] TESTIMONY WE WOULD HAVE WALKING out of
[1:14:38] the house of God.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's like the story years ago of
[1:14:42] the man that that that put 10 cents into
[1:14:45] the offering plate and then he didn't
[1:14:47] like what was preached and he didn't
[1:14:48] like how the service went. So on the way
[1:14:50] back out the door, he reached in and
[1:14:52] took his 10 cents back. And his son was
[1:14:55] with him. He said, "You know, Daddy, if
[1:14:56] you'd have put more in that the first
[1:14:58] time, you'd have got more out of it.
[1:15:01] If we had come with the attitude of I'm
[1:15:03] going to put everything into this. I'm
[1:15:05] I'm going to pour everything into this
[1:15:07] service. I'M GOING TO POUR EVERYTHING
[1:15:08] into Monday. I'M GOING TO POUR
[1:15:10] EVERYTHING INTO TUESDAY. I'm going to
[1:15:12] give my all to create an atmosphere that
[1:15:14] fosters love and peace and joy and raise
[1:15:17] my children IN THAT ATMOSPHERE. YOU'LL
[1:15:19] GET A LOT MORE OUT of it at the end.
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; It's a battle for atmospheres.
[1:15:26] But if you become negative, it becomes a
[1:15:29] cycle of negativity that hinders you and
[1:15:31] and many times it can hinder the service
[1:15:33] as a whole.
[1:15:35] I say we got to fight for the right
[1:15:36] atmosphere.
[1:15:38] Why is it a fight? Because because
[1:15:40] what's all around us produces
[1:15:42] negativity. It wears us down. It gets to
[1:15:46] us. And so it's a fight for the right
[1:15:49] atmosphere. I I say let's fight for the
[1:15:51] right mental attitude. What the prophet
[1:15:54] of God tell us? That the right mental
[1:15:55] attitude towards any promise of God
[1:15:58] would bring it to pass. So you know the
[1:16:00] devil knows it. So what's he going to
[1:16:01] do? He's going to fight you in the mind.
[1:16:03] He's going to fight that right mental
[1:16:05] attitude. I say it's worth fighting for
[1:16:06] tonight. Let's fight for the atmosphere
[1:16:09] in our homes and and fight for the
[1:16:11] atmospheres in our service. I I look
[1:16:13] around, I realize there's a lot to be
[1:16:15] negative about. I see that the world's
[1:16:17] falling apart. I know international
[1:16:20] tensions are high. I know things are
[1:16:23] stressful. But what I also KNOW IS THAT
[1:16:25] MY GOD is faithful. I know that he
[1:16:27] hasn't left us here. I know that he's
[1:16:29] right on time. Things got stressful for
[1:16:32] the three Hebrew children. But they
[1:16:34] said, "WE WON'T BOW. OUR GOD IS ABLE.
[1:16:36] BUT EVEN IF he does it, even if he does
[1:16:39] it," I'm standing here saying, "I know
[1:16:41] our God is able even now." Yes, the
[1:16:45] world's falling apart, but I know his
[1:16:47] word is true and I know that I can trust
[1:16:50] him and I can live in an atmosphere of
[1:16:52] faith even when everything around me is
[1:16:54] doubt and fear and unbelief and
[1:16:57] crumbling. I say in the midst of all
[1:16:59] this, WE HAVE A PROMISE.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; OH, LISTEN. Think about how Rahab must
[1:17:04] have been with that scarlet thread
[1:17:05] hanging out of her window. Her house was
[1:17:08] on the wall. You don't think she began
[1:17:11] to to to feel the wall shake? You don't
[1:17:14] believe that? She could hear the screams
[1:17:16] right outside her door and the crumbling
[1:17:18] and THE STONES FALLING. IT WAS ABSOLUTE
[1:17:21] CHAOS. BUT SHE HAD A PROMISE. OUT OF THE
[1:17:24] CHAOS. YOU'RE GOING TO COME OUT OF THIS
[1:17:26] AND YOUR LOVED ONES ARE going to come
[1:17:27] out of this. WHY? SHE HAD A PROMISE SHE
[1:17:30] WAS HOLDING ON TO. I SAID, "I'M NOT
[1:17:32] WORRIED ABOUT THE WALLS FALLING and the
[1:17:34] stones and the crumbling and the
[1:17:35] earthquakes and the wars and what this
[1:17:37] president's doing and how EVERYTHING'S
[1:17:39] GOING TO UNFOLD. WHAT I KNOW IS WE HAVE
[1:17:42] A WORD. WE HAVE A PROMISE AND we're
[1:17:44] going to come out of this thing safe."
[1:17:47] Hallelujah.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:17:52] I know that the world gets in an uproar
[1:17:54] over the atmosphere,
[1:17:57] but they're more about global warming.
[1:18:00] They get in an uproar about
[1:18:04] the climate and the weather and and I
[1:18:06] know Satan can get into those things too
[1:18:09] and stir things up.
[1:18:11] But the atmosphere that I'm really
[1:18:12] speaking of is is the surrounding
[1:18:14] influences
[1:18:16] and the spiritual and even the political
[1:18:18] environment in which we live.
[1:18:21] You know, the time that we live in has
[1:18:22] been placed by a prophet in scripture as
[1:18:26] the Leoysian age. It's the last age,
[1:18:32] as we would say. It's the end time,
[1:18:35] the wrapping up of all things where
[1:18:37] where the whole thing that was planned
[1:18:39] from the beginning winds up and there's
[1:18:41] a rapture of the bride.
[1:18:45] You know, I think about I know God had
[1:18:47] it all pre-planned, but I I think about
[1:18:50] from the very beginning, eons, however
[1:18:52] far back. I know you can't even put a
[1:18:53] time on God, but whenever he began
[1:18:56] thinking of this and planning this and
[1:18:58] and all that's gone on down through
[1:19:00] history, and yet I have the privilege to
[1:19:02] stand here at the the end time.
[1:19:05] I have the privilege to stand here at
[1:19:06] the blending of time and eternity.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; Think about where we're standing in this
[1:19:12] day. And I say there's never been a day
[1:19:14] like this day.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; There's never been a day like this day.
[1:19:17] And it's a great day to be a believer.
[1:19:19] And but but but just as the scriptures
[1:19:22] foretold, it's a time of instability.
[1:19:24] It's a time of godliness and immorality.
[1:19:27] Second Timothy 3, he he lays out the
[1:19:30] characteristics of the last days. And
[1:19:32] and I'm going to go through it quickly.
[1:19:33] He says it'll be perilous times. That
[1:19:35] means dangerous.
[1:19:37] Lovers of themselves. That means
[1:19:38] selfish. Blasphemers, unholy, no natural
[1:19:42] affection, false accusers, fierce, that
[1:19:44] means savages,
[1:19:46] despisers of those who are good, lovers
[1:19:48] of pleasure. 1 Timothy 4:1 says, "Now
[1:19:52] the spirit speaketh expressly in the
[1:19:54] latter time shall some shall some shall
[1:19:57] depart from the faith, giving heed to
[1:19:59] seducing spirits, doctrines of devils,
[1:20:01] speaking lies, and hypocrisy, having
[1:20:04] their conscience seared with a hot
[1:20:06] iron." Matthew 24 tells us that nation
[1:20:09] shall rise against nation and kingdom
[1:20:11] shall rise against kingdom. To me, the
[1:20:14] accuracy at which this describes the
[1:20:16] current state of the world's condition
[1:20:18] is astounding.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; You can look at the scripture and
[1:20:21] realize this is where we stand.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; This is where we are. It's the end time
[1:20:26] and the atmosphere is tore up and
[1:20:28] whipped up by devils. It's atmospheres
[1:20:30] of oppression, atmospheres of attacking,
[1:20:32] atmospheres of hatred, nervousness.
[1:20:35] Everybody's on edge. There's atmospheres
[1:20:37] of fear and anxiety
[1:20:39] and there's no peace here in this world
[1:20:41] because the atmosphere is unsuitable for
[1:20:44] peace because the one who has dominion
[1:20:47] over the kingdoms of this earth is a
[1:20:50] liar and a murderer.
[1:20:53] Look here Jesus said in St. John St.
[1:20:56] Matthew 24 said you'll hear of wars,
[1:20:58] rumors of wars and wars and war. Why?
[1:21:00] Because the prince of the earth, Satan,
[1:21:03] the power of the nations, there is a
[1:21:06] national spirit here, a national spirit
[1:21:08] here. It's devils. They can't get along
[1:21:11] with one another. See, so notice the
[1:21:14] current atmosphere we live in is
[1:21:17] controlled by the devil, brother. And
[1:21:20] why is there no peace? And why can't
[1:21:21] people just get along? I want peace on
[1:21:23] earth.
[1:21:25] It's not going to happen.
[1:21:29] You know, I I saw a guy talking the
[1:21:31] other day, and I don't I don't mean this
[1:21:32] as a joke, but many times we we point to
[1:21:34] the old times and we point back and
[1:21:37] we're like, "Man, it was so much better
[1:21:38] then." And the guy said, "Was it
[1:21:40] really?" He said, "Because I read in in
[1:21:42] the first couple chapters of the
[1:21:44] beginning, there was murder."
[1:21:47] He said, "Man, Eden was a dangerous
[1:21:48] place."
[1:21:51] I realized we're talking about after the
[1:21:52] fall. And I realized, you know, and I I
[1:21:54] got to think about it. I said there's
[1:21:55] never truly been peace on earth because
[1:21:57] ever since the fall, the one who
[1:21:59] controls it all is a liar. The one who
[1:22:02] controls it all is a a a murderer. The
[1:22:05] prince of the power of the air isn't
[1:22:08] just referring to weather.
[1:22:12] He controls atmospheres. And and brother
[1:22:14] Brandon would tie that scripture
[1:22:16] multiple times right to the temptation
[1:22:18] of Jesus where Satan tries to get him to
[1:22:20] bow down and worship him. says the Bible
[1:22:23] said so Satan is the prince of the power
[1:22:25] of the air and every nation is under his
[1:22:28] dominion domination the scripture says
[1:22:32] that Satan quoted it to Jesus said the
[1:22:34] whole world all these kingdoms are mine
[1:22:37] and I'll do with them what I will so we
[1:22:41] look at that and we we realize all those
[1:22:43] scriptures we read about the end time
[1:22:44] they must be fulfilled it it must come
[1:22:47] to pass the end time must be that evil
[1:22:49] the atmosphere must be that disturbed
[1:22:52] these things must come to pass. But as
[1:22:54] bleak as that sounds, I want to
[1:22:56] encourage us tonight to look away from
[1:22:58] those things. Those scriptures should
[1:23:00] not shake us because they aren't the
[1:23:02] events that identify us. They aren't the
[1:23:05] events that speak about us. Sure, we
[1:23:07] recognize them as markers in time.
[1:23:10] That's what we recognize them are. But
[1:23:12] they're scriptures about the kingdoms of
[1:23:14] this world. THERE'S SCRIPTURES ABOUT THE
[1:23:16] MEN of this world. But there are OTHER
[1:23:18] SCRIPTURES WHERE WE FIND OUR PLACE.
[1:23:21] Malachi 4:5, "Behold, I will SEND UNTO
[1:23:24] YOU, ELIJAH THE PROPHET, before the
[1:23:26] coming of the great and dreadful day of
[1:23:28] the Lord." I SEE RIGHT THERE A promise
[1:23:31] of restoration sent unto me. Acts 2:17,
[1:23:34] "And it shall come to pass when in the
[1:23:37] last days, sayaeth God, I WILL POUR OUT
[1:23:39] MY SPIRIT upon all flesh, and your sons
[1:23:42] and your daughters SHALL PROPHESY, AND
[1:23:44] YOUR young men shall see visions, and
[1:23:46] your old men shall dream dreams." That's
[1:23:49] where I find my place. I'm in the last
[1:23:51] days. Yes. Well, WHAT'S GOING ON? ARE
[1:23:53] YOU SHAKING? NO. I'M EXPERIENCING A
[1:23:55] POURING OUT OF THE SPIRIT OF GOD. I'M
[1:23:57] EXPERIENCING A CLOSER WALK. I'M
[1:23:59] EXPERIENCING MORE OF HIM than I've ever
[1:24:01] experienced BEFORE BECAUSE HE PROMISED
[1:24:04] TO DO IT IN THE LAST DAYS.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; First Thessalonians 4:17, "Then we which
[1:24:09] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:24:11] together with them in the clouds to meet
[1:24:14] the Lord in the air, and so shall we
[1:24:16] ever be with the Lord." When I think
[1:24:18] about the last days, this is where I
[1:24:20] find my identification. Oh, we're all
[1:24:23] going down. No, we're not. There's been
[1:24:25] a vision that when the church went down,
[1:24:27] THERE WAS A BRIDE THAT WENT UP. SO, AS
[1:24:30] THE world crumbles and people fall AND
[1:24:32] PEOPLE STRUGGLE, DO YOU LIKE TO SEE IT,
[1:24:34] BROTHER? NO, I don't like to see it, but
[1:24:36] I can identify WHERE I'M STANDING. AND
[1:24:38] I've been told, "Look up." I SAY, "LOOK
[1:24:42] UP TONIGHT. YOUR REDEMPTION DRAWETH
[1:24:44] NIGH."
[1:24:46] HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Get your focus off all the bad and
[1:24:50] recognize we're about to go home,
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; church. We're about to go home. He
[1:24:55] promised Malachi 4 and he did it. He
[1:24:58] promised restoration and he did it. He
[1:25:00] promised to pour out his spirit and he's
[1:25:02] doing it. He promised healing and he's
[1:25:04] doing it. HE PROMISED SALVATION AND HE'S
[1:25:07] doing it. I say THEY HOLD TO YOUR
[1:25:09] PROMISE TONIGHT. HE PROMISED THAT
[1:25:11] PRODALS WOULD COME BACK. HE'S GOING TO
[1:25:12] DO IT. He promised healing. HE'S GONNA
[1:25:15] DO IT. HE PROMISED A RAPTURE. HE'S GONNA
[1:25:18] DO IT.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN. He promised to come back. And to
[1:25:25] the believers, the air is charged, not
[1:25:27] with confusion, not with fear, not with
[1:25:30] doubt, but the air in the atmosphere is
[1:25:32] charged with anticipation of his return.
[1:25:39] Brother Brham spoke about the atmosphere
[1:25:41] in Jerusalem
[1:25:42] when Jesus
[1:25:45] was coming to the city. You know that
[1:25:47] was an end time too. It was the ending
[1:25:50] of the Jewish dispensation.
[1:25:53] There was Roman oppression.
[1:25:55] Politics were awful. Pharisees and
[1:25:58] Sadducees are fighting amongst
[1:25:59] themselves. Zealots are riding in the
[1:26:02] streets. Fighting Romans in the streets.
[1:26:04] The atmosphere was awful in Jerusalem,
[1:26:07] but to those expecting him, they weren't
[1:26:11] focused on that. The atmosphere was
[1:26:14] charged with his coming. He says, "But
[1:26:17] those who were waiting, they knew their
[1:26:20] Lord had promised to come to the feast.
[1:26:22] And they were waiting, gathering
[1:26:24] themselves on the street and in little
[1:26:26] rooms and anywhere they could, talking
[1:26:28] and waiting. And the whole atmosphere
[1:26:31] was charged with his coming." I say, how
[1:26:34] charged should we be tonight after
[1:26:37] everything we've seen, after everything
[1:26:38] has been restored, after all God has
[1:26:40] done for us? How excited should we be?
[1:26:43] Living in an atmosphere of anticipation,
[1:26:45] living in an atmosphere of faith, an
[1:26:47] atmosphere of of expectation, watching
[1:26:50] and looking and appearing, waiting for
[1:26:52] him to appear any any single day. I I
[1:26:55] say the atmosphere should be charged in
[1:26:56] our homes, not not walking around in
[1:26:58] doubt and oh no, this one did this and
[1:27:00] this one did that. DON'T GET YOUR EYES
[1:27:02] OFF THE FACT THAT JESUS SAID HE'S COMING
[1:27:05] BACK. HE'S COMING TO THE FEAST. I SAY
[1:27:07] GET READY. GATHER AT THE GATE. GET YOUR
[1:27:09] EYES ON THE PROMISE. HE'S ABOUT TO
[1:27:12] RETURN. I CAN FEEL THE CHANGE IN THE
[1:27:14] ATMOSPHERE.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; I CAN FEEL THE CHARGE IN THE ATMOSPHERE.
[1:27:18] IT WON'T BE LONG, CHURCH. AND THE DEAD
[1:27:20] IN CHRIST ARE GOING TO RISE. LOVED ONES
[1:27:22] ARE GOING TO APPEAR. And one of these
[1:27:24] days, YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE A STEP
[1:27:28] WOO FROM TIME INTO ETERNITY. AND THERE'S
[1:27:31] GOING TO BE A BODY CHANGE IN A MOMENT,
[1:27:33] IN A TWINKLING OF AN EYE. THAT IS A
[1:27:36] PROMISE. THAT'S NOT A FAIRY TALE. THAT'S
[1:27:38] NOT A PIPE DREAM. THAT'S THE WORD OF THE
[1:27:40] LORD TONIGHT.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; You can feel it in the atmosphere.
[1:27:48] The Christian knows it's the coming of
[1:27:50] the Lord. See, there's an atmosphere. It
[1:27:53] depends on what you're looking at.
[1:27:56] For our Lord has strictly told us what
[1:27:58] was going to happen at that time. And we
[1:28:01] don't know the minute or the hour, but
[1:28:03] know that we are nearing something now.
[1:28:07] You can feel it in the atmosphere.
[1:28:10] Days about to break.
[1:28:13] And yet, even though we feel the charge,
[1:28:16] it's a constant war to live and to
[1:28:20] operate in the right atmosphere. It's a
[1:28:23] constant fight because we're affected by
[1:28:26] the atmosphere that surrounds us. We
[1:28:27] like to think we're not we're affected
[1:28:31] by it.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Book of Revelation would would describe
[1:28:34] it as a smoke that comes from the
[1:28:36] bottomless pit. So you let you let a
[1:28:39] fire get started in your house and it
[1:28:42] may not touch anything but get your
[1:28:44] clothes out of the closet or go camping.
[1:28:47] You may not get burnt by the fire but
[1:28:50] smell your clothes the next day.
[1:28:52] You can always smell the smoke. There's
[1:28:55] a stench from it. It gets on you.
[1:28:58] And and and I understand we're not
[1:29:00] living in this world, but sometimes as
[1:29:01] you walk through it, it it gets on you
[1:29:04] and and sometimes it it might affect
[1:29:06] your thinking a little bit and it might
[1:29:08] wear on you a little bit. It's a
[1:29:09] constant struggle and it surrounds us at
[1:29:12] all times. So we so so we got to fight
[1:29:14] to keep the right frame of mind. We have
[1:29:17] to fight to have the right attitudes
[1:29:18] towards promises, towards everyday life,
[1:29:22] towards church,
[1:29:24] towards people,
[1:29:26] people around us because atmospheres
[1:29:29] affect people. You got to be willing to
[1:29:32] war against the atmospheres and fight to
[1:29:34] create the right ones. You know, the
[1:29:36] atmosphere of Jerusalem, like we said in
[1:29:39] that time, in many ways, it was a lot
[1:29:41] like like the one that we're in. It was
[1:29:42] a time of turmoil. It was a time of
[1:29:44] struggle. It was a time that the Jewish
[1:29:47] people felt forsaken. They felt all
[1:29:49] alone. And there was a priest named
[1:29:52] Zachcharias. And the scripture says in
[1:29:54] Luke 1 and6 that he was righteous before
[1:29:57] God. It's a righteous man. He's a
[1:29:59] believer. Says, "And they were both
[1:30:02] righteous before God." How many of you
[1:30:04] would like him to say that about you?
[1:30:07] walking in all the commandments and
[1:30:10] ordinances of the Lord,
[1:30:14] blameless.
[1:30:16] This is a pretty incredible testimony
[1:30:19] for a man to have this written in
[1:30:21] scripture about him. And yet,
[1:30:24] if I were to ask you, hey, what do you
[1:30:26] know about Zachchariah? Most of the
[1:30:27] time, you don't reference this scripture
[1:30:31] because this isn't what he's remembered
[1:30:33] for.
[1:30:35] What's he remembered for?
[1:30:38] Because see, listen, if we're not
[1:30:40] careful, even the most ardent believers
[1:30:42] can let circumstances wear them down. We
[1:30:46] can let the spirit of the age affect our
[1:30:48] thinking. And we let the testimony of
[1:30:50] our lips reflect the doubt that has
[1:30:52] crept in, and we speak and act in ways
[1:30:56] contrary to the promise.
[1:30:59] And right there in the service, the
[1:31:02] angel comes to deliver a message of
[1:31:04] John's birth right in the middle of the
[1:31:06] service as he's doing service in the
[1:31:08] temple. And instead of rejoicing in it,
[1:31:11] instead of accepting it, instead of
[1:31:13] testifying of the miracle, he gives
[1:31:15] voice to the circumstances.
[1:31:19] He gives voice to the symptoms.
[1:31:22] He gives voice to the atmosphere of
[1:31:24] doubt that surrounds him. And he SAYS,
[1:31:26] "I I CAN'T believe this. I'm too old.
[1:31:31] MY WIFE IS too old.
[1:31:34] This is impossible." And you know, if
[1:31:36] you go read the story, it's amazing to
[1:31:38] me. It actually talks about how they'd
[1:31:40] been praying for this.
[1:31:42] And so the angel comes, says, "Your
[1:31:44] prayers have been answered." And he's
[1:31:45] like, "No."
[1:31:48] It makes me question, do we even believe
[1:31:50] the things we say we're praying for?
[1:31:53] Are we actually expecting them to be
[1:31:55] met? Because if he had been expecting
[1:31:58] it, he'd have been like, "Praise the
[1:31:59] Lord. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS
[1:32:01] EXPECTING. I KNEW THIS was going to
[1:32:03] happen. I knew he WAS GOING TO ANSWER. I
[1:32:05] KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO SHOW UP. I SAW IT
[1:32:07] IN THE SCRIPTURES. I SAW HOW YOU TOOK
[1:32:09] Abraham and Sarah, even though they were
[1:32:11] old AND YOU GAVE HIM A CHILD." He even
[1:32:14] had examples in THE SCRIPTURE TO LOOK
[1:32:15] TO. But instead, he says, "No,
[1:32:20] I don't believe this." As a matter of
[1:32:22] fact, if you go down into the
[1:32:23] interpretation of it, it actually says,
[1:32:25] "I can't be made to believe this."
[1:32:30] And that is what we remember him more
[1:32:32] for is that he doubted and he was made
[1:32:36] dumb, that he wasn't allowed to speak
[1:32:39] even though he was righteous.
[1:32:43] The atmosphere of the day had wore on
[1:32:45] him. The negativity and the doubt had
[1:32:48] wore him down.
[1:32:50] And I wonder how many times does an
[1:32:52] angel come and begin to speak to you in
[1:32:54] a service,
[1:32:57] speak to you directly about things
[1:33:00] you've been dealing with in your heart,
[1:33:02] dealing with in your life. And right
[1:33:04] there, the word begins to be the
[1:33:06] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[1:33:08] the heart and walk right down your path.
[1:33:09] And we respond with, "But my situation
[1:33:12] is different.
[1:33:16] My situation's impossible." But Lord,
[1:33:19] and we speak doubt right in the face of
[1:33:21] the promise
[1:33:23] because we live in an atmosphere of
[1:33:26] doubt. We live in an atmosphere where
[1:33:29] we're beat down. And what happens is
[1:33:31] doubt will steal your voice.
[1:33:34] Doubt will steal your testimony.
[1:33:37] Zachchariah was never able after this
[1:33:39] moment to go forth and testify of what
[1:33:41] God was doing. His testimony was stolen.
[1:33:44] And we've been told by a prophet
[1:33:46] messenger that the bride is the final
[1:33:48] voice to the final age. And we can't let
[1:33:51] doubt steal our voice. We can't let
[1:33:54] doubt steal our voice. There's a voice
[1:33:55] that's going to be crying out that
[1:33:57] there's a living God. That there is
[1:33:58] salvation. That there is the miraculous,
[1:34:00] that there is the supernatural, that you
[1:34:02] can be saved in this day. THERE'S GOT TO
[1:34:04] BE SOMEBODY CRYING OUT. HE STILL MOVES.
[1:34:07] HE STILL SAVES. HE STILL DELIVERS. DON'T
[1:34:10] LET DOUBT ROB YOUR VOICE. OH, BUT LET
[1:34:12] FAITH TAKE OVER. GIVE VOICE TO FAITH
[1:34:14] TONIGHT. A LIVING FAITH, AN ACTIVE
[1:34:17] FAITH, A FAITH IN ACTION. YES, LORD.
[1:34:19] THAT'S WHAT I'M EXPECTING. I SAY, ASK
[1:34:22] GOD FOR BIG THINGS TONIGHT AND EXPECT
[1:34:24] him to meet those needs.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, a story comes to my mind right now
[1:34:29] of a king and a man came to this king
[1:34:31] and I'm gonna skip a lot of it just for
[1:34:33] the sake of time and he comes in and he
[1:34:35] was known to be a cruel king. He was
[1:34:38] known to be one that was difficult to
[1:34:39] deal with. And this peasant came in and
[1:34:42] he said, "I have need of 500 acres and a
[1:34:45] 100 head of cattle and I need a new
[1:34:47] wagon and I need this and I need oxen."
[1:34:49] And the king said, "Done."
[1:34:52] And he walks out and his servants come
[1:34:54] to him and they're like, "What what just
[1:34:55] happened? I've seen you say no to a man
[1:34:58] that needed a chicken. I've seen you say
[1:35:00] no to to men who needed who came and
[1:35:02] asked for nothing. Just just a little
[1:35:04] bit." He said, ' Because finally
[1:35:07] somebody came and asked me for that that
[1:35:10] only a king COULD GIVE. NOBODY ELSE
[1:35:13] COULD MEET THAT NEED. NOBODY ELSE COULD
[1:35:15] DO THAT. FINALLY, SOMEBODY ASKED ME TO
[1:35:18] DO SOMETHING THAT ONLY I COULD DO. DON'T
[1:35:21] BE AFRAID TO ASK HIM BIG THINGS. DON'T
[1:35:24] LET YOUR KIDS only hear you say, "God
[1:35:26] bless us tonight and watch and keep us."
[1:35:28] That's wonderful. BUT LET THEM HEAR YOU
[1:35:30] CRY OUT FOR BIG THINGS, FOR TOUGH
[1:35:32] THINGS, FOR THINGS THAT TAKE ACTIVE
[1:35:34] FAITH. And then LET THEM SEE YOU MARCH
[1:35:36] WITH YOUR SHOULDERS BACK SAYING, "I'M
[1:35:37] GOING TO SEE IT. I'M GOING TO RECEIVE
[1:35:39] IT. I'M GOING TO HAVE IT BECAUSE I SERVE
[1:35:41] A GOD THAT IS ABLE."
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Walk in an atmosphere of
[1:35:48] faith.
[1:35:49] Don't let doubt steal your voice. Walk
[1:35:52] in an atmosphere of believing.
[1:35:55] Because see, there was a little girl
[1:35:56] living at the same time, surrounded by
[1:35:59] the same evil, chaotic atmosphere. and
[1:36:02] she receives a message from the same
[1:36:04] angel and it's a more unbelievable
[1:36:06] message, shall we say. She didn't have a
[1:36:09] scripture to look back to where this had
[1:36:11] been done before. But he comes and he
[1:36:13] says, "Oh, THE HOLY GHOST IS GOING TO
[1:36:15] OVERSHADOW YOU. You're going to have a
[1:36:17] child." And in that moment, she go,
[1:36:19] "Well, I don't understand how this is
[1:36:20] going to happen. You don't understand.
[1:36:21] I'm a virgin and this and that." SHE
[1:36:23] SAYS, "BE IT UNTO ME, LORD. LORD,
[1:36:26] WHATEVER IT IS YOU SAY, BE IT UNTO ME.
[1:36:28] YOUR PROMISES, BE IT UNTO ME. YOUR WORD
[1:36:30] BE IT UNTO ME. MY HEALING BE IT UNTO ME.
[1:36:33] MY CHILDREN. MY FAMILY. THE RAPTURE BE
[1:36:36] IT UNTO ME, LORD. WHATEVER YOU SAY. I'M
[1:36:39] JUST GOING TO SAY YES LORD. I ACCEPT IT
[1:36:41] TONIGHT.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Let's be a Mary tonight. Not a
[1:36:45] Zacharias.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Let's be a Mary. Yes, Lord. Be it unto
[1:36:50] me according to thy word.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:55] Walking in an atmosphere of faith. I
[1:36:57] believe today more than I've ever
[1:36:59] believed, Lord. Yeah, but you didn't
[1:37:00] receive it yesterday, and I believe more
[1:37:02] today. What if it don't happen today,
[1:37:04] brother? And I'll believe more tomorrow.
[1:37:06] It's just going to be a greater miracle
[1:37:08] when I receive it. But I'm going to walk
[1:37:10] in an ATMOSPHERE OF FAITH. YOU ARE MY
[1:37:12] HEALER. YOU ARE MY RESTORE. You are
[1:37:15] restoring my joy. You are coming back
[1:37:17] for a bride. It's atmosphere that
[1:37:21] produces results one way or the other.
[1:37:25] What kind of atmosphere are we living
[1:37:27] in?
[1:37:29] Several quotes here.
[1:37:31] Brother Brandham says, "It's the
[1:37:32] attitude of the people that brings the
[1:37:35] results."
[1:37:37] That's the reason at Pentecost they had
[1:37:38] to go to an upper room and pray until
[1:37:40] the Holy Ghost came because they got in
[1:37:42] one place, one accord. It's the
[1:37:45] atmosphere
[1:37:47] that brings the results,
[1:37:50] he says. And that's the same thing it is
[1:37:52] here this afternoon. That's what I'm
[1:37:54] speaking for. If we can get the right
[1:37:56] kind of heavenly atmosphere, something's
[1:37:59] going to happen. See, atmosphere,
[1:38:03] he says, "And brethren, may I say this
[1:38:04] with reverence
[1:38:07] and respect to you as my brethren,
[1:38:10] knowing that maybe before tonight, we'll
[1:38:13] all stand at the judgment seat of Christ
[1:38:15] in heaven." And look, may I say this?
[1:38:18] Now, you notice he's laying this down
[1:38:20] pretty thick. He's saying, "I'm saying
[1:38:21] this with reverence. I I don't want to
[1:38:23] offend, but we may stand at the judgment
[1:38:25] seat tonight. He's letting you know this
[1:38:26] is an important statement.
[1:38:29] Look, may I say this that it's the
[1:38:31] atmosphere always that brings forth the
[1:38:34] product. See,
[1:38:36] so I want to say this when we encourage
[1:38:39] worship, when we encourage people to
[1:38:42] enter in, when we say pour your heart
[1:38:44] into it, when we say let the spirit
[1:38:46] flow, let there be freedom in the
[1:38:48] spirit, IT'S NOT A WORKUP. IT'S CREATING
[1:38:52] AN ATMOSPHERE.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; THAT'S what it's all about. I I I don't
[1:38:56] want a A A SHOUT FOR THE SAKE OF A
[1:38:58] SHOUT. I DON'T WANT TO DANCE FOR THE
[1:38:59] sake of a dance. I DON'T WANT YOU TO
[1:39:01] RAISE YOUR HAND FOR THE SAKE OF DOING
[1:39:02] IT. BUT I WANT YOU TO DO IT SO YOU
[1:39:04] WELCOME HIM INTO THE HOUSE OF GOD. AND
[1:39:07] YOU SAY, "LORD, I'M HERE TO RECEIVE. I'M
[1:39:09] HERE TO WORSHIP." WHY YOU DOING IT?
[1:39:11] BECAUSE HE'S WORTHY OF MY WORSHIP. HE'S
[1:39:13] WORTHY OF MY PRAISE. HE'S WORTHY OF
[1:39:15] EVERYTHING THAT I CAN GIVE HIM TONIGHT.
[1:39:20] WELL, how how am I supposed to worship,
[1:39:21] brother Aaron? How am I supposed to do
[1:39:23] it? However God leads you to do it.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; You know, we get in discussion many
[1:39:28] times with people about I don't know why
[1:39:31] we're going here, but here we are.
[1:39:33] Well, what about dancing and shouting
[1:39:35] and running and all those things? Is is
[1:39:37] that is that okay? Absolutely. Is it
[1:39:38] okay? Am I supposed to do that? No.
[1:39:41] There's no supposed to. You're supposed
[1:39:43] to worship God the way you're called.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; You're supposed to worship
[1:39:49] The Bible actually says praise him in
[1:39:51] the dance. Did y'all know that?
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't say maybe you should. It
[1:39:56] says praise him in the dance. You say,
[1:39:59] "Well, that means everybody should do
[1:40:00] it." No, it also says praise him on the
[1:40:01] organ. Everybody here is not going to
[1:40:03] play the organ.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Okay? But it's letting you know that is
[1:40:07] a way he is to be praised.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; So you're going to have one person maybe
[1:40:12] on the piano. I'll give an example.
[1:40:15] He comes through many times and he's
[1:40:17] looking for a fresh drink. Brother
[1:40:19] Brandon would say, "A fresh drink of
[1:40:20] Pentecostal water." He's looking for a
[1:40:22] certain praise. Okay? Now, when David
[1:40:25] desired a drink from the well and he
[1:40:26] said, "I need that drink." The whole
[1:40:29] army didn't go.
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; Three went to get him that drink. So, he
[1:40:35] moves through here and he's looking for
[1:40:37] a fresh drink, a fresh praise. Maybe he
[1:40:39] needs a drink of dance. I don't know.
[1:40:41] And he's not saying all of you got to
[1:40:43] give it to him, but somebody's going to
[1:40:44] give it to him.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; And he may need he may be looking for
[1:40:47] somebody just to surrender and give him
[1:40:49] this drink right here and tears stream
[1:40:51] down their face. You don't all got to
[1:40:53] WORSHIP THAT WAY, BUT SOMEBODY'S GOING
[1:40:55] TO GIVE HIM THAT DRINK.
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; WE'RE NOT ALL CALLED TO DO IT THE SAME
[1:40:59] WAY. BUT WHAT I'M SAYING IS WE ARE
[1:41:00] CALLED, LET EVERYTHING THAT HAS BREATH
[1:41:03] PRAISE YE THE LORD. SO PRAISE IS NOT AN
[1:41:08] OPTION.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; WE ARE TO PRAISE THE LORD. WE'RE CALLED
[1:41:11] TO IT. SOME ARE GOING TO PRAISE THIS
[1:41:13] WAY. SOME ARE GOING TO PRAISE THAT WAY.
[1:41:15] I JUST SAY MAKE SURE that we give him
[1:41:17] praise that is do his name.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's not a workup. It's
[1:41:23] creating an atmosphere because
[1:41:25] atmospheres produce atmospheres that he
[1:41:28] can move in. Atmospheres where he can
[1:41:30] deal with hearts. But you're going to
[1:41:32] have to be willing to fight for that
[1:41:33] atmosphere because it's easier to sit
[1:41:35] still.
[1:41:39] It's easier to relax.
[1:41:42] Why do you keep saying that, brother
[1:41:43] Aaron? Because Satan fights it. Satan
[1:41:47] hates it. And he wants to kill the
[1:41:49] atmosphere of faith so that he can rob
[1:41:51] victory. And so he pushes in with an
[1:41:54] evil atmosphere, with a lukewarm
[1:41:56] atmosphere where it's easy to come in
[1:41:59] and BECAUSE YOU HAD A HARD DAY, IT'S
[1:42:01] easy to sit there and listen.
[1:42:06] I came to my post of duty.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; I showed up. You did the hard part.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; You did the hard part. I never
[1:42:14] understood when people push through the
[1:42:16] battle. They push through the war. They
[1:42:18] do the hard part. They get up. They get
[1:42:20] that flesh dressed. They they they push
[1:42:22] through the little disagreement with
[1:42:24] family. They get IN THE CAR. THEY go
[1:42:26] back in AND CHANGE BECAUSE THEY SPILLED
[1:42:27] COFFEE ON THEM. AND OH NO, I'M GOING TO
[1:42:30] CHURCH. AND THEY FIGHT THROUGH IT ALL.
[1:42:32] AND THEN THEY GET THERE.
[1:42:38] What What was the point?
[1:42:41] I'm telling you, if I fight that hard to
[1:42:44] get there, when I get there, I'm going
[1:42:45] to make it worth my while. I'm going TO
[1:42:48] GET MY MONEY'S WORTH, so to speak. I'm
[1:42:50] going to enter IN WITH EVERYTHING I GOT.
[1:42:51] SAY, "SATAN, YOU TRIED TO STOP ME. YOU
[1:42:53] TRIED TO ROB ME. YOU TRIED TO HINDER ME.
[1:42:56] BUT I'M HERE. AND I'M HERE TO WORSHIP.
[1:42:58] I'M HERE TO PRAISE. I'M HERE TO ENTER
[1:43:00] IN. I'M HERE TO DRAW CLOSER TO YOU. I'M
[1:43:02] HERE TO HAVE MY SOUL FED BY THE WORD.
[1:43:04] I'M GOING TO RESPOND. I'M GOING TO
[1:43:06] CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE. And maybe it's not
[1:43:08] even FOR YOU, BUT WHAT ABOUT THAT ONE
[1:43:10] NEXT TO YOU THAT NEEDS SALVATION AND
[1:43:12] NEEDS HEALING? I'M GOING TO CREATE AN
[1:43:14] ATMOSPHERE FOR THEM.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO PUT MY SHOULDER TO THE
[1:43:17] WHEEL.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; There may be a Lazarus that needs you to
[1:43:23] roll a stone away.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; You may not be THE DEAD ONE, BUT I SAY,
[1:43:27] "LET'S COME IN. LET'S PUT OUR SHOULDER
[1:43:29] TO THE STONE AND LET'S PUSH AND LET'S
[1:43:31] WORK TOGETHER AND LET'S FIGHT SO THAT
[1:43:33] SALVATION CAN BE IN THE HOUSE OF THE
[1:43:35] LORD. HEALING CAN BE IN THE HOUSE OF THE
[1:43:37] LORD. DELIVERANCE can be in the house of
[1:43:39] the Lord.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; He says Satan's still here. That's the
[1:43:45] reason all these things happen. He is
[1:43:47] still here and all of his evil forces
[1:43:50] are still here. Notice that's why the
[1:43:52] earth is now so filthy. That's why the
[1:43:55] scum and ridiculous things that goes on,
[1:43:58] bloodshed, war, politics, sin, adultery,
[1:44:00] all kind of filthiness goes on is
[1:44:02] because that Satan is the ruler of this
[1:44:04] earth and this atmosphere. You say the
[1:44:07] atmosphere. Yes, sir. Both the heavens
[1:44:10] and earth now is contaminated with
[1:44:13] devils that can accuse us before God.
[1:44:17] Jesus is there to intercede for us. See,
[1:44:19] while the accusers keep pointing a
[1:44:22] finger, they did this. They did this.
[1:44:26] They did this.
[1:44:28] So, it's all contaminated
[1:44:30] with devils accusing us both day and
[1:44:33] night. I want to take a moment and go
[1:44:37] back now before time even began and see
[1:44:40] how we got to this place where where
[1:44:43] there's a constant battle for us to live
[1:44:44] and walk in the right atmosphere
[1:44:48] to where it's a battle to have the
[1:44:49] atmosphere of faith. It's a battle to
[1:44:52] have an atmosphere where we can
[1:44:53] fellowship with God because we can live
[1:44:56] in that atmosphere
[1:44:58] of fellowship even though we're
[1:45:00] surrounded by chaos. We read in Genesis
[1:45:03] 1 that the world was without form. It
[1:45:06] was void. It was dark. There was
[1:45:08] nothing. It was without form. Horrible
[1:45:11] shape. No light. Turning waters. He says
[1:45:14] the world was without form and it was
[1:45:16] void and darkness was upon the earth.
[1:45:17] nothing but a complete chaos. And the
[1:45:21] Bible said in the beginning back there,
[1:45:23] the world was without form and void.
[1:45:25] There was nothing but just darkness of
[1:45:27] chaos. What a horrible shape it must
[1:45:29] have been in. Nothing but way into the
[1:45:31] darkness yonder without light or
[1:45:33] anything in the turning of water. What
[1:45:35] wandering star twisted around around the
[1:45:37] orbits out there somewhere? It must have
[1:45:39] been a terrific mass of something lost
[1:45:43] like it couldn't find its way.
[1:45:47] You look at that and you begin to
[1:45:49] realize that God has the power to take
[1:45:52] twisted, deformed situations
[1:45:55] and transform it into something
[1:45:56] beautiful.
[1:45:58] He is the transformer of situations.
[1:46:01] He's the transformer of atmospheres.
[1:46:04] Brother Brandham described this as a
[1:46:06] mass of chaos. Chaos meaning disorder
[1:46:08] and confusion. It was an awful
[1:46:11] condition. But the Bible tells us in
[1:46:12] Genesis 1:2, "And the spirit of God
[1:46:15] moved." Listen, church, that's the key
[1:46:18] to everything. That's the key to it all.
[1:46:20] When the spirit of God moves, things
[1:46:22] begin to take place. When the spirit of
[1:46:25] God moves, chaos begins to come into
[1:46:27] perfect order. And out of that great
[1:46:29] chaos comes the Garden of Eden. The
[1:46:32] entire picture changed because the
[1:46:34] spirit of God moved. And there was a
[1:46:36] word that was spoken over that chaos. It
[1:46:39] went from a chaotic atmosphere to where
[1:46:42] everything was out of border like a
[1:46:43] terrific mass of something lost, he
[1:46:46] says, to the most sublime, the most
[1:46:48] perfect, the most peaceful atmosphere
[1:46:50] that the world had ever known. I want to
[1:46:53] say something right now. YOUR LIFE MIGHT
[1:46:54] BE IN A CHAOS. YOUR HOME MIGHT BE IN A
[1:46:57] CHAOS. YOUR HEALTH MIGHT BE IN A CHAOS.
[1:46:59] BUT I SAY TONIGHT, JUST LET THE SPIRIT
[1:47:01] OF GOD BEGIN TO MOVE OVER THAT CHAOS.
[1:47:04] LET A WORD BE SPOKE OVER THAT CHAOS. AND
[1:47:06] LET THE SPIRIT BEGIN TO COME AND
[1:47:08] TRANSFORM AND UNTWIST AND CHASE AFTER
[1:47:11] THAT PRODAL AND LET MERCY AND GRACE GET
[1:47:13] ON THEIR TRAIL AND LET YOU JUST WHAT IN
[1:47:15] A MOMENT ALL OF A SUDDEN A CHAOS CAN
[1:47:18] BECOME SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL. SOMETHING
[1:47:20] THAT THE HAND OF GOD has touched.
[1:47:22] Hallelujah.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Oh my life's a mess. My family, my job,
[1:47:26] my health, your chaos is not too hard
[1:47:29] for God.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You just need the one who
[1:47:33] spoke worlds into existence to begin to
[1:47:36] move over your atmosphere.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; He'll do it, church. He'll do it. He'll
[1:47:43] begin to move across that mess, move
[1:47:46] across that situation, move across that
[1:47:49] marriage, move across that job
[1:47:51] situation, across that sickness because
[1:47:54] he's the creator of atmospheres.
[1:47:57] He is the master of your situation.
[1:48:00] Don't let the devil tell you he's in
[1:48:01] control of anything in your life. God is
[1:48:06] the master of your situation.
[1:48:10] The earth in this moment is transformed
[1:48:13] into an Eden.
[1:48:16] And in the atmosphere of Eden, there's
[1:48:18] no fear.
[1:48:19] In that atmosphere, they they don't know
[1:48:21] worry.
[1:48:23] They don't know sickness.
[1:48:25] In that atmosphere, Adam operated as a
[1:48:27] son of God. He could take the word upon
[1:48:30] his lips and speak and it would happen.
[1:48:34] Wind stand still tree move here. He
[1:48:38] could speak as a son of God. How do how
[1:48:39] do you know that? Because that's what
[1:48:40] the second Adam did. We could see how
[1:48:42] how a son of God was supposed to operate
[1:48:44] in those situations. And in that
[1:48:47] atmosphere, he was on speaking terms
[1:48:49] with God. There was fellowship in the
[1:48:51] cool of the evening as God would come
[1:48:53] down and he would walk with his
[1:48:54] children. There was nothing between God
[1:48:57] and man. The atmospheres were clear. But
[1:49:01] there came a time, as you know, that
[1:49:03] that the atmosphere changed.
[1:49:06] Everything changed. Satan had a plan to
[1:49:09] get back into the heavens, to get back
[1:49:11] to a place where he could rule and
[1:49:13] operate from a position of dominion.
[1:49:16] Satan wanted dominion. He wanted
[1:49:18] position.
[1:49:20] And by causing man to fall, and and I
[1:49:22] know I'm going over this quickly, but
[1:49:23] you know how how it came about. He
[1:49:26] stepped into that position that man had
[1:49:28] forfeited
[1:49:31] and that man could no longer operate
[1:49:33] from. Now fear enters in, death enters
[1:49:35] in and fellowship with God is lost. The
[1:49:39] earth is given over to the devil. The
[1:49:40] atmospheres are given over to him and
[1:49:43] brother tells us that the heavens were
[1:49:44] shut off.
[1:49:46] The heavens became sealed off. Think of
[1:49:48] that. One day you have fellowship with
[1:49:51] God. You're walking in the cool of the
[1:49:53] evening. You can speak to him and the
[1:49:55] next day nothing.
[1:49:58] Never knowing fear, never knowing
[1:49:59] anxiety, never knowing anything. Then
[1:50:01] all of a sudden, nothing but fear.
[1:50:04] Nothing but anxiety. Nothing.
[1:50:09] And now a great mist and a fog of demon
[1:50:12] power stands between heavens and earth.
[1:50:14] Where once God would come down, now it's
[1:50:17] sealed off. Power is sealed off.
[1:50:19] Fellowship is cut off. And Satan becomes
[1:50:21] the ruler of the earth and the prince of
[1:50:24] the power of the air. And now man man
[1:50:26] begins to wander alone without
[1:50:28] fellowship without contact. Brother says
[1:50:31] man just became a wonderer wandering on
[1:50:33] his own trying to figure things out on
[1:50:35] his own. And and soon in this new
[1:50:37] atmosphere and without fellowship and
[1:50:39] and and without hope, man begins to slip
[1:50:42] back into the chaos once again. The
[1:50:45] chaos that God had ended, now man begins
[1:50:48] to slide back into it. and the
[1:50:50] generations following Adam lost touch
[1:50:52] with Eden. Eden became a story that
[1:50:55] grandpa told. Let me say something
[1:50:57] tonight. Don't let the moving of the
[1:51:00] spirit and the new birth and the power
[1:51:03] of God become a story that grandpa
[1:51:05] tells.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; It only takes one generation.
[1:51:11] Second generation is cooler. Third
[1:51:13] generation, it's a story. I'm going to
[1:51:15] tell you something. I don't know if I
[1:51:16] told y'all this last time I was here.
[1:51:17] You know, brother John, we were speaking
[1:51:19] about Life Tabernacle in Shripport, and
[1:51:21] I was on a Facebook page of theirs, and
[1:51:23] I couldn't see everything
[1:51:25] because I wasn't a member, but I could
[1:51:27] see certain pictures, and there would be
[1:51:28] pictures of Brother Brandham every now
[1:51:29] and then standing with Brother Jack
[1:51:31] Moore. And people from that congregation
[1:51:34] would say on there, I know who Brother
[1:51:36] Jack is, but who's the the other man
[1:51:37] standing with him? Who is that? And then
[1:51:41] people would respond, that was just some
[1:51:42] preacher that used to be friends with
[1:51:44] Brother Jack.
[1:51:46] And I thought, my my God,
[1:51:50] look at the messages and the miraculous
[1:51:52] and the mighty things that were
[1:51:53] performed in Life Tabernacle in
[1:51:54] Shreport, Louisiana. And here we are a
[1:51:57] few years down the road and that was
[1:51:58] just some preacher. We don't really
[1:51:59] remember some guy that used to be
[1:52:01] friends with brother Jack.
[1:52:04] I think his name was Brandham. I I think
[1:52:08] invisible union
[1:52:11] on the wings of a snow white dove.
[1:52:12] Rapture things they heard, miracles they
[1:52:15] saw. discernment they saw and now just a
[1:52:18] few generations I don't even know what
[1:52:20] you're talking about.
[1:52:22] Don't let it ever get to the place where
[1:52:24] our generations don't know what we're
[1:52:26] talking about because they haven't
[1:52:27] experienced it for themselves
[1:52:30] and Eden just becomes a story that
[1:52:33] grandpa said and it was something from a
[1:52:35] past age and there was no contact and no
[1:52:37] fellowship. The atmosphere becomes
[1:52:39] clogged with demons with fear and doubt
[1:52:41] and they lose touch. Prophet says, "Man
[1:52:44] in the fall lost his consciousness of
[1:52:46] what father put him here on earth to
[1:52:48] do." In other words, all the plumbing as
[1:52:50] it was in our brain and the outlets of
[1:52:52] faith has been clogged up with business
[1:52:54] affairs, with home life, with domestic
[1:52:56] things, it all becomes so clogged up
[1:52:58] with that until God can't operate
[1:53:00] through those channels that he made man
[1:53:03] for. You have to stay in contact with
[1:53:07] God. You have to stay in fellowship with
[1:53:10] God. I I I don't care how many times in
[1:53:12] the past you've been in contact. I don't
[1:53:14] care how many times you've had
[1:53:15] experiences with God. Those are
[1:53:17] wonderful things. I don't care how many
[1:53:19] times you had fellowship with him in the
[1:53:21] past. Don't let long periods of time go
[1:53:24] between contacts.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Don't your let your testimony be, I
[1:53:28] remember 10 years ago when God moved in
[1:53:30] my life.
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; A Christian should never have to point
[1:53:34] backwards to a time he was in a better
[1:53:36] condition or a better place or in better
[1:53:38] fellowship with God. Amen.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; Because that's exactly what Satan did to
[1:53:44] put man into the chaos originally is he
[1:53:46] took away his fellowship with God.
[1:53:50] And now Jesus,
[1:53:52] listen church, we have to understand
[1:53:54] something in your situation. No matter
[1:53:55] how awful it is tonight, please
[1:53:57] understand that we serve a determined
[1:53:58] God. We serve a God who's not going to
[1:54:00] give up on you. He's not going to give
[1:54:02] up on your situation. He's not giving up
[1:54:04] on your family. So don't you give up.
[1:54:08] And Jesus was determined that I'm going
[1:54:10] to have fellowship.
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; I will have fellowship. And Jesus comes
[1:54:14] and makes a way so that now you and I
[1:54:17] can have fellowship again. We can have
[1:54:19] contact again. And I'm trying to
[1:54:21] encourage you tonight not to let the
[1:54:23] atmosphere of Leoa drown that out and
[1:54:26] push that out.
[1:54:28] It's something you got to be willing to
[1:54:30] fight for tonight. Amen. The generations
[1:54:32] after Adam forgot their purpose because
[1:54:35] their outlets became clogged. Look, the
[1:54:38] same thing happened a after the second
[1:54:40] Adam. You had the day of Pentecost. You
[1:54:42] had the church in the book of Acts and
[1:54:44] all these things out of chaos. A a
[1:54:46] church is born there on the day of
[1:54:48] Pentecost. And and what happened?
[1:54:52] What happened down through the ages?
[1:54:53] They forgot what it was all about. And
[1:54:55] it became about rituals and it became
[1:54:57] about traditions. And they forgot. And
[1:55:00] God sent a message in this day to
[1:55:01] restore order, to call a bride out of
[1:55:04] the chaos. And he sent light into the
[1:55:06] darkness and into the confusion. And he
[1:55:08] brought out of that something beautiful.
[1:55:09] Amen. And now we can't allow amnesia to
[1:55:12] to come in and cut us off from what we
[1:55:14] were put here to do. Brother Brown said,
[1:55:16] "Man forgot what we were put here on
[1:55:19] earth to do." I said, "We can't let
[1:55:21] tradition hinder. We can't let the ideas
[1:55:23] of man hinder." What are we here to do?
[1:55:25] You are here to manifest JESUS CHRIST TO
[1:55:28] A DYING WORLD, to let HIS LIFE LIVE OUT
[1:55:32] OF YOU. YES. John 14:12, uh, the works
[1:55:35] that I do shall you do also. That means
[1:55:37] the miraculous. That means the healings.
[1:55:38] That means all of that, the
[1:55:39] deliverances, but it also MEANS THE LOVE
[1:55:41] OF CHRIST.
[1:55:43] &gt;&gt; IT MEANS SHOWING COMPASSION. IT MEANS AN
[1:55:46] OVERCOMING LIFE. I'M NOT WORRIED ABOUT
[1:55:48] THE miracles and the tongues and the
[1:55:49] gifts. If you do that here and live like
[1:55:51] the devil out there,
[1:55:53] what was his work? He overcame the
[1:55:56] devil.
[1:55:59] &gt;&gt; We can't go long periods of time without
[1:56:01] him moving and manifesting himself
[1:56:03] because it doesn't take long
[1:56:06] sitting in dead atmospheres to think
[1:56:09] those are normal atmospheres.
[1:56:13] This body, and I don't mean this, I mean
[1:56:15] the body of Christ was made for the
[1:56:17] supernatural. This body was made for the
[1:56:20] heavenlies. It was built for the
[1:56:22] manifestations of the spirit. This body
[1:56:24] can't stand the atmospheres of the
[1:56:26] chicken yard. Never forget what this
[1:56:29] body was designed to do. This body is to
[1:56:32] manifest Jesus through all of its
[1:56:35] outlets. Amen.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would talk about the
[1:56:38] outlets. He says ministries an outlet
[1:56:40] and supernatural workings are an outlet.
[1:56:42] Gifts and prophecies are outlets.
[1:56:43] Healings are outlets. He says if God
[1:56:46] designed man's body, he certainly
[1:56:48] designed the body of his son, the
[1:56:50] church. And he has designed us to come
[1:56:52] together in heavenly places in Christ
[1:56:54] Jesus and have these supernatural
[1:56:56] workings of God outlets through gifts of
[1:56:59] the spirit such as prophecy and wisdom
[1:57:01] and knowledge, gifts of healing, ALL
[1:57:03] THESE OTHER DIFFERENT GIFTS. IT'S
[1:57:04] outlets that God lets out his power and
[1:57:08] lets out his revelation to the people.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; We got to fight for these things. We got
[1:57:15] to be willing to stand for these things
[1:57:17] because if Satan can clog it up, if he
[1:57:21] can clog the outlets, he knows he can
[1:57:23] stop the power. Now, brother Aaron, what
[1:57:25] what do you mean fight for these things?
[1:57:27] I don't mean force them.
[1:57:31] I don't mean seek after them. Christians
[1:57:33] don't seek after these things. These
[1:57:35] things follow after Christians.
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; But what I mean by fight for them is
[1:57:40] actively stand against the spirit that
[1:57:42] would rob them.
[1:57:44] That's that's what I mean.
[1:57:46] &gt;&gt; Just actively stand against the spirit
[1:57:48] that would come and rob them. We don't
[1:57:50] want to work up fake anything, but I'm
[1:57:52] not going to let the spirit of the
[1:57:54] antichrist come in and rob the those
[1:57:56] things from operating in our church.
[1:57:58] Amen. That's why we teach it and preach
[1:58:00] it over and over and over again to let
[1:58:02] the life flow, to let the supernatural
[1:58:04] flow, to let freedom ring because we're
[1:58:06] trying to create an atmosphere of life
[1:58:08] where God can flow through all these
[1:58:10] outlets where God can manifest himself
[1:58:12] through all his body that he designed.
[1:58:15] We didn't design it. God designed it so
[1:58:18] he knows how he wants it to operate. And
[1:58:20] we want to live in an atmosphere of
[1:58:22] faith where God can speak how he
[1:58:24] pleases, operate how he pleases, and
[1:58:26] manifest himself how? Through a people.
[1:58:30] We want God to manifest himself in my if
[1:58:32] if I have anything, Lord, do you want to
[1:58:35] be this? Do you want to be that? No, I
[1:58:36] just want to manifest you. H how how you
[1:58:39] choose? How how you want me to operate,
[1:58:41] Lord? What what part of my life do you
[1:58:43] want to use? I'm going to give you that
[1:58:45] because my purpose is to manifest Jesus
[1:58:48] Christ. I I I want an atmosphere of
[1:58:50] faith around me, Lord. Atmosphere of
[1:58:52] believing because I know atmospheres
[1:58:54] produce Amen.
[1:58:56] Man fell back into chaos again. And and
[1:58:59] after the fall, Satan ruled the
[1:59:00] atmosphere.
[1:59:02] Darkness and gloom hung over the earth.
[1:59:05] Fellowship was broken. The heavens was
[1:59:06] shut off from mankind. But I got good
[1:59:09] news. I'm not going to leave it gloomy.
[1:59:10] And I'm not going to leave it full of
[1:59:12] demons. All of that was about to change.
[1:59:15] All of that was about to take a turn
[1:59:16] because the very one who had spoken who
[1:59:19] who had spoken to the darkness and had
[1:59:21] taken the darkness and turmoil and chaos
[1:59:23] in the beginning and made it in Eden,
[1:59:26] that very same one was determined once
[1:59:28] again to have fellowship with man. He
[1:59:30] was determined THAT CHAOS WOULD NOT
[1:59:32] RAIN. HE WAS DETERMINED TO MAKE A WAY.
[1:59:35] HALLELUJAH. Think about it. It was chaos
[1:59:37] and the spirit of God moved. And then
[1:59:39] once again it was chaos and the spirit
[1:59:41] of God moved and it stepped into flesh
[1:59:44] and it stepped onto the scene where the
[1:59:46] chaos was. And that flesh came down in
[1:59:48] the most chaotic time and he came down
[1:59:50] and what did HE DO? HE SHOWED how a man
[1:59:53] can create an atmosphere around himself
[1:59:55] of peace in the midst of a storm. How a
[1:59:58] man CAN WALK ABOVE SIN. HOW A HOLY GHOST
[2:00:00] MAN can speak to the storms. Speak to
[2:00:03] the devils. CAN LIVE AN OVERCOMING LIFE
[2:00:05] IN THE MIDST OF absolute chaos.
[2:00:08] Hallelujah. He came and showed how Satan
[2:00:11] may be the prince of the power of the
[2:00:12] air and he may be able to stir things up
[2:00:15] and whip things up, but he still has to
[2:00:17] be subject to the word.
[2:00:19] &gt;&gt; Listen to me. HE STILL HAS TO BE SUBJECT
[2:00:21] to the word. So the devil came and he
[2:00:23] stirred up storms. And brother Brandham
[2:00:25] said there was a demon on every wave
[2:00:27] swearing that they were going to sink
[2:00:29] that little ship. OH, BUT GOD IN flesh
[2:00:31] put his foot on THE BROW OF THE BOAT AND
[2:00:33] HE SAID, "PEACE be still." AND IT DIDN'T
[2:00:36] MATTER THAT HE WAS THE PRINCE OF THE
[2:00:37] POWER OF THE AIR. HE HAD TO BOW TO THE
[2:00:40] KING OF THE UNIVERSE. AND NOW THAT SAME
[2:00:42] KING LIVES ON THE INSIDE OF MEN AND
[2:00:45] WOMEN AND HE'S STILL SUBJECT TO THE
[2:00:47] WORD. SO WHEN HE STIRS UP YOUR HOME, HE
[2:00:49] STIRS UP YOUR LIFE AND HE STIRS UP THE
[2:00:51] PEACE IN YOUR FAMILY. YOU STAND ON THE
[2:00:53] BROW OF THE BOAT AND YOU SPEAK PEACE be
[2:00:56] still. AND HE'S STILL SUBJECT TO THE
[2:00:59] WORD TONIGHT. HALLELUJAH. WHY? CUZ THE
[2:01:02] SAME ONE THAT SPOKE THERE SPEAKS OUT OF
[2:01:04] THESE lips tonight.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:01:12] He came into this atmosphere
[2:01:17] that had been cut off from the heavens
[2:01:20] to do battle against the enemy, to do
[2:01:23] battle against spiritual wickedness in
[2:01:24] high places.
[2:01:26] Yes. To conquer sin.
[2:01:29] Yes. to conquer death, hell, and the
[2:01:31] grave. But there's a piece we often
[2:01:33] overlook.
[2:01:35] Brother Brown says, "We don't talk
[2:01:36] enough about the ascension."
[2:01:39] He came to conquer atmospheres
[2:01:42] and all the evil that was there so that
[2:01:45] you once again could return to heavenly
[2:01:48] places and have access to the heavens
[2:01:51] once again.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; SO THAT YOUR PRAYERS COULD go up to God
[2:01:55] and that his answers could come back
[2:01:57] down to you. Oh, THINK ABOUT IT. THAT WE
[2:01:59] DON'T RECOGNIZE THOSE THINGS HAVE BEEN
[2:02:01] SHUT OFF. HEAVENS HAD been sealed off
[2:02:04] AND THEY WERE STILL SEALED OFF UNTIL THE
[2:02:06] MOMENT OF RESURRECTION. He said there's
[2:02:08] so little spoke of his ascension. It's
[2:02:10] one of the greatest days when he
[2:02:11] ascended up cuz all over the earth since
[2:02:14] the day in the garden of Eden that SIN
[2:02:15] WAS COMMITTED. ALL HEAVENS was shut off
[2:02:17] from mankind. When he was on the earth,
[2:02:19] he conquered passions, pride, he
[2:02:21] conquered sickness, he conquered devils.
[2:02:23] When he died, he conquered death. When
[2:02:25] he arose, he conquered hell. when he
[2:02:27] went in and and conquered everything
[2:02:29] that was against mankind, it went into
[2:02:31] the wine press of God, crushed it down,
[2:02:33] conquered death, hell, grave, sickness,
[2:02:35] formality. OH, THAT'S SOMETHING TO SHOUT
[2:02:37] ABOUT RIGHT THERE. AND EVERYTHING ELSE,
[2:02:39] AND OVERCOME IT ALL, and rose on the
[2:02:42] third day, AND CONQUERED ALL THE
[2:02:44] ATMOSPHERES ABOVE AND CUT THE MIST
[2:02:46] BETWEEN GOD AND MAN, AND CONNECTED
[2:02:49] HEAVEN AND EARTH TOGETHER AGAIN. GLORY,
[2:02:51] OH MY. WOO! I SAY, GLORY, OH MY. HE
[2:02:55] CONNECTED ONCE AGAIN GOD TO MAN WHERE I
[2:02:58] CAN HAVE FELLOWSHIP. I CAN SPEAK THE
[2:03:00] WORD. I CAN PRAY AND I KNOW HE HEARS. HE
[2:03:03] can answer and I can receive. HE TORE
[2:03:06] THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERES.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; OH, and as they went out, he conquered
[2:03:10] the grave. And then there was a great
[2:03:12] mist hanging over the earth yet. So he
[2:03:14] had to conquer the mist of sin. The mist
[2:03:17] of stent to the sins of the people with
[2:03:19] his own blood. His vesture dipped in
[2:03:21] blood. He conquered the atmospheres
[2:03:23] above. Blessed be his holy name. He cut
[2:03:25] the fogs of hell from place to place
[2:03:27] till he cut a hole through the sky where
[2:03:30] Adam's lost children could pray THROUGH
[2:03:31] TO VICTORY. OH HALLELUJAH. HE CUT
[2:03:34] THROUGH SO YOU CAN PRAY THROUGH TONIGHT.
[2:03:37] He conquered the atmospheres. He
[2:03:38] conquered sin. He conquered death. He
[2:03:41] conquered hell. And he rose
[2:03:44] triumphantly. THAT'S YOUR GOD. THAT'S
[2:03:47] YOUR MIGHTY CONQUEROR. AND HE CONQUERED
[2:03:49] atmospheres for you.
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:03:53] &gt;&gt; Satan sits in heavenly places tonight
[2:03:56] and he accuses you and he accuses you
[2:03:58] and he points out this fault and this
[2:04:00] failure and he says you have no right to
[2:04:02] be here. You have no right to speak the
[2:04:04] word. You have no right to operate in
[2:04:06] heavenly places. Look at your life. I DO
[2:04:08] HAVE A RIGHT. HE RESTORED MY POSITION OF
[2:04:11] AUTHORITY. HE CONQUERED ATMOSPHERE. SO
[2:04:14] NOW EVEN THOUGH Satan battles and he
[2:04:16] wars and he says I can't I can step into
[2:04:18] my position in heavenly PLACES NOW AND I
[2:04:22] CAN SPEAK the word and say PEACE BE
[2:04:24] STILL. SATAN TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF. SATAN
[2:04:26] BACK OFF MY PROMISES. I'M OPERATING IN A
[2:04:29] PLACE CREATED BY MY LORD AND SAVIOR
[2:04:32] BECAUSE HE CONQUERED ATMOSPHERES.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; OH, think about it. All hope was lost.
[2:04:43] Chaos reigned.
[2:04:45] Man couldn't see into glory. Glories of
[2:04:48] God was cut off. Powers was shut off.
[2:04:50] Fellowship was taken. But our con our
[2:04:53] conqueror, he tore through that cloud of
[2:04:56] demons and granted access back into
[2:04:58] heaven. He granted access back to God.
[2:05:02] He ripped the veil of atmospheres and he
[2:05:04] paved the way not only for us to be able
[2:05:06] to sit together in heavenly places. Now,
[2:05:09] oh, think about it.
[2:05:11] Not just for now, but he knew in a
[2:05:14] little while I got a bride coming. I got
[2:05:17] to pave the way. She's got to have
[2:05:19] access to get up into heaven. And he
[2:05:21] came and HE PAVED THE HIGHWAY INTO
[2:05:23] GLORY. AND HE MARKED IT WELL WITH HIS
[2:05:25] own blood. It's an easy path to follow.
[2:05:28] And tonight, WE'RE WALKING UP THE KING'S
[2:05:29] HIGHWAY ON THAT RAPTURE MORNING WHEN THE
[2:05:32] DEAD IN CHRIST ARISE. HOW AM I GOING TO
[2:05:34] GET THERE? HOW AM I GOING TO PUSH
[2:05:35] THROUGH? OH, HE'S ALREADY TORE THROUGH
[2:05:37] THE ATMOSPHERES. HE'S ALREADY CREATED A
[2:05:40] HIGHWAY. I JUST GOT TO BE willing to
[2:05:42] walk up it tonight. HALLELUJAH. HE MADE
[2:05:46] A WAY OF ascension for us. Oh, glory.
[2:05:50] She's going to rise to meet him in the
[2:05:52] air.
[2:05:54] He says the Bible said he ascended on
[2:05:56] high, gave gifts unto men. There was an
[2:06:00] atmosphere hung over the earth of
[2:06:01] darkness, gloom, death, and weary.
[2:06:05] prayers couldn't come up because the
[2:06:08] atonement wasn't made. But he broke
[2:06:11] through that veil. He opened up the way.
[2:06:15] You can see that I'm I'm going to skip
[2:06:17] ahead a little bit and show you. We see
[2:06:19] this right here in Daniel that he said
[2:06:21] unto me, "Fear not, Daniel. From the
[2:06:22] first day that thou just set thine heart
[2:06:25] to understand and chasen thyself before
[2:06:26] thy God, thy words were heard and I've
[2:06:28] come to thy words, but the prince of the
[2:06:30] kingdom of Persia withtood me one in 20
[2:06:33] days." That atmosphere of demons
[2:06:35] literally hindered the answers of God
[2:06:38] from coming in a more timely manner. He
[2:06:40] says, "I was trying to come from the
[2:06:42] moment you prayed." He said, "But the
[2:06:44] prince of Once again, this shows you
[2:06:46] who's over the nations of the earth."
[2:06:48] He's speaking of a demon power when he
[2:06:50] says, "The prince of the power of Persia
[2:06:51] hindered me. It clogged away.
[2:06:55] It clogged away." We see that right
[2:06:57] there. Let me back this up.
[2:07:05] I love this so much.
[2:07:08] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:07:12] He knew one of these days he had a bride
[2:07:14] coming.
[2:07:18] All the saints that's in heaven above,
[2:07:20] he is the prince of the power of the
[2:07:22] air.
[2:07:24] I love this. The bride is going to meet
[2:07:26] him where?
[2:07:28] In the air.
[2:07:31] says the Bible, the atmosphere may be
[2:07:34] full of demons and darkness, but there's
[2:07:36] been a highway made into glory.
[2:07:39] And I love the fact that when we meet
[2:07:41] him, we're going to gather with our
[2:07:42] conqueror right in the place. Think
[2:07:46] about this. Right in the place where
[2:07:48] Satan had lain clay laid claim to. Right
[2:07:51] where he had blocked all of man. Where
[2:07:53] he had wared with these angels. Where he
[2:07:55] had blocked our blessings. You say
[2:07:57] blocked our blessings. Yeah. He said,
[2:07:59] "All the sin that's in the heavens
[2:08:00] above, he's the prince of the power
[2:08:02] there." He keeps off, wars off the
[2:08:04] blessings from God.
[2:08:07] And there comes thunderbolts of
[2:08:08] lightning and strikes the earth. And
[2:08:10] everything from the heavens, sheets of
[2:08:11] slicing rain, typhoon, storms,
[2:08:13] everything comes from above, which is
[2:08:15] Satan, the prince of the power of the
[2:08:18] air. He has laid claim to this. It's
[2:08:20] his. It It's what he's most proud of.
[2:08:22] It's where he's wared you from. It's
[2:08:23] where he's kept you battling to get to
[2:08:26] heaven. Once again, I thought you said
[2:08:27] the heavens were open. than they are.
[2:08:28] But he's still going to battle you. But
[2:08:30] now you have a right. Now you have a
[2:08:33] right to be there. You have a right to
[2:08:35] approach the throne. You have a right to
[2:08:36] cast Satan down. But he stands there
[2:08:38] with a place of pride. I took this from
[2:08:40] man. I I took this. I I caused the fall.
[2:08:43] And yet on that day on rapture morning
[2:08:47] on rapture morning right there where he
[2:08:50] was supposed to have power and
[2:08:51] authority. For the Lord himself shall
[2:08:53] descend from heaven with a shout, with
[2:08:54] the voice of the archangel, with the
[2:08:56] trump of God. and the dead in Christ
[2:08:57] shall rise first. Then we which are
[2:08:59] alive and remain shall be caught up
[2:09:00] together with them in the clouds to meet
[2:09:02] the Lord in thee. He ain't the prince of
[2:09:05] the power of the air no more.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; He's been stripped of it. There's been a
[2:09:09] people who has stepped back into their
[2:09:11] place of authority and God recognizes
[2:09:13] their their position. He says, "I'll
[2:09:15] meet you there. I'll meet you there."
[2:09:17] Amen. I'm so glad he made a way. I'm so
[2:09:19] glad he made a way. Yeah, we have to
[2:09:21] fight, but it's available to you. He can
[2:09:24] still stir it up. He can fight it. He
[2:09:25] can hinder, but it's yours for the taken
[2:09:28] tonight. It's yours for the taken. Jesus
[2:09:31] came and tore through the veil of sin,
[2:09:33] tore through the veil of sickness. He
[2:09:35] broke through that veil of depression.
[2:09:37] He broke every veil. But it's up to you
[2:09:38] tonight to stand and enforce your
[2:09:40] rights.
[2:09:42] And Satan is well aware of the of the
[2:09:44] power of the right and the wrong
[2:09:46] atmosphere. And he's aware that
[2:09:48] atmospheres produce. And he still sits
[2:09:50] there trying to rob you of your blessing
[2:09:52] by disturbing your atmosphere.
[2:09:56] All the sin that's in heaven above. I
[2:09:58] already read that one. He tries to
[2:10:01] disturb your atmosphere. I'mma move on.
[2:10:04] It's a war, church,
[2:10:06] to continue home from last night. It's a
[2:10:08] war, but you're called to conquer. And
[2:10:10] we're bombarded on every side by the
[2:10:13] atmosphere of the last day. And I've
[2:10:15] already said it produces so much doubt
[2:10:17] and negativity and nervousness. But the
[2:10:19] main thing it produces that you have to
[2:10:21] worry about is lukewarmness.
[2:10:25] It produces lukewarmness.
[2:10:28] It's where you feel comfortable and it's
[2:10:30] the atmosphere of the end time. I want
[2:10:32] you to know what the second Adam show
[2:10:34] us. We can walk above that lukewarmness.
[2:10:36] We can walk above the traditions of man.
[2:10:38] We can walk in heavenly places and live
[2:10:40] in an atmosphere of the Holy Spirit
[2:10:42] where our lives are not dictated by the
[2:10:44] atmosphere of Leodysia. And because he
[2:10:47] he conquered these atmospheres, you're
[2:10:49] no longer subject to the atmosphere
[2:10:52] caused by the devil. Because now you
[2:10:54] have rights and you have the ability to
[2:10:55] create. Now this is what I want you to
[2:10:57] recognize.
[2:10:59] The same one who created atmospheres
[2:11:03] now lives in you.
[2:11:05] And so now you have the ability to
[2:11:08] create atmospheres.
[2:11:10] You yourself are a creator. Amen. You
[2:11:14] have the the the ability to create the
[2:11:16] atmosphere that you choose to live in.
[2:11:19] the atmosphere that you choose to create
[2:11:22] because the one who spoke Eden off of
[2:11:24] his lips and the one who cast devils out
[2:11:26] and the one who tore through devils into
[2:11:28] the atmospheres now lives on the inside
[2:11:30] of you. Now you have the right. Now you
[2:11:33] can create an atmosphere of faith. Now
[2:11:35] you can create an atmosphere of the Holy
[2:11:37] Ghost. Now you can stay on fire for God
[2:11:40] when everything around you is lukewarm.
[2:11:43] I say again, this is worth fighting for.
[2:11:47] It's worth waring for the right
[2:11:48] atmosphere when brother Aaron every
[2:11:50] service
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; every day, every devotion with your
[2:11:54] family every moment. Conquer the
[2:11:56] atmosphere around you.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; It takes atmosphere to do things. It's
[2:12:02] the atmosphere that does it. Brother
[2:12:04] Brown says, "Well, what's the word?
[2:12:07] What's the what the word of God is? If
[2:12:09] you take any promise of God and place it
[2:12:11] in the right atmosphere, it'll produce
[2:12:12] exactly what is in it. What is in its
[2:12:16] life, excuse me. So, you're going to get
[2:12:18] what you get based off the atmosphere
[2:12:20] you create. You say, "Well, brother, I I
[2:12:22] disagree. It's the word that does these
[2:12:24] things.
[2:12:26] It's it's the word we got to have."
[2:12:28] Absolutely true. Absolutely true. But
[2:12:32] you got to place the word in the right
[2:12:33] atmosphere
[2:12:35] in order for it to produce what's
[2:12:36] promised. I want to drive this home.
[2:12:38] What difference does that make? I don't
[2:12:40] care how many nails you got, how many
[2:12:41] pieces of cross you got. We need to
[2:12:43] produce this word again. Amen. How do we
[2:12:46] do that? Put put it not on a cross, on a
[2:12:48] nail, but on a living atmosphere of the
[2:12:50] Holy Spirit that brings forth the
[2:12:52] results. God's word under the right
[2:12:54] atmosphere will produce exactly what it
[2:12:56] says it'll do. It's got to be in the
[2:12:58] right atmosphere, though. You can't lay
[2:13:00] it over in the seminary or some Bible
[2:13:02] school that don't believe in signs and
[2:13:04] wonders. It'll never happen. it'll never
[2:13:06] break forth and bring life there. The
[2:13:08] atmosphere is wrong, but you got to put
[2:13:10] it in the right atmosphere.
[2:13:13] He says they was blessing God for the
[2:13:15] Holy Ghost, which had never come yet,
[2:13:17] but they believed that it was because
[2:13:19] God was going to keep his promise. And
[2:13:21] when they kept blessing God until the
[2:13:22] atmosphere got just right, then there
[2:13:25] came a sound from heaven like a rushing
[2:13:27] mighty wind filled all the house where
[2:13:29] they were setting, see the atmosphere
[2:13:31] got right. Oh, couldn't we get an
[2:13:33] atmosphere here that every
[2:13:35] every blind, every sick person,
[2:13:37] everything all with one accord believing
[2:13:39] until the sick I seen it last week in
[2:13:41] Wood River where there wasn't a person
[2:13:43] left. They just piled up the crutches
[2:13:44] and wheelchairs and CS. I was standing
[2:13:46] at the platform preaching like this and
[2:13:48] they just begin to raise up, throw them
[2:13:50] IN THE CORNERS. THE atmosphere
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; got right.
[2:13:56] What would happen? I'mma slow down just
[2:13:59] for a moment.
[2:14:01] I won't be much longer.
[2:14:04] What would happen if we would come
[2:14:06] together every service determined to get
[2:14:08] the atmosphere right?
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; I mean, with a determination,
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; a real determination,
[2:14:15] determined to do our part, recognizing
[2:14:18] the devil's going to fight it today.
[2:14:20] He's going to fight it tonight. He's
[2:14:22] going to fight it Wednesday. He's going
[2:14:23] to fight it every time we come together.
[2:14:26] He's going to try to stir things up. But
[2:14:28] recognize I'm a creator of atmospheres
[2:14:31] and I have a right tonight to sit in
[2:14:33] heavenly places in this service. And
[2:14:35] right now the devil's trying to hinder
[2:14:36] me. He's trying to take my mind. He's
[2:14:38] trying to focus on this. But right now,
[2:14:39] I'm going to begin to take dominion over
[2:14:41] those thoughts. And I'm begin to battle.
[2:14:43] And I'm just going to create an
[2:14:44] atmosphere in this place. I'm going to
[2:14:45] create an atmosphere if nobody else does
[2:14:47] because I have that authority and I have
[2:14:49] that right. It's been placed in me. And
[2:14:50] I'm begin to fight. And I'm going to go
[2:14:52] to spiritual warfare. And I'm determined
[2:14:54] that before I leave, God's going to meet
[2:14:55] my need or he's going to meet somebody.
[2:14:57] He's going to move in my situation
[2:14:58] because I'm fixing to create an
[2:15:00] atmosphere of faith and I'm determined
[2:15:02] that it's going to happen because we are
[2:15:03] the creators and we have a right to do
[2:15:05] the things that are written in the word.
[2:15:06] We have a right for the power of God to
[2:15:08] move in our church. We have a right to
[2:15:09] worship him in spirit and truth. We have
[2:15:11] a right to see our children saved. We
[2:15:13] have a right to the baptism of the Holy
[2:15:14] Ghost. We have a right. HE SAYS, "FORGET
[2:15:16] NOT ALL MY BENEFITS. YOU HAVE A RIGHT to
[2:15:18] those things, but in order for them TO
[2:15:20] SPRING FORTH, WE GOT TO CREATE THE RIGHT
[2:15:22] ATMOSPHERE. And if it's atmospheres
[2:15:24] that's going to bring the supernatural,
[2:15:26] then I'm GOING TO DO ALL THAT is within
[2:15:28] me every single time we COME TOGETHER TO
[2:15:30] MAKE SURE that the atmosphere is right.
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; I can't make this one do and I can't
[2:15:35] worry about that one. I got to get it
[2:15:37] right where I'm at.
[2:15:39] He says, "What we need is a Holy Ghost
[2:15:41] atmosphere." That's right. An atmosphere
[2:15:43] where the power of God's moving one
[2:15:45] accord, one place gathered together
[2:15:47] under that atmosphere of expecting God
[2:15:48] to move down and do signs and wonders.
[2:15:50] Amen. Let's move ourselves up into that
[2:15:52] bracket. Step up in faith. Move out of
[2:15:55] these three dimensions up here into the
[2:15:56] next one. Said, "Lord, I'm just
[2:15:58] believing you're going to pour your
[2:15:59] blessings. I'm expecting it now. All
[2:16:01] things are moving right in. I'm
[2:16:03] expecting to see the exceeding abundant
[2:16:04] now. I'm expecting it. And when you go,
[2:16:07] now listen to this. This doesn't sound
[2:16:10] too awful." You come down and say,
[2:16:12] "Well, I I don't know about it.
[2:16:16] I didn't sound terrible. I didn't say I
[2:16:19] don't believe it.
[2:16:21] I don't want to be here today. It's just
[2:16:23] a qu I don't know about it. And look
[2:16:27] what the prophet said. Well, see, you
[2:16:30] hurt the other person.
[2:16:34] My
[2:16:35] how our doubt can affect an entire
[2:16:38] circle. Well, see, you've hurt the other
[2:16:43] person. You see how important you are?
[2:16:47] Don't take this as a as a as a negative.
[2:16:50] Recognize how important you are to the
[2:16:53] battle.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; I need you.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; There ain't there there's truly, if you
[2:17:00] hadn't realized this by now, there is
[2:17:01] truly no big eyes and no little's.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; You under the sound of my voice are just
[2:17:07] as important to this service as I am.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; You say the preacher preacher makes the
[2:17:13] service. No sir, I preached during co to
[2:17:15] an empty building and I say you're
[2:17:16] wrong.
[2:17:19] Those services were awful. I'm sorry.
[2:17:21] I'm speaking how I felt. I I couldn't
[2:17:23] stand it. That door never amened me
[2:17:25] once.
[2:17:29] It was brutal.
[2:17:31] You're what makes a service.
[2:17:34] Quit quit talking down to yourself. I'm
[2:17:36] just a nobody who comes and SAYS YOU
[2:17:38] YOU'RE WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.
[2:17:41] YOU'RE WHAT the whole plan OF REDEMPTION
[2:17:42] IS ABOUT. WHAT'S THIS WHOLE MESSAGE
[2:17:44] ABOUT? WHAT WHY JESUS COME? WHY THIS?
[2:17:47] WHY YOUR PRE YOU?
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; YOU. YOU ARE EVERYTHING. YOU ARE
[2:17:53] PRECIOUS TO HIM. YOU ARE IMPORTANT. YOU
[2:17:55] ARE THE WHOLE PLAN OF GOD.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; Recognize that you're important in this
[2:18:01] battle. And I say, let's create an
[2:18:03] atmosphere tonight that the devil can't
[2:18:05] stay in. LET'S CREATE AN ATMOSPHERE
[2:18:07] WHERE LUKEWARMNESS is uncomfortable.
[2:18:09] LET'S BE THE CREATOR OF ATMOSPHERES to
[2:18:12] where we come in and lukewarmness and cr
[2:18:14] is crushed. Where worry is crushed,
[2:18:16] where fear is crushed, where sickness is
[2:18:18] crushed, an atmosphere where cancer
[2:18:20] flees from THE BUILDING, WHERE FEAR
[2:18:22] FLEES FROM THE BUILDING, WHERE
[2:18:24] DEPRESSION FLEES FROM THE BUILDING.
[2:18:25] WHATEVER YOUR NEED IS, I SAY LET'S
[2:18:27] create an atmosphere of faith in this
[2:18:29] place where nothing can stay, BUT THE
[2:18:31] BLESSED Holy Spirit and THE BLESSINGS
[2:18:33] CAN POUR OUT AND HEALING CAN FLOW and
[2:18:36] deliverance can flow. HEALING FOR WHAT?
[2:18:38] WHATEVER YOU NEED OF A CLOSER WALK, MIND
[2:18:40] BATTLES, SICKNESS, WHATEVER YOU NEED A
[2:18:43] FAMILY RESTORATION, LET IT FLOW IN THE
[2:18:45] HOUSE OF GOD BECAUSE YOU CREATE AN
[2:18:47] ATMOSPHERE OF BELIEVING. It's a battle
[2:18:50] for atmospheres tonight. Create an
[2:18:53] atmospheres that welcome him in our
[2:18:55] midst and he shows up. And when he shows
[2:18:58] up, things begin to change.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; When he shows up, things begin to
[2:19:03] change. Church, I'm determined to live
[2:19:06] above this earthly atmosphere where
[2:19:09] demons rule because there's been a way
[2:19:11] made into heavenly places. And I may
[2:19:14] have to fight, but I got a right to it.
[2:19:17] I'm going to live above their influence.
[2:19:19] When troubles come in the church, I'm
[2:19:21] going to change the atmosphere. When
[2:19:23] unbelief comes in, I'm going to change
[2:19:24] the atmosphere. When Satan tries to make
[2:19:27] us cold and formal, I'm going to change
[2:19:29] the atmosphere. How many times I may
[2:19:32] maybe not here so I'm just going to
[2:19:34] speak I'll speak for myself but how many
[2:19:37] times have we left a service and thought
[2:19:38] man it was kind of dead in there today.
[2:19:41] You know sometimes it's just sparking
[2:19:43] off popping full of life and sometimes
[2:19:44] it's a little bit more of a struggle.
[2:19:46] Maybe not here in this perfect church
[2:19:48] but in a lot of places that's how it is.
[2:19:51] And you sit there and you're focused on
[2:19:53] man it's kind of dead today. People just
[2:19:55] don't really seem to be entering in
[2:19:56] today. I'm like, and I'll deal with
[2:19:58] myself in those moments instead of that.
[2:20:01] Why not go I'm a creator of atmospheres.
[2:20:04] It It does seem to be a little off
[2:20:06] today. So, you know what? I'm just going
[2:20:07] to change that. I'm just going to enter
[2:20:09] in harder. But the problem is too many
[2:20:11] times we enter in hard because we see
[2:20:13] others entering in hard.
[2:20:15] We worship hard because the atmosphere
[2:20:17] is already right. No, no, no. That's not
[2:20:19] that's not what it's about. You create
[2:20:22] the atmosphere.
[2:20:24] you be the one that makes the atmosphere
[2:20:26] one that others want to enter into
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; because there's never a reason to walk
[2:20:31] out and say it was a little bit dead in
[2:20:33] there because really what you're talking
[2:20:35] about is the atmosphere everybody else
[2:20:36] created. How was it for you?
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; I've heard it all the time. I've said it
[2:20:41] and I'm not being judgmental. It's just
[2:20:42] things I recognize about myself
[2:20:43] sometimes like, "Boy, we had a good
[2:20:45] service today." I'm not worried about
[2:20:48] we. Did you have a good service today?
[2:20:52] Because many times when we say we had a
[2:20:53] good service, we're referencing, man,
[2:20:55] the preacher did good and man, there was
[2:20:57] some shout and every song was perfect.
[2:20:58] We had a good service today. No, no. Was
[2:21:00] your life changed?
[2:21:04] What constitutes a good service? Listen
[2:21:06] guys, if you know me personally, I'm an
[2:21:08] emotional fellow. Like, don't let it
[2:21:10] shock you if at some point I just take a
[2:21:12] lap around this. I'm all about it. But
[2:21:14] that doesn't mean it was a good service.
[2:21:18] What is a good service is did the word
[2:21:21] its intended effect in the lives of men
[2:21:24] and women.
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; That's a good service.
[2:21:28] Now, I'll take all the things that come
[2:21:30] with that because many times when the
[2:21:32] word begins to take effect, you begin to
[2:21:34] see rejoicing and somebody gets loose
[2:21:36] from a chain and they begin to shout and
[2:21:38] those type of things. And many times,
[2:21:40] hey, I've rejoiced and shouted because I
[2:21:42] see a victory take place in another life
[2:21:44] and I know the situation. It just brings
[2:21:45] such joy. Those are the results
[2:21:49] of the word taking effect.
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; But what we're looking for is the word
[2:21:53] to take effect in our lives. Let's
[2:21:55] create an atmosphere of faith where the
[2:21:57] word can come and change can fall off.
[2:21:59] Therefore, we can have a true worship in
[2:22:01] spirit and truth.
[2:22:03] What is worship in spirit and truth?
[2:22:05] Brother, that means we have emotion and
[2:22:07] we have the word. No, it's we have the
[2:22:08] word and because we accept that the
[2:22:10] spirit comes behind it and we're able to
[2:22:13] worship in spirit and truth. Why can you
[2:22:16] shout? Why can you dance? Why do you act
[2:22:18] those ways? Don't you know the seals are
[2:22:20] open? Yeah, that's why I act the way I
[2:22:22] do because I've accepted the word. I've
[2:22:26] accepted those things and it brings an
[2:22:27] effect in my life, you know. But what
[2:22:30] happens I I'll tie this very briefly to
[2:22:33] the natural.
[2:22:35] It may be different here. This may be a
[2:22:37] better example in Louisiana, but a
[2:22:39] little cold front will begin to sweep
[2:22:41] through.
[2:22:42] This out here would be a major cold
[2:22:44] front at home. Like if this was going on
[2:22:46] in Louisiana, this amount of snow
[2:22:48] schools would be closed for a week. Like
[2:22:51] people are like, "Ah, there's we're not
[2:22:52] going to make it. Hopefully I got enough
[2:22:55] firewood." All right, we we don't get
[2:22:58] this kind of weather. Okay, I'm just
[2:22:59] being very real with you. But still, a
[2:23:01] cold front can come through and it
[2:23:04] changes the atmosphere and everything
[2:23:06] begins to freeze up. And if it's a bad
[2:23:08] one, even here, the roads begin to get
[2:23:11] real icy.
[2:23:12] And when things get icy, you know what
[2:23:14] we do? We're afraid to move.
[2:23:16] Things get real icy and and and we get
[2:23:19] real still. We begin to stay put and
[2:23:21] there's no real progress in the world.
[2:23:24] And same things can happen in churches
[2:23:26] sometime. It doesn't mean there's
[2:23:27] anything wrong, but something changes in
[2:23:29] the atmosphere
[2:23:31] and things get cold a little bit. Maybe
[2:23:33] there's a a season where there's a few
[2:23:35] services in a row where man, something
[2:23:38] just seems a little off.
[2:23:41] And in those moments, instead of
[2:23:42] accepting it, here's something I tell
[2:23:44] people.
[2:23:45] We all go through seasons. I don't have
[2:23:47] a problem with seasons. I have a problem
[2:23:50] when we accept it and use it as an
[2:23:51] excuse.
[2:23:53] Oh, I got no victory. It's just a season
[2:23:54] of life I'm in. No, no, no, no. When
[2:23:58] things freeze up and the cold front
[2:23:59] freezes everything up and the roads are
[2:24:01] frozen up and you feel like you're not
[2:24:02] getting anywhere, it's time to let the
[2:24:04] sun start shining again. It's time to
[2:24:06] just step back and say, "Lord, let the
[2:24:08] sun begin to shine in here again.
[2:24:09] Whatever we're doing to hinder whatever
[2:24:11] is going on, Lord, I'm not going to
[2:24:13] accept this iciness. I'm not going to
[2:24:15] accept this lukewarmness. It may be cold
[2:24:17] all around me and the pew in front of me
[2:24:19] and the pew behind me. There may be
[2:24:20] problems at home, but I'm fixing to
[2:24:22] create a new atmosphere. I'm fixing to
[2:24:24] press into the Holy Ghost. I'm fing to
[2:24:26] press in to the sen. I'm fixing to press
[2:24:28] in and begin to let the rays of that
[2:24:30] life begin to pour over me and pour over
[2:24:32] my family. And I say, Lord, if things
[2:24:35] hadn't been on fire like they need to be
[2:24:36] in my family, let it start with me.
[2:24:38] Lord, I take responsibility. I say, "Let
[2:24:40] me be the revival." What they say at the
[2:24:42] Welsh Revival when the when the
[2:24:43] Americans went over there and they were
[2:24:45] looking for the Welsh Revival and they
[2:24:47] they came up to the little the officer
[2:24:49] swinging his baton walking down the
[2:24:50] street and they said, "Sir, we're
[2:24:51] looking for the Welsh revival." And he
[2:24:53] said, "I am the Welsh revival." I say
[2:24:55] it's time we recognize where are we
[2:24:57] standing at today? We are in the bride's
[2:24:59] revival. I don't got to work it up. I
[2:25:01] don't got to call it down. That's what
[2:25:02] this message is. It revived a bride. It
[2:25:05] called a bride out of denominations. We
[2:25:07] are in the bride's revival and that's
[2:25:09] time that we recognize who are you? I am
[2:25:11] the revival. I am the revival for my
[2:25:14] family. I'll be the revival for the
[2:25:15] church. I'm going to stay on fire
[2:25:17] because I am the creator of atmospheres.
[2:25:20] Well, I I'm waiting for the move to
[2:25:22] start. The move is on for the bride.
[2:25:24] That's dust, saith the Lord. That's what
[2:25:27] the prophet of God says. SO, WE'RE NOT
[2:25:28] WAITING. IT'S HAPPENING. THERE'S A
[2:25:30] REVIVAL GOING. I SAY GET ON BOARD. DENY
[2:25:33] THIS ATMOSPHERE OF LUKEWARMNESS. DENY
[2:25:35] THE ATMOSPHERE OF DOUBT. DENY THE
[2:25:37] ATMOSPHERE of fear and say, "I AM A
[2:25:40] CREATOR OF ATMOSPHERES. I've been
[2:25:42] restored TO MY POSITION IN HEAVENLY
[2:25:44] PLACES." And I rebuke the spirit of
[2:25:46] lukewarmness. I rebuke the spirit of
[2:25:48] doubt coming in my home, into my mind.
[2:25:50] I'M TAKING THOSE THOUGHTS CAPTIVE. I AM
[2:25:52] the creator of atmospheres and I will
[2:25:55] live in an atmosphere of faith because
[2:25:57] that's what I've been called to do.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; He says it's the atmosphere that brings
[2:26:04] the miraculous. and wonders and powers
[2:26:06] of God among the people. It's the
[2:26:08] atmosphere
[2:26:10] of the people.
[2:26:13] Let's produce an atmosphere tonight. You
[2:26:16] stand together with me. Let's produce an
[2:26:18] atmosphere tonight
[2:26:21] where all things are possible.
[2:26:23] You
[2:26:25] are the creator of atmospheres.
[2:26:30] And what I believe with all my heart is
[2:26:32] that the bride is going to create such
[2:26:34] an atmosphere on this earth
[2:26:37] that it's going to produce the rapture
[2:26:40] because he's going to look and he's
[2:26:41] going to see what she's done and where
[2:26:43] she's standing in the atmosphere that
[2:26:45] she's operating in. He's going to say,
[2:26:46] "She's ready. It's time." And she's
[2:26:49] going to go through the air on a highway
[2:26:51] that he made when he ascended. And we're
[2:26:53] going to gather together where in the
[2:26:56] atmosphere.
[2:26:58] Prophet of God tells us. And from out of
[2:27:01] this chaos
[2:27:02] of this modern scientific Eden that
[2:27:05] we're living in, of culture and science
[2:27:08] and education, all this modern stuff
[2:27:11] will rise. This robe of flesh will drop
[2:27:15] and rise and seize the everlasting
[2:27:17] prize. Someday we'll go through the air
[2:27:20] and this will all be over. For the word
[2:27:22] of God that's brought us from the modern
[2:27:23] thinking of our mind, transforming our
[2:27:25] mind into the renewing of our hearts
[2:27:27] towards God and our spirit. That same
[2:27:29] spirit that spoke that has transformed
[2:27:31] us this far. And it also will take us
[2:27:33] into his presence into glory with a
[2:27:36] glorified body. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; I'm a creator of atmospheres
[2:27:42] &gt;&gt; and I'm going to do whatever it takes to
[2:27:44] make sure that on that morning, on that
[2:27:46] day, when the dead in Christ shall rise,
[2:27:49] Lord, let the atmosphere around me
[2:27:50] produce those kind of results.
[2:27:53] &gt;&gt; Let the atmosphere of this bride begin
[2:27:54] to make the earth shake, not in a
[2:27:57] negative way, BUT WITH THE POWER, the
[2:27:59] transforming power of the Holy Spirit.
[2:28:02] LORD, LET OUR LIVES BEGIN TO CALL THE
[2:28:04] RESURRECTION. LET OUR LIVES begin to
[2:28:06] call for a rapture. May we be like
[2:28:08] Amram, Lord, there in Egypt. He began to
[2:28:10] call for a deliverance. He said, "Lord,
[2:28:12] YOU PROMISED IT. LORD, YOU PROMISED IT
[2:28:14] AND I'M LOOKING FOR YOU to fulfill it."
[2:28:16] And he speaks back. He says, "I'M GOING
[2:28:18] TO, BUT I'M LOOKING FOR THE RIGHT
[2:28:20] ATMOSPHERE. I'm ready for you to CREATE
[2:28:22] THE ATMOSPHERE WHERE I can move down and
[2:28:24] I can transform those mortal bodies and
[2:28:27] you can step from mortal into
[2:28:28] immortality AND WE CAN GO TO MEET OUR
[2:28:31] Lord in the air." Why can we do that? We
[2:28:34] are the creators of atmosphere. We've
[2:28:36] been restored to our position in this
[2:28:38] day. You have the right. You have the
[2:28:41] right to create the atmosphere in your
[2:28:42] home, in your life, to speak life over
[2:28:46] your children, and stand there and
[2:28:47] believe it's going to happen.
[2:28:50] Stand there and believe it's going to
[2:28:52] happen. And watch God begin to move over
[2:28:55] the chaos.
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; Watch the spirit of God move.
[2:29:00] Can we play that tonight? Spirit of God
[2:29:02] move. Write your word on my heart.
[2:29:04] Can we sing that together?
[2:29:07] Let's begin to create an atmosphere. The
[2:29:10] word has gone forth. You've listened.
[2:29:13] You've received. You've pulled on the
[2:29:15] gift of God. Thank you. You're such an
[2:29:16] incredible group. Your passion and your
[2:29:19] zeal. I love it so much. Now, let's just
[2:29:22] welcome him to move. You know your
[2:29:23] heart's desire. You know the atmospheres
[2:29:26] that need to be changed in your life so
[2:29:28] that you can receive the miraculous. I
[2:29:30] don't want to be a Zacharias that I'm
[2:29:32] doing it all right and I'm doing all
[2:29:34] this right. But in the moment when it's
[2:29:35] time for me to receive, I say this
[2:29:37] surely not.
[2:29:39] &gt;&gt; But right now in this moment as he
[2:29:41] speaks to your heart and he says it's
[2:29:43] your time to receive. Be a Mary and say
[2:29:44] I'm ready. Be it unto me, Lord. SPEAK TO
[2:29:47] MY HEART. WRITE YOUR WORD IN MY HEART,
[2:29:50] Lord Jesus.
[2:29:52] Hallelujah.
[2:29:54] Hallelujah. Will y'all help me start
[2:29:56] this tonight?
[2:29:58] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Write your word in my heart.
[2:30:09] Fill my whole being. Can you say this
[2:30:12] tonight? Lord,
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; consume my life.
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be an empty vessel.
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; I'm laying it all aside.
[2:30:23] every hindrance,
[2:30:26] &gt;&gt; every doubt, every fear, unbelief.
[2:30:29] Spirit of God, move over this chaos.
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; Lord, fill me aresh. Fill me a new,
[2:30:35] Lord. Lord, I need you to pour it out
[2:30:37] tonight. Spirit of God, move.
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; Spirit of God.
[2:30:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, there's trials. There's
[2:30:43] tribulations. I've been worrying. I've
[2:30:45] been doubting. I've been slipping. I've
[2:30:46] been sliding.

[2:30:50] Tonight's my moment. Tonight I'm
[2:30:52] stepping into reality. Tonight I'm
[2:30:54] stepping into manifestation.

[2:32:15] front to the devil. You can create all
[2:32:18] the atmospheres you want. What is the
[2:32:20] atmosphere of the end time? He's tearing
[2:32:22] people apart. He's ripping people apart.
[2:32:24] He's turning this one against this one.
[2:32:26] He's turning that. But we're going to
[2:32:27] show him tonight. You're facing a
[2:32:29] unified front. You're facing a people
[2:32:32] from different cultures, different
[2:32:33] backgrounds, different places. We all
[2:32:35] have a different raised in different
[2:32:36] families, different ideas, but we got
[2:32:38] one goal. We're going to make it.
[2:32:40] &gt;&gt; We're going to make it. You can bring
[2:32:41] your evil atmospheres. You can press in
[2:32:43] more than ever. You can bring more
[2:32:45] attacks, more depression. But tonight,
[2:32:47] tonight, we are rededicating ourselves,
[2:32:49] Lord. And we're going to allow you to
[2:32:51] move. And we're going to create an
[2:32:52] atmosphere right now, Lord, that you can
[2:32:53] just move down. And Lord, we just want
[2:32:55] to right now just offer up a prayer to
[2:32:57] you as we gather together. And and we
[2:32:59] offer a unity, Lord God, showing, Lord,
[2:33:02] that as a congregation, we're facing
[2:33:03] this time together, Lord. And we're
[2:33:05] inviting you to lead us. We're inviting
[2:33:07] you to guide us, Lord. anything in our
[2:33:09] life, we want to leave it right here
[2:33:10] together. We want to lay it down. Lord,
[2:33:12] why you doing this? I just want to show
[2:33:14] every brother and sister, we're not
[2:33:16] FIGHTING ALONE. WE GOT brothers and
[2:33:18] sisters around us. And we're standing
[2:33:19] together. We're standing in unity. And
[2:33:22] we come tonight to make a statement.
[2:33:23] Satan, we're going to create atmospheres
[2:33:26] that run you out of lives. We're going
[2:33:28] to create atmospheres that run you out
[2:33:29] of homes. You're not welcome IN THIS
[2:33:31] PLACE. YOUR DOUBT, your fear, your
[2:33:33] torment, trying to tear homes apart,
[2:33:35] trying to bring depression. We rebuke it
[2:33:37] tonight in the name of Jesus. And we
[2:33:40] stand in unity as a congregation here in
[2:33:42] Newf Finland in 2026 that we're going to
[2:33:45] continue to stand. We're going TO
[2:33:47] CONTINUE TO FIGHT. WE'RE GOING TO PRESS
[2:33:48] THE battle in the midst of Leonardia, in
[2:33:51] the midst of evil atmospheres. WE WON'T
[2:33:53] BACK DOWN. WE WON'T GIVE IN. THERE IS A
[2:33:56] PLACE FOR US IN ETERNITY. OH, GLORY TO
[2:33:58] GOD. LET YOUR PEOPLE, LORD, WALK IN
[2:34:01] VICTORY and create THE ATMOSPHERE WHERE
[2:34:03] ALL things are possible. Hallelujah.
[2:34:06] Father, we dedicate our lives.
[2:34:09] &gt;&gt; We surrender ourselves, Lord, as
[2:34:11] individuals, but also, Lord, as a
[2:34:12] church. Father, I pray you'll just bless
[2:34:14] them like never before. May they
[2:34:16] recognize their importance to the body,
[2:34:19] Lord. There's no little church, big
[2:34:20] church. We are the church,
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; Lord. And we're marching towards, Lord,
[2:34:24] that rapture to the tune of Onward
[2:34:26] Christian Soldier, Lord. May every
[2:34:28] family be refreshed. May every family be
[2:34:31] renewed. May every child feel your
[2:34:33] loving arms wrap around them tonight,
[2:34:35] Lord, as they recognize I'm important. I
[2:34:38] don't have to be beat down, but I can
[2:34:40] raise up. I can put my my foot on the
[2:34:42] bow of the boat tonight. And I have
[2:34:44] brothers and sisters standing by me
[2:34:47] shouldertosh shoulder, shouldertosh
[2:34:49] shoulder to fight the fight. I tell you
[2:34:53] tonight, you're surrounded by lovely men
[2:34:54] and women. You're surrounded by
[2:34:56] Christians, by soldiers of the cross,
[2:34:58] and by Jesus Christ himself. If you've
[2:35:01] got anything you want to leave, just
[2:35:03] leave it here tonight. Just leave it.
[2:35:06] Just leave it. Walk away with a new
[2:35:07] determination. I'm not talking about a
[2:35:09] New Year's resolution. I'm talking about
[2:35:11] a new determination to let Jesus Christ
[2:35:13] have his way. Let him write your story
[2:35:16] in the coming days. Let him be your
[2:35:18] leader in the coming days. Just
[2:35:20] surrender it all to him as we sing it
[2:35:22] again in unison together from one heart
[2:35:24] and one accord. And we say, "Lord Jesus,
[2:35:27] move in our midst."

[3:02:29] atmosphere, heavenly father. Lord, set
[3:02:32] our eyes on things above, Lord. Set our
[3:02:35] eyes on the word, Lord, for the thing we
[3:02:36] look at is what sets our atmosphere,
[3:02:38] Lord God. Lord, I pray you help us to
[3:02:40] have a positive confession that your
[3:02:43] word is yay and amen. Lord, let your
[3:02:46] word be born, Lord, in the lives of the
[3:02:49] believers that stand before us this
[3:02:50] evening.
[3:02:52] Lord, I pray that you would just be with
[3:02:54] brother Aaron, Lord. Restore him,
[3:02:56] refresh him as well, Lord. Give him,
[3:02:58] Lord, your word for the service
[3:02:59] tomorrow. Heavenly Father, bless him
[3:03:01] richly,
[3:03:02] Lord. each one that's worshiped you
[3:03:04] tonight, Lord, that's raised their
[3:03:06] hands, that's defied gravity, Lord, I
[3:03:09] pray that you would just, Lord, do a
[3:03:11] special thing in their life. Lord, as
[3:03:14] they go home, may they just dwell on the
[3:03:16] things that you've anchored in their
[3:03:17] heart, Lord. May they dwell on the the
[3:03:19] power, Lord, of dwelling on your word,
[3:03:23] Lord, of looking to what you said rather
[3:03:24] than what the world says, to looking
[3:03:26] what you say is real rather than what
[3:03:28] the conditions and circumstances say.
[3:03:30] Heavenly Father, Lord, let us shout out
[3:03:32] all these senses, Lord, and hold on to
[3:03:34] that super sense of faith, Lord, by
[3:03:36] grace that we could lay hold of your
[3:03:38] word, Lord. And when Satan comes in,
[3:03:41] Lord, and rise like a flood, Lord, your
[3:03:43] Holy Spirit would raise a standard,
[3:03:45] Lord. Pour more of himself in. Point us
[3:03:48] to the word that gives us victory, Lord.
[3:03:51] Bless your people. Lord, be with us as
[3:03:54] we go out tonight. We pray. In Jesus
[3:03:56] Christ's name we ask it. Amen.
[3:03:59] And he is aable,
[3:04:03] more
[3:04:04] than a
[3:04:08] to accomplish what concerns me today.
[3:04:15] He is a
