those that are present amen that's uh five ten oh i'm thinking of grace amen so we thank the lord for 10. double grace twice the amount of grace thank the lord amen so and god god bless those that are online and i understand that online that uh that there are brethren around the world just checking in on the youtube there amen and to listen to the ministry of the word and i was saying i was in communication by email with a brother in africa and uh he said brother you may not be unaware of it but he said there's there's uh a number of african people and ministering brothers and so on he said that that tune in online and uh he said to for the to hear the ministry and they've heard myself again of course preaching and they've also heard our brother jonathan ministering online amen so we don't know really who who we're talking to when it comes to ministering the word and when you're you're reflecting worship and praising the lord amen it's a it's even that's a blessing to the people amen and not just a singing and not just the music we appreciate it but it is the spirit that anoints it and the ministry of the word to god be the glory so god again god's grace and god's blessing upon those not with us amen in grace and again let me say this that it it does strike us when things come to this this level and we're not allowed to go to church we're not allowed to do this and so on and they reduce the numbers numbers numbers and and just not what's going on out there in the world but they they they do put the emphasis on on churches you know and i think right now this time they're putting the emphasis on on the faith groups and so on well that's church groups you know not just us but there's another group and another group so i pray the grace of god with us to you know to do as jesus said and i praise grace with air tonight concerning what jesus said where the bible says where two or three are gathered together my name there am i in the midst but from the original version of it it says where i have gathered two or three in my name he said i am in the midst because there's there's there are those that are meeting in the name of the lord meeting because of this word or that verse narrow scriptures just before jesus never never put them together amen it's the influence of man or is the influence of a religious spirit amen the devil a amen so trusting that we're here because of the holy ghost amen where two or three i've gathered in my name i am there in the midst he said he's there to bless you there to encourage you there to meet your need so the god of all grace be with us here and be with the brothers and sisters at home again whether it's two or three believers whether it's two or three it might be members of the same family amen trust the lord amen amen god is with them there and trusting and believing that god is with us here by grace amen praise the name of the lord god help us to have that faith and also to bring greetings to the saints from our brother clarence stride and he called the other night and i spoke with him on the phone for a while and uh his uh stepdaughter i believe is sister linda peckford and uh i've a number of times where i've met our brother stride out there and sister linda's been there as well amen so god bless sister linda and i've known her again for many many many years because as far back as i can almost remember that i remember that sister linda was there of course they lived maybe a lot closer to bishop falls than they do now so we pray the grace of god to sister linda and understand that she'll be supporting the ministry here folks supporting the work here or has started to support the ministry and work here so i say god bless her amen so alleluia to god be the glory so be in prayer again for the ellsworths and uh trusting within a few days maybe that we'll find maybe the what time that they will be back here to see the the doctor or the surgeon that did did the surgery for our brother ellsworth so we pray grace to our brother ellsworth history ellsworth amen and it's been a long time since i've been in touch with this other family but praying the grace of god to the butt family derek butt and his wife and and family that lives in this in carmenville the same town that brother ellsworth lives in it's been a long long time so we pray the grace of god to them amen and to their children and as i said it was many many years ago and since i had a fellowship with him and it wasn't long ago maybe just a few months ago that our brother derek and his son came to our apartment there at the condo because they they wanted me to fill in some papers and sign some papers for brother derrick's son i think his name is andrew so i pray the grace of god to them amen grace grace grace and again to keep the saints online in prayer and again don't think that brother gerald's just ministering to you ministering to people that we've never known on this earth amen but by grace we'll meet him in glory amen and again keep our brother jacob jonah in prayer and uh what's the other brother's name is leo leo he's the brother that ministered here yeah and he was in ontario and he came down here and ministered and went back again so we pray the grace of god to brother leonie and he he's got needs right now so pray gracious he's emailed me for prayer and because of the needs that he's got he's responsible for so many believers in uganda and and i think it's four churches that's sort of under his control and he's got to govern and and lay the word in for him so we pray the grace of god to him and his wife when they just when they go from one church to another one church to another ministering to the saints amen god bless him amen and i know i do believe too that there are ministries and churches in canada and in the united states that are helping the brother but again when you consider four churches as a as a big ministry and not only that not like this where this is a palace compared to the churches that he's that he's ministered to oh yeah because there's some churches they got a roof they got a roof they got a you got a floor but when it comes to the the walls there's no walls it's just uh just a frame amen so god help them it's my prayer whether i pray that the word is as good to us as it maybe is good to them that regardless if you got nowhere to go amen you appreciate the word the message amen so the lord bless us and tonight we are going to uh hear brother madam minister and it'll be about an hour i think and uh and the message is the world is falling apart amen if it ever was it is amen and it is falling apart so i pray the grace of god that we have that by not in our heads knowledge but by a revelation in our souls amen that it is god amen to god be the glory to stay with the word amen it's like one time that i was asked to be in a cemetery that on the bureau peninsula and i was asked to go up and give direction to a gentleman there in a tractor that was digging a grave oh and he didn't know how to do it didn't know where to do it now where's it i said over here right there and he went over and i said no you don't do it that way he said what do you mean and i said because i said this i said represents resurrection and i said that did go down and we're trusting and believing that they'll come back up you know in another dimension and he said what do you mean i said well i said you're you're going to dig this grave i said facing the west i said no i should dig it facing the east or you're going to dig it facing the north no i said facing the east when they put that coffin down the person is looking toward the east he said never heard it before and i said why why toward the east i said because that's the rising of the sun amen and most protestant churches and i think he was a roman catholic he didn't realize that and you go to some catholic church cemeteries and they're not facing east they're facing north or south or west nor you got to face east it's a testimony of the resurrection amen because that's what every every morning when the sun comes up it doesn't come up in the north or the south or the west it comes up in the east amen it goes on it closes in in the west and we're witnessing to believe the dawning of a new day amen and their son is rising in the in in the east so the god of all grace be with us see regardless what you're doing is to reflect your faith amen i don't know if that brother that gentleman in that tractor was dug any more graves but according to him i think he dug a lot of graves but they weren't facing east he said i was never told that so he said thank you amen and oh i'm not sure i think it might have been the the burial of a funeral of sister betty's uh grandmother it was her grandmother dunford mr dumford's mother amen and i have fellowship with her of course in that in your home for quite a while amen and i prayed with her but i do appreciate and i do have a picture of her sitting on her couch in her kitchen and she's there with the book that she only read and that was the bible amen and i got a picture over there because i noticed every time i go there looking and say goodbye or hello she's sitting on the couch with a bible and she was reading it oh i said praise the lord god rest her soul amen to god be the glory so the lord bless us as we go into the message on the world is falling apart and it was preached in new york and it was uh this was in uh november the 15th and i think it was two weeks later that he that he preached it again i'm not sure exactly where but he preached it again the world is falling apart and and amen so brother if we can see it if he saw it then what do we see now amen because what we're seeing is a testimony that it is finished amen when jesus wrong on the cross and he's practically his last words it is finished amen his ministry and brother i believe that we are witnessing that again grace to the bride amen he has come and brother and and and what he has done and what he's doing is a sign that it's finished it's over with luke amen because our redemption resurrection rapture is at hand but not just that either to bring to your thoughts and understanding the revelation of the prophet when he highlighted the fact that the rapture is going on now he said it's taking place now amen and what what what's the evidence well the evidence as time goes on that we're getting further and further away from the world getting further and further away from from the interest in this interest in that the natural things of life we're getting more and more interested in the spiritual not the natural amen and brother again that's why we see all that's going on in the world right now and it is around the world concerning this covet 19 amen and it's causing many to do to put beyond their guard with this beyond their guard with that they're so caught up with the natural things and and i'm letting the fact that when you when you get together you got to wear the the the mosque or the mask you got to wear not a mosque no the mosque will wear us amen so are you going to wear the mask and uh well brother i tell you they're going to need more than a mask and i guarantee you we as believers can wear a mask and leave the rest with the lord amen but our faith is in god but again the world is wearing it and their faith is in the mask oh it is that's right brother their faith is in the mask what man tells them to do they'll do this do this do this but brother no god's looking for something else amen and and really what god is looking for man is forgotten man is ignored man is not seriously considering it oh if they believe it was god oh yes they said well maybe this is going to happen maybe that's good but oh if it's god and god god is going to change it god will take it back to normal again you know it's the devil god has permitted it for a reason to bring up what's in the world and listen saints it's also done and allowed for a reason to bring up what's in you and me amen it'll it'll highlight the unbelief that's in the world but it'll highlight the faith that's in the bride amen because the bride looks up to god be the glory so god be with us and god bless the saints again as we go into the word on the world is falling apart but before we go in our last god brothers maybe they can you can set yes praise the lord uh well maybe we can say stand and listen only believe amen only believe only believe all things are possible only believe all things are possible only believe jesus is here jesus is here amen hallelujah amen praise the lord jesus is here amen yes lord amen jesus is here jesus is here all things are possible jesus is here pray and trust god pray amen hallelujah hallelujah all things are possible amen hallelujah pray trust god amen hallelujah pray and trust god pray and trust god all things are possible amen pray and trust god yes lord help us to pray and trust you that was to pray and commit all things into your hands lord so that it is not my will but thy will be done amen in an hour lord where things are coming to pass things that are happening lord in the world that's causing lord yes many a man and woman and child to look up and ask you to do this and do this for them lord to change this and change that but lord not might will thine be done amen when we realize what's going on is there is the word of the lord being fulfilled what is going on is a sign to the bride it is a sign to the believers amen that we have reached the end of all things so lord we're not asking you to change this or stop this or stop that we let it go in the name of the lord amen and we're looking more and more and more to the resurrection we're looking more and more and more to the rapture amen grace that we will have the faith that we're living in the hour of the change hallelujah the world is changing amen but grace help us to believe that we are changing amen amen hallelujah so lord we're changing from creatures of time to creatures of eternity amen help us to trust you help us to believe you help us to accept and lay our lives down for the word because it is written amen hallelujah that will believe it is written amen the bible for lord it is the prophecy lord concerning the nearness of the coming the nearest sword of the resurrection the nearness of the rapture amen help us just to leave it in your hands and move on to the resurrection and rapturing faith by the grace of god trust the lord hallelujah that what you've done in our day in the revelation of your word will give us the faith that we need and lord we need that faith of the resurrection we need the faith of the rapture we need that faith to take us out of time and into eternity so lord we pray to commit it all into your care in the going forth of your word and i pray lord in the name of jesus lord that you'll press us down into our hearts into our souls amen that we'll go deeper and deeper into the revelation and believe that the end of all things is upon us the end of the world has come amen alba's lord that no lord not to trust man not just look for you to change it and reverse it all back no lord because it's moving forward amen and more and more and more prophecy is being fulfilled it's a grace that we're going to look up more and more and more and believe more and more for the resurrection and the rapture amen to believe that we are being changed hallelujah from time from time to eternity we're being changed from the flesh to the to the spirit all for the glory of god so grace we commit all into your care soul body and spirit grace to the saints online grace to the saints father who gathered into this chapter this church today for your glory your honor your praise and the building up of the body and the most holy faith in the name of our lord jesus christ amen and amen praise the lord god bless you turn with me to psalms 106. psalm 106 amen be in prayer for the saints that that had to stay at home amen the grace of god to them the grace of god to to our young brothers and sisters for the glory of god amen and in psalm 106 praise ye the lord amen oh give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever amen who can utter the mighty acts of the lord who can show forth all his praise blessed are they that keep judgment and he that doeth righteousness at all times amen god help us amen remember me o lord with the favor that thou bearished unto thy people o visit me with thy salvation amen that i may see the good of thy chosen that i may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation and that i may glory with thine inheritance praise the lord we have sinned with our fathers we have committed iniquity we have done wickedly our fathers understood not thy wonders in egypt they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies god help us not to forget but provoked him at the red sea or at the sea even at the red sea amen questioning god nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake that he might make his mighty power to be known amen grace that our lives reflect the power the anointing of god amen with us in us and it says verse 9 he rebuked the sea the red sea also and it was dried up so he led them through the depths as through the wilderness amen thank god and he say he saved them from the hand of him that hated them and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy he did it to them he's doing it to us amen and the waters cover their enemies and there was not one of them left then believed they is words they saying is praise amen but it says verse 13 they soon forget his works let's be ever mindful of what god has done and what god's doing there's a lot going on there in the world but there is a grace of god to you and me amen keeping our keeping our faith built up amen thank god brothers is god in us god with us grace it says they belie then they believed that his words they sang his praise but they soon forgot his works amen and they waited not for his counsel god help us stay with the word but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness and tempted god in the desert oh yeah they got to the place where they were lusting get back in egypt again yeah but that wasn't joshua joshua and caleb's attitude no no not indeed the promise was more real to them than egypt amen the promise was more real to joshua and caleb than what the world what the the jews were enjoying in the wilderness oh god help us yes they lusted exceedingly in the wilderness and tempted god in the desert don't tempt god amen and he gave them their requests but sent leanness into their soul amen i trust that we're not getting leanness but we're building up building ourselves up in the spiritual fact of his word amen he remember he sent leanness into their souls buddy but to the elect he builds you up in the most holy faith stay with the word they envy moses also in the camp and aaron the saint of the lord yeah and the earth opened and swallowed up dathan and covered the company of a a barum and a fire was kindled in their company the flame burned up the wicked god help us well that's what the world is heading to amen they made a calf in oreb and worshiped the molten image thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass they forget god their savior which had done great things in egypt amen let's not forget what god has done then we'll appreciate what he's doing wondrous works in the land of ham and terrible things by the red sea therefore he said that he would destroy them and not moses his chosen stood before him in the beach breach to turn away his wrath lest he should destroy them moses the spirit of christ interceding amen yea they despise the pleasant land they believe not his word but murmured in their tents and arken not unto the voice of the lord therefore he lifted up his hand against them to overthrow them in the wilderness amen to overthrow their seed also among the nations to scatter them in the lands they joined themselves also onto baal poor pior and ate the sacrifice of the dead thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions amen to provoking god to anger with their inventions today and the plague breaking upon them and then stood up for phineas and executed judgment and so the plague was stayed and that was counted on to him for righteousness unto all generations forevermore we're trusting what jesus did amen and it's just not the man william branham we thank god for the prophet and for the revealed word god let it give you us a greater revelation of jesus amen by the grace of god amen he said blessed last verse blessed be the lord god of israel from everlasting to everlasting and let all the people say amen praise ye the lord hallelujah so god bless us you may be seated and ask our brother vaishal to bring forth the ministry of the word amen now just before we look on the word let's speak to the author just in a minute heavenly father this is your word and we read in the bible that we're cleansed by the water of the word and we know in the old testament how they took the heifer the red heifer and killed her the whole congregation and she was burned and then the ashes was kept outside the courts for uh a waters of separation that that the hands that handled this must be clean hands and i pray that god is just waters of separation the word that separates us from death to life cleanse our thoughts our hearts lord and if there be any thing you find in us it's not just right cleanse it lord by this water of separation tonight take our sins away father we we want to stand daily before you dying to ourselves that we might live in christ bless the word as we read it and you promised that it would it would not return void but it it would accomplish that which it was purpose to do and we pray that you'll grant this through jesus name amen amen in the book of the revelation of jesus christ we find i'm going to read just a little bit from the sixth seal out of the book of revelations found in the sixth chapter of the revelation and then we will begin with the twelfth verse and then i also want to read from hebrews 12 25 uh to for another little quotation for some scriptures i got written down here and a few things i would like to speak on if the lord willing and now on revelation 6 12 and i beheld when he had opened the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the sun became as black as santa claus of hair and the moon became his blood and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree cast her untimely face when she's shaken of a mighty wind the heavens departed as a scroll when it's rolled together and every mountain and every island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great man and the rich man the chief captains and the mighty man ever bombed the never freeman hid themselves in dens and in rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that set us upon the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand now in the book of hebrews the 12th chapter and beginning with the 25th verse see that you refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him and spake on the earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from that from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he has a point saying yea once more i shake not the earth only but also the heavens and this word yet once more signifying removing of those things which are shaken as all things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain wherefore we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptable with reverence and godly fear or god is a consuming fire now this is a little text that i would like to draw from that to make the text out of it if i should call it i hope i don't hold you too long and so um don't forget tomorrow night now to come early to get the prayer cards and we'll have a prayer line where we pray for all the people so it's got the prayer cause my text tonight is the world is falling apart it's a very odd text but i'm thinking today as uh i had the glorious opportunity and the grand privilege to walk with uh brother vic this honorable noble servant of christ with brother joseph my precious friend also we had um um well it was dinner to me i think it's lunch to you all here but if that's dinner then uh this is dinner tonight and that's lunch and breakfast where does my supper come in i feel like i've left out something and then as we went to dinner and come back down the street we were noticing they were putting up starting to put up things for christmas we are approaching the christmas season and right over a month away but all the stores is getting out all their christmas sales how far they miss the meaning of christmas it's become just a commercial act all the holidays have become that mother's day father's day everyday rv mother and father's day and they have uh all the easter santa claus took the touch the birthplace a rabbit chicken a little duck took the resurrection time it's all chickens and ducks and ages and what y'all got to do with the resurrection it's too bad we that puts it before our children a many a little boy right here tonight can tell you more about davey crockett and he can tell you about jesus christ because it's a great commercial thing they take clothes like some cowboy or some hero and or something of some uh outlaw or something and and they sell clothes that looks like him and and then all the little children know about it we'll read the history of it if we could just get the program of christ over to the people like us you usually try to impersonate what you read yeah the readers i remember it's been always been that with me on remember one time as a little boy about 12 years old down in the public library i got a hold of the uh one of zane gray's books called the lone ranger i rode mama's broom to death as a hobby horse around around the house so i broke it up later on i read edgar ice buer's story of tars tarzan the apes and i slept in a tree because i i was reading that that was on my mind and oh one day i got a hold of something's real a truth not a fiction ever since then i want my life to be like his i found something that was real when i read the bible in the life of jesus christ now as we approach this season it's very familiar the world is just about the same condition it was 2 000 years ago when he come on earth on his first event when he came to the earth the earth had met its time ever so often the world gets in such a chaotic condition until there's nothing can help it we've had this several times these preludes and we we find that each time when it meets this condition and it causes people to to start praying and they feel that everything's played itself out and to all of our systems and everything that we have play itself to the end it did that in the andalusian world and so forth uh politics and and other things just comes to its end there's no more to it and i think all that's done by god for a purpose to kind of uh rejuvenate to kind of bring back it has a way of renewing itself and i think it's just a law of god that these things comes to that place the time of christ's first advent i i believe we could say the world was falling apart it was a corruptible time in politics across all time and in religion the whole systems have become corrupted that mingle uh injecting other things and man-made theories into religions and so forth until the whole thing was corruptible and the world was a falling apart and the world at that time was praying for a messiah now the romans was praying for a messiah the greeks wanted a messiah the jews wanted a messiah and god gave him a messiah but they didn't want it the way he sent it and i wonder today in our chaotic time that if all of us reaching this place again as we approach christmas we find the world about the same condition morally decayed and politics is decades religious life is is decade denominationalism is the cage and everything is just corrupted and all of us are looking for uh something to help us out of it all of us are expecting a messiah i wonder if god sent us the messiah if we would just about do the same thing they've done in the past we wouldn't know him we'd know who he was i don't think the world would recognize him at all and notice why here's my thought the reason why the romans they had their idea what a messiah should be each one of us has got our own ideas each denomination has its ideas we've been taught drawn out on charts and everything what the messiah should be that's going to be our church is the ones going to receive it well the jews the pharisees thought that and so the sadducees taught their side same thing you see spirits doesn't die just the man that's occupied see that the devil doesn't take his spirit he only takes it the man and the good thing about it god doesn't take his spirit later see it remains just the name same spears upon christ is upon the believer today a true believer now notice the romans in that day were looking for a messiah a politician they wanted somebody or to come down from jupiter or someone to come down with a chair a fire and a son behind his head and he drove the chats across the sky and wanted jupiter to come down and give him the gimmick uh the military secret how they could stomp out the whole world that's what they wanted to do they wanted to be down the greeks and and master the whole world that's kind of messiah they wanted well the greeks wanted that kind of messiah to come and tell them just exactly the kind of strategy that they could use to beat the romans down see that's kind in the jews they were looking for a general some man that was coming with a rod of r in his hand and a lion a tribe of judah and he was going to a rule nations and run rome out into the river and drown them and and and israel was going to take over that's the reason why he come exactly the way the scripture said he would come but they was looking for him in a different way if it wouldn't be the same thing today if he comes if we wouldn't think that we have our own ideas about what he ought to be and what he ought to look like and how he should wear his clothes and parties hair everything if it isn't just on the taste but we wouldn't receive it you see i mean we the world today all right they are there the jews uh they rejected the messiah because that he didn't fit their taste he didn't a few days ago a fine uh taylor out in tucson was uh cutting some trousers farming and he was curious i heard he's broken english and and i said uh what are you jewish he said yes sir and he said i suppose you're christian i said yes sir so he went ahead fixing my trousers and i thought i let him lead next and he said uh well he said i have nothing against you christians i said thank you sir i have nothing against you and he said he said i said what's your opinion of christ he said he came uh too early and they said he was too young for the job and i said yes sir he said it was just a little too young for his job so now christ of jesus were to come today not christ they don't believe it so jesus would have come today his program had been all right said it's something another like rockefeller and goldwater said they're fighting one another and in the same party and he said you see uh they wanted to be doing that i said that's correct said when jesus came said he come fighting his own party his people i said oh no he came to his own in his own receiving heart that was interesting so i let him rest till i get back and see a little at a time because i remember god glided his eye i thought i could see so i i'm very grateful to the race that i certainly am don't you worry israel if you're sitting here your time sooner than now many times we say that no he wasn't no he was not jew he was a jew not gentile he was god see the hemoglobin is where the life cell is and the lifestyle was a creative cell by god there was no no social life between god and mary there's not even a sensation he's created both germs right egg and cell and he was neither jew nor gentile he was that breach between he was god and if he was jewish blood were lost if his gentile blood were lost he was the blood of god created without sexual desire that's that's reason our faith can look there and stand assured that's it so he died for both now we find that when he came oh he didn't come in the taste of the jew so they conditioned it we can't stand about because we do the same thing what a cause is that i believe there was a cause for that and i think it is because they have tucked the word of god and made it of no effect by their traditions jesus said so he said you by your traditions has made the word of god of no effect that's right it wasn't effective because it added and projected into it their traditions and when you can't add nothing to that you can't take nothing from it it's that's just the way it is that's why god preserved it we can't add creeds and dogmas and things to inject in that that's don't need any help that's that's him that's human letter form and the word is the seed and the seed in the right kind of ground will grow if you don't dig it up every morning to find out where it's grown or not you just plant it commit it to god and leave it there that's the way that it goes just leave it the way it's in the ground and that's where it's supposed to be the ground of your heart faith is lord and hour they say god said so it's mine that's the way to do it so the whole world then was falling apart like it is today every nation was looking for someone to to uh hold them out uh this tragedy it was about to strike the world and trying to hold them together the nations were looking for something and and each nation was looking for it but they looked like they didn't want to accept what god sent them they were asking for a man a messiah that would stop out the wrestling nation and god give them a baby asking for a general and got a baby god knowed what they had need of he humiliated them that's what god does he humiliates us when we think we know something like he said to joe you're so got so much wisdom why was you where i lived the foundation of the world when the morning stars sing together and the sons of god shouted for joy where is he job when his wisdom was done see god humiliates us when we get to thinking we're something great when we think our organization is the only one god will come back from something is nowhere rise up something and humiliate us by it he always does it that way yes he they asked for a general and got a baby god know what they had need of that's right they asked for a general and got a savior although they thought they were saved but god's visit to him showed that they wasn't maybe that's a whole that's what's the matter today the world faiths are saved by joining church but they need a savior if that isn't a picture of the world today i don't know the world that's just about the way it is at this christmas again we find the same thing the world falling apart if you go to this that's gone you go to this that's gone it's got that way so that we will come to this it takes all the props out from under us so that we can we can have to come to the only resource there is and that's eternal life it's uh now looking today as it was then for some system to hold it together as it was then it is now again falling apart in the religious world then was looking for a promised messiah to do this and god keeps his promise he never fails to keep his promise in all ages when the world was falling apart in the time of noah god sent him a mighty prophet what did they do with it turn it down what is the prophet the one the word comes to it's the word of god again in the time of a nor they said in moses time a whole system is falling apart they sent a prophet in elijah's time a whole system is falling apart they set a profit every time when the world gets in this chaos they send a prophet and then at this first christmas he set the word in its fullness see the word opposed to the word and the prophet prophet had the message for that age and he went forth giving the prophet and what did they do with them each time stone them they didn't agree with their systems and put them to death jesus said you do garnish the walls of the prophets the tombs in your fathers put them in there and you testify that you're their children see they do it it's just too bad but that's that's the world see it's always god sends his word and wisdom tries to burst the word that's the way it was at the beginning the very thing started the whole system of sin was because somebody eve satan produced a better plan than god's he produce wisdom they eat from the tree of knowledge wisdom always takes you away from god faith brings you back to god you don't know god but you're a great wisdom you and it's so good it said the world is foolishness to god but it please god through the foolishness of preaching his word to save the lost so god always used something foolish and simple when he called his disciples if he would have uh chosen campuses and the great priests that they had trained for that hour there's been something to brag on they had their doctor's degree and everything but he goes down and gets ignorant man fishermen who couldn't even read their own name or write their own name and he might take nothing and make something out of it even the great saint paul said he had to forget all he ever known that he might find christ he told the church i would come to you with the excesses of words of wisdom of this world because you build your faith in that and look today people don't want a pastor that's he can talk just properly make all these nouns and pronouns and of that be so i couldn't get no pulp because [Music] [Applause] the thing we want to know is him but to see our religious system has uh adopted the educational system and took the place of the holy spirit that's what it's done now in the days of noah the days of moses they sent the prophets to them and what do they do storm amen put them to death song to pieces burn them any way you get rid of them get them off with their hands yeah jesus taught the very fine abrupt terrible when he said there was a man a great man made him had a vineyard and put dressers in it and he sent a servant and they killed him and sent another servant and they killed him and so forth and said finally he said i'll send the son and they'll regard him and the the dressers of the vineyard said this is heir let's kill him that was god's son that he sent sending the prophets saying his word the word god you remember every fallen generation there's only one thing that can bridge this world together that's the word of god this world was made by the word of god is praying together by the word of god that's the only thing to ever keep it together is the word of god our hebrews said we understand that the world was framed by the word of god people doubt the word of god in the very dirt that you're sitting on this a word of god made manifest the very seeks that you're sitting in it's a word of god made manifest [Music] god speaks it it has to happen because it's uh the word of god now the only thing that can keep it together will never be a political system it'll never be a u.n it'll never be any of these organizations it'll be the word of god that keeps the world together that's the only thing that i can recommend today to keep the world from falling apart right now is back to the word of god that's god's program always the garden of eden satan come along and said to eve he said uh you should take the fruit of the tree and uh she said but the lord said i said now oh surely you'll not die see he knows as long as people stay fortified this is what we're supposed to say 45 is the word see we are surrounded by the word the word is in you god in you around you wherever you go it's the word the word keep him always before you remember be conscious of him everywhere now when even adam walked like that there was no death the man or woman that walks like that now there's no death to him they got eternal life when you're when you're surrounded and kept by the word now watch wisdom comes up the verse the word and when it does it broke that barrier and when satan found out that that was the place he could hit the human race that's exactly what's hit it every time even in an antichrist spirit so close that were to see the very elect in the last age it comes in the form of religion now there's not no such thing as a communistic party ever fooling anybody there are anti-gods you begin with but that's not the antichrist the antichrist is religion so close he was deceived they're very elected look at judah says walk back with the church and profess christ he done everything the rest of them did went out and even cast out devils and come back rejoicing with him correctly matthew 10 but when it come to the place at pentecost to receive eternal life he showed his colors that's what comes today the devil lets you have all the church joining you want to but when it comes to the time that you receive the holy ghost hearts a bunch of holy rollers or something you don't want nothing to do with that and judas and his system can follow right up to that hour because that's where judas deceived the world up to that spot but he couldn't do it that's the elected right there now he can come that close but he uh but he can't come the rest away because if you would he'd be your brother then so you can't you do that somebody said you know the devil got me no he never he you went not enter him he never come and got you because you are dead and your life is hitting god and sealed by the holy ghost the only way he can ever get in there is the same way you did so he just invited you walked out to him that's all see it isn't he coming after you he can't come in there for you are in christ dead to yourself amen i'm not amen myself but that he's so big and i know it's true uh experienced it and know that it's true it's passing from death unto life to receive christ in you all right now we find then that the religious world and that day was falling apart and um they had always done it before and why is because that the coming prophets and the coming messiah did not meet their specification there is a theological term for it they it didn't that's the way we'll be today uh this is probably today that we're we're stunned in this day because in the move of god because it even in the churches it doesn't exactly come to the terms of what they've got to figure out it should be they figure out that there should be a time that certain certain things don't happen and and then when the real criminality comes down well then they reject that then and uh what's the use of putting up electric water if you refuse that animal see they can't get no kerning it's just a dead law that's what's the matter with the church today we got all the wires up you press the button there's no light what we need is get connected that's all of us get connected with christ our lives of our emotions the lives of our minds connected in him you say well i i tell you i i uh i believe i you have got no you ain't got no thought coming that's right you said i think this you have a god of thought i haven't either the bible said let the mind that was in christ be in you and he was always about the father's business so that's the only thought you ought to have what god said about it not what somebody else said but what god said that's all you see he said all the man's word be lying mind me the truth that's the thing to put the world back together but they won't receive it now we know they won't cause they never did all right we wonder then if the answer is today the cry today is for help for the messiah to come and i believe sometimes if we would if he would stand it i wonder if we would do the same thing he did then all of our politics both in religion and both in the uh federal life and so forth is polluted uh we polluted our worship with man-made designed fashions fashioned and designed a man-made to fit every cult that's on the face of the earth everyone's got their own idea again it must be come again like it was in the days when god rolls up the mighty prophet isaiah said your sacrifices and things has become a states in my nose see israel first when god told him to take a sacrifice and go over it while it was a great thing you can imagine a jew going down the road with a lamb a fat little lamb or a bulldog or whatever he was it was a passover and he goes down lays his hands upon the sacrifice that's connecting himself identifying himself with the sacrifice when he puts his hand on the priest killed the beast the little lamb whatever it was and there's a little fella died kicking and blading the blood splashed upon his hands and the worshiper in sincerity no that that shouldn't be him but the lamb was taking his place that's what jehovah required because it was a type of christ but one time that kept on going on until it became a family tradition they offered the land just the same but there was no sincerity about it god said they sneak in my nostrils and today years ago we used to find the people in deep sincerity and worship and today it's become a big glamour of hollywood just uh some kind of a trained uh music and uh women up on the platform with their clothes tight enough to skin on the outside almost dancing around on the platform no sincerity you're not almost making an uh uh just an outlet a ridiculous shame professing christianity i wonder if our offerings hasn't become kind of stench in his nose again our differences it's such a shame that the enemy has taken our american women and stripped them down out there on the streets and why it's it's a disgrace no wonder little boys and little girls and things are in such a shape as they are today they're always trying to pattern after some woman out here in hollywood married four or five times and she'll come out with some sort of a nude clothes on and all the little girls in the country a pattern after that what a pity that's too bad yes sir it's too bad you got into the church the beautiful virtue that god gave a woman to be a mother has been marred and that's the backbone of the nation you break motherhood you broke the nation right then that's one thing it helps hold it together real genuine parenthood i was talking to the cab driver coming down we talked about some delinquent children up there and he said i think it's the parents i said hey man oh i don't know who you are but you're on the right road and i said that's right i said it's too bad that they took the bible out of the home and gave him a deck of cards and i started in the church standing on the elevator a few moments ago in a certain moment on there talking to another said well you know he said this is a wonderful thing our church is giving a card party and how they were going to have some kind of a thanksgiving turkey affair that there's going out of a protestant church home gambling lottery bunker dances oh when it gets to a time that people have to do stuff like that to entertain the church the church born again the holy ghost entertains the church with eternal life but people they don't want that because they're pleasure stricken it's too bad that the things happen the way we have long ago too long ago as the beautiful virtue of women and their fine dress has bowed before the shrine of the goddess of hollywood to truth it's such a pity that the world's got in a place like that nation backbone is broken sex appeal is many times regarded as fashion people dressing going out on the street you know what the bible said i'll tell you i was speaking on that one time and there's a noted minister said to me he said uh why don't you leave away from them women doing that saying that i told him i said said you ought to teach them how to become prophetess and so forth like that i said how am i going to teach them algebra when they won't even learn their abcs always believe christ you know hey bc and so i said how can you do that all these things have just been a great conglomeration that's weeded into the church it's too bad it's getting amongst we pentecostal people old people stop paint you may call me a fanatic now but that's a day of the judgment you'll shake my hand uh i love you what's your godly lie and i want you to be right friends what's used to taking any chance on such things as that a lady said to me so mr random they they don't they that's the only kind of clothes they make for women i said they still make goods and sell sewing machines there's no excuse to try look and let me say one thing again is this you know if you dress like that and some center on the street looks at you in the wrong way you're going to answer at the day of judgment for committing adultery with that sinner you might be as virtues to your husband as you can be you might be his virtues to your boyfriend as loyal as you know how to be but in the sight of god you're a street heart you say is that right threw that by the word brother brown he said ask you anything if it was a word yes sir jesus said whosoever look up upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart and if you present yourself like that you're a cause of it that's exactly though you be innocent in yourself you've presented yourself to that sinner like that when he answers for it you'll be the one to be guilty oh get you some clothes and cover up not like ladies that's right and you man you don't let your wives do a thing like that wear them kind of close don't you have no respect for you or her either one let your wife sit and smoke cigarettes in the house and blow it why do you and then call yourself a christian uh i can't understand that you say why not wait a minute um uh uh by the way i know then that's what i'm talking about see i try if you love the lord with all your heart you say well i just got to smoke them that's my pleasure your pleasure my pleasures in the lord your presence in the lord if you die out to the world god is my joy he is my sacrifice he's my god he's my love he's all and all that i have leader that are needed in christ [Applause] thirsty breaks into a message and speaks like that there must be something important that's going to happen oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen the people said amen i remember if i got the interpretation right we are to warn the people see the coming of the lord and that's worn with the right kind of a life behind it because you can't talk to man living anyway and then go tell him he knows he's living as well as you are see let's get right and get ready because i believe the holy spirit wants us to know these things and to be ready for this great thing that's fixing to happen yes yes sir the hour the world is now falling apart the all systems are falling apart why is it it's got to come that way see is we're looking for a city whose builder and maker is god and all these earthly things has to give away to it now we find out that god promised to supply all of our needs we had need of in this journey is that right but remember he only supplies him on conditions we've got to meet his condition first if we do not meet his condition he will not meet our condition we've got to do the thing that's right first got to go down to the bottom and build up that's exactly we can't start at the top and come down we got to go to the bottom and build up go back to the bottom now he'll meet our condition all of his promises our own condition but we try to reverse this by our traditions we try to make god something else we are going to inject our tradition it says just a little better or that's the way the people try to fake it now i'm not just speaking to this church right here this group of people i'm speaking of to the world it's being taped here and go all around the world what we say we want our wants supplied but he supplies our needs that's a different we want our wants and he gives us our needs but he knows what we have need of and we would most surely the world would today accept it if it come according to our tradition oh the baptist would like to say it's according to what we believe this to see you were all wrong the message saying now you've done this wrong it's going to want it come the way we believed it but i imagine it'll come different from what any of us think about it that's right it's going to come the way god is our danger to come and it's just not in man to be able to cut this thing out and say it's that way now would you we wonder today what's why the gifts and things are not in the church operating the way they should be while the gifts are put into church to separate and take sin out to keep the church clean it's a it's god's uh uh toxin that's given to the church it's god's also his disinfect that he puts into the church to kill out all the parasites that it tears the church and and uh it's god springs his church over with his word and that keeps all the termites out you know so the church can grow the plant and god knows what it takes to do it well you say it's just like a little baby crying for your razor when you were shaving and you little babies told her give me that razor daddy give me that razor your little son two three years old just screaming jumping up and down the floor give the razor you know better to do that or you wouldn't give that baby that razor he doesn't know how to handle it that's the reason we don't find them or divine gifts and what we do they push off on some kind of tradition over some denomination they don't know how to handle it god knows what to do or you might say the little boy might say to you you refusing to raise and say i see you hand on the daddy but see you're older you know what to do with it that's the way when the church becomes from a little baby toddling around to a real virtue of sons and daughters of god then things are going to be different yes sir the church already acts in the sons and daughters when we already be teachers we have to be taught reminds me of my colored friends here tonight my brothers and sisters will excuse this expression years ago down the south he used to sell uh people when the slavery was going on down in the south and they took those poor people and would take them out and auction them off like some kind of a used cloth you have a bill of sales a human life it never was god's will to have no manual over another man god made man and man made slaves we're all off the same tree one can give the other blood transfusions whether we're yellow black brown red or whatever we are we're all adam's race the country we lived into it changed our colors has nothing to do with it not at all jesus died to save the sinner no matter who it was and it used to be a broker's team combined would buy them people just like you'd buy a car come by and buy so many used cars take it sell it somewhere else and come with the plantations and find these poor people out there and look around and find out which one was good workers and big strong men and women and they would sell them take the big strong man and breed them to big strong women like you would cattle or something to get a bigger head is slave i wonder what he'll be full of that kind that a thing like that and here there was a little mother with her babies trying her husband auctioned off it was terrible then the first thing you know these one broker came by a plantation it was told one day and he was looking over the slaves he said how many you got said oh we got about 200 out there and so uh he watched me the people were sad they were away from their home their loved ones they were brought from africa here and brought in by the borders and seoul down here in the south and um they they know they never go back home they they were finished they never get to go back and they were sad you know they couldn't make them work harder they did they'd have to whip them and everything else to make them work because they know they'd never get back home their daddy was over there maybe mother here and daddy over there and maybe the children here and their father somewhere oh it's terrible and one day this broker came by and looked into this bunch of slaves and he noticed there's one of those young slaves out there that they didn't have to whip him yeah he's chest out he walked around he was right on the spot and the broker said say i want about that one the owner said but he's not for sale so why so i keep him he said he must be the boss or the rest of him and said no he ain't the boss or said maybe you feed him better said no they all eat out there in the galley together he said well what makes him so much different from the rest of the slaves he said i often wanted that myself to one day i found out that over in a homeland where he come from his father is a king of the tribe and though he's a native he still knows he's a king son he conducts himself like one oh if we are the sons and daughters of the king the king of pain let's uh conduct our characters christians yes we are aliens we're pilgrims and we're strangers here this is not our world we are seeking a kingdom that is to come this is not our home though we be tossed about and made fun of by the world and call this that neither an old fashioned and all like that why do you care you don't want to be a pattern yourself after a some kind of a movie star or some television star or something you're a daughter of [Music] that we're god sons and daughters of the king our character reflects his presence there are buildings over there his partners are full he has riches untold we're the children of the king with jesus our savior i'm a child of the king let's conduct ourselves like our father going someday we will go home to be with him yes yes they they want a messiah but they want it under their own conditions yeah they want a savior they didn't want it now the same way for the same reason for the denominations and politics has taken the place of the holy spirit the ministers instead of being too many of them are led by the religious politics instead of letting the holy spirit lead them see some church will give them a little better offering or something other way they go to get a feather and a head or something like that but that's too bad lord be led by the holy spirit god sent the real leader of the church and that's the holy ghost our educational system in our churches has led us far away from the presence of god it's too bad that we put our boys i'm talking to pentecostals now how into the seminaries and things hatch them out like ecuador chickens that's right always felt sorry for an incubator chicken it was uh wasn't a hatch right he chirps me ain't got no money to go to just turned out about a big machine or a regime that's why they seem to be turning out preachers today with some kind of doctor's degree and send him into a church and sometimes he knows more about god than a hot and talk will know about an egyptian knight all we need is a good old-fashioned the holy ghost back into the church again of cleaning out gun barrel straight sky blue religion we need a cleaning out and starting over again that's the truth church i'm not beside myself i may be mad as i said last night but i feel good this way i never did feel this way the other way so i i just like to stay this way yes sir i did lose my mind i had you to find the mind of christ every other believer the educational system has taken this away i live in a college town where the university of arizona is there and i was saying thinking this what can science do for you they could take something and say this was so many hundred years ago now they found out it wasn't so many hundred years ago they haven't got one thing yet scientifically proven that the world has ever had any life on any more than 6 000 years they pick up bones and they used to take different measurements and say i was now they wouldn't confess it a big professor and i stood up there in arizona and said they won't profess it no but they found out that the age of the bone has been because of the chloride itself in the water and also the salt turned it like at an agent it absolutely wasn't time to done it hey man god's word still worry me yesterday brother they could never be able to disprove it that's the thing that'll hold the world together not an educational system anything that you adopt instead that is an antichrist movement it's exactly right it's against the principles of christ back to the word christ is the word the word made flesh and dwell among us education can never give us life education can never science can't give us life the world can't give us life the church can't give us life theology can't give us life there's only one thing to give you life that's christ he is life he is some time ago in a city in canada i was going up on an elevator and there was a having a bunch of americans up there and it was it was some kind of a meeting i won't call the name of it because there might be someone in a certain lodge in here and i wouldn't hurt your feelings but there was going up on the the uh the elevator in a big hotel and i was having a meeting there and uh you couldn't get on the elevator harley for the whiskey bottles and things and i said to the uh to the elevator so what's all this he said the americans has visited us tonight many of them now went down it's got off the of the stage or the little escalator elevator rather it started out as a hall there was two young women standing down there with just their underneath garmadon they had a bottle of whiskey in their hand and they were drinking and they started down and drunk man coming out of the house so drunk or the little rooms trying to catch them and pulling their clothes down and it was horrible looking and they come down and i just dug back in a little hall and waited until they passed by a little door and they stopped in front of me and nice looking women and they were standing there just with their little underneath skirt on all the clothes they had they took this bottle and tried to pour it on one another one pulled up or underneath garment as high as she could pull it through her leg up in the air whoopee this is life i couldn't stand the war of it i stepped out i said sister i beg your pardon that's death that's death she said i'm have a dream and i said wait just a minute i said you said that was life i said that's for very life why do you try to do a thing like that come to find out i said i am a minister of the gospel i'm an american too now i'm ashamed of you i'm ashamed of you to call yourself an american and up here like that come to find out one of them was a sunday school teacher and she started crying first she started running i grabbed both of the hands to drink they couldn't get away i said wait we're gonna pray right here that is the way it seems right well they say they're just having a little clean fun a little clean fun nothing that thing doesn't i don't care how much sunday school teacher you are if that thing's in your heart god can't dwell in that unclean place what we need is an old christian whole industry behind going to sweep the church from one end to the other yes sir we don't do that that should not be permitted but it's americans having a little clean fund set an example as a christian nation whole my educational system that isn't life that's death what makes a person do that why do they do it what makes the world do the way they do because they reject this there's some little place in a man's heart to thirst for god a little place a man has made the thirst you're set up like that that's what makes you drink that's what makes you do these things is because there's something in you that craves for satisfaction thirsting and god forbid that a man will try to satisfy and crush that holy cow of god with the substitute that the devil would give him you have no right to do that that's god calling to you that stuff is a thirst of death and if you won't take christ in there to fill it up the devil will give you a substitute of death in it so right you have no right to do that how dare any man or woman to hush that holy calling out of god calling and because you won't receive it then the devil will see it satisfied with something else that's what satisfies it god's word i've hid in my heart not a sin not against him that's right god in the heart is what settles the question yes sir science can't give you life education can't give you life denomination can't give you life schools can't give you life nation can't give you life church can't give you life it's only god to give you life he's the only one that can do it now we see in chapter that what the prophet said would come to pass in this day the prophet paul and ii timothy 3 we find out that the time was coming when the church would be heady high-minded overall high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of god truce breakers false accusers incontinent and despisers of those that are good you say that's communists not all let's profess christians listen read the next verse having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from [Applause] the power of the resurrection denying that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever right he is the same yesterday and forever peter said on the day of pentecost the promise isn't to you and to your children and to them it's far off even as many as the lord our god shall call that's what the holy ghost for as long as god still calls the holy ghost is still here to fill every hungry heart that god called but we substitute something else we try to satisfy that feeling by joining church you just deaden that feeling by doing that you ain't satisfied with that that won't satisfy there's only one thing you'll satisfy that's when christ comes into a man's life because he's made in the image of god and he's made in the statue of god and god didn't give you this trip here on earth to be this side of the other but be a son and daughter of god and there's nothing else to satisfy that's the only thing we'll hold our our world together and take not our man-made economy but take god's economy and his way of doing it through his word that'll hold it together that's a pile that binds our hearts and christian love the fellowship of kindred mind is back to that above that's right what the world needs today the good old times saint paul's revival in the bible holy ghost back again where the spirit of god falls amongst the people and signs and wonders appear like sparks all from an anvil that's where we need it that's what we have to have to hold together then we expect god to meet us in our traditions oh to keep the world from falling apart we expect him to come to our system that's exactly what they thought back there now if the messiah comes in this age we gotta find high priest campuses we got uh lebinsky all these priests along here and see fine man we schooled him schooled and they know what they're talking about but when he come he bypassed every one of us he didn't even touch their system besides that he said you're of your father the devil in his works you do you generation snakes in the grass he said who's wanted you to flee the wrath that is to come what's the word of god come out in that review oh it certainly didn't meet their theological test and it wouldn't today either it doesn't when they see him standing and perform the son of the prophet to show that he was messiah what do they say he's the elder about that's the evil spirit and jesus said that's blasphemy and when the holy ghost comes and you speak against that it'll never be forgiven in this world the world economy but you see the system today it's the same thing we formed our own system that's the reason our system will never hold this world together they might elect the president or abraham lincoln and every county in the united states and they'll never hold it together until we get back to the word of god back to the old fashioned black back bibles got the truth that's the only way we'll ever know god and keep our world together is back to the principles of jesus christ back to his doctrine back to the holy ghost again leading the church that's why the truth has been so mishandled in this last days is because when the god trying to get his program in and people have already denominated themselves off and such they build up a fence so that the holy spirit can't get in there keeping him out we want god to save us in the the very condition we're in that's the way that i think you pentecostal people what did you start out at did you ever read the zeus street in mission do you ever read before the general counsel ever started the pentecostal people were known because they come out of those denominations that separated that's what they was come out from among them they used to preach that all time be separated saith god get away from them traditions of man and what did he do he turned right back around and went back in the same garm you come out of now you're separated one's a church of god the other into this and that and this that you're separating fussing with one another break that down when i first come in to the ministry i thought everything was pentecostal one group i come to find out this broke up as bad as the baptist the thing i did is stand right in the middle of both of them say we are brothers that's all but as long as you're firing one another satan don't have to fire at you but unless that bound to be broke and spread forth your tents way out the undertaking every brother then i tell the great army of god arise in the power of jesus christ go back to the bible you talk about our church through rights and grief it would come to pass when we can tear down our traditions forget all of our denominational things and come right back on the basis of god's word but we want god to save us in the condition we are we got to meet his condition if we don't we don't meet us on ours upon his we want god to save us in the very thing that uh that if it's polluted let god get back to the word and love one another that's the only thing that i know to do god sends us prophets and when we uh put them to death just exactly like jesus said they would do then we found out after a century or two or 100 years or 50 years god will send us a prophet or a messenger and um first thing you know we'll criticize him putting to death then after a while after his death you know why the church will wake up what do they do they'll say well we'll build a denomination up on that that's what happened to the methodist baptist and all the rest of you build a denomination and the thing is after he's done dead and his message is over we're going to let him go into another place then you go back to his message you're that dead you're trying to go back there and go in his hands too when he is going on right here all the time you forget the hour just like man man's always praising god for what he did do and praise him or what he will do and ignoring what he's doing that's that's just a way of man he's always done that he thinks of what he has done gives him thanks believe he's going to do something like but forget he's doing it all the time right here he always overlooks it that's the devil's business for him to do it that way yes there are traditions yes sir the messiah he says for another generation something like that he was back there he is the same yesterday and forever in his first advent jesus the whole world was corrupted with politics and religions always crying for a messiah they wanted an anointed one israel wanted something and rome wanted something the rest of them it's the same thing today we all each one want a politician we want something today now today russia wants a messiah russia wants a messiah that'll take him to the moon right quick get there before the rest of them will that's what russia wants they want that kind of messiah some genius some fellow that's a that's a that's a scientific genius and he'll know how to conquer outer space and go over there and plant the russian flag before the americans can get there oh they're they want their messiah they're trying their best to raise up on all right what did america what do you want america you're crying the loudest what do you on you've been moving up an educated genius you've been on a political genius you got it [Music] though you had to invent a uh crooked vote mckeen to get it but you got it that's right the world wants that's what it wants now what you're going to do with it you want to show how smart you are you can put them on television to show that one can outsmart the other and you fail for it you want a genius what do you want what do you want to church you want what do you want you're wanting a smart educated intellectual minister to raise up like a conqueror better than billy graham to take them all back to your denomination you've got similarities and things trying to hatch them out you're trying to think that's true but look your action speaks louder you want a religious genius one who can uh lead you your denomination over them all stop out the bad just stomp out the method to stop out the one to stop out the trinity everything walk over all [Applause] that's the kind you want but you know what you need you need a savior just in fact that's what god knows you need as a savior but do they want it no sir that don't beat their fit their ecclesiastical taste it just doesn't work that way with them but the whole world wants their genius now what if russia got their messiah then what about us you know germany got theirs not long ago and many you boys in the first world war remembers that very well see they got it you don't need that kind of a messiah it was in the wrong way it was the wrong thing it was contrary to god's word just think napoleon at the age of 33 he had conquered the world and died in defeat he died in the feet he was a probitious when he first raised up and his great uh success brought him and he died an alcoholic seven thousand prostitutes found his army he died at 33 years old and he tried to conquer the world but he did it the wrong way but jesus christ at the age of 33 had conquered the world death held racism he was the word of god made manifest that's our messiah amen [Music] sure you always we want to we want a messiah but we want it in the way i have to admit some things that god wrote down now we're getting too late we uh we have to admit some of it but the world wants monster messiah the world wants one the church wants one and what have found santa juan if god sent a messiah what would he be he would not be a religious politician [Music] he would not be an intellectual giant as we call it oh no what would he be he'd be like hebrews 13 8 the same that he was he's always been he'd be the word of god he was god's word he is god's word he'll forever be god's word even though the sounding force of his coming was always a prophet see the word came to you hear the word come in fullness and now if they come again today it would be a word of god manifested word of god dedicated word of god god living aloneness that's the messiah he promised it amen you'd be that pillar of fire again you'd be the same aside of that israel [Music] then turn it down like they always did certainly of course they want to build a great nation we want to build a great church body today we are thinking about we want a great general church all right you're going to get it you want a united church you're going to get it you're going to get it why do they want it like that if messiah would come he never said something like that in order he'd be against it sure he would but what do they want it for what's the reason he has to come that way they want one man that can stand up and dictate the whole thing you're going to get it the doctor you will receive him because he's coming another will come and you will receive him jesus said and they will they will receive him why do they want to do that people are lying to things their own way the messiah would come he just shut the feathers off of you hallelujah talk about some preachers skinning down women and man he would really skin him down he did what he come he said you generation of pipers you snitched to the grass you're you're a pile of the devil if that messiah would return to this fluted time you'd do the same thing again god wouldn't vindicate his work just like you did in the beginning with the same kind of signs and wonder you certainly would do it if he returned again if we got that messiah just like he wasn't the first time because it couldn't be nothing else the bible said he's the same yesterday today and forever he's always the word but what do we want we wouldn't want that kind of messiah no no we want to be something like the world what the people are trying to do they want a messiah that'll let them live and and do anything they want to and act like the world and live in the world and still hold that christian profession [Music] you can't do that if you love the world or the things of the world the love of god's writing in you jesus yes sir but that's kind of messiah the world wants that's reason won't receive god's himself it won't do it this is his messiah exactly his word is his messiah that messiah in you does the works that the word says it does it reproduces christ because christ is in you his life is in you and it does just exactly what he's supposed to do like he always did same way he did at the same things that he did because he is the same that's the messiah that god said the of the world wants to just let them do anything they want to get by oh that's all right oh these women across the country these you wanted you you want your french dressing and all the big things you got it you've got a modern ahab and jezebel and it's basically the church that's right i'm not taught in politics i'm talking truth and you know this nation is just exactly like israel they've done the same thing israel come in and drove the occupants out of that nation and tuck it god gave it to him and what did he do they drove out the occupants of the nation and took him first they had great kings like david and solomon and after all there raised up a man called jessie or ahab and he married jezebel and she was one of these little painted face flappers and when he did she was the one controlling she told him what to do he might have been the head but she was the neck and she told him what to do if this nation hasn't done the very same thing the same thing we come in here and drove out the indians we had a washington and a lincoln before we got today with our own voting and politics and things we set the system that we run from and made a nation out of here we brought it right back in here because it's the desire of the people i'm neither democrat or republican i'm a christian the whole thing is polluted i cast my vote on jesus christ amen [Music] yes sir friends we're not a promise a system jesus wasn't having to do with the system we wasn't promised the system we were promised what was we promised a kingdom [Music] how do you get into it by one's spirit we're all baptized it's the kingdom of god a kingdom of eternal life with an eternal king getting forth these eternal words with an eternal peace against

resurrected in the kingdom of god the faithful god is abused all these man-made systems must follow not once more shake the world but i'll shake hands and those things that cannot be shook is what will remain and we receive a kingdom that's the kingdom of god not a system not a political will not a denomination but a kingdom is dead to the systems of this world its subjects are dead to these organizations this is down to these political systems and it's a lot of been resurrected by the power of the kingdom and now we're in a kingdom sitting in heavenly places with the eternal king

kingdom of god has come and we're setting with the messiah god's messiah why do you say that so messiah what is it brother man the bible said the word of god is more powerful than any kingdom sharper than a two-edged sword it's a desire of the falsehood hallelujah we receive a kingdom that cannot be moved do you believe it will you accept the kingdom holy then let's stand on our feet and just praise him with all your heart what did jesus say we praise you all great king lord we receive a penis that cannot be your people are you healed [Applause] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] i was i checked online some service that a brother had a large church and everybody every one in the congregation i think had a mask on but he didn't of course he was further away from them standing in the pulpit ministering the word so praise the lord thank god for his word amen and again this world is falling apart it's been falling apart for quite a while in all the inventions of man in the in the century that we're living in but we give god the glory for giving us the revelation of the messiah the revealed word amen he was the revealed word two thousand years ago he used to reveal the word now and he's been he's been the word revealing himself through the prophets to israel and and he continues to be the word the messiah revealing himself through the through the messengers down through the ages amen and up through the ages by the grace of god amen well or whether martin luther did what he did because of the revealed word wesley did what he did it was god in him moving amen moving us on moving us on by the grace of god and as the prophet has said when when that brother asked me if the prophet said anything about the salvation army and so on and i thought for sure he would know that because he was he was many years older than i was at the time and we know as the brother branham did say the prophet said he said that the methodists ordained not ordained but organized and became denominational so quickly after wesley passed on that he said that god raised up william booth with red hot salvation and it was back in that day it was red hot salvation brother because amen what we were did they doing they were getting closer to the pentecostal revival and the prophet said that's why god raised them all he sort of bridged the gap between the methodists and the pentecostal it was on its way but just to take the people on he raised up william booth and it was oms tremendous and you know i was thinking as he was ministering there and it came to my my heart my mind and concerning the the methodist church we understood it to be the united church and i remember sister burns testimony and she's of course we remember sister burns as being a resident of gamble and but sister burns when she was a young she was i'm not sure she was born in gamble or not but because that her i believe when maybe her mother died when she was very young and she was she was transferred from gamble to a a town in northeast newfoundland upon the upon the that part of newfoundland there and of course that's where brother barnes was living at the time and sister barnes was explained now that even as a just a young young girl she went to the united church or the methodist church and she said brother i remember she said you know the singing and worshiping and she said the power was so great in the church everybody was experiencing it and back then they had those those lights those lamps they were lamps that you would like not not electric but they were light and they're hung on from the ceiling and i remember those lamps even in the salvation army it was a long time ago amen that i remember that and sister barnes said as we worshiped and we praised the lord oh my she did look up and and those lamps were they were going back and forth back and forth he should just go nothing nothing standing still she said not even the lights no she said the power when the anointing was so great i said it was back in in that church oh yes she said you know of course it's not like that now not not not like that in very many many churches for sure so we thank god that god was moving er on god was moving us on and so on so where are we going now they left to left one to go into another into another another revival that god was having but but now it's over with amen and we we entered in by grace through the revealed word of a prophet in this hour we entered in amen to the bride revival and the bride revival is going to take us on to resurrection and rapture that's the end it's finished there's nowhere else to go the lutheran revival took them on to justification the methodist on to sanctification and the salvation army is the same thing pointing to the baptism of the holy ghost and the gifts of the spirit amen so he moved the world onto that and now he's moving the bride onto the resurrection rapture this is finished it's over with we come to the end so what what is the last thing that god would want to do now when we consider what god has done in the in in in israel and through the prophets and so on it went on and on and on till it to the till the god prophet came on the scene the messiah prophet came on the scene amen and did what he did for the jews but they turned it down and they they wouldn't accept it but again god god allowed it why because he wanted to go from the jews to the gentiles and when he's finished with us he goes back to israel goes back to the jews and we know that's what's going on there's a lot going on right now brother sister concerning prophecy end time prophecy so i pray grace by the grace of god we're not ignoring you know what god has done what god is doing amen and we know what god is doing is going to move us on to what he what he wants to do amen by the grace of god so i pray the lord that by grace that we're going to keep moving walking living by faith amen let faith that god gives the faith that pleases god let that motivate our worship amen and our hunger and thirst for the things of god by the grace of god amen there's just a few scriptures here and it says let's see and then said then stood up phineas and executed judgment and so the plague was stayed and that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations forevermore amen amazing why they were they were walking in the light of the word they were going according to what god wanted to do amen and they angered him also at the waters of strife so that it went ill with moses for their sakes because they provoked his spirit so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips and god judged israel for for doing that yeah they were they were pro they were provoking moses to do this provoking moses to do that amen most they paid for it but moses had to pay for it too amen so they did not destroy the nations concerning whom the lord commanded them yeah they wouldn't do what god wanted to do but were mingled among the heathen and learned their works and they served their idols which were a snare unto them yea they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils and shed innocent blood even in the blood of their sons and their daughters whom they sacrificed unto idols of canaan and the land was polluted with blood thus were they defiled with their own works and went a whoring with their own inventions amen and it says therefore was the wrath of the lord kindled against his people insomuch that he aborted his own inheritance and he gave them unto into the hand of the heathen and they that aided them ruled over them and that's what's already coming to pass in the world amen the christian nation coming more and more under the control of of the healing world god help us and they gave them into the hand of the heathen and they hated them they that aided them rule over them and their enemies also oppressed them and they were brought into subjection under their hand many times did he deliver them but they provoked him with their counsel and were brought low for their iniquity nevertheless he regarded their affliction when he heard their cry and he remembered for them his covenant and repented according to the multitude of his mercies i wanted to highlight some of those thoughts regarding repentance because this somebody uh showed me the scripture after the last service i believe or before that concerning god repenting god repenting god did this and repented god did that repent he said god repented yeah he did but we want to show you what what it means when god repented what it means when we repent amen because they were wondering if it's the same kind of repentance no now amen and again it says and he gave them into the hand of the heathen and they hated them ru and they that aided them rule over them and their enemies also oppressed them and they were brought into the subjection under their hand and many times did he deliver them but they provoked him with their counsel and were brought low for their iniquity nevertheless he regarded their reflection when he heard their cry and he remembered for them his covenant and repented according to the multitude of his mercies amen he made them also to be pitied of all those that carry them captives save us o lord our god and gather us from among the heathen to give thanks unto thy holy name and to triumph in thy praise blessed be the lord god of israel from everlasting to everlasting and let all the people say amen praise ye the lord amen psalms 106. it's the long psalms 48 verses amen but there's a blessing in it so thank the lord again for his word and trust him by grace that will go forth with revelation amen of what god is doing amen but brother he's allowing it we're here he's allowing it to get us to look up he's allowing this to happen that to happen to stir us in our hearts and look up because why we got to want to go as he said he israel had to want to get out that's right of egypt and he said i've heard the cry of my people and he said come down to deliver them amen so it had the same with the bride you want to go so he's come down that's what brings god on the scene he's responding to to us amen and to our cry and our hunger and our thirst to god be the glory amen again the world is falling apart now what what testimony is it to us the evidence that the world is falling apart by the grace of god it's evidence that there is there is a people there calling for the rapture of the resurrection amen amen and why are we calling for the rapture in the resurrection because of what we're seeing out there what god has done and what's going on in the world amen what god has done the prophet by the grace of god amen we know it's the the end time we know it's the revelation of the mystery of god and so on but we know at the same time that's grace for the bride but they are a judgment for the world so i pray grace in the name of jesus oh my what a sermon what an anointing was i'm the prophet back then amen but that that was that was moving away more and more and more it was in 1963 july and it was after the opening of the word the mystery of god and we know that the problem of god when when he as he began to minister in 63 he was getting closer november the 15th not july it's november 1963 amen and as i've mentioned before let me say it again that after the after they opened the seals and the prophet went on and ministered and ministered and ministered unto finally in december 1963 he said here i go he said back into evangelism amen so he had far as he was concerned that the purpose of his ministry was fulfilled it was he had that first pull he had that second pull and then god gave them the revelation that the opening of the word the third poem it was finished oh yeah and he felt that the anointing was moving away moving away moving away amen and as he ministered on until finally in 1965 i believe he said he said oh my everything is a dead thump now he said the revival is over yeah so he had gone back into evangelism and he ministered and ministered and ministered and thank god for the anointing with him there tonight one time that was that was in in in revivals like the old-fashioned salvation army that was common the old-fashioned pentecost that was common oh yeah and the early days of the message that was common to worship the way that people were worshiping responding to the word the way they responded to the word amen but now it's getting less and less and less shall the grace that why because the bride is getting less so the grace of god be with us to follow his leadership amen lesson 463 amen i am coming to jesus for rest rest such as the purified no my soul is a thirst to be blessed no i'm sorry not that one i don't know if it's in your book there in the sweet by and by. in the street by him by amen they're okay there's a land that is fairer than day and by faith we can see it afar for the father waits over the way to prepare us a
