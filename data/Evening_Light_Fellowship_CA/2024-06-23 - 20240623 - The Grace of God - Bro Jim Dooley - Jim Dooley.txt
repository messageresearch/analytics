have sister Leah sister Bev with us as well this morning God bless you amen we want want to welcome brother Jim duly here and some of us have known brother Jim for quite a while some of you more than I have but uh you I was sinking this morning we have a what they call in the old times a grizzled veteran here this morning you know you know I'm 44 and I preach things and I preach them by Revelation but not always by experience but when you get someone like brother Jim up here he's preaching it by experience he's had a a long road he's had many trials and he's faced many things and he's come through and he's got a real character about him that no matter where he goes people know he's a man of God and I'll say this and I'm not one to butter people up but you know the way the reason why I trust brother Jim is that he never talks about himself and he never tells you what he's doing for the Lord he just goes and he does it amen he needs all he needs is for the Lord to show him what to do and he goes and and does it and that's the way every believer ought to be you know we don't need to toot our own Hornen we just go do it and if the Lord wants to give us recognition for it he'll do it so we certainly want to Reon welcome him this morning and brother Jim if you've known brother Gerald then you know they can sit a long while so take your time this morning amen and just we're going to settle back and we're going to listen to an experienced veteran this morning just bring the word of God I'm certainly thankful to take a bit of a break it's been you know it's it's a it's a long slog every week and it's good to sit back and and have the Lord just use somebody else so let's let's not just welcome brother Jim but let's say Lord will you come and will you speak our way this morning amen amen let's sing that song I love him I love him I love him I love him because he first love me and and purchase my Sal on [Laughter] [Music] calary tree I love him I love of [Music] him love [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen go ahead and have your seat for a moment and uh want to greet you all this morning you hear me okay yeah can you hear me okay praise the Lord we're on Amen well the sister that sang that a little special there I thought that was so sweet amen when Jesus comes the tempter's power is broken you don't know how it feels you know or I should say you should know how it feels to know when he comes the tears are wiped away he takes the Gloom and fills the life with gladness when Jesus comes amen so he said in his word wherever two or three are gathered together in my name there I am in the midst that should get us excited I mean if nothing else happens here this morning brothers and sisters that alone should get us excited where two or three are gathered together in my name living off the fruit of the Divine amen have their branches out bearing fruit amen what a wonderful experience to be a saved son or daughter of God Amen veterans in the back there brother jural and sister Betty come forward a little bit you've got some not so old young people some older people you know I tell you wore out few pairs of shoes amen he brother Mark brother Bob you know brother Dale God bless you amen and uh but we walk to walk we talk to talk we walk to Walk amen and that's what the Lord's called us to do and uh now I was thinking about brother Jonathan there so I'm going to give back what he gave me there now so uh sister God bless you another faithful Soldier you see these soldiers they're just standing amen they're just here every time every day that their service is on they're here doing there brother with the song service there putting their little lick of fire amen and uh we're just thankful to be here this morning we're going to turn over to uh Peter second Peter pardon me first Peter we just stand for the reading of his word we just read a little bit I've got quite a bit of scripture whether I get to it or not I don't know but uh I hope to get through some of it there verse one let's just stand we're all stand the elders which are among you I exhort who also am an elder and a witness of the suffering of Christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed feed the flock of God which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not for filthy lucer but off a ready mind neither is being Lords over God's Heritage but being examples to the flock and when the chief Shepherd shall appear ye shall receive a Crown of Glory that faded not away likewise ye younger submit yourself unto the Elder ye yay all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resisted the proud and he giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your care upon him for he carth for you be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion WTH about seeking whom he may devour whom resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world but the God of all Grace who had called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus after ye have suffered a while make you perfect established strengthen settle you excuse me to him be glory and Dominion forever amen let's just bow our heads for just a quick prayer our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we so counted a privilege to stand before your redeemed this morning Lord you came by each one's way at one time lord lord when when when we were lost out there in sin dead in trespasses and sin Lord you Quicken Us Together by your Holy Spirit Lord Jesus you came by our way Lord you washed us Lord you set your Holy Spirit Upon Us Lord you were the one Lord that put us in service Lord Lord you were the one that watched over us all these years Lord and my Lord we thank you this morning Lord how you are so grateful how you so great Lord and and faithful Lord Jesus that you would be amongst us this day Lord we thank you Lord for the revelation of your word Lord we thank you for the message of the hour Lord Lord we thank you for a prophet of God who could get out of the way Lord and let you speak to him so many times over and over and over lord Lord we thank you this morning Lord we we thank you for your word Lord which is our absolute this morning Lord we depend on you to come by our way now Lord Quicken each one Lord to whatever each one's need is this morning oh God lord may you Quicken that need Lord Lord may you tell each one oh God that you are a very present help in time of need Lord you are the same yesterday today and forever Lord Jesus Lord we counted the Privileges this morning Lord just to lay aside step aside ourselves Lord just to read your word Lord speak a few thoughts Lord and Lord May these thoughts be your thoughts Lord Jesus Lord because we have the mind of Christ Lord Lord we have that unction from you Lord Jesus to speak whatever you would put on our hearts Lord Lord we thank you this morning we love you and appreciate you now in the name of Jesus Christ Our Lord amen amen we'll just turn over to you can be seated we're just going to turn over to uh second Peter 1 do you have do you have that slide there sister that the pyramid slide yeah there you go I like that slide in verse 5 it says chapter 1 it says besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be baren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ amen but he that lack at these things is blind and cannot see a far off and had forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if ye if you do these things ye shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present through truth yeah I think it meet as long as I I'm in this Tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance knowing that shortly I must come to I must put off this my Tabernacle even as our lord Jesus had showed me amen praise God Amen so I was saying there before we before I my 76 year old brain got away on me there for a second you know I was saying I was going to give back to brother Jonathan so I think brother Jonathan he he's full of the Holy Ghost and power and also I also think he's a well oiled oiled uh machine you know preaching machine right so you got the well oiled machine and now you I'm I'm the old rusty one here this morning so right but that's all right you know we all we all do what God we just don't want to I don't want to do what brother Jonathan does or to be brother Jonathan I want to be brother Jim right so you know whatever the Lord lays on my heart for you this morning you know you take that into your heart your bosom you know and let the word of God reflect that light it may only be a sentence might be a paragraph that I read from one of the message books here you know but take that into your heart and that'll cause you to grow into that stature that we see on the wall there you know that'll add a little bit of Faith a little bit of virtue a a little bit of uh love and so on Temperance any of those things that we just read there you know so I think I think it's wonderful that we have the opportunity in a day brothers and sisters where we have more religion more religiosity in the world today than we ever have more churches more everybody trying to do their thing and to uh trying to get souls saved in their way you know but we know that outside the message of the hour there is no Redemption for this world there is none Revelations 18:4 says brother brandham quoted this quite a bit you know join the church ages and the seals and everything else come out of her my people be not partakers of her sins that you receive not of her plagues you know because their plagues have reached on into heaven and judgment are going to get poured out because the blood of the Saints and martyrs and pilgrims and Christians are all found on her doorstep I was thinking about the soul of man so I I um I was into this message a little book little bit it's Souls that are in present now not I'm not going to speak on Souls that are in present now but I just want to lay a few things out brother brandham here in in paragraph 36 he says 35 he says now this Souls now in presence Souls that are now in present verse 36 now the soul of man is not the body of man it's the soul see and the soul is something that's the nature of the spirit and and then when the nature of a man man when he said we are dead the scripture plainly tells us that that's comes from Colossians 3 and 3 we are dead and our lives are head are HID in God through Christ sealed by the Holy Spirit sealed by the Holy Spirit and I like that sister's song this morning because you know when you're sealed brother say you're sealed Prophet told us you're sealed to you to your destination there nothing can temper with that seal the world is sealed out leot is sealed out religion is sealed out the word is sealed in and it's sealed in you amen the word is sealed in you now think about that the word being sealed in you the word being sealed in me you know Jesus said I come that you might have life life and that you might have it more abundantly Abundant Life right and that that song the sister sang there I just I just love that song at the first time I heard I heard it but I love that and and and I see a sister's heart and I thank God for that heart amen now he says it wasn't that your body died it wasn't it wasn't that your body died it wasn't that your spirit died it was the nature of your spirit died see the nature which is the soul the nature of your soul is of God is God see the nature of your soul is God and if you're born again if it's if it's not it's off the world so the nature of your soul is God if you're born again if it's not it's off the world anything that begins has an end so therefore the only way that you can have eternal life is to have a life that never did begin right so we have to we have to think about that we have to think about that life that we thought well in 2026 it'll be 50 years of for me serving the lord But A J's I think he's my age pretty close 76 right is it sister Betty 76 yeah so we're pretty close to the same vintage there right but he's been I read your little thing there 43 years ministering the gospel taking out the message delivering it having that website up there since 91 is it 91 somewhere in that area right but God looks at that God looks at that you got a big church here you know and you got a small amount of people that doesn't have any bearing on anything right we used to have Fellowship in my home in the Yukon and just a newborn Christian a few years old you know and uh so our first meetings were was in our living room so we had myself well my wife first cuz she was saved before me we had the pastor and his wife who who became the pastor after his wife and then then the pastor's wife was my wife wife's cousin so those three and yet I was unsaved right then I got saved so I walked from down the street and I walked home I put my beer down I put my pool stick down and I said to my buddy there that was at the at we were at his house in the basement plane pool I said that's it Barry I'm done you know Jesus told Paul Paul it's hard for you to kick against the Pricks it's hard Paul not only killed Steven he killed many people there was many Believers that Paul gave consent out there you know but there had to be some conviction and and some uh uh something happening with the Holy Spirit dealing with Paul at that time that was bringing him to notice these things you know and convicting him you know why he's putting these people to death why he's doing all that you know and and in our house and I was being convicted because these people were after me to they said you got to get saved man you got to get saved right my buddy then at the time you know he became a Christian and and I I don't want anything to do with that I didn't want anything to do with it that's the truth and uh but you know the conviction of God settled down on me that one time that one time and and I end up coming home I walked into my home Friday evening and my wife is on her knees the the future pastor of the church there he's on his knees his wife is on her knees and they are praying for my salvation just like that but it was that time the Lord said you know when when he took Paul on the road to Damascus you know he'd seen all the stuff that's went on in Paul's life you know persecuting the Christians and all that you know the brother Brown said you can't sit on the fence you can't sit on the fence you're either a Christian or you're not a Christian right you're either going to one day have the Seal of God or you're going to end up with the mark of the beast that's the that's the short and tall of it you know the long and short of it and so I I just had this thought come into my mind there about the church here you know the church grew in White Horse and we were on out of space in the living room so I had a full basement and the one side of the basement half of the house was empty it was just a place for the kids to play hockey and uh so we fixed it up we built a baptismal tank put a bunch of chairs down there put a Pulpit down there did all that and so then we filled it up with people we're we're just in our house in the neighborhood my neighborhood on this side my neighbor on this side he was a a dentist my neighbor on that side was the uh Immigration Man his wife Kay she was our neighbor used to come and talk to my wife and stuff so whenever we preach Wednesdays Sundays summertime our windows are open and everybody in the neighborhood the street on that side and the Neighbors at that side that side the whole works they all knew what was going on you know and we would have the First Nations people that would come in and and uh cuz Ed's Ministry was to the First Nations people in the beginning and uh you would go go down in the village and have have uh have meetings there and then then uh they would come into our house and back in the day it was uh wasn't uh that cool I guess to to have the different type of people in your house and whatnot but we had everybody in our house we not only fed them the the the gospel but we fed their tummies and sent them on their way every time and they come back and one old sister she would come back she'd have two or three more with her and every time come back she'd have two or three more there she she could fill the church herself you know so she was that little sister little Maggie and uh and it was just wonderful then we outgrew the the uh we had 50 or some odd people in the basement then we outgrew that well we were talking about it and we should buy a church and so on you know should we do that we're just a little fledgling group there wasn't a whole lot of cash going around and uh so this little uh Pentecostal Church came up for sale kind of like the little one you had and uh so the real estate guy come by and he says you guys want to buy that church church so we went down and looked at it it had a it had a parsonage behind it you know one of this old type Pentecostal they had everything in there it was all all self-sufficient and uh so I I walked out of the apartment there and I walked out to the pulpit area and boy I saw all these people just at that moment I saw all these people people sitting in in the church there it was sort of a vision type thing right and I said Lord you know is this is this what we're supposed to do you know so we ended up buying the church there on Black Street and we ended up filling up that church so you know if you make a step God Will Make A step Bible says that God added to the church daily right in Pentecost the first day there was 3,000 or 4,000 then 5,000 you know as many as the Lord Our God shall call in some cities God had many had many people he told Paul he said I have many people in this city you go preach over there right I have many people maybe he hasn't got so many people in St John's that would sit and listen to a guy like me blabon you know or that don't have a feeling for the word because the word is what the attraction is right the word you know if you're attracted to the world if you're attracted to the world well you're going to go in that direction but if you're attracted to the word the pure word of God then you're going to go in a different direction amen you're going to grow into that stature of a perfect man you know when we I'm just bbing a little bit here so please forgive me but uh I I was a Catholic and I came out of Catholicism most of you know all this stuff about me and I wasn't a good Catholic either just a Catholic so you know I was the type of Catholic that well Saturday you got to go to confession because after confession you're going to the bar so something happens well be you go crash your car up then you're okay right CU you went to confession that's all we knew brother Bob you know that's all we knew back then in Newland when we lived out there in Sweet Bay so uh you know it it's uh when God comes and and and changes our lives around you know it it makes an enormous difference when he comes when Jesus comes right because there there was no there was no withdrawals from alcohol zero there was no withdrawals from smoking or anything like that zero because God took it away he replaced it right he replaced it see the nature of your soul is is God if you're born again if it's not it's off the world anything that begins has an end I read all that and then you're life did begin when you were born when God excuse me breathe the breath of life into your nostrils and you become a living Soul excuse me that nature that was in You by Nature you was off the world alienated from God you are actually animal that's exactly right anyone knows that we are mammal how many knows that we are mammal we are warm-blooded animal but that is what we are by our Earthly creation but you see what made us different from other mammals that God put a soul in US amen that's what he's working on now the other mammal don't have to wear clothes no other animal has to wear clothes to hide his shame but us we're the only ones that does because we have a soul but see God in the beginning knew what a man would be like and he created the Earth and he brought up all kinds of animals from the very lowest to the highest and the highest animal come forth was man and then first man was then and then the first man was made he was a spiritual man in the image of God which God is a spirit St John 4 he is a spirit and they that worship Him worship Him in in spirit and in truth and thy word is the truth now we worship Him in spirit and in truth he is the spirit being see so there was no man to till the soil at this time and then God formed Man Out of the Dust of the earth then he taken from his side a byproduct a rib a rib and from that separated this man which had a dual nature which was both feminist and masculine and he taken the feminist out cuz it was love that's the ladies and he placed it into the person called Eve and Adam called Eve which was his wife that's where his love natural felio love held to his wife that's the way a man should be today and her back to her husband say theand the masculine the woman the femin amen so the world wants to mess that up the world has messed that up right big time Big Time but the Bible tells you and I we are not off the world we are in the world but we're not off the world we are in Christ we're separated from that you know and we can have our opinions and what we're going to do you know but the Bible says slow to speak Swift to hear slow to WRA right amen don't worry about that you know you worry about your little families we worry about our churches and so on but far as changing what that's going on out there we live in Satan's Eden Brothers and Sisters we live in Satan's Eden right and it has been Satan's Eden since sin in the Garden of Eden it became from God's Eden into Satan's Eden right and we have to understand that in its fullness Satan's Eden everything that's he offered Jesus you know he said these are mine to give if you'll Bow Down and Worship me if you Bow Down and Worship me taking him up in the high mountain show them all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time these are mine I'll give them to you if you will Bow Down and Worship me he didn't know he was speaking to the word of God he didn't know he was speaking to the spirit of God he didn't know he was speaking to the Holy Ghost he didn't know he says if thou be if thou be the Son of God cast yourself down the angels will catch you right tempting God we have a great we have a great separation in our day you know we've come all the way through the seven Church ages through the seven spirits of God and and the the ministers that he had the messengers that he had for each age and we came to this final age the culmination of everything the end of time right the beginning of the Millennium the Rapture the Millennium the new Earth eternity there's where we're living we're not under that umbrella of Satan's Eden although although we can be we we can be influenced by it we can be influenced by it but our influence should be the word of God and like the sister was singing there this morning if our influence is the word of God and Jesus comes CU he will come he knows not a not a sparrow false from heaven but he knows he knows our needs he knows our monetary condition he knows our health conditions we just believe on him act on him by faith receive from him right we receive from him we receive all the goodness every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line it's all ours we if we can accumulate the faith to believe that God is and that he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek him right little sisters here in the front you know when I grew up when I was your age I don't know how old you but things were much different things were much different much different we didn't have this thing where I come from we didn't have a television we didn't have power we didn't have running water we didn't have indoor toilet we didn't even have insulation in the house when the wind blew and the curtains would blow this way inside halfway across the house you know my mom would bake bread twice a day there was eight of us kids there was mom and dad there's grandmother and grandfather Nolan my mom's parents and my grandmother dly dad's parents lived next door and you know we all had the Eek out of living is what we were doing brother Jonathan we were eing out of living we were little kids we came home from school and our entertainment was my entertainment if it was in the summertime through my book bag in the corner I jump in the boat with my dad and we go lobster fishing we go uh capelan fishing we we go squid jigging we do all those things that was entertainment and a toy we had what we call a hoop and Gater it was around uh what do we call them Mark you never used one of those he's from the city yeah it was just a little that you know the wooden barrels they had staves in them right they were slats you know wooden barrels curved like that and they had the the iron Hoops around them that held it all together and the product inside it uh kept it all in place so we would take the Hoops out and we would get a piece of galvanized wire and we would we would uh it'd be that long so we would double it up bring it back and put a kink on it and then we'd have that hoop which was around and we'd run that around [Music] around that was our toys right but you know today there is so much influence of one type or the other right there's just so much influence you know and influence it influences depending on what influence mostly it'll influence away from God right because through prophecy God told Brother bam because thou H has chosen the narrow way which is my way the narrow way which is my way and that's why we have to think about so much in Satan's Eden you know you know we have to to to separate ourselves we have to be constantly Vigilant like we read in the scripture there we have to be constantly Vigilant you know that we're walking in the light as he is in the light constantly we can't uh we can't we can't go Rogue on that you know we have to constantly cuz your devil Satan the adversary WTH about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour and like I said we live in Satan's Eden Satan's Eden all the denominational churches out there you know they've either get the beginning of the mark of the beast already or they they'll get the fullness of it one of these days right when his little bride goes up we know that Satan comes down right but we look at this picture here and we add to our faith virtue and we add to Virtue knowledge we add to knowledge Temperance we add to Temperance patience and we add to patience godliness and we add to Godliness brotherly kindness and the Holy Spirit loved the Capstone Ministry that that's the that's the place that we live in that is what God has ordained for you and I to have that love brothers and sisters you know Bible says without faith it is impossible to please God you know the little song that sings the love of God is greater far than tongue or pen could ever tell I was going to sing a special before I got started this morning but because I'm 76 was Jal I forget sometimes what I'm going to do and probably good thing that I forget sometimes yeah there was no man to till the soil and then God made man out off the dust of the Earth I read that and then after he made man in his own image created he them male and female there was no man to till the soil and he put him in the dust of the earth therefore he was that man this human man was mammal see he was an animal he was animal but he put the spirit of God in of spirit of God a made life into him and made him on the basis that he could make a choice I think that's wonderful right God before the foundation of the world he had all our names written in the Lamb's Book of Life and he put each one of us under free moral agency God is omniscent he's omnipotent he's omnipresent he's all powerful he's all these things God knows everything God knows everything right so he puts us here under free moral agency free moral agency my brother it wouldn't be just it wouldn't be just brother brandham says it in this book of Le it wouldn't be just that God would send us to this earth and say now brother Mark I'm going to make you this way and I'm going to make you do this I'm going to make you do that I'm going to make you do something else see that's not what he did he put brother Mark on the earth and he gave him a free moral agency to do what God already knew what brother Mark was going to do he knew all that but because you have free moral agency it's your responsibility it's not God towering over you you understand what I mean it's not God towering over you you know it's not Mom and Dad towering over you you know it your free moral agency to do what's right to take the right Road he says we think we're something just remember what are we a cloud of dirt dirt that's all and because thust th art thus thou shall return excuse me so when you see this man walking down the street thinking he is somebody you know and got a little education and things remember it's a cloud of Indiana dust that's all and that woman that's all dressed in shorts and smoking cigarettes and carrying on down the street twisting like she owned the whole country it's a cloud of Indiana and a dust and that's the way it's turning back so you're not very much to begin with see so that's right that's what you are but that Soul this is where that Soul that's in there that Soul that's in there see that soul is what God is working on that soul that nature that little spot now I'm going to vary off a little bit at there brother Jonathan cuz I didn't have a printer and I and I I had some things I wanted to share just this one little message here is United under one head 1958 see and I haven't read all the scripture but that's all right that's all right because uh my topic was sort of Grace it was UNG Grace the grace of God let's see Ephesians 4:7 says but unto every one of us is given Grace according to the measure of the gift of God Ephesians 3:1 talking about Grace again he says for this cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles if you heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me toward you or for you see so I was been in this message for a while and I'm sorry I didn't have the notes Here for it or copied them off and uh I don't want to go back too far because I don't want to read a whole bunch I just move ahead here okay remember that anything that man does that's outside the plan of God remember anything that man does that's outside the plan of God it's perverted it's perverted so listen now no matter how good it looks it's still perverted because God's got his original idea and he gave it to man and man wants to make something of his own self see he wants to have something to do into it man he wants to intrude he wants to add his two censor word to what God has but God don't need our two censor brothers and sisters he took Moses a a great learned man he took him from the pharaoh's Court the best that Moses could do was kill an Egyptian right but God took him out took him to the backside of the desert with a high tempered woman for 40 years he came back out of there Meek and humble so sisters you got to Ministry it keep these boys humble right got to have a little humor see but God Moses left there Moses left there after after 40 years her and sheep and cattle or whatever he left there to come back out and and and and the Bible says that Moses turned aside to see a PHA Moses actually turned aside to see that phenomena the pillar of [Music] fire think about it you know if Moses hadn't turned aside God would never have spoke to him the pedal of fire was there the Bush was burning and and Moses went to see what it was all about better Bram talks about it there in the book you know but Moses never applied any of the things that he had previously learned down in Egypt from Pharaoh he never appi applied any scientific Revelation if you want to call it that way to that but because he turned aside because he showed interest in what was going on in that burning bush God spoke to him said Moses remove the shoes off your feet for the ground you stand on his Holy Ground Holy Ground being that the holy God was there on the ground right and and and and Moses received his commission from God to go and God told him he says I've come down I've heard the cries of my people I've come down to take him out and Moses I'm going to send you so after all his education didn't work after all his in the desert he was coming back after 80 years heading back into Egypt to take God's people out God was doing it it but Moses was one man in the hand of God but random was one man in the hand of God you see that soul is what God is working on see if he can only get that nature that Spirit to agree with him then that nature dies don't you want to agree with God Amen look I can't do nothing you know I can't make one hair white or black so why do I persist in controlling God I should let God control me right I should let the controller have control see the nature and the love of the world dies and the things of the world is dead see because if he loved the world or the things of the world the love of God's Not In You And A man must be born again so this Nature has to Die the one that we were born with the nature don't have to change your body don't have to change anything it's God that changes your nature it's the spirit of God that comes in and changes our nature it says in the nature of God comes in and lives in you and God is the only thing there is that never did begin or never can end so therefore he has partnership partnership you see and taken this man earthy Earthly and this eternal spirit and put it together no man can do that oh boy huh no no man can do that because God reflected himself back in that that he become a man when he become Christ Jesus and he was God see God was in Christ that's see lived in him reconciling the world to himself and through that perfect man each one of us imperfect imperfect we were were each one imperfect that believe in God and has accepted that become the Perfection of him we become we become the Perfection of God he never left talking about the Lord he never left his body to seek corruption nor did he leave his soul in hell but raised him up on the third day and he's alive forever more and we will have a body like his own glorious body that's why we're baptized into his name it's not it's not uh talking to somebody and so I said what do you think about well what do you think about have you given water baptism some thought my brother he says it's not for me right now it's not for me right now he feels he's good person and he is don't get me wrong but it's not for him right now and I don't see many people out there you know when I come to Newland like the families not I'm not talking about the church here I think the families out there uh I don't see too many people that's concerned about God we're not concerned no more brother Gerald not us but the world is not concerned anymore you know brother Brandon preached that message convinced then concerned we got to be convinced right who convinced me that I should put down my pool stick and my bear bottle that was God you know I had nothing to do with that and I'm so glad I had nothing to do with that I'm so glad that I was was God that like I didn't have no repercussions and no uh withdrawals pardon me I don't I didn't have any withdrawals from drinking beer and carousing I was a new man that's the song I was going to sing for you the old man is dead the old man is dead now and then an old friend of mine I've not seen for some time will'll stop by and ask me how you been what's on your mind I tell them I'm serving Jesus now and the old man is dead I used to live such a wicked life had no no hope inside I didn't there was no hope if God didn't come in there's no hope there's no hope out there for the families if God doesn't come by his Divine Holy Spirit and touch someone's life there is no hope I used to live such a wicked life had no hope in sight I was lost in the darkness searching for the light God was searching for me you know he's still searching for man Adam never searched for God God says Adam Where Art Thou where art th Adam can you imagine that day what happened back there can you imagine my when we come to the end can we sing that of course I'm so glad Jesus lifted me going to talk just a moment on Abraham and then we will it's 12:45 so when did I start with John I'm good talking about that baptism that we might come forth in his name in his death in his resurrection that we Rise Again testifying to the world that we have new life sir see now I've walked before my siblings my families all those I've associated with over the last 50 years now 50 years a long time well will'll be 50 years in in 26 50 years is a long time brother you know but but time is nothing in the hand of God that's just couple hours or whatever I don't know I don't know see but people know your manner of life people know where you go where you stand day in day out you're a Christian Christian is Christlike to be a Christ that means Christ Living in you amen Christ is living in us see that's him doing all that that's not you and me that's him he saw you before the foundation of the world he had your names on the Lamb's Book of Life we said that earlier see he's he's just coming back he's just gathering together all his right getting us ready for that Rapture stature of a perfect man praise God I like that you know when we were born natural birth natural birth we had a lot of learning to do right we had a lot of things to do we had to learn how to walk we had to learn how to talk the only thing we didn't have to learn to do was tell a lie we already that was already in us but we we had to learn how to walk we had to learn how to talk we had to learn how to ride our bike we had to learn how to do everything till we become an adult we we learned all those things we got our education some of us and uh all those things it was a growth there was a growth natural growth right so when we come to Christ there's a spiritual growth that takes place in a Christian we don't always be a baby right we don't always be a teenager we become an adult right Paul was talking to one church and he says I have need to to feed you with milk and not with meat because you couldn't you can't handle it right so we grow in Christ we grow in Grace we grow into the stature of a perfect man we grow into the stature of a perfect man you know brother brandham I was reading it there 14 years old his buddy shoots him injures both his legs you know now brother brandom is not my absolute right brother brandham was a prophet of God he was the son of man revealing the son of man right and uh he had a revelation at 14 he he didn't want to go to that place that he went in the vision he didn't want to go back there cuz he says I firmly believe I've been to both places Been to Hell and I've been to the to the place of the redeemed Heavenly places wow you know the only thing that he could offer to the Lord at 14 he says Lord I never did commit adultery I lied did all those things he said but he never did commit adultery and he asked the Lord for another chance because he got into that thing and he was going down down down down down down and there was no stopping there was no stopping going down right bunch of years later he's coming up he's sitting in waiting for his wife in the JC Penny store and he sees these women coming up the escalator and they got the the the big uh bushed up haircut what you call that hair or uh I don't know what they call it you girls wouldn't know about it cuz you're you don't but the way women used to wear their hair was out in BO big head and they had this stuff on their eyes green and all that painted up and when he saw all that he saw what he saw in Hell was was the the the cat that Lo the face that looked like the cat you know he saw all that and he saw saw the depravity of it all and and then they saw it manifested and and he went into shock there at JC Penney basically he went into shock when his wife came and says what happened to you you what's going on they got out of there but now I'm just going to close here right away he says now we notice in this there's many things that happens sometimes and we wonder why they happen and we question ourselves we question others but finally after a while we find out that if we're Christians it all works out just right somehow see it all works out just right we don't have to invent the wheel right see you've seen that all Christians see that we wonder why we did it see and he says I wondered sometimes when I first read the Bible why did God let Abraham Abraham's the father of her faith father of her faith that great man ever stand there and say that Sarah wasn't his wife wow Abraham the father of her faith and how did he let him stand there and lie about that and the things that he did and then how that he ever let Abraham leave the promised land where he told him not to leave see there was a there was a drought or a famine or whatever they went down into guer to get food outside the promised land see he says why did and how you ever let Abraham leave the promised land where he told him not to leave any Jew that leaves the promised land is backslid cuz God gave them that to gave that to them and promised them to stay there see and they left it so he went down into guer into guer and then aimc that King down there in the Philistine country fell in love with Sarah the king fell in love with Sarah now Sarah was pretty old the king fell in love with Sarah and was going to marry her he was a good man a righteous man now I think Abraham was 60 75 Maybe and Sarah was 65 and this King aimik fell in love with her wow was he blind look what happens when God changes a person right oh what a change Grace has wro Sarah was going to marry uh Sarah and was going to marry her and he was a good man a righteous man and after now he says probably this sounds ridiculous but to make it so real to you after he had his evening bath and put on his pajamas and said his prayers and went to bed this is a b he's talking about the Lord appeared to him and said you're just as good as a dead man your life is a boat to be taken from you and the man had done nothing see he was absolutely deceived by both Abraham and Sarah that's right he said you've got another man's wife and I won't hear your prayers no matter how much you pray you're as good as dead but that man is my Prophet see see it's hard to understand that it's hard to understand that see but if it wasn't so we wouldn't know what Grace is if it wasn't so we wouldn't know what Grace is yeah musicians you can come let me read this for you here he says now we're we're all this is fate is our Victory now we're all made out of the same stuff see we're all made out of the same stuff it just depends on how your Ambitions run are you willing to let the master Craftsman make out of you that which he could use and that which he could control and that which he could power amen Paul a prisoner he laid it all down Moses laid it all down different different people in the Bible laid it all down and that now it's you and I you know what does that song mean I surrender all I surrender all All to Jesus I Surrender I surrender all one more verse God wants to mold and make us what he wants us to be he says but how can we do that or how can God do that when we want even stand still for him to do it he wants to be our we want to be our own Master we think we want to think our own way of thinking amen so it's important that we always consider this we live in Satan's Eden all right Satan's eating is a major influencer right so if we take that influence of Satan's eating no matter what we do brothers and sisters everyday work washing your dishes don't matter what you're doing you know if if if the world influences us more than the word of God influences the message of the hour the Bible if we're being influenced more by the world it's there we have an end time endday spirit it's cold c o l d it's cold it's a cold Spirit Leo de he says because you are lukewarm I will spew the out of my mouth I would rather that you either cold or hot right no on defense cold or hot God wants us hot he wants us on fire for him he wants us to be alive you know to have that faith of Abraham God still protected Abraham even though he he had to lie to save his skin to AMC he had to lie and so on but God still hey got him back into the promised land got him on the straight and narrow again right he says but let me tell you something tonight let me go back one paragraph here many people come into the church and join the church put their name on the book and doesn't even consider what the church believes or check up with that church how they preach the word you know you know you would think if you were a churchgoer you're a nominal believer denominational you live in CBS and you've seen this church here Catholic Church used to be then you see a new ownership come and take over h H wonder what that's all about right it should prick our attention I'll just think I'll go there I'll watch I'm in the neighborhood I live in the neighborhood I'll just watch one of these cars come up here and open the doors I'll just come in and ask them what they all about what are you guys all about what do you believe you know one time brother Brandon speaks about it in here he says everybody he said if God did a miracle everybody talked about it everybody was delighted about it God doing a miracle praise God God did a miracle now he says unless it's scientifically proven scientifically proven nobody wants to hear about it scient scientific is not Faith right scientific doesn't create Faith he said uh or check up with that church how they preach the word of God wouldn't that be nice brother Jonathan you know you get some people knocking on your door here you get an opportunity to speak to them and tell them what you believe and tell them what the church is all about and what God has done in this last day that we live in right that's that's up to us to to uh you know as you have therefore opportunity right as you have therefore opportunity you know hit that button or whether they stand for the Full Gospel or not or just pick out a position and add a read floating drifting never be able to amount to anything but let me tell you something tonight you on the in and the outside of this building you're going to wind up at a destination one of these days that's going to be in the valley of the shadow of death I would advise you at this hour to prepare to meet the god that will have to meet you at that hour you leader meet him as a masterpiece oh I like that Masterpiece don't you yeah you leader meet him as a masterpiece that he has worked on God's working he never stops working he's always working he never stops working right he never does he's always molding you brother he's always building on that he's just chipping away at that Masterpiece you either to meet him as a masterpiece that he has worked on or floating piece of Driftwood to go into your final destination you don't there's no in between you don't use this life just to drift around and Float around and get a better job and dress better and get a new TV or a better car life means more than that don't you try to use it just to say well it's the rest of them if the rest of them join church I will too he says when you join Church join Church you should first seek out and find out what that church stands for is it just merely a place that people go together for fellowship or is it a place that preaches the word of the Living God and and stands for every principle that Jesus died for you should do that just don't float in and go with the tide because straight is the gate excuse me and narrow is the way that leadth to life of few there be that there go in there at because brought is the way that leaded to destruction and many there be that find it that go there that go in and many will there be go in he he says we got to have a purpose of something goes on to speak about Daniel and Buddy Robinson and so on there let's sing that little chorus sister what was the name of it I'm glad I'm so

magnify thy name flow through me Holy Spirit flow to me amen I just want to read a quote here to you [Music] brother brandham uses Paul as an example he says Paul with all his great intellects he was taught by gilia to be a great priest or Rabbi someday and he had high ambition he was intelligently a great man great Authority great man in the nation but he had to sacrifice every bit of it to become a part of the word to express Jesus Christ see he knowed what it was he had a no notion to go someplace some brethren had called him but he was forbidden by the spirit to do his own will oh if people half spiritual can pick that up up he was forbidden to do it to do his own will he only could do the spirit forbid me he says he he was a prisoner of Christ Moses's intellectuals he had to lose them in order to find Christ to be a prisoner then when God got all the world beat out of him and all the mighty man that he was and stand in the presence of that Pillar of Fire that day he was found just speech speechless he couldn't even talk he said God had a prisoner see you w you want try after your own searching then God has to end do this man to Endo him with power enough that he could go down there see Lord I and he said Lord I told Pharaoh what you said and he wouldn't do it see he said then take this Rod God speaking that's God's word take the rod go out there and pointed toward the East and call for flies and flies come into creation because he had a prisoner that Pharaoh couldn't pay off with nothing see nobody could turn him no way he was a complete prisoner in the chains of God's word bound up holy to thus sayeth the Lord oh if God can get his prisoners like that no that's when he can express his preeminence right God can get you brothers and sisters to rely totally on the word of God said Lord thy will not mine that's when he can express his preeminence you see he's got the man or the person so that he knows nothing but Christ you get what I [Music] mean he says that secondarily and secondly talking about Christ he says first Christ wanted first to express himself completely God in Christ secondly to have the preeminence in his church which is his body bride he could have the preeminence to express himself can you imagine you're the body of [Music] Christ there's no other way to say it you're the expression of Christ the image the likeness the fullness think about it brother or sister you know that'll get your feet to dancing right how could we do that Christ in you the hope of glory I'm done which is his buddy he could have the preeminence to express himself to that and thirdly to restore the kingdom to its rightful position that fell by the sin by sin by the first Adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people talk with them fellowship with them you know brother brandom talks about in the early days then down there you know you could find God anywhere he said you could find God God anywhere is talking to people wow people were sincere more sincere [Music] then they were more leaning on God all the principles you go back down see everything falling away when it comes this way Bible says remove not the old landmarks remove not the ancient landmarks remove not the old landmarks right any landmarks left any lighthouses left you know man has gone to S to S got to such an extravagant State hey we don't need God in the schools [Music] we don't need to pray in the schools we don't even need to pray in church that's where the world is today that's what we have to contend with brothers and sisters that's what your little daughters and sons and have to contend within the school you know oddballs the Christian is an oddball the businessman is an Oddball to to Christian so on Amen I'm glad to be a
