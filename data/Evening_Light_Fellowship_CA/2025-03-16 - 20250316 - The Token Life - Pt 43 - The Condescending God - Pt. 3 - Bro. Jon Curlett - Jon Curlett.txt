give her age away but she is no longer young she has been young but she's older now but she's never seen the righteous forsaken or a seed begging bread I believe that's one thing you can say sister Betty that you have seen the grace of God in your life amen God bless you richly we certainly appreciate you want to thank brother Garfield for the service on Wednesday I told my wife afterwards I said it's nice to get a break but it's really nice to get an edifying break amen it's good to come and be blessed bled I'm not here to just listen to him man preach brother Garfield as you've said to me many times but I I just so enjoyed that I thought it was excellent amen God bless you richly for that I appreciate that hey if God's got to bring someone for Jamaica from Jamaica to feed us that way then I say praise the Lord bring more from Jamaica amen but God bless you richly we certainly appreciate that I know how busy your life is and uh to take that time out and and if God puts a message on your heart to to say you're going to preach it no matter what I appreciate that so God bless you amen I'm happy to announce this morning that I booked brother Jonathan Martin to come and preach for us on the weekend of May 23rd through the 25th uh brother Jonathan Martin remember brother Bram says there's some preachers that preach like a house on fire and then there's the rest of us brother Jonathan Martin is one of those ones that preaches like a house on fire so a younger brother than I am and uh I first met him back in 2009 in Texas when we lost our pastor and he came down with his wife and three kids and stayed with us and just uh preached an amazing weekend there and so I reached out to him last night and he came back this morning said he'd be honored to come up and preach for us so uh very much looking forward to that we have brother Barry coffee of course coming on the 29th of this month as well so just remember that we'll of course have our usual number of fellowships and and get togethers throughout those weekends um and uh I'm trusting we'll enjoy it it's been a long time since we've had special meetings it was a camp of last year I think where we had dedicated weekend of special meetings so uh I think we're we're well overdue it's been a busy time I I know at times but uh I think we're overdue to just have a weekend where we just dedicate it to the Lord and just come in and enjoy his presence amen so God bless you let's turn to John chapter 14 and verse 18 this is Jesus speaking he says I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me and because I live you shall live also amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning I want to come back to this thought that we had been taking two services on on the condescending God and last time we preached on this thought we showed how that when God came down when he condescended he showed what was possible for the believer or what was expected in the life of the believer and so when he came down first to Moses in that Pillar of Fire in that burning bush he showed that the most that the believer could achieve was works by obedience that was all he could give him he gave him a law and he said you need to live by this and the thing is you think well law uh works by obedience doesn't sound like very much but even that we couldn't do even that we couldn't do with it clearly written down and God set a a requirement before us nobody could do that nobody could do what the law required and So within the requirement God made a way to cover for when we couldn't meet it amen he gave us a requirement and then he met the requirement under blood amen he provided way for us because he knew we couldn't do it you know that ought to give us some encouragement this morning God knows we can't do it and so he makes a way for us to do it when we can't do it this morning amen but you notice now that God was in the pillar of fire he dwelt in a holy of holies he was there he was only available to one person one day a year as we we've talked about and so that was God revealing himself as the father above us and he was unobtainable and he was holy and he was righteous and nobody could come into His presence he could come to ours we couldn't come into His but that wasn't what God wanted it was a revealing of God and that Holiness and righteousness and even that that Holy judgment and those things amen but God didn't want to be separated from us that way if you go listen to that message Christ is the mystery of God revealed God was trying to reveal himself in different ways with purpose and so he comes down and he condescended into flesh in a man called Jesus of Nazareth and we know that body was born perfect it was born sinless it came through Mary but there wasn't any DNA of Mary inside of Jesus he was Godly DNA he was like a he was just like Adam he was word born there was nothing of Humanity in him in the in the sinful uh elements amen he was a perfect being that was born he was a Son of God just like Adam was and in that perfect being he lived a perfect life and remember we preached this brother br's very clear about it he was not deity in flesh for the first 30 years he was a Son of God just like Adam was the spirit of God was not in him he had the nature of God by his birth but he did not have the person of God inside of him but by his own free will he went through life he faced trials he TR faced tests he faced hard times he faced rejection and through it all he was sinless for those first 30 years he was sinless perfection without anything except his Free Will that's what got him to do it but then he comes down amen he was in the image of God but he was not filled with the fullness of God Amen and then at the River Jordan God came down and he said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell and the spirit of God came down on in inside of Jesus and that's where God God and man became one the first time that's where there was a union of Heaven and Earth and it was God condescending in flesh to be with us amen it was God being able to stand beside now it's God revealing himself as the son and if you look at the son his nature is still the same as the father and that he's still holy he's still righteous Jesus still came and he declared judgment he didn't come to declare judgment but absolutely you see he judged the Pharisees and he judged those that that were Hypocrites and those different things but he's no longer the distant father but now he's the present son and he now we've got we call today a touch point that you can go up now it's not just this this person off in The Ether but now it's a God that we can touch and feel and hear and have a conversation with it's a reality to us in a way that he wasn't before it's not a second person of the Trinity it's God now stepping into another form to reveal more of himself amen it's God coming down condescending to show us a greater portion of himself that's what's happening inside of Christ it's God opening up the mystery of himself there was a revealing in the Old Testament and it was that Holiness and righteousness part but now he comes down you know I kind of wrote it in my notes here that God is more of and a father is more of a judge than a buddy many times at least in my house asked my kids but see what is Dad Dad is strong dad is Authority dad is disciplined dad's an enforcer so yes he guards against the outside but he also prepares what's inside the home and so he's the one that keeps the kids in line in a greater way than Mama usually usually and so we know that Dad is going to protect us and he's going to use his strength for us but there are times where he has to use his strength on us to keep us in line and to make us what we need to be and so as the father all they could see was this holy judgment really cuz the law only brought condemnation it didn't bring anything else but now Christ comes down and he says I didn't come for the righteous I come for the Sinners and I come to draw them back to God even if they don't think they can I come down to do something in their lives that they don't realize they need to have inside of their lives amen but now we comes down in a body of Christ and now we have access that we didn't have before can you imagine being able to go up and have a conversation with god next to the campfire to be able to go into the temple and God Has Come descended in flesh and now it's God preaching literally it's God preaching to sit there and say I have met with God I walked with God you know John laying down and leaning his head on jesus' chest I lay my head on the chest of God he laid his hands on me he gave me direction he told me what was going on in my life it was God himself that was doing this work hidden in a body of flesh called Jesus Christ and what was it it was God now revealing another element of himself revealing another attribute of himself another part of his Redemption plan to us amen you know I love reading through the gospels and I've said before in my devotions I do uh uh Psalms or Proverbs I do a portion in the Old Testament then I do a portion in in the gospels and then I do the rest of the books of the newest Testament but I love reading in the gospels because what you see there is exactly how God would do things there's no questions because when he's living through Christ you see how he talks you see how he walks you see what he does you see how he acts you see how he reacts you see how he's quiet you see how he lets people tie themselves in knots without saying a word you see him turn the other cheek you see him heal you see him re uh respond to Faith and you see unable to respond to fa to unbelief all these things we can see a perfect life because that's what Christ lived was he lived a perfect life it was the fullness of God in a body showing us how to live and so just as how God showed in Moses time that the works of a of a Believer were all that they could have now God condescending again shows us that we can have Perfection by surrender that's what Christ showed Perfection by surrender uh brother Grant you preached so many times in the last few bit and it's just fed right into these thoughts that that have been sitting here it's beautiful Perfection by surrender Christ perfection in the end was not just that he was sinless it was that he did the will of God that's what we're looking for is not just sinless perfection we have that under the blood but we're looking for a living Perfection which is to do only that which the father wants us to do amen that's what's happening here so Christ was the Apex the Pinnacle the peak of of perfection in a human body it was God United with man completely perfectly with no filters no hindrances of any way and that was a special opportunity those people had in that day and and you know I think we got a taste of it in this age between with the message of Malachi 4 but I think that they got that special opportunity because they needed that for what they were about to go into they got an opportunity to see what God could do in a body of Flesh because he was going to do it in them and they had to see what was possible they had to have that touch point of a living reality of God so that when their time came they could step into it no matter what was pushing against them no matter what was trying to hold them back no matter how hard the circumstances were they had to see it demonstrated before them and it looked like everything was going so good and then Christ goes to Calvary and God moves out of that body of Flesh that body of Flesh gets put away it gets put away man God stopped revealing himself as the son and we lost that touch point and since that point we haven't had that same availability in the same way very close very close but not exactly the same thing not that constancy right prophets they've got to wait for thus sayeth the Lord Jesus was thus sayeth the Lord there's a difference there right so you can have a prophet in your midst and it's very close but it's not the same and so they lost that touch Point amen and so those disciples could go and talk to him and see him and that woman at the well could come and he could go into her life but there was a reality there that got lost when that body of Jesus went away amen and we lost that touch point that ability to just go and get encouragement to have a perfect word given to us every time to be corrected in the way and it seemed like there's a disadvantage in US losing that and I think there is a disadvantage but I want us to realize what happen happened at Calvary before we move on into what happened after Calvary brother Brown would say this he says in the Old Testament we had laws and bylaws and things that people had to do by The Works of the law to be saved he says but God wound everything in the Old Testament right up and put it in Calvary that the believer now only has one thing to do look to Calvary and be born again that's it I can do that by God's grace I can do that he says that's all it is it's just so simple the laws and all the ceremonies and everything passed away with the shedding of the blood now catch this he says when my shadow was coming to me when my shadow and I meet my shadow is no more but I took the place of my shadow so catch that see as the light's coming closer and as you're moving closer that shadow starts to come come come and it gets shorter and shorter until as you come into Perfect Light directly above you the shadow disappears and all that's left is the object he's saying you when Jesus came remember they were worshiping the shadow they were worshiping the law and they turned the shadow of the law into a bondage and he says you don't realize I'm coming that the shadow can go away so that the object that you've been looking for can come into your life too many people are worshiping Shadows today rather than the object that's come the thing that's reflecting it he says and that's the way the law was the Old Testament was a shadow of the New Testament and was fulfilled Grace and law met at Calvary and law was fulfilled and Grace came into existence so we moved out from dead Works under the law they were dead not because they weren't what the law said but because they couldn't do everything the law said and so all that came out of it was death it was judgment it was condemnation couldn't redeem us couldn't make us perfect and now Christ comes in and at Calvary he ushers in the age of Grace the Covenant of Grace the law was swallowed up in Grace doesn't mean we don't have to do what God wants but it means that he judges us differently now amen I like how brother Garfield talked about it last service when he was talking about when God came down with the abrahamic Covenant and that's what we are remember we're not children of Moses we're children of Abraham there's a reason for that because Moses is law Abraham is Grace remember and God came down to Abraham and he says I'm going to confirm my Covenant to you and so he tells he tells Abraham he says do this stuff and separate the the the sacrifices and do this and that and Abraham's all ready and he does lays it all out and then God comes down and what does he do to Abraham he puts him to sleep he takes him completely out of the picture God comes down confirms the Covenant to himself by himself then he wakes Abraham up and he says Abraham it's done so Abraham is now the benefit or of the Covenant having done nothing he's been out cold the whole time he wakes up and it's finished that's where we stand today Abraham does that mean Abraham didn't have Works to do Abraham had works but the Covenant was fulfilled through Christ not through Abraham that's what he was doing for him amen he made Abraham the perfect recipient and he had nothing to do with it by works but he did works because he believed the Covenant it's Faith now rather than just works remember what Paul would say in Ephesians he says for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God it's the grace of God it's the faith of God it's a complete and total work of God brother Braham says it this way he says that's the way men are trying to do today is to Merit their salvation and there's not one thing you can do about it it's all Amazing Grace nothing you can do it's not by works but by grace are you saved that UNM merited Grace God through the righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ has saved you and called you by his own Grace so remember we said before that God works in phases he's starting to work he's in the middle of a work and then he's finishing a work and we see here at Calvary what happened was he finished the work of the law he fulfilled the law and now there's a shifting phase into the into Grace God came down in Moses day and did a law phase then he comes down in Christ and he fulfills the law phase and he starts the gra Grace phase at the same time at Calvary at Calvary Christ fulfilled the law and started Grace and in that moment remember when God starts something he he has to finish it God never starts without finishing he started the law he fulfilled the law now he starts a work of Grace and that means the work of Grace has to be finished before the grace phase is over you know how I know the bride goes before tribulation because tribulation can't happen under grace so the bride has to go out before judgment because she's under a Grace Covenant amen if you look at the big picture of those things remember God was in Christ working in him to bring us back to him that's the great mystery unfolding before our very eyes is God trying to redeem us back to himself amen remember what Paul would say in Corinthians he says to ITT that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto him s that word reconcil means to restore us back to favor that means we were in favor at some point you can't be restored if you weren't there in the first place we were in favor we came out of favor and he says so God is reconciling the world to himself not imputing their trespasses unto him right the sin debt was paid Forever at Calvary were justified in his eyes through the blood he says and he had committed unto us the word of reconciliation how how are we going to come back into favor with God the word of reconciliation what does it mean to reconcile it's a word of restoration it's a message of restoration that's going to do the work it's a word of restoration that's going to give us full Redemption that's why we need Malachi 4 it's got to turn us back to the original word it's got to turn us back to that restoring word it'll take us back to relationship with God Authority with God and our position with God like Adam had in the beginning you can preach a year on that and never scratch the surface of it remember but Paul's telling us here that God was in Christ doing a restoring work and then all of a sudden Christ goes off the scene it seems how can he can how can he do a reconciling work if he's not here it's a good question it's a good question amen Christ he he ascended first he descended at Birth and then he ascended after his resurrection amen and then it seems like we're left with nothing to work with God has ascended and now we're on our own God was above us to start that didn't change us God was with us that didn't change us either and now he's supposed to reconcile us back to himself and he's gone how's he going to do it Christ was here and he was perfect but he left us imperfect how are we going to be reconciled back to God Look what Jesus said of himself he says which one of you convinces me of sin and if I say the truth why do you not believe me then Corinthians Paul would say for he had made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him Jesus declared his own sinless Perfection he had to he had to know that he was sinless he had to know that he was perfect and accepted before God otherwise he could not lay down his life he had to know who he was and he had to know that his conscience was clear of those things and yet while he stood there in his Perfection it did nothing for you and I in fact his Perfection judged us all the more so when he's done his work and he leaves we're still standing in judgment not only that but he would say to his own disciples he says be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect that's a command that's a requirement and he's telling them be perfect and then he says unless your perfection your righteousness is greater than that of the Pharisees you can't see the Kingdom of Heaven they're sitting there saying Jesus are you kidding me look at me look at me I'm not even as good as them and you're saying they're not going to get in I've got to be better than them now you're not just telling me to be better than them you're telling me to be perfect how how am I going to do this and it seems like condemnation would come all over them because they can't be those things but it's Jesus telling the Believers you've got to move beyond what you can do in yourself that's the thing it ought not to tell put us into a tail spin where we try and do things but it ought to tell us there is a different way than me trying there's a different Power that's required for this sort of thing amen we've got to get to our place where we see ourselves through his eyes not ours and that's when we'll get to see our Perfection amen that's where God's trying to get us he's given us a word of reconciliation he's given us a word of res Redemption of restoration amen and what he's asking us to do is believe it accept it and let it do a work that's all he asks of us to do is to accept the word that he's given us watch how Jesus sets up the the the disciples before he's before he goes he says then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures and said unto them thus it was thus it is written and thus it beho Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day so remember before this he told them what was going to happen but as far as we know the scriptures he never tied it to scripture he just said this is what is going to happen remember the Bible says the disciples didn't understand it now after his after he he resurrects he comes back to them and now he takes them into the word and he says this is where it all was you didn't see it but it was there it's already happened it's done and that's why I had to do what I had to do Peter that's why you couldn't save me on the night that they took me away that's why I had to be rejected that's why you had to leave me is because I had to go and die and fulfill the scriptures so that this Plan of Redemption could get kicked off until he tied it to the word they never saw it but as soon as he tied it to the word There Eyes came open and they understanded amen everything that David said and and Isaiah said and Zachariah said and all these things was lying there but they didn't see it until after it happened cuz if they saw it happening in real time they they might have tried to stop it but afterwards he opens their eyes and lets them see it it says and what's the reason that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem what's the purpose now why did he come and do this so that the law could be set aside and now he could preach that there's a taking away of sins and that'll restore you back to the presence of God he says and you are witnesses of these things past present and your Witnesses of what's about to come he says and behold I send the promise of my father upon you that's Ezekiel 36 Joel 2:28 but T ye in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high now watch this now Jesus is starting the New Covenant of Grace through faith in him but that Grace comes with power see too many times we got people claiming Grace and they turn it into a disgrace because what they do is they accept the work of the blood in terms of covering their sins but they never take the power that's offered with grace to change their lives he says listen this power this Grace it comes with power and it's going to change you and you can't move until you've been changed you can't move until you get power amen the disciples already had power they have power over demons they had power over sickness they have power over death that's not the power he's talking about he's talking talking a different kind of power he's talking a power that will do a different kind of work in their life amen listen they needed an effect in their own bodies in their own lives in their own Souls that the signs and wonders are just the effects that's the works of the spirit it's the works of the spirit but there's an inner work that had to be done amen so that can't be the power he's giving them the power he was giving them was not just power over death and hell and the grave and the demons and sickness and these things it had to be something that would do an internal work remember he told pet when thou art converted strengthen thy Brethren it had to be a converting work it had to be a redeeming work he says and then he led them out as far as to Bethany and he lifted up his hands and blessed them and it came to pass while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven so he's called them into Perfection he's called them into service he's called them to be Witnesses he's called them to preach the gospel they're called to heal the sick they're called to cast out demons to continue the works of Jesus but they need power like they've never had before they need life-changing power they need surrendering power they need humbling power they need leading power they need guiding power they need something inside of them that can defeat themselves what do they need see God with them was wonderful we love the presence of God in a in a in a church atmosphere in particular don't we but what happens if we go out and that presence doesn't go with us same thing that happened to the disciples when he wasn't there they got fearful when he wasn't there they didn't have the victory when he wasn't there they started squabbling about who was the the greatest in the Kingdom right as soon as he left then all of the effects went with them and even while he was there sometimes they still didn't have the full effect of it because of their unbelief what they were still overcome by themselves they couldn't get past themselves let's go back to where we started in service at the beginning Jesus said I pray the father and he will give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever forever not in and out not come into church and go out and lose the victory abide that means live with live with you forever it's not from special meetings to special meetings it's not a youth camp experience erience it's a daily abiding of the personal presence of almighty God that's what he's telling them about amen now watch this description he says it's even the spirit of Truth why does it have to be a spirit of truth because what God us here was a lying Spirit a religious lying spirit so it's got to be a spirit of Truth and it's got to be a spirit of truth because it's bringing a word of reconciliation it's got to be true if it's going to do a work amen it'll take the spirit of the word which is the spirit of God to undo this work of that deceiving lying Spirit of Satan he says even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but ye know him for he dwells with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you personal pronoun the same person is coming back not a third person of the Trinity it's the exact same person I will come to you period he says yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but because ye but ye see me and because I live you shall live also church if Christ didn't raised from the dead we'd be stuck in a cycle because our sins would be forgiven but we'd have no overcoming power we'd just be at a place of being able to go nowhere but because he lives we live also so if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you it'll Quicken your mortal body it'll make this body live that's not just a resurrection power that's a day-by-day power it'll make this life live the life that it's supposed to amen it's the living Christ that makes us who we are today not the dead Christ he says and at that day you shall know that I am in my father and you in me and I in you now we can jump ahead to Acts 2 and see what that looks like and I love that about the scripture because the scripture interprets the scripture I heard a Catholic say the other day he says we can't just stick with scripture because everybody interprets scripture differently and therefore we need other books to interpret scripture but what we have a prophet tell us he says God interprets his word only one way by bringing it to pass so Jesus tells him in John 14 what this looks like how do we know what that looks like church we look at what he did that's it if we if we believe the word a certain way how do we know it's right when it does what it says it was going to do it's very simple the problem with that is it requires patience it requires patience amen but can you imagine having the arrogance the audacity to say God needs me to do something to interpret his word church I can't even understand it unless he reveals it to me remember what he said to Peter Flesh and Blood had not revealed it to you in other words Jesus was saying it's not something that even I've said to you are done to you he says but my Father which is in heaven has revealed this to you it's a revelation from God Almighty that opens the word to us and that's it otherwise we'll twist ourselves in knots and what we what do we come up with we come up with death cuz as soon as we inject ourselves into it it loses all of its life and all we get is death and a mess and a denomination what's the problem the problem is we won't take it as it's given believe it as he said it and let it do what he said it would do I was reading habac in devotions earlier this week God said this he says the Lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie and though it t wait for it because it will surely come it will not t remember God was telling them he's saying the vision's right but there's going to come a time you think the vision's wrong because it hasn't happened yet but he says when that time comes carry wait stick with it because it's for an appointed time and when the appointed time comes the word will speak the word will do exactly what it said it's going to do and you'll see that it wasn't a lie but you've got to wait for the appointed time you've got to have patience amen that's a huge problem today when everything is so instantaneous we don't have to wait for anything except seeing a doctor we don't have to wait for anything information's at our tips access communication everything's at our tips what used to take months maybe a year to cross the country we can do in 6 or8 hours we can get anywhere in the world within 36 hours everything we could ever want is at our fingertips and you know what God says impatience possess you your souls stick with the word have patience with the word that was a test for the disciples because Jesus says go and wait until you're endued with power and he doesn't give them a Time like go wait how long do we wait church we wait until he does what he says he would do and by God's grace every single one of them 120 people went up in that room and they stayed there and they stayed there and they stayed there They carried as he told them to do and they stayed there until the promised word came into effect doesn't mean it was comfortable doesn't mean it was easy but they stayed there why they believed the word that's simple that's the only thing that holds us that's the nature of a Believer church is we stay with the word we believe it though it terries though it waits though it seems like it's held off we stay with the word that's what makes us a Believer we hold to it Watch What Happens now Acts 2 says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place what is it it's Unity under the word that's the only place you'll find Unity is when we're under the word led by the word in obedience to the word why because we're all playing from the same Playbook we're all under the same Authority we're all under the same orders he says and suddenly there was no buildup that's the way God works so many times is it's nothing and then in a moment in a twinkling of an eye the situation changes we don't have this big warning one minute we're sick the next minute we're healed one minute we're broke the next minute our needs are met one minute the situation is completely out of hand and the next minute it's peace one minute we're lost the next minute we're saved right God when he moves he moves and nothing can stop them nothing can hold them back at the appointed time CU it had to be the day of Pentecost it had to be that Jubilee it had to be that freedom day and at the appointed time it says suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting now is the wind the Holy Spirit no the wind's just a precursor it's an announcement something's happening he says and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them notice out this is a revelation of what Reeve of what the of what receiving the holy spirit is this is why you can't believe in a Trinity right here you'll never understand what's happening here if you put it in a trinity Doctrine because Jesus said I will come to you and here it is this is Jesus coming back scripture interprets scripture I don't interpret scripture the scripture interprets itself amen Jesus has returned back and what form is he in a pillar of fire not a third person he's gone back to light he's gone back to the form he was he said I was up I came down now I'm going back he's back in the same thing remember when he knocks Saul off of the horse Saul says who are you to the pillar of fire lord who are you and he says I am Jesus doesn't it look like Jesus now what is it that Pillar of Fire has come come down again what is it it's the continuity of God showing it's the same thing he says and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance now we covered this before that what they were speaking there was not tongues that were unknown to everybody as in it sounded like gibberish these were tongues that were known languages and so they were speaking and it would be like me talking to an Italian I don't speak Italian but I would be speaking speaking to an Italian that only knows Italian and they would hear my voice as if I was speaking Italian that's what's happening everybody that was gathered there heard them in their own language regardless of what language those people were speaking amen it's a supernatural tongues not a gift of tongues but notice there catch what these tongues represent not the tongues that they were speaking but these tongues of fire because the scripture says that the tongues of fire set on each person every person in that room got a little tongue of fire there's a reason why it say they're tongues of fire remember brother Brandon was talking about that movie The Ten Commandments and he and I just read this the other day and he says I don't know where Cecil B deil the the director of it he says I don't know how he got this he says but he got the pillar fire perfect he says because it's whirling around but there's little Flames little tongues coming off of it it's made up of little tongues all around whirling so what what's he talking about here he's talking about God coming down and pieces of himself coming off and rest on people it's God showing his continuity see it wasn't God above us and then a different God With Us and now a different God in us it's the same God all the way through that's why it had to be a pillar of fire come down here it's the God that was above us now coming to be in us it's the exact same thing we know God reveals himself he revealed himself in a pillar of fire pillar of light in a burning bush he revealed rece revealed himself in a man called mzc came down in a pillar of cloud he came down in Angelic forms all other things in scripture they're just forms they're just mass that God hides behind but it's the same God time and time again so if we look here God gets broken up does that diminish God is God diminished no it's just his attributes coming off it's his life coming off you take away from from everything you take away from Infinity what's left everything it does not diminish God's not diminished in these things but he's breaking off a part of himself he's showing it's not a different person it's not a different God it's the same God and now he's become a part of you it's all one and the same thing it's all one and the same thing it was God's final condescension to man brother BR says it this way he says according to scripture in the upper room waiting suddenly a sound like a rushing wind that was upon them he says that was the Holy Spirit how many believe that that was the appearing of the Holy Spirit like a wind a supernatural wind then they noticed and out in there was a little tongue of fire 120 of them and begin to settle down and said upon each of them what was it the pillar of fire which was God himself dividing himself among his people coming into the people Jesus had the whole thing he had the spear without measure we get it by measure because we're adopted children his eternal life was coming in now what happened he says then they were all filled with the Holy Ghost what is power cuz Jesus said you're going to be ued with power that word ued it means to be robed to be clothed with power remember we preached on adoption an adoption in the old time was when the son was deemed by the father to be ready for authority and so we have this public ceremony and then he would put a robe of authority upon on him so what's he talking about with the with the disciples he's saying you need to be robed you need to be deemed worthy and given Authority we preached before that I do not necessarily believe and I believe the scripture supports me on this that when you get the Holy Spirit you're adopted but you can receive the Holy Spirit and be adopted in that same moment cuz remember adoption is a process of time it's a process of teaching training testing and proving and unfortunately that doesn't happen in a moment we're creatures of time but the disciples have been tested they have been taught they have been tried and guess what church they had even failed that didn't stop them from coming into adoption CU what had been proven was their heart intentions but you still need power good intentions won't get you there but if you have power power behind the intentions of a solid heart that's lined with the word of God now you can get somewhere amen so they had showed that they wanted to be true disciples they had showed they wanted to be faithful but they couldn't do it you know David wanted so badly you see him in the Old Testament his desires and and he got frustrated with himself David was frustrated about what he did with basba that wasn't what David wanted but the flesh wanted it and it it burned him it h heard him that he did that and it was a struggle it was a source of frustration and we see it through the Old Testament lots of people everybody really wanting to live life a certain way and then not being able to do it and they failed and they failed and they failed now Peter comes down Peter's a failure by God's grace we're going to spend Wednesday on Peter they don't want to preach too much about him but Peter goes up into that Upper Room of failure a coward weak spineless too interested in self-preservation doeses Peter come down and an adopted son of God I believe he did I believe he did he came down amen he had stuck with the word he obeyed Christ's command and that was his final test God not only filled him with the spirit God adopted Peter and now those keys to the kingdom that he gave could be put into use what did he do Peter didn't just come down with signs and wonders but now he's under the authority and the leadership of the Holy Spirit brother Braham says he came down an inspired teacher right remember Jesus had committed them the gospel of reconciliation so what did Peter come down with a message of reconciliation he tells them what they've done that they've crucified the prince of glory and they say how do we fix this how do we get reconciled and he says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost Peter comes down and preaches the word of reconciliation and in one day 3,000 Souls were added to the kingdom what's the difference church it's not just power with them it's power in him it's not just God with him it's God in him now Peter's anointed by something else it's different it's a it's a different experience to have it in him rather than with him and Peter gets results like he's never had before BR says it this way he says now his body's up there the body of Christ descended that physical body was laid aside waiting for a return back to the Jews he says his spirit's down here his Spirit God's spirit worked through that body his virgin born son in the fullness of God then he watch this face shift he says he works through you and I as portions of God could I ask all portions of God to stand up this this morning I say we're living under our privileges Church portions of God the condescending God live in this live in this brother Bob are you kidding me live in you but that's what he did that's what he did you talk about a God that humbles himself so that you and I could be called Sons and Daughters of God portions of God listen my daughter here she doesn't have her daddy's looks thanks God but she's a portion of me and we are no different when it comes to him we are portions of God he says that's why the Holy Spirit when it came on the day of Pentecost it broke all up that Pillar of Fire and divided itself in licks of tongues and sat upon each one he says we have to have one another amen we need one another Paul on the road to Damascus gets knocked off he looks at that pillar fire he says Lord who are you and he says I am Jesus but then he says these three words whom thou th persecutest was Paul persecuting the pillar of fire was Paul doing bad things to the pillar of fire no who was he doing it to portions of God Jesus identified himself by name and person with those that were filled with the Holy Spirit Church this isn't theology we are so far beyond theology now we're into reality we're into the effect of a living God is to the point where he identifies you as himself by name that's where we are I didn't identify myself he identified me I'm not reading my name he's reading my name I'm not saying I'm him he's saying he's me and I'll tell you what I like what he says about me a whole lot more than what I say about me where are we at this morning church listen he says the biggest thing the devil ever got on us was when he separated us from the love of God and from one another and we love one another that's brotherly love and when we can get to one another if you've got part of the Holy Ghost and I've got part of it and the next man's part of it put us together that's three parts I'm three times as strong as I was with you two brothers see that's the way we stand together we stand and divided we'll fall he says that's right we must stand that way together what is it God has condescended and now he's dwelling in his family in the Old Testament he was in the holy of holies in the bridge between the Old and New Testament he dwelt in a body called Jesus and now in the Old Testament to finalize this mystery of redemption he's dwelling in you and I and we are identified by name by person by attribute by Nature by works by word all that he is we are identified by it but it's a little bit in each and every one of us he says oh God if the world could only if the world could only see that that God and man are one the super sign was that first man that God could come into and all that God was he poured into Christ and most of the world stops there but he says all that Christ was he poured into the church a super sign God and man together that was to be the Super sign of the last day when the entire Bible was to be fulfilled in the last days a super sign I love this a virgin shall conceive and this conception when it's brought forth will be God manifested In the Flesh a super sign he says they still don't believe it but it was anyhow he says it's still a super sign they've got Superman today they've got fictions of Superman all these other kinds of super things but the church has got a super sign God back in the church manifested in human flesh God United with man his sure sup sign I want you to think about that this morning church if you have received the true baptism of the Holy Spirit you have almighty God living inside of you I don't know if we can understand it I don't think I can frankly but he's there but he's there if you were to go tell somebody today I have God living inside of me what would they say they'll believe that a man is a woman and a woman is a man and you can have a nature of a cat or a dog but they won't believe that God could live inside of you I sometimes question if we believe it ourselves because if we did I think we'd walk a little differently but I love what he says here they still don't believe it but it was anyhow the the world not believing doesn't stop it the world not believing doesn't make it not real the world not believing doesn't stop church let me tell you my not believing you know what that's one of the only things that can hold God back is my unbelief Jesus constantly through the gospels he's abrading the disciples from their lack of unbelief but you know what even that never stopped him he'll get us to a place where we believe he'll get us to a place where we'll act he'll get us to a place where we'll stand he'll get us to the place where we'll hold fast and T until he fulfills his word inside of our life amen he says if he went to the Father the Holy Spirit would come is that right another scripture says if I go not away the comforter will not come but if I go away I'll come again and be with you even in you he says see it's God with you over you first with you in Christ he says in you in the Holy H ghost he says it's God in you listening to Christ's a mystery of God revealed this morning brother Bram says the bride needs to recognize her position her position ye are the Tabernacle of the Holy Ghost you are the bride of Christ he says and now that's why these true Miracles can be done because it's a promise of God the things that I do shall you also St John 14:12 he Christ that still the winds and the waves is the creator of them he is still just as much Creator as he was then he's the same yesterday today and forever he healed the sick and destroyed sin and changed it all for you and came to you that he might dwell with you he conquered all these things to come and live in us see he conquered it all out there now what does he do when he comes and lives with us he conquers it right here too see it can't be a gospel for everyone else Church can't be a gospel for everyone else it needs to be my gospel before I can make it your gospel he says he that is Con he is that conqueror that's already conquered these things proved it in the scriptures came back and conquered everything and proved to you that he is the same God and after 19 UND years here he is still doing the same thing among us that he did then that conquered death hell sickness and the grave he says this Christ this he he is he that's in you see we want to not we we don't want to but to often we make it something we've got to go to we've got to access no no no that's why he's here so we don't have to bring him down we don't have to raise him up we don't have to put on a show he that's in you as John said he that's in you is greater than he that's in the world that was Christ he's greater than all of the world because he conquered the world and is greater than all those things be conquered because he conquered it for us and we are more than conquerors see he's the mighty conqueror but now Paul comes in he says now we are more than conquerors how through him that loved us and gave himself force that he might come back and do his Works through through us to prove to us that he's the same yesterday today and forever when God was living in Christ Church what couldn't Christ do what was held back nothing wind waves ocean nature it all obeyed him diseases left death destroyed demons cast out the only thing that ever held him back was unbelief he went back to Galilee it says he could not do many great Miracles because of their unbelief and again he still got past that with his disciples God will get us where he needs to get us Church you stick with it you stick with it God will get us where he needs to amen but God will get us there listen Peter was a coward but when that Holy Spirit sealed his soul he got faith and courage to finally stand up like he had never stood up before he came down knowing that they wanted him dead knowing that they were looking for the followers of Jesus now that they killed Jesus and he came down willingly with a message and he preached and he saved 3,000 Souls through that inspired message God will get us where we need to be to a place of overcoming power he says now notice Jesus had commissioned them to go up to Jerusalem and wait the word Terry means to wait it doesn't mean to pray it means to wait catch this now he's speaking of the disciples they were not fit subjects yet to preach why because they only knew his resurrection by his person of seeing him outside they had seen a resurrected Christ he says he commanded them not to preach anymore not to do nothing until first they had been endued with power from on high see Peter had a Ministry of signs and wonders and yet Peter didn't have overcoming power till Pentecost Peter couldn't get over himself Peter couldn't get over that instinct of self-preservation he backed down when his life was on the line like I said by God's grace we're going to take a full service on Peter on Wednesday but I want you to see that transformation of a child of God by receiving the Holy Spirit Peter's so real Peter's just like so many of us very flawed and yet the things that God could use through that man once he got the Holy Spirit but Peter only knew about power on him and if you notice once Jesus left Peter lost his ministry pet Peter doesn't have signs and wonders after Christ died Peter's abandoned Christ Christ has moved on what does Peter do Peter goes back to fishing Peter backslides goes back to his old life Peter lays aside his ministry why because he doesn't have it anymore he's lost that anointing it's gone and so he's just like any other man what did Peter need listen in order to preach a word of reconciliation he needed to be reconciled he needed to know what Rec ilation looked like Peter needed his conscience purged Peter needed this nature changed and Peter needed power to come up and stand up for the word of God Peter needed to know Christ in the power of his resurrection not just know that he was resurrected one's a theology the others in experience amen Peter didn't need power to talk Peter needed inspiration I can't get up here and give a speech it has to be inspiration or its death it'll bring us into false religion Peter needed to be able to preach by experience the thing that he was talking about you can't get up here and preach to get the Holy Ghost if you don't have the Holy Ghost how do you know it's real I'm not saying we have to preach everything by experience listen I haven't I haven't gotten a resurrection or a Rapture yet but I still preach it Paul said not as though I had already attained or either were already perfect that doesn't didn't keep him from stopping from preaching Perfection but he says what forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forward to those things which are before I pressed toward the mark for the prize of the high gol of God in Christ Jesus right just because I don't have it doesn't mean I don't keep pushing just because I don't have it doesn't mean I stop believing but I'll preach to you what I've got that's for sure so you can get at least what I've got I think we've got to be real about what we have but that doesn't mean we don't stop pushing for what's coming ahead either amen remember the new birth is just the earnest it's the down payment of what's coming it's not the full experience of what we're going to have but remember what happened Jesus said youve got to be endued with power you've got to be clothed with power notice what the Holy Ghost does what does it clothe what does it seal what does it wrap up the soul it's the soul that does that work amen our soul is wrapped up and filled with the Holy Ghost and that satisfies the Eternal portion within us that's our satisfying portion but this flesh can never be satisfied it's insatiable you can you can put sensuality in front of it you can put entertainment in front of it you can put uh all sorts of these things in front of it and it never satisfies it look at the world around us I think they say 70% of people in in North America are overweight now we're insatiable this flesh is never satisfied but there's an eternal portion that gets satisfied when you get the Holy Ghost absolutely and that's a comfort to us amen but that power is not not just given to satisfy it's given with purpose amen it does something for us but it's meant to do something through us as well when it's done a work in me then it's going to go on and go on to the next person and try and do something in their life as well amen it's meant to bring us to a place where we can live and act and react and be used by God that's never been possible before the holy spirit is for action but first it's got to do an internal work listen we can be good church attenders we can be good citizens good Bible believing people amen but we need a power to take this word and live it through every challenge through every trial through every circumstance through every hardship sometimes I think we need the Holy Ghost more in the good times because that's when most people fall away when things get desperate we all come back to God you need a holy ghost to keep you on when things are going great as well that's when Israel always got off watch now we're almost done he says watch God was in in spirit how could God be torn apart but one day God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us the Lord Jesus Christ the Emanuel and then there at Calvary the Covenant God wrote with us he took the Christ to Calvary and to him tore him apart soul and body and he took his body up to sit at the right hand of his majesty and sent the soul back here or the spirit on Earth to make a covenant what's this Covenant Church to carry out the gospel amen God bless you let's stand if we would carry out the gospel what does that mean brother John does that mean teaching sure but Jesus said to preach it to preach it means to speak it and live what you speak that's what a preacher is we ought to judge a preacher does his life match what's coming over that Pulpit because if not he's not a preacher he's a false teacher he doesn't have what he's talking about amen but Jesus said go live it prove it be an example of what the gospel is not just by word but by deed by life lived by decisions made by the way you dress by the way you speak by the things you do by the things you don't do and by the reality of the power of God working in your day-by-day life I believe that nobody ought to live a life greater than a Christian not in terms of money not in terms of influence but that ability to just walk through life and remain unworried and broke up by what's going on around us like David said yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I'll fear no evil in the hardest times we can walk with our heads up with faith because we know he's not just walking with us he's walking in US amen it's not just God With Us now it's God in us the indwelling person of God in you and I this morning we're in a wonderful place Church portions of God sitting here this morning brother Chad do you know you're a portion of God Amen a portion of God if you have received the Holy Spirit a portion of God resides inside of you I say God let that come out every day a little more amen a lot more why limit him why limit him in my life Lord be glorified we're going to sing that as just after we pray sister morber if you play that softly let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord how can mortal mind grasp the reality of a living God inside of us Lord this mind this flesh this world fights against that thought and that idea Lord we can't even comprehend what it means but yet Lord it is the great mystery being revealed the Fulfillment of all scriptures comes down to Christ in us the hope of glory Lord and your word says that it's given in Earth and vessels that the Excellency may be of you and not of us Lord I pray you help us to focus on the you part rather than the US Lord that in our lives Lord we fail I fail every day Lord but we're looking to the Perfection that resides within us Lord we're looking to be led Lord we're looking to follow you where you would have us to go to do what you'd have us to do to say what you'd have us to say Lord to be still when you'd have us to be still and in all things Lord to wait on you with faith and patience Lord I pray you give us a greater reality every day Lord that it's God in us now Lord you didn't just come 2,000 years ago and then go away Lord but you came back and you're a comfort to us day by day Lord I pray you be a comfort this morning those that are sick those that are needy Lord there's many needs before us Lord I pray that God that's in each one will move Lord to heal to deliver to save to conquer to encourage to support to love Lord you see every need we have bless your people now we pray Heavenly Father in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen
