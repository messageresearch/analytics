may you just discern them tonight through the going forth of the word lord speak into the lives of each person that's gathered here and listening to us we pray in jesus christ's name we ask and pray amen amen god bless you thank you musicians if you would turn the scriptures to psalms chapter 63 psalm 63 amen god bless you this evening it's good to be back in service and i've got a lot on my i got a lot on the fork tonight this is something i've been sitting on for two months amen and just felt that this was the time to bring it amen so psalm 63 trusting that god will bless you this evening minister to your heart's need psalm 63 in verse 1 says o god thou art my god early will i seek thee my soul thirsteth for thee my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land where no water is to see thy power and thy glory so as i have seen thee in the sanctuary because thy loving kindness is better than life and my lips will praise me i want to look back at verse 2 there quickly he says to see thy power and thy glory so as i have seen in the sanctuary what was he asking for he was asking for god to be the same in his life as he was in the church that the feelings he had that the anointing that he had that the presence that he felt in church that the things that he had seen god do would be the same in his day-to-day life as what he had in church amen because thy loving kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee thus will i bless thee while i live i will lift up my hands in thy name my soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips when i remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches because thou hast been my help therefore in the shadow of thy wings will i rejoice my soul followeth hard after thee thy right hand upholdeth me but those that seek my soul to destroy it shall go into the lower parts of the earth they shall fall by the sword they shall be a portion for foxes but the king shall rejoice in god every one that sweareth by him shall glory but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped amen god bless you you may have your seats this evening amen i read this scripture when we uh spoke on thirst and that was two months ago amen it's hard to believe that but it was two months when i when i spoke on that service on knowing where to go to satisfy your thirst and we we read a portion of this scripture there and it was just on my heart to stay with it and so i want to i want to preach on that this evening but we spoke of david there where he he had a close enough relationship with god that he knew where to go when he had a need and when he had a thirst amen he knew where to get the satisfaction the joy the strength the encouragement as he sought to keep from being killed for over 10 or 15 years amen this was not a life of ease for david despite the the king anointing but he had a place of refuge he had a place of strength amen and so tonight i want to take a title of my god amen my god and we read there that he said oh god thou art my god my question tonight is can you say that same thing oh god thou art my god amen we see david writing here in psalm 63 and this is well into david's life amen this is not something that david wrote when he was 14 years old perhaps you know watching the sheep but david has come to the place where god is very personal to him amen he has come to the place where he's no longer just jehovah god but he has become my god amen that he has identified a reality of god that is outside of the church that is outside of the sanctuary that is outside of the prophet's message that is outside of what he's seen in other people's lives but he's seen a reality of god that allows him to call him now my god that he's identified with him that god has revealed himself in a way that makes him personal to david amen and david didn't come to this place of relationship david didn't come to this place of revelation just by sitting in church i mean this is not something that just comes by by sitting into wonderful sermons and hearing anointed ministry and and singing anointed songs and these things it's not just coming by nodding your head to what's coming over the pulpit or or what you might hear or or as you read your bible amen but there was plenty of others that were doing those things in those days that we're still going to to the tabernacle that we're still going to to the synagogue in in these different things and hearing the priests read the scrolls and whatnot and nodding their heads and saying amen but david out of all of those was picked by god amen amen i want you to understand that it's something to be picked by god it's something to be chosen by god to be drawn into a relationship with him and brother branham would say in so many messages he says if god is calling you give in right away right don't fight it don't resist it when god is pulling you when you feel conviction when you feel god's saying there's more for you then don't resist it amen but to come to it and david we know didn't have much of a choice when it came to his anointing because a prophet came his way picked him out of a crowd and poured oil over his head and said you'll be the next king of israel. so david had an anointing regardless but the point is that god chose david david did not choose god necessarily amen god pulled him out and he said i have a plan and i have a purpose and he told them what the plan and the purpose was but you know what he didn't tell him he didn't tell him how he was going to get there and so he had to trust that he was anointed for that purpose he had to trust that god was in the plan but he had to now walk through the plan without any foresight as to what was going to happen the next day he had no idea when the plan of god was going to be fully manifested in his life but he had to have a closeness that would keep him going when it didn't look like that was never going to come at all amen i want to ask you the same question is that do you know you've been called out and then do you know that you've been called for a purpose do you know that you don't just sit in this church because you're raised in the message family but god has called you personally to serve him and it's with purpose and it's worth a plan amen each one of us has to realize that we don't just come to church because we believe a message i mean that's great and that's good but the the rich young ruler had that experience amen but when he calls you out it's for a purpose and it's because he wants to be real to you it's because he wants to have a relationship to you it's because he wants to take a place in your life that nobody else has amen and maybe you've got things maybe you've got habits maybe you've got relationships maybe you've got ideas and things that are holding you there but he wants you to set those aside so that he can be real to you in a way that he's never been before amen but we see today and you can see it in the ranks of of certainly nominal christianity you can see within the ranks of the message if you've traveled at all and even within our own circle here and that there are three types of believers in every congregation amen and you have the real believer you have the misbeliever or the fake believer if you will and then you have the rank sinner amen you have the unbeliever that's there and we have those that profess christ and their lives are no different than they were before they came and then they walked through the church door and all they became was somebody that nods their head to the word but their life didn't change that's not a believer that's somebody that's just associated with the truth potentially amen amen but if you have a heart to serve god which david did then there's something special in you that's calling out for something that's available to you because god won't put a call in there if there's not something to satisfy that call amen amen amen but out of all of these people out of all of these types of believers we've been called out to do one thing and what is that if you look in revelation chapter three there's only one thing we're told to do and that's to overcome and then we're called to be an overcomer we're called to overcome the trials and the tribulations and the traps and these different things that are set for our day we're called to come out of her my people and in that coming out to him we have overcoming power amen but if we stay where we're at we're never going to have anything but brother branham would say this to the believers to those that are called out he says don't try to impersonate that's what's the matter with pentecost today now pentecost remember was where the truth was until he came so i want to say today where you say pentecost i would say put the message say that's what's wrong with the message today if you want to look at it because i'm hearing more and more ministers talk about the messages if it's a group the message is not a group it's an individual amen it is christ himself revealed in your life personally so there's no such thing as message culture there's only god and you amen but they're talking about it in a way that's drawing us into paths that i worry about sometimes the way they talk about the way they approach things is as if we're one big group and guess what we're not one big group amen it is individuals walking with god alone that will unite together under one thing and that is the baptism of the holy spirit in their life and that is the only thing that's going to keep you amen but he says that's what's the matter with pentecost today that's what's the matter with the church today there's too many trying to impersonate that they've got the holy ghost there's too many trying to impersonate divine healing there's too many trying to impersonate different things of the lord you can't do that those things come by election and god calling you're dropped from your mother's womb with that gifts and callings are without repentance he's talking to ministers primarily there and those with gifts of the spirit and whatnot he says oh my that's true you can't make yourself something you're not but if god calls you be the most thankful person in the world because he has called you then it becomes real to you so it's the calling of god that is a separating factor amen right many are called but few are chosen and that's really what we're looking at is those that are chosen not that heard the call but those had a call on them in the first place to receive what was coming forth amen this is why i spent 18 services talking about conduct right it's so that you would understand that this is not just about nodding your head amen but it is about a life lived it's about living voices not just speaking voices amen it's so that you can get established and grounded in the living word that will change your life in a way that you've never had before it's about the reality of god inside of your life amen so that god can what develop you to the point where he can trust you and use you just like he did those in the book of acts in first john 2 it says i write unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning that means to recognize god by intimate relationship i write unto you young men so fathers the fathers would be the older ones amongst us then he says i write unto you young men because you have overcome the wicked one you've conquered you've prevailed you've gotten victory over satan by a reality of god and then he says i write unto you little children because you have known the father so we're all covered in the scripture every one of us is covered in here amen god has revealed himself to you that's what he says you've known the father god has revealed himself to you even you little children he says those that are young in the faith he says god has still revealed himself to you i have written unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning i've written unto you young men because ye are strong and the word of god abideth in you and you have overcome the wicked one love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passes the way in the luster of but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever i want you to catch that there that obedience being found worthy of trust to do god's will takes us all the way to knowing eternal life obedience is what takes us there amen the son that does what the father asked is the one that truly loved him remember when they talked when jesus was telling the parable he says the father goes to the sons and he says do this and one of them says yes i will and the other one says no i won't. but he says afterward one of them is conscious being pricked he goes and he does what the father asked and then the other one that said yes doesn't do it at all he said which one loves the father and they said the one that did what he asked but he was disobedient at first but he came to himself and he went and he did what the father asked amen that's what jesus is saying here you can nod your head all day long but unless you go do what the word tells you to do then guess what there's no love in you amen right and that won't take you to our eternal life is just not in your head amen what is it it's letting god come in through the door of our life and change our life change our decisions change our way of doing things so that he can use us amen so that we'll do what he says and he can trust us in that place amen so we have to find ourselves in the position of the overcomer and the overcomer always gets there first through obedience and then god's got to know he can trust you so what will he do he'll give you the word as you read your bible as you listen to messages as you come to church he'll give you the word and then he'll say are you going to do it and it's a simple question isn't it yes or no yes i'll do it not yes but not in my head but yes i'll apply it in my life yes i'll take what was said and i'll let it have preeminence in my life and then he says that's a son i can trust that's a daughter i can trust because when i speak he obeys when i speak she does what i told her to do it's very simple right it's not difficult when he says move we move when he says obey we obey amen but to overcome is to do what is to keep the life of christ in you through every trial through every tribulation through every difficulty and come out on the other side stronger and better in him than you were before you went in remember brother brown talks about that log that was rotted on the inside but looked good on the outside he says it to overcome is to keep life within you so that everything is solid so that everything is strong not just the outside looking good amen the outside nods the inside has to be strong by obedience it's the only way because that's what's taking in the nutrients isn't it amen we see it in the life of david as to what brought him to the place where he could call god my god amen and what was it it wasn't a a life of cuddles and kisses and pats on the back and david you're an awesome man no god chose him god said i've chosen you and that settled it and then god started preparing him amen god wasn't coming along every day pat and david saying hey good job buddy good job keep going keep going that's not the way god worked god anointed him and then god put him through the trials to make sure that that anointing would have the right effect on him amen because saul had the same anointing didn't he as soon as david got the anointing it left saul so there was no difference in the anointing what was the difference the vessel it's the only difference amen so david's path to a reality of god was not one of these and it was it didn't start with glamour david was a shepherd david was a shepherd and then he got anointed and then he went right back to being a shepherd he didn't become some big thing amen but as soon as he was anointed things change in the life of david and then i'll say it to us today if you've got the holy ghost when you get the holy ghost your life will never be the same it cannot be the same as what it was and it will never be the same moving forward you don't stagnate you don't stay the same but god is constantly moving constantly moving constantly pulling constantly drawing constantly pushing you out and bringing himself in amen and the difference is will you go easy or will you go hard amen amen what is it it's an anointing in us that is calling us out of those things amen and here's the thing god never gives us his anointing so that we'll stand still as in it puts us into action is what i mean we've got to stand still many times scripture tells us having done all the stand stand amen you guard your position you guard your land you guard what god has given you amen but when it comes we're moving because we move as he is in the life amen so the holy spirit will continue moving us with god every single day the overcomers anointing is not stagnant it does not hold us in a place but it moves us with the word of god amen and with david we see this because there comes a day where david's sitting and he's enjoying being with the sheep and he maybe he's writing psalm 23. amen he's writing psalm 23 and then what happens is a bear comes out and all of a sudden something sweeps over david that's a little different than the last time amen because he looks and he says guess what i'm anointed to do something and the first king anointing is always to protect amen it is to take care of those that are weaker than you it is not to put dominance over them but it is to serve them by protecting them so david sees this bear come out and before i don't know what david would have done maybe he would have tried to get him away with the sling maybe he would have done whatever he could and not being able to he would have just went and told his dad dad i couldn't get it i couldn't get the lamb away from him i couldn't get the sheep away from him but after he's anointed something special happens and david says what that's my sheep and there's an anointing that sweeps over him and he goes and he beats on that bear until it lets go of the sheep now most of us would say good enough right got the sheep let's go but what happens is the bear turns on david after that so now it's not about the sheep now it's about david amen having protected his sheep now the bear wants a piece of him and most of us would say run it's the first thing we do run get out of the way you've done your job get out of the way now he wants you but guess what that anointing is still on david and what does he have he has a voice and size that fear is not i'm with you amen and then something rises up in david and says listen this is just an escalation but i'm still with you the same way i was when you beat him off of the lamb amen and what does david do david walks up and he grabs him by the beard and he kills him that's the difference between an anointed david and an unanointed david is that he'll grab a bear look it in the eyes and he'll kill it while looking into its eyes listen i don't want to be anywhere near a bear with anything less than a than a 270 rifle amen and i want to be up a tree where he can't reach me but yet david would walk up with whoever knows what he had i assume he had a knife or something and just grab them put it in and say that's it bud you're done what is it there's a moment there where david had to not just be saying amen to what was happening in the service but he had to say amen to what i am with you always amen what was it the you got to remember that in that time what did they worship they worshiped the god of abraham they worshiped the god of isaac and the god of jacob and you know what happened in that story he became the god of david amen so david wasn't just looking back at a prophet's ministry david wasn't just looking back at what joshua had done in these different things but david now experienced an anointing on him that allowed him to identify god now with his life and his purpose amen amen and then after the bear what happens we go up another tier don't we we go to a lion and the lion comes out and grabs the sheep and david does the same thing goes in beats the lion off of the sheep and the lion turns us turns around and says all right i want you now and david does the same thing listen he says if he's with me with the bear he's with me with the lion as well and he grabs that line and he does the same thing the bible says he grabs him by the mane and he kills him face to face right here look i wouldn't even want to try a man that close and he goes after a lion what is it there's an anointing on him that says that you're just fine you're where you're supposed to be david you're in obedience you've got an anointing on you to protect and you can do whatever it takes to protect what god's put in your in your hands brother brown says this he says every man or woman in here that's a christian knows that something's been on you all your life now you weren't always aware of it yeah obviously we weren't because if we were aware of it we would have lived quite differently wouldn't we especially those that aren't raised in the message amen but there was something always there when you were a child he says you longed to serve god something beat at your heart it was god's election david before anything ever happened before he'd ever had the anointing oil on him in anything he knew god was with him he killed a bear he killed a lion with that slingshot and he know that was super to an ordinary man to do that he knew what he could do and he knew that god was with him why because he killed a lion and a bear no it says he knew god was with him because his whole heart beat after god amen that's an amazing thing people seek signs and wonders as confirmation of god being with them listen signs and wonders are available to anyone with faith amen but brother braham says that he knew god was with him because his whole heart beat after god that's an amazing thing that we can take away here amen is that if your whole heart beats after god you know he's with you because that's the only way you can ever have something like that he said in the 47th psalm i believe her somewhere there as a heart penteth after the water brooks so my soul thirsts after thee oh god he says no wonder he could play the evil spirits away with his music he had something to play about you'll notice when people sing specials the ones that have an experience about what they're singing about sing the best specials don't they not the best voices necessarily not the best music but they're singing about an experience and that experience does what it projects faith through the song that they're singing and it has effect on the hearer right he had something to play about and it come from his heart the devil knew that was from his heart and he knew that david was elected of god amen so david knew the reality of god he knew the power of god he knew the saving grace of god he knew the protection of god he knew the election of god brother brahm says it was even before he was anointed king that's an amazing thing amen but i want you to catch something about this relationship and that said david never takes credit for anything that's happened in his life amen what did brother brown say humility is power with god david never goes and he says yeah i'm the world's best slingshot guy i killed a lion i killed a bear yeah man it was no big deal no what does he say the lord delivered me out of the paw of the bear and the mouth of the lion amen the lord delivered me he didn't say yeah i went in there i knew i could do it no he said the lord delivered me out of it amen i didn't go and attack he says the lord delivered me out of it i was doing my job i was staying in my post of duty and god kept me safe basically this was just an extension of his duty and he says god kept me safe through all of it this ain't about me you know david wasn't some big guy as far as we know right he's just a youth a striply a young guy but yet he kills lions and bears where most people would run him and he's not about you know superior tactics i did he didn't ambush this animal amen he said the lord delivered me out of it amen let me say this you better give credit where credit's due amen if you've got something if you've got a gift if you've got a ministry if you've got a talent whatever it might be give the credit to god because without him it will have no supernatural eternal effect on anybody amen what does the scripture say except the lord build the house right they that labor they that they labor in vain that build it amen so if we've achieved anything it's because god has granted us grace and you know what that grace is that grace is to get you out of the way so he can actually do something amen that's what it is in my life amen when when he minimizes me the best things happen that's what i found in my own life amen god has kept me from myself delivered me from my own thinking from my own thoughts right and all of a sudden something can happen because i'm not standing in his way amen listen to this this is this is uh david talking to the goliath he says then said david to the philistine thou cometh to me with a sword and a spear and with a shield but i come to thee in the name of the lord of hosts the god of the armies of israel whom thou hast defied this day will the lord deliver thee into my hand now remember what david said to saul he said what he already delivered me from the lion and the bear and so he looked and he's now up the food chain even more he's fighting a nine and a half ten foot guy with with 250 pounds of armor and weapons on him but what does david say lion bear goliath same thing right the spirit of god will tell you that it doesn't matter what's standing in front of you if it's in your way and you're supposed to be where you're standing then it has to go down amen and it doesn't matter if it takes a second if it takes an hour if it takes a week if it takes a year it's got to go down amen can i tell you a testimony it's not mine but it's a wonderful testimony a good friend of mine shared the story shared a prayer request three years ago and his son was having marital issues he serves the lord he's in the message and he was having marital issues and his wife got caught up in the joseph branham thing and she said i'm gonna leave you and go and attend that church and sit under his ministry whether you like it or not his career was in shambles he hated his job and now his wife is saying she'll leave him if he doesn't go with her so what did he do he went with her and he's just praying and he's praying and he's praying and then he gets fired from his job so now he's got his wife leading him around and he's got no job and he's saying you know you think where's god amen you know where he is today his wife has come back under his headship they've gone back to a church that believes what we need to believe and god gave him a job that he didn't apply for amen two years it took for that to happen two years and in the midst of it what do you think he's saying do you think he's thinking wow god is so real to me right now but what he had to go through the lion sequence he had to go through the bear sequence he had to go through the goliath sequence to get a reality of god amen and i guarantee you the god he serves today is far different than the god he served three months three years ago amen in his life god hasn't changed but that man's life i i guarantee you has absolutely changed because he came to the place where god stepped in and out of nothing gave him and restored him back something that i would say would never have come back amen sure you can always get a job amen but but when a wife or a woman goes out like that under that it's very rare for them to ever come back especially under you know the issues that they they have under i'll call it a cult that's what it is amen amen they go in there and they're so tied to a man they never come out from under it we've got personal experience with that in some cases amen but what he had to go through a lion experience he had to go through a bear experience he had to go through things that most people would die from their relationship with god would die out because they'd say lord what are you doing you're taking away the very things you've given me but yet god brings them through it and now he's praising the lord and his mom and dad are praising the lord they're they're old and not not in such great health and you know it wears you down and you're praying and you're wondering and you can't see them because it's coveted so he's all on his own he's all on his own going through this amen just like david with the sheep but yet what god brings them through it and now he's praising god for his grace and goodness to him amen what is it we've got to recognize that it's just one thing after the other and guess what brother bob cancer is no different than death is it right sister priscilla arthritis is no different than death blanca gallbladder trouble's no different than death amen it's just one other thing that we're going to step right through amen all it is is what god's just growing us and moving us towards that great final challenge amen what is it we'll just step in from one thing to another thing to another thing and we just got to realize it's no different it's the same anointing that's coming against us and we've got an overcomer's anointing and that means it's got to go down every single time david said this day will the lord deliver the into mine hand and i will smite thee and take thine head from thee and i will give the carcasses of the host of the philistines this day under the fowls of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth that all the earth may know there is a god in israel this was supposed to be single combat david says not only am i going to kill you but we're going to destroy the entire army and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the lord's and he will give you into our hands listen david didn't come here looking for a fight david always comes to these trials by obedience have you noticed that because what his dad pulled him from the sheep and said go and take some food and some cheeses to their captain and go to your brothers and bring them some food and see how they're doing so david's not going there with some some idea of making a big name for himself he's not going there to pick a fight he's not going there with an idea of delivering israel he's just going in obedience to what his father told him to do and then he comes there and all he sees is he sees another lion trying to take the sheep so he says hey same situation i can take care of this why because the lord will deliver him into my hand no amen what is it david's the one standing but he wasn't the one having pretensions of overcoming he said the lord's going to do this work the same way he did the line and the same way he did the bear brother brahm says it this way he says almighty god father god of heavens and earth who was with david and david knowing that he walked right out with faith lord and challenged because he knew that you were with him and his position is in you was in you amen that's the only reason he walked out was because he knew god was with him amen you have to walk into the battle but it's god that's going to do the battle for you amen you've got to be willing to walk out amen and we don't go picking a fight and then we don't go picking a fight but when he comes on our property that's when we say enough's enough and what do we do we say the lord is going to deliver you into my hand amen second samuel 22 says thou art my lamp o lord and the lord will might will lighten my darkness so god makes things plain god shows the way god moves away doubt and brings clarity god drives away the shadows but he had to experience darkness before he could experience the god of light he says for by thee i have run through a troop by my god have i leaped over a wall god gives strength for the battle protection from her even to the point of supernatural events in our lives amen but he still had to face a troop and he still had to run at the wall amen as for god his way is perfect even if it means running through a troop and over a wall the word of the lord is tried he is a buckler to all them that trust him david's saying what god does all things well and he says i've i've experienced that god does it right time and time again amen on the outside it doesn't look so great but he says what the word of the lord has tried and his way is perfect amen god never looked david alone even when it looked like david was completely forsaken remember when he's on the hill and he's completely surrounded by saul's army and what happens somebody comes to saw and says hey they're attacking and saul runs away nobody was attacking but it was just drawing them away so that david could escape time and time again the noose gets so tight around his neck and then god would just boom and he'd give him a way of escape each and every time he says for who is god save the lord and who is a rock save our god amen what david had only one place of refuge amen but he tried many things he tried hanging out with the philistines didn't he just to get a break he was willing to go sit with the enemy for a while and then he tried what lies he tried disguises he tried doing all sorts of things but he realized there's only one place i can go and by experience it was to god and god alone amen he said what god is my strength and power and he maketh my way perfect can you testify of that can you say that when god has his way then all things are perfect i can say that after 42 years i can say that many times that when it looked like it wasn't going so great but we trusted in the lord it brought it out to a perfect end each and every time even when it looks like it was hopeless even when somebody's sick even when there's not money in the bank it doesn't matter i remember when brother bob was getting our mail because we had gone away to nova scotia and we came back and we were about to go into we were about to go negative in our bank account and there was going to be a bill go out the next morning and we prayed in our car before we went into church that sunday morning how are you going to get money on a sunday morning you don't get money on a sunday morning and what happened brother bob gives us a check and it's a rebate check and we put it in there and it was just enough to cover the bill and take us to mary brown's that afternoon amen right what is it god's just looking for you listen that did not appear in brother bob's coat that day god had already prepared the answer to my prayer but what was he looking for he was looking for me to pray so that he could answer the prayer why to prove himself able to give me what i had need of in the time that i needed it amen my preference would have been to have it a week prior but god had set it up so it was just at the last minute when all hope was gone unless somebody basically came up and said brother john i felt in my heart to give you cold hard cash i was going to have an overdraft the next morning and yet god provided the way amen amen brother brahm says it this way he says and in him is the fullness in him is all the sufficiency that we have need of he is my pleasure he is my life he is my joy he is more no i don't have to puff on a cigarette to get some kind of relief i take the lily of the valley he's the opia he's the things that he's a thing that makes me walk in the clouds he is my all-sufficient he is my hopes he is my rest he is my god he is my savior he is my healer he is all that i have need of because i die we die in him and are baptized in him and in him is all sufficiency what's your need what your cries the song says is anything too hard for the lord i listen to that service in the last while what a tremendous message if you need to pick me up is anything too hard for the lord amen what's he saying is there any insufficiency in the almighty infinite god there isn't amen the scripture says he'll withhold what no good thing from those that walk uprightly listen to this he says but did you ever try to ask god to make it manifest to make it real to you not just as a historical christ but a risen christ when i listen to those tapes where brother branham's preaching and the spirit of the lord is moving guess what i want i want that same thing in my life not the gift because that was that was for him i believe but i want the moving of that same holy spirit in my life in my family's life in the church's life in the community around us amen a reality that jumps off of the page and is living in me day in and day out and the first place i wanted to have power is in me i don't want power but i wanted to have power in me amen to overcome jonathan corlett amen he says what is it not a historic historical christ but a risen christ now many people accept christ as their savior because they're afraid of hell others are afraid to die without it but have you accepted him as your lord who can stand in the innermost part of you and open up the doors of your faith and just let yourself be in his hands i'm sure if you do he will punctuate every promise in here with an amen for it's his own spirit that wrote the bible and it's here to make it say amen because he's the author of this bible we've said it many times amen doesn't just mean i i agree but amen means so be it so where when i say amen when you say amen in service are you saying it for your brother your sister sure if it applies to them but you're saying it for yourself right you're saying so be it in me i don't just wanted him brother bob i don't just want it in brother matt i don't just want it in sister lydia but i want it in jonathan corlett so i'm saying amen for me it's not selfish to say so be it in me that's what god's asking us to do is let it be real in me let it be real in each one of us individually amen what is it do we want to deliver that only delivers other people a healer that only heals other people no we want that within our own lives don't we why because otherwise it makes him their god and he never becomes my god brother brahm says why don't you just come to christ and settle the whole thing once born again that settles it forever you'll stop searching when you get the holy ghost that's an easy way you'll stop searching you'll have rest it doesn't mean you stop seeking in that you're not always that you'll you'll never look for more because you're always looking for more of god you're always looking for more of him in your life but you'll have a rest that it was settled and it's settled for eternity amen once born of the spirit of god you have everlasting life and cannot come into condemnation but a pass from death to life then you can enjoy yourself then it's a pleasure to pray you don't have to wonder about whether god's going when you kneel to pray you're right in his presence when you're walking on the streets you're right in his presence wherever you are you're in his presence all the time for you have perfect fellowship with the son of god what a marvelous victorious life what when his presence is with you always and when you're aware of it and you know it and you're resting on that halfway life is the most miserable thing there is and by the way he says there's no such thing as a halfway christian you've never seen one and you never will you know when you experience that the closest when god is calling you to give your life and you haven't given it that's the most miserable isn't it because before he calls you you'll do okay but once he starts calling you and you don't give in that's when you're miserable and i can say that by experience until i gave my heart to the lord and he was calling me to give my heart to him i was miserable and i was miserable for six years six years sitting there trying not to go to the front brother gerald and it didn't matter what sermon he was preaching i always felt conviction to go and give my heart to the lord the most miserable time 11 years old that's a bad time to be miserable all the way up till i was 17 when i gave my heart to the lord brethren says it's a marvelous victorious life but the halfway life is the most miserable thing there is what's that what's that old southern gospel song give up and let jesus take over amen that's what he's looking for he's looking for someone that says amend every word that's what he's talking about there you know what amen means you're gonna laugh you know what amen means mine mine when he says i am the lord that heals thee amen mine i am the deliverer mine i am the healer i am the one that gives you what you have need of i am the great provider what are you saying mine mine amen amen so be to me mine mine like the seagulls right mine mine everything you hear mine mine mine but guess what there's a price that comes with it being yours amen because it tastes good in the mouth but it's bitter in the belly and the reality is that you've got to go through trials and tribulations to prove out the word of god but in the meantime when it comes over that pulpit when you're you're reading your bible you're what you're saying when you say amen is you're saying that's mine right that's the possessor's cry amen mine so be it in my life that's what it's talking about amen says you've been penned up so long till you just have to get out and let your soul go a while just have to go out and have a lot of good time kind of release yourself on a vacation he's talking about people that say i just need to get away for a while now we all do i think we can all say we all need a vacation from time to time but he says brother that just shows you've never had fellowship with christ we all nodded and said we needed that and then he says we've never had fellowship with christ but what is it we need a release is really what we're talking about amen you get bottled up you get so tied up that's why it's good for us to have special meetings you know that because what you can get a different gift in same anointing different gift and guess what you can kind of just relax a bit and have something different come across the pulpit for a little bit and what just let go a little bit it's a vacation a change is as good as a vacation they say he says if a man or woman has ever had a real divine taste of fellowship with christ i'd rather have it all than the vacations and things in the world now that i can say amen to amen sure if you want to give me relaxation let me feel christ let me talk to him a little while and my burdens roll away it's all done he says no i'd rather talk to him than anything i know in the world have fellowship with them david said taste and see that the lord is good just taste it after him once and see if he isn't good he says it tastes like honey in the rock you know how you know when you're under the influence of something other than the holy ghost you're all worked up you're frustrated you're unhappy you're on the warpath you're out to get someone amen that's never the fruit of the holy spirit and it never will be amen but it shows something's wrong david didn't say read and see see sometimes that's what we're going through as we're reading and we're trying to see what we're reading he says no no no you've got to taste and see you got to put it into action you got to let it actually come into your life and have a portion there amen get something into you touch it put it in your mouth experience it is what he's saying don't just nod your head but he says take it and eat it let it become a reality right john he said go take the book and then he said you got to eat it and it's real easy to take it but it's real hard to eat it sometimes isn't it but eating it's the only way you're going to taste and see that god is good amen you can't read about god and experience god amen you've got to let him come into your life in a reality way amen what is it it's bitter in the belly like john experienced because the reality of god always takes you through trials and testing always paul says if you don't go through it then you're not a you're not a child of his you're a bastard how can you know a supernatural god unless you go through things that require a supernatural god amen how do you know a god that's going to bring light if you're not in darkness how do you know a god that delivers if you don't need deliverance how do you know a god that's a healer if you don't need healing and then the very things that define god are our trials without trials then we're just doing this happy-go-lucky life where we're rich spoiled kids is what we are but the reality of god comes through what the testing and trials that he puts us through i've read this before brother cadre diggs is the one that brought it he says now remember god has counted you worthy when you have a test now don't fail to get this when you have a trial or a test it shows the grace of god has found you you found favor with god and god believes that you'll stand the test why because what's on the other side of that test is a revelation of a reality that god is with you every time if you go through the test the way that he wants you to if you keep ducking and sliding ducking and sliding and ducking and sliding guess what god can't meet you there but if you'll walk through it willingly like david yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i'll fear no evil he had to walk through the valley of the shadow of death before he could say i had i'll fear no evil i mean he's got to go through it before he can say hey i went through it and didn't have any fear amen amen we don't have a need for god when we've got tons of money in the bank and our health is great and our relationships are great and our career is great and church is great and our ministry is great and no that's not where you're going to grow we think that if god if god cared for his bride then he would give her everything she has need of he did trials and tribulations with the power to go through it by the anointing of the holy spirit amen but what we want to when we do get a break i think sometimes we're not getting many breaks these days because it seems like you just go from one thing to the next thing to the next thing but when you get a break what's the idea keep your weapon sharp and then don't slack off then because you know what's coming over the hill you know what's coming through the tunnel don't you brother joe and it's the headlights of a very large truck right so what you've got to take that time what to get ready for the next one and then don't slack too often amen but get right get right back to it amen you want to you want your discernment to be on par for where it needs to be when the next thing comes along because satan's going to try and trick you every time we're up against a religious spirit more than anything amen that means discernment revelation is a requirement for the believer in this day look at daniel okay daniel is one that talks about my god and this is a mighty man a gifted prophet anointed to speak to the jews and to the gentiles he's a man that's known to excite spiritual warfare to get him an answer and yet in the end daniel was taken into the den of lions why what did daniel do what did daniel do to deserve to go into the lion's den from god's standpoint if i could put it that way what he's been he's been thrown to the lines for faithfully doing what god told him to do how is that fair there's no fairness in it has nothing to do with fair it has to do with the sovereignty of god amen look at daniel's life maybe 14 15 years old the the babylonians come in they take him and a couple thousand other young men just like him the best of the best the cream of the crop the the the most educated the most uh likely to succeed right and they take him out of his home they take him from his parents they take him from his pastor they take him from his church they take him from his food they take him from his home everything he's he's taken away from everything that we would expect a believer to need to succeed in this world and taken to a place where him and three others are the only ones that will stand in the end thousands and thousands of believers and yet in that place every single one of them backslid except three others plus daniel right what is it it was god proving his prophet was what it was right daniel has an experience here that very few people will have and has to go into a lion's den and come out alive the next morning david got daniel got thrown into the lion's den for praying publicly could you be thrown into the lion's den for that today i've always said it i'll say it again the to me the best way to let people know sometimes that you actually believe in something that you're not just a christian that says i'm a christian you bow your head and pray over your food that lets people know that you actually believe that there's a god to pray to in the first place amen i was in the gym the other day and a very serious prayer request came through you know what i did i bowed my head right there and i prayed and i didn't pray a 10 second prayer either right this is we're not here to just duck out and do this no i bowed my head and i prayed until i i wanted to raise my head again amen we've got to be able to stand for what we believe and not to go out and put it in front of people and try and offend them or anything but when we've got to do something for god then we do something for god regardless of what people are going to think about us amen we've got to have a boldness what does that old song dare to be a daniel dare to stand alone listen you're going to be standing alone if you haven't experienced it yet you're going to be standing alone at some point you're going to have to do what god wants you to do regardless of what people think you know how silly it looks a guy standing there over by a weight stack with his head bowed maybe people thought i was just trying to catch my breath i don't know but guess what you've got to be able to do what god calls you to do amen regardless of what people are going to think matthew 10 32 says whoever therefore shall confess me before men him why will i also confess before my father which is in heaven and daniel's a perfect example of this he didn't just go pray in his room listen daniel didn't have to pray in that window he was supposed to look towards jerusalem amen but you can look towards jerusalem in a closed window in a closed room if you want to but he opened the window and he let his voice go he wasn't going to hide the fact that he was praying to god right remember we we read that quote way back when about brother branham says if you're if you're not a part of the five full ministry you're not anointed to preach the word to handle the word so don't do it but what did he say he said give your testimony did you know daniel needed a testimony brother brahm says i'll read you the quote in just a minute but we need a testimony we don't just need to be able to tell people god sent a prophet or we believe in in a god that's here today the same way he was back then but we need a testimony that backs up what we believe otherwise we're just hot air aren't we but says this he says a living god not a dead one what good is a god that could open the red sea if he can't do the same today what good is a god that could heal a leper in the days gone by if he can't do the same today a historical god is no good if he isn't the same god today that's right he is the same god today yesterday today and forever the same one only asking the same faith that they exercised look at this in daniel 6 it says then the king arose very early in the morning and went in haste to the den of lions and when he came to the den he cried with a lamentable voice unto daniel and the king spake and said to daniel o daniel servant of the living god is thy god whom thou serve us continually able to deliver thee from the lions i like that testimony they saw no wavering in daniel's testimony from start to finish amen when he came up and they says he prayed and he prayed to god he prayed to somebody other than the king daniel didn't duck he didn't say no no no king you know me i would never lie no no no daniel owned up to it and he had never wavered prior to that and then daniel said unto the king o king live forever my god has sent his angel and has shut the lion's mouths that they have not hurt me for as much as before him innocency was found in me and also before thee o king have i done no hurt then was the king exceedingly glad for him and commanded that they should take daniel up out of the den so daniel was taken up out of the den and no manner of hurt was found upon him why because he believed in his god amen what daniel brought him what brought daniel to this place again it wasn't just listening to wasn't just reading the scrolls wasn't just going to church but it was standing in obedience to what god had called him to be and to do what god had called him to do amen he'd been put in isolation he'd been a captive like i said he only had three believing friends out of all of them they're sitting in a king's palace and i'm sure they have every temptation known to man they're from food to women to popularity to money and all these different things but daniel never partook of it and he kept himself separate from it amen and what when the time came for a trial god accepted his faith and brought him through it without a scratch on it brother brown would say it this way he says here it is every true witness of god sometimes will be put to the showdown amen will be put to a showdown to prove oh how god loves to do it when he can find a real witness and it proves god and when the lions come to destroy the prophet after he had been a true witness that there was a living god an angel perhaps of fire unfolded the veil from the b size and when they rushed to the prophet they backed away because god is a consuming fire and animals are afraid of fire when god appears he usually appears in fire and as they rush to the prophet to consume him hungry lions they saw the fire around the prophet and they stood their distance and then daniel in his trueness of the witness of the living god gave testimony the next morning that there is a real true and living god who can deliver from the lion's den now i want you to listen to this part he says he testified to it when before the trial he didn't testify after he testified before and god gave him the opportunity to what match matches testimony how by a trial daniel said i serve a living god god said let's prove it this had nothing to do with the king this had to do with daniel proving that there was a living god daniel says there's a living god god says let's prove it and then brother brown says and he proved out a hundred percent and then after the trial was over he was still standing and god had proved himself to be real through him listen daniel was a prophet but brother brahm says he was a prophet of god but now he became a witness of god so you're saying he could be a prophet and not a witness absolutely because what prophet is just a gift it's just a calling right balaam had the same thing in that what god could speak to him and he would know what to say and he could deliver the message that had nothing to do with the witness that was just being a microphone but when it comes this time now daniel gets to be a witness because now his life's on the line and it's him that's proving that it's a living god amen what is it it's about a present reality it's not just gifts and callings it's not just signs and wonders but it's god moving in people of his choosing amen it's not just a god that acts in our minds and hearts we've been changed i believe and that's a wonderful thing but nobody knows that except us but when we see him acting and moving in our lives that's when they get to see the reality of god amen we get so caught up in being spiritual sometimes that we forget that god promised to be literal healing is literal right deliverance is literal provision is literal amen when he says i'm going to provide for you whether he does it by money whether he does it by somebody helping you out whatever it is it's still a literal action we are the still the hands and feet of god and god will still create things out of thin air but it's still a literal manifestation of a supernatural god amen and sometimes sometimes we forget it what is that saying you're you're so spiritual you're of no earthly good well guess what god is not so spiritual that he is of no earthly good because most of the promises of god are earthly they are a manifestation in our body their manifestation in our lives they're not just ideas and thoughts and something in the e3 man you look at the three hebrew children amen what brought them to the point of being in front of an angry king and refusing to bow down to the image what is it daniel's not there to protect them it's sad i don't know that it's true that perhaps the image was of daniel himself that they turned into prophet worship but either way daniel wasn't there we know and the three of them are standing there the prophet's gone there's nobody there to protect him there's nobody to say come on king daniel was it was over everybody if he said king come on now let's you know what we are you know what we stand for we've been through this i've been through the lines then just let us go no no they had to stand on their own two feet each one of them amen what they didn't have that profit there to back them up but what did they do they're christians they're believers so they just stay with the word regardless didn't they listen sometimes we go out looking for trials we don't think we do but we do and what is it we go looking to get noticed we go looking to be different we go looking to stand out and you'll see mostly that in social media these days and you go out and all of a sudden people start disagreeing with you and you think that you're what being persecuted you're not being persecuted you just went unpicked a fight and predictably there are other people that disagree with you and so they started fighting with you you're not going out and claiming your property you're going out and picking a fight which is what it is amen but there they didn't do that amen amen in those situations you go and pick that you're unwise you're you're picking a fight thinking you're standing up for god they weren't picking a fight with the king when they stood in front of him and said we won't bow they were picking a fight they just said we can't do that because i'm because we're believers that's all there was to it they weren't debating or anything like that they just said look we can't do it going out to try and prove we're different is never what's going to save somebody amen right so often today we want us we want to just be this this glowing this huge light and guess what that's never what we're called to do not in that sense look at the way brother branham says he says now just be yourself simple humble waiting for the coming of the lord now we don't believe in glamour something shining you know i always said hollywood shines but christianity glows there's a lot of difference between shining and glowing hollywood shines with great class and society and glamour but a christianity glows with humility the way up is always down he says now i trust that everyone will be filled with the holy spirit and now before you can be filled with this holy spirit you've got to die to yourself first in order to be born again so what loud boisterous flashy talkative that was never the way of christ you look at christ it says there was nothing on him that made us like him when we looked at him visually he wasn't a good lucky man he wasn't tall muscular didn't have the greatest deltoids in the message right here's just a normal man just look like anybody nothing special about him he didn't have this great booming voice he didn't have this the the big stature you know he wasn't a great orator necessarily scripture says there was nothing that would draw us to him in terms of his physicality or or his features or these things amen but he just sat there and he spoke to people at their level he was humble great god jehovah in a man's body a perfect image of god is sitting there speaking and there's no flash or boisterity about about christ amen and yet we'll go out there and we'll be that loud and boisterous and we'll be we'll be pushy and we'll be looking for a fight and that was never it listen peter had to get the new birth so that he could get that spirit off of him peter was always looking remember when jesus said he was just about to go to the garden and he says he's talking about something that's completely unrelated he says you'll need some swords and peter says hey we got swords that's what peter was good for bringing a sword that was it but when he got the new birth we never see peter or zealot again we never see peter going and picking fights do we why because he had the new birth there was a different spirit that was driving him now amen can you imagine it struck me as funny as i was thinking about this these young these three hebrew children they're they're standing in front of the king and he says listen if you don't do what i say i'm gonna burn you do you know what they'd be doing today they'd be on their phone tag right they'd be on their phone they'd be saying hashtag we won't bow right and they'd be on twitter and they'd be tweeting and they'd be on facebook and they'd be on on instagram and they'd be saying what call them call the press bring them here it's going down they're gonna burn us right we're immigrants it's racist what he's doing workplace harassment religious persecution guys come on bring the cameras up watch what's going to happen right drawing a big thing to themselves that's what happens today isn't it people want to bring the news in they want to they want to bring a spotlight on their little trial their little difficulty it's amazing what i see when i when i dare venture on the cbc and they have the littlest stories of people and they elevate them to great big mountains until something happens right what is it everybody thinks they've got to have everybody doing something for them but look at these three then nebuchadnezzar and his rage and fury commanded to bring them and they brought these men before the king and he spake and said unto them is it true oh shadrach meshach and abednego do you not serve my gods nor worship the golden image which i have set up and shadrach meshach and abednego answered and said to the king o nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter if it be so our god whom we serve they had a reality even before then that this was their god is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thy hand o king but if not be it known unto thee o king that we will not serve thy gods nor worship the golden image with thou set up so they're saying you know just because we're getting close to the fire and our clothes are starting to melt and our eyebrows are starting to go away we're not going to change then right when the fire gets hot when things get very tough we're not going to bow to your image then doesn't matter what happens if he delivers us great if he doesn't deliver us great but we're sticking with the word that's what they're saying here amen but listen to what brother branham says here this is a absolutely phenomenal quote he says here's the words that they had god was so real to them they said our god is able how about that the fellow didn't believe that don't believe in divine healing god is able to deliver us come these fiery furnace but will not bow down to your images and when they walked into the fiery furnace upon bare sheer faith that god was able not promised but he was able that's a big difference they had no promise walking in but they said he's able but even if he doesn't we're walking in no matter what and god sent christ in the fiery furnace and fanned the fire away from them and protected them and brought them out sure but i'm saying god is able now watch this transition here watch this transition because nobody in history had walked through the fire that way certainly one that was seven times hotter nobody had ever done it they said god is able but there was no promise there was no past experience they could draw on they couldn't say well joshua went through this so we can go through it we serve the same no no no they said worry in a trial that's particular to us nobody's ever faced it we believe he can do it but if he doesn't it won't change whether or not we serve him but watch this transition brother branham makes he says now you don't come saying god is able you don't have to come that way god you promised amen you prepared it at calvary and i've come to receive it it's your preparation you provided it you promised it i see others receiving it so i come to lord to get my part of it you'll go away a different person you'll go away with such an anchor inside your soul then nothing can upset you you know that you're healed you know that god has taken care of this matter for you because he has promised amen the world has plenty of images out there for you to bow down to if you want to and then we've talked about many of them current events entertainment social justice movements p female empowerment and feminism politics alternative lifestyles career fixation amen if you're involved with any of them what is it god can't have a reality in your life like you're looking for because you're bowed down to another image you can try all you want and i see believers doing it they try and fit it into the word of god it has no place in our life amen it is not a focus for a believer none of it none of it none of it jesus refused to get drawn into it why are we getting drawn into it amen there's a quote i'll bring in the next service lord william where brother brown says we've got a new president coming in we've got a new president coming he says all i care about is that he is coming amen that's what we're caught up in is not who's a president not who's a prime minister we're carrying about what who's coming in a rapturing and who's going to take us away that's where our concern is that's what we're supposed to be talking about amen the rest of it's a twisted up mess and somehow we're thinking that we can untwist it if we just get in there with our christian values guess what it's satan's kingdom it's not for ours to be untwisting amen why would we ever work in his kingdom we're working for a kingdom that is to come amen it's not of this world in the first place amen love and love and kindness have never grown on social media all the studies say that it thrives on discord disagreement and partial truths and what does it do it turns people into polarized minions that can't remember they're supposed to be a christian i can't tell you how many people i had a a man that i knew by by name and by reputation i never met him he has to be a friend of mine on facebook i said sure and all i saw from him was trump trump trump and then he got racist with an arab and he was doing this and that the other thing this is a man that's a a worship leader in a church and he's saying these sorts of things and you know what i did i just took him right off of my feet because why that has no place in a christian's life amen and he was saying and doing things that i would have been ashamed of an unbeliever to say much less a christian and how many times i can't tell you that people have asked to be a friend on there or that they've linked up with me in some way and i end up just shutting it off because i can't stand to see their their reputation besmirched as a as a believer because of the things they're putting on social media it's ridiculous and then we got to be careful even in a professional environment and then you're going to face it and i'm sure most of us have faced it at some point where you got to stand up for what you believe and not to make a big thing about it right not to call the news and say this is my religion no no no i'm a believer i'm a christian this is the way i live my life and this is what i'm going to do and this is what i'm not going to do whether it's not going into a bar when everybody else goes into a bar when you're traveling or whether it's saying listen i'm not going to sit on this meeting because this is something that i just can't i can't get in line with what and if you're if you're gentle about it usually they'll they'll respect you sometimes they won't and then you just have to say them we're gonna have to disagree and just move on amen what does the scripture say after the first or second admonition move on and i find that's what's happening so much again with the social media side is we're not moving on after the first or second admonition but we're going and going and going and going like it's somehow going to make a difference and it just won't like the king you're just going to end up angering them amen then was nebuchadnezzar full of fury in the form of his visage was changed against shadrach mesa meshach and abednego therefore he spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was want to be heated and he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind shadrach meshach and abednego and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace then these men were bound in their coats their hoses and their hats and their other garments and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace therefore because the king's commandment was urgent in the furnace exceeding hot the flames of the fire slew those men that took up shadrach meshach and abednego then these three men shadrach meshach and abednego fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace and then nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished and rose up in haste and spake and said to his counselors did not we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire the answer and said unto the king true o king he answered and said lo i see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt and the form of the fourth is like the son of god it's amazing that a king like that could recognize the son of god and yet he could come and walk the earth and the priest could never recognize him then nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and spake and said sharach meshach abednego ye servants of the most high gog come forth and come hither then shadrach meshach and abednego came forth of the midst of the fire now i read that it's a very familiar scripture but i wanted to take it as a type because guess what we walk into a lot of fires as believers we walk into a lot of fires not because we chose but because we have to and guess what we go through fires that would destroy most people that would destroy most marriages that would destroy most relationships that would destroy most careers and that would destroy most churches and we walk out not not even bound anymore but loose and with what the presence of the living god in the midst of us why because we stood on the word and people take notice when you go through a life-changing disease you go through cancer you go through something like that and guess what you walk through and you come out and guess what you're sweeter than you ever were right when when you go through a trial in your relationship you go through a trial in your marriage maybe you go through bankruptcy maybe you go through a year without bus without work brother matt and guess what you don't come out bitter at the world you don't come out bitter at god amen your marriage worked its way through it your kids were happy most people would never have known that you went through such a trial because you came out so completely unchanged except that god took a couple things off of you that you went in with amen that's the kind of testimony that believers have as we walk through things that other people will be destroyed by and we come out and we're the better for it why because we've got to be purified and that's all those things are doing for us as it doesn't destroy us it destroys the things that we don't need and it leaves the purity of god within us amen when i was studying this what struck me is that we're inoculated with the holy spirit that's what brings us through those things you know we talk about vaccines and these different things now you know what takes you through that it's the vaccine of the holy spirit amen that allows you to go through trials and tribulations that would destroy mere humans and you come out and yet you're a better person because of it not a worse person amen when i was studying this service i was i was i searched the phrase real expression real experience in the message and you know what i found the most consistent or the most common factor of all those was a story that brother branham talks about when he's talking about hunting with bert remember the guy that had the the the mean eyes the the the slits for eyes and he just he he had no good things to say about bird as a man remember he said burt liked to shoot the babies right or the does and and and when he was doing that burt had made that special call if you remember that sounded just like a baby deer and what he was doing was trying to get a mother doe out there so he could shoot her because he knew brother branham hated it when he did it the only reason he was doing it was because he knew brother branham hated him doing it in the first place amen but so they're sitting there and they're taking a break and he just makes that call and what is it what does brother bram say he says a doe a mama dear she stands up and makes herself known makes her presence known he says in a time when they won't do that because they've been hunted so hard they know the pressure's on they know it's dangerous he says but she stood up and she just looked at us in full view he says and that is what made bert say lead me to this jesus you talking about what was it he saw somebody that was real an animal not even a human but he saw an animal that reacted to something that was within her and she put her life willingly on the line because greater was in her than what she would have wanted to do amen that's what the believer has it's something that's greater in us that'll put us in the line of fire that will put us willingly into a battle that'll put us willingly through a trial because we know that there's something in us that's forcing us to go through it amen and we willingly step into it but you know what struck me with all that that mother doe wasn't trying to be a hero she was just doing what was in her to do right she wasn't trying to stand out she wasn't trying to be special quite the opposite if she had her way she wouldn't have moved a muscle but something inside of her made her stand up and be counted because her baby needed her and that was more important than her life at that time amen she was just being what was inside her and she couldn't help it i want to bring one little one last thought here by way of a couple quotes and brother brahm says now we find out when paul got converted and had this real experience he was absolutely turned around and you know conversion means to be turned around you're going this way and you start and you turn back this way yes sir it's a turn around and about face and paul as soon as he was converted before he could ever make his experience now he had a marvelous experience now i believe when you accept christ just as your personal savior it's an experience i believe the joy of knowing your sin is forgiven just thrills your heart through and through but then when the blessed holy spirit comes down that's an experience that's a new birth that you'll never forget you become a child of god and here is what it does how do you know it brother branham he says now these are teaching lessons so you see after all it is the experience of passing from death to life now listen to this when all the old things die and all things become new christ becomes real you say brother john i'm seeking a greater reality in my life let the old things die what old things are you holding on to that are keeping the new things from coming through let the old things go that the new can grow the old things drop away the old roots of carnality you know how to dig a root out we used to take a grubbing hoe and just get down at it and dig it till there wasn't a speck left in it and they said if there be any root of bitterness spring up unto you grubber out he says that's right and that's what the holy spirit does is root out all the roots digs them out piles it up burn them get rid of them he says you got a good crop then if you do that but what you got to dig up all the old stuff you got get got to get rid of all the old stuff first amen but i wanted to stop here and say something because sometimes we forget we think we're in a message home and i'm speaking to the young people in particular we think well i'm a good kid i certainly thought that and then and we think well i've been listening to the message all my life and so i go and i get baptized and so i just continue on with my walk with god but the thing you have to remember is that you've been listening all those years without the holy ghost and so you come in with an idea of religion you're coming in with an idea of the relationship with god you come in with an idea of what it means to be a real christian you have an idea what it means to be this and that and the other thing listen i said it before i thought people in this church were hypocrites before i got saved why because satan is the accuser of the brethren and until i had the holy ghost then i was under the influence of satan most of the time wasn't i so i'd look at people and what would i see the hinder parts rather than the godly parts so it just depends where you're looking at amen but if we were all honest we'd say i'm a hypocrite i profess one thing and i do other things because paul did it so i'm gonna i'll put myself there with paul every time amen so what i could see was a hypocrite but i couldn't see a child of god but as soon as i get saved all of a sudden i'm so busy looking at myself that i don't see the failures in brother mark amen are the failures of brother david or the many failures in our pastor we all have many failures brother gerald can take that kind of talk that's why i said it amen but what is it is i had to have something happen and that's that the mind of christ had to be put in my head now and it had to be put as a filter in my heart so that everything that i thought now i don't throw it away but now i'm running it through a new filter and the filter is not jonathan corlett the religious boy the filter is now the mind of christ in me with the holy spirit running it through the word and so that completely changed the way i looked at people completely changed the way i looked at people and it made me look at myself a whole lot more and it made me look at people a whole lot less because when you do that you start to recognize that god's got to do a whole lot of work in you to get you into a place where you can go in a rapture not because you're good but because you've surrendered because he's cleaned you out because he can say you've got gold that's been tried in the fire you've got character of christ in your life amen so you still have to die this is what he's saying he's saying you can get baptized and you can have all your sins taken away and there's joy in that but he says that's not when the old things die it's when the holy ghost comes in and it roots out all of that stuff amen you can do the rest you can go justification that's baptism go out okay my sins are taken away sanctification clean up my life but until you get something that comes in and fills and does a real work of it then you're not going to get anywhere because you'll never dig deep enough compared to what the holy spirit will do in your life i mean if you've ever had something taken out you can say that with assurance that i didn't go far enough and it took god in my life to dig those things out to the point where i never had to deal with them again where i have a total and complete victory in my life over the things that used to drive me nuts and that that can happen 10 15 20 30 years into your relationship with god because he's constantly moving and digging moving and digging moving and digging opening doors cleaning them out going to the next door cleaning it out going to the next door cleaning it out so that what the fruit of the spirit can come out because otherwise what we do is we start on the same foundation as the rich young ruler says listen i've done everything but all he had was a church experience didn't he right the life the word is standing right there in front of him and he's done everything the word says but then the word stands in front of him and says do something you don't want to do and he says i can't do it the laodicean mindsets that they're rich increase with goods and have need of nothing spiritually spiritually we have it physically and i think we get caught up in that sometimes is the idea that well we have it all i have a car i have a house i have a good paying job i don't have a ton of debt to death to death that's not the lay of the seeing spirit that's been the spirit forever that's nothing new to laodicea but it's that they're spiritually you know they think they're spiritually rich amen and it's because they don't give themselves into the holy spirit amen as i've said before the prophet said in the in the church age book that the zeal of the laodicean church ages to repent and the thing is if you don't if you think you have it all what do you have a need to repent of that's the problem is if you think you've got it all if you think that you're all that in a bag of chips as we used to say if we're so busy admiring our christianity and then what are we going to repent of we're so busy admiring ourselves in the mirror that we're not looking in the mirror of god's word and saying whoa whoa that doesn't match up lord help me again amen what is it it's the epitome of having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof because the power that so many people are seeking starts first in your own life and secondly god will use it for other people's benefit amen think of paul paul pharisee the pharisees said unto camille listen if there was somebody that knew the word it was paul and yet as soon as he got converted he had to go to the desert for over three years so that the holy spirit could go and rearrange his mind to think the thoughts of god rather than pull it through his religious his religious life before that he was a great scholar of the scriptures already and yet the the holy spirit had to take him back there and teach him how to actually look at it god's way instead of his own way brother brahm says but when we not in an imaginary way but we prostrate ourselves before a living god a living virtue a living knowledge a living patience a living godliness a living power coming from a living god makes a living man a living image in the stature of god that's a lot of living in there living virtue that strength knowledge patience godliness and power coming from a living god makes a living man a living image in the image of god and the stature of god what's he doing the same things that jesus did walking the same way he walked doing the same things he did because it's not an imaginary thing there's a reality that's proven the thing that's been on my heart the thing i'm praying for is a greater reality in my life amen and i believe there's many others that have impr you know in conversation and fellowship i i think that there's a lot of us praying that way amen that we're looking for more of god and that more of god's got to start in our life before it starts working on the things that are external to us amen he's wanting more of us before he can act in the things that are in our life amen the situations we're in i'm not looking for great sermons i'd love to have i'd love to be a an amazing minister with tremendous sermons but the most important sermon that brother brown said we could ever live is that of a life of an overcomer amen we've got to be living sermons amen living voices as i as i read in a quote some time ago amen to where god can be expressed in every part of me that's what i'm looking for every part nothing held back listen to this as we start to close he says i tell you peter preached a sermon on the day of pentecost and three thousand souls were saved and the devil never even moved out of his bed this is the start of the the most powerful church up to the rapturing church in this age and he says the devil never even moved out of bed at that first instant three thousand souls saved the outpouring of the holy spirit he says and and the devil never moved that's right oh well let them alone see but he passed through the gate called beautiful the next day and healed a man and crippled from his mother's womb and all hell turned loose on him that's right he throwed him in the jail and kept him there overnight yes sir put him into prison the inner cell there because of the phenomenal the devil said i can't let this thing get started now to find healing if they do they will really knock my props out from under me that's right because i might fool them around with the little theology once in a while but i sure can't fool that real thing that comes out and people see it done i'll just stop this before that other group gets on the scene amen you're fighting for deliverance healing take note of this the devil doesn't care about the great sermons doesn't care like about the great sermons amen but he cares about people that throw him out of their lives first by your own obedience and second by the power of god amen that's all he cares about he doesn't care if you go to church every day of your life if me and brother joe preach three sermons a day three square meals right if we came every day three times a day he doesn't care a lick about that amen but he says when you throw him out of your life that's when he starts to care about it amen he says he never stopped it then and he can't stop it now that's right god's gospel will move on and on and on and on and when there's no more heavens or no more earth that word would still remain the same for heavens and earth will pass away but my words shall never pass away it can't pass away that word is just as immortal as god is himself it can't pass away and i believe every word of it all the things that jesus was he is now and always will be that's right he's the same yesterday today and forever he's praying this prayer and just once more he says god bring us back to the holy ghost and power and the manifestation of the word once more lord once more he says do you believe it lord god once more once more let me see the presence of jesus christ walking through the church let me see his power and his promise may manifest before us once more lord once more god be merciful and help us you see what these other things get us it drives away the nature of christ out of the congregation out of the church out away from this people we should be so woven together that there would be nothing separate us from this word and our love one for another jesus christ is here he is our father he is our mother he is my healer he is my king he is my god he is my life he is my joy he is my peace all that there is he is for me he is my all in all he is here now he wants to bring the church back to that place he says here the person christ jesus produces the real thing and keeps that person secured in christ until he comes the person christ jesus that means he's personal amen right it's not the person to a group it's a person to a person i mean it's something that comes down personal to you it's not just doctrines i mean it's not just sermons it's not just messages by a prophet but it's a bridegroom himself stepping into your life and drawing you close to him and changing you growing you stretching you healing you delivering you leading you guiding you encouraging you correcting you restoring you redeeming you back to what he saw before time even began and then god's not wanting to stay on the pages of our bibles amen that kills the letter kills but the spirit is what gives life amen and he wants to live what in the fleshly tables of our hearts where we live him and breathe him and we're in expectation for brother brother braham says it was that wonderful victorious life was to know that his presence is with you always not when you feel it or not only when you feel it but because you have that holy spirit inside of you that he is always there and with you when you have a need amen i was talking to my wife a while back and and i was saying i don't know what people's lives are like when it comes to their walk with god and take this this is no ego here but i said it brother gerald you were talking about it over the surface the other day and you said you know when you're in your car you're thinking about him and when you're walking down the street you're thinking about him and when you're sitting and this and that and the other thing and sometimes at the oddest of times that's exactly what's happening is that what there's god that's trying to deal with us and all he's looking for us to do is get the distractions away and then turn the screens off turn the phone off get away for a little bit and just dwell with him that's all he's looking for you know what he rarely comes to me when i've got things buzzing in my head but if i can just be quiet driving in my car music no music it doesn't matter if i'm in a spirit of worship you know what he draws near right if i'm just listening for entertainment guess what that doesn't bring god on the scene but if i'm in a spirit of worship if i'm listening to the right things if i'm playing the right things if i'm doing those right things if i'm clearing out the clutter then what happens is he can draw so clear so fast right he just draws in close because there's nothing there to get between you right remember brother branham talked about he says the crying of a baby could cause the holy spirit to not be present what things do we have in our life so often that would push that dove of the holy spirit away because we want this reality but are we setting ourselves up for the reality david was there by obedience amen and that's the first thing that we're supposed to do is obey right separate ourselves and be in obedience to that word every single time amen how do you make them your god put them first he's only your god if he's first if he's second then he's not your god because god is first and foremost the object of worship he's the preeminence in your life amen and if he's not first then how can he be your god scripture says seek ye first the kingdom of god you know talking with joe about his business he's had to learn that you got to seek god first in in my schooling i remember i would never miss a service didn't matter how many exams i had the next day i wouldn't miss a service because if i'd done my part i knew that he would do the part to get me through that exam the next day amen why it's putting the kingdom of god first it's giving him the opportunity to actually step into my life so often we're sitting there and we've got our life so jam-packed and we're saying god come and show yourself real and he's saying where that you've got no room for me you've got no room for me and so it's half the time he's got to give you a a beating of a trial just to get you to give him some room to get you desperate enough to push something out of your life to allow him in there to make himself a little more real into your life now he's going to do trials and tribulations come no matter what we know that and that's the grace of god as we read amen but the idea is to is to allow him the place not to have him force the place into your life amen i found for me if he's not being personal it's because i'm not listening i'm not honest or i think it's a man speaking instead of my pastor right because he's given us a five-fold ministry for the perfecting of the saints and he's given us a word that'll do the work if we'll listen so the only thing that often will hold me back aside from that is when i think i'm more than i'm not or i'm unwilling to to allow myself the possibility that i might have some work left in my life to do amen what is it i love the sermons where it seems like god's just talking to me you know why one shows he cares amen when god comes in and he touches that little or big spot in your life and he just goes right there for a little bit you say ow ow ow and you know that minister knows nothing about it that's the best sermon because you know that god is moving on your behalf and that service do what try and get you to a place where he can use you amen i think people give the ministry more more than they deserve many times they think we know things and we really don't have a clue as in we don't have a clue by knowledge in that sense amen but the other thing that i love about that is when he ever comes my way he's always calling me higher i mean let's stand as i just start to close here whenever he comes my way he always calls me higher man he doesn't put me down and then it's satan that puts you down isn't it it's satan that puts you down without a way to come back up but all god's saying is if you'll let this go i can take you further i mean if you can open up your life i can take you further if you'll just trust me i can show you a greater reality but as long as you cling and hold to things so tightly i can't do anything with you amen it's like we talked about that that old wine and new vessels you can't do that your your experience has to grow with you and then you i can't jump up to brother mark's level i can't jump up to brother uh gerald's level i can't jump up to brother bob's level i've got to go through it the way everybody else does and that's by a life experience where god can grow and change me in those things amen it's not this doctrinal checklist we're not going to make a rapture because we believe serpent seed and because we believe godhead and because we believe this and that the other thing that's got to be there and it's got to be a part of it and we'll get into that in the next service lord willing as to why it had to be there but he's looking for a people that will surrender themselves fully to his word and step out in faith and just watch him meet it amen that's the reality of god that i'm looking for is where i say lord i believe and he says then i'll do it that's all we're looking for because listen we're not going to take a rapture of our own making we're not going to heal ourselves we're not gonna make ourselves better people because we decide to do it in man it takes a working of god my wife and i were talking the other day and we had our 21st anniversary as many of you know and and we're we're at the meal and she said you know it was around the time i was 30 years old she says you know what she said i really felt that was where you being so disciplined kicked in because you made such a a big shift there and some certain things in our marriage and i said that wasn't discipline i said if it was discipline i would have done it a long time ago in all probability but god had to make a change in my life and i said the only way i could ever do that is make is have him make the change because i can't decide to make a change in my life i can make myself more romantic by booking things into this schedule as we talked about right but that doesn't change me that just gives me some things to make her feel better amen and these different things but god had to do a work in me and that had to start with me saying i don't have what i need to have i need to step up to a higher plane i need a greater experience i need a greater surrender i need some rooting done in my life i mean i need the holy spirit to go in and pull some things out so that god can plant something that'll bring some real fruit in my life amen that's a humbling experience to do that but it's the only way to know god is to let him actually do something so often i find that we resist in order to stay where we're at what kind of sense does that make we sit here and we're halfway off times on something we're halfway to surrender and we're we're halfway to holding onto the wheel and all we've got is a battle going on and where are we going nowhere we're fighting to stay where we're at and all he's saying is let go just let go and see where god can take you amen amen let's bow our heads together heavenly father lord i pour my heart out this evening lord for you see the prayer of my heart lord i believe it's the the prayer of the heart of every believer that's here this evening lord is that they want a greater reality of you in their life heavenly father and lord i believe many of us have had experiences many experiences lord but we can say you are my god amen lord i believe that without a doubt i can raise my hand and say lord that you have been a reality in my life heavenly father but lord when i look at the word and i see the promises lord i see the requirement of your word i see the image that it paints therefore lord i know there's so much more that needs to come out of my life heavenly father and so lord i pray the power of your holy spirit would have free reign in myself lord in each one that's under the hearing of my voice this evening heavenly father lord that as we would humble ourselves lord as we would be honest lord and in sincerity approach you lord that you would give us the reality that we seek lord that you would give us a rest lord that you would help us to stop fighting that you would help us to stop trying lord that we would just sit back and by faith rest and trust the working of your holy spirit in our life lord by the washing of the water of the word lord touch your people once again we pray in jesus
