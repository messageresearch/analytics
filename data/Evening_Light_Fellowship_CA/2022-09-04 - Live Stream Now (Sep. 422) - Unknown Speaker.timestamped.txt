[1:15:29] Wesley's age the Pentecostal age amen it
[1:15:33] is the grace of God in the bright age
[1:15:34] amen and was by grace through faith that

[1:23:29] Southern Jordan amen praise the Lord and
[1:23:32] other issues right there but then we

[1:24:11] when we even when we cross the border
[1:24:13] and we're between Israel and Jordan
[1:24:15] there the spirit of the people that we
[1:24:17] were dealing with dealing with it was so
[1:24:19] different
[1:24:19] oh they were just um
[1:24:22] they weren't friendly
[1:24:24] no no but when we got when we moved out
[1:24:27] of that that and on into Israel
[1:24:31] the atmosphere changed and the people
[1:24:33] that we were meeting those that were
[1:24:36] working there and and to welcome you

[1:24:41] smiling and oh one welcome back good to

[1:24:55] that after the truth to God be the glory

[1:25:03] from that's where we're going amen back
[1:25:06] to Glory again with our Lord Jesus
[1:25:08] Christ amen so again brother just to
[1:25:11] remind you of verse verse 30.
[1:25:15] one
[1:25:17] therefore watch and remember
[1:25:21] that by the space of three years I cease
[1:25:24] not to warn everyone night and day with
[1:25:27] tears amen God bless his word you may be
[1:25:30] seated term with me to Second
[1:25:33] Corinthians chapter 11.
[1:25:36] second Corinthians chapter 11.
[1:25:39] amen
[1:25:40] I'll try not to be too long we will see
[1:25:45] well we get to Eternity
[1:25:47] we won't feel we won't feel bored
[1:25:51] amen
[1:25:53] and in second Corinthians chapter 11 and
[1:25:56] beginning to read at verse 13.
[1:26:02] and just to share some thoughts with you
[1:26:06] concerning the messenger the message and
[1:26:08] the end
[1:26:10] amen
[1:26:12] what the messenger is pointing to the
[1:26:13] what the message is pointing to amen and
[1:26:16] what we're experiencing
[1:26:18] and in second Corinthians 11 and verse
[1:26:21] 13 for such a false Apostles deceitful
[1:26:25] workers transforming themselves into the
[1:26:28] Apostles of Christ and no marble for
[1:26:31] Satan himself is transformed into an
[1:26:33] angel of Light beyond your guard
[1:26:37] amen
[1:26:39] and therefore it is no great thing if
[1:26:42] his ministers also be transformed as the
[1:26:45] Ministers of righteousness whose end
[1:26:47] shall be according to their works and
[1:26:51] brother
[1:26:53] we'd sometimes would would apply that
[1:26:55] maybe just to denominations and and to
[1:26:58] this out there and that religious and
[1:27:00] this religion there and so on but
[1:27:02] brother we're experiencing these things
[1:27:03] even now around the message
[1:27:05] Amen brother exactly but because the
[1:27:09] same spirits that were there listen
[1:27:10] brother when it comes to Jesus brother
[1:27:13] it wasn't out there somewhere among the
[1:27:15] scribes and the Pharisees it was right
[1:27:17] among the disciples
[1:27:19] amen
[1:27:20] and it was it was even even Judas and he
[1:27:23] was he was considered a disciple and
[1:27:25] brother he was considered oh well they
[1:27:28] said would you consider would you choose
[1:27:30] Jesus or Judas as the disciple and so on
[1:27:33] I don't think I got it here let's see I
[1:27:36] did have got it in there she and
[1:27:37] expressing what why they would choose
[1:27:39] this one why you would choose that one
[1:27:41] but amen they felt that they wouldn't
[1:27:44] add this one as a disciple no wouldn't
[1:27:46] have that one why but but Judah said all
[1:27:50] the positive attitudes
[1:27:51] see so brother sister God help us
[1:27:55] amen so we're not going to choose Judas
[1:27:58] choose Jesus
[1:28:00] amen by the grace of almighty God
[1:28:03] because I tell his brother Brown said
[1:28:05] even the even the so-called
[1:28:06] judaistarians he said they're they're
[1:28:08] going to be among us he said and they're
[1:28:10] going to be there to deceive us
[1:28:12] yeah he said they'll be there well he
[1:28:15] warned us and he referred to them as
[1:28:17] judicitarians
[1:28:19] oh yeah somewhere somebody one of the
[1:28:21] books there I I met one of the message
[1:28:24] books I read it and he warned us to vote
[1:28:26] the judicitarian spirit
[1:28:28] and brother we're dealing with that and
[1:28:30] since I've been in the message for the
[1:28:31] last almost 50 years that and you see
[1:28:34] you've been around the message for 50
[1:28:35] years well I came to the message and in
[1:28:38] 1966
[1:28:40] so as many many many years ago and
[1:28:43] brother we've been dealing with many
[1:28:44] spirits even back then and I remember
[1:28:47] even when I when I first preached it
[1:28:50] just 18 years old and we were gathered
[1:28:53] in a church in central Newfoundland and
[1:28:56] the the pastor there asked me to get up
[1:28:58] and speak and that's the first time I
[1:28:59] ever spoke publicly
[1:29:01] amen and I was I was about 18 years old
[1:29:04] because we were going to see the film of
[1:29:06] brother Branham and we're waiting back
[1:29:08] then you had to wait till it got dark
[1:29:10] and uh we're waiting till it got dark so
[1:29:12] we could watch the films so the brother
[1:29:15] got up and he said I'm going to ask our
[1:29:16] brother here now and uh because I was
[1:29:19] visiting them from from St John's and he
[1:29:21] said I'm going to ask our young brother
[1:29:22] he said from St John's to come up and
[1:29:24] speak for a few minutes he said until it
[1:29:26] gets dark
[1:29:27] and so on so that's when I got up and
[1:29:30] and ministered to him concerning the
[1:29:32] message of the hour and even back then
[1:29:34] brother I would I felt that I was
[1:29:36] dealing with with certain Spirits
[1:29:38] denominational Spirits amen and oh well
[1:29:41] they all profess to believe the message
[1:29:43] well so does the devil
[1:29:46] and I kept I I've been challenging them
[1:29:49] ever since ever since all the Believers
[1:29:51] and say you believe us as soon as the
[1:29:53] devil I said he has come down with great
[1:29:55] rat knowing his time is short so I said
[1:29:58] I already know which time is short I
[1:30:00] said by the word
[1:30:01] now you know it's time to short by the
[1:30:03] message I said he sees this he see that
[1:30:05] and your profession to see it so I said
[1:30:07] you better you better make sure your
[1:30:09] anointing is Right amen by the grace of
[1:30:12] almighty God
[1:30:14] and just saying he he was a part he came
[1:30:16] and he deceived even even the disciples
[1:30:19] two thousand years ago amen when he
[1:30:21] betrayed Jesus and he betrayed Jesus now
[1:30:23] amen and brother Branham preached the
[1:30:26] message I in the indictment I indict
[1:30:28] this generation for the second
[1:30:30] crucifixion of Christ brother I can

[1:30:46] amen it is Jesus influence even around
[1:30:49] the message amen that many message
[1:30:51] Believers are crucifying Jesus and
[1:30:54] crucifying his influence in their lives
[1:30:57] amen that's right it's crucified the the
[1:31:00] influence of Jesus Amen in the bride of
[1:31:03] Christ amen they judge oh they're
[1:31:06] they're well just lowering it and and
[1:31:08] and undermining the the the the the

[1:41:51] justification oh they were experiencing
[1:41:54] justification justification and he went
[1:41:57] all around everywhere preaching
[1:41:58] preaching preaching oh yes and as I said
[1:42:01] it was either Luther or what Wesley was
[1:42:03] it he would go down to the mines where
[1:42:04] the where the men would go into the
[1:42:06] minds of work and come out and and he
[1:42:08] would be there to preach to those that
[1:42:09] were going in and then he'd wait for the
[1:42:11] Elder to come out and preach to them and
[1:42:13] he preached John Wesley he preached five
[1:42:16] times a day
[1:42:18] and we oh
[1:42:21] don't mean to offend
[1:42:24] oh yeah one time we meet every day we
[1:42:27] meet we'd have service every night
[1:42:29] oh yeah Believers would get together and
[1:42:31] fellowship oh yeah praise the Lord and
[1:42:34] of course then it got down to just uh
[1:42:37] maybe four or five times then three or
[1:42:40] four times

[1:43:49] he doing it through you and me
[1:43:51] brother what God ordained to do through
[1:43:53] Luther and Wesley and the Pentecostals
[1:43:55] he did it oh yeah they went forth
[1:43:58] preaching it by the grace of God
[1:44:01] and how did John how did John John
[1:44:03] Wesley get the revelation of
[1:44:05] sanctification
[1:44:07] I told you that there recently
[1:44:08] he was in a cottage meeting
[1:44:11] that a group was having
[1:44:13] based on Luther's teachings
[1:44:17] oh yeah he was in the cottage meeting
[1:44:19] and and they were they were
[1:44:20] administering this and they were singing
[1:44:22] and praising the Lord and oh yeah
[1:44:24] justification justification and John
[1:44:27] Wesley it struck John Wesley concerning
[1:44:29] sanctification
[1:44:30] oh yes and he was he was in one of those
[1:44:32] Cottage means and he raised his hands
[1:44:34] and started praise the Lord
[1:44:36] the Revelation struck him
[1:44:39] now brother sister what Revelation is
[1:44:42] striking us
[1:44:43] what are we looking for now what are we
[1:44:45] expecting now what are we calling for
[1:44:47] now are we really really really calling
[1:44:50] for the resurrection
[1:44:51] I mean really calling for the rapture
[1:44:55] um do you want to go
[1:44:58] amen sister
[1:45:00] do you want to go
[1:45:02] I'm sure unfortunately there's not many
[1:45:04] want to go
[1:45:06] they don't no
[1:45:08] yeah here they do
[1:45:10] but not here
[1:45:13] see it's in the heart
[1:45:16] said one time Believers got together and
[1:45:20] they're looking for the resurrection
[1:45:21] looking for the Rapture praise the Lord
[1:45:22] we're living in that hour but then that
[1:45:24] Spirit of that Revival left
[1:45:27] and just became a Creed
[1:45:29] doctrines
[1:45:31] teachings
[1:45:33] that's all
[1:45:35] oh yes
[1:45:36] and to many many so-called Believers
[1:45:39] today it's just a Creed
[1:45:41] that's all as I said this is a Creed
[1:45:45] they believe this
[1:45:46] but it's just a letter not not the
[1:45:49] spirit of it
[1:45:50] the letter
[1:45:52] oh they read it oh yeah we believe it we
[1:45:55] believe that we believe that yeah
[1:45:59] throw the book out
[1:46:02] see if you still believe it
[1:46:05] I'll tell you this
[1:46:07] regardless of what it is
[1:46:09] whether you got the book or not you
[1:46:11] still believe it
[1:46:14] Oh yes most definitely amen whether you
[1:46:17] got the book of don't add the book I
[1:46:18] tell you if you're into the revealed
[1:46:20] word of what God has done and what God's
[1:46:22] doing you you're looking for the
[1:46:24] resurrection you're looking for the
[1:46:25] Rapture let's get out of here
[1:46:28] Kevin
[1:46:30] how how much longer you want to stay in
[1:46:33] this whole world
[1:46:34] mostly want to stay in this insane world
[1:46:37] and it is insane
[1:46:40] it's not normal no more no listen if our
[1:46:44] grandparents were to come back they
[1:46:45] wouldn't want to stay
[1:46:47] that's true
[1:46:48] and and so like I said my grandparents
[1:46:50] that were they were old-fashioned in
[1:46:52] this church or that church or whatever
[1:46:53] but if they came back they wouldn't want
[1:46:54] to stay
[1:46:55] why
[1:46:57] they would see the way people were
[1:46:59] dressing they would see the way people
[1:47:00] were after him see the way they were
[1:47:03] eating
[1:47:04] this world gone crazy
[1:47:06] they would
[1:47:08] if my grandfather came back sure
[1:47:11] he would want to stay
[1:47:14] you want to go on
[1:47:15] because they were living in an insane
[1:47:17] world
[1:47:19] you're talking about uh
[1:47:23] you know where they let it go on because
[1:47:25] why because the
[1:47:27] the so-called Mental Hospitals are not
[1:47:29] big enough
[1:47:30] to take everybody
[1:47:32] oh yeah because I tell you that they
[1:47:35] when it comes in in the mind of God they
[1:47:37] are crazy
[1:47:38] it's a crazy world it's an insane world
[1:47:42] oh yeah
[1:47:44] and brother God's going to throw a lot
[1:47:46] of them into the Great Tribulation
[1:47:50] I pray Grace for us for the resurrection
[1:47:54] Grace for the Rapture boards get out of
[1:47:56] here and God's God's going to change it
[1:47:58] and God's going to wave it all off
[1:48:00] amen praise the Lord
[1:48:02] amen was the second Peter chapter 2.
[1:48:09] almost an hour
[1:48:13] and verse 1.
[1:48:18] but there were false prophets also among
[1:48:21] the people even as there shall be false
[1:48:23] teachers among you
[1:48:26] yeah and there's many a false teacher
[1:48:28] around the message
[1:48:30] be on your guard please
[1:48:32] this be simple let's be sincere
[1:48:35] with the Lord
[1:48:38] don't make it bigger than what it is
[1:48:40] don't make it smaller than what it is
[1:48:42] leave it the way it is
[1:48:45] amen leave it the way it is but there
[1:48:48] are those that want to add to it then
[1:48:50] they'll take from it oh you make it
[1:48:52] bigger than what it is make it smaller
[1:48:54] than what it is no leave it the way that
[1:48:55] it is and I'll tell you God by the Holy
[1:48:58] Ghost will Quicken it to your heart
[1:49:03] so again there were false prophets also
[1:49:05] among the people even as there shall be
[1:49:07] false teachers among you
[1:49:09] who privately shall bring in damnable
[1:49:11] heresies even denying the Lord that
[1:49:15] bought them and bring them upon
[1:49:18] themselves Swift destruction God help us
[1:49:22] and many shall follow their pernicious
[1:49:25] ways by reason of whom the way of truth
[1:49:28] shall be evil spoken of
[1:49:31] yeah amazing
[1:49:34] brother let's be sincere
[1:49:37] and there's many a so-called believer
[1:49:40] that's brought reproach on the word
[1:49:43] because of their attitudes because of
[1:49:45] the way they've lived because of their
[1:49:47] actions and reactions oh yeah
[1:49:49] well as I said over the years I've had
[1:49:51] to deal with with a lot of spirits
[1:49:55] yeah
[1:49:56] and I I do recall Ministry many times
[1:50:00] in in other churches
[1:50:03] and
[1:50:04] Believers would
[1:50:07] what's his problem
[1:50:08] what's he preaching about
[1:50:11] why because their spirits that were on
[1:50:13] them
[1:50:15] oh yeah and they thought I was just
[1:50:17] criticizing finding fault
[1:50:19] no no I was trying to bring correction
[1:50:23] amen
[1:50:25] because because there's different
[1:50:27] believers who had different spirits on
[1:50:29] them and they catch this and they run
[1:50:31] with that and they run with that they
[1:50:32] get fanatical with it I said oh God I
[1:50:35] said have mercy on us
[1:50:37] please oh yes I've had to preach it many
[1:50:39] times in different churches message
[1:50:42] churches
[1:50:47] yeah
[1:50:48] and I've as I said I preached it one
[1:50:50] time and the pastor was on my right
[1:50:54] and he was sitting in the front
[1:50:56] and the certain things I preached and he
[1:50:58] turned around and looked at his audience
[1:50:59] and there was about maybe over 200
[1:51:02] people there and he turned around looked
[1:51:03] at his other
[1:51:06] shook his head no
[1:51:07] no
[1:51:09] and so what I had to do I knew I said oh
[1:51:11] Lord
[1:51:12] so I would go back and prove it by the
[1:51:15] word
[1:51:15] I give the scriptures
[1:51:17] oh yeah
[1:51:20] so Lord God help us why because a lot of
[1:51:24] them just say oh God sent a prophet so
[1:51:25] we believe the message
[1:51:27] they don't believe the message
[1:51:29] they don't
[1:51:32] because they believe God sent a prophet
[1:51:34] and that's it
[1:51:36] my brother is more to it than that
[1:51:39] most definitely
[1:51:43] so again verse two and many shall follow
[1:51:45] their own their pernicious Ways by
[1:51:48] reason of whom they the way of truth
[1:51:50] shall be evil spoken of see the way
[1:51:53] they're the way they're living oh yes
[1:51:56] I went into a bank some years ago
[1:52:00] and I was
[1:52:01] doing some banking there and
[1:52:04] the the teller looked at me and they
[1:52:07] said oh
[1:52:09] what religion are you
[1:52:11] so I explained to them
[1:52:15] they said oh
[1:52:17] but this is you're different
[1:52:20] they said we we have other customers
[1:52:23] here and they they seem to be professors
[1:52:25] believe the same thing
[1:52:28] but this is we don't believe it
[1:52:33] because of their attitude
[1:52:35] and because of the way they they act
[1:52:38] and I said oh you really believe that oh
[1:52:40] yes they said and they identified
[1:52:42] certain ones and I know who it was
[1:52:44] and I believe I also I understand
[1:52:48] I said I know what you're what you're
[1:52:49] talking about
[1:52:51] why it was the witness that those
[1:52:52] Believers gave turned them away from the
[1:52:54] message
[1:52:56] but the witness that I was giving
[1:52:59] brought their attention to the message
[1:53:02] and their attitude was different
[1:53:06] so what what are what are what is their
[1:53:08] reaction to you to your Witness
[1:53:11] because some are really really fanatical
[1:53:15] you know when when they're going to
[1:53:17] witness for this and say this and say
[1:53:18] that you know you gotta have a right
[1:53:20] spirit
[1:53:21] you got to say it with the right Spirit
[1:53:23] a right motive right objective right
[1:53:24] attitude
[1:53:25] amen and they'll discern that they'll
[1:53:28] know
[1:53:30] always most definitely
[1:53:32] brother and that's why that's why many
[1:53:33] have been turned away from the message
[1:53:35] and I'll tell you those that turn them
[1:53:36] away because their attitude wasn't right
[1:53:38] the spirit wasn't right they're going to
[1:53:40] answer it the day of judgment
[1:53:43] keep your attitude right keep your
[1:53:45] spirit right
[1:53:47] that's why that that the disciples
[1:53:49] questioned Jesus and why Jesus would do
[1:53:52] this and why Jesus would fellowship with
[1:53:53] this one and especially when he was
[1:53:55] dealing with that woman at the well
[1:53:58] yeah and then there's Believers we could
[1:54:00] would condemn you for fellowshipping
[1:54:02] with this one a fellowship with that one
[1:54:04] or allowing this one in your church
[1:54:05] allowing that one to do in your church
[1:54:08] yeah because we've been we've had we've
[1:54:11] had believers stop supporting us why
[1:54:13] because of uh we've all certain brothers
[1:54:15] and sisters came into the church and we
[1:54:18] referenced them we respect them and so
[1:54:19] on oh yeah
[1:54:22] yeah
[1:54:24] and because I but maybe some of you know
[1:54:27] what but
[1:54:29] that that certain brother that we
[1:54:31] Reverend some respect and yet there's
[1:54:33] other believers stop supporting us
[1:54:35] because they felt we should you know
[1:54:37] step on that person
[1:54:39] no
[1:54:41] according to their faith
[1:54:43] God bless him
[1:54:46] see s self-righteous attitudes
[1:54:51] self-righteous Spirits no no don't do
[1:54:54] that
[1:54:57] brother I tell you because if there's
[1:54:58] anyone could have a self-righteous
[1:55:00] Spirit could be Jesus to you
[1:55:03] yeah
[1:55:04] so don't turn them down because because
[1:55:07] the Lord will turn you down
[1:55:10] keep your spirit right in your attitude
[1:55:12] right
[1:55:13] but he said many shall follow their own
[1:55:15] their pernicious ways and by reason of
[1:55:18] whom the way of truth shall be evil
[1:55:20] spoken of oh yeah as I said many many of
[1:55:23] so-called Believers they've been out
[1:55:25] there being Witnesses or witnessed or
[1:55:27] witnessed and to bring a reproach on the
[1:55:29] word
[1:55:29] instead of bringing people to the word
[1:55:31] they'll turn them away
[1:55:33] because of their spirit and their
[1:55:35] attitude
[1:55:36] amen
[1:55:39] and he said through covetousness shall
[1:55:41] they with thin words he said make
[1:55:44] merchandise of you whose judgment now of
[1:55:46] long time lingers not and their
[1:55:49] damnation Slumbers not the grace of God
[1:55:52] be with us brother sister
[1:55:59] listen
[1:56:02] more and more Ministries around the
[1:56:04] message are preaching filler around the
[1:56:06] message
[1:56:08] and they are making the people feel
[1:56:09] convenient and comfortable
[1:56:12] like their denominational brethren
[1:56:15] the teaching is keeping them separated
[1:56:17] from their denominational Brethren but
[1:56:19] they're not getting into the prophecy of
[1:56:22] rapturing faith and the rapture
[1:56:26] they're into Doctrine and theology but
[1:56:30] not
[1:56:31] rapturing faith
[1:56:34] brother every message that God has ever
[1:56:36] brought was predestinated and ordained
[1:56:38] to give us a faith to please God
[1:56:44] the Pentecostal Revival giving them the
[1:56:46] faith for the gifts
[1:56:48] of the spirit
[1:56:50] amen
[1:56:52] and on down through there was different
[1:56:54] different revivals to give them this
[1:56:56] Faith give them that faith and they will
[1:56:57] grow they would live it amen they go out
[1:57:00] and they testify of it amen
[1:57:03] what about the faith that God has given
[1:57:05] us in this hour brother it's for the
[1:57:09] resurrection and for the rapture
[1:57:11] believes thou this
[1:57:15] God help us
[1:57:21] many recognize the end time and the
[1:57:23] message to separate them from
[1:57:25] denominations but faith
[1:57:28] they're not really recognizing the faith
[1:57:31] to comprehend the faith for the rapture
[1:57:34] they think it's oh
[1:57:36] the message oh yeah we're against
[1:57:38] denominations we don't believe this we
[1:57:40] don't believe that
[1:57:41] brother the message was ordained
[1:57:44] to give us the faith for the rapture
[1:57:48] faith for the resurrection Faith to get
[1:57:50] out of here faith for a new Heaven and a
[1:57:52] new Earth
[1:57:56] but too many are caught up with just
[1:57:58] Doctrine
[1:58:00] this Doctrine oh this is the message
[1:58:01] this this doctor it's this Doctrine no
[1:58:04] no
[1:58:05] brother
[1:58:06] God the faith of the message that God
[1:58:08] gave Luther he went forth Justified
[1:58:13] yeah
[1:58:14] the faith that God gave Wesley they went
[1:58:16] forth sanctified
[1:58:18] and the Pentecostals the baptism of the
[1:58:20] Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit they
[1:58:22] went forth living that life
[1:58:26] what about message Believers there's too
[1:58:28] many just caught up with the letter of
[1:58:30] the word the letter of the message the
[1:58:33] doctrine but not the life
[1:58:36] there's it's a life
[1:58:39] brother there was a Justified life a
[1:58:41] Sanctified life a life that had the
[1:58:43] gifts of the Spirit access to the gifts
[1:58:46] of the Spirit oh yeah the prophet of God
[1:58:47] said he said when it comes to the gifts
[1:58:49] of the Spirit under the Pentecostal
[1:58:50] Revival he says right there he said he

[2:05:12] and so when I explained it to him
[2:05:15] thank the Lord the pastor
[2:05:18] oh
[2:05:20] he smiled and raised his hand

[2:05:25] apparently he had he had not noticed it
[2:05:28] he had never heard it before
[2:05:31] amen
[2:05:33] and I said he has raised us up together
[2:05:35] and made us sit together in Heavenly
[2:05:37] places in Christ Jesus and again to
[2:05:40] remind you what the prophecy is going on
[2:05:42] there he said what's going on there he
[2:05:43] said the word is being revealed
[2:05:48] amen amen he said we're caught up in a
[2:05:50] Heavenly place in Christ the word is
[2:05:52] being revealed
[2:05:53] but for to give us Resurrection Rapture
[2:05:55] faith hallelujah thank you Jesus I trust
[2:05:59] they believe it now
[2:06:01] amen
[2:06:04] again
[2:06:09] it was second Peter and I'll try to
[2:06:12] oh my
[2:06:15] just share a couple of thoughts or
[2:06:16] quotes with you and just finish this
[2:06:18] scripture right here
[2:06:21] verse 2 again in second Peter 2 many
[2:06:24] shall follow their own their pernicious
[2:06:26] Ways by reason of whom the way of truth
[2:06:28] shall be evil spoken of
[2:06:31] and through covetousness shall they with
[2:06:33] thin words make merchandise of you whose
[2:06:37] judgment not now of a long time lingerth
[2:06:39] not and their damnation slumbereth not
[2:06:42] for if God spared not the angels that
[2:06:45] sin but cast them down to Hell and
[2:06:48] delivered them into the chains of
[2:06:49] Darkness to be reserved unto judgment
[2:06:52] and spirit not the old world but saved
[2:06:55] Noah the eighth person
[2:06:57] a preacher of righteousness
[2:06:59] bringing in the flood upon the world of
[2:07:02] the ungodly
[2:07:04] amen
[2:07:06] Grace Grace Grace
[2:07:14] again
[2:07:18] the teaching
[2:07:20] is to keep them separated from their
[2:07:23] denominational Brethren but they are not
[2:07:25] getting into the prophecy of the rapture
[2:07:28] the faith of the rapture
[2:07:31] they recognize the end time and the
[2:07:33] message to separate them from the
[2:07:35] nominations but
[2:07:37] not really recognizing the faith
[2:07:41] for the rapture
[2:07:45] brother
[2:07:46] how many really realize that in all that
[2:07:48] God has done and all that God is doing
[2:07:50] through the ministry of William Branham
[2:07:52] that is to give us rapturing faith
[2:07:55] not just to get us out of denominations
[2:07:59] but to get us home
[2:08:07] it says they recognize say it again they
[2:08:09] recognize the end time and the message
[2:08:11] to separate them from denominations but
[2:08:14] not really recognizing the faith to
[2:08:16] comprehend the faith for the rapture
[2:08:20] like Israel's Faith to bring them out of
[2:08:22] Egypt but Falling short of the
[2:08:26] Revelation to give them Faith to possess
[2:08:29] the Promised Land
[2:08:31] there's one thing to get out of Egypt
[2:08:32] another one to get into the Promised
[2:08:34] Land
[2:08:36] oh yeah they were following Moses
[2:08:39] to come out
[2:08:40] but they questioned Joshua about going
[2:08:42] in
[2:08:44] yeah God help us
[2:08:47] amen
[2:08:49] they fell short of that Revelation to
[2:08:52] possess the Promised Land
[2:08:53] oh brother there's many that are that
[2:08:56] are that have come out
[2:08:57] brother Brown referred to it as Egyptian
[2:09:00] denominational
[2:09:02] bondage
[2:09:04] that's what he called it that's what he
[2:09:06] called it he said Egyptian
[2:09:08] denominational bondage
[2:09:11] Israel was brought out but then they had
[2:09:13] to go in
[2:09:14] to possess the land
[2:09:16] we've been brought out well that's good
[2:09:19] thank the Lord
[2:09:20] but now
[2:09:21] God wants us to go in and possess the
[2:09:23] land
[2:09:25] and there was a generation of the Jews
[2:09:28] that came out of Egypt but didn't
[2:09:30] wouldn't go into the Promised Land
[2:09:32] because they felt oh they are bigger
[2:09:36] than us oh we can't do this we can't do
[2:09:38] that and Joshua said if God before us
[2:09:40] who can be against us
[2:09:44] brother we come out of the nominations
[2:09:45] what about going into the resurrection
[2:09:48] what about going into the rapture
[2:09:50] God help us
[2:09:56] as it was then so it is now
[2:09:59] many in this spiritual wilderness
[2:10:02] are doing God a service without his will
[2:10:07] make sure you're in the will of God
[2:10:13] and unfortunately many are falling under
[2:10:16] the indictment of the crucifying of
[2:10:19] crucifying the word
[2:10:22] and it was the message I indict this
[2:10:24] generation
[2:10:25] for the crucifixion of Christ
[2:10:30] what about you
[2:10:31] I pray Grace you're not crucifying
[2:10:33] Christ in your life
[2:10:38] you young brothers and sisters be on
[2:10:40] your guard don't crucify Christ in your
[2:10:43] life
[2:10:46] again for the moms and the dads don't
[2:10:49] crucify Christ in your home
[2:10:56] don't crucify Christ in your job
[2:10:59] God help us
[2:11:05] unfortunately many are falling under the
[2:11:08] indictment of crucifying the word
[2:11:12] in the message indictment the prophet
[2:11:15] said
[2:11:16] notice he said they the worshipers The
[2:11:19] Men Who had looked for the promise The
[2:11:22] Men Who had looked for it through years
[2:11:24] and ages with nothing to do but in that
[2:11:27] constant Seminary but he said they had
[2:11:30] divided the word according to the
[2:11:32] teaching of the Seminary
[2:11:34] and it said they had missed their very
[2:11:36] truth why because they took what the
[2:11:39] Seminary said not what the word said
[2:11:43] and it says they the priests
[2:11:45] the ministry of that day
[2:11:47] there at their headquarters
[2:11:50] the ministry of that day was killing the
[2:11:52] very God
[2:11:53] killing the very lamb
[2:11:56] he said the very one that they claimed
[2:11:58] they were worshiping they were killing
[2:12:01] don't kill the one you profess to
[2:12:03] worship
[2:12:04] don't kill his influence in your life
[2:12:12] he's worked it in now let him work it
[2:12:14] out
[2:12:17] and today he said I indict this bunch of
[2:12:20] ordained ministers in their Creeds and
[2:12:22] denominations they are crucifying to the
[2:12:25] people the very God that they claim that
[2:12:28] they love and serve
[2:12:30] I indict these ministers in the name of
[2:12:33] our Lord Jesus upon their doctrine that
[2:12:36] claim that the days of Miracles this
[2:12:37] past and that the water baptism in the
[2:12:40] name of Jesus Christ is not sufficient
[2:12:42] and not right upon any of these words
[2:12:45] that they have substituted creeds I
[2:12:50] indict them as guilty and the blood of
[2:12:53] Jesus Christ upon their hands for
[2:12:55] crucifying afresh the Lord Jesus the
[2:12:57] second time
[2:12:59] don't crucify him in your life
[2:13:01] let him have control
[2:13:04] unfortunately
[2:13:07] there's many a Believers as continues to
[2:13:11] crucify Christ
[2:13:13] continues to crucify Christ's
[2:13:14] influencing their everyday living
[2:13:20] he wants to control this for you he
[2:13:23] wants to control that don't crucify
[2:13:27] let him have control
[2:13:37] he said listen
[2:13:41] up on any of these words that they have
[2:13:43] substituted Creeds for I indict them as
[2:13:46] guilty and the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:13:48] upon their hands for crucifying afresh
[2:13:51] the Lord Jesus
[2:13:53] and he said you read the same Bible that
[2:13:57] any other man can read but you've turned
[2:13:59] down the spirit of God
[2:14:01] till the Bible said you be given over to
[2:14:04] a strong delusion to believe a lie and
[2:14:07] be damned by it
[2:14:09] you actually believe that you are right
[2:14:11] and the Bible says that you would
[2:14:13] believe it and be damned by the same lie
[2:14:16] that you believe to be the truth
[2:14:19] therefore I indict you by the word of
[2:14:22] God you are teaching the people a hearer
[2:14:25] and crucifying the principles of Christ
[2:14:29] he said you're crucifying the principles
[2:14:31] of holiness
[2:14:33] and the life above
[2:14:36] he said that the person might walk out
[2:14:38] on the street and be a different person
[2:14:41] he said more and more Believers are
[2:14:43] becoming intellectual
[2:14:45] and less and less spiritual in thought
[2:14:48] in word and deed
[2:14:52] and I have found that over the years
[2:14:56] as I've said over 50 years of experience
[2:14:59] around the ministry
[2:15:01] I have witnessed many
[2:15:03] have become more and more intellectual
[2:15:06] they believed this they believed that
[2:15:08] but it's all in their head but about in
[2:15:10] your heart
[2:15:14] let's be more spiritual
[2:15:17] less religious
[2:15:19] amen let's be spiritual in our thoughts
[2:15:23] spiritual in our words and in our Deeds
[2:15:26] by the grace of God amen
[2:15:32] turn with me to final scripture right
[2:15:34] here
[2:15:36] first John chapter 2.
[2:15:47] amen
[2:15:57] Grace
[2:16:02] he said listen
[2:16:04] he said we see that the Protestant
[2:16:06] organization yet blindly as the same
[2:16:09] nature of the Catholic Church
[2:16:11] yeah
[2:16:13] the Bible calls the Catholic Church a
[2:16:16] and caused the Protestant church arlets
[2:16:19] and he said that the was the
[2:16:22] mother of harlots
[2:16:24] and he said
[2:16:26] and this people
[2:16:28] that's a hill Fame woman who doesn't
[2:16:31] live true to her marriage vows and we
[2:16:34] all claim to be the bride of Christ and
[2:16:39] yet so untrue
[2:16:41] what would make the entreueness
[2:16:44] by living contrary
[2:16:47] to the discipline that God has laid out
[2:16:49] for his bride to live by
[2:16:54] amen
[2:16:57] just think
[2:17:01] are you living contrary to the
[2:17:05] discipline
[2:17:06] of the word
[2:17:09] and I'll tell you there's many a
[2:17:10] congregation doesn't like
[2:17:13] disciplined preaching
[2:17:17] oh yeah they want to oh
[2:17:19] good
[2:17:20] good good preach this preach this good
[2:17:23] good this doctrine that Doctrine oh yeah
[2:17:26] but what about laid it in at a personal
[2:17:28] way to get you to line up with it
[2:17:32] that's different
[2:17:34] there's one thing to come out there's
[2:17:36] another thing to go in
[2:17:39] yeah
[2:17:40] oh yeah they wanted to come out because
[2:17:42] they were slaves
[2:17:44] purely wanted to come out oh yes yes
[2:17:47] they got out
[2:17:49] oh yeah God fed them in the wilderness
[2:17:52] oh yeah
[2:17:54] but what about going in
[2:17:57] Joshua took in some and they went in and
[2:18:00] looked around the promised land always a
[2:18:02] good land wonderful land oh but
[2:18:05] the inhabitants
[2:18:07] they got afraid of the inhabitants
[2:18:10] no we can't go we can't possess
[2:18:13] they're two they're two powerful why
[2:18:16] they're big
[2:18:17] and so on
[2:18:18] they didn't matter Joshua
[2:18:21] Joshua kept saying well he said if God
[2:18:23] before us who can be against us let's go
[2:18:26] yeah
[2:18:28] so brother we come out I will go on in
[2:18:31] there's one thing to come out of
[2:18:32] denomination another thing to go in to
[2:18:35] the promised land
[2:18:37] and many oh yeah is like I said when I
[2:18:40] was at church one time years ago and
[2:18:43] we're at the altar praying and that
[2:18:46] believer next to me prayed as and I
[2:18:49] heard heard them saying oh Lord thank
[2:18:52] you forever bringing us out of
[2:18:54] denomination now Lord we don't we don't
[2:18:56] have to be subject to any man anymore
[2:19:00] I said Lord
[2:19:02] I said they need a revelation
[2:19:05] I said because you brought them out from
[2:19:07] there plus you you bring them in here
[2:19:09] you still get they still got to come
[2:19:10] under a minister
[2:19:13] but that believer felt no
[2:19:16] we're free we don't have to
[2:19:20] oh yes there's many a Believer felt like
[2:19:22] that years ago
[2:19:23] maybe some still feel that way no no God
[2:19:27] will bring you out from that but he'll
[2:19:29] bring you under another Ministry
[2:19:31] they left for the ministry of Moses but
[2:19:34] to come under the ministry of Joshua
[2:19:40] God still requires it on you
[2:19:44] make your calling and your election sure
[2:19:48] please make sure your spirit is right
[2:19:50] and your attitude is right
[2:19:56] he said by living contrary to the
[2:19:58] discipline that God has laid out for his
[2:20:00] bride to live by he said the Bible and
[2:20:03] he said it is the infallible word of God
[2:20:06] and he said therefore we find out that
[2:20:09] the Protestant Church in order to have
[2:20:11] an organization separates itself even
[2:20:14] from the scriptures easy to make its
[2:20:17] organization
[2:20:18] oh yeah
[2:20:20] God help us
[2:20:29] he said I dare anybody to come under the
[2:20:31] blood of Jesus Christ and claim any
[2:20:34] promise he's a God's obligated to take
[2:20:37] care of it but they won't do it he said
[2:20:40] they'll come and say oh Lord I want to
[2:20:43] do something give me a great gift
[2:20:44] Hallelujah Lord glory to God I believe I
[2:20:48] got it Allelujah it'll never work he
[2:20:51] says you might bring forth a lot of
[2:20:53] psychology but it won't work he said
[2:20:55] God's got to recognize that repentance
[2:21:00] God's got to do that and he said we
[2:21:02] could say a lot along that line
[2:21:04] is I hope you are understanding
[2:21:08] amen
[2:21:09] brother
[2:21:12] foreign

[2:21:30] in your home
[2:21:33] in your job
[2:21:35] yes in your church
[2:21:41] he said I'd like for every for somebody
[2:21:44] to answer that for me how can it do when
[2:21:47] you deny the very Revival itself well
[2:21:52] did the prophet speak of them
[2:21:54] or well did he speak of them form of
[2:21:57] godliness amen Grace that we don't have
[2:22:00] a form of godliness
[2:22:02] and his Believers that have forms of
[2:22:04] godliness
[2:22:06] it's not the real life of Jesus
[2:22:09] but they have a form of godliness
[2:22:11] Professor to believe the message
[2:22:16] he said listen they are crucifying the
[2:22:18] effects of the Gospel upon the people
[2:22:21] by their creeds
[2:22:23] he said that's the crucifixion and
[2:22:26] that's where the public is set in these
[2:22:28] big morgues called churches
[2:22:31] and draw a line of a Creed and he said
[2:22:34] the word of God can't have an effect
[2:22:36] upon them because they condemn the very
[2:22:40] things that God Christ said would take
[2:22:43] place it just don't come according to
[2:22:45] their Creed and neither did Jesus come
[2:22:49] according to their understanding of his
[2:22:51] coming
[2:22:52] amen
[2:22:54] he said they have crucified the effects
[2:22:57] of the word

[2:23:16] he said a Christian Life is a life of
[2:23:19] holiness
[2:23:20] a Christian Life is a life of purity
[2:23:23] he said Minister I indict them in the
[2:23:26] name
[2:23:28] of Jesus Christ
[2:23:30] for their filth and their dirt
[2:23:33] he said I indict you by the word of God
[2:23:36] he says you're teaching people a hearer
[2:23:39] and crucifying the principles of Christ
[2:23:42] crucifying
[2:23:44] his holiness
[2:23:45] and the life above
[2:23:47] amen
[2:23:52] I'll finish with this quote
[2:23:56] he's it is not one Calvary enough for my
[2:23:58] Lord
[2:24:00] why will you do this

[2:24:05] and you know that this that this is his
[2:24:08] word you that can read revelation 22.
[2:24:13] the 22nd chapter and say whoever will
[2:24:16] take one word or add one word why do you
[2:24:20] do it is it one Calvary enough for Jesus

[2:24:27] attorney
[2:24:29] and I indict you by the word of God
[2:24:32] change your ways or you'll go to hell
[2:24:35] issued her denominations will crumble I

[2:24:40] judge

[2:25:08] see
[2:25:11] the Bible says love not the world
[2:25:14] neither the things that are in the world
[2:25:17] If any man loved the world the love of
[2:25:20] the father is not in him
[2:25:22] for all that is in the world the lust of
[2:25:25] the flesh
[2:25:26] and the lust of the eyes and the pride
[2:25:29] of life
[2:25:30] is not of the father but is of the world
[2:25:36] and the world passes away and the lust
[2:25:38] thereof but he that doeth the will of
[2:25:41] God abideth forever
