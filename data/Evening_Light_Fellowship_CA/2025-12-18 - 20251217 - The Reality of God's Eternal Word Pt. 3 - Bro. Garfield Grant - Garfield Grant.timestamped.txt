[15:22] I remember also brother um Garfield as
[15:25] he brings the word of the Lord tonight.
[15:28] Uh we had prayer requests for brother
[15:29] Ben Norat. I think the uh updates have
[15:32] gone out. Uh and uh we just want to
[15:35] continue to pray for his recovery. Also
[15:37] for brother Ron Snow and uh Sister
[15:40] Nadine and Sister Cassandra. Sister
[15:42] Nadine is improving. Got some of her

[16:45] announcements now. Um, next Wednesday is
[16:49] Christmas Eve, so that will be cancelled
[16:51] next Wednesday. Uh, so there'll be no

[16:57] there will be prayer meeting on Saturday
[17:00] night. This Saturday night coming at 700
[17:02] p.m. Uh, want to remember to pray for
[17:05] that. Uh, the deacons will send out or
[17:08] the deacon uh will send out uh, a note
[17:12] uh, with any further announcements.
[17:16] um after that as well. And also for

[17:35] right now. And uh she had asked through
[17:39] sister Moren's sister that sister
[17:40] Moren's church would pray for her. So uh
[17:44] we want to pray for the salvation of the
[17:46] soul and uh as brother Brandham said we
[17:51] pray to be found in the center of God's
[17:53] perfect will. So we just pray for her uh
[17:56] tonight as well. So a lot of requests
[17:59] but we serve a God who uh answers prayer
[18:03] whether it be a lot of requests or just
[18:05] a few. So, let's uh just hold on in
[18:08] faith tonight as we approach the throne

[41:21] Let's just bow our hearts to him
[41:23] tonight.
[41:26] Eternal God and Father Lord we thank you
[41:29] for tonight
[41:31] we thank you for the grace Lord God that
[41:33] you have extended towards our lives Lord
[41:38] oh God it's not because we're good
[41:42] it's not oh God because Lord there is an
[41:45] righteousness Lord God we are presented
[41:49] but Lord with humbler hearts we come
[41:51] before your presence Lord
[41:54] And Lord God, the grace we can do, Lord,
[41:56] is to take ourselves out of the way,
[41:59] Lord God, and allow, Lord God, your Holy
[42:03] Spirit to come, Lord, and to speak to
[42:05] our hearts.
[42:08] Lord God, we love you tonight, Lord.
[42:13] Because, oh God, of what you have done
[42:15] for us,
[42:17] the scripture declares that while we are
[42:19] yet sinners, Lord, you died for the
[42:22] ungodly.
[42:24] And the least we can do tonight, Lord
[42:26] God, is to offer ourself, Lord, our
[42:29] bodies, our thoughts, oh God, our minds,
[42:32] our heart, oh God, as a living
[42:34] sacrifice, Lord. that Lord you will come
[42:37] Lord God and dwell in our hearts Lord
[42:39] God and possess our reigns and Lord God
[42:43] that we will be living instruments in
[42:45] your hands Lord God for your
[42:47] manifestation
[42:49] bless your people Lord God and may you
[42:52] be among us Lord God as we speak Lord
[42:54] God Lord you understand the needs of
[42:56] your children and all the requestes all
[42:58] the needs that were mentioned the
[43:00] sicknesses and oh God you're still the
[43:03] bomb in Gilead you're still the great
[43:05] physicianord Lord. And so God, we put
[43:08] all the cases in your hands tonight,
[43:10] Lord God, that you will come forth and
[43:12] and be the one, oh God, to be
[43:14] acknowledged, Lord God, to be the
[43:15] healer, to be the deliverer tonight,
[43:17] Lord. Bless your people, Lord God, as we
[43:20] come believing. And we say thanks for
[43:23] hearing and answering prayer. In Jesus
[43:25] Christ's name we pray. We say, "Amen."
[43:30] Amen. Do you love him tonight, church?
[43:34] God is truly a wonderful God. And
[43:38] tonight we we're just grateful to be
[43:42] standing at my point of duty. It's one
[43:46] of my greatest joy to serve the people
[43:49] especially the bride of Jesus Christ.
[43:51] And so you know I stand here in service
[43:54] to the body of Christ. Amen.
[43:57] I have been um this is like uh my third
[44:02] uh uh service and um we'll be reading
[44:08] from um 1 John 5.
[44:12] Oh, the topic is posted here. So, you
[44:16] can take it for your notes there.
[44:21] And it begin reads us.
[44:24] If we receive the witness of men, the
[44:27] witness of God is greater.
[44:30] For this is the witness of God which he
[44:32] has testify of his son.
[44:36] He He that believeth on the Son of God
[44:40] has the witness in himself.
[44:43] He that believeth not God had made him a
[44:47] liar because he believeth not the record
[44:50] that God gave of his son.
[44:54] And this is the record
[44:57] that God has given us
[45:00] eternal life.
[45:02] And this life is in his son.
[45:06] And he that has the son has life.
[45:11] And he that has not the son of God has
[45:14] not life. You may be seated tonight. I
[45:19] think this is where we left off the last
[45:22] time. Hallelujah.
[45:26] You know, brother Brandham spoke of, you
[45:28] know, when he he said that, you know,
[45:30] the son of God is not another God
[45:33] really, but it was the eternal spirit
[45:37] that was being manifested.
[45:39] You see, the invisible God, hallelujah,
[45:42] made visible in the form of sunship.
[45:47] And that sunship is just really God in a
[45:50] bodily form where he can express
[45:52] himself.
[45:53] So we saw the word the Bible said in the
[45:58] beginning was the word and the word was
[46:01] with God and the world was God. Brother
[46:05] Breton explain it perfectly. He said God
[46:08] emptied himself into Christ
[46:11] either or he poured himself or hemorpher
[46:14] himself into Christ. And so we saw God
[46:19] the eternal spirit uh was made visible
[46:22] in Christ uh hallelujah praise God. And
[46:25] so God bearing record of Christ UH THAT
[46:29] HALLELUJAH THAT THE life that is in him
[46:32] the eternal life was himself.
[46:35] And God bearing record of his son. And
[46:38] he said, "And if you HAVE GOD, IF YOU
[46:40] HAVE THE SPIRIT, UH, the only way you
[46:43] can get the spirit is by having the son,
[46:46] is having the Jesus Christ." Because
[46:50] without having Jesus Christ, hallelujah,
[46:52] you have no life. You know, I I tonight,
[46:57] you know, I've been studying this topic
[46:59] for a while and
[47:01] I'm very curious about, you know, my
[47:04] Christian journey about this part that,
[47:07] you know, we are called to very
[47:09] observant. I, you know, observe a lot of
[47:11] stuff and and um I recognize church from
[47:16] my own experience really, you know, um I
[47:20] recognize there's more to this Christian
[47:22] faith. you know, there's so much more to
[47:25] it. And you know, I my experience
[47:28] started back, you know, in Jamaica. You
[47:31] know, I was young about 13 Bob about 13,
[47:36] 15, 14 there about and I got sick and
[47:40] you know, I got sick to a point where I,
[47:43] you know, for about a year I couldn't do
[47:45] anything. I couldn't travel on the road.
[47:47] I couldn't take my exam. I couldn't have
[47:49] gone to school. I was sick. I wasn't a
[47:51] Christian back then. I was just a young
[47:53] man trying to find my way and I got sick
[47:56] and it was bad, you know, real bad. And
[47:59] like every weekend my mom would take me
[48:01] to the doctor, you know, just to get
[48:02] some medical help and and you know, um,
[48:06] nothing worked. you know, she spent
[48:09] money, you know, a lot of money in order
[48:11] to, you know, to see the doctor until we
[48:14] end up doing, you know, the MRI and uh,
[48:17] you know, we did CAT scan and, you know,
[48:20] and all sort of things, but nothing and
[48:22] it went like that for about a year
[48:25] until, you know, my mother told me that,
[48:27] you know, she gave up, you know, she did
[48:30] everything possible as a mom, you know,
[48:32] and, you know, she said that at the
[48:34] stage at where I was, she was preparing
[48:36] for funeral. Yeah. She she she was
[48:39] embracing for the bad news, you know.
[48:42] But in my young days, I she had a a a a
[48:47] New Testament Bible, Brother John. And I
[48:50] took that Bible from her. And I remember
[48:53] what I did. I opened the scripture. You
[48:56] know, I didn't know what I was doing. I
[48:58] was looking for hope somewhere, right?
[49:00] Because if medical science was wasn't
[49:02] there to help, then I was looking for
[49:04] hope, right? And and so I turned that
[49:06] Bible and I put it under my clothes. And
[49:09] so whenever time I started feeling sick,
[49:11] I I would press the Bible against my
[49:13] skin. And in my mind, I believe that
[49:16] there was something would have left from
[49:17] the the Bible on, you know, under my
[49:20] skin and and it works. You know, it
[49:21] felt, you know, each time I started
[49:23] feeling sick, I pressed on it and I
[49:25] started feeling a little better. But I
[49:28] found something in that experience. you
[49:30] know, I told her that I wanted to get
[49:33] baptized and my first baptism was in the
[49:36] denominational church and and so two
[49:39] weeks after I got baptized,
[49:41] um I remember she had a dream, brother
[49:45] John, and the dream was that she saw me
[49:48] uh I was I fell into a foring like river
[49:51] and and it was so high and boisterous
[49:53] and it was taking me along the path and
[49:56] she said that she saw this guy, he was
[49:58] passing and he saw me in the water and I
[50:00] was drowning and the guy jumped into the
[50:03] water and saved me and you know and and
[50:07] he said she said that in the dream I was
[50:09] rescued and I said yes that's exactly
[50:12] what I was looking for and brother Bob
[50:16] from that day
[50:18] from that day my life was never be was
[50:22] never the same
[50:24] there was a total turn around from the
[50:28] experience
[50:29] You know, every time I started feeling
[50:31] sick, I keep on reminding myself and
[50:34] reminding the sickness of that dream. I
[50:38] I keep on telling that devil, remember
[50:40] the dream. Remember the dream. And that
[50:43] was like 35 or something years ago,
[50:47] right? But the thing that really comes
[50:49] to mind is what is it about a simple
[50:52] dream? That's what draw my my thought
[50:55] into Christianity.
[50:58] WHAT IS IT A dream could do that medical
[51:00] science couldn't have done? And I said,
[51:04] it's I had to stop a little bit. I said
[51:07] some there's something about this
[51:09] Christian faith that that they're so
[51:11] different. But I found something in that
[51:14] experience that as I grow I begin to
[51:16] realize looking at life and and this
[51:19] mortal life and seeing exactly what it
[51:22] is that there's so many ups and downs,
[51:24] so many instances of of struggles and
[51:27] and sicknesses AND AND AND WORRIES and
[51:30] all of these things that will come your
[51:32] way in in this mortal life. But I FOUND
[51:35] MY EXPERIENCE BACK THEN POINTS ME TO
[51:37] SOMETHING that was greater than this
[51:39] mortal life.
[51:42] And so I have used that instant in in
[51:45] several experiences really. You know
[51:47] I've had a you know different times when
[51:50] you know when the situation becomes so
[51:52] bad. But when I remember what he did for
[51:54] me back then hallelujah. It gave me
[51:57] confidence to believe that the God that
[52:01] was able to make something create an
[52:03] experience out of nothing. Hallelujah.
[52:06] And so I began focusing on that until
[52:09] God, you know, he was gradually being
[52:11] bringing me into so into into THE
[52:14] REALITY OF OF UNDERSTANDING HOW WHAT
[52:17] THIS Christian faith is really. And so I
[52:19] BEGIN REALIZING THAT THERE'S more to
[52:21] this Christian faith than what you know
[52:24] we and more to this mortal life also
[52:26] that than than we are really looking at
[52:29] really. And so when I came to the
[52:31] message, YOU KNOW, I STARTED OUT, YOU
[52:33] KNOW, you know, we were like, you know,
[52:36] like kids, you know, getting a new toy.
[52:38] We we saw brotherham's message and we we
[52:40] were very elated, you know, brother Bob
[52:42] about the message. We we had this quote
[52:45] based type of thing but it didn't really
[52:48] mean much to us really until one day we
[52:51] had a brother from overseas and he
[52:52] preached a message and something struck
[52:54] me again AND I BEGIN REALIZING
[52:58] HALLELUJAH THAT there's life in this
[53:00] message
[53:02] life real life that can change the order
[53:05] of things and so I start reading the
[53:09] message more in and in a different light
[53:12] because I begin realizing THAT BROTHER
[53:13] BRANDHAM HAD this message here. It it
[53:16] came to Hallelujah. There was something
[53:19] about this message that we have to
[53:21] understand. So I started reading the
[53:23] books all over again because I began
[53:25] realizing that there's more to this
[53:27] message. Hallelujah. And so pointing
[53:30] back to brother I'm going back to the
[53:32] the notes that's my story. But I want
[53:34] you to understand where I'm going
[53:35] tonight because this motor life look at
[53:39] the church. We are here in church
[53:41] tonight and it feels as if there's like
[53:44] it's like a rhetorical decimal
[53:46] BUT THERE'S MORE TO IT CHURCH. THERE'S
[53:50] MORE to this MORTAL LIFE. THERE'S MORE
[53:53] TO OUR EXISTENCE. There's more to our to
[53:57] to our experiences. And so, hallelujah.
[54:00] I want us to stop a little bit and look
[54:03] at that. You know, BROTHER BENAM IN he
[54:06] spoke of the mind of Christ. He said,
[54:08] "What are those thoughts of God?" He
[54:11] said, "The eternal thoughts of God." Let
[54:13] me ask. He said, "Are the thoughts of
[54:16] God eternal?" He said, "The thought of
[54:19] God are eternal and they are real."
[54:23] You see, our definition of re of
[54:26] reality, brother Mark, is what we see,
[54:29] what we can touch, WHAT WE WHAT WE CAN
[54:31] HEAR, but but what we we prescribe as
[54:34] reality. Well, here a prophet is
[54:37] pointing to something that was real,
[54:40] much more real than what we we we're
[54:42] used to. That there's a there's a
[54:44] greater experience, HELLO, IN GOD THAT
[54:48] WAS NOW POINTING BACK to us that IS NOW
[54:51] CALLING US BACK TO THE THE REALITY OF
[54:53] GOD. ARE YOU GETTING ME CHURCH? SO,
[54:56] BROTHER BAM SAID, "ARE THESE THOUGHTS OF
[54:58] GOD? ARE they real?" He said, "Yes, they
[55:00] are." Hallelujah. Now we understand the
[55:04] father of God. Brother said they were
[55:06] made expressed in word. And so when we
[55:09] SPEAK OF THE WORD, WE'RE NOT JUST
[55:11] TALKING ABOUT dead letters, BUT WE ARE
[55:14] SPEAKING OF THE LIFE THAT IS IN the
[55:17] word. ARE YOU THERE WITH ME CHURCH?
[55:19] HALLELUJAH. Praise God. So when we said
[55:22] THE THOUGHT OF GOD, THERE WERE MADE
[55:24] EXPRESS in Christ the word. BUT BUT THE
[55:28] WORD IS THE LIFE OF GOD. IT IS THE
[55:31] SPIRIT OF GOD that was made word which
[55:34] was the THE ETERNAL LIFE THAT WAS made
[55:36] expressed.
[55:38] Hallelujah. So that they are not just
[55:40] simple like a man with a blueprint he
[55:43] has drawn up which one day will be
[55:46] translated in substance and form. They
[55:49] are already real and eternal and part of
[55:52] God. Hallelujah. And so we look at this
[55:56] mortal life. all things. This is to be
[55:59] just part my my my my curious that I
[56:02] just see everything right. Look at this
[56:04] mortal life here. I was saying to my
[56:07] wife the other night, it feel like a
[56:10] rhetorical decimal. You know, every
[56:13] morning she wakes, she go to work.
[56:16] I take her to work, she works, she does
[56:18] everything. So I asked her, "Honey, what
[56:21] you do today?" She said, "The same thing
[56:22] I do every day." you know it feels like
[56:26] a rhetorical decimal YOU KNOW BUT LET US
[56:29] look at it a little bit a little bit
[56:32] further
[56:34] like for example
[56:38] I was once in Jamaica
[56:41] and here I'm in your fund
[56:44] how did I get here
[56:49] the choices you make
[56:52] why did you make that choice
[56:56] Huh?
[56:58] Why did brother B sit there and not over
[57:00] there?
[57:03] What is happening? What what what what
[57:05] is unfolding in our life experience?
[57:08] It seem AS THOUGH LIFE AS WE see it we
[57:11] we are just moving like like robots but
[57:14] we are stepping into something AND AS WE
[57:18] WALK AND as we move and as WE BREATHE IT
[57:21] IS UNFOLDING something
[57:24] it is unfolding AN EXPERIENCE.
[57:26] HALLELUJAH. Without even knowing that we
[57:29] are doing it.
[57:32] So unconsciously things ARE HAPPENING
[57:35] AND WE ARE PARTICIPATING AND WE are
[57:37] looking back and WE ARE SAYING WE ARE
[57:39] LIVING.
[57:41] Are you there me church? BUT THE LIFE
[57:44] THAT WE ARE POINTING TO THAT WE CALL
[57:46] LIVING IS MORTAL LIFE.
[57:50] Are you there me church? AND AS WE
[57:51] EXPRESS IT as we live and and move and
[57:54] have our being. HALLELUJAH. WE'RE LIVING
[57:57] under immortal CONDITION THAT SUBJECT
[58:01] US. YES, WE SEE THINGS ARE HAPPENING.
[58:04] ARE YOU ME CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. BUT IF WE
[58:07] can stop and see exactly what is being
[58:11] unfold.
[58:13] Hallelujah. This mortal life, our things
[58:17] are expressing our own life AND THE
[58:21] CYCLES THAT WE EXPRESS LIKE HALLELUJAH.
[58:23] Like I I'm here. I'm in school. What am
[58:27] I doing in school?
[58:30] I just did some exam the other day and
[58:32] they were hard, you know, but I I'm
[58:35] doing it right. And brother Mark, I'm
[58:37] almost done. I saw that three years ago.
[58:40] And if I was in Jamaica, I wouldn't have
[58:42] been in school here.
[58:44] You see what I'm saying? So something
[58:46] there's something about it.
[58:49] But we need to stop and look and see.
[58:52] Right. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[58:55] Hallelujah. SO WE ARE SEEING THIS PART
[58:58] THAT IS CALLED MORTAL LIFE. And each
[59:01] time we see something like we see
[59:03] something sick OR WE SEE SOMETHING
[59:05] HALLELUJAH THAT IS UNDER the condition.
[59:08] Hallelujah. It expresses the weaknesses
[59:11] of this mortal life. Hallelujah. But
[59:15] said THE REASON WHY HALLELUJAH IT IS THE
[59:19] WAY IT IS. HE SAID WHEN THEY LOOK OUT
[59:21] AND you see a tree, they're struggling.
[59:24] HE SAID THERE'S ANOTHER TREE SOMEWHERE
[59:27] THAT DOESN'T HAVE to struggle.
[59:30] Are you hearing me, church? You see,
[59:31] when we look into this side of things,
[59:34] we see the weaknesses and THE STRUGGLES
[59:36] AND THE FAILURES. WE SEE THE DEFEAT. UH
[59:39] BUT CHURCH, I HAVE GOOD NEWS FOR YOU.
[59:42] THERE'S ANOTHER REALM SOMEWHERE.
[59:44] HALLELUJAH. WHERE THERE'S NO STRUGGLE.
[59:48] ARE YOU HEARING ME, CHURCH? THERE'S
[59:50] GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF LIFE AND
[59:53] EXISTENCE.
[59:55] Oh my.
[59:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:00:01] HALLELUJAH. IT SURE THERE'S A PLACE
[1:00:03] SOMEWHERE. HALLELUJAH. Where it can't
[1:00:06] die. Hallelujah. So all our action, all
[1:00:10] our works, ALL THAT WE DO, HALLELUJAH.
[1:00:14] IT PRODUCES one thing. It produces
[1:00:17] death. WHAT IS THAT? IT COMES to an end.
[1:00:22] It started AT A POINT, BUT IT COMES TO
[1:00:25] AN END. It produced, it comes, IT COMES
[1:00:28] UP, BUT THERE'S A TERMINATION.
[1:00:31] HALLELUJAH. Praise God. No wonder the
[1:00:33] Bible said IT'S APPOINTED
[1:00:36] AND MAN WANTS TO DIE.
[1:00:38] BUT AFTER DEATH, HALLELUJAH, THERE COMES
[1:00:41] THE JUDGMENT. WHAT IS THAT? IT'S A
[1:00:44] TERMINATION. LIFE STARTED BUT IT COMES
[1:00:47] TO AN END. HALLELUJAH. You know the
[1:00:51] other day I was talking to brother Bob
[1:00:53] and he we were talking about how young
[1:00:55] he was at one time. We hear brother Bob
[1:00:58] is not so young anymore AND PROBABLY
[1:01:01] HE'S GOING A LITTLE BIT SLOWER YOU KNOW
[1:01:04] BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT IS you know you
[1:01:06] know it's NOT GOING UP IT'S COMING DOWN
[1:01:09] AND THAT WHAT IT IS HALLELUJAH AFTER YOU
[1:01:12] REACH CERTAIN age you start going back
[1:01:14] you're pressing back from when you came
[1:01:17] are you there with me church it comes to
[1:01:19] an end hallelujah
[1:01:22] hallelujah why because it produces debt
[1:01:26] that's what THIS WHAT A LIFE DOES it
[1:01:28] produces death. So we in in one sense it
[1:01:32] looks like living. Hallelujah. You know
[1:01:35] AND ANOTHER SENSE HOW IT comes to AN
[1:01:38] ABRUPT IT STOP. That's it. Hallelujah.
[1:01:41] And the Bible said it stays there until
[1:01:44] judgment.
[1:01:47] Hallelujah. to hear brother Benham said
[1:01:50] you know brother and I'm I'm quoting
[1:01:52] this because uh brotherham was looking
[1:01:55] talking to his sister Dolores
[1:01:58] at the the time when his mother was
[1:02:01] transitioning
[1:02:04] but said I said Dolores
[1:02:08] there's an oak tree left
[1:02:11] of your window she said yes I said all
[1:02:16] summer long has It it been pretty with
[1:02:19] them green leaves.
[1:02:23] Yes. I said, "Who are they now?" She
[1:02:27] said, "Well,
[1:02:29] they are brown, yellowish, green." So, I
[1:02:33] said, "When when was they the prettiest?
[1:02:36] When they were green or when they are
[1:02:39] like now?" She said, "Now."
[1:02:42] And I said, "Yet they are dying."
[1:02:46] That's when life is most beautiful. It's
[1:02:49] a That's right. When she got to a place,
[1:02:53] I said to her, I said, "Mama,
[1:02:57] how does it feel now?" She said,
[1:02:59] "Wonderful."
[1:03:02] When she got to a place, she couldn't
[1:03:04] speak no more. I said, "Mama,
[1:03:07] I'm your preacher boy." Yet, Billy, do
[1:03:11] you recognize me? She couldn't speak no
[1:03:13] more. I said, "If Jesus still mean as
[1:03:16] much to you as he did the day you
[1:03:19] received him in the form of the Holy
[1:03:21] Ghost, bat your eyes real fast." And she
[1:03:25] battered her eyes and the tears running
[1:03:28] down her cheek. Then for a little while,
[1:03:31] then a little wind came in the room and
[1:03:34] she went out with hate. He said, "Oh
[1:03:37] yes, see it's all right. A tree hungs
[1:03:41] its leaf and the first thing you know
[1:03:46] that leaf begins to color when life
[1:03:49] leaves it. He said what happened? The
[1:03:52] life is in the leaf.
[1:03:55] It goes back to the root of the tree
[1:03:58] where it comes from
[1:04:00] only to come back again in the
[1:04:02] springtime to bring another leaf. He
[1:04:05] said and we are on a tree of life when
[1:04:09] we are reborn. He said when life leave
[1:04:12] this he said the life goes back to God
[1:04:16] that gives it to come again in the
[1:04:18] millennium with a leaf that can't drop
[1:04:22] off the tree the
[1:04:25] amen there you are eternal that
[1:04:28] perpetual life. Hallelujah. He said we
[1:04:32] have eternal life. You see they it's a
[1:04:35] they fall comfort is a what it is
[1:04:39] natural typing the spiritual.
[1:04:42] Hallelujah. And so church hallelujah
[1:04:46] we are not JUST SPEAKING ABOUT A life
[1:04:49] that is dying because we see and we feel
[1:04:52] it in our bodies. But
[1:04:55] if YOU RECEIVE ETERNAL LIFE, HALLELUJAH,
[1:04:59] WHAT YOU RECEIVE IS ANOTHER LIFE in this
[1:05:02] mortal life. ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH?
[1:05:05] AND THAT ETERNAL LIFE, YOUR JOURNEY, AND
[1:05:08] THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT, CHURCH. YOUR
[1:05:10] JOURNEY TO ETERNITY DOES NOT START WHEN
[1:05:13] YOU GET TO HEAVEN. IT STARTS HERE AND
[1:05:17] NOW.
[1:05:19] HALLELUJAH. Your journey TO THE
[1:05:21] ETERNITIES. HALLELUJAH. IN OTHER WORDS,
[1:05:24] HALLELUJAH. THE EXPERIENCES UH JUST AS
[1:05:27] HOW YOU'RE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE MORTAL
[1:05:30] LIFE. HALLELUJAH. YOU MUST BE ABLE TO
[1:05:33] EXPERIENCE ETERNAL LIFE HERE and now.
[1:05:37] Hallelujah. Praise God. And so Peter
[1:05:41] SAID 1 PETER 1 and verse 23 HE SAID
[1:05:44] BEING BORN again not of corruptible seed
[1:05:47] but incorruptible seed by the word of
[1:05:50] God which liveth and abideth forever.
[1:05:53] Hallelujah. He said for all flesh IS AS
[1:05:56] GRASS AND THAT IS TRUE BY MARK. ALL OUR
[1:05:59] FLESH IS LIKE GRASS. HALLELUJAH. AND THE
[1:06:03] glory and all the glory of man as the
[1:06:05] flower of the grass. for the grass
[1:06:09] witherth. That's what is happening to
[1:06:11] US. UH THIS MORTAL LIFE LISTEN.
[1:06:14] HALLELUJAH. WE WANT TO HOLD ON TO IT. WE
[1:06:17] WANT TO ACHIEVE as much out of it. But
[1:06:20] let me tell you something. WE HAVE SEEN
[1:06:22] IT OVER AND OVER. We worked so hard.
[1:06:26] Brother M. IS THAT TRUE? WE WORKED SO
[1:06:28] HARD TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING. AND BROTHER
[1:06:31] MARK, THERE COMES A DAY YOU SIT ON YOUR
[1:06:33] VERANDA, HAVE YOUR BLANKET OVER YOUR
[1:06:35] SHOULDER looking on, AND NOTHING THAT
[1:06:38] YOU WORK FOR HAVE no use for you.
[1:06:42] It's just there.
[1:06:45] ALL YOUR LABOR IS JUST THERE. ARE YOU
[1:06:48] THERE, MY CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. WHICH
[1:06:50] means that if THIS IS THE ONLY HOPE THAT
[1:06:54] YOU HAVE, YOU LABOR, THEN YOU DIE.
[1:06:58] BUT THERE'S GREATER HOPE, CHURCH.
[1:07:01] HALLELUJAH. IN ETERNAL LIFE.
[1:07:04] ARE YOU THERE, CHURCH? SO, I'M NOT JUST
[1:07:06] POINTING YOU TO JUST LIVING TO THE
[1:07:09] CONDITION OF MORTAL LIFE, BUT I'M
[1:07:12] POINTING you to eternal life because
[1:07:15] this one, it withers and it fade. YOU
[1:07:18] FEEL YOUNG AND STRONG AND BEAUTIFUL.
[1:07:21] HALLELUJAH. WHEN YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR,
[1:07:23] H THE PROJECTION THAT you see, it's all
[1:07:26] LOOKING GOOD. HALLELUJAH. BUT YOU KNOW
[1:07:29] little by little the creeks and and THE
[1:07:32] CRINKLES START SETTING. WHAT WHAT WHAT
[1:07:34] IS HAPPENING? DEATH IS SETTING in
[1:07:39] eventually it fall away. But the Bible
[1:07:42] said but the word of the Lord endure it
[1:07:46] forever. And this is the word by which
[1:07:49] the gospel
[1:07:51] is preached.
[1:07:53] Hallelujah.
[1:07:55] Hallelujah. And so church, this life,
[1:07:59] this seed is corruptible.
[1:08:02] This seed of corruption,
[1:08:05] this seed will comes to an end. This
[1:08:08] seed will get sick. This seed will get
[1:08:11] tired. This seed will get RARELY
[1:08:18] YOU. HALLELUJAH. YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF IN
[1:08:20] SITUATION AT TIMES YOU'RE WONDERING HOW
[1:08:23] DID I GET HERE? HALLELUJAH. BUT THAT
[1:08:26] WHAT THIS LIFE PRODUCES. THERE'S NO
[1:08:28] CERTAINTY HERE. ARE YOU THERE, CHURCH?
[1:08:31] IT COMES TO AN END BY REASON OF THE LIFE
[1:08:34] THAT is it's operating through.
[1:08:37] HALLELUJAH. AND SO IT CANNOT BE THE
[1:08:40] ULTIMATE OF OUR FAITH. THERE GOT TO BE
[1:08:43] MORE THAN THIS CHURCH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:47] Because it cannot be sustained.
[1:08:51] And so I'm bringing the contrast between
[1:08:54] the two. Hallelujah. But said in the
[1:08:58] message a prisoner he said and now when
[1:09:01] I see like you're sitting up there using
[1:09:05] fans talking it said that mean you're
[1:09:08] living but it's only only a shadow of
[1:09:12] life
[1:09:16] because anything has got to have
[1:09:19] darkness in it TO MAKE A SHADOW. IT'S A
[1:09:23] SEA BECAUSE A SHADOW has to possess so
[1:09:27] much darkness and so much light to make
[1:09:30] a shadow AND IT CAN BE ALL TOGETHER DARK
[1:09:34] AND IT can't be alltogether light.
[1:09:36] Hallelujah. He said it is if there's
[1:09:39] DARK IT IS REAL dark and it is light. He
[1:09:43] said there's no shadow.
[1:09:46] Nothing make a shadow. But if it's MIXED
[1:09:48] WITH DARK AND LIGHT IT MAKES A SHADOW.
[1:09:51] WHAT BETTER BUT I MUST TALK YOU ABOUT
[1:09:52] CHURCH LIFE
[1:09:55] HALLELUJAH AS LONG AS HALLELUJAH WE LIVE
[1:09:58] HERE AND WE SUBJECTED AND WATCH MY WORD
[1:10:01] carefully because hallelujah IF WE'RE
[1:10:04] SUBJECTED HALLELUJAH TO THE CONDITION OF
[1:10:07] THIS MORTAL LIFE UH H THAT EACH TIME
[1:10:10] SOMETHING HAPPENED THERE'S NO THERE'S NO
[1:10:13] RESOLVE TO IT WHAT HAPPENED TO US CHURCH
[1:10:16] HELLO WE HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED BY THE
[1:10:18] DARKNESS HALLELUJAH AND SO AND SO THE
[1:10:22] DARKNESS IF IT IS ALLOWED IT WILL TAKE
[1:10:24] YOU OVER. NO WONDER DAVID SAID THOUGH I
[1:10:27] WALK TO THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF
[1:10:30] DEATH AND FEAR NO EVIL FOR THOU ART WITH
[1:10:33] ME.
[1:10:35] ARE YOU THERE CHURCH? BECAUSE IT'S JUST
[1:10:37] A SHADOW BUT BUT IT HAS LIGHT IN IT. WE
[1:10:41] GOING TO SEE AS WE GO ON SAID we are
[1:10:44] really shadows of light. Hallelujah. In
[1:10:47] other word, the the experience that we
[1:10:50] have HERE SPEAKS OF NOT JUST HOW IT'S
[1:10:53] NOT ALL TOGETHER DARK. IN OTHER WORDS,
[1:10:55] WE HAVE SOME SEMBLANCE of experience
[1:10:57] that will POINT US BACK TO THE REALITY
[1:11:00] OF GOD'S WORD. BUT YET, STILL THERE ARE
[1:11:02] INSTANCES that will keep us into
[1:11:04] captivity. ARE YOU THERE, ME, CHURCH?
[1:11:07] BUT WHAT WE NEED IS NOT JUST TO LIVE
[1:11:09] UNDER A SHADOW EXPERIENCE. WHAT WE NEED
[1:11:12] IS AN EXPERIENCE THAT WILL BRING GOD ON
[1:11:15] THE SCENE IN HIS FULLNESS.
[1:11:17] HALLELUJAH. So we really a shadow of
[1:11:20] light. You're reflecting life from
[1:11:23] somewhere. So you if you are a
[1:11:26] Christian, this being a shadow, it only
[1:11:29] prove there is a life where you can't
[1:11:32] die because this life has death in it.
[1:11:37] BUT A SHADOW BECAUSE YOU'RE A LIVING
[1:11:39] moving creature with abilities to see
[1:11:42] and think and move and talk the five
[1:11:45] senses of the of THE BODY BUT YET YOU
[1:11:49] KNOW THERE ARE THEY ARE dying and
[1:11:52] there's so much trouble you know it can
[1:11:55] be it's a it's a reflection see there's
[1:11:58] life and death mixed together
[1:12:02] hallelujah hallelujah and so church this
[1:12:06] mortal life. It comprises of that life
[1:12:11] and death mixing together. Hallelujah.
[1:12:13] And we're going to see that tonight.
[1:12:15] That's what is it? Hallelujah. But
[1:12:18] listen. Hallelujah. As we live and of of
[1:12:21] our experiences really. Hallelujah. Is
[1:12:23] it in our Christian journey? Hallelujah.
[1:12:26] THE EXPERIENCE ALSO MUST BRING OUR FAITH
[1:12:29] INTO OPERATION. HALLELUJAH. that at
[1:12:32] times when you sick AND YOU BELIEVE GOD
[1:12:36] HALLELUJAH WHAT WHAT YOUR FAITH DID IT
[1:12:38] TAKES the situation AND BRING SOMETHING
[1:12:42] A RESULT HALLELUJAH THAT WAS UNEXPECTED
[1:12:45] HALLELUJAH AND SO WHEN THE DOCTOR SAY
[1:12:48] IT'S IMPOSSIBLE AND YOUR FAITH SAY I
[1:12:50] BELIEVE GOD ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH WHAT
[1:12:53] IS IT IT'S LIGHT AND DARKNESS ARE YOU
[1:12:55] THERE ME CHURCH HALLELUJAH BUT FOR YOU
[1:12:58] WHO BELIEVE GOD WHO'S A CHRISTIAN LISTEN
[1:13:01] THE DARKNESS CANNOT WIN. HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:04] PRAISE GOD. WHY? BECAUSE OF YOUR FAITH
[1:13:07] IN THE UNFAILING WORD OF GOD.
[1:13:10] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Praise God. And
[1:13:14] so, brother, in scripting this, we
[1:13:17] getting there a little bit. In in
[1:13:20] scripting this, HE SPEAKS OF THIS LIFE
[1:13:23] AS A BOOK,
[1:13:25] you know, like a book.
[1:13:28] And you know a book, a story, brother
[1:13:31] Mark, it has characters.
[1:13:35] It has different sceneries and plots and
[1:13:37] high points and low points. And it's
[1:13:40] like a book. You know, you're you're
[1:13:42] reading it and hallelujah. and and you
[1:13:45] know, Revelation 20. In verse 11, he
[1:13:48] said, "And I saw a great white throne,
[1:13:50] and to him that sat on it, from whence's
[1:13:54] face the earth hurt, and the heaven fled
[1:13:56] away, and there was found no place for
[1:13:59] them." And I saw the dead, small and
[1:14:02] great, standing stand before God. And
[1:14:05] the books were open, and another book
[1:14:08] was open, which was the book of life.
[1:14:11] And the dead were judged out of those
[1:14:15] things which were written in the book
[1:14:19] according to their works. Now that is
[1:14:22] very important. Hallelujah. Because
[1:14:24] listen, it was what was written in the
[1:14:27] book they were judged by. Are you THERE
[1:14:29] CHURCH? AND SO THESE THAT WERE JUDGED AT
[1:14:32] THE WHITE THRONE, THIS IS NOT THE BRIDE.
[1:14:35] THESE ARE THEY THAT CAME UP IN ON the
[1:14:37] second resurrection BUT THEY WERE JUDGED
[1:14:40] BY THEIR WORKS. ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH?
[1:14:43] REMEMBER WHAT THE BIBLE SAID?
[1:14:44] HALLELUJAH. BY YOUR WORKSH YOU CANNOT BE
[1:14:47] JUSTIFIED. THERE'S NO WORK. THERE'S
[1:14:50] NOTHING THAT YOU CAN DO IN THIS MORTAL
[1:14:52] LIFE UH THAT WILL REP REPRESENT
[1:14:55] RIGHTEOUSNESS OF PERFECTION. ARE YOU
[1:14:57] THERE WITH ME CHURCH? BUT NOW
[1:14:59] HALLELUJAH. THE BRIDE IS NOT JUDGED BY
[1:15:01] HER WORKS. THE BRIDE IS JUDGED BY HER
[1:15:04] FAITH. ARE YOU THERE IN THE ME CHURCH?
[1:15:06] AND SO SHE WAS RAPTURED BASED ON HER
[1:15:09] BELIEF IN GOD. BUT HERE THE BOOKS THAT
[1:15:13] HAS THE RECORD. WHICH RECORD? THE RECORD
[1:15:16] OF THEIR LIVES. THE THINGS THAT THEY DO
[1:15:19] HERE. BUT CHURCH WHEN YOU SEE IT, YOU'RE
[1:15:22] SEEING LIGHTS AND PEOPLE JUST LIVING AS
[1:15:24] THE WEATHER THE WAY THEY WANT. BUT
[1:15:27] LISTEN, BUT WHEN GOD WAS REFERRING TO
[1:15:30] THEIR HURTY EXPERIENCE, HE SAID THEIR
[1:15:33] LIFE WAS WRITTEN IN A BOOK AND IT WAS
[1:15:37] RECORD THE EXPERIENCES. HALLELUJAH. And
[1:15:40] so, hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:15:44] But the bride was already raptured. She
[1:15:48] was justified not by works but by her
[1:15:51] faith. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:15:55] Amen.
[1:15:56] And so when it came into this mortal
[1:15:58] life church became sinful. The script of
[1:16:02] our life remember when we came into the
[1:16:04] this world when we when we were born we
[1:16:06] were born in sin and THE SCRIPT OF OUR
[1:16:09] LIFE WHAT WAS WRITTEN IN THE BOOK.
[1:16:11] HALLELUJAH. OH MY. IF YOU COULD HAVE
[1:16:14] SEEN MY LIFE BEFORE AND READ WHAT'S
[1:16:17] THERE. IT WAS ALL BAD.
[1:16:20] HALLELUJAH. THE RECORD OF MY LIFE.
[1:16:23] LISTEN CHURCH. EACH AND EVERY ONE OF US.
[1:16:25] UH GOD HAS A RECORD OF YOUR LIFE. IT'S
[1:16:28] IN THE book and it IT CAPTURES YOUR
[1:16:31] EXPERIENCE HERE AND HURT ALL THE
[1:16:35] INSTANCES. EACH TIME YOU YOU'RE IN
[1:16:38] CHURCH IS RECORDED. THAT'S WHY I'M
[1:16:40] SAYING TO YOU, YOU BEING IN CHURCH,
[1:16:42] YOU'RE NOT JUST HERE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:16:45] BECAUSE YOU WANT TO BE HERE, BUT BECAUSE
[1:16:48] IN GOD'S RECORD, GOD HAD ALREADY
[1:16:51] POSITIONED you being here.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU THERE, MY CHURCH? AND SO WHAT
[1:16:56] YOU'RE DOING, HALLELUJAH. YOU'RE
[1:16:58] UNFOLDING THE SCRIPT. HALLELUJAH. AND
[1:17:02] YOU'RE STEPPING INTO THE REALITY OF the
[1:17:04] script. ARE YOU THERE, MY CHURCH? SO
[1:17:07] WHEN WE ALL CAME INTO THIS WORLD,
[1:17:10] HALLELUJAH, OUR LIVES WERE INSCRIPTED.
[1:17:13] HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:17:14] AND WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE LAMB'S BOOK
[1:17:16] OF LIFE. BUT WE KNOW THAT WE HAD LIFE.
[1:17:21] AND OUR LIFE WAS RECORDED IN THE BOOK OF
[1:17:23] LIFE.
[1:17:25] So all WE WERE UNFOLDING WAS LIFE. ARE
[1:17:29] YOU THERE CHURCH? BUT THE STORY, OH MY,
[1:17:34] the story of my life.
[1:17:37] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. IF YOU HAD READ
[1:17:40] THAT PART OF THE STORY OF THE MARK, YOU
[1:17:42] WOULDN'T HAVE WANTED TO BE acquainted
[1:17:44] with me because the STORY OF THAT SIDE
[1:17:47] OF MY LIFE WAS BAD
[1:17:50] ME CHURCH. BUT GOD HAVE IT IN A
[1:17:53] SCRIPTURE THAT THERE HAS COME A TIME IN
[1:17:55] MY EARTHLY JOURNEY IN MY EXPERIENCE.
[1:17:59] HALLELUJAH. THAT I WOULD COME IN contact
[1:18:01] with another life.
[1:18:04] Are you there ME CHURCH? AND SO THAT
[1:18:06] I'VE EXPERIENCED IT CHANGES THE ORDER OF
[1:18:09] MY LIFE. UH I'M NO LONGER SUBJECTED TO
[1:18:13] THE BOOK OF LIFE. UH ARE YOU THERE
[1:18:15] CHURCH? I'M NOW SUBJECTED TO ANOTHER
[1:18:17] BOOK. HALLELUJAH. Praise God.
[1:18:21] Hallelujah.
[1:18:23] So there's an order to our life.
[1:18:27] Hallelujah. The story of our lives. You
[1:18:31] know there's so much story really. You
[1:18:34] know, you know,
[1:18:36] man, I I I could tell you, you know,
[1:18:39] when me when I met my wife, you know, I
[1:18:42] just saw her at at a at a game at a we
[1:18:45] had a sport day and I met her there and
[1:18:48] you know, I was just bold went up and
[1:18:50] saw this beautiful young lady and I I
[1:18:53] said a few words and not knowing that
[1:18:56] three years after 3 years after brother
[1:18:58] John I would met her again.
[1:19:01] How did that happen? I don't know. But
[1:19:04] it was as a result of meeting her, I was
[1:19:07] able to meet the virgin there Lynston
[1:19:10] because if I was in ANOTHER PARISH, I
[1:19:12] WOULDN'T HAVE MET HER. And I would and
[1:19:14] I'm almost CERTAIN I WOULD HAVE MET THE
[1:19:16] VIRGIN THERE. But you know what I'm
[1:19:18] saying TO YOU? BUT IN GOD'S RECORD,
[1:19:21] GOD HAD ALREADY POSITIONED ME TO BE A
[1:19:24] PART OF THE BODY OF CHRIST.

[1:21:03] was wrote in it too. Everything you done
[1:21:06] under that nature was put in a book
[1:21:09] called the book of life. You see there
[1:21:11] notice in Daniel when he came to the
[1:21:14] ancients of days whose hair was as white
[1:21:17] as bull and 10,000 time 10,000 came with
[1:21:22] him to minister to him. He said that's
[1:21:24] the bride. And then the books were open
[1:21:29] and another book was open which was the
[1:21:31] book of life. It says see there are
[1:21:34] saints already there the church the
[1:21:36] bride and another book was open which
[1:21:40] was the book of life. Hallelujah. Praise

[1:21:59] IS A JOURNEY OF LIFE. IT STARTED WITH
[1:22:02] LIFE. BUT WHEN WE CAME, THE LIFE THAT WE
[1:22:05] HAD, HALLELUJAH. COULD NOT GO ANY
[1:22:07] FURTHER. THE BIBLE SAID THREE SCORE AND
[1:22:09] 10 AFTER WHICH YOU YOU GO DOWN. NOW YOU
[1:22:13] THERE ME CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. BUT I'M NOT
[1:22:15] JUST TALKING ABOUT THIS MORTAL LIFE. I'M
[1:22:19] TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING GREATER.
[1:22:21] HALLELUJAH. GREATER IN EXPERIENCE,
[1:22:23] GREATER IN UNDERSTANDING, GREATER
[1:22:26] KNOWLEDGE, SOMETHING THAT IS GREATER
[1:22:28] THAN OURSELVES
[1:22:30] AND THAT IS ETERNAL LIFE.
[1:22:34] HALLELUJAH. ETERNAL LIFE, CHURCH.
[1:22:36] HALLELUJAH. PRAISE GOD. HALLELUJAH. Can
[1:22:40] can you bring that image up for me?
[1:22:42] Hallelujah.
[1:22:44] You know, I got this image from one of
[1:22:46] the brother. He he preached on it and I
[1:22:49] think this image fits perfectly.
[1:22:51] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You see what
[1:22:54] we're looking AT TONIGHT, CHURCH.
[1:22:56] HALLELUJAH. You know, brother talked
[1:22:58] about what the triunity of our beings.
[1:23:01] Hallelujah. And so we are body, spirit
[1:23:04] and soul and physically, you know, you
[1:23:06] know, we we our body, you know, human
[1:23:08] element, you know, physical form where
[1:23:10] we interact and we live and we BREATHE
[1:23:12] AND WE DO ALL OF THESE NATURAL STUFF
[1:23:14] REALLY BY our five senses. And so YOU
[1:23:18] KNOW BUT GOING BACK to the soul you see
[1:23:21] IN THAT WHITE ERA. HALLELUJAH. YOU SEE
[1:23:24] HALLELUJAH BROTHER Benam said we had ARE
[1:23:27] PART OF CHRIST AT THE BEGINNING. WE WERE
[1:23:30] [screaming] A PART OF THE WORD TO BE TO
[1:23:32] IN THE BEGINNING. AND SO IF YOU HAD COME
[1:23:34] BY WAY OF THE WORD IN OTHER WORDS IF YOU
[1:23:37] CAME LIVING and expressing THE ETERNAL
[1:23:40] LIFE OF GOD THEN THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN
[1:23:42] NO SHADOW INSIDE OF YOU. YOUR SOUL WOULD
[1:23:46] HAVE BEEN ENGULFED WITH LIGHT AND
[1:23:48] EXPERIENCE OF THE ETERNITIES. ARE YOU
[1:23:51] THERE CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. AND LISTEN.
[1:23:54] AND IF YOUR SOUL, HALLELUJAH, DOES NOT
[1:23:56] HAVE ANY LINEAGE WITH GOD, THAT'S HOW
[1:24:00] DARK YOUR SOUL WILL BE. IT WILL BE TOTAL
[1:24:03] DARKNESS AND ABSENCE. ARE YOU THERE, MY
[1:24:05] CHURCH? BUT PRAISE GOD. HALLELUJAH. WHEN
[1:24:08] WE CAME INTO THE WORLD, HALLELUJAH, WE
[1:24:11] BECAME SINFUL BY REASON OF BIRTH.
[1:24:15] HALLELUJAH. THE BIBLE SAID WE WERE BORN
[1:24:17] IN SIN AND SHAPED IN INIQUITY. In sin we
[1:24:21] were conceived and because of THE SINFUL
[1:24:23] NATURE OF OUR BIRTH, WE CAME INTO THE
[1:24:26] WORLD. HALLELUJAH. WITH THAT DARKNESS,
[1:24:29] BUT LISTEN CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. BUT IN
[1:24:32] HALLELUJAH. THAT HARD COMPARTMENTAL
[1:24:36] brother Barry was preaching about it. He
[1:24:37] said 3% HALLELUJAH. OF THE LIFE INSIDE
[1:24:41] HALLELUJAH. IS A SEED GERM of life. ARE
[1:24:45] YOU THERE ME CHURCH? WHAT'S THIS? IT IS
[1:24:47] LIGHT THAT IS THERE BUT THAT LIGHT IS
[1:24:50] DOMINANT. IT DOES NOT TAKE THE DOMINANCE
[1:24:53] FORCE. ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH? AND SO
[1:24:55] WHAT WE WERE EXPERIENCING, WE WERE
[1:24:58] EXPERIENCING THE DARK SHADOWS OF THIS
[1:25:00] LIFE. HALLELUJAH. BUT LISTEN.
[1:25:03] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. LISTEN. BUT IF
[1:25:06] YOU BELONG TO GOD, IF YOU ARE A CHILD OF
[1:25:09] GOD, WHEN YOU CAME INTO THIS WORLD, GOD
[1:25:12] HAD PUT A LITTLE LIGHT in it. Are you
[1:25:14] there, MY CHURCH? THAT KNOWING THAT ONE
[1:25:16] DAY, ONE DAY ALONG YOUR JOURNEY, ONE DAY
[1:25:20] ALONG YOUR LIFE EXPERIENCE, HALLELUJAH,
[1:25:23] THAT LIGHT, HAL WILL BE MAGNIFIED. ARE
[1:25:26] YOU THERE ME CHURCH? THAT ANOTHER LIGHT,
[1:25:28] HALLELUJAH, WHICH IS THE LIGHT OF his
[1:25:30] presence, WILL COME AND DO WHAT? AND
[1:25:32] STRIKE THAT SEED.
[1:25:34] HALLELUJAH. And so if you were BORN INTO
[1:25:38] THE SMARTER LIFE AND YOU DID NOT HAVE
[1:25:40] THAT DREAM SEED OF LIFE INSIDE OF YOU,
[1:25:43] HALLELUJAH, there's nowhere possible you
[1:25:46] CAN GO BACK AND CLAIM A SUNSHIP OF GOD.
[1:25:50] HALLELUJAH. CHURCH, LISTEN. OUR JOURNEY,
[1:25:52] HALLELUJAH. OUR JOURNEY DID NOT START
[1:25:55] WHEN WE CAME HERE, BUT OUR JOURNEY
[1:25:58] STARTED in Christ. BUT BECAUSE WE WERE
[1:26:01] BORN WRONG, WE CAME WITH A LIFEUH THAT'S
[1:26:05] DYING. HALLELUJAH. BUT GOD PROMISED that
[1:26:08] when he came, when we came here, HE
[1:26:10] PLACED A LIFE THERE AND HE PROMISED THAT
[1:26:13] ONE DAY, ONE DAY, CHURCH, HALLELUJAH,
[1:26:17] HE'S GOING TO change our experience.
[1:26:19] He's going to take THE DARKNESS OUT AND
[1:26:22] HE'S going to bring that light to life.
[1:26:25] Oh my. Oh, sorry to be shouting. I'm
[1:26:28] getting a LITTLE BIT EXCITED.
[1:26:30] HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE there's hope in it,
[1:26:32] church. There's hope in it. THERE'S HOPE
[1:26:34] IN THIS LIFE. HALLELUJAH. YES, WE ARE
[1:26:36] LIVING MORTAL. YES, WE ARE SUFFERING.
[1:26:39] YES, we we feel defeated. But church,
[1:26:42] THERE'S HOPE. THE HOPE IS THAT GOD PUT A
[1:26:45] LITTLE light in it knowing that one day,
[1:26:48] one day he's going to come and he's
[1:26:50] GOING TO KNOCK AT YOUR DOOR. And when he
[1:26:52] knocks, he said, "If you hear my voice,"
[1:26:54] he said, "Open the door and let me in.
[1:26:58] Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:27:02] Hallelujah. God want to change your
[1:27:05] experience.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But what he does
[1:27:10] before he does that, brother M.
[1:27:12] Hallelujah. He had to come and to strike
[1:27:16] the seed. Brother said we did not become
[1:27:20] seed by our new birth, but because that
[1:27:23] germ seed of life was there. Hallelujah.
[1:27:26] That's why we are able to reborn for
[1:27:29] inse
[1:27:31] there's nothing to quit in. Are you
[1:27:34] there ME CHURCH? THERE'S NOTHING TO COME
[1:27:36] ALIVE. THERE WILL TAKE A FORM OF
[1:27:39] GODLINESS UPON THE FLESH AND UPON the
[1:27:41] spirit but it cannot reach the soul. Are
[1:27:45] you there church? Oh my church is a
[1:27:47] living experience of living eternal. I I
[1:27:51] want TO TELL YOU TONIGHT uh that THERE
[1:27:53] GOT TO COME A TIME UH HALLELUJAH LIVING
[1:27:56] IN YOUR MORTAL STATE UH THERE GOT TO
[1:27:58] COME A TIME JUST AS HOW YOU ACCEPT BY
[1:28:01] YOUR FIVE SENSES THE MORTAL CONDITION
[1:28:04] THERE GOT to come A TIME HALLELUJAH FROM
[1:28:07] HALLELUJAH in your eternal state you got
[1:28:10] to move away from your mortal condition
[1:28:12] and step in your eternal condition there
[1:28:16] you got to there going to come a time
[1:28:18] when you got to step in the eternal
[1:28:20] eternal life that is in you now.
[1:28:26] It got to come alive.
[1:28:30] So the Bible said in the beginning 1
[1:28:33] John 1 was the word.
[1:28:37] When the word was with God and the word
[1:28:40] was God, the same was in the beginning
[1:28:44] with God. All things were made by him
[1:28:47] that without him was not anything made
[1:28:49] that was made.
[1:28:52] In him was life and the life is the
[1:28:57] light
[1:28:59] of man.
[1:29:01] Hallelujah.
[1:29:02] The life is the light. Hallelujah. And
[1:29:07] so when he that light
[1:29:10] was struck by the by the life of God,
[1:29:14] it is to bring that germ seed of of
[1:29:16] life. Hallelujah. Alive in you to
[1:29:20] produce the eternal things. So that germ
[1:29:24] of life was in us when we came into the
[1:29:27] world. Hallelujah. But we say we know
[1:29:30] that it was dominant. Hallelujah.
[1:29:33] Waiting for the time. Hallelujah.
[1:29:37] Amen. Waiting for that hour. Waiting for
[1:29:40] the the experience. Hallelujah. And
[1:29:43] listen what I'm saying TO YOU BECAUSE I
[1:29:45] DON'T WANT YOU JUST TO FEEL LIKE because
[1:29:47] you're in CHURCH HEARING ME. HALLELUJAH.
[1:29:49] THAT THAT THAT THIS IS NOT JUST REGULAR
[1:29:51] SERVICE CHURCH. But it is a time where
[1:29:54] Hallelujah. when the Holy Spirit uh is
[1:29:57] calling back to the seed in you. Are you
[1:29:59] there, church? Either to WAKE IT UP OR
[1:30:02] TO GIVE IT MORE EXPERIENCE OF ITSELF.
[1:30:05] ARE YOU THERE IN THE CHURCH? BECAUSE
[1:30:07] THERE'S always something happening with
[1:30:08] the seed. Hallelujah.
[1:30:11] It's not just you sitting down, nothing
[1:30:13] happening. THERE'S ALWAYS AN EXPERIENCE.
[1:30:16] JUST AS YOU WAKE UP, HALLELUJAH. AND YOU
[1:30:18] GO OUT AND YOU WORK AND YOU WORK AND YOU
[1:30:21] UNFOLD AND YOU UNFOLD. You do this, YOU
[1:30:23] GO THERE, YOU UNFOLDING THING. IF YOU'RE
[1:30:25] A CHRISTIAN AND GOD IS IN YOUR SOUL,
[1:30:28] THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING HAPPENING. ARE
[1:30:30] YOU THERE, CHURCH? SOMETIME YOU CAN'T
[1:30:32] EXPLAIN IT. SOMETIME YOU CAN'T DO IT.
[1:30:34] ALL YOU CAN DO IS SHOUT. SOMETIME YOU
[1:30:37] JUST WALK AROUND. SOMETIME YOU CRY. WHY?
[1:30:40] BECAUSE something is happening on the
[1:30:41] inside.
[1:30:45] Hallelujah.
[1:30:47] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:30:50] Hallelujah. And so when we came into
[1:30:52] this mortal world, Hallelujah.
[1:30:56] Now we start talk languages.
[1:30:59] Hallelujah. We are in a mortal world
[1:31:02] because we are living in mortal bodies.
[1:31:05] Hallelujah. But we are not mortal
[1:31:07] people.
[1:31:08] Oh my. We are not mortal people. We're
[1:31:13] immortal people, but we're just LIVING
[1:31:15] IN A MORTAL BODY. HALLELUJAH. You know,
[1:31:18] ONE THING I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED, YOU
[1:31:20] KNOW, EACH TIME in the in the in in the
[1:31:21] in the biblical experiences, you know,
[1:31:24] when we see when the angel of the Lord
[1:31:26] comes and and HE VISIT THE PROPHET AND
[1:31:28] the presence of that angel will cause
[1:31:31] the prophet TO FALL LIKE A DEAD MAN.
[1:31:34] HALLELUJAH. AND AND so the angel have to
[1:31:36] touch AND TO REVIVE. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S
[1:31:39] WHAT IT IS, CHURCH. THIS MORTAL BODY
[1:31:41] CANNOT CONTAIN THE ETERNAL THINGS. ARE
[1:31:44] YOU THERE, CHURCH? THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU
[1:31:46] CAME INTO THE IMMORTAL BODY, HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:48] YOU ARE SUBJECTED TO mortal experience.
[1:31:51] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And so,
[1:31:53] Hallelujah. What am I saying to you? I'M
[1:31:56] SAYING YOU HALLELUJAH. THE WAY GOD HAS
[1:31:58] the work of immortality INSIDE YOU. IT'S
[1:32:01] NOT just changing your soul. HE'S
[1:32:03] CHANGING YOUR BODY, your spirit, and
[1:32:06] your soul. Because everything has to
[1:32:07] come OUT OF THE EQUATION OF eternal
[1:32:12] church. It's an OPERATION CHANGE.
[1:32:16] BUT IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU'RE SEEING.
[1:32:20] It depends on what you're looking at.
[1:32:23] Hallelujah.
[1:32:25] Hallelujah.
[1:32:26] And so when we came into the world, we
[1:32:30] life
[1:32:32] was dominant because of our first birth.
[1:32:36] Hallelujah.
[1:32:38] Hallelujah.
[1:32:40] He created a part for you and I church
[1:32:44] to bring that seed to life
[1:32:46] by our whole life experiencing.
[1:32:50] Hallelujah.
[1:32:51] The Bible says in him was life and the
[1:32:55] life was the life of man. Hallelujah.
[1:32:59] And so church in this life WE SAW
[1:33:02] INSTANCES HAD A REFLECTION. HALLELUJAH.
[1:33:06] NOT OF this life. Hallelujah. saying to
[1:33:09] you, hallelujah, as we go, AS WE

[1:33:21] did, and this is the foolishness of what
[1:33:23] God is doing. All the pieces
[1:33:37] of the most The dream
[1:33:49] of producing life
[1:33:51] in the simplest form

[1:34:23] realize that Mike was there.
[1:34:28] Oh my.
[1:34:30] Yeah, I think I got it right.
[1:34:33] instances,
[1:34:35] the revelation of God keep on unfolding.
[1:34:39] It doesn't come all at once, but little
[1:34:42] by little, little by little, experience
[1:34:45] by experience. Today, you're not feeling
[1:34:47] well, and you put it in the church
[1:34:49] group. Can you pray for me? Hallelujah.
[1:34:52] And next year, this time, you didn't
[1:34:54] even remember that you HAD A REQUEST.
[1:34:56] HALLELUJAH. WHY? BECAUSE GOD REMOVE it
[1:35:00] completely. remove it. Even from your
[1:35:02] own memory, you don't even remember that
[1:35:04] it's there. Are you there, MY CHURCH?
[1:35:06] BUT WHAT GOD IS [screaming] DOING

[1:35:21] SO, IT IS IN THE SHADOW. It is in the
[1:35:24] DARKNESS WHEN IT FEEL ALL HOPE IS LOST.
[1:35:28] THAT'S WHEN GOD STEP DOWN AND bring the
[1:35:31] supernatural on the scene. Oh my. GOD
[1:35:34] DOES AN OPERATION. BUT WHAT IS HE DOING?
[1:35:37] HE'S BRINGING THAT LITTLE SPECK OF LIFE.
[1:35:40] HE'S BRINGING IT TO LIFE BY THE
[1:35:42] EXPERIENCE. OH CHURCH, YOUR JOURNEY IS

[1:35:47] GOD IN YOUR SOUL.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:35:51] HALLELUJAH.
[1:35:53] It's happy. It's joyful to know that in
[1:35:58] my time of weakness, in my TIME OF
[1:36:02] TROUBLE, HALLELUJAH, GOD WANT TO CHANGE
[1:36:04] MY EXPERIENCE. He want to bring me into
[1:36:07] a greater order of the UNFOLDING OF THE
[1:36:10] LIFE. WHERE WHERE'S THAT LIFE? It is in
[1:36:12] you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But I want
[1:36:16] you to understand what is happening to
[1:36:18] you. Hallelujah. Because you see, we
[1:36:21] could take it all the way to heaven, but
[1:36:23] one DAY WE'LL GO TO HEAVEN. BROTHER
[1:36:24] MARK, CAN WE EXPERIENCE IT IN HEAVEN?
[1:36:26] WELL, LISTEN. I'M NOT IN HEAVEN RIGHT
[1:36:28] NOW.
[1:36:29] I'm here alone.
[1:36:33] I am here.
[1:36:35] If I'm going to experience God, I want
[1:36:38] to experience it now.
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; If God is a healer, I want to know now.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; IF HE'S A PROVIDER, I WANT TO KNOW NOW.
[1:36:47] ARE YOU THERE, CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. AND
[1:36:49] SO THE experience is change is TAKING US
[1:36:52] OUT OF THE MORTAL EXPERIENCES AND HE'S
[1:36:55] NOW BRINGING US BACK TO OUR ETERNAL
[1:36:58] STATE WHERE WE NOW SEE START SEEING THE
[1:37:02] IMPOSSIBLE AND THE THINGS THAT COULD NOT
[1:37:04] HAVE HAPPENED IN A NATURAL sense but THE
[1:37:07] SUPERNATURAL IS STEPPING IN. ARE YOU ME
[1:37:10] CHURCH? AND IT'S something sometime you
[1:37:13] can't even explain what is happening to
[1:37:15] you.
[1:37:16] You can't.
[1:37:18] You try, but you can't
[1:37:23] because sometimes it's it's impossible
[1:37:25] really to explain the supernatural
[1:37:28] things of God. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:37:32] Hallelujah. And so we saw in the book of
[1:37:36] Hebrews, Hebrews 11, hallelujah. The
[1:37:40] experience that they had, we saw faith
[1:37:43] brought the victory. And this is what
[1:37:45] I'm saying to you all. These are people
[1:37:47] who NEVER HAD THE BAPTISM of the Holy
[1:37:50] Ghost. Hallelujah. You know the baptism
[1:37:53] of the HOLY GHOST IS CHRIST in you. THE
[1:37:56] HOPE OF GLORY. YOU KNOW WHAT CHRIST
[1:37:57] COMES TO DO? HALLELUJAH. HE COMES IN THE
[1:38:01] SOUL IN THE FORM OF THE HOLY GHOST TO DO
[1:38:04] WHAT? TO NURTURE THE SOUL BACK TO ITS
[1:38:08] RIGHTFUL STATE. ARE YOU THERE, CHURCH?
[1:38:10] SO, IT'S NOT ABOUT ME. It's not about
[1:38:12] you. It's not about none of us. IT'S
[1:38:15] ABOUT THE CHRIST THAT IS IN YOU. ARE YOU
[1:38:17] THERE, MY CHURCH? BUT THESE PEOPLE NEVER
[1:38:19] HAD THE HOLY GHOST. THEY HAD AN
[1:38:22] ANOINTING THAT CAME UPON THEM.
[1:38:24] HALLELUJAH. AND GAVE THEM AN EXPERIENCE.
[1:38:27] AND YOU HEAR WHAT THE BIBLE SAID. THESE
[1:38:29] ALL DIED IN FATE, NOT HAVING RECEIVED
[1:38:32] THE PROMISES,
[1:38:36] but but having seen them a far off, and
[1:38:39] were persuaded of them, AND EMBRACED
[1:38:42] THEM, AND CONFESS that they were
[1:38:44] strangers and pilgrim on the hurt. For
[1:38:47] they that say such thing, for they say
[1:38:50] such thing declare plainly, that they
[1:38:53] seek a country. And truly if THEY HAD
[1:38:56] BEEN MINDFUL OF THE country from whence
[1:38:58] they came out of they might have had
[1:39:01] opportunity to HAVE RETURNED. BUT NOW
[1:39:04] THE DESIRE A BETTER COUNTRY THAT IS AN
[1:39:07] heavenly whose
[1:39:10] WHEREFORE GOD IS NOT ASHAMED TO call
[1:39:13] them their their God
[1:39:16] for he has prepared for them a city.
[1:39:19] Verse 23 he said for through faith
[1:39:22] subdue kingdom water righteous that
[1:39:25] obtain promises stop the mount of lon
[1:39:29] hallelujah quench the violence of f of
[1:39:33] fire escape the hedge of the sword out

[1:39:39] IN FIGHT TO FIGHT THE HARNESS OF THE
[1:39:42] ALIENS women receive the dead race to
[1:39:45] life again and others were tortured not
[1:39:49] accept accepting deliverance that they
[1:39:51] might obtain a better resurrection
[1:39:54] and others a trial of cruel mocking and
[1:39:57] scorching. Yeah. Mohovah bonds and
[1:40:00] imprisonment. They were stoned. They
[1:40:03] were s of sunder were tempted were slain
[1:40:06] with a sword. They wandered about in
[1:40:08] sheepkin and godskin being destitute
[1:40:11] afflicted of whom the world was not
[1:40:14] worthy. They wandered in desert, in
[1:40:17] mountain, in den. Hallelujah. And cave
[1:40:21] of the hurt. AND ALL AND THESE ALL
[1:40:24] having obtained a good report. Oh my.
[1:40:29] HALLELUJAH. HAVE YOU READ THE REPORT?
[1:40:33] Have you read the REPORT WHEN NOAH WAS
[1:40:36] THERE AND GOD SAW THE WORLD THAT IT WAS
[1:40:39] ALL SINFUL AND GOD SAID, "I'M COMING
[1:40:42] DOWN TO DESTROY IT." HALLELUJAH. BUT THE
[1:40:45] BUT NOAH FOUND GRACE.
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; HE FOUND GRACE. AND WHAT GOD DID? OH MY.
[1:40:51] LET'S GET INTO STUFF TONIGHT. OH MY.
[1:40:54] WHAT GOD DID? HALLELUJAH. GOD STEPPED
[1:40:57] DOWN. HALLELUJAH. AND GAVE NOAH A WORD.
[1:41:01] HALLELUJAH. DO YOU KNOW CHURCH?
[1:41:02] [screaming]
[1:41:03] HALLELUJAH. THEY SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WHEN
[1:41:05] NOAH WENT OUT AND HE GOT THAT COPPER
[1:41:08] WORD AND HE WAS CHIPPING AWAY WHAT HE
[1:41:11] WAS DOING. HE WAS WRITING HIS EXPERIENCE
[1:41:14] UPON THE heavenly things. ARE YOU THERE
[1:41:16] MY CHURCH? The thought didn't come from
[1:41:18] Noah. It came from God. ARE YOU THERE MY
[1:41:22] CHURCH? AND SO IT'S TIME NOAH GET THE
[1:41:24] HAMMER AND HE WAS NAILING. HE WAS
[1:41:27] BRINGING FORTH A part of the revelation.
[1:41:30] HALLELUJAH. BUT WHERE WAS THE CHURCH?
[1:41:33] WHERE WAS NOAH? He was not in heaven. He
[1:41:36] was right here on earth.
[1:41:38] Hallelujah. AND SO THE EXPERIENCE THAT
[1:41:41] HE HAD WAS UNFOLDING MORE OF THE MIND OF
[1:41:45] GOD.
[1:41:48] And so the intention is the intention IS
[1:41:52] IS TO BRING GOD'S WORD IN MANIFESTATION.
[1:41:56] HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES BY WAY
[1:41:59] OF THE WORD, IT CHANGES THE EXPERIENCE.
[1:42:02] IN TIME OF DEATH, IT CHANGES THE
[1:42:05] EXPERIENCE. In time OF SIN AND
[1:42:08] WORLDLINESS, IT CHANGES THE EXPERIENCE.
[1:42:12] HALLELUJAH. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:42:17] Amen.
[1:42:18] So we can focus.
[1:42:21] Hallelujah. On this life, Hallelujah.
[1:42:24] And look at it. It feels so innocent.
[1:42:29] As if, hey,
[1:42:32] let's just continue with it. It feels
[1:42:35] good.
[1:42:36] It feel achievable.
[1:42:38] It feel successful. We could continue
[1:42:41] with it. We could continue believing.
[1:42:44] Hallelujah. But at the end of it,
[1:42:47] there's great hope. Hallelujah.
[1:42:50] Hallelujah. But this is what I want you
[1:42:52] to catch this now. HALLELUJAH. BUT WHAT
[1:42:55] GOD WAS DOING, YOU SEE, CHURCH.
[1:42:58] HALLELUJAH. THE BIBLE SAID BROTHER SAID
[1:43:01] AND AND PAUL WRITES ALSO HERE HE SAID BY
[1:43:04] FAITH NOAH
[1:43:06] BY FAITH ABRAHAM what was ABRAHAM'S
[1:43:09] EXPERIENCE HALLELUJAH GOD BROUGHT HIM
[1:43:11] DOWN TO A POINT WHERE IT WAS TOTALLY
[1:43:14] IMPOSSIBLE THERE WAS NOTHING THERE TO
[1:43:17] SUGGEST THAT WHAT GOD SAID WOULD HAVE
[1:43:19] BEEN BROUGHT TO PASS HALLELUJAH BUT YOU
[1:43:22] KNOW WHAT THE BIBLE SAID BUT THE BIBLE
[1:43:23] SAID ABRAHAM kept his his testimony HE
[1:43:27] KEEP ON BELIEVING ME, CHURCH. AND THE
[1:43:30] MORE IMPOSSIBLE IT BECOMES, THE MORE HE
[1:43:33] LEAN TOWARDS THE SUPERNATURAL, BELIEVING
[1:43:36] THAT THE GOD WHO MADE THE PROMISE IS
[1:43:39] MORE THAN ABLE TO BRING IT TO PASS. ARE
[1:43:41] YOU THERE, CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. AND SAY
[1:43:44] OUT OF THE IMPOSSIBLE WHEN SARAH WAS 90.
[1:43:47] HALLELUJAH. AND AND AND ABRAHAM WAS
[1:43:50] GOING INTO HIS 100. HALLELUJAH. GOD
[1:43:52] BROUGHT IT TO PASS. HALLELUJAH. BUT LET
[1:43:55] ME ASK A QUESTION. WHEN THE BIBLE SAID
[1:43:57] ABRAHAM BELIEVED GOD, WHAT DID HE REALLY
[1:44:00] BELIEVE? HELLO. PAUL SAID, "WHAT DID
[1:44:03] ABRAHAM FOUND?" HALLELUJAH. He found THE
[1:44:06] MIND OF CHRIST. HELLO. BECAUSE ISAAC WAS
[1:44:09] NOT THERE. But where was Isaac? ISAAC
[1:44:12] WAS IN THE MIND OF GOD. Are you there,
[1:44:14] my church? AND IT TOOK FAITH TO PULL THE
[1:44:17] SUPERNATURAL INTO THE NATURAL to make
[1:44:20] the supernatural made express.

[1:44:35] Hallelujah. Hopefully we can finish this
[1:44:37] story. Hallelujah. But what was he
[1:44:39] doing? HE WAS BRINGING HALLELUJAH. THE
[1:44:43] LIFE. IT WAS THE LIFE. HAL THE streak of
[1:44:48] life. IT WAS CHRIST. BROTHER said in
[1:44:51] Abraham, it was Christ in Noah. IT WAS
[1:44:55] CHRIST IN JOSHUA. BUT WHAT IT WAS
[1:44:58] CHURCH? IT WAS THAT LIFE. WHICH LIFE?
[1:45:01] ETERNAL LIFE. HALLELUJAH. ARE YOU WITH
[1:45:04] ME, CHURCH? IT WAS COMING DOWN. BROTHER
[1:45:06] MARK, IT WAS GOING AND EACH TIME WE
[1:45:09] REACH A DISPENSATION, THE SEED CATCH THE
[1:45:12] WORD FOR THAT DISPENSATION. ARE YOU

[1:45:17] HALLELUJAH. AND SO WE SEE CHRIST IN
[1:45:19] NOAH, CHRIST IN ABRAHAM. WHAT ARE YOU
[1:45:22] WATCHING? WATCH THE LIFE. DON'T LOOK AT
[1:45:25] THE PERSON. WATCH THE LIFE. ARE YOU
[1:45:27] THERE, MY CHURCH? BECAUSE WHEN THE LIFE
[1:45:29] COME, IT PRODUCES THE WORD.
[1:45:33] HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:35] So the life was moving along.
[1:45:39] Hallelujah. It was moving along.
[1:45:41] Hallelujah. But brother Bam used this
[1:45:43] word. HALLELUJAH. IN THE TOKEN MESSAGE
[1:45:46] brother said. But when the life comes,
[1:45:50] THE LIFE COMES THROUGH THE BLOOD. ARE
[1:45:53] YOU THERE, CHURCH? WHICH WE UNDERSTAND,
[1:45:55] BROTHER MARK, WHAT THE BLOOD IS. THE
[1:45:58] BLOOD IS NOT THE CHEMISTRY, BUT THE
[1:46:00] BLOOD IS THE WORD. ARE YOU THERE,
[1:46:02] CHURCH? AND SO THE PEOPLE, HALLELUJAH,
[1:46:05] the seed in the hedgeh,
[1:46:09] they receive the blood. IT'S A BLOODY
[1:46:11] WORD. THEY CATCH THE BLOOD FOR THE H.
[1:46:14] AND THE BLOOD THAT THEY CATCH PRODUCES
[1:46:16] THE LIFE. ARE YOU ME CHURCH? SO WE'RE
[1:46:19] ABLE TO WATCH THE BLOOD STREAK. UH IT'S
[1:46:21] A BLOOD STREAK ALL THE WAY FROM GENESIS.
[1:46:24] HALLELUJAH. WHAT THAT BLOOD PRODUCES? IT
[1:46:26] PRODUCED eternal life.
[1:46:30] CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. ALL THE WAY FROM
[1:46:33] GENESIS.
[1:46:34] HALLELUJAH. The life comes through the
[1:46:39] blood. It was Christ's life all the way.
[1:46:44] Hallelujah. It depending on what you're
[1:46:47] seeing. The Bible could be a good story
[1:46:50] book
[1:46:52] and it could be a story of the life,
[1:46:55] eternal life
[1:46:57] in word form.
[1:46:59] You know why it's important for you to
[1:47:01] see the life that was before? Because in
[1:47:04] your day, in your experience, you got to
[1:47:07] see Christ for your day. that you may
[1:47:10] experience the word the Christ as he
[1:47:13] unveiled for your day that you can
[1:47:15] manifest the word hallelujah for your
[1:47:18] day. That's why it has to come through
[1:47:20] the blood. Hallelujah. It got to come
[1:47:23] through the blood which is the word of
[1:47:26] God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So it's
[1:47:30] just to catch a glimpse of that life and
[1:47:33] step into that perfect life. Hallelujah.
[1:47:36] And it changes the person of who you
[1:47:39] are. Hallelujah. And so you I'm saying
[1:47:42] to your church, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:47:45] If you hear his voice tonight,
[1:47:48] hallelujah, he's knocking at your door,
[1:47:50] h is trying to let you know that the
[1:47:53] reason WHY YOU'RE HERE IN CHURCH, you're
[1:47:55] here in church BECAUSE THE VOICE OF GOD
[1:47:57] IS HERE. AND THE VOICE OF GOD IS CALLING
[1:48:00] BACK TO YOU. HALLELUJAH. HE SAID TODAY
[1:48:03] IF YOU HEAR MY VOICE HE SAID HARDEN NOT
[1:48:06] YOUR HEART HE'S KNOCKING AT YOUR HEART'S
[1:48:09] DOOR BECAUSE HE WANT TO COME IN and he
[1:48:11] want to change IS YOUR EXPERIENCE THE
[1:48:14] VOICE OF GOD THAT ECHOES THE LIFE THAT
[1:48:17] SPEAK THE BLOOD THAT SPEAK IS KNOCKING
[1:48:20] AT YOUR DOOR HE WANTS TO BRING YOU OUT
[1:48:23] OF THIS MORTAL EXPERIENCE HALLELUJAH ARE
[1:48:26] YOU TIRED ARE YOU SICK THERE'S A VOICE
[1:48:28] HERE TONIGHT UH THAT CAN CHANGE YOUR
[1:48:30] EXPERIENCE HALLELUJAH BUT YOU GOT TO LET
[1:48:33] HIM IN. HE'S KNOCKING AT YOUR HEART DOOR
[1:48:35] AND YOU HAVE TO LET HIM IN. AND SO HE
[1:48:38] SAID, "TODAY, IF YOU HEAR MY VOICE,
[1:48:40] HARDEN NOT YOUR HEART." BUT YOU JUST
[1:48:42] OPEN THE DOOR A LITTLE BIT. HALLEL AND
[1:48:45] WHEN CHRIST COMES IN THE HOUSE, YOU KNOW
[1:48:47] WHAT HE DOES, BROTHER JOHN? He expresses
[1:48:49] himself.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And so when he
[1:48:54] comes and he knocks and he enters, you
[1:48:57] know, brother Ben said, and Paul in
[1:48:59] Romans 8, Paul said, For we know that
[1:49:03] the whole creation is groaning and
[1:49:05] travailing in pain together until now
[1:49:08] that not only they but ourself also
[1:49:11] which have received the first fruit of
[1:49:13] the spirit that's Christ that even we
[1:49:17] are ourselves are groaning within oursel
[1:49:20] waiting for the adoption to with the
[1:49:22] redemption of our bodies but said he
[1:49:25] said oh my oh my don't that make you old
[1:49:29] folks feel good. It ought to make us all
[1:49:32] feel good waiting for the hour. We
[1:49:36] understand that this will take place at
[1:49:39] the final resurrection. They say, "See,
[1:49:42] nature is groaning. We are groaning.
[1:49:45] Everything is groaning because we
[1:49:47] realize there's something not right. And
[1:49:50] the only way you can groan and wait for
[1:49:54] it is because there has been a new life
[1:49:57] come in here that speaks of a new world.
[1:50:00] Hallelujah. He said now these things
[1:50:04] that the groaning in our bodies he said
[1:50:06] did you notice the tree have it struggle
[1:50:09] for life. It was it want to live and you
[1:50:13] notice an animal in death how it
[1:50:16] struggles. And notice a human being
[1:50:19] everything nature is groaning. We in
[1:50:22] ourself are groaning. See we know
[1:50:25] there's something wrong. So see from
[1:50:28] these verses that something has been
[1:50:30] lost both to man and hurt. It says
[1:50:34] creation of all type has lost something.
[1:50:37] Hallelujah. He said for we see from this
[1:50:40] inspired word that there it is groaning
[1:50:43] for some reason. And when nature and
[1:50:46] people as the Bible said are groaning,
[1:50:49] it show is something that there's not in
[1:50:53] they're not in the ought to be
[1:50:54] condition. They have fallen from
[1:50:56] somewhere. So now we don't need anybody
[1:50:59] to interpret that for us. See, of
[1:51:03] course, we know it WAS ETERNAL LIFE
[1:51:06] THEY'RE falling from and they lost their
[1:51:08] claims on eternal life. But the fall of
[1:51:11] Adam and he who fell from eternal life
[1:51:15] to death in the Garden of Eden brought
[1:51:18] all nature under them to death.
[1:51:21] Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. But
[1:51:24] let let me say this to you church. Oh
[1:51:26] my. I'm coming down. Hallelujah. But let
[1:51:29] me say this to you now church. HALLELU.
[1:51:31] BUT GOD DID NOT just leave us empty.
[1:51:34] Yes, we experiencing TROUBLES AND AND
[1:51:36] TROUBLE. GOD DID NOT LEAVE US EMPTY,
[1:51:38] CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. He did not just
[1:51:40] LEAVE US TO WALK BY OURSEL BECAUSE HE
[1:51:43] PROMISED IT. HE SAID, "I WILL NOT LEAVE
[1:51:45] YOU NOR FORSAKE YOU. BUT I'M GOING TO BE
[1:51:48] WITH YOU EVEN TO THE ENDING OF THIS
[1:51:51] WORLD." ARE YOU THERE WITH ME, CHURCH?
[1:51:53] HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE NOW, HALLELUJAH,
[1:51:56] KNOW THAT ETERNITY IS CALLING.
[1:51:58] HALLELUJAH. WE GOT TO MOVE OUT OF JUST A
[1:52:02] MODE, THIS THIS EARTHLY MORTAL MODE.
[1:52:05] HALLELUJAH. WE GOT TO NOW CHANGE OUR
[1:52:07] APPROACH. WHY? BECAUSE ETERNITY IS
[1:52:11] CALLING AND THE GROANING IN OUR HEART IS
[1:52:14] GETTING LOUDER AND STRONGER. ARE YOU
[1:52:16] THERE CHURCH? IT'S GROANING FOR LIFE.
[1:52:20] HALLELUJAH. Eternal life uh eternal
[1:52:23] experiences.
[1:52:25] Oh my. Oh my. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So
[1:52:31] every now and then we have flashes of
[1:52:34] experiences. Hallelujah. AND I SAID,
[1:52:36] LORD, CAPABLE OF THE REVELATION OF
[1:52:39] YOURSELF, LORD GOD, WHATEVER CONDITION
[1:52:42] TONIGHT, LORD GOD, LET ME NOT JUST
[1:52:44] EXPERIENCE IT FROM A MORTAL STANDPOINT,
[1:52:47] BUT LORD GOD, LET ME STEP INTO THE
[1:52:49] ETERNAL STANDPOINT OF YOUR ETERNAL LIFE
[1:52:53] OF YOUR ETERNAL WORD. LORD, LET YOUR
[1:52:55] WORD LIVE IN ME. LET IT BE A LIVING
[1:52:58] EXPRESSION, A LIVING MANIFESTATION. LORD
[1:53:01] GOD, I WANT TO BE A VESSEL FOR YOU, A
[1:53:03] HOUSE FOR YOUR EXPRESSION. LORD, USE ME.
[1:53:06] HALLELUJAH. MANIFEST YOURSELF THROUGH
[1:53:09] ME, LORD. Use me, Lord. Use me, Lord.
[1:53:13] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:53:17] Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen.
[1:53:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I think we just
[1:53:25] gone, you know. I think we there's a
[1:53:28] little bit more and we're finished.
[1:53:30] Hallelujah.
[1:53:32] Hallelujah. You see the Bible said,
[1:53:35] hallelujah, under the bulls, the blood
[1:53:38] of bulls and goats, how God could not
[1:53:40] bring that life. He could not bring that
[1:53:43] eternal life. Hallelujah. Because it was
[1:53:46] under the shadow. And remember the
[1:53:48] shadow was type and shadow. IT WAS IT
[1:53:51] HAD DEATH IN IT, CHURCH. So it could not
[1:53:53] bring forth the life of God in its
[1:53:55] perfect order because it had shadow in
[1:53:57] it. to the blood of bulls and goats
[1:54:00] could not reach your heart. Are you
[1:54:03] there church? But one day, ONE DAY
[1:54:06] CHURCH, A PERFECT SACRIFICE CAME, a
[1:54:10] perfect blood that COULD CARRY THE LIFE
[1:54:13] OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. NOT IN YOUR BODY,
[1:54:16] NOT IN YOUR SPIRIT, BUT IN YOUR SOUL.
[1:54:19] HALLELUJAH. THE LIFE OF GOD. WHEN JESUS
[1:54:22] DIED AND THE B AND HE GAVE UP THE GHOST,
[1:54:25] WHERE DID IT GO TO? HALLELUJAH. THAT
[1:54:28] PART OF HIMSELF. UH HE WAS SEARCHING THE
[1:54:30] HURT LOOKING FOR THAT SEED. ARE YOU
[1:54:33] THERE WITH ME CHURCH? AND ONE DAY I
[1:54:36] HEARD A VOICE. HE CALLED MY NAME. I
[1:54:39] SAID, "SON, DAUGHTER, YOU BELONGS TO ME.
[1:54:42] YOU ARE MINE. ARE YOU THERE CHURCH?
[1:54:45] HALLELUJAH." IT'S LIKE AN eagle and he
[1:54:48] scream. HE SAID, "CHILD, COME OUT OF
[1:54:51] HER. COME OUT OF YOUR MORTAL SICKNESSES.
[1:54:54] Come out of your mortal sin AND COME
[1:54:56] BACK TO ME. ARE YOU THERE, CHURCH? THE
[1:54:59] VOICE OF GOD IS CALLING YOU TO DO WHAT?
[1:55:02] TO CHANGE YOUR EXPERIENCE.
[1:55:06] &gt;&gt; To change your experience. To bring
[1:55:08] something new to you. Hallelujah.
[1:55:12] Hallelujah. We just take one more verse.
[1:55:16] Second Timothy 1 verse 8. He said,
[1:55:21] "Be not thou therefore ashamed of the
[1:55:24] testimony
[1:55:26] of our Lord, nor for me is prisoner, but
[1:55:30] be thou partaker of the afflictions of
[1:55:33] the gospel according to the power of
[1:55:36] God, who will save us and call us with
[1:55:40] an holy calling." You hear what the
[1:55:43] Bible said. He save us and he call us
[1:55:47] with an holy calling.
[1:55:49] Not according not according to our works
[1:55:53] and that is so important because church
[1:55:56] from an eternal STANDPOINT IS NOT WHAT
[1:55:59] YOU CAN DO IS NOT HOW SPIRITUAL YOU can
[1:56:02] become is not how anointing YOU CAN
[1:56:04] BECOME. ARE YOU THERE CHURCH? NO WONDER
[1:56:07] THE BIBLE SAID IT'S NOT BY MIGHT NOR IS
[1:56:10] IT BY POWER BUT BY MY SPIRIT SAY THE
[1:56:14] LORD. BROTHER BOB, THERE GOT TO COME A
[1:56:16] TIME WHEN THE BROTHER BOB GOT TO COME
[1:56:18] OUT OF THE PICTURE. IT'S NO LONGER YOU.
[1:56:21] ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. HE
[1:56:23] JUST CALLED YOU WITH AN ONLY CALLING FOR
[1:56:26] WHAT REASON? HALLELUJAH. TO BRING YOUR
[1:56:28] LIFE INTO A TRUE EXPERIENCE OF THE
[1:56:31] WORLD. HALLELUJAH. NOT BY YOUR OWN
[1:56:33] WORKS. NOT IT'S NOT ANYTHING SPIRITUAL
[1:56:36] THAT YOU PERFORM. BUT THE BIBLE SAID,
[1:56:39] "BUT ACCORDING to his own purpose and
[1:56:42] grace, which he has given us in Christ
[1:56:46] before the foundation of the world, but
[1:56:48] is now made manifested by the appearing
[1:56:52] of our Lord, of our Savior Jesus Christ,
[1:56:55] WHO WAS ABOLISHED DEATH AND HAS BROUGHT
[1:56:58] LIFE AND IMMORTALITY TO LIFE THROUGH THE
[1:57:01] GOSPEL." OH CHURCH, THE GOSPEL THAT
[1:57:04] YOU'RE HEARING TONIGHT, CHURCH, IT HAS A
[1:57:07] IT HAS A SPECIAL RECIPE OF ETERNAL LIFE
[1:57:12] OF ETERNAL INGREDIENTS. ARE YOU THERE ME

[1:57:40] STOPPED. THERE'S NO DEVIL IN HELL THAT
[1:57:42] CAN STOP IT. ARE YOU ME, CHURCH? THEY
[1:57:45] WILL TRY TO STOP YOU, BUT THEY WON'T
[1:57:48] PREVAIL. SATAN CANNOT PREVAIL.
[1:57:51] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. SATAN WON'T
[1:57:53] PREVAIL. WHY? BECAUSE IT'S CHRIST IN
[1:57:55] YOU. ARE you there, CHURCH? THE HOPE OF
[1:57:58] GLORY. THE BIBLE SAID GREATER IS HE THAT
[1:58:01] [clears throat] IS in you THAN HE THAT
[1:58:03] IS IN THIS WORLD. ARE YOU THERE ME
[1:58:05] CHURCH? YOU CAN LOOK AT THE WORLD BUT
[1:58:07] CHURCH LET US TAKE UP THE VISION. LOOK
[1:58:10] ON THE ONE THAT is in you. Look at what
[1:58:13] he promised because everything that HE
[1:58:16] SAY IT GOT TO COME TO PASS.
[1:58:19] HALLELUJAH.
[1:58:21] So the revelation
[1:58:23] got to come through the blood. The blood
[1:58:25] of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:58:29] Hallelujah. And we saw a blood that
[1:58:32] could not produce, but he gave us a
[1:58:34] blood. Hallelujah. You will find later
[1:58:38] on as we go into this. You know, you'll
[1:58:40] find out that that the bride received
[1:58:43] the blood for a day, the message of the
[1:58:44] hour through which the life of God will
[1:58:47] come. Hallelujah. A perfect revelation.
[1:58:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:58:56] Amen.
[1:58:57] Hallelujah.
[1:58:59] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. And
[1:59:03] so Jesus said, Hallelujah. I got to
[1:59:06] quote this one before I leave. In St.
[1:59:08] John 14, Jesus said, "And I will pray
[1:59:12] the Father that he will give you another
[1:59:14] comforter that he may abide with you
[1:59:17] forever, even the Spirit of truth whom
[1:59:20] the world cannot receive." Because it
[1:59:22] sat him not, neither knoweth him. But
[1:59:25] you know him, church. Church, you know
[1:59:27] him. You know him, church. For he
[1:59:30] dwelleth with you and shall be in you,
[1:59:34] and I will not leave you comfortless. I
[1:59:36] will come to you. Hallelujah. Praise
[1:59:39] God. It's a YET A LITTLE WHILE AND the
[1:59:42] world see me no more, but you shall SEE
[1:59:44] ME. OH MY CHURCH. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING
[1:59:47] AT? HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE
[1:59:50] ENEMY IS DOING. HE'S TRYING TO PULL YOU
[1:59:52] BACK INTO THIS MORTAL LIFE AND YOU'RE
[1:59:54] TRYING TO FIND GOD THROUGH THE
[1:59:56] EXPERIENCE. BUT LET ME TELL YOU THIS
[1:59:58] CHURCH, I HAVE BEEN THERE. I KNOW WHAT
[2:00:00] THE DEVIL DOES. HE TRIED TO BUG YOU DOWN
[2:00:03] WITH LIFE CONDITION. HE TRIED TO BUG YOU
[2:00:06] DOWN WITH SICKNESS. BUT CHURCH,
[2:00:08] HALLELUJAH, EVERY TIME HE COMES,
[2:00:10] POINTING BACK TO THE SCRIPTURE, POINTING
[2:00:12] BACK TO WHAT GOD SAY ABOUT YOUR LIFE. IF
[2:00:14] YOU ARE SICK TONIGHT, THE BIBLE SAY HE
[2:00:17] WAS WOUNDED FOR YOUR TRANSGRESSION. HE
[2:00:20] WAS BRUISED FOR YOUR INIQUITY. THE
[2:00:22] CHASTISEMENT OF YOUR PEACE IS UPON HIM.
[2:00:25] AND BY HIS STRIPE IS YOU ALREADY HEALED.
[2:00:28] Are you there ME CHURCH? THAT'S GOD'S
[2:00:30] PROMISED word to you. And it got to come
[2:00:32] alive.
[2:00:34] It got to come alive. Hallelujah.
[2:00:37] Hallelujah. Praise God. The revelation
[2:00:40] of God comes through the blood.
[2:00:44] Hallelujah.
[2:00:45] Hallelujah. And so the Bible said in
[2:00:49] closing, I promise I close now. And so
[2:00:51] the Bible said, hallelujah. And so there
[2:00:54] got to come a time in our earthly
[2:00:57] journey, in our earthly experience. You
[2:01:00] see, because we are covered with
[2:01:01] mortality
[2:01:03] on our mortal experience. The Bible said
[2:01:05] there got to come a time, h when this
[2:01:08] mortal life got to be swallowed up,
[2:01:11] hallelujah, into immortality.
[2:01:14] In other words, Paul said, "Let me show
[2:01:16] you a mystery. We shall not all sleep.
[2:01:20] Yes, we all will be tried. SOME OF US,
[2:01:22] BROTHER MARK, WILL NOT MAKE IT OVER, BUT
[2:01:24] by reason of witnesses, and that's all
[2:01:26] fine if the believer go to sleep. But
[2:01:29] let me say THIS TO YOU, CHURCH. NOT ALL
[2:01:31] OF US TONIGHT. THEN YOU SEE SIT HERE."
[2:01:34] HALLELUJAH. NOT ALL OF US WILL FALL
[2:01:36] ASLEEP. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, BUT WE ALL
[2:01:39] SHALL BE CHANGED. FOR PAUL SAID,
[2:01:41] "BEHOLD, I SHOW YOU A MYSTERY."
[2:01:43] HALLELUJAH. FOR THIS MORTAL, THIS
[2:01:46] MORTAL, COME ON CHURCH. HERE IT IS. THIS
[2:01:49] MORTAL. HALLELUJAH. NOT JUST THE BODY,
[2:01:51] BUT THE ENTIRE MAN OF WHO YOU ARE MUST
[2:01:54] PUT ON IMMORTALITY. HALLELUJAH. ARE YOU
[2:01:57] ARE YOU ME CHURCH? IN OTHER WORDS, GOD
[2:02:00] THROUGH YOUR HURTLY EXPERIENCE IS
[2:02:02] IMMORTALIZING YOU. YOU HAVE BECOME
[2:02:05] IMMORTAL AND LITTLE BY LITTLE YOU'RE
[2:02:07] FEELING the effect OF IMMORTALITY RISING
[2:02:11] TO YOUR BODY, RAISING TO EXPERIENCE. IS
[2:02:14] GOD DOING THE WORK OF GRACE UPON YOUR
[2:02:17] LIFE?
[2:02:19] We are being immortalized
[2:02:22] by the gospel.
[2:02:26] We are being moved transferred
[2:02:28] out of mortal life into immortal life.
[2:02:34] And just as how
[2:02:36] you see this a battle, this is a battle.
[2:02:39] It is a battle. And you'll accept your
[2:02:41] five senses say it's a battle. And you
[2:02:44] know it's a battle.
[2:02:47] But just as you can affirm that the life
[2:02:51] of God will affirm the things of God
[2:02:53] that it's much real than anything that
[2:02:55] you have ever experienced.
[2:02:58] And we are drawn into something that is
[2:03:01] bigger and greater than ourselves about
[2:03:03] the kingdom. Hallelujah. Church of the
[2:03:06] living God. It is the story of your
[2:03:09] life.
[2:03:11] What the script is saying about you
[2:03:12] tonight that you're more than conqueror
[2:03:16] through him who have loved you. What the
[2:03:19] script is saying tonight that God have
[2:03:22] already wrote the script concerning your
[2:03:23] life. And God is saying you are my
[2:03:27] children. You're my child rather and you
[2:03:29] belong to me. Church of the living God.
[2:03:33] Hallelujah. The story of your life.
[2:03:37] Hallelujah. It didn't start. It start
[2:03:39] here but it didn't finish here.
[2:03:42] Hallelujah. One day, one day.
[2:03:46] Hallelujah. God is going to take us out
[2:03:48] of this mortal life. Hallelujah. By the
[2:03:52] mortal experiences. You don't you talk
[2:03:54] about divine healing. You haven't seen
[2:03:56] anything yet. Hallelujah. You you listen
[2:04:00] the experience is going to get so real,
[2:04:03] so real until one morning, brother John,
[2:04:04] between 6:00 to 9, it's going to be LIKE
[2:04:07] LIKE YOU JUST like like Enoch is just
[2:04:09] WALKING AND YOU STEP OFF THE HURT. IT
[2:04:12] GOING TO BECOME SO REAL. BUT CHURCH, I'm
[2:04:15] saying this to you. It is real. I HAVE
[2:04:18] EXPERIENCED IT. It is real. Oh my. Oh
[2:04:21] my. I know. I just give one more minute.
[2:04:23] Listen. HALLELUJAH. 2008 THE DOCTOR TOLD
[2:04:26] ME THAT I WILL NOT BE BE HERE. THEY TOLD
[2:04:30] me they go AS FAR AS TELLING ME how to
[2:04:32] tell my wife to TO TO MOVE ON WITH HER
[2:04:35] LIFE BECAUSE I WILL NOT BE HERE. And
[2:04:37] when he said that to me, I said you
[2:04:39] uncircumcised Philistine making a claim
[2:04:42] upon the son OF GOD. I SAID ALL THAT YOU
[2:04:45] SAID TO ME, I DENOUNCE IT AND HERE AM I
[2:04:47] 2025.
[2:04:49] OH CHURCH, IT'S THE REALITY OF GOD'S
[2:04:52] WORD IS MORE THAN ABLE TO DO WHAT HE
[2:04:55] SAID. For every word is yeah and amen.
[2:04:59] HALLELUJAH. GOD IS GREAT and greatly to
[2:05:03] be praised. God bless you tonight. Oh
[2:05:06] my. Hallelujah. Thank you.
[2:05:14] Thought I was going to have to pull the
[2:05:15] plug there. Oh, amen. I so enjoyed that.
[2:05:18] I wasn't going to take the pulpit. I was
[2:05:20] going to let brother Bob take it. But
[2:05:22] you know, he it struck me as he was
[2:05:23] talking there and he was talking about
[2:05:25] at the end he says they're going to pull
[2:05:27] out the books.
[2:05:29] But there's a book of works
[2:05:31] and everyone else is judged by the book
[2:05:34] of works. And then based on what they
[2:05:37] did, he takes their name and he either
[2:05:39] scratches it out of the book of life or
[2:05:42] he circles it.
[2:05:44] But there's a chapter within the book of
[2:05:46] life
[2:05:48] where there is a people who are not
[2:05:50] judged by their works. And the scripture
[2:05:52] says whose names were written in the
[2:05:54] book of life before the foundation of
[2:05:57] the world that cannot be taken away.
[2:06:02] Everyone else was living their life. But
[2:06:06] within that chapter of the Lamb's Book
[2:06:08] of Life, there's a people that were
[2:06:10] living the story he wrote about them
[2:06:13] before the world ever began. And how did
[2:06:17] you know it was you? Because he called
[2:06:20] your name. He came and talked to you.
[2:06:23] How did Abraham know he was a child of
[2:06:25] God? God came and talked to him. And God
[2:06:28] told him, he says, "I've chosen you.
[2:06:30] I've got a promise for you. I've got a
[2:06:31] land for you. I've got a place for you.
[2:06:33] I've got a purpose for you." And then he
[2:06:35] said, "Walk." And Abraham walked for 25
[2:06:38] years before he ever got a promised son.
[2:06:41] A 100 years old when he had Isaac.
[2:06:44] Completely impossible.
[2:06:47] Completely impossible. I love how he
[2:06:49] said it. He caught the mind of God. He
[2:06:51] wasn't believing in a son. He was
[2:06:53] believing in the word of God that had
[2:06:56] Isaac declared to be a part of his life
[2:07:00] before the foundation of the world.
[2:07:02] Amen. That's what it is when he comes to
[2:07:04] us is he's calling our name and he's
[2:07:07] saying, "I've already written the
[2:07:09] script."
[2:07:11] And you know what we say? We look at our
[2:07:12] mistakes.
[2:07:15] Look at Abraham. I've said this before.
[2:07:17] You look at Abraham's life full of
[2:07:18] mistakes. But he started to read it in
[2:07:21] Hebrews 11. Hebrews 11 is the faith
[2:07:23] chapter. Hebrews 11 is the book of life
[2:07:26] chapter. And when God reads Abraham's
[2:07:29] story into the Bible, he says, "By
[2:07:32] faith, by faith, by faith, by faith, no
[2:07:35] mistakes, no doubts, no wandering, no
[2:07:39] lies, no half- lives, no ups, no downs."
[2:07:42] He says, "By faith." Why? Through the
[2:07:45] blood. The word only is all he can see
[2:07:48] expressed in his life. Amen. Isn't that
[2:07:50] a wonderful thing?
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; Don't just talk about Abraham now. It's
[2:07:53] for the bride. It's for the true
[2:07:55] believer. When he looks at us, he sees
[2:07:58] the word that he's declared about us
[2:08:00] before time began. And that's all he's
[2:08:02] looking for. The rest of it is under the
[2:08:04] blood. All he can see is that perfect
[2:08:06] faith that's coming forth. Amen. Let's
[2:08:08] stand together if we would. We're going
[2:08:09] to sing that song. He knows my name.
[2:08:12] Amen.
[2:08:28] And I have a maker.
[2:08:35] [music] He for my heart.
[2:08:43] And before even time began,
[2:08:49] my [singing] life was in his hands.
[2:08:54] [music]
[2:08:57] And he knows my name. [music]
[2:09:05] He knows my every [singing and music]
[2:09:09] thought.
[2:09:12] He sees each [music and singing] tear
[2:09:15] that falls
[2:09:17] and he hears me when I call. [music]
[2:09:26] Oh, I have a father. [music]
[2:09:33] He calls me his [music] own.
[2:09:40] And he'll [singing] never
[2:09:43] leave [music]
[2:09:44] me,
[2:09:46] no matter
[2:09:48] where I [music] go.
[2:09:54] And he [music] knows my [singing] name.
[2:10:01] [music] He knows my [singing] every
[2:10:05] thought.
[2:10:09] He sees [music]
[2:10:10] each tear that falls.
[2:10:14] And [music] he hears me when I [singing]
[2:10:18] call.
[2:10:23] And I [music] have a [singing]
[2:10:25] maker
[2:10:28] [music]
[2:10:30] before
[2:10:32] my [singing] heart. [music]
[2:10:37] And before even time [music]
[2:10:41] began,
[2:10:43] my life was in his hands. [music]
[2:10:51] And he knows my name.
[2:10:58] He [music] knows my [singing] every
[2:11:02] thought.
[2:11:05] And he sees [music]
[2:11:07] each tear that falls.
[2:11:11] And he hears me when [music]
[2:11:14] I [singing] call.
[2:11:19] [music] And I have a father
[2:11:26] [music] and he calls me his own.
[2:11:33] And [music] he'll never [singing]
[2:11:36] leave me,
[2:11:39] no matter [music]
[2:11:41] where I go.
[2:11:47] And he knows [music]
[2:11:49] my name.
[2:11:55] He knows [music]
[2:11:56] my [singing]
[2:11:57] every thought.
[2:12:02] He [music] sees
[2:12:04] each tear that falls.
[2:12:07] And he hears [music] me when I call.
[2:12:13] Draw me. Draw me Lord. 11:48.
[2:12:19] Sorry, that's not it.
[2:12:22] The other draw me.
[2:12:29] You alone
[2:12:31] are all I need. [music]
[2:12:38] For you hold my destiny.
[2:12:46] You alone are all I need. [music]
[2:12:53] In you alone
[2:12:56] who I am
[2:12:59] complete. [music]
[2:13:04] to draw me. [music]
[2:13:08] Draw me Lord
[2:13:12] and [music] I'll come running after you.
[2:13:17] [music]
[2:13:20] Draw me.
[2:13:24] Draw me, Lord,
[2:13:27] [music]
[2:13:28] and I'll come running after you.
[2:13:34] For you alone are all I need. [music]
[2:13:43] For you hold my destiny.
[2:13:48] [music]
[2:13:51] You alone [singing]
[2:13:52] are all I need.
[2:13:57] [music]
[2:13:58] In you alone [singing]
[2:14:01] I am
[2:14:03] complete. [music]
[2:14:08] So draw [singing and music] me,
[2:14:12] draw me, Lord,
[2:14:15] [music] and I'll come running after you.
[2:14:24] So draw [music and singing] me,
[2:14:28] draw me, Lord, [music]
[2:14:32] and I'll [singing] come running after
[2:14:35] you. [music] Draw me, draw me.
[2:14:40] So draw me, [music]
[2:14:44] draw me, Lord,
[2:14:48] and I'll come running after [music] you.
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:14:55] &gt;&gt; So draw me,
[2:15:00] draw me, Lord,
[2:15:04] and I'll [music] come running after you.
[2:15:09] Amen. Let's bow our heads. Heavenly
[2:15:10] Father,
[2:15:12] Lord, I feel like we've looked into
[2:15:14] eternity tonight,
[2:15:16] Lord. And it's a wonderful thing to look
[2:15:18] there and see ourselves.
[2:15:21] Not because of what we've done,
[2:15:24] what we are, what we've chosen, Lord,
[2:15:27] but because in the before time even
[2:15:29] began, Lord, you said, "I'm going to
[2:15:31] have a family. I am a family, Lord. And
[2:15:35] you said, I'm going to let that life go
[2:15:37] out and it's going to produce me over
[2:15:39] and over and over again, Lord." And
[2:15:41] that's this Christian walk that we have,
[2:15:43] Lord. Lord, it's not just people, but
[2:15:45] it's life. It's your life coming
[2:15:47] through, Lord. And yes, we drop away and
[2:15:50] this one passes and that one, Lord, but
[2:15:53] that life just keeps coming back and
[2:15:54] back, Lord, expressing itself over and
[2:15:57] over again, Lord. And that's our prayer,
[2:15:59] our heart's desire, Lord, as we leave
[2:16:01] this building tonight and go back, Lord,
[2:16:03] into, Lord, our day-to-day lives, Lord.
[2:16:06] May it not be day-to-day life, Lord. May
[2:16:08] it be your eternal life being expressed
[2:16:10] through us, Lord. The things we say, the
[2:16:11] things we don't, the things we do, the
[2:16:13] things we don't, Lord. The things we
[2:16:16] wear, the things we listen to, Lord, the
[2:16:17] things we read, the things we watch.
[2:16:19] Lord, our conversations, Lord, our very
[2:16:21] thoughts, Lord, may they circle around
[2:16:23] the eternal word, Lord, that brings us
[2:16:26] back to you tonight. Lord, I pray for
[2:16:28] all these needs we've had. Lord, there's
[2:16:29] many sick. Lord, there's many away from
[2:16:32] us tonight. Lord, we pray your mercy and
[2:16:34] grace to them. Each one, Lord, we pray
[2:16:36] especially, Lord, for Mary Rouso, Lord,
[2:16:38] on death's bed. Lord, she's seeking your
[2:16:40] peace. Lord, I pray you go to her
[2:16:42] tonight, Lord. Pray in your grace for
[2:16:44] each one, Lord. Bless our brother
[2:16:46] Garfield, Lord, as he goes home tonight.
[2:16:48] Lord, may you just restore strength to
[2:16:50] him, Lord. Fill him with your spirit,
[2:16:52] Lord. Give him another message for us.
[2:16:53] We pray, heavenly father. Lord, just go
[2:16:56] with us now, we ask. We commit all these
[2:16:57] things into your hands. In Jesus
[2:16:59] Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. God
[2:17:02] bless you.
[2:17:54] &gt;&gt; [music]
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; You are [music] here.
[2:18:06] You are [music]
