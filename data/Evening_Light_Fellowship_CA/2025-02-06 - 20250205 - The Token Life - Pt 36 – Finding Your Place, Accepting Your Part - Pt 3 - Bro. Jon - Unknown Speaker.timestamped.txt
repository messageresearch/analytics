[37:59] remember Selena as well she's home
[38:01] tonight she's better but she's not great
[38:03] she's still a little weak she wasn't at
[38:05] work on Monday she went and did a
[38:07] partial day on Tuesday and today was her
[38:09] full full first full day but she's still
[38:11] under the weather so we pray God's grace
[38:13] to her also just to let the church know
[38:16] my family and I will be away February
[38:18] 18th through the 21st so that's a
[38:20] Tuesday through a Friday we're going to
[38:22] go to the West Coast again and do a
[38:24] little family vacation there we
[38:25] hopefully see some of the Saints along
[38:26] the way so there'll be one service where
[38:29] I'm not here so I'll uh make
[38:31] arrangements for for whoever will take
[38:33] that it might be brother Grant or it
[38:34] might be haven't talked to brother Mark
[38:36] about it might be him or we'll see how
[38:38] that goes but we'll make sure there's uh
[38:40] someone to take the service for that
[38:42] amen James chapter 1 and verse 17 very
[38:44] familiar scripture it says
[38:47] every every good gift and every perfect
[38:52] gift is from above and cometh down from
[38:55] the Father of Lights with whom is no
[38:56] variableness
[38:58] neither shadow of turning and of his own
[39:01] will begat he us with the word of truth
[39:04] that we should be a kind of first fruits
[39:06] of his creatures amen God bless you you
[39:09] can have your seats tonight we're
[39:11] preaching as you imagine on the Holy
[39:12] Ghost and we're going to take a third
[39:14] service on this this thought of finding
[39:16] your place and accepting your part and I
[39:18] feel like we've covered a lot of ground
[39:20] in the last two services and I know it's
[39:22] been very pastoral at times and it'll be
[39:24] pastoral again tonight but I believe
[39:26] this is pastoral preaching where we take
[39:28] the word of God and yes we preach it in
[39:30] the theory and the Theology and these
[39:32] things but we've got to remember the
[39:33] purpose of the word is to come and live
[39:35] in US amen it's supposed to produce
[39:37] itself inside of us and one of the
[39:39] greatest elements that you'll find in
[39:41] having a Christian walk that's
[39:42] satisfying is that you find your place
[39:45] that you find out what God wants you to
[39:46] do and then you stay there and I don't
[39:48] care what part of a body you are tonight
[39:50] if you're not there the body's not going
[39:52] to operate the way it's supposed to if
[39:53] you take one little thing in your body
[39:55] tonight and you make it go wrong you
[39:57] take it away then it's not going to work
[40:00] right and you're going to feel a little
[40:01] weird and you're going to feel a little
[40:03] funny and you may have some pains in
[40:04] these things I remember there was a
[40:06] brother in in Edmonton that told me you
[40:09] know he was doing a certain exercise I
[40:10] said what are you what are you doing
[40:12] that for and he told me and it was that
[40:13] he had a particular set of muscles that
[40:15] weren't active in his body they were
[40:18] there but he couldn't seem to the the
[40:19] term there is fire them he couldn't get
[40:21] the muscles to Fire and so he went to
[40:23] the doctor with these aches and his
[40:25] pains and the doctor said well you've
[40:27] got a problem your muscles aren't firing
[40:29] they're there but you don't know how to
[40:30] work them and so he had to do some
[40:32] rather hilarious exercises that I won't
[40:33] describe in a church environment tonight
[40:35] to get those muscles fired up so that
[40:37] his body could operate properly and then
[40:39] once that happened then all of the aches
[40:41] and the pains went away but he had to do
[40:43] some pretty funny things in order to get
[40:44] it going and it's very much the same way
[40:46] in our body sometimes we don't realize
[40:48] why things aren't quite going the way
[40:50] that they ought to be going in the local
[40:51] body and it's because somebody may not
[40:54] be in their position or if they're there
[40:56] they're not working they're not they're
[40:57] not doing their portion I'm not doing
[40:58] that to put people down tonight I'm
[41:00] saying sometimes we're not exactly
[41:01] firing the way we ought to be firing but
[41:04] then we talked about gifts and we talked
[41:05] about people and we talked about
[41:07] administrations and offices and helps
[41:09] and all these different things and then
[41:11] we talked about creation gifts and
[41:13] that's really what I want to talk to you
[41:14] about tonight because we're preaching on
[41:16] the Holy Spirit and we want to see what
[41:18] happens when he comes into your life
[41:20] because he doesn't just come in and seal
[41:22] you and then that's it that's not the
[41:24] way it works brother Braham says when
[41:25] you get the Holy Spirit that's when the
[41:26] fighting starts
[41:27] that's when the real battle starts and
[41:29] let me tell you this the first thing he
[41:31] has to conquer is this amen he's got to
[41:33] conquer me before he can conquer
[41:35] anything else and so when we talk about
[41:37] the creation gifts the idea is that he's
[41:39] going to come in and start to use those
[41:42] you know we talk about people that are
[41:43] gifted and if you to look around this
[41:45] congregation tonight I'm sure we could
[41:47] see some of these things we we we we we
[41:50] talk about so many gifts and we talk
[41:51] about spiritual gifts and maybe it be a
[41:55] minister or maybe it be a deacon or or
[41:57] something like that but we also when we
[41:58] talk of gifted people we think of social
[42:01] gifts people that can get along with
[42:03] everybody and and they're outgoing and
[42:05] they're charismatic or they're great
[42:07] speakers or they're great teachers and
[42:08] they can explain things we can think of
[42:11] people that have Financial gifts there
[42:13] are people that seem to be able to make
[42:14] money no matter where they go and no
[42:16] matter what they do just seems to have
[42:17] money coming out of their life
[42:19] everywhere that they go you have people
[42:20] that are very smart very intelligent
[42:22] they can understand complex things and
[42:24] break them down so that other people can
[42:26] understand them we have people that have
[42:28] mechanical gifts people that can work
[42:29] with their hands people that can fix
[42:31] things and install things and and manage
[42:34] these sorts of things and then we have
[42:36] people that are influential people that
[42:38] have leadership skills to be able to
[42:40] help people come in together and be in
[42:42] unity to get something done then we've
[42:44] got people that are good-looking we got
[42:47] people that have great physiques or we
[42:49] have people that are very athletic and
[42:50] every single thing I've talked about
[42:52] here is a gift from God we may not think
[42:54] it that way but I'm going to show you by
[42:56] the scriptures how those things are so
[42:58] many times what happens is is that we
[43:00] take something that God that is in our
[43:02] body and because it's natural we think
[43:04] that that's all it is but it's a gift
[43:07] from God as we read in our opening
[43:08] scripture James said every good
[43:11] gift every good gift and every perfect
[43:15] every mature gift is from God and he
[43:18] gives it to us for purpose everything
[43:20] that we have that can make our life
[43:22] better that can give us opportunity that
[43:24] can give us advantage over the person
[43:25] next to us is a gift from God and God
[43:28] has given it to you God has placed it in
[43:31] your life God has made you that way for
[43:33] a purpose if you're a child of God Amen
[43:36] he does these things and like I said
[43:38] last time we looked at brother Matt's
[43:39] three daughters in the front row and we
[43:41] looked at those three girls coming from
[43:43] the same Source the same parents the
[43:46] same genetics and yet they come out so
[43:48] different why is that because God has
[43:50] given them advantages for his purpose
[43:54] he's made them a particular way amen but
[43:57] you take those young women and you
[43:58] compare them to the rest of the young
[44:00] people in this church and guess what not
[44:02] a single one of them is the same we can
[44:04] look at brother Joe's kids or my kids or
[44:06] brother Chad's kids or whoever might be
[44:08] here and we look at them and we see some
[44:10] of them can play instruments and
[44:12] sing some of them can only sing some of
[44:14] them can only play some of them are very
[44:16] athletic some of them are very
[44:17] charismatic some of them are
[44:19] entrepreneurial some are very artistic
[44:21] some are very uh intellectual some make
[44:24] friends really easily some are loners
[44:27] not a single one of them is the same
[44:29] amen but what am I getting at every
[44:31] single one of them has been
[44:33] designed designed now we want to catch
[44:35] that they are designed with purpose by
[44:38] God for a place in the body of Christ
[44:41] just like their parents are each and
[44:42] every one but I want to take us into the
[44:44] scripture for this because we can get so
[44:46] focused on
[44:48] spirituality and and looking at the big
[44:50] thing and the big pictures that we
[44:52] forget that the purpose of God and his
[44:54] word is to come down and use what he has
[44:56] given given us in these lives and in
[44:58] these bodies that we have amen it's
[45:00] supposed to be present in our day-to-day
[45:02] lives the word is supposed to be alive
[45:04] in you and I this this evening amen it's
[45:06] great that we read the word it's great
[45:08] that we pray it's great that we spend
[45:10] time in church but the purpose of the
[45:11] holy spirit is to take what God has
[45:14] written about and what God has said and
[45:16] plop it right into your life so that you
[45:18] can live and breathe that word that's
[45:19] where we're supposed to be this morning
[45:21] it's the living breathing word of God
[45:23] and if my spirituality is so high that I
[45:25] can't interact with other
[45:28] people and I can't interact with someone
[45:30] in the world that I can't get outside of
[45:31] my Christian bubble then guess what I'm
[45:34] of no use to the kingdom of God Jesus
[45:37] said we are a city on a hill that cannot
[45:40] be hid that means people outside the
[45:43] city have to be able to see the city
[45:45] that we have to be a witness we have to
[45:47] be a testimony amen some of us have more
[45:50] of an outside experience some of us have
[45:51] less of a role in those things but we're
[45:53] certainly not meant to sit in our
[45:55] Christian castles and just be spiritual
[45:57] we don't just get the Holy Ghost and say
[45:59] that's it I'm saved I'm just going to
[46:00] sit in my house I've said it before the
[46:02] holy spirit is not given to us so we can
[46:04] sit on the couch and be smugged that
[46:05] we're going into a Rapture and a
[46:08] resurrection if we're a mechanic we need
[46:11] to be a Godly mechanic if we're a
[46:13] business owner brother Joe brother Chad
[46:15] they need to be a business a Godly
[46:17] business owner so that other people can
[46:19] see the difference between a mechanic
[46:21] and a Godly mechanic see the difference
[46:22] between a child of this world and a
[46:24] child of God that's what you're there
[46:26] therefore for amen if you're a mother
[46:28] this evening then they you are there to
[46:31] show people what it's like to be a holy
[46:33] ghost filled mother not just a mother
[46:36] amen and wherever you go whether it's a
[46:38] with The Homeschool Group whether it's
[46:39] getting your groceries so somebody can
[46:41] think you are an
[46:43] angel whatever it is you have an
[46:45] opportunity listen my wife has had
[46:47] opportunities to witness in Costco she's
[46:49] had a witness a witness opportunity on
[46:52] the playground at The Homeschool Group
[46:54] wherever we go we are supposed to be a
[46:56] light we are supposed to be a
[46:58] representation of the Living Word of
[46:59] this day amen that's what he's supposed
[47:02] to do but watch this whether you're a
[47:06] man a woman a wife a father single
[47:08] married this evening it doesn't matter
[47:11] every single one of us is being placed
[47:13] into God's hand for him to use brother
[47:15] Ram says it this way he says nobody can
[47:18] take your place but they says these
[47:21] words no matter how little church who
[47:23] makes things
[47:25] little God doesn't make them little we
[47:27] make them little We rise up things and
[47:30] we lower things we make one thing better
[47:32] than another we make one thing spiritual
[47:34] one thing not listen if you're in God's
[47:36] hands the Supernatural is there the
[47:39] power of God is there to do it he says
[47:41] you say I'm just a
[47:43] housewife and he comes right back around
[47:45] and he says nobody can take your place
[47:48] God in his great economy has so set so
[47:52] the body of Christ excuse me in order
[47:55] till there is no one can take your place
[47:58] see we all have a place some of us are
[48:02] evangelists some of us prophets teachers
[48:04] pastors whatever we are and you say well
[48:06] where am I then he says some Housewives
[48:09] some mechanics some Farmers but whatever
[48:13] it is God has set you in your place see
[48:17] the thing is we have natural gifts and
[48:19] because we think we've had them before
[48:21] we got saved before we got the Holy
[48:23] Ghost because they've been there all of
[48:25] our life or they've been developed in
[48:26] our life we think they are not of God
[48:29] they are of God what they aren't is
[48:33] Godly see the difference see you can
[48:35] have them and they are of God but they
[48:37] aren't Godly until you surrender them
[48:39] for God to use but they are absolutely
[48:41] of God from start to finish they are
[48:44] from God but until they're surrendered
[48:46] they're not going to reflect what he
[48:47] means to reflect there doesn't mean you
[48:49] can't use them for yourself as you've
[48:51] said as we've said before you can use
[48:53] them to make a living you can use them
[48:55] to make friends you can use them to gain
[48:57] influence but in the end God has given
[48:59] his children those gifts in their bodies
[49:02] and in their intellect and their
[49:03] personality and these things whatever it
[49:05] might be for his purpose for the kingdom
[49:07] of God every single one of us but I want
[49:11] you to see tonight and this is really
[49:12] where we're focusing I want you to see
[49:15] that your your natural gifts have the
[49:18] same potential as the spiritual ones in
[49:20] the
[49:21] church now that sounds counterintuitive
[49:24] because everything we relate to the
[49:26] super Supernatural is always spiritual
[49:28] but you'll see as we go through here
[49:31] tonight by the scriptures that we yes we
[49:33] have spiritual gifts we have spiritual
[49:35] offices but we also have practical gifts
[49:38] and practical offices and in the body of
[49:41] Christ none is greater than the other
[49:43] they are all placed by God they're a
[49:45] part of the body they're necessary
[49:47] there's no great ones Among Us except
[49:49] him that's it so it's us that make
[49:52] things little and it's us that make
[49:54] things big but God says you're all one
[49:55] in my eyes
[49:57] you're all the
[49:58] same catch this thought now we're going
[50:00] to take it into the scriptures we're
[50:01] talking about the the supernatural
[50:04] ability inside of a natural gift it says
[50:07] and the Lord spake unto Moses saying see
[50:10] I have called by
[50:13] name we're going to talk about this man
[50:15] bezel he says I have called him by name
[50:18] this is not somebody that just happened
[50:20] to be here I have set him I know who he
[50:24] is but watch how he knows who he is he
[50:27] says I have called by name bezel the son
[50:29] of Yuri the son of her of the tribe of
[50:31] Judah and I have filled him with the
[50:35] spirit of God this is in the wilderness
[50:38] this is when they're they're walking
[50:40] away from Egypt and he says I have
[50:42] filled them with the spirit of God in
[50:44] wisdom and in understanding and in
[50:47] knowledge and in all manner of
[50:49] workmanship now stop here because we we
[50:51] tend to focus on things that are very
[50:53] high and very spiritual and we look at
[50:55] wisdom we look at understanding and
[50:57] knowledge and we'd say praise the Lord
[50:59] there's those are great Supernatural
[51:01] gifts that is something that we can
[51:03] really say that is of god but look at
[51:06] what that finishes with it says now that
[51:09] he has what all manner of
[51:15] workmanship what does that mean that
[51:17] word means craftsmanship in other words
[51:20] bezel is a blue collar worker that's
[51:23] good with his
[51:25] hands and what he can do is he can take
[51:28] Precious things well let's look what it
[51:30] says he says I filled him with the
[51:32] spirit of God now this is not the
[51:34] filling that we have
[51:36] today okay this is not the baptism of
[51:39] the holy spirit this is not the sealing
[51:40] of his soul this is an anointing on him
[51:43] it's like a blanket it's like a covering
[51:46] it's something that can come and go but
[51:47] God says I have wrapped bezel in my own
[51:51] spirit for a particular
[51:53] purpose why has God put his Spirit on
[51:57] bezo why is this man in existence what
[51:59] is his purpose what is the manifestation
[52:02] of the holy spirit in this
[52:06] man great signs and wonders a Healing
[52:09] Ministry a great warrior great
[52:13] victories verse four says to devise
[52:16] cunning Works to work in gold and in
[52:19] silver and in brass it says to Divi to
[52:22] divide Divine devise artistic works
[52:27] with his hands it says and in cutting of
[52:30] stones and to set them and in carving of
[52:32] Timber to work in all manner of
[52:35] worksmanship this guy is the world's
[52:37] greatest Craftsman if he was here today
[52:39] he'd be the guy making the pect Philip
[52:42] watches these great watches a million
[52:44] million and a half dollars with 73
[52:47] movements that can track the movements
[52:48] of the Sun and all the planets inside of
[52:50] a mechanical watch this guy knows how to
[52:53] take materials precious stones and turn
[52:56] them into beautiful things why cuz the
[52:59] spirit of the Lord is upon
[53:04] them see how we can miss out because
[53:07] we're looking for something up here and
[53:10] God's saying if you'll just let me work
[53:11] with you right here I'll do a wonderful
[53:13] thing in your
[53:17] life he says and
[53:19] behold I have given him a holab the son
[53:22] of a hisat of the tribe of Dan so God
[53:25] has appointed God has arranged God has
[53:27] ordained now a holab to be his helper to
[53:30] be his second in command to be a support
[53:32] bezel is the primary a holab the backup
[53:35] and then he says and in the hearts of
[53:37] all that are wise-hearted that word
[53:39] wise-hearted means all that are skilled
[53:41] I have put wisdom where did that skill
[53:44] come
[53:44] from oh my dad was a my dad was a
[53:47] carpenter so I'm a carpenter no he says
[53:51] I have put that wisdom in them I have
[53:53] put the skill in them to do what they do
[53:56] what's their purpose church end of verse
[53:59] 6 says that they may make all that I
[54:02] have commanded Thee the Tabernacle of
[54:04] the congregation and the Ark of the
[54:05] testimony and of The Mercy Seat that is
[54:08] thereup and all the furniture of the
[54:10] Tabernacle and the table and his
[54:13] furniture and the pure Candlestick with
[54:15] all his furniture and the altar of
[54:17] incense and the altar of burnt offering
[54:19] with all his furniture and the labor and
[54:21] his foot and the cloths of service and
[54:23] the holy garments for Aaron the priest
[54:25] and the garments of his Sons to minister
[54:27] in the priest's office and the anointing
[54:29] oil and sweet incense for the holy Place
[54:32] according to all that I have commanded
[54:33] thee shall they do so God laid out this
[54:36] plan for a tabernacle and guess what
[54:39] they've never built one he's laid out
[54:41] this beautiful plan with all of these
[54:43] beautiful instruments and beautiful
[54:46] pieces made of gold and silver and and
[54:49] with precious stones and all these
[54:51] things fine artwork and Moses sitting
[54:53] there saying God it's a great plan how
[54:55] am I going to do it
[54:58] and God says I've already
[54:59] prepared I've given you gifts in the
[55:02] body to do this work and everything
[55:05] they've learned to this point is not to
[55:08] make money it's to make the Tabernacle
[55:11] it's to make the manifestation of what I
[55:13] have in my mind it's to take what's on
[55:16] paper and bring it into reality amen
[55:20] what makes those gifts suited for God
[55:22] Church the spirit of the Lord is upon
[55:25] them
[55:27] it gives them the attitude it gives them
[55:29] the approach it gives them the
[55:31] willingness it gives them the dedication
[55:33] the commitment and it gives them the
[55:36] skill as well it's a working of the
[55:38] spirit from start to finish you know
[55:40] I've been listening to that message of
[55:41] spoken World The Original Seed all at 6
[55:43] hours and 17 minutes of it and I just
[55:45] started the second half of it and
[55:47] brother Bram said something that
[55:48] answered a question I've talked about
[55:50] over this Pulpit many times just in the
[55:52] past few weeks I know and I thought it
[55:54] applied to what we're talking about
[55:55] today he says this he says but when you
[55:58] really empty out and say Lord Jesus no
[56:02] more of me but you from this time on he
[56:06] says see then it's going to bring forth
[56:09] a h hundredfold I was saying what's the
[56:11] difference between 30-fold 60-fold and
[56:14] 100-fold church I have my answer this
[56:16] evening ask and you shall receive amen
[56:19] what's the difference the more that I
[56:21] Surrender the more that comes out of him
[56:23] the more that I let go the more that
[56:25] comes out of him the more I lay myself
[56:28] down the more of him that comes out it's
[56:30] surrender surrender surrender the more
[56:33] that we surrender the more fruit that's
[56:35] going to come out of our Lives amen bezo
[56:37] was a great Craftsman but his greatest
[56:40] achievement was when he fulfilled the
[56:42] word of the Lord using his
[56:45] gift listen bezo when he came to the end
[56:48] of his life and they said to him bezel
[56:51] what is it that makes you a great
[56:53] believer how many people have you
[56:55] converted converted how many people have
[56:58] you laid hands on and healed how many
[57:00] miracles have you performed how many
[57:01] sermons have you preached none none none
[57:05] beia what did you do I built the
[57:08] Tabernacle with my gift that was all he
[57:11] had to do his purpose his reason to
[57:14] exist was to build everything that was
[57:17] in that Tabernacle he was the head
[57:19] Craftsman for the entire Tabernacle
[57:24] amen his idea his gift was to take the
[57:28] the the thought of God and turn it into
[57:31] perfect
[57:33] Reality by a natural gift we'd say a
[57:36] bluecollar
[57:38] worker it's so simple church so this is
[57:42] not rocket science you take what you
[57:45] have and you say Lord no more me but you
[57:50] listen we still got to make a living we
[57:52] still got to put a roof over our heads
[57:53] these different things we know these
[57:54] things but I'm trying to get you to see
[57:56] the supernatural potential of the gifts
[57:59] that God has given you see we bring the
[58:03] potential but he's got to bring the
[58:05] Supernatural Part see the potential is
[58:08] there but the potential is not in what I
[58:11] have without his Supernatural ability to
[58:12] make it into something I can do great
[58:14] things with the gifts God has given me
[58:16] but I can do greater things Greater
[58:19] Works if I'll let him use it
[58:22] amen bezel could have lived a Wonderful
[58:24] Life and maybe he did I don't know
[58:27] creating beautiful things beautiful
[58:28] jewelry beautiful uh furniture and these
[58:31] things but God anointed him with his
[58:33] spirit and that was what made the
[58:34] difference and that's what allowed the
[58:35] Tabernacle of God to come into existence
[58:38] and God was pleased with bez's work and
[58:40] he dwelt in that Tabernacle that's how
[58:43] we know God's pleased he comes to dwell
[58:44] in it he lives inside the things that we
[58:46] do he's there present in
[58:50] it but notice it wasn't just
[58:52] bezel yes he has a holy but they he says
[58:55] every other person with
[58:58] skill they're there to help you out
[59:01] that's the reason why the pastor doesn't
[59:02] do everything in this
[59:05] church amen that's why we have deacons
[59:08] that's why we have trustees that's why
[59:09] we have these different people amen many
[59:12] people come in to
[59:14] help and the purpose is to share the
[59:18] load but it's also to express the
[59:21] gifts it's not just making my life
[59:23] easier it's actually making your life
[59:25] better whether you realize it or not to
[59:27] live without purpose is to be
[59:30] miserable you'll be miserable just just
[59:33] going from day one to day two making
[59:35] money paying bills what a miserable life
[59:38] we're here with purpose we've got a
[59:39] reason for being
[59:41] here look at Moses Moses tried doing it
[59:44] all I love Moses Moses is is an amazing
[59:47] character what a tremendous anointing
[59:49] what a tremendous relationship he had
[59:50] with God and yet we see Moses trying to
[59:53] do too much and he's failing and he's
[59:55] failing he was burnt out he was
[59:57] overwhelmed and he didn't know what to
[59:58] do then Jethro came along his
[59:59] father-in-law came along and he said
[1:00:01] Moses listen you're in the tent of uh of
[1:00:04] judgment all day and the people are
[1:00:06] standing in the hot sun all day and
[1:00:09] you're worn out because they're coming
[1:00:10] to you day in and day out all day every
[1:00:12] day asking for your wisdom and your
[1:00:14] leadership and your direction and
[1:00:16] meanwhile they're getting burnt out in
[1:00:17] the sun he says Moses you got to change
[1:00:19] this and watch what he says here says
[1:00:22] and Moses father-in-law said unto him
[1:00:24] the thing that thou doest is is not good
[1:00:26] church can you imagine saying that to
[1:00:28] the anointed prophet of God this man is
[1:00:30] God to the
[1:00:32] people and his father law comes in and
[1:00:34] says what you're doing is not good you
[1:00:36] know what that tells me it tells me not
[1:00:38] a one of us is above correction for our
[1:00:41] own good amen every single one of us is
[1:00:44] not above correction for our own good he
[1:00:46] says Thou wi surely wear away both thou
[1:00:48] and this people that is with thee he
[1:00:51] says you're going to burn out and you're
[1:00:52] going to burn out the Good Will of the
[1:00:53] people as well for this thing is too
[1:00:56] heavy for thee thou are not able to
[1:00:58] perform it thyself alone you say brother
[1:01:00] John I've got a gift I can handle it
[1:01:03] listen you might have a gift but
[1:01:05] sometimes we have what's called scope
[1:01:07] creep brother Paul knows about this
[1:01:09] don't you brother Vel probably a little
[1:01:11] bit brother Mark probably in his past as
[1:01:13] well brother Joe
[1:01:16] definitely scope creep is when they say
[1:01:19] we're going to do
[1:01:20] this but while we're in there somebody
[1:01:23] says well why don't we do this and this
[1:01:26] and then while we're there we might as
[1:01:27] well do
[1:01:29] this I see I see sister Leah smiling as
[1:01:33] well business owners know about scope
[1:01:35] creep you're contracted to do one thing
[1:01:38] and you go in and you do 13 things you
[1:01:40] weren't contracted to do either because
[1:01:42] they expect it or out the Goodwill of
[1:01:44] your heart and then you realize I'm
[1:01:45] losing money on this
[1:01:48] job I'm losing my time I'm losing my
[1:01:51] family I'm losing my marriage I'm losing
[1:01:53] my relationship what is it scope creep B
[1:01:55] based on duty we think we have to do
[1:01:59] these things we can add to our own
[1:02:02] burdens because we're in a position to
[1:02:04] do it not because we're the only ones
[1:02:07] that can do it that's something that as
[1:02:09] Leaders we have to watch out for sure we
[1:02:11] have to be careful we're not taking on
[1:02:12] too much because you'd be surprised how
[1:02:14] much other people can do if you let them
[1:02:16] use their gifts I'm obviously not an
[1:02:19] advocate of church splits but one thing
[1:02:20] I've seen is that out of every Church
[1:02:22] split you realize there was more people
[1:02:23] that had gifts than you ever realized in
[1:02:25] a church
[1:02:26] because guess what you got a whole Cadre
[1:02:27] of musicians you got song leaders you
[1:02:30] didn't know were there you got deacons
[1:02:31] you didn't know were there people that
[1:02:32] can teach Sunday school there are gifts
[1:02:34] there if we're willing to use them
[1:02:35] that's one thing I've certainly learned
[1:02:37] through management is I've learned that
[1:02:38] I don't have to do everything that's why
[1:02:40] you have good people around you is so
[1:02:42] they can support the load and
[1:02:44] everybody's happier because of
[1:02:46] it Jethro says verse 19 hearken now unto
[1:02:49] my voice I will give thee counsel and
[1:02:51] God shall be with thee be thou for the
[1:02:53] people to God word that thou May bring
[1:02:56] the courses the the causes unto God so
[1:02:58] you say Moses you're the only one that
[1:03:00] has a lipto ear relationship with God
[1:03:03] Moses you're the only one that can go
[1:03:04] into the presence of God and come out
[1:03:06] and tell us exactly what God wants done
[1:03:09] nobody else can do this Moses only you
[1:03:11] can do it so he says you do that you be
[1:03:13] you you do the only thing that you can
[1:03:15] do and nobody else can then he says and
[1:03:18] thou shalt teach them ordinances and
[1:03:19] laws and thou shalt show them the way
[1:03:21] therein they must walk and the work that
[1:03:23] they must do he says moreover Thou shalt
[1:03:25] Prov divide out of all the people able
[1:03:28] men such as are such as fear God men of
[1:03:32] Truth hating covetousness now watch this
[1:03:34] now he's saying Moses you've got to go
[1:03:37] pick people that are able but that know
[1:03:42] how to stay in their
[1:03:44] position he's saying they don't want to
[1:03:46] be you Moses see he says that hateth
[1:03:49] covetousness Church does your reputation
[1:03:51] matter your reputation matters because
[1:03:54] people that want Authority rarely have
[1:03:57] the character to handle Authority he
[1:03:59] says you've got to have people that are
[1:04:01] satisfied with where you put them and
[1:04:03] don't try and usurp your Authority or
[1:04:05] undercut you cuz he knows you undercut a
[1:04:08] prophet of God nothing goes well doesn't
[1:04:11] go well he's saying they've got to be
[1:04:13] able to hold their position he says and
[1:04:15] place such over them to be rulers of
[1:04:18] thousands and rulers of hundreds rulers
[1:04:20] of 50s and rulers of tens so there's
[1:04:22] varying levels of responsibility based
[1:04:25] on their natural
[1:04:27] gifts and their reputations he says and
[1:04:30] let them judge the people at all seasons
[1:04:32] and it shall be that every great matter
[1:04:34] they shall bring unto thee but every
[1:04:36] small matter they shall judge so shall
[1:04:39] it be easier for thyself and they shall
[1:04:41] bear the burden with thee so the big
[1:04:43] things it would kind of go through a
[1:04:45] court process so you'd start at the
[1:04:47] lower level I'll go into it in a second
[1:04:49] actually he says if Thou shalt do this
[1:04:51] thing and God command thee so see I love
[1:04:53] Jethro he says listen don't just take my
[1:04:55] word for it you got to lift your
[1:04:57] relationship go ask God if this is the
[1:04:59] right thing to do I've got I think a
[1:05:01] good idea but go get God to confirm it
[1:05:04] and then he says if God's with you then
[1:05:06] Thou shalt be able to endure Moses
[1:05:08] you'll be able to Bear the burden that's
[1:05:10] on you you're obviously not doing you
[1:05:12] say brother John I've been called for
[1:05:14] this position yes but if you cannot bear
[1:05:17] it then something's wrong cuz God will
[1:05:20] never put a burden on you that you can't
[1:05:21] bear and if we're failing then
[1:05:24] something's wrong somewhere
[1:05:27] he says then Thou shalt be able to
[1:05:28] endure and all his people shall also go
[1:05:30] to their place in peace you'll be happy
[1:05:32] and they'll be happy he says so Moses
[1:05:35] hearkened to the voice of his
[1:05:36] father-in-law and did all that he had
[1:05:38] said and Moses chose Abel man out of all
[1:05:41] Israel and made them heads over the
[1:05:42] people rulers of thousands and rulers of
[1:05:44] hundreds rulers of 50s and rulers of
[1:05:47] tens and they judged the people at all
[1:05:49] seasons and the hard causes they brought
[1:05:52] unto Moses but every small matter they
[1:05:55] judged
[1:05:56] themselves so church let me ask you
[1:05:59] where is God in
[1:06:02] this where is God in this now we know
[1:06:04] God is in approval of it because Moses
[1:06:06] did it Moses checks with God God says
[1:06:08] absolutely Moses go do that but God is
[1:06:10] in the gifts God is in the men that are
[1:06:13] able that have the right attitude and
[1:06:16] that are able to stay in their Lane and
[1:06:19] not usur Moses but rather take a burden
[1:06:22] off of his shoulders these are men that
[1:06:24] are secure in who they are that don't
[1:06:27] need to go higher that are satisfied to
[1:06:30] serve where they are church it's it's
[1:06:33] when we covet that we get into problems
[1:06:35] but when we're satisfied with how God
[1:06:37] made us then he can raise us up and
[1:06:41] guess what he'll also take us down if
[1:06:43] we're not ready amen but there is
[1:06:46] nothing obviously Supernatural in this
[1:06:49] series right here th this conversation
[1:06:52] with Jethro there's nothing Supernatural
[1:06:54] in it and yet this is God working in the
[1:06:56] body this is God's will now these men
[1:06:59] are Judges that's what it says there
[1:07:01] they decide what's right and wrong so
[1:07:03] they had this escalating system where
[1:07:05] every the lowest man on the totem pole
[1:07:07] we would say had 10 they said over 10
[1:07:09] people 10 families rulers of 10 families
[1:07:13] and then from there it goes up to the to
[1:07:15] the 50 families then hundreds of
[1:07:16] families then over thousands of families
[1:07:19] and these men in their natural wisdom
[1:07:21] and and understanding would hear
[1:07:24] cases so this is a a it's not a
[1:07:27] spiritual leadership but it's a
[1:07:28] practical leadership it's a it's a a
[1:07:31] governmental leadership of sorts if we
[1:07:32] could put it that way it's Israel's
[1:07:34] court system and Moses is essentially
[1:07:36] the federal Supreme Court but you got to
[1:07:39] work to get to them and only the really
[1:07:43] difficult cases that nobody else can
[1:07:44] figure out would get to Moses level and
[1:07:47] that meant that people could get quick
[1:07:48] and efficient decisions that they didn't
[1:07:50] have to sit out all day because when
[1:07:52] you've only got 10 families then you
[1:07:53] should be able to get through that
[1:07:54] pretty easily I'm sure 10 people 10
[1:07:56] families can't be that bad I don't
[1:07:59] know but it shouldn't be too bad but if
[1:08:03] it's worse than that then you go to the
[1:08:04] guy that's got 50 and you escalate it to
[1:08:06] him and then from there it will move its
[1:08:08] way
[1:08:09] up
[1:08:10] amen but what is it doing it's allowing
[1:08:13] these gifted men to use their gifts and
[1:08:16] I'll tell you what church when you allow
[1:08:18] a gift to be used what happens is it
[1:08:20] takes away a critical spirit because
[1:08:22] what happens is when we're not working
[1:08:25] we have time to criticize but I'll tell
[1:08:27] you what a busy person doesn't have a
[1:08:29] whole lot of time to criticize CU
[1:08:31] they're too busy doing their job amen
[1:08:34] and it's only when you get in your their
[1:08:36] Lane that they start to criticize
[1:08:38] because hey that's my job I'm doing it
[1:08:40] leave it alone but if we're working we
[1:08:43] aren't so critical I
[1:08:44] find that's why we need to spread the
[1:08:46] load sometimes is to get people working
[1:08:49] so they understand the burden as well
[1:08:52] they understand what it's like to be in
[1:08:54] a leadership position to take
[1:08:56] responsibility to be in the public eye
[1:08:58] to realize that we're not perfect and
[1:09:00] people have to be okay with those
[1:09:03] things so Moses he he gets this break
[1:09:05] from this and so now only the biggest
[1:09:07] things come to him and the biggest
[1:09:08] things come to him because he's got
[1:09:09] access directly to
[1:09:11] God so it's a it's a Judicial thing but
[1:09:14] then we come to numbers 11 and this
[1:09:16] legal system is working great and it's
[1:09:18] reduced Mo Moses burden significantly
[1:09:21] but there's still problems and Watch
[1:09:23] What Happens here in numbers 11 it says
[1:09:25] and the mixed multitude was among them
[1:09:28] that was among them fell austing and the
[1:09:31] children of Israel also wept again and
[1:09:33] said who shall give us flesh to eat now
[1:09:35] watch this situation as it starts the
[1:09:37] snowball who starts the complaining
[1:09:39] session the mixed
[1:09:41] multitude the the the the phrase there
[1:09:44] the literal original word is the rabble
[1:09:47] the rabble
[1:09:48] rousers what is it these are people that
[1:09:51] are not Jews that are not Believers that
[1:09:54] attach them themselves to the working of
[1:09:56] God they're there for the supernatural
[1:09:58] food they're there for the blessings
[1:10:00] they're there for the community they're
[1:10:02] there for God taking care of them but
[1:10:04] they are not a part of the promise
[1:10:05] they're not there for the promise
[1:10:07] they're just there to they're leeches
[1:10:10] they're leeches okay so they come along
[1:10:13] and they start lusting for what they
[1:10:14] used to have what they never had church
[1:10:18] was
[1:10:21] slavery these are people that didn't get
[1:10:24] delivered the way Israel did did they
[1:10:26] didn't have an appreciation for the work
[1:10:27] that had gone in this far that what God
[1:10:30] had done but they started focusing on
[1:10:32] what they couldn't get and then that
[1:10:34] trickles over to the real family of God
[1:10:36] if we could put it that way certainly by
[1:10:38] bloodline and now the Israelites have
[1:10:40] the same Spirit as the rabble and they
[1:10:42] start to get together and now the the
[1:10:44] Israelites are Weeping and moaning and
[1:10:46] lamenting and B bemoaning their fate now
[1:10:48] listen to their
[1:10:49] words we remember the
[1:10:52] fish that we did eat in fre Egypt free
[1:10:55] the Cucumbers do you remember those
[1:10:58] cucumbers those cucumbers were so good
[1:11:02] right the melons we haven't had melons
[1:11:05] in so long I can just taste them I can
[1:11:08] see the melons and the
[1:11:10] leaks and the onions and the garlic oh
[1:11:14] what I would give for something
[1:11:18] Savory but now is our soul dried
[1:11:23] away we might giggle a little
[1:11:26] bit really your soul is dried away
[1:11:29] because of your food now we've got some
[1:11:31] Foodies in here brother Vel I'm looking
[1:11:32] at
[1:11:34] you a few
[1:11:37] others yeah I wasn't going to say my
[1:11:39] wife but she gave herself
[1:11:42] away but really can you imagine somebody
[1:11:45] saying my soul is dried away because I
[1:11:48] eat the same food day in and day out see
[1:11:50] that's fine by me I do just okay with
[1:11:53] that but it's like are you are you
[1:11:57] bleeding are you dying from this is it
[1:11:59] literally going to kill you but my my
[1:12:02] soul is dried
[1:12:04] away right and there is nothing at all
[1:12:07] besides the Mana before our eyes I can't
[1:12:10] take this Supernatural food that keeps
[1:12:12] coming down out of Heaven I can't take
[1:12:15] any more of this Supernatural food that
[1:12:16] God's been giving our
[1:12:18] way how quickly church we forget the
[1:12:22] goodness of the provision of God
[1:12:26] amen he says then Moses heard the people
[1:12:29] weep throughout their families every man
[1:12:32] in the door of his tent discontent
[1:12:34] spreads far more quickly than praise and
[1:12:36] worship church I'll tell you that why
[1:12:38] because our nature leans that
[1:12:41] way he says and the anger of the Lord
[1:12:43] was kindled greatly and Moses also was
[1:12:46] displeased and Moses said unto the Lord
[1:12:48] wherefore hast thou Afflicted thy Serv
[1:12:49] he saying why' you put this on me and
[1:12:51] wherefore have I not found favor in thy
[1:12:53] sight that thou layest the burd and of
[1:12:55] all this people upon me have I conceived
[1:12:58] all this people have I begotten them
[1:13:00] that they should have say unto me carry
[1:13:01] them in thy bosom as a nursing father
[1:13:03] beareth the sucking child unto the lamb
[1:13:06] which thou swearest unto their fathers
[1:13:07] Moses saying are these my kids did I
[1:13:09] produce them they never grow up why am I
[1:13:12] the one that has to take all this burden
[1:13:14] Lord why are you putting this on
[1:13:16] me he says when should I have flesh to
[1:13:19] give unto all this people for they weep
[1:13:22] unto me saying give us flesh that we may
[1:13:23] ate he says I can't give them what they
[1:13:25] want God this is your work this is your
[1:13:29] people and yet I'm carrying all the
[1:13:30] weight and the burden of this and they
[1:13:32] keep complaining by the
[1:13:34] way he says I am not able to Bear all
[1:13:37] this people alone because it is too
[1:13:39] heavy for me now Moses starting to feel
[1:13:41] the pressure listen the best of us can
[1:13:43] feel the
[1:13:45] pressure we can get weighed Down Under
[1:13:47] the burdens that we're carrying day by
[1:13:49] day I I I am amazed at Moses because
[1:13:52] Moses stood in the Gap time and time
[1:13:55] time again for those people he offered
[1:13:57] his life for theirs God said listen
[1:13:59] Moses I'll just kill them all and I'll
[1:14:02] start a new family with you and Moses
[1:14:04] said Lord don't do it don't do
[1:14:07] it he stood in the gap for those people
[1:14:10] but church we can hit the ends of our
[1:14:13] natural patience of our natural strength
[1:14:17] of our natural Grace and longsuffering
[1:14:18] and Moses has hit the end of his Road
[1:14:20] here there's a h there's a limit to what
[1:14:22] we can handle on our own absolutely
[1:14:25] absolutely amen but there's also a limit
[1:14:28] to what God wants us to handle that's
[1:14:31] the other side that's the thing we have
[1:14:32] to understand sometimes we take on a
[1:14:34] duty that isn't of God it's of ourselves
[1:14:37] and we lose an opportunity for somebody
[1:14:39] else to spread their wings and start
[1:14:40] doing
[1:14:41] something he says Moses says and if thou
[1:14:44] deal thus with me kill me I pray thee
[1:14:47] out of hand if I have found favor in thy
[1:14:49] sight and let me not see my
[1:14:50] righteousness this this is what I say
[1:14:52] nobody likes me everybody hates me might
[1:14:54] as well eat worms and kill me while
[1:14:55] you're at it Moses is acting like a
[1:15:00] child he's saying if I have found favor
[1:15:03] he says if you're going to keep doing
[1:15:04] this to me kill me I pray
[1:15:07] thee if I found favor Lord if you if you
[1:15:10] would do anything good for me kill
[1:15:13] me Moses has lost it he's been pushed
[1:15:17] over the
[1:15:20] edge sometimes we can get so stuck in
[1:15:22] our duty that we forget
[1:15:25] he's got to be in it that he's got to be
[1:15:28] the one that carries the load Jesus said
[1:15:31] my yoke is easy and my burden is light
[1:15:34] if we can't stand it we've forgotten
[1:15:37] there's another one that's helping us
[1:15:38] with the load so many
[1:15:40] times we are never given a burden we
[1:15:43] cannot bear I can get that way sometimes
[1:15:45] I'm very Duty
[1:15:47] driven but it's been good for me in this
[1:15:49] role pastoral role to just let go and
[1:15:52] let people do their jobs and it works
[1:15:56] beautifully it works beautifully and it
[1:15:58] gives me so much more relaxation and
[1:16:01] allows me to focus on the things that
[1:16:02] only I can
[1:16:03] do and let other men and sisters as a
[1:16:06] case may be do the things that I can now
[1:16:09] watch what happens now the Lord said
[1:16:11] unto Moses verse 16 gather unto me 70
[1:16:14] men of the Elders of Israel whom thou
[1:16:16] knowest to be Elders of the people these
[1:16:18] are spiritual men now these are not just
[1:16:21] naturally gifted men these are men of
[1:16:23] leadership in spiritual roles we have
[1:16:26] Elders in this church they can be a
[1:16:28] deacon like brother Joel and brother
[1:16:30] Matt it can be our older brothers like
[1:16:31] brother Bob and brother Mark or Brother
[1:16:33] David or brother Gerald these are men
[1:16:36] that have a spiritual quality to them
[1:16:39] not just a natural gift
[1:16:41] okay he says and officers over them and
[1:16:44] bring them under the Tabernacle of the
[1:16:45] congregation that they may stand there
[1:16:48] with thee he says and I will come down
[1:16:51] and talk with thee there and I will take
[1:16:53] of the spirit which is upon on thee and
[1:16:56] will put it upon them and they shall
[1:16:58] bear the burden of the people with thee
[1:17:00] that thou beare not thyself alone it
[1:17:03] says and the Lord came down in a cloud
[1:17:05] and spake unto him and took of the
[1:17:07] spirit that was upon him and gave it
[1:17:09] unto the 70 elders and it came to pass
[1:17:12] that when the spirit rested upon them
[1:17:14] they prophesied and did not cease now we
[1:17:16] don't know who these men were except for
[1:17:18] two amen but they may have been taken
[1:17:20] out of the the original group the judges
[1:17:23] we don't really know but we see here
[1:17:25] what God did here because these are
[1:17:27] gifted men These Are Spiritual men these
[1:17:30] are leaders in their own right but that
[1:17:32] wasn't enough to Bear the burden of
[1:17:35] moses' spiritual
[1:17:36] leadership God had to do a work in their
[1:17:39] life and the difference here is that
[1:17:42] they had to come under a new
[1:17:44] leadership what was it the spirit of God
[1:17:47] upon them you can't help a prophet under
[1:17:50] your own leadership you can't help a
[1:17:52] pastor under your own leadership you
[1:17:55] deacons you can't help me if you're
[1:17:57] under your own leadership a different
[1:17:58] leadership if I could say it that way
[1:18:00] same with the trustees same with the
[1:18:02] treasur same with everyone in this
[1:18:04] congregation you cannot help unless
[1:18:06] we're under the same anointing and that
[1:18:08] anointing brings us into unity and it
[1:18:10] shares the load and it gives us purpose
[1:18:12] in the body of
[1:18:14] Christ remember that gift is something
[1:18:17] that God can anoint that's what a gift
[1:18:19] is is something that God can anoint and
[1:18:21] God poured out his Spirit on these men
[1:18:23] in a measure of what was in
[1:18:27] Moses Moses had the greatest anointing
[1:18:29] of all of them but they got a portion of
[1:18:31] these things and it was the same
[1:18:33] prophetic spirit that spoke frogs into
[1:18:35] existence that spoke uh lice into
[1:18:38] existence that turned the the water into
[1:18:40] blood and these different things it was
[1:18:41] the same anointing the same power the
[1:18:43] same Authority that Moses had in leading
[1:18:45] them out and because Moses now has the
[1:18:47] legal side covered with all those other
[1:18:49] judges now God says I'm going to let you
[1:18:51] have the support on the spiritual side
[1:18:54] but it's going to take my spirit to do
[1:18:55] it and he fills those men with the
[1:18:57] spirit it says the spirit rested upon
[1:18:59] them and they prophesied and did not
[1:19:00] cease these men were not speaking now
[1:19:03] out of wisdom they were speaking out of
[1:19:05] thus saith the Lord they were speaking
[1:19:08] with the same Authority that Moses did
[1:19:10] because they were under the same
[1:19:11] anointing these men were absolutes to
[1:19:13] the people just like Moses they did not
[1:19:16] replace him not a one of them had the
[1:19:18] measure that he had but they could speak
[1:19:21] now as thus sayeth the Lord just as
[1:19:23] Moses did
[1:19:26] they didn't replace him they supported
[1:19:28] him they took the burden off of the
[1:19:30] shoulders of the the spiritual head of
[1:19:32] the house it's no different today in the
[1:19:35] local body that's what you have you have
[1:19:37] a pastor that serves as the spiritual
[1:19:39] lead the holy spirit's the leader it's
[1:19:41] got to be the leader but under that he
[1:19:43] has placed men but under that man he has
[1:19:45] placed other men and they are there to
[1:19:47] share that burden and that's one of the
[1:19:49] greatest Revelations I believe a pastor
[1:19:52] can have is that God gives you people to
[1:19:54] help you not just to try
[1:19:57] you you're here to
[1:19:59] help not to make my life difficult but
[1:20:03] to make our lives better and easier and
[1:20:06] more efficient in the kingdom of God it
[1:20:08] really it really appeals to the
[1:20:10] engineering side of me why do with one
[1:20:12] what you can do with
[1:20:14] 50 everybody works a lot better if we
[1:20:16] all carry just a little bit rather than
[1:20:18] one or two carrying the heavy
[1:20:20] loads we talked about natural things we
[1:20:23] talk about athleticism and these
[1:20:25] different things we talked about looks
[1:20:26] and you know we don't really look at
[1:20:28] looks as a gift from
[1:20:29] God what about
[1:20:32] Esther Esther was a babe Esther was
[1:20:35] gorgeous was she beautiful just to be
[1:20:39] beautiful no Esther was one of the most
[1:20:42] beautiful women in the Kingdom maybe she
[1:20:44] was the most beautiful but you'll notice
[1:20:45] with Esther it's not just her looks that
[1:20:48] got her in but it got her foot in the
[1:20:50] door they didn't know what kind of
[1:20:52] person Esther was when she showed up but
[1:20:54] they saw saw she was beautiful and that
[1:20:55] got her in the door but when she got in
[1:20:57] the Door Church what gave her
[1:20:59] favor that she was a daughter of God and
[1:21:02] she had the character and the attitude
[1:21:04] to match her looks that's the thing that
[1:21:06] made her U such a special person amen we
[1:21:10] we've talked about before brother Bram
[1:21:12] says power without character is satanic
[1:21:14] let me tell you a gift without character
[1:21:17] is going to cause you problems
[1:21:19] absolutely amen you ever you ever meet
[1:21:22] somebody that's good-looking and they
[1:21:23] know it
[1:21:25] and they act
[1:21:26] it nobody wants to be around them but
[1:21:30] those that are gracious and kind and
[1:21:33] humble boy that people will do anything
[1:21:35] for a humble good-look person I'll tell
[1:21:37] you is it this is driven by data that
[1:21:40] people that are goodlucky make more
[1:21:41] money and it's not cuz they're all
[1:21:44] jerks there's an advantage that comes
[1:21:46] with those things they receive favor
[1:21:48] because they're looks or match with
[1:21:49] their attitudes Esther's looks are what
[1:21:51] made her eligible to step into the
[1:21:52] King's house but it was the work of God
[1:21:55] in her life that gave her grace and
[1:21:56] favor above and beyond her looks listen
[1:21:59] as as as sisters in this church and in
[1:22:02] the body of Christ your looks will never
[1:22:05] match what this world has in terms of
[1:22:08] perfection because they can cover every
[1:22:10] blemish they can prop they can pull they
[1:22:12] can push they can pluck they can add
[1:22:14] they can color they can do everything to
[1:22:16] make themselves perfect but what they
[1:22:18] will never match is the honest raw
[1:22:20] beauty of a daughter of God not even
[1:22:24] close
[1:22:25] I'll tell you I I've seen you know after
[1:22:28] 20 years and 25 years working going to
[1:22:32] school you can see somebody that's
[1:22:34] beautiful one day and then they run into
[1:22:36] class and they didn't have time to wash
[1:22:38] their hair and they didn't have time to
[1:22:40] put their makeup on and you wonder what
[1:22:41] truck ran them
[1:22:43] over because what they need that to be
[1:22:47] beautiful but your beauty is not
[1:22:50] skin it's that Meek and humble spirit
[1:22:52] that you have do you know that's what
[1:22:54] men are looking for these days they have
[1:22:56] completely lost it on powerful
[1:23:01] authoritative driven women because what
[1:23:03] does it do it brings a clash in the home
[1:23:06] and they're looking for genuine women
[1:23:09] real women and you know where they find
[1:23:11] them the Christian
[1:23:13] Community because they're not so caught
[1:23:15] on looks they're beautiful sisters
[1:23:16] you're
[1:23:17] beautiful but your beauty goes Way
[1:23:19] Beyond what we see with our eyes it goes
[1:23:22] to the character of your hearts and your
[1:23:23] souls
[1:23:25] but gester comes in and she finds this
[1:23:27] favor and remember what happens she
[1:23:29] comes in and the and the the unic the
[1:23:31] chief unic he gives her favor he gives
[1:23:33] her he puts her to the front of the
[1:23:34] queue he he favors her and her servants
[1:23:36] and when it comes time to go before the
[1:23:38] king she doesn't say here's what I like
[1:23:40] she says what does the king like and she
[1:23:43] wears and sets herself up the way the
[1:23:44] king's like and and he falls in love
[1:23:46] with her and he takes her and he makes
[1:23:47] her his Queen but what is Esther's
[1:23:50] purpose what is the reason for Esther's
[1:23:52] looks is it for powers is it for
[1:23:54] Authority is is it for fame is it for
[1:23:57] the ability to get whatever she
[1:23:59] wants no that's not why God made Esther
[1:24:02] beautiful God made Esther beautiful for
[1:24:04] one reason alone just one reason look
[1:24:08] what look what Mori says to her he he
[1:24:12] remember what happened is he said listen
[1:24:13] you got to go to the king and you got to
[1:24:15] tell him that we're in danger and you
[1:24:17] got to lay yourself on the line and you
[1:24:19] got to lay the you got to you got to go
[1:24:21] and and beg for your people's lives she
[1:24:23] says no I can't go in he might kill me
[1:24:26] cuz remember you had to be called into
[1:24:27] the king's presence otherwise if you
[1:24:29] went of your own accord he could either
[1:24:31] extend the scepter of Grace or if he
[1:24:33] withheld it they killed you right there
[1:24:36] without Mercy she says I can't go in and
[1:24:38] he hasn't called for me in a month he
[1:24:40] says listen if you hold your peace we're
[1:24:43] going to die and you don't know but that
[1:24:45] you're going to die down the road as
[1:24:46] well he says for if thou alt together
[1:24:48] holdest thy peace at this time then
[1:24:50] shall there be enlargement and
[1:24:52] deliverance arise to the Jews from
[1:24:53] another place he says God's going to
[1:24:55] take care of us one way or the other he
[1:24:57] says but thou and thy father's house
[1:24:59] shall be destroyed but who knoweth
[1:25:01] whether Thou Art come to the kingdom for
[1:25:03] such a time as this why is Esther
[1:25:06] beautiful church for such a time as
[1:25:09] this she probably got a lot of attention
[1:25:12] throughout her life beautiful young
[1:25:14] woman single and then she meets the king
[1:25:16] and he makes her his Queen and he puts
[1:25:18] her in power church he offers her twice
[1:25:20] up to half of his
[1:25:22] kingdom remember what we said those
[1:25:24] gifts need to be matured with
[1:25:26] character she could have taken that half
[1:25:29] his kingdom and just waltzed into a
[1:25:32] beautiful life wealth Fame riches every
[1:25:35] single luxury she could ever want but
[1:25:38] when it came down to the time where he
[1:25:40] says what do you want she says I want my
[1:25:41] life and those of my people she was
[1:25:44] there for them not just for herself her
[1:25:48] beauty put her in a place to intercede
[1:25:50] for
[1:25:52] others do looks matter no can God use
[1:25:57] them yep he did for Esther David was a
[1:26:01] handsome man Saul was a handsome
[1:26:05] man Saul thought too much of
[1:26:08] himself see God can use it but we can
[1:26:11] also suppress it with a an arrogance
[1:26:13] about the things that he gives
[1:26:15] us God's looking for Witnesses
[1:26:18] everywhere you might be an
[1:26:21] athlete you might be very charismatic
[1:26:24] listen you need to be a witness wherever
[1:26:26] God places you you know brother Jason
[1:26:27] Watkins said something a very long time
[1:26:29] ago and I'm I'm going to paraphrase he
[1:26:31] says if you're an athlete be a Christian
[1:26:34] athlete if you're a CEO be a Christian
[1:26:37] CEO because God needs Witnesses in the
[1:26:38] locker room and God needs Witnesses in
[1:26:41] the boardroom as
[1:26:43] well I'm not advocating professional
[1:26:46] athleticism I don't think brother Jason
[1:26:48] was either but he's saying as far as you
[1:26:50] go as far as God will take you as far as
[1:26:54] your life will allow you be a witness
[1:26:57] and the purpose is not to be athletic
[1:26:59] the purpose is to be a Christian and
[1:27:01] we've got to be able to be honest with
[1:27:03] ourselves is this taking is this success
[1:27:06] taking me beyond my Christianity because
[1:27:09] if the locker room is having a more of
[1:27:10] an effect on you than the Christianity
[1:27:12] is having on the locker room guess what
[1:27:14] time to go if they're changing me
[1:27:16] instead of me changing them if they're
[1:27:17] affecting me instead of me affecting
[1:27:19] them then I can't be where I am I've got
[1:27:21] to be able to say I've got to lay it
[1:27:23] down I've got to Let It Go do I think
[1:27:25] you can be a CEO today and be a
[1:27:28] Christian Daniel was Joseph was Joseph
[1:27:33] was the head over all of all of the
[1:27:34] finances and the the princes of Egypt
[1:27:37] but let me tell you you won't get there
[1:27:39] without a test of character first God's
[1:27:41] going to prove you and if he's in it
[1:27:43] he'll absolutely prove you listen what
[1:27:45] David said about Joseph he says he sent
[1:27:48] a man before them even Joseph who was
[1:27:50] sold for a servant you want to become a
[1:27:52] CEO listen to this whose feet they hurt
[1:27:55] with feeds and he was laid in Iron until
[1:27:57] the time that his word came see Joseph
[1:27:59] was living under a promise and he says
[1:28:02] until the time of the promise came the
[1:28:04] word of the Lord did one thing it Tried
[1:28:07] Him it tested him it prepared him it
[1:28:11] molded him it shaped him it got him to
[1:28:13] the place where when he came into Power
[1:28:16] he would use it for salvation rather
[1:28:18] than for Revenge he says the king then
[1:28:21] sent and loosed him even the ruler of
[1:28:22] the people and let him go free he made
[1:28:24] him Lord of his house and ruler of all
[1:28:26] his substance to bind his princes at his
[1:28:29] pleasure and teach his Senators wisdom
[1:28:32] if you're going to become a CEO let me
[1:28:33] put it this way you're not going to get
[1:28:34] there on the path that everyone else
[1:28:36] does you know why cu the path to a CEO
[1:28:39] in this modern day world is out of
[1:28:42] balance most CEOs are on their second or
[1:28:45] third marriage and are usually
[1:28:48] divorced because they cannot live a life
[1:28:50] of balance they have to sacrifice
[1:28:52] something and so they sacrific their
[1:28:53] marriage
[1:28:54] they have affairs they're always going
[1:28:57] they're never at home they can't raise
[1:28:58] their children horrible track record of
[1:29:00] a family but they've got everything on
[1:29:03] the business side of
[1:29:05] things so can you be a CEO today and be
[1:29:07] a Christian sure if God makes you one
[1:29:10] but let me tell you he'll test you every
[1:29:12] bit of the way or he'll give you your
[1:29:14] own company like brother Chad and
[1:29:15] brother Joe they call themselves
[1:29:17] presidents I think but God can give you
[1:29:20] something like that but I'll tell you
[1:29:22] one thing along the way and I've seen
[1:29:23] this in my own career as I've moved is
[1:29:25] God says are you going to prioritize me
[1:29:28] are you going to prioritize your
[1:29:29] promotion your money your business and
[1:29:32] those different things because God wants
[1:29:33] to have the
[1:29:34] preeminence and if I'm willing to put
[1:29:37] something else in preeminence you know
[1:29:38] what's going to happen I'm going to
[1:29:40] slide
[1:29:42] into coldness
[1:29:45] formality
[1:29:47] religion because I put something else
[1:29:49] ahead of God and that's the only thing
[1:29:50] that's left God's going to prove what
[1:29:52] matters most to us every single time
[1:29:54] he's going to do that he'll see where
[1:29:56] our priorities are listen J Joseph was a
[1:29:58] nobody when he showed up to Egypt he was
[1:30:00] a slave an Israelite slave he was a
[1:30:02] nobody with a gift and God turned him
[1:30:05] into a somebody and it was through feds
[1:30:07] of iron and it was through prison time
[1:30:09] and it was through falling falling
[1:30:11] falling and God molded that man into a
[1:30:13] place where he could literally save the
[1:30:17] world these are great people we've
[1:30:19] talked about tonight we call them Heroes
[1:30:22] of the faith people with tremendous
[1:30:25] relationships with God you think of
[1:30:26] Moses a man that could literally walk
[1:30:28] into the presence of God and have a
[1:30:31] conversation what would you give for
[1:30:33] that gift
[1:30:34] tonight that when you have a question
[1:30:37] you could say God tell me and he would
[1:30:39] give you his literal answer by his own
[1:30:43] voice amazing people I want to take us
[1:30:46] over to Hebrews 11 tonight as we start
[1:30:48] to close and there Paul would mention
[1:30:50] he'd talk about Abel and Noah and
[1:30:52] Abraham and Sarah and Moses and Jacob
[1:30:54] and Joseph and these are big people with
[1:30:56] big interactions and big moments with
[1:30:58] God and big conversations and big
[1:31:00] expressions of Faith but I want to share
[1:31:03] something again that brother Jason
[1:31:04] Watkins had talked about a while ago
[1:31:06] because thinking of Abraham you think of
[1:31:08] Abraham and you say I can't be like
[1:31:10] Abraham Abraham is greater than I am but
[1:31:13] what did Abraham do Abraham left what he
[1:31:16] had for the promise of
[1:31:19] God he left his family he left his
[1:31:23] opportunity
[1:31:24] he left his religion he left everything
[1:31:27] behind based on a SLE a simple
[1:31:29] conversation with the word you say I
[1:31:32] can't be like
[1:31:33] him look at what you've done we have
[1:31:37] people that literally did that walked
[1:31:39] away from family walked away from
[1:31:40] religion walked away from opportunity we
[1:31:42] have people in here that have turned
[1:31:43] down jobs turned down promotions turned
[1:31:45] down careers to be in a certain place to
[1:31:48] do something in the body of
[1:31:49] Christ is it any less Faith than Abraham
[1:31:52] had no you responded to the word it's
[1:31:56] the same Faith it's the same Faith you
[1:31:58] are children of the faithful Abraham the
[1:32:01] faith that he had is the faith that we
[1:32:03] have do you did you know any more than
[1:32:05] Abraham did when you left sister Brenda
[1:32:07] you didn't you took a simple message and
[1:32:10] you said that's for me and you walked
[1:32:13] out and yes you have pains and yes you
[1:32:15] have hurts and yes you have offenses and
[1:32:17] it's maybe been a rocky road at times
[1:32:19] but the promise is still there and
[1:32:22] you're walking Faithfully in the things
[1:32:25] but listen to what Paul says near the
[1:32:26] end of this chapter now he says he's
[1:32:29] talked about all these and he says what
[1:32:30] shall I more say what more is left to
[1:32:32] say he says for time would fail me I
[1:32:34] don't have enough time to tell of Gideon
[1:32:36] and barck and Samson and Jeep of David
[1:32:39] also and Samuel and of the prophets look
[1:32:41] at that list look at Gideon Gideon a
[1:32:45] great Soldier and a judge of Israel
[1:32:47] Samson a man of great strength a judge
[1:32:49] for 20 years the strongest man to ever
[1:32:52] live on this Earth when the spirit of
[1:32:54] God was on
[1:32:55] him David The Greatest Warrior warrior
[1:32:58] in Israel's history the greatest King in
[1:33:00] terms of Victories a man after God's Own
[1:33:03] Heart Giant
[1:33:05] Slayer Samuel one of the greatest
[1:33:08] prophets in the scripture a man perfect
[1:33:10] in his walk we have no actual uh place
[1:33:14] that shows where Samuel made a mistake
[1:33:16] not that we believe he was sinless but
[1:33:18] his walk with God was perfect he never
[1:33:21] held back what God told him to say he
[1:33:24] was perfectly a microphone for
[1:33:27] God a a tremendous Prophet that led
[1:33:30] Israel so perfectly for so long but you
[1:33:33] notice I skipped a couple people there
[1:33:35] who was
[1:33:38] baric baric was a
[1:33:40] nobody baric was a nobody that God chose
[1:33:43] we have no prior information about baric
[1:33:46] until he's called out and what happens
[1:33:48] is a woman a propheus Deborah comes to
[1:33:50] him and says baric God told me to come
[1:33:53] to you tell you to take 10,000 soldiers
[1:33:55] and go to such and such a place and I'm
[1:33:57] going to lead the enemy to you and you
[1:33:59] can fight them and you'll win he says
[1:34:02] not on your life I'm not going unless
[1:34:03] you're going to go he says I don't trust
[1:34:05] you unless you're going to put your life
[1:34:06] on the line as well she says good I'll
[1:34:09] come along I'll be there with you she
[1:34:11] said but just realize this the battle
[1:34:13] won't belong to you the battle's going
[1:34:14] to go to a woman so this is a man who's
[1:34:17] going to go fight a battle and the women
[1:34:19] are going to get all the glory baric a
[1:34:22] nobody he's just a pawn in God's hand
[1:34:26] he's a one- hit wonder we never hear
[1:34:28] anything of baric he he he goes in he
[1:34:31] fights they win the battle CIS flees the
[1:34:34] woman jail takes him puts a temp peg in
[1:34:36] his in his ear Temple kills him and then
[1:34:41] baric sings a song with Deborah and then
[1:34:42] that's it we hear that's all we ever
[1:34:44] hear baric he's a nobody but let me tell
[1:34:48] you who's even less of a no even more of
[1:34:49] a nobody maybe we put it anybody know
[1:34:52] much about jeepa
[1:34:56] jeepa he's a piece of
[1:34:58] trash jeepa is the son of a
[1:35:02] prostitute Jeep's dad went playing
[1:35:05] around where he wasn't supposed to play
[1:35:07] around got a prostitute pregnant she had
[1:35:10] a child he took him into his own family
[1:35:14] but when he had legitimate children by
[1:35:16] his own wife those Brothers took him and
[1:35:19] kicked him out he was kicked out of his
[1:35:22] family home he was kicked out of his
[1:35:24] City he was kicked out of the Tabernacle
[1:35:27] he was a bastard he was not allowed to
[1:35:29] come into the Tabernacle and worship God
[1:35:32] so they said you can't be here you might
[1:35:34] be the firstborn but you're illegitimate
[1:35:36] you have no inheritance with us get
[1:35:38] out so jeeta
[1:35:41] leaves and he has nothing to he has he
[1:35:44] has nothing to live by he has nothing to
[1:35:46] support himself and so jeeta becomes a
[1:35:48] warrior because everything he gets he's
[1:35:50] got to get by the strength of his arm he
[1:35:52] has to fight to get get everything he
[1:35:54] does and he goes into a different part
[1:35:55] of the land and there he sets up and he
[1:35:57] gets a band of men together and he
[1:35:58] becomes The Greatest Warrior in the area
[1:36:00] and he makes a reputation for his
[1:36:02] fighting skill that's the only thing he
[1:36:04] knows how to do is fight but then Israel
[1:36:06] gets in trouble and they they get an
[1:36:07] army that starts to invade and so
[1:36:09] sheepishly they say to jeepa uh can you
[1:36:11] come back
[1:36:13] now the the one that they hated before
[1:36:16] the one that they put out the one they
[1:36:18] had no time for the one that they
[1:36:19] wouldn't allow to worship with them they
[1:36:21] said' do you mind coming over and saving
[1:36:22] us and jeffa says sure if you let me
[1:36:25] become the leader again give me back the
[1:36:27] home in Gilead let me come and be the
[1:36:29] head of the household they said okay
[1:36:30] we'll let you do it so he comes in and
[1:36:33] Watch What Happens here it says then
[1:36:36] jeffa has everything he's a he's a he's
[1:36:39] a he's a nobody he's scum he's filth not
[1:36:43] worthy to be seen in the company
[1:36:46] of it says then the spirit of the Lord
[1:36:48] Came Upon
[1:36:49] jeepa and he passed over Gilead and
[1:36:52] Manasseh and passed over m of Gilead and
[1:36:54] from mispah of Gilead he passed over
[1:36:56] under the children of Ammon that's the F
[1:36:58] the the the army that had come in he
[1:37:00] says so jeepa passed over unto the
[1:37:02] children of Ammon to fight against them
[1:37:03] and the Lord delivered them into His
[1:37:06] Hands Church this man had nothing going
[1:37:09] for him he was an
[1:37:11] outcast he was the kind of thing you
[1:37:13] scrape off the bottom of your
[1:37:17] Che he's a
[1:37:19] nobody you know what he is though he's a
[1:37:22] child of God
[1:37:24] he's a child of God and the spirit of
[1:37:26] God comes on him and that man that is a
[1:37:29] warrior now becomes a warrior that can
[1:37:31] deliver he's not just fighting for
[1:37:33] himself now yes he's got selfish motives
[1:37:35] we would say but he's there and he does
[1:37:37] a victory that he couldn't do before why
[1:37:39] the spirit of the Lord comes on
[1:37:43] him God turned the son of a prostitute
[1:37:46] into a judge of Israel that's what he
[1:37:49] became after this he became a judge a
[1:37:51] man that was rejected it seemed of God
[1:37:54] and man became a judge of Israel Saul
[1:37:57] the first king of Israel he had a gift
[1:38:00] of
[1:38:02] leadership but he didn't think he had it
[1:38:06] and God said listen I'm going to come on
[1:38:08] you I'm going to give you a new heart
[1:38:09] and I'm going to put my spirit on you
[1:38:11] and that'll make you into a King Saul
[1:38:14] that's when Saul went to the to the the
[1:38:16] school of the prophets and he prophesied
[1:38:17] there and Saul for the first while was a
[1:38:20] tremendous King you know why he was
[1:38:22] humble and he was obedient you want to
[1:38:25] succeed in life as a Believer you want
[1:38:27] to succeed in life be humble and be
[1:38:29] obedient to the spirit of God but what
[1:38:32] happened is Saul started to get caught
[1:38:34] up in his success see the the the the
[1:38:38] army of Israel was so humble that only
[1:38:41] Saul and Jonathan had
[1:38:43] swords and yet they would win Victory
[1:38:45] after Victory after Victory against
[1:38:47] fully armored fully weaponized foes
[1:38:50] you'd think that would kind of drive
[1:38:52] into you a little bit this ain't me this
[1:38:54] is God but Saul got worked up and he he
[1:38:56] started to think more of himself and he
[1:38:58] started to worry about holding on to his
[1:39:01] kingship rather than serving the god
[1:39:03] that placed him in
[1:39:05] kingship and by choice Saul started to
[1:39:08] turn away the word of God and the
[1:39:11] leadership of God and eventually what
[1:39:13] happened is God took that spirit away
[1:39:14] and he put it on David and Saul was left
[1:39:17] with his original leadership skills and
[1:39:18] guess what that always leads us into
[1:39:21] selfishness every single time
[1:39:23] it might be a gift of God but if he
[1:39:26] doesn't anoint it it takes us down a
[1:39:27] path of
[1:39:29] self uh self- privilege of doing what's
[1:39:32] best for
[1:39:33] ourselves and when that happened God
[1:39:35] couldn't do anything with Saul God
[1:39:37] wouldn't do anything with Saul remember
[1:39:39] Saul when he comes to the end of his
[1:39:40] life and he goes to the witch of Endor
[1:39:42] he says listen God doesn't talk to me
[1:39:46] the ephod doesn't talk to me dreams
[1:39:48] Visions are gone God doesn't speak to me
[1:39:50] anymore you know why he chose to ignore
[1:39:53] what God had told him but as long as
[1:39:55] that Spirit was on him and he obeyed it
[1:39:57] he was okay every single one of these
[1:40:00] people that we've talked about had an
[1:40:01] anointing on them they had a gift that
[1:40:04] God could anoint but it was always a
[1:40:07] temporary thing we look in the
[1:40:08] scriptures and we see how they fell we
[1:40:10] see how Moses fell we see how David Fell
[1:40:12] we saw the faults of these different
[1:40:14] ones even Joseph had his moments they
[1:40:16] misst they abused that gift or that
[1:40:19] anointing that was there and yet God
[1:40:21] would use them wonderfully and
[1:40:22] supernaturally time and time
[1:40:25] again what can you do
[1:40:29] today you have the Holy Spirit dwelling
[1:40:31] inside of you you don't just have an
[1:40:34] anointing that's wrapped around you you
[1:40:35] have the personal presence of God inside
[1:40:37] your soul
[1:40:39] tonight you have an opportunity for your
[1:40:42] gifts to be used in a way that that that
[1:40:45] would surpass anything that's written in
[1:40:49] scripture because you have an indwelling
[1:40:51] Spirit not just a cloak of an
[1:40:56] anointing if he could do that with them
[1:40:58] what can he do with us tonight amen
[1:41:01] let's stand if we
[1:41:04] would you know when I'm talk thinking of
[1:41:07] gifts and these things for whatever
[1:41:09] reason my mind always goes to the
[1:41:12] sisters because I think too often
[1:41:16] sisters you
[1:41:17] forget how great a role you play and how
[1:41:20] great a gift you have
[1:41:24] as a
[1:41:25] mother remember brother Bram said even
[1:41:28] if you're just a housewife he says
[1:41:29] nobody can replace
[1:41:31] you do you
[1:41:33] know you might be a good
[1:41:36] mother you want to be a great mother let
[1:41:39] the Holy Spirit step into your
[1:41:42] motherhood put the books
[1:41:44] down put your prayer time in start
[1:41:48] saying to God God I want to step out of
[1:41:51] what I can do and start start to see
[1:41:53] what you can do you might be a great
[1:41:56] mother you want to be the greatest
[1:41:59] mother let go and let God have his way
[1:42:02] you might not be a good mother you know
[1:42:05] motherhood doesn't come naturally to
[1:42:07] every woman absolutely not there are
[1:42:10] elements there where most most women
[1:42:12] will have areas where they do pretty
[1:42:14] good and they'll have areas where
[1:42:15] they're not so good and you can look at
[1:42:18] yourself and say why am I not a good
[1:42:19] mother this way why can't I do this why
[1:42:22] isn't this ful in why isn't this natural
[1:42:25] you know why cuz you're meant to let the
[1:42:27] Holy Spirit do a work in
[1:42:29] you other women that don't know the Lord
[1:42:34] all they're left with is help
[1:42:36] books and talking to friends and maybe
[1:42:38] you can try this and maybe you can try
[1:42:40] that but you know what I found in the
[1:42:42] scriptures is that mothers that
[1:42:44] prayed always seemed to somehow make it
[1:42:48] through that God could give them the
[1:42:50] right words to say he could put the
[1:42:52] right desire on their hearts he could
[1:42:54] give them wisdom that they didn't have
[1:42:56] before not just for mothers for fathers
[1:42:58] as well I'll speak to you tonight what
[1:43:01] happens when we lay ourselves Before the
[1:43:03] Throne of God and say God I need more
[1:43:07] than what I've naturally got that's the
[1:43:09] opportunity for God to step in and
[1:43:11] anoint a gift in your life that you may
[1:43:13] not have even realized you had he'll
[1:43:15] give you the right words he'll give you
[1:43:16] the right attitude he'll give you the
[1:43:18] right response he'll give you the right
[1:43:20] silence
[1:43:23] he'll give you the patience he'll give
[1:43:25] you the love he'll give you the
[1:43:28] rest he'll give you Clarity in a time
[1:43:30] where it seems like you don't know what
[1:43:31] to
[1:43:32] do there are situations I'm praying
[1:43:35] about and I say Lord I don't have a
[1:43:39] clue how to work through this one you're
[1:43:42] going to run into that as a spouse as a
[1:43:44] mother as a father certainly our
[1:43:46] brothers in their roles in the church
[1:43:47] you're going to run into situations
[1:43:48] you've never been before and you say how
[1:43:50] do I do it by the spirit
[1:43:53] according to the word of God
[1:43:57] Amen what is it it's God now stepping
[1:44:00] out of that Soul not stepping out but
[1:44:04] diffusing from that from that Command
[1:44:06] Center inside and he's starting now not
[1:44:09] to take
[1:44:10] control but we yield
[1:44:13] control and he starts to step in and now
[1:44:16] you're a supernatural mother you're a
[1:44:20] supernatural father you're a
[1:44:21] supernatural Deacon you're you're a
[1:44:23] supernatural young woman you're a
[1:44:24] supernatural young brother you're a
[1:44:27] supernatural student you're a
[1:44:28] supernatural mechanic whatever it might
[1:44:30] be it's God stepping now out of the soul
[1:44:33] and into the spirit and the flesh
[1:44:36] revealing himself one more time before
[1:44:38] he takes us away we're going to look at
[1:44:40] what's possible when God steps
[1:44:43] in we're going to talk about the third
[1:44:45] poll where deity speaks again and the
[1:44:49] word is fulfilled in this final age
[1:44:53] that's what he's here to do the holy
[1:44:55] spirit is here to make the word be
[1:44:56] fulfilled in our lives in the Simplicity
[1:44:59] of motherhood
[1:45:01] fatherhood a spouse a minister a church
[1:45:06] office musicians whatever it might be
[1:45:09] that's what he's here to do is to show
[1:45:11] you what's possible when you take what
[1:45:13] he's given you and you give it back to
[1:45:15] him and say Lord have your
[1:45:17] way amen let's bow our heads
[1:45:23] Lord
[1:45:24] Jesus Lord we're getting down to where
[1:45:27] we live that's for
[1:45:28] sure Lord and you see this wonderful
[1:45:31] group of people that stands here this
[1:45:34] evening Lord you had a a template for
[1:45:37] each
[1:45:38] one and after you created them Lord you
[1:45:40] burn that template because there's not
[1:45:42] another one like them Lord and you built
[1:45:45] into them gifts you built into them a
[1:45:48] nature you built into them strengths you
[1:45:52] built into them a
[1:45:53] advantages Lord and it's meant to be for
[1:45:56] your
[1:45:58] glory Lord we're
[1:46:00] asking that we would learn a little more
[1:46:04] to surrender them to
[1:46:06] you Lord for what we need in this day is
[1:46:08] a body that is surrendered to the Head
[1:46:11] Lord that you would have the absolute
[1:46:13] preeminence in our life Lord that we
[1:46:16] would have a day-by-day relationship
[1:46:18] with you Lord where we can go into your
[1:46:21] presence and we can can come out with a
[1:46:24] supernatural
[1:46:27] response Lord I believe we've been given
[1:46:29] a supernatural word a rapturing word
[1:46:32] Lord but that Rapture is a promise a
[1:46:34] process of turning us into the image
[1:46:37] that you
[1:46:38] had Lord I pray you mature our gifts I
[1:46:41] pray you mature our Natures that you
[1:46:43] mature the blessings that you've given
[1:46:45] us in these natural bodies Lord I
[1:46:48] believe there are spiritual gifts here
[1:46:50] unexpressed but I believe there are
[1:46:52] natural gifts that that are not
[1:46:53] perfectly expressed as well Lord in my
[1:46:55] own life and in those
[1:46:56] around Lord I pray you help us to seek
[1:47:00] you to surrender to you Lord and to find
[1:47:03] your leading on our
[1:47:05] day Lord bless these people bless them
[1:47:08] for their service Lord bless them for
[1:47:09] their commitment for their patience Lord
[1:47:12] and give us Grace one for another Lord
[1:47:15] that we could be in unity under your
[1:47:16] spirit in your word in Jesus Christ's
[1:47:19] name we ask it amen

[1:53:26] God bless us with his presence tonight
[1:53:28] as he has
[1:53:29] already two announcements to make I'll
[1:53:31] do this real quick one is that um the
[1:53:35] deacons have advised me that uh the
[1:53:38] front door was left open when there was
[1:53:40] nobody here was left unlocked um I think
[1:53:43] it happened one time before a long time
[1:53:45] ago um but it's critical that the last
[1:53:48] person out makes sure that all the doors
[1:53:50] are locked usually it's one of the
[1:53:52] trustees one of the deacons that leaves
[1:53:54] last after service but if you're here
[1:53:56] during the week or something like that
[1:53:58] please be sure to lock that door I've
[1:54:01] come by and seen the children from the
[1:54:03] school pulling out the door handles so
[1:54:06] if the door hadn't to be unlocked when
[1:54:07] somebody came along and you had kids
[1:54:09] from the school in here so it's really
[1:54:12] important uh so we we'd appreciate that
[1:54:15] the other announcement that I had is
[1:54:16] Matt's birthday
[1:54:18] today just thought I'd passed that
[1:54:20] on under threat of a lot of pain so uh I
[1:54:25] just thought I'd mention that sorry man
[1:54:29] praise the Lord but I will say this I've
[1:54:30] been bad at this but H if you uh want
[1:54:36] your birthday

[1:54:39] birthday so uh I barely know my own but
