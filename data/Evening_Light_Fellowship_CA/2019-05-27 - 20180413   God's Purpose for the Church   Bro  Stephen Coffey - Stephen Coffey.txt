[Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] praise the Lord Amen god bless just hey man and thank the Lord for his presence a man is good to have our brother sister Kirsten amen but it's better to have Jesus no offense and I'm sure you're not offended and trust that you brought Jesus with you hey man glad to have again our brother Chad with us and the family and of course sister Lily praise the Lord or bless her a man and I I thought I was looking at it and I said yeah I said that's brother cater sitting there a man I guess he'd be pretty old now very old but our brother looked like him from behind there and so we welcomed our brother cater hey man so it's good so it's going back in time a lot but again God ordained it god predestinated it God knew about it a man so we thank the Lord for it praise the name of the Lord and so we welcome of course our brother Stephen coffee and sister Sarah a man I think she was here and when the family was here yes I remember so god bless her it's nice to have her with us and our brother Stephen to minister the word so we're trusting that God is going to minister to us what we need that has been that's been my prayer and as I've thought about it our brother coming to minister and since he's been here I've been praying Lord I said I pray you anoint him and I said what will come forth will be what we need and again it's what we need not as a group but as individuals a man that God is going to minister to you as a son and daughter by the grace of God and on over all as the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ so the grace of God I pray to be with our brother Stephen amen we appreciate his ministry when he was here the last time and we're and we know that we're going to appreciate the ministry again and again we're believing that it's not brother Steven coffee it's the Holy Ghost it is Christ in the form of the Holy Ghost praise the name of the Lord he wouldn't leave us he wouldn't forsake us a man I trust you don't think that's because he meets my physical needs no he's here to meet our spiritual needs a man and then according to the spiritual you bless you physically a man that's his promised in his word so praise God for the for the Ministry of the word and let's appreciate it let's feed on it let's hunger and thirst because the hour is coming when it's going to it's going to fade away it's going to pass away oh yeah the hour is coming when when when we won't be allowed to minister what we're ministering we won't be allowed to preach what we're preaching not by any means our brother Stephen won't be allowed to travel and minister and what he preaches so we pray the grace of God that we're going to appreciate what we hear tonight amen that it's going to it's going to do what God has ordained it to do and God has ordained Ian to do and what is that and that is to increase our faith a man and nun and just increase our faith is to make sure that we have the faith that pleases God amen that our brothers going to minister that word and faith comes by hearing the word and I trust we're hearing in our souls not in our heads Amen by the grace of God and the faith comes by hearing the word on the inside of the inside amen in your soul not in your head you can hear it all with your with your natural ears but let him better than hear nine tears God's not interested in your ears he's interested only in the ear of the soul that in that I wasn't here hear what the Spirit is saying amen let him that I've been here and hear I hear what the Spirit is going to say tonight through our brother Steven amen thank God for bringing the brother our way amen and what I will look forward to his ministry again in the future and as the Lord leads amen and we'll pray for our brother Steven and for sister Sarah as becoming a part of the ministry a man it's a tremendous challenge a man and it'll become more more a reality of course as they get older and the longer that they are in the ministry so God God's grace to them is my prayer and for me it's been over fifty years a long time it's hard to believe you know that I was taught I was talking and ministry to brethren that words that were in the in the ministry for 50 years and more now they're gone now we're taking their place a man see exactly what the Prophet said you young ministers he says got to take our place and he's you got to take this message on to the coming of the Lord by the grace of God onto the revelation of his coming for his right praise the name of the Lord so god bless you I want you to stand we're gonna sing only believe as our brother Steven comes to to the minister of the word of God amen this is not a Creed this is the word in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God a man so he'll get himself out of the way and it'll be Christ in our brother Steven and he be ministering to his sons and daughters praise the name of the Lord not not just natural human beings with spiritual amen now that I come from this hospital or that era that womb were that womb we come from the womb of the word by the grace of God amen we are new creatures in Christ Jesus and then and that's why that's what he's looking at he's that new creature and that's why our brother has come tonight the Lord has brought our brother for the minister to that new creature in Christ amen because that's the one that needs the word that's the one that needs the faith and his own real thirsting for it to get us out of time and into eternity so the grace of God be with us amen this thing only believed as our brother comes and being prayer for him and for one another to receive the word hear what the Spirit is saying to the bright amen amen Oh Oh [Music] all things are possible Oh Oh [Applause] thank you amen [Music] Jesus yes [Music] thank you Jesus thank you Jesus all kinds of the resurrection the labs or the change [Applause] yes way [Music] man Wow jeez [Music] [Music] [Applause] grace and the name Jesus Christ [Music] [Applause] lord I be [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Hey look let's do all this evening how are you good to be in the house the Lord tonight isn't it are you happy to be here I sure am happy to be here I flew a long way to be here so I guess I should be happy I really am happy to be in church I'm always happy to be in church in the presence of the Lord and we're certain that the presence of the Lord is here tonight you believe that a man you can have your seats thank you musicians for the beautiful music we appreciate our musicians don't we song service would be pretty awkward without musicians we're thankful for him you know what why you're standing I'd like to invite you to turn with me to the book of second Peter if you would and I'll let's read a scripture before before you can be seated there I'd like to read 2nd Peter chapter 3 and I'd like to read a portion of Scripture there 2nd Peter chapter 3 and let's start at verse 3 knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lusts and obviously when we know that wouldn't we hear the word do we see the words the last days that means now and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the father's fell asleep all of these things continue as they were from the beginning of creation for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the Word of God the heavens were of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water whereby the world that was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the earth which are now by the same word are kept in store reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men but beloved be not ignorant of this one thing that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years and a thousand years as one day and the Lord is not slack concerning his promise as something count slackness but is long-suffering to us-ward in other words he is not slow in fulfilling his promise he's not he's not out of kilter with what he said it to be his time he's not slow he's got it right on according it to his time but his long-suffering to us-ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night and the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with a fervent heat and the earth also in the world's and there in the works that are therein shall be burned up seeing them that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of persons ought you to be in all holy conversation and godliness looking for the hastening to the coming of the day of God wherein the heavens being fire and shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt with fervent heat nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and new earth wherein dwelleth white righteousness wherefore beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you may found of him in peace without spot and blameless let's pray gracious Heavenly Father we are so thankful for this place to come in and worship you we are so thankful for your love and for your mercy and the grace that you have extended to us the Lord it is by that grace that we all stand in this room tonight we say that we believe in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it is upon the same grace and faith that we accept that blood that was shed on our on our behalf and we stand here and put our hands in the blood of Jesus Christ and say Lord if not for grace where would we be and so Lord tonight I pray that you would bind our hearts and our minds together on the basis of your word and nothing less the basis of your word and if there be any need tonight if there need any encouragement that anybody needs any instruction any guidance anything Lord we know that you can give it and so I give myself into your hands and I ask that we would all give ourselves into your hands the best way that we know how and that you would have your way and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray this amen and amen you can be seated thank you well it is uh again wonderful to be here tonight and it's wonderful to be with you and it's been a long time since the last time I was here the last time I was here I was an unmarried single man as my father would say suave debonair independently wealthy and now I'm married and I hope have all of that and a wife so I I'm very thankful for my wife and I'm very thankful that she loves to travel and she comes with me and I think behind every good man there's a good woman in my case I just have a good woman but I'm very thankful for and I'm very very thankful that we could both come and be with you and I hope that this weekend is I hope this weekend will be a blessing to you I'm not a very good not a very good minister but the few fish and a few loaves that I have I'll just give it into the hands of Jesus and I think that who can do wonders wonders with it if if we allow him and your 50% of the of the gift and I can put all that I have into his hands but unless you are willing to receive it and it's just gonna sit there and I think it'd be a shame for us to come out of this weekend with with the Lord still having things in his hand that he would would have given us if we would just have pulled so it's nothing that's nothing in me it's you that's gonna receive and I believe that so we move ourselves out of the way and we allow the Holy Spirit to move and I think that he'll speak to you I really believe that and no matter what it is or no matter how odd it is I was moved a little bit different than I normally am and that you may hear things that I've said before but I was moved in a little bit of a different direction this this this weekend for some reason and I I hope that it'll be a blessing to you and I'm not saying it to anybody I don't preach like that I don't don't preach at people I preach to people and I preach with people because many times are preaching to myself but I just would ask you to pull and we'll see how the Lord moves and whatever I say it's because it's on my heart to say it's not directed to anybody or anything like that I think that's the way it should be done what I'm thankful to be here and my family sends you greetings by the berry from Hickory Bible Tabernacle sends you greetings and he we came from 80 degree weather I guess about 30 degrees here 25 Celsius so um you can't have it we're going back to it you can keep what you have but all the saints down there in Hickory and the southeast and they send their greetings and they said to say hello and the family dearly loves you and they all wish they could be here they all really they're really jealous when I say I'm going to new flame I'm going to preach and they say man I wish I was really going with you they they wish they could come so thankful for that thankful for the hospitality the wonderful hospitality oh brother Matt his family and the paul and thankful for that good to meet brother cars from the sisters sharing this afternoon we had some great fellowship good time together and I hope to meet all of you if I haven't and uh but I think I think I will and let's let's give it a shot anyways and I love you for each and every one of you know I'm very thankful to be here I just want to say - I'm very thankful for brother Paul and I don't know if you know this or not it because it might not get get said here but the our daily strength devotionals that are out there those are those those would not be in existence if it wasn't for brother Paul and I don't know if you know how much of a big of a part he plays in it but he's the one who coordinates all of the efforts of the entire team in order for that to get out and those those affect have affected the lives of tens of thousands of people all across the world all over the place and it's sound it's nothing do to anyone man but it's a it's a group effort and brother Paul is largely in part that that is the reason it sits in existence so I'm really really thankful for brother Paul in his his willingness to participate in that and give it freely of his time you know we don't we don't make any money off of it and he gives that but he volunteers his time for that so I'm very thankful for that and if you use that you should pat him on the back and say thank you so uh very thankful for that well let's get into the word that's what we're here for you know I was reading this passage of Scripture a while back and it really pressed upon my heart and I've spoken from this passage of Scripture before but maybe maybe we can look at it in a different light and I want to kind of go through three different topics throughout the weekend we'll see how the Lord leads but I want to start with this and I kind of want to bring us all on the same page and I kind of want to start from this scripture and he's saying this this has affected me very much so I was thinking about brother Adam on the way up and after I was reading this I was thinking about brother Adam and I can remember as a small child about eight years old seven somewhere along the lines of that we lived in Logan Ohio and it was it got pretty cold there but it was a January day and a member of the church there that my father had pastored had had a fire in the house and we had heard about it and then the family packed up the we packed up the van and we drove out to their house and I remember coming over there was a field behind their house and they had a beautiful just a regular home there not very big but a regular home and you kind of came up over a hill and then their house was there and then the field and we went over there quite often but then we went this one time they said they had a fire I didn't hear anything else about it but I remember just as a small child going up over the top of the hill and going and cresting the top of the hill and all you could see was the field the house was burned completely to the ground and there was there was nothing left in the house not one single possession that had was was left and I remember thinking as a small child this it I guess it just dawned on me for the first time you have that experience as a child but it just dawned on me for the first time that this life really isn't lasting because it's the first time I'd ever seen anything like that something someone's entire life just gone and this was the case for this family and they had to start from scratch there was nothing that they had left in the world there was nothing and they got out with their lives and that was it and I began to think about brother Adam and all that his family is going through and then I was thinking of this scripture and Paul says he Peter in his second letter here he's saying to them seeing that all these things are going to be dissolved anyways seeing that they're all going to be gone anyways and they're gonna the the earth itself is going to melt with fervent heat seeing that this is all the case then what what kind of a people ought we to be because he's saying this now to the people who are in the last days in the last days scoffers shall come and they shall be saying well where's the promise of his coming and then he says he goes on to say well seeing all these things are going to happen in the last days then what kind of people should we be he says what manner of people ought ye to be and he says and in if you look at it in the different versions it says that what manner of people are you to be in a holy conversation and godliness and what that means is what what kind of people should you be in a pattern of Christian living that sets you apart in your daily living so what kind of a daily pattern should you be what kind of a person should you be in in that time not just in church or around believers but what kind of a pattern should you set what should we be all of this is going to be dissolved all that we see is going to be gone so knowing that that all of this is going to happen what kind of people should we be brother Branham he says in 1950 I know my Redeemer liveth he says see God has a purpose and he says he had everything working to that purpose and all today no matter how indifferently seemed to be at times and how strange things goes and how church gets in this condition and in that condition it's all in the divine prompt purpose of God to mold us and make us in his own way he says all of that we see no matter what the church gets into this condition or to that condition or which way you see the bride going or which way you see yourself going personally he says it's all working according to the purpose the divine purpose of God God has a purpose in all of this we see it in in Jeremiah 29:11 he has a plan to prosper you and and he cares about you and he knows exactly where you're at he's got a purpose for you in 1965 for the random he says this rapture which is coming to pass and anything that God has in in in the line of his word there's always something going to come and upset that if they can and it's Satan's purpose to do that you see God has a purpose for your life and we hear that well often but then we also know that Satan has a purpose and his purpose is to thwart the plan of God so as the plan of God is working in perfect coherence with His Word and perfect coherence with his thoughts that were in the beginning Satan is right there to try to disrupt that any way that he can and we know that in the last state he'll do that in ways that are so close to the elect that it we are so close to the truth that it would deceive the elect if possible so we have the overarching plan of God and purpose of God that is not working out just for the bride itself but it's working out in your life as well and you have to believe that but you also have to believe and you cannot discount that Satan has a purpose as well to thwart that purpose of God so he's working in tandem and he's a step behind the purpose of God in your life and you have to believe those two things the objective for the believer is is not so much to understand in in place the details of God's purpose as it is to surrender to the leading of the Holy Spirit to work out his purpose within your life it's not so much for us to be able to grasp the doctrine and to understand it and to place it ourselves as it is for us to surrender to the Holy Spirit so that he can place it according to his purpose and plan when we get it the other way around we mess ourselves up and we mess everything else and we allow Satan an avenue to get in there and to work his purpose in your life you have to understand it's not your ability to place it and to to line everything up even doctrinally or figure everything out in your life you're not always going to be able to do that it is more important that you surrender to the leading of the Holy Spirit because sons and daughters are led by the Spirit of God so we have to surrender to that and allow the purpose of God to work in our lives rather than try to figure out and place everything that is going to happen both doctrinally and personally it's just going to get you in heap of trouble I think it would be good then for us to go just just as we start out this series of beatings I think it would be good to go all the way back to the beginning and just kind of lay things out though so that we can see our place in God's purpose because we have a ministry that has allowed us to step back from it all and to see it laid out so we don't have to place it anymore we have to just surrender to the leading of the Holy Spirit and as we step back from from the whole span of time that we have we can see the Holy Spirit placing things in order so that we can see our place in the span of time so that we can see who we are in Christ and what he was doing from the very start to the very finish and when we when we better understand what God is doing through that way through the leading of the Holy Spirit and by revelation in him placing us into that by by his revelation to us rather than trying to figure it out then we can better grasp what we are to do in the present so when we when we understand the the the span of time as a whole according to the revelation of that God has given us then we can better place ourselves in the present moment isn't that right it gives us the ability when we when we understand the larger pictures by submitting ourselves to the Holy Spirit then it gives us the ability to more clearly grasp the present and to more clearly live it with a delivered with abandon and to live it with a courage and to live it with a fearless determination that God's purpose will take take precedence in our life because God has a purpose but Satan also has a purpose so far greater is it for us just to surrender to his leading so that he can place us into his purpose and allow us to see it from start to finish in the very beginning of time now I believe I read this exact same quote the last time I was here but I'll read it again because it's great 1963 in crisis and mystery of God revealed one of my favorite services and I find myself going back to it and I I don't even I I find myself coming back to John chapter 1 and crisis and mystery of God revealed and I kind of wish part of me could just get beyond that but I can't it just keep I keep going back to it and I think well rapture out of here before I get out of it but in 1963 he says this which which has which blew my mind the first time I heard it and it continues to do so God's plan he says it was first to express himself completely God in Christ second to have the preeminence by this in his church which is his body the bride till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them all right and thirdly to restore the kingdom to it's rightly position it fell by sin in the first Adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people and talked with them and fellowship with him in the very beginning there was God there was God it was just him and then his brother branham explains it in the in the co D book and a couple other places he says out of that came the Sun there was a little halo of light a little a little light and it came out in in John 1:18 it says and in Christ was Jesus was in the bosom of the Father it came from God everything that was in God was poured into the son and everything that that was was in God's mind everything that God was he pulled it from his very own heart that is why Christ is the heart of God is because he pulled it from his very own bosom and that became Christ that became the Godhead and it pleased the father that in him should all the fullness dwell so everything that God was was now in Christ we know that to be very true I doubt I'll say anything that you haven't heard before but like Peter says I bring you into remembrance of these things so I'm just gonna preach what's on my heart everything that God was was then poured into him Christ and everything that he everything that that that was and that is was brought into existence by him all things were created by him and for him and it was not God at the beginning it was Christ that God poured himself into and everything that God was it came down and it was that that brooded over the face of the earth which was just a void so the spoken word was the original seed and he spoke something and it came to existence everything that we see everything that was was brought into existence by him it was nothing less so as the the the the the world was there in in in all of its void the scripture says in Isaiah 55 my words shall not return unto me void without having something in it without having accomplished what it was set out to accomplish so the word was there in the beginning because God was the word and the Word was God so he was there in the beginning and then the the earth was there with all of the potential in it to bring out the seeds of the oak trees and the pine trees and everything that was inside of it it was laying there with the potential to produce all of that and it was the Holy Spirit that came down and brooded over the face of the earth it was the same Christ that God poured himself into everything that was in that net debt brought forth life was because Christ came down and brooded over top of it and the life came out of it it had to lay in the presence of the Sun in order for it to bring out its potential it's the exact same way at the beginning as it is right now it's the exact same God and he came down and he brooded over the face of the earth and he created everything that was now everything that he created was for him because the earth was the Lord's footstool now at that time in the very beginning after there was there was nothing but just him in all of his existence he poured himself into Christ and then everything that we see everything that was on the earth was brought into existence by the person of the Lord Jesus Christ and he brooded over that any product into existence for himself and then as we go down through the days of creation we see that he he had the plants and the animals and everything that was and he molded them and shape them into existence and then he created man and he built man and formed man in his own image and at that point in time it was it was in the mind of God now if we could look at this it says and just for the sake of time I'll read it he says in 1965 in Satan's Eden now that's the way God was in the beginning every son of God and every daughter of God was in God at the beginning you don't remember it now but you were there he noted and he wanted you to become so he could contact you speak with you love you and shake your hands so he says you are with God at the beginning so he created man and if you go back in Genesis and uh if you look at it he created man in his own image created hehe male and female and then he creates Adam so he had the the spirit the theophany and he had that that image of you before before the foundation of the world and then he creates Adam specifically out of the dust of the earth so he creates mankind and that's when you were in God at the very beginning you were with him before the foundation of the world and you were in God's mind then you have to believe that because he says you don't remember it so you're believing something that you don't remember so what you're doing is you're walking on water as many times where you say oh well we've got to come out you've got a step out in faith you're already stepped out in faith your ass your your way of what you're looking back at the boat is what you're doing you're already on the water because of what you believe and where you stand in your faith against culture and everything that you are you you have been walking on water since your ascending oh there goes so don't think for a minute that you have to step out on to the water you're on the water you just have to keep your eyes on Christ he says you were there with him before the foundation of the world even though you don't remember it you need to believe it whether or not you remember it or not that's where you were in Christ and then he creates Adam and we know that Adam manot male and female everything that the woman was and that the man was was in in one in the same so it wasn't two separate beings it was one male and female in one being Adam so he created him in his own image now what he did is that he realized that that man was alone and he says what I'm gonna do is he needs fellowship because he was created in God's image so the reason that God created heaven was because he wanted to fellowship with Adam Adam needed fellowship because he was created in God's image so he pulled from Adam of a rib and he created Eve and so the two had fellowship now what was created then was perfect it was heaven if you were to ask every single person in this room what is heaven like to you you'd probably each one of you have a different image you'd have a different idea of what heaven is whether on this earth or something out of this earth you you have some kind of an idea some of you have a beach some of you have Florida some of you have the beach with Newfoundland you know kind of a half and a half between Florida and and Newfoundland which actually turns out to be North Carolina but you have some sort of an idea of what heaven is everybody has that you have a different theory or a different thought of what heaven is this was heaven God created heaven and he came down and he brooded over the face of the deep and everything that was in heaven came up because of him it was the Lord's footstool it was the Lord's Dominion and that was not a million miles off somewhere that was on this earth it was here and so many times we forget that fact heaven was right here it wasn't a million miles away it wasn't on some other earth it wasn't on earth two or three it was on this earth it was heaven it was harmony and God could come down and commune with his people and have fellowship with him like he intended it to be before the foundation of the world that is what he wanted with you that is what he wanted with Adam and Eve and that's what he had it was perfect Communion and fellowship and relationship with them you cannot have a fellowship with someone until you have a relationship with them fellowship is a sharing of interests and a sharing of activity and things like that relationship is a share shared knowledge and shared interaction so I can't fellowship with you until first I get to know you I know your name I shake your hand I say hallo brother how are you doing and then we begin to talk then we can go and have an experience together then we can go fishing or go hunting or something like that and be in fellowship it's the exact same way with God you can't be in fellowship with him until first you have a relationship with him Adam and Eve were brought into relationship with them and they were in fellowship with him this was this was perfect this was everything that God wanted it to be he could he could come down and he could sit on top of the Himalayas and look down over the valleys and say how beautiful this is he could I could you know fly across the American Plains and say how beautiful this is this was God's Dominion the presence of God consumed this earth that we are now standing on it's the exact same one we have this figment of our imagination out there as it was somewhere out there it was right here this was God's Dominion it was his place of fellowship it was his place of communion it was his it was his footstool brother Branham he says in 1965 in Satan's Eden God at one time had the earth under his control he says he set it into its orbit he put it out and then there just skipping down he says finally when he got it all made and finally arrived he put his headquarters on earth in a beautiful spot laying East of Eden called the Garden of Eden and God made the world's headquarters in the Garden of Eden in Egypt right east of the garden was the headquarters and over the whole situation he put his son and his son's wife over all of it that's right and what and that's what God did he put them in full control so he says Adam you have the do over all of the earth he says this is my this is my place and I give it to you everything that we think about of heaven of it being in harmony and unity and and the beauty of it and the majesty of it and then just just that relaxing feeling that we get when we think about heaven that's what it was and it was all right here everything that was so beautiful about God was right here in order to express himself he expressed himself first in Christ so that he could have complete preeminence in the being of the Lord Jesus Christ and then secondly was to express himself through Christ in you and he had that he had expressed himself through Christ because man was was was in dominion over his heaven over his creation everything was there it was a beautiful place but the scripture also says in Isaiah 14 and 12 how art thou o Lucifer who aren't fallen from heaven so there was God but there was also Satan there was God in all of his majesty but then there was also Satan and Satan was set below God but he had all of the the beauty and the qualities that God had given him and he fell and there was a we know from revelations 12 which is actually a very controversial chapter of the Bible but Satan fell from heaven and we know that in Psalms 115 is 16 it says that the heaven even the heavens are the Lord's but the earth he has given unto the children of men the earth and all of that it was and all of its beauty and all of its Majesty was in God's control he gave it to the Dominion of mankind and because mankind wanted to go their own way they forfeited it to Satan so because of the fall because of the the sexual act in the Garden of Eden man forfeited it to Satan so because and and this is the way it's been ever ever since it was the way it was in Israel it's the way it is to now it's the way it is in the hearts of of mankind all across the earth 1952 in God's way that God that's that's been me God's Way that's been made for us he says man has always wanted to make his own way in the Garden of Eden God made man so he didn't have to shift for nothing God made him perfect but man wanted his own way he wanted to tamper and he wanted to find out and as soon as he fell we've we've went through that this week and he's going through the different things in the scripture he made himself a religion and he didn't wait for God to take him to make him one he made himself one God and when we say this often that God we're against the system we're not against the people but God God is is is the the designer of the most intricate and delicate systems that mankind will ever see or ever experienced if you just take the human body alone but you take nature you take the oceans you take the the Stars and everything else and you look at the intricacy of the design and the system that it goes through and even just the body of the human body on a daily basis in the sleep cycle and everything that it goes through it's it's an astley intricate system God is the designer of the most amazing systems you could possibly imagine it's when man makes his own system to put God into that's when we have the trouble and we know that to be the truth but what we need to do then is by surrendering to the Holy Spirit because the sons and daughters of God are led by the Spirit we surrender ourselves to God's system and that system works itself out according to his own word so when we surrender ourselves to the Holy Spirit we allow the Holy Spirit and the Word of God which is the seed we allow the Holy Spirit which is the water to water the seed and it brings out the system of God because there's life in the seed and it can't help anything but just give forth life sister Sarah and I keep a garden because we have 25 degree weather down there and we keep a garden and I love to garden I absolutely love it my grandfather was a gardener my noble uncle was a gardener a man of the soil and I just I loved to garden so III sister Sarah and I were you know hoeing the rows and everything like that and in laying our seed just as humble folk that we are and it just astounds me and in sister amber or sister Kim had done the the tomato seedlings and the in brother Matt sister Amber's kids had their seedlings in they're very healthy plants very fruitful plants and they were growing up in the little seedlings there and it just astounds me that you can and I didn't tell my wife this but I actually we had about ten seedlings there have one kind of a plant and I actually dug one up every two weeks or every two days and I looked at the seed to see if what when what shape it was just because I wanted to see so I dug it up and it's amazing how you water the seed and then you you you look at it and it's just bringing forth life out of nowhere and and all of a sudden now there's a large chute out of the ground out of nothing out of thin air it's a beautiful plant and it goes up to be a beautiful squash plant or tomato plant or whatever it is it's amazing to me there's a system and an underlying law to that Jesus rose because he submitted himself to his own law there was a law of nature there's a law of the earth there's some other law that that that coordinates everything that happens to us there's God's law and and God did not come to diminish the law he came to fulfill the law so when we have when when we subject ourselves to the law of God which the holy spirit operates then we bring forth the same life that was on the inside of us if that seed is inside of us it's as simple as that you committed to the right atmosphere that's what God brings forth out of it it's the light that was on the inside of the seed and that's what God was doing in the beginning was creating the atmosphere that that man exist in then they began to use their own intellectual reasoning and begin to just a debate on the basis of the word and Satan deceived and we know all of the aspects of that and Men forfeited it right there they subjected themselves to their own law instead of the law of God if they would have kept it on Christ would have been there and in Christ was the life of them that was on the inside of them as the tree of life in the Garden of Eden and yet they forfeited it because they wanted to go their own way that was the worst mistake that Israel ever made is because they chose to go their own way instead of submitting themselves to the law of God if the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you it shall also quicken your mortal body and that is not something that is going to happen because we are going to be resurrected we are quickened now so as that spirit that dwells inside of you it quickens your mortal body and it brings you to a place where you are in heavenly places in Christ Jesus right now as you stand and all of the promises of God are there for you to have and to to grab hold of as a carrier of God Himself because the same spirit that raised Jesus Christ from the dead it shall and it has quicken your mortal body you're baptized and born again with the Holy Ghost you will be resurrected you are quickened with him and you are sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus with them right now as you sit mankind wanted to go their own way as a result every siren that you've ever heard has been caused everything that you've ever heard uh-uh-uh-uh-uh and the news of a murder of of a kidnapping of all of these different things of all of the immorality of all of the filth of this world and everything that is in it is because man chose to go his own way it's all the result of men forfeiting the law of God and submitting himself had all his and choosing rather his own direction which is which is is perfectly capable of doing because we are creatures that have the ability to think because we are on the basis of free moral agency hopefully I'll get into that in in another sermon Satan's purpose remember God has a purpose and he has a law that's riding out all of these things but Satan has a purpose as well Satan's purpose from Eden was to make himself his own ledin and exalt himself above so the stars of God would worship Him the sons would worship Him and he has absolutely carried it out now and he's done this and brought it into the church because of the fall we live in in the midst of Satan's II mankind they forfeited God's Eden and the heaven that they were in existence in and all of these all of the things that they had and all the blessings that they experienced they forfeited that and now Satan took preeminence on the earth and it was no longer God's Dominion it was now Satan's Dominion so the Spirit of God literally it stepped back from the earth and it said this is no longer my Dominion it is still his footstool because the scripture says that the earth is the Lord's and it is his footstool and it is it is all his but he stepped back because man chose to go his own way and he allowed Satan an avenue to get into his mind because Eve is no less like like you and me she was no less like you and me she had five avenues to the spirit realm and it was that that that Satan got to and messed with and caused the fall it's the exact same thing with you and me and so Satan because God lifted off of the earth and said this is no longer my Dominion Satan moved in there and grabbed a hold of it so then it became Satan's Dominion it was no longer gods it was no longer heaven heaven and earth were completely and horrendously ripped apart because before all of that heaven and earth were one in the same it was from the beginning it says that God created a harmony and everything that was was in existence perfect unity and harmony with God man with in fellowship with him it was heaven and earth back like a same there was no heaven up there and earth down there there was no difference in dimension Dominion necessarily it was it was God himself and it was the earth and it was it was the Lord's Dominion it was everything in one just like God wanted it to be and then swim man forfeited that by using their own intellect and by using their own reasoning and everything like that not that we shouldn't use your own reasoning in our own intellect we bring it to God as it says in Isaiah let us come together and reason together you bring all the intellect and wit that you have to to believe in him there's so many people who say well you're blindly believing in faith no we're not belong to believing I know exactly what I'm believing in and I have more certainty of that than I do of this and I have faith in that and that's how I have faith in the in the unfailing realities of God which is a greater reality than what I have because this will fade away that will not so I'd rather put my faith in something that I am certain of that lifts me from from what I can see to what I am in living by faith and when we do that we lift off of the present world and the present troubles and we leave it all behind because we're in heavenly places in Christ Jesus we are putting ourselves by faith into the Lord Jesus Christ himself so you lift above all of the things in and then you're not any longer walking by what you see you're walking by faith we do not walk by things that are seen but we walk by the unseen and when a man of forfeited that heaven and earth were just ripped apart and now it was no longer heaven on earth it was Satan's Eden it was Satan's Dominion and he moved down into the hearts of men and he caused Cain to kill Abel and he caused all of these different things it was Satan's Dominion that has not changed since that time we are still living in the midst of Satan's Eden we're still here it's this earth now all that we see in all that time has allowed us to create we have created for ourselves so we look at ourselves in this existence we walk by and the vast majority of the world walks by the scene what they can see with their senses but God did not give man the senses to contact God with he gave them faith to contact God with and so many times especially with young people they get that mixed up and they try to contact God with their fleshly senses with the five senses and then when they try to do that they can't reach God they create their own religion which is what Saint wanted to do back in the very beginning so with the senses we try to reach out to God because it's in us to worship a God because that's what we were created to do we were created for fellowship so we try to create something and we we conjure up sign of a vegetable offering to offer him and to give to him and that is what what is innately India in us to do but that was not the way God intended it to be that's why he gave us faith to contact the heavenly realm but we are in the midst of Satan's eating and now here we are according to the scripture that we can see in Laodicea so what what happened now is that God wanted to have fellowship and we see from Christ as a mystery of God revealed the three purpose of God isn't it wonderful to say yeah there's three and three things that God had in his purpose you think of the complexity of the scripture it's so simple God is not simple God is the most complex thing you'll ever even comprehend and you'll never be able to fully comprehend him he's complex he's not simple at all he wraps himself in simplicity and he reveals himself in a it's so beautiful to me we try to make it so complex the worst thing that you can do is make it complex it's so simple to me so everything that that that that was was ripped apart there was no way for man to get back into fellowship because the law was set in place because there was a law that God had he wanted to see the blood and it was my revelation now man couldn't could not have received the revelation of that by their own ability God had to give it to them so Abraham Moses all of the men from that time until Jesus came every man had to have a revelation directly from God God had to tell them this is what I want you to do you must do it or else you will forfeit your your covenant with you in order to receive the Covenant you've got to into a circumcise you've got to do this in order to have this there was always something there was a condition there that had to be met because that's the way God works he says you've got to do this there's a consequence to this you know I've put you on the basis of free more agency but there's a consequence to choosing wrong and we reap the consequences of our decisions so there was no way for a man to get back to God because it was it was forfeited for us to get back into that fellowship now we could have a relationship with him and we Moses himself was called the friend of God God came down and communed with him and was there with him and the presence of God was it amazes me the presence of God Himself was down on the mountain it was the presence of God was on that mountain and then people they couldn't even look at the mountain it was so strong and they said Moses you talked to God because we did we can't even look at the mountain they would die if any animal touch the mountain they died and in law and Moses walked right up into the midst of it he walked right into the raw power of Almighty God that was on that mountain he had he had a relationship with God but there was no way for them to come back into complete fellowship with God because they forfeited it so the blood of bulls and goats go it would bring a recompense of sin they could not afford fit that they could not shake that it was just it was - it's just not able to be done in the Old Testament we see that the Lord established from the first Bible the heavens he established the temple the temple changed everything because there was no way for God to commune with his people and for his people to come and commune with him unless they sit unless he specifically came down to them and said you do this and you'll you'll reap this so he came to Abraham and he says you get you and your family and these people and you do this and you're circumcised and I'll come down to you and you'll have an everlasting covenant with me and to your seed your spiritual seed when the temple came God told Moses to place the temple in the place all of the ordinances and you want to talk about a system there was no system like the temple everything had to be in perfect order everything had to be placed exactly like God wanted it the the the the priest had to wear this particular garment he couldn't wear this you couldn't touch that he couldn't do this he couldn't say that he had to have this type of blood this kind of animal it was it was crazy can you imagine worshipping like that but he allowed this in order for the the offering that he required to be met I'm trying to make it as simple as possible now because this can get really complex he set in order a way for man to commune with him so he set the way for the blood to be paid so that the man could stand atone for his sin because man had forfeited at the garner vini and God had only allowed certain people that he revealed to to receive that blessing of the Covenant and to come back into that relationship he sent forth the order and the in the way of the temple so that man could come back into fellowship with him because when you brought your offering and when you went through the process that the temple had in the wilderness then you were then back in communion with God because you were brought back into a fellowship that was on the basis of the blood of the of the lamb and and the the doves and all of the things that you sacrificed you were fellowshipping with God through the temple so now they were atone for their sin for their healing they were redeemed by their per their practice of faith in the temple I doubt there was anybody or I'm sure there were but the the process of the temple had to be done by faith it was not something that you could just do and just get by with it God still looked on the heart of man Samuel said that even before there was the what there was he says God looks on the heart of man and you're looking on the countenance of it God still looked on the heart of a man back in that day so it was no less like it like it is now God still looks at your heart and he has always looked at the heart of man so God allowed by faith he allowed them to place their faith in the blood of that lamb and when they brought it and it was sacrificed then they were redeemed and they were brought into a fellowship with Christ through the process of the temple heaven and earth came back together again through the temple because now God could come down and commune from the Holy of Holies he could stand in there and the priests could come in and put the blood and then on the day of atonement and the whole camp was atone for their sin and for their healing so now heaven and earth were brought back together in the temple that was only a foreshadow of as we know Christ when Christ came heaven and earth came back together again because it was the fullness of the Godhead bodily not now him having a relationship with his people it was now him inside of his people because Christ came down and the blood of Jesus Christ was shed and because of the cross everything that we had forfeited was now brought back together in the person of the Lord Jesus Christ now the amazing thing about this and this is what I want you to see in 1965 it is the rising of the Sun the spirit left him in the Garden of Gethsemane he had to die a man friends he didn't have to do that that was God God anointed that flesh which was human flesh he allowed himself to be submitted to the law that was overriding him Jesus had the power he said in John 4 the Aaron McGarry said this at the men's meeting and this is amazing to me he says Jesus had the power to raise up and to put down yet he could have risen himself from the dead but he chose not to he chose to submit himself to the Holy Spirit and the word is what rose him from the dead because the word said I shall not allow my Holy One to see corruption so he didn't have to do anything the law that was overriding him that's what that's what rose him from the dead all he had to do was submit himself to the leading of the Holy Spirit which was inside of him even though he had the authority and the power to raise himself up and to put himself back down and to raise himself up again and yet he chose to surrender himself to the Father which was inside of him because all of the all that the father was was in Christ and Christ was made flesh and dwelt among us the word the logos everything that God was came back together in heaven and earth were overlapping now it's not heaven on earth again they overlapped in the form of Jesus Christ so it was not this is not heaven on earth this is not the Millennium this is not what we're experiencing like that this was just an overlapping of heaven and earth he says if he if he didn't if he de went up there as God he'd have never died that kind of a death you can't kill God but he didn't have to do it but remember he went there with you in him by listening to me he went there with you in him see he had never separated the bride from the groom he came down to people and he says this is what I want you to do and this is the Covenant that you must do to have fellowship with me through the temple they could offer their sacrifice and they could they could lay their faith in the blood of Jesus of the Lamb and then they would be atone for their sin that was their Redemption when Jesus Christ came he hadn't broke God had not broken himself up from groom and bride yet he was one in the same just like God created Adam in his own image he was male and female together when Jesus was on the cross he was male and female together because it was the fullness of the Godhead bodily so even though you were in the fray mind of God before the foundation of the world he went back into Christ was the Holy Ghost down through the ages Jehovah of the Old Testament Jesus of the new the Holy Ghost down throughout all of the ages so he was in Jesus Christ the person of the Lord Jesus Christ there which is the beauty of the Godhead he was Jesus Christ the Word made flesh he where he was the word and everything that God was was poured into Christ and then he became flesh now all that was in God was he in the Sun because the the the he said when you have seen the father you have seen me because I am the father are one so everything that God was was he in Jesus Christ he hadn't separated the male from the female yet so because and you say well then how could I been in the foundation of the world if I was in Christ because he was Christ in the before the foundation of the world it was God that created you in his own mind and then it was God that stepped into flesh and heaven and earth overlapped again in the form of Jesus Christ at that moment in time you are on the cross with him this brings a greater understanding of Galatians 2:20 when it says I was crucified with Christ it is no longer I that live when you are born again in your barrier baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you have you stepped into him you stepped into that long line of eternity that never had a beginning and they will never have an end so when Christ was on the cross you were there because it was all in one and then when he in it he goes on to say he says so when God looked down upon the body of Christ he saw both male and female and it was all redeemed in that one body so when you step into Christ Jesus today and he received the baptism of the Holy Spirit then you are stepping into that same eternity that same stream of life that was there on the cross and it was there before the foundation of the world he hadn't broken it up yet so when he ascended on high and he came back there were little licks inand in tongues of fire on all the different people he broke himself up into a mini membered pride and then that little that seed that was on the inside of you that God placed there the Holy Spirit came down and then the two became one and then the life came up out of you that's exactly what happened to Peter that's exactly what happened to you and me it's got to happen in the life of every single believer if you profess to be a believer heaven and earth has overlapped inside of you because it was Christ and it was Christ that was on the cross and it was that it was in the temple that heaven and earth overlapped that God could commune with his people and have fellowship with him once again and it was in Jesus Christ said that went on the cross that the same was so heaven and earth overlapped it says in uh in 1st Corinthians 3:16 he says dude do you and I don't have it he says do you know that you are the temple of God that your body is a temple for the Lord you are the temple so now having an earth overlapped in the form of Jesus Christ but when you stepped into Christ then heaven and earth overlapped in you so that is why grace is now here on the earth is because you are here so this is still Satan's Eden but heaven and earth are overlapping inside of every single one of his believers because Jesus Christ is alive today you are alive because he lives we live and it's because that heaven and over in an earth overlapped that you are still here that the earth is still here that grace is still on the earth is because you and Christ are made one in one flesh you are flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone and because he was the same on the cross that the propitiation for our sins was paid and then you step into that and all you have to do is to surrender yourself to the law that for rides you there's nothing else you have to do that's why it's not of works lest any man should boast it is by fears by grace that through faith in Jesus Christ you are saved so when you step into that stream of eternity you are heaven and earth overlapping right as we sit that is how you can be quickened out of this mortal body right as we speak remember you're going to be resurrected you are quickened right now if the same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead raised him up and it will quicken your malla body just as like he did it's the same thing that happens when you are healed it's the same thing that that happens when you are saved isn't that beautiful heaven and earth overlaps in the temple of God and you are the temple of God he's a mini member Godhead in in a mini member he's a mini member the Godhead in the bride 19:55 and Joe the doormats laid out the welcome mat tonight God's plan of redemption through the Opera offering up of the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ once for all to cleanse the guilty unworthy sinner and to bring him into reconciliation with God and restore him back into the Garden of Eden with his wife and his loved ones never to die no more never to be sick never to be to have a heartache or to be a funerals or no more graves to be dug Oh God no more weary no more nothing it's all over washed in the blood of the Lamb with his perfect assurance that Jesus Christ once come under his blood were safe from the Angel of Death it cannot touch us Romans 3:25 whom God hath set for them for to be a propitiation for through the faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of God to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be the that he might be just and the justifier of him which believe believeth in Jesus I don't know if anything that's more amazing than that when I when I go over seas which I don't go often and you know there's a lot of people they say they go overseas and yeah I'm doing a work in doing a work in Africa you know we're going over there we're doing it we're doing a great work I'm going over here and I'm you know we're seeing great success we're doing a lot of work well yeah but I kind of don't like to say that and I don't like I don't believe that because I go over and many times the countries that I go to anyways they look up to culture or they look up to the the gray-headed one so the the guy who is the oldest and the guy who has the most children he's the one that gets this respect and he's the one that gets the authority given to him so me a young fella coming in and in preaching to him I have to be very careful and I have to be very diplomatic in a way that I approach them because they can just say well who are you to be telling us what what you think but the more and more I go overseas I realized that we're just spreading the gospel so that people can catch it and then they're the ones that do the work in the country it's not us that comes back to say well we're doing a great work in this country in this country no no you just went brought the gospel they're the ones that are doing the work they're the ones that live there every day we're the ones that go through the hardships of Laodicea and where we live they go through the hardships of layer to see it and there and where they live we're just going over to be an encouragement however when we when we go I always find that when you're introducing the message to people who have never believed the message before I always like to say listen I'm not selling you anything I've got good news this stuff is great this is good stuff hear me out and then you'll begin to just explain it and just say no this is what happened now this is um this is what I believe according to the scripture now this is why half of the denominational world doesn't believe that then I'll go through the history and everything like that and lay it out and then there they have to make their own decision you can't convince anybody of the of the truth you can't give somebody a revelation God has to do that you just have to go and be the body that God can give it to them through so I find myself more and more saying this is not this is not and especially more so as people are leaving the message and we encounter more people who are coming against it I find myself saying what what do you think you're leaving if you think you're leaving a man-made religion where brother branham is is the centerpiece of it and then everything else stems off from that then you you missed the whole thing what did you even think you were in this whole thing is the revelation of Jesus Christ to you personally that's the message to me and when I go overseas I'm not speaking well where we want you to come into our faith we want you to come into our religion you're doing more harm than you are good what you need to do is say I have good news God is sending out a message in this last day and it's that you are or you can sit in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and you are made alive and there's nothing you have to do except to submit yourself to the Holy Spirit this is what the Holy Spirit is this is how you surrender yourself this good news its grace why is it that zerubabbel the only thing that he could say to the headstone as it descended down on top of the pyramid is grace grace unto it is because it's nothing less but the grace of God that has submitted itself to you and given you the opportunity to see who you are in Jesus Christ that's what the message is to me it's not something that you are simulating - it's God that you get into and it's an individual affair it's not the church that doesn't end collectively it's in the individual that God comes to it's in the individual that having an earth overlap because Jesus Christ himself is inside of you that's why that's that's that's the good news that we have that's the gospel in it's good news it's not something that we should be ashamed to say it's not something that we should be ashamed to share you should say hey man this is this is good stuff this is awesome and this is where I'm at in my life you show me something better and I'll come and follow it heaven and earth overlaps inside of you isn't that the most amazing thing right now you are sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus the problem is is that you've got to go to work Monday morning so you get up and you go back out into Laodicea and you face the world that is without and so that the mind can be some cook become so bogged down with all the different cares of this life which are necessary we wish they weren't but they are necessary and it behooves us just to step back and say it was Christ in the beginning and because God had separated male from the female yet when Jesus was on the cross I was crucified with him and when you place yourself into the blood of Jesus Christ and you see yourself you see your identification in there that is what God is looking for and to me that is the baptism of the Holy Spirit is when you see your identification in that when Peter before he went out to the gate beautiful he was there in the upper room and he they caught the revelation when he before this he was saying people came up to a Peter and he said do you know do you know Jesus Jesus I thought I saw you with him he's like no I don't even know who he is go away from me I don't even know who he was he was ashamed he was embarrassed of it not any it not because of any ill-will he just didn't know how to react he didn't have an identification of what was going on in what had preceded as a result of that of the time it was only after he received the baptism of the Holy Spirit in the upper room that he and John were walking through the up to the gate beautiful and they were walking along and they were going in the temple to preach and they had just saved 3000 Souls and they came up and they were walking in and the guy says alms alms for the poor can you can you give me something and Peter looks at him and I love what the scripture says it says John and Peter fastening their eyes upon upon it they looked and you can just see Peter and he's there and he says and he looks at John and the scripture says he looks back he says listen pal I don't have any money but such as I have I'll give it to you do you see the difference as before you were saying no I don't I don't know he didn't have an identification as to who he was but after that he says I've got something that I can give to you this is now what I possess as a result of having the revelation having the identification of the baptism of the Holy Spirit so I know who I am now and I know that he'll do the same for you because I am a part of him you can be a part of him also so he had the identification and that's what allowed him to be healed and that man to rise up and go and the Lord acted on the basis of that identification it wasn't upon Peters beckoning call Lord heal this man he says rise up and walk in the name of Jesus Christ I give this to you this is all I've got but I give it to you and the Lord acted on the basis of his identification in the Word of God there was no scripture there was no Bible like they had he hadn't even written his letters yet it was on the basis of who he knew he was in the Lord Jesus Christ and that's exactly the same thing that's got to happen in the life of every single believer you've got to know this is who I am in Christ Jesus and this is where I'm going this is what happened to me this is why I am here this is everything this is good news that's what that's something that you can share 1955 a hidden life in Christ brother branham he says then days he dwelt in his tabernacle and today he dwells in you as his tabernacle but we must make this place a dwelling not an outer court place or the first holy place but we must live with God in the holiest of Holies a consecrate and hidden life alone quiet with God heaven and earth were once together and then they were driven apart horrendously ripped apart and the whole process and the whole plan of redemption is to bring them back together again but the ban him he says some he says in many places but particularly he says in the future home of the heavenly bridegroom in the earthly bride in 1964 now he's called the church through justification he called it through sanctification and then he filled it with the Holy Ghost and fire and he took it through a process he's got a system he's got a law that things have to abide by he says he took it through a process that he himself the Holy Spirit Himself the son of God could dwell in the human heart now it has to go through that before he can come into it God came three times Jesus came three times he came first to redeem his bride he comes secondly to get his bride and thirdly he comes with his bride all that heaven was on this earth it was ripped apart and now we live on this earth Satan's Eden but God's purpose was to bring us into fellowship and humanity now the reason that he allowed that to happen is because Adam would have never known what it was like to be redeemed had he not fallen so he allowed the world to get into the place that it is to express himself as a redeemer to express himself as a father to express himself as a healer and a redeemer and all of the things that's inside of God we know that he allowed all of this to happen so that he could show himself complete in us by that fulfilling his second purpose which was to if through Christ express himself completely through his bride he was one on the on the cross and he in the e be pulled apart and now you are the bride of Jesus Christ and now is the union of the of the bride with the groom as the visible brought Union of the bride of Jesus Christ in Ephesians 1:10 that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in all things in Christ both which are in heaven and in earth and even in him so now God's purpose now is to bring all this back to what it was in the beginning in the Garden of Eden so just now as a foreshadow just now input in potential God you you are as the temple of God the overlapping of heaven and earth but that's not God's purpose is to allow us to live like this he wants to bring us back into full communion and fellowship and so he says in 1965 the rapture were right there ready now the only thing the church coming out has got to lay before the Sun to ripen and the great combine will come by after a while the wheat will be burned in the stocks but the grain will be gathered into its garner you know the only reason that you bring character to heaven with you you don't bring anything else you don't bring your boats your cars your your your books your your Bible you don't bring anything with you to heaven except your character because in Revelations he says in it says that as he says he saw they are in Daniel chapter 7 he saw Christ and then he saw thousands and thousands ministering unto him he sees a group of people ministering to Jesus Christ and that is post millennium because Jesus Christ comes remember first to redeem his bride he comes second to get his bride and that's where we the fulfillment of Ephesians 1:10 that in the dispensation of fullness of times you might gather all that are together both things that are in heaven and which are on earth together in him so he's bringing everything back together in him and now that's when we step back into Christ we are in him potentially as what what brother Branham said the resurrection is is to take place the quickening it is taking place as everybody on the same page so now post millennium he comes back and Daniel sees which he could not release until the end he could not reveal until the end which is now we see now that Christ comes back many ministering unto him brother Branham says in the church age book the character which is the only thing that you bring with you to heaven is not a gift it's not something that's given to you like I said I'm never I'm not saying anything that you most likely haven't heard before it's not a gift it's the only thing you bring with you to heaven and remember now we're going to heaven just as Daniel saw to be ministering with Christ to judge in the white throne judgment post millennium so after all of this has brought back together in Christ we come back with him and we Minister with him in heavenly places and we do that as his queen as bride and groom so the reason that we need the character then is to rule and reign with him and the reason that character is not a gift is because it's your victory it's a victory it's not a gift so when you go through life and you go through this as Peter said in his first letter he says just this brief moment of time we call life in this brief moment of of troubles in this brief moment of of things we shouldn't be so worried about what we see but because of the things that we have a revelation of because of the things that we we see by faith we can rise above all of the things that happen to us and all of the difficulties and the troubles and the trials and the people and everything that happened we can rise above all that and we can look and we say this is where I am going I'm going on the other side because Christ's purpose was to bring it all back together again so that heaven and earth could exist on this earth we're not going off somewhere he's pulling us off the earth in the rapture and his company is bringing us together and what happens then well if Christ has to bring us through justification and sanctification in the baptism of the Holy Spirit then he's got to bring the earth through the same process because the earth was forfeited by mankind so the flood was the justification by water it was completely justified and surrounded in water and all the sin was was flooded out of it through Christ he was sanctified by the blood of Jesus Christ because now earth in heaven now overlap in the form of Jesus Christ and then to you and then after we go he's got to have he's got to purge the earth with with fire with an all-consuming fire as we read in 1st and 2nd Peter chapter 3 he says but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in the heavens in there they shall burn with a fervent Heat that's post millennium so it's got to happen where it all consumes and it's all burned up because we've got to be away from the earth when that happens because we are the only grace that the earth will ever see so because we are here heaven and earth overlapping God can't destroy the earth and fully redeem it you've got to be pulled away from it so we come together in Christ interactor he pulls us away and then it's completely consumed in fire at that point we we we reign with him and rule with him as king and queen we are brought that the completeness of our fellowship is made known at that point in time and then after that in Revelations 21 to 34 and he says in I John saw the holy city a New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with him and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away can you imagine John standing and seeing all of this he says this is what we're going to it seems it seems that that would be worth attaining if it meant boiling in a pot of oil for a few hours he was able to see this and you see what it did to John he was raised up with it was just like with the wings of eagles he was raised up beyond all of the things that he could see all of the things that was going on and he could see that is my hope that is the victory that is the that is that is where I am going to that's why it's good news not because of me and what I can do in this present time that it eliminates that should eliminate the idea of works in your mind it should wipe it completely away because it's not what you do here that enables you to get that it's you stepping into Christ that you can look and say that is where I am going to that is my hope in the Lord Jesus Christ and nothing less that is how that I can can I can get up every morning and go to bed every night and do the same again and again and again is because that is what I am looking forward to that is my hope in the Lord Jesus Christ is because God is going to bring heaven and earth back together again just like it was in the beginning of time so there's no more sorrow there's no more sickness there's no more death there's no more dying it's just us in Christ that is what his purpose is that is what his goal is for you and Satan's purpose is to try to interrupt the the relationship that you have between you and Christ right now because this is the only place that Satan will have dominion so because he placed us in Satan's even we build the character needed to rule and reign with him so we know where we're going the whole idea is for God to bring us back into fellowship with him that's what we are coming to that's what we are in is fellowship with him it's not association to an ax or a religion it's not something like that it's a fellowship it's a relationship that he wants us to come to and you first have to know God by an experience in order to have a fellowship with him but you must coming to fellowship with him but the Bannerman says it try to wrap it up he says there's lots of bypasses and this that a says always as long as I do this he said that's not it he says you've got to find God in a personal relationship and experience and if you can claim you have it and still live for the world then there's something wrong the devil has detoured you on the wrong scripture so this very closely aligns works because we so often look look to works it's what we can do because that's innately our our nature we want to do something to achieve that to have that he says you've got to find God in a relationship and an experience that's how you find him so it's not something that you bring to the table that enables you to have access to that it's something that he draws you to it's not you finding the Holy Spirit it's the Holy Spirit finding you because we were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world so right there you can be at ease if you're if you're trapped in your mind be set at ease by this it's not what you do that places you into it it's you surrendering yourself to the law that is overriding the whole thing which is the Holy Spirit and when you do that then he can find you he places you into that he gives you an identification with it he gives you the Holy Spirit to live day after day after day after day after day he gives you the knowledge and the understanding and the progressive revelation to be where you're at I mean some of you have been in the message more than I've been alive and he's allowed you to come in and to grow and to grow in the knowledge of grace and in faith and he's allowed you to do that by His grace that's nothing but the Holy Spirit leading you step-by-step you've got to surrender yourself daily to that that is fellowship remember now relationship is the act of being connected so you can know God you can know the scripture you can have an intellectual conception of it you can also have an intellectual conception of the message of our day know it backwards and front words but it's only this is just a seed it's just words on paper until you surrender yourself to the Holy Spirit so that the the bride can become one with his groom again because the two were separated so in order for you to be the overlap of heaven and earth on this on this in this Satan's Eden you've got to surrender yourself to that he says in 1960 in the unfailing realities of the Living God that's what the world needs today that Creed's and fashions and all of these things we need the realities of God we need the realities of God and so many times because by works we try to place ourselves in that whether through emotion which is not a bad thing it's a good thing to try to to raise your hand even when you don't have a reason to and that right it's a good thing to read your Bible even though you don't understand what you're reading it's a good thing to understand the message even though you don't have a really understanding of it better you understand that than anything else although it'll make your miserable if you don't have a true revelation of what it is what you need to have is the reality of God in your life nowadays I find so many especially young people they say I'm brother Steve I understand what you're saying but I don't see the reality of God in my life so I get what you're saying and I can I can conceive it but I I don't I don't have the realities of God in my life do you realize it's it's not by works lest you should boast in it it's by grace that through faith you are saved and it's faith that places you into the Holy Spirit so that the law of God can work on the basis of his own word so true Fellowship is abiding in His Word and allowing the word to abide in you and you in it and then also giving the Holy Spirit the preeminence to act on the basis of His Word in your life that's what genuine fellowship is is is is operating on the basis of the word and that's what that's what the prophet of Malachi Ford did is he pointed us to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers a faith that abided in the word a faith that had an experience an eye and an identification with the Word of God which was Christ Jesus I said such as I have I will give to you so you see such as I have I am taking in the Word of God and I am allowing the Holy Spirit to operate on the basis of that alone not on my thinking not on my reasoning not on my abilities not on my works not on anything else but the Word of God and the Holy Spirit in operation in my life that is genuine fellowship Satan's goal and his purpose is to get in between that so he'll get through work through the avenues of the spirit realm to get you to be thinking differently about the word or to believe the word in its fullness and not allow the preeminence of the Holy Spirit to move in your heart so he is his something is in the way whether it be lost or a spirit or something in your home or a lack of a fully applying the token that would disallow the Holy Spirit to act on the basis of the word it's only when you apply the token that the two become one remember it's only when the token wasn't was was it was paid for when it was bought when it was purchased for us that heaven and earth overlapped again in the form of Jesus Christ and it's only the same that it happens in you when you're born again and filled with the Holy Spirit at Christ and you become one you are flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone you never had a beginning you'll never have an ending we were there in the beginning we are going back to heaven on this earth and it happens and what's going on right now is he's bringing you and me into fellowship don't think for a second that you're not walking on water you you are out in the middle of the deep is where you are when you are operating on the basis of the word and allowing the Holy Spirit to bring it to bring it forth in your life you are allowing the seed to grow inch by inch just just a little bit by a little bit it's pulling things up from the Word of God and the water is down on top of it it's growing into a mighty tree you're developing the character and the life that you have that you will go on the other side with remember the character is the life of Christ that is on the inside of you when you are born again and you were sealed with the Holy Ghost that little seed came to life with a little spark of life that grew up in the seed but now as you water it and as you grow and as you live and as you face the day-to-day grind because that's where the Christian really lives when you face the day-to-day grind that is where character is being developed and built and that character is the life of Christ in you the seed of God that will go back to him just like it came from him you see that it's not that via that you do anything it's he inside of you that you place that and you surrender yourself to that fellowship so that God can bring out of you all that he wants to bring out of you so that he can bring it back together again just like it was in the beginning that is such a beautiful thing to me I don't say I do I hope I I hope I can't get any more simple than that that's that's fellowship that's the purpose of God for you and for me so we think of purpose in again young people have and I think old people have a hard time with what is my purpose in life what am I supposed to do and especially down a down our way we have a lot of young people they're always you know what do I do for a career what is my what is my purpose and what is my life and I say this is the purpose of God for your life this is God's perfect will for you who you marry who we know where you work and your career in your life and your house and although those things those are just bringing you into step with this those are just the footsteps that you take to get to this but this is the perfect will of God for your life and when you submit yourself to this and allow the Holy Spirit to operate in your life on a daily basis and he's a sensitive being you have to invite him in you have to create an atmosphere for him when you do that on the daily basis that's fellowship because it's only on the basis of his word and on the unmoving of his Holy Spirit that life can exist and grow and be fed and happen heaven and earth were one in the same on this earth and then they were horrendously ripped apart and it hasn't been the same since but because of Jesus Christ they both overlap in you and it's only just a brief moment in time while we lay in the presence of the Sun and grow and ripen and riping right the ripening season is different than the growing season the the stock grows but the fruit ripens and the fruit is on the vine so as we go through that we develop character which is the only thing that comes with us and some sweet day that you are coming back together never to separate again that thought but fellowship allows you just to rise above the bills the auto trouble the hard things like a fire a death all of those things and it allows you to rise above it and to say some sweet day I'm going home that is the hope that we have and we fix her eyes on that would you buy our heads with me let's close their brother Gerald if you'd like to come the musicians would like to come and I'll turn it over to you and you can sing for us but let's just bow our heads and let's pray Heavenly Father let's just all pray together Heavenly Father when we step back like that and we see the whole spans of time right in front of us and we see a great mystery like that now that we were in you and Christ and Galatians 2:20 I was crucified with you I was there with you that portion of you came back inside of me and now I live quickened in heavenly places in Christ Jesus Heavenly Father that is a reality of you amen we might not always feel the presence of God like we desire to geez we might not always have miracles happening every day although there are we might not have amazing camp-meeting experiences all the time but this fact is a reality of you this fellowship that we have although we might not feel like it is it is a reality of you man and because we have faith in it it is a greater reality than anything we experience in this life is all the things in this life are just gonna pass away a man but your word will never pass away and your word is in us so Heavenly Father teach us to come into fellowship with you and if there's anyone that hasn't it doesn't even have a relationship with you then give them that you pull on them just as hard as you can you can make them miserable until they respond because there's nothing greater than coming into Christ's presence it's good news and we thank you for it and if there's some who have wavered in their fellowship with you then bring them back into it yes allow them dish to wipe everything clear clear the flue and just abide with you and if there's those who are in fellowship with you bring them higher and we may not let the devil just beat us up but that we could just step higher and say Lord some sweet day we're all going home this is your purpose this is what you intended from the beginning and it's that that we submit ourselves to as the body of the Lord Jesus Christ tonight or as Christians as believers we submit ourselves to that granite father that you bring us into fellowship how we love you and how we think and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen amen god bless it's the name of the Lord I could preach it was a tremendous foundation amen to go on and on and on because why we're not we're not involved with natural things Hurley things but eternal a man this is what our brother brought out I I believe he had the truth I believe it was very clear I believe it was God hidden and revealed and simplicity a man by the grace of God that we come from eternity we're going back to eternity I trust we have that confirmation that identification in us a man's for the token life of the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ a man that's good so this is enough to go on for another two hours I'm sure or more so but I'm gonna leave it as it is because I believe that God has spoken Amen the Lord has spoken it wasn't our brother Steven it was the Lord oh I believe that was all my heart was the Holy Ghost a man taking the word and the truth and bring it down on this level praise the name of the Lord each that's the truth there he was right when he said that there are those that take take the message and they make it complicated and that is the truth they go off with this doctrine and that dr. another doctrine and then they make denominations have those doctrines but you got to get get into the simplicity of it of why God did what he did and you know what did what is God doing now what God did what is God doing and what is God going to do just just bring it down to simplicity it's God that worketh in me it's not me to live this crazy live within me a man that that's the confirmation again on what our brother was ministering a man and without him I can do nothing but see that again by the grace of God II knew it all before the foundation of the world he saw it all before the foundation of the world and he come a he comes to his knee like any reveal he reveals what they need to know in their day an hour to get back they may because we are his sons and his daughters Amen by the grace of God and we're going to recognize God we're gonna recognize his word a man and I believe it was God tonight ministering to us through our brother Stephen coffee a man it was able as the Lord ministering to his elect ministering to his bride giving us understanding so we're gonna let go let God have his way brothers what we let God do ya old I want to do this I want to do that I can I can do nothing without him just make sure you got him and then is revelation in you and instead it's Christ living living out his life through you by grace a man this is that's wonderful I like I like what he brought up concern he Adam Adam God made Adam he made a male and female a man and when Jesus came he was male a female yes that's good praise the name of the Lord hallelujah see the first Adam the second Adam a man but by the grace of God the first he fell but that God permitted it God knew was going to happen but the second one through the second one he's gonna bring Redemption and turn it all back again praise the name of the Lord that that's good that's why I pray God did you recognize yourself in the second Adam a man because in him we'll all live by the grace of God a man anytime at heaven and earth overlapping praise the name of the Lord I trust you got the revelation of God of all that was separated now brings back together again for the glory of God amen as what he has what he allowed in the beginning the separation at a ESA man that's right what was it was revealed himself a man that's exactly he got it right in line with the Word of God and the revealed word that God allowed it and God permitted it to reveal himself a man and that one that was going to respond would be the ones that was like him a man that would have his DNA in them would have his character and it you know they know you know I know that you're born of this man or this woman because you look this way you act this way you might talk a certain way but let's get out of the natural into the spiritual so that we're going to reflect him that were born of by the Holy Ghost a man said oh I thought you were somebody so-and-so's son no I'm the son of God I'm born to the Lord Jesus Christ by the grace of God and so on because now that's the nature he's going to focus on that's the nature is going to reflect to the world it's Jesus a man you know and and when it comes to the natural mother or father no no that was born and see him yeah that's how I was doomed with their nature but now he gave me his nature amen praise the name of the Lord that's good so consider what our brother is preached tonight again amen think about it meditate on it a man and I pray God it's going to give us the faith it's taking us out of here a man just let let you know you don't belong here not in the not in the condition it's in he's right it's Satan's he is against that yeah Saenz Eden and Satan is the god of this world brother Brown said exactly but not our God so we're going but yeah that's right - amen we bring that out concerning what because certainly we're going back because he's got it he's got it burn it over he's got a clinic clean it all over again he cleans us knows it takes us back now you got a clean there he and that's all you can bring us back and like I tell the people I said listen Evan is real I said Kingdom the kingdom of God is real and I said we're going to be on earth in a in a real Kingdom we got real things to do and I said he can't trust you here he won't you won't be there you know and if you can't serve him here you won't serve him there if you can't do this for him err do this for him there you know you you're here you won't be there a man God is bringing it all out a man by the new birth praise the name of the Lord oh this there's much to that I've got notes here on but we leave it amen thank God for the truth thank God for the word thank God for increasing our faith and thank God for strengthening our faith Amen god bless your list and a may turn with me to 282 praise the name of the Lord our brother was talking about ministry brethren that administered you know so long before he was born well I guess I was one of them and believers that believe the message longer than he then he's been around physically you know but again not spiritually he's been around a long time spiritually by the grace of God but physically so the Amen so we thank the Lord that for for God anointing him and using him to minister to us again Nepal as I quoted earlier apologized to you young ministers going to take this message on to the coming of the Lord and he said you got to fill my shoes you got to feel he said brother bevels shoes and he said because he said we're getting old we're gonna go on but he said you got to take it off well I didn't realize I'd be here at almost 70 years old and that I did to be sit and listen to our brother Stephen and to minister to me so but again there's a there is a generation just taking the word on the bride on to the coming of the Lord taking them right onto the reality of the coming taking them right onto the reality of the Resurrection the reality of the rapture brother sister I pray grace that we believe it a man don't don't just think is something going to happen let's let's see what what's happening let's see what God is doing by the grace of God and that's why many are going to miss it because they failed to see what God was doing a man in their day they missed the resurrection they missed the rapture when it was when God was was bringing it to pass a man through the revealed word of the hour they missed it because they didn't recognize it because to them was all future future future God's gonna do this God's going to do that the Papa said God's waiting on you knowing that he said that one never comes to the resurrection he said the dead in Christ not waiting on God they're waiting on you to come to that that perfect thing amen grace of God that the Lord has helped us come more and more to that perfect faith to know who we are like he said the overlapping of heaven and earth you and me in Christ Christ in me in me Christ in you by the grace of God I pray God help us get the reality of it a man that it's not religion it's not just a letter of the word it's God making it flesh in you and me God is bringing to pass in you and me amen where is the kingdom of God he's in you it's in you and me amen where is the resurrection it's in us where is there abstruse in us he's here right now god help us let's move on brother with all of our hearts that it's not going to let's not try to believe it's

Halifax and when I got to the airport and called Brenda and I said what's the weather like and she said it's really windy here so right away turbulence right comes to my mind and got on the plane and we're sitting on the runway and Halifax the pilot comes on which is really unusual he said really windy and say Jonas I said I don't know what it means it's really bad because I know what it's like I've come in like that sometimes and then when we got further up where we got flying then coming across and the copilot came out and said it's really windy in st. Johns I said it's gotta be bad so I said Lord I said if you I started praying I said lord if you can calm the sea that tried to drown you the devil tried to drown his brother branham said I'm just above to see you can calm the wind and when we started getting close to st. John's it it shook a little bit and then BOOM smooth as silk got to the runway and dropped anchor there at the gate you know and it's just over the froth the plane said a rocking again on the runway when I was coming off the game-type the wind was blowing right across right it was really windy but it wasn't windy when we were flying so the same as the water right amen amen it's wonderful praise

born to be a dwelling place maybe at 7:42 up there and I'm gonna ask mother Carson if you would come and close in prayer tonight remember to pray for the service tomorrow night for brother Stephen as he brings the Word of God amen and just thinking you know and this was the Icebreaker right can't wait Lamar Lee he meant so let's pray for brother Steven pray one for another and let's come back to tomorrow night expecting anticipating and when you do I can tell you it makes my job a lot easier and it would make the preacher job a lot easier too amen because we come expecting that to meet with each other but to meet with God so I thank God I just think God over 38 years ago I would not have been here I would never considered being here it just took a power far greater that which was controlling me at the time a power far greater and I on I can say this that that after I came to the Lord there was a a guy I used to work with in the bank many years ago you'll remember this old friend and he hadn't seen me in years and I had come to the Lord and he he came to he was brought into this place where I was working and hey Singh oh he said haven't seen it a lot of time he said you and I got to go out on the town after work and and one of the guys that I worked with you know all about me he said above this religious now and after about 20 minutes of pure laughter on his gun his face you know he just left to kill himself and I looked at the other guy and he I'll take care of it and he took him off to the side and he said he's not kiddin you know so that's what I was thinking about when you speaking about it much being older all the things that we went through all that God has done for us what our young or old what he's taking us out of what he's brought us into this is where I want to be this is where I wanna be amen let's just sing I was born you see that's what I'm saying I was born to be this right all of us we were born to be this a place for God to dwell to be
