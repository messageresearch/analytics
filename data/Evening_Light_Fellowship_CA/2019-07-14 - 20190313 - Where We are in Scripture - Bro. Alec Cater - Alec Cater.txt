TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Emily and things like that you know it's I forgot that thought that I was going to bring out a man but when it comes to a family there's sometimes they don't recall you know the relationship between family and but it's just there's a relationship there we got this in common we're just cousins or whatever but it's a relationship and it ought to bind us together by the grace of God you know that's in the natural I'm much more in the spiritual a man that I got my memory back oh yes my cousin that did go he nearing the end of his journey right committees his soul into the hands of God but nearing the end of his journey that he didn't know those around him he didn't know where he was he didn't know when it comes to naturally speaking where he was going or where he come from because he was just out of it his mine and you know sin did that to you and me spiritually but God came by the Holy Ghost with the blood of Jesus a man to give us back our memories so that now now we know him and he know a well he know who knew us and he out but now we know him now he's our Father by the grace of God amen so he came and revealed himself to us as our Lord and Savior to take us back home so brother sister well like I say I've got it typed and and I got his stuff here in my Bible where I said some call it heaven but I call it home and that is the truth you know there's a lot of people there when did they feel in religion when I die I'm going to heaven I'm going to heaven yeah but for the elect we're going to we're going home if we're the sons and daughters of God we're going home by the grace of God event because that's where we come from and that's where we're going a man so thank God for that revelation as the wisdom of God but it says get wisdom but get understanding you can know a lot about God but how much do you understand about God do you understand he's your father a man do you understand that those with you are your brothers and sisters because we're all the sons and daughters of God so they're your brothers and sisters in Christ a man and that's why there's a greater relationship with your spiritual family than it is with your natural family a man and we know that there was problems with that when it comes to brother Branham and his natural family because they admitted that they they were jealous they did yeah one of his children said well we got we were jealous he said because dad was giving more attention to the to the Christians and those that he was ministry to than he was to his natural family and so on so the only way that they could enter into a full relationship with whether Randall was to stay under the word and be faithful a man so I pray the grace of God god help us to have the wisdom of god but God help us to have the understanding of the Holy Ghost he says the old egos the life of the blood to give us understanding amen there is the knowledge of God there is a wisdom of God but again salvation Latian the understanding amen and we act according to our understanding by the grace of God it says take fire soul of instruction that are not go keeper for she is the life amen grace of God that we're going to take the instructions of the words through our brother Alec tonight thank God for sin it's amazing grace I would sweep this out amen as brother Bob is the daughter Sara sings the song that amazing is the only word that explains grace amen it is amazing grace they met because we knew each other so for me I'm and my brother Alec we knew each other 50 years ago but the we became strangers but then goddess God renewed the fellowship thank the Lord amen so I appreciate that and we thank the Lord for bringing our brother to fellowship with us and we pray in the grace of God that he will minister to us tonight the Holy Ghost will minister through our brother a man and and give us not just the wisdom of God but the understanding of God a man that will get what God wants us to get we'll catch what God wants us to catch we'll see what God wants us to see a man by understanding amen the grace of God there are those that have wisdom but no understanding that's the truth I went to school and one time and then thank God for understanding and be even back then as a teenager there were those in in my class all mine and they said oh what are they like I saw they're smart I said they got a lot of wisdom and they can do this do this that they can they can get a hundred percent I said on their exams and I said I'll only get in the 50s or 60s he said I said on my exams but I said them I said they wouldn't had the sense to boil a kettle you know and they said what I said no I said they know of this they know this they know that but when it comes to the basics the simplicity of life I said they don't have no revelation and that is the truth it's like I said about the girl one time that in from my own town I knew her and I think she said their living area st. John's now and as many years ago they're with the University and she come over from University and her mother said you'll have to help me to get supper and she said why would you want me to do what she said I want you I want you she said to get some bolon already she said in the fighting pan and so on oh she said how do I do that she's just she going to university amen and she was taking a break from university but didn't know how to fry Bellona a man it shocked her mother and she said you don't know no she said me why because she wants to taught that in university but it's common sense a man so it's the same thing in the in school that I went to in the high school there were many there oh they could get up to a hundred percent and their exams but couldn't do anything simple a man and I said well it's someone did after you one thing what's the problem I said you get I said they got wisdom but no understanding and I said they they need understanding so God help us is my prayer and God give us understanding through the going forth of the word and by the Holy Ghost about praising God law God's going to anoint anoint our brother Alec and they're going further the word and he anoint us in the receiving of the word a man and one you know how the Holy Ghost is is so it's the life of the blood of Jesus a man not many realize that not many know that they think it's different no no it's not different remember the blood of the natural lamb couldn't come back to you and me because it was an animal were humans but he came down in flesh in sinless blood a man you sinless human blood so that the life could come back to you and me that's the Holy Ghost thank God why because the price for sin was paid and you're amazing we mentioned it today in prayer and we're talking to the Lord but what's Lord this is amazing that you took our sin and you put it in the sea of forgetfulness I said this is amazing grace that would do such as they forgetfulness that no man can lay a charge against God's elect a man God doesn't see it any man oh this is true that's grace thank God for grace so let's pray the grace of God to our brother Alec as he comes but brother's sister again let's pray the grace of God to those that are hearing the word amen listening only believe all things are possible just to just to let you know I arranged for our brother Johnathan Collette to be here Easter you just be here for you become on a Thursday and he'd be leaving on a Monday because they have other plans so pray the grace of God to be to bless our brother Jonathan give him a safe journey here bless his ministry here and and it's Jenny's journey back amen they will be traveling down to California I believe to say against to see his in-laws mother and father-in-law sometime this month or early early April so we pray the grace of God be with him in his journey here amen we leave it we leave it all in the hands of God only believe God bless our brother out [Music] Oh [Music] Hey praise the Lord reponse little a man is really gone only [Music] s really Jesus [Music] we know Jesus is here because he's in these work he's here because he said we're tours here gathered even unto the end so I'm so thankful for that tonight I trust you prayed for me when brother journal contacted me today to let me know I was gone a little bit surprised because I thought it would be on a Sunday but I thought brother mark would be ministering tonight but it seems like it's following my heart but that's okay the Lord knows what he's doing we have to come with confidence amen confidence in him in his word and he's leading his flock praise the Lord was a wonderful spirit here tonight into worship I was really blessed when I was in the room I was just worshiping the Lord it's such a wonderful spirit you know I think this this assembly here is probably one of the best worship assemblies in the whole message I really special anointing cease to be under on this assembly when it comes to worshiping galore that's something you should be thankful for my trust a night that you came with joy in your heart and you know came expecting and didn't come to hear me because you'll be disappointed if you hear me but if you came and just hear the word hear what God has for us and feed your soul about it and I believe you'll be blessed I believe God has God has laid a little message on my heart tonight for you a one talk about the body change and it's a continuation from what but other journals been preaching on the rapture because this is the hour for we're living in a tremendous time brother and sister a tremendous hour when the revelation of the word is going forth and the bride Paul called it the dispensation of the fullness of times all right hey man this is the is the age that we've come to this is the hour so but you know sad to say maybe around the message they're missing what God is doing as brother journal said why does God doing now weathers are calling an election but we are called to bring a body change we are called to bring bring the dead from the grave you think about that and it is just tremendous but God has given us God has given us everything we need to do that in this message and we're living under the seventh seal the opening of the word we're living in the time of the Son of Man be revealed and he's open that word for a reason for us to bring us to a place perfection yes more that they had in any other age so by God's grace we'll just go down tonight I want to go for the lab news of faith and how do we bring forth a man we got to have the faith that Enoch had and Enoch walked with God so there is a walk we got to find it Enoch swap and I believe he not swap also a walk of faith as we read in Hebrews 11 and he held a testimony to please God amen so I believe the broad will have that same faith a man rapturing faith praise the Lord Amen so brother Branham said and I was thinking about this today that we have the perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication just think about how blessed bride should be you know because all tables are full of vomit outside this right there on the regurgitating food of another generation another age contest yeah it's not fifty eat to the bride see the Eagles got to have the fresh-killed word and we've got to be careful in this message that we don't feed on something that is not for us or we'll get very sick God has provided everything we need we Jesus has a table spread where the saints of God her faith brother Brown called it the seven-course meal amen so we're gonna be feeding on some of that tonight I told brother Bob when he came in there I had about ten different thoughts messages I could have approached but and I was trying to find the leadership of the Lord today and you know we can preach on the light we can preach on Son of Man we can preach on the wall we can preach on so many different subjects as the table is completely full and around the world some of the brothers are preaching some tremendous messages I know some of you brothers have been keyed into some of them and boys that ever bring you faith in our hearts so I trust the night that you know when you leave here tonight you'll be more built up in the faith than you were when you came my brother Brandon said every time you come to the house of the Lord you should blow the better person and the more a better Christian more faith muscles as it were you know praise the Lord so don't look at me look at the word Amen praise Lord Amen so let's all stand for the reading of the word and maybe we'll begin in 2nd Timothy chapter 3 verse 16 familiar Scripture 2nd Timothy 3 all Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished thoroughly furnished unto all good works amen let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you tonight Lord for this privilege we have a game father too coming to your house of prayer to give you thanks for all they do done for us father to be identified with the gospel in this our Lord that you have sent to know Lord that you call us out of darkness into light and to think Lord so many today Lord that they've turned away from the walk of faith Lord but you kept us by your grace Lord Oh father help us to appreciate it tonight I pray so many are maybe in churches tonight Lord in the realm of Christendom worship you in vain Lord for you said they that worship me must worship me in spirit and in truth father that's why we're here Lord look into our hearts tonight father take away anything Lord that would hinder the moving of your spirit father just breathe upon that word tonight I pray bless each brother and sister from the youngest to the oldest Lord we mother draw closer to you lord we know father the dating Christ are waiting on us as her brother journal has preached many times Lord father so help us Lord to draw closer Lord to lift up higher in heavenly places to sign father we're here to do your bidding Lord we ask these things in Jesus name a man may be seated praise the Lord let's turn to another scripture shall we you second Corinthians chapter 4 and let's read verse six say ingredients for and verse six for God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ there's a tremendous scripture let's this go now to second Corinthians three in verse eighteen to tie this in together you see God speaks to us brother Branham said this Bible is a love letter to the bride you know many people can read it and think they know it but God's got to reveal it and brother Graham said you know he talked about how he my sister Brandon with great letters when he gives away and how he would read the letter and he'd read between the lines and he said that's what that's the way the Lord is with his bride and this Bible we this is his love letter to the bride and we have to read bethought between the lines to get the meaning in the understanding what he's trying to tell us 2nd Corinthians 3 and 18 but we are with open face beholding as in the glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the Lord and one more Philippians 3 and 21 while this relates now to our team on body change well let's read verse 20 for our conversation or our citizenship is in heaven from whence also we look for the Saviour Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself praise the Lord so brother and sister both of 0 has been ministering for a couple of months now on the rapture and I'm going to probably hit some scriptures that he's he's already gone through but that's alright it's good to go over them again and I may just have a few more little things to it to add to it but I trust you know because we're just coming from that team will stay with that for now maybe we'll put on the slide first slide there brother and we start here the coming of the Lord we know that the promise that they were looking for for the coming of the Lord you know was look tore through seven ages but it has happened here in our generation that has happened here in the end time or revelation 10 says what tenem one says I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud this has been fulfilled you see it in the photo there 1963 and you can you tie these scriptures together Matthew 24 30s you can see it all up there then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven jesus said and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven now scripture is compound meaning but for us who are going to be changed this is already behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him revelation 1:7 every spiritual eye of the elect are going to see him who he is and see him in his word but some day he'll come to Israel and every spiritual I'd ever see him but this is fulfilled for us see Scripture is compound meaning and we don't want we don't want to miss our college and our our the portion is for us okay let's go to the next slide all right so the Bride of Christ who are we we're creatures of eternity caught in the time element that's who we are that's what the scripture tells us who we are so you think about that I've got the little licks of fire here to show you I'll try to get some little diagrams here to make it more you know a little better but so here we are down here worshiping and we're creatures of eternity kind of a time element yes okay so this little diagram here just to show where we are from the Ministry of Jesus of course there was the early church Peter and the Apostles then Paul in Ephesus Smyrna so on and so forth right up to the latest thing in age and this is where the Prophet came on the scene so we know all that and here to show it again an important thing to understand this the messenger comes at the end of the age so the bride age comes at the end of the latest C&H sea so we're just places all in perspective there now we're we're getting there so there was a dispensational change in 1963 with the cloud came and the seals rope and now you have to understand this we're still in later to see as you can see on the bottom there and the Pentecostal age basically from 1906 up to around 1963 when the cloud came Dan brother branham said he began to talk about the bride age because up to that point he didn't just didn't mention that actually was very late in his in his ministry that he began to refer to the bride age and they began to say I don't call you church I call you abroad he was making the distinction here so we have to come to that from 1963 on every message brother Brennan began to preach that some people think that when brother Branham preached the seals in March of 1963 that was it you know we read the seals oh that was it no that wasn't it the seals revealed and confirmed the things that he preached in the church ages but when he came to the seventh seal he he was very people were expecting something but he and they went have probably disappointed but it wasn't for everybody it's only to the elect and then when you begin to follow the prophets message and I would encourage you to read all his messages are what we call main messages because he did preach if angelically outside of the tabernacle and breath in in jeffersonville but you know all these messages were for too late and there to bring us rapturing faith see paul said their glory were changed from glory to glory so brother banner put it this way he said it'll be word upon word about word I'm under seed this in your heart that's going to bring that change to your body that's amazing bonuses how many people in the world have made notice but God has given us this hidden manna you see for outside of that the time would come it says in the word in Hosea when they would come a famine for the hearing of the word see but we would we would hear because God has an elected purpose for our lives and our calling the election as I said is to bring on that that resurrection man let's go to the next one so the body changed will come at the end of the bride age are calling in the bride age is to bring on the rapture and body change and translation of the endtime bride to finish up the Gentile dispensation of grace they were at the very end there's no eighth Church age and so we know when we when the resurrection takes place and our bodies are changed we're cut away to be with the Lord then that's when tribulation will sit in that's when the gospel will go back to the Jews and Moses and Elijah the two witnesses will rise up on the scene over there I trust you understand all those things okay so the Bride of Christ or creatures of eternity and we're caught in a time element now that's turning the scriptures and let's go a little further into this see if we can enhance our understanding a little bit word is good isn't it it's just such a wonderful thing I get so blessed when I'm reading the word you know I trust you read your Bible every day brother and sister I trust you pray read your Bible because you know that's brother and saver they asked him how do I stay close to God he said read your Bibles and pray that sounds so simple but God is hidden in simplicity that's the way the Lord does that you see amen John 14 let's let's turn John 14 verse one brother journals register for well I'm just gonna go a little further with you dear let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me and my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also so you see the first slide of shoulders - coming to the Lord and Jesus is saying I'm coming again I will come again I go to prepare a place for you now brother branham's tied this person scripture into the death burial and resurrection of Jesus because we know that he ascended on high you remember when he rose the first day Mary Magdalene was the first to see him and he said touch me not I have not ascended to my father so Jesus had to go to prepare a way for us he had to go and bring the blood to the mercy seat you see because but Adam had done in the garden when he had seen he had separated fellowship no one could approach unto God and to it that holy God so that until that perfect sacrifice came in Christ and brought that blood here is the proof he's purchased so yeah that's how he prepared the way to get us back to God see he's not up there brother Graham said building houses and so huh you know like so on and actually the Old English witness says in my father's house it was like the House of Tudor or the House of Windsor it was the domain like Kings would have a domain you see that's me sounded and many mansions are you and me you see Hebrews 9 to 24 says Christ enter once entered into heaven itself - now to appear in the presence of God for us that's how he made that way for us amen he was the firstfruits of them that slept see that's how we would know the way he would be the first to go there and because he has he has preeminence in all things and but bringing that atoning blood to God on our behalf to satisfy the requirement of sin in order to restore our fellowship with God again and reclaim that book of redemption which Adam had Warfighter amen praise the Lord so when my father's Kingdom are many dwelling places or places of abode where was that when I laid the foundations of the earth God asked Joel the terephthalic a sunder standing verse 7 of chapter 38 when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy a man it's nice to see yourself in the world isn't it I see brother Chad dear they shouted for joy I see brother Paul I trust I see you all a man we should all rejoice amen praise the Lord is great to see yourself through the word brother chant amen praise the Lord brother a man that's why I was shouting rejoicing tonight I guess we just feel the blessings of Lord Ephesian wants as according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be wholly without blame before him love so Paul is showing the same thing that job has been asked by God here where were you before I laid the foundations of euros a good question but see if you're a part of God brother branham said you always were we've talked you sure you got the eternal life now you always had eternal life praise the Lord so you know it says there that they sang and shouted now you say well that was in the mind of God was it or did they have some kind of body that they sing it and show these are things brother the Bride of Christ has got to get into the heart now so let's look at who are we anyway well events that were trying be mean up a body spirit and soul this is confirming Scripture 1st Thessalonians 5 he says Paul said I pray that God that your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ so there's the confirmation of the triune being and these are basic things I guess everybody has been thought in the message pretty well but the body we know is Jews for feel see hear taste and smelled I said we can't that's what we use for everybody's contact in our spirit realm brother branham does the way he laid it out and I just put it your way he says it conscience reason affection the imagination and memory the five outlets for the spirit but in the soul and I believe brother Gerald mentioned just last Sunday or Sunday before and disorders other faiths or doe yeah let's go a little deeper into this now oh brother sister the Bride of Christ has been taught these things were a reason to bring us to perfection we have to understand these things so we don't be deceived we should be thankful to the Lord that he sent us a prophet but don't say it the Lord so our body can contact our earthly home my brother band said our body was put together around really because of sin he winced it went through Satan's perversion that's right that's where it was perverting the beginning and his subject to sin and death is only temporal you know it's all gonna dog we're all aging and so on it's in the time element and it's in the realm of the scene in spirit in our spirits we can be anointed by God or we can be anointed by Satan there's figlio love in our spirit that's like human affection and so on like we're Eva and it's in the realm of beyond seeing as well because we can't see your spirit but we manifest sometimes what our spirit let our spirits are experiencing but now in the soul this is where predestinated G seen of God is placed by the man said and you can reject the word and if you do your non-si well the brand said you go give him a word they keep tearing down he's dead go back go back this is where the agape he'd obvious as opposed to figlio love figlio love this heart and a lot of people worship God in a fear they love Jesus you know they've got an imagination that this man with a long robe on and sandals o my Savior he's so good he forgives me but if you give him a word I don't believe that I don't have to get baptized I don't you see that's they're rejecting the word but the agapo love of God is corrective law brother Branham said like little Johnny that goes out into the street you know fill your low sister little Johnny you know corrective lobsters Johnny get back here get off that Street because he doesn't want Johnny to be killed and that's the way God is what else he has to correct us all said any man that don't take correction he's uh he's not genuine you know jail time so you know we can be even in our worship worshipping God and praising God like many Pentecostal groups evangelical groups do but if we don't have the C gene in here that's what we got to be careful of even in this message we've got to be careful now you know don't misunderstand me we love the worship the Lord I love the worship Lord much as anybody but but I always remember the final test is do they receive the word that they believe the word it's in the realm of the unseen it's eternal the soul is there's no time element and his subject things above and that's where our walk we did not we'll get to that may be another message but things above we set your affections on things above not on things on the earth and a context the sixth dimension you remember brother Brown and went beyond the curtain of time amen he sold after his body he looked back on the bed he sigh sigh self laying in the bed and he went beyond the curtain of time amen there was another body so Genesis born we see the body that the distinction here I just thought I'd mentioned this and so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them now we see in this white depiction here this is let's say it's the Genesis 1:27 man later on God puts Adam in to an earthly man and the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life man became a living soul before his soul was in the sea awfully now he comes over to this earth and body and the Lord God planted the garden eastward meeting then he put the man whom he had formed boban said Adam would not have sinned in this body over here Genesis 1 but once he went into a body of flesh you see he was subject in let's go a little deeper on this now so the gene seat of God this is the real you that's why the sons of God shouted for joy it's a heavenly theophany it's perfect it's immortal this river it's sinless you spot a bird and you written in the Lamb's Book of Life it possesses Zoe like for God's own life and it's too real you well I said we know where we come from we know where we're going praise the Lord but the earthly man he's earthly he's flesh not put together right he's imperfect he's mortal he's born in sin he loves the things of the world that's your nature you're born in sins come to rural speaking life he all his acts are written in the book of life everything you do some men's sins go before them others follow after to judge me see hey they need new birth and it's a negative view so so that's the distinction that we make there amen praise the Lord now I just put this little one in here does God always types down through scripture see the triune Man and in the tabernacle there was the outer court it's like the body there was the inner court or the Holy Place that's like the spirit and on the inside to do the inside is beyond the veil there's where the soul is that's why we got to get beyond our flesh and our spirit get into when the Holy Spirit comes in we are born again is two quickening the Holy Spirit on that gene seed that's in your soul that brings it to the new birth amen so I just showed that you know scripture see God's pattern as brother Joe said God doesn't change his pattern this pattern is playing on these purpose so the pattern that he showed in the traffic because we are Tabernacles every night so we know of this earthly House of this Tabernacle will dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens anything this eternal brother man said had no beginning there's got no answer praise the Lord so when this earthly Tabernacle this old body man flesh dies amen we go to we go into our theophany praise the name of the Lord Nestor okay the prophet went beyond the curtain of time brother what excuse are they going to give on the day of judgment all that God has done for us and showed to us yea and told us and we're going to reject that I mean we've got no excuse it's like the spies that came back with the evidence you see they brought back the brother Brendan came back and he said whatever you do don't miss it he said words can't explain how glorious it is you know here we are these old shriveled up bodies getting old with aches and pains and sickness why what God has well the scripture says man has not seen or heard the things that God has for them that love him amen now who we are we were with God before the foundation twirl and it says here for as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood you see as much as we are in desert Lea man we had to be redeemed Jesus see he also himself likewise took part of the same so here we see Jesus in flesh and blood upon the earth you see this scripture alone confirms what the prophet the same you see confirm where were you before the foundation of the world right praise the Lord and Galatians says and because you are sons God has sent forth the spirit of his son into your heart crying every thought you were with God before the foundation of the world because you are sons Amen he sends forth his spirit and here's a scripture brother Branham often referred to Matthew 18 tense where I say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven and Bob Ryan said this is speaking of the theophany bodies that are over there remember he said it's to come as a child and so on there's a little picture depicting Jesus speaking to the children and he was saying appeal hinder their faith or then engage them to be better that millstone was hung around your neck and thrown to depths of the sea see because they are the children of God a man speaking of dirty and Easter face is always there angels do always people the face of my father which is in heaven now here's Moses and Elijah I'm no Transfiguration and behold there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him Matthew 17:5 la borde a brother branham's headed north ER anybody's and they're talking to Jesus now Jesus allowed this for our benefit you see this confirms everything else you see you hear dinner there little see we got a place to work throughout right so they were there and the three Peter James and John and you remember Jesus said no don't tell this to any man until after Son of Man is risen you see because he was transfigured before them amen and they were shown the brother Brennan said of prevision my brother and sister and I stood under dimensioned that's that sixth I mentioned and I personally believe that the bride of Jesus Christ their thoughts are gonna be on things above heavenly thoughts heavenly things we're whole who we are we're gonna realize when these days Bill Graham said when the bride comes to realize who she is asking the rapture although that's when our bodies have changed face puffy we've got to keep always you know in our hearts and our souls contact with that other dimension when we're praying when we're believing for it for needs will become here and someone has some whatever you need is we got to just always be higher in heavenly places that says six dimension we have nothing to do with the world and the further we grow in faith to further away that is you know and you know how bad is getting in the world I mean it's just insane over there but on the opposite side we're moving yes every day passes we're getting closer to the body change closer to the body change all the time see God's wheels move slowly but you know 50 years ago we didn't understand a lot of things like we do today God is unraveling that revelation wrangle or by more by now we're getting closer closer ESPO I told brother zero number of months ago I said brother God's got some wonderful things in store for his bride we just got to keep posting about keep searching keep digging that's brother journal even read quote on Sunday their relevance they keep taking in the rapture message a man amor belong full and someone a ministry around the world are digging into some wonderful things and I believe that we don't want to be behind he meant we want to be right there moving right on brother one of these days we'll take a step like he he not did in the program said he said praise the Lord so here's a quote from brother Branham from the message fellowship he says now when John 14 when he said in my father's house as many mansions speaking to the disciples before going away he said I can't imagine that being stones in the bricks and mortar I believe the tabernacle he was speaking of was another body see so this is just to confirm about John you see in my father services many Tabernacles four mansions destroyed his tabernacle all raised up in three days in the beam if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved we have all one one already prepared and waiting raised the name of the Lord and then let's turn now to second Corinthians Amen and we quoted this one a little earlier 2nd Corinthians 5 verse 1 for we know that our earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god amen a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens single burner sister amen hallelujah for in this tabernacle this earthly one we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed to bond but the house which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked I remember in the parable of indeed one went into the marriage supper without the wedding garment he was naked he never had his stuff he wasn't you see he couldn't good instead he had strong to other darkness if so be that being thought about we shall not be found naked for we that are in this tabernacle do groan being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed the bond that mortality might be swallowed up of light Paul is talking about taking that other body amen praise the Lord one that's eternal in the heavens amen let's go back to first Corinthians chapter 15 if you would I'll try not to keep you too long but I think we should look at a few scriptures are you enjoying the work amen the Lord is so good first twenty of first Corinthians 15 but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept for my man came death for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the Dead for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order Christ the firstfruits afterward they that are Christ's at his coming amen let's go to verse 35 but some men will say well how are the dead raised up and with what body do they come good question amen Paul says therefore that which star solace is not quickened except to die and that would still solace does so us not that body that shall be but bare grain it may chance sweet or some other green but God had given me the body as it has pleased him and to every seed his own body hey man every elected Gene seed of God has a body praise the Lord every seed his own body all flesh is not the same flesh for this a pound of flesh man another fish and beast not a fishes and other birds but there are also celestial bodies as theophanies and bodies terrestrial that's your earthly body but the glory of the celestial is one and the glory of the terrestrial is another there is one glory of the Sun another glory of the moon glory of the stars one star different from another and glory so also was the resurrection of the Dead it is sown in corruption and his race and in corruption praise the Lord it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body praise the Lord and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living soul last man and last Adam was made a quickening spirit howbeit that which was that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural but afterward that which is spiritual same with you a new birth their natural do not then after when you get born again then you become spiritually men as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy and as is the heavenly such are they also that are heavenly yes and as we have borne the image of the earthy we shall also bear the image of the heaven you will look like yourself as whatever image you were when you were 20 years old brother I'm said that's the way you look in that new body yeah we'll recognize each other and that's something he praise the Lord all I just love them to work you know the word is the scripture comes to my heart now it's just turn to Luke 24 just see about that scriptures just turn to Luke 24 this really blessed me when I read this this we have borne the image of the earthy we shall bear the image of the heavenly Luke Luke 24 and let's read verse 39 this let's quote the 36 and as they were sand as they thus spake Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and saith unto them peace be unto you but they were terrified and freighted to suppose that they had seen the spirit and this is the account of Jesus appearing unto them after his resurrection and he said unto them why are you troubled why do thoughts arise in your hearts you hold my hands and my feet that it is I myself hang on me and see for a spirit hath not flesh and bones as ye see me have see he said see look at me I'm the same one that you knew before as the earthly souls to heaven be born praise the Lord isn't the wonderful brother Amen so let's continue now back in 1st Corinthians 15 again verse 50 now I say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither doth corruption inherit incorruption behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep see but we shall be changed where everybody changed brother and sister so we're going to be on the earth we don't know the Living Dead you know we don't commend the grave of course but what goes just going to change see God showed this to Paul way back in that first stage in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise shall be raised incorruptible and shall be changed praise the Lord and courses ties into 1st Thessalonians 4:16 but you see the last Trump is the seventh angels message to the Gentile see is the sounding forth of the word trumpet always descending forth of the word and remember scripture is compound meaning there will be a trumpet to the Jews also but the trumpet shall sound and enhanced and the dead in Christ shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality amen so when this corruptible has put on him corruption and his mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory amen we know that the last thing to me to be destroyed is death praise the Lord Amen but thanks be to God a man sting of death where is thy sting grave where is thy victory for the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which has given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ the heir for my beloved brethren and this is for us tonight be be steadfast immovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord I trust you know better tonight that your labor is not in vain in the Lord Amen we were going to take our possessions someday take our inheritance brother and Branham was asked questions and questions and answers in 1964 about the dead in Christ he said but those who are sleeping in the dust will be awakened first and they'll these corruptible bodies will put on incorruption in the rapture in grace of the Lord and then we'll all get together when they begin to get together then we which are alive and remain shall be changed these mortal bodies will not see death but just of a sudden there will be like a sweet go over us then you'll be changed and imagine brother and sister thinking about that and your turn back like Abraham was from an old man to a young man turn back Allah gave my mother an old man to a young man and to a young woman from an old woman to a young woman what's this sudden change after a while you were travelling like a thought and you can see those who are already resurrected Oh what an hour practicing think of it praise the Lord rally that's gonna be something that's we're rejoicing now well what'll that be you know you'll see sister coffee or this burning this sister why I'm lyin what an hour the Prophet said and then we'll be gathering dem be cut off with them to meet the Lord in the air amen as the scripture said then we which are alive and remain if we cut off together with him you cloud to meet the Lord near that's gonna be quite an event brother I came to eat a man but here's the thing Paul said many bought that fool might have told you often and now tell you even weeping they're not they are the enemies of the cross of Christ who's in this destruction whose God is their belly and whose glory is in their shame who mind earthly things so those who mind earthly things are not going to get caught away where our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ who shall change our vile body that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things praise the Lord see so this is why I said keep your mind on heavenly things amen and affections on things above not the things of the world for our conversation is in heaven that means in heavenly places seem to work amen around the revealed birth a man where he look for the Savior who will change raw body praise the Lord that's what it's all about that's the calling of this hour amen let's turn to Romans for another scripture I guess time is going okay they're still got a few more minutes maybe you're tired amen praise the Lord Romans 8 and 11 says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell he knew see he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal body by his spirit that dwelleth in you now he's already quickened it you see but he's going too quick of these even more just first twenty three explains you just go down to verse 23 not only day but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit that means to know or to experience or to realize to wit the redemption of the body that's the that's the completion of salvation a body change you see you're born again you save the Holy Spirit but you're not fully redeemed until you get that body change Paul is saying hey to wit and to experience or to having to know a man the changes of that body amen the redemption of our body praise the name of the Lord amen don't you love the word a man let's read a little further Romans 8 again and we're going to read from verse 16 the spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are the sons of God that's how we identify she were in agreement with the word all the time he meant and if children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together that's why we've got to be bearing the reproach for the word see there's no glory without that suffering though the Jareau use that scripture from Philippians many times you see you know we suffer with him Paul saying the same thing here amen so we've got to bear that reproach and every time you go even if you're walking the mall or whatever every time you speak to your neighbor you're always a witnessing you don't have to say much they says look at you the scripture says you were written was rid of all you got to hold a ghost Road they know what okay and all your different there's no zero the streets and sunny and your and that's that's required that's the requirement that the holy spirit you've got to walk in the spirit at all times you can't come to church on Sunday and then on Monday you know be afraid be ashamed of him if he you're shaming him down here you'll be shame of you up there well we got a various reproach Amen by God's grace for I reckon Paul said in 18 verse 18 and I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God amen for now for me no well verse 20 for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption praise the Lord see this is a body change right delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together unto now not only day but ourselves also which had the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves amen we groan within ourselves waiting for that full adoption so full adoption is not going to come until we get that body change first corinthians s alone ian's every down now 1st Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13 well I would not have you eating up rather than concerning them that are asleep oh we just read this from the wall ago that you saw all not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so then that sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first as brother Joel was ministering on Sunday from the prophets message to rapture he said all these things happen together right the shout is the message going for we've heard the voice of the Lord hey Manny Archangel and the voice and the Trump of God and brother Burns said one of them will call the dead from the grave so we're very close brother and sister a man for that catching away time verse 70 and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord therefore wherefore comfort one another Amen with these words praise the Lord I have another quote here okay okay we read that one all right praise the Lord one more scripture second test villain 1710 sake that's baloney in 7 so 2nd Thessalonians 1 7 to 10 and to you who are troubled rest with us when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels now this is what happened in 1963 you see in flaming fire what was there to Pillar fire in that profits message taking vengeance on them that know not God and that obey not the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his power when he shall come to be glorified in his Saints and to be admired and all them that believe because our testimony among you was believed in that day my brother sister this scripture here has been fulfilled now there will be multiple fulfilling some scriptures we know but you can't deny that when the Lord is descended in 63 in that cloud the angels came with him all right we know the pillar fired a flaming fire was in the province ministry and it was bringing judgment on one hand the dogs that rejected the word but it was grace to us who received it so it says in verse 9 who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord now the presence of the Lord would ease brought because the presence is always weak better mind at work wherever the word is to presence is and in the ark we remembered it to the two angels were there its cherubim and and God told Moses that his presence would be between the cherubim and you know brother Brian's ministry was a type Moses and Elijah and the presence of the Lord that pillar of fire was with the Prophet you see that's the octet were with amen that's the secret place that the bride's gone into beyond the veil praise the Lord even though the Prophet was gone you see the mantle of Elijah went back to Elisha and Elijah was a type of the bread a man and he had a double portion raised the Lord so I did the bride's going to have a double portion a man of that spear that was under prophet he said kept do became more will unfold amen please gone so all scripture brothers and sisters given by inspiration of God as we read to begin and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction and for instruction in righteousness Amen aren't you thankful for the word that God has given us amen so I think we'll probably charge will close right there I've got lots more but a man we can go some other time maybe we'll continue and on some more thoughts about the new body well God has done so much for us and just this message is such an incredible message you know it's just unfolding all the time and blessing up my heart on your heart and bringing us closer and closer every day amen today change amen praise the Lord let's stand together and the Lord bless you each one as musicians come maybe maybe we can sing the little son I'm loving him more every day you feel that way in your higher problem sister oh I do amen why I trust it you got that hunger in their thirst all the time see because there's a famine for the hearing of the word I'd be a brother but God by His grace has given us so much we can feed that we can come closer to him amen to the unveiling of that word that he's given us the Lord a man didn't Jesus say there be a famine or diverse places to Matthew 24 is happening now all throughout the scripture as you see it Amen but we're thankful tonight I trust you are well God's grace and His mercy so I'm loving him more every day a man I see [Music] Thank You Lori [Music] if your spacing [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] a man was born from sir brother compactor [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen praise the Lord hallelujah we've turned the clock ahead maybe we could put it back an hour a man but I'll try my grace to be brief but thank God for the word amen and again it is faith that comes by hearing and hearing by the word a man so we got to hear the word so I thank the Lord for for doing what he did tonight so our brother Alec in lining of the word a man this scripture this scripture this scripture a man is amazing that he could take you just over an hour maybe and have so many scriptures it would take me a month or longer a man but thank God for the scriptures that our brother brought out and God by the grace of the by grace through the Holy Spirit lining them up and brother it's all pointing it's the truth it's all pointing to a body change a man God did this and God did that and God said you did this down through the ages in the last four thousand years for what's he doing now a man made that by science and history and religion they're all identifying what God has done but how many are identifying with God it with what God is doing a man and when brother our brother brought it out and and summarized it and then he just brought it to a conclusion it's somebody change a man say then beyond beyond and what is the body change it is the resurrection and it is the rapture and he and again he brought know the dead in Christ shall rise first a man then we which are alive remain but baby what is to bring on that resurrection what is to bring on that rapture it is the Lord descending from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the cloud and it's all in the cloud and I like that oh praise the Lord I say thank you Lord God brought out the boat the cloud the cloud the cloud the cloud God revealed himself in a cloud through a cloud and and and it's not just it's just not clothes of rain it's not clouds of moisture that you and I are experiencing it's clouds of glory and clouds of glory or the clouds of angels a million because that's that's what the prophet of God saw and what our brother brought out there was tremendous when he when he started with the picture of the cloud a man because the Lord should descend from heaven with a shout and as the voice of the it would be in a cloud and he ate pardon in the Lord Himself amen and he's exactly he brought it with one scripture after another after another after another and I noted I said it's all clouds eisah God in the cloud God in the cloud God in the cloud and and and and the part of God near the end of his ministry before God took all of all he because why he was to be the witness they made this when he was east I'm not the son of man he said I am Ehsan a man revealing the son of man a man and he was he was pointing us to the revelation of the coming so that we were going to context it's going to take us into the resurrection and Rajshri faith a man and her brother was a lady also tonight but for it is the body change a man he was the body change in crisis the money changing you and me by the grace of God the Old Testament know the New Testament a man and the prophet of God said oh and he was talking about the coming of the Lord he was talking about Jesus being here and with us these are there he is cuz people one of the only hasn't come he's not here but he is there is he said looking down at us because it was it was Christ coming in the clouds of glory and we know that it was it was the Father God did see seven angels and there was one of them that was attracted to him and he was attracted to them and then again what did they tell what was the message the word go back would go back to age for the old me of the word and what was they were going to do any man it was Alleluia praise the Lord have brought a God elbows that is not just things not just the unveiling of this mystery of this doctrine of that doctrine of that doctrine no brother it's the body change as our brother was bringing out tonight is the body change we're brothers anything we need right now is the body change right not because not because I'm 70 years old not because you're your senior your 50s or your 60s or whatever you're 30 to 40 but and even though even though young sisters right here are getting older a man and no doubt they look forward to their their ninth birthday look forward to our tenth birthday and so on but then a dedicate gets to a place where you're not looking forward to your birthday as exactly the truth they'll come and they'll go so much a man how old are you I don't know we'll see I'll check and see but when you're a certain age when you're young you know how old you are that's right but brother begin it that what is that it is the testimony of the fall it's a testament in what happening the beginning in the Garden of Eden a man Adam and Eve did not get old a gold brother until the sin amen when the sin struck and God put him out of the garden out of the presence of God amen brother sister that says that's when time begins at 8:00 to take the effect on the body amen so brother sister God by God again a promise praise the name of the Lord hallelujah right from the beginning right from Genesis right there God give a promise he said now he said what have you done and he and he spoke to the woman and he she didn't say you know this or that or something else she said God didn't say what God said who again they say you know again in the city the city at the idea of sin it was a Eve eating an apple you know and again we've heard a lot of people say if eating an apple made a woman look realize she was naked we should pass the apples again hey man it was an apple that Eve that he ate and when God came to her he wasn't asking what she did or what did this or what did that but who did it amen because God knew that it was it was a being and it wasn't an apple there wasn't a fruit and so far no but it's like the particle someone said oh it was a pear not an apple you see it was a pear all right it was a not a PE arpa ir a mad it was that pear on the ground he said Adam and Eve he said that was the original syrup and so on but God kept coming down a man to bring out the sin to reveal the sin and so on and God said and rather a God God did give them a promise he said I will put enmity between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel and the Father God said the devil's been on the heels of the bride ever since a man ever since Calvary because he bruised the devil's he had know the devil is after the bright a man so he say he said the Jesus bruised the devil's did now the devil is after the bride because he knows crisis in the bright as our brother Alec were springing out is Christ in the rites Christ in you is Christ in me Amen praise the name of the Lord it's again it's not me that leaves us Christ liveth in any man praise the Lord brother what what's he doing what's Christ doing in me what Strait is doing in you what did Christ doing all all the church ages bringing us to a body change it's good praise the Lord don't forget what you heard tonight a man I pray God you don't lose the revelation I pray God you don't lose so don't don't stop focusing on what God is doing amen not just what God has done and I just that this doctor that doctor that doctor no but it's the race the Revel is the resurrection in the rapture amen brother this is what God wanted to do from the beginning he wife he wants to get us back a main Indy and not just into theophany bodies he wants to get and get us into the theophany and glorified a million proud of God said the daily Cruiser go to arise and appear to the living Saints living things are going to be cut into that dimension and he sitting today there are theophanies and instantly into glorified bodies anybody and then I renew you a van if this pillar of fire he said it will go and our brother referred to the body of Jesus they went up it's that fella fire will go into the body of Jesus and he said hallelujah and the Saints that are changed in glorified bodies and their fellowship with one another and so on he said they look up and there are years again descending in the cloud he said we look up in here Jesus coming down in the cloud and he said we're gonna rise to meet him in glorified bodies Bonnie how did he accomplished what he wanted to do get us in our glorified bodies praise the name of the Lord brother were into that oh I pray God would give us more and more of that faith through the word tonight a man that it's a body change by the grace of God it's a body changed we're going into the marriage supper of the Lamb by the grace of Almighty God amen so let's not ignore the clouds as I told you before I saw I did have the vision of the coming of the Lord oh yeah and there was clouds amen and I I had to come away and I said all alone no no no Lord no and he said that's all right son he said that's what they it's coming again he said I'm coming again he said this is going to happen again he said we will receive you and we're up on top of a mountain and we all had to come back down from the mountain and him and the Angels went all back into the into another dimension yeah and I was only it just his young man and I was it was over here I'm at number 15 Hamill Street that's where that's right where it happened to me yeah that's many years ago maybe 1966-67 yeah thank God

a man bring the dead in Christ to a body change a man he accomplished it brothers sister and the redemption yes mr. Shetty of that perfect sinless blood amen yes that's good but he not only had to lay his life down by shedding that blood he had to pick it up in order before to fulfill the promise of a new body hallelujah this is wonderful thank God for the revelation of the body changed brother we're not looking for God to do this God has already done it he's done this he's done this he's not this now there's no anything one thing left when you and I consider the crazy world we're living it as brother Chad was telling me about some crazy things that he was seeing and brother and when I when I go

subdue all things unto himself amen and I'll just share with with you one Scripture amen that I referenced with that scripture and in Psalms 17 and verse 15 as for me I will behold thy face in righteousness and I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy likeness that's good praise the name of the Lord what is it a body change praise the name of the Lord will have the lightness of God in flesh in the person of our Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah wonderful our brother brought Oh many many many scriptures her brother thank God hallelujah he could start again and go on with another hundred scriptures it's all word word word a man again it's not not just enough to believe well that's the Word of God that's the Bible yeah but let and you can have the wisdom oh yeah you know there there's

thoughts on that but they praying the grace of God that all of us all of it what God has done is to give us the faith of the body change not just wisdom but understanding one thing to know something another thing is to understand it understanding is what puts us into action a person can have wisdom and do nothing but understanding puts them into action by the grace of God amen god bless you turned to number or in the in the book it's 40 but I'm not sure what it is here praise the Lord sister God be the glory great things he has done so loved you the world that he gave us his son who
