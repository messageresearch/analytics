[32:19] bring that the tree that they were
[32:23] forbidden to eat up in the garden had
[32:27] the baptism of the holy ghost we have
[32:30] access to that tree of life a man by the
[32:34] grace of God and if you notice maybe I
[32:38] should read it it's in the first church
[32:46] Shh the first church age not not the
[32:50] last one but it says he that has it here
[32:55] that I'm here what the spirit saith unto
[32:58] the churches
[32:59] to him that overcometh will I give to
[33:03] eat of the tree of life which is in the
[33:05] midst of the paradise of God and so the
[33:08] baptism of the Holy Ghost were partaking
[33:11] of that tree onto the change of our
[33:14] bodies a man we have been changed and we
[33:18] are being changed and we will be changed
[33:19] by the grace of God keep partaking of
[33:25] the tree of life amen
[33:27] Lord bless you and we welcome everyone
[33:31] from out of the city outside the city
[33:34] and we certainly welcome our brother
[33:36] Brandon Kessler from Alberta it's been a
[33:40] long trip it's been so many delays and
[33:45] so when it comes to the length of his
[33:47] servant tonight we'll leave that between
[33:50] him and the Lord if he wants to preach
[33:53] for an hour
[33:54] that's that that'll be fine a half hour
[33:57] that'll be funny or or two hours that'll
[34:01] be fine as the Lord leads him we
[34:04] understand that our brothers had a long
[34:07] hard trip so in physically he may be
[34:11] somewhat tired but again we pray the
[34:14] Holy Ghost will give him
[34:16] the anointing that he needs and the the
[34:20] energetic energy that he will need to
[34:22] get the word to you and me
[34:24] amen by the grace of God and the prophet
[34:30] of God said maybe you're going to wish
[34:35] that he doesn't hear this and about our
[34:39] brother Brandon and minister for us not
[34:41] long ago and we enjoyed his ministry so
[34:44] we know forward to the Lord ministering
[34:46] again through our brother Brandon but
[34:53] the power God said now this morning
[34:57] before we approach the word oh he said
[35:01] let's not be in no hurry
[35:03] about anything he said you got all day
[35:08] today and he said and tonight and
[35:12] tomorrow and he said let's just take our
[35:16] time and not rush these things through
[35:20] now some of us don't some do he said you
[35:25] don't have to work tomorrow any out well
[35:28] if your work is not going to be heavy
[35:30] labor it doesn't make a difference if
[35:33] it's heavy labor then it would make a
[35:36] difference but I do recall as I've said
[35:40] before that in over the last years in
[35:43] the early days of them the ministry and
[35:47] the message people didn't care that
[35:51] mattered not to them they went through a
[35:54] service and then went to work that's the
[35:57] truth that's the truth as I told you one
[36:00] time before that we were witnessing to
[36:02] someone in in Buuren and we went there
[36:06] it might have been maybe early in the
[36:08] night and then after a fellowship we
[36:13] heard the alarm law in the bedroom
[36:18] and we looked at our watches and it was
[36:20] 5:30 a.m. and we had fellowship
[36:26] fellowship talked about the word talked
[36:28] about the work and the alarms alarmed us
[36:32] we were wondering what was going on and
[36:35] the sister said oh she said that's my
[36:37] son he has to go to work at 6 o'clock
[36:39] and and we were not even tired but we we
[36:45] dismissed it and one of the brothers
[36:48] there or a couple of the brothers
[36:50] networking with us they also had to go
[36:52] home get something to eat and go to work
[36:54] a van then one of them was brother
[36:58] brother Smith he's gone on to be with
[37:01] the Lord now and he went he went on to
[37:03] 84 years god bless him with it with a
[37:06] long life a man but again is the
[37:11] anointing from the inside a man and says
[37:17] he said you don't have to hurt tomorrow
[37:19] anyhow so we just take our time this is
[37:22] a New Year's Eve message and he said and
[37:25] that's the reason I thought instead of
[37:27] preaching just about three or four hours
[37:29] that I would take eight or ten hours on
[37:33] teaching eight or ten hours and well
[37:38] you'd be almost like Paul preaching till
[37:41] sunrise
[37:41] hey man but I tell you this if your
[37:44] heart is in it God's in it a man by the
[37:47] grace of God a man and he said there is
[37:52] not a person here we ought to seek it
[37:55] out what God wants he said out of our
[37:58] heart to find out what it means
[37:59] he said concerning the new birth and he
[38:02] said there's not a person in here that
[38:04] wants to go to torment into a place of
[38:07] torment that's why we're here tonight we
[38:11] want to go to the other place of comfort
[38:13] not torment and he said so he said you
[38:17] don't drive hundreds of miles over icy
[38:20] roads and spend your living spend your
[38:27] living
[38:28] he said your money just to come to
[38:31] church and shake hands more to it than
[38:35] that
[38:36] he said just to shake hands although
[38:39] you'd love to do that and to hear the
[38:41] pastor or the hear myself or other
[38:44] ministers speak no no he said there's
[38:47] something that draws you here a man is
[38:51] something eternal we come to hear our
[38:54] brother Brandon but again not our
[38:58] brother Brandon we come to hear God
[39:01] speak through our brother Brandon a man
[39:04] this let's believe that let's understand
[39:07] that that we're not going to hear
[39:09] brother Brandon and Kesler we're going
[39:11] to hear the Lord Jesus Christ yes him
[39:14] speaking through his servant a man by
[39:18] the grace of God
[39:19] so being prayer for him and the prophet
[39:24] of God said now this is the first thing
[39:27] I want to say is Jesus never lived for
[39:30] himself his life was spent for others
[39:35] for others and he said that's perfectly
[39:41] eternal life you don't live it for
[39:45] yourself you live for others you put
[39:50] your life as where in the background
[39:54] crisis in the front and he's in the body
[39:58] and he said when you say you go to
[40:01] church and you do good things that's
[40:03] fine but he said when you live your life
[40:05] to yourself you haven't got eternal life
[40:12] amazing isn't it
[40:15] he said eternal life is living for
[40:18] others the body of Christ first remember
[40:24] he talked about giving to the poor he
[40:26] said the body of Christ first and if
[40:28] you've got extras you can give it to
[40:29] those out there disappointments at the
[40:36] judgment because they failed to realize
[40:38] this and acknowledge it
[40:41] amen he said turn alive is living for
[40:45] others and it proved that when it come
[40:48] in the Lamb of God he lived and an
[40:51] eternal life because he did not live for
[40:53] himself he lived for others he lived for
[40:55] you so how much are you living for him
[40:58] not going to church for living for him
[41:03] he live for others and you received
[41:07] eternal life by receiving that day and
[41:10] you don't live for yourself no more you
[41:13] live brothers a man thank God for the
[41:19] word so again remember our brother
[41:23] Brandon in prayer got to give him the
[41:25] strength that he needs and also of
[41:29] course we welcome the the break family
[41:35] that sure that was there on Sunday
[41:37] morning there was Sunday morning a
[41:40] when's know what Sunday morning and so
[41:44] we take the Lord for their presence with
[41:47] us and that God will make them a
[41:49] blessing to us amen
[41:51] and for the brother Macondo who's able
[41:53] and sister Macondo is able to make and
[41:55] brother Menasha able to make a Dean from
[41:57] Buer god bless
[42:00] and we were wondering if brother brandon
[42:03] was going to make it and what we would
[42:05] do if he didn't well him I said brother
[42:07] McConnell's there he can minister
[42:10] brother Bob said well together you were
[42:12] a brother my condo where are the other
[42:14] amen
[42:15] so God God God provides a man and also
[42:21] brother Brandon will be ministering
[42:23] tonight and again tomorrow night at 6:30
[42:26] and Sunday morning at 7 or 11 o'clock

[43:14] so God's grace to bless his ministry as
[43:17] well as the ministers to the Saints
[43:19] there in central Newfoundland now also
[43:28] to remind you that I have put some extra
[43:32] Bibles outside but there on the top of
[43:36] the shelf outside just in case that
[43:38] somebody comes leaving their Bibles home
[43:41] or somebody comes without a Bible a
[43:44] visitor or whatever so that they can use
[43:46] one of these Bibles it's the King James
[43:49] Bible and it is basically a giant print
[43:53] print reference Bible so if you borrow
[43:58] one I wanted to
[44:00] just to remind you to make sure you
[44:02] leave it in your seats or just lay it
[44:04] back out there on the shelf again for
[44:06] visitors that might come without a Bible
[44:09] so it's there for the use of the Saints
[44:13] and also I have two copies each of them
[44:18] at these books the messenger and
[44:22] generation this is by Angela Smith
[44:27] brother George Smith daughter and the
[44:29] other one is by well partly by sister
[44:32] Rebecca before she went and also brother
[44:35] George and I guess his family finished
[44:39] it after sister Rebecca's going because
[44:43] history Becca was planning on writing a
[44:44] book entitled my father of the Prophet
[44:47] but she never got to write it and I
[44:50] don't know if she had any anything
[44:52] written regarding these things but after
[44:58] this they printed this book on the
[45:01] messenger and it is just pictures of
[45:03] brother Browns ministry from beginning
[45:05] to end and and it is very very very good
[45:09] it's a blessing to me and I know it'll
[45:13] be a blessing to you now the generation
[45:16] book most of us know that is just
[45:18] testimonies of the brothers and sisters
[45:21] different brothers and sisters who met
[45:24] with whether Branham and who had
[45:25] fellowship with brother Branham you know

[45:45] interview with one of her sons and back
[45:49] at that time I don't know what he's
[45:50] doing now but he was a school bus driver
[45:52] so there's an interviewer there with him
[45:54] there's an interview
[45:55] with brother Billy ball and testimony of
[45:59] sister Lloyd's and so on and I might
[46:04] have been AI brother Macondo might have
[46:06] mentioned where the concerning marriage
[46:09] and I sure was you mentioned or not or
[46:12] somebody and that brother Brown did not
[46:15] go to their marriage because of what
[46:19] Billy Paul had done when he was 15 years
[46:21] old but the testimony here is that
[46:26] brother Branham did call them in before
[46:30] they went to get married and brother
[46:33] Brown called them in and and he talked
[46:35] to brother Billy Paul he talked to
[46:37] sister boys now they did not say what he
[46:40] said they did not reveal the
[46:43] conversation but he just gave him the
[46:45] instructions he said after you're
[46:48] married I want you to come back and see
[46:50] me again because he has some other
[46:53] things to say to them but they did not
[46:56] mention that either they but they do
[46:59] give their their testimony of their
[47:02] experience with brother Branham amen
[47:05] so we're not worshiping brother Branham
[47:09] but we thank God we thank God for the
[47:14] ministry and for the testimonies we have
[47:16] hear of the ministries and even a even a
[47:19] testimony of Brotherly Vail is here and
[47:22] brother Jack Mohr's daughter and that
[47:26] testimony is here as well and how that
[47:29] brother Graham had asked her to do the
[47:31] church age book and of course she turned
[47:33] it over to brother Levi oh so it's a
[47:37] blessing again not to worship brother
[47:40] Branham but to thank God for the
[47:44] prophets help us to appreciate what God
[47:48] has done in our generation and again
[47:53] like I said I don't understand them
[47:54] denying the cloud of angels I don't
[47:58] understand them denying the pillar of
[47:59] fire I don't understand them denying the
[48:02] prophecy of with him Branham of some of
[48:05] the teachings because again it's
[48:07] his teachings is it's the Lord Himself
[48:11] revealing to us and you can go I can go
[48:15] back to a message that the problem of
[48:17] God preached in 1961 and there he speaks
[48:22] of an experience that a sister had in
[48:26] her home as far as I know and it was it
[48:30] was the presence of God in the home it
[48:33] was it was hard to describe but they
[48:36] could see this in the room and it was
[48:40] like a like a cloud and like a pillar of
[48:44] fire it was all over the room and she
[48:47] called this one in and they saw it call
[48:50] that one in they saw it went and got her
[48:52] father to come and he came and he and he
[48:54] looked around he saw it and so she asked
[48:58] her father to pray and he just couldn't
[49:00] do it he's I can't I just can't be
[49:03] sitting in this presence and the prophet
[49:06] of God said this is 61 the October and
[49:09] and the problem of God said that it was
[49:11] a testimony that God was going to do
[49:14] something in the future amen and he did
[49:17] it was the cloud of angels amen they
[49:21] came down in the future because he
[49:24] different for reference a cloud that
[49:26] they had seen and but they couldn't
[49:28] explain the cloud so God explained it by
[49:32] coming down seven angels a man Christ
[49:36] explained it in the opening of the word
[49:39] praise the name of the Lord so the Lord
[49:42] bless you let's stand and we're gonna
[49:44] sing only believe all things are
[49:46] possible only Billy welcoming to our
[49:49] brother Brandon and turning the pulpit

[52:44] recognize and for those that I don't god
[52:47] bless you and look forward to meeting
[52:50] you and to fellowship with you but you
[52:55] know I'm just thankful that the Lord
[52:56] takes for us when you look at many times
[52:59] just different situations when I first
[53:02] ran into trouble on the way here they
[53:04] said I wouldn't make it to about 7
[53:07] o'clock tonight and we're just thankful
[53:10] that the Lord made away you know and you
[53:13] know we have a part to play in that
[53:15] trying to make arrangements but just try
[53:18] to put them in the Lord's hands and say
[53:19] order that's what you want you know if
[53:22] you want if it's your will for us to be
[53:24] here this weekend then we just want you
[53:26] to have your way you know we don't want
[53:29] to organize it because of our own
[53:30] ambitions our own ideas but we just come
[53:33] and say Lord whatever you want whatever
[53:35] you want to accomplish that's that's
[53:36] where we want to be is just right
[53:38] walking right in is perfect where I'm at
[53:40] so god bless you it's a real honor and
[53:44] privilege to be with you again and we
[53:46] certainly realize every time we come to
[53:48] service we have a responsibility of
[53:50] ministers to catch the inspiration from
[53:53] the Lord and then get out of the way and
[53:56] let the Lord speak however he wants and
[53:58] you know we want to recognize that
[54:01] receive me just bow our heads Lord Jesus
[54:07] father we're just so thankful that we
[54:09] are sons and daughters here Lord Jesus a
[54:13] group of believers gathered on Lord many
[54:17] miles from where I'm from but Lord still
[54:19] believing the same word Lord trusting in
[54:22] the same God and father we just want to
[54:24] come tonight Lord and worship and praise
[54:27] and thank you that you have a bride load
[54:29] around the world thank you that you have
[54:31] hearts that are soft to the leadership
[54:34] of your Holy Spirit and father tonight
[54:35] we just want to we want to come with
[54:38] open hearts we want to come with hello
[54:40] to a gentle spirit Lord just whatever
[54:44] you would speak to us though may capture
[54:46] attention Lord me that word be soon in
[54:48] our hearts Lord and and father may it
[54:50] find good ground tonight we pray we just
[54:52] ask that you would have your perfect way
[54:55] Lord shut my mouth to anything that you
[54:57] wouldn't want to speak Lord and and
[54:58] father may you just come forth and say
[55:01] what you have to see us tonight Lord we
[55:03] pray that you would have your perfect
[55:04] way in all things in Jesus we turn our
[55:10] Bibles to Isaiah chapter 60 very
[55:19] familiar scripture to us but look at
[55:21] this from a little bit different
[55:22] approach I'm sure they all appreciate we
[55:25] can be looking at the same mountain as I
[55:27] saved by looking at it from different
[55:28] angles and bring out different qualities
[55:31] I want to look at the thought of
[55:32] identification through this scripture
[55:36] here tonight brother Bob was singing the
[55:40] very first song was ancient words and
[55:42] that's just the song I really enjoy but
[55:46] we'll see in a sec how it fits here
[55:47] together so Isaiah chapter 60 and verse
[55:49] 1 says arise and shine for thy light has
[55:55] come and the glory of the Lord is risen
[55:59] upon thee oh there we go
[56:12] praise Allah arise and shine for that
[56:15] light has come and the glory of the Lord
[56:16] is risen upon thee for behold the
[56:19] darkness shall cover the earth and gross
[56:21] darkness the people but the Lord shall
[56:24] arise upon thee and his glory shall be
[56:27] seen upon thee and the Gentiles shall
[56:29] come to thy light and Kings to the
[56:32] brightness of thy rising then also in
[56:35] first Corinthians chapter 14 we find
[56:39] here
[56:39] Nepal speaking and he says for God is
[56:43] not the author of confusion but of peace
[56:46] as in all churches of the saints
[56:51] god bless his word he may be seated so
[56:55] the reason I say that that song tied in
[56:58] so well is because you know to me the
[57:00] Bible is such an extraordinary book not
[57:03] just because of the words that are on
[57:04] the pages but because of the God that
[57:07] that inspired it because of the God that
[57:09] anointed men to write things down the
[57:12] the Bible is such a different book than
[57:14] any other book you know when we you know
[57:17] we read a book read a history book
[57:18] there's information in there that's very
[57:20] interesting there's things in there that
[57:22] you may be very stimulating all it's
[57:24] it's fascinating to hear you know I
[57:25] remember when we were visiting a couple
[57:26] years ago and we got to see some of the
[57:28] history of Newfoundland and go a Signal
[57:30] Hill and see all the different things
[57:32] there it's very interesting it
[57:33] stimulates our minds interesting but you
[57:35] know if you went there every day and you
[57:37] read the same information you know walk
[57:39] around the same thing read sento and you
[57:41] know this year this battle was fought
[57:42] and this you saw it day after day after
[57:44] day we get kind of dull we'll get kind
[57:48] of boring I already know this you know I
[57:49] already understand the content here so
[57:51] it's not it's not stimulating it's not
[57:53] it's not living anymore it just becomes
[57:55] dull in our years and or in our mind and
[57:58] to read the same things over and over
[58:00] again you know in any book you know if
[58:02] you you haven't memorized you know it
[58:04] just it doesn't bring you the same kind
[58:05] of stimulation or or life that it would
[58:08] the first time you'd read it but the
[58:09] Bible is such a different book that way
[58:12] because it is an ancient book it isn't a
[58:14] book that's stood the test of time but
[58:17] yet when we read it we don't read it in
[58:18] a way that becomes duller and duller
[58:20] every time that we read it oh yeah I
[58:23] already know the story yeah this was
[58:25] good this was interesting yeah oh you
[58:27] know all right well you know I'll just
[58:29] move on oh no I read this once you all
[58:30] read this one too oh I've read this
[58:32] chapter before you know I don't need to
[58:33] go back to that every time we go back to
[58:35] here
[58:35] I trust that every time we go back there
[58:38] we see something in it that we never saw
[58:39] before we see something we might have
[58:41] read you know the story you know of
[58:44] Daniel before but next time you go read
[58:45] the story of Daniel there's something
[58:47] else that you grasp from it there's
[58:48] something else that you pull from it it
[58:49] stimulates you no way that any other
[58:51] book wouldn't you know you read a book
[58:52] about you know any historical thing you
[58:55] you know you wouldn't necessarily grab
[58:56] something new because of it but the
[58:58] Bible has such incredible strength in
[59:00] that there's something for you today
[59:02] reading about something that happened
[59:04] some years ago and that's the incredible
[59:06] thing you know because why because it's
[59:08] God's Word and and we know that you know
[59:11] that God is his word he's not separated
[59:13] from his word he's not it's not just a
[59:15] bunch of things that God told us to do
[59:16] or you know things he did in other
[59:17] people's lives and then he just you know
[59:19] leaves it off separate from himself he
[59:22] is his work and even you know we think
[59:25] about God's will brother Brown tells us
[59:26] his will is his word you can't separate
[59:29] it you can't separate the characteristic
[59:31] of the word and the character stuff of
[59:33] God they're the same thing so that's an
[59:36] incredible thing you know you when you
[59:37] read something in the scripture you can
[59:39] read it and it happened in its time it
[59:41] was fulfilled in its time many times but
[59:44] yet there's something that's just as
[59:46] relevant and just as true and then
[59:48] sometimes an even greater manifestation
[59:49] today for God's elect then there wasn't
[59:52] its original fulfillment when it took
[59:54] place you know and so with this
[59:56] scripture that we just read in Isaiah we
[59:57] could point to the time of Jesus walking
[59:59] on the earth as a fulfillment of the
[1:00:01] scripture arise and shine that light has
[1:00:03] come the glory of the lord has risen
[1:00:04] upon me you know we can look at Jesus
[1:00:06] and say he fulfilled that completely you
[1:00:09] know he he did all he did that he walked
[1:00:11] as the light of God you know he's Sean
[1:00:13] he he caught everybody's attention you
[1:00:15] know it says the Gentiles shall come to
[1:00:18] thy light the kings today to the
[1:00:19] brightness of that Rising that was
[1:00:21] fulfilled in Jesus that you know that
[1:00:22] that came forth that already happened
[1:00:24] but as we read it it doesn't get duller
[1:00:27] and duller and dimmer to us we realize
[1:00:30] there's a fulfillment of it again today
[1:00:32] you know there's a fulfillment of it
[1:00:34] today that's just as strong and powerful
[1:00:37] as it was in Jesus you know if we were
[1:00:40] to read the Bible like we would read
[1:00:42] other books or the stories you know they
[1:00:45] they lose their meaning they lose their
[1:00:46] significance say oh that was different
[1:00:49] that was in Jesus day but when we read
[1:00:51] about it today we realized it's it's not
[1:00:53] even just about Jesus in the form that
[1:00:55] he was walking on the earth it's about
[1:00:56] Jesus in his elect right now you know we
[1:01:01] many people look at Jesus the scripture
[1:01:04] we just read maybe and say Jesus was the
[1:01:07] light of the world Jesus did you know
[1:01:08] shine forth and you know David said
[1:01:11] though the Word of God is a lamp unto my
[1:01:13] feet and a light unto my path and
[1:01:14] there's a lot of people that treat Jesus
[1:01:17] as a light you know
[1:01:18] light into their path just like a
[1:01:19] lantern you know the people would look
[1:01:21] at and say you know I believe in Jesus
[1:01:23] and it shines the way before me you know
[1:01:25] when I came to the Lord when I repented
[1:01:27] of my sins when I gave myself to the
[1:01:29] Lord you know when I when I confessed my
[1:01:31] faults when I accepted his mercy His
[1:01:34] grace to me that's that became a light
[1:01:36] in my life and so now when I as I walked
[1:01:38] there's a there's a path there's a
[1:01:40] lantern and you know they can bear their
[1:01:41] salvation out in front of them and say
[1:01:43] you know this is what leads missus what
[1:01:45] lights my path you know and there's a
[1:01:46] measure of power that comes with that
[1:01:48] there's you know there's a measure of
[1:01:49] strength that comes from being able to
[1:01:51] bear the word of God like that but you
[1:01:55] know that wasn't the way that God
[1:01:57] intended it to be like a flashlight or a
[1:02:00] lamp to us that we could pick up or put
[1:02:03] down whenever we feel like it we could
[1:02:06] turn it on or turn it off whenever we
[1:02:08] feel like it that it's that strength
[1:02:10] would you know get brighter or dimmer
[1:02:12] depending on how fresh the batteries
[1:02:14] were or you know how much fuel was in
[1:02:16] the lantern you know that that wasn't
[1:02:18] the way that God intended his light to
[1:02:20] be you know just just a little beam
[1:02:22] shining forth to let your way Jesus says
[1:02:25] here speaking of himself he said then
[1:02:28] spake Jesus unto them saying I am the
[1:02:30] light of the world he that fall with me
[1:02:32] shall not walk in darkness but shall
[1:02:34] have the light of life you know and many
[1:02:37] people have taken that scripture say
[1:02:39] alright you know I've got some I've got
[1:02:41] Jesus in my heart shining forth like I
[1:02:42] said as a lantern there's a lamp but
[1:02:45] when John writes about Jesus coming he
[1:02:47] says there was a man sent from God whose
[1:02:49] name was John but the same came for a
[1:02:52] witness to bear witness of the light
[1:02:53] that all men through him I believe he
[1:02:56] was not that light John but he was sent
[1:02:58] to bear witness of that light that was
[1:03:00] the true light Jesus which lighteth
[1:03:03] every man that cometh into the world
[1:03:06] John the Baptist wasn't the life Jesus
[1:03:09] was the way but look it wasn't supposed
[1:03:12] to stay there it says in verse 10 it
[1:03:14] says he was in the world the world was
[1:03:16] made by him in the world knew him not
[1:03:18] and he came unto his own excuse-me his
[1:03:20] own received him not but as many as
[1:03:22] received him to them gave he power to
[1:03:26] become the sons of God even to them that
[1:03:29] believe on his name you know he didn't
[1:03:31] give you
[1:03:32] the power to to bear just his name but
[1:03:36] he gave you the power to become sons and
[1:03:38] daughters of God maybe after the exact
[1:03:41] same way that he was made you know he
[1:03:43] was the light of the world and so if we
[1:03:46] were made in the same way then we become
[1:03:47] the light of the world you know a lot of
[1:03:49] people don't like that they like to be
[1:03:51] able to push the light onto Jesus and
[1:03:52] all the light stays there and when I
[1:03:54] feel like you know when I feel like
[1:03:56] being spiritual when I feel like being
[1:03:57] religious I pick it up and I give myself
[1:03:59] a little light if I you know if I'm
[1:04:00] running into trouble if I'm sick if I'm
[1:04:02] afflicted then I pick up the light and
[1:04:04] I'll try to shine my way you know what
[1:04:06] Oh God bring me out of this darkness
[1:04:08] bring me through this trial but that's
[1:04:10] not the way it's intended to be Jesus
[1:04:12] says you are the light of the world and
[1:04:14] a city that sit on set on a hill cannot
[1:04:16] be hid a lot of times we want to hide
[1:04:20] why we go to work and we kind of want to
[1:04:23] hide you know I hide it a little bit
[1:04:26] because you know when the light shines
[1:04:27] forth it both illuminates and exposes
[1:04:31] and when it exposes there's a lot of
[1:04:34] negativity that comes with it you know
[1:04:37] Jesus we you know that the way that the
[1:04:39] worlds twisted the image of Jesus is you
[1:04:41] know as though when Jesus spoke
[1:04:43] everybody just smiled and their hearts
[1:04:45] were just warmed and everybody just
[1:04:47] loved him so much and everybody just sat
[1:04:49] with her hands on the house oh isn't
[1:04:52] that wonderful
[1:04:53] well there were people that responded to
[1:04:55] Jesus that way and there were people
[1:04:57] that picked up stones trying to kill him
[1:04:58] when he said this exact same thing why
[1:05:01] because the light blue manifested and
[1:05:03] exposed whatever was in their lives and
[1:05:06] and Jesus is saying here you are the
[1:05:07] light of the world you know we shouldn't
[1:05:09] go in you know we want to avoid conflict
[1:05:12] sometimes I know I certainly do you know
[1:05:14] you go into situation people ask me on
[1:05:15] the plane you know or different things
[1:05:17] oh you know you know what are you coming
[1:05:19] to new plumbing front I mean from here I
[1:05:21] said oh no I'm going to visit some
[1:05:23] friends you know and it it's easier to
[1:05:25] say I'm going to visit friends and say
[1:05:27] well yeah I'm going to preach the gospel
[1:05:28] you know why because people at home oh
[1:05:32] really huh that's interesting you know
[1:05:35] and and the light exposes things that
[1:05:39] necessarily you don't want to deal with
[1:05:41] right you know Vic telling you about I
[1:05:43] can't wait to go to the music festival
[1:05:44] this weekend and you
[1:05:45] drink a bunch and you know everything
[1:05:47] else and and they don't want to hear you
[1:05:48] say that you're coming to preach a
[1:05:49] sermon the same night that they're not
[1:05:52] going to remember what happens right so
[1:05:54] you know it's easier many times to kind
[1:05:57] of hide the light to kind of you know
[1:05:59] shelter it or protect ourselves you know
[1:06:00] when we go to school maybe children we
[1:06:02] we don't act the same way that we would
[1:06:04] in church maybe we wouldn't you know in
[1:06:06] church we would raise our hands we
[1:06:07] praise the Lord but you know at school
[1:06:09] maybe we wouldn't bow our heads and and
[1:06:10] pray over our food because it brings a
[1:06:13] certain amount of reproach it brings you
[1:06:15] know a different kind of atmosphere when
[1:06:16] you get around certain people you know
[1:06:18] not that you would act worldly but you
[1:06:20] would try to suppress that light a
[1:06:22] little bit because it because it makes
[1:06:24] manifest it makes people uncomfortable
[1:06:27] but Jesus said that's the way it's
[1:06:29] supposed to be it's supposed to be
[1:06:32] displayed for everyone to see that light
[1:06:34] is supposed to shine forth like a city
[1:06:36] that's set on a hill you know no matter
[1:06:38] which direction you'd approach it from
[1:06:40] all you'd see you'd see that City and
[1:06:41] from from any direction that's the way
[1:06:44] that the light of God is supposed to be
[1:06:45] not just in Jesus but in God's elect
[1:06:48] today he says neither do men light a
[1:06:49] candle and put it under a bushel but put
[1:06:51] it on a candlestick you know when when
[1:06:54] we are lit on fire for God we want to
[1:06:58] control that but who lit the fire
[1:07:01] God lit the fire and so because he he
[1:07:04] lit the candle he wants to have it
[1:07:06] display you know he didn't light the
[1:07:07] candles he could hide it in a room
[1:07:09] nobody ever sees it he put he lit the
[1:07:11] candle in your life so that you could
[1:07:12] shine and that light could be expressed
[1:07:16] let your light so shine before many said
[1:07:19] that they may see your good works and
[1:07:21] glorify your father which is in heaven
[1:07:24] you know I think that's one of the
[1:07:26] things that that people get so confused
[1:07:28] about people you know really expressing
[1:07:31] the lack of Christ in their own life
[1:07:33] they say well you're getting you know
[1:07:35] you're gonna get too you know too
[1:07:37] self-centered you know someone like
[1:07:39] brother Browns ministry a lot of the
[1:07:41] criticism that comes from it is saying
[1:07:43] he made himself God he made himself this
[1:07:46] he made himself that but Jesus tells us
[1:07:49] that you're the light of God and thereby
[1:07:52] expressing that light you're glorifying
[1:07:55] your father which is in heaven you know
[1:07:57] God's not afraid to share that
[1:07:59] Laurey and he and god's not worried that
[1:08:01] when you act like you should when you
[1:08:03] act like a son or daughter of God that
[1:08:05] he's somehow missing out because your
[1:08:08] attention you know people might be
[1:08:09] captured and give you the attention no
[1:08:11] God says that it glorifies your father
[1:08:14] to express the light that he put in you
[1:08:16] you know God's not worried oh man you
[1:08:19] know what are people gonna think if you
[1:08:20] know if his young brother here gets you
[1:08:22] know on fire for me they might they
[1:08:24] might get focused on him no he says
[1:08:25] that's that's the glory of God arising
[1:08:28] and shining in this person's life you
[1:08:30] know it's it's being expressed and
[1:08:33] there's nothing more glorious than a son
[1:08:35] of God being expressed that's what makes
[1:08:37] the Word of God truly powerful not when
[1:08:39] we can just enjoy the benefits of what
[1:08:41] somebody else's light is shown for but
[1:08:44] when when we ourselves have an
[1:08:46] identification in God brother Ram says
[1:08:50] in the fusion church age he that hath an
[1:08:51] ear let him hear what the spirit saith
[1:08:53] unto the churches how tragic it is that
[1:08:55] this first age did not listen to the
[1:08:57] spirit instead it listened to man but
[1:09:00] thank God in the last age there will be
[1:09:02] a group rise up the true bride of the
[1:09:05] last day and she will listen to the
[1:09:07] spirit in that day of gross darkness the
[1:09:09] light will return by the pure word and
[1:09:11] we will return to the power of Pentecost
[1:09:14] to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:17] there is a purpose in it there's an
[1:09:19] expression that needs to take place to
[1:09:21] welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ you
[1:09:24] know and I think it's interesting here
[1:09:25] that you know we gotta quit saying in
[1:09:27] our own self there will be there will be
[1:09:30] there will be he says here you know that
[1:09:32] that the bride will do this but it needs
[1:09:36] to actually start taking place you know
[1:09:39] the the light is not one day the bride
[1:09:41] will shine is the light you're the bride
[1:09:44] God's giving you his word God's put his
[1:09:47] Holy Spirit in you so shine now shine
[1:09:50] now don't wait say oh you know one day
[1:09:52] I'm going to shine know it's the shining
[1:09:54] of that light that produces the
[1:09:56] conditions ready for Christ's coming you
[1:09:59] know it's not all rapture morning Matt
[1:10:01] I'm really gonna shine for him know if
[1:10:03] you're not shining for him till rapture
[1:10:05] morning you're not going we have to be
[1:10:08] identified with Christ otherwise we're
[1:10:11] not going to to get in the condition
[1:10:13] that we need have a body change it
[1:10:17] should compel us to arise and shine the
[1:10:19] glory of the Lord is risen not upon
[1:10:22] Jesus now but upon mrs. Jesus Christ
[1:10:24] upon the Bride of Christ she is a light
[1:10:27] and witness of God in this time you know
[1:10:30] that doesn't take anything away from
[1:10:32] Jesus that doesn't take anything away
[1:10:34] from any other spiritual person that
[1:10:37] God's used in fact it's a greater glory
[1:10:39] because now in this last age God is
[1:10:43] using his bride in the same power in the
[1:10:45] same demonstration of his word as he did
[1:10:48] in Jesus a sinless body this the
[1:10:53] scripture tells us that the glory of the
[1:10:55] latter temple is greater than the first
[1:10:57] you know if you're to read here to read
[1:11:00] about the original temple that Solomon
[1:11:02] built it was much more incredible than
[1:11:04] the restored temple that they built when
[1:11:06] they came out of Babylon it was much
[1:11:08] more magnificent you know had much more
[1:11:11] gold and precious things in it because
[1:11:13] it was a time when they when Israel was
[1:11:15] rich and able to provide all those
[1:11:17] things the the temple that they built
[1:11:19] with zerubabbel and and all the
[1:11:21] different ones there it wasn't nearly as
[1:11:23] glorious in the actual
[1:11:26] magnificence of the building you know it
[1:11:28] wasn't it wasn't as bright and shiny it
[1:11:30] wasn't as as incredible but yet God said
[1:11:33] the glory of the latter is greater than
[1:11:36] the first why because it was easy in
[1:11:38] Solomon's time to build this temple of
[1:11:40] great riches and splendor when
[1:11:42] everything was going great in the
[1:11:43] kingdom was at its peak and everything
[1:11:44] else but for those believers to come out
[1:11:48] of Babylon and return and of their own
[1:11:51] strength and time and effort and give of
[1:11:54] themselves to produce that second temple
[1:11:56] it was more glorious in the eyes of God
[1:11:58] because it came from a greater place of
[1:12:00] sacrifice a greater place of subjection
[1:12:03] to the Word of God then it took for
[1:12:05] Solomon to do everything and they just
[1:12:06] follow his lead and so when we find in
[1:12:08] this time that we live it's wonderful
[1:12:10] that Jesus Sean forth and and truly God
[1:12:13] put such a witness forth that you know
[1:12:16] in a sinless body he could overcome
[1:12:18] every devil he could overcome every
[1:12:20] demon
[1:12:20] power over all things but it's even more
[1:12:22] glorious in the eyes of God than in a
[1:12:24] sinful body in a body that was born in
[1:12:27] sand that was separated from God that
[1:12:29] had no chance of ever making anything on
[1:12:31] its own that God could have the same
[1:12:33] kind of authority the same kind of power
[1:12:35] the same kind of life shining through
[1:12:38] and overcome the devil the same way
[1:12:41] that's even more glorious than it was in
[1:12:43] Jesus so what hinders us from shining
[1:12:47] light sounds so good you know all of us
[1:12:48] how what hinders us there's darkness
[1:12:51] gross darkness on the people the Bible
[1:12:55] said darkness on the earth and gross
[1:12:58] darkness on the people it's not the
[1:13:01] earth that's the problem so much it's
[1:13:03] the people on the earth you know it's
[1:13:05] the anointing on the people of the earth
[1:13:07] you know that's the the fall didn't take
[1:13:09] place when the Lions got out of order
[1:13:11] the fall didn't take place on the
[1:13:13] elephant's got out of order the drafts
[1:13:14] of zebras are and when the oceans just
[1:13:16] started pushing their boundaries no the
[1:13:18] world got out of order when man fell
[1:13:20] when man when man chose darkness rather
[1:13:23] than light that's what caused the fall
[1:13:25] and so when we see there's darkness on
[1:13:27] the earth sure but the real darkness is
[1:13:30] on the people Jesus says the light of
[1:13:34] the body is the eye if therefore that
[1:13:38] eye be single thy whole body shall be
[1:13:40] full of light but if that eye be evil
[1:13:42] thy whole body shall be full of darkness
[1:13:44] if therefore the light that is in thee
[1:13:47] but to be darkness how great is that
[1:13:49] darkness you know there's a reason why
[1:13:52] this world so spiritually dark you know
[1:13:54] it's not because you know there's drug
[1:13:56] abuse it's not because there's alcohol
[1:13:58] it's not it's because people have
[1:13:59] rejected God that that's the reason that
[1:14:03] it's dark it's not dark because you know
[1:14:05] this you know the murder rates high it's
[1:14:07] not dark because you know global warming
[1:14:09] it's not dark because of any of those
[1:14:11] thing is dark because people have
[1:14:13] rejected their Creator people have
[1:14:15] rejected the God that made them jesus
[1:14:17] said if our eyes are on him single
[1:14:19] focused then we are full of life but if
[1:14:22] our eyes are evil how great that
[1:14:25] darkness will be you know if our focus
[1:14:27] of our attention is is off of him and on
[1:14:30] to all of the things of the world how
[1:14:31] great that darkness will be
[1:14:34] jesus said in John 12 yet a little while
[1:14:38] is the light with you walk while you
[1:14:42] have the light lest darkness come upon
[1:14:45] you for he that walketh in darkness
[1:14:46] knoweth not whither he goeth while you
[1:14:50] have life believe in the light that you
[1:14:53] may be the children of length these
[1:14:55] things spake Jesus and departed and did
[1:14:57] hide himself from them and says you know
[1:14:59] it's just it's interesting that he's
[1:15:01] telling you you have the light or you
[1:15:04] still have a choice when when the lights
[1:15:06] presented to you in the light you know
[1:15:08] it is displayed before you have a choice
[1:15:10] to walk in that light or to continue on
[1:15:13] in darkness you know you have a choice
[1:15:15] you know that's why it's not good enough
[1:15:18] to come to church and have the light
[1:15:20] manifested before you you have a choice
[1:15:22] walk in that light walk in that light
[1:15:25] that you may be the children of light
[1:15:28] you know there there needs to be a
[1:15:30] participation of the children of God
[1:15:32] walking in the same light that you
[1:15:34] walked in not just coming around the
[1:15:36] light like bugs attracted to a light
[1:15:38] ball but but actually staying in that
[1:15:41] light walking in that light conducting
[1:15:43] ourselves as children of God Jesus tells
[1:15:46] us there that that those that walk in
[1:15:49] darkness don't know where they're going
[1:15:51] and really that's the true condition of
[1:15:54] this world
[1:15:55] you know if we're speaking of
[1:15:56] identification here how much harder does
[1:15:58] it become to identify thing in the dark
[1:16:00] you know right now you know what the
[1:16:02] lights on in here we can see each other
[1:16:04] clearly we can see we know exactly who
[1:16:05] sit in every pew you know whether I know
[1:16:07] who they are or not doesn't matter I can
[1:16:09] clearly see you I can see even a bee
[1:16:11] they're just hiding there we're hiding
[1:16:13] brother Mark and you know I can see each
[1:16:15] and every one of you and and it's clear
[1:16:17] you know I'm not gonna fall flat on my
[1:16:19] face trying to walk out the door
[1:16:20] hopefully because I can see where I'm
[1:16:22] going it's clear the way is plain but if
[1:16:26] we were to shut off all the lights you
[1:16:27] know there's no light shining in from
[1:16:28] the windows and we had to try to make
[1:16:30] our way without any light we have
[1:16:33] trouble you know we wouldn't be sure we
[1:16:36] see a dark shape I'm not sure who that
[1:16:37] is this sitting there I don't remember
[1:16:38] is that this brother is that you know
[1:16:40] that sister I'm not sure you know maybe
[1:16:42] we'd you know feel our way along the
[1:16:44] wall I said the light switch oh just the
[1:16:47] I'm not sure it brings uncertainty and
[1:16:49] it brings down you know I'm sure most of
[1:16:51] you have this experience like I've had
[1:16:53] you know you you get up in the middle of
[1:16:55] the night maybe to use the washroom or
[1:16:56] check on something and it's dark in your
[1:16:58] room and the you know normally you'd
[1:17:01] walk through your bedroom and you'd have
[1:17:02] no trouble you wouldn't be bumping into
[1:17:03] things you wouldn't you wouldn't bang
[1:17:05] your toe on the bed frame or anything
[1:17:06] but in the darkness you do what it's
[1:17:10] because it's not clear it's not plain
[1:17:11] you're very familiar with the room you
[1:17:14] know you're very familiar with all the
[1:17:16] things that are in there and yet you
[1:17:17] still bump into them you still you know
[1:17:19] aren't sure maybe your feeling for the
[1:17:20] light switch and you know you're
[1:17:22] reaching way down here and the light
[1:17:23] switch is up there you're reaching up
[1:17:24] here it's a this is a house that you
[1:17:26] live in this is something that you deal
[1:17:28] with every day but yet in the darkness
[1:17:30] it becomes unfamiliar it becomes it
[1:17:32] becomes uncertain and it brings doubt
[1:17:34] you know you've traveled to a place in
[1:17:36] the in the day I think that's always
[1:17:39] funny when you go to a place that you
[1:17:41] haven't been to maybe that that
[1:17:42] regularly and in the day it's so clear
[1:17:44] because you can you know this landmark
[1:17:45] here in this buildings here okay that's
[1:17:48] great but then you got to come back from
[1:17:50] that place in the dark you know maybe
[1:17:52] you go to someone's house and you know
[1:17:54] for dinner and you go there and in the
[1:17:56] light and you come back in the dark wow
[1:17:58] it seems like a totally different place
[1:18:00] you know now I can't see all of the same
[1:18:02] landmarks that I used to identify the
[1:18:04] way on the way there you know now I'm
[1:18:06] not quite sure
[1:18:06] oh that's what really looked like the
[1:18:08] right corner it doesn't you know I don't
[1:18:10] really know you can't see that far off
[1:18:12] and you know maybe only you know you can
[1:18:14] see what's illuminated in your headlight
[1:18:15] but that's it you know you don't have as
[1:18:18] much clarity it so starts to make its
[1:18:19] history this is the return am i going
[1:18:21] the right way it's that uncertainty it
[1:18:24] makes it difficult to see the path
[1:18:26] clearly and that's really a great
[1:18:29] analogy for the world because the light
[1:18:31] of God's been rejected and spiritual
[1:18:33] darkness has brought a lot of doubt and
[1:18:36] uncertainty in the same kind of way you
[1:18:38] know things that were absolutely clear
[1:18:40] in the light of the past are now doubted
[1:18:43] and questioned and looked at differently
[1:18:45] you know think it was so clear a hundred
[1:18:47] years ago you know what marriage was it
[1:18:49] was so clear what you know raising a
[1:18:51] child was supposed to be like it was so
[1:18:53] clear how the school system should be
[1:18:54] said I mean all those things were so
[1:18:56] clear and they worked and they worked
[1:18:58] well but now it's so uncertain
[1:19:00] like oh well you know how do we define
[1:19:03] this
[1:19:03] how do we know this what oh maybe this
[1:19:05] could be just as good as that why
[1:19:07] because there's a state of confusion of
[1:19:09] darkness and it's really no wonder that
[1:19:12] the worlds in this confusion because
[1:19:14] people have lost most of the things they
[1:19:16] used to identify themselves in that
[1:19:20] darkness they've lost most of the things
[1:19:22] they used to identify themselves you
[1:19:25] know when you look at the founding
[1:19:27] fathers you know when we were in we were
[1:19:28] in Boston last year and we saw some of
[1:19:30] the things around you know when the
[1:19:32] United States found independence and and
[1:19:35] sister Jane this is for you I'm sister
[1:19:38] Priscilla yeah get a little American
[1:19:42] history in there but when we were there
[1:19:44] we you know we got to see some of the
[1:19:47] things a Paul Revere and and you know
[1:19:49] Samuel Adams and all these different
[1:19:51] founding fathers but it was important to
[1:19:53] them freedom of religion and what that
[1:19:56] meant to them meant that they could
[1:19:57] serve God without you know any creeds or
[1:20:00] doctrines and and things getting in the
[1:20:02] way that's how that's how they founded
[1:20:04] freedom of religion was the freedom to
[1:20:06] serve God with all your heart and not
[1:20:08] have anybody stop you but look at today
[1:20:12] what freedom of religion me freedom
[1:20:14] religion means you can you can live any
[1:20:16] way that you want you know in any kind
[1:20:18] of Filth and sinfulness and all of those
[1:20:20] things and still call yourself a
[1:20:21] Christian because you have freedom of
[1:20:23] religion you know I was reading about
[1:20:25] this this younger man who is who had
[1:20:28] grown up in church his father was a
[1:20:29] pastor as uncle was a pastor and big
[1:20:34] disgrace and everything rocks the church
[1:20:36] and and he he grows up and he takes the
[1:20:38] pastor ship over but he wants to reach
[1:20:40] out to new audiences so he's he's in his
[1:20:43] Christian Church right on the
[1:20:45] stained-glass windows above the the
[1:20:47] pulpit
[1:20:48] they've got symbols of Judaism they got
[1:20:51] symbols of Buddhism Muslim symbols cross
[1:20:54] all of these things and they're all on
[1:20:56] different panes of the window and yet
[1:20:59] you know he could present that as you
[1:21:01] know a religion that their freedom to
[1:21:03] worship however they want and present
[1:21:06] that as righteousness present that that
[1:21:07] that's the kind of principles that the
[1:21:09] founding father stood for but it's not
[1:21:12] at all what they stood for
[1:21:14] no to those men that that form the
[1:21:16] Constitution that wrote those things the
[1:21:17] way it was clear was playing it was they
[1:21:20] could see clearly what they want to
[1:21:21] accomplish but in this world of darkness
[1:21:23] it's become so confused that you know
[1:21:26] people can look at that and say oh what
[1:21:27] a blessing that is that's not a blessing
[1:21:29] in the eyes of God that's absolute
[1:21:31] wickedness to mix all of those things
[1:21:33] together and say God accept you any way
[1:21:35] that you want to come your families used
[1:21:39] to be so strong and God put those things
[1:21:42] in place God put a mother and a father
[1:21:43] together to raise a family because there
[1:21:46] was stability in that there were
[1:21:47] strengthened that just from even a
[1:21:49] natural perspective they were
[1:21:50] strengthened that but you know the world
[1:21:52] has has so twisted that has broken the
[1:21:55] unity of that you know your even your
[1:21:57] name your last name you would follow you
[1:21:59] from your parents who you know it came
[1:22:02] from their grandpa you know from from
[1:22:03] their grandparents to their parents to
[1:22:05] them now to you to your children it
[1:22:07] would pass on and give an identification
[1:22:09] of where you came from and where you
[1:22:11] belong you know now you go through a
[1:22:13] school and you know this kids got one
[1:22:15] last name but his sibling has a
[1:22:17] different last name and the mother has a
[1:22:20] different last name and the stepdad has
[1:22:22] a different last name and you know
[1:22:23] they're always on vacation because
[1:22:25] they're going to dad's one week and
[1:22:27] mom's the other week and you know
[1:22:29] they're not quite sure who's looking
[1:22:30] after them this time and you know they
[1:22:31] have a different house that they stay at
[1:22:33] be able to it's such a confusion no
[1:22:35] wonder there's no stability in that no
[1:22:38] wonder people are looking for you know
[1:22:40] something to identify with because
[1:22:42] there's no strength in where they come
[1:22:44] from there's no stability there's no
[1:22:46] identification to point you and say this
[1:22:48] is where I belong no sense of
[1:22:54] identification it doesn't give you that
[1:22:57] sense of belonging and strength you know
[1:22:58] the more that you have a stable home
[1:23:03] that's United around the Word of God the
[1:23:06] more content and satisfied your children
[1:23:08] will be in that home because they know
[1:23:11] what it represents they know what it
[1:23:13] stands for and they have an attachment
[1:23:15] to it but the more confuse it is the
[1:23:18] more disrupted it is the more the more a
[1:23:21] darkness there is there the more mix of
[1:23:23] God and worldliness there is the less
[1:23:27] and less it
[1:23:27] and so kids look for a different place
[1:23:31] to identify themselves they look for a
[1:23:32] different group to satisfy that sense of
[1:23:35] belonging and so you know the kids from
[1:23:37] the most broken homes are usually the
[1:23:40] ones that end up with the wildest
[1:23:42] manifestation of that why because
[1:23:43] they're just desiring so much to belong
[1:23:45] to something and there's nothing for
[1:23:50] them to belong they they don't see it
[1:23:51] anywhere they can turn so they find it
[1:23:53] in school they find it in you know their
[1:23:55] their friends they find it in movies and
[1:23:58] entertainment they find it in the rock
[1:23:59] star you know there's a reason that they
[1:24:01] want to grow up and be just like that
[1:24:03] rock star because it looks like they can
[1:24:05] belong they can identify with something
[1:24:07] they can recognize something the
[1:24:15] darkness of this world that just makes
[1:24:17] so many things confusing that's why we
[1:24:18] see such a great rise in homosexuality
[1:24:20] you know it fills every part of the
[1:24:23] world now music and movies and the news
[1:24:25] and local news and and national news and
[1:24:27] all over the places everywhere you go
[1:24:30] everything you could you know be reading
[1:24:32] it about the score of a hockey game and
[1:24:34] they'll be right on that same page a
[1:24:36] reference of some athlete that you had
[1:24:38] to go and you know express to the world
[1:24:40] you know their wickedness and and it's
[1:24:42] just everywhere you go in the most you
[1:24:44] know unlikely places in this school so I
[1:24:47] don't know back home they have what are
[1:24:50] the canonical gay and lesbian alliance
[1:24:54] in the school you know so that the kids
[1:24:58] who don't have an identity the kids that
[1:25:00] don't have an identification can have a
[1:25:02] group that will support them you know
[1:25:05] and will give them a sense of belonging
[1:25:06] why does it come from because people
[1:25:09] have lost their identification they've
[1:25:10] lost their identification in the Word of
[1:25:12] God in their family and everything else
[1:25:14] is so broken down you know it used to be
[1:25:17] they only talked about gay rights then
[1:25:18] it's gay and lesbian right then it's gay
[1:25:21] lesbian and bisexual rights and
[1:25:23] transgender and this they just add more
[1:25:25] and more things to it all the time why
[1:25:27] because it's more and more confused all
[1:25:29] the time you know I I had noticed in in
[1:25:31] articles that they were calling it LGBTQ
[1:25:35] and it just added another letter on
[1:25:38] there so I went looked it up and and Q
[1:25:40] stands for
[1:25:41] Janee I thought isn't that doesn't that
[1:25:44] just capture it though
[1:25:46] questioning confused you know that's
[1:25:50] that's the the lack of identification in
[1:25:52] this world it makes everyone question
[1:25:54] you know people don't have anything to
[1:25:56] identify so they begin questioning you
[1:25:59] know naturally speaking we see that
[1:26:00] definitely but spiritually speaking we
[1:26:02] see the same thing people are
[1:26:04] questioning you know Who am I where do I
[1:26:09] belong where do I fit in what you know
[1:26:12] what identification do I have
[1:26:13] and it's very confused you know it's
[1:26:16] it's it's so mixed up to them they're
[1:26:18] you know and they're going to ask you
[1:26:20] know what's right and instead of saying
[1:26:21] well this is what's right you know they
[1:26:24] ask their parents well you know what's
[1:26:26] right okay well you know just be who you
[1:26:29] are just be however you want to be you
[1:26:30] know that that's the response they're
[1:26:33] looking for a direction but the
[1:26:35] direction is just well you know whatever
[1:26:36] you feel you know what whatever you
[1:26:38] whatever you think you know will support
[1:26:40] you you know if your if your
[1:26:41] two-year-old boy wants to wear dresses
[1:26:43] and you know you know grow his hair long
[1:26:46] you curl it for him and you braid it for
[1:26:48] me no that's that's perversion and yet
[1:26:52] that's the reality of the world looks at
[1:26:55] that and says oh isn't that wonderful
[1:26:56] they support his little decision to you
[1:26:59] know to identify himself in a way that
[1:27:01] he's comfortable but it's perverse it's
[1:27:05] darkness but it comes from a lack of
[1:27:08] identification where is the parent to
[1:27:10] say you're a boy
[1:27:12] God made you a boy and you act like a
[1:27:15] boy you know you know these are the
[1:27:17] characteristics you were born with and
[1:27:19] this is this is what God made you this
[1:27:21] is what you are you know you're a girl
[1:27:23] you know this is the characteristics God
[1:27:25] made you with you know you'll act like
[1:27:26] that you'll conduct yourself like that
[1:27:28] but parents that would stand for you
[1:27:30] know stand against the school system
[1:27:32] because they don't provide you know then
[1:27:34] access to the washrooms of the gender
[1:27:37] that that child doesn't even belong to
[1:27:38] at home - you know I'd heard about it in
[1:27:41] the States before but even at home there
[1:27:42] was one you know a boy that that
[1:27:44] identified as a girl and they this the
[1:27:48] parents were pressing the school to
[1:27:50] allow that boy to use girls washrooms
[1:27:53] because he identified as a
[1:27:55] you know and the school responded by
[1:27:58] letting him use a washroom that was just
[1:28:00] a single person washroom say hey he can
[1:28:03] go to the washroom he can you know we're
[1:28:05] not going to prevent him from go to the
[1:28:06] washroom we'll let him use this washroom
[1:28:08] here and it's all by himself
[1:28:10] no that wasn't good enough parents
[1:28:12] pulled the child out of school and
[1:28:13] everything because they weren't
[1:28:15] supporting his right to identify himself
[1:28:19] as a girl it shows you how perverted and
[1:28:22] twisted this world is it doesn't make
[1:28:25] any sense at all it doesn't even make
[1:28:28] common sense but that's just how twisted
[1:28:30] and bent this world really is you know
[1:28:35] it's so dysfunctional you know we need
[1:28:41] to be careful though because that same
[1:28:44] kind of confusion that same kind of
[1:28:45] questioning can come right right into
[1:28:47] the church where you know the Word of
[1:28:50] God gets a questioned and the end and
[1:28:53] you know doubted and and you know the
[1:28:56] things that people want stood for is not
[1:28:58] all that's not so important anymore you
[1:29:00] know well I know you're coming to church
[1:29:03] I know the pastor preaches that and I
[1:29:04] know there's a quote for and I know
[1:29:05] there's Bible for it but you know I
[1:29:07] don't really feel like you know that
[1:29:09] identify with that you know in my house
[1:29:11] we're gonna do it this way instead you
[1:29:13] know in my house you know it's okay for
[1:29:15] us to do this it's okay for us to you
[1:29:17] know just not to pay close attention to
[1:29:20] that part of the work
[1:29:21] what is it's questioning its doubt it's
[1:29:24] the same kind of confusion of
[1:29:26] identification that we see in the world
[1:29:28] the character of God's being changed by
[1:29:31] preachers you know by preachers but you
[1:29:33] know I'm brother have talked about the
[1:29:34] indictment you know you talked about
[1:29:36] crucifying Jesus again he didn't put
[1:29:39] that on the on the lady didn't put that
[1:29:41] on the people that were sitting in the
[1:29:42] pews he put it on the preacher for
[1:29:44] changing the Word of God for for
[1:29:47] changing the image of Christ into
[1:29:49] something else to please the people and
[1:29:51] that's what we've done you know what
[1:29:53] what preachers have done they say Jesus
[1:29:55] loves you no matter what you know he'll
[1:29:57] bless your sinful lifestyle he'll bless
[1:29:59] your gay marriage he'll give place to
[1:30:01] your worldly desires
[1:30:02] you know churches that have the name of
[1:30:05] Jesus Christ right in their title and
[1:30:07] yet they have
[1:30:08] identification in Christ at all you know
[1:30:11] what Church of Christ and there's no
[1:30:13] price there but writing the message even
[1:30:17] you know people aren't sure if their
[1:30:19] identification comes from their family
[1:30:21] or the church or their pastor or brother
[1:30:25] branham or Jesus not sure they're not
[1:30:29] they're not sure where their
[1:30:30] identification really comes from you
[1:30:33] know and where there's a confusion of
[1:30:34] identification there's also dysfunction
[1:30:36] in the church because if your
[1:30:38] identification comes from family you'll
[1:30:40] put that ahead of God you know when when
[1:30:43] the word comes down and speaks about
[1:30:45] your child when the word comes down
[1:30:47] speaks about your wife your husband say
[1:30:50] oh well I won't let it go that far you
[1:30:53] know I'll listen when it's about the
[1:30:55] brother sitting next to me or the sister
[1:30:56] sitting next to me or that one in that
[1:30:58] pew oh it's really important but when it
[1:31:00] comes to my family I'm just gonna let
[1:31:04] them go you know I'm just gonna say it's
[1:31:06] okay I'm just gonna you know don't touch
[1:31:08] my family why it's putting that in front
[1:31:11] of God because that's what people think
[1:31:13] it is you know we see that so much the
[1:31:15] world even is bent that way family
[1:31:18] family family family family is very
[1:31:21] important but God is more important you
[1:31:24] know the sweet Jesus that you know loves
[1:31:26] everybody and you know just brings a
[1:31:28] smile to everyone's face that jesus said
[1:31:32] that if you if you don't hate your
[1:31:34] father and mother and your children then
[1:31:36] you're not worthy to follow him and then
[1:31:39] he wasn't saying hate your children hit
[1:31:41] your your parents he was saying that if
[1:31:43] you don't put him first if you aren't
[1:31:44] willing to forsake all others to follow
[1:31:47] him you're not worthy of him so you know
[1:31:51] the kids events to get in the way of
[1:31:53] church you know the kids priorities to
[1:31:55] get in the way of serving God you know
[1:31:57] activities that take away all the
[1:31:58] devotion time and all of those things if
[1:32:01] that's interfering with the word of God
[1:32:03] shows you your identification is wrong
[1:32:06] you've made your identification your
[1:32:08] family instead of Christ you know if
[1:32:12] your church is your identification you
[1:32:14] know no matter what turn and and twist
[1:32:16] the church takes you'll go right along
[1:32:18] with it
[1:32:19] you know you whatever the church said
[1:32:20] well everybody in the church is on
[1:32:22] you know this one in the church is doing
[1:32:24] that and this one's in the church doing
[1:32:25] that I guess it's okay for me that's if
[1:32:28] your identification comes from the
[1:32:29] church but that's not the way Jesus told
[1:32:31] us to live make your calling and
[1:32:35] election sure don't make brother
[1:32:37] so-and-so is calling election sure well
[1:32:39] I just trust in him or I just trust in
[1:32:41] that sister because she's just sweet and
[1:32:43] you know loving she just has such a good
[1:32:45] attitude I'm just gonna follow her you
[1:32:46] know in the way she does it know there's
[1:32:48] an identification with Christ my brother
[1:32:50] doesn't go won't hinder me the little
[1:32:52] songs that you know my sister doesn't go
[1:32:54] won't hinder me sure it hurts us you
[1:32:56] know it it can bother us it can give us
[1:32:58] conflict but if our identifications
[1:32:59] really in Christ we're not gonna be
[1:33:02] confused by those things we're all both
[1:33:05] at that brother Lyceus family do that
[1:33:07] that sister does that this one does that
[1:33:09] well our eyes focused on Christ we won't
[1:33:12] have that problem if your identification
[1:33:15] comes from your pastor or another
[1:33:16] minister you'll hold to them instead of
[1:33:18] to God you'll have confidence only as
[1:33:21] long as they lift you up and even if
[1:33:23] your identification comes from brother
[1:33:25] Branham you know a lot of message
[1:33:27] believers think that's all you need
[1:33:29] I just believe in a prophet what Oh what
[1:33:31] do you believe I just believe God sent
[1:33:32] prophet I believe in the message all of
[1:33:34] that but yet your strength your power
[1:33:40] doesn't come from brother branham's
[1:33:42] vindication you're not overcoming
[1:33:46] daughter or son of God because seven
[1:33:49] angels met brother Branham though that's
[1:33:52] wonderful and it was a vindication of
[1:33:53] his ministry though the pillar of fire
[1:33:55] was taking a picture of brother Branham
[1:33:57] when I run into trouble when I'm in
[1:33:59] conflict when I need string I need the
[1:34:01] pillar of fire in my life you know it's
[1:34:03] wonderful that it hung over brother
[1:34:05] Branham it's wonderful if it hangs over
[1:34:06] any one of you but but it needs to be in
[1:34:09] my life it needs to be hanging in my
[1:34:11] heart that's where the pillar of fire
[1:34:12] needs to be in order to have strength
[1:34:14] and so I'm thankful and pleased to say
[1:34:17] that I belong to this message I'm
[1:34:18] thankful and and grateful to God that
[1:34:21] there was a ministry of brother Branham
[1:34:22] but I realized in my own life my life
[1:34:25] has to be identified in Christ I don't
[1:34:29] have strength because brother Brown gave
[1:34:31] life back to a fish that's a wonderful
[1:34:34] thing for that fish but I have strength
[1:34:36] God gave life to me and we love that God
[1:34:44] doesn't look at our sin that he looks at
[1:34:46] the blood we you know maybe you guys
[1:34:47] sing that song he wasn't looking at me
[1:34:49] when he took me in he was looking at the
[1:34:51] blood but he also doesn't regard your
[1:34:54] family he doesn't look at you and say oh
[1:34:56] well you come from good stock so you
[1:34:58] know that you know I'll just bless and
[1:35:01] leave you and everything else cuz your
[1:35:03] last name is such and so you know I know
[1:35:05] in this in this church there's a lot of
[1:35:06] coffees well guess what you know just
[1:35:09] because your last name's coffee doesn't
[1:35:10] mean it doesn't mean anything before God
[1:35:12] unless you have an identification in him
[1:35:15] you know am i back where I'm from
[1:35:16] there's a lot of Kiser's or family
[1:35:18] member it it doesn't do a thing before
[1:35:21] God because that's my last thing what
[1:35:23] what matters before God is if my life is
[1:35:26] identified it identified in here you
[1:35:30] know he doesn't look at your church oh
[1:35:31] you go to this church well I'll praise
[1:35:33] the Lord you're one of mine because you
[1:35:34] you go to evening light fellowship here
[1:35:36] you you know that that's you know you're
[1:35:38] blessed then because of that no you're
[1:35:40] not blessed because of that you're
[1:35:41] blessed if you're found in him you know
[1:35:45] this is or your pastor is you know this
[1:35:47] is who your prophet is there's no none
[1:35:48] of those things matter to God he's not
[1:35:50] looking at your sin but he's also not
[1:35:52] looking at your family he's not looking
[1:35:54] at your church he's not looking at who
[1:35:55] your pastor is he's looking at you and
[1:35:57] do you have an attribute of God in you
[1:35:59] that's being expressed
[1:36:01] you know the perversion of this world
[1:36:03] has created a society where you can
[1:36:05] change your identification that will a
[1:36:08] man can decide as I mentioned a little
[1:36:10] bit before that he actually identifies
[1:36:12] as a woman you know Amanda that's crazy
[1:36:15] the census sounds it sounds almost funny
[1:36:17] to me but it's sad because it's
[1:36:18] happening is that you know I could come
[1:36:20] up before you say well you know my name
[1:36:21] is Ben Brandon for the last 35 years but
[1:36:24] you know I actually got you know his
[1:36:26] identity and Mia I'd like you all to
[1:36:28] start referring to me as Brenda you know
[1:36:30] or I'd like you all to start referring
[1:36:32] to me as brandy you know and you know
[1:36:35] please you know respect that and you
[1:36:37] know everything else and I start wearing
[1:36:39] I was gonna start wearing dresses to
[1:36:41] church and start you know growing my
[1:36:42] hair out a little bit and you know and I
[1:36:45] start doing those things
[1:36:50] you know I started doing this it sounds
[1:36:53] ridiculous to the mind but this world's
[1:36:57] created such a condition that instead of
[1:37:02] reproaching those that would do
[1:37:04] something so ridiculous their approaches
[1:37:07] on you for standing against it their
[1:37:10] approaches on you if you won't call a
[1:37:12] man who is dressed as a woman with you
[1:37:14] know taking drugs to to manifest those
[1:37:17] things that the world will reproach you
[1:37:20] for not calling him her you know not
[1:37:23] referring to he eyes she they'll
[1:37:25] approach you and yet that's the
[1:37:27] perversion you know that that's how
[1:37:29] mixed up the situation is is that they
[1:37:31] would look at the one that's confused
[1:37:33] the one that whose identity is is all
[1:37:36] confused and mixed up and they would
[1:37:37] actually put that reproach on you for
[1:37:40] not recognizing and supporting it what a
[1:37:42] what a confused dark time you know you
[1:37:45] might have heard here as more on the
[1:37:47] west coast but there was a a woman who
[1:37:52] is the the local leader of the n-double
[1:37:56] a-c-p
[1:37:56] group in in a black rights group in the
[1:38:00] US and she had risen to the ranks of the
[1:38:03] leader of that local chapter and and it
[1:38:05] came out that she was actually not black
[1:38:07] at all she she was completely white she
[1:38:11] had no no genetics in her from any black
[1:38:13] races she was as white as I am and but
[1:38:17] sheet and her skin super ten and she got
[1:38:20] hair extensions and things and had her
[1:38:22] hair done in a way you know and and she
[1:38:24] called herself a mixed-race and
[1:38:26] everything and there wasn't a bit not a
[1:38:29] single bit of black genetics in her at
[1:38:31] all and so she had risen to a place
[1:38:33] where she was a leader where she was
[1:38:35] recognized as you know sort of a
[1:38:37] champion of a black rights and it just
[1:38:40] seemed like such a mixed up thing you
[1:38:42] know there was outrage of course when
[1:38:44] people when people heard about it like
[1:38:46] you know they'll be like that'd be like
[1:38:48] saying that you know the the leader of
[1:38:50] the Jews is is a German or you know they
[1:38:53] say that you know that like it did it
[1:38:56] seemed to make you know it didn't seem
[1:38:57] to make any sense at all but there was
[1:39:00] the same kind of representation
[1:39:02] her as there was for transgender or you
[1:39:06] know anything else there was people
[1:39:08] writing articles saying well if that's
[1:39:10] how she identifies herself if she
[1:39:13] identifies herself as a black person you
[1:39:16] know we should have we should respect
[1:39:18] that
[1:39:19] you know because in her heart that's
[1:39:20] what she really is what a mixed-up world
[1:39:24] we're in what a twisted world were in
[1:39:27] where where the characteristics and the
[1:39:30] qualities of your actual body your
[1:39:33] actual genetics and then by a choice you
[1:39:36] could just say no I actually am somebody
[1:39:39] entirely different you know come up
[1:39:42] before you actually you know I'm a you
[1:39:46] know pleased to be a black woman here
[1:39:48] this evening and you know just like it's
[1:39:51] just so ridiculous and yet that it's but
[1:39:54] what it is it's an indication of the
[1:39:56] darkness on this world and you know in
[1:40:00] the world it seems so extreme but in the
[1:40:01] church it can be so much more subtle you
[1:40:04] know people are choosing to make
[1:40:06] themselves Christians choosing to call
[1:40:08] themselves after the name of Christ and
[1:40:09] yet their actual characteristics don't
[1:40:13] match that at all you know right from a
[1:40:17] little child we're taught to identify
[1:40:19] things by their qualities you know this
[1:40:21] is a dog it's got four legs got tail
[1:40:23] it's kind of shaggy fur barks you know
[1:40:26] that that's what makes it a dog this is
[1:40:28] a cat because it makes a different sound
[1:40:30] it moves differently it's got different
[1:40:33] characteristic a different type of fur
[1:40:34] it's got different type of behavior
[1:40:36] that's what makes it different it's got
[1:40:38] different qualities you know you know
[1:40:40] they have different genetics different
[1:40:41] ways of acting but this world is telling
[1:40:44] us that no matter what your physical
[1:40:46] characteristics are you can choose to be
[1:40:48] whatever you identify yourself at and
[1:40:51] people do that exact same thing with God
[1:40:53] in fact whether Bram says even in 1963
[1:40:56] he said we rock now after 2,000 years
[1:41:03] friends we're closing now after 2,000
[1:41:06] years man is determined to have his way
[1:41:08] he's made himself a charter he made
[1:41:10] himself man-made ethic and what did he
[1:41:13] do
[1:41:14] there has become by it a great falling
[1:41:15] away from
[1:41:16] the truth the people don't know what to
[1:41:18] do that sounds exactly what Jesus said
[1:41:20] you know people don't know what where
[1:41:21] they're going they don't know what
[1:41:22] they're doing in darkness you said
[1:41:24] they'll take this part of it but won't
[1:41:25] take that part of it they don't follow
[1:41:27] the Charter therefore they lose the
[1:41:29] course and after all these years when we
[1:41:31] got nine hundred and something different
[1:41:33] organizations of Christianity and each
[1:41:35] one condemning the other and saying this
[1:41:37] is right and they're wrong and this is
[1:41:39] right and that's wrong and so forth and
[1:41:40] the poor people are so confused they
[1:41:43] don't know what is right and wrong
[1:41:45] that's an incredible thing by them I was
[1:41:47] saying that in 1963 when people were a
[1:41:50] lot more identified by their
[1:41:51] characteristics than they are today you
[1:41:53] know brother Brown pointed to over 900
[1:41:55] denominations in this time you know one
[1:41:57] place I was looking through trying to
[1:41:59] find the references to it in one place
[1:42:00] he says 969 but most other places he
[1:42:02] just says that it's you know in the nine
[1:42:04] hundreds or it's over nine hundred that
[1:42:06] seems like a lot 900 different ways of
[1:42:09] looking at the scripture that sounds
[1:42:11] like an awful lot except that I looked
[1:42:14] up how many there are today simple
[1:42:17] google search you know how many
[1:42:18] denominations are there well there's
[1:42:20] lots of different numbers floating out
[1:42:21] there but as high as 38 that was in
[1:42:24] different denomination from 900 which
[1:42:31] sounded like a lot you know and and
[1:42:37] detailed information on 9000 there was
[1:42:40] 9,000 different detailed differences and
[1:42:43] denominations that's one website had a
[1:42:46] list uh you know what does that tell us
[1:42:49] it tells us that people are choosing to
[1:42:51] identify themselves as Christians by
[1:42:53] their own definition
[1:42:56] you know they're Christians they'll tell
[1:42:58] you with all their heart they're
[1:42:59] Christians they're saved they're born
[1:43:01] again they're all of these things and
[1:43:03] yet it's completely by their own
[1:43:05] definition you know I'm a Christian
[1:43:08] absolutely full but I don't believe this
[1:43:09] and they don't believe that and I don't
[1:43:10] believe this part of the world I don't
[1:43:11] believe that well we don't really
[1:43:13] believe baptism that way and we don't
[1:43:14] really believe Holy Spirit that way and
[1:43:16] we don't really receive you know we
[1:43:17] don't believe this we don't believe that
[1:43:18] but I'm a Christian absolutely why it's
[1:43:22] it's choosing an identity for themselves
[1:43:25] that fits their own choices living
[1:43:28] however they see fit and slapping
[1:43:29] whatever label they most desire on their
[1:43:31] lives and right in the message people
[1:43:34] are doing that as well
[1:43:35] you know people choose churches that fit
[1:43:37] the kind of identity they want for
[1:43:39] themselves you know this is the kind of
[1:43:40] church that I want to go to because you
[1:43:42] know they preach it more more the way
[1:43:44] that I believe it why is it the way that
[1:43:47] the Bible teaches or is it the way that
[1:43:49] you believe it is it the way that the
[1:43:51] Word of God is preached or oh you know
[1:43:52] or is it just that they let you get away
[1:43:54] with more do they let you live a life
[1:43:55] however you want to live and still call
[1:43:57] you a message believer you know what
[1:43:59] what kind of identification are you
[1:44:01] truly trying to make you know I'm all
[1:44:04] for people changing churches as long as
[1:44:06] whether they're going is because they
[1:44:08] truly believe that God's gonna lead them
[1:44:10] and guide their life to be in His image
[1:44:14] if you're leading to any other image if
[1:44:16] you're leading to any other
[1:44:17] identification then then stay away from
[1:44:20] it you know stay where you are stay
[1:44:21] where God can leave you and and preach
[1:44:24] the word to your soul you know it's
[1:44:27] perfectly acceptable in society to do
[1:44:29] that and it's it's perverting the minds
[1:44:31] of Christians because God still after
[1:44:34] all about thirty eight thousand
[1:44:35] denomination however many different
[1:44:37] flavors of the message god still only
[1:44:40] has one provided place of worship in
[1:44:42] Christ and he still only has one
[1:44:44] provided way that's coming through his
[1:44:46] word you know and so beyond any any way
[1:44:50] that you want to say it it's still not
[1:44:52] your up it's not up to you to identify
[1:44:53] God still has an identification and it's
[1:44:56] by his word you know if you read the
[1:45:00] book of Judges there's a phrase that
[1:45:02] they repeat a couple times in there and
[1:45:03] it captures it perfectly it says that
[1:45:05] the people did what was right in their
[1:45:07] own eyes
[1:45:08] it's
[1:45:09] when Moses had already come and laid out
[1:45:11] all the law Joshua had already led them
[1:45:14] into the Promised Land to place them and
[1:45:16] give them their inheritance all of those
[1:45:18] things and after that when those men
[1:45:20] were gone off the scene
[1:45:21] people went however that was right in
[1:45:24] their own eyes the word was already
[1:45:26] given the temple has already been
[1:45:28] established there was a there was a
[1:45:29] right way of worship there was a right
[1:45:31] way of truth and yet people just kept
[1:45:34] falling into that same condition
[1:45:36] whatever was right in their own eyes if
[1:45:38] you read through the book of Judges
[1:45:39] you'll find some pretty strange stuff in
[1:45:41] there you know stuff that doesn't belong
[1:45:42] at all with the word that Moses had laid
[1:45:45] out now there's a guy did it that went
[1:45:47] and got himself his own Levite to be a
[1:45:49] priest and set up an idol in his home so
[1:45:54] the same man as a Levite and an idol and
[1:45:58] made his own religion you know and and
[1:46:01] you know the Bible lays it out there
[1:46:03] that you know he he's got this and you
[1:46:04] know how he set it up and he was
[1:46:06] worshiping and I'm sure he felt very
[1:46:07] holy and very spiritual and everything
[1:46:09] because he went and got himself a
[1:46:10] preacher he went and got himself an idol
[1:46:12] you know and now he's got the best of
[1:46:13] both worlds he's got a religion you know
[1:46:15] that he's made for himself that's
[1:46:17] exactly to his liking but it was
[1:46:20] completely ungodly you know and that's
[1:46:23] the truth of it on the end no matter you
[1:46:25] can go and get yourself whatever Idol
[1:46:26] you want you can go get yourself
[1:46:28] whatever pastor you want that you know
[1:46:30] that fits your desires and does the
[1:46:32] Saints you can go you know and include
[1:46:35] however much of the world you want in to
[1:46:37] satisfy your desire but if it's not the
[1:46:40] Word of God in the end you know the
[1:46:44] people that that worship Bale that had
[1:46:46] the showdown with Elijah you know they
[1:46:48] were just as sincere as alive to us they
[1:46:50] were just as committed they cried out
[1:46:53] all day long for bail to hear them you
[1:46:55] know they cut themselves they did
[1:46:56] everything that they could they poured
[1:46:58] out their lives of blood you know to
[1:47:01] hear from their God but there was still
[1:47:03] only one God that answered with fire and
[1:47:05] it was according to the right order and
[1:47:08] word that Elijah had set up proverbs
[1:47:12] chapter 12 verse 15 says the way of a
[1:47:14] fool is right in his own eyes but even
[1:47:18] hearkened unto counsel is why
[1:47:20] you know no matter what you believe I'm
[1:47:24] sure you believe it cuz you think it's
[1:47:25] right but but the wisdom comes from
[1:47:28] hearing the Word of God and recognizing
[1:47:31] and examining the bowels of the examine
[1:47:33] yourself Bible says prove what's
[1:47:36] acceptable make your calling and
[1:47:37] election sure why because you need to
[1:47:39] take what you've heard you take what you
[1:47:40] hear in the word and then you examine
[1:47:42] and you check it against your own life
[1:47:44] and when those two things don't match up
[1:47:46] you don't push off the word instead you
[1:47:49] change your life and you cut off the
[1:47:51] things that are not of God until only
[1:47:53] the things of God remain that's that's
[1:47:56] how we receive the word that's how we
[1:47:58] really find truth but the way of a fool
[1:48:00] is right in his own eyes and if it's
[1:48:02] right in your eyes and you would never
[1:48:04] reject it I mean you never accept the
[1:48:05] Word of God that would change that that
[1:48:07] viewpoint like Jesus said of the
[1:48:10] Pharisees that they close their eyes so
[1:48:13] that they won't see you know they've
[1:48:15] they've turned it aside so that they
[1:48:16] don't have to deal with it you know if
[1:48:18] if we won't ever accept the Word of God
[1:48:20] to change us you know we'll just keep
[1:48:23] going on in that kind of condition and
[1:48:24] because we have a religious desire we
[1:48:27] think God's with us you know in the time
[1:48:30] that we live in and at least at home
[1:48:31] until recently the economy was born very
[1:48:33] well excuse me and people took a lot of
[1:48:40] confidence in it and people would look
[1:48:42] at their natural things the good job
[1:48:44] that they had that was well-paying and
[1:48:46] the house that they had in the vehicle
[1:48:47] they had and they would say I'm so
[1:48:49] grateful for God's blessings that's
[1:48:51] wonderful but their life is more worldly
[1:48:54] now than it's ever been
[1:48:55] their church attendance is dropping off
[1:48:57] they're too busy going at work and
[1:48:58] they're too busy you know going here and
[1:49:00] going there then is that really God's
[1:49:02] blessing it's not God's blessing if it
[1:49:05] makes you live a life other than the
[1:49:07] Word of God if it makes you if it makes
[1:49:09] you live a life that's worldly then I
[1:49:11] don't think that's God's blessing I I
[1:49:13] would look at it as the devil's trap if
[1:49:15] it if that's the case people think that
[1:49:19] God will simply accept their worship and
[1:49:20] life however they choose to give it your
[1:49:23] God will just got it God needs your
[1:49:25] praise so much then no matter how you
[1:49:27] give it to him you will take it what do
[1:49:30] you want you only take it according to
[1:49:33] his word
[1:49:36] in fact you know people that if you're
[1:49:39] not walking in the light of the word if
[1:49:42] you're not walking with an
[1:49:43] identification with Christ then there
[1:49:45] isn't even there isn't even blood for
[1:49:47] your sins
[1:49:48] John says here first John chapter one it
[1:49:51] says this then is the message we have
[1:49:53] heard of him and declare unto you that
[1:49:55] God is light and in him is no darkness
[1:49:57] at all if we say that we have fellowship
[1:50:00] with him and walk in darkness we lie and
[1:50:03] do not the truth but if we walk in the
[1:50:07] light as he is in the light we have
[1:50:10] fellowship one with another and the
[1:50:12] blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanseth
[1:50:15] us from all sin if we walk in the leg
[1:50:19] not if we walk in the light as we choose
[1:50:22] to walk in the light but if we walk in
[1:50:24] the light as he is in the light then we
[1:50:30] have that identification then we have
[1:50:32] the blood of Jesus Christ covering our
[1:50:34] sins then we had a fellowship with the
[1:50:36] same you know people always want more
[1:50:39] unity well get get your life identified
[1:50:42] in Christ and there'll be more unity
[1:50:44] with like-minded people there'll be more
[1:50:45] unity with other people who have
[1:50:46] received in the Christ the same way
[1:50:48] you've received it you know we would all
[1:50:52] pre engine and deny that we would except
[1:50:54] Satanist teaching we were to fight
[1:50:56] against a sea
[1:50:57] oh brother no I would never do that but
[1:51:00] one of the one of the fundamental
[1:51:02] teachings of Satanism is do what thou
[1:51:05] wilt shall be the whole of the law in
[1:51:07] other words do whatever you feel like
[1:51:09] doing
[1:51:09] but you know do whatever is right in
[1:51:12] your own eyes that's all that really
[1:51:14] matters that's that's Satanist teaching
[1:51:17] and yet people will do whatever is right
[1:51:19] in their own eyes and still call
[1:51:20] themselves Christian still do whatever
[1:51:22] is right in their eyes and call
[1:51:23] themselves a believer but only and
[1:51:26] anyone that steps over the boundaries of
[1:51:28] the word and proclaims they are still
[1:51:30] serving God are only deceiving
[1:51:32] themselves God's not surprised by that
[1:51:34] God's not confused by that God
[1:51:35] recognizes that and he won't identify
[1:51:37] himself with our ideas or our chosen
[1:51:40] lifestyle he only identifies himself
[1:51:42] with his word
[1:51:47] you know when it really comes down to it
[1:51:50] it only matters if he identifies you not
[1:51:55] if you identify him but if he identifies
[1:51:57] you you know and one of the most
[1:52:00] important teachings to me that brother
[1:52:01] Brown said in order for us is on
[1:52:03] adoption and when we think about this
[1:52:05] thought here of identification it I
[1:52:07] believe it becomes really clear why
[1:52:09] that's so important because you know the
[1:52:11] way that the the world's adoption work
[1:52:13] is that you know if you wanted to adopt
[1:52:15] somebody you would take somebody who
[1:52:17] doesn't have any of your genetics who
[1:52:20] doesn't have any of your traits might
[1:52:21] not be the same color skin might not you
[1:52:23] know come from the same part of the
[1:52:25] world might not come any of those things
[1:52:26] and you legally include them in your
[1:52:29] family and you say that this you know I
[1:52:31] could say if I was adopted child today
[1:52:33] say this is now a kisser but doesn't
[1:52:37] have any of the characteristics than any
[1:52:38] other catches have but this is now a
[1:52:40] cancer this this is an adoption now it's
[1:52:42] part of this family that if that was the
[1:52:45] way that God worked then he would have
[1:52:47] to accept anybody in any condition
[1:52:49] because he would have to accept you know
[1:52:52] the person that lives a sinful life and
[1:52:54] who you know just lives any way that
[1:52:56] they want to and then come to church and
[1:52:57] and raise their hands and worship he
[1:52:59] would have to accept that because he
[1:53:01] would have he would have made a way that
[1:53:02] people that were not his people that
[1:53:04] didn't have any of his qualities or his
[1:53:06] characteristics could come then and be
[1:53:09] accepted be part of God's family they're
[1:53:11] so important for us to understand that
[1:53:13] that's not the way that the adoption of
[1:53:15] God works the adoption of God doesn't
[1:53:18] work the way he you need to take
[1:53:19] somebody who doesn't belong who was
[1:53:21] never in his mind and makes them one of
[1:53:22] his sons or daughter no it only works
[1:53:24] that he takes those that were already in
[1:53:26] his mind before the foundation of the
[1:53:28] world those that were already part of
[1:53:30] him those that already had an attribute
[1:53:31] of him and he brings them to a state of
[1:53:33] maturity and then he puts his adoption
[1:53:35] on them to say they are just like me
[1:53:38] they are to a place where their
[1:53:40] character their life their all of their
[1:53:43] thinking in their their will has all
[1:53:45] been molded to my character that's my
[1:53:48] child that that's in the image in
[1:53:50] maturity and in power exactly the same
[1:53:53] as I am you know God is not God is not
[1:53:57] taking someone without
[1:53:58] spiritual genetics he's only taking
[1:54:00] those that were a part of him from the
[1:54:02] beginning that's the correct Bible
[1:54:08] teaching it doesn't work that way in
[1:54:09] order to be adopted by God you had to be
[1:54:11] part of him from the beginning adoption
[1:54:13] is a recognition
[1:54:14] you've come to a place where God has
[1:54:16] confidence in you you come to a place
[1:54:18] that God can say you know as brother
[1:54:20] Branham said you know his name on the
[1:54:21] checkbooks as good as mine you know
[1:54:23] you come to a place where you can say he
[1:54:25] would do it just exactly the way that I
[1:54:26] would do it she would do it exactly the
[1:54:28] way I would do it like Jesus said I do
[1:54:30] nothing about what the father shows me
[1:54:32] first that's the way that every son and
[1:54:34] daughter of come should come that's what
[1:54:36] full adoption is and we know of course
[1:54:38] the body changes included in that before
[1:54:40] this flesh will manifested as well but
[1:54:42] Paul says here when the fullness of time
[1:54:44] was come God sent forth his son made of
[1:54:46] a woman made under the law to redeem
[1:54:49] them that were under the law that we
[1:54:51] might receive the adoption of sons and
[1:54:53] because you are son
[1:54:55] not because you claim to be son not
[1:54:59] because you'd like to be son not because
[1:55:01] it would be nice to be sums but because
[1:55:03] you are sons God has sent forth the
[1:55:06] spirit of his son into your hearts
[1:55:08] crying Abba Father because you are a son
[1:55:11] of God because you are our daughter of
[1:55:12] God that's why God lets you walk in the
[1:55:15] light that's why God pulls those
[1:55:17] attributes out of you as you come and
[1:55:19] you feed on the word of God it's work
[1:55:22] it's because we're part of God in the
[1:55:24] first place that God puts his spirit in
[1:55:25] earth that God identifies us as his own
[1:55:28] and it's by maturing in our place as
[1:55:31] sons and daughters of God that we that
[1:55:32] were really recognized as fully adopted
[1:55:35] sons and daughters you know I've seen
[1:55:39] that firsthand the effective adoption
[1:55:41] the way that the world works and no
[1:55:42] matter what you can't you can't avoid
[1:55:44] this the adopted children and the
[1:55:48] natural children are never on the same
[1:55:50] never on the same level you know in the
[1:55:52] way the world works with natural
[1:55:54] adoption is that you know the adopted
[1:55:55] child is never the same as a blood child
[1:55:58] you just can't help because it's not the
[1:56:00] same genetics it's not the same life and
[1:56:02] then you know adoptive child might do
[1:56:04] really well and you know I have had lots
[1:56:06] of success but when they look at that
[1:56:07] blood child they see the same qualities
[1:56:09] that are
[1:56:10] them and there's an identification there
[1:56:12] that isn't there when you attach your
[1:56:14] name to somebody that doesn't have your
[1:56:15] genetics you know and that's the same
[1:56:17] with God people can call themselves
[1:56:19] Christian they can choose to define that
[1:56:21] however they want but when God looks at
[1:56:23] that he doesn't see anything that
[1:56:25] pleases him he only but when he looks at
[1:56:28] a life that's his he says oh I just
[1:56:30] that's just the same as me that's just
[1:56:32] the same quality the same
[1:56:34] characteristics the same life being
[1:56:36] expressed right there but the brown says
[1:56:39] needed the identified masterpiece of God
[1:56:41] says Jesus couldn't take the place
[1:56:43] talking about your place you remember
[1:56:46] when they read that in that day in the
[1:56:48] book in the temple when Jesus read the
[1:56:49] scripture he said he just read part of
[1:56:51] the prophecy left the rest of it for the
[1:56:53] last day we're supposed to take that
[1:56:55] part so you see he wants to cut the
[1:56:58] church out just like he did the Sun out
[1:57:00] like he did the bride and the groom to
[1:57:02] be his bride you must be part of him not
[1:57:05] part of the Creed that's the belief
[1:57:06] system not part of the church not part
[1:57:09] of the denomination but the part of him
[1:57:11] hewed out of any other kind of a form
[1:57:14] won't work you've got to be hewed from
[1:57:15] the word the world cut off of you and
[1:57:18] just leave the world word rather only
[1:57:20] live in you the great sculptor is
[1:57:25] counting on you willing to stand and
[1:57:28] have yourself shaped into the likeness
[1:57:30] of his requirement that his word
[1:57:32] requires in the last days I'll pour out
[1:57:34] my spirit upon all flesh your sons and
[1:57:36] daughters shall prophesy Christ is the
[1:57:38] identified masterpiece of the Word made
[1:57:40] flesh you are asked to identify yourself
[1:57:43] in him by the same word to be the
[1:57:47] masterpiece for the bride but I said now
[1:57:50] brethren God had a masterpiece then to
[1:57:52] present the world now he wants a
[1:57:55] masterpiece today are you willing are
[1:57:59] you ready my Christian friend are you
[1:58:01] really sure that your life is so
[1:58:03] reflecting for Christ no matter what the
[1:58:05] world says they say you lost your mind
[1:58:08] you've gone crazy you went and joined
[1:58:09] that bunch of holy rollers don't you pay
[1:58:11] no attention to that if you're not
[1:58:14] really truly saved and in that body and
[1:58:18] the Word of God in you and reflecting
[1:58:20] itself and the life of Christ reflecting
[1:58:22] out of you
[1:58:23] mother sister don't you take that chance
[1:58:25] I don't care what you are what kind of
[1:58:27] experiences you have let that word
[1:58:29] reflect through you each day because God
[1:58:31] in the last days is taking a bride for
[1:58:34] his son Jesus Christ then he says let us
[1:58:37] bow our heads and he prays here he says
[1:58:38] dear Heavenly Father such a crude way
[1:58:40] before an intelligent bunch of people my
[1:58:42] education is insufficient Lord I pray
[1:58:44] the Great Holy Spirit will sink these
[1:58:46] words into the people's heart that they
[1:58:48] will see what I mean if they couldn't
[1:58:49] understand in my way of chopping up
[1:58:50] things Lord but in my heart I see what
[1:58:54] you're trying to do I believe follow the
[1:58:56] bride must be part of the bridegroom she
[1:58:58] must be the same as the bridegroom for
[1:59:01] she is part of him she can never never
[1:59:05] be his bride until she becomes part of
[1:59:08] him that's a part of the word today and
[1:59:10] he says that says he's the same
[1:59:12] yesterday today and forever the corn of
[1:59:15] wheat that once that lived once in the
[1:59:17] earth and fell to the ground raised up
[1:59:19] in the likeness of the grain and went
[1:59:20] into the ground and Lord on the day of
[1:59:23] Pentecost there came a great church
[1:59:25] forth there came another grain of wheat
[1:59:27] to be made a bride groom and a bride for
[1:59:31] the last day hallelujah can you see your
[1:59:35] identification in that Paul says to the
[1:59:38] Ephesians he says for you are sometimes
[1:59:40] darkness but now are you light in the
[1:59:43] Lord as you said before now walk as
[1:59:47] children of light you know you're made
[1:59:50] light now walk as children of light say
[1:59:52] for the fruit of the Spirit is in all
[1:59:53] goodness and righteousness and truth
[1:59:55] proving what is acceptable unto the Lord
[1:59:58] when you walk in the light you're
[1:59:59] actually proving what's acceptable to
[2:00:01] the Lord you know when you stand-in in
[2:00:03] the power of the Word of God and you
[2:00:05] live your life according to the
[2:00:06] scripture and then what the the word has
[2:00:08] taught us you're actually proving to
[2:00:11] this world what's acceptable to God
[2:00:13] you know and if we if God doesn't have a
[2:00:16] light shining forth and he really can't
[2:00:18] even judge this world because he has
[2:00:20] nothing to compare it to but when he can
[2:00:22] raise up a bride we can raise up of
[2:00:23] people that had the same characteristics
[2:00:25] as him that stay within the borders of
[2:00:27] his word and he said and people say I
[2:00:29] didn't know that's what you wanted and
[2:00:30] he could say but I shone a light before
[2:00:33] you in the life of this person in the
[2:00:35] life of this sister
[2:00:36] the life of this brother I shown a life
[2:00:38] before you and you love darkness rather
[2:00:41] than light because I proved to you what
[2:00:44] was acceptable to the Lord
[2:00:45] I sent my own children I sent myself
[2:00:47] right there to show you and Paul
[2:00:50] continues on here and have no fellowship
[2:00:52] with the unfruitful works of darkness
[2:00:53] but rather reprove them for it is a
[2:00:56] shame to even speak of those things
[2:00:57] which are done of them in secret but all
[2:01:00] things that are reproved are made
[2:01:03] manifest by the light for whatsoever
[2:01:06] doth make manifest is light wherefore he
[2:01:10] saith awake thou that sleepest and arise
[2:01:13] from the dead and Christ shall give thee
[2:01:16] light Paul saying the same thing that
[2:01:18] that is it
[2:01:19] rise and shine your lights come you know
[2:01:21] wake up you wake up receive that
[2:01:24] resurrection life and shine forth as the
[2:01:27] children of the light that's what
[2:01:29] manifests light and dark that's what
[2:01:31] manifests good and evil is when the
[2:01:33] children of God walk as walk in the
[2:01:36] light your life proves what pleases God
[2:01:40] your fruit will be holy ghost' fruit
[2:01:42] your life will stand as both a testimony
[2:01:44] and as a judgment you know if you found
[2:01:47] your identification then awakened Christ
[2:01:50] will give you light if you haven't found
[2:01:52] your identification if you're still in
[2:01:53] that state of confusion whether rap says
[2:01:55] don't take that chance don't rest until
[2:01:58] you found that for yourself do what
[2:02:03] Peter says just as we finish up here
[2:02:05] he says for if these things be in you
[2:02:07] and abound they make you that you shall
[2:02:10] neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
[2:02:12] knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ but
[2:02:15] he that lacketh these things is blind
[2:02:17] blind is like being in darkness you
[2:02:19] can't see you don't have any frame of
[2:02:21] reference to go by he says and cannot
[2:02:24] see afar off and hath forgotten that he
[2:02:26] was purged from his old sins wherefore
[2:02:28] the rather brethren give diligence to
[2:02:30] make your calling and election sure for
[2:02:32] if you do these things you shall only
[2:02:35] fall 5 times a week you show to only
[2:02:38] fall every once in a while I says you
[2:02:40] shall never fall you shall never fall
[2:02:43] and I don't believe he's just talking
[2:02:44] about the flesh there you you know do
[2:02:46] these things and you'll never make
[2:02:47] another mistake nobody's saying you
[2:02:49] can't fall
[2:02:50] because you're identified in Christ you
[2:02:53] you can't fall because Jesus can't fall
[2:02:55] you can't fall because the God Himself
[2:02:58] can't fall and if you have an
[2:02:59] identification in him
[2:03:00] your flesh might make mistakes you
[2:03:02] you're gonna have to get down on your
[2:03:03] knees and repent sometimes you know
[2:03:04] maybe every every hour brother be prayed
[2:03:07] up you know not every day but every hour
[2:03:09] maybe every hour you've got to repent
[2:03:10] over something but that that life of
[2:03:13] Christ that's in you can never fall if
[2:03:16] these things are in you and abound no
[2:03:19] Jesus told the disciples you know he had
[2:03:22] sent them out and given them power to
[2:03:23] cast out devils and to you know heal the
[2:03:25] sick and all those things and they came
[2:03:27] back having a real rejoicing time
[2:03:29] because you know they found that oh man
[2:03:31] what happened you know oh well I went
[2:03:33] out today and I know this person was
[2:03:34] sick and I prayed for them and they were
[2:03:36] healed and you know what happened with
[2:03:37] you
[2:03:37] well I wind this person was possessed
[2:03:39] with the devil and I prayed for them and
[2:03:40] they were delivered and they were all
[2:03:42] rejoicing about that but Jesus didn't
[2:03:44] say oh yeah rejoice you know over the
[2:03:46] miracle no he said don't rejoice because
[2:03:49] the devil is over with you we're choice
[2:03:51] because your name is written in heaven
[2:03:53] because that's the important thing
[2:03:55] you know God God doesn't even care about
[2:03:57] the the the works per se except that
[2:04:01] you're identified in him when he looks
[2:04:04] at you he sees himself in action when he
[2:04:08] looks at your life he sees that's that's
[2:04:10] the same life the same power the same
[2:04:11] character and I will put mine my word
[2:04:14] behind that I'll put my authority behind
[2:04:16] that if you're identified in Christ you
[2:04:18] can't help but overcome you can't help
[2:04:21] but stand for Christ and you can't be
[2:04:23] lost you can't fall I think it's so
[2:04:26] important you know that we recognize
[2:04:28] that identification that we have in the
[2:04:31] Word of God you know not not just that
[2:04:33] you belong to this church your names on
[2:04:35] the church directory you know you're
[2:04:36] you're part of you know everybody knows
[2:04:38] your name and and there's an old some TV
[2:04:42] show you want to go where everybody
[2:04:43] knows your name but that's that's not
[2:04:46] what you know that's not what brings us
[2:04:48] identification because people know who
[2:04:50] we are they you know know know what
[2:04:52] family we came from but if there's
[2:04:54] anything that we know is that we're a
[2:04:56] part of God from the very beginning and
[2:04:58] that will shape everything that we do
[2:05:01] you know when we go out and the job
[2:05:03] we'll act just like Christ because
[2:05:05] that's our identification you know when
[2:05:07] we when we go out in the world we're you
[2:05:09] know we're not gonna be turned to the
[2:05:11] left of the right because we know where
[2:05:13] we come from we know where we belong and
[2:05:15] what it is to walk as a child level a
[2:05:17] man but stand tonight thank you for your
[2:05:22] kindness
[2:05:26] our heads Lord Jesus Oh father I just
[2:05:32] crave Lord to see more of these things
[2:05:35] become reality in our lives Lord Father
[2:05:39] I don't doubt that we've heard them time
[2:05:41] and time again we've read the quotes
[2:05:42] ourselves we maybe read these scriptures
[2:05:45] many times Lord but this is not
[2:05:48] about somebody else and what they did
[2:05:50] there's a fulfillment left for us of
[2:05:53] those things Lord
[2:05:54] there's a fulfillment left for your
[2:05:56] bride arise and shine for your latest
[2:05:58] come arise awake and walk as children of
[2:06:02] the light load that's for us and so
[2:06:05] father we don't want to just take it and
[2:06:07] and find interest in it to find
[2:06:11] stimulation and it lowered to our minds
[2:06:13] but father if we truly recognize where
[2:06:16] we've come from and what we're a part of
[2:06:18] Lorna and what you've already committed
[2:06:21] to us Lord Oh father how we'd walk
[2:06:24] differently how we come to church
[2:06:26] differently Lord how we'd see everything
[2:06:29] differently father and so I pray for
[2:06:31] Lord a reality of this word to sink into
[2:06:34] our hearts in a greater way Lord I pray
[2:06:36] you'd bless the people here Lord may you
[2:06:38] give them strength and encouragement
[2:06:39] Lord as we go through these services
[2:06:41] this weekend load not just to have said
[2:06:44] that we did them Lord but may we find
[2:06:46] strength in the old me we find
[2:06:48] encouragement and a challenge law to to
[2:06:50] walk closer to you than ever before Lord
[2:06:53] Lord I don't want to just keep going day
[2:06:55] by day going through my routine but lord
[2:06:59] I want lower not to just be looking for
[2:07:02] your coming but I want to receive your
[2:07:04] coming Lord I I want you to be here Lord
[2:07:06] and I want to go and Lord I want to go

[2:07:11] body but lord I believe there's just a
[2:07:13] greater urgency coming and I pray you
[2:07:16] just help us to grab

[2:10:13] nopal says in one place that he travails
[2:10:17] for the people until Christ be formed
[2:10:20] and formed in there not till they come
[2:10:23] to a knowledge of the doctrine that he
[2:10:25] was preaching or you know that they
[2:10:27] would come to understand what he's
[2:10:28] talking about come to understand what
[2:10:30] Jesus did until Christ was formed in
[2:10:32] there because when crisis formed in them
[2:10:35] then it's gonna grow it's a life of
[2:10:37] itself it's this power of itself and so
[2:10:39] that's how it is our Word of God

[2:13:36] a man he said I am the light of the
[2:13:38] world but it turns around says here the
[2:13:41] light of the world that's amazing
[2:13:43] I pray God drive that dead revelation
[2:13:45] down into our hearts tonight through
[2:13:47] what we have heard Minister tonight a
[2:13:49] man word onward onward on
[2:13:52] amen you can't leave one word out
[2:13:54] because if you do you're going to dim
[2:13:56] the light
[2:13:56] so don't leave this I would tell me that
[2:13:59] I you dim the light that don't have this
[2:14:02] and don't have that because next thing
[2:14:04] you're you're stuck tip the lights there
[2:14:06] because they're gonna cover this and
[2:14:08] cover that a man and I brothers left
[2:14:11] left it clear tonight
[2:14:13] concerning the light who is like what is
[2:14:17] the light where is the light what is God
[2:14:19] looking for ye are the light of the
[2:14:22] world right here do people want to know
[2:14:28] what the word is all about people want
[2:14:30] to know you know what what this word is
[2:14:32] doing and what God has done is doing
[2:14:35] will do for this word well he's
[2:14:37] reflecting it mean you and me it's so
[2:14:41] like it's shining for by the grace of
[2:14:43] God amen and just a couple of comments
[2:14:49] like I won't keep you long
[2:14:51] concerning walking in the light and we
[2:14:55] have to display the light publicly in
[2:14:57] all circumstances and situations a man
[2:15:03] because they're going to be challenged
[2:15:05] over there to do what's contrary to the
[2:15:08] world that's right
[2:15:10] again let me remind you of the time by
[2:15:14] the grace of God when when I was
[2:15:17] challenged and I was working over there
[2:15:19] in that department store and I was part
[2:15:21] of the management and in and that lady
[2:15:24] came in and she was looking for an
[2:15:27] article that she had returned and they
[2:15:30] had told her that they were going to
[2:15:32] send it back to the manufacturer get a
[2:15:34] replace and give it to her and she came
[2:15:37] back to me looking for it I didn't know
[2:15:42] anything about it so I went to others
[2:15:44] and they said oh that was suppose that
[2:15:47] I've been sent back but we still got it
[2:15:49] on the inside and tell her that we're
[2:15:53] still waiting to hear from them the
[2:15:55] manufacturers that we've got a setback
[2:15:57] they wanted me to tell her a lie and
[2:16:02] again that that brother that brother
[2:16:05] that individual is in management and I
[2:16:07] said listen if you want to tell a lie
[2:16:09] you tell her I said I'm not going to
[2:16:11] tell it and he said who are you working
[2:16:14] for I said I'm working for her
[2:16:15] I said not for you and so on so I
[2:16:19] assumed that he went and told the lie
[2:16:21] because I wasn't going to do it
[2:16:23] amen so where are you you've got you've
[2:16:26] got to let the light shine and display
[2:16:28] the light oh my god I saw who you are
[2:16:30] what you are
[2:16:31] I don't care if they're the Prime
[2:16:32] Minister of Canada I don't care if it's
[2:16:35] the President of the United States God
[2:16:37] requires the link hey man thank God for
[2:16:40] the Prime Minister of Canada taking his
[2:16:42] stand for Israel hey man I don't know
[2:16:45] whether or not his rough scripts are
[2:16:46] into it but maybe somewhere in the end
[2:16:48] then on the inside of the inside
[2:16:51] somewhere that's why he's defending
[2:16:53] Israel that's why he's taking his stand
[2:16:56] for Israel as well Israel as as has told
[2:16:59] the world that could to Canada because
[2:17:02] of their standing for us amen
[2:17:05] so it's you gotta let the light shine
[2:17:07] not be ashamed of it being the new thing
[2:17:10] is going to cost you your job you do it
[2:17:14] for Jesus sake because the hour is
[2:17:16] coming when you're going to be
[2:17:17] challenged you're going to be challenged
[2:17:20] will you believe this will you believe
[2:17:21] this and what did you do we can't argue
[2:17:24] when you allow this we allow that if you
[2:17:27] do if you want then we can tire you and
[2:17:30] I believe there was a store one time
[2:17:32] there in the air in the city a certain
[2:17:34] management a manager and I think he lost
[2:17:37] his job why because there came in a
[2:17:39] young man with ear rings in his ears and
[2:17:42] he wanted a job and he said well if you
[2:17:44] want to work here you got to take those
[2:17:46] earrings out and he any and he went to
[2:17:49] the government and he complained to the
[2:17:53] government I can't remember the
[2:17:54] department but the department you know
[2:17:56] that looks after the civil rights and
[2:17:58] all these things because they young man
[2:18:00] felt that he had a right to work
[2:18:02] anywhere and
[2:18:04] it wasn't anybody's business that he had
[2:18:07] earrings in his ears and anyway so after
[2:18:10] a while I went back and the management
[2:18:12] was gone and I maybe I believe that
[2:18:15] young man was hired why see that man
[2:18:19] it's true to his stain he didn't believe
[2:18:21] that maybe at a Christian stand but you
[2:18:24] gotta let the light shine even if it
[2:18:25] cost you your job
[2:18:27] amen Christ they tell his life can we
[2:18:32] lay down our jobs can we lay down our
[2:18:37] families and our friends he for shook at
[2:18:41] all then he may redeem us and we've got
[2:18:46] as I said I said we couldn't afford to
[2:18:49] purchase salvation but can we afford to
[2:18:51] possess it a man does a place I couldn't
[2:18:57] pay for for salvation it comes to
[2:18:59] purchasing it from the devil all the
[2:19:01] Crites could do that because he was born
[2:19:03] without sin but he imputed that that
[2:19:06] righteousness to me so I could possess
[2:19:08] it
[2:19:09] amen so can you afford to possess it
[2:19:13] because you're gonna lay aside every
[2:19:15] weight and every sin that a little
[2:19:17] section and run with paces the racist
[2:19:19] said before you by the grace of Almighty
[2:19:22] God you gotta make your calling and
[2:19:25] election sure you're gonna sacrifice any
[2:19:27] everybody and our brother brought it out
[2:19:29] and if you don't hate my mom dead son
[2:19:32] daughter or husband worried for my sake
[2:19:35] he says you're not worthy a man you
[2:19:38] gotta take up your cross and follow me
[2:19:40] amen we their brother were either the
[2:19:44] light or the darkness one or the other
[2:19:47] God is God looking for us to be the
[2:19:49] light of the world look what Jesus was
[2:19:51] now we're we're we're making our calling
[2:19:54] election sure we're fighting this place
[2:19:57] sure I'm not daddy you're gonna make
[2:19:59] your mistakes our brother brought it out
[2:20:01] and stumble here and stumble there and
[2:20:04] like I said it won't
[2:20:05] but if you're if you're an elective God
[2:20:07] and one interfere with your relationship
[2:20:09] they're still son and daughter and
[2:20:11] father and I interrupt your fellowship
[2:20:15] and repentance restores that again
[2:20:17] amen they gotta be got an advocate with
[2:20:21] the father praise the name of the Lord
[2:20:23] so we have my grace and I pray God help
[2:20:26] us tonight hearing what we have heard
[2:20:29] help us to walk in the light not
[2:20:33] occasionally continually amen as he is
[2:20:38] in the light and display it in all
[2:20:41] circumstances and in all situations amen
[2:20:47] no matter what it's going to cost you
[2:20:49] remember millions are gonna steal their
[2:20:51] testimony with their blood in the
[2:20:53] tribulation but God for the elect Minh
[2:20:56] for the bride as imputed his
[2:20:59] righteousness to us a man because he
[2:21:03] knows is alike this is going to walk in
[2:21:06] it and they're going to reflect the
[2:21:08] light now not judge no not reflecting
[2:21:11] because the Bible says what is the this
[2:21:14] is the moon shall shine as the Sun now
[2:21:18] it's reflecting Milady's the Sun but the
[2:21:21] hour comes when the moon shines as the
[2:21:22] Sun because the light that's in the Sun
[2:21:24] is going to be in the moon and the light
[2:21:26] that was in a straight brother he did it
[2:21:30] talking he talked about it right there
[2:21:32] cuz surely you know the first of the
[2:21:36] latter hey man hey man the Alpha and the
[2:21:40] Omega
[2:21:41] praise the name of the Lord good praise
[2:21:44] the name of the Lord
[2:21:45] let's recognize he I recognize who he
[2:21:48] was he knew who he was
[2:21:49] do you know who you were and he asked
[2:21:53] what he could do whatever principle
[2:21:56] hallelujah praise the Lord that's that's
[2:21:59] way that's why the pilot of Gaza that's
[2:22:02] why he said I can lay my life down and
[2:22:05] I'll pick it up again no man takes it
[2:22:07] from me why is it because he knew who he
[2:22:10] was and he
[2:22:11] where he come from he didn't lose his
[2:22:13] memory like us but the Holy Ghost give
[2:22:16] us our memory back
[2:22:17] amen and now is alpha as the Omega
[2:22:21] rather that we know where we come from
[2:22:23] we know where we're going
[2:22:25] hallelujah we're on our way home by the
[2:22:28] grace of God let's believe it as Jesus
[2:22:30] believe it
[2:22:31] les million is a that the faith of the
[2:22:34] latter be read be the same as the faith
[2:22:37] of the first by the grace of God going
[2:22:41] for spiritual Redemption on to physical
[2:22:43] Redemption
[2:22:44] even under the kingdom of God eternal
[2:22:48] brother brother BAM said just heard him
[2:22:54] on a tape last few days they said
[2:22:58] brother round you don't really you don't
[2:22:59] really want the world I envy him he was
[2:23:06] preaching this your brother brother
[2:23:07] branham that don't make sense you mean
[2:23:09] to tell me you want you want all this to
[2:23:11] finish now and and in now and he said I
[2:23:14] certainly do what he said surely you he
[2:23:18] says you you would like to go on a
[2:23:20] little bit further no he said I don't
[2:23:22] want him want any further but he said
[2:23:24] but he said most of the people of the
[2:23:26] world want the word of the law and they
[2:23:29] just want God to get him ready to die we
[2:23:32] want to get rid of them
[2:23:35] hallelujah just sing he had to deal with
[2:23:38] that and said he way back in 1961
[2:23:40] Rebecca in the 60s god help us on this
[2:23:46] list again let's give all we got let's
[2:23:50] dedicate everything we have to Jesus the
[2:23:52] will of God not my will Will's not worth
[2:23:56] nothing physically the devil is in it
[2:24:01] but the will of God amen
[2:24:05] that we walk in the light amen
[2:24:14] but there's so little light I thought of
[2:24:18] that when our brother was ministry
[2:24:20] there's so little like listen seriously
[2:24:28] there'll be so little light that the
[2:24:31] Bible says that God would have the time
[2:24:33] short part we no flesh say the Papa said
[2:24:38] there'd be no one here for the rapture
[2:24:39] he said of God never cut time short one
[2:24:42] cut time short but for the elects sake
[2:24:46] he saw I'll cut it short
[2:24:48] Wow because the light of the world is
[2:24:51] going out is getting darker and we're
[2:24:54] going into the eternal light by grace
[2:24:57] thank God for the revelation of the late
[2:25:06] to something else seems who mentioned
[2:25:09] and I'm glad he mentioned it it's a
[2:25:15] confirmation I want to say
[2:25:21] but Babel was the Lord it's a
[2:25:26] confirmation of what's been preached
[2:25:27] over this board many times but God will
[2:25:34] send somebody else and let you know it's
[2:25:37] not me it's him it wasn't brother
[2:25:42] Brandon it was Jesus Christ that spoke
[2:25:44] to you tonight we talked about the black
[2:25:49] woman and a white woman representing the
[2:25:53] black race I remember some years ago
[2:25:57] that there was a white woman that wanted
[2:26:00] to know what racism was like so she
[2:26:03] became black what she did I don't know
[2:26:06] it might be the same woman I don't know
[2:26:09] but she went out and of course and if
[2:26:13] she's still alive she's black today
[2:26:15] because of what she did so that she
[2:26:19] might identify with the black people and
[2:26:22] and so on
[2:26:25] now she now she knows or she knew what
[2:26:28] racism was like and because she went and
[2:26:32] became one of them but not in the sense
[2:26:37] that our brother was talking about that
[2:26:39] other black woman but you know
[2:26:42] hallelujah
[2:26:44] this would also tighten not that black
[2:26:48] woman she was pretending that Satan
[2:26:53] coming down in the Garden of Eden has
[2:26:57] Satan Judas the Satan into Judas Tyrians
[2:27:01] and pretended brother's around the
[2:27:02] message but this woman came to change
[2:27:07] their car to identify with our black
[2:27:09] brothers and sisters her black race and
[2:27:13] Jesus
[2:27:16] came down in flesh
[2:27:20] to identify with you and me and in all
[2:27:24] points he was tempted as you and I what
[2:27:33] doesn't he deserve all you got sure he
[2:27:37] does it was a sacrifice for our brother
[2:27:41] Brandon to do what he did in the last
[2:27:44] couple of days and every to get to
[2:27:46] Newfoundland anyway you need to find it
[2:27:52] again no finally he gets lost in the fog
[2:27:59] and so on so but I brought our brother
[2:28:04] and he found it a man now he's on the
[2:28:13] rock god bless your brother but I want
[2:28:20] those leave you with a scripture that
[2:28:23] our brother read it's a real revelation
[2:28:29] that's good right praise the Lord for
[2:28:33] the word
[2:28:38] first John chapter one and he read verse
[2:28:43] five six and seven
[2:28:48] did you get the revelation this then is
[2:28:57] the message this then is the message
[2:29:07] when I brother read it I spy I underline
[2:29:10] those three or four words four or five
[2:29:12] words this is the message which we have
[2:29:17] heard of him
[2:29:18] it wasn't William Branham for Jesus
[2:29:21] Christ and declare unto you that God is
[2:29:30] light and in him is no darkness at all
[2:29:40] if you're born again you have no
[2:29:42] darkness in your soul it's in your flesh
[2:29:45] not in your soul if if we say that we
[2:29:53] have fellowship with him and walk that
[2:29:59] again is to walk willfully Bible says
[2:30:03] you know then I believe I did believe
[2:30:05] did not sin but they do not sin
[2:30:07] willfully God changed that your new
[2:30:15] birth he took the will to sin out and he
[2:30:18] brought in the Holy Ghost to give you
[2:30:21] the power and the anointing to know what
[2:30:23] seeing isn't to fight it coming up to
[2:30:28] the spirit fighting it in the flesh
[2:30:30] until we're change
[2:30:34] but he said and we say that we have
[2:30:36] fellowship with him and walk in darkness
[2:30:42] willfully in continuing we lie and do
[2:30:56] not the truth but notice verse 7 but if
[2:31:07] we walk in the light as he is in the
[2:31:14] light so he's not in that I'm there but
[2:31:18] he's in what you heard tonight you walk
[2:31:22] in that light as he's in them you walk
[2:31:26] in the light as he is in the light and
[2:31:29] notice what it produces if it doesn't
[2:31:37] produce this you're not walking in
[2:31:41] I don't care how much the person says I
[2:31:44] believe this and I believe that and I
[2:31:46] believe somebody this doctor of that
[2:31:48] doctor if this doesn't follow then you
[2:31:54] don't believe them in your head maybe
[2:31:57] but not in your heart but if we walk in
[2:32:01] the light as he is in the light we have
[2:32:06] fellowship one with another hey man
[2:32:19] the Holy Ghost in Christ the Holy Ghost
[2:32:23] in you and me we're one hey man let me
[2:32:31] say it again here we walk in the light
[2:32:34] as he is in the light we have fellowship
[2:32:37] one with another that's why we were
[2:32:42] there to fight there in the morning
[2:32:44] Pellissippi in that house
[2:32:48] amen and the blood of Jesus Christ His
[2:32:57] Son cleanseth us from all team they
[2:33:02] didn't put that first put that last
[2:33:06] because you gotta start walking in the
[2:33:08] light by faith then repent be baptized
[2:33:13] in his name you shall receive the gift
[2:33:15] of the Holy Ghost and that puts you in
[2:33:17] the body that's redeemed
[2:33:26] so you got to start walking in the light
[2:33:28] then you're a fellowship him with the
[2:33:30] body identifying with the body you're
[2:33:32] not ashamed of of the body amen and
[2:33:37] because you're in the body part of the
[2:33:39] body the blood of Jesus Christ
[2:33:40] continually Friends of us from all see
[2:33:44] because we're walking in the light then
[2:33:47] we stumble because we keep on walking in
[2:33:50] the light and the blood continually
[2:33:53] cleanse it out from all see you want to
[2:33:59] judge yourself tonight by the word make
[2:34:02] your call the election short tonight by
[2:34:04] the word go back to the scripture that
[2:34:06] our brother gave us in first John
[2:34:08] chapter 1 verses 5 and 6 and 7 amen
[2:34:14] that is the characteristics of those who
[2:34:17] are walking in the light that's that's
[2:34:20] the way we do it by the grace of
[2:34:21] Almighty God amen god bless you and god
