[42:30] that. Well done on the song. Praise the
[42:33] Lord. Well done.
[42:39] Spread your
[42:41] [Music]
[42:43] wings, little
[42:46] eagle, and
[42:49] fly.
[42:53] Amen. You weren't
[42:55] born for the
[43:00] valley. You were
[43:02] born for the sky. Let's stand. Let your
[43:10] trials get you
[43:13] down. Or drive your
[43:16] spirit to the
[43:20] ground. Mount up with
[43:23] [Music]
[43:25] wings, little
[43:29] eagle and fly.
[43:35] Spread your wings.
[43:39] Hallelujah. Little
[43:43] eagle and
[43:49] fly. You weren't
[43:52] born for the valley. Amen. You were
[43:59] born for the sky. Hallelujah.
[44:04] Don't let your
[44:07] trials get you
[44:10] down or drive your
[44:13] spirit to the
[44:17] ground. Mount up with
[44:20] [Music]
[44:21] wings
[44:23] with e.
[44:26] Amen. One more time. Let's sing it.
[44:29] Hallelujah.
[44:31] So spread your
[44:34] wings and God bless
[44:39] you and
[44:42] [Music]
[44:46] fly. You were
[44:48] born for the
[44:51] [Music]
[44:53] valley. You were
[44:55] born for the sky.
[45:00] Don't let your
[45:03] trials get you
[45:06] down. Or drive your
[45:09] spirit to the
[45:13] ground. Bound up with wings
[45:17] [Music]
[45:20] and go and fly.
[45:26] Hallelujah. Lord, that's the anointing
[45:28] on us this this age, Lord, in this time,
[45:31] this end time, Lord. There's four beasts
[45:34] that project your power and your
[45:36] authority, Lord. And we're under that
[45:38] eagle anointing in that last age,
[45:39] Heavenly Father. And it's not something
[45:41] that changes our circumstances, Lord.
[45:43] But it changes our position, Lord. It
[45:46] changes our view. It changes our
[45:47] perspective on things, Lord God. It's
[45:49] when we can rise above it, Lord, soar
[45:52] beyond it, Lord, to where it can't touch
[45:54] us anymore, Lord. That's when we rest in
[45:56] faith. That's when we fly by faith,
[45:58] Lord. That's when we're resting in the
[46:00] promises of the word, Lord, that you are
[46:02] yay and amen and you do what you say you
[46:04] will do, heavenly father. Lord, we're
[46:06] thankful this morning. We have a spirit
[46:08] within us that raises us. Lord, if we'll
[46:10] let it, Lord, if we'll let you do what
[46:13] you promised to do, it'll have the
[46:14] effect, heavenly father. So, I pray your
[46:16] grace to us this morning, Lord. Lift us
[46:18] higher, Lord. Let us see from a heavenly
[46:21] perspective, Lord. Let us see through
[46:23] your eyes. Let us see through the
[46:24] position that you placed us in where
[46:26] we're standing this morning, Lord God.
[46:29] Lord, bless your people, we pray. Have
[46:30] your way in the service. We ask in Jesus
[46:33] Christ's name we ask it. Amen. Amen. God
[46:36] bless you. Turn if you would to to
[46:38] Second Timothy chapter
[46:40] 1. 2 Timothy chapter 1. Amen. Enjoyed
[46:43] that special by the coffee family this
[46:44] morning. Certainly a whole family effort
[46:47] and uh really appreciated that. want to
[46:49] say happy Mother's Day to to all the
[46:52] fifth gospels here this morning. Amen.
[46:53] God bless you. Amen. It's certainly
[46:56] wonderful to have godly mothers and we
[46:58] might take this day to thank them, but
[47:00] we ought to thank them every day. We
[47:02] ought to be appreciative of the things
[47:03] that they do every single day. And we
[47:05] pray God bless you not just today, but
[47:07] every day as you stay in your position
[47:08] and are faithful to the word that he
[47:10] would just bless you and strengthen you
[47:12] day by day. Amen. Brother Garfield, I
[47:14] sure enjoyed the service on Wednesday.
[47:16] Had a wonderful time in the Lord.
[47:19] You know, we were listening to that long
[47:21] list of prayer requests that Brother Bob
[47:23] read out and I think that's the longest
[47:24] list we've had in a while and I was
[47:27] talking to my wife afterwards. She said,
[47:28] and I felt the same way that it feels
[47:31] like we're under attack. Feels like
[47:33] we're under attack. And then we have
[47:34] somebody that comes and preaches about
[47:36] the great conflict. Amen. So, I
[47:38] appreciate that, Brother Garfield. I
[47:39] feel it was very timely. Amen. Let of
[47:41] the Lord. And I appreciate it. It was
[47:43] good for me personally. It's been a
[47:45] struggle for me the last few weeks and
[47:47] months, even this last week, and
[47:49] certainly with my eye, but I've got a
[47:51] sinus problem. I've got a throat
[47:53] problem. I've got a foot problem. My
[47:56] wife's not here. You talk about under
[47:59] attack. Amen. But I'm in perfect
[48:02] position this morning. Amen. I'm here to
[48:04] preach and it's not in my strength, but
[48:05] it's in my weakness that he can be made
[48:07] perfect. Amen. So, we're just trusting
[48:09] him. As I mentioned to most of you on
[48:12] the chat and texted a few of you that I
[48:14] do have eye surgery scheduled for May
[48:16] 20. So we thank the Lord for that. It
[48:18] has started to drain. So if you see me
[48:19] winking funny that it's just me trying
[48:21] to clear my eye while I'm preaching. But
[48:23] we're thankful that the Lord has made a
[48:25] way trusting that'll be the end of it
[48:26] and we can just move forward from there.
[48:28] But keep me in prayer in that. Amen. God
[48:31] bless you. Second Timothy 1 and verse
[48:33] three says this. I thank God whom I
[48:35] serve from my forefathers with pure
[48:38] conscience that without ceasing I have
[48:40] remembrance of thee in my prayers night
[48:42] and day. He's talking to Timothy now.
[48:44] Greatly desiring to see thee, being
[48:46] mindful of thy tears, that I may be
[48:48] filled with joy, when I call to
[48:50] remembrance the unfeigned faith, the
[48:54] sincere, the true faith, not the the
[48:56] non-hypocritical faith that that is in
[48:58] thee, he says, which dwelt first in thy
[49:01] grandmother Lois and thy mother Ununice.
[49:04] And I am persuaded that it is in thee
[49:07] also. This is the value of a believing
[49:09] mother passed down. You've got a
[49:11] grandmother that believed, a mother that
[49:12] believed, and now you've got Timothy
[49:14] who's a chosen vessel of God as well.
[49:16] And I don't have it up, but let's
[49:18] continue in verse 6 and 7. He says,
[49:19] "Wherefore I put thee in remembrance
[49:21] that thou stir up the gift of God which
[49:24] is in thee by the putting on of my
[49:26] hands. For God hath not given us the
[49:28] spirit of fear, but of power and of
[49:31] love, and of a sound mind." Amen. God
[49:34] bless you. You can have your seats this
[49:36] morning. And I I guess most people would
[49:38] know by now I don't do topical messages.
[49:41] I don't say that it's a certain holiday
[49:43] and therefore we're going to preach on
[49:45] something. And if you look back and I
[49:46] did go back and look, I don't think I
[49:48] preached a Mother's Day service since I
[49:50] moved here or a sermon since we moved
[49:52] here. But and so I don't just preach a
[49:54] sermon on mothers or fathers or these
[49:57] different things. But I was reading uh
[49:59] my Bible and my devotions the other the
[50:01] morning. This thought dropped in my
[50:02] heart. And so I felt to speak on it this
[50:04] morning. Now, I want to take a thought
[50:06] this morning of a mother's authority.
[50:08] Amen. A mother's authority. And I want
[50:10] to speak to our sisters this morning.
[50:12] And this is a real burden on my heart.
[50:14] I'm trusting the Lord will help me to
[50:16] get it out. But brothers, you don't get
[50:18] to check out. Amen. You don't get to
[50:20] check out because we're speaking to the
[50:21] mothers. Single sisters, you don't get
[50:23] to check out. Amen. This is for all of
[50:25] us because we're all the bride of
[50:27] Christ. Amen. It's going to apply to us
[50:28] in some form or the other. But I want to
[50:30] really focus on our mothers this
[50:32] morning, on our our sisters this
[50:33] morning, and encourage them. And when we
[50:35] speak of authority, so many times when
[50:37] it comes to women, we don't tend to
[50:39] assign them a whole lot of authority
[50:40] because we know that scripturally
[50:42] speaking, women are under headship.
[50:45] Amen. They are not in authority, but
[50:47] rather they are under authority.
[50:48] Scripturally speaking, an unmarried
[50:50] young woman or an unmarried woman is
[50:52] under the headship of her father. And
[50:54] then when she gets married, then that
[50:56] father hands over headship from himself
[50:59] to her husband and she is subject to
[51:01] those men. In other words, she is under
[51:03] their authority. And that's something
[51:05] that God has established since the fall
[51:07] of humanity in Eden. And we know that in
[51:09] Eden, she wasn't under his authority. In
[51:12] Eden, she was perfectly equal. In Eden,
[51:15] they were in perfect unity under the
[51:17] word. They were both under direct
[51:18] headship to the word of God. Amen. But
[51:21] what happened was the woman disbelieved.
[51:23] Then God said, "Because of what you've
[51:25] done now, you have to be under
[51:28] headship. I gave you your own headship
[51:31] and you fell away from it. Now somebody
[51:33] has to take care of you." And so she
[51:35] said, "Your," he said, "your desire now
[51:37] will be to your husband and he will rule
[51:40] over you." And that word rule means to
[51:42] exercise dominion. Now, we're not here
[51:44] to preach some macho gospel this
[51:46] morning. We're not here to preach about
[51:47] men that run over their wives and and
[51:49] drive them hither and yawn and force
[51:51] them to do this and force them to do
[51:52] that. That's not the gospel of Jesus
[51:54] Christ. Amen. Our wives, our mothers are
[51:56] not doormats. Amen. We don't write wipe
[51:58] our feet on them. They're not there to
[52:00] just do what we say. We're to be led and
[52:02] we're to love them as Christ loved the
[52:04] church. Amen. That's the way we're
[52:06] supposed to treat them. And if we're
[52:07] not, brothers, we need to come to this
[52:09] altar and we need to repent. Amen. We've
[52:11] got to treat them as Christ treats us.
[52:14] How does he treat us, church?
[52:16] Mercifully, graciously, lovingly,
[52:19] long-sufferingly.
[52:21] That's the way that we're supposed to do
[52:23] it. Amen. But and so now that the woman
[52:25] has been placed under headship, that's a
[52:27] strong thing to preach these days. That
[52:30] she's under somebody else's authority.
[52:32] But listen, church, God has an order.
[52:34] And God has set an order. And to be in
[52:37] his will, you have to be in his order.
[52:39] But it's got to be a scriptural order.
[52:40] It's got to be the way that he does it.
[52:42] But that doesn't mean that because a
[52:44] wife or or a woman is under authority
[52:46] that she doesn't have authority. But her
[52:48] head her authority now comes through her
[52:50] headship rather than through herself.
[52:53] And so she does have authority. And I
[52:55] want to take us back to the very
[52:56] beginning. When we preach, we always go
[52:58] back to the beginning because if it's
[52:59] established in the beginning, we can
[53:01] have faith that it'll move through to
[53:02] the end. And at the beginning, God gave
[53:04] a very short and concise command to the
[53:06] man and the woman. In Genesis 1, it
[53:08] said, "So God created man in his own
[53:10] image, and in the image of God created
[53:12] he him. Male and female created he them.
[53:15] And God blessed them. And God said unto
[53:18] them, "How do you stay in God's
[53:20] blessing, church? Stay in God's word."
[53:23] He says, "Be fruitful and multiply, and
[53:26] replenish the earth, and subdue it, and
[53:28] have dominion over the fish of the sea,
[53:30] and over the fowls of the air, and over
[53:32] every living thing that moveth upon the
[53:34] earth." Now, from the beginning,
[53:36] recognize that humanity was supposed to
[53:38] have dominion. They were in authority.
[53:41] And God expected them to use that
[53:44] authority to do what he had told them to
[53:47] do. Not authority to go do whatever they
[53:50] wanted to do, but their authority was
[53:52] given to them to do what God had told
[53:54] them to do. Amen. They were sons and
[53:56] daughters of God. Adam was the son of
[53:58] God. That's literally what the what the
[54:00] scripture says. Adam who was the son of
[54:02] God. You look at the genealogy. Adam was
[54:04] the son of God. If Adam's a son of God,
[54:06] what is Eve? She's a daughter of God.
[54:09] They were many gods on this earth. They
[54:11] had spoken word power. They had creative
[54:13] power. They had controlling power. They
[54:15] had full authority here. And you see the
[54:17] authority they had because when Christ
[54:19] came, he exhibited the exact same
[54:21] authority that Adam would have had. He
[54:23] was the second Adam. He was the son of
[54:25] God. Amen. Now, they were not on earth
[54:27] to be
[54:28] worshiped. That belongs to God. But they
[54:31] were on earth to be obeyed. Everything
[54:34] answered to them. Amen. And so as a
[54:36] child of God, you are born with access
[54:38] to the authority that God has given you
[54:40] by your position. Now, we know that
[54:42] humanity when they fell into sin, we
[54:44] know how it happened. We're not here to
[54:46] blame the sisters this
[54:47] morning. Amen. But we're here to focus
[54:50] on our position this morning. And you'll
[54:52] notice that after the the the the
[54:54] humanity changed by sin, the command
[54:57] never changed. The command never
[54:59] changed. But now the command becomes a
[55:01] whole lot harder. Now the man still has
[55:03] to till and work the ground and take
[55:05] care of things. But now the ground is
[55:07] fighting him. Now the earth is fighting
[55:09] him. He doesn't have dominion anymore.
[55:11] And so the woman is now still supposed
[55:13] to help replenish the earth. She's still
[55:15] supposed to produce children. She's
[55:17] still supposed to help the husband. But
[55:20] now her body's fighting her. And now
[55:22] there's pain and there's sorrow
[55:24] associated with the command that God's
[55:25] given. But the command hasn't changed.
[55:27] Amen. And so the command is still there
[55:30] for that woman to help her husband and
[55:32] to produce children. Amen. And I'm
[55:34] saying that to say this this morning.
[55:35] Your authority lies in your word
[55:38] position. That's where your authority
[55:40] lies this morning. It doesn't lie in
[55:41] what the world tells you. Doesn't lie in
[55:43] what your pastor tells you. It lies in
[55:45] what the word tells you. Amen. And in
[55:48] there, you have authority by obedience.
[55:50] You have authority by revelation. You
[55:52] have authority by sticking with it.
[55:54] That's where your authority lies this
[55:56] morning. Amen. And the authority of a
[55:58] believer is always found through the
[56:00] word of God by the Holy Spirit
[56:02] quickening it to him. Amen. We would
[56:04] call it in the military. You're in the
[56:05] line of duty. Amen. You're standing
[56:08] where you're supposed to stand doing
[56:10] what you've been told to do. That's
[56:12] where your authority comes from for the
[56:13] believer. Amen. Listen to this quote. He
[56:16] said, "One writer said at one time when
[56:19] they got in that place, wonder what
[56:20] Moses would do. And he had one command.
[56:22] Go forward." He says, "If you're in the
[56:25] line of duty, no matter what stays in
[56:26] the way, the greatest experiences I've
[56:29] ever had are to come up against
[56:31] something I couldn't get over it or
[56:34] under it, and just stand there and watch
[56:37] God make a way through it." That's the
[56:39] way to do it. He says, "Just move. Keep
[56:42] moving. Press your nose against it. Just
[56:45] keep moving on. Just keep going on. God
[56:48] will make a way." You know, it reminded
[56:49] me of the boxers pre-fight. Before they
[56:52] ever do that, the the the referee comes
[56:54] up and he gives them the rules and they
[56:56] stand there and they stare each other in
[56:58] the
[56:59] face. And sometimes they'll get right
[57:01] here literally to where they're almost
[57:03] touching noses. And what are they trying
[57:05] to do? Intimidate the other person. They
[57:08] don't blink. They don't look away. They
[57:10] just stand there and they stare and
[57:12] they're trying to psych the other one
[57:13] out. That's what brother's saying. He's
[57:15] saying when you come to something you
[57:16] can't move, don't move back. You hold
[57:18] fast because God has taken you there.
[57:21] You're in the line of duty. You're in
[57:23] the word. And therefore, do not move
[57:25] back. Don't let him push you back. Don't
[57:28] let him intimidate you. Don't let the
[57:30] situation intimidate you. Remember who
[57:33] brought you to this place. And as
[57:35] brother Garfield reminded us, we don't
[57:37] have any armor on our back. So, we've
[57:39] got to face our enemy at all times.
[57:40] Don't let him intimidate you. Amen. He
[57:43] says this, "When you do everything that
[57:45] you can do in the line of duty, then
[57:48] it's God's business to provide a way.
[57:52] It's not your business. It's your
[57:53] business to stand. It's his business to
[57:56] provide a way through. There are things
[57:58] we cannot make change. There are things
[58:00] we cannot move. There are things we
[58:02] cannot influence. But what we can do is
[58:04] hold our ground until God gives us a way
[58:06] through this morning." Amen. So, what is
[58:08] the line of duty for a mother?
[58:12] Where's your line of duty? Where's your
[58:13] post of duty mothers this
[58:15] morning? Sister Melody, is this your
[58:18] mother here this morning? God bless you,
[58:20] sister. It's good to see you here. Amen.
[58:22] Wonderful to finally see her here. Sorry
[58:24] I just get to preaching. I don't even
[58:26] look at faces when I'm preaching half
[58:27] the time. I'm just preaching. But God
[58:29] bless you. It's good to to have you
[58:30] here. But where is your word? Where's
[58:32] your word post of duty? Where's your
[58:34] line of duty, mothers this morning?
[58:37] Let's go to what the word says, not
[58:40] where the word doesn't say. Because too
[58:42] often what we're doing is we're stepping
[58:44] into the liberty of what the scripture
[58:45] doesn't say. And we're completely
[58:47] ignoring what the sister or what the
[58:49] word tells us to do. If your liberty
[58:51] takes you into a place where you can't
[58:53] fulfill what the word tells you to do,
[58:55] you've got a problem. You've got a
[58:57] problem because God's liberty to you
[58:59] can't take you away from the word of
[59:00] God, from doing what God tells you to
[59:02] do. Amen. Listen to what Paul says. And
[59:04] he's talking to Titus now. He says, "But
[59:06] speak thou the things which become sound
[59:09] doctrine, things that are
[59:12] proven." He says, "That the aged men be
[59:15] sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith
[59:19] and charity and patience." Brothers,
[59:21] that's for you this morning. Now listen
[59:23] here. He says, "The aged women, the
[59:25] older women, likewise, that they be in
[59:30] behavior, not in word only, in behavior
[59:34] as becometh holiness, not false
[59:36] accusers, not given to much wine,
[59:38] teachers of good things." Sisters, this
[59:40] is how you're supposed to end up. You
[59:43] won't start this way, but this is how
[59:44] you're supposed to end up. You're
[59:46] supposed to have holy
[59:48] behavior, not just talkers, but doers.
[59:52] Amen. You're supposed to be teachers of
[59:54] good things with your tongue under
[59:58] control. What's the purpose? Why? Why is
[1:00:01] God requiring this? What he says? That
[1:00:04] they may teach the younger women, the
[1:00:07] young women to be sober, to love their
[1:00:10] husbands, to love their children, to be
[1:00:13] discreet, chasteed, keepers at home,
[1:00:16] good, obedient to their own husbands.
[1:00:18] Why? That the word of God be not
[1:00:20] blasphemed. Here's your word authority,
[1:00:23] mothers. Here's where you can hold God
[1:00:26] accountable. Here's where you can hold
[1:00:28] yourself accountable this morning. Amen.
[1:00:31] God said from the very beginning that
[1:00:33] you are a perfect help. You are specific
[1:00:36] help. You are a custombuilt help. You
[1:00:40] are literally the completion of your
[1:00:44] husband. You're the part he never knew
[1:00:46] he was missing.
[1:00:49] You're bone of his bone, flesh of his
[1:00:51] flesh. Sin has separated you from the
[1:00:53] process that should have brought you in
[1:00:54] by the spoken word. But when you come to
[1:00:56] him, you are not, as many people
[1:00:59] misquote, you are not a
[1:01:01] helpmate. You are a help meat, which
[1:01:05] means you are specifically created to
[1:01:08] match up to the missing portion of him.
[1:01:11] You are built to fit into his life
[1:01:13] perfectly. You are his strength where he
[1:01:15] is weak and he is your strength where
[1:01:17] you are weak. You add to him. You do not
[1:01:20] diminish him. Everything about you is
[1:01:22] perfect for that man.
[1:01:24] Amen. Now, what did Paul tell the women
[1:01:29] and the young women in particular to
[1:01:31] prepare for and be taught? To have a big
[1:01:34] career, to go out in the world and make
[1:01:36] a lot of money, to be
[1:01:39] influential, to be an eloquent speaker,
[1:01:42] to be a preacher. No. Paul said you need
[1:01:45] to be prepared to be a wife and a
[1:01:48] mother. You say, "Brother John, I don't
[1:01:50] have a husband." Get ready. That's what
[1:01:53] he's saying. He's saying you got to
[1:01:54] teach them before they become it so that
[1:01:57] when they get there, they know what
[1:01:59] they're supposed to do. The time to
[1:02:01] learn is before. Because when you get
[1:02:02] married and you don't have a clue,
[1:02:04] that's a hard time to be a parent.
[1:02:05] That's a hard time to be a mother.
[1:02:07] That's a hard time to be a father and a
[1:02:08] husband. The time to learn is before
[1:02:10] then so that you walk in with at least
[1:02:12] an idea of what you're supposed to do.
[1:02:14] And that doesn't come
[1:02:16] naturally. You got to learn. You've got
[1:02:18] to grow. You've got to humble yourself.
[1:02:20] You got to surrender. That's why Paul
[1:02:22] says the older women have to
[1:02:24] teach. You'll notice the command here is
[1:02:27] to them to be taught, not just for them
[1:02:29] to learn. Somebody's got to teach them.
[1:02:32] And whether they take it or not, it's on
[1:02:34] them. But that doesn't stop the older
[1:02:35] women from teaching. Listen, whether
[1:02:38] they're accepting it or not, sisters,
[1:02:39] you got to keep teaching. You got to
[1:02:41] keep speaking. You got to keep living by
[1:02:44] example, they can choose to take it or
[1:02:47] not to take it. But your requirement by
[1:02:48] the word is to teach. So whether you're
[1:02:51] a mother, you're a a middle-aged sister,
[1:02:53] whether you're a grandmother, I'm sorry,
[1:02:55] sisters, you don't get to retire. You
[1:02:58] don't get to retire. You're at the apex
[1:03:00] of your of your testimony, and you're
[1:03:02] there to show the rest of them how it's
[1:03:04] done.
[1:03:06] Same with the older men. There is no
[1:03:08] retiring for a believer. You're always
[1:03:10] in the battle. You're always a part of
[1:03:11] the body. We need you until God takes
[1:03:13] you away. There's no rest for the weary.
[1:03:15] I'm sorry. There's a little bit. There's
[1:03:18] a little bit. But you're here for a
[1:03:19] reason. Amen. But what does he What do
[1:03:22] they need to be
[1:03:23] taught? Yeah. I thought it's amazing
[1:03:25] what the depths that Paul goes into
[1:03:27] here. And he starts out the first thing
[1:03:29] he says they need to be taught to be
[1:03:31] sober.
[1:03:33] You know what that word sober
[1:03:35] means? To restore one to her
[1:03:39] senses, to moderate, to control, to
[1:03:42] curb, to disciple, to hold one to her
[1:03:46] duty, to admonish and exhort
[1:03:48] earnestly. He says they need to be
[1:03:50] taught to love their husbands and their
[1:03:52] children. First of all, to expect the
[1:03:55] husband and children because that's the
[1:03:56] blessings of God. And then when they get
[1:03:58] them to love them. And we'd think that'd
[1:04:00] be self-explanatory except the scripture
[1:04:03] shows us that women need to learn to
[1:04:04] love their husbands because the way that
[1:04:06] they want to love their husbands is not
[1:04:08] the way that their husbands need to be
[1:04:10] loved. Your sisters will find and if
[1:04:12] you're taught properly that the way you
[1:04:14] love a man first is through respect and
[1:04:17] second through your
[1:04:19] actions. You've got to respect him
[1:04:21] before you can ever hope to love him
[1:04:24] because that's the re that's what he
[1:04:26] requires. He requires the respect of his
[1:04:28] wife. Amen. And then afterwards, your
[1:04:30] actions will follow up. Listen, kids
[1:04:32] love a hug and a kiss. And it's not that
[1:04:33] men don't love a hug and a kiss. We love
[1:04:35] a hug and a kiss, but we love respect
[1:04:37] more than we love those
[1:04:39] things because it it establishes our
[1:04:42] position relative to you. Okay? He says
[1:04:46] that you've got to be taught to be
[1:04:48] discreet. That word discreet means
[1:04:51] soundminded, sane, moderate in approach,
[1:04:55] self-controlled, not giving into
[1:04:57] impulses. It speaks of financial
[1:05:00] modesty. It speaks of living within your
[1:05:02] means. It speaks of making a calculated
[1:05:05] and sound decision every single day.
[1:05:09] Okay? He says you have to be taught to
[1:05:12] be keepers at home. That means you're
[1:05:14] the watch guard. You're the watch
[1:05:15] person. Listen, daddy goes out the door
[1:05:17] every morning and who's going to guard
[1:05:19] the home? It's just you sisters. It's
[1:05:22] just you mothers. And so you become the
[1:05:24] watchman of the house. And if the
[1:05:25] husband isn't there to watch it and
[1:05:27] you're not there to watch it, then who's
[1:05:29] going to guard the
[1:05:30] home? Children left to their own their
[1:05:33] their own devices are going to end up
[1:05:35] poorly, church. I'm sorry. That's just
[1:05:36] the way it is. I was a child once. Leave
[1:05:40] me to my own devices. I found trouble
[1:05:42] every time. We need a guard over our
[1:05:44] homes. He says they have to be taught to
[1:05:48] be
[1:05:48] good. This is a beautiful word.
[1:05:53] I hope I'm not stepping on toes when I
[1:05:55] say this. Good means
[1:05:58] pleasant,
[1:06:00] agreeable,
[1:06:02] joyful,
[1:06:03] happy, excellent, honorable,
[1:06:07] distinguished, and useful. That's a lot.
[1:06:11] Now, sisters, I hope you're not I'm not
[1:06:13] trying to put you in a box this morning.
[1:06:15] I'm taking us somewhere. So, stay with
[1:06:16] me. So, if you're feeling guilty, just
[1:06:19] set it aside for now, okay? We're going
[1:06:20] to get you past the guilt. If you feel
[1:06:23] like you're not like that, we're going
[1:06:24] to get you past it this morning. But I'm
[1:06:25] trying to show you what God's
[1:06:27] expectations are. I'm trying to show you
[1:06:30] what's
[1:06:31] possible. I'm trying to show you what
[1:06:34] have you have authority
[1:06:35] for. He said they've got to be taught to
[1:06:38] be obedient. And that's a very touchy
[1:06:40] subject today, but the scripture is
[1:06:42] clear that the man is the head of the
[1:06:44] house and Christ is the head of the man.
[1:06:48] And you got to keep those things in
[1:06:49] order. And you'll find that the woman is
[1:06:51] commanded to obedient. Why,
[1:06:54] church? Because in her flesh, she
[1:06:57] doesn't want to
[1:06:59] obey. That's why she has to be
[1:07:01] commanded. What are men commanded to do,
[1:07:04] church? What's good for the goose is
[1:07:06] good for the gander. We're commanded to
[1:07:09] love. Not how we want to love, but how
[1:07:13] she needs to be loved. That's why we
[1:07:16] need the commandment. Because we have to
[1:07:18] love as Christ loved. See, we love the
[1:07:20] physical aspect. We love doing the love
[1:07:23] that we do
[1:07:24] best. Some of us men love really well in
[1:07:27] in
[1:07:28] providing, but we're horrible in
[1:07:30] conversation and emotional
[1:07:34] support. I'm better
[1:07:37] now. But I was really good at bringing
[1:07:40] home the bacon. But sitting down and
[1:07:42] having a heart-to-he heart conversation,
[1:07:44] sorry, I wasn't good at that. Didn't
[1:07:45] want it.
[1:07:47] And I would say, I love my wife. No, I
[1:07:50] had to love her as Christ loved her and
[1:07:52] gave as Christ loved the church and gave
[1:07:54] himself for it. Sacrifice what's
[1:07:57] uncomfortable. Sacrifice getting out of
[1:07:59] your comfort zone. Sacrifice what feels
[1:08:01] good. And look for what benefits her
[1:08:04] rather than what benefits you. Christ
[1:08:06] went through an awful hard time for you
[1:08:08] and I, church. As men, we're supposed to
[1:08:10] love as Christ love, not love where
[1:08:12] we're just good at it. But the woman is
[1:08:15] required and she needs to be taught to
[1:08:17] obey her husband even when she's in
[1:08:21] disagreement because God deals with
[1:08:24] him. You're there to give him your
[1:08:27] support and your God honest opinion, but
[1:08:31] it's up to him to what he listens to.
[1:08:33] And God, he answers to God. And that's
[1:08:36] the hardest thing. I can't imagine being
[1:08:37] in that position, sisters. That's very
[1:08:39] difficult for me to imagine. But God has
[1:08:41] built you to do that. And if you've got
[1:08:44] the spirit of God inside of you, you'll
[1:08:45] be able to do those sorts of things. But
[1:08:48] church, what's the purpose of all of
[1:08:50] this? Sisters, why did Paul say do all
[1:08:53] of this, be all of this, have all of
[1:08:55] this? He says that the word of God be
[1:08:58] not blasphemed. So you don't bring a
[1:09:00] reproach on the word of God. That's why
[1:09:03] you need to be this way. I was telling
[1:09:04] someone the other day that I saw a
[1:09:06] couple being interviewed and they were
[1:09:08] they were asking the wife about
[1:09:10] something. It was a Hollywood couple and
[1:09:12] they were asking her about something and
[1:09:14] she she she made her answer and then her
[1:09:16] husband gave a word of support behind
[1:09:18] her and she turned around and she said,
[1:09:21] "When I'm talking, you're not talking."
[1:09:23] She said it twice to him. You talk about
[1:09:26] his face
[1:09:27] change. He kind of looked around. I
[1:09:29] mean, completely embarrassed him and he
[1:09:32] kind of looked away and she said, I
[1:09:34] mean, she dressed him down and then she
[1:09:36] turned back to the camera. She said,
[1:09:36] "Maybe we can cut this out later of the
[1:09:39] interview. This is why we can't be
[1:09:41] here." That's what she said. Anyways, he
[1:09:43] ended up just wandering off and talking
[1:09:44] to somebody
[1:09:46] else. How we treat our spouses, church,
[1:09:49] is one of the first testimonies we can
[1:09:51] give in this world to people. And if the
[1:09:53] way we treat our spouses is no different
[1:09:55] than how they treat our spouses, where's
[1:09:57] the Christ in us? Amen. The greatest
[1:10:00] testimony so many of us have are how we
[1:10:02] interact with our spouses in this world.
[1:10:05] the love, the respect, the appreciation,
[1:10:07] the
[1:10:08] support, the patience, and sometimes the
[1:10:10] absorbing of a blow.
[1:10:13] Amen. We have to be able to show that
[1:10:16] we're not in we're in this world, but
[1:10:17] we're not of
[1:10:18] it. But we're speaking to mothers today,
[1:10:22] but we're also talking to the not yet
[1:10:24] mothers because guess what? We've got
[1:10:25] sisters here that aren't married
[1:10:27] yet. And what if you don't have a
[1:10:29] husband this morning? What if you don't
[1:10:30] have a boyfriend? What if it's maybe not
[1:10:32] quite on the horizon yet? What do you
[1:10:33] do? Learn now. Learn now. You'll be far
[1:10:38] better off starting with something in
[1:10:39] your purse about how to deal with it,
[1:10:42] how to cook, how to clean, how to
[1:10:44] support, how to respond, how to
[1:10:45] encourage, how to keep a house, how to
[1:10:48] keep a budget, how to
[1:10:49] shop. If you can learn that now rather
[1:10:52] than waiting until you're in the fire of
[1:10:54] marriage to have to learn all of these
[1:10:56] things, that's why mama's there right
[1:10:59] now. That's why Nan's there, why
[1:11:01] grandma's there right now is to help you
[1:11:03] learn these different things. The time
[1:11:05] to learn is now and then. Older sisters,
[1:11:07] whether you're the middle-aged moms that
[1:11:09] are here, whether it's our grandmothers
[1:11:11] that are here, that's what you're here
[1:11:12] for. You're here to help. You're here to
[1:11:15] support. You're here to to show these
[1:11:17] young women how they can come to their
[1:11:19] senses. Do we need that today, church?
[1:11:23] Not just for young women, but for
[1:11:24] everybody. Because the world is trying
[1:11:26] to invert the roles. They're trying to
[1:11:29] blend the men and the women. And guess
[1:11:30] what? God had to find roles. He had to
[1:11:33] find genders. He had a divine order. He
[1:11:36] had a divine authority structure. And
[1:11:39] the world is trying to take it and turn
[1:11:40] it
[1:11:41] topsyturvy. They're trying to turn men
[1:11:43] into women and women into men. I I don't
[1:11:46] know if you've noticed this, but women
[1:11:47] do a better job of being women than men
[1:11:49] do. And men do a better job of being men
[1:11:52] than women ever can. Why? because God
[1:11:55] built them, made them, designed them for
[1:11:57] particular
[1:11:58] roles and it's in our benefit to stay
[1:12:01] within those things. But Satan is trying
[1:12:03] to turn it on its head because he knows
[1:12:05] if he can break up that structure, he
[1:12:08] can break up a marriage, he can break up
[1:12:09] a family, which will break up a church,
[1:12:11] which will break up a nation. Abraham
[1:12:14] said when we lost that backbone of
[1:12:16] motherhood, we lost the nation. Mothers,
[1:12:19] are you important? You're important.
[1:12:21] You're important this morning. You've
[1:12:24] always been important, but the world is
[1:12:26] trying to take our sisters away from
[1:12:28] motherhood and focus them on career.
[1:12:31] Why? Because if they do that, they can
[1:12:32] break the home. They'll break the home.
[1:12:35] And when you break the home, the nation
[1:12:37] is not far behind. We've seen it. We've
[1:12:40] seen it. Go look across the nation. Go
[1:12:42] look across the United States. We've
[1:12:43] seen what happens when we do those
[1:12:45] things. Amen. But those headships have
[1:12:47] to be settled by the word, not by
[1:12:50] societal norms. Societal norms have no
[1:12:53] power and they have no track record that
[1:12:55] you want to have any part of. But you
[1:12:56] got to find your position in the
[1:12:59] word. So no retirement, sisters. I'm
[1:13:02] here to tell you this morning, no
[1:13:03] retirement. You're in the battle until
[1:13:05] the Lord takes you. Amen. You're still
[1:13:07] an example. You're still needed. What
[1:13:09] are you trying to do, church? You're
[1:13:10] trying to get them into what God has
[1:13:12] called them to before Satan can get his
[1:13:14] grubby hands on them. You're trying to
[1:13:16] protect them. You're trying to teach
[1:13:18] them. Amen. because they have a massive
[1:13:21] responsibility. And if they're taught
[1:13:22] right, they'll have a massive positive
[1:13:24] impact. They'll have a kingdom impact.
[1:13:26] If they're poorly taught, they'll have a
[1:13:28] horrible impact. If they're well taught
[1:13:31] and they receive it, they'll have a
[1:13:32] wonderful impact. Amen. And if they're
[1:13:34] not really taught at all, guess what?
[1:13:35] They tend to make a mess of things. And
[1:13:37] then you got to learn at an older age.
[1:13:39] And that's always tough to do, isn't it,
[1:13:40] Brother Garfield? Trying to learn things
[1:13:43] at a old dog, new tricks. It's very
[1:13:45] difficult. Doesn't mean God can't do it,
[1:13:48] but it's a lot harder on everybody if we
[1:13:49] do it. Amen. And the the process starts.
[1:13:52] Remember what Paul said. He says, "Older
[1:13:53] women, teach the young women." Whether
[1:13:55] they learn or not, it's up to them. But
[1:13:56] you got to stay in the saddle. You got
[1:13:58] to keep pushing. You got to keep
[1:13:59] training. You got to keep teaching. You
[1:14:01] got to keep being an example. Amen.
[1:14:03] That's it. You're off the hook now.
[1:14:05] Well, focus on the rest of them. Listen
[1:14:07] to this. He says, "In a woman that keeps
[1:14:09] her place and is a lady, there is
[1:14:11] nothing any more precious outside of
[1:14:14] salvation to our nation than a real
[1:14:17] woman." Sisters, where are you standing
[1:14:20] this morning? Nothing more precious to a
[1:14:24] nation than our
[1:14:26] mothers. If they're a real lady, if
[1:14:29] they're a real Christian outside of
[1:14:32] salvation, give yourself a
[1:14:35] pet. Give yourself a pet. Thank you,
[1:14:38] Sister
[1:14:39] Nikki. You're important this morning.
[1:14:41] You're more important than you realize.
[1:14:44] Amen. Now, I've said all this as a
[1:14:46] foundation this morning on this thought
[1:14:48] of a mother's authority because remember
[1:14:50] what I said, your authority comes from
[1:14:52] your word position. We're talked about
[1:14:54] being in the line of duty and you can
[1:14:56] have confidence that if you're in the
[1:14:57] line of duty, if you're doing what God
[1:14:59] told you to do where God told you to do
[1:15:01] it, that God is going to back you up.
[1:15:03] Because now God's not backing you up.
[1:15:05] He's backing the word that you're
[1:15:06] following. Amen. That's exactly what we
[1:15:08] need to see. And then you can have
[1:15:09] confidence in the blessings. You can
[1:15:11] have confidence in the support, in the
[1:15:13] strength, in the guidance, in the
[1:15:14] learning, in the growing, in the
[1:15:16] strength, in the comfort, in the joy,
[1:15:17] and the rest, whatever you have need of
[1:15:19] because you're in the line of duty.
[1:15:21] Amen. You can have confidence when
[1:15:23] you're right with God that God's going
[1:15:25] to do right by you every single time.
[1:15:28] Amen. I want us to to take a look at
[1:15:30] some examples this morning. I'll take us
[1:15:31] back into the word. And I want to take
[1:15:33] us back to Moses and his birth. And
[1:15:36] speaking of Moses' parents, it says,
[1:15:37] "There went a man of the house of Levi
[1:15:39] and took a wife of a daughter of Levi.
[1:15:41] And the woman conceived and bare a son.
[1:15:43] And when she saw him that he was a
[1:15:45] goodly child, she hid him three months.
[1:15:48] And when she could not longer hide him,
[1:15:50] she took him for she took for him an ark
[1:15:52] of bull rushes, and dubbed it with slime
[1:15:55] and with pitch, and put the child
[1:15:58] therein, and she laid it in the flags by
[1:16:01] the river's brink." Now consider this
[1:16:03] woman, this this mother of Moses. And
[1:16:06] recognize one thing, church, she's a
[1:16:07] mother of the covenant. Okay? She's
[1:16:10] under a promise. The first thing you got
[1:16:13] to realize, church, is where's my
[1:16:14] promise? And is it a word promise or is
[1:16:17] it a world promise? A world promise is
[1:16:19] not worth it. It's not worth the paper
[1:16:21] you write it on. But if it's a word
[1:16:23] promise, you can take it to the eternal
[1:16:24] bank and cash it every single time.
[1:16:26] Amen. And she has this child. And I
[1:16:29] don't know if you notice, it said he was
[1:16:30] a goodly child. He's different than
[1:16:33] Aaron. Aaron's a
[1:16:36] prophet. He's different than Miriam.
[1:16:39] Miriam's a
[1:16:40] prophetess, but he's beyond them. He's
[1:16:43] beyond gifted. He's a goodly child. And
[1:16:46] she sees that there's something
[1:16:47] different about him. Now, remember in
[1:16:49] that time, Pharaoh had said, "You've got
[1:16:51] to notify us when you're going to have a
[1:16:53] child." And then he told the midwives
[1:16:55] and he told the military. He says, "You
[1:16:56] kill the male children as they're
[1:16:59] born." And so this woman is under a
[1:17:01] natural law to give her son up. But she
[1:17:05] sits there and she sees his child and
[1:17:07] something strikes her and she says,
[1:17:09] "This one's
[1:17:10] different." Now, nobody was giving up
[1:17:12] their children willfully, church. But
[1:17:14] now she takes his child and there's
[1:17:16] something different about them. And so
[1:17:18] now what she does is she stands in the
[1:17:20] gap as the mother. He can't do anything
[1:17:22] for himself. But she stands in the gap
[1:17:25] and for three months she hides him and
[1:17:27] she feeds him and she keeps him quiet
[1:17:29] and she keeps him hidden. But there came
[1:17:31] a time where she knew she couldn't keep
[1:17:33] him forever. And so she held him as long
[1:17:36] as she could, but she stepped out at
[1:17:39] some point and she said, "I can't take
[1:17:40] him any
[1:17:41] further. He's going to die if I hold on
[1:17:44] to him, church." And what did she do?
[1:17:47] She stepped out on her authority as a
[1:17:49] mother and she laid him in the hands of
[1:17:51] a living God.
[1:17:53] She laid him in the hands of a living
[1:17:56] God. Hebrews 11 says that by faith, by
[1:18:00] faith, Moses' parents did this. Amen.
[1:18:02] This wasn't a last resort. This was not
[1:18:05] a constraint. This was not a you have
[1:18:07] to, but by faith, by revelation, by
[1:18:10] trusting God, she took that goodly child
[1:18:13] and she placed him in a river full of
[1:18:15] crocodiles and
[1:18:16] hippos. By faith, she did it. Amen. And
[1:18:19] so she let him go and she gave him by
[1:18:22] faith into God's hands. And what did God
[1:18:25] do, church? God responded to that
[1:18:27] mother's faith and he guided that that
[1:18:30] bed or that that basket to the Pharaoh's
[1:18:33] daughter and she takes him. She opens
[1:18:35] him up. She adopts him and then she
[1:18:38] sends him back to Moses' mother to raise
[1:18:41] him for his formative years. And she
[1:18:43] gets paid to do it.
[1:18:45] God responds to her faith by giving her
[1:18:48] her child back. Church, before God ever
[1:18:50] made a faithful prophet, he made a
[1:18:52] faithful mother that would trust God,
[1:18:55] take him at his word, act in faith so
[1:18:57] that he could bring him right back so
[1:18:59] she could raise him the right way.
[1:19:00] That's what we're talking about. You
[1:19:02] have authority to let them go into God's
[1:19:04] hands, and trust him to take him
[1:19:06] through. Amen. Speaking of Moses,
[1:19:09] brother Brandham would say, "How could
[1:19:11] he after being indoctrinated down there
[1:19:12] and all that stuff poked into him by
[1:19:14] those Egyptian scholars? How could he
[1:19:16] ever get all of that out of
[1:19:19] him?" You talk about going to university
[1:19:22] and how many young people go into
[1:19:24] university and they come out the other
[1:19:26] side an
[1:19:27] unbeliever. Moses lived in Pharaoh's
[1:19:30] house, taught by the best of the best,
[1:19:31] had wonderful deeds. He was a tremendous
[1:19:33] general. He was a tremendous intellect.
[1:19:36] all of this ingrained into him. And he
[1:19:38] says, "How did how did Moses ever get
[1:19:40] that out of him?" How did Moses ever get
[1:19:42] through that without it impacting him?
[1:19:45] He says, "You know why? Because he had a
[1:19:47] godly little mother that set him on her
[1:19:49] knee down there from one side from all
[1:19:52] those scholars and said, Moses, you are
[1:19:54] chosen of the Lord. God gave you to me
[1:19:56] and your promise. We see God on you and
[1:19:59] someday you will deliver your brothers."
[1:20:01] He says, "Hallelujah. Faith cometh by
[1:20:03] hearing and hearing from the word of
[1:20:05] God. She established faith in Moses by
[1:20:08] giving him the word. We read in Timothy
[1:20:11] how that Timothy had his grandmother
[1:20:13] Lois who passed down faith to Ununice
[1:20:15] his mother who passed down faith to
[1:20:18] him. Mothers, it matters what you're
[1:20:21] teaching your children. It will hold
[1:20:23] them in a time, the scripture says,
[1:20:24] "Train up a child in the way he should
[1:20:26] go. And when he is old, he'll not turn
[1:20:30] away from it.
[1:20:33] He said, 'For faith does not place
[1:20:35] itself upon the shifting sands of what
[1:20:37] it can see. Faith rests solemnly upon
[1:20:40] the unmovable rock of God's eternal
[1:20:42] word. For by faith, says the scripture,
[1:20:44] she did this, speaking of Moses'
[1:20:46] mother, and faith can take its stand on
[1:20:49] the rock that the waves are beating at
[1:20:52] the foundations out and look straight
[1:20:54] into the face of death and know that
[1:20:56] it'll be just in a little bit. But faith
[1:20:58] can look across the sea, look past the
[1:21:02] circumstances to him that said, "I am
[1:21:05] the resurrection of life." And because
[1:21:07] of that, failed to even hear the waves a
[1:21:11] dashing. He says, "That's the kind of
[1:21:14] faith that Moses' mother had. Look
[1:21:17] beyond the situation to the promise
[1:21:19] beyond it and said, "I'm not even going
[1:21:21] to recognize the situation for what it
[1:21:23] is." He says, "She taught him and she
[1:21:26] reared him in the palace of Pharaoh,
[1:21:28] teaching him that he was born for a
[1:21:30] purpose, that Jehovah had answered her
[1:21:33] prayer." And he could not have had a
[1:21:36] better teacher. That's what helped mold
[1:21:38] the character that Moses was. You see, a
[1:21:40] child listens to its mother. Some little
[1:21:42] touch about that mother that a child
[1:21:44] will listen to. When it's heard, it'll
[1:21:46] go to the mother for consolation before
[1:21:48] it'll go to the father because she was
[1:21:50] first with it. first with it, you know,
[1:21:52] and there's some gift that God gives a
[1:21:54] mother to be that way. He says, I mean a
[1:21:56] real mother. He says, now I believe that
[1:21:58] mothers are honorable and
[1:22:01] godly. Mother, so often you look and you
[1:22:04] say, "I'm called to the
[1:22:06] impossible." No, you're called to the
[1:22:09] supernatural. But you know what the
[1:22:11] supernatural looks like? It looks like
[1:22:14] doing the right thing day in and day
[1:22:17] out. That's the supernatural.
[1:22:20] See, too often we're looking for God to
[1:22:22] do everything. And all God says is, "You
[1:22:24] be faithful and watch what I'll do
[1:22:26] through your
[1:22:27] faithfulness." And when you're not
[1:22:29] faithful, I'll make up the gap. But be
[1:22:32] faithful. Be faithful. Stay with it.
[1:22:34] Amen. That's just a repetitive day in
[1:22:37] day out doing what God has asked you to
[1:22:39] do. Amen. You're called to a place where
[1:22:41] you may have to lay your children into
[1:22:43] God's hands, where you've done
[1:22:45] everything you can. You've come to the
[1:22:47] end of the rope. They have a choice that
[1:22:49] they can stay or go. But regardless of
[1:22:52] what happens, you got to be able to say,
[1:22:54] "I have stayed faithful as best I know
[1:22:57] how, and now they're in God's hands."
[1:23:00] And you can let go in full authority and
[1:23:03] confidence knowing that God will take
[1:23:04] care of them. That you've stayed that
[1:23:07] you've stayed tight to what he told you
[1:23:08] to do. Amen. You have authority to let
[1:23:11] go and have God undertake on your behalf
[1:23:13] this morning.
[1:23:15] Mothers, listen. God asked you to do
[1:23:17] your part, but he never said you were on
[1:23:18] your
[1:23:19] own. God wants to know you're
[1:23:22] committed. God wants to know that you're
[1:23:24] you're in for the long haul. But God
[1:23:26] never said you're alone. He said, "You
[1:23:28] do your part and I'll do my part." Amen.
[1:23:32] Let me take you to another place of
[1:23:34] authority. And I'm going to tell you
[1:23:35] this morning as a true mother, you have
[1:23:37] a particular authority as it relates to
[1:23:39] your children. I don't know if anybody
[1:23:41] would argue, maybe they would this
[1:23:42] morning, that there's a bond between a
[1:23:44] mother and child that men don't have. It
[1:23:47] came out of you and science has proven
[1:23:49] it. Uh, Brother Joe had shared something
[1:23:52] uh about a woman that was talking about
[1:23:54] the science behi behind a mother and a
[1:23:56] child. And literally, a mother's body
[1:23:58] can sense what a child is lacking. And
[1:24:00] she will even deplete her own marrow of
[1:24:03] her own bones, the calcium in her bones
[1:24:05] to help give that child what it needs.
[1:24:07] She will literally her body will
[1:24:08] self-destroy for the sake of that child.
[1:24:11] That's how connected they are. We don't
[1:24:14] have that. We compartmentalize things
[1:24:16] different. We handle things differently.
[1:24:18] But there's a bond between a mother and
[1:24:19] child that is very powerful and it's
[1:24:21] powerful in the presence of God. It's
[1:24:23] not just powerful in this world. Amen.
[1:24:26] But a mother's a special person and she
[1:24:28] has a that special connection and God
[1:24:29] honors that. And let me talk to you
[1:24:31] mothers again to say God's this earth is
[1:24:34] going to throw you curveballs. Life's
[1:24:36] going to throw you curveballs and you're
[1:24:38] going to come up against situations.
[1:24:39] You're going to come up against
[1:24:40] conditions. You're going to come up
[1:24:42] against problems that you had no idea.
[1:24:44] Sometimes you are a willing partner of
[1:24:46] it and sometimes you're
[1:24:48] not. And you're going to come to the
[1:24:50] place where you might be burning your
[1:24:51] candle at both ends and it seems like
[1:24:54] you can't make it. Let me tell you, God
[1:24:56] is there to meet you. God is there to
[1:24:59] meet you. Amen. Listen, who always ends
[1:25:02] up with the kids? Mom.
[1:25:05] No matter what happens in this world,
[1:25:06] the kids are always going with the mom.
[1:25:08] She's always stuck with them. I say
[1:25:10] stuck. They go to her. They stay with
[1:25:13] her because she's the best one to raise
[1:25:15] them. And there's a burden there.
[1:25:17] There's a weight that comes with that.
[1:25:18] Amen. And you may fail in your trying,
[1:25:21] but God's there to cover the gap between
[1:25:23] you and what he needs. But he wants you
[1:25:25] to try. Amen. I want you to look at this
[1:25:28] story. It's the story of Hagar and
[1:25:30] Ishmael. And remember what happened.
[1:25:34] Hagar was a a servant of Sarah's and
[1:25:37] Sarah was trying to make the promise of
[1:25:39] of having a child come to pass. And so
[1:25:41] she said to Abraham, she said,"Abraham,
[1:25:43] take Hagar a and have a relationship
[1:25:46] with her and produce a child through
[1:25:48] her. She belongs to me. The child will
[1:25:50] be mine. She'll be a surrogate of sorts.
[1:25:52] It won't be of Sarah's body, but it'll
[1:25:55] be it'll be our child." And remember,
[1:25:57] she did that and Abraham listened to her
[1:26:00] and he and he produced a child through
[1:26:01] Hagar. And when Hagar was was was
[1:26:04] pregnant, what did she do? She she kind
[1:26:06] of lifted her nose at Sarah. She
[1:26:08] despised Sarah for her barrenness. And
[1:26:11] so Sarah mistreated Hagar. And she she
[1:26:14] got Hagar so frustrated and so wore out
[1:26:17] that Hagar ran away. Now, you can't run
[1:26:20] away as a
[1:26:21] slave. But Hagar runs out. She's been
[1:26:24] persecuted. Yeah, she had a bad
[1:26:26] attitude. Did she deserve what she got?
[1:26:29] No. But she runs away. And God comes to
[1:26:32] Hagar and he says, "Hagar, what are you
[1:26:35] doing?" She says, "You know what I'm
[1:26:36] doing? I'm running away from Sarah.
[1:26:38] She's made like miserable." He says, "Go
[1:26:39] back and submit to her authority." He
[1:26:42] says, "And I'll make of you and your son
[1:26:44] a great nation." And so Hagar went back.
[1:26:47] And then after a while, Sarah gets a
[1:26:49] name change. She gets a body change.
[1:26:51] Same with Abram to Abraham. And they
[1:26:53] conceive and they produce Isaac. And
[1:26:54] when Isaac is born, Ishmael starts to
[1:26:57] persecute Isaac. And Sarah sees this and
[1:27:00] she tells Abraham, she says,"Abraham,
[1:27:02] you got to get rid of them." Now that
[1:27:04] the promised son is here, you got to get
[1:27:06] rid of that son of the of the slave. He
[1:27:08] has no place here. And Abraham didn't
[1:27:10] want to do it. And God told Abraham, he
[1:27:12] said,"Abraham, she's got a promise. He's
[1:27:14] got a promise in her life. Don't be
[1:27:16] scared to do it. Don't be worried to do
[1:27:17] it. Send them out." So, we come to this
[1:27:20] scripture now. says, "And Abraham rose
[1:27:22] up early in the morning and took bread
[1:27:23] and a bottle of water and gave it unto
[1:27:25] Hagar, put it on her shoulder and the
[1:27:27] child and sent her away, and she
[1:27:29] departed and wandered in the wilderness
[1:27:31] of
[1:27:32] Beersheba." Notice Abraham's given her
[1:27:34] provisions, and her own leadership takes
[1:27:37] her into the
[1:27:39] wilderness. She doesn't know how to
[1:27:41] live. She doesn't know how to survive.
[1:27:42] And she gets herself in a bad
[1:27:45] place. He says, "And the water was spent
[1:27:47] in the bottle, and she cast the child
[1:27:49] under one of the shrubs." All the
[1:27:50] water's gone. She puts Ishmael under one
[1:27:52] of the bushes. And she went and sat down
[1:27:55] over against him a good way off as it
[1:27:57] were a bow shot. For she said, "Let me
[1:27:59] not see the death of the child." And she
[1:28:01] sat over against him and lifted up her
[1:28:03] voice and wept. And God heard the voice
[1:28:06] of the lad. And the angel of the God
[1:28:08] called to Hagar out of heaven, and said
[1:28:09] unto, "Whatith thee, Hagar? Fear not,
[1:28:12] for God heard the voice of the lad,
[1:28:13] where he is. Arise, lift up the lad, and
[1:28:17] hold him in thine hand, for I will make
[1:28:19] him a great nation. It says, "And God
[1:28:22] opened her
[1:28:23] eyes." There was provision already
[1:28:26] there, but she hadn't seen it. It says,
[1:28:29] "And she saw a well of water, and she
[1:28:31] went and filled the bottle with water
[1:28:33] and gave the lad drink. And God was with
[1:28:35] the lad, and he grew and dwelt in the
[1:28:38] wilderness and became an
[1:28:40] archer." You say, "Brother John, what's
[1:28:42] the authority here?" Let's look at what
[1:28:44] the prophet of God said. He says,"I can
[1:28:47] think of the remembrance of the Lord
[1:28:49] again at the well
[1:28:51] car," which means in the Hebrew tongue,
[1:28:54] "the well of him that liveth and seeth
[1:28:57] me." Hear what he says now. Hagar
[1:29:01] misunderstood yet in the line of
[1:29:05] duty. She's just a slave, brother John.
[1:29:08] No, she's a mother with a promise.
[1:29:12] He says, "Misunderstood, misjudged, and
[1:29:15] was cast out with no place to go with a
[1:29:17] perishing child. The water was spent in
[1:29:19] the bottle. The little fellow was
[1:29:21] crying, and only a mother's heart would
[1:29:22] know what it meant to hear that cry for
[1:29:24] water as his little tongue swelling and
[1:29:26] his lips parched and her baby weakening
[1:29:28] every minute. Cast out right in the line
[1:29:30] of duty. No place to go." He says, "She
[1:29:33] had done without herself till she
[1:29:35] squeezed the last drop over his little
[1:29:37] parched lips. And then the bottle was
[1:29:39] dry. She laid it down and started on.
[1:29:41] And the little fellow screaming for
[1:29:43] water, but he got weaker and weaker. Her
[1:29:45] only child, no doubt, but what her
[1:29:47] innocent heart could cry out, "Oh, God,
[1:29:49] what have I done? What have I done?" She
[1:29:52] couldn't stand to see the child die in
[1:29:53] her arms. So, she laid him under a bush.
[1:29:56] She went about a bow shot, probably a
[1:29:58] 100 yards or more, and saw a little
[1:29:59] tree, and she knelt down there, and she
[1:30:01] began to
[1:30:04] weep. He says, "For she wondered,
[1:30:08] why? What did I do to deserve this? God
[1:30:12] told me to go back to Sarah. I went
[1:30:14] back. I endured
[1:30:16] hardship and now I'm cast out to
[1:30:19] die. He says, if she did what was right,
[1:30:23] why should this thing come upon
[1:30:27] her? Anybody struggling with things
[1:30:30] where you say, Lord, I've honored you at
[1:30:32] every
[1:30:33] step and I'm still dealing with this.
[1:30:36] I'm still in this situation. I'm still
[1:30:38] in this hardship, still in this
[1:30:41] sickness. Sometimes I think God gave me
[1:30:43] this so I could identify with people
[1:30:45] that suffer
[1:30:49] chronically. What's it like to have
[1:30:50] situations drag on and on and on and you
[1:30:54] say, "Lord,
[1:30:56] why?" He says, "Many times we think that
[1:30:58] of our sicknesses and afflictions." See,
[1:31:02] he says, "But maybe it's all done to
[1:31:04] show grace and mercy." Now what's he
[1:31:08] talking about? Remember in Abraham's
[1:31:10] camp there can only be one blessed
[1:31:13] son. Only one can be blessed and favored
[1:31:15] of God. So God had to separate Ishmael
[1:31:19] from Isaac so Ishmael could get his own
[1:31:24] blessing. The major promises to Isaac,
[1:31:27] but Ishmael has a covenant with him as
[1:31:29] well. And God has to separate him out.
[1:31:32] And this is how he does
[1:31:34] it.
[1:31:36] His ways are beyond our understanding,
[1:31:40] church. But I'll tell you this, when
[1:31:42] this is done, Haggar knows there's a
[1:31:44] God and she knows he's
[1:31:47] real, and she knows that he
[1:31:49] hears, and she knows that he
[1:31:52] provides. He says, "And while she
[1:31:54] thought, she heard the little faint
[1:31:56] cries as they finally faded out for
[1:31:58] water. She heard a voice speak and said,
[1:32:00] "Whoa, why weepest thou? What are you
[1:32:02] weeping for?" And she looked up and she
[1:32:04] saw the well bubbling up. What a spring
[1:32:07] of refreshment. He said beer, which
[1:32:10] means the well of him that liveth and
[1:32:13] seeth me. Him that can't die. Mazdc al
[1:32:17] Shadi. Him that liveth and seeth me
[1:32:20] knowing my needs. He's remembered me.
[1:32:24] And there he remembered me as I
[1:32:25] remembered him. And I know that he
[1:32:27] liveth and he has sprung up here in the
[1:32:29] desert this well. a well that wasn't
[1:32:33] there before church and that well is
[1:32:35] still there. Her experience with God is
[1:32:38] still testified by the well at this
[1:32:40] place so that people can go and come to
[1:32:43] a place where they say this is the God
[1:32:45] that lives and sees
[1:32:49] me as a
[1:32:51] mother as a
[1:32:53] mother. What is it church? There's a
[1:32:56] well that you can go to mothers. There's
[1:32:58] a place where you can go of a God that
[1:33:01] lives and sees your need, sees the need
[1:33:04] of your children, sees the need of your
[1:33:06] family, sees the desire of your heart.
[1:33:08] And when it looks like he's failed, he
[1:33:11] comes through and he says, "I was there
[1:33:12] all along. I was in your footsteps. I
[1:33:16] was in your wandering in the desert. I
[1:33:18] was in your poor decisions. I was there
[1:33:20] all along and I gave you a promise and
[1:33:22] I'll make it happen no matter what you
[1:33:24] do."
[1:33:26] You got authority to hold him to his
[1:33:28] promise.
[1:33:30] She didn't have to weep. All she had to
[1:33:32] do was say, "Lord, what about your
[1:33:35] promise?" But he heard her no matter
[1:33:37] what she did. In her weeping, he heard
[1:33:40] her. If she had reached out in faith,
[1:33:41] he'd have heard her either way, church,
[1:33:43] because his promise was to her, and she
[1:33:44] had authority to go to him and and claim
[1:33:46] it. Amen.
[1:33:50] Listen, you can be at the end of your
[1:33:52] end of your rope this morning. You could
[1:33:54] be burning your candles at both ends and
[1:33:56] you got this much left. Let me tell you,
[1:33:58] there's a living well of Jesus Christ
[1:34:00] this morning. He's alive and well. And
[1:34:02] he sees you and he sees your needs. He
[1:34:05] sees the bondage. He sees the hurt. He
[1:34:07] sees the pain. He sees the struggle. He
[1:34:10] sees the daily
[1:34:12] hardship. And he's there to provide for
[1:34:15] you as a mother, as a faithful mother
[1:34:18] this
[1:34:21] morning. That's a place of life, church.
[1:34:24] That's a place of rest. That's a place
[1:34:27] of support. That's a place of comfort.
[1:34:29] That's a place of salvation. Amen.
[1:34:31] That's a place where life can flow
[1:34:33] through you again and you can walk in
[1:34:35] newness of life and never be the same
[1:34:37] again. And she did. And she moved on.
[1:34:39] And Ishmael became a great nation.
[1:34:42] Church, look at the Arabs today. By
[1:34:45] numbers, they're far greater than the
[1:34:48] Jews. God held them to his word. God
[1:34:51] produced his word in
[1:34:53] Ishmael.
[1:34:55] Amen. Mothers, you have the authority to
[1:34:58] go to the God of the well of his promise
[1:35:00] and say, "Here I
[1:35:02] am. Here I am. It's your promise. I'm in
[1:35:06] the line of duty and I'm going to stay
[1:35:09] here until you do it."
[1:35:11] That's your authority to stay at the
[1:35:13] well of promise until God gives you what
[1:35:14] you have need of.
[1:35:17] Amen. We read earlier that it is your
[1:35:20] place to be sober, to be good, to be
[1:35:22] productive. You're called to have a
[1:35:24] sound mind. That's what you're called to
[1:35:25] be. That's what you're called to have.
[1:35:27] That's what you're called to produce in
[1:35:28] your life. And that means you have
[1:35:30] authority to call for it if it's not
[1:35:32] there. Listen church, God can't give a
[1:35:35] requirement unless he gives the means of
[1:35:37] producing it. And so if you look in your
[1:35:40] life this morning and you say, "I don't
[1:35:41] measure up to what the Bible says." Then
[1:35:44] you have authority this morning to go
[1:35:45] and say, "God, here's me. Here's your
[1:35:49] word." Close the gap. And he doesn't
[1:35:52] lower the word. He raises you. He raises
[1:35:55] you. Amen. Let's never say this is where
[1:35:58] I am and this is all I've got. No. The
[1:36:00] word is what you are and the word is
[1:36:02] what you've got. And that's where your
[1:36:03] promise is this morning. Amen. Listen,
[1:36:05] knowing you're supposed to be a good
[1:36:06] wife and a good mother doesn't make you
[1:36:09] one. Absolutely not. I've talked to many
[1:36:13] mothers and many wives, and many of them
[1:36:14] walked into marriage with a lot of high
[1:36:16] hopes and dreams and found out, "I'm not
[1:36:18] that good at
[1:36:19] it." But what do they do? They go to God
[1:36:22] and they say, "God, I need
[1:36:26] help." And that's a a work of time
[1:36:29] usually.
[1:36:31] That's why we have a body of believers,
[1:36:34] a body of sisters here to help people,
[1:36:36] to help them grow, to encourage and
[1:36:38] support them along their journey. But
[1:36:40] listen, if your mom didn't do it, God
[1:36:42] can do it. If your grandmother didn't do
[1:36:44] it, God can do it. There's a promise in
[1:36:46] the word by the inddwelling of the
[1:36:47] spirit to bring you to your perfect
[1:36:49] position where you can do what God has
[1:36:52] called you to do as a mother this
[1:36:53] morning. Amen. Listen, there's a lot of
[1:36:55] learning. There's a lot of growing.
[1:36:57] There's a lot of stretching. There's a
[1:36:58] lot of patience. There's a lot of
[1:36:59] discomfort.
[1:37:01] But we got to grow. We got to grow. And
[1:37:04] we've got a word that can do it. And
[1:37:05] we've got a spirit of Christ that can do
[1:37:06] it. And that's where we go to him and we
[1:37:08] say, "Lord, I need to grow. I need to
[1:37:11] grow." And you've got authority to ask
[1:37:12] him to grow you this morning to take you
[1:37:15] into that place. Church, we're looking
[1:37:17] to be raptured at the end of all this.
[1:37:19] But before that, there's a a development
[1:37:22] of character that has to happen. And
[1:37:24] that character is related to your
[1:37:26] position. It's related to your position.
[1:37:30] You don't need a king's character if
[1:37:31] you're not going to be a
[1:37:32] king. But you need a mother's character
[1:37:36] if you're going to be a mother. You need
[1:37:38] a mother's attributes if you're going to
[1:37:40] be a mother. And those are word
[1:37:41] attributes. They're not just natural
[1:37:43] things that you have. Look at us. I I
[1:37:46] mean, I can identify with a father cuz
[1:37:48] I'm a father. And guess what? I don't
[1:37:49] have all the natural attributes that a
[1:37:51] father should have. We'd think I don't.
[1:37:53] And I've had to take that prayerfully
[1:37:55] before God. And he has made changes in
[1:37:57] my life. And he's improved me. I'm not
[1:37:59] perfect, but he has absolutely helped to
[1:38:01] grow me and mature me in my role as a
[1:38:03] father and as a husband. And he's still
[1:38:05] working on me. He's still working on me,
[1:38:07] but I've got to go to him and I've got
[1:38:09] to
[1:38:10] ask. That's your authority this morning.
[1:38:13] Not just to mothers, but to every
[1:38:15] believer, you've got authority to ask.
[1:38:17] Jesus said, "Ask that your joy may be
[1:38:21] full." Where is your pleasure? Jesus
[1:38:23] said, "My pleasure is to do that which
[1:38:25] he wants me to do." Your joy is in doing
[1:38:28] what God wants you to do. And where
[1:38:29] there's a a a gap, where there's a lack,
[1:38:32] you can go and ask and say, "Lord, fill
[1:38:34] me up so that my joy can be full in
[1:38:35] serving you to the best of my ability to
[1:38:38] a quality and a quantity that measures
[1:38:40] up to your word."
[1:38:42] Amen. You can have an expectation this
[1:38:45] morning. You have authority to come and
[1:38:46] expect God to meet your
[1:38:48] needs. Amen.
[1:38:52] We have authority to go to God and say,
[1:38:53] "God, I need you to close the
[1:38:56] gap." Abraham says, "Now you Christians
[1:38:58] tonight, you're in the line of duty
[1:39:00] trying to follow the leading of the Holy
[1:39:02] Spirit. A cancer grabs you, death grabs
[1:39:04] you, tubercular, whatever it might be in
[1:39:06] the line of duty. You have the same
[1:39:07] right that Peter had. Lord, save me or
[1:39:10] I'll perish." In desperation, he called
[1:39:13] out and a hand reached out and picked
[1:39:14] him up. He said, "You have the same
[1:39:17] thing." He says, "That's it. When you
[1:39:20] cry out, maybe this woman, mother,
[1:39:22] whatever it was to her, a little son,
[1:39:24] grandson, nephew, whatever it was, cried
[1:39:26] out in despair, God heard. Then we find
[1:39:29] out that in the sinking, God heard him.
[1:39:31] And in the line of duty, he started to
[1:39:33] sink. He says he
[1:39:36] failed. He
[1:39:37] says, he says, no matter if you fail,
[1:39:41] that doesn't have nothing to do with
[1:39:44] it. We all fail. We're a failure to
[1:39:47] begin with, but we've got somebody
[1:39:49] standing now with a strong hand who can
[1:39:52] reach us and take us up above the water.
[1:39:55] See, what happens is we fail and we
[1:39:57] think that because we fail, we can't ask
[1:39:59] God to turn it into a nonfailure. We
[1:40:02] think because we've done everything we
[1:40:04] can and it still doesn't work that we're
[1:40:05] not allowed to go to God. Church, that's
[1:40:07] what God specializes in is turning our
[1:40:09] failures into
[1:40:11] victories to taking us from where we are
[1:40:13] to where we ought to be. to take us from
[1:40:16] where to are we are to what we always
[1:40:18] were to take us up in the level of the
[1:40:21] word. That's his specialty is to take
[1:40:23] our failures and turn them into
[1:40:24] overcoming victories. Don't let yourself
[1:40:27] hold you
[1:40:29] back. Don't let yourself hold you back
[1:40:31] this morning. Amen. You've got a right
[1:40:34] to say, "Lord, I failed, but I'm not
[1:40:37] resting in my strength or my victories
[1:40:39] anyways. I'm trusting you to take me
[1:40:41] through." You know, we read earlier th
[1:40:44] those words sober and discreet and that
[1:40:46] they they speak of sound mindness and
[1:40:48] they speak of temperance on our
[1:40:50] approach. This goes for all of us, not
[1:40:52] just mothers, but we see that temperance
[1:40:54] is a Holy Spirit fruit. Amen. And Paul
[1:40:56] said, we've been given a sound mind as
[1:40:58] he said to
[1:40:59] Timothy. Let me ask you mothers this
[1:41:01] morning, how hard is it to maintain a
[1:41:03] sound mind day in and day
[1:41:07] out? One slight
[1:41:09] frown. It ain't easy.
[1:41:14] day in and day out, same thing. But
[1:41:17] guess what? Your body goes through four
[1:41:18] hormone cycles every
[1:41:21] month. And so your emotions go up and
[1:41:24] down. The physical needs of your body go
[1:41:27] up and down. The kids go up and
[1:41:30] down. Life happens. How hard is it to
[1:41:34] keep a sound mind, to stay level, to
[1:41:37] stay in balance, to stay focused? How
[1:41:40] hard is
[1:41:41] it? It ain't
[1:41:43] easy. It ain't easy. I'm mommy and daddy
[1:41:45] these days. It ain't
[1:41:48] easy. It's hard enough as a man. And
[1:41:50] we're built to compartmentalize things.
[1:41:52] And maybe it's a little simpler for us
[1:41:54] to go through in life. Amen. But God is
[1:41:56] a present help in a time of trouble. And
[1:41:58] I want to speak to you this morning on
[1:41:59] the authority to have a sound mind. A
[1:42:02] sound mind that when life blows up, you
[1:42:04] don't have to blow up with it. when
[1:42:06] things get out of kilter, when things go
[1:42:08] way further than you think they should,
[1:42:10] that you don't have to fall down or fall
[1:42:12] apart. I want to take us back to the
[1:42:14] story of the Shounomite woman. And
[1:42:16] remember what happened is she she built
[1:42:18] a room. She built an extension onto her
[1:42:20] house for the prophet Elisha and he
[1:42:22] said, "I'd like to do something for her.
[1:42:23] What should I do?" And and uh his
[1:42:26] servant went to her and she said,
[1:42:27] "Listen, I don't need anything. I dwell
[1:42:28] with my people. She was a gentile. I've
[1:42:30] got everything I need. It's okay." But
[1:42:32] Gahesy, the servant said, "But she
[1:42:34] doesn't have a child." And so Elisha
[1:42:36] called her and he said, "Listen, you're
[1:42:37] going to have a son." And she said,
[1:42:39] "Don't don't tease me like that. That's
[1:42:41] not that's hurtful." He says, "As the
[1:42:43] Lord liveth, thus sayeth the Lord about
[1:42:45] the time of year, you'll have a child."
[1:42:48] It says now in 2 Kings that the woman
[1:42:51] conceived and bare a son at that season
[1:42:53] that Elisha had said unto her, according
[1:42:56] to the time of life. And when the child
[1:42:57] was grown, it fell on a day that he went
[1:42:59] out to his father to the reapers. And he
[1:43:01] said to his father, "My head, my head."
[1:43:03] And he said to Alag, "Carry him to his
[1:43:05] mother." And when he had taken him and
[1:43:07] brought him to his mother, he sat on her
[1:43:09] knees till noon and then he died.
[1:43:11] Church, what would your response be as a
[1:43:14] mother? The son of promise has come in.
[1:43:17] He's sick and then he dies on your
[1:43:20] lap. This is the promise of God. This is
[1:43:23] your dream come true. This is your
[1:43:25] heart's desire laying in your arms. And
[1:43:27] now death has taken him away. You have
[1:43:30] no heir now. You have no future for your
[1:43:32] family.
[1:43:34] Everything that God has given you, he's
[1:43:35] pulled away from you in one
[1:43:37] moment. Amen. We're talking about
[1:43:40] authority to have a sound mind this
[1:43:42] morning. That when things spiral out of
[1:43:44] control, you don't have to spiral with
[1:43:46] it. That when things blow up, you don't
[1:43:48] blow up with it. That when things go to
[1:43:50] the depths of despair, you can rise
[1:43:52] above it. Amen. That you aren't dragged
[1:43:54] around by circumstances, but you're held
[1:43:57] by something else. Amen. A sound mind
[1:44:00] holds us when the situation calls for us
[1:44:02] to fall apart. What held this woman?
[1:44:05] Watch her response. It says, "And she
[1:44:07] went up and laid him on the bed of the
[1:44:09] man of God and shut the door upon him
[1:44:12] and went out." No theatrics, no big
[1:44:14] scene, no weeping and wailing, just
[1:44:16] calm, deliberate
[1:44:18] action. Says, "And she called unto her
[1:44:21] husband." She didn't she didn't make a
[1:44:24] big stink.
[1:44:26] doesn't even say she told him he was
[1:44:28] dead. She said, "Send me, I pray thee,
[1:44:31] one of the young men and one of the
[1:44:32] asses that I may run to the man of God
[1:44:34] and come again." And he said unto there,
[1:44:36] "Wherefore will there go to him today?
[1:44:37] It's neither new moon nor Sabbath." And
[1:44:38] she said to him, "It shall be
[1:44:41] well." He said, "You don't even know
[1:44:44] where he is because it's not a special
[1:44:46] day. He could be
[1:44:48] anywhere." Hubby's not helping here,
[1:44:52] church. How you going to find him? It
[1:44:55] shall be well. Talk about the authority
[1:44:58] of a sound mind. Then she saddled and
[1:45:01] asked and said to her servant, "Drive
[1:45:02] and go forward. Slack not thy writing
[1:45:04] for me except I bus thee." Church, is
[1:45:06] she freaking out? Is she losing her
[1:45:09] mind? Is she weeping and wailing? Is she
[1:45:11] blubbering into her
[1:45:13] sleeve? Come on. It's easy to do, isn't
[1:45:15] it? When things fail, when health fails,
[1:45:18] when relationships fail, when kids get
[1:45:20] sick, when money's going out faster than
[1:45:22] it's coming in, it's easy to get caught
[1:45:24] up in these things. Amen. When the
[1:45:26] situation's bigger than you, it's easy
[1:45:28] to
[1:45:30] fall. I want you to see what keeps her
[1:45:33] sane in an insane time, in an insane
[1:45:36] world. Abraham says her faith was in
[1:45:40] action. She's just as cool as she could
[1:45:42] be. Something had struck her in that
[1:45:45] crucial moment. Something had taken a
[1:45:47] hold. And if something would take a hold
[1:45:49] in the time of death in the family, what
[1:45:51] more ought it to hold tonight when the
[1:45:53] coming of the Lord Jesus Christ is at
[1:45:55] hand? He said something struck her.
[1:45:59] Inspiration. Where's your inspiration
[1:46:01] coming from? Cuz let me tell you,
[1:46:03] there's two sources that are going to
[1:46:04] try and strike you in every situation.
[1:46:07] You want to choose the right one. He
[1:46:09] says she walked around, took the little
[1:46:11] fellow, laid him up on the prophet's
[1:46:13] bed, and her husband said, "Oh dear, oh
[1:46:15] dear, what will we do?" She said, 'All
[1:46:16] is well, husband. Amen. Her faith sprung
[1:46:19] her to action. When your faith can take
[1:46:21] action to a place that down in your soul
[1:46:24] that says so, not reasoning, but
[1:46:26] something in here said so, then,
[1:46:28] brother, something takes place, you
[1:46:30] begin moving because it's impossible for
[1:46:33] it not to be. He says, "That's true."
[1:46:35] Then notice what took place. She said,
[1:46:37] "Saddle me a mule and ride towards Mount
[1:46:39] Carmel just as hard as you can go. Don't
[1:46:42] you even slack up lest I bid you to." He
[1:46:44] says, "I like that." She was on her road
[1:46:46] to meet the man of God. She had a need
[1:46:48] and she knew that Elisha was God's
[1:46:50] representative. She knew that Elisha was
[1:46:52] going to give the baby back his life.
[1:46:54] And she knew that Elisha was supremely
[1:46:56] recognized and vindicated that it was
[1:46:57] God's servant. He says, "And tonight,
[1:46:59] the Holy Ghost is the vindication that
[1:47:02] he's here, that his power is with the
[1:47:04] believer."
[1:47:05] See, I'm not trying to teach you about a
[1:47:07] day of yesterday. I'm trying to teach
[1:47:08] you of a day of today. He says, you've
[1:47:10] got a place to go to. You have authority
[1:47:13] within you by the presence of the Holy
[1:47:15] Spirit in your life. He says, "If we
[1:47:17] could only recognize that inspiration
[1:47:20] that leads us in the crucial
[1:47:23] moment to make our decision according to
[1:47:27] the word of God, not according to what
[1:47:30] the neighbor's going to think or
[1:47:31] according to what somebody else is going
[1:47:32] to say or what my pastor will say or my
[1:47:35] members will say, what my neighbors will
[1:47:37] say, but what God is leading you to." He
[1:47:40] says, "Then she made the decision."
[1:47:43] Mothers, you have authority to stand on
[1:47:45] your own two feet and make a sound
[1:47:48] decision based on what the word says.
[1:47:52] Amen. You are allowed to stand back and
[1:47:55] say, "Hold on a second. What does the
[1:47:59] word
[1:48:00] say? What does God say? And where is he
[1:48:04] in this situation?" You got a right to
[1:48:06] say, "Hold on a second.
[1:48:09] Let's let's take a look beyond the
[1:48:12] situation and see what's behind the
[1:48:15] situation because the scripture says all
[1:48:18] things work for good to him who are the
[1:48:23] called according to his purpose. So in
[1:48:26] every situation there's an inspiration
[1:48:28] laying there for you to catch that comes
[1:48:31] from God and that is a sound mind.
[1:48:35] That's what a sound mind is. It catches
[1:48:37] the inspiration of God in the situation.
[1:48:39] And until you catch that inspiration,
[1:48:42] you don't have to give anything to that
[1:48:44] situation. You don't have to acknowledge
[1:48:46] it. You don't have to make a decision.
[1:48:48] You don't have to move back. You can
[1:48:50] stand there until God gives you his
[1:48:52] inspiration of what to do.
[1:48:55] Amen. It says, "So she went and came
[1:48:58] under the man of God to Mount Carmel.
[1:49:00] And it came to pass when the man of God
[1:49:02] saw her a far off that he said to
[1:49:03] Gahesia a servant, Behold yonder at
[1:49:05] Shunomite, "Run now, I pray thee, to
[1:49:07] meet her, and say unto her, it is it
[1:49:10] well with thee. Is it well with thy
[1:49:12] husband? Is it well with the child?" And
[1:49:15] she answered, "It is well." Mothers, you
[1:49:19] have a an authority this morning in
[1:49:21] every situation to say, "It is well." If
[1:49:24] the child is sick, it is well. If
[1:49:27] husband's not happy, it is well. If the
[1:49:29] money's not there, it is well. If life's
[1:49:32] not treating you the way you want it to
[1:49:33] treat you, it is well. If you can't see
[1:49:35] past this morning, it is well. You've
[1:49:39] got authority to declare what you cannot
[1:49:42] see, but by the word according to your
[1:49:44] faith to say, "It is well." That's your
[1:49:48] authority this morning. You don't have
[1:49:50] to wait for a hubby to come home.
[1:49:53] You have an opportunity in the sanctity
[1:49:55] of your own home and in your own life to
[1:49:57] stand on your own two feet and say it is
[1:50:01] well by what? Faith. By inspiration of
[1:50:05] the word because you've gone and you've
[1:50:07] seen what's behind this. And you got a
[1:50:10] promise waiting there that you're
[1:50:11] holding on to in your life. Amen. What
[1:50:12] do you do when you say that, church? You
[1:50:14] declare your
[1:50:16] inspiration. You declare where your
[1:50:18] source is. You declare where your life
[1:50:20] is. You declare where your
[1:50:22] representation is and it's in the word
[1:50:24] of God. Amen. And it's putting your
[1:50:26] faith into action by
[1:50:28] speaking. Church, I'm not saying speak
[1:50:30] it in your
[1:50:31] head. When that kid wakes up
[1:50:34] sick, say it is
[1:50:37] well. Lay hands on them and say, "Lord
[1:50:40] Jesus, it is well. By your stripes, they
[1:50:43] are
[1:50:44] healed. Lord, you see my budget
[1:50:46] struggles. It is well. Lord, you see my
[1:50:50] focus troubles. It is well. Lord, you
[1:50:53] see my marital troubles. It is
[1:50:55] well. Lord, you see my pastoral
[1:50:58] troubles. It is well. Don't look to the
[1:51:01] situation. Look to the inspiration of
[1:51:03] the word for your situation. Amen.
[1:51:06] That's where you speak of where your
[1:51:07] rest is, where your trust is, and where
[1:51:09] your faith really is. Amen. church, you
[1:51:12] can women, you can go to Proverbs 31,
[1:51:14] and I thought most most Christian
[1:51:16] mothers would want to be a Proverbs 31
[1:51:18] wife and
[1:51:19] mother. You look there and that's an
[1:51:21] amazing woman. But don't just leave that
[1:51:23] for Proverbs 31 woman. That is your
[1:51:28] heritage. That is your authority is to
[1:51:31] say, "Lord, make me a Proverbs 31 wife.
[1:51:35] Make me a Proverbs 31 mother." Amen. But
[1:51:37] that doesn't happen overnight. It
[1:51:40] doesn't happen overnight. Don't beat
[1:51:42] yourself up where you are. Just look for
[1:51:45] growth. Look for growth. Look for
[1:51:48] change. Say, "Lord, build me up.
[1:51:51] Strengthen me. Help me to learn. Help me
[1:51:54] to grow. Help me to be more focused.
[1:51:55] Help me to be more deliberate. Help me
[1:51:57] to have a sound
[1:51:59] mind." You've got authority. If you've
[1:52:01] surrendered your will to God to go to
[1:52:03] him and say, "Lord, make me
[1:52:06] productive. Give me strength for the
[1:52:08] day.
[1:52:10] Give me
[1:52:11] focus. Give me a heart that's focused on
[1:52:14] what matters.
[1:52:16] Amen. That doesn't mean it's going to
[1:52:18] happen overnight. I'm not here to give
[1:52:20] you that promise. Cuz character's got to
[1:52:23] come. And character is always a work of
[1:52:25] time. Remember what character is.
[1:52:27] Character is a
[1:52:28] victory. It's a victory. That means you
[1:52:30] got to go through a battle to get it.
[1:52:32] Amen. But here's the thing. If you've
[1:52:34] got that sound mind and you recognize
[1:52:36] your authority as a mother, you keep
[1:52:37] moving no matter what. and you can keep
[1:52:40] moving no matter what. That's what God
[1:52:42] wants to see. God wants to see will she
[1:52:45] commit regardless of where she's
[1:52:48] at. Brothers, we don't get to choose if
[1:52:50] we go to work every morning, do we? We
[1:52:54] don't work. Nobody gets
[1:52:55] paid. No food on the table, no clothes
[1:52:57] on our backs, no house over our head, no
[1:52:59] vehicle in the driveway. Mothers, you
[1:53:02] don't have a
[1:53:04] choice. The word has placed you where
[1:53:07] you
[1:53:08] are. And so you've got a promise to hold
[1:53:10] you in that position. We don't have
[1:53:12] choices. We have surrender. We have
[1:53:15] yielding. And in that comes the strength
[1:53:17] that we need to do what we're supposed
[1:53:19] to do in our lives. Amen. God will honor
[1:53:22] your faith. But too many times what's
[1:53:24] happening is God's trying to get trying
[1:53:25] to see if we're really committed before
[1:53:27] he steps on the scene. That's what the
[1:53:28] trial of your faith is. Will you keep
[1:53:31] going even when he doesn't seem to be
[1:53:32] there? And that's showing him I'm
[1:53:34] committed. I believe. I'm trusting. And
[1:53:37] I'm going to do what I can. and I'll
[1:53:39] trust you to make up the rest. Amen.
[1:53:40] See, we want God to do everything so we
[1:53:42] don't have to do anything. That's the
[1:53:44] ideal situation. That's a sugar daddy.
[1:53:46] That's a grandpa. That's what pop does.
[1:53:49] Gives you everything without you having
[1:53:51] to work for it. That's not God. Amen.
[1:53:53] That's not the way God works. Amen. But
[1:53:55] if we're in the line of duty, and when I
[1:53:57] say in the line of duty, when we're
[1:53:58] active in the line of duty, when we're
[1:54:02] doing, you can't be in the line of duty
[1:54:04] if you're not doing anything. Because in
[1:54:06] the line of duty, you have orders to
[1:54:08] carry out. So if we're not standing
[1:54:10] around because we feel helpless or
[1:54:12] useless or just no good at it. Listen,
[1:54:15] if you've been given an order, it's
[1:54:17] because you're able to carry it
[1:54:18] out. Soldiers aren't given orders they
[1:54:21] can't carry out. So when the word gives
[1:54:23] us a command, it also gives us authority
[1:54:25] to claim what we need to get that done.
[1:54:27] And everything in heaven is behind us to
[1:54:29] make it happen. Amen. Mothers, you have
[1:54:32] the the the authority to expect God to
[1:54:34] move in your body, in your life, in your
[1:54:37] home, in your ministry every single day
[1:54:39] of your life. That's what I'm trying to
[1:54:41] show you here today. He says, "Now, if
[1:54:44] you go out and say mountain, move, I
[1:54:46] want to show you I can do it." That
[1:54:48] won't do it. But if it's in the line of
[1:54:49] duty when God has commanded you to do
[1:54:51] something, like he said to Moses, "Why
[1:54:53] cry to me? Speak to the children."
[1:54:55] People today are crying all the time,
[1:54:57] "Lord, what next? What next?"
[1:55:00] They're waiting on God to get them.
[1:55:03] They're waiting for God to do the
[1:55:05] movement. And God's saying, "I've given
[1:55:07] you your
[1:55:09] orders." He said, "Just speak and go
[1:55:12] forward." That's right. God has
[1:55:14] commissioned us to do something, so
[1:55:15] let's do it. Don't stand around and
[1:55:17] think about it and say, "How can it
[1:55:18] happen?" Well, this is that. He says,
[1:55:20] "It make no makes no difference. If God
[1:55:23] said to do it, do it anyhow." He's still
[1:55:25] the God of miracles. Listen, when Moses
[1:55:28] came up to the Red Sea, he had never
[1:55:30] parted a Red Sea before, but the
[1:55:32] authority to part the Red Sea was there.
[1:55:34] He just didn't recognize it. And God
[1:55:37] didn't say, "Moses, I give you
[1:55:39] authority." He said, "Moses,
[1:55:41] speak." He didn't change Moses' power.
[1:55:44] He didn't change Moses' authority. He
[1:55:45] says, "Moses, you're in the line of
[1:55:47] duty. You're in your
[1:55:49] position. The power is already there.
[1:55:52] You just need faith to activate it.
[1:55:56] And what did Moses do? By faith, he
[1:55:59] acted and the waters
[1:56:02] parted. Church, did the waters part
[1:56:04] immediately for
[1:56:05] Moses? It blew all
[1:56:08] night. It didn't just happen. You see
[1:56:10] the the, you know, the movie The Ten
[1:56:12] Commandments and it looks like it just
[1:56:13] goes like that. It doesn't. It blew all
[1:56:17] night. And when they woke up in the
[1:56:19] morning, there was a way
[1:56:21] made. Moses spoke. God went to work.
[1:56:26] That's the authority you have in the
[1:56:28] line of duty. You speak, God goes to
[1:56:30] work. Amen. But Moses didn't sit back.
[1:56:34] Moses said, "Everybody, get ready to go.
[1:56:37] Let's get lined up." Right? He still had
[1:56:39] a job to do. Joshua had a job to do. Get
[1:56:41] the people ready. Let's get ready to
[1:56:43] move cuz God's moving. That's what God's
[1:56:46] waiting for us to do. Get moving to show
[1:56:47] you're expecting him to do his part.
[1:56:49] Don't sit around till he does it. You
[1:56:51] keep moving cuz when you get to your
[1:56:52] barrier, God will open the door for you.
[1:56:54] God will make a way
[1:56:57] through. One more thought this
[1:57:00] morning. I've only covered a fraction of
[1:57:02] what I had in my general notes and I
[1:57:04] trimmed it down to this just to not hold
[1:57:06] us too long this morning. Amen. But I
[1:57:08] want to cover one special authority and
[1:57:10] it's not special to a mother, but I
[1:57:12] believe it's not it's not specific to a
[1:57:14] mother, I should say. But I believe it's
[1:57:16] special to a mother because she's got a
[1:57:18] love behind this authority that is so
[1:57:20] powerful. And that is the authority to
[1:57:22] plead the token. The authority to plead
[1:57:24] the token life of Jesus Christ over your
[1:57:26] children and have him move on the scene
[1:57:28] and have God move into action. I don't
[1:57:30] say this lightly this morning. This is
[1:57:32] the greatest thing that you could have.
[1:57:34] Amen. And this is for the the mother
[1:57:36] that has received the spirit of God is
[1:57:39] that you can plead the token over your
[1:57:41] family. And we see it through scripture
[1:57:42] so many times when mothers go to
[1:57:44] praying, what God does for those mothers
[1:57:46] and for their children and those they're
[1:57:47] praying for. And I'm not going to read a
[1:57:49] scripture, but I want to remind us of
[1:57:50] the story. Remember, Brother Bram tells
[1:57:52] a story how he was flying in an airplane
[1:57:54] and they had to land in Tennessee
[1:57:56] because of bad weather and then they
[1:57:57] they they put the plane down for the
[1:57:59] night and they were supposed to get up
[1:58:00] in the morning, leave at 7:00 a.m. and
[1:58:02] he said, "I got up at 5:00 a.m. and I
[1:58:04] wrote out some letters and I was walking
[1:58:05] to the came out of the hotel and I
[1:58:07] turned left, I think, to walk to the
[1:58:09] post office to post the letters and
[1:58:11] something said, go back the way you
[1:58:13] came." Okay, so he's only got a little
[1:58:16] bit of time before his plane takes off
[1:58:18] and something says to him, "Go back the
[1:58:20] way you came." He says, "Lord, is that
[1:58:21] you?" And it said, "Go back the way you
[1:58:23] came." And he went back and he walked
[1:58:25] past his hotel and he kept walking. And
[1:58:28] he says, "What now?" And he said, "Just
[1:58:31] keep walking." And he walked church for
[1:58:35] hours. He didn't walk for 10 minutes. He
[1:58:38] walked for hours. And he walked for
[1:58:40] hours. And he says, "I looked at my
[1:58:42] watch." He says, "And it was time for my
[1:58:44] plane to leave." He says, "And I'm
[1:58:46] walking down. I was in the colored
[1:58:47] section of town." He says, "And I he
[1:58:49] came up and he he saw a woman leaning on
[1:58:51] the on the the front gate." He says,
[1:58:54] "And she was crying, but as I
[1:58:56] approached, she saw me and she started
[1:58:59] to wipe away her tears and she started
[1:59:01] to smile. And as I walked by, she said,
[1:59:05] "Good morning, person. I want you to
[1:59:08] listen to this now." Authority to plead
[1:59:10] the token. And he said, "I want to ask
[1:59:12] you something. How did you know I was a
[1:59:14] parson?" She said, "Parson, just a
[1:59:16] minute." And she said, "Did you ever
[1:59:17] read that story about the Shunimite
[1:59:18] woman in the Bible?" I said, "Yes,
[1:59:20] ma'am." She said, "I'm that kind of
[1:59:21] woman." And said, "I prayed to the same
[1:59:24] God, the God of Elijah." Said, "I
[1:59:26] prayed. I asked him and promised him if
[1:59:28] he'd give me a child that I would love
[1:59:29] it, take care of it, and would dedicate
[1:59:31] to him." And she said, "The Lord gave me
[1:59:33] a boy. I loved him and I still love him.
[1:59:35] I dedicated him to the Lord, but said,
[1:59:37] "Parson, I'm sorry. He's gone astray."
[1:59:40] Said, "Two days he's been unconscious.
[1:59:42] The doctor was here and said, "He'll
[1:59:44] never wake up no more. He's unconscious.
[1:59:46] Church, she had done all she could do.
[1:59:48] She raised him, right? She took him to
[1:59:51] church. She taught him the word. She
[1:59:53] gave him everything she could as a godly
[1:59:55] mother. And in the end, he walked
[1:59:57] away. And she watched him destroy his
[2:00:00] life in a couple short years. And he's
[2:00:03] laying here and he's got a veneerial
[2:00:04] disease that's incurable. And he's
[2:00:06] unconscious. And the doctors say he's
[2:00:08] never coming out of it,
[2:00:10] church. But look what's happened.
[2:00:14] She's been pleading the
[2:00:16] token. She's been in prayer. He says,
[2:00:19] "Here's sovereign grace to a mother's
[2:00:22] love." Said, "I she said I was sitting
[2:00:25] in my bed last night, par. I said, "Oh
[2:00:26] Lord, you give me the baby in answer to
[2:00:29] prayer. I turned it back to you
[2:00:30] according to what I promised you. Now,
[2:00:32] Lord, he's made a mistake and gone in
[2:00:34] the wrong company and he's dying with
[2:00:36] veneerial disease and said, "Now Lord, I
[2:00:38] love that child." He said, "There's
[2:00:40] love." And when love is projected,
[2:00:43] divine grace has got to step in. She
[2:00:46] said, "Now I pray thee, Lord, here is my
[2:00:48] baby. You gave it to me, but where is
[2:00:50] your Elijah?" She said, "Oh Lord, have
[2:00:53] mercy." She said, "And I prayed pretty
[2:00:56] near all
[2:00:59] night." Church, we've got a part. Her
[2:01:02] part was to pray all
[2:01:05] night. This wasn't just a now I lay me
[2:01:07] down to sleep, I pray the Lord my son's
[2:01:09] soul to keep. She prayed all
[2:01:13] night.
[2:01:16] Amen. She said, "Just this morning, just
[2:01:19] before the day broke, I dreamed a
[2:01:22] dream. I saw a man come walking down the
[2:01:26] street wearing a light tan suit and a
[2:01:28] tan hat." And said the Lord and and said
[2:01:30] that the Lord said, "I'll send him." And
[2:01:33] she said, "I've been standing here ever
[2:01:34] since daylight and that's just the way I
[2:01:37] was dressed." says, "Brother Bram, he's
[2:01:38] wearing a tan suit and a tan hat." He
[2:01:40] said, "When love is projected with the
[2:01:42] right motive behind it, divine grace has
[2:01:45] to step in." And not knowing, I said,
[2:01:47] "Well, your boy's dying." She said,
[2:01:49] "Yes." And when I patted her on the
[2:01:51] back, she was still wet from the morning
[2:01:54] dew. She had a man's shirt tied around
[2:01:57] her head. I thought, "Oh, God, this must
[2:01:58] be it." Just led by the spirit of God.
[2:02:01] He's been walking, not knowing why. And
[2:02:04] now this woman tells him, "I've been
[2:02:05] waiting for Elijah to come my way." He
[2:02:08] said, "All hopes were gone, but love was
[2:02:12] still there." He says these beautiful
[2:02:14] words, "Love doesn't fear, it waits on
[2:02:19] grace."
[2:02:20] Hallelujah. Love doesn't fear, it waits
[2:02:24] on grace. Brother Brandon would walk
[2:02:26] into that house and that boy was nearly
[2:02:28] dead. He said he was just mumbling and
[2:02:30] and he he said he was expressing his
[2:02:33] lost condition. Not not consciously but
[2:02:35] just saying it's dark. It's dark. And he
[2:02:37] was like he was in a storm. He said
[2:02:38] trying to row himself out of that
[2:02:40] darkness. And his feet were cold and
[2:02:42] clammy. He says he was nearly
[2:02:44] dead. And he told her to pray. And he
[2:02:46] said he prayed like she knew who she was
[2:02:49] talking to. And then he prayed and he
[2:02:51] said I said heavenly father she asked me
[2:02:53] to pray. I don't understand this here.
[2:02:55] I've missed my plane and you have to
[2:02:57] walk. you have me walk down this way and
[2:03:00] now the only thing that you seemingly
[2:03:01] that you're here. He says, 'Now Lord,
[2:03:03] hear the prayer of this poor old sainted
[2:03:06] mother. And while I was praying, I heard
[2:03:08] him say, "Mama, oh mama, what was it?"
[2:03:10] He said, "Grace was taking a hold. She
[2:03:13] raised up. She began smiling, wiping her
[2:03:15] great big fat cheeks." She said, "Yes,
[2:03:18] honey." Said, "This is your mommy." He
[2:03:20] said, "Mama, it's getting light in the
[2:03:22] room." That old ship of Zion, the grace
[2:03:24] of God had picked him up and calmed the
[2:03:27] sea. He says, "What was it?"
[2:03:31] It was love
[2:03:32] projecting, grace taking over. Amen. He
[2:03:36] said, "I left the place and hurried real
[2:03:38] quick. Went down, got me a taxi cab,
[2:03:40] went to the plane, and they were making
[2:03:42] their last call, it had been held up two
[2:03:46] hours."
[2:03:48] He said, "What? When divine
[2:03:52] love led by the Holy Ghost is
[2:03:56] projected," he says, think of it. The
[2:03:58] love of God and the grace of God bought
[2:04:02] an airplane out of the skies. Before she
[2:04:06] had prayed, church, before she had
[2:04:10] prayed, God had grounded Elijah the
[2:04:13] night before she goes into prayer. And
[2:04:16] all he needs is the spirit of God to
[2:04:18] lead him to her. Then before she prays,
[2:04:20] the God that liveth and seeth has opened
[2:04:23] a well of grace right there. And she
[2:04:25] doesn't even know about it. She's
[2:04:26] praying through the night and the answer
[2:04:28] is sitting in a hotel in downtown.
[2:04:33] You talk about authority to plead the
[2:04:35] token. When the love for your child goes
[2:04:38] before the throne of God, church, what
[2:04:40] happens? He'll ground his prophet. He'll
[2:04:43] bring his answer your way. The answer
[2:04:45] was there. She didn't even know it. And
[2:04:47] what did he do? He didn't put his
[2:04:49] prophet out. He held the plane an extra
[2:04:52] two hours so he could get on and
[2:04:53] continue on his way. Remember what Jesus
[2:04:55] said? I must needs go by way of Samaria.
[2:04:59] Samaria's out of the way to
[2:05:01] Jericho. Samaria's out of the way. But
[2:05:04] there was a woman that had a need. And
[2:05:06] God grounds this prophet, a man that
[2:05:09] prays for the sick, a man that's got a
[2:05:11] gift of healing, and takes her to that
[2:05:13] takes him to that woman and that
[2:05:15] boy. He says, "Think of it. The love of
[2:05:18] God and the grace of God brought an
[2:05:20] airplane out of the skies and set it on
[2:05:22] the ground and held it there because of
[2:05:24] an ignorant colored woman's prayer and
[2:05:26] faith and her love for that little boy.
[2:05:28] He says, "If that will do it for that,
[2:05:31] what will it do for a born again group
[2:05:33] of people who are sitting together here
[2:05:35] like we are
[2:05:37] now?" See, I'm putting it in your
[2:05:40] lap. Where's your
[2:05:43] authority? He says, "A little later on,
[2:05:45] I came on a train. I I I cut this quote
[2:05:48] down and he he said, "I want got off the
[2:05:50] train to get a hamburger." I started
[2:05:52] walking along there and somebody said,
[2:05:53] "Hello, Parson Brandon." A young color
[2:05:56] fellow with a cap on said, "How are you,
[2:05:57] Parson?" I said, "Good morning, sir."
[2:05:59] Started walking. I thought, "Well, maybe
[2:06:00] he's been in some of the meetings." He
[2:06:02] said, "You don't know me, do you?" I
[2:06:03] said, "No, I don't believe I do." He
[2:06:05] said, "Remember that morning when the
[2:06:06] Lord led you down to my mammy? I'm the
[2:06:09] boy." He said, "I'm not only healed, but
[2:06:12] now I'm saved and I'm serving the Lord
[2:06:15] who healed me.
[2:06:17] Sometimes God's got to put you on your
[2:06:20] back. Don't worry if he puts your
[2:06:22] children on their back.
[2:06:25] Amen. They've got a praying mother. They
[2:06:28] got a praying father. That complete the
[2:06:30] token life over their life. He didn't
[2:06:35] just heal him, church. He healed him.
[2:06:37] Amen. That young man came and he gave
[2:06:39] his heart to the Lord and he served God.
[2:06:41] I believe. I'm not sure. I believe he
[2:06:43] may have even been a preacher after
[2:06:44] that. I'm not sure. I thought I read
[2:06:46] that somewhere. Don't hold me to it. But
[2:06:48] he served Christ after
[2:06:50] that. He said, "Oh, all that mother's
[2:06:53] prayers and dedication and love when she
[2:06:56] had tried everything, taken him to the
[2:06:58] church and he was baptized. All that she
[2:07:00] had done, sickness came and death laid
[2:07:03] at the door. And divine grace stepped in
[2:07:05] at the crucial moments." He says, "And
[2:07:08] obedience to divine love." What was it?
[2:07:11] It was divine love
[2:07:13] calling and divine grace leading the
[2:07:17] answer down into her city. One had to be
[2:07:20] obedient for the call. The other had to
[2:07:22] be obedient to the leadership. Amen.
[2:07:25] Let's stand together if we
[2:07:27] would. Mothers, I hope you can see
[2:07:29] you've got authority this
[2:07:31] morning. You've got
[2:07:33] impact for your home, for your family,
[2:07:36] for your mind, for your emotions, for
[2:07:38] the skills you need to handle your daily
[2:07:39] work as a mother. You got authority
[2:07:41] before God for those things. Amen. You
[2:07:44] got authority to plead for
[2:07:46] salvation. You got authority to ask for
[2:07:49] healing. Listen, the scripture doesn't
[2:07:51] require you to be a minister to lay your
[2:07:53] hands on somebody. You've got authority
[2:07:56] by the spirit of God inside of you and
[2:07:57] by the word of God to lay your hands on
[2:07:59] your children, to lay your hands on your
[2:08:01] husband and say, "Lord, heal them. Lord,
[2:08:05] touch them. Lord, deliver them. Lord,
[2:08:07] work in their lives. Lord, give them a
[2:08:09] heart of worship. Lord, give him a heart
[2:08:10] to serve you. The prayers of a mother
[2:08:14] tied by the love of her child hold great
[2:08:16] sway in God's presence. Amen. You got
[2:08:19] authority to expect. And how many times
[2:08:21] does it look like things have gone too
[2:08:23] far, too bound? And listen, sometimes
[2:08:26] they can be too bound up in religion.
[2:08:29] It's not always out in the world.
[2:08:30] Sometimes they're bound by systems.
[2:08:31] Sometimes they're bound by ministries.
[2:08:33] Sometimes they're bound by marriage.
[2:08:35] Listen, church, it's never too late.
[2:08:37] Don't ever think it's too far gone that
[2:08:39] God won't hear your prayer. You've got
[2:08:41] authority. You've got representation by
[2:08:43] your relationship to go before God and
[2:08:46] ask for these things. And he's just
[2:08:47] waiting for you to call. That's the only
[2:08:50] thing that he asks. As I said earlier,
[2:08:52] Jesus said, "Ask that your joy may be
[2:08:56] full." We sit here and we think, "Will
[2:08:58] he answer? Will he do it?" He'll do it.
[2:09:02] You just got to ask in faith.
[2:09:06] Don't go as a last resort. Go as a first
[2:09:09] resort. Make him the preeminence. Make
[2:09:12] him the priority and say, "Lord, I'm
[2:09:14] going to do everything I can, but the
[2:09:16] results are in your hands." All God ever
[2:09:20] asked us to do was our best. He never
[2:09:23] asked us to do his job. He asked us to
[2:09:25] commit our ways to him. Acknowledge him
[2:09:28] and he'd direct us and he'd lead us. And
[2:09:30] he'd guide and he'd provide. You've got
[2:09:32] authority this morning, mothers. You've
[2:09:34] got
[2:09:35] authority. You got authority to have a
[2:09:37] sound
[2:09:38] mind. To not be tossed to and fro, to
[2:09:41] not be overrun by emotions, not be
[2:09:43] overrun by hormones, not be overrun by
[2:09:47] situations, loneliness, despair,
[2:09:49] whatever it might be. You got a right to
[2:09:51] go in God and say, "God, I'm I I'm
[2:09:53] reporting for service. I'm reporting for
[2:09:56] duty, and I'm trusting you to get me
[2:09:58] through." Amen. Amen. God bless you
[2:10:01] mothers this morning. certainly
[2:10:02] appreciate every one of you. The
[2:10:04] wannabes, the going to bees, the already
[2:10:07] ours, and the almost dunes. Amen. Every
[2:10:10] one of you is so important in the
[2:10:11] kingdom of God. Amen. The fifth gospel
[2:10:15] if you can be a godly mother. God bless
[2:10:17] you richly this morning. Let's bow our
[2:10:18] heads, Lord God. Lord, we want to thank
[2:10:21] you this morning, Lord, for godly
[2:10:24] mothers, Lord, for women that are filled
[2:10:27] with the spirit of God, Lord, that can
[2:10:29] take you at your word, that can stand in
[2:10:32] the gap, Lord, that can rest in faith
[2:10:34] and trust that you do all things well.
[2:10:37] Lord, we're thankful for the testimonies
[2:10:39] we had this morning, Lord, the young to
[2:10:41] the old, Lord, of these sisters that
[2:10:43] have committed their lives to you and
[2:10:45] have seen the benefits, the realities of
[2:10:47] a living God. Lord, I pray for them,
[2:10:50] Lord, in this world that's trying to
[2:10:51] tear them apart, trying to tear down who
[2:10:54] and what they are. Lord, I pray you fill
[2:10:56] them a new with your spirit this
[2:10:57] morning. Lord, that you would strengthen
[2:10:59] them, that you would encourage them,
[2:11:01] Lord, to stand in their position that
[2:11:02] the word has declared is right and true
[2:11:04] for them. Lord, that they would see,
[2:11:07] Lord, that you've given them authority
[2:11:08] in that role, Lord, to hold up that word
[2:11:11] and let it live through them. Lord,
[2:11:14] bless them, encourage them, strengthen
[2:11:16] them, Lord. Lord, where they are short,
[2:11:19] where they have a lack, Lord, may you be
[2:11:21] the overfilling blessing for each one of
[2:11:24] them. We pray. Grant us grace, Lord, as
[2:11:26] husbands, as fathers to support them,
[2:11:29] Lord, to love them as you loved us.
[2:11:32] Lord, give us grace and patience, mercy
[2:11:34] day by day. Lord, help us to share the
[2:11:36] burdens where we can. Lord, bless your
[2:11:39] people now. We pray in Jesus Christ's
[2:11:41] name we ask it. Amen.
[2:11:44] I will praise the mighty name of Jesus.
[2:11:52] 1236. My trbled
[2:11:57] soul, why so weigh
[2:12:02] down? You were not
[2:12:05] made to bear this heavy load.
[2:12:11] So cast all your
[2:12:15] burdens upon the
[2:12:19] Lord cuz Jesus
[2:12:22] [Laughter]
[2:12:23] cares and he cares for
[2:12:28] you and Jesus cares.
[2:12:33] He cares for
[2:12:37] you and all your
[2:12:40] worry won't help you make it
[2:12:45] through. So cast all your
[2:12:50] burdens upon the
[2:12:54] Lord. Trust
[2:12:57] again in the promise of his love.
[2:13:04] And I will
[2:13:06] praise the
[2:13:09] mighty
[2:13:10] name of
[2:13:13] Jesus.
[2:13:15] Praise the Lord, the lifter of my
[2:13:22] head.
[2:13:23] Praise the rock of
[2:13:28] my salvation.
[2:13:32] All my days are in his faithful
[2:13:39] hands. My anxious
[2:13:44] heart. Why so upset?
[2:13:49] When trials come, how you so
[2:13:54] easily
[2:13:57] forget to cast your
[2:14:01] burdens upon the
[2:14:06] Lord. Jesus
[2:14:08] [Laughter]
[2:14:09] cares and he cares for
[2:14:14] you. And Jesus cares.
[2:14:19] He cares for you
[2:14:23] and all your
[2:14:31] worries all
[2:14:35] [Music]
[2:14:41] your
[2:14:45] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[2:14:50] will
[2:14:51] praise the
[2:14:53] mighty name. Amen.

[2:15:06] Amen.
[2:15:08] Praise the rock of life.

[2:18:25] the
[2:18:28] number. I

[2:18:34] cares upon
[2:18:38] you. Amen.
[2:18:41] I
[2:18:43] lay all of my
[2:18:47] burdens down at your
[2:18:52] feet. And any
[2:18:55] time I don't
[2:18:59] know just what to do.
[2:19:04] I will
[2:19:06] cast all my
[2:19:09] care upon you. Praise the Lord.
[2:19:15] Hallelujah. I
[2:19:18] cast all my
[2:19:20] care upon
[2:19:24] you. Amen.
[2:19:28] I
[2:19:29] lay all of my
[2:19:33] burdens
[2:19:35] down to your
[2:19:38] feet. And any
[2:19:42] time I don't
[2:19:44] know just what to
[2:19:49] do. I will
[2:19:52] cast all my
[2:19:55] cares. Amen. And let's sing that again.
[2:19:57] I cast all my cares.
[2:20:01] Hallelujah. I
[2:20:03] cast all my
[2:20:07] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[2:20:12] Amen. Oh, I
[2:20:14] lay all of my
[2:20:18] burdens down at your feet.
[2:20:24] at any
[2:20:26] time. I don't
[2:20:29] know just what to
[2:20:34] do. I will
[2:20:37] pass all my
[2:20:39] care upon
[2:20:44] you. Amen. I believe it's
[2:20:48] 573. All is well.
[2:20:51] [Music]
[2:20:55] All is
[2:20:59] well.
[2:21:01] Amen. All is
[2:21:08] well. We have heard the message
[2:21:16] alone and all is

[2:29:15] and every one of us. Pray one for
[2:29:17] another. Again, it's so important that
[2:29:18] we do that. And remember those that
[2:29:21] weren't here today. Uh just remember
[2:29:23] brother John and uh the problem with his
[2:29:26] eye and according to the word he has no
[2:29:29] problem. So let's just uh pray for him
[2:29:32] and believe for him. Amen. That's where
[2:29:35] the enemy would try and attack the
[2:29:37] ministry so he could the shepherd so he
[2:29:40] could disperse the
[2:29:42] sheep. But we're praying for the
[2:29:44] ministry. Amen. So let's just sing that.
[2:29:47] Ask brother David to come and close in
[2:29:49] prayer. Praise the Lord. Let's just sing
[2:29:55] it. I just want to
[2:29:58] please the
[2:30:03] Lord. Be in his will in every
[2:30:10] way. To be lost in his
[2:30:15] presence. Finding his likeness.
[2:30:19] to hear him say, "Well done."
[2:30:26] Someday I just want to
[2:30:29] please the
[2:30:34] Lord. Be his will in every
[2:30:41] way. to be lost in his
[2:30:46] presence, found in his
[2:30:49] likeness, to hear him say, "Well done,
[2:30:53] son." One more time.
[2:30:57] Oh, I just want to

[2:31:12] to be lost in
[2:31:16] his found in his lik.
[2:31:27] Amen.
[2:31:28] [Music]
[2:31:35] [Music]
[2:31:45] Blessed Lord, how great thou art. Yes
[2:31:48] Lord, and we have heard half the story
[2:31:52] Lord of your
[2:31:54] greatness. Help us Lord we pray mighty
[2:31:57] God to do what we can oh Lord and return
[2:32:00] the favor for all you do for us Lord.
[2:32:05] grace to us Lord to do all we can for
[2:32:07] [Music]
[2:32:09] you Lord. We know the sisters Lord is
[2:32:12] subject Lord to the husband
[2:32:14] Lord but we also know that they will be
[2:32:18] restored Lord over their
[2:32:20] eternity and they will be he again Lord
[2:32:23] as only in this life Lord.
[2:32:26] So mighty God bless them in this life
[2:32:28] and bless us Lord in this life Lord to
[2:32:31] continue in your word
[2:32:33] Lord continue serving you Lord with all
[2:32:35] of our hearts and all of our soul all of
[2:32:38] our mind and all of our being Lord as
[2:32:41] you are in the father Lord Jesus the
[2:32:43] father in you and you in us and we in
[2:32:45] you Lord let us become
[2:32:48] one and Lord it's difficult to imagine
[2:32:52] Lord that why the whole world Lord can't
[2:32:54] be as as us Lord
[2:32:56] believe you and trust you and have faith
[2:32:59] in you and follow you Lord instead of
[2:33:02] following the world or in the things of
[2:33:04] the
[2:33:05] world. When you want a king to rule over
[2:33:07] Lord, not Samuel the
[2:33:09] prophet. You see yourself, Lord. It's
[2:33:11] not you, Samuel. They don't want. It's
[2:33:14] me they don't
[2:33:15] want. I wonder Lord. How can that be
[2:33:18] possible that no one wouldn't want you,
[2:33:21] Lord? That any person on this planet
[2:33:23] would not want you to to rule over them,
[2:33:26] Lord. Is a
[2:33:28] mystery. But Lord God, still with your
[2:33:30] grace, Lord, that we're the potter, we
[2:33:33] are the clay.
[2:33:35] [Music]
[2:33:37] Some are made for honor, the rest for
[2:33:41] dishonor. Let us not forget that Lord,
[2:33:43] your grace. Let us not spurn in your
[2:33:46] grace, Lord. But let us take your grace
[2:33:49] Lord and help give it to others Lord
[2:33:51] that they may have grace also and pray
[2:33:53] for one for
[2:33:54] another. And we pray Lord your grace
[2:33:57] Lord to all those who gone up before us
[2:33:58] Lord the Columbos, the
[2:34:00] Mandos. Pray you be with each and every
[2:34:02] one Lord. Brother Emanuel, Lord, who has
[2:34:05] missed much church here. Lord, pray you
[2:34:07] be with him also, Lord, to return back
[2:34:09] to the fort again, Lord. And grace might
[2:34:12] go to brother day, Lord, and all the
[2:34:14] others. We got sickness and you heal
[2:34:16] everyone, Lord, that there not be one,
[2:34:19] but that you would heal, Lord. We thank
[2:34:21] you for Jonathan, Lord. He's finally s
[2:34:24] see a doctor, Lord. Just pray that you
[2:34:26] rest the hands of that doctor, Lord. You
[2:34:28] do well, Lord, to do a good job, you'll
[2:34:31] come out fine, Lord. We will trust you
[2:34:34] Lord like the lady Lord. Brother Brener
[2:34:36] waited for Lord and the trilate woman
[2:34:40] Lord the black lady Lord she was prayed
[2:34:42] up Lord. She was ready and she believed
[2:34:45] Lord. She would see Elijah and sure
[2:34:47] enough she sure did. She saw you too
[2:34:50] Lord. So bless each one Lord. We leave
[2:34:52] her today Lord. Watch each one. Protect
[2:34:55] each one Lord and be with each one until
[2:34:57] we meet her again Lord in Jesus Christ's
[2:35:00] name. Amen.
