i first came in he was certainly well known then and they were singing some good songs and i don't know if this song is too old but just i enjoyed them singing it with 387 bringing in the sheaves and

amen okay god bless you all god bless you it's great to be back it's been a while i miss you all i don't really realize how much you miss people until you see them again you're like oh i miss these people i need to come back um so at the beginning of this year i well i thought that i would be back in st john's um in the new year but you know i pray to god and uh try to do god's perfect well and um he just led me to be back at home with my parents and uh with mom the under mom i've been getting some good woman training under my mom god bless my mom she's great so that's where i am now but um i do wish to come back because of course with church and everything so i just pray for me that god just continues leading me um i just want to give a little bit of a testimony before singing um so at the beginning of this year it was my new year's resolution and not only new year's resolution but my desire as well and my prayer to get closer to god and to also get to dive deeper into scripture and into the bible and i really want to thank god for answering my prayers i've been really having great moments with god all throughout these months just getting deeper with him deeper in scripture and um him just revealing certain things to me and opening my eyes to more depth of the word and also just leading me to certain books that i've picked up christian books that have really opened my eyes uh just getting deeper in christ and so i really want to thank god for that and just starting a revival within me um like usually when we think of revival we think of like big groups and big like big people and we might be people big churches and big groups big numbers in church but um i never really thought that you could have like a revival by yourself with god in your room so that was that's been a really great experience just between me and god and just want to thank god for restoring the joy of my salvation so the the song that i'm singing is just very directly goes with my testimony [Music] [Music] this world could never satisfy the longing in my soul when all is lost and hope is right when all i feel is cold i'm coming back to your presence i'm coming back to your presence cause there's a hunger first i am desperate embarrass me and i'm not waiting not anymore cause i need [Music] i feel it burning like a fire stronger than before you are the one that i desire i couldn't ask for more i'm coming back to your presence [Music] lord i'm coming back to your presence i am desperate he immersed me and i'm not waiting not anymore i need you lord i need you lord [Music] sweep me away oh sweep me away with you sweep me away come and sweep me away with you come and sweep me [Music] i am desperate [Music] i'm not waiting not anymore [Music] yes i need you lord i need you god i need you lord i need you lord i need you lord i need you lord i need you lord i need you lord i need you [Music] is [Music] cause i need you lord [Music] i am desperate no i'm not waiting not anymore cause i need you lord [Music] i am desperate i'm not waiting not anymore need you lord i need you lord i need you lord i need you lord i need you o lord i need you lord i need you lord [Music] hallelujah amen and thank you for that and uh let's turn to uh i'll turn to uh 5 25. it's lord prepare me and uh brother joe's going to come up just before brother john comes out so we can come up after this as we sing this [Music] lord prepare to be a sanctuary far and holy tried and true [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes jesus tried and true amen i'll be saying true amen praise the lord god bless you and welcome i guess our sister ruth is the name amen yeah it's been a while she'd like to say he's ours what stuff we saw the lord bless us amen sister priscilla there looks like her amen but she's the american version so the lord blessed sister priscilla but lord bless sister ruth and also the the colombo family amen so glad to have you with us and try praying that the lord is going to bless you in the going forth of the word but as was prayed pray the lord get our hearts to be hungry and thirsty what he what he's there to do to give out we got to be there to pull in amen amen oh yeah the preachers and the pastor he's there to all pray lord what would you want me to preach for and the congregation is praying lord let the pastor preach this let the pastor answer these questions and so on see so we don't just depend on the preacher amen god is what god's no wonder the prophet said god's waiting on us amen if you're waiting for us to respond by the grace of god and say lord i need this please teach me lord or encourage me father because it's all that's what the ministry of the word is for amen is to keep us moving and knowing that he was moving according to the will of god and oh yes there's any changes only the ministry is there god's working through the ministry to teach you to encourage you amen to do this to do that to live this way in that way amen god through the ministry of the word controlling us by grace so i pray grace to the lord bless our brother uh jonathan curlette as he comes to minister i just want to let you know that uh that as a result of the just the finish of this week's dealings with the government that our brother jonathan now is registered in newfoundland as a clergy with the bible believers association here in saint john's and in newfoundland basically so he'll be wherever he would go he would be a clergy representing the church here amen so we be in prayer for our brother johnson as he comes to minister the word amen please in the name of jesus pull on the word amen express your hunger and express your thirst for the word of god amen because again oh my the lord was right straight is the gate now is the way and few there be that bind it amen so we pray the grace of god that we're numbered with the few amen to find the way and you know brother again god is going to do that reveal that through the ministry again there are those that feel as i said when i was at the prayer meeting one time and i was at an altar in a certain church and this person came up and they were kneeling down praying lord thank you thank you you delivered us from from uh denominations and so on and church this church that now she said lord we don't have to be under we don't have to come under any man and no man's gonna have any authority i said lord i said she needs you so i said pray lord that you're going you're going to bring conviction in their hearts amen but it's like the brother said to brother brown brother brown oh the holy ghost is teaching me so i don't need any any any minister brother brown said brother he said that's not right he said the holy ghost teaching you he's going to you he's going to use a minister to do it amen that's just just a an idea that people have today or we come out of that now we're in into freedom i don't have to do this i don't have to do that well brother what god required of us sometimes in when we're in denominations god requires of us now amen but but there we're under the false teaching under the false preaching and so on but now we come under the true teaching and the truth and the truth anointing amen but it's still through the ministry because remember god has set in the church amen these this ministry that ministry the fightful ministry for wow perfecting of the saints amen by the grace of god so brother without that ministry you're not going to come to god's perfection amen and if you and if you're not willing to be subject to the ministry here you won't be there to be subject amen because remember when we leave here and go there amen there are those that sit with him and he's strong amen by the grace of god and they're going to exercise authority oh yeah over over all those outside the city amen so if we're subbing to authority here well we'll be there to be subject by the grace of god amen so the lord bless us and the lord bless our brother jonathan he comes to minister the word amen so we pray god bless him and god bless us through the hearing of the word amen do god be the glory amen so we we welcome our brother jonathan as a as another ministering brother registered with the bible believers association amen so it's official amen but again the government does recognize what myself and brother mark and brother bob did a while ago when we called our brother up and we prayed prayed for our brother uh jonathan and asking god to bless his ministry amen so that's official but now the government as newfoundland governments accepted that amen that we are we are declaring him to be a a brother or ministering brother with this with this church amen and of course they finally found uh it took a while for him to do this but because they couldn't find my registration amen but eventually they found it amen but it so happened that back there apparently it was registered i signed this and i was approved and this this gentleman signed it and so on but again the files were kept different back then amen as many many years ago and that's why they couldn't find them but they did find them eventually amen concerning brother journal being registered heir as a clergy for the for the bible believers association amen so now brother jonathan is also registered with us if we thank the lord for that we pray god to bless us through our brother jonathan's ministry let's stand and we're going to sing only believe and turn to our brother jonathan in the going forth of his word let's be in the spirit now amen by the grace of god again understand that it's true it is through the ministry god is bringing us to perfection for the glory of god amen only believe for our brother jonathan [Music] only believe oh only all things are possible all right [Music] possible [Music] jesus is here here all things are possible jesus jesus is here [Music] [Applause] jesus possible jesus is here amen heavenly father lord we can rest assured that you are here amen lord not because of what we feel or not because of what we think lord but because you said where two or three were gathered in your name there you be in the midst heavenly father and lord we've gathered this morning to hear your word amen lord to have your holy spirit have the preeminence lord all the glory the honor and the praise belongs to you this morning lord god amen lord we've lifted up our voices we've raised our hands lord we've given our breath to you this morning and lord we're just asking you to once again fulfill your word in the service amen lord that you would speak to heart and soul lord that you would change lives lord that you give us faith and strength to walk a little further lord climb a little higher amen rest a little more lord this morning we pray lord you know the needs of each one here i do not but lord may you just touch each one now we pray lord set aside this vessel lord that you would have the glory this morning lord amen grace to us we pray now in jesus christ's name we ask it amen amen amen that'll be it musicians thank you amen god bless you this morning good to be in service again let's turn to joshua chapter one if we would joshua chapter one amen good to see some visitors here colombo family it's always good to have the rest of them here not just josh amen and then sister ruth i don't think we've ever met sister but it's good to good to see you here amen god bless you amen joshua chapter one very familiar scripture since we've read it multiple times already that's where we're going to go from this morning amen joshua chapter 1 says then joshua commanded the officers of the people saying pass through the host and command the people saying prepare you victims for within three days you shall pass over this jordan to go in to possess the land which the lord your god giveth you to possess it amen you can have your seats this morning god bless you each one amen we're going to continue on our series with the overcomers and then this morning we want to speak on a title of super natural access amen supernatural access we've covered leadership we've covered election we've covered the the choosing of god but today we're going to talk about what it takes to go into the land and this is going to be at least the two service part maybe three there's a lot here and then when we talk about going over jordan and the process of of all of this there's a lot to it and i don't just want to skip over it because we've heard these things before i was talking to a good friend of mine the other day and he said don't ever presume that that people know what you're talking about don't ever presume that they remember what they've been taught amen we've had a pastor here for 40 years and i guarantee you there's things that he said that we've forgotten amen so i'm not going to i'm not going to skip through it real quickly because we know what this is or that is we're going to men just take our time and let the lord bless his word as it comes through to us amen amen so we're talking about going in amen we're going to be talking about crossing over jordan this morning and a lot of times people can see the fullness and the blessings of god in the scripture and they stand there and they're looking at them they can see them and they can say i want this and i want that but how many of them are willing to go the jordan way amen there's only one way to come into the kingdom of heaven there's only one way to cross over into the fullness of the promises of god amen and that's got to be through jordan amen brother brown talked about the third pull amen he talked about spoken word we see the gifts of the spirit the true gifts in the spirit we see the fruits of the spirit and we see so many denominations in so many churches these days even within the message if you look closely where they have created another way to get in there amen they have said if you believe a prophet came then you're in there if you believe the message you're here if you do this then you're saved if you do that then you're saved and there's only one way you can be saved the scripture says and that's acts 2 38 and that's jordan amen that's jordan for us it's not a coming out lots of people came out there's lots of people have wandered in the desert that have been provided for by christ through many many years where others have fallen away and died and they've stayed but now there's a coming in amen god doesn't just take you out he's got to bring you into something and that's where we want to go this morning amen amen so we're going to cover joshua 10 again one verse 10 again here it says then joshua commanded the officers of his people saying now now let's say man there's a warning given there is no surprise when it comes to crossing over jordan he doesn't just wake up one morning and say okay folks we're going across jordan what does he have he says the lord has given him a time and a season to do it and he prepares the people for it amen and then he sends messengers out to do it and says pass through the host and command the people saying prepare you victuals he's saying prepare food now they've been taken care of supernaturally for 40 years in the desert and all of a sudden he says prepare food something's going to change amen where they were going supernatural manna wasn't going to be available there was going to be some other way of feeding after that amen and they were going to have a portion of that for within three days you shall pass over this jordan so where are you going to pass over jordan and when three days time and a place to go in to possess the land that's why you're crossing over you're not going over to sightsee you're not going over there to grab some food and then we're going to come back but you're going in to possess the land once you're there you're going to stay there forever amen there is no coming back after this once you cross over jordan you're going to hold on to what you take there and you've got to take it in order to stay there he says what to go in to possess the land which the lord your god giveth you to possess it so this is not their idea this is not their plan amen this is something that god has called them to do and they are in obedience to do it this is not a whim this is not some man deciding that this place looks really good and let's take it but he says no this is the lord your god has given it to you to possess it this is god's plan this is god's purpose this is god's will and only on that basis are we to move forward amen we don't want to step out of his will amen jump forward to joshua chapter three we covered joshua chapter two which was about rahab in the last service so we're going to skip over that and jump all the way up to joshua chapter 3 in verse 1. now this is when they start to cross over jordan it says in joshua rose early in the morning and they removed from shatim and came to jordan he and all the children of israel and lodged there before they passed over and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host and they commanded the people saying when ye see the ark of the covenant of the lord your god and the priest the levites bearing it then ye shall remove from your place and go after it notice he says then you shall go when you see the word going forward then you go don't go before it you've got to wait amen when the word moves we move with it but we never lead the word the word leads us the word has to go ahead of us and that way you're confident of the way that you're going amen as believers we tend to be really good at what sticking with what god has said what god has done with holding to that but when it comes to turning the corner that's when we usually fail when the word moves on that's when we get stuck so often because we're so safe with what has been proven that we don't want to move forward as the holy spirit moves as the word moves ahead and takes us into deeper revelation takes us into a closer walk with god in these different things we don't like to do that because it's so safe to stay with what you know is proven but god doesn't stand still amen he doesn't stand still he's turning a corner and in this age what do we have we have god sent a prophet and everybody camped at god set a prophet and they stayed there and they believed it and they accepted every word that prophet said but then the prophet went off the scene and what happened the word moved on amen the prophet's word didn't change the prophet's word didn't lose his truth the holy spirit did not anoint his pro his message anymore but the word moved on and what did the word say now i'm dealing with the multi-member bride amen now i'm perfecting a bride you saw a son of man ministry you saw a wave sheath before you but now i've got to do that same work in you and if you stay here and say i believe god sent a prophet and you don't move beyond that what happens you're never going to cross over jordan you're never going to cross into your possession or your inheritance because you're sitting there looking at something that god has done and the words moving and you're not moving with it amen we have to have the holy spirit leading and guiding us individually day by day that's what crossing over jordan's going to do is it's going to bring us to individual leadership and possession of what god has called for each and every one of us amen we haven't forgotten god has sent a prophet i'm going to read a bazillion of his quotes in the coming weeks and months amen his pride this prophet's message is not dead amen what is it it's restored us to the truth of the word it's restored us to our position and the calling of god and the purpose of god in this age but we can't stay with god sent a prophet we've got to say what did he send him for and what is he doing today what has our pastor been hammering for the last months months and months what is god doing today not what did he do yesterday what is he doing today what is he going to do tomorrow and are you ready for it by listening to heating what he's saying today if you don't catch what he does today you're going to miss what he does tomorrow amen you've got to be ready to move amen verse 4 says yet there shall be a space between you and it between you and what the word like i said the word has to lead you can't go first it has to go first about two thousand cubits by measure neither come not near unto it that ye may know the way by which you must go for ye have not passed this way here two four has anybody gone on a rapture before i haven't i haven't gone in a rapture so what the word's got to lead us there because what we have the word which is christ he went in a rapturing and he went and he was translated into a new body he was glorified in front of them amen he's gone the way so the word has to lead us it's not just word scripture amen it's not just letters on a page it's word life it is the holy spirit it is christ the word that we're looking to amen that's where the denominations misses they can see this word but they can't see christ and then they can't see the life of the word moving amongst us in this day and age to bring us to a perfection which is the maturity of a bride amen amen what he says here sanctify yourself right you don't know the way but in order to go this way you've got to clean yourself up and that's a work that you do the holy spirit is there to help us with that right it'll quicken our hearts it'll convict us of what we're doing but you've got to do that work you've got to separate yourself amen that's what sanctification is it's a separating it's a cleaning out it's separating yourself from the world and the things of the world he says joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow the lord will do wonders among you today if you'll sanctify tomorrow he'll do wonders amen that's the promise you do what i said and then tomorrow i'll do what i said amen brother brown makes a point in the adoption series about this he says did you notice joshua before they crossed jordan joshua said go through the midst of the camp and clean your clothes and sanctify every one of you and let no man come at his wife for within three days you'll see the glory of god see it is a process of getting ready to inherit the promise now the promise to israel was god gave abraham the promise of the land of palestine and it was to be their possession forever and they was to always remain in this land there was no going back after this and anyone that left that land wasn't blessed they would be blessed in the ways that maybe the world would call blessed but they weren't blessed with the way that god calls them to be blessed amen amen the process didn't start on the banks of jordan amen this is not just a today sanctification then tomorrow you go in what happened he called them out of egypt under the blood right and then he brought him in the desert and he worked him in the desert until he cleaned a bunch of them up and got rid of the dead well literally you know we call it the the the um oh the dead falls and stuff in branches and stuff things that fall off and dead they got rid of all the extra stuff the heavy weight the dead weight that's what i was looking for literally the dead weight walking dead that's what they were and then what now he's got to bring them into something takes them out cleans them up then he says there's a last minute sanctification that's going to happen here and then you get to go into this land and i'm going to read a really long quote here i've trimmed it down but it's just to set the highlights and kind of set what happened before this as brother braham spoke that he says there were three stages of the journey and there's been three stages of this journey for we are justified by faith believing on the lord jesus christ forsaking the land of egypt come out and then are sanctified through the offering of his blood washed from our sins and become pilgrims and sojourners claiming that we are seeking a land a city that's coming or a promise so did israel in the wilderness sojourners no place to rest traveling night after night following the pillar of fire but finally come to the promised land where they settled down that's where the believer comes right he says you're coming to a place where you'll settle down he comes first to a recognition that he's a sinner then he is separated by the waters the washing of waters by the word believing on the lord jesus christ then being justified by faith he becomes a partaker and a peace with god through christ baptized into the name of jesus christ to omit him into this journey he says you get it into the journey so you're only starting a journey when you get baptized right that's not the end that's the start amen he says then he becomes a sojourner and a pilgrim he's on his journey to what a promise that god made israel had not yet received the promise but they were on their journey israel when they come to the spot of kiddish barnea where the spies went over and said the land is great but some of them come back and said we can't take it because the cities are walled up and so forth but joshua and caleb stood out and said we are more than able to take it because of their already signed up documented statements they believed in two works of grace justification and sanctification and could not move any further he says what not joshua and caleb had that he says the people it was documented that they disbelieved they only went part way they were justified they were sanctified but when it came to crossing over jordan they refused it it was documented he says and listen that whole generation perished in the wilderness that's a scary place to be he says you had documented statements that you didn't believe he says and because of that you'll never go in you'll die in the wilderness amen then instead of the people going on receiving the holy spirit speaking with tongues receiving the power of god the baptism of the holy ghost signs wonders miracles they felt it would break down their tradition of doctrines and what happened to it perished in the land that's right now he makes a switch here and he's talking about what what would happen in pentecost you know 2000 or many thousands of years later but he's typing it back to what they were doing he says but the believers the caleb and joshua outfit amen that's where we want to be called right that's the the identification we want is i want to be part of the joshua and caleb outfit amen the ones that believe that said we're more than able to take it the joshua caleb and josh ralph that was going on to the promise they moved on over into the land and took the land and settled down in the land as a possession and we never stop at justification sanctification let's go on to the baptism of the holy spirit let's not stop at believing on the lord jesus and being baptized let's not stop because he cleaned us up from a life of sin how many people have stopped there and said i'm living clean that's what it means to be saved no that's what it means to be sanctified your life is cleaned up but that does not mean you have the life of christ amen the scripture says he gives you a new spirit and brother brahm says he gives you a new spirit so that you'll get along with his spirit when he gives it to you that sanctification is that new spirit that's roaming around inside of you but you've still got to get the holy spirit you've just got to clean up life that means you're ready for service but he's got to put something in you to make you serviceable something that's going to do something for him amen let's not stop because he cleaned us up from a life of sin but now we press on into a position to a promise of the baptism of the holy ghost for people say peter said on the day of pentecost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to them that's far off even as many as the lord our god shall call amen so to step into canaan brother brown says is to step into a promise and step into a position as what an adopted son and daughter of god that's what we're looking for adoption is stepping into your place and your position amen so it's not just that you get the holy spirit but now you're going to be about the father's business and what is the father's business to take possession of what he's given you and to keep it in order and to hold on to it until such time as he calls you home amen but what it's still going to be an individual walk right this is an individual walk they might go in as a group over jordan but when they get in there at some point they have to separate and go their different ways and start taking over their own lands amen but at the same time brother branham points out time and time again what he points to our families and says they're a part of this amen he says what as many as the lord our god shall call so if god's still calling there's still hope amen he's still on the mercy seat could i put it that way amen he's still on the mercy seat as long as the bride is here there's still a chance for somebody to come in amen there's going to be 11th hour workers and though it's funny is that the sixth hour workers and the eighth hour workers say nope nobody can come in after me it can't be that way man the scripture clearly says 11th hour worker there someone's going to come in work the last hour of the day and they'll get the exact same reward as the ones that work the entire day amen our children can still come in amen somebody can still walk in off the street brother weishal and get the baptism of the holy spirit amen it's still available because we have proof that it's still available amen it's still with us it's still in us i still have a daughter that got the holy spirit in the last few years amen so i know that it's still coming and then i know there's still blood on the mercy seat i know that it's still available to those that would have a need of it amen but what is it right before we go in he says there's this last little cleaning up and this is a little that last work of sanctification we'll look at it in the scriptures just as we get a little deeper into this amen what is it you can be all cleaned up but you're still walking in a dirty world amen with jesus what did he say when he was doing communion and foot washing with them in the last supper he says what i just need to clean your feet peter says no no clean every part of me and he says no no you only have need of your feet because what you're walking through a dirty world the rest of you has been sanctified he had sanctified them earlier right in scripture you look at he's already sanctified him but he says no no you just need to clean your feet because you're walking through this world and no matter how good and how moral you are satan's still going to be attacking he's still going to be throwing mud at you and he's going to throw spirits at you he's going to throw thoughts at you he's going to throw ideas at you he's going to tempt you and some of that stuff is going to stick a little bit until you clean it off amen there's got to be a sanctification and when they sanctify themselves there could be no uncleanliness allowed with them and then he says you notice there it says don't go at your wives men there's no intimacy there's no central intimacy allowed for three days everything has to be perfectly clean don't let any dirk get into your life amen if god's moving clean up your life if you're expecting god to move clean up your life amen don't let that be the hindrance don't give satan an opportunity to hold you back but rather clean your life up so that there's no hindrance for god to move when he's wanting to move amen that's what joshua's saying here saying for three days clean up clean up and be ready because god's gonna move on the fourth day amen i would say for us the same thing if you believe god's moving or god's gonna move make sure your life's cleaned up and then make sure that your internet is cleaned up make sure that your apps are cleaned up make sure that your computer's cleaned up make sure that your friends are cleaned up make sure that how you spend your time is cleaned up that you're dedicating your life to christ so that when he wants to move you don't have anything amen nothing brother gerald talking you know about the minister coming up and he's got a he's got a thought on his on his mind and he's got something on his heart to preach but guess what you've got a need there and i've got to be able to surrender myself and brother gerald has to be able to surrender himself to get off of his notes and hit what you're doing but how does that happen we've got to sanctify ourselves amen i can't have a clinger in there i can't have a blockage there from something i did last night or this week that's holding back right that's got to be under the blood and i've got to be clean so that the holy spirit can move through me and touch your need has nothing to do with me i'm just making sure there's nothing there for him to hold him back amen and so it is with us and our families amen i'll look at the men especially and say if you're looking for god in the moving of the spirit in your life and your family make sure you're clean make sure god can use you because when he can use you now he can use that channel of authority to what work on your wife work on your children amen you've got to be cleaned up amen brother braham said this in adoption he says oh jesus was training 12 men that these 12 men was to take the gospel to the world and he said for their sake i sanctify myself sometimes we think it's for us he says no for their sake i sanctify myself make yourself for your neighbor's sake for somebody else's sake don't use your liberty for a cloak said paul but sanctify yourself behave yourself in the neighborhood like a real christian ought to let your communications be if you're you meet your enemy sanctify yourself for his sake not knowing what you might do what you're in a bad attitude you're in a bad place and somebody comes up at you and starts poking at you you're not going to respond with the love of christ if you aren't sanctified right because you're prickly you've got those clingers from the world on there you've got some dirt there and guess what that book you read that movie you saw that clip on youtube whatever it might be is going to be what comes out of your mouth and what's projected through you rather than the holy spirit why you're not cleaned up right sanctify your home and life so that there's nothing satan can use amen render him useless in the millennium remember that brother brahm said satan was bound by what chains of circumstance right he had nobody to work in why because all of the all of the ungodly are dead and all that's there are the believers right what satan has nobody to work in if he's got nobody working then he shouldn't have anybody to work in now when it comes to our life amen we should be as sanctified now as we're going to be over there amen that's what we want to be because our character doesn't change so your character what you're doing here means you wouldn't do it over there either amen amen first john 3 20 says for if our heart condemn us god is greater than our heart and knoweth all things beloved if our heart condemn us not then have we confidence toward god how are you going to pray when you've got something lingering over you and you know that you've done something you shouldn't you've got something in your home something in your life and it's not covered up amen amen how are you going to pray like that what you've got to make that right you've got to make sure that there's no condemnation there because what then in verse 22 it says and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight amen you want to beat satan to the bunch clean up your life because he works with those things satan loves to work in darkness right he loves to work in the shadows and if you've got that little spot of darkness in your life that's where he'll hide and it'll be like a cancer that spreads out from there and he'll go bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger amen sometimes i think if they had the internet on the day of pentecost they never would have got the holy ghost because they would have been what they would have been reading up on the news reading the latest things on did jesus rise did he not what's the latest you know investigation into this right did he really go up how many are there are they looking for us do we need to move from place to place to place to stay ahead of the authorities or the priests or these different things what is it the internet can just suck us in can't it it can pull us in to where all we're focused on is what the world is telling us rather than what the word is telling us amen but what they what did they do they went up and they separated themselves for 10 days with nobody in and nobody out they just stayed there and they cut themselves off from it amen we're so bombarded today by information by entertainment and ideas of the world it's insane i mean you get it just at work just at work and you know you're not doing anything special you're not going out of your way to be worldly but just the things that come across my way whether it's language whether it's jokes whether it's new ideas all of the support for alternative lifestyles it's all in the workplace now and people talk about it constantly and then if you go online it's even worse amen what is it satan's bombarding us and we're lacking that quiet time with god right we're lacking that quiet time where we separate ourselves and say lord this is just for me and you the other day i was driving somewhere and i had a bit of a ways to go and usually i just go in plug in my phone and hit my music and drive but i said no not today i said lord i've got some things i need to talk to you about and for that next 30 minutes or so that's what i did was him and i talked and you know as soon as you give him that time as soon as you give him that time he responds doesn't he listen our kids love to spend time with us don't they if you give your kid time he's not going to waste it right he's not going to say no dad not today no mom not today if you do something with your kids if you show them they're special if you give them your time and attention they thrive under it and then you give your spouse the time that they need what is it they thrive your employees right if you give them time and extra attention they thrive under it how much more do you think god is sitting there wanting to to have us thrive by spending time with him we're not going to him and blessing him we're going to him and he's blessing us we lift up our praises to him we give him glory and honor in these different things but the blessing is truly from him to us and all we have to do is give him that time all we have to do is set aside that time say lord i'm just going to be quiet before you and it's not about quantity it's about quality i'll tell you one sincere and honest prayer before god does a whole lot better than some long-winded prayer where you won't go near the prickly bits of your life the little things that you know are hanging on or the big things you know that are there and you're just there and you're lifting your heads and lord you're so good and you're so great and i love you and he's saying well why don't you just open up your life to me let's have a real conversation sanctify yourself amen amen what did brother brahm say this is all what a process of getting ready to inherit the promise remember what he said don't let your liberty be a cloak for what trip somebody else up amen amen there's so coming out but now we're talking about it going in amen there's a process in there and that's the adoption that brother bannon's been talking about throughout this series and adoption amen joshua 3 6 says and joshua spake unto the priest saying take up the ark of the covenant and pass over before the people i am going to move pretty quickly through a lot of this because we covered it in that one service but we're going to hit it from a bit of a different angle this morning amen and they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people and the lord said unto joshua this day will i begin to magnify thee and the sight of all israel that they may know that as i was with moses so i will be with thee and thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant saying when ye are come to the brink of the water of jordan ye shall stand still in jordan and joshua said unto the children of israel come hither and hear the words of the lord your god and joshua said hereby ye shall know that the living god is among you this is the purpose of why they're crossing this way this day in this place hereby ye shall know that the living god is among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the canaanites the hittites the hivites the parasites the gergescites the amorites and the jebusites amen the miracle they're about to see is to prove that god is opening up a way and because of that he's going to be with them all the way through the conquering of canaan right amen what happens in jordan is to prove that god is with you remember that when we cover jordan in the next service amen what happens in jordan is to prove that god is with you and he will be with you and in you even to the end of the age amen what happens in jordan will solidify your faith in god right you'll never be the same after jordan i can guarantee that behold the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth passeth before over over before you into jordan now therefore take you 12 men out of the tribes of israel out of every tribe amen every tribe we said remember had a firsthand witness of what was about to happen everybody had a first-hand witness there was no excuses after this one but there's not going to be an excuse anyways because everyone's going to go through it but he says i want somebody to witness everybody needs somebody here that's going to be a guaranteed a set of eyes at the front lines here and it shall come to pass as soon as the souls of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the lord the lord of all the earth shall rest in the waters of jordan that the waters of jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above and they shall stand up and heap and then we talked about this before they had to step into the jordan in order for the way to open up amen there's a difference here between the red sea we'll probably cover it next time because we won't have time today amen but they had to trust the word of god and step into the raging water before it would part and it came to pass when the people removed from their tents to pass over jordan and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people and as they that bear the ark were come unto jordan and the feet of the priests that bear the ark were dipped in the brim of the water for jordan overflowed all of his banks all the time of the harvest that the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon a heap very far from the city adam that is behind beside zaraton and those that came down toward the sea of the plane even the salt sea failed and were cut off and the people passed over right against jericho and then so it stood up on a wall on one side and all the water just washed away on the other side so you have a wall here and you have nothing there it says and those men what the people passed over but the first man had to walk into jordan and do it with full confidence that god would keep his word this was not a red sea crossing this was a jordan crossing and they had to go in obedience to the word in faith and step into that water trusting that when they did they would not lose the word they would not lose the ark they would not lose their lives but the waters would roll back amen it was just this is a supernatural event that's happening here but it was especially supernatural for those men because they were the first ones to do it they were the first ones to go with the word and take it and step into that water and trust that god would move it back amen not only that but they have to stand there for hours they didn't just walk in to roll back and they cross to the other side they go in and they stand in the middle they're standing in the breach and they're standing there and they're holding that word on their shoulders for hours while the entire group of children of israel cross over it says and the priests that bear the ark of the covenant of the lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of jordan and all the israelites passed over on dry ground until all the people were passed clean over jordan i mean i love that they stood firm they held fast and then they didn't waver they didn't flinch they didn't slowly inch their way over to the other side they weren't yelling at people go go go it says they just stood firm holding on to the word amen what held it back it wasn't their faith it was the word the word was one that made the promise and then god had given the promise and all they're doing is stand there saying we're holding on to this word and trusting that god will protect his word amen that god will back up his word and if we're in obedience and we're holding on to it then it will hold its place amen their job was not to move once they had gotten there to hold firm until every single person had crossed over amen they put their lives on the line they put their reputations on the line what just to prove god was real to those people amen they had to step forward in faith amen only then would the people cross only when they saw the way it was clear only when they saw the miracle happening would the people cross over amen but those men had to say i'll go first we'll go first and guess what they didn't preach this teach this at preschool this was not an experience that their seminary had taught them amen this was a new movement this was a new change in direction this was a new leadership they had to trust that god was using joshua moses is gone they're under new leadership now and they had to trust that god was with him the exact same way he was with moses amen listen to this brother braham says and whenever you see the ministry preaching the word so plainly you see god coming down and confirming that word what do you wait on why terry preaching is not speaking just speaking it's speaking and living amen those men weren't just talking to talk they were walking to walk weren't they they put their lives where their mouths were amen they took the word and it didn't just live on their mouth now it lived in their lives and their feet started obeying the word and that's what he's talking about when you see the ministry preaching the word so plainly you see god coming down and confirming that word what do you wait on he says why terry then it's time to rise and say yes lord with a firm solid faith my faith looks up to thee i believe you i'll stay with you lord you're the pilot of my ship take me through lord i've come to go through with you no matter what the cost is what the price is what the distance is i'll sail this ship with you will we do that brother brown continues he says and joshua now his word was at stake yes sir just as noah of old but joshua must cross over this river and look like he picked the worst time that could ever be thought but god likes to take those kinds of times to prove that he's god and men of god who believe god and know what god has promised is not afraid to do it because god will stick with his word just as certain as he is god and when he said first take the ark and go forward and when those priests feed touch that jordan no matter how wild she was and how she was swelling it give away to god's eternal word for the word was in the ark god said now heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away and joshua knowing that his word must rest upon god's word and he put god's word first he says i wish you sick people here tonight would do that put god's word with your confession put your confession you believe it and set it out there and call those things which are not as though they were then we're marching on do it that way god's word will take it through and as the priest's feet touched jordan she just rolled back from side to side and the water stayed now catch this he says do you realize the roaring of that river would have brought forth a bank in there in 20 minutes time would have been as big as some of these modern big dams that we've got the colorado boulder dam out there the way that jordan sweeps through there is coming out of the mountains with a great force and she's sweeping through those valleys and when two million footmen with women and children capacity they're probably taking four or five hours or more and what do you think that river would have filled up but god stayed the stream amen oh how i love that he stayed the streams and she laid there until they passed over you imagine those priests sitting there they're standing there they've got the word over their shoulder and the river perhaps started 20 feet deep but every second they stand there all of the volume of the water the mountains is building up in front of them and it's getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger tens of stories just building up up up up up up up in front of them behind them and they're sitting there listening to him probably can't see the sun by the time it's done it's up so high and they're standing in the shadow of certain death as we talked about for four hours they stood there do you think the hair was rising on the back of their neck he opened the way i don't know why they'd think he'd do anything but hold it back amen but still sometimes we're standing in the shadow of something and the hairs on our backs start to get prickly because you're looking at that and you're saying i really hope he holds it back amen but if he made the way he'll hold it amen look at god's timing worst time of the year to cross the river now we'll sit back and say lord you know we're only human we've got young kids i just gave birth to a baby this is not a time for us to cross right he knows we're human but what he's waiting for us to realize is that he's the supernatural god he's not just god but he is a supernatural god and so it's up to him to make the way it's up to us to realize that it's him that's doing it amen that we're trusting in him we're not trusting to the arm of flesh we're not trusting in something that some man told us but we're trusting to the ever unchanging never failing word of god amen amen what's god's way through a raging river today worst time of the year today let's go you've had warning you've seen it build up doesn't matter you have to go across there's no canoes there's no rafts and then there's no running the line across like they did in the old times and then going across and handing over hand none of this right there wasn't a convenient way to cross over they had to go through the jordan that day god's way amen and there's only one way to ever come to the kingdom there's only ever one way to come to the kingdom amen it's acts 2 38 always has been and always will as brother joel said straight is the gate narrows the way and few there be that find it amen straight is the gate narrows the way few there be that find it amen the only access to the promised land was in god's time and that was through a supernatural event amen let me tell you if you believe that you have experienced god that you have god inside of you and you haven't experienced a supernatural event something's wrong it has to be a supernatural event we're talking about a new birth i mean a new birth is supernatural a new birth is supernatural so if we're sitting here and we're saying yeah yeah i did this and i did that and that to that and there was no supernatural something's wrong amen we serve a supernatural god everything he spoke about when it comes to the believer is supernatural right so if we're sitting here with an experience that is not supernatural we've got a problem amen i need to have a new birth i need to have a change in my life i had to to kill jonathan corlett a man so that a new birth could come out amen and that's a supernatural event because nobody kills himself and comes back alive but yet here we sit amen continuing joshua chapter 4 verse 1. it says and it came to pass when all the people were passed clean passed over jordan that the lord spake unto joshua saying take you 12 men out of the people out of every man tribe of man and command ye them saying take your hence out of the midst of jordan the place where the priests feet stood firm 12 stones and you shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where you shall stand this night so those 12 witnesses he says all right go get the stones the priests are saying they're probably saying hurry come on you know stones really we're going to do stones no he says we've got to commemorate this there's got to be an altar builder there's got to be something to commemorate this great miracle that's here and i need 12 men to do it so the priests hold on a second guys we're going to get some stones then joshua called the 12 men whom he had prepared of the children of israel out of every tribe of man and joshua said to them passover before the ark of the lord your god into the midst of jordan and take you up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder according unto the number of the tribes of the children of israel that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean ye by these stones then ye shall answer them that the waters of jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the lord wasn't cut off before the men it was cut off before the word and then the word is what cut it off when it passed over jordan the waters of jordan were cut off and these stones shall be for a memorial under the children of israel forever and the children of israel did so as joshua commanded and took up 12 stones out of the midst of jordan as the lord spake unto joshua according to the number of the tribes of the children of israel and carried over them over with them unto a place where they lodged and laid them down there and joshua set up 12 stones in the midst of jordan in the place where the feet of the priests which bear the ark of the covenant stood and they are there unto this day for the priests which bear the ark stood in the midst of jordan this is these men this is a ministry standing there until everything was finished that the lord commanded joshua to speak unto the people according to all that moses commanded joshua and the people hasted and passed over and it came to pass when all the people were clean passed over that the ark of the lord passed over and the priests in the presence of the people stood there and stood there and stood there and stood there until everyone that was supposed to come in came in amen what did our pastor say this morning what's the ministry there for for the perfecting of the saints until they come into what the unity of faith but brother brahm say the unity of the faith was the rapture amen until it's all done they have to stand in the presence of the people until everyone's in and then they step out and it closes over amen and joshua sorry and the children of reuben and the children of gad and half the tribe of manasseh passed over armed before the children of israel as moses spake unto them about forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the lord unto battle to the plains of jericho on that day the lord magnified joshua in the sight of all israel and they feared him as they fear moses all the days of his life and the lord spake unto joshua saying command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony that they come out of that they come up out of jordan joshua therefore commanded the precinct come ye up out of jordan sometimes it's so simple what'd he say he said joshua say come up out of jordan what did joshua say come up out of jordan he didn't say boys you stood there a long time and god has given me a tremendous message for you today is the day of your deliverance come on out what did he say god said tell them to come up and he said come up he just said what god said he didn't add to it he didn't embellish it he didn't turn it into some big flowery sermon he didn't turn into some big thing about him god said say this and he said it amen we'll see that exact same thing over and over and over again with children of god they say what god says they don't add to it they don't take away from it because what the flowery speech would have added a lot to who joshua right my he's a great speaker such a powerful speaker he is no god said say this and he said it and they did and then what happened amen and it came to pass when the priests that bear the ark of the covenant of the lord will come up out of the midst of jordan and the souls of the priest's feet were lifted up onto the dry land that the waters of jordan returned onto their place and flowed over all his banks as they did before went right back to normal and then it closed behind them there's no going back it was a finished work can we say it that way it was a finished work everyone was in safe and then it closed over and there was no going back for a long time to go back you had to work at it you had to build rafts or wait for the river to go down and that basically meant they were not going back you're not going to cross hundreds of thousands of people over anytime quickly amen what was it from here on out they needed to conquer to eat they needed to conquer to live they needed to conquer in order to have a future when that river closed they had one more night of mana i believe and then that was it they had to eat of the old corn and then from there it was conquering taking over and what they they ate what they conquered amen and the people came up out of jordan on the tenth day of the first month and encamped in gilgal in the east border of jericho and those 12 stones which they took out of jordan did joshua pitch at gilgal and he spake unto the children of israel saying when your children shall ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean these stones then you shall let your children know saying israel came over this jordan on dry land for the lord your god dried up the waters of jordan from before you until you were passed over as the lord your god did to the red sea which he dried up before us until we were gone over it says god that took us out is the god that took us in and then he hasn't changed he hasn't lost his power he hasn't lost his willingness to help his children right he hasn't lost the supernatural effect of his presence it's still here with us is what he was saying that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the lord that it is mighty that ye might fear the lord your god forever amen amen a monument of 12 stones placed there you'll see there's 12 stones in the in the new testament as well amen we'll get to that a little bit later amen let's start talking about our side amen let's turn to ephesians chapter 1 if we would ephesians chapter 1. so we've got to cover two things here we'll do one today and then one on wednesday lord willing so we've got the promised land and then we've got jordan so we need to know what the promised land is and then we've got to know what jordan is and what it means and what that process is because remember brother i'm speaking of a process to get to the promised land so you got to know where you're going but you've got to know what it is you've got to pass through in order to get there because there's no other way of coming in amen it's like the the the man that was at the wedding feast remember he didn't have the garment on he didn't have the wedding garment on and he was kicked out he came another way there has to be god's provided way of coming in amen amen so what's the promised land for us for them it was a physical land called canaan right very clear very easy for them to know amen they were the natural seed of abraham where the spiritual seed of abraham so we can see here in ephesians 1 verse 9. now we covered a bit of this before and again as we read a lot of joshua sometimes over and over we're going to read portions of ephesians over and over because there's so much in it and there's so many different angles and aspects of how it applies amen so ephesians 1 9 says having made note unto us the mystery of his will now how many remembers what the mystery of his will is from that last service we preached on and it's a manifestation of the sons of god the the mystery of his will is that it was what god above us god with us now god in us amen that's the finishing of the mystery that's to happen in this age and revelation 10 right the mystery of god should be finished so having made known unto us the mystery of his will which is the manifestation of the sons of god according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in ourselves it's all him it's nothing of us in that in in the calling in the creating of it in the in the bringing out of it that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ this is the dispensation of the fullness of times for the gentiles this is the last stage amen this is now so he says he's going to gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and earth even in him resurrection and rapture amen amen so the culmination of the mystery of his will is the resurrection the rapture in whom also we have obtained an inheritance that's our promised land right that's the inheritance having predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed after they believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory amen let's break this down a little bit so in verse 13 it says ye heard the word of truth which is the gospel then you trust that what you've heard is the truth then you act you accept offered salvation by faith then you receive confirmation confirmation from god that you did the right thing how the holy spirit right he gives you the holy spirit the holy spirit is your confirmation he says it is what the earnest of your inheritance it's the down payment amen but then he says there's an inheritance coming after that this is not just it but there's something comes after you get the earnest of the inheritance there's an actual inheritance that comes afterwards amen amen and it's tied to what the purpose of god it's tied to the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god and it's happening when the fullness of times we just read it so in the fullness of times is when the inheritance comes here before we go over there to what full redemption he says there's an inheritance that's what bringing us to full redemption right which is what a new body and then after that we're with christ and then we come down and we're here for a millennium and then we get a new heaven and a new earth and that's where we rule and reign with him forever right let's just take another scripture galatians 3. i've got it here you don't have to turn just to lock down so we're talking about the promised land so the promised land is not just the holy spirit but it's a life lived in the holy spirit amen there's a purpose after you get it god doesn't give it to you so you can stand there like a like a tree and just do nothing amen the tree's got to grow galatians 3 verse 13 says christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law be made a curse for us for it is written cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree he took our place that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles through jesus christ now remember what was the blessing of abraham for them naturally it was the land of canaan but he says now here there's a promise for you and it's a promise of abraham and it's for the gentiles it says that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith amen so if we stop right there we see that christ what took the curse on us so that what the took the curse from us took it on himself so that the blessing of abraham might come on the seed of abraham that's why he took it so what's the promise he says it is the promise of the spirit the holy spirit through faith not through natural bloodlines amen this is through spiritual bloodlines this goes back to when we preached on the the seed amen this is what he's talking about now the promise of the spirit through faith was given to abraham he says and it's for the the spiritual seed of abraham not through grapes great not through works amen but by grace through faith amen there's no grapes listen to what brother braham says adoption number one he says now what is the lamb promised to the new testament believer the promise is the holy spirit for it shall come to pass in the last days joel 2 28 that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and upon my handmaids and my maidservants will i pour out of my spirit and they shall prophesy i'll show wonders in the heavens above and in the earth pillars of fire and smoke and vapor and peter said on the day of pentecost after taking his text and preaching repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission to remit to forgive to take away all back trespasses so our promised land is the holy spirit but as i said it's not just the holy spirit but it's a life lived in the holy spirit after you get the holy spirit and then when they crossed over jordan they just didn't stand there they had a work to do they had a purpose they had an inheritance to claim amen so how do you get in there everyone has to go through jordan he says what by one spirit are you baptized into this body amen you've got to be baptized through the holy spirit and then to get into that inheritance you can't be in there without the holy spirit you'll die you'll never make it right because it takes a supernatural god to claim a supernatural inheritance to take a supernatural position so without the holy spirit you cannot take what is listed in the word as your possession you can't do it you can sit there all day long and look at it and you'll take this and you'll take that but the problem is god will give you exactly what you're asking for but it won't have the christian character that's required of the bride of christ and so it will lead you to destruction every time there's people out there that approve the prosperity gospel time and time again it's real guess what you can believe for money and guess what god will give you exactly what you asked for but you ask a miss and then you're asking according to the lust of your own heart and he gives it to you and it leads you to destruction because there's no character with it there's no what does the lord want for me it's what do i want and then you when you start selectively taking these promises and god will honor your faith but it's not going to take you into the promised land you're just selectively taking what you want out of his book amen so first before you go into the promised land before you start taking promises before you start taking possession you've got to have the holy spirit that's the new birth the new birth is not getting down on your knees and saying lord i repent at an altar and then going and getting baptized that's not the new birth the new birth is when you get a new life and the new life is the holy spirit that's acts 2 38 why i keep saying acts 2 38 amen peter told you how do you get in they said man and brethren what what are we supposed to do and he says and peter said to them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost now if you repent and you're baptized and you don't get the holy ghost you're not going to get in there you can't do two you got to go three you got to get the holy ghost you can't just stop at baptism amen i said this but i'll read it first corinthians 12 13 says for by one spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit all of us everyone in the body of christ has the holy spirit they've got to because it's his life within us amen it's his work our meat is to do his work not to do our own amen amen the holy spirit is the earnest and if you don't have the earnest you don't get what's waiting at the end that's the down payment for what's coming so if you don't have the down payment how are you going to get what's at the end you cannot do it it's impossible amen amen let's look at what happened just do a quick reminder here because we want to see the type in in joshua in our own lives amen if we're if we're looking at crossing into the promised land how they did it should be the way we do it and then so the first thing they did was they were told a time and a place to wait and then the promise is coming the promised land is coming but they're told a time and a place jordan three days the israelites were told to sanctify themselves to separate themselves from anything worldly and make sure that they stayed clean separate and keep clean right then god told them to put the word in front of them the ark in front of them and let it lead the way to the river so they put the word first when the ark came to the river the waters parted and were held back until all could cross over then the river closed backed up after they crossed over and a monument was raised to commemorate the event so we should see all of that when we look at the new birth in the new church amen in the new testament church so let's go piece by piece and i'll just push through on on on the screen here so we're looking for a time and a place luke 24 and this is jesus speaking to the disciples and he says then open he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures and said unto them thus it is written and thus it behoove christ to suffer and arise from the dead the third day remember he read that he took the curse and he hung on a tree so that what the promise of abraham could come on us this is jesus explaining that to the disciples now he says but that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at jerusalem so he's given them a place but he hasn't given them a time just yet right so he's told them what they're supposed to do they're supposed to preach repentance and remission of sins in jerusalem so he's told them what they're going to do but they can't do it he says you can't do it yet because the next one says and ye are witnesses of these things so he says you're going to be a part of it but behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high amen place jerusalem time sometime in the near future what does he say wait wait there until you have power to do what i've told you you're going to do you can't jump ahead of the word right you can't presume right what did brother brown say to presume was to venture without authority you can't presume you have it he says wait until you're endued with power you'll know when you get it and when you get power then do these things then we read in acts chapter one it says the former treaties have i made out theophilus of all that jesus both began both to do and teach until the day in which he was taken up after that he through the holy ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen to whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them 40 days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of god he's preparing them let me put it this way he brought them a message of what was going to come up to that point he really hadn't dwelt too much on it it was more about him and what he had to do but now he says look i'm leaving and you've got a purpose and there's a plan and there's things that you've got to do but you've got to get endued with power from on high he gives them a message we had a prophet come and he gives us this huge message that says tremendous things about a bride in power and demonstration of the spirit that's living the very life of christ that is a witness to the entire world but he says you've got to be endued with power on high before you can do this and being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from jerusalem but wait for the promise of the father which saith he ye have heard of me so he says don't leave jerusalem stay there until you get it and don't go anywhere else don't go to bethlehem because that's where the original birth of christ was stay in jerusalem because that's where i've told you to do it so they couldn't go to any other city they couldn't pick a place that was maybe had a nicer climate while they waited maybe less persecution less chance of being found out they had to stay in jerusalem verse 5 says for john truly baptized with water but ye shall be baptized with the holy spirit not many days hence so your time is not many days hence it's not specific but it's there he says stay there until you get it it's not going to be too long when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in jerusalem in all jewish judea and in samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth so he says you're going to spread out from here but this birth has to happen this baptism of the holy spirit has to happen in one place so we've got a time and a place then we're followed after that sanctification and they returned and returned they under jerusalem from the mount called all of it which was from jerusalem a sabbath state journey and when they were come in they went up into an upper room they went up there and they stayed there they were separated from the world amen it was a group of believers and believers only in that room 120 believers sitting there in what obedience to the word amen and thereabold peter and james and john and andrew philip and thomas bartholomew matthew james the son of alphaeus and simon zelodes and judas the brother of james these all continue with one accord in prayer and supplication with the women and mary the mother of jesus and with his brethren so they weren't in there playing games you know some some light scrabble what were they doing prayer and supplication they were calling on god and waiting for him to answer what he had promised through his word amen and when the day of pentecost was fully come they were all with one accord and in one place now what's the next thing that's supposed to happen the word is supposed to lead the way right you go to a place you've got a time you sanctify yourself and then you're supposed to put the word first now we say they did put the word first but i want to make a another correction another correction when we talked about them replacing uh judas remember with matthias now i said they were filled with the spirit i need to read my bible in chronological order sometimes amen that happened in acts 1 before the holy spirit fell right while they were in the upper room but before the holy spirit came in there peter decides to use this time to make some changes amen the holy spirit hasn't been given yet peter's up there and he says look we need another one we lost one we need to add one to it and so they they drew lots and mathias was the one that was chosen but what happened the word didn't lead them we see what happens when the word doesn't lead is they picked a man that god didn't pick if they would have waited until after that the holy spirit would have checked them and said don't you do it i've got a man picked out for this job but we see what happens they did obey the word they stayed there till they were due with power but i just want you to catch what happens when you don't lead with the word and you presume and you step out peter's saying hey we're the disciples we're the chosen one he says chosen ones he said we're going to do this and we're going to do that so let's do something and he wasn't in the will of god and neither were the rest of them and they all went along with it why they didn't have the holy spirit leading and guiding them because we'll see later that peter he's fully led by the holy spirit right and he moves and he speaks and he goes here and he does this and he goes that but they choose outside of it what is it the word has to go first the word always has to go first you have to you can't presume you've got to be standing clearly on the word of god amen but they stayed there and they tarried and that's what god took that's what jesus had told them to do he said terry till you're in dude with power on high acts 2 verse 2 says and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the holy ghost and they began and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance other tongues means other languages not unknown languages as in that nobody understood but it says with other languages amen now this is supernatural in and of itself because they don't know any other languages they're galileans and you know very rough in general nature you know these are not educated men at all and so for them to speak with another language is something different but this isn't just emotion i mean this isn't you know a laughing revival or some expression of something within them this is this is a first time event amen and it's a supernatural event and that's what we're looking for because that's what happened is after the word goes forward what happens a supernatural event so they're filled with the holy spirit that's supernatural and then the effect of the supernatural is in their lives and all of a sudden they start speaking in tongues which is a different thing than the gift of tongues brother brandon preached hard against the the speaking in tongues as the initial evidence why because what the pentecostals were doing was not what happened on the day of pentecost we'll dig into that a little bit and then watch the effect of these tongues it says and they were dwelling at jerusalem jews devout men out of every nation under heaven and when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and weren't confounded because that every man heard them speak in his own language now remember in verse 4 it says they spoke with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance says they spoke in other languages as the spirit gave them utterance and now these men come there and they say hey i'm hearing them in my language and you're hearing them in your language and you're hearing them in your language what's going on and they were all amazed and marveled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galileans and how here we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born parthians and medes and elamites and the dwellers in mesopotamia and judea and cappadocia and pontus in asia phrygia and pamphilia and in egypt and in the parts of libya about cyrene and strangers of rome jews and proselytes cretes and arabians we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of god and they were all amazed and were in doubt saying one to another what's mean this what means this now i'm not going to say this is the the evidence of the holy spirit because it's not but it is an evidence that's way different than speaking in tongues because watch what happens is that it's not speaking in an unknown language to others it's speaking in a language that you yourself do not know and understand and when you do it it's unintelligible to you but it makes perfect sense to the person staying next to you that knows that language remember brother brown there was in one of his services where somebody stood up and they prophesied in french i believe right that was the holy spirit because they didn't know french that person that spoke did not know fringe and there was i believe a translator from the u.n there and he he he checked the translation the interpretation that was given and he says it was perfect that was the holy spirit this is not just speaking in unintellig you know something completely unintelligible that's what paul had a problem with he says a stranger comes in you're all and nobody knows what's going on until you give an interpretation this was not needed here there was no interpreter needed when the holy spirit dropped the first time amen every person around heard what they were speaking in their own language so they're speaking and everyone understands not just one person everyone i counted i think 15 different countries or cities or tongues listed there and every single one of them understood what was being said but here's the second thing it was not just gibberish it was not just highly repetitive this or that the other thing it had a purpose and what was it it said the wonderful works of god is what they were talking about they were saying this is what's happening right here right now and they were praising the lord about what had just happened to them and the experience they were happy they were having they were sharing it with everyone about them and saying something's going on here and they were telling about what it was and they were saying this is jesus told us about this and this is what he did and this is who he was and peter continues on and on and on until they save 3000 people right what is it when the holy spirit drops down it touches every heart it touches every life that's there to listen amen you don't need an interpreter in that sense right it comes down and it opens up the ears it unlocks each one of you so you can you can get what you need out of the word amen it was a supernatural confirmation that god was with them and nobody there i guarantee you those galileans knew i don't know you know phrygian you know no they don't know anything but yet everybody's understanding there's a there's a you talk about unity you talk about world peace when that dropped down everybody understood what was happening as in they understood the words they understand the what they were talking about amen and 3 000 people repented and got baptized that day one day with peter peter not exactly known for his great speaking ability you know for his tact he said you guys killed the prince of glory you know he just piled it on them three thousand people three thousand people came to the church that day amen what was it wow how the holy spirit speaking to them in a language they could understand peter speaks and everybody understands you tell me how peter isn't going through 15 translators he's speaking and everybody understands and everybody accepts it amen that hears it amen that's the supernatural event not just the coming down but what a way for others to go through you had a group that went ahead that obeyed the word and then they stood there and everybody else passed through and then the scripture says he added under the church daily such as such as were ordained i guess but then after the everybody's across what happens the waters cross behind amen it says and they that gladly received the word were baptized and the same day they were added unto them about three thousand souls and they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers and fear came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles and all that believe were together and had all things coming remember we talked about the 12 stones you've got 11 right there there's a 12th one coming amen what a commemoration god's still with us he didn't just do it once he's doing it again and again and again in me and you and me and you and you and you and you and you and you what showing them reality of a living god amongst them and they sold their possessions and goods imparted them to all men as every man had need they're going into a promised land well they do everybody's got a portion you need some of what i've got i'll give it to you what is it everybody's needs are going to be met over there we're not going to have one that has everything and one that has nothing and then everybody's going to have what they need in the promised land and they continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house to eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart praising god and having favor with all the people and the lord added to the church daily such that should be saved what happened they were dead to their old way of living it says they sold everything pulled their money pooled their resources and they just went from place to place to place each one hosting they get together and they fellowship and pray and they'd be in the temple and they'd be teaching what was it it was a new way of life a new way of provision remember the man is gone now now there's another way of living amen and it's with a body united under the word moving forward into full possession amen let's stand together if we would next we're going to talk about jordan and that's it's it's huge i i it's huge there's so many things that brother branham points to when it comes to crossing over jordan and we've only been about an hour but we'd be another hour an hour and a half if we tried to do jordan today so we're not gonna do that amen amen let's just bow our heads together if we would heavenly father lord we're thankful that you've made a way amen lord not of our own making not of our own choosing
