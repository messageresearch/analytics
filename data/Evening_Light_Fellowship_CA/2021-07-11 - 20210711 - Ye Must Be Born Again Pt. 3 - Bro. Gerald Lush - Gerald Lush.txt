that maybe the next time be a crown amen in your heart in your soul in your life amen so i pray we're going to give the king of kings and lord of lords the preeminence amen i tell you those going in the rapture those who have given him the preeminence in their everyday living amen so you're not living for religion you're not living for this church you're living for jesus praise the name of the lord and you still there's too many that are that are living for doctrines and living for living for creeds but how many are living for jesus amen and even how many believers around the world and as i said they said maybe there's two million or more believers as as we believe but how many are really living for jesus they're it's unfortunate but some are only living for william branham that's the truth they're talking about william branham william branham william branham but i mean he's living for jesus amen and again that we know as that brother did and that brother's gone on somewhere but when he put that note in brother brown's pocket and and he said and brother brown of course before he went to the pulpit he read it oh and he said jesus william branham is my lord oh yeah that's what he said and brother brown went to the pulpit and he highlighted it he said listen he said don't you ever get into this he said that that will make he said that will make me antichrist amen and he said you keep preaching this and you keep saying this he said i'll get out of the ministry amen amen so brother is taking our stand for the word the whole truth nothing but the truth and again brother i pray the grace of god help us the prophet warned us in the in the going forth of the word and now he said leave it the way that it is amen and he said don't add to it and don't take away from it amen why because brother brother god god ordained it from the beginning you know that you don't add to the word don't take from the word just pray the grace of god be with you amen so that amen so that the word is made flesh in us praise the name of the lord but and if the word is flesh in you you're gonna you're gonna give the glory to jesus you're giving the glory to god amen you're gonna point souls to to calvary you're going to point souls through the word of god amen concerning what e it wasn't william brown did it it was jesus praise and brother brown did say always said that's your problem he said he said you can't see the other angel amen that's what he said why because they saw the angel of the prophecy and what god was doing in the last days and revealing his word and calling out his elect amen but he said you don't see the other angel that's that he was revealing amen and even when he went to the pulpit and he did these signs and these wonders he was discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart amen now i said i want you to know he said i can't do this he said i got to get out of the way so he can do it that's right amen brother and it's the same thing with the resurrection the rapture let's get out of the way so he can do it praise the lord we're not getting just to a theology into a doctrine to a creed no no we're getting into the reality of what god has done and what god is doing amen and what god will do amen so he he started here and went on down through the oh my six thousand years he's been working on on the his plan and his purpose and his pattern amen and remember he's the same yesterday today and forever amen god doesn't change his plan hasn't changed his pattern hasn't changed what he does and how he does it doesn't what whatever he did back there he did he did to the to the jews and what he how he did reveal himself to the jews he revealed himself to the to the gentiles amen and of course then he's going back to the jews by the grace of god and we're living in that hour we're living in that time when that's what exactly what's going on brother we ought to see it brother and i pray i trust that the father keep us on our toes amen well look look what god has done look what god is doing so oh lord according to what the bible says you're going to leave the gentiles now and go back to the jews and brother that's what he's doing amen by the grace of almighty god amen i believe it i know it amen and by the grace of god having visited israel amen as a result of our brother george's kindness to us in giving myself and sister betty a free trip amen to israel with with his tour amen so we thank the lord for that but brother again and it's the truth the prophet god did tell him he said if you ever go to if you ever go to israel he said the bible will never be the same a son it will be more real to you amen when you go there and see what god has done and what god is doing amen jew and gentile amen praise the lord shall i trust by the grace of god brother that that it's a blessing to us it's not just go to see this and go to see that amen let's go there with with the anointing to go there with the power of god the revelation of god of what brother what god did in israel and what god is doing in israel praise the name of the lord so i pray the grace of god lord help us to be on our guard and elvis to be amen instant in season out of season ready for the resurrection ready for the rapture amen that's what we're going to look for hunger for and thirst for and as i've said a number of times as martin luther and wesley and and and the others they hungered they thirsted for more of god and they wanted to know god you know and they wanted to know well what what can i do to get into a greater relationship with god amen and and again was the holy ghost that god sent ahead to create in them that hunger and that thirst amen amen and he responded to the hunger and the thirst amen and he gave them justification and he gave them sanctification he gave them the gifts of the spirit the baptism of the holy ghost amen and now he's given us the the faith of the resurrection and the rapture amen and anything that the bride ought to be focusing on as they focused on what god gave them then brother well we ought to be focusing on what god has given us amen what god has done in the in our age amen so we're not looking back we're looking forward amen and at the same time believing oh lord praise the lord we're experiencing the resurrection we're experiencing the rapture by the grace of god amen so we are amen as we stay with the lord stay with the word we're being cut away more and more from the world and we're being cut away from what's going on in the world amen and we're being caught up more and more with the word amen with the word for this hour for this age amen just saying and he's given us the faith he gave luther the faith for justifications another sanctification the baptism amen of the holy ghost but now he's given us the faith of the resurrection and rapture amen because he did this he did this he did this and according to the word the next thing in order is the resurrection next thing in order is the rapture god help us to have that faith to believe god amen so brother we recognize what is going on in the world amen i trust we recognize what's going on in our lives we see god working out there but the devil's also out there amen because he has come down with great wrath and we see it around the world great wrath knowing knowing his time is short amen his actions are dependent on what he knows amen what he sees god doing the word that he sees being fulfilled what are your actions reflecting amen again luther went forth and reflected what god did and the others and the pentecostals went around the world reflecting what god did but what about the bride amen brother they they preached and preached and preached the baptism and the gifts of the spirit and brother the bride ought to be preaching the resurrection and the rapture amen and it's going on right now amen the climax is the bride being caught up into another dimension amen with the saints that have gone on by the grace of god praise the lord and again as the scriptures say there that the dead in christ shall rise first and then we which are alone remain amen shall be cut up together with them praise the lord so i pray the grace of god to lord that we're not going to lose that faith amen brother i tell you if if it's what god is doing whatever what god is doing is there's somebody for me somebody on the earth believing it gonna be somebody on the earth recognizing it somebody on the earth is claiming the promise of god amen because of what god did amen this is what we're doing it influences us by the grace of god help us move on lord by your grace amen god bless you and again as the prophet of god did say just a short time after he preached a message on the token yeah the token 1963 and he said now listen he said i just trust that every one of you would be filled with the holy ghost amen lord and we're looking for the for the word in us they're working for the word to be made flesh in the bright praise the lord by the grace of god and brother pentecost was just looking for gifts and speaking in tongues and so on but what are we looking for do the luther look for justification what are you looking for amen brother we've gone beyond it to the extent that we've matured and we know in our experience with jesus in our experience with god that we are justified amen you're justified i'm justified amen through jesus sanctified filled with the holy ghost have access to the gifts amen but now we've got to move on now there's something else that god's requiring of you and me amen they focused on that they thought about it morning noon and night as i said luther and wesley they preached you know four or five times a day you know what god had given them it was so real to them morning noon and night that's right they didn't focus on this focus on that they focused on what god did and what god was doing and brother and the pentecostals focused on what god did and what god was doing i was part of that oh yeah because i can look back for over 50 years after that when i come to the to through the message that god has done in this hour by william branham amen and i was i was in pentecost brother i was just a young young boy a young teenager amen when i attended the old pentecostal church on casey street amen then i went into the the new one that they had there and uh well it's used for something else now amen i was there oh my sometimes there was 1500 in in the church worshiping god amen oh yes there's such a wonderful anointing there and i remember going down into the into the basement with other young people like myself and i all praise the lord i can see it now amen and we're walking up and down the aisle in the basement because that's where they used to have their their son their sunday schools and so on but during the service that i don't want on a sunday night amen or even a sunday morning to get into the spirit and we're worshiping we're praising god and i was down there with with a lot of a lot of the other young people and we're walking around praising the lord walking around praising the lord hallelujah others were up in in in the main auditorium and they were praising the lord praising the lord oh yeah it was near it was in the all praise the lord it was in the after service amen when after the sermon would have gone forth and oh yeah and the altar call was made and oh yeah the anointing came down the anointing was on this one on that one amen a brother in the anointing was on young and old by the grace of god oh yeah praise god i pray god that the anointing is on us young and old praise the name of the lord we recognize our responsibility amen and that our young people recognize what god's requiring of them amen what god is looking for in them brother god is one he's working in us and god is working in our young people praise the lord that's why they're here trusting god believing god amen and again let's understand god's waiting on us and that includes them amen that includes the young praise the name of the lord to get into the faith of the resurrection to get into the faith of the rapture and to really believe that's what's going on amen not just thoughts in our head but it's a revelation in our heart that controls us amen and we're constantly there to fellowship with jesus we don't want to lose fellowship with him we don't want to get away from the word we want it more and more and more grace amen that brother that the resurrection is in you grace said the rapture is in you jesus said amen when he before he raised lazarus up he said i am the resurrection amen not i will be he said i am that's right amen do we have the present tense amen of who we are amen or not what i was not what i will be what i am that's right amen because the revelation what i am is taking me on amen and brother by the grace of god if we have the anointing of the holy ghost amen that that anointing is going to stay with the word amen that god has ordained for us praise the name of the lord hallelujah let's stand amen amen i preached amen maybe we'll preach again so the lord bless

believe [Music] me [Music] amen i believe praise the lord hallelujah god bless you amen turn with me in your bibles to first corinthians let's see this is certain first corinthians chapter 2 no sorry we will get to that matthew yeah matthew chapter 26 right near the end of the book of matthew chapter 26. and again to remind you where the prophet of god preached 1963 it was in shreveport and when he preached this message right here entitled just once more lord he said now he said i just trust that every one of you would be filled with the holy ghost he said everyone and he said don't forget my message on the token he said you must stay with that message amen and as you remember he said display the token amen in your life by the grace of god amen bro that's truly absolutely what god requires in these last days what god required in luther's day he manifested it wesley they manifested it and the pentecostals brother what god required then they manifested an everyday living amen and i trust by the grace of god that we're into the word into the message and we're manifesting it in everyday living amen you're going out and the life you live is controlled and governed by the word of god amen so it's not you it's jesus in you i don't care if it's if you know it's because there's some brethren there with their own business and and they're doing this doing that brother yeah you're gonna have god in that amen you want god's leadership in your business amen lord i'm doing this for your glory i'll give you the honor and the praise amen for your blessings see that is your personal relationship with jesus and you've got a personal relationship with jesus if you're truly born again amen brother by the grace of god he's in control amen oh yeah no matter okay i don't care what you do in your life jesus is there amen you don't do anything without consulting the lord by the grace of god amen because you need his help in your job you need his help no in your home you need his help amen with your children amen by the grace of god oh yeah you don't leave him out you don't you don't forget him but in all things you acknowledge him and say lord i need you amen grace grace grace amen brother as i said whether whether it's the our young people sometimes going to school are you going to universally amen jesus is there with you oh yeah even even in school because when i was just a teenager in school and uh and they and they would they noticed it they said oh oh i said yeah it's the word yes they said we know that they say because that's the way you live that's the way you act that's the way you talk oh yeah and uh and as i said when i was in a bible class there i would hardly have anything to say because i didn't want to take anybody else's uh place and and the brother that was doing the the bible class he would read this read that and then he would then he would offer some questions and i remember one time we were in there and i i was late getting there and when i walked in i was late and the teacher said oh he said mr lush he said you're late he said i hope you're late for the judgment i said maybe i said we'll see he said well lord bless your brother so he recognized my faith although they they were of a certain church you know that that preached certain certain things and were totally separated and even now they're separated as where from from denominationalism because of what they believe and the way they take their stand and so on but that teacher also said he said we welcome you and so he got in and he began to teach this and teach this the bible there's the bible that oh he said now i got a question he said what church age are we in because he was id he was dealing with revelation and he said what church age are we in and he said nobody know come on he said raise your hand if you got an answer and he went on and i i wouldn't say it because i was waiting just to see i didn't want to take anybody else's position and so finally he said okay i'll ask you again what church age are we in and i raised my hand and oh okay said mr lush i know he said you tell us and so i told him he said exactly you're right he says the loudest see an age amen and you can go to go through revelation 2 and 3 there and the church ages and i pray god amen give you the revelation that we need in this hour the revelation brother sister why we're here oh yeah why because we believe we're in the last church age the seventh church age amen and in that age god was put out of the church jesus was put out of the church they had doctrines and crates but they didn't want jesus the living word for their hour amen but brother we did so we were we were put out of the church amen he was put out we and he's calling us he's talking to us he said come on he said i opened the door and he said i'll come in and stop with you and you with me not the church so i pray grace we have that personal relationship with jesus amen because i believe there's even so-called message churches of all all after all these years brother they have the same spirit and attitude but i pray grace that we're fellowshipping with jesus amen and he is fellowshipping with us he's not fellowshipping with him out there but with his bride grace to us amen so in in the book of matthew 26 and let's begin to read let's see verse 17 now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus saying unto him wherewith thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover and he said go into the city to such a man and say to him the master saith my time is at hand i will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples amen as we have come and associated together to partake of the emblems of his shed blood and his broken body amen i pray grace to be with us and the disciples did as jesus appointed them and they made ready the passover amen now when the even was come he sat down with the twelve it was the evening time and we are in the evening time and as they did eat he said verily i say unto you that one of you shall betray me amazing and they were exceeding sorrowful and began every one of them to say unto him lord is it i and he answered and said he that dippeth is and with me in the dish the same shall betray me the son of man goeth as it is written of him but woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed don't betray god in the word please amen because again the prophet warned us that there are judaistarian pretended brothers around the message he asked what he called him so be on your guard amen please love him serve him give your life to him give him control amen give him the preeminence you're not living for yourself you're living for him by the grace of god amen and he said the son of man goeth as it is written of him but woe unto that man by whom the son of man is betrayed it had been good for that man if he had been not been born and then judas which betrayed him answered and said master is it i amazing and he said unto him thou hast said and as they were eating jesus took bread and blessed it and break it and gave it to the disciples and said take eat this is my body amen and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins but i say unto you i will not drink its forth of this fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it new with you in my father's kingdom amen and when they had sung in him they went out onto the mount of olives where jesus prayed not my will father thine be done god bless his word you may be seated so we have gathered to partake of the emblems of his shed blood and his broken body amen it's been a long time since we had had communion since the covet 19 issue has been going on and uh we off we al also of course with the communion that we want to partake in jesus construct instructions regarding foot foot washing amen because he give us that example he's i've done unto you what i want you to do to one another amen and i know that most churches today they've ignored it and a lot of churches today denominational they don't want anything to do with foot washing because they feel that we don't have to do that well if jesus did it to his disciples surely we can do it to one another amen and thank god for the for the honor amen knowing that you're going to honor one another amen you're going to give give the the the blessings and right because you pray for one another you're praying god to bless that brother to bless that sister amen as the sisters will eventually go out here amen to take up the foot washing after we do the communion but also to remind you that uh in the communion that we are going to use the the little cups and ordinarily we use that that glass there and again as i've said let me say it again to those that have not heard it nor know it is that the this glass that i have here i received from uh brother george smith and brother branham's daughter rebecca had the time as before god took us to rebecca home and so they highlighted to me that the problem of god showed them these glasses and told them that he said this is like the one that jesus used only the one that jesus used of course was metal but he said this is what it look would look like he said it like this one and of course in the bradham tabernacle i assume that they kept they kept using that that kind of a glass and of course our brother george rebecca went out and purchased a number of them and they had them in their office and and they explained to me those things and then offered to send me a glass if i wanted one so they sent it and now ordinarily we would take that but because of the issues that are going on we'll take the use the small glasses and give it give a little glass of wine to each individual by the grace of god after by the grace of god after we have taken partake in all the unleavened bread and we thank our sister brenda in uh she she i used to do it for a number of years i would make the unleavened bread but now for the last few years i guess our sister brenda's been doing it for us so i pray that god will bless it for you and me amen but we'll go in and partake of the communion with a revelation with an understanding of what we are remembering he told us to do it in remembrance of him by the grace of god it's not do this not do that but it's this this is going to remind us of jesus this is going to remind us of what he did in that he laid down his life amen he shed his blood by the grace of god oh praise the lord this is absolutely amazing when we consider what he did when he did it where he did it amen and yet he knew and why did jesus feel so desperate the way that he did when he prayed and prayed and cried and cried and cried well it was because brother it wasn't just going out and doing it like like the like the thieves on the other crosses oh yeah they were there they were going to die and of course because they were still alive when the soldiers went there they went and they they drove a short into them oh no they broke their legs when it comes to this the soldiers they went and broke their legs amen why well they've been hanging on the cross hanging on the cross they were still alive so they broke their legs so that they would they would they would lose that that strength to keep themselves up on the cross because their feet was there under and oh yeah so they just maintain the pressure there and keep them up so they go keep breathing and so on but when they broke their legs their bodies sunk down and they couldn't couldn't keep up the body and what else they they couldn't breathe and finally they died that's right and they went and checked them they said he's dead he's dead and they went to jesus and they said oh he's gone but they didn't break his leg and that's why amen amen brother god got a plan god had a purpose god had a pattern amen and jesus was dead but they didn't break his legs why because he they didn't kill him he laid down his life amen he did it he chose it amen and he gave up the ghost amen they didn't take it from him he gave it up it's all see right on through his ministry right on through the the the how they treated him and everything amen brother it was jesus that endured it endured it endured it amen and when it comes to laying down his life no no they weren't going to take it no no he had to lay it down of himself because he did it to redeem us amen praise the name of the lord so he laid he gave up the ghost oh it wasn't like the the those that were on the other crosses no no no they said oh we got to kill them but jesus is funny how come he's dead amen he laid down his life he gave up the ghost amen oh yeah now they're going to do what needed to be done amen brother the crowning of his ministry the crowning of what he was ordained to do and what he wanted to do in redeeming you and me and brother it was the shedding of blood amen we won't get into that with the shedding of blood in the garden of eden that put us in sin it was a shedding of blood at calvary that took us out but it was his perfect blood amen that jesus laid down his life oh yeah and at the time there was no again where's his blood still in his body amen but when when those soldiers came they said he's dead and they took the sword or the spear that they had and they drove it in his side yeah and the blood came out amen all down to the cross all down on on the earth and into the earth amen to redeem us it was perfect sinless blood amen by the grace of god that's why jesus was born the way he was by the spoken word amen into the into the womb of mary oh no so it wasn't it wasn't mary's husband it wasn't a human being no no it was spoken word of god amen and she brought forth the son jesus he was born without sin amen there was what we weren't no no we weren't brother so he came to shed his blood to redeem us by grace to god be the glory amen so we in in the communion service we partake amen by wine representing his body representing his blood we partake of that wine and remembering calvary and say thank you jesus for what you did for me thank you jesus that you laid down your life for me amen but you picked it up again and shares it with me praise the lord hallelujah because he knew we needed redemption but he knew that we need we needed resurrection amen we needed his resurrection we needed his power we needed his anointing without him we can do nothing amen and surely brother if we can't do anything well what about the resurrection we need christ in us the hope of glory amen so brother on the day of pentecost he came back to dwell in us praise the lord brother he took oh praise the lord and he too what did he do brother he ascended up he took that body off the amen that he laid down his life in amen did he did he suffer for us in the the blood of that body he shed and he took it up and he laid it before the throne oh yeah he laid it before he put it before the throne yeah what as a testimony redemption is done it's paid for the price has paid amen and the life of that body came back on the day of pentecost amen he said i'll not leave you comfortless i will come to you amen hallelujah and he came to us in the form of the holy ghost it was god with us god in us amen by the grace of god i trust that you have amen grace that we have the evidence we have the token we have the faith that is christ in me the hope of glory not you that lives christ is living in me christ is leading me christ is controlling me amen christ has given me the decisions that i need made in my life give me the strength to do this the leadership to do that amen say again not my will thine be done the grace of god be with us brother amen as we eventually go in to partake of the emblems of his shed blood and of his broken body amen and the foot washing brother it's in evidence again token as it were of his life in us and lord as he humbled himself to peter we're humbling ourselves to one another that's right and yeah as i said he had more problems with peter than he had with judas when it come when it comes to questioning him doing this doing that don't do this don't do that because peter was right there to tell him oh stay away from jerusalem don't do this don't do that and what are you doing this world what are you doing that for yeah but according to scripture there's no other disciple question him so much as peter amen that's right but yet he was he was he was chosen of god to be there on the day of pentecost amen so it's not it's not the one that you choose not the one that this one choose that which is what god is the one god chooses amen praise the lord because maybe we would have went out and chose judas you know maybe we go and choose this one choose that one no no who did god choose amen so the grace of god that we have the leadership of the holy ghost amen but we know that the devil has come down with great wrath knowing his time is short and the devil brother as he was then so you in the garden of eden oh yeah yeah like i said he only only changed one word of what god has said he quoted what god has said and again understand he was he was the first evangelist you know in the garden of eden how he went preaching to it to eve when he found her out there looking at the trees of life and so on this and that something else amen and he said yea god said amazing first thing the devil does is quote the word amen and the devil quoted that word to do eve but he changed and he added one more but thou shalt not surely god said thou shalt surely die he said thou shalt not surely die yeah before he said and he and he tried to to get him to doubt god to doubt the word of god amen to question god oh yeah and she believed the devil instead of staying with god oh yeah well it was satan using the serpent amen so the serpent was satan through the serpent was deceiving her so the grace of god that we believe god that we're going to stay with the word amen we're going to make our calling election sure by the grace of god amen brother that's what we we we need now that's why they've needed all down through the ages and through the years is the grace of god amen why the grace of god for the grace of god to provide what we have need of it is by grace we're saved no it is by grace through faith are we saved and say faith is the revelation of the will of god for the age in which we live if you walk in the light even as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleansed us from all unrighteousness amen but you've got to walk in the light amen it didn't it didn't give us the redemption and then oh well walk in the light if you see this if you see that amen brother amen no no you've got to walk in the light walk in the light and as you're walking in the light amen what's he doing he's looking for your faith amen he'll recognize your faith praise the lord and if you're your faith is real and you believe god and you believe in the finished work of calvary oh you're redeemed amen amen and again praise the lord if we're redeemed praise the lord if we have experienced redemption then brother we have true fellowship with one another not just with god but the testimony of your faith with god your fellowship with god is in your fellowship with one another amen you love him well if you but again if you love him you're going to love one another amen as jesus said again as i preached there a few weeks ago whenever it was well it says you're going to hell i said not because of what you did and we condemn people for what they did but jesus says you're going to go to hell because of what you didn't do amen praise the lord why he said in matthew 24 there i believe and he said lord he said you do this you do this he said in as much as you didn't do it to the least of these my brethren you did it not to me and he pointed them to hell they were lost amen so brother we better be on our guard i'll tell you amen whatever's in your heart god sees yes oh yeah the i i thought about it as the lord uh you're judging this one this one this one and i said oh but lord what about if they if they had a nice attitude and nice spirit and so on yes he said i know the heart he's not oh he goes beyond what you're doing contrary to his will amen oh yeah and he'll go into the heart to see why you did this and why you did that amen i tell you anybody with a right spirit right attitude god's not going to condemn them god's not going to kill them see again it's like william branham was condemning this one condemning that one until the angels came down said mother branham don't you condemn her he said some of them are my children and they're condemning this one because oh that woman she was in slacks or she was wearing this you maybe shed a haircut he says some of them are my children amen and as i said first when i come to the message so many believers brother we're looking down their noses oh they condemn this one condemn that one they're going to this church go to that church go to this denomination that denomination i said lord i said their spirit is not right because there goes them but for the grace of god amen so brother keep your attitude right your spirit right don't compromise with them but keep your attitude right toward them and pray for them amen shall the grace of god brother be with us that we're going to have the anointing of the life of christ in us amen the attitude that justly sanctified wesley rather and and then give the gifts and the anointing to the pentecostals amen but brother that anointing is increasing increasing increasing and now it's giving us resurrection and rapturing faith to the bride oh my this is tremendous god did that god did this god did that god did that down through the ages now what's he doing what's he doing now oh well brother if we don't recognize the resurrection rapture we should we will go back to pentecost oh yeah i say all your pentecost lord thank you for the gifts lord thank you for the anointing of the holy ghost amen yeah but the prophet as far as the word is concerned that's to take you on to the resurrection take you on to the rapture amen and the problem god said it's unfortunate he said pentecost failed to recognize its message amen pentecost has failed to recognize the capstone of what god did during the pentecost revival and the capstone is the resurrection rapture amen the capstone is being caught away to be with the lord in glory at the marriage supper of the lamb amen god help us amen and brother he did what he was ordained to do to give us access to the word to give us access to eternity by the grace of god praise the lord that we we can go now we can do what they couldn't do in previous previous ages or especially the jews oh they wanted this wanted that but no christ had to come first lay down his life take the body up bring come back in the life of the holy ghost and share that eternal life with you praise the lord amen and brother and bring us on and on and on to eternity until we're going to step into a glorified body and he's going to go up and get into that body called jesus amen and he's going to come down and receive us unto himself praise the lord amen but he's here now amen sharing eternal life with us praise the lord so we're longing and looking for that hour brother yeah where's jesus well he's maybe he's gone off to get to get into that but into that body again but then he'll come back hallelujah and we which are our lives so on we're going to be changed caught up look oh there's jesus he's coming down we're going home amen the anointing hallelujah that was in that body is what's taking us up and that's why he go back he goes back into that body come down to welcome us praise the lord hallelujah what do you want to do well william branham said one time he said i want to introduce you to him he said yes in glory and he said if there's any and if there's anything that he wanted to do he said oh after after i've done this he said i want to i want to get down on my knees and i'll crawl up to him he said to touch his feet and to thank him for what he did oh god help us amen god help us indeed the grace of god be with us and there was a number of things that i wanted to share with you but we don't really have that time and concerning the fruit of the spirit and the works of the flesh amen the bible highlights both let's see what's got more and more we'll see later what has got more and more control in our lives is it are we going forward to in the holy ghost manifesting the fruit of the spirit okay let's challenge the lord willing will he will challenge us this is the fruit of the spirit so do you have this fruit in your life yeah or are we more sensitive to the to the works of the flesh more controlled by the works of the flesh grace brother by the grace of god and when it comes to the works of the flesh the bible goes on with 17 works that that are in the flesh that the enemy is working on to control us yeah but when it comes to the fruit of the spirit there's just a very few and the bible in one place highlights nine fruits of the spirit so let's see we'll we'll consider that later and and i'm going to challenge you to read it i'm going to challenge you to look at it i'm going to challenge you to study it and say do i have the fruit of the spirit amen or am i more subject to the works of the flesh amen because the bible does highlight the works of the flesh and tell us what it is and the bible highlights the fruit of the spirit so if you want to know what anointing is in control of your life go to the word and amen and judge yourself am i bringing forth the fruit of the spirit or am i still bringing forth the works of the flesh what's controlling me grace oh yeah i'll tell you this oh well i'm born again i'm a christian and so on yeah but even as a christian there's there's certain things when it comes to the flesh oh yeah that you're hungry and thirsting for and brother there and there there are certain things in our flesh that brother there's only one way to get rid of it and that is when we get out of out of this body and into a glorified body definitely yeah oh my god help us to be sensitive to his leadership sensitive to the revelation of the word sensitive to brother to what he's done and what he's doing in us with us sensitive brother to what we were we were dealing with in our flesh and before we were born again and what are we dealing with now that we're born again grace grace of god i'll tell you this amen grace and again as i said there's nine fruits of the spirit oh and there's maybe 20 odd works of the flesh that we're fighting with because the devil's working on this but god's working on the spirit amen but the devil's is trying to get more more conscious of our flesh and what the flesh wants what the flesh looks for amen but brother i pray grace that the spirit has more control than the flesh oh yes i tell you there's no way there's much when it comes to the works of the flesh there's much that we want we won't get absolutely away from until we we're into a glorified body yeah i tell you if you're born again you're living from the inside out the holy ghost in your soul and he's there to get in to control your spirit because they're instincts of your spirit their spirit wants this this this but then beyond that is the instincts of your flesh amen oh my there's much there in the flesh and the devil is working with you in your mind yeah in your head in your brain amen oh you feel this you feel this you see this you see this you see that oh yeah but god amen god promised a new birth you shall be born again what for to get us to control the nature of your spirit and control the thoughts of your mind and the nature of the flesh amen oh yes now there's some natures that god just takes away but then there's other natures that stay it's there we have to deal with it but if you're born again you control hit you don't let it control you amen oh my i pray god give you the revelation of it oh yeah i don't know william branham had to deal with it when it comes to the nature of his flesh oh yeah and there he was a prophet there he was the people not understanding he get up there and discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart past present future yeah get up there and as i said and he take their hand in his and then he would oh you got this problem he knew what he knew what was troubling them in sickness oh yeah he knew a spirit was bothering them and it was absolutely the truth but yet then he said oh when when he go to a certain place and he said to minister certain countries and he said oh he said what did he do he said i got to take a cross in my pocket so you take a cross in his pocket why he said because over there he said the women would come right up he said to you oh yeah i approached her right away yeah just think of that so he was dealing with that spirit of the of the women or or them coming up if you if he was walking somewhere so he said i got to take the pocket take the cross with me amazing why because again brother he was he was born again but in his heart and his soul he was a new nature he's a new creature amen like you like me born again but still dealing with the weakness of the flesh oh yeah because the enemy is there to get oh work on this work on that the flesh the flesh the flesh amen don't let the flesh control you let jesus control amen so when the the enemy is working here oh yeah and i've got it here in my bible somewhere the instincts of the flesh see taste feel smell and hear and the instincts of your spirit is imagination conscience memory reason affection yeah so the enemy through your mind is working on those instincts to get you to surrender to that do this do this do that no you put it under god's control amen by the grace of god oh yes amen so god help us brother make sure that we're born again now make sure you're born again well if you're born again all the nature of the flesh is there but you've got a new nature in your soul amen the devil is put out jesus comes in by the holy ghost in your soul to control your spirit and through the spirit to control your thoughts yeah controlling the what the devil is trying to tempt you with in your flesh and there's a lot that he can tempt us with in our flesh amen but the holy ghost is there when the enemy comes in all through the mind the holy ghost comes up through the heart it is written it is written thus saith the lord amen god is there to con to give us control brother hallelujah see people don't realize that they think oh i'm born again so yeah so i got a new nature yeah but you got a new nature in your soul but not in not in your flesh amen because you're going to suffer things and feel things in your flesh that you're not you won't even know in your new body in your glorified body because all that stuff is going to be gone god help us amen so what you do make sure you got a right spirit the right attitude amen you control hit it doesn't control you amen grace and brother we'll get into i want to get into this but we'll do it later and that's the message called you must be born again amen so i trusted by grace we were professing maybe oh yeah i've been born again yeah but who's in control the flesh or the spirit show the grace of god be with us and uh this is a message bear with me oh this is a message that the brother preached on communion and it was the last message he preached so i don't know why there are believers who feel that we don't have to take communion something wrong somewhere so it got to be the enemy's influence because the prophet of god did say concerning communion he's talking about this world that we're living in and again like i said this was in 1965 december the 12th and was only maybe a few days later and the lord took him home yeah and he said this he said we can't stay too much longer he said we'll be in a complete insane institution and we are living in an insane world i'll tell you this when it comes to the world in general mainly insanity what they do how they do it when they do it where they do it it's an insane world they're more under the control of the devil and not jesus so brother not it's not going to get insane it is insane amen and brother when it comes to cobra 19 it's bringing out the insanity grace he said so he said we'll be in a complete insane institution and he said listen he said and he said there's something that been directly given to us by the word of god and manifested publicly before us that we know we are here amen we are at the time what of insanity and he said he said anything that has a beginning as an end amen and he said and it's that which had not the beginning as knowing and we're fixing to observe something here that's really sacred and he said i was called a few days ago to some very fine christian gentleman and it says and he understood that we take communion literally they take it what they call spiritual communion and there's believers today that won't take the bread and wine because they feel that they're taking the revelation of the word and it is spiritual i've had to deal with those spirits among believers and brother as he said they take it what they call spiritual communion and which is as far as communion i'd say all right communicate and he said the brother gave me the scripture brother benham don't you know this and he said see the reason i'm saying this so that you would understand what you're doing and if you walk into anything blindly you don't know where what you're doing you can't even con you can't even have confidence he said if you don't know what you're doing we got to know what we're doing when we take communion and foot washing yeah but he said you must understand what you are doing and why you are doing it amen god help us don't take it as a tradition no no just a religious tradition we're going to do this we're going to do that no it's it's part of our spiritual worship it's a part of our spiritual relationship with jesus no don't do it as a tradition you must understand what you are doing and why you are doing it now he said if we take the word of god isn't that god that we're taking amen yes exactly right it's true but we read ear that paul taught taking the literal lord's supper this do in remembrance of me said jesus see as often as you do it in remembrance of me you show forth the lord's death till he come amen and those that believe the message and believe that he has come and spiritually he has come oh yeah the fullness of the god of bodily in the bride praise the name of the lord but still we're physically we're in this body by the grace of god still there but with the blessed hope amen and that's why we take the communion and we're constantly reminded of eternity the price is paid for us to get into that glorified body we're still believing for it still believing amen for the resurrection of the rapture as long as we are in this body we need to take communion amen to confirm our faith praise the lord in calgary to confirm our faith in the finished work of calvary praise the lord he said you must understand what you are doing and why you are doing it and if we take the word of god isn't that god we're taking and he said listen exactly right sir it's true but we read here he said paul taught taking the literal lord's supper this do in remembrance of me amen see now we are to take it so he said we understand that saint paul who ordained it in the church being the prophet of the new testament he said peter james john all of them they wrote matthew mark luke they wrote what jesus did but paul set the thing in order he was the prophet of the new testament amen praise the lord and he said under there they had a sacrificial lamb that israel kept that for a memorial it was actually used one time coming out of egypt amen but then they kept that as a memorial all down through the age and brother as they kept that as a memorial in israel brother we keep this as a memorial until we're changed into a body like his glorious body amen and he said i do believe that communion is the lord's supper and we only have three physical divine orders left to us and one of them is communion feet washing and water baptism and he said that's the only three things that's the perfection of the three and that's the only three orders we have amen now we would say the communion should be taking the word i don't believe anyone has a right to take the lord's supper until he has taken the word of the lord into his heart amen and on the same basis we could absolutely justify salvation army yeah out there he said they do not believe in any form of water baptism said we don't need it and now he said if we don't need water baptism why are we baptized the water can't save you the blood saves you and he said i'll agree and he said the blood saves you not the water but we must take the water as an outward emotion amen that an inward work of grace has been done and is referring to water baptism amen water baptism represents our faith in the death burial resurrection of jesus amen they'll take you and lay you down and bury you in the water but you rise again amen you're testifying yeah you're going to die for him with him but when you come back you're going to receive his life he's anointed in your heart i pray grace for the anointing of the holy ghost as brother matthew was praying amen for the united the holy ghost and those that were baptized you know and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost amen and that's christ amen what's he doing he's acknowledging your faith in your water baptism and he's responding to that faith amen to take control amen is christ in you the hope of glory praise the lord see just things you do but then it says repent be baptized as you and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost that's god amen you repent you get baptized but then you're looking for the anointing of the holy ghost christ in you the hope of glory amen god help us amen so i pray the grace of god that baptized our young people that weren't baptized in water with the holy ghost exactly amen is god confirming your faith praise the lord he said now if we would say communion should be just taking the word i don't believe anyone has a right to take the lord's supper until he has taken the word of the lord into his heart amen praise the lord so you're you're you're gonna let you're allowed to take the lord's supper if you have taken the word of the lord into your heart amen and again he said take the water when it comes to the water baptism and so on and he said we must take the water as an outward emotion that an inward work of grace has been done so must we on communion amen testifying of the grace of god and the anointing of god and we're born again amen he laid down his life for us and he came back and shared it with us amen and he said when we have taken the lord our sacrifice into us as a matter of spiritual birth and his body we live by him by the word and also and says we should also symbolize it because it's a commandment repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins amen and again there are those that deny part of baptism in the name and i did hear a pentecostal pastor preach concerning salvation repent and be baptized but he oh yes he quoted the scripture and i said oh oh amazing he quoted it says be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ or in the name of jesus christ and he quoted that scripture but he skipped that part he should repent and be baptized and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost you omitted baptized in the name he omitted it i heard him on radio preaching i said oh my lord as he is directly denying the word oh yeah he quoted it but skipped where it says the name of the lord jesus skipped it brother i'll tell you when it comes to marriage and i said there's a token that that the couple makes one to the other yeah and she takes his name amen she changed their name to take his name a lot are not doing that this this day and age amen but again that's like as the natural types of spiritual because there's a lot that gets baptized but they don't want to get take his name oh yeah that's the truth to identify with jesus the lord jesus christ amen that's why they just go out and get baptized in the oh in the name of the father and of the son not in the names in the name amen of the father singular in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost amen and you will get the holy ghost amen by the grace of god so it's the lord the father jesus son christ the holy ghost amen that's what that's what those names represent amen so it's not three persons it's the three manifestations of god the three nature the three characters as it were that that is that you're dealing with god as the father you're looking at god as the son and god is the holy ghost in us christ the united one grace amen thank god for the revelation of that word and thank god for the grace to obey it amen thank you jesus but again like i said that when i i don't i don't hold the generation before me for that that's that's what god god revealed amen in this hour the lord thank the lord now god requires it amen why is god coming now with the with the revelation of the name because now the bride and the right room are united amen and she takes the name praise the lord as someone i think one time asked our brother matthew there what does the wedding ring mean symbolize and i said the wedding ring is is the token of the covenant they made in marriage so i said they they take this they take that and i said a constant reminder of the covenant by the grace of god yeah amen i won't keep you much longer and he said there are three things that we must three things that we must do as symbols the lord's supper foot washing water baptism and so on and he said now when we take this communion it isn't just a thing i'm coming up here i'm going to eat some bread and i believe i'm a christian but if you noticed the bible said he that eateth and drinketh unworthily shall be guilty of the blood and body of the lord you've got to live a life amen before the people that before god and the people that shows you are sincere and he said now just a moment longer and he said in the old testament when the sacrifice was made a statue or an ordinance and so is water baptism and ordinance so is feet washing and ordinance so is the lord's supper and ordinance blessed is he that does all of his ordinance and keeps all his statutes all of his commandments that he might have a right to enter into the tree of life amen praise the name of the lord now he said finally over and over it went again over and over it kept going until finally it become a tradition

don't think they were believers but they announced that they had been 16 months since they had since they had the communion last and they were also having communion apparently this weekend i think so i pray the grace of god to the believers who feel so deprived of not being able to come and take the bread and wine grace grace grace amen so in first corinthians chapter 11 i'm beginning to read at verse 23 and again we'll read respectively as i read 23 and the congregation 24 and every second verse amen until we all read the 34th verse 23 says for i every seed of the lord that which also i delivered unto you that thus that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread amen amen after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this do ye as oft as ye do it as he drink it in remembrance of me praise the lord thank you jesus wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily or casually shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord amen lord grace for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and bringeth damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged yes wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that ye come not together unto condemnation and the rest will i set in order when i come amen praise the lord let's sing only believe and again i was going to ask our brother mark and brother bob to partake of the to serve the communion and the bread and the wine amen so the lord bless us and again as we sing only believe i want the sisters to come up here if we can remember what we would how we've been doing it
