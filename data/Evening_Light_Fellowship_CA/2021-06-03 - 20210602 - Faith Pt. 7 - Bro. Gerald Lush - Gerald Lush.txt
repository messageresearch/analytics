forgiven you he said god don't remember it god don't that's amazing well you could say lord forgive me for this forgive me for that what i don't remember that i don't have no knowledge of that you did that you did this why because if it's gone into the sea of forgetfulness we remember but he don't this is wonderful i think this is absolutely wonderful redemption this is a wonderful plan of salvation that all we were bothered with it but not him praise the lord hallelujah brother when he laid down his life brother and he shed his blood he just wiped away all sin of all the seed of god wonderful yes thank you jesus amen brother it's more complete and more more perfect than what we realize when it comes to redemption amen as long as we're in the flesh we remember it amen but i tell you praise the lord he don't remember it praise god hallelujah well oh no that's not possible oh yes with god is possible not with me in this flesh because we got the memory but so glad when we get out of time into eternity and we get into glory we it we will forget it amen we won't remember nothing we won't remember no sin no unbelief no doubt nothing amen praise the lord because we're we're back to where we come from amen and you know what back where we come from there was no sin amen so we're going back there and then as as the seed of god the sons and daughters of god no no sin sin what's that amen we don't know so brother so perfect is god's purpose so perfect is his pattern so perfect is his plan as i said i've ministered on it before where it says in the beginning god created the heavens of the earth amen but he had a plan a perfect and a pattern a purpose and a pattern brother when he did it so i by thankful we're sharing in his plan part of his plan and he and his purpose and his pattern by the grace of god amen brother it's not accidental because a lot of you well you know but mainly out in denominations and back when we you know a lot of people when they first come to church and and believe in god believe in god with for this oh yeah and they feel that oh yeah the what happened in the garden of eden you know god didn't know what was going to happen you know and the devil just did this but god knew amen in the beginning when god started it all he knew what was going to happen and amen and he predestinated redemption praise the lord and again let me give you this 200 so you understand it see if see if you're really coming to where god wants you to be have the attitude god wants you to have and the nature god wants you to have amen say again as well why why why did god allow this why did god do this or well the devil did this so god came back to do this oh that's all that's that's the why no no no no no so i'll tell you what god wanted wanted to reveal to his sons and daughters his nature amen so he allowed it to happen not that he that he was going to well yes surely god will do this god do that no no no no he allowed it to happen so that he could he would in the in that plan amen he would reveal himself his love for you amen in that he laid down his life for you he suffered for you amen he took all your sin and wiped it away and now you're going to love him because of his character amen and he and he and he shares that character with us in the baptism of the holy ghost and many of us really feel that we have the character of jesus we have the character of god amen not just somebody who is religious but we're spiritual sons and daughters of god to god be the glory amen so the lord blesses do yes i assume that brother mark maybe shared it with you concerning brother jonathan's father and we have had association with our brother lanny for many years that's when they first moved through st to to newfoundland and so on and so we pray the grace of god to lanny today amen so keep him in prayer amen and again not not just for the physical part but for the spiritual amen so that god will deal with our brother spiritually amen so uh and we we appreciate him we appreciate his his spirit and his attitude and so on and so he and he's and to uh as long as he was serving the lord before he before he he just sinned and went back to the world the things of the world we well he we respected him and he respected us that's right because there's one point there he did say he said well he said i want to be like brother mark he said i want to be like brother bob and and the other saints and so on well i said brother i suggest to be like jesus i said what you're looking for is is your relationship with jesus amen that's what brother mark can tell you i said well bob can tell you if you want this and want that well let's go to jesus amen so we pray the grace of god to uh lanny today amen the lord will continue to deal with him amen and also uh if you will remember sister betty in prayer she's still having a lot of pain in her hips and and her leg and you know that's not something that's going to stop her from doing things that she wants to do in in the in the house and so on so there are times when she's going and all of a sudden she'll scream because of the pain that'll strike her amen so grace of god to sister betty this evening amen and she's been experiencing it again today and uh in in the in the back in the hips and in in her leg grace of god so we and again she's waiting she got to wait another six months in the appointment that she's been at she's had with another specialist so we may have to call them to try and make it reduce it down not six months maybe six days something like that so we pray grace of god to give us his leadership and also to remember of course brother bob's just a brendan prayer and so as brother bob uh continues to rest to come back from his surgery that he had a few days ago so the lord blessed them in their uh where are they oh they're out of town yeah so we pray the grace of god to them in their in their i think they'll be back on friday or

oneness lord you promised us in experiencing a relationship with jesus so we pray the grace of god today that truly lord that we are one with you amen truly lord that we are amen the word in flesh father as it was in the flesh of jesus that it would be in the flesh of mrs jesus christ and trusting by grace and lord and believing the lord that we are mrs jesus christ amen because you have done

brothers and sisters here those online in the name of the lord jesus christ they would have that revelation they would have that testimony they would have that experience lord that is christ living in them it is christ living in us hallelujah by the grace of god and for the glory of god amen elvis lord that will go forth reflecting jesus amen that will go forth reflecting god will go forth reflecting the word for the hour in which we live for your glory your honor your praise grace to us as we committed all into your care father for the going forth of your word we give you the praise and the honor amen and the glory in the name of our lord jesus christ amen and amen praise the lord god bless us turn with me to deuteronomy chapter 20 29 deuteronomy chapter 29 we pray the grace of god to those not with us tonight amen amen that wherever they are they'll call on the lord wherever they are they'll feel the presence of god is there with them as he is with us praise the lord in deuteronomy 29 and verse 1 these are the words of the covenant which the lord commanded moses to make with the children of israel in the land of moab beside the covenant which he made with them in horeb and moses called unto all israel and said unto them ye have seen all that the lord did before your eyes in the land of egypt unto pharaoh and unto all his servants and unto all his land the great temptations which thine eyes have seen the signs and those great miracles amen that he saw in egypt and it says yet the lord hath not given you in heart to perceive and eyes to see and ears to hear unto this day amen to bring us to the place that we're going to believe the way he wants us to believe amen we're going to believe amen in the attitude that he wants us to have by the grace of god amen so he was bringing moses to that position bringing moses to that maturity and brother sister god's been working on us to bring us to that maturity to believe god amen that maturity to trust the lord that maturity really to go from time to eternity amen the maturity to go out of this body and into a glorified body amen so here there is a way that god wants us to believe what he has said what he has done amen and what he has promised by the grace of god you can be seated and turn with me to second corinthians chapter four while you're turning the bible again says in deuteronomy chapter 29 and he said lest there be among you man or woman or family or tribe whose heart turneth away this day from the lord our god to go and serve the gods of these nations amen god had to do this god had to do that amen to put them on their guard but some still did what god didn't want them to do amen see why because they didn't believe it the way that god wanted them to believe it are we going to believe what god has done the way that he wants us to believe it amen are we going to believe what god is doing the way that he wants us to believe it or what god is going to do amen brother there they they say they believe this they believe it this way they believe it that way but we got to believe it in a way that it's the manifestation of a perfect faith amen praise the lord it is not it is not it's not a creed it's not just doctrine and theology no it is a revelation of the word of god that is ordained to give us faith and is ordained to give us the faith that god wants us to have in this day and in this hour amen not the faith just the faith that luther had or the faith that wesley had and the eight even the pentecostals but brother god is expecting us to have the faith that the bridegroom needs in the last day god has done that and we believe it god has done this and we believe it amen what he did in the in the pentecostal age we believe it but now brother god has done something else and god is doing something else amen brother they believed that what god wanted them to believe then and god did what he wanted to do in their day god did what he wanted to do in their age amen but brother we're not in that day we're not in that age we've gone on and brother since since the restoration began in luther it has been maybe around 500 years amen but god is still working in his seed god is still working with his word amen praise the name of the lord he is still revealing his word amen but it's he's doing it in in such a way so as to bring forth what he wants to do he is doing it in such a way so as to bring forth what god has promised is going to happen in the last days amen god did it that way for luther god did it another way for wesley god did it another way for the pentecostals and the others amen but what it what way is god doing it today well brother what are we looking for today what is god doing today amen what does god expect to accomplish amen and what he's doing and how he does it brother as we said it was justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost amen but then comes down to the perfect faith of god the perfect love of god amen and it says a brotherly kindness but it's the holy ghost love amen for him it's the holy ghost love for his word and he's there because to respond to that love and to give us what we're hungering and thirsting for amen so what are we hungry and thirsting for well brother i tell you this god the prophet of god did say and he said listen he said god sends the holy ghost to head he said to create in the heart of his seed he said what he wants to do amen so that's why he said the holy ghost true to luther amen what for to create in luther's heart a hunger amen for justification amen praise the name of the lord because they they were they were lost in in an idea in a religious religious thought thinking oh to be justified i've got to do this to be justified i've got to do that amen and god will justify me if i'm religious god will justify me if i do this no and finally brother after a long time of fighting with it and struggling god gave luther the revelation that you are justified but you've got to accept it because jesus well he did he justified us amen he justified luther he'll praise the lord hallelujah brother i tell you this god happens to believe that like that like that brother said when when god took uh took away our sins a god god in the sea of forgetfulness and god doesn't remember amen so we're so thankful that we're going into a glorious body where we won't have no memory of sin amen everything will be gone by the grace of god but brother god came down and brother this is what he wanted luther to have and he gave it to him by faith amen he wanted wesley to have that sanctification and he got wesley to the revelation that by faith jesus sanctifies us he's done it jesus justified us amen brother what jesus did he was doing for you and me what jesus did he did it to get us back amen and brother to get us back to glory to get us back into into eternity amen as the sons and daughters of god amen brother he justified us he sanctified us amen that's the life he lived that's the life that he manifested that's amen he was born without sin amen so brother amen brother oh well oh you know i'm a sinner i'm this and i'm that well thank god that jesus came to make us saints amen we were born in sin shaped and iniquity come to the world speaking lies but jesus was born without sin amen and he certainly wasn't shaped in iniquity amen but he was made in into a body like unto amen we're going to have a body like his glorious body no sin by the grace of god brother god help us to believe god out really honestly sincerely to believe in what god is doing now as luther believed in what god did then amen and wesley believed in what god did then and consider the pentecostals brother they believe what god do what what god did and what god was doing amen praise the lord hallelujah because it comes it'll come into that face it'll come into that time it'll come to that place where we got to believe what god oh yeah what he did yes but we got to believe what he's doing amen it's not the past tense no it's now it's the present tense believeth thou this amen now praise the lord as he as that he wanted martha to to believe that he was the resurrection of life and that lazarus would rise from the dead and amen oh you'll rise up there yes i believe that up there he wanted her to believe in present tense he said i am the resurrection amen praise the lord hallelujah and brother god is bringing the bride now to that place to believe for the resurrection to believe for the rapture to believe to be cut away into eternity amen to the marriage supper of the lamb brothers who would and thank god was a past tense brother what do you what do you what he's doing it's present tense amen and brother what he did to bring it into manifestation for us was past tense he did it two thousand years ago amen and even before that because the bible tells us that he was slain the lamb of god was slain before the foundation of the world amen and he came and did what was done before the foundation of the world amen brother god give us that faith brother now oh well i hope i'm this i hope on that hope i hope i'll do this i hope i'll do that i hope god will do this god already done it amen they want god to do this they want god to do that for the resurrection for the rapture they want god to do this forgive us out of time into eternity he's done it's done amen and what he's doing he's pouring out his word amen getting to get what to you to me is sons and daughters he's pouring out his word oh oh yeah okay oh yes thank you jesus you did it amen yes i did it it's yours now amen it's not not oh you got to do this and you got to do it you just what the present tense amen accept it believe it walk in the revelation of it walk in the faith of it the present tense amen amen amen well it struck luther and he went praising the lord wesley went praising the lord the pentecostals went praising the lord amen she was getting greater and greater and greater amen to the point where after the pentecostal revival the the world in general was shocked amen why were they shocked because it had such an impact and it's such an influence amen not just here not just there but he went around the world amen they said oh my this is amazing what's going on here the pentecostal revival not just it not just in the united states and it went on to canada uh excuse me went on to canada and it went on a duty to this country that country and they were shocked because it's like it went beyond what luther did it went beyond what wesley did amen and the ba and well not the pentecostals it was them brother when god as god was increasing the revelation of his word increasing the anointing of his presence with them amen and then went further and further around the world amen it had an influence on more and more and more in the world amen well to all the seed of god that was ordained to believe it or the seed of god that was predestinated to believe the pentecostal revival to believe in the baptism of the holy ghost amen the gifts of the spirit amen coming into a oneness with god amen oh yes and knowing that when we say you think pentecost would believe this well i'll tell you this that there was a pentecostal generation amen under the pentecostal revival that was looking for the resurrection and the rapture and they thought that what oh what god's going to do for the resurrection what god's going to do for the rapture or they thought that god was going to do it in the pentecostal revival well the prophet god said he did it but they didn't recognize it amen he did yes he's and then it was in 1965 it might have been around in the easter during that time and the probably god was preaching and he said they don't realize that this is the capstone of the pentecostal passage and the pentecostal age amen and moved on into a bright age because pentecost rejected it amen the pentecostal denomination because they believe that you had to do this you had to do that you had you had to speak with tongues and you had was like i mentioned to our brother jonathan went after he ministered there all right so the prophet of god said they shall speak with tongues and he said revelation amen revelation now by the grace of god i've spoken with a gift of tongues but at the same time i speaking with tom with a a greater gift than just the the a different language like amen i'm speaks preaching revelation amen i'm preaching through it is it is a gift of tongues amen to say what god wants you to say amen do you have that gift of tongues that you're going to testify what god wants you to testify out amen so brother says they shall speak with tongues and he said revelation amen and brother that's what we're speaking of and now and how many in the world understand the language that we are speaking amen this is tremendous amen when you're witnessing out there to what god has done what god is doing amen and some will see it and others don't they might they might catch a little here and catch a little there but they're not catching the fullness of the language amen that's like again our brother colombo brothers and it was joshua and ellie and they were saying brother journal uh can you speak with tongues no can you speak french no no i said i might be able to say a word here or there french and they said do you understand french i said oh yes i can understand if i pay attention to it i could have maybe just a a word here and a word there but maybe not completely amen because i'm not into that revelation amen but but again by the grace of god how many are into the revelation that god the the yeah that god is giving amen and he's speaking the language amen i'll tell you only the bride is going to understand it the bride's going to catch it amen god will say this and god will say that got to do this and got to do that and the rest of the world they don't know what what's what's he saying what's he talking about amen don't know it no i don't know that i don't understand that if if we just went out there and we preached you know uh the gifts of the spirit and and tongues and this and this oh yeah they'd understand that but we're going beyond the gifts to the giver amen most definitely but not putting the emphasis on on the gifts that's that's where pentecost failed amen so eventually the luther's doctrine became just just a doctrine amen the creed and whence these decreed the pentecostals and what what god had done what god was revealing through them it became a creed amen oh we believe we believe in this we believe in that amen but when god came down to with the capstone of the pentecostal message and the pentecostal age and god began to reveal this and reveal that no amen that's why they want that evangelist amen that we're again it was a world famous evangelist known around the world that he knew brother branham he met brother branham and he appreciated it he definitely appreciated the gifts that god had given the prophet amen and they recognize amen that they were special gifts when it comes to amen discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart amen and this evangelist went over to brother branham and he said brother branham he said you should do this you do this do this and he said stop preaching those things that you preach and he said what was he preaching he was preaching against against worldliness he was preaching again concerning what the women were doing and how they were doing it what the man was doing how they were doing it and he said brother and he said no no no brother brahm you can't preach that and he said because they didn't want to hear it well he said if i don't preach it who's going to preach it and he said god wants us to preach it amen because amen even that evangelist maybe he preached it in the early days of his ministry but as he started to get more famous and he was looking for more money more popularity amen he stopped preaching this stop preaching that amen and to shock you he was he was born and raised as it were a pentecostal christian amen he spoke in tongues he praised the lord hallelujah he was preaching and preaching it and just think amen just a few years before before the lord took him off the scene he went he left the pentecostal church and joined a methodist or something like that church what i was shocked when i read that i said what in the world did he do that for i said he's going back he's whatever the light god was that god gave him the revelation of the word i said he's turning it down and going back what was he doing it for he was he was doing it to get more support why because he wanted more money amen oh yeah and he went and he did this he went and he did that he built this he built that and so on amen brother and and and not only that it was another evangelist did the same thing and and and their motive and objective was to get more support more money from the people and they were compromising to do it amen until william brandon went out there one day and he was thinking about that and he said lord he's look what he's done and look now look what he got he got this big university and he got this and he got that and oh yeah this other brother here look what he got lord he said what about me where's mine and and so on and and the lord said son he said look up he said yours is in glory amen he said you don't need that you don't need this he said what's your god he said it's all over in glory in your amen what you're doing is going to take you back by the grace of god amen so we're not we're not here amen to be influenced by what's going on up there we're here if we're the bright we want to be influenced by the lord jesus christ we want to be influenced by god we want to be influenced amen by what the holy spirit is doing in these last days amen and brother to know what god is doing to know what jesus is doing to know amen to know what god's required of us we've got to get back to the word amen and and then i just go back to oh oh yeah they're talking about the pentecost there they're talking about this church there that church there amen oh yeah we believe this we believe that no go back to see what god is doing amen what are the signs of the end the end time amen proving that god oh yeah he did that he did that and all the other ages he did it did it did it but what's he doing now amen by the grace of god through the prophet amen by the grace of god he's bringing forth the word he's bringing forth the revelation what for to give us the faith that we need amen and it's not when it comes to faith for the pentecostals and speaking in tongues and and these things and the gifts of the spirit no brother we need more than that and and again we know that that god didn't do away with the gifts they didn't certainly didn't do away with the holy ghost but there but earth is right there amen you can have access to that and access to that but brother it's not going to get you where you need to go it's not going to get you in the rapture amen brother what we need is the is the revelation of the word it's the revelation of what god has done yes revelation what god is doing amen and what god is going to do and brother what he's doing why because we know all the other ages of the past now god what is it it is the hour for the resurrection it is the hour for the rapture it is the error to get out of time and into eternity and brother the pentecostal message is not going to do that amen we we thank god for it it's going to it's going oh it'll bless us and and it'll encourage us and make us uh healthy and so on spiritually but brother we need to get more and more healthy so that we're going to go on to eternity get out of time and into eternity but the pentecostal message won't do it amen but brother according to the word of god amen god said he was going to do this and he was going to do that amen and put us in contact with eternity amen by the grace of god and and we can share that with you maybe maybe on sunday our wednesday service we'll see by the grace of god amen to what god was going to do what god is going to do and what god has done amen what's god doing okay we'll well regarding what god has done will it get us out of time and into eternity amen amen will we experience the rapture amen brother i tell you this by the grace of god if we believe it the way god wants us to believe it it's oh my oh my oh my amen lord grace that we're not going to do it and take it like the pentecostals took it and then this church took at that church that church no we're going to take it amen and believe oh with all of our hearts lord this is the hour of the resurrection this is the hour of the rapture help us to walk in the spirit live in the spirit amen so that we're going to get more and more conscious our presence to the dead in christ because the dead in christ shall rise first amen and we which are alive remain shall be changed and caught up with them into into glory amen oh yeah brother i tell you this it's not just going to church and going to the church and yeah yeah yeah well thank the lord praise the lord thank you for thank you for the message lord yeah but what are you doing what's the message doing in you amen what effect is the message heaven in your heart and your soul and your in your life amen amen is the message is the word in control of you when it comes to the life you live every day amen brother because again the revelation with a that guy gave leather it controlled him oh yeah morning noon and night he was thanking god justif that he was justified and and wesley's message sanctification amen and the pentecostals all morning noon and night they were caught up with the anointing amen in the gifts of tongues and so on and he went on and on and on amen but it became a religion it became a denomination and brother what are the better believers of the message of what god has done oh yeah again there's just too many that's still hanging on to that what god has done in william branham and his ministry and brother that was a situation and i can see it right now that experience that i've had amen that why that as the as those back there that first came to the word first came to the message amen and and they were they were in oh goddess and a prophet god has sent a prophet amen and they went around the world preaching god has sent a prophet yeah but then there arose another generation that started to get into the word into the revelation of what god was doing yeah what he done what he did we believed but we were moving on in what he was doing amen oh yeah and all that that generation they just preached god a son of prophet god has sent a prophet amen that's right but why did he send the prophet amen what did he do through the prophet amen there's the prophet for what did god do amen and then and they and they began to misunderstand the the younger generation that was coming up to explain oh this is what's going on now the revelation that jesus christ has come down the revelation that he's here to give us perfect rapturing faith to take us home let's focus on that amen let's have that faith well they had that faith oh yeah they they believed it and and that was their morning noon and night at night rather faith and they were goddess and a prophet that was what they were preaching the preachers preached it people went around and testified of it god has set a prophet but then arose another generation amen another generation and they begin to oh that's right he sent a prophet boom look what he did amen look what god's doing now amen praise the lord so we move on beyond the prophet to the revealed word that's ordained to give us resurrection and rapturing faith yeah so how many of us are getting more and more in line and in tune for the resurrection how many was getting more and more in line in two for the rapture amen brother because you remember again help me brother that all that luther was thinking about and preaching and talking about and witnessing and testifying justification the lutherans all justification justification and then on down to pentecostals all the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit praise the lord amen that's what god was doing but they wanted they just stopped there they didn't want that didn't want to go any further oh we don't have to go any further look what god is doing oh it's the gift of the spirit his tongues amen yeah but there was another ministry to come amen the crowning of the pentecostal message but they didn't recognize that they thought all they had to do was receive the holy ghost speak in tongues amen believe god mom no no let's go on with god amen brother just saying god didn't stop with luther or wesley or the pentecostals and there was other other groups that god used but he kept moving on kept moving on by the grace of god amen brother there's a way that god wants us to believe it amen and what is the way that god wants us to believe it amen to believe it from the past tense to the present tense amen oh we believe what god has done god has done this god has done that amen but what's he doing and why why did god do that for luther why did god do that for wesley or the pentecostals and why has god done what he's done in william branham amen and brother don't worship william branham no no he's there to point us to jesus amen the same to see as john the baptist and jesus oh yeah there were those that were worshipping john the baptist no he said he said i i am not him he said i'm here i'll marry just to forerun him and introduce him amen and that's what john did you and he entered he baptized him in water and then he introduced him who he was oh yeah and brother same thing in this hour in this age when god revealed this god revealed that amen i praise the lord and then he said there's jesus amen he said that's the trouble with this generation he said they don't see the other angel amen oh yeah they saw william random they saw this they saw that but they never recognized jesus on the scene amen brother i'll tell you this as william branham has taught us he said now he said i can't do this and he said i got to wait for him to come on the scene and that was jesus amen god help us amen he was here to do this he was into that the dead was raised amen oh yeah even that ministry the dead was raised why because he who was and is the resurrection and the rapture was with us he has come down amen by the grace of god god help us to believe god help us that we're going to have the faith that that god has ordained for us to have through the message of the hour amen oh i believe the message of luther and i'm justified wesley i've sanctified it's done and the and the pentecostals the gifts of the spirit and so on i believe it amen i have that anointing in my soul praise the lord amen and i believe malachi 4. john the baptist amen turn the hearts of the fathers yeah listen now john the baptist was ordained to turn the hearts of the jewish fathers amen to the pentecostal children on the day of pentecost amen and the prophecy was again malachi 4 they said it's going to turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers amen amen turn our hearts back so that we believe god we believe the word amen that's why we're here tonight because we believe the word amen oh but th those out there they believe the word yes but it's not the word for this day amen they believe what god has done but they don't believe what god is doing amen and that's why that that those that don't believe it the way that god wants them to believe it amen they're going to miss the resurrection they're going to miss the rapture and again as i said they're going to say where is the rapture and that and as it's written it says it's already happened and you didn't know it amen why why because they never got into the revelation of what god was doing amen he was bringing us into fellowship with those that are gone on amen so that those who are gone on would come to us amen amen and meet us and that we recognizing it we're gonna be changed into glory and we'll be caught up with them to meet the lord in the air amen brother said the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them amen but we got to be in the spirit and we got to be oh yes we got to have that faith believing believing believing what god is doing sensitive to what god is doing sensitive oh lord we're getting closer to it amen help us let go and let you have your way not my will father thing be done amen so grace and not brother that's going to be that that for who's going in the rapture it's those that that let god do it amen they recognize what he's doing and they're becoming a part of what he's doing amen he makes it flesh in them the resurrection the rapture praise the lord and again as i said i believe i mentioned the last sermon there concerning what they believe concerning the the dead and they think oh that the all the graves are going to change their brother this is dust though the dust shut they'll return that old body is cursed that whole body is going to stay it could be dust and stay dust amen and maybe that will be there too where the bible or not didn't say that ashes those that are those that are cremated to me that that's not biblical so i pray the grace of god because there's even believers so-called believers that are that are planning cremation that when they die they want to be cremated no again as one brother did approach me and said well did william branham say anything about cremation that's yes i said he only mentioned it once and i said he said that uh that the the righteous will walk it on the ashes of those that are cremated that's what the bible says in book of revelation these were cremated they were cremated in judgment and the righteous were walking on their ashes amen so i said what do you want to be you want the one the righteous to walk out or you won't be the the ashes i said for them to walk on amen so brother again just the idea oh well it's the cheapest well they part they put money before god the one was more interested in the in their financial situation rather than the spiritual amen you leave it with the lord by the grace of god amen so brother and again now god did permit a lot of believers down through the years they were they were burned you know and basically many of them were burned alive amen they laid down their lives graces of god amen but brother now in this hour in this age when we know what god word declares we're going to stay with the word amen and again if there's any question to forget it don't do it amen it could be the holy spirit bringing that question to you god help us brother let's believe it the way we should believe it unless brother we're not looking for death we're looking for life we're not learning well what am i going to do with this old body well god already told you what he's going to do with it it was he said ashes dusted us and so on so he come from dust he made it from dust and it's going back to dust no no he he didn't make it from ashes he said dust amen so brother in this hour are we truly truly sincerely believing the way god wants us to believe the way true seed of god true believers believe amen believe to the to the place where the word is made flesh in us amen believe the way god wants us to believe and god bringing israel out of egypt they didn't believe the way god wanted them to believe amen oh just signs and wonders yeah god did this god did that go moses you did this you did that they wanted god do it again god said no way amen so brother just bear with me to read some more of the word all right i come out and i felt i'd just be a few minutes and god help us amen oh yes i want to welcome our brother kingsley back here amen god has put a king among us amen praise the lord and again reading from the deuteronomy there he said the lord has not given you an heart to perceive and eyes to see ears to hear on to this day but he's given us eyes to see ears to hear what god has done and what god is doing to get us out of time into eternity amen and he said again in verse 18 lest there should be among you man or woman or family or tribe whose heart turneth away this day from the lord our god to go and serve the gods of these nations lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood and it came to pass when he heared the words of this curse that he blessed himself in his heart saying i shall have peace though i walk in the imagination of mine heart to add drunkenness to thirst the lord will not spare but then the anger of the lord and his jealousy shall smoke against that man and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him and the lord shall blot out his name from under heaven amen and the lord shall separate him unto unto evil out of the tribes of israel according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this book of the law and verse 29 he said the secret things belong unto the lord our god but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever that we may do all the words of the law amen and as the bible does say another place there that god is going to bring you home he's going to bring you back but he said and and to bless you he's going to bring your children that's good that's encouraging oh yes definitely encouraging you that's where you commit them to the lord amen praise the lord let's get back to first second corinthians again amen second corinthians chapter four and well we can start at verse one therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not amen but no not faint we should be encouraged we should be given more strength more encouragement amen thank god for justification thank god for sanctification and the gifts of the holy ghost and the baptism of the holy ghost amen to become one with christ but then give us the word for the resurrection and the rapture amen he gave them faith for that faith for that faith for that now he's given us the faith for the resurrection faith for the rapture amen grace of god amen but he said have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfully he said but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of god amen but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost but if you're bride you're the seed of god amen you're going to recognize yes what he's done what he'll do but you're a part of what he's doing amen so he said it but if our gospel be hid it is into them that are lost in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto them for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake amen and in second corinthians chapter 10 praise the lord verse 3 for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh amen now indeed for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds hallelujah this is faith god honors your faith and says casting down imaginations every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god and bringeth into captivity every thought to be the obedient to the obedience of christ amen and having in readiness in a readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled amen he says do ye look on things after the outward appearance if man any man trust to himself that he is christ let him of himself think this again that as he is christ even so are we christ amen we belong to him we are is and he purchased us he paid for the price for our redemption amen for though i should boast somewhat more of our authority which the lord has given us for edification and not for our to your destruction i should not be ashamed nor let's not be ashamed of what god has given us amen let's not be ashamed of what god wants us to stand for that god wants us to testify of don't be afraid come on lord where's our faith where's our faith when it comes to the resurrection the rapture there's very there's there's not many out there today preaching for the resurrection of the rapture i don't don't hear them don't see them it's very very rare but i'll tell you this brother message preachers should be preaching resurrection rapture message preachers should be preaching look up the hour of your redemption is here amen it's not just waiting for it oh see there are those who are waiting for the resurrection waiting for the rapture amen but again the prophet said he said god is waiting on us amen for the resurrection god is waiting on us for the rapture oh so if if they're waiting on us then we've got we've got to get into into into the word we've got to get into the spirit of it amen to make sure amen to make sure that we're focusing on what they're waiting for amen and the dead in christ are waiting on that resurrection by the grace of god amen but there has to be a generation rise on the earth with resurrection and rapturing faith there has to be amen seed of god but there's not going to be many be honest trust for grace that we're numbered with the few straight is the gate narrow is the way that lead us to life and few there be that find it god help us amen it says not he that commandeth himself is approved but whom the lord commendeth amen i trust god commandeth us unto the resurrection and rapture by grace so brother why because we are numbered with the few that are believing the way we should believe amen do you believe the way you should not like not like the those out there in denomination they believe this they believe that but it's just creed it's intellectual amen they got they got the mechanics but not the dynamics amen oh yeah they're in the message but the message is not in them god help us amen brothers oh well lord thank you and the lord said thank me for what oh lord i thank you for what you're doing oh you're bringing forth the resurrection rapture no my son you are bringing forth the resurrection rapture i'm giving you the faith to bring it forth amen i'm giving you the faith to bring it into manifestation the faith to do it amen oh brother god help us amen so how do we believe the message in order for us to produce perfect faith we must believe it with a right attitude we've got to believe it with the right spirit amen that we've got to truly recognize that it's god that it's jesus amen let's go beyond william branham to jesus amen show an attitude and spirit that is willing to submit to the will of god regardless of circumstances not my will father thine be done oh you know jesus came to that place now that the bride in the end has come to that place amen that he was challenged and challenged and challenged in the flesh till he humbled himself not my will thine be done that was he did that for you and me amen and now the bride amen has come to the end of all things not my will father thine be done many a believer would like for all to have it this way this way oh yeah yeah but look look look the way that it came to jesus oh they weren't gonna just put him out of the church they're gonna crucify and brother i'll tell you this if we're going to stay if we're going to stay here on the earth and believe in what we're believing the way we believe it brother if god lets us stay long enough that we'll be crucified and i know that sometimes that there are people that are spiritually crucifying us oh yeah and brother out there in denominations they're crucifying the christ the word yeah pray grace lord not my will thyme be done amen grace brother i say that so many allow circumstances or selfish desires to prevent them from submitting to all the will of god are you in the will of god thought word and deed yes god help us let go and let god have his way all right brother are we allowing circumstances or selfish desires to prevent us from submitting to the will of god for the resurrection the will of god for the rapture amen god help us amen brother by grace i trust we got an experience of grace in our lives oh we are what we are by the grace of god amen by grace a holy ghost bible faith will always seek to say only what god says if you got a holy ghost bible faith yeah it's not your thoughts anymore it's god's thoughts not what you want it's what god wants amen by grace a holy ghost bible faith will always seek to do things that please the father you're not living for yourself you're living for god amen no matter what your your situation no matter what the issue no matter what the need you leave it with the lord you talk to talk to him with about it oh i got this need brother i i'm looking for this i'm looking for that i want this i want that well just pray and the lord will meet your need he will he promised that so brother sister have faith have faith have a bible faith oh brother i was thinking about you know hebrews 11 and where again it says by faith by faith by faith by my oh my oh my this is absolutely amazing brother from genesis right on through to the end brother what what god started in the beginning is going to finish faith by faith by faith and i said lord i said what if i were to take hebrews 11 and just preach on that and i said it verse by verse and it says by faith abel oh so we're talking about that for a while by faith this one by faith noah by faith abraham by faith oh my went on and on and on brother it was magnifying faith amen but we got oh brother we got no reason to think you know well just faith is down here no not faith faith is in control everywhere amen god looking for faith in your soul your body your spirit amen brother it's the faith coming out of the heart to your spirit coming out of the heart your spirit into into your sixth senses of your flesh your mind god help us again by grace a holy ghost bible faith will always seek to do things that please the father not what you want to do and the prophet of god did say oh we just want we just want god do this god do that god no what does god want you to do no he said don't don't get that attitude or that faith god do this god do that find the will of god and he'll do it amen and i'll tell you this i'll tell you there's a lot that are that'll end up in in eternity in in torment why oh they just stayed with the lord god do this god do that oh yeah god did this for me god did that for me yeah but was it on to eternal life no it was just to satisfy you in this world satisfy you oh i wanted this and wanted that oh the lord blessed me lord did this yeah sometimes he'll do that but it's not his will you'll keep you you'll withhold it for a while for you to get to amen what to get you to the place to say lord not my will time be done no matter what you are praying about no matter what you are looking for no matter what you feel you need or want you've got to always consider not my will father thine be done what is your will thank you jesus amen but does a lot feel i'm a christian so god will do this god what but how many want the will of god they feel i'm good so i want the lord to do this i'm good so i want the lord do that well again like i said my father always said good there's good and good for nothing he said what are you hey man he he constantly challenged all of his sons yeah to check their goodness god help us brother by grace a holy ghost bible faith will always seek to have the mind of christ in all things pertaining to life and godliness let's have the mind of christ the attitude of christ the right morals and objectives not my will time be done by grace a holy ghost bible faith will always seek to accept and humble itself to god's interpretation of his own word not he's not asking you to explain it he's asking you to accept his explanation amen by grace the holy ghost bible faith will always seek to find god's will in all things and there's a lot fuel that well what i want this or you know i i think it's the will of god you better make sure make your calling election sure maybe it's not god's will amen maybe it's just what you as a human being that's what you want i want this the flesh the flesh is hungry and thirsting for this oh lord do this do that god help us not my will thine be done amen define god's will in all things that's tremendous yeah god help us brother we think oh well i i decided this i'll decide that i'll do this i'll do that but is it the will of god grace so by grace the holy ghost bible faith will always seek to avoid attaching any selfish conditions to its prayer requests is it out of a a sincere heart seeking the will of god or is it a selfish condition something selfish that you want amen again as the bible says it's not me that lives as christ live within me and if christ lives in you you'll only do what the will of god and he'll bless you according to his will it's not what you i want this lord i want that no the will of god yeah there's times when i've had opportunities too when i was in the working business and i could uh get this job or but this job over here was it was more pay you know but i didn't base it on that i based it on lord what's your will i said lord and maybe the lord wants maybe god does maybe through the through the ears god has tested us and will test us in those things oh yeah and yeah and humanly fleshly they'll choose oh oh okay lord thank you i'll take the i'll take the the higher wage the more money maybe god didn't didn't want you to do that no okay sometimes god don't see again it's like the couple that i told you about that took their the home that they had there it was a house there and they took it because god in a dream told him to do it and he says take it and i want you to give it to the pastor what no he didn't question god he got up in the morning told his wife she said yes she said i believe it she said we'll do it yeah and they let they they give give the the house to to a pastor and they they left and they went and moved into a another lady's garage she had a garage there attached to her house and she said you can live here amen and they had to do this they did this god said do this do this yeah and think things and they got more god they got poor more poor and more poor more poor that finally oh yeah but their attitude was right their spirit was right they were giving god the glory yeah and finally god blessed them and they became millionaires yeah but and again it wasn't their choice it was god's choice amen brother be led by the spirit not your flesh amen god's leadership see again there's too many of us in this tower in in in the hour that we're living in these last days oh my we're so intellectual oh we're going to decide this we'll decide that we'll do this we'll do that amen what's god's will don't don't have intellectual thoughts have spiritual thoughts amen amen this is it's the lord that's with you so if he's with you talk to him about it consult the lord in all things in all thy ways acknowledge him amen and i'm not going to do this and do this to say if the lord willing i'll do this amen not my will thine be done god help us yeah is that what you like what is god like amen what what is it that god will do in you and have you to do so that you become a greater and a greater witness of jesus you're reflecting jesus amen not reflecting the devil you're reflecting jesus amen and your your your attention is not on self no no that's what the devil was doing with eve eve this is going to please you you're going to feel good with this you're going to like this oh that right oh yeah so she focused on on what she wanted and on our on our feelings but not on the word of god yeah remember the devil only added one word god said you shall surely die and satan said no he said that you he said i'll say but you shall not surely die i just added a word there well that's what he does today in your experience in your your relationship with jesus he's there to try and deceive you he's just trying to weaken you and what he'll do is if you're you're you're going to make this decision that decision oh yeah and satan is right there if you're making it you're going to leave with the lord satan is saying well you don't have to do this the lord won't mind you doing this the lord will might well you better talk to the lord about it and i speak those things because it's it's what i've experienced over all these years amen not my will father thine be done by grace a holy ghost bible faith will always seek to avoid attaching any selfish conditions to his prayer requests not what i want lord is what whatever your will is lord i'll accept it amen we are instructed to let our requests be known to god by prayer and supplication but faith does not tell god what to do or how to do it lord do this lord do that no lord not my will thy will be done amen i'm not going to tell god what to do i'll let god tell me what to do amen but it's amazing how many so-called believers expect god to answer prayer based on certain selfish preset conditions instead of just being prepared to accept the will of god amen see it's like the sister that went to jesus and she said lord i want she had two sons there and she want them to sit each one one under on the left one on the right hand of jesus yeah he's strong what that was a mother's love for natural love for for her sons and wanting to you know elevate them to this elevate them to that listen start down here and if they're humble god will bring them up yeah if you're really sincerely humble gotta bring them up see again it's like that brother that he was he moved from a certain place there at province in canada and he was working in a high position and he had a lot of money but he had i don't know many children that he had but and but there was no no church and he wanted he wanted to get to a church it was you know for his for his sons and our daughters or children whatever they were and so what he did was he quit the job that he had and it was a very powerful rich job and he quit it and he said i'm going to move you know what he became a janitor he moved to a certain city in another province in in canada and he became a janitor what yeah he became a janitor he did that for the glory of god he said thank the lord praise the lord now he had a he was going to church and having fellowship with the saints and the influence of of the word of for him for for his children and so on it was good so he was thanking the lord for that even though his salary was way down low but god blessed him and oh i don't think it was brother kingsley but he did end up with the same thing that our bullet kingsley is right there he started he he became the head of the janitorial business yeah he's a man he went and started a janitorial business and god blessed him amen as we would pray our lord to bless our brother kingsley amen in his business amen oh yeah he blessed that brother oh do that well praise the lord humble yourself and the lord will draw near and the lord bless you amen brother as he blessed that brother he's blessed our brother kingsley amen to god be the glory amen so brother we let's be be prepared to accept the will of god and i'll tell you there's a lot of believers they're not there to accept god's will why because they feel that it's not their will this is not my i want this or they feel i need this what you need is god's will well i need this i need that well get god's will first and he and he'll give you anything else you feel you need and he if he fails you really need it he'll give it to you amen brother sister god help us to have faith in god and of us to live for god elvis amen to be more and more conscious of god amen brother not just a historical book like we don't think this is an history in in the bible there no brother it's a revelation of god's personal relationship with you and me amen listen it's not mental or intellectual faith that most have it is a perverted faith he said and this is this is what the devil deceived even to doing and what did she do she put selfish desires ahead of god's perfect will amen god help us to seek the will of god not my will father thine be done amen i'll try to finish with just a couple of quotes here amen and it was the message perfect faith in 1963 and he said when a man lives by faith walks by faith i mean substance faith is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new creature in christ there now he says you're getting into bright material you're getting into a rapturing condition amen brother substance faith it is the substance of things over and the evidence of things not seen amen and he said that means for each one of us not just the pastor the deacons or the trustees that means for the laity every individual walks in a world with god alone amen and you're baptized into this kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and god and he gives the orders and you pack them out and whatever he says there's not a shadow of doubt nowhere amen you walk right on and if the lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it and if you go right on just the same and he said you're coming into a perfect faith perfect perfection that cannot fail amen and he said yes he was a mystic to them with his perfect faith and so is it now with those who have perfect faith are a mystic to others amen and we are taught to resist the devil and he will flee from us amen now he said to resist is just to just simply turn him down just resist him and that is just the way walk away from him and god said a certain thing no matter what he's trying to tell you you don't even listen to him he said your ears are deaf to anything else but what the spirit says amen and he said to e that at the near that listens see what the spirit saith unto the churches he said the one that's got the listening post amen he said that catches what the spirit says amen the spirit of god not the spirit of the devil amen let's be on our guard because satan is there amen to get us to focus on self amen but we want to give the glory to jesus amen listen say i'll finish with a couple of quotes here he said i think a pastor if he is called to be a pastor he should be a pastor and i want all god's peoples to know that that pastor has just as much right to pray for the sick as any any other person and he said now he said get this real close there is no one in the world that could do one thing for you towards divine healing only to get you to believe in what jesus has already done god helped us to believe because he he did say in another place he said if you can't believe for healing now you're going to believe for the rapture rapture is the complete change of the body so if you can't believe for healing the body are you going to wait for the rapture he said there is no one in the world that could do one thing for you towards divine healing only to get you to believe in what jesus has already done people say i have the i have healing power in my hands that's wrong he said there's no such a thing as that yeah or sometimes in your loud voices like t.l osborn and in the in the film of brother branham that we had played here not long ago and brother brown was preaching speaks to them and then then he's behind the pope there waiting for the angel to come waiting for the pillar fire to come in and so on and uh i wasn't aware of it that t.l osborne was in that meeting he was yes he was yeah and he said i and he said and what shocked him concerning william branham and his ministry he said well he said oh it shocked me he said i i just oh what's going on here i don't understand this he said because he said i i'm a very noisy he said pentecostal when it comes to praying for the sick because they would as pentecostal evangelists they would lay ends on on on a sick person and then they would shake them or do this with them do that one then they would scream shame come out get away what and here he said is william branham and he said he's standing there and he just says oh oh he said this is your problem right low his voice was right low and then oh one person there said oh always that's the devil he said this that's in this child and he went over and he laid his hands right gentle he was very gentle on the child and he's very quiet in his voice and he said satan in the name of jesus christ come out of the child enter no more into her in the name of our lord jesus christ and within a few seconds brother brown said oh he said satan is gone he said he left the child he won't be back he said praise the lord wonderful all right he says sister he said go on praise the lord and theologian was in the balcony there somewhere in the audience and he said i was shocked he said why what he never even screamed at him he said he was right quiet and he and he said i and i watched it again and he did it again i said my what's going on here why don't you why one willing random scream why won't he ball at him no because it was faith faith is not noisy not that not that faith of praying for the sick no no but god don't make don't matter if we're lord if you get noisy and praise the lord amen but when it comes to your power over the devil no faith no matter how quiet you are your faith is in the word of god satan satan to recognize it satan knows amen if anyone recognizes your faith the devil does yeah amen so brother brother osborne tommy of course he died a few years ago and uh he was one of the evangelists that was really appreciating brother brown's ministry yeah he and he loved brother branham so i pray grace lord help us have faith amen that's why he said i'm a noisy pentecostal because when he prayed for the sick the pentecostals prayed for the sake they had raised their voice a loud voice and condemned that devil shaped the person well but if you're using faith you don't have to shake them you don't have the ball at them just speak the word amen praise the lord so he said again they may be honestly you know he said people say i have healing power in my hands or or a loud voice no no it's faith and he said there's no such a thing as that that's wrong and he said you just get away from that and he said when anyone says that you know and he said they may be honestly but ignorantly interpreting god's terms of divine healing amen for no one no matter who it is no one could already do what jesus has already done he shall for healing was in the redemption the redemptive blessing amen one of them is divine healing and jesus paid the full price at calvary amen and the only thing you do is accept it he said but i couldn't forgive our one sin sin of yours but god has already done it and you have to accept it in christ amen he said jesus paid the full penalty for sin when he died now he said we'll never do you no good until you accept it you have to accept it and then he said it's not hard how hard you cry no how much you beg how much you persuade it's a surrender art to god with faith believing what he did amen and he said even our altar calls in bringing people up around the altar and he said they didn't do that in the bible time that's a tradition of our people originated formally in the methodist church but look it's a good thing i don't like this dry-eyed repentance he said i like to see somebody get up and really be sorry for what they've done and really mean it no matter how much that you pray you will never be forgiven until you believe you are forgiven amen and it says and no one will know no matter how much you cry how much you pray how much you shout how many times you speak with tongues whatever you do you're still not he said until the fruits of the spirit bear record in you for by their fruits ye shall know them amen above everything that you do love one another and as you love one another you will love god and these things that are going on and taking place in the meeting are only vindication of his presence with us amen god's grace amen we could go on but we'll leave it there god's grace that we have the faith that is substance the faith that is real amen it's just not a feeling no it is life by the grace of god the lord bless you let's stand the lord amen let's see let's say 3 380 380 a glorious church do you hear them coming brother throwing up the steeps of light clad and glorious shining garments blood wash garments pure and white shall the grace of god be with us to pray pray pray but let's have the faith of god hold faith in god but yell let us have the faith that god gives us amen we know again we know that the bible says without faith it is impossible to please him amen so i pray that we'll have the faith that does please him by grace amen so god bless you we'll turn to our brother mark and keep in prayer again for the for brother uh jonathan's father amen so the grace of our yes this brother jonathan is his grandfather amen so we pray the grace of god that the lord will continue to deal with our brother and also sister betty and her needs and also pray for brother tom snow and again i assume that he's still with us well and i was thinking lord i felt he's still with us that's his nature uh he's in his 80s for sure 85 or 86 years old but and but he's got that faith he's there to fight the devil amen oh yeah even even though his mind is confused right now and he's as i said they thought he was going to be gone within three hours or a week and now it's almost a month amen but he's still hanging on amen as far as i know so god's grace to us so lord bless you and please please please pray pray pray one for another walk in prayer you know it's not just i pray this morning i prayed this afternoon i prayed tonight no you you just go in the spirit of prayer when you go on and on and on you're thinking about the lord you're and you're conscious of jesus he said i'll never be
