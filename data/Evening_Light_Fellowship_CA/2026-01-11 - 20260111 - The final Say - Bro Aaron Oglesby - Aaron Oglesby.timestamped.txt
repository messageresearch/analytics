[28:07] He

[30:22] goodness.
[30:24] But the fruit of the spirit is
[30:28] faithfulness,
[30:31] gent.
[30:36] And if we walk into the spirit, we must
[30:40] keep in step
[30:43] keep

[30:49] We march in his spirit. We must keep in
[30:54] step

[31:02] But the fruits of spirit and love, joy,
[31:07] peace,

[31:52] But with the fruits of the spirit
[31:56] still joy, peace,
[31:59] patience, kindness,
[32:03] goodness,
[32:04] but the fruits of the spirit,
[32:08] faithfulness,
[32:12] gentleness, and self control.
[34:21] Is this working? Just want to give a
[34:24] brief testimony.
[34:26] Guess
[34:28] when um shortly before Raphael was born,
[34:33] Priscilla and I, we both
[34:35] she's for those of you that don't know,
[34:37] she's dealt with rheumatoid arthritis
[34:39] since she was 16. It's when she was
[34:41] diagnosed.
[34:42] So, it's uh more than half her lifetime
[34:45] dealing with that as a young person and
[34:47] now as a mom. And you can imagine that
[34:50] uh there's been some valleys in in that
[34:53] over that course of time.
[34:56] So before he was born, um both she and I
[35:00] felt that it was the Lord's time for her
[35:02] healing
[35:04] and she stepped out in a big step of
[35:06] faith. Uh went off her medication
[35:09] for 6 months.
[35:12] Uh in the end, I guess the lesson for us
[35:14] there was that we got ahead of the
[35:15] Lord's timing and she went through a
[35:18] very tough time in those six months.
[35:22] And then that was in 2021. And um the
[35:26] following years continued to be uh quite
[35:29] difficult for her not just physically
[35:31] but also spiritually dealing with the
[35:33] the questions around that and how do you
[35:36] now untangle that and then how do you
[35:39] you know keep believing and you know
[35:42] expecting it for for herself. So that
[35:45] became a big burden for me as the head
[35:47] of the home and in leading her in that
[35:51] direction.
[35:53] I really felt a great burden for her cuz
[35:54] I just saw it affecting her in a lot of
[35:56] different ways including in church and
[35:58] in her worship and in her liberty and so
[36:00] forth.
[36:03] So there there was a different special
[36:05] meetings we had. Brother Dwayne Far when
[36:07] he was came through here. Um
[36:12] I went up for prayer and uh
[36:16] cried into his shoulder just
[36:18] uh asking him to pray that God would
[36:21] help her
[36:23] cuz I felt responsible. and
[36:27] uh brother John I uh shared that with
[36:30] him in many different conversations and
[36:33] I know he's been praying for me and and
[36:35] the church.
[36:36] Um, and then we go forward to 2024 and
[36:41] we had the camp meetings and brother
[36:43] Aaron and sister Lydia were here. And
[36:45] again, it was it was that that cloud was
[36:49] still over her. And at the time, I was
[36:52] also dealing with some real stress in my
[36:54] life with with my business.
[36:57] And it was 2024 and it was just a
[36:59] difficult year for us. and I was faced
[37:02] with the stress of do I need to do
[37:05] layoffs and make some changes or do I
[37:08] wait and and you know for things to pick
[37:10] up and so it was just that August was a
[37:13] really uh really heavy time you know for
[37:15] for two of those reasons. So again, I
[37:17] went up for prayer uh to brother Aaron
[37:20] prayed for me and uh
[37:23] to boil it down what he said to me. He
[37:25] said, "Brother, I see the light at the
[37:26] end of the tunnel."
[37:28] And so in those meetings uh right away,
[37:31] I just saw a big difference in Priscilla
[37:33] and just again that freedom and liberty
[37:35] that she's known for in her worship. And
[37:38] um we're still walking through that
[37:40] battle. you know, she's she's still
[37:43] believing for her healing and we're just
[37:46] trusting God's timing in it, whatever
[37:47] that is, whatever his purpose is.
[37:50] So, prophet of God said that as his
[37:52] children, sometimes he says no,
[37:55] sometimes he says wait. And it's it's a
[37:59] indication that we're a child of God
[38:00] when we can accept that and we can wait.
[38:03] So, it's um but it's not easy to to get
[38:06] the the the the
[38:08] answer that you have to wait. that's
[38:10] that's uh very difficult sometimes. So,
[38:13] I just wanted to share that to just give
[38:14] God the glory and to thank all of you
[38:16] for your prayers and brother John,
[38:18] brother Aaron, um Dwayne, the different
[38:20] ones that God has sent along to to help
[38:22] us through it. And we just wanted to
[38:25] sing this song as a a testimony to the
[38:28] grace and the longsuffering of God.
[38:46] I have a source
[38:51] in times of need
[38:56] that gives me hope,
[39:01] that brings me peace
[39:05] in every Try
[39:10] through every test.
[39:14] My savior stands
[39:19] in my defense.
[39:23] So when the road you walk
[39:28] leaves you tired and worn,
[39:32] &gt;&gt; all your strength is gone.
[39:37] and your heart feels torn.
[39:42] Remember, God
[39:45] is greater than the storm.
[39:50] Take courage for
[39:54] the battle is the Lord.
[39:59] When the waters rise,
[40:04] he calls my name
[40:08] and he bids me come
[40:13] out on the waves.
[40:17] He holds my hand
[40:22] lest I should falter.
[40:26] And he makes me stand
[40:31] upon the water.
[40:35] When the road you walk
[40:40] leaves you tight and warm,
[40:44] &gt;&gt; all your strength is gone
[40:48] and your heart feels torn.
[40:53] Remember, God
[40:57] is gater than the storm.
[41:02] Take courage for
[41:05] the battle is alone.
[41:11] When the waters rise,
[41:15] &gt;&gt; he calls my name
[41:20] and bs me come
[41:24] out on the waves.
[41:28] He holds my hand
[41:33] lest I should fall.
[41:37] And he makes me stand
[41:42] upon the water.
[41:45] So when the road you walk
[41:50] leaves you tied and warm,
[41:54] all your strength is gone.
[41:59] and your heart feels torn.
[42:03] Remember, God
[42:06] is gater than the stor.
[42:12] Take courage for
[42:15] the battle is the Lord.
[42:20] I have a source
[42:25] &gt;&gt; in times of need
[42:30] &gt;&gt; that gives me hope
[42:34] that brings me peace.
[42:39] In every trial,
[42:43] through every test,
[42:47] my savior stands
[42:52] in my defense.
[42:56] So when the road you walk
[43:00] leaves you tired and worn,
[43:04] all your strength is gone.
[43:09] and your heart feels torn.
[43:13] Remember God
[43:16] is greater than the storms.
[43:22] Take courage for
[43:25] the battle is the Lord.

[51:49] the ministry comes, but I just wanted to
[51:52] do it. It may be a blessing to

[59:43] to thank brother Aaron again before he
[59:45] comes to minister for coming to us,
[59:46] sister Lydia with them. We always enjoy
[59:49] them so much. It's a sacrifice to leave
[59:50] the warmth of Louisiana for the weather
[59:52] of Newfoundland. But they were happy to
[59:55] see the snow as I picked them up on on
[59:57] Thursday. So, uh I'm happy for that. But
[1:00:00] it's been such a wonderful time. We want
[1:00:01] to welcome Sister Nadine back to us.
[1:00:04] First time she's been here since she got
[1:00:05] t-boned in the car. So, we're so
[1:00:08] thankful to see her standing there and
[1:00:10] able to come to service. Amen. What a
[1:00:12] wonderful thing. We want to welcome
[1:00:13] Sister Joanne's mother that's been
[1:00:15] visiting us as well. Amen. God bless
[1:00:16] you, sister. It's good to have you here.
[1:00:18] And sister Darlene as well. God bless
[1:00:20] you. Amen. We're going to turn it right
[1:00:22] over to brother Aaron to minister the
[1:00:24] word this morning. He has full liberty
[1:00:26] as always. There's no clocks here. We're
[1:00:28] going to have a fellowship after with
[1:00:29] food so we we don't have to worry about
[1:00:31] those things. So, let's just settle in.
[1:00:33] We're woke up now. Let's settle in and
[1:00:36] hear the word. Amen. And let the word do
[1:00:39] a work in our life this morning. We're
[1:00:40] going to sing that song by his word.
[1:00:42] Amen. 1260. As he would come, Amen. Just
[1:00:45] pull on the gift. Lift your hand to him.
[1:00:48] Say, Lord, not to him, to him. Say,
[1:00:52] Lord, I've got a need. I've got a
[1:00:54] question. I've got a concern. Say, Lord,
[1:00:56] raise my faith to the standard of your
[1:00:58] word that I could stand on it. not just
[1:01:00] in this service but as we go out this
[1:01:02] afternoon that it would go with me and
[1:01:04] help me to overcome in my life. Amen.
[1:01:06] Let's sing this as he comes.
[1:01:09] Oh, by his word
[1:01:17] I preail
[1:01:24] by his word.
[1:01:30] I'll never
[1:01:33] fail.
[1:01:38] By his word
[1:01:45] I'll overcome.
[1:01:52] Oh by his word
[1:01:56] I'll prevail.
[1:02:00] I'll overcome.
[1:02:06] Oh, by his word.
[1:02:27] I'll never
[1:02:39] Thank you Lord.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:45] Yes Lord.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; By his word.
[1:03:00] Do we believe that this morning
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; by his word? Because his word can never
[1:03:04] fail and you are a part of that word.
[1:03:08] Therefore, you're not going to fail.
[1:03:10] Amen. Before we pray, I I just want to
[1:03:13] take a moment and say thank you. You uh
[1:03:15] you make us feel so welcome here, like a
[1:03:18] part of you, and I I truly feel that
[1:03:20] way. We love you with the love of the
[1:03:21] Lord. It it's been a a real joy. a real
[1:03:24] joy to be with you once again and and
[1:03:27] and see you again. And you know, I I I
[1:03:30] travel a fair amount,
[1:03:34] been in different size congregations.
[1:03:39] No matter how big a congregation is,
[1:03:41] I've never been in a place
[1:03:44] that that that can create a better
[1:03:46] atmosphere than you people do. Y'all
[1:03:49] really enter in with your whole heart,
[1:03:50] and it means so much to me. It does
[1:03:52] something to me.
[1:03:53] I stepped out of the back door right
[1:03:55] there today just in tears just watching
[1:03:57] you give your everything. And I believe
[1:03:59] that's we have to what we have to do in
[1:04:00] this day is give our everything.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; He gave his everything for us. So let's
[1:04:04] give him our everything. I I sure
[1:04:06] appreciate you and love you and we just
[1:04:08] want to turn our attention to the word
[1:04:10] now. Thank you so much. Father, we love
[1:04:12] you, Lord. We just surrender our
[1:04:14] thoughts and our thinking and everything
[1:04:15] to you right now and ask you that you
[1:04:16] would take control of this service.
[1:04:18] Lord, I pray that you would give me
[1:04:20] liberty to speak the things that you
[1:04:21] want said. And Lord, shut my mouth to
[1:04:24] things you don't want said, Lord. Lord,
[1:04:26] in other words, just remove me out of
[1:04:28] the equation, Lord, as much as possible
[1:04:30] today. And may you speak, Lord. May your
[1:04:32] people be encouraged, Lord. That's what
[1:04:34] drove me even through through the night,
[1:04:37] Lord, is you letting me know to
[1:04:39] encourage the people. So, Lord, that's
[1:04:41] what we're going to do today. And I just
[1:04:42] ask that you'll get in it and have your
[1:04:43] way, Father. In Jesus name we pray.
[1:04:47] Amen. And amen. Thank you very much. If
[1:04:50] you have your Bibles with you today and
[1:04:52] you'd like to turn with me,
[1:04:55] we're going to look in the book of
[1:04:56] Isaiah, chapter 14. The book of Isaiah,
[1:04:59] chapter 14.
[1:05:01] We're going to titled this message
[1:05:03] today, the final say.
[1:05:06] The final say. Amen. But Chad, sure is
[1:05:10] good to see you today, buddy. Amen. It's
[1:05:13] a better place to see you than where I
[1:05:15] saw you last time. Amen.
[1:05:18] Isaiah 14 verse 12
[1:05:22] it says here how art thou fallen from
[1:05:24] heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how
[1:05:28] art thou cut down to the ground which
[1:05:30] did weakest the n weaken the nations
[1:05:33] for thou hast said in thine heart I will
[1:05:35] ascend into heaven I will exalt my
[1:05:37] throne above the stars of God I will sit
[1:05:39] also upon the mount of the congregation
[1:05:41] and the sides of the north I will ascend
[1:05:43] above the heights of the clouds I will
[1:05:45] be like the most high Yet thou shalt be
[1:05:48] brought down to hell, to the sides of
[1:05:50] the pit. They that see thee shall
[1:05:53] narrowly look upon thee and consider
[1:05:55] thee, saying, Is this the man that made
[1:05:58] the earth to tremble, that did shake the
[1:06:02] kingdoms? Amen. You can have your seats
[1:06:05] this this morning.
[1:06:10] You know, I love this because it shows
[1:06:12] Satan and and and all his plans and it
[1:06:15] shows his desire to have dominion over
[1:06:18] God's creation and dominion over you
[1:06:20] really and and to control your life. And
[1:06:23] we see right here even in the scripture
[1:06:25] that what we learn is that the the the
[1:06:27] plans of Satan will never stand. Amen.
[1:06:30] Satan is he's never short on plans. And
[1:06:32] it's something that we can trace all the
[1:06:34] way down through the Bible, what what he
[1:06:36] plans to do and how he plans to control
[1:06:38] man and how he plans to ascend and you
[1:06:41] know he planned to take over uh uh the
[1:06:44] the creation of God there in the garden
[1:06:46] and he has plans for you today. Yeah,
[1:06:49] that's the truth. And sometimes it even
[1:06:51] seems like that Satan's plans are
[1:06:53] successful to a degree. And as he begins
[1:06:56] to carry these things out and and if we
[1:06:59] look at it through natural eyes, many
[1:07:00] times it would seem like Satan's plan is
[1:07:04] working because we see the circumstances
[1:07:06] that come with his plans. Amen. We see
[1:07:09] the circumstances that rise up against
[1:07:11] you and and symptoms and and things of
[1:07:14] that nature become really bad. And I
[1:07:16] just want to encourage you this morning
[1:07:17] that no matter how bad it looks and no
[1:07:20] matter what the situation looks like,
[1:07:22] Satan does not have the final say. Amen.
[1:07:26] He He doesn't get the final say in your
[1:07:29] life because my God still lives and and
[1:07:31] this morning when I woke up, I
[1:07:33] understood that my God is alive and that
[1:07:35] his promises are still true and that his
[1:07:38] word never fails. So So no matter where
[1:07:40] we're at today, if that's all we get out
[1:07:42] of this, understand this. His promises
[1:07:44] are true and his word never fails.
[1:07:47] Hallelujah. Amen. So, what I'm asking
[1:07:49] you to do today is that we look away
[1:07:50] from what the enemy is saying. We We
[1:07:53] look away from our circumstances and we
[1:07:55] look to Jesus this morning and we we
[1:07:57] look away from our failures and our
[1:07:59] abilities and we look away from our
[1:08:01] sins. We look away from our sickness.
[1:08:03] Look away from everything that the devil
[1:08:05] is saying because he's always going to
[1:08:07] be saying something. He's always going
[1:08:10] to be trying to point you to a negative.
[1:08:11] and he's always going to be trying to
[1:08:13] point you to a symptom and he's always
[1:08:15] going to be constantly bringing up the
[1:08:17] worst case scenario. So, we got to look
[1:08:19] away from that. Listen, he boasts all
[1:08:21] the time. That's what he does. Satan
[1:08:24] boasts all the time and he tries to
[1:08:26] bring fear and he tries to bring
[1:08:27] torment. But to a believer, it's never
[1:08:30] the final say. Amen. I I I don't tie my
[1:08:33] anchor to the lies of the enemy. Too
[1:08:36] many times we we're repeating what he
[1:08:38] said. But the devil said and and the
[1:08:40] devil said and the devil said. But
[1:08:42] listen, the devil doesn't have the final
[1:08:44] say in your life. He doesn't get a vote
[1:08:47] in how this thing turns out. It isn't a
[1:08:49] democracy.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; He doesn't get to cast a vote. Well, I
[1:08:53] think because of this sin and because of
[1:08:55] this failure and where he strayed here
[1:08:57] and he didn't pray enough here and he
[1:08:59] didn't do these things, I think he
[1:09:00] shouldn't make it to heaven. God says
[1:09:02] your voice doesn't matter in this
[1:09:04] situation. My blood speaks, my word
[1:09:07] speaks, my grace speaks on their behalf,
[1:09:09] and that's the only thing that matters
[1:09:11] this morning. Amen. The devil says a
[1:09:14] lot, but none of what he says is
[1:09:16] eternal.
[1:09:18] His word didn't speak worlds into
[1:09:20] existence. His word didn't create
[1:09:23] atmospheres. The devil's word didn't
[1:09:25] create your body. But my God,
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; my God, the word of our God, the
[1:09:31] faithful and the true witness, the one
[1:09:33] whose word can never fail, he gets the
[1:09:37] final say.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Satan said, "I will ascend." But
[1:09:41] God's word says, "You're going to be
[1:09:43] brought down to the pit."
[1:09:45] &gt;&gt; Satan says, "I'm going to be lifted up
[1:09:47] on the sides of the north. I'm going to
[1:09:49] reign over the congregation." And God
[1:09:51] says, "No, you're going to be nothing
[1:09:52] but a worm. You're going to be cast
[1:09:54] down." Amen. Revelation 3:14 tells us
[1:09:59] gives us a picture of our Lord and
[1:10:01] Savior. It says, "Unto the angel of the
[1:10:03] church of the Leosians, right? These
[1:10:05] things saith the amen,
[1:10:08] the faithful and true witness, the
[1:10:11] beginning of the creation of God." This
[1:10:14] word faithful here means person who
[1:10:17] shows themselves faithful in the
[1:10:19] transaction of business. One who is
[1:10:22] worthy of trust. one that can be relied
[1:10:25] on.
[1:10:26] True means that which is not only the
[1:10:29] name and resemblance but the real nature
[1:10:32] corresponding to the name in every
[1:10:35] aspect corresponding to the idea
[1:10:38] signifying by the name real true
[1:10:41] genuine. In other words, it is opposite
[1:10:44] of imperfect or uncertain. the things
[1:10:47] that are in this word, the promises that
[1:10:50] speak of you, the promises that that
[1:10:52] show you there with him before the
[1:10:54] foundation of the world, the promises
[1:10:55] that says to him that overcome, the
[1:10:57] promises that says they'll be there and
[1:10:59] their offspring with them, the promises
[1:11:01] that says by his stripes you are healed,
[1:11:04] they are faithful and they are true. You
[1:11:07] can put your trust in this word this
[1:11:09] morning. All else may be failing. You
[1:11:12] may not know where to turn to find
[1:11:14] truth, but this morning, this is true.
[1:11:16] This is faithful. And you can submit
[1:11:19] yourself. You can you can hang your very
[1:11:21] soul today on the words that are in this
[1:11:24] word. They are spoken by the amen of
[1:11:28] God. Spoken by the one who's worthy of
[1:11:31] our trust. One who is real. One who is
[1:11:34] true. One who is genuine. Prophet of God
[1:11:38] says Jesus is giving us this description
[1:11:40] of himself in relation to the last age.
[1:11:43] That's where we stand. The days of grace
[1:11:46] are winding up. He has looked from the
[1:11:48] first century right through to the 20th
[1:11:50] and told us all things concerning these
[1:11:52] ages. Before he reveals the
[1:11:55] characteristics of the last age to us,
[1:11:58] he gives us one final look at his own
[1:12:00] gracious and supreme deity. This is the
[1:12:03] capstone revelation of himself.
[1:12:06] Thus saith the amen. Jesus is the amen
[1:12:11] of God. Jesus is the so let it be of
[1:12:14] God. Amen stands for finality. It stands
[1:12:17] for approval. It stands for prevailing
[1:12:20] promise. It stands for unchanging
[1:12:22] promise. It stands for the seal of God.
[1:12:26] This is where I'm going to anchor at
[1:12:28] today. This is where I'm going to stand
[1:12:30] at today. It's an unchanging promise.
[1:12:33] It's a prevailing promise. It's the seal
[1:12:35] of God. Amen. There is only one who has
[1:12:39] the final say in your life. God makes
[1:12:42] the final decision. Satan never has the
[1:12:45] final say in a believer's life, in a
[1:12:48] believer's situation. So, how comforting
[1:12:50] is when when we don't understand, when
[1:12:53] we can't understand why, when we have
[1:12:56] heartaches and we have loss. Let me tell
[1:12:58] you this. The devil did not win.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; I can't understand this. The devil did
[1:13:04] not win. Understand? He is working all
[1:13:08] things for your good.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, brother Aaron, I can't see how it's
[1:13:12] for my good. And the problem is many
[1:13:14] times because we're expecting it to work
[1:13:16] for our earthly good.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; And I don't mean this in the wrong way.
[1:13:20] God is concerned about our day-to-day.
[1:13:22] He is concerned about our finances, but
[1:13:24] and things of that nature. But when he
[1:13:26] says, "I'm working all things for your
[1:13:27] good," he's not talking about those
[1:13:29] things. He's talking about your eternal
[1:13:31] good. So, you're in this trial and this
[1:13:34] trial and you say, "I can't see how this
[1:13:36] is working out for my good." That's
[1:13:38] okay. He's not worried about it working
[1:13:40] out right now for your good. Everything
[1:13:42] you go through, every situation is to
[1:13:45] work to make sure you end up there.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; I'm making sure this is molding you and
[1:13:50] making you and doing whatever it takes.
[1:13:53] So, on that day, it all turns out for
[1:13:56] your good.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:02] We live in the age of a million voices,
[1:14:04] if not more. And all of them are intent
[1:14:08] on having a say in your life.
[1:14:12] All of them want a piece of your time.
[1:14:15] All of them trying to have influence,
[1:14:18] speaking constantly. And we have to be
[1:14:20] careful what we lend our ears to. Amen.
[1:14:23] Doubt and unbelief h have more avenues
[1:14:25] today and more outlets to speak through
[1:14:28] than ever before.
[1:14:30] And it's brought a a a confusion into
[1:14:32] the hearts of many because there's no
[1:14:34] truth left in the world. There's no
[1:14:36] truth left in government. There there's
[1:14:38] no truth left in our schools and and in
[1:14:40] our universities and and people are torn
[1:14:42] and searching. And I hear people say, "I
[1:14:45] just don't know what to believe
[1:14:47] anymore."
[1:14:49] I do.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; I do. Because in the midst of darkness,
[1:14:53] it has made this light shine brighter
[1:14:55] than ever before. It is confirmed to our
[1:14:58] hearts more than ever before how true
[1:15:00] this is. It's getting darker and darker
[1:15:02] and darker and it's making this shine
[1:15:04] brighter and brighter and brighter. I
[1:15:07] tell people all the time, you know, you
[1:15:09] you find people struggling with the
[1:15:10] message of the eye where and well, I I
[1:15:13] found this situation, so it's it's
[1:15:15] rocked my faith and and I found where he
[1:15:17] said something here, so it's made me
[1:15:18] fall away. And I can't understand that
[1:15:20] for myself because every single day we
[1:15:23] go along confirms to me more and more
[1:15:25] the truth of the prophet of Malachi 4.
[1:15:28] Every day I look and and I see situation
[1:15:30] I say, "Yep, he was right about that.
[1:15:32] Yep, right about that. Yep, right about
[1:15:33] that." And the darker it gets, the
[1:15:35] brighter the light shows and the more
[1:15:37] the truth stands out and I recognize we
[1:15:39] are not following cunningly devised
[1:15:41] fables. But this is a message from the
[1:15:43] throne of almighty God that is coming
[1:15:46] this day to make this word live. Did it
[1:15:48] rewrite the Bible? No. It brought this
[1:15:50] Bible to life. Amen. And it made us
[1:15:53] recognize we are not stumbling around in
[1:15:55] darkness. But the final say spoken this
[1:15:58] day. And he came and he put his amen
[1:16:00] behind the message of the hour. And we
[1:16:02] can stand in confidence today that the
[1:16:05] final say has spoken on our behalf.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:10] Stop listening to all the voices out
[1:16:12] there fighting for your attention. There
[1:16:14] is a vindicated voice in this day.
[1:16:17] return our minds today and our heart to
[1:16:19] the only thing that was ever worth
[1:16:22] believing.
[1:16:24] The only one whose plans have never
[1:16:26] failed, the amen of God,
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; the faithful and true witness.
[1:16:31] You know, the the evil of the age, it
[1:16:34] doesn't shake us.
[1:16:37] I spoke about that a little bit. How
[1:16:40] how that often times we see things in
[1:16:42] the word and then it turns out exactly
[1:16:44] like the word said and it and it shakes
[1:16:46] people. I'm not shaken by but it
[1:16:49] confirms to me what we're believing. It
[1:16:52] confirms to us. Yes, we're standing
[1:16:54] right on the precipice of the coming of
[1:16:56] the Lord. Yes, he is a a strong tower.
[1:16:59] Yeah. Yes, he is a rock of refuge. Yes.
[1:17:02] Thank you, Lord Jesus, that you
[1:17:03] forewarned us these things was coming.
[1:17:05] And it's just made the truth more clear
[1:17:08] and the light to shine more brighter.
[1:17:10] And I want to say again and hammer this
[1:17:12] home today because there's so many
[1:17:14] voices even as we sit in a service.
[1:17:18] Even as we sit here, so many thoughts,
[1:17:20] so many directions, so many things that
[1:17:22] fight for your attention. And there is
[1:17:24] only one voice of truth in this day.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Well, I can't find truth. will quit
[1:17:30] looking for it in the wrong places.
[1:17:33] Quit looking for it in in university or
[1:17:36] in Facebook stories.
[1:17:39] Hey, how many people how many people
[1:17:42] trust things because they talked to a
[1:17:45] guy at the store or my neighbor told me.
[1:17:48] Amen. We'll run with it, man. My
[1:17:50] neighbor told me. But we read a
[1:17:53] scripture from a vindicated word. We
[1:17:56] read a a scripture from one that cannot
[1:17:58] fail. the true and faithful witness. And
[1:18:00] we're like, "Yeah, but this is 2026."
[1:18:03] And you know, my doctor says,
[1:18:07] "Yeah, but you know, the the prophet
[1:18:09] said this was going to happen. Yeah, but
[1:18:11] my neighbor said that one time he
[1:18:12] heard."
[1:18:14] And we're so quick to listen to voices
[1:18:17] except for the one that we should be
[1:18:19] listening to
[1:18:21] because we've allowed all the voices of
[1:18:23] Leodysia to drown out the still small
[1:18:26] voice. We've allowed that to be clogged.
[1:18:28] And and I want to encourage you as as we
[1:18:30] enter deeper into 2026, reconnect with
[1:18:34] the still small voice. Reconnect with
[1:18:36] the uncction of the Holy Ghost.
[1:18:38] Reconnect with with being able to
[1:18:40] recognize that. Sometimes it's been so
[1:18:42] long since we've we've spoken and we've
[1:18:44] heard and we've listened that when he
[1:18:46] speaks, it's not that we don't hear,
[1:18:48] it's that we don't recognize who and
[1:18:50] what it is that's speaking to us.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Reconnect with that today. to quit
[1:18:55] looking for truth in the wrong places
[1:18:57] because the word is the voice of truth
[1:19:01] and we must make the word our absolute.
[1:19:04] Amen. He says he is the god of the amen.
[1:19:07] He never changes. What he does never
[1:19:10] changes. He says it, it stands fast. He
[1:19:13] does it, it is done forever. None can
[1:19:15] take from what he says or add to it. So
[1:19:18] let it be. Amen. So let it be.
[1:19:22] Now, let's compare that to Satan.
[1:19:25] Let's compare that to the one who tells
[1:19:27] you to quit. Compare it to the one who
[1:19:30] tells you that you can't make it. You
[1:19:32] can't get well. This message just
[1:19:34] doesn't it just isn't for you.
[1:19:37] John 8:44 describes him. Says, "He was a
[1:19:40] murderer from the beginning. He abodeed
[1:19:42] not in the truth because there's no
[1:19:44] truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he
[1:19:46] speaketh of his own, for he is a liar
[1:19:48] and the father of it." Compare the
[1:19:52] sources. One is faithful and one is true
[1:19:55] and one has never failed and one has
[1:19:57] never told a lie and the other is a liar
[1:20:00] and the father of lies. So let's quit
[1:20:02] lending our ear to the liar and to the
[1:20:05] father of lies. Do you know how to tell
[1:20:07] when the devil's lying to you? When his
[1:20:09] mouth is moving.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; If he's speaking, he's lying. The devil
[1:20:14] said that I ain't going to make it.
[1:20:15] Blessed be the name of the Lord. I must
[1:20:17] be on my way. The devil said I'm not a
[1:20:20] son of God. Hallelujah. I must be a
[1:20:23] child of God. Why is he after me so hard
[1:20:25] today, brother Aaron? That just means he
[1:20:28] don't have you yet.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; You want to get worried? Get worried
[1:20:32] when the devil backs off.
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; Get worried when you're not having
[1:20:36] trials. Get worried when everything's
[1:20:38] going perfect because that must mean he
[1:20:40] feels pretty comfortable with where he
[1:20:42] has you. But if he's after you today and
[1:20:44] he's telling you those things, just step
[1:20:46] back and rejoice and say, "Lord, just
[1:20:48] strengthen me because I know I'm in for
[1:20:50] a battle. But I know I'm yours. I know
[1:20:52] I'm called. I know I'm chosen. And what
[1:20:55] you say about me is the only thing that
[1:20:58] matters.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm going to put my trust in
[1:21:02] the faithful and true, not the ly
[1:21:05] murderer." That just seems to make good
[1:21:07] sense to me today.
[1:21:09] Jesus points us back to the beginning to
[1:21:12] what Satan always was
[1:21:15] in heaven. Satan became lifted up in
[1:21:18] himself and he begins to preach and he
[1:21:21] begins to deceive in heaven.
[1:21:24] Never give ear to the devil even for
[1:21:29] just a moment. But brother Aaron, I'm
[1:21:32] solid. I I I I can look at those things.
[1:21:36] I'm solid. You know, I you know, I I'm
[1:21:38] not afraid to to debate with with these
[1:21:42] people and look at their materials.
[1:21:45] I'm solid.
[1:21:47] Listen, I think the angels in heaven
[1:21:48] were probably pretty solid.
[1:21:52] But Satan was such a deceiver that he
[1:21:55] deceived a third of the angels in
[1:21:57] heaven.
[1:21:59] Don't listen.
[1:22:01] Don't give ear. Don't debate. Don't
[1:22:04] dwell on the questions and doubts that
[1:22:06] come into your mind. Don't dwell on the
[1:22:10] things that don't edify and strengthen
[1:22:12] you. Stay away from the poison of
[1:22:14] negativity. Don't be the mouthpiece of
[1:22:17] negativity. These things when they come
[1:22:19] into our mind, well, it's not a new
[1:22:21] battle. We we knew that these things
[1:22:23] were going to come because we were given
[1:22:24] instruction on exactly what to do when
[1:22:27] these things come into our mind. He
[1:22:28] said, "Cast down imagination.
[1:22:31] cast down anything that that would lift
[1:22:33] itself up against the word of God. Why?
[1:22:36] Because our own thoughts will begin to
[1:22:37] do that. Our own doubts and our own
[1:22:39] fears. And if we dwell there long
[1:22:41] enough, they take foothold.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; And if we dwell there long enough, you
[1:22:45] know, it it begins to put out roots in
[1:22:47] our heart. You know how it is. You see a
[1:22:49] little sapling, you can go pluck that
[1:22:51] thing up pretty easy. But come back the
[1:22:53] next year when the roots have gone deep,
[1:22:55] when it's really got a hold in something
[1:22:57] and try to pull that tree up. Now it's a
[1:22:59] little more difficult. now the next year
[1:23:01] and eventually it gets to the place
[1:23:03] where it's almost impossible to pull it
[1:23:05] out without destroying things around it.
[1:23:09] When those thoughts come into your life,
[1:23:11] deal with it. Then when issues rise up,
[1:23:14] when when little spirits try to settle
[1:23:16] in, negativity or lust or pride or
[1:23:19] whatever it may be, when you recognize
[1:23:21] it in that moment, deal with it then
[1:23:24] because you let it linger and you play
[1:23:26] with it and you toy with it and next
[1:23:28] thing you know it has an anchor down in
[1:23:30] your heart and maybe you can get it out.
[1:23:33] Maybe you can be rescued. But what gets
[1:23:36] destroyed in the process?
[1:23:38] Lot was pulled out of Sodom, but he lost
[1:23:40] his children in the process.
[1:23:45] &gt;&gt; Look at the pain and the scars. Yes, you
[1:23:47] may be pulled out, but what do you lose
[1:23:49] in the process?
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; Deal with issues in the moment. Deal
[1:23:55] with it today. Right then,
[1:23:57] Satan begins to ask questions and plant
[1:24:00] seeds of negativity in heaven. And soon,
[1:24:02] he's cast out with all those that listen
[1:24:05] to his lies.
[1:24:07] He says, "This great first battle that
[1:24:08] was ever fought began in heaven when
[1:24:11] Michael and his angels fought against
[1:24:12] Lucifer and his angels. It first
[1:24:15] started, the first battle was in heaven.
[1:24:18] So sin did not originate on earth. It
[1:24:20] originated in heaven. And then it was
[1:24:22] thrown down from heaven, cast out of
[1:24:24] heaven to the earth and it fell on human
[1:24:26] beings. Then the battle from angels
[1:24:29] become human battles and Satan come to
[1:24:31] destroy God's creation. What God had
[1:24:33] created to be for himself. Satan come to
[1:24:36] destroy this. That's what his purpose
[1:24:38] was was to destroy it. Then the battle
[1:24:41] began here on earth and it began in us
[1:24:44] and it's been raging ever since.
[1:24:48] So we see ca Satan is cast out of heaven
[1:24:51] and immediately he wants a way back in
[1:24:53] and and he begins to target man and
[1:24:56] man's position as a way to worm his way
[1:24:58] back into a position of authority. and
[1:25:01] he's scheming and he's looking for any
[1:25:03] weakness, any opportunity. And through
[1:25:05] the serpent, he begins to do the same
[1:25:07] thing that he did in heaven. He begins
[1:25:10] to preach. He begins to preach to Eve.
[1:25:14] And he begins to tell her things that
[1:25:15] peak her curiosity,
[1:25:17] things that slant the word just
[1:25:20] slightly,
[1:25:22] that just bend it just a little bit, and
[1:25:25] thoughts begin to linger that should
[1:25:26] have been cast down.
[1:25:29] We let those things linger too long,
[1:25:30] church.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; We let those thoughts linger too long. C
[1:25:35] can I can I be healed,
[1:25:38] but you know what? Maybe it's not for
[1:25:39] me. Maybe I'm not called to a rapture.
[1:25:42] You may maybe I'll just be a foolish
[1:25:44] virgin. Maybe I've gone too far.
[1:25:47] Maybe I've crossed the maybe my son's
[1:25:50] been out too long and maybe he's done
[1:25:52] too much. and and what if and maybe
[1:25:56] listen, cast those things down today.
[1:25:59] Return to the word. Your children are an
[1:26:02] inheritance. You've been called to
[1:26:05] salvation. You've been called to a
[1:26:07] rapture. He didn't call your name to
[1:26:09] leave you here. Brother Shawn Martin
[1:26:11] used to sing a song. He didn't bring us
[1:26:13] this far to leave us. He didn't teach
[1:26:16] you to swim to let you drown. He hasn't
[1:26:19] brought you out and called you to
[1:26:21] abandon you. You may be feeling
[1:26:22] abandoned today. You may be feeling like
[1:26:25] everything's against you. But he hasn't
[1:26:27] left you and he hasn't forsaken you. And
[1:26:29] I say you'll find him right where you
[1:26:31] walked away from him.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; He's still there with his arms open to
[1:26:36] forgive and to receive you. Come back to
[1:26:38] the word today. Cast down the doubts. By
[1:26:41] his stripes, I'm healed. I have a
[1:26:43] promise of the Holy Ghost. I have a
[1:26:45] promise of a body change. I have a
[1:26:47] promise for my children. And these
[1:26:49] promises, they weren't spoken by some
[1:26:51] wishy-washy person. They weren't spoken
[1:26:53] by man, but they were spoken by the I
[1:26:56] am. They were spoken by the true and the
[1:26:58] faithful witness. Amen.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; They are the final say on the matter.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; They are the final say, but thoughts
[1:27:08] contrary to the word will come and you
[1:27:10] have to take them. And it says, "Casting
[1:27:12] down imaginations and every high thing
[1:27:14] that exaltth itself against the
[1:27:16] knowledge of God, bringing into
[1:27:18] captivity
[1:27:20] every thought to the obedience of
[1:27:22] Christ."
[1:27:24] But see, Eve listened too long and she
[1:27:27] began to wonder. He says, "We know that
[1:27:29] Eve lost the battle because she relied
[1:27:31] upon her reasoning instead of her faith
[1:27:35] in God's word."
[1:27:37] And this must be a very important thing
[1:27:38] because he says, "Let's repeat that."
[1:27:42] She relied upon her reasonings instead
[1:27:45] of having faith in God's word. It
[1:27:47] reasoned out. Let me put that in other
[1:27:50] words. It made sense.
[1:27:53] What the serpent said made sense.
[1:27:56] It reasoned out. Therefore, she broke
[1:27:59] the front lines and the enemy rushed in
[1:28:01] and then death struck the world. Oh
[1:28:05] church, what a different situation we'd
[1:28:06] be in today if she'd have just stayed
[1:28:08] behind that word.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; If she would have just stayed true to
[1:28:11] the word. If she would have just trusted
[1:28:13] the word. If she would have relied on
[1:28:14] the word. If she would have counted it
[1:28:16] as the absolute, knowing that regardless
[1:28:19] of what you see and regardless of what
[1:28:21] your senses declare to you today, the
[1:28:23] word is still truth.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Even if this makes sense, this is truth.
[1:28:28] Even if there's facts stacked up right
[1:28:30] here, this is truth.
[1:28:33] It's always the truth. The word can be
[1:28:36] trusted. So, I'm just trying to tell you
[1:28:38] today, stay with the word.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; Stay with the truth. Stay with the word
[1:28:43] when things are good. Stay with the word
[1:28:45] when you feel like you're being
[1:28:46] overwhelmed. Stay with the word when
[1:28:48] you're struggling.
[1:28:51] Oh, there's a place many of us find
[1:28:52] ours, if we're honest, many of us find
[1:28:55] ourselves today in a place of struggle.
[1:28:58] Many of us find ourselves today in a
[1:28:59] place of battle. And the devil would
[1:29:02] love to get you in a place that the
[1:29:03] struggles here and the failures here get
[1:29:07] you so down on yourself and so down
[1:29:10] about where you fit in here and where
[1:29:12] you belong here that you lose sight of
[1:29:14] your place here.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; You lose sight of your place in the
[1:29:18] word. You lose sight of what you've been
[1:29:21] called to be. You lose sight of your
[1:29:23] place in him and your position in him.
[1:29:26] Who cares about your position in the
[1:29:28] church? Who cares about your position at
[1:29:31] the company? What is your place in him
[1:29:33] this morning?
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Don't lose sight of what you mean to the
[1:29:38] body of Christ.
[1:29:40] There's a place for you.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; It's a high and a holy place and it's an
[1:29:45] important place. It's been said before
[1:29:47] many times and I'll say it again. No one
[1:29:50] can take your place. Nobody brings to
[1:29:53] the table what you bring to the table.
[1:29:56] Nobody can play the part that you play.
[1:29:59] You are a piece of the puzzle. And we
[1:30:01] can't leave until the puzzle is
[1:30:03] complete.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; And I don't care if you're that perfect
[1:30:07] little corner piece or that jaggedy old
[1:30:10] wonky piece there in the middle that
[1:30:12] seems like a a kindergarter cut it up
[1:30:13] with scissors.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter. It's still a piece of
[1:30:18] the picture. And the picture don't make
[1:30:20] sense until every piece is put there. So
[1:30:22] if you'll just surrender yourself into
[1:30:25] the hand of the master and let him take
[1:30:27] that peace and place it where it's meant
[1:30:29] to be placed, then we'll have a perfect
[1:30:31] picture and then the rapture can come.
[1:30:34] Then we can go home. Then we'll overcome
[1:30:36] as a church body. When you say, "I just
[1:30:38] want to play my part." Whatever that is,
[1:30:41] Lord Jesus,
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Satan wants to keep you looking
[1:30:46] elsewhere.
[1:30:48] Keep you wanting to be a different piece
[1:30:50] of the puzzle.
[1:30:52] keep you wondering what and where your
[1:30:56] place is. And maybe for some you don't
[1:30:58] have a problem fitting in. Maybe some
[1:31:00] people fit in too easy.
[1:31:04] Maybe for some it's not failure. Maybe
[1:31:07] for some it's success that hinders.
[1:31:10] Maybe the career is too good. Maybe the
[1:31:13] pull to accomplish more here and to be
[1:31:15] somebody here keeps you out of your
[1:31:17] place in the body. But whatever it is,
[1:31:20] the enemy tries to steer you away from
[1:31:22] your place and your true calling, away
[1:31:25] from victory. Where does victory come,
[1:31:27] brother Aaron? How does victory come
[1:31:29] when when I'm doing this and I'm doing
[1:31:31] that and and I'm overcoming? Victory
[1:31:34] comes when we find our place and our
[1:31:36] peace and our success in him.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; That's where victory comes. When we find
[1:31:42] our our success and our place and our
[1:31:45] peace in him.
[1:31:47] Speaking of place, I I just read these
[1:31:48] quotes today and I don't have them, but
[1:31:50] the Lord laid it on my heart. And you
[1:31:51] know, many times we see somebody like a
[1:31:53] minister and we think, "Oh, wow." You
[1:31:55] know, he prayed for this one and they
[1:31:57] got well and he prayed for this one and
[1:31:58] this devil got cast out. What a
[1:32:00] ministry. What a place he had. And
[1:32:02] there's a quote where brother Brandham
[1:32:04] talks about it and he says, "And this
[1:32:05] minister prays for the sick and demons
[1:32:07] are cast out." And he says this, "And
[1:32:11] this sister fast and prays and it's the
[1:32:14] reason he can cast out demons.
[1:32:19] Which place is more important?
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Their place is no less important than my
[1:32:24] place.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; Your place is huge.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; This sister fast and prays and that's
[1:32:30] the reason he can cast out devils. I
[1:32:33] read that and I was just like, Lord,
[1:32:34] Lord, keep us humble
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; and yet by the same time make us aware
[1:32:38] how important we are,
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; that we're needed. You want to hinder a
[1:32:43] service, just don't pray for it.
[1:32:48] Brother Brown said, "The greatest thing
[1:32:49] you can do is pray for the meeting.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Your time's important. Your peace is
[1:32:55] important. You are huge to the kingdom
[1:32:58] of God." You got to come to the place
[1:33:00] you realize I'm a part of him. He cannot
[1:33:03] fail. His word cannot fail. I'm a part
[1:33:06] of that word. So, I'm not going to fail.
[1:33:09] And I'm happy and I am pleased and I'm
[1:33:11] proud to play whatever part the Lord
[1:33:14] asked me to play. What a mighty part it
[1:33:16] is. What a wonderful position I've been
[1:33:18] given. What a place you've been given in
[1:33:21] this day. Let's anchor right there our
[1:33:24] peace and our success and everything
[1:33:26] anchored in him in a word that cannot
[1:33:29] fail.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; But what the serpent said to Eve seemed
[1:33:33] reasonable.
[1:33:35] And she takes it in. And in so doing,
[1:33:38] all creation falls.
[1:33:41] And after the fall, says they heard the
[1:33:43] voice of the Lord God walking in the
[1:33:45] garden in the cool of the day. I think
[1:33:47] about this. Just the day before, this
[1:33:49] was a wonderful thing. They would have
[1:33:51] heard that voice and they would have ran
[1:33:52] to it.
[1:33:54] You remember what it was.
[1:33:56] You remember when things were right,
[1:33:58] when you had just given your heart to
[1:33:59] God, how excited you were for the church
[1:34:02] door to open and you ran to that. how
[1:34:05] excited you were to play a message, how
[1:34:08] excited you were for your prayer time.
[1:34:09] You ran to that. But then little things
[1:34:12] come in, little hindrances come in that
[1:34:15] that pull us away. And maybe a failure
[1:34:17] comes in that brings condemnation into
[1:34:19] our life and we hear the voice of the
[1:34:22] Lord God and Adam and his wife hid
[1:34:24] themselves from the presence of God.
[1:34:27] Where you been? I I just hadn't been
[1:34:28] able to make it for the last month.
[1:34:33] I you I've just had I've had some things
[1:34:34] come up and we start with excuses and
[1:34:37] what it is is we're hiding from that
[1:34:40] fellowship. We're hiding from facing the
[1:34:42] reality of it. And we begin to hide. And
[1:34:46] Adam and his wife hid themselves from
[1:34:47] the presence of the Lord God amongst the
[1:34:48] trees of the garden. And the Lord God
[1:34:50] called unto Adam and he said unto him,
[1:34:52] "Where art thou?" And this ain't even
[1:34:54] what my sermon's about, but I feel to go
[1:34:55] here for a minute. If you'll just read
[1:34:57] further on, he wasn't looking for him to
[1:34:59] judge him.
[1:35:00] He was looking for them so he could slay
[1:35:02] a lamb.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; He knew what the penalty was. Penalty
[1:35:05] was death. And he's trying to find them
[1:35:07] so that they don't have to come under
[1:35:08] that penalty. He said, "Adam, where are
[1:35:10] you?
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Adam, where are you?" He's not looking
[1:35:13] to judge them. He's not looking to slay
[1:35:15] them. He's got a lamb for them. And he
[1:35:17] wants to slay that lamb and he wants to
[1:35:19] wrap them in that bloody skin so that
[1:35:21] they can live. And yes, it's only a
[1:35:24] substitute. I understand that. But he's
[1:35:26] not calling out to you today. And he's
[1:35:28] not speaking to you to judge you. He
[1:35:29] says, "I got a lamb for you today. It's
[1:35:32] an eternal lamb. It's not a substitute.
[1:35:35] It's the lamb of God. And he's here to
[1:35:37] wipe away your sins. He's here to
[1:35:39] forgive you. He's here to heal you. He's
[1:35:41] here to save you. And he's crying out
[1:35:43] your name. Don't run from it today. But
[1:35:46] run to him with all your heart.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; He's calling out to you to save you
[1:35:51] today.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; He's got a lamb for you today.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; But they hide from his presence.
[1:35:58] fellowship's been broken. The very thing
[1:36:01] that they had longed for, now they run
[1:36:03] from.
[1:36:06] And as I said, Satan's plan seems to
[1:36:09] have worked.
[1:36:12] Man has fallen. Satan's plan being
[1:36:15] implemented. Sin nature's now going to
[1:36:17] reign.
[1:36:19] I can see Satan celebrating there in the
[1:36:21] garden, laughing,
[1:36:24] already planning his next move, reveling
[1:36:27] in what he perceives as a victory.
[1:36:30] That's okay.
[1:36:32] You know what? Maybe in carnal speak.
[1:36:37] Maybe he had a right to feel victorious
[1:36:38] in that moment.
[1:36:41] In the most perfect world, in the most
[1:36:43] perfect Eden, in a place created by God
[1:36:46] himself with God's children, I made them
[1:36:49] fall. They couldn't even stand in
[1:36:53] perfection.
[1:36:57] I can hear God say, "That's okay. you go
[1:37:00] ahead and have your laugh because I got
[1:37:02] a bride that in the most evil day, in
[1:37:05] the worst day, when you make it as bad
[1:37:07] as you can make it, and you do all that
[1:37:09] you can do, I got a bride that will not
[1:37:12] fall. I got a bride that's predestined
[1:37:14] to stand. I got a bride that's going to
[1:37:16] overcome you. When you think you've got
[1:37:18] it all wrapped up, when you think you've
[1:37:19] got it so evil, when you think the
[1:37:21] atmospheres are so clogged, there's no
[1:37:23] way a bride can come out of that. But in
[1:37:26] that Eden, in that day, at the end of
[1:37:28] the Leodysian age, there's going to be a
[1:37:30] people who stand and take a rapture
[1:37:33] because they would not fall. They would
[1:37:35] not bend. They would not bow. They would
[1:37:37] not look away from the word. But they
[1:37:39] say, "I'm going to stay with this
[1:37:41] because it is the final say. It is my
[1:37:43] everything. It is my all in all."
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Fellowship broken in the garden. No more
[1:37:53] fellowship, only death. And right there
[1:37:55] we learn something very important. No
[1:37:58] matter how bad it looks or how
[1:38:00] successful the devil may seem to be, he
[1:38:03] will never have the final say.
[1:38:07] Look at this. He says, "What's the
[1:38:09] matter? Something's happened. They can
[1:38:12] cry now. They're mortal now. They're
[1:38:16] dying now." My, it seemed like such a
[1:38:19] great victory for Satan. He says, "There
[1:38:22] you are. I can see God say, "Depart out
[1:38:26] of my presence." Ah, this is exactly
[1:38:28] what Satan wanted. Oh, this is going to
[1:38:31] perfect according to plan. He says, "I
[1:38:34] can see Adam start walking away." And as
[1:38:37] he did, I can hear something going.
[1:38:43] What is it? It's those old bloody sheep
[1:38:46] skins flopping against his leg as he's
[1:38:48] going out. Oh, I can see God who covers
[1:38:51] space and time. who is no beginning or
[1:38:53] ending. I can see it all bottled down
[1:38:55] like a funnel coming down like this for
[1:38:58] one four-lettered word L O V E. He
[1:39:04] couldn't see his children depart from
[1:39:06] him. Now why? He had made the covenant
[1:39:09] conditional with Adam, but now he makes
[1:39:11] it unconditional. He said, "I will put
[1:39:14] enmity between the woman's seed." And he
[1:39:17] said, "And would bruise the serpent's
[1:39:19] head and so forth, promising a savior."
[1:39:22] Oh, what's the big deal with that? The
[1:39:24] ah. Because now it's no longer up to
[1:39:26] man. Now it's no longer about your
[1:39:28] goodness. Now it's no longer about your
[1:39:30] failures and your lukewarmness and your
[1:39:32] ups and your downs and your ins and
[1:39:34] you're out. He said, "But I will come
[1:39:37] down. I will put enmity. I will bruise.
[1:39:40] I will restore. I will conquer." Oh,
[1:39:43] hallelujah. I'm so thankful it ain't
[1:39:44] about me and my goodness. Because if I
[1:39:46] got what I deserved, I would go straight
[1:39:48] to hell. But he said, "I'm going to come
[1:39:51] down." Hallelujah. The spotless lamb,
[1:39:54] the accepted sacrifice. I'm not good
[1:39:56] enough today, brother. I know you're
[1:39:58] not. Neither am I. But we've got a
[1:40:00] sacrifice. We've got a lamb. It's a
[1:40:03] perfect lamb and a perfect blood today.
[1:40:06] Hallelujah.
[1:40:08] I'm so thankful. He said, "I'm going to
[1:40:10] deal with it. I'll make the way." And
[1:40:13] because he said it, it's as good as
[1:40:15] done. It's a finished work. And right
[1:40:18] there, an innocent lamb is slain. Not
[1:40:21] only fulfilling the requirement for
[1:40:23] blood, but it's symbolizing what's to
[1:40:25] come. And in what seemed like Satan's
[1:40:28] greatest victory, God is foreshadowing
[1:40:32] his greatest defeat. Satan don't even
[1:40:34] know what he's watching. He's sitting
[1:40:37] here seeing it, not realizing it's being
[1:40:39] foreshadowed. This is going to crush
[1:40:42] your head. He had caused the fall, but
[1:40:46] there was one thing he couldn't
[1:40:47] understand. One thing he couldn't
[1:40:49] account for.
[1:40:52] L O V E.
[1:40:58] Think about that. He, oh, he's going to
[1:41:00] kill them now. It's over. It's finished.
[1:41:03] What's he doing?
[1:41:05] Why he destroying them? L O V E. And
[1:41:10] when you fall away, Satan goes, I got
[1:41:12] him now. And then God begins to draw you
[1:41:14] back. Says, what's he doing? He walked
[1:41:18] away from you, God. What are you doing?
[1:41:20] Satan can't understand. L O V E. Why
[1:41:24] does he call you back every time you
[1:41:26] fail? Why do you come into his presence
[1:41:28] and feel drawn by him over and over and
[1:41:30] over again? L O V E. He loves you today.
[1:41:36] Oh, but I'm a failure. He loves you
[1:41:37] today. I I I've I failed him so many
[1:41:40] times and he still loves you today.
[1:41:42] Surely not me. Listen, he knew every
[1:41:44] time you fall. He knew every time you
[1:41:46] fail. He knew when you'd backslide. He
[1:41:48] knew when you'd run. He knew when you'd
[1:41:50] sin. He knew everything you'd do. And he
[1:41:52] looked at you and said, "Yep, I choose
[1:41:54] you. You're the one I love. You're the
[1:41:56] one that's part of me. And I'm coming to
[1:41:58] save you and set you free. You may fail
[1:42:01] me. You may disappoint me. You may hurt
[1:42:02] me. But I love you and I choose you and
[1:42:06] I'm going to shed my blood for you.
[1:42:08] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you for
[1:42:11] that love.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; And he couldn't stand to see his
[1:42:15] children go.
[1:42:17] That's what he feels for you today. L O
[1:42:21] V E. And because of that, Satan will
[1:42:23] never have the final say in your life.
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; He will never have the final say. I tell
[1:42:30] you what, people can say what they want
[1:42:32] about my kids. They can judge my kids.
[1:42:34] They can think what should happen to my
[1:42:36] kids. And they have no say in how I
[1:42:38] decide to treat my kids.
[1:42:40] &gt;&gt; They're my children. So, Satan can howl,
[1:42:43] he can bluff, he can yell, he can point,
[1:42:45] he can say what he wants, and he gets
[1:42:46] zero say in what happens to you. You're
[1:42:48] not a child of the devil. You've never
[1:42:50] been a child of the devil. You never did
[1:42:52] belong to the devil. You've always been
[1:42:55] a child of God. You've always been a
[1:42:57] child of God. Oh, I was lost. I know.
[1:43:00] How could you be lost? And yes, unless
[1:43:01] you belonged to him in the beginning.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:06] Brother Tim likes to tell a little story
[1:43:07] about a boy in a sailboat. He may have
[1:43:10] told it here. I don't know. He says,
[1:43:12] "Little boy made a sailboat.
[1:43:15] He spent so much time on it. He carved
[1:43:17] it. And he spent hours and days, even
[1:43:19] weeks, making it so exactly how he
[1:43:21] wanted. And he got so much joy out of
[1:43:23] that sailboat,
[1:43:25] watching it sail up and down the shore.
[1:43:28] But one day a a wind came, an unexpected
[1:43:31] wind, and blew the little boat off
[1:43:32] course. Happens in life from time to
[1:43:35] time, doesn't it? Unexpected things blow
[1:43:38] us off course. He was so sad, but he
[1:43:41] wouldn't give up. And he looked every
[1:43:43] day. He'd go down to the beach and he'd
[1:43:44] walk up and down looking for a sailboat.
[1:43:47] I put so much into it. I invested so
[1:43:49] much. It's my sailboat. I love it. And
[1:43:51] then one day he was walking back from
[1:43:53] the beach and he's walking down through
[1:43:54] town. He looked in the window of a pawn
[1:43:56] shop and there was his little sailboat.
[1:44:00] They were asking way too much for that
[1:44:01] sailboat. There was an exorbitant price
[1:44:04] placed on it, but he said, "It don't
[1:44:05] matter. That's my sailboat." And I'm
[1:44:07] going to get it back. And he runs home
[1:44:08] and he and he he he takes all the
[1:44:10] savings he has, everything he little has
[1:44:12] in his piggy bank. And he takes it back
[1:44:14] and he pays the price for the sailboat.
[1:44:16] And he walks out and as he's walking
[1:44:18] down the street, he's clutching it to
[1:44:19] himself. And he's overheard to say,
[1:44:21] "Say, little sailboat, you're mine.
[1:44:24] You're mine twice because you were mine
[1:44:26] when I made you and now you're mine when
[1:44:29] I bought you. Hallelujah. Satan may have
[1:44:31] had you in the pawn shop. He may have
[1:44:33] brought you down in a pawn shop of sin
[1:44:35] and covered you up with sin and smut and
[1:44:38] scars and things of this life. But God
[1:44:40] says you are mine and you were mine
[1:44:42] twice. You were mine when I made you.
[1:44:44] And you were mine when I bought you. And
[1:44:46] you are mine eternally. I paid the
[1:44:48] price. I didn't care how high the price
[1:44:50] was. I shed my blood for you. Oh, that's
[1:44:54] the devil come says you're worthless.
[1:44:56] You're a nobody. You are worth so much
[1:44:58] that the greatest price ever paid in the
[1:45:01] history of man was paid for your life.
[1:45:04] He loves you today. Oh, I'm still lost.
[1:45:07] He's still seeking.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; The wind still got me. It's okay. He's
[1:45:12] paid the price for you today. He has the
[1:45:15] final say in your life. He says, "I will
[1:45:19] restore. I will bring you back home. I
[1:45:22] will come down. Satan is not going to
[1:45:24] get away with this.
[1:45:27] And when God says something, it's an
[1:45:28] absolute. He says an absolute. It's used
[1:45:32] many times. It's the last word. It's the
[1:45:34] amen. You hear people say absolutely.
[1:45:36] That's it. That's the last thing. It's
[1:45:38] unlimited. There's nothing else in its
[1:45:41] way. It's the supreme. It's an ultimate.
[1:45:43] And an ultimate is primarily an ultimate
[1:45:45] because you've reached the end. It's the
[1:45:48] amen. That's all. That's what he is. The
[1:45:52] amen. See, he's got the last word to
[1:45:56] say. Aren't you glad today that you have
[1:46:00] a God that you can trust?
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; The same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:46:04] Aren't you glad it's not up to fickle
[1:46:06] men? Men who can put you in, men who can
[1:46:10] put you out, men who can change their
[1:46:12] mind about you. But whatever God thought
[1:46:15] about you before the foundation of the
[1:46:16] world, he can never change that thought
[1:46:18] about you. If you were his then nothing
[1:46:21] happens in between there and here. I'm
[1:46:23] sure I've told this story. I tell it a
[1:46:24] lot of places, but my daughter loves to
[1:46:26] read the back of the book. I saw her
[1:46:28] just do it the other day. She bought a
[1:46:29] new book and the first thing she did,
[1:46:31] she sat down and she read the last
[1:46:32] chapter. And I said, "That annoys me so
[1:46:35] bad." I said, "That annoys me so why
[1:46:38] would you do that?" She goes, "Well,
[1:46:40] once I know how it ends, nothing else in
[1:46:42] here matters. It's just drama, Dad.
[1:46:45] It's just drama. I'm settled." I said,
[1:46:48] "Oh, Jesus,
[1:46:50] you know how it ends.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; You know how it ends. No, sir.
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; This is all just drama. I know how it
[1:46:58] turns out. It's okay. We win. The the
[1:47:00] the bridegroom gets his bride. We go to
[1:47:03] an eternal heaven. The devil does not
[1:47:06] win. He can spew and he can blow and he
[1:47:08] can do what he does, but it's already
[1:47:11] written by the thus sayeth the Lord."
[1:47:13] The amen, the absolute.
[1:47:16] I tell you what, let me put it in a
[1:47:18] little bit more carnal way. When I was
[1:47:20] out in the world, I used to watch what
[1:47:23] they call in the US wrestling. I don't
[1:47:25] know if they show that nonsense up here,
[1:47:26] the fake stuff, right? It's all
[1:47:29] scripted.
[1:47:30] These big bulking athletes walk up there
[1:47:32] and they they fight each other and they
[1:47:34] hit each other and all this. But they
[1:47:36] knew before they walked out how the
[1:47:38] match was going to end. It's all in the
[1:47:41] contract. They write a contract. and he
[1:47:45] comes out there and your hero gets hit
[1:47:47] with a chair. They throw him out the
[1:47:49] ring. They smash stuff over him and none
[1:47:52] of it matters.
[1:47:54] You may be getting hit with chairs
[1:47:56] today. The devil may be throwing
[1:47:58] haymakers that are landing and knocking
[1:48:00] you down and knocking you down and it
[1:48:02] seems worse than ever, but there's
[1:48:04] already a contract written. The match is
[1:48:06] already sealed. You're the winner.
[1:48:08] You're the overcome. You're going to be
[1:48:10] crowned the champion at the end of this
[1:48:12] thing. It doesn't matter what it looks
[1:48:14] like in round one, round two, round
[1:48:16] three, round four, round five, round
[1:48:19] six. We've reached the seventh round.
[1:48:21] It's the championship rounds. And now
[1:48:23] you're going to come out victorious cuz
[1:48:26] it's written in the contract today.
[1:48:28] You're going to overcome. You're going
[1:48:30] to win. You're going to possess it all.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; You think he's worried about you
[1:48:35] winning? He said, "I go to prepare a
[1:48:37] place for
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; I go to prepare a place for you, you,
[1:48:43] you, you, you, you, you, you, you you
[1:48:45] you, all of you. He's not worried about
[1:48:47] you coming. He's so sure that he's gone
[1:48:49] and prepared the place. He's hung the
[1:48:51] gates. The angels are standing
[1:48:52] breathlessly awaiting your arrival. He
[1:48:55] knows you're coming. And it's time you
[1:48:57] know you're coming.
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Not only does he have the final say, he
[1:49:06] is the final say. He is the amen. I put
[1:49:10] my trust right there. He's the beginning
[1:49:13] and the end. He knows me. He knows my
[1:49:16] needs. I don't have to operate today on
[1:49:18] whatifs and maybe so and worries and
[1:49:20] fears. I'm resting that God has the
[1:49:24] final say. Lord, I just want to rest in
[1:49:27] you today. And one thing we have to do
[1:49:30] is we have to learn to we have to learn
[1:49:32] to let the word work.
[1:49:34] Give it opportunity.
[1:49:37] No, God's not a god of time, but we are
[1:49:38] beings of time and we live in time. So,
[1:49:40] I'll say it like this. Give the word a
[1:49:42] space of time to operate.
[1:49:45] So many times we back off because it's
[1:49:47] taken too long. Taking too long for who?
[1:49:56] These promises are eternal.
[1:49:58] We don't back off because nothing
[1:50:00] changed today, nothing changed this
[1:50:02] week, nothing changed this year. But if
[1:50:06] the promise was given, stand on it.
[1:50:08] Anchor on it. Brother Brandon would use
[1:50:10] the analogy of the 25 cents for a loaf
[1:50:13] of bread.
[1:50:14] We're going to have to adjust that story
[1:50:16] due to horrible inflation.
[1:50:19] But he would talk about the 25 cents for
[1:50:20] a loaf of bread.
[1:50:23] And the thought is if you have the
[1:50:24] purchase price for the bread already in
[1:50:27] your hands, then you can be rejoicing in
[1:50:30] knowing that you're going to get it. And
[1:50:33] he says, "You may go through a lot on
[1:50:34] the way to get it. You may have trials
[1:50:36] and heartaches and all kinds of trouble.
[1:50:38] But if you have faith that the price is
[1:50:40] paid,"
[1:50:42] look how he puts it. He says, "Now going
[1:50:44] to get this loaf of bread, I might have
[1:50:46] to go over brier patches, down over
[1:50:48] bridges, cross streams, up the hill, but
[1:50:51] all the time I'm going." Oh, hallelujah.
[1:50:53] All the time we're progressing. I'll be
[1:50:56] shouting with all my heart, holding up
[1:50:58] my 25 cents. What is it? That's the
[1:51:00] promise. I'm holding up the promise. I'm
[1:51:03] holding up the word because I'm on my
[1:51:05] road for the bread. And if Christ
[1:51:07] reveals to me tonight that I'm healed, I
[1:51:09] can rejoice just as much as I could jump
[1:51:12] up and down on the floor. No matter
[1:51:14] whether I'm still crippled, whether I'm
[1:51:15] still sick, my head still hurts. What
[1:51:18] about it? I'm just as happy cuz I'm on
[1:51:20] my way with the purchase power. He has
[1:51:24] the final say. So once it's spoken, it's
[1:51:26] settled. By my stripes, you're healed.
[1:51:29] It's settled. I'm walking in that. I'm
[1:51:31] rejoicing in that. I will stand against
[1:51:33] the enemy on that right there and
[1:51:35] rejoice because I've got the purchase
[1:51:37] power.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; Jesus is on the way. Don't back off.
[1:51:42] Anchor down. Negative report, anchor
[1:51:45] down. Satan's closing in. Anchor down.
[1:51:48] The world all around us is falling
[1:51:50] apart. Anchor down.
[1:51:53] We can't let a negative report
[1:51:56] cause you to back off and think about
[1:51:58] it. Well, what if I want to use an
[1:52:01] example from the scriptures?
[1:52:04] It's the healing of Gyrus's daughter.
[1:52:08] Says, "And when Jesus was passed over
[1:52:09] again by ship unto the other side, much
[1:52:12] people gathered unto him, and he was
[1:52:15] nigh unto the sea. And behold, there
[1:52:18] cometh one of the rulers of the
[1:52:19] synagogue, Gyrus, by name. And when he
[1:52:21] saw him, he fell at his feet. And he
[1:52:24] besought him greatly, saying, My little
[1:52:26] daughter lith at the point of death. I
[1:52:28] pray thee, come and lay thy hands on
[1:52:30] her, that she may be healed, and she
[1:52:33] shall live." And Jesus went with him,
[1:52:36] and much people followed him, and
[1:52:38] thronged him. I'm going to skip down to
[1:52:40] verse 31. In between here in verse 31,
[1:52:43] we know the woman with the blood issue
[1:52:44] pushes through the crowd, and she comes
[1:52:47] up and she touches him. And I've always
[1:52:48] loved that story. And I'm not going to
[1:52:49] stay there long, but just to mention, if
[1:52:52] you read this, you recognize this is
[1:52:54] Gyrus's story.
[1:52:57] This isn't even that woman's story. It's
[1:53:00] not even her service.
[1:53:03] This is Gyrus's service.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; And the Lord is walking with Gyrus, and
[1:53:10] he's going to Gyrus's house. He's coming
[1:53:13] to Gyrus's need. He's coming to deal
[1:53:16] right here.
[1:53:18] But the little sister said, "I'm not
[1:53:19] going to let him pass me by."
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; So many times we sit there and we see
[1:53:24] this brother being blessed and oh my,
[1:53:25] he's being blessed. Hey, that's great. I
[1:53:27] rejoice in their blessing, too. But in
[1:53:29] that moment, reach out and touch the
[1:53:30] Lord.
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; Reach out for your situation.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; Sometimes he makes as if he's going to
[1:53:35] go a little further. What was it on the
[1:53:37] road to Emmas? It said he made as if he
[1:53:39] would go on,
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; but they compelled him, "Come in." They
[1:53:45] said, "Lord, come to my pew right now. I
[1:53:47] know you're dealing over here, but will
[1:53:48] you come to my pew for a moment? I know
[1:53:50] you're going to Gyrus's house, but I got
[1:53:52] an issue today. I got an issue that
[1:53:54] needs dealt with and compel him to come
[1:53:56] to your need. Our God's a big God. He
[1:53:59] can handle more than one thing at once.
[1:54:02] So, he's on the way to Gyrus's house and
[1:54:04] the woman comes behind him and it says
[1:54:07] here
[1:54:10] says, you know, she had touched him and
[1:54:11] he said, "Who touched me?" And his
[1:54:12] disciples said unto him, "Thou seeestest
[1:54:14] the multitude thronging thee, and sayest
[1:54:16] thou, who touch me?" And he looked
[1:54:18] around about to see to see her that had
[1:54:20] done this thing. But the woman, fearing
[1:54:21] and trembling, knowing what was done in
[1:54:23] her, came and fell down before him, told
[1:54:25] him all the truth, and he said unto her,
[1:54:27] "Daughter, thy faith made thee whole. Go
[1:54:30] in peace, and be whole of thy plague." I
[1:54:33] want you to notice something. God works
[1:54:35] everything out.
[1:54:37] Jesus didn't walk past her on accident.
[1:54:42] He didn't go down that specific street
[1:54:44] on accident. He knew what was going to
[1:54:47] happen and it served a dual purpose.
[1:54:51] Yes, she received her healing. Yes, what
[1:54:53] a testimony of faith we can all get out
[1:54:55] of it, but it served a purpose because
[1:54:58] he knew what was about to happen to
[1:55:00] Gyrus.
[1:55:02] And what this just did was allow Gyrus
[1:55:04] to see a miracle for himself
[1:55:07] and witness a miracle for himself.
[1:55:09] Because as soon as he says this, go in
[1:55:12] peace. You're healed. The miracle is
[1:55:13] yours. Behold of thy plague. And while
[1:55:16] he yet spake, there came from the ruler
[1:55:17] of the synagogue's house certain men
[1:55:19] which said, "Thou daughter is dead."
[1:55:22] In the midst of this miracle, in the
[1:55:25] midst of this, they're on their way, and
[1:55:26] they say, "Your daughter's dead.
[1:55:30] Why troublest thou the master any
[1:55:31] further?"
[1:55:33] Just let it go. Quit claiming that
[1:55:36] healing. Why? Why are you still
[1:55:38] troubling the master? That situation's
[1:55:41] over. Your daughter's dead. It's too
[1:55:44] late for you. He healed others, but
[1:55:47] we're just too late. This is This
[1:55:49] woman's miracle is the only one that's
[1:55:50] going to happen today. You tried, but
[1:55:53] your opportunities passed you by. You
[1:55:55] failed too many times. You've crossed
[1:55:57] the line. I want you to notice before
[1:56:00] Gyrus even has an opportunity to speak
[1:56:02] and respond, the Lord's not going to let
[1:56:03] his faith waver.
[1:56:06] says, "As soon as Jesus heard the word
[1:56:09] that was spoken, he says unto the ruler
[1:56:11] of the synagogue, be not afraid.
[1:56:14] Only believe."
[1:56:17] &gt;&gt; Because you can imagine what that report
[1:56:19] was like.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; You can imagine, some of you know,
[1:56:22] you've sat in doctor's offices and
[1:56:24] you've received those reports. You've
[1:56:26] received what would be a death sentence.
[1:56:28] You've received things that would be a
[1:56:29] struggle. And I pray the next time you
[1:56:31] face that, you can hear the voice of God
[1:56:33] whisper, "Be not afraid.
[1:56:36] Only believe.
[1:56:38] &gt;&gt; Only believe.
[1:56:41] &gt;&gt; Says, "And he suffered no man to follow
[1:56:43] him, save Peter and James, and John the
[1:56:45] brother of James. And he cometh to the
[1:56:47] house of the ruler of the synagogue. He
[1:56:48] seeth the tomo and them that wept and
[1:56:51] welled greatly." Notice those people had
[1:56:53] already given in to the testimony of
[1:56:55] negativity.
[1:56:56] But he's telling this man, "Don't you
[1:56:58] cave to this. You stand strong. You saw
[1:57:00] what just happened to the woman back
[1:57:02] there. You saw what I just did back
[1:57:04] there.
[1:57:05] And when he was come in, he saith unto
[1:57:07] him, Why make you this a do and weep?
[1:57:09] The damsel is not dead, but sleepeth.
[1:57:12] And they laughed him to scorn. But when
[1:57:14] he had put them all out, I like that it
[1:57:17] says it so gently
[1:57:20] so calmly. But I feel like in that
[1:57:22] moment Jesus handled business.
[1:57:26] He put them out. And we put them all
[1:57:29] out. He taketh the father and the mother
[1:57:32] of the damsel, and them that were with
[1:57:33] him, and enterth in where the damsel was
[1:57:35] lying. And he took the damsel by the
[1:57:37] hand. And he said unto her, Talithkuma,
[1:57:40] which is being interpreted, damsel, I
[1:57:42] say unto thee, arise. And straightway
[1:57:46] the damsel arose and walked, for she was
[1:57:48] at the age of 12 years old. And they
[1:57:50] were astonished with great astonishment.
[1:57:53] You don't have to back off your promise.
[1:57:56] I don't care what report came today or
[1:57:58] yesterday. He does not have the final
[1:58:00] say. But Jesus is on the way to your
[1:58:03] house today. Jesus is on the way to your
[1:58:05] situation. And as he's coming, there's
[1:58:07] reasons to back off. There's reasons to
[1:58:09] doubt. There's reasons to say, "I'm not
[1:58:11] going to trouble you anymore." But
[1:58:12] listen, no matter what those reasons are
[1:58:15] and what those voices say, they are not
[1:58:17] the final say, but the final say is
[1:58:20] walking down that path today. The final
[1:58:22] say is going to put out the doubters.
[1:58:23] He's going to push out the fear, push
[1:58:25] back the anxiety, and he's going to come
[1:58:27] and speak. And he's going to say, "Arise
[1:58:29] out of that depression. Arise out of
[1:58:31] that anxiety. Arise out of that
[1:58:33] sickness. Rise up out of your
[1:58:34] lukewarmness. Rise up out of your
[1:58:36] failures and live today because I have
[1:58:39] spoken life into your situation.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Don't back off now. Don't quit now. The
[1:58:49] amen is moving on your behalf.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; When Jesus is moving, don't turn him
[1:58:54] around. Don't stop him. Let him speak.
[1:58:58] He gave the promise and he will back it
[1:59:00] up.
[1:59:03] Amen. We got to let the word work. Let
[1:59:06] it do what it said it'll do. I don't
[1:59:09] care what the devil says or what the
[1:59:11] unbeliever says. The word said he heals.
[1:59:13] The word said he saves. The word said he
[1:59:15] delivers. The word said these signs
[1:59:17] shall follow them that believe.
[1:59:20] In my name they shall cast out devils.
[1:59:22] The word said they shall lay hands on
[1:59:24] the sick and they shall recover. And
[1:59:26] people can have their opinions. That's
[1:59:27] fine. People can deny these things.
[1:59:29] That's fine. They can speak what they
[1:59:30] want to speak. But the word said we
[1:59:32] would have it. And that's the final say
[1:59:34] on the matter. That's the final say on
[1:59:37] the matter. Brother Brown tells us Jesus
[1:59:39] plainly stated what a Christian was.
[1:59:40] See, these signs shall follow them that
[1:59:42] believe. See what they would do, what
[1:59:45] the believing church would do. And him
[1:59:47] being God and infinite. He said,
[1:59:48] "Heavens and earth will pass away, but
[1:59:50] my word will never fail." So it must
[1:59:53] ever remain that way he said it. I
[1:59:58] believe it.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; He says upon such a word as that I
[2:00:01] wonder this afternoon our listeners how
[2:00:03] we can be so petty then
[2:00:07] so dilatory about reaching out taking a
[2:00:10] hold of the promises of God when he gave
[2:00:12] this blessed promise to his church. I'll
[2:00:14] be with you even in you to the end of
[2:00:16] the age. And then we sit along as if God
[2:00:18] never said it. Whatever you bind on
[2:00:21] earth, I'll bind in heaven. What you
[2:00:23] loose on earth, I'll loose in heaven.
[2:00:24] Whether it's sickness, whether it's
[2:00:25] diseases, whether it's whatever it is,
[2:00:27] God gave this blessed promise. And it's
[2:00:29] our privilege.
[2:00:31] It's our privilege to pick up this
[2:00:33] promise and use it. It's time that we
[2:00:36] raise up to the challenge today.
[2:00:38] Challenge of the enemy. Cast down every
[2:00:40] high thing and take advantage of our
[2:00:42] privilege. This isn't a burden. This
[2:00:44] isn't, "Well, I guess I got to believe
[2:00:46] this." No. What a privilege we have in
[2:00:48] this day as a sons and daughters to God
[2:00:50] of God to know he's a living God. He's a
[2:00:53] healing God. He's a saving God. His
[2:00:55] blood still works today. His stripes
[2:00:57] still work today. Hallelujah. It still
[2:00:59] reaches to the highest mountain. It
[2:01:01] still reaches to the lowest valley.
[2:01:03] It'll reach you wherever you're at
[2:01:04] today. What a privilege we have today.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; His word, the final say.
[2:01:15] Of course, Satan's going to contradict
[2:01:17] the word. We begin to turn this now.
[2:01:21] Of course, Satan's going to have his
[2:01:23] say.
[2:01:24] Of course, he's going to try to bring
[2:01:26] fear, try to bring doubt, he's going to
[2:01:28] question everything you believe.
[2:01:33] And as long as you fear his boast, he's
[2:01:36] going to keep you from your possession.
[2:01:40] And we sure can't go around agreeing
[2:01:41] with him. Come on, let's deal with that
[2:01:43] for a minute.
[2:01:44] You're no good. You're right. I'm no
[2:01:46] good.
[2:01:48] You're a failure. Oh, God. I'm such a
[2:01:50] failure. Who Who are we speaking for?
[2:01:53] You can't overcome. I just can't
[2:01:55] overcome.
[2:01:57] And we just echo what the devil says.
[2:01:59] Quit doing his work for him.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Quit digging up your own past.
[2:02:05] Quit loading his gun and wonder why he's
[2:02:07] shooting you.
[2:02:10] It reminds me in history
[2:02:12] there was this famous naval battle in
[2:02:14] the great northern war between Denmark,
[2:02:16] Norway and the Swedish Empire. And and
[2:02:19] there was a very famous admiral. His
[2:02:21] name was Peter Johnson Wessel.
[2:02:23] Very famous Norwegian admiral who was
[2:02:25] dueling with this Swedish warship. And
[2:02:27] they fought for 14 hours just firing
[2:02:30] back and forth and destroying each
[2:02:33] other's ship, but they were still
[2:02:34] managing to stay afloat. And eventually,
[2:02:36] Admiral Wessel runs out of ammunition
[2:02:39] and he goes to his quarters and he
[2:02:41] writes this very nice letter. Not a
[2:02:44] letter of surrender, mind you, but a
[2:02:46] letter commending the other admiral on a
[2:02:48] job well done. What a fine duel we've
[2:02:50] had this day. And such is that nonsense.
[2:02:53] And he says, "I'm requesting that you
[2:02:54] will loan me some ammunition so that we
[2:02:56] may continue this duel."
[2:03:02] They said no.
[2:03:06] Quit giving the devil ammunition.
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; Quit telling him about your failures and
[2:03:11] telling him you're a failure and telling
[2:03:12] him this and telling him that. It's time
[2:03:14] instead of giving him ammunition, we
[2:03:16] just keep firing at him. We just keep
[2:03:18] firing. I'm the Lord thy God that health
[2:03:20] thee. He's the same yesterday, today,
[2:03:22] and forever. By his stripes, I'm healed.
[2:03:24] The promise is unto me, and to my
[2:03:26] children. To many as there are far off.
[2:03:27] To him that overcomemeth will I grant.
[2:03:29] Just keep launching rockets. Keep firing
[2:03:31] lot rockets. And eventually he's going
[2:03:33] to say, "Give me something so I can
[2:03:36] fight back." And our answer is going to
[2:03:37] be just like the Swedes. No, we fought
[2:03:40] to win. We don't fight for the sake of
[2:03:43] fighting. So many people enjoy the
[2:03:45] fight. I don't enjoy the fight. I enjoy
[2:03:47] the victory. I want to run the devil off
[2:03:50] my promises today. I want to push him
[2:03:52] back. Quit wallering in your defeat.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; Quit wallering in your defeats. Don't
[2:04:00] give the devil ammunition. Just take him
[2:04:02] back to the word like Jesus did. It is
[2:04:04] written. It is written. And this word
[2:04:07] will defeat Satan anywhere, anytime,
[2:04:09] under any circumstances.
[2:04:11] Because the enemy will rob you. He will
[2:04:14] rob your family. He will rob your
[2:04:15] church. He'll take your peace and your
[2:04:18] joy and your health if you allow his
[2:04:20] word to be the final say in your life.
[2:04:23] Israel kept allowing Goliath to have the
[2:04:25] final say. But one day, David heard it.
[2:04:28] I love how Brother Brown describes it.
[2:04:30] He says, "One day there was a new set of
[2:04:32] ears in the camp. Maybe you can hear
[2:04:35] today with a new set of ears.
[2:04:38] Lord, give me ears to hear. Not what the
[2:04:41] devil's saying, not what the world's
[2:04:42] saying. Lord, what are you saying to me
[2:04:43] today? I want to hear today with a new
[2:04:45] set of ears." David said, "I I got
[2:04:48] something to say to this fella." Listen,
[2:04:50] it's okay to answer the challenge. It's
[2:04:53] okay to speak back to the devil as long
[2:04:56] as you do it like Jesus did with the
[2:04:57] word, not with reasoning. It's okay to
[2:05:00] tell him it is written. It is written.
[2:05:02] It is written. Don't just accept what
[2:05:04] the enemy tells you is truth. Take him
[2:05:07] back to the word. So David takes him
[2:05:08] back to the word. So then the
[2:05:11] Philistines said, "I defy the armies of
[2:05:13] Israel this day. Give me a man that we
[2:05:15] may fight together." When when Saul and
[2:05:18] all the Israel heard these words of the
[2:05:19] Philistine, they were dismayed and
[2:05:21] greatly afraid. Why were they so afraid?
[2:05:24] They have a promise. The word had told
[2:05:26] him, "I'll be your shield. I I'll be
[2:05:28] your exceeding great reward. It told
[2:05:31] them to conquer the land. Told them to
[2:05:33] drive out the enemy. They had a promise,
[2:05:35] but they let Goliath's voice be the
[2:05:38] final say. They believed they couldn't
[2:05:40] be healed. They believe they couldn't
[2:05:41] have the Holy Ghost. They became
[2:05:43] stagnant. They were no longer Mark 16 in
[2:05:45] action. And he tries to bluff David the
[2:05:48] same way as he did the others. Says,
[2:05:50] "Then said David to the Philistine, thou
[2:05:52] comest to me with a sword, with a spear,
[2:05:54] with a shield, but I come to thee in the
[2:05:55] name of the Lord of Hosts. Can we come
[2:05:57] against him that way today? You're not
[2:05:59] coming in my name or because of this
[2:06:01] church or because anything else. We're
[2:06:02] coming in the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:06:04] Christ. He says, "The God of the armies
[2:06:07] of Israel, who thou hast defied. This
[2:06:09] day will the Lord deliver thee into my
[2:06:11] hand, and I will smite thee and take thy
[2:06:13] head from thee, and I will give the
[2:06:14] carcasses of the host of the Philistines
[2:06:16] this day unto the fowls of the air, and
[2:06:19] to the wild beasts of the earth, and
[2:06:21] that all that the earth may know that
[2:06:22] there is a God in Israel. and all this
[2:06:24] assembly shall know that the Lord saveth
[2:06:26] not with the sword and spear for the
[2:06:28] battle is the Lord's and he will give it
[2:06:30] into our hands. I like to think that
[2:06:33] Goliath was actually quite shocked.
[2:06:36] I doubt anybody had said these things to
[2:06:38] him before. I doubt anybody had stared
[2:06:41] him in the face and said, "This is how
[2:06:43] it's going to be."
[2:06:45] That's time you shock that devil that's
[2:06:46] tormenting you. He bluffs and he bluffs
[2:06:48] and he runs your house and he stir
[2:06:50] things up and we take it and we hide in
[2:06:52] the tent.
[2:06:53] Do you know how shocked the devil would
[2:06:55] be today if you walked into that valley
[2:06:57] and you said, "No more, but on this day,
[2:07:00] my family's going to see there's a God
[2:07:02] in Israel. On this day, I'm going to
[2:07:04] face the giant that's been running me
[2:07:06] around and cowing me down. You know what
[2:07:08] good it would do your children, what
[2:07:10] good it would do your spouse to see you
[2:07:11] square your shoulders back and look the
[2:07:13] enemy in the face and say, "This is the
[2:07:15] day I take your head off. This is the
[2:07:18] day the torment ends. This is the day
[2:07:20] the lukewarm ends. This is the day that
[2:07:23] it all comes in peace and order and
[2:07:25] harmony according to the word of God.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; David says, "You think you have the
[2:07:31] final say? You think you can scare me
[2:07:34] into submission,
[2:07:36] Satan? You think we're going to sit down
[2:07:37] and go quietly into the night, but this
[2:07:40] fight belongs to the Lord. The Lord will
[2:07:43] have the final say." I want you to
[2:07:45] compare what the devil says about it to
[2:07:47] the actual outcome. Which testimony
[2:07:50] lines up more to the outcome?
[2:07:53] Think about it. He comes and he says, "I
[2:07:54] come in the name of the Lord." And he
[2:07:56] says all this stuff that's going to
[2:07:57] happen. And guess what? It happens
[2:08:00] because it's the final say. And not only
[2:08:02] does it bring victory to David, but it
[2:08:04] brings victory to the whole assembly.
[2:08:07] You don't realize the courage you give
[2:08:09] other people when you stand and fight.
[2:08:11] The courage you give other people when
[2:08:13] you testify in the face of sickness.
[2:08:15] When you go into the valley and you
[2:08:16] proclaim, "He's my healer." Even though
[2:08:18] you're struggling, I'm delivered. Even
[2:08:21] though you're hurting, you give courage
[2:08:22] to those around you to charge into the
[2:08:24] valley and to conquer the devil and to
[2:08:27] swing the sword for themselves. It
[2:08:29] wasn't just a little victory. They
[2:08:31] chased Philistines and slaughtered them
[2:08:33] until the daylight ran out. It was a
[2:08:35] major victory cuz one person said, "This
[2:08:38] devil will not have the final say over
[2:08:40] my life."
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:47] He wants to strip you of your rights and
[2:08:49] your power and get you down where you
[2:08:52] feel like your faith isn't strong.
[2:08:57] You feel like you aren't a good
[2:08:58] Christian. You feel like you're not
[2:09:01] going to make it.
[2:09:03] Quit listening to what he says he's
[2:09:04] going to do to you. Those may be his
[2:09:07] true plans for you.
[2:09:09] I'm not saying he's lying. That's what
[2:09:11] he's planning to do.
[2:09:13] I'm saying he don't get the final say.
[2:09:15] He may be telling you that he's going to
[2:09:16] take you to a premature grave, that your
[2:09:19] family won't be saved, that things are
[2:09:20] always going to be this way. Here's what
[2:09:22] the devil does.
[2:09:24] The devil likes for you to think of the
[2:09:26] future and think of the future with
[2:09:30] today's circumstances.
[2:09:34] He likes to think of you in this
[2:09:36] condition, make you to think of yourself
[2:09:37] in this condition a year from now. And
[2:09:41] we say things like, "Well, if things
[2:09:42] don't get better, I don't think we're
[2:09:43] going to be able to. Well, if my son
[2:09:45] don't come back, well, if things don't
[2:09:47] turn around in our home." And so, what
[2:09:50] he's got you doing is picking up your
[2:09:51] condition and moving it into the future
[2:09:54] and already preparing for a future with
[2:09:56] that condition.
[2:09:58] It's the exact opposite of what the
[2:10:00] prophet of God said, "Do." He said,
[2:10:01] "Place a well body in front of you and
[2:10:03] begin walking towards that." What's that
[2:10:05] mean? You can take that same quote and
[2:10:07] take it where he says, "Plant your
[2:10:08] potatoes." It's the same thing with it.
[2:10:10] Plan for a positive future next year
[2:10:13] when all is well. We're going to do
[2:10:14] this. Oh, and when the son comes back,
[2:10:16] because he's coming back, here's how
[2:10:17] things are going to be in the home and
[2:10:18] things are restoring and things are
[2:10:20] coming back together. What do you speak?
[2:10:21] Are you speaking lies? No, it can't be a
[2:10:23] lie if you're speaking the word. You're
[2:10:25] speaking what the word says. Your testif
[2:10:28] people are like, I'm so afraid to say
[2:10:29] that. I'm just saying what the word
[2:10:30] said. It's not my responsibility to back
[2:10:32] it up. He says, "My people will never be
[2:10:34] ashamed." That means he's going to back
[2:10:36] up his word. He's not obligated to back
[2:10:38] up your word. He's obligated to back up
[2:10:40] his word. So what we do is we speak his
[2:10:43] word and we take his word and we place
[2:10:45] it in the future. And we say in the
[2:10:48] future I'm healed. Tomorrow I'm
[2:10:49] delivered. And we don't got to wait. It
[2:10:51] can happen right here in this moment.
[2:10:52] I'm just saying don't look to a future
[2:10:55] of defeat. But we are a people with no
[2:10:57] victory ahead of us of eternity ahead of
[2:11:00] us. We have no expiration date. That
[2:11:02] sickness has an expiration date. That
[2:11:04] tormentor has an expiration date. Cancer
[2:11:07] has an expiration date. Goliath had an
[2:11:09] expiration date. He woke up and he ate
[2:11:11] breakfast. Last time he put on his armor
[2:11:14] for the last time. And I say one day
[2:11:16] that tormentor is coming to torment you.
[2:11:19] Last time you're going to have aches and
[2:11:21] pains last time. You're going to be
[2:11:24] depressed. Last time. Because when those
[2:11:26] things end, we're going to be shouting
[2:11:28] eternally on the streets of glory,
[2:11:31] victorious conquerors.
[2:11:33] And I'm not going to wait till then to
[2:11:35] conquer, but I'm going to speak the word
[2:11:37] today. And I'm going to go forth in
[2:11:38] victory today because his word is the
[2:11:41] final say.
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:11:45] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; He says, "Refuse to see anything that's
[2:11:50] contrary to his word. It's not so." Like
[2:11:54] Jonah, they're lying vanities. I won't
[2:11:56] even see them. I won't recognize them.
[2:11:58] No, sir. I see what God said. Don't see
[2:12:01] the Amorites. Don't see the graveyard.
[2:12:03] Don't see these things. See the promise
[2:12:05] of God. God promises. It's up to God to
[2:12:08] take care of it. Sure, he's got plans
[2:12:11] for your life.
[2:12:13] But the one who actually holds my
[2:12:15] tomorrow already spoke about my plans in
[2:12:17] Jeremiah 29. He says, "For I know the
[2:12:21] thoughts that I think, eternal thoughts,
[2:12:25] unchanging thoughts,
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; thoughts that matter."
[2:12:29] He says, "Thoughts of peace, not of
[2:12:33] evil, to give you an expected end." In
[2:12:36] other words, I already know how it ends.
[2:12:38] I've already prepared for the way this
[2:12:40] is going to finish up. Oh, the devil's
[2:12:42] got something to say, but he's not the
[2:12:44] amen. The word of God is the amen.
[2:12:47] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. He
[2:12:49] said he's the God of the amen. He never
[2:12:52] changes. What he does never changes. He
[2:12:55] says it and it stands fast. He does it,
[2:12:57] it's done forever. None can take from
[2:12:59] what he says or add to it. So let it be.
[2:13:01] Amen. So let it be. Aren't you glad you
[2:13:03] serve that kind of God? You can know
[2:13:06] exactly where you are with him at any
[2:13:08] time and all the time. He is the amen
[2:13:10] and God and he won't change.
[2:13:15] I love how
[2:13:17] it speaks of him thinking of us there in
[2:13:19] Jeremiah
[2:13:21] because the thoughts that he has of us
[2:13:23] knowing we were in the mind of God and
[2:13:25] knowing that he loved us and he made
[2:13:27] plans for us before we ever came to this
[2:13:29] earth. It just overjoys me. I rejoice in
[2:13:32] that knowing that before the world ever
[2:13:35] started, God saw you.
[2:13:38] He saw your doubt this morning.
[2:13:40] He saw your fears. He saw your stumbles
[2:13:42] last week and he said, "Man, I love him.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; I love her."
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm not worthy. But we have to
[2:13:51] understand it like this.
[2:13:54] He knew that. That's why he died. That's
[2:13:58] why the sacrifice. So, let's quit
[2:14:01] bringing that up as an excuse. Let's
[2:14:02] bury that.
[2:14:04] No, none of us are worthy. He said, "I
[2:14:06] give you this freely."
[2:14:09] He didn't call us because we were
[2:14:11] worthy. He called us that we might be
[2:14:14] made worthy by his blood. Nothing Satan
[2:14:17] says can change that. I think about that
[2:14:20] sometimes. I think how frustrating.
[2:14:22] How frustrating it must be to the devil.
[2:14:25] To think that he has a say over a life
[2:14:28] to come and bring sin and to scar that
[2:14:31] life and to mar that life to bury it
[2:14:33] under so much sin and shame. He'll pour
[2:14:35] decades into a life and then in one
[2:14:38] moment God says, "No, that one's mine."
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; One moment. Satan pours decades and
[2:14:46] decades and decades. And God says, "One
[2:14:48] moment, that one's mine. I claim that
[2:14:51] one." He'll pour decades of torment, of
[2:14:53] depression. He'll pour decades of clouds
[2:14:55] of pain and and sickness. And in one
[2:14:57] moment, God says, "It's finished." In
[2:14:59] one moment, he says, "It's all over.
[2:15:02] I've spoken for this one." and what I
[2:15:04] speak is final.
[2:15:07] Maybe you can look today.
[2:15:09] Maybe you can look at a time where Satan
[2:15:11] had a lot to say in your life. Maybe you
[2:15:14] were bound. Maybe you could see no way
[2:15:16] out. Maybe you're in a spot like that
[2:15:19] today. Bound by what the devil had to
[2:15:21] say and scarred by things that he said
[2:15:23] in your life. Wounded by things that you
[2:15:26] had no control over. Hurt by others. I
[2:15:29] want to tell you right now, those things
[2:15:30] do not define you. Those things are not
[2:15:33] the final say.
[2:15:36] The plan Satan has for you will not
[2:15:38] stand. You will not be destroyed. You
[2:15:40] will not go down in defeat. But you're
[2:15:42] going to rise on eagle's wings today. I
[2:15:44] believe that with my whole heart. Satan
[2:15:46] had a lot to say in the life of the
[2:15:48] woman at the well. He did all he could
[2:15:50] do to her. He scarred her. She had a
[2:15:53] past that everybody knew, a shameful
[2:15:55] past. Her life was mangled. But one
[2:15:58] moment in his presence
[2:16:00] in that shameful past became her
[2:16:02] testimony
[2:16:03] because he held the final say. Let him
[2:16:06] speak into your life today. Let his word
[2:16:09] begin to speak over your life. Let him
[2:16:11] pour into your life. Oh, he had a lot to
[2:16:14] say in my life. I spent many years
[2:16:16] running. I spent many I don't testify of
[2:16:18] those things. I don't give glory to the
[2:16:20] devil, but I spent many years running
[2:16:21] from God. Many years in a life of sin.
[2:16:25] But I want to say to you today, come see
[2:16:26] a man who loved me when I was unlovable.
[2:16:30] Come see a man that loosed me. Come see
[2:16:32] a man that knew all I had done wrong.
[2:16:34] And despite all that, he said, I'll pay
[2:16:36] the price for Aaron Oglesby. I'll pay
[2:16:38] the price for him. Let him have a say
[2:16:40] today. The devil says you're worthless.
[2:16:43] God says you've been bought with a
[2:16:44] price. Devil says lost, God says
[2:16:47] redeemed. The devil says sick, God says
[2:16:49] healed. Devil says depression, God says
[2:16:52] joy. Devil says bound, God says you're
[2:16:55] free today. And when he speaks, nothing
[2:16:58] else matters. It doesn't matter how long
[2:17:01] you've been in that condition. And we're
[2:17:02] closing right now. It doesn't matter how
[2:17:05] long you've been in the condition you
[2:17:06] find yourself in today. Doesn't matter
[2:17:09] how long you've carried that bitterness,
[2:17:11] how long you've carried that
[2:17:12] unforgiveness. Doesn't matter how deep
[2:17:15] the scars is.
[2:17:17] When Jesus showed up to Mary and
[2:17:19] Martha's home,
[2:17:21] he said, "Where have you laid him?"
[2:17:25] So, I ask you a question today.
[2:17:29] Where have you laid your victory?
[2:17:33] Where have you laid your joy?
[2:17:37] Where have you laid your peace?
[2:17:41] Where have you laid those things that
[2:17:42] you thought was dead forever?
[2:17:45] People
[2:17:47] scarred you and hurt you, did you wrong,
[2:17:51] and those scars become complexes, and
[2:17:53] those complexes become grave clothes.
[2:17:56] But there's one that came in the
[2:17:58] building today and said, "I have the
[2:18:00] final say over this situation.
[2:18:02] Where have you laid it?"
[2:18:06] And notice when he calls Lazarus forth,
[2:18:08] he doesn't call him out and then leave
[2:18:10] him bound.
[2:18:12] He calls him out and he says, lose him.
[2:18:16] Death did not have the final say.
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; Your situation doesn't have the final
[2:18:21] say,
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; but we serve the final say today,
[2:18:24] church. The amen of God. The one who
[2:18:28] speaks and it can't be taken back. The
[2:18:30] one who has thoughts and they're
[2:18:31] absolutely perfect. The one who thought
[2:18:33] of you before the foundation of the
[2:18:35] world. He's the author and the finisher.
[2:18:38] He is the amen.
[2:18:40] Let him speak into your life today. Will
[2:18:42] you bow your heads with me?
[2:18:45] just for a moment, Father.
[2:18:47] Oh, we want you to speak into our lives.
[2:18:51] We want you, Lord Jesus, to come and
[2:18:53] take complete control.
[2:18:57] Lord, we've had lots of voices speak
[2:18:58] over us, lots of wounds, lots of hurts.
[2:19:00] But in this moment, in the next few
[2:19:02] moments, Lord, I ask you to speak
[2:19:04] directly to the hearts of your children.
[2:19:05] Let them hear the final say on the
[2:19:07] matter. Lord, may a true revelation from
[2:19:11] you speak into their hearts because
[2:19:12] Lord, I can say things into their ears.
[2:19:15] But Lord, may they recognize today that
[2:19:17] you hold their every moment. You hold
[2:19:19] their health. You hold their victory.
[2:19:22] You hold their joy. You hold their
[2:19:23] peace. You hold their children. Lord,
[2:19:25] you hold it all in your hand. And you
[2:19:27] can be trusted. Lord, let our trust find
[2:19:30] a place in you in Jesus name. Amen. You
[2:19:34] stand to your feet with me today.
[2:19:40] We got to quit thinking ourselves as
[2:19:41] worth as worthless church.
[2:19:44] He paid a price for you. He climbed up
[2:19:47] Calvary for you.
[2:19:50] And as he hung there on the cross of
[2:19:52] Calvary,
[2:19:54] he spoke the final words that would ever
[2:19:56] be recorded to the Jewish dispensation.
[2:19:59] The final words before the veil broke.
[2:20:02] The final words before you were set
[2:20:03] free. And he spoke the final say. And it
[2:20:06] was it is finished.
[2:20:12] That's where our faith lays today. It's
[2:20:14] finished. But brother, it's finished.
[2:20:17] But you don't understand. It's finished.
[2:20:19] And we're going to walk in that finished
[2:20:21] work. And we're going to look away from
[2:20:22] what the devil said. It's finished.
[2:20:24] Because in that moment, the devil's back
[2:20:26] was brought broken and joy was brought
[2:20:27] for you. And peace was brought for you
[2:20:29] and healing was brought for you. You
[2:20:30] know, I know I focus on all those
[2:20:31] things, but but let me bring it down to
[2:20:34] what really even matters more than that.
[2:20:36] an overcoming life was purchased for
[2:20:38] you.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; That's the that you know all these other
[2:20:42] things I don't consider them not
[2:20:44] important but at the end of the day what
[2:20:46] do I want? I want him to work everything
[2:20:48] out for our good which means we're going
[2:20:49] to get there.
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; It's already finished. It's already
[2:20:53] finished. Let him have the final say in
[2:20:56] your life.
[2:20:58] You're wonderful people. Wonderful
[2:21:01] Christian people. I I love you so much.
[2:21:03] But we're people
[2:21:06] and people have battles. People have
[2:21:08] wars. People have scars. People go
[2:21:11] through things that it's hard to go
[2:21:13] through alone. So as our brother John
[2:21:15] would lead us in worship tonight and we
[2:21:18] just begin to praise him and allow him
[2:21:20] to speak into our lives. If you have any
[2:21:22] situation, anything that you'd like
[2:21:24] prayer for, not not that you need to
[2:21:25] come to me, but many times I find that
[2:21:27] it helps people to have somebody unite
[2:21:29] their faith together with them. If you'd
[2:21:32] like to come and have prayer for any
[2:21:34] situation, I'm here for that. We're here
[2:21:36] to call on him and say, "Lord, it's your
[2:21:38] word that matters. It's your stripes
[2:21:40] that matter. It's you that matters, not
[2:21:42] what the devil's saying, not what the
[2:21:43] symptom saying." Because listen, God
[2:21:46] created you. He had the first say over
[2:21:50] your life. And he gets the final say
[2:21:53] over your life. And everything in
[2:21:55] between doesn't matter. He has the final
[2:21:58] say. If you need a touch from the Lord
[2:22:00] today or there's just something you want
[2:22:01] to lay down while we worship, I'll be
[2:22:04] right here if you'd like to pray
[2:22:05] together. Let him speak. Let him have
[2:22:08] the final say. As we leave from here, no
[2:22:11] matter what, let's drown out the voices
[2:22:13] of the enemy. And let's tune ourselves
[2:22:15] back in to a voice that called you by
[2:22:18] name.
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Why are you here? He called you by name.
[2:22:22] He has a say in your life. God bless
[2:22:25] you, saints.
[2:22:30] Oh yes, Lord Jesus. Thank you, Lord.
[2:22:32] It's already done.
[2:22:42] The battle is over.
[2:22:46] The victory is won.
[2:22:50] It's already done.
[2:22:54] And I'm already here. heal.
[2:23:00] Oh,
[2:23:02] I'm already
[2:23:04] healed.
[2:23:09] The battle
[2:23:11] is over.
[2:23:13] The victory is won
[2:23:17] and I'm already healed
[2:23:21] and it's already done.
[2:23:27] Oh,
[2:23:30] it's already
[2:23:32] done.
[2:23:37] The battle is over.
[2:23:41] The victory is won.
[2:23:45] It's already done.
[2:23:49] And I'm already healed.
[2:23:54] Oh,
[2:23:57] I'm already
[2:23:59] here.
[2:24:04] The battle is over.
[2:24:08] The victory is won.
[2:24:12] I'm already healed and it's already
[2:24:18] done.
[2:24:22] Oh,
[2:24:24] it's already
[2:24:26] done.
[2:24:31] The battle is over.
[2:24:36] Victory is won.
[2:24:40] It's already done.
[2:24:43] And I'm already healed.
[2:24:51] I'm already
[2:24:53] healed.
[2:24:58] The battle is over.
[2:25:02] The victory is won.
[2:25:06] I'm already healed.
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; I will praise the mighty name of Jesus.
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; I thank you for the healing that you
[2:25:14] brought. Lord, I just want to stand
[2:25:17] the enemy did not have the final say
[2:25:19] over.
[2:25:21] He came and tried to step it out and
[2:25:24] opportunity for the Holy Spirit to work
[2:25:26] as he raised him up in the testimony of
[2:25:28] the grace of almighty God.
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; I will praise the mighty name of Jesus.
[2:25:33] Lord, we're stepping back in line
[2:25:35] according to the vision that your
[2:25:36] prophet had. Lord, those people once
[2:25:38] cast aside, but they just said get back
[2:25:40] in line and they stepped right back into
[2:25:42] Lord. That's what we're doing today.
[2:25:44] We're getting back in step. refocus in
[2:25:46] all that we have, all of our energy,
[2:25:49] everything to make sure.
[2:25:50] &gt;&gt; My troubled soul,
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; why so weigh down?
[2:25:59] You were not made to bear this heavy
[2:26:04] load.
[2:26:06] Cast all your burdens
[2:26:10] upon the Lord.
[2:26:15] Jesus cares.
[2:26:18] He cares for you.
[2:26:22] And Jesus cares.
[2:26:26] He cares for you.
[2:26:30] and all your worrying won't help you
[2:26:34] make it through.
[2:26:38] &gt;&gt; So cast all your burdens
[2:26:42] upon the Lord.
[2:26:46] Trust again
[2:26:49] in the promise of his love.
[2:26:54] And I will praise the mighty
[2:26:59] name
[2:27:01] of Jesus.
[2:27:03] Praise the Lord, the lifter of my head.
[2:27:11] Praise the rock of my
[2:27:17] sal.
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; My days are in his faithful hands
[2:27:27] and my anxious heart.
[2:27:32] Why so upset?
[2:27:35] When trials come, how you so easily
[2:27:40] forget
[2:27:43] to cast your burdens
[2:27:48] upon the Lord.
[2:27:52] Jesus cares.
[2:27:55] He cares for you.
[2:28:00] Jesus cares.
[2:28:02] cares. He cares for you.
[2:28:07] And all your worry won't help you make
[2:28:12] it through.
[2:28:15] So cast all your burdens
[2:28:19] upon the Lord.
[2:28:23] Trust again
[2:28:26] in the promise of his love.
[2:28:31] And I will praise
[2:28:33] the mighty
[2:28:36] name
[2:28:37] of Jesus.
[2:28:40] Praise the Lord, the lifter of my head.
[2:28:48] Praise the rock of my
[2:28:53] salvation.
[2:28:56] All my days are in his faithful hands.
[2:29:04] My anxious heart.
[2:29:08] Why so upset?
[2:29:12] When trials come, how you so easily
[2:29:17] forget
[2:29:20] to cast your burdens
[2:29:24] upon the Lord.
[2:29:28] Jesus cares.
[2:29:31] He cares for you.
[2:29:35] And Jesus cares.
[2:29:39] He cares for you.
[2:29:47] &gt;&gt; Make it through.
[2:29:50] So cast all your burdens
[2:29:55] upon the Lord.
[2:29:59] Trust again
[2:30:01] in the promise of his love.
[2:30:07] And I will praise the mighty
[2:30:12] name
[2:30:13] of Jesus.
[2:30:16] Praise
[2:30:17] the Lord the lift up my head. Oh, praise
[2:30:25] the rock of my salvation.
[2:30:31] All my days are in his faithful hands.
[2:30:37] And I will praise the mighty
[2:30:42] name
[2:30:44] of Jesus.
[2:30:46] Praise the Lord, the lifter of my head.
[2:30:53] Oh, praise
[2:30:55] the rock of my
[2:30:59] salvation.
[2:31:01] All my days are in his faithful hands.
[2:31:08] And I will praise the rock heating
[2:31:14] of Jesus.
[2:31:17] Praise the Lord, the lifter of my head.
[2:31:24] Praise the rock of my
[2:31:30] salvation.
[2:31:32] know my days are in his faithful hands.
[2:31:40] My redeemer is faithful and true.
[2:31:45] My redeemer
[2:31:48] is faithful
[2:31:50] and true.
[2:31:54] Everything he has said he will do.
[2:32:02] And every morning
[2:32:05] his mercies are new.
[2:32:10] My redeemer
[2:32:13] is faithful
[2:32:15] and true.
[2:32:18] And my redeemer
[2:32:21] is faithful
[2:32:23] and true.
[2:32:26] And everything he has said he will do.
[2:32:34] And every morning
[2:32:37] his mercies are new.
[2:32:42] My redeemer
[2:32:44] is faithful and true.
[2:32:50] And my redeemer
[2:32:52] is faithful
[2:32:54] and true.
[2:32:58] And everything he has said he will do.
[2:33:06] And every morning
[2:33:08] his mercies are new.
[2:33:14] My redeemer
[2:33:16] is faithful
[2:33:18] and true.
[2:33:22] You know, he spoke there where God
[2:33:24] talked to Adam and Eve and he says, "I
[2:33:26] will put enmity between your seed and
[2:33:30] Satan's seed." Do you know what it means
[2:33:32] to have emnity? It's incompatible.
[2:33:37] It can't blend.
[2:33:39] What works for him doesn't work for us.
[2:33:42] What he lives by, we can't live by.
[2:33:45] And so what you see in your life today
[2:33:47] as a believer is God showing what enmity
[2:33:50] looks like.
[2:33:51] &gt;&gt; That what Satan has tried to place in
[2:33:54] cannot stay in a child of God because he
[2:33:56] promised it's incompatible.
[2:33:59] &gt;&gt; Sickness is incompatible with the child
[2:34:03] of God.
[2:34:06] &gt;&gt; Bondage is incompatible
[2:34:09] with a child of God. Depression is
[2:34:12] incompatible with the child of God.
[2:34:19] And all he's asking you to do
[2:34:22] is take him at his word. That's it. He
[2:34:25] said, "I sent my word and healed you
[2:34:28] from your disease." Take him at his
[2:34:31] word. You know, Satan came down into
[2:34:34] God's Eden and he turned the heart of a
[2:34:37] woman.
[2:34:39] And what is God doing today?
[2:34:41] &gt;&gt; He's coming down into Satan's Eden and
[2:34:44] he's turning the heart of a woman back
[2:34:46] to God.
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; That's what's happening in our midst.
[2:34:50] That's what the word is doing is it's
[2:34:51] turning our heart back to the father.
[2:34:55] &gt;&gt; It's preparing a bride for her
[2:34:57] bridegroom.
[2:34:59] And that's what happens when we come and
[2:35:01] we sit under the hearing of the word of
[2:35:03] an anointed preaching. And what is it
[2:35:05] doing? is turning our hearts back to the
[2:35:08] faith to take him at his word. That
[2:35:11] everything he said he would do,
[2:35:13] &gt;&gt; he will do.
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we're going to sing that song.
[2:35:17] I'm no longer a slave to fear.
[2:35:21] Because he holds so many things over us,
[2:35:23] Satan does.
[2:35:25] But when the word comes to set you free,
[2:35:29] I thought it was so beautiful. Satan can
[2:35:31] build a masterpiece for 40 years. And
[2:35:35] then God just comes down and he says,
[2:35:38] "Sorry, that's my masterpiece." And in
[2:35:40] the moment, in a twinkling of an eye,
[2:35:44] death turns to life. Bondage turns to
[2:35:47] freedom.
[2:35:49] &gt;&gt; Depression turns to joy. Mourning turns
[2:35:53] into thankfulness.
[2:35:56] And what looked to be a child of Satan
[2:36:00] produces the fruit of a child of God.
[2:36:02] Amen.
[2:36:04] That's what he's looking for.
[2:36:07] That's what he's searching for. That's
[2:36:09] why he sends his spirit is he's looking
[2:36:11] for that seed
[2:36:13] &gt;&gt; so quickly it can come to life and
[2:36:15] produce him all over again. Amen. Let's
[2:36:18] sing this together this morning.
[2:36:22] And you have covered me
[2:36:26] with a meloy.
[2:36:30] You surround me with
[2:36:34] a song
[2:36:38] of deliverance
[2:36:42] from mine enies.
[2:36:47] Till all my fears
[2:36:50] have gone
[2:36:54] and I'm no longer
[2:36:57] a slave to fear.
[2:37:03] I am a child of God
[2:37:09] and I'm no longer
[2:37:12] a slave to fear.
[2:37:19] I am a child of God
[2:37:25] and from my mother's womb.
[2:37:29] You have chosen me.
[2:37:34] Your love has called my name.
[2:37:41] And I've been born again
[2:37:45] into your family.
[2:37:49] Your blood flows through my veins
[2:37:56] and I'm no longer
[2:37:59] a slave to fear.
[2:38:05] I am a child of God.
[2:38:12] I'm no longer
[2:38:14] a slave to fear.
[2:38:20] I am a child
[2:38:23] of God.
[2:38:26] And from my mother's womb,
[2:38:31] you have chosen me.
[2:38:35] Your love has called my name
[2:38:42] and I've been born again
[2:38:46] into your family.
[2:38:50] Your blood flows through my veins
[2:38:57] and I'm no longer
[2:39:00] a slave to fear.
[2:39:06] I am a child of God
[2:39:12] and I'm no longer
[2:39:15] a slave to fear.
[2:39:21] I am a child of God.
[2:39:28] And you split the sea so I could walk
[2:39:33] right through it.
[2:39:36] My fears were drowned in perfect love.
[2:39:44] You rescued me so I can stand and say
[2:39:50] I am a child of God.
[2:39:58] You split the sea so I could walk right
[2:40:03] through it.
[2:40:06] &gt;&gt; My fears were drowned in perfect love.
[2:40:13] You rescued me so I can stand and say
[2:40:20] I am a child of God
[2:40:26] and I'm no longer
[2:40:29] a slave to fear.
[2:40:35] I am a child of God
[2:40:41] and I'm no longer
[2:40:44] a slave to fear.
[2:40:50] I am a child of God.
[2:40:55] Do we know that song? When I think about
[2:40:57] the Lord.
[2:41:08] When I think about the Lord,
[2:41:14] how he saved me, how he raised me, how
[2:41:20] he filled me with the Holy Ghost,
[2:41:26] &gt;&gt; how he hallelujah
[2:41:29] to the uttermost
[2:41:32] when I think about the Lord.
[2:41:38] How he picked me up and turn me around.
[2:41:44] How he set my feet
[2:41:49] on solid ground.
[2:41:54] Oh, it makes me want to shout.
[2:41:58] Oh, hallelu.

[2:45:54] their God and see him work in their

[2:46:00] much you appreciated his time and his
[2:46:03] energy and his commitment to coming to
[2:46:04] preach. Let him know what struck you and
[2:46:07] what God did for you this weekend. It'll
[2:46:09] encourage him as he goes back home and
[2:46:11] continues the battle and continues to
[2:46:13] minister wherever God would take him.
[2:46:15] Amen. We've got a fellowship right
[2:46:17] afterwards. We've got food prepared.
[2:46:18] Everyone's welcome to stay. There's
[2:46:20] plenty. Please stay if you can. If not,
[2:46:23] may the Lord be with you and we'll see
[2:46:24] you again uh when we have service on

[2:51:39] Lord heavenly father
[2:51:42] we thank you for this weekend Lord.
[2:51:46] This might sound strange Lord but
[2:51:50] I'm thankful for the heart attack. Lord,
[2:51:53] truly thankful
[2:51:58] you have such a way of doing things,
[2:51:59] Lord, that only you could do, Lord.
[2:52:04] &gt;&gt; And I thank you, Father, for sparing my
[2:52:06] life, Lord. And
[2:52:10] allow me, Lord, Father God, to get back
[2:52:13] to that place, Lord,
[2:52:16] my family, Lord, and and
[2:52:19] spend that time with you, God.
[2:52:26] With my breath, Lord, I shall praise
[2:52:27] you.
[2:52:31] Lord, I pray for brother Aaron, Lord, as
[2:52:33] he travels and and as we fellowship,
[2:52:36] Lord, I pray that you touch him, Lord,
[2:52:38] and touch his family, restore any thing
[2:52:40] that may have left his body, Lord, and
[2:52:45] just anoint him, Father God, to speak
[2:52:47] and touch people wherever he may go,
[2:52:49] Lord.
[2:52:52] You know, Lord, when
[2:52:54] a lot of hopes for him coming, Lord, and
[2:52:57] and when the heart attack happened, it
[2:52:58] looked like it wouldn't
[2:53:00] wasn't going to happen, Lord. And
[2:53:03] thank you for allowing me to be a part
[2:53:04] of this today, Lord.
[2:53:07] And I just pray, Father, for anybody
[2:53:09] that needs you, Lord, you touch them in
[2:53:11] a special way. Jesus Christ's name.
[2:53:14] Amen.
