[47:15] [Music]
[47:22] [Music]
[47:58] [Music]
[48:06] a man praise the name of the Lord if
[48:10] there's any showers of blessing we need
[48:12] it's the showers and the blessings of
[48:14] the revealed word amen is what God
[48:17] nomally God has done but is what God is
[48:19] doing showing that he is the same
[48:22] yesterday today and forever amen he was
[48:26] there to bless them he's there to bless
[48:27] us and if there's another generation
[48:30] he's there to bless them but I turn to
[48:32] this we've gotta have our hearts open to
[48:35] the revealed Word amen to recognize what
[48:38] he's doing
[48:39] amen there are many L unfortunately many
[48:42] worshiping the devil thinking they're
[48:44] worshiping God that's the truth because
[48:46] he is is the god of this world a man to
[48:51] God be the glory I trust you're
[48:52] worshiping Jesus I trust you're
[48:54] worshiping the true revelation a man not
[48:58] a man-made revelation but what God has
[49:00] given us by the Holy Ghost amen
[49:03] what has been what has been promised for
[49:05] this day and for this hour
[49:07] amen not what he did even 50 years ago
[49:10] what's he doing now in your life and in
[49:13] my life by the grace of Almighty God so
[49:16] God help us to have our hearts open the
[49:18] Bible says faith comes by hearing and
[49:20] hearing by the word so we've got to be
[49:24] we got to be sensitive to the going
[49:25] forth of the words
[49:26] amen now not lot of what went forth
[49:30] what's going for praise the name of the
[49:33] Lord amen there's too many too many just
[49:35] going on what what the word that went
[49:37] for when four went for well the prophet
[49:39] of God said keep digging deeper Eason
[49:41] and more will be revealed hey man so
[49:44] brother that means we got to keep on
[49:46] going keep on going keep on going amen
[49:49] oh I believe what my what what they
[49:51] believe fifty years ago that's good but
[49:53] what about today any man now we believe
[49:56] what God is doing today amen we want to
[49:58] maybe touch on some of those things this
[50:00] morning as we go into the word and it's
[50:03] the messages of the prophet of God
[50:04] preached 1962 convinced then concerned a
[50:08] man I wonder I've many are really
[50:10] concerned over what God not what God has
[50:13] done
[50:13] but concern over what God
[50:15] is doing a million and where God is
[50:17] requiring of us in this day in this hour
[50:20] so I pray the grace of God be with us as
[50:22] we get into the Word of God amen get
[50:25] into the written word and into the
[50:27] revealed word concerning what God is
[50:30] doing and what God is expecting of you
[50:33] and me but God is requiring of you and
[50:35] me in this day in this hour is late and
[50:38] I'll say it again it is later than we
[50:40] think
[50:41] a man so the grace of God be with us
[50:43] amen and we certainly welcome our
[50:45] brother Eugene young and sister Mellie
[50:48] amen
[50:49] it's a good the last time we saw them
[50:52] was when brother car was here and and we
[50:55] went down and visited with them and oh
[50:59] yes and we had we had a lunch natural
[51:02] lunch and we and we trusted that maybe
[51:05] they'll be here for the natural lunch
[51:07] today at brother Mark's after the
[51:10] service praise the Lord that's good so
[51:12] we certainly welcome our brother and
[51:14] sister amen and it was for many years
[51:17] now what we've had we've known each
[51:19] other concern around the Word of God so
[51:22] I pray that we're going to be there in
[51:25] the resurrection and rapture amen that
[51:28] our faith is going to come together
[51:30] claiming the promise of the Resurrection
[51:32] and the rapture but god help us as I
[51:36] said we're getting to this message right
[51:37] here are we convinced absolutely in our
[51:41] souls by the Holy Ghost
[51:43] Irie convinced concerning the revelation
[51:45] of the Resurrection and the revelation
[51:48] of the rapture amen because the because
[51:51] the prophet of gazeta you're convinced
[51:53] you'll be concerned but it says the
[51:55] problem is he said there's not many
[51:56] convinced of the message amen but God
[51:59] help us brother there is a bright a man
[52:02] so we pray the grace of God with our
[52:04] sister Leah and Genevieve in Alberta
[52:06] today and I believe as a youth
[52:09] convention there are youth going on so
[52:12] god bless them amen
[52:14] and there again praying the grace of God
[52:16] to the to the bride around the world
[52:19] amen god help us brothers sister because
[52:22] it the time for the bride on the earth
[52:24] is getting shorter than anyone else
[52:26] a man the bride in a moment the train
[52:29] livin is gonna be caught up in a moment
[52:31] in the twinkling of an eye she's gonna
[52:33] be cut she's gonna be changed by the
[52:35] grace of God and I trust we but we're
[52:37] convinced that we're in the process of
[52:39] it now a man that is going on right now
[52:43] and brother and if we are convinced of
[52:46] it we will be concerned
[52:47] a man by of the truth of God a man so
[52:53] also to remember that our brother Mark
[52:57] will be ministering Lord willing on
[52:59] Wednesday Wednesday evening a man's will
[53:01] be in prayer for the Ministry of the
[53:04] word we think our brother Alec for the
[53:05] word that he brought forth on Wednesday
[53:07] a man has a change of a change of the
[53:11] body amen brother that's what's going on
[53:14] he ministered on it and we've been
[53:16] ministering around for quite a while now
[53:17] the change of the body
[53:19] a man so brother we've changed from
[53:22] religion to the to the Holy Ghost
[53:24] revival brother we changed from the law
[53:26] to seeing and Pentecostal revolver to
[53:29] the bride revival but now brothers issue
[53:31] is bringing on a greater change a man
[53:34] from time to eternity I pray God we
[53:37] believe it
[53:37] I play Iran true I pray God we truly
[53:41] sincerely honestly in our hearts believe
[53:44] it amen not acknowledging in our heads
[53:47] but in our hearts listen we'll hear what
[53:50] the Prophet has got to say challenging
[53:52] our faith challenging whether or not we
[53:54] believe challenging whether or not we
[53:56] are convinced because what he was seeing
[53:59] was the lack of concern a man there was
[54:02] concerned good to go to church a concern
[54:05] for this a concern for that but what
[54:07] about a concern for the resurrection and
[54:09] the rapture amen
[54:10] the wondrous a he said there he said the
[54:12] dead in Christ are waiting on us and God
[54:15] is waiting on us for the rapture
[54:18] why Jase it's the manifest our concern a
[54:22] man and again I keep referring to it
[54:24] brother because that's the perfect tight
[54:26] in the Bible as it was with Joshua and
[54:29] Caleb they were concerned about God not
[54:30] just coming out by going in but the vast
[54:34] majority of the Jews they were concerned
[54:37] about going in you know once once once
[54:39] they just in their minds considered what
[54:42] it was like and and how big the cities
[54:44] were now how big the the soldiers were
[54:46] and so on they don't know no no they
[54:48] weren't going to trust God a match so
[54:51] they weren't fully convinced as Joshua
[54:54] and Caleb was and they wanted to go in
[54:56] amen they had the promise and Cain and
[54:59] Caleb challenged them he said they've
[55:00] gotta be with us who can be against us
[55:03] amen so the same thing with what we're
[55:05] believing for the resurrection and the
[55:07] rapture brother of Gavi with us who can
[55:09] be against us let's believe God not the
[55:12] devil a man by the grace of God amen so
[55:16] the Lord blesses this dancing only
[55:18] believe as we go to the word and God's
[55:20] grace to all the saints and again our
[55:22] brother Paul and sister Kevin I think
[55:25] we'll be moving not too far in the
[55:26] future to another apartment so god bless
[55:29] them amen
[55:30] and keep again keep us in prayer myself
[55:33] sister Betty and also thank those who
[55:35] have called our sister and wished her a
[55:37] happy birthday and and she got grease
[55:41] today from from sister Isabel stockless
[55:44] in Ontario so god god bless them amen
[55:49] so let's say only believe all things are
[55:52] possible only believe but I already
[55:54] believe just believe in our hearts let's
[55:57] believe it in our souls not our heads
[55:59] again let's let it let our faith go
[56:02] beyond the devil's faith a man brother
[56:05] to claim the promise of God God Elvis
[56:08] that we're going to be focusing more on
[56:10] the on the spiritual and less on the
[56:12] natural amen only Billy

[1:06:40] amen praise the name of the Lord God
[1:06:43] bless yes before I let you be seated
[1:06:46] turn with me to the book of Romans
[1:06:48] chapter 4 a man the book of Romans
[1:06:52] chapter 4 amen and we want us to talk a
[1:06:59] little this morning and share some
[1:07:00] Scripture and quotes concerning whether
[1:07:04] or not we are convinced on what God is
[1:07:08] doing amen
[1:07:10] now what God has done sure is written in
[1:07:13] the word history proves it but one of it
[1:07:15] what God is doing to do the to believe
[1:07:18] that we have we had to become one with
[1:07:20] God one with his word one with one with
[1:07:23] one another one with what what he's
[1:07:25] doing a man and in Romans chapter four
[1:07:29] I'm beginning to read at verse 13 and he
[1:07:35] said for the promise that he would be
[1:07:37] the hair of the world was not to Abraham
[1:07:42] or to his seed through the law but
[1:07:46] through the righteousness of faith
[1:07:50] obeying the righteousness of faith the
[1:07:55] righteousness of faith produces in your
[1:07:58] life and in my life God Elvis for if
[1:08:01] they which are of the law be heirs of
[1:08:03] faith or if they which are of the law be
[1:08:08] heirs faith is made void it's not the
[1:08:13] past it's the present and the promise
[1:08:16] made of none effect because the law
[1:08:20] workers wrath for where no law is there
[1:08:24] is no transgression amen therefore thank
[1:08:30] God he brought us out from it under the
[1:08:32] law and into the righteousness of Christ
[1:08:35] this is amazing that God has imputed to
[1:08:38] us the righteousness of Jesus and not
[1:08:42] only that it's absolutely amazing we are
[1:08:44] brother we ought to be thankful and
[1:08:46] grateful that God has taken our sea
[1:08:48] and Buddha in the sea of forgetfulness a
[1:08:51] minute
[1:08:52] God doesn't remember it we're even
[1:08:55] written the devil remembers that others
[1:08:57] remember it but God doesn't remember
[1:08:59] Amen praise the Lord you talk about
[1:09:02] faith in Jesus we ought to believe Jesus
[1:09:04] Amen we ought to be given the glory to
[1:09:06] Jesus any man is our righteousness he is
[1:09:09] our our salvation therefore he said it
[1:09:12] is of faith that it might be by grace
[1:09:16] because divine love projected Grace and
[1:09:19] Grace has projected the faith that
[1:09:21] pleases God and he said to the end the
[1:09:25] promise might be sure to all the seed
[1:09:27] not to that only which is of the law but
[1:09:30] to that also which is of the faith of
[1:09:35] Abraham who is the father of us all amen
[1:09:41] as it is written I have made thee a
[1:09:44] father of many nations before whom he
[1:09:48] believed even God who quickeneth the
[1:09:51] dead and calleth those things which be
[1:09:54] not as though they were hear the word
[1:09:57] and it says that caller those things
[1:10:00] which be not as though they were who
[1:10:03] against hope believed in hope and again
[1:10:08] it's the hope with expectation of
[1:10:10] fulfillment and it says that he might
[1:10:14] become the father of many nations
[1:10:16] according to that which was spoken so
[1:10:19] shall thy seed be and being not weak in
[1:10:24] faith he considered not his own body now
[1:10:28] dead
[1:10:29] so we consider not the aging process in
[1:10:33] the body that we're living in amen we
[1:10:36] consider eternal life in our Lord Jesus
[1:10:39] Christ so as he considered not his own
[1:10:43] body now dead when he was about a
[1:10:45] hundred years old neither yet the
[1:10:47] deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered
[1:10:50] not at the promise of God through
[1:10:54] unbelief God Elba's not the stager at
[1:10:59] the promise of the Resurrection and the
[1:11:02] but was strong in faith giving glory to
[1:11:07] God
[1:11:08] amen hallelujah and being fully
[1:11:12] persuaded that what he had promised he
[1:11:15] was also able also to perform amen
[1:11:22] and therefore it was imputed to him for
[1:11:25] righteousness
[1:11:27] amen where is your righteousness where
[1:11:30] is my righteousness abraham believed God
[1:11:33] and it was imputed to him for
[1:11:36] righteousness and if we believe what God
[1:11:38] has done and what God has revealed which
[1:11:41] computer to us for righteousness Amen
[1:11:44] god bless His Word you may be seated
[1:11:45] our righteousness reaches to the extent
[1:11:50] of our faith in believing what God is
[1:11:52] doing a man so just before we get more
[1:11:56] into the scripture and other scriptures
[1:12:01] there's a couple of quotes here that
[1:12:03] well one days that our brother Karsan
[1:12:08] sent me from Ontario and another one was
[1:12:14] a brother I not sure who the brother is
[1:12:16] or where he is but it was it was a quote
[1:12:20] concerning how big is God and it's
[1:12:25] amazing there's revelation there but in
[1:12:28] the in the message quote from our
[1:12:31] brother Karsan it says have you given
[1:12:34] everything yet are you fully persuaded
[1:12:38] and convinced to the extent that you
[1:12:43] have given everything to the Lord is now
[1:12:46] you the lives this Christ lives in you a
[1:12:48] man and it's God that blesses you and
[1:12:52] the prophet of God said the Bride of
[1:12:54] Christ has been given invaluable
[1:12:57] promises from the word that we can be
[1:13:02] partakers of the divine nature of Christ
[1:13:05] through the Holy Spirit amen
[1:13:08] as it was imputed to Abraham soon its
[1:13:12] righteousness is impure
[1:13:13] to us a mayor so I pray God that we have
[1:13:17] the way of the revelation of
[1:13:19] righteousness that God has that we're
[1:13:21] going to believe that we have that
[1:13:23] righteousness amen we're going to
[1:13:25] respect God we're going to honor God
[1:13:27] from what he has done and what he is
[1:13:29] doing and this is tremendous brother
[1:13:31] amen
[1:13:32] thank God God has said sometimes chosen
[1:13:35] the worst out there in the world in the
[1:13:37] eyes of the world
[1:13:38] they're the worst in the eyes of may and
[1:13:40] by they're the best in the eyes of God a
[1:13:41] man is just like just like that woman
[1:13:44] that came in and watched Jesus feet and
[1:13:46] here was the the Pharisee they are te
[1:13:48] was so self-righteous and they
[1:13:51] criticized Jesus because he was allowing
[1:13:53] this woman this dishonored this he
[1:13:56] was allowing her to Washington wash his
[1:13:58] feet
[1:13:59] amen - and she wiped them with the hairs
[1:14:02] of her head and she anointed them with
[1:14:04] oil and so on it's just absolutely
[1:14:06] amazing brother sister let's not condemn
[1:14:09] God for blessing this brother blessing
[1:14:12] that sitteth sister or we think oh
[1:14:14] they're they're they're they're not
[1:14:15] Christians they're not believers well we
[1:14:17] better look at them through the eyes of
[1:14:19] God amen there's not a true our eyes is
[1:14:22] not what we think is not what we see is
[1:14:24] what God thinks what God sees a man a
[1:14:27] man so God is looking at their faith and
[1:14:30] he when they talked to that woman at the
[1:14:32] well and he loved this woman in in the
[1:14:35] house there to wash his feet with her
[1:14:38] tears wipe them with her hair knowing
[1:14:40] with the oil that she had bought and
[1:14:42] again Oh surely surely that he wouldn't
[1:14:46] allow her to do that considering the
[1:14:48] money that she used the by that night
[1:14:50] Judas his motive was wrong always that
[1:14:53] should be sold and the money given to
[1:14:54] the poor
[1:14:55] well when if we consider where that
[1:14:58] money come from there's a lot we feel
[1:15:00] all we no no no we would have nothing to
[1:15:03] do with that money a man because maybe
[1:15:05] she got paid for something she did a man
[1:15:08] that was contrary to the Word of God and
[1:15:10] contrary to the law a man but Jesus
[1:15:13] wasn't looking at her at her natural
[1:15:15] works
[1:15:15] he wasn't looking at her natural body he
[1:15:18] was looking at her faith a man there she
[1:15:20] believed more than the scribes and the
[1:15:22] Pharisees she believed more than those
[1:15:25] that
[1:15:25] that were so religious like the rich man
[1:15:28] said he said Jesus said you know he said
[1:15:31] do do this and do that he said I have
[1:15:33] kept those Commandments he said all my
[1:15:35] life a man but yet a man he wouldn't do
[1:15:38] what God wanted him to do
[1:15:40] hey man oh there we can be so good a man
[1:15:44] but yet in the eyes of God so
[1:15:45] unrighteous that is the absolute truth a
[1:15:48] man in our own eyes we think we're right
[1:15:51] sirs in our own eyes we might think
[1:15:52] we're a Christian in our own eyes we
[1:15:54] think we're believers but in the eyes of
[1:15:56] God we might be Devils in the eyes of
[1:15:58] God we may God would look down say well
[1:16:00] there are not believers oh they think
[1:16:02] they are because the devil has lied to
[1:16:04] them amen
[1:16:05] Ramirez say Satan believes the message
[1:16:08] Satan is going to give you the truth
[1:16:09] Satan is going to give you the message
[1:16:11] 99% or you give you a hundred and one
[1:16:14] percent amen whole you believe the
[1:16:16] message and buddy but the devil had a
[1:16:19] word or a takeaway a word a man and
[1:16:22] brother that's what's going on around
[1:16:24] the world right now concerning the
[1:16:25] message I'm not interested in what's
[1:16:27] going on over there I'm concerned about
[1:16:30] going on around the message because what
[1:16:32] God is doing the brother the faith we
[1:16:34] need is in what God is doing in the
[1:16:37] revelation of the word for this day and
[1:16:40] for this hour but there's many that are
[1:16:42] that are listening to the devil and
[1:16:44] they're heady they're heading to the
[1:16:45] word they're taking away from the word
[1:16:47] but we got to leave it the way that God
[1:16:49] may give it to us amen and we got to
[1:16:52] believe it but what God told us through
[1:16:55] is serving the Prophet amen and it's in
[1:16:58] the word and again I am email I got to
[1:17:02] keep repeating it and because as John
[1:17:05] said you're forgetful there's and again
[1:17:07] and I and I saw our brother do it our
[1:17:09] brother Billy Paul it was on a film some
[1:17:12] years ago and when he took a smoking
[1:17:15] wordbook now they should we just don't
[1:17:17] take this no no no he's got to take this
[1:17:20] and he said I put it in here a main
[1:17:24] because he says it brings you back to
[1:17:26] the word amen and I said a van bro
[1:17:30] brother that's that
[1:17:31] that is the absolute truth what God has
[1:17:34] done and what God has revealed brother
[1:17:36] is to bring us back here because one
[1:17:38] faith comes by hearing and hearing by
[1:17:40] the word
[1:17:41] oh but this is the word yes exactly but
[1:17:44] it's the revelation of what God has
[1:17:47] already recorded it's the revelation
[1:17:50] what God has already say and what God
[1:17:52] has already put in his book Amen praise
[1:17:55] the name of the Lord so it's not going
[1:17:57] to take us out it's going to put us in
[1:17:59] any man so that we're going to become
[1:18:02] one with the word praise the name of the
[1:18:04] Lord amen play all right because that's
[1:18:09] the gain any in the book of John chapter
[1:18:11] 14 amen and I and I again I acquitted a
[1:18:15] number of times but again to highlight
[1:18:17] though what the prophet of God said
[1:18:19] concerning that scripture and it wasn't
[1:18:23] then but it is listen to this day and in
[1:18:25] this hour and he said jesus said I will
[1:18:28] play the father he will send you another
[1:18:30] comforter that he may abide with you
[1:18:32] forever and he went on down he said I
[1:18:35] will not leave you comfortless I will
[1:18:37] come to you
[1:18:38] a man hallelujah he's gonna company is
[1:18:41] going to enter into a oneness with the
[1:18:43] body enter into a oneness with his bride
[1:18:46] praise the name of the Lord and he said
[1:18:48] and he said and that day he said you'll
[1:18:54] know that I'm in the father the father
[1:18:55] in me and I in you
[1:18:57] amen nursery and brother Brown sir
[1:19:00] that's this day a man because his God
[1:19:03] revealed himself evening they in the
[1:19:05] brain and to the bride all the way down
[1:19:07] through little by little by little by
[1:19:09] little until it's the fullness of the
[1:19:11] Godhead bodily
[1:19:12] a man is revealed in a prophetic
[1:19:14] ministry a sort of man revealing the
[1:19:17] sort of man remember he's come we're not
[1:19:19] looking for Jesus to come he has come
[1:19:21] so are we convinced that he is here are
[1:19:24] we convinced that he has come for the
[1:19:26] bride that he has descended from heaven
[1:19:29] with a shout the voice of the Archangel
[1:19:31] the Trump of God a man he has come down
[1:19:34] to what was the next thing because then
[1:19:37] we have the evidence of it in the pillar
[1:19:39] of fire we have the evidence of it in
[1:19:41] the cloud of angels a man because there
[1:19:44] looking down at us hey man sir brother
[1:19:46] way what is what is it what did he do
[1:19:49] all this for to get us back into the
[1:19:52] word to give us the faith with a
[1:19:53] resurrection and the rapture brother
[1:19:56] that's a that's that's the next thing on
[1:19:58] the agenda it is the resurrection and
[1:20:01] the rapture and again don't forget when
[1:20:04] I found the province in it but again our
[1:20:06] brother our brother Andre he also
[1:20:09] highlighted it that we are not in the

[1:29:39] somebody else was talking to him that
[1:29:41] knew him and they and they never never
[1:29:42] dropped their hands they still kept
[1:29:43] their hands hold means just like she was
[1:29:47] like sometimes that a boy and a girl

[1:32:53] it was so very was to teach you and me a
[1:32:56] man it was an example for you and me

[1:33:44] sacrificing and showing the food showing
[1:33:50] you Abraham's faith in the resurrection
[1:33:53] he said I received them as one from the
[1:33:56] dead and he said God is able to raise it
[1:33:58] back up again

[1:44:53] the heavenly bridegroom and the Erte
[1:44:55] right then he's here he's got to be here
[1:44:58] for us to be united within any man and
[1:45:01] he's taken us from time to eternity and
[1:45:04] as the Provost said he'll go back and
[1:45:06] he'll get that body and come down and
[1:45:08] receive us unto himself because he said
[1:45:11] right now there's no life in that body
[1:45:13] by the throne thank God that the life is
[1:45:17] with us
[1:45:18] any man the life is in you and it in me
[1:45:21] and we're and it's taking us out of here
[1:45:23] amen all god help us brother so how can
[1:45:28] you how can you separate yourself from
[1:45:30] Jesus how can you not think about Jesus
[1:45:32] you know you know all circumstances and
[1:45:34] all situations he said the last Trump
[1:45:41] for the trumpet shall sound and the dead
[1:45:44] shall be raised incorruptible and we
[1:45:46] shall be changed
[1:45:48] amen brother there's more going on than
[1:45:51] what we realized I said it's later than
[1:45:53] what we think and there's more going on
[1:45:55] what we realized the data are closer to
[1:45:56] us than what we think that's right and
[1:46:01] as he said they're waiting on us
[1:46:02] any man and he said they're going to
[1:46:04] appear to us that's what he said any one
[1:46:06] of those messages here
[1:46:07] he said the dating Christ are going to
[1:46:09] appear to us and then he said we're
[1:46:11] gonna be caught into that dimension and
[1:46:13] he said we're gonna be changed instantly
[1:46:14] and somewhere there I read somewhere
[1:46:18] where he said he can we're going to
[1:46:19] fellowship with each other and then he
[1:46:21] said we're gonna look up and there's the
[1:46:23] pillar fires go me in that class in that
[1:46:25] body called Jesus and we'll rise to meet
[1:46:27] him for the marriage supper of the lamb
[1:46:30] how many are convinced already and so
[1:46:36] concerned that they want they want to
[1:46:40] put the emphasis on the resurrection in
[1:46:42] the rapture they want to get out of here
[1:46:44] so kit boy
[1:46:46] why why because jesus said if he didn't
[1:46:49] shorten time to be no flesh Savior
[1:46:52] that's how bad it's getting he didn't
[1:46:56] say no soul saved but he said there'd be
[1:46:59] no flesh saved that's how bad it's
[1:47:01] getting oh that's the great tribulation
[1:47:05] where brother there's a lap over and I
[1:47:08] pray grace God take us out of here
[1:47:09] before before before that islands
[1:47:13] brother and I see I see it coming around
[1:47:16] the message oh yeah more and more
[1:47:19] worldliness more and more foolishness
[1:47:24] and it's the influence as I've said of
[1:47:26] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[1:47:27] that Internet
[1:47:29] oh yeah God Elvis and he said the dead
[1:47:35] in Christ shall be raised incorruptible
[1:47:36] and we shall be changed
[1:47:40] by the grace of Almighty God amen
[1:47:44] turn with me and they were finished
[1:47:47] reading what the brother gave me there
[1:47:48] turn with me to Romans chapter 8 Romans
[1:48:00] 8 and beginning to read at verse 33 who
[1:48:13] shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:48:15] God's elect is God that justify it
[1:48:20] oh thank God please in the name of Jesus
[1:48:26] let's exercise our faith any man brother
[1:48:31] cast out the spirits of unbelief and he
[1:48:36] said it was either condemneth it is
[1:48:39] Christ that died a rather that is risen
[1:48:41] again who is even at the right hand of
[1:48:44] God who also making intercession for us
[1:48:47] then the price is paid amen and the sin
[1:48:52] has gone into sea of forgetfulness and
[1:48:55] he said who shall separate us from the
[1:48:57] love of Christ shall tribulation or
[1:49:00] distress or persecution or famine or
[1:49:05] nakedness or peril or sword what's going
[1:49:09] to separate us from the love of Christ
[1:49:11] regardless of what you're going to
[1:49:13] experience and what you got to go
[1:49:14] through you're gonna love it
[1:49:17] because what we're experiencing in the
[1:49:20] flesh is just natural but the faith in
[1:49:23] the souls take us into eternity
[1:49:25] it's spiritual but just too much
[1:49:29] emphasis on the natural not enough on
[1:49:31] the spiritual that's right I don't care
[1:49:35] whether you're in school at home at work
[1:49:37] you still got to put emphasis on Jesus
[1:49:41] on the spiritual the spiritual the
[1:49:43] special they mean he's with you in
[1:49:46] school it's with you at work it's with
[1:49:48] you in your home he's with you you know
[1:49:50] and no matter where you are not just
[1:49:51] here in church he come with you and
[1:49:55] he'll go with you amen
[1:49:58] god help us grace my my God have mercy
[1:50:08] but too many are putting the answers on
[1:50:10] the next were not too spiritual so he
[1:50:15] said shall tribulation or distress
[1:50:18] separate us from the love of Christ
[1:50:22] persecution or famine nakedness or peril
[1:50:25] or sword and he says it is written for
[1:50:28] thy sake we are killed all the day long
[1:50:32] we are accounted as sheep for the
[1:50:35] slaughter and he said nay in all these
[1:50:38] things we are more than conquerors amen
[1:50:43] more than conquerors through him that
[1:50:46] loved us hallelujah praise the name of
[1:50:50] the Lord he has put his seal in you he
[1:50:55] has put his seal on us amen
[1:51:00] we are more than conquerors through him
[1:51:03] that loved us brother if he loved us so
[1:51:06] much more we gonna love him he is how
[1:51:10] much more we're gonna lay down our lives
[1:51:12] for one another for here cuz the lay
[1:51:15] down our lives for one others lay down
[1:51:16] our lives for you remember again as I
[1:51:22] preach you're going to hell not because
[1:51:24] of what you did because of what you
[1:51:25] didn't do because jesus said in as much
[1:51:29] you didn't do it to the least of these
[1:51:31] my brother you didn't do it to me he
[1:51:34] said depart from me into everlasting
[1:51:35] fire amazing absolutely amazing just go
[1:51:46] like I said go read it again he said did
[1:51:49] this did this did this did this he did
[1:51:51] it to me he said
[1:51:53] to the least and then he went on says
[1:51:56] but you didn't do this you didn't do
[1:51:58] this you didn't do that and he says you
[1:52:02] didn't do it to the least she didn't do
[1:52:03] it me he says so I said going to
[1:52:06] everlasting fire those that did it are
[1:52:09] gonna go into glory it's amazing
[1:52:12] you have a God in simplicity any man he
[1:52:18] said I am persuaded that neither death
[1:52:20] nor life nor Angels nor principalities
[1:52:23] nor powers nor things present nor things
[1:52:26] to come nor height nor depth nor any
[1:52:30] other creature shall be able to separate
[1:52:32] us from the love of God which is in
[1:52:34] Christ Jesus our Lord
[1:52:36] how many have the love of God and are
[1:52:40] manifesting the love of God yeah I mean
[1:52:46] you're living the love of God as Jesus
[1:52:49] lived it yeah as I said keep your
[1:52:54] attitude right keep your spirit toward
[1:52:57] everyone because there goes you but for
[1:53:00] the grace of God I don't care if they're
[1:53:03] denominations if you're out there in the
[1:53:05] world
[1:53:06] there goes you but for the grace of God
[1:53:09] every man
[1:53:10] oh what I'm predestinated and so on and
[1:53:13] maybe they're not well that's between
[1:53:15] them and God because listen if God Bible
[1:53:18] says God's not willing that any should
[1:53:20] perish and if God's not willing that any
[1:53:22] should perish neither isn't the bride
[1:53:25] any bad no matter how bad they are what
[1:53:28] it is you're praying God have mercy on
[1:53:30] that Lord does the devil and yeah it's
[1:53:34] the lord grace grace to me lord grace to
[1:53:36] that brother
[1:53:37] grace to that man grace to that woman
[1:53:39] yeah but you get believers today there
[1:53:42] are so self-righteous as I said that
[1:53:44] criticized this they're criticized that
[1:53:46] criticized people out there in that
[1:53:48] church that church that should just Lord
[1:53:50] neither with the Lord move on plead that
[1:53:52] plead the token as I said if the power
[1:53:56] of God were to come back he wouldn't he
[1:53:58] wouldn't at all focus on denominations
[1:54:03] he be preaching against Messi's churches
[1:54:08] they meant oh yeah he would because of
[1:54:12] such a change in and and he's brought
[1:54:14] that out he was experienced it even in
[1:54:16] this day he says not like it used to be
[1:54:19] and he began to see even the older ones
[1:54:23] losing losing their experience losing
[1:54:26] the anointing there was none like it
[1:54:28] used to be sin
[1:54:28] oh yeah he brought that out even even in
[1:54:32] Brenham tabernacle god help us
[1:54:40] brother we had to be convinced they had
[1:54:46] concerned there with me I've been about
[1:54:51] an hour sorry we're see how far we get
[1:55:00] it seems like we're not gonna finish it
[1:55:03] Matthew agrees amen
[1:55:08] Oh somebody else agreed with an amen
[1:55:12] amen
[1:55:16] well brother see I said the pastor comes
[1:55:23] out well Lord I'm gonna read this I got
[1:55:25] this cursor here I'll read the scripture
[1:55:26] and then I'll go into the coach that's
[1:55:27] it you know that's that's that's our
[1:55:30] thoughts but when he takes over yeah he
[1:55:35] got other things to say any matter
[1:55:38] well to God be the glory we're gonna
[1:55:41] have don't have patience with me at
[1:55:43] patience for the Lord amen and the
[1:55:47] message on the conveyancing concern and
[1:55:52] really I've been meditating on it
[1:55:55] through the week and Lord what am I
[1:55:57] gonna minister on I said I I feel a
[1:55:59] minister on these soft these thoughts
[1:56:01] these thoughts and I don't know what it
[1:56:03] is until finally this came up convinced
[1:56:06] being concerned
[1:56:07] oh I said that's right Laurie that's
[1:56:10] right that's that's that's the that's
[1:56:13] why you've been giving me these thoughts
[1:56:15] as a saucer to focus on this so the
[1:56:21] thing of it is are you convinced if you
[1:56:24] are really convinced in your heart
[1:56:26] you'll be concerned for the resurrection
[1:56:31] for the rapture if you're really
[1:56:33] convinced in your heart you're going to
[1:56:35] be concerned to reflect to reflect
[1:56:37] Christ to others any man
[1:56:40] there'll be a witness to others by the
[1:56:43] grace of God a man and he he took his
[1:56:49] text from John chapter one concerning
[1:56:55] the next day Jesus stood and two of his
[1:56:57] disciples and looking upon Jesus as he
[1:57:00] walked
[1:57:01] pijo he said behold the lamb of god and
[1:57:04] the two disciples toward him speak heard
[1:57:09] him speak and they followed Jesus and
[1:57:11] then Jesus turned and saw them following
[1:57:14] and said unto them what Sikhi and they
[1:57:17] said rabbi which being interpreted
[1:57:20] master where dwellest thou see what
[1:57:24] seeking like the power of God said I
[1:57:26] quoted I think the last message father
[1:57:29] God said they call Lord he said they're
[1:57:31] calling me to come they want to come see
[1:57:33] me in the hotel he said do they want to
[1:57:36] see me and meet me or do they want to
[1:57:38] meet Jesus most wanted to meet brother
[1:57:43] Branham amen brother
[1:57:46] is not meeting you he's meeting Jesus
[1:57:51] amen brother they got to recognize
[1:57:54] Christ in you as I said back maybe 90 70

[1:58:47] Christian I said well I said thank you I
[1:58:51] said I said well I said to God be the
[1:58:54] glory I said it's not me it's Christ
[1:58:57] Wallace I know I know
[1:58:59] then he might have been he might have
[1:59:01] been an American soldier at the time and
[1:59:05] I said well do they recognize you as a
[1:59:08] Christian or just a religious person
[1:59:13] there's a difference they know there
[1:59:16] because I work with religious people and
[1:59:19] they were just religion this religion
[1:59:22] that religion but then there was very
[1:59:24] very few that I met that were Christian
[1:59:27] they they weren't there representing a
[1:59:29] this denomination that denomination but
[1:59:32] they were everything the Church of God
[1:59:34] amen by the grace of god oh my god elvis
[1:59:41] jesus they come and see and they came in
[1:59:43] saw where he dwelt and abode with him
[1:59:45] that day for it was about the tenth hour
[1:59:47] and one of the two heard John speak and
[1:59:50] followed him was Andrew simon Peters
[1:59:52] brother and his first fine
[1:59:56] he first finds his brother Simon and
[1:59:59] said unto Him we have found the Messiah
[2:00:01] which is being interpreted the Christ
[2:00:03] and he brought him to Jesus and when
[2:00:06] Jesus bailed him he said thou art Simon
[2:00:08] the son of Jonah and thou shalt be
[2:00:11] called Cephas which is by interpretation
[2:00:12] of stone and then he said now he said I
[2:00:17] want to preach on two words he's a
[2:00:21] convinced concerned a man
[2:00:29] and now he said that we are now seeing a
[2:00:33] great cooling off around the nation what
[2:00:36] would he say today I pray God's grace to
[2:00:43] the the Muslims that out that were
[2:00:47] killed in New Zealand 49 some gunmen
[2:00:54] went in and shot them all now I agree
[2:00:57] with New Zealand and I understand that
[2:01:00] Australian leaders took when it comes to
[2:01:03] best before all this happened regarding
[2:01:07] the Muslims that were coming into their
[2:01:08] country and God would honor the honor
[2:01:12] the honor of the leaders for that for
[2:01:14] further stand they took and what are
[2:01:17] they - what stand they take they took
[2:01:19] their stand for Christ god help us take
[2:01:24] our stand for Christ but now they
[2:01:27] weren't there to condemn the Muslims
[2:01:30] they weren't there to condemn the Arabs
[2:01:32] they just said now listen you are
[2:01:35] welcome to come here you're welcome to
[2:01:38] live here and you can practice your
[2:01:39] faith here but please understand that as
[2:01:44] Christians that we're respecting and
[2:01:46] believing on the Lord Jesus Christ that
[2:01:48] we're not going to compromise our faith
[2:01:51] for your faith and please don't expect
[2:01:56] us to compromise and if you're not
[2:01:59] pleased with that then you'll add to go
[2:02:01] back to your own country but he said if
[2:02:06] you're satisfied with Christianity and
[2:02:09] you don't mind us practicing our
[2:02:10] Christianity then then it says you can
[2:02:13] stay and practice your faith and of
[2:02:16] course they stayed and they practice
[2:02:18] their faith but at the same time they
[2:02:20] referenced and respect the Christian
[2:02:22] respect to the Christians thank God for
[2:02:25] the leaders like that would to God we
[2:02:26] have leaders like that here in Canada
[2:02:28] would they God their leaders like that
[2:02:30] in America they want to compromise god
[2:02:34] help us brother don't compromise for the
[2:02:35] man on the message know what we believe
[2:02:40] the message but we have a right spirit
[2:02:41] and right attitude but we're not going
[2:02:43] to
[2:02:43] we're gonna stay with the truth amen and
[2:02:47] he said when I first started out there
[2:02:50] was a lot of tinsel in the meetings and
[2:02:52] people were in praying prayer meetings
[2:02:55] everywhere
[2:02:56] he said papers criticize me and he's a
[2:02:59] one woman drove 3,000 miles in a taxicab
[2:03:02] just to get to the meeting in Canada
[2:03:08] 3,000 miles in a taxicab today they want
[2:03:14] her to go around the corner
[2:03:17] where's giving Jesus preeminence see the
[2:03:21] thing of it is not convinced if you're
[2:03:25] convinced you're concerned any man
[2:03:30] you're concerned for Christ is not
[2:03:32] convinced Oh William Branham was the
[2:03:34] prophet and we never Bennett was this
[2:03:35] and that was the truth that was was what
[2:03:38] but but what is by the grace of God amen
[2:03:45] he said one woman drove 3,000 miles in a
[2:03:49] taxicab just to get the means in Canada
[2:03:51] how can I manage that convinced he said
[2:03:57] they are not concerned any more and it
[2:04:01] seems like there is more become falling
[2:04:04] away and seem like there's not much
[2:04:06] concern to and as much as they should be
[2:04:11] very little concern and it is even in
[2:04:15] the night and they don't have that
[2:04:17] concern even run the message now know
[2:04:21] very few he said back then he said they
[2:04:28] just couldn't rest until they received
[2:04:31] the Holy Ghost but they're not that
[2:04:34] concern anymore
[2:04:35] the revival fires are dying down amen
[2:04:39] that's the truth there is something
[2:04:41] wrong somewhere he says still doing the
[2:04:44] same thing still the same gospel I have
[2:04:47] never changed a bit I started I just
[2:04:50] started with
[2:04:51] naked bare word of God and I stayed
[2:04:54] right on it ever since I can't take it
[2:04:57] back it's God's Word
[2:04:58] and if I say it just like it said here
[2:05:02] the next time I had to say the same
[2:05:04] thing because here is the way it's wrote
[2:05:07] but it looks like there is not enough
[2:05:10] concern because they're not convinced
[2:05:15] one time people were absolutely
[2:05:17] thoroughly completely concerned because
[2:05:24] they were convinced because I told our
[2:05:27] brother Billy Paul when we went down to
[2:05:30] visit him a couple of years ago and he
[2:05:36] was expressing appreciation for all that
[2:05:38] we've done and I said brother I'll be
[2:05:40] honest I said we lived our lives for the
[2:05:42] gospel we lived our lives for the body
[2:05:45] of Christ I said long weekends and
[2:05:48] holidays I said was an opportunity for
[2:05:52] us to fellowship with the Saints go and
[2:05:55] do this go and do that go and do
[2:05:57] something else I said that's all we live
[2:05:59] for by the grace of God how many are
[2:06:04] living for that dad today not many know
[2:06:12] how many gonna lay down their lives for
[2:06:14] Jesus as he laid down his life for them
[2:06:16] nothing yeah you lay down your life for
[2:06:21] one another you're there to help this
[2:06:24] brother help this sister help this one
[2:06:26] help that one yeah he's here administer
[2:06:30] this one minister that one praise the
[2:06:31] Lord hallelujah
[2:06:32] encourage them in the Lord that's right
[2:06:36] but today the spirit world is on the
[2:06:39] people and oh it's a long weekend where
[2:06:44] are we going where where's the nearest
[2:06:48] church
[2:06:50] Oh where's the believers Oh we'll go
[2:06:53] there amen praise the Lord
[2:06:57] that's what Jesus did and if we're
[2:06:59] convinced we will be concerned for one
[2:07:02] another any man if some of you want he's
[2:07:07] lost the love of God not many got the
[2:07:13] love of God no no
[2:07:16] so he said looks like there's not enough
[2:07:18] concern and I wonder why he said why
[2:07:21] isn't there a concern there like it used
[2:07:23] to be I believe the reason that it that
[2:07:26] if there's not much as much concern as
[2:07:29] there used to be they're not as
[2:07:30] convinced as they used to be you ready
[2:07:34] to be convinced before you can be
[2:07:37] concerned and he said you know what I
[2:07:39] believe I believe that the people is not
[2:07:42] convinced that Jesus is coming soon
[2:07:46] they're living too much for this world
[2:07:49] that's right not convinced God Elvis
[2:07:54] that's the truth they're convinced that
[2:07:59] God sent a prophet they're convinced
[2:08:02] that William Brown did this he had this
[2:08:04] sign this signed and this these wonders
[2:08:06] he could discern the thoughts and
[2:08:07] intents of the heart but they're not
[2:08:11] convinced that Jesus is here they're not
[2:08:14] convinced that the brightest called out
[2:08:15] to be united with Jesus they're not
[2:08:18] convinced that we're getting ready
[2:08:19] getting ready to go to the marriage
[2:08:22] summer no no God Elvis
[2:08:30] he said I believe the beaver does not
[2:08:32] convinced that Jesus is coming soon and
[2:08:35] a lot of believers are not convinced
[2:08:37] they're not living like it they don't
[2:08:41] live like they believe Jesus is coming
[2:08:43] or Jesus has come and now we're going
[2:08:45] home
[2:08:46] by grace I don't believe they're
[2:08:49] convinced that he is coming in this age
[2:08:51] I believe that's the reason that they're
[2:08:54] not concerned because they're not fully
[2:08:56] convinced that's right they're not
[2:08:58] convinced that he's with them
[2:09:00] and if they were they would come back to
[2:09:02] the word and this was 1962 and this was
[2:09:07] a few months before the opening of the
[2:09:09] seals and what the Lord descending from
[2:09:12] heaven with a shout in the cloud of
[2:09:14] angels this was June and in February he
[2:09:18] came down in the cloud of angels and it
[2:09:20] was 1933 that he came down in the pillar
[2:09:22] fire a man he said how many people might
[2:09:27] misunderstand it love love is discipline
[2:09:31] you must discipline the people if you
[2:09:35] love them and he's referring to the
[2:09:37] ministry he said why he says you've got
[2:09:43] to be convinced first that it is God and
[2:09:45] then you know where you're standing it's
[2:09:49] true convinced first then you get
[2:09:51] concerned although people claim that God
[2:09:54] is with them and he said but he said
[2:09:57] mother used to say actions speak louder
[2:09:59] than words certainly it does you must
[2:10:04] act it believe it be convinced and then
[2:10:07] you'll be concerned amen by the grace of
[2:10:10] God are your actions speaking the truth
[2:10:20] amen
[2:10:22] your actions there's going to be a
[2:10:23] testimony a reflection of your faith
[2:10:26] yeah and he said that's what's the
[2:10:31] matter tonight people are not couldn't
[2:10:34] listen people are not convinced of the
[2:10:38] message amazing
[2:10:43] people are not convinced about the Holy
[2:10:45] Ghost
[2:10:46] if you really get convinced then you're
[2:10:50] concerned and you'll do everything you
[2:10:52] can what you've got to do with it you'll
[2:10:57] do it well brother Bentham I'm not a
[2:11:01] preacher but still you got something to
[2:11:04] do yeah
[2:11:08] don't leave everything to the preacher
[2:11:12] no no believers back years ago oh my
[2:11:17] they were witnessing they were
[2:11:18] testifying they were gone you know Joan
[2:11:20] right spirit right attitude
[2:11:22] oh yeah reflecting Jesus Jesus they
[2:11:27] talked to Jesus morning noon and night
[2:11:29] that's right yeah and they loved the
[2:11:35] fellowship of the Saints morning noon
[2:11:37] and night listen he said one time we had
[2:11:41] a meeting just be a few moments and he
[2:11:46] said there was a farmer got saved and
[2:11:50] filled with the Holy Ghost and he only
[2:11:53] had nothing but his experience and
[2:11:58] that's right all he had was his
[2:12:05] experience with the baptism of the holy
[2:12:06] ghost and a truck that's all he had but
[2:12:13] he holds so many to the meeting in his
[2:12:17] truck
[2:12:18] it says he got thirty more filled with
[2:12:22] the Holy Ghost a man he was there
[2:12:28] so for God to use yeah are you there for
[2:12:32] God to use when God wants to use you and
[2:12:35] how God wants to use you even those
[2:12:38] young people yeah I'm a sinner saved by
[2:12:44] grace
[2:12:46] I remember one time that I was walking
[2:12:52] down the road the gravel roads then he
[2:12:55] had Middlebrook it's called gamble now
[2:12:59] and there are a lot of young people that
[2:13:04] we associated with and played with now
[2:13:06] just a young man and young boy nothing
[2:13:10] boy and I was coming there's a journal
[2:13:14] come here well what's the problem what
[2:13:21] is it oh he said we want you to say this
[2:13:24] I said what no I said I'm not gonna they
[2:13:29] wanted me to swear and take the name of
[2:13:33] God in vain I said no way I said that's
[2:13:36] that's up to you as your choices as if
[2:13:39] you want to do it but I said I'm not
[2:13:40] gonna do it because that we were true
[2:13:43] that's the way we were trained as
[2:13:44] children oh yeah
[2:13:47] so wasn't that I was much of a Christian
[2:13:50] or any God but we did go to church you

[2:14:02] service on Sunday morning then we had
[2:14:03] Sunday school Sunday afternoon and we
[2:14:05] had service on the night yeah and now
[2:14:09] the the the gathering together of
[2:14:11] believers even and Christians is getting
[2:14:14] less and less and less and you know also
[2:14:17] that many many Christians are leaving
[2:14:19] churches as that lady told me in her
[2:14:22] church that she said there's nobody
[2:14:24] under 50 in our church anymore she said
[2:14:28] I used to be the - she used to be a
[2:14:30] teacher Sunday school teacher but she
[2:14:32] says no one teach anymore she says no
[2:14:35] one goes and most every denomination
[2:14:38] odors like it and now messy stretchers
[2:14:41] are getting like it I thank God for our
[2:14:43] young people here God mom and dad please
[2:14:48] keep encouraging your daughter's your
[2:14:50] sons concerning Jesus concerning the end
[2:14:54] concerning the resurrection because
[2:14:55] during the rapture
[2:14:56] concerning the judgment that's coming on
[2:14:58] the war
[2:14:59] this is not the world that we lived in
[2:15:02] 50 years ago no no it's worse
[2:15:06] as I said it changed every so many years
[2:15:09] and then I've recognized the change
[2:15:10] every ten years and every five years
[2:15:12] than every year then every few weeks now
[2:15:15] every day is changing oh god help us
[2:15:22] please in the name of Jesus whatever you
[2:15:27] got used for the glory of God see what
[2:15:30] you can do for God amen what can I do
[2:15:33] for you today Lord Lord maybe help this
[2:15:37] person help that person you know help
[2:15:39] that person are you but Jesus would ya
[2:15:43] don't be self-righteous because of the
[2:15:47] eyes of God that person again might be
[2:15:48] more righteous than we are
[2:15:50] oh yeah their attitude their spirit
[2:15:55] we're there to help one another pray for
[2:15:58] one another encourage one another not
[2:16:01] just believers but even someone out
[2:16:02] there it's like one time that my my aunt
[2:16:06] she'd gone to a denomination and she was
[2:16:10] dying and she called me on the phone and
[2:16:14] she was at the time she was living not
[2:16:16] believing in Alberto with with family
[2:16:18] and she called me on the phone and and
[2:16:21] she said Gerald she said she was on her
[2:16:24] Baudette bed in a member of the family's
[2:16:28] home and she said Joe
[2:16:30] she said that won't be much longer she
[2:16:32] said no but I'll be gone she said I'm
[2:16:35] going on going none to be with the Lord
[2:16:37] but she said Joe she said I want you to
[2:16:41] speak at my funeral it was in a
[2:16:47] denominational Church and she said just
[2:16:49] to let you know this
[2:16:51] she said take as long as you want she
[2:16:54] said I won't know nothing about it
[2:16:57] she said it won't bother me because when
[2:17:02] I had I had spoken at a at a previous
[2:17:04] funeral of a family member and I only
[2:17:07] spoke 3035 minutes
[2:17:09] and that and and there were people they
[2:17:12] were complaining oh yeah
[2:17:15] if they complain for 35 minutes how much
[2:17:18] are you gonna complain for hour and a
[2:17:20] half yeah and and just 35 minutes and
[2:17:25] they were complaining and and I even
[2:17:26] heard at one point they said how much
[2:17:28] longer is he gonna be you know because
[2:17:32] but and and my my aunt she's married to
[2:17:36] my father's brother she heard it and she
[2:17:41] said take as long as you want it won't
[2:17:43] bother me but it bothers people today
[2:17:47] yeah thank God for our brother Eugene
[2:17:51] here certainly they did travel a long
[2:17:53] ways a man it's a long distance so God
[2:17:59] God blessed them and God will he will
[2:18:02] this is not in vain this is not a formal
[2:18:05] godliness no this is this is putting God
[2:18:09] first by the grace of God and he's our
[2:18:13] this man he suggests that his experience
[2:18:15] yet an experience he was convinced and
[2:18:17] he was concerned hallelujah and he said
[2:18:22] but he also many to the meeting he got
[2:18:25] more than 50 or 30 more rather filled
[2:18:28] with the Holy Ghost he was convinced and
[2:18:31] when he was convinced he was concerned
[2:18:33] and they were and he said we're
[2:18:36] convinced that Jesus is coming soon we
[2:18:38] will be concerned about our lost our
[2:18:43] lost ones will be doing all we can to
[2:18:47] get the gospel out listen reflect Christ
[2:18:51] if you're gonna reflect anything to your
[2:18:53] family your friends and neighbors
[2:18:55] reflect Jesus a right spirit and a right
[2:18:57] attitude and in brother behind it is the
[2:19:01] love of God because as I said oh this
[2:19:06] one got faith to do this they understand
[2:19:07] this mystery this mystery what a Bible
[2:19:09] says you can understand the mysteries
[2:19:11] you can know all this you can know that
[2:19:14] but if you don't have faith he said it's
[2:19:16] all in vain you got a head if you don't
[2:19:20] have divine love rather it's all in me
[2:19:23] he's now abideth Faith Hope and divine
[2:19:25] love and the greatest of these is love
[2:19:28] it's gotta be motivated by divine love
[2:19:31] it was divine law projected grace grace
[2:19:34] projected the faith the revelation so
[2:19:37] you got to have that you got to come
[2:19:38] along but there's too many it's all
[2:19:40] intellectual but there's a few they got
[2:19:44] the Spirit of Christ and it's you you
[2:19:46] love them you want them to hear the word
[2:19:48] you want them to be saved by the grace
[2:19:51] of God God knows who they are
[2:19:54] God knows where they are be led by the
[2:19:58] spirit hallelujah
[2:20:00] see he was convinced and he used his
[2:20:05] truck for the glory of God to bring
[2:20:07] those people to the meetings amen and if
[2:20:16] we're convinced that Jesus is coming
[2:20:17] soon we'll be concerned about our lost
[2:20:20] ones and we'll be doing all we can to
[2:20:22] get the gospel out as Jacob stayed all
[2:20:26] night one night wrestling wrestling
[2:20:29] wrestling that prince and he wrestled
[2:20:33] all night and he had been dodging Esau
[2:20:36] ear and there he's scared to death of
[2:20:39] him and the early saw was coming and he
[2:20:42] put his wife across the brook and went
[2:20:44] over on the other side and knelt down
[2:20:46] and you know God come down and got a
[2:20:48] hole of Jacob and they wrestled all
[2:20:50] night and he wasn't completely convinced
[2:20:53] to start with but by the time that God
[2:20:56] got through with him
[2:20:57] he was convinced hallelujah and
[2:21:02] sometimes things happen in our lives and
[2:21:04] his God is convincing us any man of our
[2:21:09] calling God is convincing up as of his
[2:21:12] love amen
[2:21:14] and his respect for us and looking for
[2:21:17] our respect for him
[2:21:20] convinced then concerned Amen hallelujah
[2:21:24] praise the name of the Lord he said you
[2:21:31] might be convinced about psychology but
[2:21:33] you have to get knee ology he said I
[2:21:36] don't care about education I'm convinced
[2:21:39] that Jesus Christ is the son of God I'm
[2:21:42] convinced this is the Holy Ghost I'm
[2:21:44] convinced he's the healer I'm convinced
[2:21:46] that Easter Savior I'm convinced he's
[2:21:49] coming I'm convinced this is that he
[2:21:52] said I'm convinced he said I believe it
[2:21:56] so he said are you convinced about
[2:21:58] getting his word out to the rest of them
[2:22:00] they were convinced and that was a good
[2:22:03] sign that they were convinced because
[2:22:05] they wanted to reflect the word get it
[2:22:08] out to the elderly brothers not our
[2:22:10] religion it's Jesus it's what Jesus has
[2:22:15] done it's not just focusing on doctrine
[2:22:18] and the letter of the word for the
[2:22:19] realms and what we need is the dynamics
[2:22:22] he's too pretty too much focuses on on
[2:22:24] the on the mechanics but not the
[2:22:26] dynamics we need the dynamics of the
[2:22:29] word he said and he knew that people
[2:22:31] were just getting caught up with dr. dr.
[2:22:33] dr. doctrine but they never had the Holy
[2:22:35] Ghost amen to go and live the life of
[2:22:38] Christ oh god help us Oh God looking for
[2:22:41] us to believe this believe this yeah we
[2:22:43] believe it and if we do we're gonna be
[2:22:46] concerned about God and His Word and
[2:22:47] he's playing for our lives praises the
[2:22:51] Lord amen
[2:22:58] he said the Roman soldier the Centurion
[2:23:03] he said he was convinced if he could
[2:23:05] only get Jesus to say the word he said
[2:23:08] listen to that soldier a Roman Gentile
[2:23:10] heathen and he said I'm a man under
[2:23:13] authority I say to this one go here go
[2:23:16] there and I say to this one come and he
[2:23:18] comes
[2:23:18] why he was over him he was testifying
[2:23:21] Jesus you're all over all diseases
[2:23:25] you're over at all and if I could just
[2:23:28] ear you say the word my servant will
[2:23:30] live amen
[2:23:32] and many of us got that they speak the
[2:23:35] word only and after all of that we still
[2:23:41] don't be convinced what was that Jesus
[2:23:44] said that was great faith he didn't find
[2:23:47] that in Israel just speak the word here
[2:23:49] it is right now and he said when thou
[2:23:52] pray believe that you receive what you
[2:23:54] asked for and you shall have it if you
[2:23:57] say to this mountain be moved and don't
[2:23:59] doubt in your heart but believe that
[2:24:01] what God said will come to pass you can
[2:24:03] have what he said what a tremendous
[2:24:05] promise thought Elvis amen
[2:24:12] I'll have to stop right there right here
[2:24:18] brother god help us
[2:24:25] the Prophet said the Spirit of God
[2:24:29] working in men makes men act like God he
[2:24:34] said no wonder jesus said is not a
[2:24:36] Tritton ye are gods and if they called
[2:24:40] him God on to whom the Spirit of God
[2:24:42] came how can you condemn them me then
[2:24:46] when I'm a son of God if you could see
[2:24:49] the Spirit of God in Moses which he was
[2:24:52] God Moses was a God Joseph was a God the
[2:24:56] prophets were gods the Bible said they
[2:24:58] were and they were God's because if they
[2:25:01] had completely surrendered themselves to
[2:25:03] the Spirit of God that they were working
[2:25:06] for the glory of God and now is to let
[2:25:09] this go real deep under the fifth rib
[2:25:11] on the lifts left side when a man is
[2:25:14] anointed of the Spirit of God is Abbot's
[2:25:16] is actions and everything is God moving
[2:25:19] in him amen and sometimes he's misjudged
[2:25:25] he said action speaks louder than words
[2:25:28] that's right no matter what we say with
[2:25:31] our lips our actions prove what really
[2:25:34] is in our heart
[2:25:37] amen whether or not we're convinced
[2:25:40] yeah we're concerned evidence were
[2:25:46] convinced I believe the hours come I
[2:25:51] disagree with these big schools of
[2:25:53] theology building today he said we are
[2:25:55] talking about the coming of the Lord
[2:25:57] right at an and building big schools and
[2:26:00] everything why he said our own actions
[2:26:02] speak louder than our words how could we
[2:26:04] be putting so much in buildings and so
[2:26:06] forth and great schools and so forth and
[2:26:09] saying the Lord is coming do we really
[2:26:14] believe it or listen to this I'll finish
[2:26:19] with this quote he said bless your heart
[2:26:21] sister he said now I am a total stranger
[2:26:24] to you
[2:26:25] he said we are years in difference in
[2:26:28] our ARH I don't know you I have never
[2:26:32] seen you and we're just two people met
[2:26:35] here on earth but you are a Christian
[2:26:38] you are a believer because the reason I
[2:26:44] know that is the feeling of your spirit

[2:26:51] you're a Christian amen and he said you
[2:26:56] have welcomed me amen that's right
[2:27:03] praise the Lord there are believers that
[2:27:06] you can have fellowship with and you

[2:28:03] believer will sense it and another
[2:28:06] believer what sets it

[2:28:09] your presence and if you don't have the
[2:28:14] Holy Ghost
[2:28:14] then the believer won't feel welcome all
[2:28:19] brothers sister that's why we all love
[2:28:21] to go to brother Burgess and sister
[2:28:23] Burns's back years ago and not only that
[2:28:26] not only believers but even
[2:28:29] denominational people and if people that
[2:28:31] weren't Christian they loved to go into
[2:28:35] brother and sister Burns's house because
[2:28:37] of the atmosphere yeah and not only
[2:28:40] adults but there was children young boys
[2:28:43] and young girls that love to go in and
[2:28:46] sit down in the kitchen in brother
[2:28:48] Barnes's house sister purposes was
[2:28:50] disposed sister burns why because of the
[2:28:52] atmosphere the peace the rest of God
[2:28:57] that was there and you know that about
[2:28:59] the Pentecostal couple and sister burns
[2:29:03] prayed and it's child was delivered on
[2:29:05] the spirit the child had that spirit
[2:29:10] honor and sister Burns follow the
[2:29:13] leadership of the Holy Ghost
[2:29:15] hallelujah how are we in the spirit like
[2:29:19] she was when she was slicing bread she
[2:29:21] was getting the couple of lunch
[2:29:23] they were Pentecostals she was getting
[2:29:26] the melange slicing the bread when she
[2:29:28] heard the child swearing
[2:29:30] and she laid down the knife my Walken
[2:29:33] see sister birds now lay down the knife
[2:29:37] moved out of her Hall or pantry cross
[2:29:41] her kitchen into the hallway and the
[2:29:44] child was there she didn't wait she
[2:29:48] spoke the word how do I know you
[2:29:51] she spoke the word speak the word she
[2:29:55] said Satan she said in the name of Jesus
[2:29:59] Christ I rebuke you come out of the
[2:30:02] child a man that was it
[2:30:06] but back into her pantry and some time
[2:30:10] later that couple came back again and
[2:30:12] visited the brothers sister burns just
[2:30:14] let you know she said the child hasn't
[2:30:17] sworn since brother that's the grace of
[2:30:28] God amen convinced and concerned and she
[2:30:35] went and spoke the word Speak the word
[2:30:38] only and my servant shall be healed he
[2:30:41] said I just think that's the soldier had
[2:30:46] that concern for his servant it wasn't a
[2:30:49] son or a daughter a brother or sister a
[2:30:52] servant he didn't tell the servant wha
[2:30:58] I get it no I guess nobody else no he
[2:31:00] went to Jesus speak the word only I'm
[2:31:05] what a revelation well water revelation
[2:31:09] was convinced he was a Gentile he was
[2:31:12] convinced concerning who Jesus was and
[2:31:14] the authority and the power that had a
[2:31:17] man God it was rather that we are they
[2:31:20] were convinced we have that revelation
[2:31:23] where we are absolutely convinced and
[2:31:26] we're concerned Speak the word only get
[2:31:29] thee behind me Satan in the name of the
[2:31:32] Lord Jesus Christ because Satan is is on
[2:31:35] your heels every day amen god help us
[2:31:41] is my prayer amen and it says your
[2:31:46] action speaks aloud he said it drowns
[2:31:48] your voice so brother sister this makes
[2:31:52] sure that we're reflecting the word by
[2:31:56] the grace of God and he said I'm
[2:32:03] convinced that he's the same yesterday
[2:32:04] today and forever I'm convinced in the
[2:32:07] ministry and the message I'm preaching
[2:32:09] I'm convinced that it's the truth I'm
[2:32:11] convinced that these visions come from
[2:32:13] God
[2:32:13] I'm convinced that we are living in the
[2:32:15] last days I'm convinced that this very
[2:32:18] spirit that's on you now is the Holy
[2:32:21] Ghost I am fairly convinced that the
[2:32:24] Holy Ghost is right he convinced that
[2:32:27] the Bible is so is the truth I'm
[2:32:29] convinced that this is Jesus Christ here
[2:32:32] now and I'm convinced that he'll heal
[2:32:35] evil every sick person in a moment and
[2:32:38] in the twinkling of an eye I'm convinced
[2:32:41] he poured out the Holy Ghost upon here
[2:32:44] till there should be a shout to tell her
[2:32:47] there be such a shout till hard to to
[2:32:51] tell what would take place I'm convinced
[2:32:55] hallelujah he said I'm convinced that
[2:32:58] he's here now I'm convinced to Pillar
[2:33:01] fire as the same pillar of fire that was
[2:33:03] with Israel in the wilderness and it's
[2:33:06] the same pillar of fire with the church
[2:33:09] I'm convinced by the grace of God I
[2:33:13] trust we're convinced amen brother let's
[2:33:18] make sure that we're not indicted that
[2:33:22] we're not souls in prison and we're not
[2:33:25] false anointed ones at the end but we
[2:33:28] are the true anointed seed of God by the
[2:33:30] grace of God amen
[2:33:32] god bless you let's stay
[2:33:36] I could go on but it's quite a while
[2:33:46] well I'll share this with you they said
[2:33:56] that a boy asked his father he said dad
[2:34:01] how big is God
[2:34:07] my biggest gone and the father seen this
[2:34:12] as an opportunity to give a good lesson
[2:34:14] to his son and he said it depends to
[2:34:20] which the son answered with curiosity
[2:34:22] why looking to the sky his father saw an
[2:34:27] airplane and asked his son what size did
[2:34:32] he think that airplane was up there in
[2:34:36] the sky and the child replied very small
[2:34:41] he said it looks very small I can barely
[2:34:44] see it then the father took him to the
[2:34:48] airport and being close to the plane he
[2:34:52] asked his son now he said how big is the
[2:34:56] plane now
[2:34:57] and the boy replied very amazed he said
[2:35:02] dad it's huge he said wow he said it is
[2:35:07] so big then the father said son this is
[2:35:14] how God is for you his size will depend
[2:35:18] on the death distance that you have from
[2:35:22] him and likewise that will affect your
[2:35:25] view of him your concept of him and your
[2:35:29] experience with him he said how far have
[2:35:32] you put God the closer you are to God
[2:35:38] the bigger he will be in your life and
[2:35:41] your concept of him will be of a great
[2:35:44] awesome loving and power
[2:35:48] for god that he is a man if that is not
[2:35:55] how you see God right now maybe you need
[2:35:58] to get a little closer to the Lord a man
[2:36:03] to a lot of people God is small to a lot
[2:36:07] of evil goddess in the distance to a lot
[2:36:09] of people you can't hear his voice just
[2:36:13] a whisper
[2:36:14] well where's gone he's far away don't
[2:36:19] let him come closer you will hear his
[2:36:22] voice and you will see him a man again
[2:36:28] as the brother ministered here

[2:37:00] to it depends on who you're focusing on

[2:37:07] Satan is there to get your attention for
