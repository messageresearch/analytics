[1:08:57] amen by the grace of god how are we
[1:08:59] getting back
[1:09:00] yeah how we came back
[1:09:04] what god what god has ordained
[1:09:05] predestinated for to take us back
[1:09:07] we're part of it now amen because what
[1:09:10] god has done
[1:09:11] in the opening of the seven seals the
[1:09:13] revelation of the mystery of god
[1:09:14] is to the prophet highlighted it is to
[1:09:17] give us rapturing
[1:09:18] faith amen amen because he wants you to
[1:09:21] go home
[1:09:23] amen you will not just want you to go
[1:09:25] home because you you want to go home
[1:09:27] and he's here to respond to that and
[1:09:29] just like again
[1:09:30] i keep bringing back these examples of
[1:09:33] joshua and caleb
[1:09:34] oh my coming out of egypt with moses and
[1:09:36] all the others
[1:09:37] and all the others they were they were
[1:09:38] just satisfied with oh just this world
[1:09:42] they're satisfied well everything is
[1:09:43] fine here oh but they didn't like when
[1:09:45] they went into the into the promised
[1:09:46] land
[1:09:47] oh they were going not by faith but by
[1:09:50] sight
[1:09:51] yeah when they saw this i saw that oh my
[1:09:54] if we come in here they're going they're
[1:09:55] going to defeat us
[1:09:56] joshua caleb didn't believe that because
[1:09:58] they said if god before us
[1:10:00] who can be against us amen
[1:10:03] well i promise we got that revelation
[1:10:05] and we got the same hunger and thirst
[1:10:07] for eternity as joshua caleb for the
[1:10:09] promised land
[1:10:11] oh yeah brother even after even after 40
[1:10:14] years in the wilderness they were still
[1:10:15] hungry and still
[1:10:16] thirsting amen they were right there to
[1:10:17] lead another generation
[1:10:19] into the promised land because god had
[1:10:22] to take the other generation
[1:10:23] off the earth amen why because they
[1:10:26] because
[1:10:26] they were not believing they were not
[1:10:28] trusting god and that's certainly not
[1:10:29] like joshua and caleb
[1:10:31] no joshua and cater trusted god and
[1:10:32] again caleb and old man and he said well
[1:10:35] if god before us who can be against us
[1:10:37] amen brother this is not man this is god
[1:10:40] amen we're not under the ministry of a
[1:10:42] man under the ministry of god
[1:10:44] so god help us brother to believe god
[1:10:46] help us to press
[1:10:47] on by grace amen oh brother it is closer
[1:10:51] than what sometimes we we believe
[1:10:54] amen right amen because again
[1:10:58] we're not going to we're just going to
[1:10:59] go from step out of this dimension and
[1:11:01] do another one
[1:11:02] amen but i pray to god that he'll
[1:11:04] quicken the
[1:11:05] faith quicken the revelation that we
[1:11:08] have
[1:11:08] amen to the reality of eternity

[1:11:40] amen of the revealed word amen and
[1:11:43] through what
[1:11:44] and having the revelation what god is
[1:11:45] going to do amen as he
[1:11:47] he's pouring into us the revelation the
[1:11:50] revelation
[1:11:50] and the more we get into the word the
[1:11:52] word and us the more
[1:11:54] we're going to be separated from the
[1:11:55] world not interested in the world
[1:11:57] no no that's right not interested in the
[1:11:58] world oh people are too much caught up
[1:12:00] with this and this and this they're
[1:12:02] doing this they're doing this they're
[1:12:03] doing that
[1:12:04] but i'll tell you it's the election of
[1:12:05] god we're dead to all those things amen
[1:12:08] and we become alive to him amen
[1:12:11] alive to what he's doing more conscious
[1:12:13] of what he's doing
[1:12:14] and again don't be offended but again
[1:12:17] don't
[1:12:18] don't let your family your friends or
[1:12:20] your neighbors distract you
[1:12:22] you stay your relationship is to stay
[1:12:25] with the word
[1:12:26] amen and to get into the revelation of
[1:12:29] what
[1:12:29] god is doing and the devil is there to
[1:12:32] distract you

[1:14:07] him as he continues on
[1:14:09] amen and brother yeah we got to do it by
[1:14:12] faith
[1:14:13] oh yeah go trusting the lord because the
[1:14:15] prophet did say that god heals through
[1:14:17] medicine god he goes through doctors and
[1:14:19] so on and it's like there was that lady
[1:14:21] that sister that came into the
[1:14:23] into the prayer line one time with one
[1:14:25] of her children and and the proud of god
[1:14:27] told her this he said now he said you go
[1:14:28] out
[1:14:29] and he said something about a bus or
[1:14:31] something and and you go here go there
[1:14:33] he said when you get off he said there'd
[1:14:34] be a lady there sitting i'm not on the
[1:14:36] sidewalk
[1:14:37] amen and she'll greet you and she'll ask
[1:14:39] you this and while you're here and so on
[1:14:41] and you tell her
[1:14:42] and she'll say oh just think this is god
[1:14:45] revealing this to
[1:14:46] through the prophet for her need and he
[1:14:49] said she's going to tell you
[1:14:50] she said about a doctor they know who
[1:14:52] will look after this
[1:14:54] what oh we think oh god got to heal
[1:14:57] brother brown got a heal no no
[1:14:59] no no for some reason god a lot or maybe
[1:15:01] for our
[1:15:02] reason god allow amen great time to the
[1:15:05] end
[1:15:06] and he said always you just go to that
[1:15:07] doctor and he'll look after and he did
[1:15:10] and the child never had no problems
[1:15:11] after amen
[1:15:13] so brother god help us to have faith in
[1:15:16] god no matter what we're doing
[1:15:18] in those circumstances situations let's
[1:15:20] believe god
[1:15:22] amen we're trusting jesus amen lord if i

[1:15:29] me lord this is your leadership
[1:15:31] not my will father thine be done
[1:15:34] amen but there's too many seeking their
[1:15:36] own will and they want god to do this
[1:15:38] god to do that
[1:15:39] no no you do what god wants you to do
[1:15:43] amen and there's not many going around
[1:15:45] with that
[1:15:46] that that spirit of the will of god are
[1:15:49] they
[1:15:49] j just feel i'm going to do this and i
[1:15:51] believe god will bless me i do this god
[1:15:53] will bless me
[1:15:54] god's going to bless you with his will
[1:15:56] not my will father

[1:16:59] that that you got the same spirit and
[1:17:01] hunger and thirst and care and concern
[1:17:03] for one another
[1:17:04] amen just consider again that that when
[1:17:08] jesus was going here jesus was going
[1:17:09] there
[1:17:10] amen and then he oh yeah while they were
[1:17:13] in a certain place there in the city

[1:17:19] and they were moving on moving on and
[1:17:21] what was it they were carrying the body
[1:17:23] of a young man
[1:17:24] and they was a teenage man a boy again
[1:17:27] on the stretcher and behind was his
[1:17:29] mother weeping

[1:17:32] the cemetery
[1:17:33] amen and what did jesus do oh wait wait
[1:17:37] and he walked over and laid his hands on
[1:17:39] this on the young man and he came back

[1:17:49] care and concern for one another
[1:17:53] amen and you have that same care and
[1:17:55] concern for others out there
[1:17:56] and as i said keep your attitude right
[1:17:58] your spirit rate and i said
[1:17:59] brother i've been fighting this spirit
[1:18:01] ever since i come to the message and
[1:18:03] again i
[1:18:03] i violated a number of times recently
[1:18:05] saying that the first
[1:18:06] sermon that i preach was was exhorting
[1:18:09] the people keep your attitude right
[1:18:11] keep your spirit right don't you point
[1:18:13] your fingers at that person up there
[1:18:15] and say oh they're they're this church
[1:18:16] they're that church listen
[1:18:18] brother the grace of god to us is the
[1:18:20] grace of god to them
[1:18:21] and the prophet of god said as long as
[1:18:23] the bride is on the earth he said there
[1:18:25] be grace
[1:18:26] amen so we're going to show grace by the
[1:18:29] grace of god
[1:18:30] grace for us we want grace for them
[1:18:33] exactly
[1:18:34] you know you're not there to condemn
[1:18:36] them and send them to hell
[1:18:37] but there's a lot of believers i know
[1:18:38] brother over the years i've heard those
[1:18:40] sermons
[1:18:40] and they praised the praise and
[1:18:42] everybody out there was going to hell
[1:18:43] and the only ones going to heaven was it
[1:18:44] was them
[1:18:45] no no as i said this is bride
[1:18:49] and the proud of god warned us and
[1:18:50] highlighted us amen what he said now
[1:18:52] this message won't go to everybody no no
[1:18:55] but he said now the revelation of jesus
[1:18:58] as our lord and savior it will go around
[1:19:00] the world
[1:19:01] he said because it's going to go here
[1:19:02] and go there the bible says amen
[1:19:04] that's right and even after the bride is
[1:19:06] gone amen
[1:19:08] there there will be somebody with the
[1:19:09] witness of jesus and they lay down their
[1:19:12] lives for it in the tribute great
[1:19:13] tribulation
[1:19:14] amen so brother again many are because
[1:19:17] i've said many calls few chosen
[1:19:19] we're bright i trust we're the chosen
[1:19:21] amen but still there's going to be many
[1:19:23] called
[1:19:24] well if they're not where where did all
[1:19:26] those outside the city come from
[1:19:29] amen the new jerusalem because the bible
[1:19:32] the bible says new jerusalem the bride
[1:19:33] is going to be in there
[1:19:35] with the bridegroom amen and the bible
[1:19:38] speaks up again too
[1:19:39] there's thousands of thousands of
[1:19:40] thousands of thousands amen
[1:19:42] and millions amen that witness the
[1:19:45] uniting of the heavenly bridegroom and
[1:19:47] the earthly bride
[1:19:48] oh yeah they witnessed it and and they
[1:19:51] went
[1:19:52] the prophecy they went back to sleep
[1:19:53] again they're not lost
[1:19:56] and again remind me let me remind you
[1:19:58] again
[1:19:59] what when then when the the angel
[1:20:01] rebuked the prophet
[1:20:03] because he had a critical spirit
[1:20:04] concerning that girl
[1:20:06] walking the street wearing slacks he
[1:20:08] said don't you
[1:20:09] call her reggie or richards he said some
[1:20:11] of them are
[1:20:12] my children amen by the grace of god
[1:20:16] thank god for that hope amen that you
[1:20:19] can commit
[1:20:20] your family your sons your daughters
[1:20:22] your your friends your neighbors
[1:20:23] into the hands of god and move on amen
[1:20:26] because god do with all things well
[1:20:29] amen so keep our our spirit and our
[1:20:31] attitude right
[1:20:32] because i know there's a lot of
[1:20:33] believers that i that i've experienced
[1:20:36] over the years that got that con
[1:20:39] attitude to condemn to criticize to
[1:20:41] judge
[1:20:42] no brother sister we're going to judge
[1:20:44] we'll judge amen
[1:20:46] but the but again the problem of god
[1:20:48] when he was condemning that woman in the
[1:20:49] restaurant
[1:20:51] and the angel pulled him away he said
[1:20:53] come here
[1:20:54] and he went there and the angels told
[1:20:56] him this is you
[1:20:58] he said this is what you did because now
[1:21:01] you want to condemn her
[1:21:03] and he's a voice for jesus you be
[1:21:04] condemned amen
[1:21:07] we are all sinners saved by grace
[1:21:11] amen but some is is the elect
[1:21:14] bride so i pray grace in the name of
[1:21:16] jesus
[1:21:17] amen lord keep our spirits right in our
[1:21:20] attitude right jesus had a right spirit
[1:21:21] and right attitude
[1:21:23] even to the scribes and pharisees amen
[1:21:25] to god
[1:21:26] be the glory amen
[1:21:30] and again to thank our brother jonathan
[1:21:32] for ministering
[1:21:33] and filling in god bless you amen
[1:21:37] and uh also uh just to pray ask you to
[1:21:41] pray again for our brother ellsworth
[1:21:43] and sister ellsworth amen as that we
[1:21:45] continue with him through
[1:21:46] to the to the hospital and for the
[1:21:49] treatments that he's given

[1:21:54] amen and also you see
[1:22:01] let's see okay just be in prayer for the
[1:22:04] next few days because he's going to take
[1:22:06] a
[1:22:07] quite a few other trips to the hospital
[1:22:09] i think he's there for another couple of
[1:22:11] weeks
[1:22:11] amen to get all the treatments that they
[1:22:13] want to give him which is to be 28
[1:22:16] treatments of radiation so god be with
[1:22:19] us and our brother praise the lord
[1:22:21] our brother goes in comes out and he's
[1:22:23] fine
[1:22:25] you know he he's not burned there's not
[1:22:27] you don't feel this to feel that
[1:22:29] just move on amen and praise the lord
[1:22:33] amen do god be the glory
[1:22:37] amen also all right the lord bless us
[1:22:40] tonight we're going to hear a tape by
[1:22:42] the prophet and it's only i think
[1:22:44] 50 minutes or maybe less than that
[1:22:48] and uh its concerns
[1:22:52] easter what the world is celebrating
[1:22:56] and many will only really remember
[1:22:59] what jesus did on easter time
[1:23:03] and again there are those that don't
[1:23:05] know
[1:23:07] concerning easter because the emphasis
[1:23:09] is less and less emphasis put on easter
[1:23:12] amen so we pray the grace of god
[1:23:15] amen to the elect of god to the seed of
[1:23:17] god that we're going to remember
[1:23:19] calvary remember what he did for us
[1:23:22] by the grace of again it's like a
[1:23:24] somebody
[1:23:26] went and they were up you know maybe
[1:23:29] late teens early 20s
[1:23:31] and they just went to their grandmother
[1:23:34] and they said
[1:23:35] dan he said what
[1:23:38] what is easter all about
[1:23:41] and when his grandmother told me i said
[1:23:43] what he asked you that
[1:23:45] yes he said she said he
[1:23:49] he didn't know he and yet he was raised
[1:23:51] in a home so-called that believed in
[1:23:53] easter
[1:23:54] and believed this and believed that but
[1:23:56] they never put the answers on easter
[1:23:57] that that maybe mike
[1:23:59] his grandmother was and so he said oh he
[1:24:01] said i i just want to know what easter
[1:24:03] is all about he said
[1:24:05] he said they want to remember this and
[1:24:06] remember this remember that so what
[1:24:08] really happened
[1:24:09] and she had to explain to him what jesus
[1:24:11] did amen
[1:24:12] so that now he knows what happened
[1:24:14] easter now he's got the choice to accept
[1:24:16] it or reject it
[1:24:18] or ignore it don't ignore it please
[1:24:21] and don't ignore what god has done and
[1:24:23] don't ignore what god has been
[1:24:25] endeavoring to put our emphasis on
[1:24:27] amen why did god do what he did
[1:24:30] through william branham why did god do
[1:24:33] what he did and why is he doing what
[1:24:34] he's doing through you and me now
[1:24:36] brother it's for the resurrection and
[1:24:38] the rapture
[1:24:39] amen and brother he kept that that
[1:24:42] i said joshua and caleb had that hunger
[1:24:45] and that thirst
[1:24:46] for victory in the promised land amen
[1:24:50] and brother that's what would take them
[1:24:51] on and they would lead the younger
[1:24:53] generation on with them
[1:24:55] amen and as the prophet of god did did
[1:24:58] tell
[1:24:59] brother level i think and he said
[1:25:01] brother
[1:25:02] he said the older people around this
[1:25:04] message he said they'll go on to be with
[1:25:06] the lord
[1:25:06] he said they won't live up to the
[1:25:08] reserve up to the rapture
[1:25:10] they're there for the resurrection but
[1:25:11] they want because they wouldn't have
[1:25:13] that faith
[1:25:14] of the of the rapture god help us
[1:25:17] it's my prayer amen lord bless us and
[1:25:20] also
[1:25:21] sister colombo god bless you
[1:25:25] amen praise the lord and
[1:25:28] brother clumble not here
[1:25:32] anyway god bless brother colombo too and
[1:25:34] brother ellie
[1:25:35] and and the other members of the family
[1:25:37] praise the lord
[1:25:39] praise god lord bless us if you would
[1:25:43] would you turn with me to psalms chapter
[1:25:46] 22.
[1:25:53] psalms 22 and it is the scripture that
[1:25:56] brother branham
[1:25:57] read and preached on living
[1:26:01] dying buried
[1:26:05] rising coming
[1:26:08] and is the five attributes of the
[1:26:10] ministry of our lord jesus christ
[1:26:12] amen he was living he laid down his life
[1:26:16] died he was buried he rose again
[1:26:20] with the promise i'm coming back amen
[1:26:23] so that i trust by the grace of god we
[1:26:25] got the revelation of the promise
[1:26:27] he's come back amen because remember
[1:26:30] again the pillar of fire
[1:26:32] brother it's not willem brown it's god
[1:26:35] praise the name of the lord
[1:26:37] and even the sister one time that was
[1:26:39] laying in the hospital
[1:26:40] and uh and she was praying and she was
[1:26:43] praying for the lord to touch her
[1:26:44] a man and she had a picture there
[1:26:46] william branham with that pillar of fire
[1:26:48] and when she looked at it amen the
[1:26:51] pillar of fire
[1:26:52] come off the pitcher and over to her
[1:26:55] amen and she was healed praise the name
[1:26:59] of the lord hallelujah
[1:27:00] and the prophet has highlighted it he
[1:27:02] said that's not me that's him
[1:27:04] and again to remind ourselves again this
[1:27:06] right here
[1:27:07] the problem god said in 1964 65
[1:27:11] and he said see there he is he's looking
[1:27:13] down at us
[1:27:14] amen it was christ by the grace of god
[1:27:18] and others have highlighted the fact
[1:27:19] that this what we see here
[1:27:21] on the side they said that's william
[1:27:23] branham he's there because
[1:27:25] he was caught up in the presence of
[1:27:28] those angels that were coming down
[1:27:30] god of us to believe god help us
[1:27:33] to move on to the resurrection the
[1:27:36] rapture
[1:27:37] and again the responsibility lays in
[1:27:40] your lap
[1:27:41] because he said he said god is waiting
[1:27:45] on us
[1:27:46] amen and he said the dead in christ are
[1:27:49] waiting
[1:27:50] on us brother we feel responsible
[1:27:54] to the to these living family friends
[1:27:57] neighbors were living here living there
[1:27:59] oh i got to do this i got to do that
[1:28:01] yo what does jesus want you to do are
[1:28:03] you are we really doing
[1:28:05] what god's expecting from us and god
[1:28:07] wants in us
[1:28:09] amen that's right we we got
[1:28:12] we had to look down god looked down and
[1:28:14] see oh that person is getting he's not a
[1:28:16] he's a pilgrim and he's a stranger
[1:28:18] oh yeah he he's looking he
[1:28:21] looks like it he's acting like it he's
[1:28:23] living like it
[1:28:24] he always just here hey man
[1:28:28] he's just here and he's getting ready to
[1:28:30] go home
[1:28:31] amen i trust we're getting ready to go
[1:28:33] home
[1:28:34] amen where are you going what are you
[1:28:36] doing this for what are you living this
[1:28:37] way for
[1:28:38] well we're trying we're going we're
[1:28:40] going out of here so just in case
[1:28:43] just in case you don't do it god bless
[1:28:45] you amen i trust we'll meet you in glory
[1:28:48] amen but we've got to move on with that
[1:28:51] faith
[1:28:52] the lord bless you and again brother
[1:28:55] brown preached this message
[1:28:56] in march of 1959
[1:29:00] and i believe it might have been a
[1:29:01] sunrise service
[1:29:04] and so is living dying buried rising
[1:29:07] coming it's jesus amen
[1:29:11] and in psalms 22 and it's it's a lengthy
[1:29:14] psalm
[1:29:15] but the prophet of god read it all he
[1:29:17] read every verse
[1:29:19] and it says my god my god why hast thou
[1:29:22] forsaken me why art thou so
[1:29:25] far from helping me and from the words
[1:29:29] of my roaring oh my god i cry in the
[1:29:33] daytime
[1:29:34] but thou hearst not and in the night
[1:29:37] season
[1:29:38] and am not silent but thou art holy
[1:29:41] whole thou that inabilities the praises
[1:29:45] of israel
[1:29:46] our fathers trusted in thee
[1:29:49] they trusted and thou didst deliver them
[1:29:52] they cried unto thee and were delivered

[1:39:09] afraid of god no definitely not
[1:39:14] god is this god is that brother and this
[1:39:16] is like a
[1:39:17] when i was in in a certain sister's home
[1:39:19] one time
[1:39:20] or my grandfather was living there in
[1:39:22] that home and he came out and always
[1:39:24] said journal he had the scripture
[1:39:26] and he said girl he said i got a bible
[1:39:28] question i said what is it
[1:39:31] and he said oh the bible says that god
[1:39:33] is this i can't recall
[1:39:35] the exact word but it was describing
[1:39:36] what god was and the understanding that
[1:39:39] he had of that word
[1:39:40] was that oh my god was terrible god was
[1:39:44] this god was that
[1:39:45] does that brother he said gerald does
[1:39:47] that mean god is terrible
[1:39:49] and god is this god no i said that's
[1:39:52] displaying i said the righteousness of
[1:39:54] god the power of god
[1:39:56] amen and and i said this is what it
[1:39:58] means right there
[1:39:59] oh that's what he said oh thank you
[1:40:02] thank you
[1:40:02] and again and and again i was doing
[1:40:05] something in a house somewhere painting
[1:40:07] and then the door opened and then walked
[1:40:08] this gentleman and
[1:40:10] and he he he had become a a
[1:40:13] christian and he was in his 50s i say at
[1:40:16] the time
[1:40:16] and he didn't go to church that i know
[1:40:20] off
[1:40:20] but but eventually something touched him
[1:40:22] in his heart and his soul and he went to
[1:40:24] church
[1:40:24] and he went to an altar and he and he
[1:40:26] and he
[1:40:28] put himself in the hands of god as a
[1:40:30] christian amen
[1:40:32] and now he said and oh yeah he was born
[1:40:34] again
[1:40:35] you could tell that by the life he lived
[1:40:37] amen how he lived it
[1:40:39] and the ideas that he had now he was
[1:40:41] different
[1:40:42] now he was living for the lord but it's
[1:40:44] your journal
[1:40:45] i i got an answer i need an answer for
[1:40:48] this question
[1:40:49] and it concerns the lord's prayer and he
[1:40:51] said lord
[1:40:52] they said lead us not into deliver us
[1:40:55] from evil and lead us not into
[1:40:56] temptation
[1:40:57] and he said you mean to tell me that god
[1:41:00] leads us into temptation
[1:41:02] i said no i said brother that's that the
[1:41:05] the exact wording of that as it should
[1:41:07] be is asking god
[1:41:09] to deliver us from the tempter not lead
[1:41:12] us
[1:41:12] into temptation keep me away from the
[1:41:14] tempter and that's the devil
[1:41:16] oh he said thank you thank you this i'll
[1:41:20] never forget it
[1:41:21] he said that's good praise the lord
[1:41:23] it'll always be with me
[1:41:25] he said now i understand thank you and
[1:41:28] he walked out
[1:41:29] rejoicing and praising the lord amen
[1:41:33] that's the truth i wonder how many of us
[1:41:35] ever thought about that
[1:41:36] lead us not into temptation deliver us
[1:41:38] from evil i said deliver us
[1:41:40] no no i said god you're asking god to
[1:41:42] keep you from the devil's influence
[1:41:45] i said he's the one that put you in
[1:41:46] temptation he wanted to bring this
[1:41:48] temptation that temptation
[1:41:50] oh he said thank you now i understand
[1:41:52] amen
[1:41:54] praise the lord so he said for he hath
[1:41:57] done not despise
[1:41:59] nor abort the affliction of the
[1:42:00] afflicted neither hath he hid his face
[1:42:03] from him
[1:42:03] but when he cried unto him he heard

[1:46:15] and i finally usually struck the soul
[1:46:20] amen and god was in the soul amen
[1:46:23] and the anointing sucker and she said
[1:46:26] she turned turned away from the washer
[1:46:27] and she looked up and she said satan she

[1:47:31] scream

[1:47:35] she laid down the instruments she had in
[1:47:37] her hand
[1:47:38] and what she was doing and she turned
[1:47:40] and she walked out into the kitchen
[1:47:42] she walked toward the hallway that would
[1:47:44] lead to the living room

[1:47:49] and the trial was swearing and she said

[1:49:46] is what he has done from the foundation
[1:49:48] of the world
[1:49:49] by the grace of almighty god amen
[1:49:56] and is it still working
[1:50:00] pardon audio okay brother
[1:50:03] matthew has informed me that he got
[1:50:04] problems with the but we can't get it on
[1:50:07] the uh
[1:50:08] the screen here probably the machines
[1:50:10] back there
[1:50:11] so we're going to listen to the audio
[1:50:13] and it'll be about 45 minutes i think
[1:50:16] around there not
[1:50:17] not it's not this the the him the sermon
[1:50:20] rather is not long
[1:50:21] just a few pages so we and we're going
[1:50:23] to start
[1:50:24] after he uh after he read the scripture
[1:50:28] on
[1:50:28] on psalms 22 so the lord bless us amen
[1:50:31] and god bless
[1:50:33] the word in us amen for the glory of god
[1:50:37] amen
[1:50:38] lord bless you
[1:50:45] praise the lord
[1:50:57] just from a quotation of the word year
[1:50:59] to come on my mind
[1:51:01] i would like to read a very familiar
[1:51:05] scripture known to the
[1:51:08] i would say the least of the little
[1:51:12] kindergarten school
[1:51:18] john 3 16 for god so loved the world
[1:51:22] that he gave his only begotten son
[1:51:25] that whosoever believeth on him should
[1:51:27] not perish
[1:51:28] have everlasting life
[1:51:32] and then in the 22nd psalm
[1:51:36] and the 11th verse i would like to read
[1:51:38] this
[1:51:40] be not far from me for our
[1:51:43] trouble is near and there is
[1:51:47] none to help and i'd like to take for a
[1:51:51] text tonight five words and just dwell
[1:51:55] with them
[1:51:56] a few moments
[1:51:59] one of them is living
[1:52:04] and dying is the second one
[1:52:07] buried is the third one rising is the
[1:52:11] fourth one
[1:52:12] coming is the fifth one living
[1:52:16] dying buried rising
[1:52:20] coming that's enough to keep me here
[1:52:24] until in the morning
[1:52:26] but and then not nothing like justify
[1:52:29] the texts
[1:52:32] but we'll just speak on each one for a
[1:52:35] few moments
[1:52:38] i think that these words that david
[1:52:43] wrote here when he wrote this 22nd psalm
[1:52:49] begins with the crying of christ at
[1:52:52] calvary my god my god why has thou
[1:52:55] forsaken me
[1:52:58] the reason i chose this easter
[1:53:01] has just passed and the people are still
[1:53:04] feeling the impact of that great
[1:53:08] of day of when
[1:53:11] god proved that jesus was his son by
[1:53:15] raising him up on the third day
[1:53:18] according to the scriptures
[1:53:21] and in living he was
[1:53:24] loved the poet expressed
[1:53:31] that jesus was his son by raising him up
[1:53:35] on the third day according to the
[1:53:38] scriptures
[1:53:40] and in living he was loved the poet
[1:53:44] expressed it when he said
[1:53:46] living he loved me dying he saved me
[1:53:49] buried he carried my sins far away
[1:53:53] rising he justified freely forever
[1:53:56] someday he's coming oh glorious day
[1:54:03] and when he lived he loved
[1:54:06] because he was god and god is love
[1:54:12] and there could never be anyone who
[1:54:14] could love
[1:54:15] like jesus loved from the very
[1:54:20] first time his little baby hand
[1:54:23] stroked those pretty cheeks of his
[1:54:26] beautiful
[1:54:26] mother he was loved from that tully
[1:54:29] forgive his last enemy on the cross
[1:54:34] he was god's expression of love
[1:54:38] no one could love like jesus
[1:54:42] god being manifested in a little tiny
[1:54:46] baby come in order to take away the sins
[1:54:49] of the
[1:54:50] world and when you just speak
[1:54:53] the word jesus says something about it
[1:54:56] means love that's what the world needs
[1:55:00] more today
[1:55:01] is not a a jesus of some past tense
[1:55:06] some jesus of some high ethics but a
[1:55:09] jesus of love that can be expressed in
[1:55:13] the church of the lord
[1:55:15] jesus especially as his members
[1:55:18] one to another ought to always
[1:55:21] greet one another in love
[1:55:26] and traveling i think if there's any
[1:55:28] great thing that i've seen
[1:55:30] missing in the church today to one of
[1:55:33] the greatest
[1:55:34] hindrance in the church today to
[1:55:37] keep a revival back is the lack of that
[1:55:40] godly love that christ expressed when he
[1:55:43] was here on earth
[1:55:45] it's easy for you and i to love somebody
[1:55:48] that loves us
[1:55:51] but jesus didn't have that kind of love
[1:55:55] he had god's love and god
[1:55:58] loved his enemies
[1:56:01] for god so loved the world
[1:56:05] when the world was unlovable god still
[1:56:09] loved the world it's a different
[1:56:12] even in the expression in the the words
[1:56:15] the
[1:56:16] the ophelia love like we have one for
[1:56:20] another
[1:56:21] but the gopal love is a divine love
[1:56:26] and if there's anything that i believe
[1:56:29] that would start
[1:56:30] a revival in los angeles would be a time
[1:56:34] that we could all
[1:56:35] break down our different barriers and
[1:56:37] come together
[1:56:38] as christians and love
[1:56:42] that's the pentecostals the baptists and
[1:56:44] the presbyterians and
[1:56:46] all together we could be expressed to
[1:56:49] the world that we
[1:56:50] have loved one for another
[1:56:54] jesus prayed that prayer that we might
[1:56:57] love
[1:56:58] one another as he loved us as
[1:57:01] he loved us and he loved us
[1:57:05] so much that he died for us
[1:57:09] no one could love like that unless they
[1:57:12] with the natural um love
[1:57:16] because it would not hold out it won't
[1:57:19] express
[1:57:21] itself it'll do as long as there's
[1:57:23] friendship
[1:57:24] connected with it but when the
[1:57:26] friendships turn then the people begin
[1:57:28] to say well
[1:57:29] he did so and so she did so and so they
[1:57:32] backslid that
[1:57:34] real godly love goes after that
[1:57:36] backslider until it finds him
[1:57:39] godly love goes and stoops to the lowest
[1:57:42] of hell to pick up a man or a woman
[1:57:44] that's fallen that's what we're
[1:57:48] lacking today we have a fine
[1:57:51] cultured church educated
[1:57:54] fine dressed fine buildings
[1:57:58] nice choirs beautiful music some of the
[1:58:01] best the world's ever had but we are
[1:58:03] dying for some of that godly love
[1:58:09] jesus expressed it well when he found
[1:58:12] the prostitute
[1:58:14] drug before him guilty of an adultery
[1:58:20] and they drug her before him and said
[1:58:22] now
[1:58:23] the law requires for her to die
[1:58:26] what do you say do about it
[1:58:30] i tell you he showed himself what he was
[1:58:33] when he turned with these words
[1:58:36] neither do i condemn thee
[1:58:39] go and sin no more
[1:58:43] what more love could be than to take a
[1:58:45] wayward
[1:58:47] person like that and see who he was and
[1:58:51] freely forgive the woman of her wrong
[1:58:55] he expressed it again greatly when he
[1:58:58] was dying at calvary
[1:59:01] in his last words at the cross
[1:59:05] and this enemy spit hanging on his
[1:59:08] face he cried father forgive them
[1:59:12] for they know not what they do
[1:59:16] no one could love like him you can't
[1:59:19] manufacture that kind of a love it's a
[1:59:22] the gift of god that comes by the holy
[1:59:24] spirit
[1:59:26] the only way you'll ever be able to have
[1:59:28] that
[1:59:29] love though i speak with tongues of man
[1:59:32] and angels
[1:59:33] and have not that kind of a love i am
[1:59:36] nothing
[1:59:37] though i have faith to move mountains
[1:59:42] the bible said i was speaking here a few
[1:59:44] days ago upon the scripture
[1:59:46] straight is a gate and narrow is away
[1:59:48] and but few there'll be that find it
[1:59:52] and a young man who was riding with me
[1:59:54] in a car
[1:59:55] said how many would you say would be
[1:59:57] saved in this generation i said
[1:59:59] eight or ten oh he said
[2:00:02] don't say that brother i'll say i'll
[2:00:05] lengthen the 50 and that's as many as i
[2:00:07] can go
[2:00:08] he said 50 people i said jesus said when
[2:00:11] he was on earth
[2:00:12] as it was in the days of noah
[2:00:15] so shall it be in the coming of the son
[2:00:18] of man
[2:00:20] days of noah there was eight souls saved
[2:00:22] i remember a generation fades out each
[2:00:25] day
[2:00:26] ends that generation take 50 a day for
[2:00:29] six thousand years and see what you've
[2:00:30] gone
[2:00:33] and he said well then brother branham
[2:00:35] i'd like to ask you this question
[2:00:38] all the people that's claimed to have
[2:00:40] the holy spirit and so forth
[2:00:42] won't they come in the resurrection i
[2:00:43] said if they had the holy spirit
[2:00:46] but what we've been putting too much
[2:00:48] emphasis on is on
[2:00:50] other things instead of on the real
[2:00:52] thing
[2:00:53] the love of god
[2:00:56] paul said all these things could happen
[2:00:58] i could have all wisdom
[2:00:59] all knowledge and yet have not love it
[2:01:02] profit me
[2:01:02] nothing i could speak with tongues like
[2:01:05] man and angels
[2:01:07] and still not have it
[2:01:10] and we put so much emphasis upon these
[2:01:13] things
[2:01:14] upon great healing revivals and miracles
[2:01:16] being worked
[2:01:17] did not jesus say many will come to me
[2:01:19] in that day and say lord lord
[2:01:21] have not outcast our devils in your name
[2:01:24] in your name have i not done many mighty
[2:01:26] works
[2:01:27] i will say unto them depart from me you
[2:01:30] workers of iniquity
[2:01:31] i did not even know you what a
[2:01:35] disappointment that will be
[2:01:38] look what a surprise it'll be when he
[2:01:40] said those
[2:01:41] who didn't even think they deserved to
[2:01:43] be there when were you hungry and we fed
[2:01:46] you
[2:01:47] when were you naked and we gave you
[2:01:49] clothes
[2:01:51] we didn't know when you did this he said
[2:01:53] in so much as you've done it unto these
[2:01:56] you've done it unto me oh
[2:01:59] how the world needs something today
[2:02:03] i'll give you a little expression to
[2:02:05] clear that up
[2:02:06] in ezekiel the ninth chapter i believe
[2:02:09] it is when the holy spirit
[2:02:11] was sent forth to seal the people that
[2:02:14] would
[2:02:14] go in that day he said
[2:02:18] go through the city and put a mark upon
[2:02:21] the forehead of those that
[2:02:22] sign cry for the abominations that's
[2:02:25] dead in the midst of the city
[2:02:28] then to the slaughtering angels go after
[2:02:30] them
[2:02:32] and utterly destroy everything that
[2:02:35] doesn't have this seal
[2:02:37] now you take it in your own mind and go
[2:02:39] through los angeles tonight
[2:02:42] and you mark in the name of the lord
[2:02:46] jesus
[2:02:47] every person that's so concerned about
[2:02:51] the
[2:02:51] sins of the city until they cry and sigh
[2:02:56] day and night for the abominations done
[2:02:59] bring the eight here tomorrow night
[2:03:03] all right you see where we go we let
[2:03:06] other things come in to take up the
[2:03:08] place of the real thing it's
[2:03:11] love we're leaving out
[2:03:15] living he loved me he died for me when i
[2:03:18] was a
[2:03:19] sinner when i was unlovable he loved me
[2:03:22] anyhow
[2:03:24] my prayer is for the church that we can
[2:03:26] have such love till we
[2:03:28] love people whether they love us or not
[2:03:32] that's what the church needs today is to
[2:03:35] express a
[2:03:36] love even to a man that can
[2:03:39] spit in your face and you could still
[2:03:42] with not
[2:03:43] from a hypocritical standpoint but from
[2:03:46] your
[2:03:46] heart pray for that man's soul
[2:03:50] that's the kind of a revival we need
[2:03:52] here in los
[2:03:54] angeles but that kind of love manifested
[2:03:58] living he loved me dying
[2:04:01] he saved me
[2:04:05] most wonderful life that was ever lived
[2:04:07] on earth
[2:04:09] had to die when he was yet in his youth
[2:04:13] for god had spoken his his judgments had
[2:04:16] had to have just this for it is written
[2:04:20] the day you eat thereof that
[2:04:22] day you die god's
[2:04:25] justice required death and there was
[2:04:29] no one of us could die for one another
[2:04:33] no man could do that he was the only man
[2:04:36] could die that kind of a death
[2:04:39] for we were all born in sin
[2:04:42] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[2:04:44] speaking lies
[2:04:46] we were guilty from the beginning
[2:04:50] so how could a good man die for another
[2:04:52] man when he was guilty himself
[2:04:55] there could not be any of us take that
[2:04:57] kind of a position
[2:04:59] so it had to take his death and god
[2:05:03] came down and was manifested in the
[2:05:06] flesh
[2:05:07] in order to die of death god could not
[2:05:10] die in spirit
[2:05:12] because god is eternal and spirit
[2:05:15] doesn't die
[2:05:17] but he was god and he had to
[2:05:21] unfold himself and come from
[2:05:24] glory to a manger
[2:05:27] and take on the form of sinful flesh
[2:05:31] in order to die to secure his church or
[2:05:35] to redeem his church to reconcile him
[2:05:38] back to himself oh brother
[2:05:41] sister there's nobody could explain that
[2:05:45] what god did when he died for us his
[2:05:49] flesh was put to death
[2:05:51] in the scriptures the old testament
[2:05:55] at the sin offering when they got two
[2:05:58] goats
[2:06:00] and these goats and jesus represented
[2:06:03] both of them
[2:06:04] or they represented him rather
[2:06:08] and one goat was killed
[2:06:11] and the other was the sins of the nation
[2:06:15] was placed upon
[2:06:16] this goat called the scapegoat
[2:06:20] and that goat had to
[2:06:23] go out into the wilderness to die
[2:06:30] and to be out there alone amongst the
[2:06:33] beasts and so forth
[2:06:35] jesus had to be that
[2:06:38] that goat i want you to notice he
[2:06:42] was a lamb he was sheep
[2:06:46] but he was made goat for you now
[2:06:50] that we being goat might become sheep
[2:06:53] [Music]
[2:06:54] we being sinners
[2:06:57] guilty of death subject to death and
[2:07:01] all sold out under condemnation yet
[2:07:04] christ become me that i through his
[2:07:07] grace
[2:07:07] might become him a son of god
[2:07:11] seated at the right hand of god
[2:07:14] in glory the love that he had
[2:07:19] how he expressed it how he had to make
[2:07:21] himself what he was to die to save us
[2:07:25] in his death when he
[2:07:28] died at calvary there was never a death
[2:07:32] could be like that death
[2:07:35] we are told that when the roman soldier
[2:07:38] pierced his side
[2:07:39] there was water and blood came out of
[2:07:42] his side
[2:07:46] and i've asked the chemist one time
[2:07:50] what taken place for that and this
[2:07:52] fellow being a christian
[2:07:55] said to me that was not
[2:07:58] jesus did not die because that the
[2:08:01] spirit touched his side or pierced his
[2:08:04] side
[2:08:06] said jesus had been dead a long time
[2:08:09] before that
[2:08:11] but he died from grief
[2:08:15] the sword never killed him or neither
[2:08:18] did this
[2:08:19] the driving of the nails
[2:08:23] but it was great that killed him
[2:08:26] when he looked out upon the ones that he
[2:08:28] had loved and the ones that he had
[2:08:30] worked his miracles on and the ones that
[2:08:33] he had expressed his love towards
[2:08:35] and it fed and see that they turned him
[2:08:39] down you and i might be grieved
[2:08:44] we might grieve but we can never grieve
[2:08:46] like that
[2:08:47] because we're not made up of that kind
[2:08:49] of material that we could have that much
[2:08:51] grief
[2:08:53] for the fullness of god dwelt in him in
[2:08:56] him dwells the fullness of the godhead
[2:08:58] bodily
[2:08:59] god was expressing his love through
[2:09:01] human flesh
[2:09:02] the tabernacle in which he lived in his
[2:09:04] own son
[2:09:05] what he thought about the world
[2:09:09] there he hung there on calvary's cross
[2:09:13] not as you see him on the crucifix with
[2:09:16] the little
[2:09:16] rag wrapped around his lawns they
[2:09:19] stripped him naked they embarrassed him
[2:09:21] everything that they could embarrass him
[2:09:23] to and hung in their own calvary
[2:09:28] and he was disgraced and despised and
[2:09:30] rejected and
[2:09:32] spit on his very own dying
[2:09:35] the god of eternity the one that made
[2:09:38] the cross he was hanging on
[2:09:41] no wonder the rocks ran out of the
[2:09:43] mountains
[2:09:45] the rocks come out because the rock of
[2:09:47] ages was being erected
[2:09:50] no one of the poets said mid-rendering
[2:09:52] rocks and darkening skies
[2:09:54] my savior bowed his head and died
[2:09:58] the opening they'll reveal the way to
[2:10:01] heaven's joys and endless day
[2:10:04] what did it do when he died there like
[2:10:06] that it opened the veil
[2:10:08] it let us look past the curtain of time
[2:10:12] let us seen a a hope there i
[2:10:15] see him bruised and and mashed and
[2:10:18] spit and arms and nails drove through
[2:10:22] him
[2:10:23] what did he do it opened the way that me
[2:10:26] a guilty sinner
[2:10:28] i know that he paid the price there i'm
[2:10:30] not justified by anything i could do
[2:10:33] none of my goodness i have none neither
[2:10:35] do you
[2:10:36] but it's through his sacrifices to his
[2:10:39] death
[2:10:40] we are justified by believing on him
[2:10:42] there's where our justice stands
[2:10:45] not what i do or what you do but what he
[2:10:47] did for us
[2:10:48] that ain't the gospel story i don't know
[2:10:51] it
[2:10:52] oh give me that and take all the rest of
[2:10:55] it away
[2:10:57] see that one who died for me how could i
[2:11:00] be just i
[2:11:01] i cannot justify myself i'm a sinner
[2:11:04] but when i look up on him and come
[2:11:06] singing nothing in my arms i
[2:11:09] bring simply to thy cross i clean
[2:11:12] there's where i'm justified by my faith
[2:11:15] believing that he died in my stead and
[2:11:17] took my place at calvary
[2:11:19] that's alone where i stand on the
[2:11:21] platform one
[2:11:22] demon powers are around and i see
[2:11:26] death hanging on the people and
[2:11:29] the devils got them bound and possessed
[2:11:32] and some of them straight jackets and
[2:11:35] and guards around them what do i stand
[2:11:38] on there and
[2:11:39] look to calvary lord there jesus christ
[2:11:42] paid the price i feel religious
[2:11:48] there he did it that person's got a
[2:11:51] right to be
[2:11:52] free satan don't hold them no longer
[2:11:55] if you can get them to see not their
[2:11:57] aches and their pains or some preacher
[2:11:58] praying farmer
[2:11:59] some holy church that's all right that
[2:12:02] goes with it
[2:12:03] but the main thing you see what christ
[2:12:05] did for you
[2:12:06] you're free christ died for you
[2:12:10] amen that's the gospel
[2:12:13] been rendering rocks and darkening skies
[2:12:17] my savior about his head and eye
[2:12:20] the opening veil revealed the way the
[2:12:24] heaven's joy and illness day
[2:12:26] there's where he died living he loved me
[2:12:30] dying he saved me
[2:12:33] how could i be saved get rid of sin he
[2:12:36] was a sin offering for me so he died
[2:12:39] now if sin is dead then buried
[2:12:42] he carried my sins far away
[2:12:45] he was a scapegoat that went out
[2:12:49] and the scapegoat took the sins of the
[2:12:51] people
[2:12:52] on him and went out into the wilderness
[2:12:54] to be
[2:12:55] to die grew out there and took the sins
[2:12:59] of the people and took them far away
[2:13:01] so did jesus he was
[2:13:04] he took the sins of the people and
[2:13:07] carried them far away
[2:13:09] so far that he put him in the sea of
[2:13:12] god's forgetfulness
[2:13:15] if sin is dead buried
[2:13:19] that's why we have baptisteries when
[2:13:22] people believe that story they come
[2:13:24] confessing their sins
[2:13:25] that they're tired of it they've
[2:13:27] divorced it they've separated from it
[2:13:30] and they're tired of it so it's dead and
[2:13:32] sin has
[2:13:33] more power upon that believer because he
[2:13:35] stands
[2:13:36] justified in the death and burial of
[2:13:38] jesus christ
[2:13:40] therefore he walks to the altar makes
[2:13:43] his confession
[2:13:44] says i'm sick and tired of sin i don't
[2:13:46] want it no more
[2:13:47] then we bury it when sin is buried
[2:13:50] anything is buried
[2:13:51] it's dead first then it's buried
[2:13:55] it's put away from sight that's why we
[2:13:57] bury people
[2:13:58] put them away from the side the
[2:14:00] contamination of their bodies
[2:14:02] hide them from us it's a gloomy thing to
[2:14:04] see what death does
[2:14:06] and when sin is finished when
[2:14:09] sin lost its grips and it died in the
[2:14:12] death of christ at calvary
[2:14:13] where he condemned sin then the sinner
[2:14:16] who accepts that
[2:14:17] justified by faith can scream hallelujah
[2:14:20] for
[2:14:21] god's carried my sins far away he put
[2:14:24] him up on my sin barrier jesus
[2:14:26] christ he represented both the animals
[2:14:29] both dying and taking the sins away
[2:14:34] then as i said a few moments ago he
[2:14:36] become
[2:14:37] we become we were goats he become
[2:14:40] goat for us being he becomes
[2:14:44] sin for us that's the reason he had to
[2:14:47] be punished the way he was
[2:14:48] because all of our sins were placed upon
[2:14:51] him
[2:14:53] and there he had to bear them away in
[2:14:56] his own body
[2:14:57] to calvary or reproach a disgrace
[2:15:01] sinfully hanging there naked strip
[2:15:04] bleeding
[2:15:04] bleeding when he rolled his precious
[2:15:08] head around the bloody locks dripping
[2:15:11] from his shoulders
[2:15:12] i believe it was billy's sunday said
[2:15:14] there was an angel sitting in every tree
[2:15:16] saying just pull your hands loose on the
[2:15:18] cross
[2:15:19] and just motion your finger will change
[2:15:22] the scene
[2:15:23] the jews paid him the greatest
[2:15:24] compliment could be paid not knowing
[2:15:26] what they were doing
[2:15:27] they said he saved others himself he
[2:15:29] can't save
[2:15:30] sure not if he saved himself he could
[2:15:33] not save others
[2:15:35] but he gave himself that we might be
[2:15:37] saved that's the story
[2:15:39] living he loved me dying he saved me
[2:15:42] buried he carried my sins far away
[2:15:45] they're
[2:15:46] done they're finished god sealed
[2:15:48] forgiveness to be remembered
[2:15:50] against him so more oh can't we shout
[2:15:52] hallelujah to that
[2:15:54] sure it's all over christ did it
[2:15:57] oh my sure we can now here comes the
[2:16:01] greatest of all
[2:16:02] rising he justified
[2:16:07] all these great things he done was
[2:16:09] wonderful they're superb
[2:16:11] there's nothing to be added to it but
[2:16:13] yet a man could die
[2:16:15] yet a man could suffer yet a man could
[2:16:18] love
[2:16:20] but when he rose god wrote the receipt
[2:16:22] in his resurrection that he had received
[2:16:25] it
[2:16:25] god's justice had been met
[2:16:28] oh thanks be to god rising he
[2:16:32] justified god proved by the resurrection
[2:16:36] that he wasn't frowning he wasn't fake
[2:16:38] that was his son
[2:16:40] and he raised him up the spirit the
[2:16:42] eternal spirit
[2:16:44] jehovah god the father of our lord jesus
[2:16:46] christ
[2:16:47] who raised up that dead farm in the
[2:16:50] grave there had been dead for three days
[2:16:52] and buried and
[2:16:53] god raised him up on easter morning to
[2:16:56] justify
[2:16:57] there when we come brother coming to god
[2:17:00] there's not one thing
[2:17:01] he that cometh but come boldly to the
[2:17:04] throne of grace
[2:17:05] you mustn't come wandering when you come
[2:17:08] into the prayer line
[2:17:09] you mustn't come wondering well if this
[2:17:11] minister will pray for me
[2:17:13] perhaps maybe he's got healing power
[2:17:16] brother sister healing power is in god
[2:17:19] saying cross in the finished work of
[2:17:22] calvary
[2:17:24] when you come come to be justified
[2:17:27] you are justified when you confess your
[2:17:30] faith
[2:17:30] that by skype i was healed
[2:17:34] i'm going to make a stand the doctor
[2:17:37] says i'm dying i got
[2:17:38] tumor i got tb whatever it is but
[2:17:41] tonight
[2:17:42] i stand because i believe that he
[2:17:45] loved me and died for me and saved me
[2:17:48] and buried my sins far away
[2:17:50] and god justified us by believing on him
[2:17:54] when he
[2:17:54] raised him up from the dead he accepted
[2:17:57] everything that he died for he was
[2:17:59] wounded for our transgressions
[2:18:00] bruised for our iniquity the chasm of
[2:18:03] our peace upon a man
[2:18:05] with his stripes we were healed and he
[2:18:08] raised him up and wrote the receipt
[2:18:10] that was god's receipt when the earth
[2:18:13] began to quiver and
[2:18:14] shake and the sun began to dark
[2:18:17] light the earth on that easter morning
[2:18:21] heaven shall hell shall power i shook
[2:18:24] the earth shut something has taken place
[2:18:29] i can hear the angels and glory
[2:18:31] screaming
[2:18:33] hallelujah i can hear him in paradise
[2:18:35] the old saints of the old testament
[2:18:37] crying out glory to his name
[2:18:41] certainly something that happened up
[2:18:43] from the grave he arose
[2:18:47] he brought out the triumph over the
[2:18:49] grave
[2:18:50] death hell sickness every barrier
[2:18:53] everything
[2:18:55] that stands in the way of perfect
[2:18:57] freedom for the christian
[2:18:58] everything that you have need of was
[2:19:00] taken care of it was
[2:19:02] been suffered far done been accepted
[2:19:04] done bled far done died done rose
[2:19:07] and god justified him he justifies you
[2:19:11] to believe it
[2:19:13] up from the grave he arose prove that he
[2:19:16] was god
[2:19:17] buddha made some great statements buddha
[2:19:20] died in the grave 2 300 years ago
[2:19:22] still there muhammad made a lot of great
[2:19:26] statements
[2:19:27] but he died and he's in the grave and
[2:19:29] been there for about
[2:19:30] nearly 1900 years he's in the grave
[2:19:34] no speaking afterwards they might have
[2:19:37] been great man
[2:19:38] confucius a great chinese philosopher
[2:19:40] many of those great man
[2:19:42] poets and authors and gods of want more
[2:19:46] they might have been great in their
[2:19:48] stand
[2:19:49] but when god raised up his son on easter
[2:19:52] morning
[2:19:53] it proved it and he sent the holy ghost
[2:19:56] and we've got the receipt of it now but
[2:19:58] i can hear him scream from eternity
[2:20:00] because i live
[2:20:01] ye live also amen
[2:20:07] that's right because i live you live
[2:20:10] also
[2:20:12] amen for he was wounded for our
[2:20:16] transgressions
[2:20:17] with his stripes we were healed you
[2:20:19] don't have to die before your time comes
[2:20:22] because he lives you live also
[2:20:26] that shall smother out my breath i'll
[2:20:28] still be living
[2:20:30] he that heareth my words and believeth
[2:20:32] on him and send me has everlasting life
[2:20:34] and shall never come to the judgment
[2:20:36] but pass from death into life i
[2:20:39] am the resurrection life saith god he
[2:20:42] that believeth in me though he were dead
[2:20:44] yet shall he live whosoever liveth and
[2:20:46] believeth me shall
[2:20:47] never die
[2:20:50] i anchor my soul right there
[2:20:54] no wonder the poet wrote on that
[2:20:57] bright and cloudless morning when the
[2:20:59] dead in christ shall rise
[2:21:01] and the glory of his resurrection share
[2:21:05] when his chosen one shall gather to
[2:21:07] their home beyond the sky
[2:21:09] when the rose called up yonder i'll be
[2:21:12] there
[2:21:13] why living he loved me dying he saved me
[2:21:17] buried he carried my sins far away
[2:21:20] rising he justified freely forever
[2:21:24] someday he's coming oh glorious day
[2:21:29] i can see my shoulders stooping my arms
[2:21:33] where they used to be muscles were
[2:21:34] getting fattened
[2:21:36] uh oh i can see i'm i'm dying
[2:21:40] i don't know how long it'll be before
[2:21:42] he'll call me
[2:21:43] but i've got eternal life in here
[2:21:46] because he died for me
[2:21:47] that he might redeem this that i have
[2:21:49] offered to him
[2:21:51] some glorious day he's coming
[2:21:54] i believe it with all my heart i'll stay
[2:21:57] at the battlefield by his grace
[2:21:59] i'll preach pray for the sick until
[2:22:01] death shall set me free
[2:22:03] and then go home a crown to where for he
[2:22:06] paid for it gave it freely god justified
[2:22:10] my belief when he raised up jesus
[2:22:13] then i have a crown waiting 40 days
[2:22:16] after he had visited his disciples
[2:22:18] he's standing out on the mountain
[2:22:21] is what holds us on the earth when we're
[2:22:24] on the earth here it's gravitation hoses
[2:22:27] but you know what god took an ocean for
[2:22:28] him to come up a little higher
[2:22:31] gravitation began to lose his hope
[2:22:34] god i hope that i could be that way some
[2:22:37] of these days don't you
[2:22:40] on this old earth bound condition
[2:22:42] sometimes i've been in meetings i
[2:22:44] thought it was going to take place at
[2:22:45] any time
[2:22:47] just feel it breaking loose around you
[2:22:49] one of these days it'll do it
[2:22:53] no matter they can put you in a grave
[2:22:55] and put a tombstone on top of you and
[2:22:57] seal you up
[2:22:57] that won't have one thing to do with it
[2:22:59] the trumpet of god shall sound
[2:23:01] and the dead in christ your eyes
[2:23:04] some days coming oh glorious days
[2:23:11] yes he's coming gravitation began to
[2:23:14] lose his hold
[2:23:15] his feet begin to rise earth began to
[2:23:17] peep through beyond that
[2:23:19] i will come again he said and receive
[2:23:23] unto myself that where i am there you
[2:23:26] may be also
[2:23:28] i'm so glad that i can sing that song
[2:23:30] with a true heart tonight
[2:23:32] living he loved me dying
[2:23:35] he saved me buried he carried
[2:23:38] my sins far away rising he
[2:23:42] justified freely forever
[2:23:45] sunday's coming o glorious day
[2:23:50] brings me to this little thought i don't
[2:23:52] know whatever said it to hold its little
[2:23:53] story
[2:23:54] i read out of a book one time about a
[2:23:56] man here in america
[2:23:57] his name is greenfield it's been dead
[2:23:59] now about 75 years i guess
[2:24:02] he died oh i guess
[2:24:05] maybe longer than that but
[2:24:08] before he died he dreamed a dream that
[2:24:10] he went to glory
[2:24:12] when he got up there he went to the gate
[2:24:14] he said to the
[2:24:15] saint i am danny greenfield he said i'm
[2:24:19] an evangelist i've come to take my
[2:24:21] position
[2:24:22] he said just a moment sir your name has
[2:24:24] to be on the book here
[2:24:26] he looked over the book and he said
[2:24:27] there's no greenfield daniel greenfield
[2:24:30] here he said oh you must be wrong sir
[2:24:31] said i was an evangelist in america
[2:24:34] nope it's not here so what can i do said
[2:24:38] if you wish to you might appeal your
[2:24:40] case to the great white throne judgment
[2:24:42] so he said that's all i have left so he
[2:24:45] said it seemed like he was passing
[2:24:47] through the air for a while
[2:24:48] began to get lighter and lighter after a
[2:24:51] while as it got lighter he got slower
[2:24:53] until he stopped he couldn't see just
[2:24:54] where the light was coming from
[2:24:56] but it's all around him and said he
[2:24:58] heard a voice that said
[2:25:00] who is this that approaches my throne of
[2:25:02] justice
[2:25:04] he said i'm daniel greenfield said i was
[2:25:06] up at the heaven gates
[2:25:08] and the gatekeeper turned me away and
[2:25:10] said i had to stand before your judgment
[2:25:12] now i appeal my case to stand here sir
[2:25:16] he said all right i'll judge you about
[2:25:17] my justice then
[2:25:19] he said my justice requires
[2:25:22] perfection he said did you ever lie when
[2:25:25] he was on earth
[2:25:27] he said i thought i'd been an honest man
[2:25:30] and had been truthful
[2:25:31] but said in the presence of that light
[2:25:34] i've seen a lot of times i told things
[2:25:36] that wasn't right
[2:25:37] look friend we may go to church every
[2:25:39] sunday we may be very religious
[2:25:42] oh sure you might pay your tithes and
[2:25:44] you might just be as good a person as
[2:25:46] los angeles as god
[2:25:48] that may be true but i'll tell you
[2:25:51] there's a lot of things going to stand
[2:25:52] before you if that's all you got
[2:25:53] when you stand at that white throne
[2:25:54] judgment
[2:25:57] no wonder if you there will be a be
[2:25:58] saved
[2:26:00] and he said i thought i told the truth
[2:26:02] but said i
[2:26:03] seen a lot of things that told wasn't
[2:26:05] just right
[2:26:06] he said yes i told eyes
[2:26:09] he said then did you ever steal he
[2:26:12] thought there's one i can answer
[2:26:14] but said in the presence of that light
[2:26:16] he saw many a little shady deal he never
[2:26:18] thought of it in natural life
[2:26:20] see we're just on the negative side
[2:26:22] we're looking with
[2:26:23] shaded eyes but when we stand there in
[2:26:25] his presence
[2:26:27] the glasses are going to be pulled off
[2:26:29] we'll see
[2:26:30] face to face with him man that's when
[2:26:32] it's going to be terrible
[2:26:34] and he said yes i i i guess i did steal
[2:26:39] he said daniel greenfield my
[2:26:43] justice requires perfection was you
[2:26:46] perfect when we used your life
[2:26:48] he said no lord i wasn't perfect
[2:26:51] said he's waiting to hear that great
[2:26:52] blessing depart from me
[2:26:54] you work of iniquity said he heard a
[2:26:58] voice
[2:26:59] is the sweetest voice he ever heard in
[2:27:01] his life
[2:27:02] and he turned to look he said he saw the
[2:27:04] sweetest face that he ever saw
[2:27:07] said no mother couldn't look or talk
[2:27:09] like that
[2:27:11] said as he walked up close to him he put
[2:27:13] his hand up on his shoulder
[2:27:16] and he said to him father
[2:27:19] that is true danny greenfield in his
[2:27:21] earthly journey
[2:27:22] he wasn't perfect but there's one thing
[2:27:25] he did when he was in earth
[2:27:27] he stood for me now while you're
[2:27:30] in heaven i'll stand for him
[2:27:34] all of his sins put it up on my account
[2:27:38] and he had paid for it at calvary
[2:27:41] brother sister that's the one i'm going
[2:27:43] to depend on
[2:27:44] i'm not going to depend on whether i'm a
[2:27:46] methodist or a baptist or a pentecostal
[2:27:48] i'm not going to depend on whether i
[2:27:50] shot it whether i spoke with tongues
[2:27:51] whether i prayed the prayer of faith for
[2:27:53] the sick i'm not going to depend on that
[2:27:55] i'm going to depend on my faith yonder
[2:27:58] or he loved me and died and saved me and
[2:28:01] rising he
[2:28:02] justified i'll stand for him upon the
[2:28:06] basis of that
[2:28:06] while i'm here on earth that great
[2:28:09] judgment morning
[2:28:10] i believe you'll stand for me at that
[2:28:12] day who would stand for you that day
[2:28:14] could your pastor could your church
[2:28:16] think of it while we bow our heads just
[2:28:18] a moment
[2:28:20] dear god that is a solemn
[2:28:24] question that we must answer just now
[2:28:27] who would stand for us
[2:28:30] would it be the our friends
[2:28:33] though they might be ever so loyal and
[2:28:36] would try as hard as they could to stand
[2:28:38] for us
[2:28:39] it might be our beloved pastor who we
[2:28:42] love with all of our hearts
[2:28:44] and he would stand and scream for us
[2:28:48] yet he has to scream for mercy too
[2:28:52] oh there is could be no one stand that
[2:28:55] day but
[2:28:55] jesus dear god
[2:28:59] i've just tried to speak of a love
[2:29:02] that you gave to your church
[2:29:05] it seems like that they've caught up
[2:29:06] with the miracles of the bible they've
[2:29:09] caught up with the
[2:29:10] the membership and the evangelism and
[2:29:12] the missionaries and
[2:29:14] but lord let them catch up with love now
[2:29:17] that'll set the church of fire with the
[2:29:20] real
[2:29:22] agopal love with a real sacred
[2:29:25] love that could turn the cheek
[2:29:29] or the one that would be willing to lay
[2:29:32] down his life
[2:29:34] if it would mean to save others god give
[2:29:37] us that love in our hearts
[2:29:39] as we wait on thee while we have our
[2:29:41] heads bowed
[2:29:43] i wonder tonight how many in this big
[2:29:46] audience of people tonight
[2:29:48] would just like to stand up to your feet
[2:29:50] and say i'm going to stand right now for
[2:29:52] jesus
[2:29:53] and by doing this lord i want you to
[2:29:56] stand for me on that day because this
[2:29:58] may be the last chance that i get to
[2:30:00] ever stand for you
[2:30:02] i've been in many meetings i'm a member
[2:30:04] of a church maybe you are maybe you're
[2:30:06] not
[2:30:07] whatever the case is would you just say
[2:30:10] lord i'll stand right now and please
[2:30:13] stand for me on that day
[2:30:15] stand up to your feet right now while we

[2:35:24] going to be a great time around this
[2:35:26] temple
[2:35:27] if jesus tarries and i'd like to
[2:35:30] see every sin cleaned up like to see all
[2:35:34] the old
[2:35:35] gloomy devils tuck away and the church
[2:35:38] of the living god could stand on their
[2:35:39] feet
[2:35:40] with real divine love there be a shaking
[2:35:43] to this city likes never been known
[2:35:45] before
[2:35:46] lame blind halt everything would take
[2:35:49] place
[2:35:51] are you finished you're sure now this
[2:35:54] this is you're sure
[2:35:56] that your sins are so under the blood
[2:36:05] thank god for the word but it wasn't the
[2:36:08] message that i was reading
[2:36:13] amen brother brown did preach on it
[2:36:17] living dying buried rising coming
[2:36:20] he preached on it uh in jeffersonville
[2:36:24] and uh well actually there was a series
[2:36:26] that he that he ministered on
[2:36:28] and then i think it was just a few days
[2:36:30] later it was after easter
[2:36:32] had faded gone past that he ministered
[2:36:35] in another place
[2:36:36] and that's the one that our brother was
[2:36:38] playing
[2:36:39] and i didn't have that one printed but
[2:36:42] this one here
[2:36:43] and again this is a series that was
[2:36:46] printed quite some time ago
[2:36:48] long time ago and it's uh five
[2:36:52] five messages living dying buried rising
[2:36:55] coming
[2:36:56] amen march 59
[2:36:59] and the other another one was on water
[2:37:01] baptism and again he was highlighting
[2:37:03] the spiritual
[2:37:05] meaning of water of baptism why what
[2:37:08] does baptism represent
[2:37:10] and he wanted to highlight those things
[2:37:12] his death
[2:37:13] burial resurrection amen
[2:37:16] and the sign of the messiah and again
[2:37:19] the other one was i know
[2:37:21] and then the finally preached on go tell
[2:37:23] amen
[2:37:24] so uh maybe on another night that we'll
[2:37:27] we'll pray the
[2:37:28] one that he actually preached in
[2:37:29] jeffersonville because
[2:37:32] in this one he does highlight
[2:37:35] easter it was it was during the time of
[2:37:38] easter that he preached it
[2:37:40] and he highlights easter and
[2:37:43] living dying buried rising coming this
[2:37:46] is what jesus did this is what easter
[2:37:48] represents
[2:37:49] means to you and me by the grace of
[2:37:51] almighty god
[2:37:52] and he said and he said it was god's
[2:37:55] receipt that was rising
[2:37:57] and he said that the bill had been paid
[2:38:00] and he said he justified freely forever
[2:38:02] and he said oh what a savior rising what
[2:38:05] had god
[2:38:06] done a man can suffer a man can die
[2:38:09] a man can be buried but easter was the
[2:38:12] greatest of them all for he said it was
[2:38:14] god's endorsement
[2:38:16] my law has been sent met and my
[2:38:18] requirement has been met
[2:38:19] by him he rose him from the dead
[2:38:23] rising he justified freely forever
[2:38:27] blessed be his holy name amen
[2:38:30] and he said remember he said
[2:38:34] today we celebrate just not a time to
[2:38:36] wear new hats and wear new clothes
[2:38:39] which is all right it's a symbol or
[2:38:41] something new
[2:38:42] but god did something new and he said
[2:38:45] which is all right
[2:38:46] is not only that but easter doesn't mean
[2:38:49] that
[2:38:49] he said a bunny easter rabbits or bunny
[2:38:52] eggs
[2:38:53] and little white chickens and so forth
[2:38:55] that isn't the idea brother
[2:38:57] he said easter is a triumph
[2:39:00] easter is the victory he says that god
[2:39:04] give over the earth and that he raised
[2:39:06] his own son from the dead
[2:39:08] and whosoever believeth in him shall
[2:39:11] not perish but have everlasting life
[2:39:15] amen and
[2:39:19] nearing the end of this message he he
[2:39:21] said again
[2:39:22] he talked about the bombs that they're
[2:39:24] saying that russia is going to sin
[2:39:26] over america and destroy america well
[2:39:30] there's spiritual bombs of the devil
[2:39:32] that it that that he's going to be used
[2:39:34] and he said listen he said you promised
[2:39:37] to come lord
[2:39:38] he said get your people and it'll be
[2:39:40] that way lord
[2:39:41] so most any minute there could be a
[2:39:45] resurrection
[2:39:47] there could be an easter for the church
[2:39:50] a resurrection from this sinful life
[2:39:53] onto the life eternal
[2:39:55] through christ here oh lord our prayer
[2:40:00] amen and there's other things i could
[2:40:02] highlight but we will leave that and
[2:40:04] maybe get you to hear it's another time
[2:40:07] and uh this message is very very short
[2:40:10] it might be 50 minutes that's the entire
[2:40:13] message
[2:40:14] but i was highlighting just for his
[2:40:17] beginning to preach it
[2:40:18] and just when he prayed to end it so
[2:40:21] maybe
[2:40:22] we'll touch on some other time so and if
[2:40:24] you want to of course you can go
[2:40:26] and try to get it printed and i don't
[2:40:29] know many got this
[2:40:30] these booklets or not because they're
[2:40:32] that's a long time ago
[2:40:33] that i got this and that it was printed
[2:40:36] so you might be able to find it online
[2:40:38] and hear the prophet preach it by the
[2:40:40] grace of god
[2:40:41] amen but it's representing easter
[2:40:45] is representing amen and we're believing
[2:40:48] a lot more than what the world's
[2:40:50] believing
[2:40:50] amen we're believing in the life that
[2:40:53] was lived
[2:40:54] we're believing in the life that laid
[2:40:56] itself down for you and me
[2:40:58] amen or believe in the life that was
[2:40:59] buried by the grace of god
[2:41:02] but it rose again amen and
[2:41:06] with a promise on coming back again
[2:41:08] praise the name of the lord
[2:41:10] so and also we could highlight a sermon
[2:41:14] that the prophet of god preached
[2:41:16] concerning the crucifixion of the word
[2:41:18] amen
[2:41:19] that as they crucified him in his first
[2:41:21] coming they have crucified him
[2:41:23] and are crucified him in his second
[2:41:24] coming well they are
[2:41:26] the most definitely crucifying the word
[2:41:29] because whether it wasn't just the bible
[2:41:31] and the letter being preached it was the
[2:41:33] revelation
[2:41:34] of god it was the revelation of jesus
[2:41:37] it was the revelation of the bridegroom
[2:41:40] amen
[2:41:41] coming to receive his bride amen amen
[2:41:44] and brother i trust by the grace of god
[2:41:46] that we're witnessing not just a prophet
[2:41:48] but brother i trust for believing what
[2:41:50] the god through the prophet revealed
[2:41:52] amen how many of us are really really
[2:41:55] really
[2:41:56] into what was revealed and he said all
[2:41:59] that god has done
[2:42:00] was to give us he said rapturing faith
[2:42:03] amen she was not just to isolate william
[2:42:06] branham or i late
[2:42:07] oh god got this power god that got that
[2:42:09] power and
[2:42:10] unfortunately this is what most of the
[2:42:14] evangelistic world in the days of
[2:42:16] william branham this is what they were
[2:42:17] looking for
[2:42:18] they were looking for signs and wonders
[2:42:20] and they wanted brother brown to come
[2:42:22] and minister to them and and then would
[2:42:25] only minister
[2:42:25] they wanted mainly to sign they wanted
[2:42:28] him to do this and do that
[2:42:30] for the healing of the people but again
[2:42:32] we know
[2:42:33] that there was one one evangelist out
[2:42:35] there
[2:42:36] the prophet did i like that that that
[2:42:38] brothers ministry
[2:42:40] as being of god for a reason but it was
[2:42:42] that brother it was that evangelist that
[2:42:44] called the prophet aside
[2:42:46] and told him he said don't preach those
[2:42:48] things brother branham
[2:42:49] he said come and do this and you can
[2:42:51] expound this and expound that
[2:42:53] but don't preach he said again for the
[2:42:55] people against doing this
[2:42:56] doing this doing that no no he didn't
[2:42:58] want william brown to
[2:42:59] preach that but he wasn't going to and
[2:43:02] brother brahma said to him
[2:43:03] he's a well-known evangelist he's going
[2:43:05] on now himself
[2:43:06] and uh known around the world and
[2:43:09] brother brown said brother
[2:43:11] he said if i don't do it who's gonna do
[2:43:12] it he said i gotta preach it because he
[2:43:15] said they're not they're not preachers
[2:43:16] out there
[2:43:17] amen so that that was the end of their
[2:43:20] association with william branham
[2:43:22] amen because there was a number of
[2:43:24] angels wanted him because of the signs
[2:43:26] and the wonders
[2:43:27] and it was attracting the people but see
[2:43:29] the bride's not coming for signs and
[2:43:31] wonders
[2:43:31] the bride is coming for the word amen to
[2:43:34] give her the faith that she needs in
[2:43:36] this hour
[2:43:37] whereas all they were looking for was
[2:43:38] signs and wonders healing healing
[2:43:40] healing god doing this god doing that
[2:43:42] but brother brother what about the
[2:43:44] resurrection and the rapture
[2:43:45] that's going to get us out of here where
[2:43:47] we won't need healing
[2:43:49] no no we're getting good into eternity
[2:43:51] we won't need someone to go and pray
[2:43:52] oh i i need someone to pray for me
[2:43:54] because i'm sick no no there'll be no
[2:43:56] sickness
[2:43:57] we're going to get out of this dimension
[2:43:58] into the eternal dimension amen
[2:44:00] where all these things are gone amen but
[2:44:03] again
[2:44:04] they they are focusing and not so many
[2:44:07] now
[2:44:07] because it's all gone now the revival's
[2:44:09] gone the spirit of revival's gone
[2:44:11] and brother the spirit of god is
[2:44:13] narrowed down narrowed down narrow down
[2:44:14] to the
[2:44:15] to the bright to get her out of here to
[2:44:17] get her rapturing faith resurrection
[2:44:19] faith
[2:44:19] and again the prophet prophet said he
[2:44:22] said my
[2:44:23] he said there won't be many and he did
[2:44:25] highlight us a couple of numbers
[2:44:27] and brother we consider that there might
[2:44:28] be 2 million people
[2:44:30] believing this message around the world
[2:44:33] two million
[2:44:34] and the private guy just said i said
[2:44:36] those living ones that'll go in the
[2:44:37] rapture he said there's only be a few
[2:44:39] only i can't remember the number used
[2:44:42] now there's a couple of numbers he was
[2:44:43] he was indicating
[2:44:45] so brother about what it should what
[2:44:47] should it do to us it probably ought to
[2:44:48] put us on our guard
[2:44:50] oh yes most definitely that we that we
[2:44:52] will walk to please god
[2:44:53] that we'll believe the word to please
[2:44:55] god that we're there to love the lord
[2:44:57] he loved us in doing what he did now
[2:44:59] brother let's love him
[2:45:01] amen for his word for his redemption
[2:45:04] let's love him for what he's doing to
[2:45:06] get us out of time and into eternity
[2:45:09] by the grace of god god help us
[2:45:12] that we're going to focus on jesus our
[2:45:15] lord
[2:45:15] jesus christ focus on god to focus on
[2:45:18] redemption
[2:45:20] but it's not just religion all this good
[2:45:22] look what he did
[2:45:23] jesus did this jesus did that yeah but
[2:45:25] let's let's become personal with jesus
[2:45:27] that jesus sort of that amen we identify
[2:45:30] with what he did
[2:45:31] are we identifying with what he's doing
[2:45:33] oh yeah you can
[2:45:34] oh the bible says that they want to want
[2:45:36] to identify with his death death and
[2:45:38] burial
[2:45:38] and so on but how many identify with his
[2:45:40] resurrection
[2:45:42] by the grace of god and believing that
[2:45:45] we
[2:45:45] as the bridegroom was resurrected the
[2:45:47] bride is resurrected
[2:45:49] he has come back amen to put
[2:45:51] resurrection and rapture in the bride
[2:45:54] by the word god help us do god
[2:45:57] be the glory amen so brother god help us
[2:46:00] to be spiritual
[2:46:02] and again not religious but spiritual
[2:46:04] the world's religious
[2:46:06] out there but i pray grace that we're
[2:46:08] going to be spiritual amen

[2:46:25] what's he doing for the bride what's he
[2:46:28] making flesh in you and me
[2:46:29] the resurrection the rapture amen
