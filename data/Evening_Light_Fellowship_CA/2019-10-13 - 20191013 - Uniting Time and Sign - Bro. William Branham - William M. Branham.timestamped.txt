[31:21] [Music]
[31:24] he died presents Kazmir come kosm
[31:40] [Music]
[31:42] e-tutoring praise the Lord calls me a
[31:49] leader you caused me to live in thy
[31:57] [Music]
[32:02] grace the Lord
[32:06] [Music]
[32:10] in thy presence o Lord calls me amen my
[32:26] praises Oh Lord calls me yes a man yes
[32:43] caused me to live amen praise the name
[32:51] of the Lord Amen god bless Justin thank
[32:54] you for your presence here and there's I
[32:58] guess a lot of people wouldn't bother
[33:00] amen but again they're ignoring the
[33:03] scripture where two or three are
[33:04] gathered there am I in the midst and
[33:07] really the original translation is where
[33:10] I have gathered two or three a man
[33:13] because the devil is gather a lot here
[33:15] not there a few here a few there to
[33:19] imitate God but Jesus said where I have
[33:22] gathered two or three in my name he said
[33:25] there am I in the midst so believing
[33:28] that he has gathered us and just
[33:30] believed I have the faith that he is in
[33:33] the midst praise the Lord that not just
[33:35] in the building but he's in you a man
[33:38] so the grace of God to help us to
[33:41] believe with a complete belief to have
[33:43] faith with faith there's no questions
[33:46] nature's beliefs a man with faith
[33:49] there's no doubt faith believes what God
[33:51] said in his word a man he said I'll
[33:54] never leave you never forsake you be
[33:56] with you even in yet to the end of the
[33:57] age so we're we don't have to go looking
[34:00] for Jesus amen to some time he's looking
[34:03] for us a man so he's lost our attention
[34:06] so any and he's there but he's looking
[34:09] for your attention he's looking for you
[34:11] to focus on him he's looking for you to
[34:13] fellowship with him a man he wants
[34:16] fellowship sure he does so brother I
[34:19] pray the grace of God that he's got
[34:21] fellowship with us today
[34:23] and and those Saints that are not here
[34:25] and that have traveled to pray the grace
[34:26] of God he got fellowship with them a man
[34:29] because though they leave the city they
[34:31] don't leave him
[34:32] a man because he'll go with them by the
[34:35] grace of God so we pray grace to those
[34:37] not with us we pray grace to those that
[34:39] are here just a few of us but thank God
[34:43] again the problem God said he would
[34:45] rather have that as I mentioned he
[34:47] rather have a cottage meeting with 24
[34:48] people that's right
[34:50] they always wondered about brother
[34:52] Branham why he would choose and go and
[34:56] have a meeting there with a few people
[34:57] and here they want him to come over here
[35:00] and have a meeting with so many thousand
[35:02] people and no no he said I just whatever
[35:04] the Lord wants that's what I want a man
[35:07] because most preachers and avenges today
[35:09] prefer bigger churches bigger groups
[35:12] bigger this bigger that but God is in
[35:15] simplicity a man God as among the few
[35:19] again that's what he said we're where I
[35:21] have gathered two or three in my name
[35:24] there am I in the myths and most today
[35:27] wouldn't wouldn't even consider that
[35:29] God's with them that God has in them all
[35:31] that they're just a couple of people
[35:34] they're just religious der kultur
[35:36] fanatics well thank God Jesus was
[35:39] considered a fanatic a man and knowing
[35:42] that the following of Jesus was
[35:44] considered a cult even back then oh yeah
[35:46] because they said he was of the devil
[35:48] they said he was born of fornication
[35:50] they found all the fault they could with
[35:52] Jesus and the few had apostles and
[35:55] disciples that were following his
[35:57] message a man but even even with the
[36:01] disciples and so it is we believers
[36:03] today they didn't have the full
[36:05] revelation of what God was doing
[36:08] no no because to them it was a shock
[36:11] that Jesus would go to Jerusalem to be
[36:13] betrayed it was a shock to them that
[36:15] Jesus would lay down his life yeah but
[36:18] brother if it was even a shock when he
[36:20] picked it up again a man because they
[36:23] weren't they weren't expecting that no
[36:25] no but he told him he was going to do
[36:27] that he lay down his life pick it up
[36:29] again and he would come back to them so
[36:32] brothers sister as it was then so it is
[36:34] now in the revelation of our door
[36:37] Jesus Christ and we'll read a scriptures
[36:39] surely where Jesus is trying to
[36:41] highlight to them what God was doing in
[36:43] their day but they never recognized it a
[36:46] man to them it was God what God did you
[36:49] know back so many thousand years and God
[36:52] I'll tell you this to a lot of believers
[36:54] to still basing their faith on history
[36:58] they're still based a faith in what God
[37:00] has done but still not recognizing what
[37:03] God's doing a man so the grace of God be
[37:06] with us to help us to get into the truth
[37:09] get into the word to have faith so that
[37:11] no more questions we didn't we believe
[37:13] it there's no more doubt we believe it
[37:15] Amen yes and that's why we're here
[37:18] that's why we act the way we act talked
[37:20] the way we talk is that we believe what
[37:22] God is doing
[37:23] Oh what about what he's done well we
[37:25] believe that but we wouldn't we wouldn't
[37:28] know we wouldn't recognize what he's
[37:29] doing it if we didn't see what he did
[37:31] amen
[37:32] so he's recognizing the past we see him
[37:35] in the president a man oh he started
[37:37] that but he's still working on this and
[37:39] he's gonna he's gonna do this if that's
[37:41] that's what his aim is by the grace of
[37:43] God so brother he got a purpose when God
[37:47] did this he had a purpose down the road
[37:49] now that's the thing that man doesn't
[37:51] see but God wants man just to believe it
[37:54] do it and just trust him amen amen and
[37:58] then it'll come to pass in their lives
[38:00] by the grace of God amen
[38:04] so grace of God be with us we will be
[38:06] going into a short date by the Prophet
[38:09] well short I guess to our feelings it's
[38:14] what we would hear we'll be just maybe
[38:17] around just over an hour
[38:18] a man so that's that's not long for
[38:21] brother Branham but also to bring
[38:24] greetings to to the Saints from our
[38:29] brother Heber Reeves and he's in st.
[38:32] Lawrence and I was speaking with him on
[38:37] the phone and he told me to pass my
[38:39] greetings on to the Saints here and to
[38:42] thanked him for their prayers and we
[38:44] pray the grace of God to be with him
[38:46] because he has done a tremendous job in
[38:49] looking after
[38:50] our church cemetery in that area that is
[38:55] just off the city Lawrence I way there
[38:57] so any fact a friend of his told him
[39:02] that he said that cemetery looks like an
[39:04] airport because he's got if everything
[39:08] is so neat and tidy everything is done
[39:10] and he got lates even on the put the
[39:12] posts all around the cemetery and he got
[39:15] late saw the to sentence to graveyards
[39:17] that are there oh yeah
[39:18] and they said looks like an airport well
[39:21] it is they take their final flight from
[39:24] here to glory amen so I thought that was
[39:27] good so I pray God give them the
[39:29] revelation of it but our brother Timur
[39:32] does go up with a lawnmower that he sets
[39:34] on and you go through it and he'll clean
[39:37] the whole yard a man so he keeps it up
[39:40] to date and he did have an issue there
[39:44] because somebody apparently he doesn't
[39:46] know who it is but somebody had through
[39:49] with a vehicle they had backed into the
[39:51] the gate leading into the cemetery and
[39:54] they bent the gate but there's no way
[39:57] that he can find out who did it he
[39:59] reported it even to the police but he
[40:00] said there's nothing we can do about it
[40:02] a man so God be with our brother Eber a
[40:06] man as he does what he does and he's
[40:09] doing it for us he's doing it of course
[40:11] for sister Greene who is whose body is
[40:14] there he's doing it for his wife Eileen
[40:17] and I was it's hard to believe I thought
[40:20] it might be just a couple of years no I
[40:22] said this December be three years amen
[40:25] so we pray the grace of God that God
[40:27] rest their souls in glory amen
[40:31] and the same time god bless our brother
[40:33] he Burchard keeping the cemetery up and
[40:37] tidy amen
[40:38] and also to pray for the grace of God
[40:45] again as we I guess we mentioned in
[40:48] central to flan concerning to the church
[40:50] fire that they had there and I'm not
[40:53] sure it was in the ceiling or underneath
[40:57] the building they say it was wiring a
[41:02] lot of the build abilities been there
[41:04] for
[41:04] a while so I don't know exactly what
[41:06] happened but they're waiting for to get
[41:09] word from the fire department and I
[41:11] would say that will be after the holiday
[41:13] on Tuesday and also the insurance so
[41:18] God's grace I don't know if they're
[41:20] meeting today or not whether they would
[41:23] have to meet maybe and I in a home then
[41:25] they certainly can because they might
[41:27] have as many there as we got here I'm
[41:30] not sure
[41:31] so the grace of God be with them amen
[41:33] that they'll still stay with the word
[41:35] listen grace to help us never to get the
[41:38] idea that we're believers because we're
[41:41] in the message don't think that no no
[41:44] believers are moving by the Spirit of
[41:47] God doing what God is doing now they're
[41:49] caught up with that revelation Amen
[41:51] there into that not not just say I'm in
[41:54] the message and I believe the message
[41:56] yeah well again I gotta keep telling you
[41:58] so does the devil a man he's in the
[42:00] message he believes the message he does
[42:03] that's why he's come down with great
[42:04] wrath knowing his time is short
[42:07] amen so I progressed that we're going to
[42:09] have more faith than what the devil got
[42:11] he saw what God did he sees what God is
[42:15] doing and he knows his time is short a
[42:17] man so I pray that he's seeing it in you
[42:20] and seeing it in me and and he realized
[42:22] his time is short because there's a
[42:24] people there that's looking up there's a
[42:26] people there is this he's looking down
[42:27] but there's a bride just looking up for
[42:30] the resurrection of the rapture to God
[42:32] be the glory amen amen so thank God for
[42:36] what he's done thank God for what he is
[42:39] doing
[42:40] amen the Lord bless you and again the
[42:43] message that we're going to hear is when
[42:48] it was printed it was called the uniting
[42:50] time and sign but it has been retitled
[42:54] to the sign of the uniting time not just
[42:59] a read night uniting time and sign it is
[43:02] to sign the emphasis is on the sign of
[43:04] the of the uniting time so god help us
[43:08] to recognize the sign and brother the
[43:11] sign we need look for now is is the
[43:14] unity and it's the uniting of the bright
[43:18] a man as exactly he said we're coming
[43:20] together in what in in the faith and
[43:22] we're looking for the resurrection and
[43:25] the rapture looking for the marriage
[43:26] supper of the Lamb so he's bringing out
[43:28] the sign of the uniting time and brother
[43:32] where the bride's uniting
[43:33] but you can rest assured that the
[43:35] religious people of the world are
[43:37] uniting a man and we know that they'll
[43:39] come under the Antichrist but by the
[43:42] grace of God I trust were under Christ
[43:44] not the Antichrist grace grace grace we
[43:49] got to make our calling and election
[43:50] sure because unfortunately there's going
[43:52] to be many many many in the message but
[43:55] they're not going to make it no no the
[43:57] prophet knew that even before he went
[44:00] off to see that most of the people that
[44:03] professed the message wasn't gonna make
[44:04] it and even the older brothers and
[44:07] sisters back then he told brother Li
[44:10] Vail he said our older brothers and
[44:12] sisters will will go he said before the
[44:14] rapture why because they wouldn't have
[44:18] that faith but does us we have that
[44:23] faith of the resurrection and the
[44:25] rapture not a doctrine but a faith in
[44:30] the reality of it now the resurrection
[44:33] now the rapture now the bride did of the
[44:36] run the Prophet is say he said the
[44:38] rapture is going on now is we're moving
[44:43] in into that by the grace of God and
[44:46] we're being cut off by the grace of God
[44:48] a man is going on till finally the final
[44:51] phase of the catching up is the change
[44:55] of our bodies we're about to get a body
[44:57] Naqada is glorified body amen as it is
[45:00] written again in the word that the dead
[45:02] in Christ shall rise first then we which
[45:04] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[45:07] together with them amen
[45:10] there's a uniting here around the word
[45:12] and then there's a uniting with the
[45:14] Saints that are gone on being the
[45:16] resurrection to bring the rapture by the
[45:19] grace of God oh yeah brother oh thank
[45:22] you lord a man will just read the
[45:24] scripture and we assure you that as as
[45:27] Jesus was uniting with those that are
[45:29] gone on and they were
[45:31] uniting with him so we are uniting with
[45:33] those that are gone on they're going to
[45:34] come back and unite with us in the
[45:36] rapture a man and it's in the word Jesus
[45:40] did the same thing by the grace of God
[45:42] so the Lord bless you
[45:44] turn with me to st. Matthew's Gospel
[45:48] chapter 17 a man so the grace of God be
[45:55] with us that we're going to hear what
[45:57] God wants us to hear we're going to see
[45:59] what God wants us to see amen and thank
[46:03] God for the opportunity after that we'll
[46:05] continue our fellowship as we go to our
[46:08] sister Amber's a man and brother
[46:10] Matthews for fellowship and for their
[46:13] fellowship physically food and also
[46:15] spiritual food praise the Lord
[46:17] so god bless them and in Matthew chapter
[46:20] 17 and he said and after six days or we
[46:27] could say six Church ages Jesus taketh
[46:32] Peter James and John his brother and
[46:35] bringing them up into an high mountain
[46:37] apart so God took his seat up into a
[46:42] mountain and it says and he was
[46:45] transfigured before them and his face
[46:48] did shine as the Sun and his raiment was
[46:51] weight as the light a man consider what
[46:55] Jesus was experiencing here now Christ
[46:58] in the bride is experiencing the same
[47:00] thing that we are caught up and weird to
[47:03] have fellowship with those that are gone
[47:04] on and behold there appeared unto them
[47:08] Moses and Elijah talking with them a man
[47:14] as our brother was telling me one time
[47:17] not of the message and he was saying oh
[47:20] the dead are dead and they don't know
[47:23] anything well I said they do know
[47:26] something I said they don't know
[47:27] anything about this world and I said you
[47:29] better read it read the context and I
[47:32] said what they're talking about but I
[47:34] said the dead are conscious they're
[47:36] they're aware of what's going on I said
[47:38] well I said where did Moses and Elijah
[47:39] come from are they dead they were caught
[47:42] up where I said throw
[47:44] to not date their very consciousness of
[47:47] this dimension and I said they appeared
[47:49] to Jesus on the Mount of Transfiguration
[47:51] so I said the day that I gone on in the
[47:54] Lord by the grace of God I said they're
[47:56] very conscious and I said now we know to
[47:58] what advisor what about the rich man
[48:01] when he went at the bow so he lifted up
[48:03] his eyes in hell being in torment a man
[48:06] now that wasn't the lake of fire
[48:08] that was that was elf with where they on
[48:11] the unrighteous go a man they go into a
[48:14] place of torment but Lazarus lifted up
[48:17] his eyes in the bosom of Abraham and I
[48:19] pray God forgive the sister that made
[48:21] light of it when she said oh hey bruh
[48:23] must have a big bosom and he and he does
[48:26] because his bosom was faith he made so
[48:29] as that has the faith of Abraham so so
[48:32] Lazarus had the faith of Abram and he
[48:34] went into that dimension where Abraham
[48:35] was a man but the rich young ruler went
[48:38] into a place of torment amen too late
[48:40] because he turned down the word a man he
[48:44] wanted it his way but not God's Way a
[48:46] man he was doing God a service but
[48:49] without God's will a man he did jesus
[48:53] said do this this and this he's I've
[48:54] done from my youth up and so on where
[48:57] Jesus if one thing thou lackest
[49:00] do you like anything one thing they like
[49:03] us and oh what do you want me to do
[49:06] he says sell all you got give to the
[49:08] poor come follow me a man no way again
[49:12] as somebody mentioned to us when we're
[49:15] in the restaurant the other day they
[49:16] said you know it's the truth he says not
[49:19] money is the root of all evil he said
[49:22] it's the love of money and I said that's
[49:26] right yes you're right I said doesn't
[49:28] say money is but the love of money is
[49:30] the root of all evil and he said we're
[49:34] living in that world well I thought
[49:36] myself god bless him and for and again
[49:40] was the manager of the restaurant that
[49:41] we're in and so on so that was good
[49:44] thank the Lord I honors and respects our
[49:46] faith and he's there to encourage our
[49:48] faith and he's and he's just telling
[49:51] what's going on in the world crazy world
[49:52] and he figures he believes to like we
[49:55] believe it's finished it's seeing and it
[49:57] is
[49:58] we're living in the end of all things
[50:00] for the world but it's we're going from
[50:03] time to eternity a man it's not an end
[50:06] for us we're going to change our
[50:09] dimensions and there appeared on to them
[50:13] Moses and Elijah talking with him amen
[50:18] see not just visions not just dreams and
[50:22] they see this they see that they saw
[50:24] them and they heard them a man they
[50:26] spoke and then answered Peter and said
[50:30] unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be
[50:33] here if thou wilt let us make here three
[50:37] Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses
[50:40] one for Elijah as he was religious not
[50:45] spiritual but he was religious he wanted
[50:48] to make you want to make two or three
[50:49] denominations a man one for Jesus one
[50:54] for Moses and one for Elijah and why do
[50:56] you speak be all a Bray cloud
[50:58] overshadowed them and be all a voice of
[51:02] the claw out of the cloud which said
[51:05] this is my beloved Son in whom I am well
[51:09] pleased hear ye him
[51:11] don't put the emphasis on the messenger
[51:13] when it comes when it comes to Moses and
[51:15] Elijah let's plant the EM still in the
[51:17] wonder pointing to Alleluia and they
[51:20] prophesied so many thousand years before
[51:22] it came to pass they were proper sign of
[51:24] it a man took to Israel now they came in
[51:28] backing back into time to meet the
[51:32] Messiah that they prophesied out amen Oh
[51:35] brothers sister it was real to them I
[51:38] pray it's as real to us praise the Lord
[51:42] this is my beloved Son in whom I am well
[51:45] pleased hear ye him and when the
[51:50] disciples heard it they fell on their
[51:52] face and were sore afraid and Jesus came
[51:56] and touched them and said arise and be
[52:01] not afraid
[52:03] you're going to experience tension but
[52:06] be not afraid
[52:07] oh yeah the Christian life is the life
[52:11] of tension
[52:12] and when they had lifted up their eyes
[52:15] they saw no man save Jesus only God help
[52:20] us that we're going to see Jesus only
[52:22] amen and as they came down from the
[52:25] mountain Jesus charged them saying tell
[52:29] the vision to no man until the Son of
[52:32] Man be risen again from the dead
[52:35] amen they didn't understand that maybe
[52:39] they thought that was going to be you
[52:41] know so many thousand years down the
[52:43] road when this Jesus they were serving
[52:44] was going to die physically and they
[52:46] would had to bury him
[52:47] oh no time into don't bury him you'll
[52:53] come out a man and it's the same as ask
[52:58] him saying when he spoke of himself
[53:03] concerning the resurrection of the Son
[53:06] of Man and did the same was asked him
[53:08] saying why they and say the scribes that
[53:10] Elisha must first come and jesus
[53:15] answered and said unto them they do
[53:19] Malachi for yeah but for the first
[53:25] coming and Jesus said he would come to
[53:28] introduce the first coming he would come
[53:29] to introduce the second coming a man
[53:32] that's that's clear just bear with me he
[53:40] I was saying you Elijah the Prophet
[53:42] before the coming of the Great and
[53:44] dreadful day of the Lord and he shall
[53:48] turn the heart of the father's to the
[53:51] children
[53:52] turns out of the Jewish fathers to the
[53:55] Pentecostal children but he lied to us
[53:58] also to come and to turn the hearts of
[54:01] the children now they're Pentecostal
[54:03] children back to the father's they may
[54:06] because they've gotten away from what
[54:08] God did 2,000 years ago so now John was
[54:12] there to turn their the father's to the
[54:14] children and they refused it now is to
[54:16] turn the children back to the father's a
[54:18] man brother sister see and he said last
[54:24] I
[54:24] and smite the earth with a curse a man
[54:28] so is this first coming
[54:30] Alleluia place the little of your son
[54:31] that he can just it's the first coming
[54:34] and the second coming
[54:35] a man Elijah really comes I think
[54:40] there's four or five times because it's
[54:43] the original Elijah there's Elijah and
[54:45] then there's John
[54:46] and then there's william branham and
[54:48] then there's the elijah to the event
[54:50] back to the jews five times amen and
[54:54] Moses is going to be there as well
[54:56] father God said it might be two men with
[54:58] their spirit it might be them or two men
[55:01] with their spirit he believed there was
[55:02] going to be two men with their spirit a
[55:04] man as there was in this hour with the
[55:07] spirit Elijah
[55:08] so was it back in Italy love o my Elijah
[55:14] he was Elijah he had he had the spirit
[55:18] of Elijah and so on I come on down John
[55:21] at the spirit Elijah and brother Branham
[55:24] in the spirit Elijah now there's gonna
[55:26] be another with the spirit of Elijah to
[55:27] the Jews a man praise the name of the
[55:31] Lord this is God's pattern this is how
[55:33] God does things and they said why then
[55:36] say the scribes that Elias relied you
[55:39] must first come and jesus answered and
[55:41] said unto them Elijah truly shall first
[55:45] come but this wasn't John and restore
[55:50] all things that was in the end time but
[55:56] I say unto you that Elijah is come
[55:58] already and they knew him not but have
[56:01] done unto him whatsoever they listed
[56:03] likewise also the Son of man shall
[56:06] suffer of them those that took John one
[56:09] of the death they're gonna take Jesus
[56:10] and put him to death amen but at the
[56:13] same time he was plenty to another
[56:14] Elijah further up the road it was going
[56:17] to restore all things a man hallelujah
[56:20] amen all that was lost down through the
[56:23] dark ages he's going to restore by the
[56:25] grace of God amen then the disciples
[56:29] understood that he spake to them
[56:31] concerning that first coming he spake to
[56:33] them of John the Baptist
[56:35] amen god bless to our hearts issuer
[56:38] a man god help us to recognize it to
[56:44] have the faith a man to take our stand
[56:49] for what God has done and what God is
[56:52] doing amen
[56:54] in the message uniting time and sign in
[56:57] Brenham Tabernacle in Jeffersonville in
[57:01] August of 1963 a few months after the
[57:05] opening the seals
[57:07] before he got into the sermon I want to
[57:09] share with you just a few thoughts there
[57:12] that he had expressed concerning tension
[57:14] a man he had gone through a lot of
[57:17] tension he experienced a lot of tension
[57:19] but he also said that believers will
[57:22] experience tension a man and he said I
[57:26] was praying and he said about it this
[57:29] morning he said what would you do if you
[57:32] didn't have tension you compromise and
[57:38] he said just think of it tension is a
[57:41] part of living and it is he said that
[57:45] kind of encouraged me when I thought
[57:47] that he said have you had no tension
[57:50] you'd be like a rag doll and he said you
[57:52] wouldn't have no feelings and there'd be
[57:55] nothing he said you could work on he
[57:57] said like a husband and a wife maybe if
[57:59] she wants to do something and they're
[58:01] trying to work together especially
[58:03] Christians and he said then he said when
[58:07] you come together to find out what she's
[58:09] done and she and he said see the tension
[58:12] really brings you closer together a man
[58:15] and somebody tells you well said just
[58:19] think of the little wife that went under
[58:21] a lot of tension when you wasn't good or
[58:23] the husband went under tension when she
[58:25] wasn't good and he said then when it's
[58:28] all forgiven
[58:29] see he said look you you felt this you
[58:33] feel that but he's to see you've got to
[58:36] have tension that's all and just think
[58:39] of feelings he said what if you didn't
[58:42] have any feeling
[58:43] he said no pains or nothing what if
[58:46] there'd be no pain at all he said you'd
[58:49] have no feelings at all and if you had
[58:51] feelings then one of your census would
[58:54] be gone so he said see everything is
[58:59] just right any out so God just give us
[59:02] grace to stand up to it he said that's
[59:06] the thing we need the grace of God to
[59:08] take our stand now because to remain
[59:11] separate unto the Lord is becoming more
[59:14] and more and more challenging it's right
[59:16] and it's going to get even more
[59:18] challenging as time goes on as I said by
[59:22] losing our registration with governments
[59:24] and all other churches out there other
[59:26] groups are there they'll lose their
[59:27] registration because the government will
[59:29] try to force them to unite with this
[59:31] church or that church or some other
[59:33] church that's been that's been
[59:34] registered for so many years and years
[59:36] and years a man because there's so many
[59:39] thousand non charitable organizations
[59:42] registered with the government in Canada
[59:43] and brother if the pressure is on for
[59:45] more money they're going to try to to
[59:48] get less and less and less nonprofit
[59:50] organizations a man and that's why
[59:53] they're going to take take their
[59:54] registration a man so things are good
[59:56] tension is going to increase and
[59:58] increase and increase but by the grace
[1:00:00] of God the elect of God are going to
[1:00:02] stay with the Word of God a man but
[1:00:05] you're going to experience tension so he
[1:00:08] said God just give us grace to stand up
[1:00:10] to it that's the thing and he said if I
[1:00:13] just stand up with that grace and stand
[1:00:16] there and he said we know that when life
[1:00:18] is over
[1:00:19] the great ones on the other side where
[1:00:21] we're looking to go a man remember that
[1:00:25] all these things there's tension and
[1:00:27] some people tries to introduce
[1:00:29] Christianity that you're free from worry
[1:00:32] and they do not view a thing - and
[1:00:36] you're in the message you'd have nothing
[1:00:37] to worry about but I thought it is with
[1:00:39] the greater the revelation the rate of
[1:00:41] the tension and the reign of the
[1:00:43] responsibility God requires more of us
[1:00:45] than he does of the rest ain't man
[1:00:48] because he gave us more revelation and
[1:00:51] he said oh he said you had tension he
[1:00:54] said when you become a Christian or
[1:00:57] should they say there you're free from
[1:00:59] worry you don't have to be afraid of
[1:01:01] anything and you're free from tension no
[1:01:03] he says you're too
[1:01:05] you attention when you become a
[1:01:06] Christian because each of you is kind of

[1:12:08] walk in our truth unite my heart you
[1:12:12] fear thy head unit ECU night my heart to
[1:12:18] fear God me I'm talkin are of unity and
[1:12:23] time side now in the sixteenth chapter
[1:12:26] of st. Matthew the Pharisees also with
[1:12:31] the Sadducees came tempting him desiring
[1:12:35] him that he would show them a sign from
[1:12:38] heaven and he answered instead of them
[1:12:41] when it is easy you say ah if will be
[1:12:45] fair weather for the sky is red and in
[1:12:49] the morning it will be Lord foul weather
[1:12:54] today for the sky is really Lord o you
[1:12:58] hypocrites you can discern the face of
[1:13:01] the sky but you cannot discern the signs
[1:13:04] of the time the Lord is gracious
[1:13:09] blessing to the reading of this world
[1:13:12] now we're talking of this uniting
[1:13:18] uniting paths the sign of the uniting
[1:13:23] paths these Jesus was here in this life
[1:13:28] scripture reading he was
[1:13:30] the clergy for not being able to deserve
[1:13:36] the time or the sign of the time now
[1:13:41] they have always been a great thing to
[1:13:44] the people these to be able to deserve
[1:13:47] the sign of the time that you're living
[1:13:51] they called God rides it plainly so
[1:13:54] nobody could escape it now our duty our
[1:13:58] desire can pick up from other ministers
[1:14:01] or other servants of the Lord in the
[1:14:04] Bible time like the side and north time
[1:14:06] desires Daniels Timon and so forth the
[1:14:10] different signs but I want to bypass
[1:14:12] that tonight the same time to be able
[1:14:17] but it's always been God's way to give
[1:14:21] em our natural sign of the time so that
[1:14:25] everyone would know just what time is
[1:14:28] lost and these Pharisees should have
[1:14:33] known there's half they should have
[1:14:35] known what the time was he said in
[1:14:38] another place if you would have known me
[1:14:40] you to know in my day it is very a great
[1:14:46] thing that we understand thee without
[1:14:49] understanding that what they always
[1:14:52] refers to the prophets about they did
[1:14:55] and he had understanding by vision from
[1:14:57] the law and the word of the Lord came to
[1:15:00] the prophets of old see they had
[1:15:03] understanding to the word the Lord by
[1:15:05] the Prophet and then the prophets give a
[1:15:08] sign like one man late only side for so
[1:15:11] long then turned overlaid on the other
[1:15:13] side one manís to these closing all
[1:15:15] there's many
[1:15:16] this is to show the sign that they were
[1:15:20] living him now
[1:15:23] we know that the God that made heaven
[1:15:26] verses and surah laid out his work and
[1:15:31] he would describe his hands by sign that
[1:15:35] same God lives today even so we must be
[1:15:39] for something as we see the the time
[1:15:43] that we're living in there must be
[1:15:46] something if somebody's over living
[1:15:48] somewhere Aaron they call God will never
[1:15:51] let these things happen without giving
[1:15:53] us a business side that were they would
[1:15:59] understand how here is the same today
[1:16:02] the third ecology we all read it right
[1:16:06] it's just like it was then they didn't
[1:16:09] think that it was hot they thought that
[1:16:12] they were living pretty peaceful and so
[1:16:14] this wasn't looking for no Messiah and
[1:16:16] Jesus has said that his calling would be
[1:16:19] as a thief in the night when the when
[1:16:22] the people would be unaware of his
[1:16:24] coming but there were some of the
[1:16:26] versions that went to meet him half of
[1:16:28] them had all in their life and was ready
[1:16:31] they were watching for that side and
[1:16:33] that's what I'm speaking to proxy so
[1:16:36] those who are living for the side now
[1:16:38] the side is coming these signs given by
[1:16:42] the Lord is given only to believers the
[1:16:46] unbelievers never see it they go right
[1:16:49] over the top of them and they don't see
[1:16:51] it and I just assure
[1:16:54] that an angel of God could stand on this
[1:16:57] platform tonight just as true as I'm
[1:17:00] looking to shoot I could be looking at
[1:17:02] it or you could be looking at it I could
[1:17:04] see your heart to look at it and you
[1:17:05] could see it now you know that special
[1:17:08] that's exactly the truth they saw your
[1:17:11] those halls fell down but they learned
[1:17:13] to see that light that light was right
[1:17:15] there when John stood there before the
[1:17:18] altitudes and thousands out on the back
[1:17:21] there bulge a minute and say just great
[1:17:25] man and John said himself before letter
[1:17:28] to see the Spirit of God descending like
[1:17:30] a building come down are born near the
[1:17:32] voice singing this is my beloved Son in
[1:17:34] whom I'm pleased to dwell and nobody
[1:17:37] thought the job it was just for him
[1:17:41] you notice how vivid the side for a wise
[1:17:45] man they looked it was they were Hebrews
[1:17:48] they wasn't really engine as astronomers
[1:17:51] they were Hebrews because they were up
[1:17:54] there in that country studying astronomy
[1:17:57] to finish their education and when they
[1:18:00] was Jerusalem and knowing if they saw
[1:18:05] those three stars from each one of the
[1:18:07] first pass of hand Shannon APIs of which
[1:18:11] raised account rakesh and we've seen
[1:18:13] them stars in the big past that was a
[1:18:16] sign to them that when those stars were
[1:18:19] in line the Messiah I was always oh no
[1:18:29] where is he the born King of the Jews we
[1:18:34] saw his star in the east and have come
[1:18:36] to worship Him were heavy they know that
[1:18:39] that infant massage was laying somewhere
[1:18:42] the car of God
[1:18:45] a sign of the time they God and man were
[1:18:50] uniting together water unity when God
[1:18:55] United himself a human boss the suitable
[1:18:59] the greatest of all the uniting that
[1:19:01] ever was done with God United with
[1:19:04] manage lettuce his great pain of being
[1:19:09] caught and stretched forth his Tiffin
[1:19:11] humanity and become one unity
[1:19:16] what their peace between God and man
[1:19:20] forever how thankful we are and science
[1:19:25] was not said I just think if we made in
[1:19:29] all the astronomers of people then be
[1:19:32] there drops was the star they was a
[1:19:35] watchman what I thought top of the of
[1:19:37] the tower and he was a gif and watching
[1:19:40] he seen when a certain stars is in
[1:19:42] certain constellations as they were
[1:19:44] passing he didn't want and it was never
[1:19:47] in the scriptures or what time is it
[1:19:49] Watchmen and the Watchmen come back and
[1:19:51] told him II wonder how it was
[1:19:53] see they said time of a star is this
[1:19:56] strange that these stars were laughing
[1:20:01] in line for three men and nobody else or
[1:20:06] just exactly in line ah you can be so
[1:20:10] wrong with the scripture see when those
[1:20:15] stars become in unity
[1:20:17] your bodies themselves together in this
[1:20:20] consolation dream at the same time and
[1:20:27] you can be realities you might have
[1:20:39] knows how it's all dogs in but yours is
[1:20:41] a dog there do you you're United with
[1:20:46] the world and here is then it's
[1:20:50] absolutely life for the past once there
[1:20:53] was one when you see this sign you're
[1:20:56] not with the believers is that true I'm
[1:20:59] addressing this Jew is a believer
[1:21:01] well the unbelievers never see it and
[1:21:03] Prada a refugee with the appears on
[1:21:06] earth today too many of our clergy today
[1:21:09] who cannot read this fact the science
[1:21:12] that we're reading daily here's the
[1:21:13] tabernacle and seeing the things of
[1:21:16] every religion and seeing the
[1:21:18] handwriting in there and just ignored
[1:21:22] don't even see it all it's nothing to
[1:21:24] them at all they don't notice it now
[1:21:27] notice that ended they were here he
[1:21:31] crawled out national side when they
[1:21:35] asked him about this award size he gave
[1:21:37] him times that happened and they want to
[1:21:40] know why be the end of the world what
[1:21:42] would be the sign at the end and he's
[1:21:44] taller than many places to the scripture
[1:21:46] about national sign of our heavenly sign
[1:21:49] in the heavens and frisbee size he get
[1:21:53] in Thein Thein Sun and just constantly
[1:21:57] Oh God and when the heat old man and one
[1:22:03] taste about a national side he says when
[1:22:05] you see the nation he began to gather
[1:22:10] around Jerusalem see then we know that
[1:22:15] the time of the trial

[1:22:21] army now before they do this got the
[1:22:26] wave heads of unite titles the straight
[1:22:29] Roman general head of United's armies
[1:22:31] together and call around after these
[1:22:37] Jews had rejected the god-given sign of
[1:22:42] the time today that's the time that
[1:22:45] Titus United his armies together and
[1:22:49] come to take the city first there had to
[1:22:53] be a uniting of God's people they kiss
[1:22:59] the world bar before the nation could
[1:23:04] unite itself against God's people you

[1:23:36] race the city power just before the
[1:23:39] coming carbonara cheeses uniting
[1:23:44] together and getting ready now you see

[1:23:57] would not believe
[1:23:59] to be the massage be rejecting him and
[1:24:03] turning off a crazy body and then one
[1:24:07] day we checked it the salvation that was
[1:24:11] said to them they unite themselves
[1:24:13] together to do it the whole daddy mama
[1:24:16] uniting himself together to reject the
[1:24:19] message of the hour they had to do this
[1:24:23] and then we'll give you that spend the
[1:24:26] national side come and the nation's
[1:24:29] begin to unite themselves together and
[1:24:32] tired of all this grief all his Romans

[1:24:47] eat the grass off the ground either bore
[1:24:50] one of the children that they were mad
[1:24:53] people and then when finally Titus he is
[1:24:57] sitting back upon the hills around
[1:24:58] Jerusalem and and those people have
[1:25:01] thought they were doing the will of God
[1:25:03] when they saw these armies marching in
[1:25:05] he has refused to hear that great master

[1:25:46] now it is that easy praise is that was
[1:25:49] either Jesus Jesus you indict yourself
[1:26:12] and him and not with some organization
[1:26:15] some church free you're not the Christ
[1:26:18] these shirts have you can't just like
[1:26:21] anything you've got to be positive at it
[1:26:24] still for the higher of Union now we
[1:26:28] find out that they rejected in the saw
[1:26:31] and then United themselves together
[1:26:33] involved in self belief and they're an
[1:26:36] emotion among them that if any persons
[1:26:39] receive Jesus as a prophet that they
[1:26:42] would be excommunicated from the church
[1:26:44] remember the blind boy that was sets of
[1:26:47] flies the disciples that who's seeing
[1:26:50] him or his father's mother Jesus said in
[1:26:52] this case neither but that the works of
[1:26:54] God might be done they know and you
[1:26:56] remember it they said that the father
[1:26:58] mother could not say they said they know
[1:27:01] this is our son but we don't know how
[1:27:03] with you because the jesus said that any
[1:27:06] person that the confession to be in the
[1:27:09] profits that they would be
[1:27:11] excommunicated but see the works of God
[1:27:14] WA that this party blogs that group and
[1:27:17] he said are the strange thing to me that
[1:27:19] you over here this man come from and yet
[1:27:20] you give me outside me now you can say
[1:27:23] it see that was the worst of God is this
[1:27:25] may healed and he get away land he could
[1:27:27] he could tell us the car yellow strange
[1:27:30] times in from anywhere
[1:27:31] he was the wonder works was down and he
[1:27:35] certainly saw boys for his first time in
[1:27:37] his life down suit using item self
[1:27:41] against Jesus and and against his
[1:27:44] massage ship that here's the site
[1:27:46] message we see the same vein now just a
[1:27:51] singing thing
[1:27:52] carnism is you know to destroy the
[1:27:55] church and the only way to it that is as
[1:27:59] the church has United itself you and the
[1:28:03] Council of Churches the World Council
[1:28:05] judges the to do now as you destroy the
[1:28:10] message the water amen they have turned
[1:28:14] down the world the churches has but they
[1:28:18] cannot accept it because of the
[1:28:21] interdenominational creed no matter how
[1:28:23] many pillars of file and hanging up in
[1:28:26] the midst of people how many people the
[1:28:29] Tommies things to be foretold and
[1:28:32] happens all of this signs that he
[1:28:34] promised of the last days they can not
[1:28:37] good therefore they are uniting
[1:28:41] themselves now and your pastor here in
[1:28:44] many continues reading that fear has a
[1:28:48] political a movement of the the world
[1:28:52] and these Lutheran minister over that if
[1:28:56] there comes a disaster would happen in
[1:28:58] this neighborhood here if we are not
[1:29:01] United with that a political move then
[1:29:05] our church cannot all be church and they
[1:29:08] can use it for a showroom or if word of
[1:29:10] feathers would see somebody dying or her
[1:29:13] and hire a minister him any spiritual
[1:29:16] we could be shot for yes we can begin 10
[1:29:21] years the federal prison for ministering
[1:29:24] any to try or without a member of this
[1:29:26] economic remote don't you see the mark
[1:29:28] of the beast so we see this uniting time
[1:29:34] coming this immense the church as United
[1:29:38] itself or gifts phonetic and then one is
[1:29:42] a fact the nation's are you nodding
[1:29:44] themselves in communism to discard to
[1:29:46] church again one did in the first place
[1:29:50] it repeats itself right back in him
[1:29:54] yes all has returned down the message
[1:29:56] first and when they turn down the
[1:29:59] message then the military the national
[1:30:03] life unites himself together of other
[1:30:05] nations they come in and destroy the
[1:30:08] church and today they turn down the
[1:30:12] message of the Lord Jesus I mean kind of
[1:30:16] doubt and man the kind of toggle
[1:30:19] colleges together kiss the church here
[1:30:27] has to be that way by trying to say that
[1:30:30] it was horrible and choose to resist our
[1:30:32] brethren we see this our God is with us
[1:30:37] in so wheel will go into the temple and

[1:31:38] then were they rejected him answer the
[1:31:41] message of that day they rejected the
[1:31:44] message of that they say no to see the
[1:31:46] fire they tried their Bible prophecy was
[1:31:52] made before the visit

[1:33:57] let me hear the scripture and see where
[1:33:59] this he promise of what he would do now
[1:34:02] I would come at the past we've seen in
[1:34:05] the church what he promised to do we see
[1:34:07] it coming to pass we see the nation's
[1:34:09] uniting together we see the here from
[1:34:12] uniting together we see the church's
[1:34:14] unity together get United
[1:34:17] it's the out of unity that's the spirit
[1:34:21] age we're stopping your night baby
[1:34:25] thank you pop it out a custody order
[1:34:28] even
[1:34:29] they receded yeah you guys assessment I
[1:34:33] see as a citizen is assisting United
[1:34:36] States yes I give you a check the
[1:34:39] goggles I began to put my name on
[1:34:41] theocracy see here some uniting times I
[1:34:44] also see some union of some sort and
[1:34:47] that you need is a very famous place a
[1:34:49] mark of the beast is working right I'll
[1:34:55] appeal to that should you see it yes
[1:34:57] with your playing odds if you look at it
[1:34:59] it's a uniting time where everything is
[1:35:02] uniting together that you know a Jew's
[1:35:05] unite themselves against Jesus essence
[1:35:07] we are servants I'll there heard we see
[1:35:09] what happens
[1:35:10] we've seen the same thing now colonies
[1:35:13] in United to destroy teachers and it's
[1:35:15] the church as United in the World
[1:35:17] Council of Churches and trying to
[1:35:20] destroy the message the water dog yeah
[1:35:25] the only thing they can do is to call
[1:35:27] themselves a powerful because they're
[1:35:30] separated little group here invested
[1:35:32] it's a Baptist losing the first air just
[1:35:34] Christ
[1:35:34] so for right yet they can't do nothing
[1:35:36] cause this will be a consistent this to
[1:35:38] be against that in the adoption is this
[1:35:40] is much different than the easiest of
[1:35:42] the way that's where the tacit your
[1:35:51] sword unity the Roman Catholic court
[1:35:54] their community to the majority is the
[1:35:56] Roman Catholic the Greek and other
[1:35:58] Catholics or not is what is wrong with
[1:36:01] traffic now then he not together not
[1:36:03] true they stand against no matter what
[1:36:05] takes place that Pope is the head of
[1:36:07] everything and Ohio watch anybody else
[1:36:10] our fighters are that's all he's next to
[1:36:15] God he says a jurisdiction over he'll
[1:36:17] he'll enhance our authority so that is
[1:36:19] the saying that can be done and that
[1:36:21] case whatever he says this one has to go
[1:36:24] not a product is missing themselves to
[1:36:27] here just like that
[1:36:28] the second Oh goodbye I said there is a
[1:36:31] huge barrier to disease what is the
[1:36:33] image of something like it they like it
[1:36:35] there is the same thing lines if I'm you
[1:36:38] hiding themselves together in this is
[1:36:40] the spirit of the cage is your body
[1:36:43] uniting together now try to destroy the
[1:36:47] message how does it destroy how could
[1:36:50] they destroy the Word of God they
[1:36:52] admitted of not effects not affected by
[1:36:56] taking traditions as diffuse back their
[1:36:58] beginning and making the will of God of
[1:37:00] War effect see this all that really
[1:37:03] after all you see what is isabel woman
[1:37:06] that try that she offered it what I mean

[2:11:27] years since I've heard that table
[2:11:29] I'll read the book but it ought to mean
[2:11:34] more to us now than it did the first
[2:11:36] time we heard it it ought to mean more
[2:11:39] to us than those that are in 63 because
[2:11:44] we're seeing oh my as our brother was
[2:11:48] talking about politics United Nations
[2:11:52] uniting churches uniting the bride
[2:11:55] uniting but brother what would it what
[2:11:58] else would he say if he were it was to
[2:12:00] minister today concerning what is
[2:12:02] uniting brother it's not only a week
[2:12:08] that goes by or a day that goes by what
[2:12:10] we're hearing about this we're in about
[2:12:11] that you're not allowed to say anything
[2:12:13] about about the the lesbians and all
[2:12:16] they're saying about the gauge and I'll
[2:12:17] ever say anything about this group or
[2:12:18] that group why because they're all
[2:12:20] uniting together that's right and so
[2:12:24] it's like I said we a lot of what we're
[2:12:28] preaching is against the law yeah and
[2:12:32] the laws of state you're not allowed to
[2:12:34] speak it you're not allowed to record it
[2:12:36] you're not allowed to write it or print
[2:12:37] it concerning anything against any
[2:12:40] identifiable group in Canada or when it
[2:12:44] comes to that if any identifiable group
[2:12:46] in the world and around the world
[2:12:48] Western nations are uniting Eastern
[2:12:50] nations are uniting communism is uniting
[2:12:53] those with those ideas and so on and
[2:12:55] churches are uniting they are but
[2:12:58] they're not uniting in the word they're
[2:13:00] uniting just under their creeds and
[2:13:02] their dogmas they're uniting when it
[2:13:04] comes to to be able to say we want if we
[2:13:07] want to still maintain Christianity but
[2:13:11] Christianity is Christ a man when it
[2:13:15] comes to when it comes to the word
[2:13:16] they're not interested in staying with
[2:13:18] the word no no it's just
[2:13:21] there there this church or that church
[2:13:23] or this denomination of that
[2:13:24] denomination but brother sister god help
[2:13:26] us in this hour that we're going to stay
[2:13:29] with the word we're going to unite with
[2:13:31] the word not without unity with this
[2:13:33] group or that group I'm going along with
[2:13:35] you I'm going along with this one I go
[2:13:37] along with no no we're going on with
[2:13:39] Jesus amen by the grace of God so it is
[2:13:43] it is a uniting time we see that in the
[2:13:46] world but the important thing is that we
[2:13:49] see it in the right
[2:13:50] there's not many going to see it in the
[2:13:52] bright they never recognize it in in the
[2:13:55] first coming of our Lord do not
[2:13:56] recognize that in the second coming of
[2:13:58] our Lord then I Road and I recognize
[2:14:00] they didn't recognize it back then when
[2:14:02] he came to lay down his life but they
[2:14:05] they didn't unite with him no no not by
[2:14:08] any means
[2:14:08] he was the sign of the Uniting time a
[2:14:10] man he was the sign and he knew he was
[2:14:14] going to Eve's gonna give us the power
[2:14:15] to unite as the Bride of Christ and so
[2:14:17] on that's the life of his blood but they
[2:14:20] didn't recognize it
[2:14:21] no brother brother and listen where
[2:14:24] there was able they didn't recognize
[2:14:26] Abel no Cain of a recognized evil came
[2:14:29] that never honored Abel he dishonored
[2:14:31] him killed him and brother all same way
[2:14:34] all the way down through when God's been
[2:14:36] there to be a bear witness of himself
[2:14:38] through his word through his service of
[2:14:40] prophets and his ministry right all the
[2:14:43] way all the way of his sons and
[2:14:45] daughters and and the enemy is there to
[2:14:49] fight the enemy is there to destroy them
[2:14:52] oh yeah
[2:14:53] they were there to destroy the prophets
[2:14:55] they're there to destroy the seed of God
[2:14:57] he of the Old Testament any even in the
[2:15:00] New Testament a man and Jesus warned
[2:15:03] again as I preached some time ago on are
[2:15:05] you able to the drink of the cup not
[2:15:07] that one no no the cup of the revealed
[2:15:10] word I'd be able to drink of the cup of
[2:15:12] the Ministry of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:15:15] because you know where this woman she
[2:15:18] went and said to Jesus I want my two
[2:15:20] sons one on your left one on your right
[2:15:22] in glory and well he said yeah but he
[2:15:26] said that's that's not for me to decide
[2:15:27] as for the father to decide but he said
[2:15:31] are you able to drink of the cup that I
[2:15:34] Drako to sit with him and his throne you
[2:15:37] got a drink of the company drink up a
[2:15:38] man and there's no oh yes we can drew
[2:15:42] that grew through them it was a very
[2:15:44] simple thing a very basic thing he said
[2:15:46] you shall indeed drink of it yeah he
[2:15:49] knew what it was but they didn't a man
[2:15:52] and it was it was to lay down their
[2:15:54] lives as he laid down his life a man the
[2:15:57] drink of the cup it was to endure the
[2:15:59] the reproach for the word as he endured
[2:16:02] it to suffer what he suffered that's
[2:16:04] what he meant are you able to drink of
[2:16:06] the cup a man and brother the the elect
[2:16:10] of God the seed of God through the
[2:16:11] baptism of the Holy Ghost as as drank of
[2:16:15] his cup amen when we said there 68
[2:16:18] million that laid down their lives then
[2:16:20] when it comes to physically but brother
[2:16:22] even those that didn't lay down their
[2:16:24] lives physically we've laid down our
[2:16:25] life spiritually for the war for the
[2:16:28] Lord as he gave up his life so we give
[2:16:30] up ours we're not living for ourselves
[2:16:32] we're living for him and brother he
[2:16:34] didn't live for himself he lived for us
[2:16:36] and he died for us amen that's what he
[2:16:39] did so I pray the grace of God that in
[2:16:43] recognizing the uniting though we're
[2:16:46] recognizing the sign of the uniting
[2:16:48] decide for the bride a man oh it's
[2:16:52] alright to see what's going on up there
[2:16:53] what would this group is uniting that
[2:16:56] good was your ninety oh it's just
[2:16:57] absolutely sinful everything you know
[2:17:01] they're recognizing that which is
[2:17:03] contrary to the word a man but brain
[2:17:05] grace at the bride recognizes her
[2:17:08] uniting sight and as he said that the
[2:17:12] right under that sign coming together
[2:17:15] under what God has done and what God is
[2:17:17] doing it's going to bring the bride into
[2:17:19] unity and the bride you you just can't
[2:17:22] get away from one another no no and
[2:17:24] that's the truth so we could say are we
[2:17:28] really bright if this is the evidence of
[2:17:31] the bride that they're uniting together
[2:17:33] and they can't stay away from one
[2:17:35] another and my bride do I have that
[2:17:37] spirit and attitude toward my brothers
[2:17:39] and sisters in the message brother so
[2:17:43] that we're out there did this church are
[2:17:45] there they're all there they're holding
[2:17:47] together
[2:17:48] and they're defending one another
[2:17:49] denominational churches and so on I was
[2:17:51] more as the break gonna be come together
[2:17:54] and much more the bride's going to love
[2:17:56] one another
[2:17:57] he said the uniting time of the bride
[2:18:00] the church is so coming together it
[2:18:03] should create such a love among us that
[2:18:06] we could only be away from one another
[2:18:13] if we take this as the evidence of the
[2:18:16] Holy Ghost do I have the Holy Ghost we
[2:18:19] think this as the evidence that I'm
[2:18:20] bright
[2:18:21] am i bright are you bright
[2:18:25] what do you come up with what do you
[2:18:29] what is it that you that you that
[2:18:30] uniting with is it just doctrine creats
[2:18:34] this this or is it with the body the
[2:18:38] body of Christ
[2:18:40] oh the word know the words in the body
[2:18:42] are united with Christ Christ was the
[2:18:45] word in flesh and so the bride is the
[2:18:47] word in flesh brother is it's it's going
[2:18:51] beyond and when it comes to a message
[2:18:53] book and Eve it's going beyond even this
[2:18:56] book here called the Bible because now
[2:18:58] what's in there
[2:19:00] it may question them right what was in
[2:19:03] the Old Testament was made flesh in
[2:19:05] Jesus a man so what was in the New
[2:19:08] Testament is Christ in the right
[2:19:09] the word is made flesh because like I
[2:19:12] said the day is coming the hours coming
[2:19:14] we won't have no Bible we better have it
[2:19:16] in our hearts a man that that that be
[2:19:19] made flesh in you may be made flesh in
[2:19:22] me so that you become the word amen by
[2:19:26] the grace of God brother the Pharisees
[2:19:28] the scribes oh they they had the Old
[2:19:30] Testament and they had the law they had
[2:19:33] this they did this they did that oh like
[2:19:35] the rich man young rich man said he said
[2:19:37] I all this I've done from my youth up
[2:19:39] and the scribes the Pharisees did it did
[2:19:42] it did it a man as like Jesus said do
[2:19:45] what they say but don't know what they
[2:19:46] do a man because he jesus knew that it
[2:19:49] was the word a man but they they weren't
[2:19:52] doing it the way that God wanted them to
[2:19:54] do it amen by the grace of God brother
[2:19:58] it's a uniting time what God has done
[2:20:01] in the sign is pointing us to the
[2:20:04] Uniting of the bride and the bridegroom
[2:20:08] that's what we need to focus on and when
[2:20:11] we see all this groups united you there
[2:20:14] again don't focus on that turn from it
[2:20:17] and focus on the bride that dear lady
[2:20:20] that's just a sign to point you to this
[2:20:23] a man by the grace of God but there's
[2:20:26] too many still focusing on what's going
[2:20:28] on over there
[2:20:28] as I've said that time when that brother
[2:20:30] was in in our home from a certain church
[2:20:34] and I said brother I said the people in
[2:20:38] that church that you attend I said they
[2:20:41] know more about the Pope than to do
[2:20:43] about Jesus they do they know more more
[2:20:46] about politics and what's going on in
[2:20:48] the world over there and what's uniting
[2:20:50] over there then they do both the bride
[2:20:52] unity that is the absolute truth just a
[2:20:55] lot of believers they know about this
[2:20:56] doctrine to this doctrine that Darby's
[2:20:58] know what's going on out there what's
[2:20:59] going on out there but they they're
[2:21:01] totally ignorant of what's going on in
[2:21:04] the bride and the bridegroom that's
[2:21:07] right again that's when the father of
[2:21:09] God said you know there's gonna be so
[2:21:11] few that when she goes nobody's gonna
[2:21:15] know she's gone no but the right the
[2:21:20] true bride is conscious of the bright
[2:21:22] the true brightest conscious of the
[2:21:24] bridegroom a man she's on really
[2:21:27] thirsting for eternity I'm gonna
[2:21:29] thirsting for the kingdom of God she
[2:21:32] wants to get out of here she just not
[2:21:34] satisfy we just all I see this and I see
[2:21:36] that I know this is happening that's
[2:21:37] that no yeah but it's all going to go to
[2:21:40] hell it's all heading for the burning
[2:21:43] that's right so what it right out now
[2:21:46] we've seen enough we've heard enough
[2:21:48] now we want to go home yeah it's enough
[2:21:52] now lord thank you for what you've done
[2:21:54] NORs created the sign that I've seen you
[2:21:57] do in this hour for the bride Lord is
[2:22:00] creating in me a hunger and a thirst for
[2:22:02] eternity by the grace of God brother we
[2:22:08] see you know as politics is reuniting
[2:22:12] religion is uniting the different
[2:22:15] in moral groups of their they're uniting
[2:22:17] and they're getting legalized by the
[2:22:19] government's and so on now basically you
[2:22:21] can't hardly say anything against this
[2:22:23] or against a during its anything now
[2:22:25] they don't mind if you say engage if
[2:22:28] they say anything against us they don't
[2:22:30] mind that no no that shows that the
[2:22:33] devil is the god of this world he is
[2:22:35] he's in control so brother
[2:22:39] I pray grant grace that we're more
[2:22:41] caught up with the uniting of the bride
[2:22:43] and the bridegroom the earthly bride of
[2:22:46] the heavenly bridegroom than we are with
[2:22:48] what's going on in the world politically
[2:22:50] morally or in morally or religiously
[2:22:53] whatever god help us because they think
[2:22:56] in this world you got to respect
[2:22:57] everybody we do respect when it come to
[2:23:00] a human being but not necessarily what
[2:23:03] they're doing and what they're saying
[2:23:04] they're like brother Brown says
[2:23:06] concerning the woman dressed the way
[2:23:08] she's dressed shouldn't be dressed he
[2:23:10] said I can condemn the way she's dressed
[2:23:11] but I can't I won't condemn her no no
[2:23:14] but still you got to speak out against
[2:23:16] the way they dressed this where they do
[2:23:19] this what they do here and that oh yeah
[2:23:21] it's be good against those things but
[2:23:22] not they'll leave them with with the
[2:23:25] lawyers between them and God grace but
[2:23:30] I've seen him less and less pride
[2:23:32] recognizing the unit the United unity of
[2:23:37] the bride and the bridegroom grace to us
[2:23:40] he says again it's the uniting time of
[2:23:42] the bride the church is so coming
[2:23:44] together it should create such love
[2:23:47] among us that we could hardly be away
[2:23:50] from one another amazing he said you
[2:23:55] don't have to beg people to pray you
[2:23:57] don't have to beg them to worship God he
[2:24:00] said you don't have to beg him to do
[2:24:01] what's right he said they're just so in
[2:24:04] love with him he should tell that
[2:24:06] there's nothing else amen
[2:24:09] but he said there is one thing yet
[2:24:12] lagging in the church and he said we
[2:24:14] want to get that to that he said I'm
[2:24:17] right on the edge of it if you've got to
[2:24:19] do it if you don't do it he said that's
[2:24:22] just all you must do it for look the
[2:24:25] Uniting time is at hand and God is
[2:24:27] getting the church together
[2:24:29] easier to be raptured to go to the
[2:24:31] wedding supper for the great union when
[2:24:34] God a man will unite for eternity a man
[2:24:39] he said again this was 63 but in 1962 he
[2:24:43] said we're not going to to a wedding or
[2:24:46] marriage rather he said we're going to a
[2:24:48] marriage summer he were married here
[2:24:50] were united with Christ dear he'd been
[2:24:53] uniting with his bride all the way down
[2:24:55] through the ages amen - finally it's the
[2:24:57] conclusion the invisible union of the
[2:25:00] earthly bride and the ebony bridegroom
[2:25:02] amen till the bright is finished
[2:25:05] amen there's no more it may be no more
[2:25:08] bright amen then then we recognize the
[2:25:14] uniting time why because the sign the
[2:25:18] signs that we have seen which I will
[2:25:20] show you again sometime on video the
[2:25:23] signs that we have seen a man is a sign
[2:25:28] of the earthly bride and the heavenly
[2:25:31] bridegroom coming together the signs
[2:25:33] that we have seen what God has done in
[2:25:35] this hour
[2:25:35] a man restored all things planning
[2:25:40] binding the believers to to the bright
[2:25:42] to the bridegroom our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:25:44] the coming of the Lord see the Bible
[2:25:46] says always to come in the Lord the
[2:25:47] coming of the Lord and all we're waiting
[2:25:49] on the coming Lord yeah but he's waiting
[2:25:51] on you no no waiting for the coming of
[2:25:56] the Lord
[2:25:58] what do you wait for someone has already
[2:26:00] come see they're waitin waitin on the
[2:26:04] messiah 2,000 years ago but he was
[2:26:06] already there and they didn't recognize
[2:26:08] it they did to him what they what they
[2:26:11] were prophesied to do they crucified Him
[2:26:13] a man but now they crucify him again
[2:26:16] because he's here with his bride and may
[2:26:19] flesh in his bright and brother he has
[2:26:21] declared himself he's revealed himself
[2:26:23] Malachi 4 you know through that Ministry
[2:26:27] of Malachi 4 he was revealed 2,000 years
[2:26:30] ago through the ministry of Malachi 4 he
[2:26:32] was revealed to the father's and now
[2:26:34] he's revealed to the children amen
[2:26:37] to turn us back to our Pentecostal
[2:26:39] fathers and the revelation that they had
[2:26:41] 2000
[2:26:41] years ago a man they weren't
[2:26:43] denomination no no they were experienced
[2:26:47] with with with Christ's grace grace
[2:26:51] grace brother god help us
[2:26:54] no and as he he just hinted at it here
[2:26:59] the hour is coming when you take a stand
[2:27:01] for this take a stand for that ever you
[2:27:02] glued one time you say if you pray for
[2:27:04] the people pray for somebody you still
[2:27:06] kill you they'll shoot you and they will
[2:27:13] grace brother those foolish virgins
[2:27:16] they're gonna lay down their lives it's
[2:27:18] gonna be a number that no man could
[2:27:20] number is gonna kill kill during the
[2:27:22] Great Tribulation but I pray grace that
[2:27:24] we're going to come to it but before
[2:27:26] we're killed they're going to eat you
[2:27:28] wanna take us off in a rapture yeah by
[2:27:31] the grace of God there's like I said
[2:27:33] it's a revelation to there whereas
[2:27:35] there's coming a tremendous thing upon
[2:27:38] the earth gonna test and bring out the
[2:27:41] true believers true whether you the
[2:27:42] foolish virgins grace to grace raised
[2:27:46] grace that were numbered with the few
[2:27:52] amen and he said What did he say in
[2:27:55] Malachi 4 that he would restore he's
[2:28:00] restoring back the word not just emotion
[2:28:03] or since the signs and wonders but the
[2:28:05] word amen again he see the church as
[2:28:12] received a heavenly sign astronaut a man
[2:28:17] Jesus Christ in the form of the pillar
[2:28:19] of fire and he said he was in the Old
[2:28:22] Testament then he was then he meant Saul
[2:28:25] on the road down to Damascus the same
[2:28:27] Jesus is here today and he said what
[2:28:30] does it do does it bring fear it brings
[2:28:32] love he said that's uniting one another
[2:28:36] a man a feeling for one another
[2:28:39] it brings love of God and uniting us and
[2:28:42] brings us as the body of Christ into a
[2:28:45] unity as the bride and he said that's
[2:28:47] what it's doing now this great union of
[2:28:50] God grace
[2:28:54] what an hour living there's more he said
[2:29:04] God is uniting his right she's coming

[2:29:16] uniting then I must are we to be united
[2:29:18] now grace and he said what she uniting
[2:29:26] for she's not uniting for the rapture

[2:29:41] your readiness for the right for the
[2:29:43] rapture if you're not one with one
