[36:13] newfoundland oh yes when it comes to the
[36:16] the old-fashioned method is the
[36:17] old-fashioned salvation army and the
[36:19] old-fashioned pentecostals oh yeah ended
[36:22] up here in newfoundland or started a new
[36:23] plan somewhere
[36:25] amen started somewhere else came newflin
[36:27] went somewhere else so i thank the lord
[36:29] for that hallelujah and of course also
[36:34] i have had an email
[36:36] a while ago where that
[36:38] brethren were asking me if brother
[36:40] branham the problem of god was in nova
[36:43] scotia or was he in prince of wood
[36:45] island or not the rest of london but uh
[36:47] new brunswick
[36:48] and because they were just wondering if
[36:50] there was something that they could get
[36:52] or maybe something that was recorded
[36:53] there and i said no as far as i know he
[36:56] wasn't in new brunswick he wasn't in
[36:59] nova scotia unless maybe a flight had
[37:02] landed there just
[37:03] just go pass over it
[37:06] but i said he did stop in newfoundland
[37:07] that was in gander
[37:09] and i was in the early 1950s and they
[37:12] had to stop here because the plane ran
[37:14] out of fuel
[37:15] and the problem of god said he to the to
[37:18] the ones that were on the plane
[37:20] and i guess some were complaining
[37:22] and he said don't complain because they
[37:24] were going from europe or asia to
[37:27] supposed to go on to new york city
[37:28] somewhere he said don't complain
[37:31] he said if it wasn't for the lord he
[37:32] said we'd be out there in the in the
[37:34] ocean
[37:35] amen because he said we've been going a
[37:37] half hour he said with an empty tank
[37:40] amen that's the truth so so they landed
[37:42] in gander to get more fuel and the
[37:45] problem of god of course did
[37:47] get off the plane as well and go into
[37:49] the airport in gander and as i said i
[37:51] was at the time i was just a young boy
[37:55] maybe maybe five years old
[37:57] living
[37:58] 25 miles east of gander that's where i
[38:01] was born and raised
[38:03] so i i trust that
[38:06] that the presence of a prophet that
[38:07] through through the presence of a
[38:09] prophet lord that the that the lord
[38:11] blessed us by grace amen so we thank the
[38:14] lord of course again the way that i was
[38:16] raised and then i think the lord
[38:18] ordained it predestinated it and i was
[38:20] raised as an old-fashioned salvation
[38:22] army person going to the salvation army
[38:25] sunday morning sunday afternoon for
[38:27] sunday school sunday night for the
[38:29] evening service oh yeah then they had
[38:31] two two more services during the week uh
[38:35] maybe one was called a soldiers meeting
[38:37] where they get together and sing and
[38:39] praise and
[38:40] just christians just the believers
[38:42] so and i thank god for that influence in
[38:45] my life
[38:46] amen and god ordained it no doubt
[38:50] so thank the lord so lord bless us
[38:53] and uh we welcome again of course our
[38:55] brother ellie back with us again so the
[38:57] lord bless you brother it's good to have
[38:58] you
[38:59] amen and of course his brother joshua
[39:02] amen and joshua's here usually most
[39:05] every service our brother joshua's here
[39:07] and we trust we'll see more and more of
[39:09] brother ali amen
[39:12] and of course his family being in
[39:14] central they do come
[39:17] here
[39:18] once in a while and visit us and worship
[39:20] with us
[39:21] so the lord blessed them
[39:23] so just to ask you to keep all the
[39:25] saints of god in prayer
[39:27] and
[39:29] air and across the island and to
[39:31] remember our brother jonathan in prayer
[39:33] and just to let you know again that he
[39:35] will be an assistant pastor and he will
[39:38] be there to of course
[39:40] to help the pastor and with the
[39:42] authority to do you know what what
[39:44] sometimes what the pastor does he can do
[39:47] it now
[39:48] amen because we have also registered him
[39:50] with the government amen as a clergy
[39:53] heir in disassembly by the grace of god
[39:56] so god bless again as i said brother
[39:58] johnson was under the ministry here for
[40:01] i guess maybe 20 years
[40:03] and he was married here and uh
[40:05] our sister salinas
[40:08] yeah that was their first child and i
[40:10] dedicated her
[40:12] that's many many many years ago amen so
[40:16] oh yeah don't mean to emphasize
[40:19] that she's getting older
[40:20] amen
[40:22] yeah
[40:23] but again like i said it's hard for me
[40:24] to believe that i came here and
[40:26] ministered some years ago
[40:28] and some of these brethren here that are
[40:30] white here they they weren't even
[40:32] married then
[40:33] and but then they ended up with children
[40:35] and i dedicated that was those children
[40:38] and now i'm dedicating their
[40:39] grandchildren
[40:40] so it's amazing it's hard for me to
[40:42] believe that i'm i'm an old man
[40:44] amen but again we thank the lord that he
[40:47] he said a few other three score years
[40:49] and ten a few more if by reason of
[40:51] strength
[40:52] amen and they shall be filled as you
[40:54] have pain and sorrow
[40:56] so we're praying god by grace of our
[40:59] lord jesus christ to take us through it
[41:01] amen
[41:02] so the lord blesses
[41:04] and again god bless our sister delphine
[41:06] and sister ellen amen glad to have you
[41:09] there and again uh
[41:11] all the saints of god that have come for
[41:13] the hearing of the word i pray that that
[41:16] you're praying for brother jonathan
[41:18] and praying by grace amen that you will
[41:21] have the the right spirit and the right
[41:23] attitude to receive the word
[41:25] amen to receive what god is going to
[41:28] going to minister for you
[41:30] as an individual oh yeah oh we think
[41:33] he's going to minister just preach to
[41:34] all of us and what all he says is for
[41:36] all of us well there might be something
[41:38] that god will god will anoint him to say
[41:41] amen that'll be for individuals there so
[41:43] let's keep the right attitude and the
[41:45] right spirit
[41:47] and be in prayer again for those across
[41:49] the island
[41:50] and also uh it's been
[41:53] especially since the covet issues
[41:55] has been going on it's been very rare
[41:57] that we've had communion
[41:59] so let's be in prayer because it's been
[42:00] on my heart for a while
[42:02] to have communion again
[42:04] and of course because people didn't want
[42:06] to drink out of the same glass
[42:08] and i'm not sure but maybe last time we
[42:10] we used the small cups here and so we'll
[42:13] see as the lord leads us to have
[42:15] communion and for washing again by grace
[42:18] so the lord bless us
[42:20] amen and keep please i pray in the name
[42:22] of jesus stay sincere
[42:24] we're in the last days
[42:26] and we need to be on our guard because
[42:29] jesus warned us when the son of man
[42:31] comes will he find faith
[42:34] on the earth it's going to be that bad
[42:37] when it comes to just religion not being
[42:40] spiritual religious yes
[42:42] and
[42:43] and just unbelievers and so on but when
[42:45] it comes to absolute true christian
[42:47] believers they're going to get less and
[42:50] less and less amen they said will he
[42:53] find faith
[42:55] and we know faith is the revelation of
[42:57] the word of god
[42:58] in your heart amen what god wants you to
[43:02] have what god wants you to see what god
[43:04] wants you to believe in these last days
[43:08] as we said the the brother of god from
[43:11] it began with faith and the foundation
[43:13] is faith amen with with the with with
[43:15] paul that comes right on up through
[43:17] iranians martin columba luther wesley
[43:19] elijah in these last days what was god
[43:22] doing god giving him the message
[43:24] of the word that would give them the
[43:26] faith that they needed
[43:27] amen they needed the faith of
[43:29] justification they needed the faith of
[43:31] sanctification through luther wesley and
[43:35] of course in pentecost the baptism of
[43:36] the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit
[43:39] but brother see more and more of god
[43:42] in in in the body more and more of god
[43:45] in the bride and as i said god many are
[43:48] called
[43:49] but they're not all lost
[43:50] but few are chosen for the bride and i
[43:53] trust we are the bride by the grace of
[43:55] god
[43:57] so brother and
[43:58] god gave them their faith for
[44:00] justification sanctification and the
[44:02] pentecostals the baptism of the holy
[44:04] ghost the gifts of the spirit but he's
[44:06] given us a message of the word to give
[44:08] us the faith for the resurrection
[44:10] and the rapture
[44:12] to get out of here by the grace of god
[44:15] so the lord bless us let's be be there
[44:17] to receive the word and that is going to
[44:19] give us more and more faith for the
[44:21] rapture faith for the resurrection faith
[44:24] to look up
[44:25] amen
[44:26] by the grace of god
[44:28] because he said he warned us when you
[44:29] see this this and this and this look up
[44:32] amen why because it's signs of the end
[44:36] grace to us amen so be in prayer for one
[44:38] another by the grace of god so we're
[44:40] going to turn to our brother jonathan
[44:42] and let's stand and we're going to sing
[44:44] all things are possible only believe
[44:47] amen

[47:30] an ideology lord but that it would be
[47:33] life and life abundant within each one
[47:35] of us lord life so abundant lord that
[47:37] when we go around others would see it
[47:39] and be able to take it and taste it and
[47:41] benefit from it lord that they will be

[47:44] word that they see in every one of our

[48:17] amen amen thank you musicians that'll be

[48:21] ephesians chapter 4 this morning
[48:24] amen good to have our visitors amongst
[48:26] us
[48:26] amen good to have each one that's here i
[48:28] want to pass on greetings of course
[48:30] uh we traveled out to central and then
[48:32] to the west coast and so we stayed with
[48:35] brother albert and sister freda snow and
[48:37] we'd never met them before as far as i
[48:38] know
[48:39] as in i wasn't old enough to really
[48:41] remember that so we stayed with them
[48:42] they put us up for three different
[48:44] nights complete strangers so praise the
[48:46] lord for that we enjoyed our time and
[48:47] fellowship with them
[48:49] we also got to spend about five hours
[48:51] with brother hank and sister verna and
[48:53] uh we spent about the same amount of
[48:55] time brother gordon's sister eileen and
[48:57] we went out to the west coast and spent
[48:59] uh part of two evenings with brother dog
[49:01] and sister beverly had a good time with
[49:03] them and then joe was able to spend some
[49:05] time with brother and sister colombo and
[49:07] brother ivan as well so each one passed
[49:09] on their greetings their thanks to the
[49:10] church um you know expressed their hope
[49:13] to come in if we have some special
[49:14] meetings sometime soon so
[49:16] definitely remember them in prayer it's
[49:17] a sticky situation out there it's a
[49:19] tough thing being out there more or less
[49:21] alone a lot of them and uh certainly put
[49:23] a burden on my heart to remember them
[49:25] and and the different things that are
[49:27] going on out there amen i mean i just
[49:29] had a testimony this morning you can
[49:31] take your seats if you will
[49:32] just a brief testimony before we uh set
[49:35] out on our trip i uh i bought a new set
[49:37] of tires for the van because we were
[49:38] running on our old winters and they were
[49:40] getting really noisy i didn't want to do
[49:42] a couple thousand kilometers on them so
[49:43] i had them change it over and uh when i
[49:46] did my wife drove the van back and she
[49:48] says there's a sound coming from the
[49:50] front right corner and we kind of heard
[49:52] it before but you know just figured it
[49:54] was the old tires well it was worse with
[49:56] the new tires and so we knew there was a
[49:58] problem so um i know what a bad bearing
[50:01] sounds like and we had a bad bearing on
[50:02] the front right corner as best i could
[50:04] tell and it sounded like we had a small
[50:05] cessna flying next to our van on a
[50:08] regular basis and brother matt knows
[50:10] what a bad bearing sounds like it sounds
[50:11] kind of low and and grumbly a bit and
[50:13] then the worse it gets then it gets a
[50:15] high-pitched wine and these different
[50:16] things and so we were driving we'd come
[50:18] down into manuals and i mean just this
[50:20] one
[50:21] you know just in the in the right corner
[50:22] and i said well we can't fix it we don't
[50:24] have time to fix it you know it was
[50:26] we're leaving we're leaving over the
[50:27] weekend none of the shops are open over
[50:29] the weekend it's not something you
[50:30] change out in just an hour type thing so
[50:32] so i said well we're just going to pray
[50:34] that the lord will keep it until we get
[50:35] back 2000 kilometers on a bad bearing
[50:37] it's not the best idea but it was just
[50:39] kind of making the noises you know so i
[50:40] figured we'd be okay
[50:42] so we drove off and and it was pretty
[50:44] loud for the first little bit and and it
[50:46] got loud and it was staying there and i
[50:48] was just you know turn the music up a
[50:49] little louder and say lord we're
[50:51] trusting you type thing and it was funny
[50:53] we were in uh in bishops falls and we
[50:55] were having some fellowship there with
[50:56] brother gord and sister eileen and and
[50:58] uh and they were talking about you know
[51:00] how brother branham had prayed for a
[51:01] brother's car he had an old studebaker
[51:03] and he had an issue with him brother
[51:04] brown got out and he prayed for it he
[51:05] said brother don't worry about it it's
[51:07] taken care of that brother never had an
[51:09] issue with that with that car in that
[51:10] area again you know so so i told him
[51:12] about the wheel bearing i said i i guess
[51:14] i didn't quite pray the right way i said
[51:16] i just asked for him to take take it all
[51:18] the way back home so i could get it
[51:19] fixed there you know so anyways we're
[51:21] coming in to manuals and and we're
[51:23] coming down the hill and right at that
[51:25] 80 kilometer an hour speed is where that
[51:27] that bearing was really loud and my wife
[51:29] said
[51:30] does it
[51:31] does it sound quieter
[51:34] and i said it does i said it you know
[51:36] i'm not really sure so i i set up an
[51:39] appointment i already set up an
[51:40] appointment on tuesday for for to take
[51:42] it to the shop and and so i called i
[51:44] hadn't heard anything from them all day
[51:46] on tuesday and i'd driven around the
[51:47] previous day trying to get this noise
[51:49] and just trying to make sure you know
[51:50] it's still there
[51:52] but it was a rainy day it was a windy
[51:53] day and you know you just can't can't
[51:55] pin it down you know so i said well it
[51:57] was definitely there you know i had a
[51:59] bad bearing on my acura i know what it
[52:00] sounds like it was definitely there
[52:02] it's you know whatever maybe it's in a
[52:04] perfect storm right there and it's going
[52:05] to fall apart tomorrow type thing so
[52:07] that's what's going on anyways the so i
[52:09] called him i said you know it's john i
[52:11] dropped my van off have you fixed the
[52:12] bearing he says i've taken that van out
[52:14] three times he says and i can't hear
[52:15] anything he says all i can hear is just
[52:17] a little bit of tire noise he said
[52:18] there's no problem with your bearings so
[52:21] so i prayed for him to take care of it
[52:22] to bring it back and as far as i can
[52:24] tell he healed the bearing so brother
[52:26] matt i'll tell you when a bearing goes
[52:28] bad it doesn't come back there's no such
[52:30] thing so that's what i'm going to
[52:31] testify to i'm going to say the wheel
[52:33] bearing's fixed the fan's only got 50
[52:34] 000 kilometers it shouldn't have bad
[52:35] bearings at this point but it was
[52:37] definitely bad it was very annoying and
[52:39] anyways it's not anymore so i say praise
[52:41] the lord amen he can heal our bodies he
[52:43] can heal our vans he can feel our homes
[52:45] he can do all sorts of things for us if
[52:47] we ask him and then all right amen if
[52:49] you'll just stand together and we'll
[52:50] we'll read in ephesians 4. sister amber
[52:52] certainly enjoyed your special always
[52:54] enjoy it every time i've noticed that uh
[52:56] we've had a few more specials of late
[52:58] and you know as different ones get more
[53:00] time and babies grow up older and you
[53:02] know it gives you a little more time to
[53:03] do these things it's really wonderful
[53:05] and i know the church is blessed by it
[53:07] amen
[53:08] amen ephesians 4 sorry for the late
[53:09] start ephesians 4 13 says till we all
[53:13] come in the unity of the faith and of
[53:14] the knowledge of the son of god unto a
[53:16] perfect man unto the stat measure of the
[53:19] stature of the fullness of christ that
[53:21] we henceforth be no more children tossed
[53:23] to and fro and carried about with every
[53:25] wind of doctrine by the slate of men and
[53:28] cunning craftiness whereby they lay and
[53:30] wait to deceive but speaking the truth
[53:33] in love may grow up into him in all
[53:36] things which is the head even christ
[53:39] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[53:41] together and compacted by that which
[53:43] every joint supplyeth according to the
[53:46] effectual working in the measure of
[53:48] every part maketh increase of the body
[53:51] unto the edifying of itself in love amen
[53:55] god that is blessing to the reading of
[53:57] his word you may be seated
[53:58] and then we're going to continue our
[53:59] series as you might have guessed on the
[54:01] overcomers and uh last time we spoke on
[54:04] gracious gifts if you remember and we
[54:06] spoke on the five-fold ministry and the
[54:07] placing of them and the purpose of them
[54:09] and what a what a real one looks like
[54:11] and the effect it has on the people
[54:13] amen and now we want to we want to move
[54:15] into our part of this you know in terms
[54:17] of not just the the fivefold ministry
[54:19] but the laity itself and and these
[54:21] different things so today i want to take
[54:22] a title of growing into effectiveness
[54:25] and and this is pre-gifts this is not
[54:27] about gifts this is getting to the place
[54:28] where god can use your gift amen but we
[54:30] want to grow into the place where we are
[54:32] effective in the kingdom of god amen so
[54:34] let's start right back in verse 13 and
[54:37] this is you remember from the last
[54:38] service maybe if you don't is the long
[54:41] term this is the end effect of the
[54:43] fivefold ministry and it says and it
[54:46] says that he gave prophets and apostles
[54:48] and these different things
[54:50] until we all come we all come
[54:53] right not just one or two but every
[54:55] single one of the members of the bride
[54:57] of christ comes in the unity of the
[54:58] faith and of the knowledge of the son of
[55:01] god unto a perfect man and unto the
[55:04] measure of the stature of the fullness
[55:06] of christ now let me stop there and say
[55:08] this you can't do this on your own i
[55:10] mean this is not something that the
[55:12] bride can make happen amen this is where
[55:14] eve got into trouble was god said be
[55:16] fruitful and multiply and eve sat there
[55:19] and said god's word said that i'm
[55:20] supposed to be fruitful and multiply and
[55:22] she didn't know how to do it and so what
[55:25] happened was satan came in and he
[55:26] pointed you to the word and he says you
[55:28] don't have a clue how to do it but guess
[55:30] what i know how to do it i'm going to
[55:32] show you how you can bring the word of
[55:34] god to pass in your life and it over
[55:36] time what did he do he seduced her by
[55:38] what pointing her to the word and her
[55:40] inability to bring it to the effect that
[55:42] god said it would have and he said let
[55:44] me help you get there amen we cannot
[55:46] make a rapture happen on our own and if
[55:48] you try and do it you're going to get
[55:50] messed up and you're going to mess up
[55:51] those that are around you amen but eve
[55:53] sat there and over time he seduced her
[55:55] into this idea that she could make it
[55:57] happen on her own and what happened was
[55:59] she brought
[56:00] ruin and destruction to the entire world
[56:02] amen
[56:03] what happened she said god told me to do
[56:04] it and then she took his thought and
[56:06] injected it into her and all of a sudden
[56:09] she's she's brought destruction on all
[56:11] of us amen
[56:12] this is not something that we can do
[56:14] amen we've got to stop striving
[56:17] and we've got to start surrendering amen
[56:18] we've got to be able to get quiet we've
[56:20] got to be able to get still we've got to
[56:22] be able to say lord what would you have
[56:23] for me to do as opposed to i'm going to
[56:25] go out and i see this and this and this
[56:27] and i'm just going to do it do it do it
[56:28] do it do it and all of a sudden it's
[56:29] going to work out amen that is not what
[56:31] we're here to do as mature sons and
[56:33] daughters of god we're here to be led
[56:35] not here to drive the bus if i can put
[56:37] it that way amen i read this quote in
[56:39] the last service but i believe it sets
[56:40] the tone where we're going for the next
[56:42] couple of services so i wanted to read
[56:43] it again
[56:44] and it says this now god said i sent
[56:46] them the word and eve just walked right
[56:48] over the top of it and disbelieved it i
[56:50] made it manifest and crucified it in
[56:52] christ i'm just getting tired he says
[56:55] i'm coming myself so here he come god in
[56:58] you from god above us the pillar of fire
[57:00] god with us in jesus christ now god in
[57:03] us the holy spirit what is it he says
[57:05] the same word the same god amen no more
[57:09] trusting in anything else god come
[57:11] himself this was a man-sized job so he
[57:13] brought it on down and he came down
[57:15] himself he says now they won't have to
[57:18] do nothing about it
[57:20] to do what achieve the purpose and plan
[57:22] of god to be restored back to their
[57:23] eating condition he says they won't have
[57:25] to do nothing about it just let them
[57:27] surrender to me and i'll walk in them
[57:31] i'll talk in them i'll speak in them and
[57:34] i'll work in them oh my that's it i'll
[57:36] do the work just let them humble
[57:39] themselves just let them empty up i'll
[57:42] beat my enemy out there through them
[57:44] that's it you can't do it yourself now
[57:47] you're not a match for him you're not a
[57:48] match for the enemy you're not a match
[57:50] for satan you're not a match for the
[57:51] world if you try and do it on your own
[57:53] but if you'll just let god do it get the
[57:56] word in you then it'll all be taken care
[57:59] of amen they won't have anything to do
[58:01] with it when we stand on the other side
[58:03] in glory it will not be because of
[58:05] anything that i did it will not because
[58:07] of anything you did but it will be the
[58:08] elect grace of god that took us and
[58:11] brought us through all of these things
[58:12] and gave us what we have need of to
[58:14] overcome in the time and season and age
[58:16] that we are in amen let me put it this
[58:18] way we can only hinder god with what we
[58:22] have
[58:22] you cannot help god with what you have
[58:24] you can only hinder god with what you
[58:26] have because what you have is cursed
[58:29] amen it's been cursed since satan caused
[58:32] the fall with eve and until we go back
[58:34] into a rapture everything that we have
[58:36] is cursed that is in our bodies amen the
[58:39] only thing that we take is our soul and
[58:41] brother brown says the only thing you
[58:42] take is what your character because your
[58:44] character is the holy spirit that has
[58:46] been placed inside of you that sealed
[58:48] you to the day of your redemption so all
[58:50] that goes is your soul your body stays
[58:52] here your thoughts stays here your
[58:53] spirit your general spirit your attitude
[58:56] your memories all these things they stay
[58:57] here because they're cursed but yet
[58:59] that's the only thing we can add to god
[59:01] and let me put it this way he thinks so
[59:03] little of it that he leaves it behind
[59:05] when he takes us so we can only hinder
[59:07] him with what we have to offer but what
[59:09] we can bring to him is what a
[59:10] surrendered heart a surrendered soul is
[59:12] surrendered life and then he can work
[59:14] through that to do something for the
[59:16] kingdom of god amen he can help you
[59:18] through you but it's not going to use
[59:20] you it's going to be the holy spirit
[59:21] within you surrender to the word that he
[59:23] is bringing to the age amen
[59:26] paul says it this way he says that we
[59:28] henceforth be no more children toss to
[59:31] and fro amen in other words we're going
[59:33] to be mature and we're not going to be
[59:35] moved around by the things that are
[59:36] happening that are changing around us
[59:38] amen society is changing religion's
[59:40] changing politics are changing the
[59:42] financial system is changing the way
[59:44] they raise kids is changing who works
[59:45] and who doesn't work is changing
[59:47] everything in the world is changing but
[59:49] he says we will be anchored in these
[59:51] times amen we won't be moved to and fro
[59:54] based on situations
[59:56] based on circumstances
[59:58] amen nor will we be carried about by
[1:00:00] every wind of doctrine or by the slate
[1:00:02] of men amen so we're going to have
[1:00:04] discernment that's based on the word and
[1:00:06] we won't be moved around by the latest
[1:00:07] and greatest ideas remember we'll take
[1:00:09] it from genesis to revelation through
[1:00:11] the word to make sure that it lines up
[1:00:13] before we step out and start resting our
[1:00:15] souls on such a thing amen sometimes
[1:00:17] it's difficult for us because something
[1:00:18] new comes across the pulp and we say
[1:00:20] i've never heard that before that's
[1:00:22] probably wrong
[1:00:23] it's not true because what god is ever
[1:00:25] opening and revealing his word to us
[1:00:27] he's drawing us to a higher plane so
[1:00:29] there are going to be things come over
[1:00:30] the pulpit at times that you've never
[1:00:32] heard before but the holy spirit within
[1:00:34] you will cause you to draw it from
[1:00:35] genesis to revelation to say does that
[1:00:37] line up with the word of god and if it
[1:00:39] does you should be able to say yea and
[1:00:41] amen to it and add it to your life and
[1:00:43] it will draw you to a higher level in
[1:00:44] your walk in christ amen
[1:00:46] amen so no more by the slate of men so
[1:00:48] will we not we will not be influenced by
[1:00:51] charisma by gifts
[1:00:53] amen but we will be holding fast to what
[1:00:55] the simplicity of the word of god and
[1:00:57] cunning craftiness whereby they lay in
[1:00:59] wait to deceive so will not be tricked
[1:01:01] as eve was
[1:01:02] amen the bride will stand all the way
[1:01:04] through she'll stand the test of the age
[1:01:06] and she'll take a rapture because of it
[1:01:09] but rather speaking the truth and love
[1:01:11] we may grow up into him amen so there's
[1:01:13] a growing up process there's a maturing
[1:01:15] process and a development in this
[1:01:17] process we do not start as mature but we
[1:01:20] finish as mature amen that's something
[1:01:22] to remember when you're failing when
[1:01:23] you're struggling when you're dealing
[1:01:24] with things is that you do not get the
[1:01:26] holy ghost and automatically become an
[1:01:28] adult amen you are still a child a babe
[1:01:31] in christ paul talks about it in the
[1:01:33] different ones he says i tried i want to
[1:01:35] teach you big things i want to take you
[1:01:36] to a higher level but you're still
[1:01:37] babies
[1:01:39] what babies in christ but still babies
[1:01:41] nonetheless you've got to mature before
[1:01:43] we can start getting into certain things
[1:01:45] brother branham dealt with it you know
[1:01:46] they said brother branham how when are
[1:01:48] you going to get into the greater things
[1:01:49] he says well how can i teach pentecostal
[1:01:51] babies supernatural things what you
[1:01:53] don't have the a b's and c's done and
[1:01:55] you want to do algebra it's not going to
[1:01:56] happen amen amen but rather for us now
[1:01:59] we are speaking the truth in love we may
[1:02:01] grow up into him in all things in all
[1:02:04] things that's the end the end goal here
[1:02:06] is that in all things we are in christ
[1:02:08] amen that is surrendered to christ that
[1:02:10] it matches the standard of christ which
[1:02:12] is the word amen
[1:02:14] paul's saying there's a maturing process
[1:02:16] and you've got to be able to go through
[1:02:17] that process before you can get to the
[1:02:19] end result which is a stature of a
[1:02:21] perfect man in christ this is a maturing
[1:02:23] process as brother joe pointed out it
[1:02:24] always starts with faith faith in the
[1:02:26] finished work of calvary and then it
[1:02:28] moves all the way up to there to love
[1:02:29] which is what the holy spirit itself
[1:02:31] [Applause]
[1:02:32] amen especially within the message where
[1:02:35] we have a restored word where we have an
[1:02:36] open word where we have the fullness of
[1:02:38] the truth we believe amen it's easy to
[1:02:40] say i'm mature because i understand the
[1:02:42] word of god
[1:02:43] amen and that's what you'll run into
[1:02:44] time and time again you'll have people
[1:02:45] say well i know what this means i know
[1:02:47] what the seven seals i know serpent seed
[1:02:48] i know godhead i know that the death to
[1:02:50] death i'm a mature believer
[1:02:53] but that couldn't be further from the
[1:02:54] truth
[1:02:55] and then if you look at the pharisees
[1:02:56] they knew everything the sadducees knew
[1:02:58] everything but yet they weren't mature
[1:03:00] were they because when the word stood in
[1:03:01] front of them they missed it
[1:03:03] this is what paul had to say about this
[1:03:05] he says in first corinthians 13 2 it
[1:03:06] says and though i have the gift of
[1:03:08] prophecy he did
[1:03:10] and understand all mysteries he did
[1:03:13] and all knowledge which he had as was
[1:03:16] needed at least and though i have all
[1:03:18] faith so that i could remove mountains
[1:03:21] and have not charity i am nothing
[1:03:25] so you can know it all have it all be it
[1:03:26] all but without charity which is love
[1:03:29] which is the holy spirit you're nothing
[1:03:31] that's what paul says you can study it
[1:03:33] all your life you can be around it all
[1:03:34] your life you can have all the words all
[1:03:36] the head knowledge you want but until
[1:03:37] you have charity which is god's love you
[1:03:39] are nothing amen
[1:03:41] amen that's what he's talking about with
[1:03:42] charity is god's love that's not human
[1:03:44] love that's god's love amen it's a love
[1:03:46] that goes far beyond what we could ever
[1:03:48] do whatever we could imagine or think
[1:03:51] but the problem is we run it through a
[1:03:52] filter of our human love and so when
[1:03:54] god's love is moving we don't recognize
[1:03:56] it as god's love there's one one great
[1:03:58] thing that i learned through brother
[1:04:00] eugene brown and he said this he said
[1:04:01] god's love is based on spiritual growth
[1:04:04] what that means is that god's love will
[1:04:06] act in a way that causes you to grow
[1:04:08] spiritually it is not in a way that
[1:04:09] causes you to grow financially it is not
[1:04:11] in a way that causes you to grow big
[1:04:13] muscles or become beautiful to look at
[1:04:15] or have a successful career that is not
[1:04:16] what god cares about god doesn't give a
[1:04:18] flip about those things what god cares
[1:04:20] about is are you being restored into the
[1:04:22] image that he had of you before the
[1:04:24] foundation of the world and so what he's
[1:04:26] going to do is he's going to cause you
[1:04:27] to grow spiritually and if that means
[1:04:29] bankrupting you he'll do it if that
[1:04:31] means laying you flat on the bed in a
[1:04:33] hospital he'll do it amen but if you
[1:04:35] will obey the word then often you can go
[1:04:37] through it a lot easier amen but he's
[1:04:39] looking to love you in a way that causes
[1:04:40] you to grow spiritually so that what you
[1:04:42] can be restored to your eating condition
[1:04:44] which is what fellowship dominion and
[1:04:46] eternal life
[1:04:47] that's what he's looking for he's not
[1:04:48] looking to give us wealth here he's got
[1:04:50] he's got a cattle on a thousand hills
[1:04:52] he's got a city waiting for us he's got
[1:04:54] a new heaven and a new earth this is so
[1:04:56] temporal in the eyes of god that it's
[1:04:58] not even worth focusing on he's trying
[1:05:00] to get us out of here so that we can
[1:05:01] enjoy the richness of the blessings that
[1:05:03] will come with being in him amen
[1:05:05] so god's love will cause you to grow
[1:05:07] spiritually not currently and so god's
[1:05:09] love in action often looks quite
[1:05:10] different than what we might expect amen
[1:05:13] remember what brother brahm said about
[1:05:14] the holocaust he said that was the
[1:05:16] tender hand of jehovah moving them back
[1:05:18] to israel i saw something the other
[1:05:21] yesterday or the day before and it was
[1:05:23] it was uh
[1:05:24] two jews and one was a a high rabbi and
[1:05:26] one was a converted christian that that
[1:05:29] that used to be jewish and they were
[1:05:30] talking about the oral tradition the
[1:05:32] oral torah so in jewish uh if what they
[1:05:36] believe is they have the original torah
[1:05:38] which is the books of moses and then
[1:05:40] they have an oral torah which was passed
[1:05:42] down only orally it is never written and
[1:05:44] so you cannot study it you have to learn
[1:05:46] it by by memory and he was taught you
[1:05:49] know they were debating whether this
[1:05:50] oral torah was right or wrong or or
[1:05:52] whether it was of god and whether it
[1:05:54] could be relied on and and the converted
[1:05:56] christian was going through and pointing
[1:05:57] out all the things that were literally
[1:05:58] wrong with it that disagree with
[1:05:59] scripture that with the given law and
[1:06:01] these different things he says how can
[1:06:02] this be of god if it has error inside of
[1:06:04] it you know
[1:06:05] but um
[1:06:07] the the the i gave credit to the rabbi
[1:06:09] that was responding he said you know god
[1:06:11] works in ways that we don't understand
[1:06:13] sometimes and he says we saw the the the
[1:06:16] prophecy that was not only in the
[1:06:17] written torah but he says it was in the
[1:06:19] oral torah that would call the jews back
[1:06:21] to israel he says and that's what the
[1:06:22] holocaust did he recognized that that
[1:06:24] was a fulfillment of prophecy it was not
[1:06:27] just that they were being persecuted but
[1:06:28] they were being persecuted with purpose
[1:06:30] and that was to restore them to the
[1:06:31] place of promise where they could meet
[1:06:33] their messiah amen i thought that was
[1:06:35] pretty insightful he was completely
[1:06:36] blind and everything else
[1:06:38] to be frank when it comes to the reality
[1:06:40] of the word and christ in these
[1:06:42] different things as you'd expect from a
[1:06:43] rabbi but he recognized that the
[1:06:45] fulfillment of that prophecy looked a
[1:06:46] lot like anything but love but yet he
[1:06:49] says that was a fulfillment of prophecy
[1:06:50] to bring us back to the land of israel
[1:06:52] amen
[1:06:53] amen god's love and action looks quite
[1:06:55] different from how we think it ought to
[1:06:56] look
[1:06:57] brother brown puts it this way he says
[1:06:59] so get christ in your heart christ in
[1:07:01] the holy spirit is the same thing the
[1:07:02] holy spirit christ means the anointed
[1:07:05] one and the holy spirit is that
[1:07:07] anointing and you are the one that's
[1:07:08] anointed
[1:07:10] amen
[1:07:11] what does christ mean anointed one and
[1:07:13] then he says you are that anointed one
[1:07:16] amen you are little christ
[1:07:18] amen if you have the life of god inside
[1:07:20] of you in portion you are a little
[1:07:22] christ you are a little anointed one
[1:07:24] that's what he's saying and it's christ
[1:07:26] in you anointing you he said see what i
[1:07:27] mean
[1:07:28] then you've got the right thing
[1:07:30] remember paul was saying prophecy
[1:07:32] mysteries knowledge have all faith so i
[1:07:35] could remove mountains and have charity
[1:07:36] and have nothing brother brahm says this
[1:07:37] is what you've got to get here is the
[1:07:39] holy ghost he says then you've got the
[1:07:40] right thing then he can use you to
[1:07:43] anything he wants to use you in because
[1:07:45] you're in the body and subject to any of
[1:07:47] those gifts
[1:07:49] but see to have one of those gifts
[1:07:51] outside of the body
[1:07:53] let me put it this way to have one of
[1:07:54] those gifts outside of the baptism of
[1:07:56] the holy spirit
[1:07:58] it would do you no good
[1:08:01] amen it would do you no good without the
[1:08:03] holy spirit though i speak with tongues
[1:08:04] of men and angels and have not charity
[1:08:06] it profits me nothing though i have
[1:08:08] faith and can understand all the
[1:08:09] mysteries of god it profits me nothing
[1:08:11] do i give my body to be burnt as a
[1:08:13] sacrifice give all my goods to the poor
[1:08:15] though i have faith to move a mountain i
[1:08:17] am nothing see
[1:08:18] don't depend on those things he says the
[1:08:21] holy spirit is a being it's god god in
[1:08:24] you the person god that's lit your whole
[1:08:27] entire being you're changed you're a new
[1:08:30] creature
[1:08:31] any little thing that's wrong he'll tell
[1:08:33] you that's wrong then quit don't do it
[1:08:36] father i didn't mean to do that you
[1:08:38] forgive me see and that's the holy
[1:08:40] spirit he says the holy spirit will
[1:08:42] absolutely be in what corrective mode in
[1:08:44] your life when you get off the word when
[1:08:46] you get into your carnality when you get
[1:08:48] into yourself the holy spirit will check
[1:08:50] you and say whoa whoa
[1:08:53] this isn't of me this isn't of the word
[1:08:56] we got to stop this
[1:08:58] amen and then there's surrender and
[1:09:00] there's repentance and then there's
[1:09:01] obedience or else there's what
[1:09:02] discipline that's the way god works
[1:09:04] every single time let's take it a little
[1:09:06] bit further because sometimes we think
[1:09:08] it's our knowledge that makes us
[1:09:09] valuable to the body
[1:09:11] amen you've been citing the message for
[1:09:13] all these years it could be easy for an
[1:09:14] elder to think well the reason that i'm
[1:09:16] valuable now is because i have all this
[1:09:17] knowledge
[1:09:19] but we know what paul said about that in
[1:09:20] first corinthians 80 says now as
[1:09:22] touching things offered to idols we know
[1:09:24] that we all have knowledge he says
[1:09:26] knowledge puffeth up but charity edifier
[1:09:29] okay so let's go to the amplified it it
[1:09:31] expands it a bit it says now about food
[1:09:33] offered to idols of course we all we
[1:09:36] know that we all possess knowledge
[1:09:37] concerning these matters because
[1:09:38] remember he had to tell them you know if
[1:09:39] things are offered to idols and you
[1:09:41] don't know about it go ahead and eat it
[1:09:42] and don't ask doubt you know that's
[1:09:44] that's a scripture don't ask don't tell
[1:09:46] is food offered to idols that's the only
[1:09:48] thing amen he says if you don't know
[1:09:50] anything about it eat it in confidence
[1:09:51] who cares but he says the minute you
[1:09:53] know it's offered to an idol you can't
[1:09:55] eat it he says we know all this
[1:09:57] he said of course
[1:09:59] we know that all of us possess knowledge
[1:10:01] concerning these matters yet mere
[1:10:03] knowledge paul diminishes it paul
[1:10:05] diminishes knowledge like this he says
[1:10:07] this is mere knowledge
[1:10:08] when you say something's mere it means
[1:10:10] it's virtually worthless
[1:10:12] right
[1:10:13] you know david was a mere youth to
[1:10:16] goliath right just a little boy
[1:10:18] not worthy of anything that's what paul
[1:10:20] says here this is mere knowledge we're
[1:10:21] talking about
[1:10:24] mere knowledge causes people to be
[1:10:25] puffed up to bear themselves loftily and
[1:10:28] be proud but love which is affection and
[1:10:32] good will and benevolence edifies
[1:10:35] and builds up and encourages one to grow
[1:10:39] to his full stature amen amen so in
[1:10:42] other words what knowledge we have is
[1:10:43] not to raise ourselves above somebody
[1:10:45] else to prove ourselves to be better
[1:10:47] than that amen but if it is godly love
[1:10:49] it is tempered by love and our goal is
[1:10:51] to raise that person to what the
[1:10:53] standard of the word
[1:10:55] not the standard of me not the standard
[1:10:57] of the pastor not the standard of
[1:10:59] anybody else but it is to raise them to
[1:11:01] the standard of the word and that is
[1:11:03] what edification is is when you raise
[1:11:05] somebody to the standard of the word
[1:11:07] amen we all have different thoughts we
[1:11:08] all have different ideas we all have
[1:11:10] different preferences i have a lot i
[1:11:12] have a lot of preferences amen amen but
[1:11:15] when i come to bring that to somebody
[1:11:16] else there's no place for that and then
[1:11:18] when i'm looking to edify somebody my
[1:11:20] preferences aren't going to do it what
[1:11:22] i've got to do is bring it subject to
[1:11:23] the word and say this is what the word
[1:11:25] says and then it's not a preference but
[1:11:27] it is a requirement amen it is god's way
[1:11:29] it is god's thinking rather than mine so
[1:11:31] i have to be subject to the word when i
[1:11:33] come behind this pulpit but not only
[1:11:34] behind this pulpit but every one of us
[1:11:36] as we're talking to each other as we're
[1:11:38] encouraging each other as we're even
[1:11:40] correcting one another we have to bring
[1:11:41] it to the standard of the word not to
[1:11:43] the standard of me amen
[1:11:46] i remember brother chris moritz said
[1:11:47] something at a
[1:11:49] couple's fellowship one time uh
[1:11:51] we went to a camp for for a weekend with
[1:11:53] the with the couples the married couples
[1:11:55] and and in answering the question he
[1:11:57] says when i teach my children he says i
[1:11:59] point them to the word of god not to me
[1:12:02] he says that way when i fail they know
[1:12:04] that i failed not the word of god he
[1:12:06] says i don't point them to my standard i
[1:12:08] point them to the word standard because
[1:12:10] inevitably i'm going to fail so you
[1:12:12] don't want them to say well that's the
[1:12:13] word failing but rather he says we point
[1:12:15] them to the word and then when i fail i
[1:12:17] can humble myself to the word and i can
[1:12:18] humble myself to the children because
[1:12:20] we're all looking to the word rather
[1:12:22] than looking to dad to be perfect amen
[1:12:25] amen
[1:12:26] paul says that we are to be speaking the
[1:12:28] truth in love that gives us motive
[1:12:30] amen everything we speak to our fellow
[1:12:33] believers is supposed to be in love and
[1:12:35] the objective is to what to edify amen
[1:12:37] to raise them up to the standard of the
[1:12:39] word so we are agents of love and what
[1:12:41] motivates us is the truth that we are to
[1:12:43] share to bring them back to their
[1:12:44] position in christ amen
[1:12:46] paul continues he says and if any man
[1:12:48] think that he knoweth anything
[1:12:50] he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to
[1:12:52] know
[1:12:54] i tell you
[1:12:56] take this service personally amen take
[1:12:59] it personally this was very personal to
[1:13:00] me as i was going through this if any
[1:13:02] man think he knows anything he knows
[1:13:04] nothing as yet he ought to know the
[1:13:06] amplified says
[1:13:07] this if anyone imagines that he has come
[1:13:10] to know and understand much of divine
[1:13:13] things
[1:13:14] without love he does not yet perceive
[1:13:17] recognize and understand as strongly and
[1:13:20] clearly nor has he become as intimately
[1:13:23] acquainted with anything as he ought or
[1:13:27] as is necessary
[1:13:29] when you think you've got it figured out
[1:13:30] when you go into education when you go
[1:13:32] into the higher you know halls of
[1:13:34] learning you go into you know people
[1:13:35] that are doing the masters and things
[1:13:36] and they'll say the more i know the less
[1:13:38] i know because you the further you go
[1:13:41] the broader it gets the and the thing is
[1:13:43] they can only end up focusing on such a
[1:13:44] narrow thing because they don't have the
[1:13:46] bandwidth they don't have the capacity
[1:13:48] to try and understand everything so what
[1:13:50] they do is they get deeper and deeper
[1:13:51] but it gets sharper and sharper and
[1:13:52] sharper you can't go deeper and deeper
[1:13:54] and deeper and understand everything you
[1:13:56] understand less but you understand more
[1:13:58] of a very particular area but you lose
[1:14:00] the you lose the broadness of your of
[1:14:02] your understanding and you bring it down
[1:14:03] to a very specific point amen
[1:14:05] so what's paul is talking about right
[1:14:07] here is religious arrogance yes amen if
[1:14:10] we could speak it clearly this is
[1:14:12] religious arrogance he says that
[1:14:13] somebody that that is coming across and
[1:14:15] they're saying i know this and i know
[1:14:16] this and i know this what they are as a
[1:14:18] know-it-all
[1:14:19] amen and that's religious arrogance and
[1:14:21] i can say that because i
[1:14:23] have had to deal with this in my own
[1:14:25] life
[1:14:26] i mean that's what this looks like is
[1:14:27] when you think that you know more
[1:14:29] than somebody that's been serving the
[1:14:30] lord for 20 or 30 years chances are you
[1:14:33] don't chances are you know nothing as
[1:14:35] yet you ought to know amen i can say
[1:14:37] that i i'm a recovery know-it-all if i
[1:14:40] can put it that way man so i'm not here
[1:14:42] i'm not here preaching at anyone like i
[1:14:44] said this is a personal sermon to me
[1:14:45] okay but if it applies take it get
[1:14:48] personal this morning look at yourself
[1:14:49] this morning amen amen when you think
[1:14:52] you know it when you think you've got it
[1:14:53] all when you think you've got it all
[1:14:55] figured out you don't have a clue
[1:14:57] you don't have a clue you don't have a
[1:14:59] clue and you need to get down on your
[1:15:01] knees and you need to humble yourself
[1:15:02] and repent and say lord i don't know a
[1:15:04] thing i need you to help me with this
[1:15:06] amen
[1:15:07] amen
[1:15:08] the problem with people like this is
[1:15:10] that it's based on what they've heard or
[1:15:12] what they've read rather than a personal
[1:15:13] experience this is knowledge without
[1:15:15] experience and that's what creates
[1:15:17] religious arrogance is that they can
[1:15:18] read the bible they can listen to the
[1:15:20] message they can read the message they
[1:15:21] can do all these things but until it
[1:15:22] becomes a reality in their life because
[1:15:24] what god interprets his word by what
[1:15:26] bringing it to pass and if it hasn't
[1:15:28] been brought to pass in your life you
[1:15:30] actually don't probably have a
[1:15:31] revelation of what he meant in the first
[1:15:32] place
[1:15:33] unfortunately amen
[1:15:35] what we're talking about remember was
[1:15:36] what love and that love is the holy
[1:15:38] spirit brother ellie was talking about
[1:15:40] it in his prayer this morning he said
[1:15:41] what that that god is love amen and that
[1:15:43] god is light
[1:15:45] amen and that love will bring light
[1:15:47] amen it's going to bring it every time
[1:15:49] because what says thy word is a lamp
[1:15:51] unto my feet and a light unto thy path
[1:15:53] my path not thy path my path amen so the
[1:15:56] holy spirit's going to work in me to
[1:15:58] open up my way not focus on you to open
[1:16:00] up your ways so much amen the word is
[1:16:02] working on me to bring me to the place
[1:16:04] and then the word is working on you to
[1:16:05] bring your place but the word is not
[1:16:07] working on me to bring you to your place
[1:16:09] as a minister i have a part in that but
[1:16:11] brother bob does not come over and start
[1:16:13] working on uh sister maureen or or
[1:16:15] brother joe or brother paul no no no the
[1:16:18] word is there to show him and then when
[1:16:20] he has something that god has opened to
[1:16:22] him when he has experience in life as
[1:16:24] opposed to just head knowledge then he
[1:16:26] can share that with somebody in the
[1:16:27] hopes that they will accept it and move
[1:16:29] up in their relationship with christ
[1:16:31] amen but he is not there god's not there
[1:16:32] giving brother bob the will for brother
[1:16:34] paul's life that's not the way it's
[1:16:36] meant amen but paul has the holy ghost
[1:16:38] himself and that's what's going to show
[1:16:39] him his will amen generally speaking
[1:16:41] amen
[1:16:42] i want to hit this scripture from a few
[1:16:43] different angles stay tight with me i'm
[1:16:45] going to use the prophet's words i don't
[1:16:46] want to preach it i just want to use his
[1:16:48] words so that it
[1:16:50] it comes clean okay i don't want to
[1:16:51] inject myself into this one too much i
[1:16:53] just want to take this and push it down
[1:16:55] the way that it came to me amen
[1:16:57] so how do you recognize religious
[1:16:59] arrogance
[1:17:00] the first thing you'll see is that it
[1:17:01] won't take correction from the word of
[1:17:03] god
[1:17:04] brown says this and sometimes something
[1:17:06] operating has to be called or said
[1:17:08] something about it called down or
[1:17:10] something of that order and the person
[1:17:12] that's got that gif gift rejects it just
[1:17:15] remember they refuse it remember the
[1:17:17] gift wasn't right he's saying if there's
[1:17:19] something comes across if there's
[1:17:21] something that comes out if there's
[1:17:22] something that's been spoken if there's
[1:17:24] something that's been delivered to the
[1:17:25] people and it's not right and it won't
[1:17:27] receive correction he says if the person
[1:17:30] refuses it then the gift wasn't right
[1:17:33] it wasn't god in the first place the
[1:17:35] spirit of god is always ready for
[1:17:37] correction sweet and humble willing see
[1:17:42] if it stands up and says i'll do it
[1:17:44] anyhow you know how sometimes just
[1:17:46] remember he says arrogant spirits are
[1:17:48] not of god
[1:17:49] see so why take a substitute when
[1:17:51] everything the whole earth is filled
[1:17:53] with the glory of god you see the real
[1:17:55] power of god why will we take a
[1:17:56] substitute we're too late in the day now
[1:17:59] but remember the bible has said he'd
[1:18:00] come in like just as sly as he could and
[1:18:02] deceive the very elected if possible
[1:18:04] amen an arrogant spirit never receives
[1:18:07] correction from the word amen
[1:18:09] like i said how do you respond to a
[1:18:11] situation like this i'm a former
[1:18:12] inaudible god still has to keep it i
[1:18:14] have to keep that under the blood i have
[1:18:15] to keep that under prayer amen i'm an
[1:18:17] intellectual person i'm relatively
[1:18:19] intelligent and then that's something
[1:18:21] that'll flare up smart people tend to be
[1:18:23] religiously arrogant
[1:18:24] okay amen amen this is me talking okay
[1:18:29] intellectual people tend to be
[1:18:30] religiously arrogant so i'm pointing to
[1:18:32] myself here okay if you're thinking of
[1:18:34] somebody think of brother john
[1:18:36] okay
[1:18:37] and pray for me
[1:18:39] okay this is this is down this is rubber
[1:18:42] meets the road okay
[1:18:43] all right but look to me look to me and
[1:18:45] say if there's somebody that reminds me
[1:18:47] of it's probably brother john and then
[1:18:48] we'll be all because i'm pointing to
[1:18:49] myself okay amen but what happened was
[1:18:52] what god had to humble me god had to
[1:18:54] break me down big fish little pond god
[1:18:56] took me into a really big pond
[1:18:59] right and showed me you're not as smart
[1:19:00] as you think you are not as gifted as
[1:19:02] you think you are not as intellectual as
[1:19:03] you think you are not as hard a worker
[1:19:05] as you think you are not as great a
[1:19:07] husband as you think you are not a great
[1:19:08] father you need you you really ought to
[1:19:10] be and what do you do he started showing
[1:19:12] me the weaknesses but that weaknesses
[1:19:13] came through what the word
[1:19:15] that weaknesses came by what looking
[1:19:17] around in the body and seeing those that
[1:19:19] could do things better than i could
[1:19:21] and then all it takes is one step into
[1:19:22] the halls of memorial university and i
[1:19:24] realized i wasn't the smartest person on
[1:19:25] the planet i didn't think i was the
[1:19:27] smartest person on the planet but i
[1:19:28] thought i was probably smarter than i
[1:19:29] was you step into mine and all of a
[1:19:31] sudden people are acing things and
[1:19:32] you're going through with 70s and 80s
[1:19:34] right
[1:19:35] and you say how hard you study for that
[1:19:37] and not really
[1:19:38] oh
[1:19:39] you know
[1:19:40] now i became a small fish in an ocean
[1:19:43] amen but then he starts working on what
[1:19:45] your spiritual life and all of a sudden
[1:19:46] you know maybe you are taking cracks at
[1:19:48] this one or that one and i've told this
[1:19:50] to the different ones and and i remember
[1:19:51] when i went away and i came back you
[1:19:53] remember and i apologize to a couple
[1:19:54] different couples in that and i said i
[1:19:56] was looking at you through a certain
[1:19:57] lens and i was critical
[1:20:00] of the pastor i was critical of the
[1:20:01] elders in the church and these different
[1:20:02] things and i had to go and i had to
[1:20:04] apologize for that sister martin do you
[1:20:05] remember that
[1:20:06] okay that was when i came back from
[1:20:08] dallas and the lord really dealt with me
[1:20:09] in dallas my wife would remember and i
[1:20:11] just there there was i was just looking
[1:20:13] at things through what religious
[1:20:15] arrogance and when i was there i saw
[1:20:18] what i was supposed to look like what i
[1:20:20] was supposed to be i had the holy ghost
[1:20:22] that had nothing to do with it but
[1:20:23] rather i was so caught up in what i
[1:20:25] thought i was that i couldn't get to
[1:20:26] what i really should be and god broke me
[1:20:28] down and broke me down and broke me down
[1:20:30] he's been breaking me down ever since so
[1:20:31] that the point is when you start to
[1:20:33] raise up you start to realize that
[1:20:34] definitely isn't the holy spirit because
[1:20:36] he took care of that when i was 21 or 22
[1:20:38] years old
[1:20:39] all right you recognize and you say okay
[1:20:40] lord here it comes again batten down the
[1:20:43] hatches right and you start to get under
[1:20:45] into what prayer and you say lord don't
[1:20:46] let this don't let this come up again
[1:20:49] amen like i said look at me look at me
[1:20:51] we're talking about brother john today
[1:20:52] okay all right but i'm glad people
[1:20:55] responded the way that they did with
[1:20:56] maturity with grace
[1:20:59] probably with some giggles behind closed
[1:21:01] doors you know
[1:21:02] when they see the foolishness that comes
[1:21:04] out of a young man's mouth that think
[1:21:05] he's more spiritual than he is
[1:21:07] right
[1:21:09] but there is a place where that can be
[1:21:11] taken away
[1:21:12] and look at where i am today standing
[1:21:14] behind a pulpit humbly i believe
[1:21:16] why because he broke me down and then he
[1:21:18] took the blinders off my eyes that had
[1:21:20] me looking at everyone except for myself
[1:21:22] amen
[1:21:24] but listen to this
[1:21:25] because this is the response to
[1:21:26] religious arrogance
[1:21:28] brother braham says now surely after all
[1:21:30] these years in the field and around the
[1:21:32] world and seeing different people i
[1:21:33] ought to know a little bit about the
[1:21:34] gate to enter in it
[1:21:37] and if you want to get somewhere with
[1:21:39] god never let an arrogant spirit ever
[1:21:41] come around you
[1:21:43] don't let no malice come in
[1:21:45] no matter what anybody does if they are
[1:21:47] wrong don't you never build up a complex
[1:21:49] against that person
[1:21:51] see you be sweet and kind remember god
[1:21:54] loved you when you were in sin
[1:21:57] amen and if the spirit of god is in you
[1:22:00] you love the other person when he's in
[1:22:02] wrong see just pray for them and love
[1:22:05] one another what's he saying when
[1:22:06] arrogance comes your way when you want
[1:22:09] to respond to arrogance with arrogance
[1:22:11] he says don't let that happen amen don't
[1:22:14] let malice come in just taste sweet and
[1:22:16] humble is what he says arrogance is not
[1:22:18] the response to arrogance when the holy
[1:22:20] spirit's in the body amen that is not
[1:22:22] what we're looking for he says don't you
[1:22:25] get the spirit on you that's in that
[1:22:26] person
[1:22:27] right you hold yourself steady and you
[1:22:29] hold to the word amen
[1:22:31] listen to what paul said and i i've i've
[1:22:33] talked about this
[1:22:35] recently this is galatian 6 it says
[1:22:37] brethren if a man be overtaken in a
[1:22:39] fault
[1:22:40] ye which are spiritual
[1:22:43] so the requirement
[1:22:45] to address a fault is spiritual people
[1:22:48] restore such a one in the spirit of
[1:22:50] meekness so the proof of spirituality in
[1:22:52] this situation is meekness brother joe
[1:22:55] was talking to me about this some time
[1:22:56] ago and then the other night what is
[1:22:58] meekness meekness is the power to do
[1:23:00] something but the character not to do it
[1:23:05] right shock and awe
[1:23:07] thunder and lightning
[1:23:09] right the sons of thunder remember the
[1:23:11] sons of thunder
[1:23:13] that was not meekness
[1:23:15] that was religious arrogance wasn't it
[1:23:18] lord let's destroy them off the planet
[1:23:19] they're doing what you're doing
[1:23:22] right
[1:23:23] they're doing what only us are supposed
[1:23:24] to do
[1:23:26] i thought was great
[1:23:27] you know where jesus just kind of
[1:23:29] laughed at them i think you know
[1:23:31] just laughed you kidding me you're
[1:23:33] kidding me we're going to destroy
[1:23:34] somebody you know
[1:23:37] and yet we look at our own lives and he
[1:23:38] could have destroyed us first things
[1:23:39] that were far worse i think you know
[1:23:42] he says what
[1:23:43] do it in a spirit of meekness
[1:23:45] considering thyself lest thou also be
[1:23:48] tempted
[1:23:49] tempted what
[1:23:51] put in the same situation they are and
[1:23:53] get the same spirit on you that they
[1:23:54] have amen or look at it another way
[1:23:57] tempted to do the wrong thing
[1:23:59] to do the wrong response amen bear ye
[1:24:02] one another's burdens and so fulfill the
[1:24:04] law of christ
[1:24:05] for if a man think himself to be
[1:24:07] something when he is nothing he
[1:24:09] deceiveth himself paul hits us a number
[1:24:10] of times when you think you're something
[1:24:12] you're nothing when you think you know
[1:24:13] it all you know nothing but look at this
[1:24:15] he says for if a man think himself to be
[1:24:17] something when he is nothing this is a
[1:24:19] continual condition for a christian
[1:24:22] speaking of our humanity we are nothing
[1:24:25] you are nothing and i am nothing and
[1:24:27] really what we have to look at is to say
[1:24:29] our worth is only through what god in us
[1:24:31] and what god has done with us and what
[1:24:33] god is doing with us and the parts of us
[1:24:35] that are surrendered and connected to
[1:24:36] christ that's the only thing that's
[1:24:38] worth right we otherwise we are
[1:24:40] worthless we are the same as the world
[1:24:42] right because we are of the world
[1:24:44] in that sense you know our our outer and
[1:24:46] our and our middle zones are our flesh
[1:24:49] and our spirit realm they're all world
[1:24:51] right and that's what we're fighting
[1:24:53] with day by day by day and we're
[1:24:54] fighting because they're not of the
[1:24:55] spirit of god
[1:24:57] right so the only thing like i said is
[1:24:58] your soul that's that's sealed by the
[1:25:00] holy spirit and so everything else about
[1:25:02] you is nothing and the thing in you that
[1:25:04] is something isn't even you it's christ
[1:25:06] so you are nothing you are nothing so
[1:25:08] don't try and pretend you're something
[1:25:10] and make that how you're going to
[1:25:11] respond to somebody amen
[1:25:14] amen
[1:25:15] paul hits on this time and time again
[1:25:17] don't get caught up in who and what you
[1:25:19] are and use as a as a reason to bash
[1:25:21] somebody amen
[1:25:23] men brother gerald
[1:25:24] i i think the theme of brother gerald's
[1:25:26] message these days is what grace
[1:25:28] grace grace that called you grace that
[1:25:30] saved you grace that opened your eyes
[1:25:31] grace that gave you the holy ghost grace
[1:25:32] that gives you faith to please him grace
[1:25:34] allows you to overcome in this life amen
[1:25:36] everything we have start to finish is
[1:25:38] grace
[1:25:39] amen so why would we be proud of what we
[1:25:41] have of who we are
[1:25:42] thankful yes
[1:25:44] proud no
[1:25:46] because it's not ours it's not something
[1:25:47] we did
[1:25:48] haughty arrogant never can't be because
[1:25:51] it's not your working it's his working
[1:25:52] in you amen amen
[1:25:54] brother brown puts it this way he says
[1:25:56] and god is so unusual he does things in
[1:25:58] such an unusual way so contrary to
[1:26:01] science so contrary to education so
[1:26:03] contrary to sometimes man's theology
[1:26:05] just contrary to that god does that just
[1:26:08] to show he is god
[1:26:11] and to do that he has to take somebody
[1:26:13] that knows none of these things so that
[1:26:15] he can work through that person when
[1:26:17] jesus came he didn't take caiaphas the
[1:26:19] priest that was trained and ready for
[1:26:21] the job he went down and got a man men
[1:26:23] that couldn't even sign their name
[1:26:25] ignorant and unlearned the bible said we
[1:26:26] were they were because god takes nothing
[1:26:29] to make something out of it see
[1:26:31] amen and whenever you get to a place
[1:26:33] that you feel you're nothing then you're
[1:26:36] just about ready to come to god
[1:26:38] and when you get to a place that you
[1:26:40] know nothing but you want to know
[1:26:42] something then he'll reveal himself to
[1:26:45] you amen amen can we check our lives to
[1:26:47] say and say that's where i'm coming from
[1:26:50] i know nothing my little p brain
[1:26:52] compared to god's brain is nothing
[1:26:54] my knowledge my understanding
[1:26:57] all of it is nothing compared to him
[1:26:59] lord i want to know your way i want to
[1:27:01] know what you think i want to know your
[1:27:03] response i want to know your attitude i
[1:27:04] want to know your strength i want to
[1:27:06] know your grace i want to know your
[1:27:07] forgiveness i want to know your love i
[1:27:09] want to know your joy amen not what i've
[1:27:12] what create develop
[1:27:14] right make up
[1:27:16] conjure for the situation but lord i
[1:27:18] want you
[1:27:19] to be what i get out of this amen
[1:27:22] amen because the thing is otherwise
[1:27:24] what's going to happen is if we inject
[1:27:25] ourselves into it the result will not be
[1:27:27] of eternal value because what it's
[1:27:29] denominational the minute you inject a
[1:27:30] man into it the menu man i say a man
[1:27:34] man's thoughts men's ideas meant
[1:27:35] theology whatever it would be the minute
[1:27:36] you do that it becomes denominational
[1:27:38] and that means god is out of it right 99
[1:27:41] truth is still wrong
[1:27:43] you got to have 100 amen
[1:27:46] going back to our place in ephesians
[1:27:48] paul says this but speaking the truth in
[1:27:50] love may grow up
[1:27:52] and into
[1:27:53] grow up into
[1:27:56] him in all things which is the head even
[1:27:59] christ and then catch the word and grow
[1:28:00] up into him
[1:28:02] up
[1:28:03] so you're at a low level
[1:28:05] and you come to a high level and then
[1:28:06] says into so you are out of and you grow
[1:28:09] into
[1:28:10] so you grow up and you go into him which
[1:28:13] means you are out and below him if we
[1:28:15] could put it that way to start amen you
[1:28:16] are dead in your sins and trespasses
[1:28:18] that's what paul says amen but what you
[1:28:20] grow up and you grow into him so that
[1:28:22] what means what to connect to be raised
[1:28:25] to a higher level to become a part of to
[1:28:27] be tied to to be united in christ and
[1:28:29] not just in any old way but in a way
[1:28:31] that makes christ the head
[1:28:33] amen not just half lord because that's
[1:28:36] not lord at all but lord amen lord means
[1:28:39] that he is what the ruler over all amen
[1:28:41] that he is the head nobody has two
[1:28:43] brains
[1:28:44] right you only have one brain and so
[1:28:46] what this is saying is that you will
[1:28:48] come to this place where what god is in
[1:28:50] control of all things in your life
[1:28:54] can you be a believer and god not have
[1:28:55] control in all places of your life
[1:28:58] 100
[1:28:59] we're still here we're still fighting
[1:29:01] we're still struggling amen there are
[1:29:03] places where i'm strong that you're not
[1:29:04] strong and there's places you're strong
[1:29:06] that i'm not amen all based on where
[1:29:08] we're at in our walk
[1:29:09] and sometimes god works on things in
[1:29:11] your life a lot sooner than he works on
[1:29:12] them with mine and vice versa and then
[1:29:14] so we can't go around taking the
[1:29:15] christianity out of each other because
[1:29:17] we're mature because we're connected to
[1:29:18] christ because we're surrendered to
[1:29:20] christ in an area and somebody isn't and
[1:29:21] you say well they can't have the holy
[1:29:22] ghost they can't be this they can't be
[1:29:24] that no no no they just aren't at that
[1:29:26] point in that spot in their life yet and
[1:29:28] that's all there is to it amen so
[1:29:30] maturity and the bride means that she is
[1:29:32] subject and connected to christ in every
[1:29:34] way she surrendered her thoughts her
[1:29:36] ideas her preferences and she is subject
[1:29:38] to the will of god
[1:29:40] brother brown put it this way he says
[1:29:41] when you surrender fully he'll come in
[1:29:44] fully
[1:29:45] when you surrender fully he'll come in
[1:29:48] fully now that looks
[1:29:50] a little different than maybe what we
[1:29:51] think because we think we just open one
[1:29:53] door to our lives and we surrender and
[1:29:54] he comes in he fills everything but the
[1:29:56] reality is you have 7 322 doors in your
[1:29:59] life
[1:30:00] where you let him into the main part of
[1:30:02] your life and then you've got to go
[1:30:02] around and you've got to open all those
[1:30:04] little doors to your finances to your
[1:30:05] relationships to your job to your career
[1:30:08] to your education to where you live to
[1:30:10] who you sit under in ministry to what
[1:30:11] you do in the local body to where you
[1:30:13] live
[1:30:14] right all of these things
[1:30:16] relationships past hurts disappointments
[1:30:19] all of those things are doors that are
[1:30:21] locked and you've got to go in and the
[1:30:22] holy spirit's throwing through the main
[1:30:24] chat of your life and you've got to open
[1:30:25] it up and let him fill it right and then
[1:30:27] you go the next door and you open it up
[1:30:28] and you let him fill it what does it do
[1:30:29] it cleans it out it burns it out
[1:30:31] it burns it i like what brother ellie
[1:30:33] said we talked it was what fire
[1:30:35] amen the love of god is a fire what will
[1:30:37] it do it'll burn out everything that
[1:30:39] needs to come out and it'll fill it with
[1:30:40] what the bomb of gilead the holy spirit
[1:30:42] in your life amen
[1:30:44] amen
[1:30:45] what is it this can't be a culture amen
[1:30:48] the bride can't be in unity until every
[1:30:50] single one of us is surrendered to
[1:30:52] christ in every part of our life
[1:30:55] so paul said
[1:30:56] amen
[1:30:58] let me finish the quote when you
[1:30:59] surrender fully he'll come in fully but
[1:31:00] until you surrender he can't come in
[1:31:03] fully surrender surrender your thoughts
[1:31:06] surrender your thinking surrender your
[1:31:07] life surrender your all surrender your
[1:31:10] prestige
[1:31:11] surrender everything to him now and
[1:31:13] he'll come in and fill you with the holy
[1:31:15] ghost that's what he's here to do
[1:31:17] amen
[1:31:19] amen like i said it can't be a culture
[1:31:21] that's controlling us it can't be a
[1:31:22] message culture
[1:31:24] amen
[1:31:25] that that's going to kill
[1:31:27] any church is a message culture we're
[1:31:30] talking about the life of god remember
[1:31:32] the quote brother brown says it is god
[1:31:34] in you that's when you've got what you
[1:31:36] need is god in you the holy spirit it
[1:31:38] doesn't matter if you are surrounded by
[1:31:40] people that believe you have to believe
[1:31:42] and have received the holy ghost for you
[1:31:44] to be of any part of this body amen by
[1:31:46] one spirit we are baptized into one body
[1:31:49] now multiple bodies one body one spirit
[1:31:51] which is the holy spirit which is christ
[1:31:53] in you which is love amen that's it
[1:31:55] that's the peak right here but building
[1:31:58] you up into the place where the only
[1:31:59] thing that's working in you and
[1:32:00] operating in you is the holy spirit amen
[1:32:03] amen often the source of conflict like i
[1:32:06] said is when i'm mature
[1:32:07] and you're not in a certain area or as
[1:32:09] is more likely you're mature in an area
[1:32:11] and i'm not
[1:32:13] right and so what happens is that you're
[1:32:15] being moved by the holy spirit and i
[1:32:16] haven't surrendered just yet so if we
[1:32:18] try and work together that's not going
[1:32:19] to work is it
[1:32:21] amen if we're trying to work on the
[1:32:23] music program and brother gerald's led
[1:32:24] by the holy spirit and brother bob
[1:32:26] doesn't have the holy ghost yet at the
[1:32:27] tender age of 68
[1:32:30] then we've got a problem don't we
[1:32:31] brothers
[1:32:32] because brother gerald's going to be led
[1:32:34] by the holy spirit and brother bob's
[1:32:35] going to be led by what he was watching
[1:32:36] on youtube on how to have an effective
[1:32:38] service in the church
[1:32:41] guess what don't go to youtube for ideas
[1:32:44] on how to run a church
[1:32:47] don't go read books on how to run a
[1:32:49] church brother brown says get the holy
[1:32:50] ghost
[1:32:52] forget brother branham paul says get the
[1:32:54] holy ghost
[1:32:55] you know we don't have to you don't have
[1:32:57] to believe in a prophet to believe that
[1:32:58] you need to get the holy ghost to be a
[1:33:00] part of the of the bride of christ amen
[1:33:02] by one spirit like i said we're baptized
[1:33:04] amen so don't go running to youtube
[1:33:06] don't go run into this book or that book
[1:33:08] amen get the holy ghost and then go to
[1:33:10] the word of god and if you want to move
[1:33:11] past the word of god go to something
[1:33:13] that's ordained and vindicated and leave
[1:33:14] it there
[1:33:15] amen
[1:33:16] amen
[1:33:17] but in the end though
[1:33:19] just because brother bob doesn't have
[1:33:21] the holy ghost
[1:33:23] no i'm not going to go there brother bob
[1:33:25] cause you do
[1:33:26] just because brother bob's not
[1:33:27] surrendered this is what we'll do we're
[1:33:29] going to pick up brother bob just
[1:33:30] because brother bob's not surrendered in
[1:33:31] an area of his life don't let that mean
[1:33:33] that brother bob's not a christian
[1:33:34] don't let that mean that brother bob is
[1:33:36] not a believer right
[1:33:38] don't take away their christianity
[1:33:39] because they haven't matured in the area
[1:33:41] where you're strong amen the scripture
[1:33:43] says we do what we bear one another's
[1:33:45] burdens how do you bear the burden of
[1:33:47] somebody when you're strong where
[1:33:48] they're weak i mean that's why god gave
[1:33:50] us spouses so you can bear one another's
[1:33:52] burdens in a more intimate way amen
[1:33:54] because your wife is going to talk to
[1:33:55] you in a way she might not with another
[1:33:57] sister and then you can talk to your
[1:33:58] wife i can talk to my wife about things
[1:34:00] i wouldn't talk to anyone else about
[1:34:01] what she can bear my burden she can she
[1:34:03] can she can work with me she can support
[1:34:05] me in those areas where i struggle amen
[1:34:07] so what the idea of you being strong and
[1:34:09] them being weak is for you to help them
[1:34:11] not to bear them down it's to bear them
[1:34:12] up to hold them up until such time as
[1:34:14] they can mature and be connected to
[1:34:16] christ as we were talking about amen
[1:34:18] amen
[1:34:20] being in the body is what exposes those
[1:34:21] things quite often
[1:34:23] right you're with somebody and you're
[1:34:24] like wow they are so far ahead of me
[1:34:27] that's what happened to me when i went
[1:34:28] to dallas i realized wow i'm behind
[1:34:32] right and so what do you do you start
[1:34:33] going to god and saying look i obviously
[1:34:35] haven't done a good job of bringing
[1:34:36] myself up to speed so let's let you do
[1:34:38] it and so all of a sudden he does and
[1:34:40] that's what victory is most of the time
[1:34:41] is you saying i can't do it
[1:34:44] as soon as you say i can't do it god
[1:34:46] says okay i'm ready to move
[1:34:48] right and as soon as he's oh as soon as
[1:34:51] he moves
[1:34:52] who stops god
[1:34:53] who stops god
[1:34:55] when you surrender and he starts moving
[1:34:57] ain't nothing going to stop it amen
[1:35:00] that's what victory is so often that's
[1:35:01] the day we surrender to god and take him
[1:35:03] at his word that's when gross starts is
[1:35:05] when we stop and say this isn't me i
[1:35:08] can't do it lord i'm going to let you do
[1:35:10] it amen and what is it i'm going to
[1:35:11] believe your word above all else and i'm
[1:35:13] going to hold to that no matter what the
[1:35:14] symptoms are no matter what the the day
[1:35:16] looks like no matter what the bank
[1:35:17] account looks like no matter what the
[1:35:19] the cue for my business looks like
[1:35:21] no matter where you call me to go no
[1:35:23] matter what you call me to do i'm going
[1:35:24] to trust your work and that's where the
[1:35:25] growth starts is when you say not me
[1:35:28] it's you that's doing this
[1:35:30] because i wouldn't choose it
[1:35:31] i wouldn't choose i wouldn't choose to
[1:35:32] be up here
[1:35:34] you have to be crazy
[1:35:37] but says this notice let us remember he
[1:35:39] also created our bodies and won't our
[1:35:41] bodies have to obey him
[1:35:43] that's what we're talking about the
[1:35:44] bodies is the unsafe portion but he says
[1:35:46] it's got to obey what god amen amen you
[1:35:49] surrender your thoughts to him surrender
[1:35:51] your life to him surrender your faith to
[1:35:53] him and watch that body obey what he
[1:35:55] says if you're a drunkard and you can't
[1:35:57] quit drinking surrender that life to him
[1:35:59] and watch you'll drink no more if you're
[1:36:01] a habitual smoker and try to give it up
[1:36:03] and can't do it just surrender that to
[1:36:04] him and watch what happens he'll make
[1:36:06] that body come back in subjection to the
[1:36:09] word yes sir but you've got to surrender
[1:36:12] it to him you've got to believe him he
[1:36:15] made our bodies they obey his will also
[1:36:18] do you believe that he says if you're a
[1:36:20] christian you have to
[1:36:22] amen but what's he saying surrender
[1:36:25] surrender is what causes the connection
[1:36:26] to christ amen
[1:36:28] amen so we've got to get what connected
[1:36:29] to christ in every day of our life and
[1:36:31] that way i'll focus on me
[1:36:34] and you can focus on you and i won't
[1:36:36] focus on you because i'm too busy trying
[1:36:37] to get connected to christ in every area
[1:36:39] of my life amen and then when conflict
[1:36:41] comes what do we do we look at the word
[1:36:42] and we say lord lift me up and let me
[1:36:45] stand
[1:36:46] by faith on heaven's table and a higher
[1:36:49] plane
[1:36:50] then i have found lord plant my feet on
[1:36:53] higher ground not on the shoulders and
[1:36:56] neck of the brother or sister next to me
[1:36:59] right amen we're looking to stand on the
[1:37:01] word and grow in christ not on the backs
[1:37:03] of somebody else's failures amen
[1:37:05] so when that process is complete the
[1:37:07] result looks like this
[1:37:10] from whom the whole body from whom from
[1:37:12] whom who is that christ so from christ
[1:37:15] the whole body fitly joined together and
[1:37:17] compacted by that which every joint
[1:37:19] supply according to the effectual
[1:37:21] working in the measure of every part
[1:37:24] every part every person
[1:37:28] maketh increase of the body unto the
[1:37:29] edifying of itself and love said before
[1:37:32] this is the most difficult scripture to
[1:37:33] understand because it's a lot of big
[1:37:35] words and it's a run-on sentence so go
[1:37:37] to the amplified says for because of him
[1:37:39] because of christ the whole body the
[1:37:42] church and all its various parts closely
[1:37:44] joined and firmly knit together by the
[1:37:46] joints and ligaments
[1:37:48] with which it is supplied when each part
[1:37:52] with power adapted to its need is
[1:37:54] working properly in all its functions
[1:37:56] grows
[1:37:58] does not start but grows to full
[1:38:00] maturity building itself up in love amen
[1:38:04] amen with power adapted to its need the
[1:38:05] holy spirit working in the body puts
[1:38:07] power to where it's needed you can't put
[1:38:10] your full strength through your pinky
[1:38:12] and then if you got a pinky in the
[1:38:13] church don't put your full strength to
[1:38:14] it because you'll break it amen but you
[1:38:16] can put your full strength through your
[1:38:17] legs can't you you can put your full
[1:38:19] strength to your back because it's built
[1:38:21] to do it so he says he'll put power to
[1:38:23] the place where it's needed to achieve
[1:38:24] the job so guess what if i'm going to
[1:38:26] pick up something with my pinky
[1:38:28] i don't need to put all the power i have
[1:38:30] to do that
[1:38:31] but if i want to pick this pulpit up
[1:38:34] i'm going to need everything i've got
[1:38:35] don't i so the holy spirit applies power
[1:38:38] to the person
[1:38:40] to meet the need or the requirement that
[1:38:41] the body has of that body so guess what
[1:38:45] you may not need to have a you know look
[1:38:47] at the scripture it says some brought
[1:38:48] forth 30 fold and some 60 fold some 90
[1:38:50] and 100. guess what we don't all need
[1:38:52] 100 fold to be effective some of us only
[1:38:54] need 30 and some of us need 100. and
[1:38:56] then that's based on what we're doing
[1:38:58] within the body amen
[1:39:00] but notice now it says we don't find our
[1:39:02] place and then connect to christ this is
[1:39:05] where we get it backwards we say well i
[1:39:06] know what i'm supposed to be i know what
[1:39:08] i'm supposed to do and we start to do it
[1:39:10] but paul says this he says from whom
[1:39:13] says from christ the whole body is fitly
[1:39:14] joined together so you've got to get to
[1:39:16] christ first and then you're joined to
[1:39:19] the body amen so we don't find our place
[1:39:21] and then connect to christ but rather
[1:39:22] get yourself to christ get your life
[1:39:24] surrendered get yourself out of the way
[1:39:26] and then from there you surrender to his
[1:39:28] direction his leadership his will and
[1:39:29] then he
[1:39:30] joins you into the body he adds you to
[1:39:33] the body in the place that he
[1:39:35] has ordained for you amen amen we don't
[1:39:38] come with gifts and ideas and thoughts
[1:39:40] we come with a surrender heart and a
[1:39:41] surrender mind and then he takes us and
[1:39:43] places us in the place that he needs you
[1:39:45] to be where he wants you to be and
[1:39:47] sometimes it's temporary and sometimes
[1:39:48] it's permanent
[1:39:49] i've done just about every role there is
[1:39:51] in the church i've song led i i've done
[1:39:53] trustee i've done deacon i've done
[1:39:55] treasurer i've done audio visual work
[1:39:57] and then obviously i preached
[1:39:59] i've done all of it right it wasn't all
[1:40:01] permanent
[1:40:02] but he was moving me in different things
[1:40:04] and guess what i sat many years in the
[1:40:06] congregation same as everybody else
[1:40:08] right what he was moving me where i
[1:40:09] needed to be to learn what i need to
[1:40:11] learn to bring me to where he ultimately
[1:40:12] wanted me to be
[1:40:14] right can you imagine if i knew that i
[1:40:16] was going to be a minister at the
[1:40:17] beginning i probably have messed it up
[1:40:19] that's what you see a lot of people do
[1:40:20] is they'll mess it up because they see
[1:40:21] the end but they don't they don't adjust
[1:40:23] to the process that god wants them to do
[1:40:24] and then they won't surrender to it
[1:40:27] brother braham says this you don't have
[1:40:28] to talk so much about it god does his
[1:40:31] own talking
[1:40:32] god testifies of his gifts but all those
[1:40:34] gifts are wonderful they're dandy and we
[1:40:36] love them god grant them to every one of
[1:40:38] us would have every gift but i'd rather
[1:40:40] have the giver than all the gifts
[1:40:42] paul said though i could have the gifts
[1:40:43] without the giver now if we have went to
[1:40:46] seeking the giver instead of the gifts i
[1:40:48] believe the church would have been
[1:40:49] further up the road don't you think so
[1:40:52] if we'd stay close to god and loved him
[1:40:54] and just kept living for him and not
[1:40:56] trying to push things over just live for
[1:40:58] god and live a pure holy life and live
[1:41:01] and pray every day keep yourself
[1:41:03] refreshed in his presence god will take
[1:41:05] care of the rest of it my wife shared
[1:41:07] this with us the other day and it was
[1:41:08] just what i needed for this part of the
[1:41:09] sermon
[1:41:10] amen
[1:41:11] he says
[1:41:12] he will adopt the people into his own
[1:41:15] beloved body the church he'll do it
[1:41:17] he'll do it we don't do it he'll do it
[1:41:19] amen and when the rapture comes you'll
[1:41:22] be found without a blemish because
[1:41:23] you're living in the presence of the
[1:41:25] king that's the secret friend there it
[1:41:27] is when you're meeting really face to
[1:41:29] face with demon powers when you're
[1:41:30] meeting face-to-face with opposition
[1:41:32] that's where the testing time comes and
[1:41:34] it changes only it's strongest at its
[1:41:36] weakest link that's right and when
[1:41:38] you're face to face with opposition be
[1:41:40] sure that you know what you're talking
[1:41:42] about
[1:41:43] what be sure that he has called you and
[1:41:44] placed you where you are and then you
[1:41:46] can have confidence that you can stand
[1:41:47] on the ground that you're you're
[1:41:48] standing on amen if you're not confident
[1:41:50] that that's your land you're going to
[1:41:51] get pushed off because the other guy's
[1:41:53] going to want it more than you are amen
[1:41:55] you might say well i'm an arm so i'm
[1:41:56] going to do what arms do
[1:41:58] don't do that
[1:42:00] don't do that don't say i know what i'm
[1:42:02] gonna be so i'm gonna be it no
[1:42:04] you just surrender to him and let him
[1:42:05] grow you into whatever he wants to be
[1:42:07] amen not everybody is meant for
[1:42:09] leadership
[1:42:10] okay we look in this church we've got
[1:42:12] one pastor and we've got 30 odd people
[1:42:14] here guess what we can't all be pastors
[1:42:17] right can't all be leaders
[1:42:19] can all be elders can't all be deacons
[1:42:22] everybody's got to have their place and
[1:42:23] we've got a lot of people that want to
[1:42:24] be leaders that aren't meant to be
[1:42:25] leaders because it would break them
[1:42:27] either the stress would break them or
[1:42:29] they get caught up in the things that
[1:42:30] that cause leaders to fail if you're a
[1:42:32] man it's going to be women popularity
[1:42:34] and money you can't handle it amen what
[1:42:37] he knows what you can bear
[1:42:39] but more importantly he knows what
[1:42:40] you're supposed to do and he'll put you
[1:42:42] where you can and then when you have
[1:42:43] confidence in that then it doesn't
[1:42:44] matter what comes your way you know
[1:42:46] you're not going to bend you're not
[1:42:47] going to break you're not going to fail
[1:42:48] because it's him that's doing the work
[1:42:49] not you amen
[1:42:51] amen you can start out a leader in your
[1:42:53] head and you can end up a janitor in the
[1:42:54] church and that's exactly where god
[1:42:55] wanted you to be
[1:42:57] amen amen and then when i say destroy us
[1:42:59] i don't mean to send us to hell but it
[1:43:00] would break our spirit and then to the
[1:43:02] point where we just have to sit in the
[1:43:03] church and do nothing because we've what
[1:43:05] we've been broken we went too fast we
[1:43:07] got ahead of god and and that that
[1:43:10] it can cause a breaking in our spirit it
[1:43:11] can cause
[1:43:12] mental distress it can cause these
[1:43:14] different things and all of a sudden
[1:43:15] something snaps and you can't do
[1:43:16] anything anymore amen
[1:43:18] amen
[1:43:19] so we don't need leaders what the church
[1:43:20] needs are people that are led by the
[1:43:22] holy spirit amen not led by a pastor not
[1:43:25] led by deacons not led by men not led by
[1:43:27] women but that are led by the holy
[1:43:29] spirit that's what we're looking for
[1:43:31] remember is a body that works
[1:43:32] effectively together that's we're
[1:43:34] talking about growing into a place of
[1:43:35] being effective in the body amen what
[1:43:38] the people need what the church needs is
[1:43:39] people that are under the influence of
[1:43:41] the holy spirit
[1:43:42] not the influence just because you
[1:43:44] attended the service but under the
[1:43:45] influence because that's what's inside
[1:43:46] of you in the first place amen you don't
[1:43:48] come to church to get leadership
[1:43:50] you've got leadership in you all the
[1:43:51] time if you've got the holy spirit and
[1:43:53] then you've got healing you've got
[1:43:54] deliverance you've got direction all of
[1:43:55] these things are with you all the time
[1:43:57] and you need to be recognizing that and
[1:43:59] know that you're under the influence of
[1:44:00] that amen what the church needs is
[1:44:02] people that are submitted to christ amen
[1:44:04] in every part of their lives so that god
[1:44:06] can use them to initiate things
[1:44:08] if you look at this brother joe let's
[1:44:09] talk about this a number of times how
[1:44:10] many things has brother mark initiated
[1:44:12] in this church
[1:44:13] he's not the pastor
[1:44:15] but the holy spirit has used him to do
[1:44:17] things
[1:44:18] amen and you'll look in this church and
[1:44:19] you'll see things happen right and
[1:44:21] you'll see you know we've got paul and
[1:44:23] kim and they're doing things with young
[1:44:24] people who told paul and kim to do that
[1:44:27] did brother jared tell him but gerald i
[1:44:28] don't think you told him to go camping
[1:44:30] this weekend i don't think you told him
[1:44:31] to go out and have you know fun days
[1:44:33] outside and these different things what
[1:44:34] is it the holy spirit working in the
[1:44:36] body doing what initiating things for
[1:44:39] the health of the body right pastor
[1:44:41] didn't have to do that
[1:44:42] amen and so it's like that all the time
[1:44:44] you'll see people they'll just have a
[1:44:45] little initiative because why the holy
[1:44:46] spirit told him to do it
[1:44:48] and the proof of it is that what it
[1:44:50] brings forth fruit according to the word
[1:44:52] of god
[1:44:53] and what have we seen we've seen
[1:44:54] baptisms of young people lately what is
[1:44:57] it it's an effective youth group that's
[1:44:58] working to meet the needs mixed in with
[1:45:00] what a five-fold ministry and families
[1:45:02] that are raising their kids according to
[1:45:04] the word of god it's what the body
[1:45:06] working together to achieve what new
[1:45:08] births
[1:45:09] amen amen amen
[1:45:13] amen what paul's reminding us of in that
[1:45:15] scripture is that every part every
[1:45:17] person in the body has to be working
[1:45:19] effectively in order for us to make a
[1:45:20] rapture and then we're going to be
[1:45:22] pulling together scripture talks about
[1:45:23] remember if you have a couple sticks you
[1:45:25] can break them easily but you bind a
[1:45:26] bunch of sticks together and try and
[1:45:28] break the group you can't do it when
[1:45:29] we're working together when we're
[1:45:30] working effectively according to a
[1:45:32] common purpose according to the one
[1:45:34] spirit that baptizes into that body then
[1:45:36] we can achieve things that we could
[1:45:37] never achieve on our own
[1:45:39] amen
[1:45:40] amen like i talked about last time you
[1:45:42] can have the world's strongest heart but
[1:45:43] if you don't have the veins if you don't
[1:45:45] have the arteries to take blood away to
[1:45:47] bring it back if you don't have the
[1:45:48] capillaries that take it all the way to
[1:45:49] the smallest portion of your body what
[1:45:51] happens is that body rots because it's
[1:45:52] not getting fresh blood and oxygen and
[1:45:54] you'll get gangrene set in i mean it
[1:45:56] doesn't matter big or small it's all
[1:45:58] necessary as part of the body
[1:46:00] amen paul continues he says this i say
[1:46:03] therefore and testify in the lord that
[1:46:05] ye henceforth walk not as other gentiles
[1:46:07] walk in the vanity of their mind
[1:46:10] amen that's how you know that somebody's
[1:46:11] living outside of the word is that
[1:46:12] they're going by what they think rather
[1:46:14] than what god said in the word
[1:46:16] amen
[1:46:17] the greatest tell of this is usually
[1:46:18] phrased as not i think but i feel
[1:46:22] i feel
[1:46:23] i don't care what you feel
[1:46:25] what does the word say
[1:46:27] right don't feel it don't think it point
[1:46:29] you to the word point to the word and
[1:46:31] that's how you know that you're going to
[1:46:32] be right and then they're governed by
[1:46:34] the changing thoughts of society they're
[1:46:35] controlled by their emotions and they're
[1:46:37] influenced by their own desires
[1:46:39] amen the way thereof is death amen verse
[1:46:41] 18 having the understanding darkened
[1:46:43] being alienated from the life of god
[1:46:46] now notice they're contrasted with us in
[1:46:48] that they are alienated from the life of
[1:46:49] god but we are not because why we have
[1:46:51] the holy spirit within us
[1:46:53] and they're alienated through the
[1:46:55] ignorance that is in them because of the
[1:46:56] blindness of their heart
[1:46:58] who being past feeling have given
[1:47:00] themselves over unto lasciviousness
[1:47:03] that sexual or sensual desires and if
[1:47:05] you look at the the original sin you
[1:47:07] look at eve what did it lead her to
[1:47:08] lasheviousness
[1:47:10] amen and that caused the downfall of the
[1:47:12] entire earth
[1:47:13] amen given themselves over onto
[1:47:15] lasciviousness to work all uncleanness
[1:47:17] with greediness but ye have not so
[1:47:19] learned christ
[1:47:21] not a pretty picture paul paints here is
[1:47:22] it and then he's saying look if god's
[1:47:24] working in your life you're going to see
[1:47:25] a couple things and verse 14 he says you
[1:47:28] won't act as a child and then you won't
[1:47:30] be self-centered you won't be focused on
[1:47:32] your own viewpoints amen remember we
[1:47:34] read last time that you won't be tied to
[1:47:35] ministries that was what paul said to
[1:47:37] find them as children was that one said
[1:47:39] i'm a paul and why i'm of apollos and
[1:47:41] i'm of this one and i'm of that when he
[1:47:42] says that is childish and that's the
[1:47:44] reason why i can't teach you higher
[1:47:46] things is because you're still stuck on
[1:47:47] men you're stuck on who brought you in
[1:47:49] rather than what the one that gave him
[1:47:51] the word that brought you in in the
[1:47:52] first place amen and we've seen that in
[1:47:54] spades in the message whether it's lee
[1:47:55] vale whether it's joseph branham these
[1:47:56] different ones you have camps that have
[1:47:58] developed around men and what happened
[1:48:00] they've gotten cold starchy formal and
[1:48:03] generally in most those churches they
[1:48:04] have no youth in them anymore the church
[1:48:06] has failed and it's just a dead group
[1:48:08] now
[1:48:09] right bunch of old soldiers that's what
[1:48:11] happens
[1:48:12] why because they've taken a man's
[1:48:13] ministry over their own amen now you say
[1:48:16] brother i'm not tied to a ministry well
[1:48:18] some of us are tied to old ministries
[1:48:20] some of us are tied to tied to the one
[1:48:21] that we used to have rather than the one
[1:48:23] we have now
[1:48:24] listen
[1:48:25] can you imagine if everybody only wanted
[1:48:27] brother gerald behind this pulpit what's
[1:48:29] the point of me being here
[1:48:31] right if we're tied to a man
[1:48:33] i'm of no use and i might as well sit
[1:48:35] down i'm wasting my time and i'm wasting
[1:48:37] yours right i can go get gray hair some
[1:48:39] other way
[1:48:40] right why we're tied to what old pastors
[1:48:44] right you're tied to ministries and
[1:48:45] other churches in some places right what
[1:48:47] is it you say well that man's got a
[1:48:49] greater gift to my pastor so i i really
[1:48:51] wish i could have him
[1:48:52] what is it you're not focused on what
[1:48:54] god has in front of you and god can't
[1:48:55] bless you because you're where you're
[1:48:57] supposed to be if you're aware god's if
[1:48:59] you're where you're supposed to be god's
[1:49:01] put the man there to take care of you
[1:49:02] right and if you're around looking at
[1:49:04] everybody else but that man you'll never
[1:49:05] get the blessing that you're going to
[1:49:06] have by being a part of the local body
[1:49:08] because your body's here but your spirit
[1:49:09] is someplace else and you're trying to
[1:49:10] feed on somebody else on a regular basis
[1:49:12] amen again this isn't about don't listen
[1:49:14] to other ministries no not at all but if
[1:49:17] you're tied to that man then it's going
[1:49:19] to hinder your walk because you're so
[1:49:20] focused on what he has and what he does
[1:49:22] and how high he is or what his great
[1:49:24] gift is to this and the other thing and
[1:49:25] you'll get nothing out of the local body
[1:49:27] and you'll actually be of no use to the
[1:49:28] local body believe it or not because
[1:49:30] like i said your heart's in another
[1:49:31] place amen
[1:49:32] and whether we realize it or not every
[1:49:34] minister will make a mistake in doctrine
[1:49:37] sometimes if only by omission
[1:49:39] right when i'm preaching i may say
[1:49:41] something and you'll say
[1:49:43] that's right but it's not quite right
[1:49:45] but listen if i sat here and went
[1:49:46] through every point of doctrine as i'm
[1:49:48] preaching here we'd have some really
[1:49:49] long services so what is it i'm i'm
[1:49:51] focusing on a certain area and i'll say
[1:49:53] something and that's all i'm going to
[1:49:54] say about it i'm not going to give you
[1:49:55] the the full truth i'm just going to
[1:49:57] give you an element of that truth as it
[1:49:58] relates to what we're preaching on that
[1:49:59] morning amen but if we sit here with
[1:50:01] critical spirits we'll say well he's off
[1:50:02] the word
[1:50:03] how many times have we heard somebody
[1:50:05] say that brother's off the word he's not
[1:50:06] off the word you just listen to one
[1:50:08] portion of one service rather than
[1:50:09] sitting under the ministry and seeing
[1:50:10] what he really thinks but it was enough
[1:50:12] to justify you in not attending or not
[1:50:14] listening or not doing anything
[1:50:16] different than what you're doing right
[1:50:17] now
[1:50:18] amen
[1:50:19] brother branham himself made documented
[1:50:21] mistakes on doctrine that he had to do
[1:50:22] what correct later
[1:50:25] why progressive revelation he's growing
[1:50:27] in christ
[1:50:29] amen he's coming out from a baptist
[1:50:31] church
[1:50:32] right he's been taught certain things
[1:50:33] throughout his life and he had to come
[1:50:34] to a place where he had did what
[1:50:36] sometimes it was that he didn't go far
[1:50:38] enough
[1:50:39] and that's other times it was that he
[1:50:40] didn't go he went too far and then but
[1:50:42] he'd say things at certain times and say
[1:50:43] the greatest weapon is this they say the
[1:50:45] greatest weapon is that they'd say the
[1:50:46] proof of the holy ghost is this and
[1:50:47] they'd say the proof of the holy ghost
[1:50:48] is that
[1:50:50] what is it
[1:50:51] if you treat them all as absolute
[1:50:52] statements he's wrong but he's growing
[1:50:54] he's growing in grace he's growing in
[1:50:55] his understanding amen
[1:50:58] so the man is going to fail every time
[1:51:01] he's going to fail every time in that
[1:51:02] he's not going to have everything he's
[1:51:04] not going to have the full knowledge of
[1:51:05] the word of god the minute he becomes a
[1:51:06] minister right i can tell you that
[1:51:09] and if that's required then i'm not a
[1:51:11] minister because i don't know it all
[1:51:13] feels good to say that
[1:51:15] they say admission is the is the first
[1:51:17] step right no but i don't know
[1:51:19] everything but the jail do you know
[1:51:21] everything
[1:51:22] so there you go two failed ministers
[1:51:25] amen
[1:51:28] remember brother jim dooley talked about
[1:51:30] this on wednesday said most
[1:51:31] disagreements between people are just
[1:51:32] misunderstandings or miscommunication
[1:51:34] not actual disagreements on the word of
[1:51:36] god what i found is that most people say
[1:51:38] think you're wrong because you didn't
[1:51:40] say it the way their pastor said it
[1:51:42] or else they get into a quote battle
[1:51:43] with you amen and they leave the
[1:51:44] scripture out of it entirely and it's
[1:51:46] quotes quotes quotes and they don't pull
[1:51:47] it through the scripture and then if we
[1:51:49] can go back to the word of god that's
[1:51:50] our absolute and then the word of god
[1:51:53] the message is not our absolute in that
[1:51:54] the words that brother braham spoke or
[1:51:56] not are absolute how can they be amen
[1:51:59] it's documented with mistakes how can it
[1:52:01] be our absolute himself said it you know
[1:52:03] moses brought them into the ark seven
[1:52:05] hundred versus seven thousand all these
[1:52:06] different things it's not the absolute
[1:52:08] brother branham said that
[1:52:10] he says oh brother that still remains
[1:52:11] the truth that the word that unmovable
[1:52:14] word of the living god is still the
[1:52:15] truth it's my absolute what it says is
[1:52:18] the truth to me that's the foundation
[1:52:20] word that's where the cornerstone is i
[1:52:21] don't want to shift with no denomination
[1:52:24] he says god never did have two heads to
[1:52:26] his church he never did it's one head he
[1:52:28] always dealt in every generation as we
[1:52:30] studied through the scriptures there's
[1:52:31] always one individual that he deals with
[1:52:33] because you get two men you get two
[1:52:35] opinions
[1:52:36] but it's got to come to one final
[1:52:37] absolute and my absolute is the word the
[1:52:40] bible
[1:52:41] so you can't have quote battles because
[1:52:43] that's not the absolute
[1:52:45] and as the pastor here as a pastor here
[1:52:47] of the church my absolute is the word i
[1:52:49] know you our brothers you kind of look
[1:52:51] to me to be your absolute
[1:52:53] as long as i follow god as paul said in
[1:52:55] the scripture you follow me
[1:52:57] as i follow christ
[1:52:59] amen
[1:53:00] so if he points us back to the word of
[1:53:01] god that ought to be our absolute as
[1:53:03] well amen
[1:53:06] i remember having late nights of
[1:53:08] fellowship with brother gerald after he
[1:53:09] preached something and we go over the
[1:53:10] next week remember those brother joel
[1:53:12] and sometimes up until two in the
[1:53:13] morning and blank and i'd sit there and
[1:53:14] we'd ask questions and say brother joe
[1:53:16] did you mean this where did you mean
[1:53:17] that he'd say no brother what made you
[1:53:20] think that
[1:53:21] and we talked to him we get clarity on
[1:53:23] something that he said that we felt was
[1:53:25] maybe a little higher a little hard for
[1:53:26] us
[1:53:27] you know
[1:53:28] being young as well a lot of times that
[1:53:30] the standard is high for a young a young
[1:53:32] christian you know but just to say
[1:53:34] brother is this really what you meant or
[1:53:35] was it you being brief and just hitting
[1:53:37] the high points and then you know
[1:53:39] whatever but we could have sat there and
[1:53:40] got upset
[1:53:42] got depressed because we couldn't meet
[1:53:43] the standard or we could go over and we
[1:53:45] can ask them ourselves amen what is it
[1:53:47] to take away that
[1:53:48] miscommunication to take away that that
[1:53:50] that thought that i put there of what he
[1:53:53] meant and just ask him say what do you
[1:53:54] mean and guess what clarity came and we
[1:53:56] had a wonderful time
[1:53:57] and then we enjoyed our nights of
[1:53:58] fellowship with them amen
[1:54:01] so remember
[1:54:02] we wouldn't act as children paul says
[1:54:04] the next thing is that you won't be
[1:54:05] swayed by the influence of people and
[1:54:07] then you'll stick with the word of god
[1:54:08] you'll look to the word for inspiration
[1:54:10] and you will look to the word for
[1:54:11] guidance and you will look to the word
[1:54:13] for your foundation
[1:54:14] you can't look to the world for any of
[1:54:17] these things and you can't look to the
[1:54:18] world and find anything that will help
[1:54:20] you in your walk with god there is
[1:54:21] nothing in satan's edom that will ever
[1:54:24] draw you closer to god nothing
[1:54:27] nothing nothing nothing like i said
[1:54:29] before if it's 99 truth and one percent
[1:54:32] wrong it's a denomination it's man's
[1:54:34] thought it's not god's thoughts and how
[1:54:36] are you going to feed on something
[1:54:37] that's going to bring you eternal value
[1:54:39] if it is not eternal itself amen you got
[1:54:41] to take it back to the word of god
[1:54:43] paul says this in corinth second
[1:54:45] corinthians he says be not unequally
[1:54:47] yoked together with unbelievers for what
[1:54:49] fellowship hath righteousness with
[1:54:50] unrighteousness and what communion had
[1:54:52] light with darkness now unequally yoke
[1:54:54] means you're seeking to partner up to
[1:54:56] find common ground to find similarity
[1:54:58] with someone or something that doesn't
[1:54:59] have the same absolute
[1:55:02] why would you try that
[1:55:04] and then we testify and we witness to
[1:55:06] people but we're not seeking to become
[1:55:08] bosom buddies with people or with
[1:55:10] doctrines or with ministries that are
[1:55:12] outside the reveal word of the hour why
[1:55:14] would you do it it says for what concord
[1:55:16] have christ with belial in other words
[1:55:18] what what what agreement does god have
[1:55:20] with the devil
[1:55:21] or what part have he that believeth with
[1:55:23] an infidel with somebody that doesn't
[1:55:25] believe
[1:55:25] how are you going to get a connection
[1:55:26] with somebody that doesn't believe
[1:55:28] there's no connection to be made you
[1:55:30] witness you testify and then you move on
[1:55:31] if they reject it you can't have a close
[1:55:33] relationship with somebody that isn't on
[1:55:35] the same absolute same foundation you're
[1:55:36] on
[1:55:37] and what agreement had the temple of god
[1:55:39] with idols for ye are the temple of the
[1:55:41] living god as god has said i will dwell
[1:55:43] in them and walk in them and i will be
[1:55:44] their god and they shall be my people
[1:55:47] wherefore come out from among them and
[1:55:49] be separate saith the lord and touch not
[1:55:51] the unclean thing and i will receive you
[1:55:54] and will be a father unto you and i you
[1:55:56] shall be my sons and daughters saith the
[1:55:58] lord
[1:55:59] almighty
[1:56:00] amen i'm not saying you can't learn
[1:56:02] something from a denominational person
[1:56:04] some of them have dealt pretty deeply
[1:56:05] into certain topics and you know what
[1:56:07] they're good
[1:56:09] you can be corrected by a donkey you
[1:56:10] know balaam was
[1:56:12] right god can use anybody to correct you
[1:56:14] to do things but you're not up there to
[1:56:16] feed on it we're not out there to take
[1:56:17] that into our homes we're not out there
[1:56:18] to take that into our minds because what
[1:56:20] that means is you got to be really well
[1:56:22] versed in the word of god to run the run
[1:56:24] as tight of filters you need to make
[1:56:25] sure that that one word doesn't get
[1:56:27] through that takes the truth and twists
[1:56:29] it into what a denomination in your head
[1:56:31] because what's going to happen is the
[1:56:32] more you feed on that then all of a
[1:56:33] sudden you start to question what is
[1:56:35] vindicated you start to question what is
[1:56:37] an absolute because satan's got an
[1:56:38] avenue that you've opened up to him into
[1:56:40] your mind into your life into your
[1:56:42] influences and all of a sudden you're
[1:56:44] fighting against the word now instead of
[1:56:45] fighting against what you brought into
[1:56:46] your life and it'll twist your thinking
[1:56:48] amen i'm not saying don't read anything
[1:56:50] else brother gerald's got commentaries
[1:56:52] in there brother branham had
[1:56:53] commentaries but guess what brother
[1:56:54] brown went to preach the seals based on
[1:56:56] those commentaries and what happened the
[1:56:57] angel still had to correct him amen
[1:57:00] because why it wasn't the inspired and
[1:57:01] anointed word it was just people putting
[1:57:03] down their thoughts based on what they
[1:57:05] thought right based on hours of study
[1:57:08] years of study but it wasn't the truth
[1:57:09] and the angel had to come in and correct
[1:57:11] him amen
[1:57:12] amen
[1:57:14] it's hard that's hard preaching
[1:57:16] but it's the truth you're not going to
[1:57:18] get anything of eternal value out of the
[1:57:19] world
[1:57:20] and i say that to include the
[1:57:21] denominations amen you look in
[1:57:23] revelations 3 it says he stands on the
[1:57:25] standing on the outside knocking to get
[1:57:26] in
[1:57:27] amen they're not even worshipping him
[1:57:29] they're not even worshipping him he's on
[1:57:31] the outside knocking on the individual
[1:57:32] hearts of people because the church has
[1:57:34] put him out
[1:57:35] so if they're not worshiping christ
[1:57:36] there's only one thing left that's
[1:57:38] antichrist because outside of christ
[1:57:40] everything is antichrist it's not him
[1:57:42] right and it's against him and that'll
[1:57:43] tell you where the influence is amen
[1:57:47] third thing that paul pain says he says
[1:57:48] you'll find your body
[1:57:50] your place in the body of christ and
[1:57:52] then that means you'll be integrated
[1:57:53] with other believers
[1:57:54] brother paul haley i've mentioned this
[1:57:56] before he once spoke at our church in bc
[1:57:58] and he said something that really stuck
[1:57:59] with me and he said there's only one
[1:58:00] name one description for a sheep by
[1:58:02] itself in the scripture and that
[1:58:04] description is lost and then sheep are
[1:58:06] not meant to be alone
[1:58:08] they're a herd animal they're supposed
[1:58:10] to be in a flock and it's for their
[1:58:12] protection and it's for the benefit of
[1:58:14] themselves as well as a shepherd that's
[1:58:16] that's taking care of them amen so it
[1:58:17] means you're going to have a post of
[1:58:18] duty it means you're going to have
[1:58:19] responsibility you're going to be around
[1:58:21] people that you shape and you're going
[1:58:22] to be around people that shape you hey
[1:58:24] man it's going to be a harder thing than
[1:58:25] if you're on off by yourself and as i
[1:58:27] said before if you stay off by yourself
[1:58:29] you'll get to the point where nobody can
[1:58:30] correct you not even the word itself and
[1:58:32] you'll become a shell of what you used
[1:58:34] to be amen amen what i found is that god
[1:58:37] gives us a body so that we can see the
[1:58:39] blind spots that we wouldn't see
[1:58:40] otherwise amen and sometimes it's
[1:58:42] through just seeing the life of somebody
[1:58:43] else that's got that portion of their
[1:58:45] life
[1:58:46] it's fully surrendered to christ where
[1:58:47] you can look at somebody that trusts god
[1:58:49] completely for their finances you can
[1:58:51] look at another man say wow he's really
[1:58:52] got this fatherhood or husbandry thing
[1:58:54] down or you look at another wife or
[1:58:56] mother and say wow that's great i can do
[1:58:58] better amen lord help me to do that i'm
[1:59:00] not even close to doing that amen that's
[1:59:02] what happened to me in dallas was i went
[1:59:03] down and i saw young men serving the
[1:59:05] lord in a way that i could have only
[1:59:06] imagined right and it opens it up why
[1:59:08] because they're all a part of the body
[1:59:09] of christ not just this body it's the
[1:59:11] global body amen it's the it's the the
[1:59:13] entire body of christ amen
[1:59:15] amen
[1:59:17] amen it doesn't say that you're not a
[1:59:18] sheep the bible doesn't say
[1:59:21] that because you're lost you're not a
[1:59:22] sheep just says you're a lost sheep
[1:59:24] you're still a sheep
[1:59:25] but you're lost so come back to the
[1:59:27] flock come back to the place where you
[1:59:28] can be fed amen if you look at sheep and
[1:59:30] nature
[1:59:33] you see these are bighorn sheep do you
[1:59:34] notice how they're all looking in
[1:59:35] different directions
[1:59:37] i've hunted sheep
[1:59:38] you can't get anywhere near a sheep
[1:59:40] that's why you got to have a long shot
[1:59:42] with a rifle is because they stay in
[1:59:44] groups and every one of them will face
[1:59:46] in different directions and if you look
[1:59:48] over here you'll see look
[1:59:50] this one's looking here this one's
[1:59:52] looking here that one's there that one's
[1:59:53] there that one's there that one's there
[1:59:54] that one's there that one's there
[1:59:56] they're looking in all different
[1:59:57] directions how are you going to sneak up
[1:59:58] on on a bunch of sheep that are looking
[2:00:00] out for each other right what they're
[2:00:01] doing is they're using their numbers to
[2:00:03] the benefit to watch out for each other
[2:00:05] to make sure that one of them doesn't
[2:00:06] get taken by a predator
[2:00:08] amen
[2:00:08] they're going to see you coming every
[2:00:10] time up there and they will and the
[2:00:11] thing is they can see from a mile away
[2:00:13] you can see from a mile away because of
[2:00:14] what in the body it's because of
[2:00:16] experience
[2:00:17] experience allows you to see something
[2:00:19] in its infancy
[2:00:20] right before it can grow into something
[2:00:22] that's a problem that's why we rely on
[2:00:24] our elders for certain things that we
[2:00:25] can't rely on our young men for us
[2:00:26] because they have the experience to see
[2:00:28] something coming in its infancy and root
[2:00:31] it out before it has a start amen
[2:00:33] and then sometimes and this is just my
[2:00:35] opinion this is just saith jonathan god
[2:00:37] gives you a pastor so that you can't
[2:00:39] turn the tape off
[2:00:42] if you're sitting at home streaming if
[2:00:43] you're there listening to a tape when it
[2:00:45] gets uncomfortable
[2:00:46] what do you do
[2:00:48] turn it off or you can skip forward or
[2:00:50] you can just leave it right
[2:00:52] but when you're here you're a captive
[2:00:54] audience
[2:00:56] whether you like it or not you're a
[2:00:57] captive audience and god will speak to
[2:00:59] you and he'll give you what you need and
[2:01:01] you don't get to leave until the service
[2:01:03] is over unless you're really rude and
[2:01:04] none of us are really rude so we stay
[2:01:06] here don't we what is it a captive
[2:01:08] audience to hear the word of the lord
[2:01:09] whether you like it or not
[2:01:11] amen why because he's trying to do what
[2:01:13] grow us into a rapture grow us into a
[2:01:16] condition that he can use us grow us
[2:01:17] into a place where we can be fully
[2:01:19] effective for his kingdom purpose amen
[2:01:21] if you aren't getting a little bit
[2:01:22] uncomfortable in church on a regular
[2:01:24] basis i'd say there's something wrong
[2:01:27] amen can we say amen to that if you're
[2:01:29] not being uncomfortable in church on a
[2:01:31] regular basis something's wrong because
[2:01:32] what growth is uncomfortable
[2:01:35] then i remember when i was young and i
[2:01:36] get growing planes in my in my shins and
[2:01:38] my legs it was it hurt a lot what is it
[2:01:41] i was growing and it was causing my body
[2:01:43] pain or if you go into the gym
[2:01:46] right and you're trying to build up your
[2:01:47] strength guess what it hurts doesn't it
[2:01:49] for the next two or three days after you
[2:01:50] work out it hurts
[2:01:52] why because you're growing because
[2:01:54] you're going through something there's a
[2:01:56] change that's happening and change is
[2:01:58] always painful i mean it causes
[2:02:00] discomfort every single time and then so
[2:02:03] if you're coming through your challenges
[2:02:04] feeling fresh as a daisy chances are it
[2:02:06] wasn't actually a challenge you think
[2:02:08] it's a challenge you know if i if i tell
[2:02:10] jensen to come up here and lift my bible
[2:02:13] that's not a challenge for jensen but if
[2:02:15] he says it's a challenge and thinks it's
[2:02:16] a challenge that doesn't make it a
[2:02:18] challenge amen he can lift a three-pound
[2:02:19] bible over his head no problem but if i
[2:02:21] put 50 pounds down there and he tries to
[2:02:23] lift it now that's a challenge and he's
[2:02:25] going to come through on the other side
[2:02:26] of that if he can lift it feeling tired
[2:02:28] and he's going to be sore tomorrow god
[2:02:29] doesn't give us challenges that leave us
[2:02:31] sitting there fresh as a daisy we come
[2:02:33] through it and we're like whoo
[2:02:35] i need a breather yeah right and what it
[2:02:38] is is lord i need more of you is usually
[2:02:40] what it is that's when you know that
[2:02:42] you're reading through your challenges
[2:02:43] when you say god i need more of you
[2:02:45] rather than i've got enough and i don't
[2:02:47] need any more
[2:02:48] and then let me say that again if you
[2:02:49] come through it satisfied with what you
[2:02:51] have rather than saying i need more you
[2:02:52] didn't go through a challenge at all
[2:02:54] amen
[2:02:56] it's a struggle it's a battle it's a
[2:02:57] fight
[2:02:58] amen and we can we can be pulled away
[2:03:01] from that listen to what paul says as
[2:03:02] we're almost done here he says let no
[2:03:05] man beguile you of your reward in a
[2:03:07] voluntary humility and worshiping of
[2:03:09] angels
[2:03:11] in other words this means don't let men
[2:03:13] act as a mediator between you and god
[2:03:15] telling you that you are unworthy
[2:03:17] or worthy
[2:03:19] and getting you to focus on so-called
[2:03:20] supernatural experiences that they have
[2:03:22] had or getting you to seek the same
[2:03:24] thing that they have rather than take
[2:03:27] your place in the body of christ
[2:03:29] that's a lot of words for that let no
[2:03:30] man beguile you that's what it means is
[2:03:32] that they have or they profess to have
[2:03:34] all these supernatural experiences they
[2:03:36] say you got to have what i have guess
[2:03:38] what we don't all get angels in our life
[2:03:39] we don't all get visions and dreams we
[2:03:41] don't all have supernatural things and
[2:03:43] see things flashing here and that and
[2:03:44] have discernment for this brother or
[2:03:46] this sister no no no no
[2:03:48] no brother brown says those gifts are
[2:03:50] there and he can pull them off and use
[2:03:51] any one of us at any given time for but
[2:03:53] we don't sit there and all have that all
[2:03:54] the time very few people have that and
[2:03:57] you saw it on brother brown's like
[2:03:58] because it'll take the it'll drain you
[2:04:00] mentally and it'll drain you physically
[2:04:01] if you're in a supernatural experience
[2:04:02] all the time so normally the people that
[2:04:04] have that don't actually have it and
[2:04:06] what they're trying to do is they're
[2:04:07] trying to put themselves into a higher
[2:04:08] spiritual plane than you for influence
[2:04:11] and to make themselves look like they're
[2:04:12] something that they're not amen that's
[2:04:14] what paul's saying don't let don't get
[2:04:16] sucked into trying to be like another
[2:04:17] man don't get sucked into trying to be
[2:04:19] like a woman look to the what word look
[2:04:21] to the standard of the word and say what
[2:04:23] does that say i'm supposed to be what
[2:04:24] does that say i'm supposed to do how am
[2:04:26] i supposed to look how am i supposed to
[2:04:28] live and then i'll focus on that and the
[2:04:29] holy spirit will quicken that to me way
[2:04:31] more than it's going to quite can some
[2:04:32] man or some woman come to me saying you
[2:04:34] need to live your life the way i live my
[2:04:35] life amen we raise them to the word
[2:04:37] standard not to our own standard amen we
[2:04:40] must all live by the word but we all
[2:04:42] live different lives you look around we
[2:04:43] don't all live the same way we don't
[2:04:45] have the same marriages we don't have
[2:04:46] the same jobs we don't have the same
[2:04:47] finances we don't drive the same cars we
[2:04:49] don't wear the same clothes in church we
[2:04:51] don't wear the same clothes out of
[2:04:52] church we do our hair different way
[2:04:53] right different glasses
[2:04:55] right our kids act different ways based
[2:04:57] on our standard discipline what we all
[2:04:59] have different ways of raising people
[2:05:01] but where the word is in absolute we
[2:05:02] need to be absolute but where it's gray
[2:05:03] we have to have grace for the person
[2:05:05] next to us and say lord i'm trusting you
[2:05:06] to lead them and i'll focus on leading
[2:05:08] me amen
[2:05:09] on him leading me not me leading me amen
[2:05:13] how do you get like this how do you get
[2:05:14] where somebody uh let me continue it
[2:05:17] says
[2:05:18] yeah intruding into those things which
[2:05:20] he had not seen vainly popped up in his
[2:05:22] fleshly mind that means they're
[2:05:23] pretending to have seen and done things
[2:05:25] and that it was never of god it was
[2:05:28] sometimes it was supernatural but it
[2:05:30] wasn't god but they think it was amen
[2:05:32] they'd have to take it back to the word
[2:05:34] these men get there this way it says by
[2:05:36] not holding the head from which all the
[2:05:38] body by joints and bands having
[2:05:39] nourishment ministered and knit together
[2:05:41] increases with the increase of god
[2:05:43] notice that increases with the increase
[2:05:45] of god
[2:05:47] then it's going to have word fruits it's
[2:05:48] going to have new births it's going to
[2:05:50] have the holy ghost amen not just what
[2:05:52] legalism not just everybody looking the
[2:05:55] way the pastor does or his wife does but
[2:05:57] you're going to have what new burst
[2:05:58] where the holy spirit is leading and
[2:05:59] initiating and moving within a body amen
[2:06:02] each one it says
[2:06:03] the amplified not holding fast to the
[2:06:05] head from whom the whole entire body
[2:06:06] supplied in it together by means of its
[2:06:08] joints and ligaments grows with a growth
[2:06:10] that is from god
[2:06:12] amen you can't argue with growth
[2:06:14] right long-term growth not short-term
[2:06:16] growth right you can feed on the things
[2:06:18] uh you can feed on you know there's
[2:06:20] feel-good uh ministries and you can feel
[2:06:22] on you know word of faith and these
[2:06:23] different things and you'll see some
[2:06:24] growth
[2:06:25] and then the pin will touch you and
[2:06:27] you'll just it's like steroids right you
[2:06:29] got to keep taking them to look like
[2:06:31] you're doing anything but the minute you
[2:06:32] stop taking them your growth goes away
[2:06:34] and you can never look the way you did
[2:06:35] before and then we all have to line up
[2:06:37] with the word remember we want to grow
[2:06:39] in grace with growth that is from god
[2:06:41] not try and supercharge ourselves
[2:06:43] through things that aren't vindicated
[2:06:44] amen
[2:06:46] so if they didn't hold fast to the to
[2:06:47] the head which is christ the question is
[2:06:49] what are we holding fast to what is it
[2:06:51] that's driving us day to day
[2:06:54] what is it that you can say this is what
[2:06:55] drove me this week this is what led me
[2:06:58] this week this is what brought me to do
[2:06:59] the things i did this week
[2:07:02] it says you have to hold fast to christ
[2:07:03] because if you don't you're going to
[2:07:04] start what creating things in your head
[2:07:06] that make you look spiritual and you're
[2:07:08] going to try and put that on somebody
[2:07:09] else and make them do the same thing
[2:07:10] that you're doing so that you feel good
[2:07:12] about where you are with god and you're
[2:07:13] actually going to end up leading them
[2:07:14] off of the word amen
[2:07:16] how do you know what you're holding to i
[2:07:18] just ask you what you're holding to how
[2:07:19] can you tell
[2:07:20] how can you go back in your week and say
[2:07:22] what was i holding to this week what'd
[2:07:23] you feed on
[2:07:25] what did you go to when you had a need
[2:07:27] that'll tell you what you're holding to
[2:07:29] amen what did you go to when you had a
[2:07:30] question
[2:07:31] amen did you go to youtube or did you go
[2:07:34] to the word of god
[2:07:35] did you go to some secular book or did
[2:07:37] you go to the word of god
[2:07:38] and then did you go into your prayer
[2:07:40] closet or did you go talk to somebody
[2:07:42] else
[2:07:44] what are you holding to
[2:07:46] amen
[2:07:48] or were you just tickling your ears
[2:07:52] if you're holding to christ you're going
[2:07:53] to feel growing pains if you're tickling
[2:07:55] your ears you're just going to feel
[2:07:56] comfortable where you are
[2:07:58] right so if you're holding the christ
[2:07:59] you'll feel growth you'll feel the
[2:08:01] struggle you'll feel the trials if
[2:08:02] you're holding to something else then
[2:08:03] all you're going to get is what tickling
[2:08:05] ears and you're going to feel good about
[2:08:06] yourself but nothing's actually going to
[2:08:07] be changing in your life
[2:08:09] so the other thing is this how do you
[2:08:10] know then it's christ that's leading you
[2:08:11] say well i believe christ is leading me
[2:08:13] how do you know christ is leading you
[2:08:15] it's a great question we've got a lot of
[2:08:16] people out there in the world that are
[2:08:18] professing to be christians and you'd
[2:08:19] say is christ leading you well the first
[2:08:22] thing i'll say is this you know it's
[2:08:23] christ when the focus is on you rather
[2:08:24] than other people
[2:08:26] amen because what the word is like to my
[2:08:28] path amen right it's a lamp to my feet
[2:08:31] amen amen so i'm focused the word is
[2:08:33] focusing on my path my feet what i'm
[2:08:36] doing where i'm falling short amen the
[2:08:37] word is a mirror for me rather than a
[2:08:40] scope on somebody else
[2:08:41] amen when the word is a mirror on me
[2:08:44] then i know that christ is leading me
[2:08:46] because if i'm using it as a scope a
[2:08:47] scope is on a rifle that's been used to
[2:08:48] destroy or kill other people and then so
[2:08:51] when it's focused on me rather than
[2:08:52] somebody else then i know that god is
[2:08:53] leading me amen see the mirror doesn't
[2:08:55] lie
[2:08:57] i can think i'm good looking i can think
[2:08:59] i've got a great hairstyle that i'm not
[2:09:01] going gray that my skin isn't becoming
[2:09:02] wrinkled that i'm not losing you know an
[2:09:04] eighth of an inch a year because i'm
[2:09:06] getting older you know that the love
[2:09:07] handles aren't starting to come in but
[2:09:09] if i look in the mirror the mirror
[2:09:10] doesn't line the good the bad and the
[2:09:11] ugly is still there
[2:09:12] right the mirror doesn't lie i can think
[2:09:14] anything i want but when i look in the
[2:09:15] mirror the mirror tells me the truth
[2:09:17] doesn't it so when i look in the mirror
[2:09:19] of the word
[2:09:20] then what is it going to do it's going
[2:09:21] to tell me the truth
[2:09:23] it's going to show me where i fall short
[2:09:25] and it's also going to show me where i
[2:09:26] meet what i think
[2:09:28] right but it's going to be according to
[2:09:29] the word now the mirror of the word
[2:09:31] rather than what i had in my head
[2:09:33] amen if we can use the word as a mirror
[2:09:35] we can see enough of the carnality that
[2:09:37] our only focus our only concern is to
[2:09:39] seek god out and have him change that
[2:09:41] ugliness into his perfect image amen to
[2:09:43] get the carnality out of that mirror and
[2:09:45] put in christ instead amen like i said a
[2:09:48] scope is used on other people and when i
[2:09:49] hear people talking and it's always they
[2:09:52] they they they and never me me me me
[2:09:54] when it comes to change that's when i
[2:09:56] know the scope is on somebody else the
[2:09:58] word has been used as a scope on a rifle
[2:10:00] to take other people accountable but not
[2:10:01] hold yourself accountable to the same
[2:10:03] thing amen when everyone else is off the
[2:10:05] word the word has been used as a scope
[2:10:07] not as a mirror because all of us have
[2:10:09] fallen we've come short of the glory of
[2:10:11] god amen amen we've got to be raised up
[2:10:14] into it i'd rather use it as a mirror
[2:10:15] than as a scope amen
[2:10:17] let's all stand together if we would
[2:10:19] amen i want to ask you is the
[2:10:21] word your mirror or is the word your
[2:10:23] scope
[2:10:25] i think if we were a little bit honest
[2:10:27] we'd say a little bit of both sometimes
[2:10:29] you know
[2:10:30] because sometimes what happens is we get
[2:10:32] a little dry we get a little crusty we
[2:10:34] get a little formal we don't have a
[2:10:35] prayer life where it's meant to be we're
[2:10:36] not reading the word the way we're
[2:10:38] supposed to and all of a sudden what we
[2:10:39] do is we start looking at other people
[2:10:41] because it's so uncomfortable
[2:10:42] to look in the mirror and see the
[2:10:43] reality that is looking back at us amen
[2:10:45] to where we're not where we ought to be
[2:10:46] so we'd rather focus on somebody else
[2:10:48] for a while
[2:10:49] i mean we don't want to use the word as
[2:10:50] a scope we want to use it as a mirror
[2:10:52] amen we don't point out weaknesses in
[2:10:54] each other what we do is we point to the
[2:10:56] word and say there is a remedy and then
[2:10:58] there's a place to go there's a person
[2:10:59] to go to not a place there's a person
[2:11:01] there's a reality there's a life there
[2:11:03] that'll take you from where you are to
[2:11:05] where you need to be and i'm telling you
[2:11:07] that because i've been there i was that
[2:11:10] and now i'm not and that's not me that
[2:11:12] did it that's christ that did it in the
[2:11:14] amen and then we point people to the
[2:11:16] shed blood of calvary we point them to a
[2:11:18] holy ghost that can make you live a life
[2:11:20] that you never thought you could live
[2:11:21] that can take the word standard and take
[2:11:23] it into your life to the point that you
[2:11:24] cannot only live it but your very
[2:11:26] desires will call for it as well in your
[2:11:28] own life amen
[2:11:29] amen we want the word as a mirror not as
[2:11:32] a scope let's bow our head
[2:11:35] heavenly father lord a challenging
[2:11:36] service this morning
[2:11:38] lord for me personally and i'm sure for
[2:11:40] each one listening
[2:11:42] and lord if i've been too hard lord if
[2:11:43] i've said it in a way that would lord
[2:11:45] cause someone to be offended lord i pray
[2:11:47] you forgive me lord help them to have
[2:11:49] grace for it to see that my heart lord
[2:11:51] is to get us all closer to you
[2:11:53] lord we're not looking to draw anyone to
[2:11:55] me we're not looking to make anybody
[2:11:57] line up by brute force lord but we want
[2:11:59] to encourage each other along this path
[2:12:01] lord that takes us into a rapture that
[2:12:03] takes us into a resurrection lord that
[2:12:05] takes us into a marriage supper lord
[2:12:06] where you will dry every tear lord will
[2:12:08] you will wipe away our faith lord the
[2:12:10] tears on our face lord that you'll give
[2:12:12] us that joy unspeakable lord that will
[2:12:14] never be taken away from us
[2:12:16] lord lift your people up lord as we
[2:12:18] examine ourselves lord may we just look
[2:12:20] in your word again as a mirror lord not
[2:12:22] look to the left or the right not to
[2:12:23] another brother or sister but lord to
[2:12:26] look at ourselves and say lord do we
[2:12:28] line up with your word and lord where we
[2:12:30] don't may we open the door why lord to
[2:12:31] let that water of the word wash it out
[2:12:33] lord to let the fire of your holy spirit
[2:12:35] burn out that carnality lord that
[2:12:37] humanity lord and fill it with the
[2:12:39] reality of a living word in our life of
[2:12:41] a living god that lives and breathes
[2:12:42] inside of us we pray
[2:12:44] but touch your people bless us we ask in
[2:12:46] your name we pray amen
