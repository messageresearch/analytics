and its life Lord and as we've gathered in here this morning Lord we've gathered not to be seen or to be heard Lord but we've gathered to come under the umbrella of the strength and power of your word Lord God lord we're here to hear from you Lord we're here to be taught to grow Lord to be strengthened and encouraged corrected Lord Lord we're here to be brought into realities of the unity of the word Lord where we can look at our life and we can look at your word and we can see where we're the same Lord and where there's a difference Lord I pray that you'd help us to come up to a higher plane of Faith Lord a greater surrender a greater love Lord a greater separation from this world Lord that as people look at our lives Lord they'd be able to see Jesus Christ walking this earth once again Lord I pray you just speak again this morning Lord direct us by Your Word we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to John chapter 16 John 16 and verse 12 it's good to see sister Nikki back with brother jine and then back from the warm shores of Jamaica back to our the Frozen chosen up north here amen but it's good to have you back safely and appreciate this special sister Selena God bless you and then a a little word of Correction this morning I noticed that uh virtually everybody was late for Sunday school brother Paul goes through a lot of effort sister Kimberly goes through a lot of effort to prepare they don't have much time to do it and so if the people are coming late then they start late which puts them late coming back into the surface which puts a rush in when brother Bob's trying to start the service and he only has half the people here we can be on time or early for food we can be on time or early for school we can be on time or early for hockey games and entertainment and fun if we can't get to church on time we've got our priorities wrong it's that simple I'm not going to sugarcoat it and then I've got enough respect for brother Paul and sister Kimberly's work and brother Paul brother Bob trying to set an atmosphere of worship that we shouldn't have people coming in at the last minute so I don't want to see people dragging in at 10:25 that's when Sunday school starts we should be here 10:20 so that we've got our jackets put away so that we're settled and we're ready to go and that way he can be in at 5: to 11: so that brother Bob is not dealing with the Russia people and not working with half a church of people just waking up and and getting ready to sing so we should be in the sanctuary Everybody by 5: to 11: amen amen God bless you we need to respect the effort that people have put in the gifts that God's using and we do that in the mornings by being on time so amen trust that hits the mark this morning amen John chapter 16 verse2 says this I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning we're continuing our series on the Holy Ghost and we want to take a second service and we'll take one more at least on this I believe on how do I know that I have the Holy Spirit how do I know I've received the Holy Spirit and we started this in the last service on last Wednesday and we get we ask the question why was the Holy Ghost sent in the first place because if we want an Evidence of what of of having it then we ought to know why it was sent because the two of those ought to be matched God's not going to send his spirit with purpose and then give us a completely different evidence that makes no sense and so we preached from Ezekiel 36 and he said I'm going to going to give you a new heart and a new spirit but at the end of that he says I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them that word caused there I didn't dwell on the this too much last service I've left it for here that word cause means I'm going to accomplish I'm going to perform by a creative act catch that now this is not something that happens by our choice or by our our will our personal will or desire but it's a it's it's conditional on a creative act and what is it it's the seed word of God coming to life inside of you that's what happens when the spirit of God comes across our life when the word of God flashes across us that light brings that seed to life and that's based on a creative act of God way back before the foundation of the world where he declared you're a child of God Amen it's not of our own will but then he says I'm going to cause you to do what this this creative act is going to cause you to walk in my statutes and that means to live and act according to the word of God so in other words we are not just hearers and we are not just talkers but we are doers amen and that's what it's supposed to do so we saw the purpose of the spirit being sent back was not to be just around us not to be with us only but it was meant to be within us and that's what would cause us to live according to the word God wants us to live by the word because that's the only thing that can set us free that's the only thing that's going to work we have all sorts of self-help programs and and books and these different things there's only one book there's only one word there's only one Spirit that'll truly set us free and that's the Living Word of God Amen then we moved over to Jesus ministry and I'm just setting a quick Foundation this morning for those that weren't here and able to hear it and Jesus said unto them if God were your father he's speaking to the ministry now the priesthood if God were your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and come from God neither came I of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech he says even because you cannot hear his my word now they could hear his word with their ears they could hear it intellectually but they could not receive it much less accept it and Obey it so Jesus said because you can't accept it it you can't receive it and because you can't receive it you won't ever get the benefit of it you think you've got it but you don't why what was the problem here Church the problem was they had a personally uh created revelation of what the word of God meant they had come up with their own interpretation of what God intended by the books and the law of Moses and all the other prophets and so when the Living Word came they refused to lay down their personal interpretation for the real interpretation and in doing so they gave up the opportunity to be a living epistle he says ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and Abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it he he says and because I tell you the truth you believe me not why because there's no truth in them to receive it which of you convinces me of sin and if I say the truth why do you not believe me he that is of god heareth God's word ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of God so Jesus gives here the the proof the evidence of somebody being a child of God and that evidence is that they can hear the word of God now we spoke last service how that word hear does not just mean to hear but it's implicit that if you hear it you will obey it you will accept it you will receive it and you will obey the word of God and only a child of God can receive the full word of God Amen a child of Satan can't do that a child of the devil of Darkness can't do that now they can take at a certain distance don't think for a second they can't because there's can be an emotional appeal to the word of God there can be an intellectual appeal there can be a relational appeal people like to be accepted I don't think we realize how much we're blessed to have Believers around us all the time people struggle with covid I had no problems with Co because why I have a family of Believers around me there's a great benefit to have having good people around you all the time but that's not going to be the proof of it and as soon as as pain comes as pressure comes as separation comes as offense comes by the word and causes an impact on our life that we don't like what not we like not not our lives I trust but a child of Satan they can have stuck with the word to that point but eventually they will compromise and back away because it's not in them to take the word over their own Comfort or preference they'll always back away but says this he says remember now John the Baptist was both the prophet and the messenger of his day he was filled with the holy ghost from his mother's womb when he was baptizing in Jordan the word of God which is Jesus came to him he says the word always comes to the true spirit filled that is the evidence of being filled with the Holy Ghost that is what Jesus said would be the evidence he says and I will pray the father and he will send you another comforter that he may excuse me abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive so you cannot be of this world and receive the Holy Spirit you cannot be a child of Hell a child of Darkness a child of Satan and receive the spirit it is only for the children of God that's the only ones that can receive it because they're the only ones that can receive the word he says now you know what truth is and he references John 17:17 Thy word is truth again in John 8:43 why do you not understand my speech because you cannot hear my word he says did you notice that Jesus said that the world could not receive the Holy Ghost well in this verse I just read neither could they receive the word why he says because the spirit and the word are one and if you have the Holy Spirit as the prophets the word would come to you you would receive it it will come to you and you will receive it and he says in John 14:26 but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I've said unto you he says here again we find the word coming because of the spirit of God again in John 16:13 how be it he when he the spirit of Truth which is the word is come he will guide you into all truth Thy word is all is truth and he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear the word of God that shall he speak the word and he will show you things to come he says it's the spirit bringing the word of Prophecy now you have to be really careful with this because people look at that and say the Holy Ghost is going to do that but how is he going to do that let's let the word interpret itself how does he do it he takes the word and he gives it to men men are the Holy Spirit speaking if they are true Spirit-filled sons of God because as they hear the Holy Spirit doesn't hear the holy spirit is God himself but what is it those that have the Holy Spirit will hear what it gives them and they'll speak it and it will always point back to the word that's the way that it works amen he says I want you to note very carefully that Jesus did not say the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues interpreting prophesying or shouting and dancing he said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth you would be in the word of God for your age he says the evidence has to do with receiving that word now we're not going to dwell too much on what that means that'll be the next service Lord willing how do you know that that you've received the word but the the we'll just leave it at this point that to receive the word is to prove that the holy spirit is working in your life now watch what Jesus says about the priests because this really ties into where we're going today he says and he answered and said unto them well ha Isaiah prophesied of you Hypocrites at it is as it is written this people honors me with their lips but their heart is far from me they say the right things he says but their heart intentions and their inner desires do not match their words when you really start pushing when the pain comes when the pressure comes something comes out and it's not the spirit of God it's not the word of God he says how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men so they've made up their own religion it's not even so much that they've laid aside the word of God but rather they've added to it as we see in the next verse he says for laying aside the Commandments of God ye hold the tradition of men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such things like you do so they tried to add their part to the word of God what happened was his disciples ate with unwashed hands they said hey you guys aren't following the word and Jesus says that's not the word Moses never said that you're the ones that came up with that and if they they prepared food with certain utensils then it couldn't touch other food there was clean and unclean things that that that it could touch and had to be separated and washed and they added this burden of constant cleanliness and it was only self- religion it was only to try and make themselves feel better about it it was all ritualistic cleansing and washing he says but he said unto them full well ye reject the Commandment of God that you may keep your own tradition so when por came to shove they'd focus more on what they'd come up with what they' added to the word of God what made them feel spiritual rather than simply doing it as God had delivered it to Moses and the prophets amen they put their own ideas above the word of God and when they came to Jesus and his disciples they're pointing at them and and finding fault that those men did not meet up with their manly ideas okay this is what we would call a denomination today it's when men have added their ideas to the word of God and come up with a religion a way of living spiritually that satisfies them but it doesn't meet the word of God and we see that it's something that has been alive and well since Cain remember remember Cain only had to do one thing and that was sacrifice a lamb and he refused because he wasn't in him to obey and he wanted to do it his way with the things that he grown and the and the things that he accomplished in his farming life and these different things and what's the net effect of this it's in verse 13 He says in doing this you are making the word of God of none effect through your tradition which ye have delivered and many such like things you do that word none effect that phrase none effect it means to nullify nullify to ow validate to void to take away the power so what they' done by this time by the time that Christ comes in human flesh they've had 1300 years of adding to the word of God and he says what you've done is you've taken away any power that it had in it and all you've done is you bound the people to your own ideas to New Traditions they put chains of bondage on the ly and then they were going around and pointing fingers at them and making their lives even more difficult than they had to be church if that's how far they went in 1300 years how far has the church gotten off the path of the word after 2,000 years it's worse it's worse and it's wound its way through through history and through tradition and these things amen that's why we needed a Malachi 4 restoration was because God had to come and turn our hearts back to the original faith of the Pentecostal fathers of the apostolic fathers from the day of Pentecost because even in the days of uh of Paul and Peter they were saying listen you're already getting away from the gospel within 20 or 30 years not even that they were already getting away what we have this tendency to add to the word of God for our personal spiritual benefit we want to make ourselves more spiritual church we have to be so careful so careful that we we clarify what is a personal conviction and what is the word of God especially to our children listen we can go into each other's homes and and see the things that we do and it's okay to hold to a particular standard in your family I believe that that is Sovereign to every single person in the body Paul confirms it in in Romans 14 I think something like that but but we have to be so careful that we clarify that what we're doing is by leadership not by necessarily the word of God because I have weaknesses you don't have and you have weaknesses I don't have and so God will deal with me differently than he deals with you and the thing you have to realize is that you are not your children and your children are not you listen we may have a different standard at times for our own children because some are weaker than others in certain areas whether it's Sports whether it's entertainment whether it's music whether it's books clothing education jobs whatever it might be some of us have tendencies that lean towards not good for us and so we need tighter boundaries perhaps than those that don't have those issues but remember Paul would say whatsoever is not a faith is sin if God convicts your heart to do it then do it but if he doesn't convict somebody else's heart then don't go to them and say why are you doing this unless it is a genuine word issue we have to be led by the spirit amen but we all answer to God for how we lead our lives but I trust it'll be the Holy Spirit leading us and not a traditions of men because traditions of men bind us and what they do is they take away power from the real word of God Jesus was trying to break the people from this and how did he do it he pointed back to the word he's saying where did you get that in the word he asks the hard questions he points out the hypocrisy because they use these to benefit themselves to make themselves look better to put others down and then they would use these these little little uh loopholes he would talk about how you you say you can't help your your parents because you say I've dedicated that money to God your parents would have a need and then you'd say well I can't do it i' I've dedicated that money to God he says that's not what I told you to do if you've got money use it for your parents honor your parents if you pay your tithes and offerings don't shelter what you have on the under under a headship of propos of spir spirituality it's not the real deal he was trying to get them out of the bondage they created so they could come into the Liberty that he offered them by the gospel but even with his disciples we see that Jesus could only go so far and we see in the Book of John right before his death on the on the night of the Passover he says I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now he could only take them so far in the word where they were right there he shared things with them that he didn't share with anybody else but even he comes to the point where he says I've got more to tell you but I can't tell you now and the reason is verse number 13 He says how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth so they can only go so far until they get the back baptism of the Holy Spirit and then they can go all the way he says for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come so they need to receive the holy spirit before they can move into a greater revelation of the word of God otherwise they're limited by their own experience by their own emotions by their own Spirit but remember they've been baptized they've been taught they've been in great revivals they've had signs and wonders they've been in tremendous meetings they've been able to sit at the feet of Jesus and learn they've got Mysteries but Jesus says until you get the Holy Spirit I can only go so far I can tell you things but you won't get them or you can't handle them there are things that we only say to people really we only preach to people that have the Holy Ghost because it'll stumble somebody that doesn't absolutely it will remember Judas had stayed with them to this point but there's one thing Judas couldn't do and that was receive the holy spirit that was the separating line he says he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and will show it unto you the so the holy spirit will always point you back to Christ the word amen now Ezekiel said that the purpose of the spirit being given was to cause us to live with the word of God Jesus said that the Holy Spirit would guide us into all truth Jesus said Thy word is truth amen so if we take all of that into John 16 and13 we can substitute it this way if you'll grant me that this morning he says how be it when he the Holy Spirit has come he will guide you he sent said into all truth but what he's saying is into all the word of God that's how we know the holy spirit is working in our life is that he will guide us into into that's where you and the word become one it's not guide you to it's guide you into it's a positional placing of you into the body of Christ to where you and the word become one where you can be as Paul said a living epistle that when people see you they see the word that's what he's talking about not head knowledge not Doctrine but this is a life lived by the word of God it's the word living through US amen and that's exactly exactly what he was talking about in Ezekiel 36 that you can't walk in the word until the spirit comes to you but when the spirit comes he reveals the word and as he reveals the word you start to walk in it and the more he reveals the more you walk and the more you walk the greater benefit the greater reality comes with it amen we can only walk in the light as he gives it he doesn't hold us accountable for what we don't know but once he gives it to us once he shows it to us his intention is that we become one with it not that we just sit there and say oh that looks really good but we say Lord let me become what I see let me walk daily by this Jesus continues he says Jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will do one thing he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him him and make our abow with him we have people today saying I love Jesus you go talk to a professing Christian they say I love Jesus Jesus said if you love me you'll keep my words and what happens is you bring the word test and you say well do you do you go to church well I don't really believe that I have to go to church because I love Jesus and it's a personal Affair but his word says that we ought to not forsake the assembling of ourselves together amen and just the Simplicity of the go goel even that so many won't do it have you separated from the world since you received Christ well he's looking at the heart yes he is looking at the heart but he's supposed to have given you a new one do you have a new one yet well it doesn't matter I'm under the blood of Christ see they can't fulfill the word they might love him they might have an emotional connection to a Jesus they've created but they don't love him truly because they don't keep his words and he says if you can't keep my word then I can't come to you it's those that receive it and keep it and become a part of it that's for the spirit filled amen he says he that loveth me not keepeth not my Saints very simple if you won't go by the word then you don't love God very simple he says and the word which you hear is not mine but the fathers which sent me these things have I spoken unto you being yet present with you but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you so he says when the Holy Spirit comes he will guide us into truth he will guide us into the word first and foremost now there are benefits there are manifestations there are gifts and all these different things there are big emotions I believe with the presence of God absolutely if we can come into the presence of God if we can feel the presence of God and nothing is changed in this in this body or in our spirit then I think there's a problem if we claim to be filled with the Holy Spirit but evidence of the spirit is receiving the word of God because why he'll take us into the word he'll take us into the truth that's how we know we have the spirit he takes us into the truth R says in 1 Corinthians 14:37 if many man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord he says now see that the proof of the indwelling spirit was to acknowledge and follow what God's Prophet gave for his age as he set the church in order Paul had to say to those who claimed another Revelation what came the word of God out from you or came it unto you only he says the evidence of a Spirit-filled Christian believer is not to produce the truth the word but to receive the truth the word and to believe it and Obey it so in other words I am not the source of inspiration or Revelation you are not the source of inspiration Revelation but you are the receiver of the re of the revelation of the word amen it does not come from me it comes to me it does not come from you it comes to you amen we are children of God we have to receive it before we can give it and what was happening was Paul was pointing to these ministers that got all cocky and caught up in themselves and he says hey do you think this came to you from you or to you because you're acting as if it came out of you as if you came up with it rather than the Holy Spirit was the inspiration and you received it he says have you noticed in Revelation 22:17 the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come see the bride speaks the same word as does the spirit she is a word bride proving she has the spirit in every Church age we hear these words he that ha an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches the spirit gives the word and if you have the spirit you will hear the word for your age as those true Christians took the word for their age he says did you get that last thought I repeat every Church age ends with the same admonition he that have an ear let him an individual hear what the spirit say to the churches the spirit gives the word he has the truth for each age each age has had its own elect and that elect group always heard the word and received it proving they had the seed in them John 8:47 says and he that is of God heareth God's words ye therefore hear them not because you are not of God they refused the word Jesus and his word words for their days but the true seed received the word because they were of God he says and Allah he's reading on Isaiah and all thy children shall be taught of God of the Holy Spirit Jesus said the same thing in John 6:45 being one with the word proves whether you are of God and spirit filled there is no other Criterion that's where we stand this morning that's what this church believes is that it is you and the word becoming one you may or may not have manifestations you may or may not have gifts you may or may not have great emotions dancing shouting all those things we believe in all of it believe in all of it it's if that's what God does in your life then we say praise the Lord but that is not what makes us a child of God what makes us a child of God is that we are joined with the word amen he says but what are tongues and interpretation and the other gifts he says they are manifestations that is what the word teaches read it in 1 Corinthians 12:7 but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all then Paul names those manifestations he says now comes this very good question that I know you're all anxious to ask why isn't the manifestation an Evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost because you surely could not manifest the Holy Ghost unless you truly were Spirit-filled in other words how is it that people could express the gifts and the manifestations of the Holy Spirit if they didn't have it he says now I wish I could say that is right because I don't like to hurt people or walk on their Doctrine but I wouldn't be a true servant of God if I didn't tell you the whole counsel of God now I'm not going to read what he says but I'll I'll summarize it quickly he talks about balum balum was a prophet in the Old Testament he had a true gift of Prophecy absolutely and he would say he gave one of the most beautiful prophecies in the Old Testament under the anointing of the Holy Spirit but what happened was he took it he took the wages of unrighteousness for personal gain he laid aside the perfect will of God and he ended up teaching the moabites how to bring Israel into idolatry which is spiritual fornication with God and brought judgment rather than a blessing then he would talk about Caiaphas in the days of Jesus the high priest and Caiaphas prophesies about Jesus death and it was absolutely a perfect and correct prophecy and then he went and he crucified if Jesus then he talks about Judas Judas had signs and wonders Judas healed the sick Judas raised the dead Judas cast out demons all manifestations of the power of God on him and yet Judas betrayed Christ and was called the son of predition he was lost he could never receive the spirit but he could be under an anointing absolutely a false vessel with a true anointing and we'll see it in other places in the scripture as we go through and then he says this he says yet he had a genuine manifestation of the Holy Ghost we can't deny that so where is manifestation as an Evidence it isn't there if you are truly spirit filled or truly filled with the spirit of God you will have the evidence of the word in your life in your life amen so as he he talked about if you go to Revelations 2 and 3 and you read those admonitions to the church ages it was for seven literal churches back then but primarily it was meant for the future Church ages coming over the next 2,000 years and to every single age the holy spirit said something but it was only said to one person it said to the angel of the Church of Ephesus to the angel of the Church of Smyrna and Philadelphia and these different ones to the Church of the to the angel of the Church of leoda write in other words the Holy Spirit sends a message or brings a message to one man one messenger for that age it wasn't sent to preachers it wasn't sent to priests it wasn't sent to the pope it wasn't sent to some conglomeration of religious people it was sent to one man and then that man went and shared it with professing Christians and he would share that message and he would go around the churches and those that received it would take that message and carry it on and there were those that did not reive that message and they would go on their way and you'll find in the church ages that very few would receive Reed the message for their day because why they gotten caught up in the traditions of men amen even while Paul and Peter were alive as I mentioned the churches were already falling away preachers were forsaking what Paul said and coming up with their own ideas so they could promote themselves so they could build their Ministries so they could create wealth and influence it was the me monster all over again they were wanting something for themselves and what it was was power they wanted power but what happens was when we take the power to ourselves we lose the power of the word and so what left the church was the signs the Wonders the healings the discernment the Judgment the correction they lost everything they lost every Power of the holy spirit because they took power to themselves and in doing so they took away the power of the word of God because they had added to it watch what Paul says here in Galatians 1 he says I Marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you under the grace of God unto another gospel now I want you to catch what he how he describes this he says which is not another he says but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ amen notice they don't start with their own Gospel they start with the Gospel of Jesus Christ the one that was given Satan's a perverter not a Creator and so he takes what God has done and under his influence what did they do they see they sought to undo the power of the word by taking power to themselves how did they do it they changed the gospel they perverted it amen it says but though we are an angel from heaven Paul says I'm not even allowed to change this but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be a cursed listen Society changes the world expectations change pressures change Paul says I don't care how this world changes we do not change the word does doesn't change and if we stay with the word we will hold fast no matter what he says as we said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be a cursed God forbid we change this word but when you know when we change at church is when we don't have what it says that's honesty is when we look at the word and we say I don't have it and the tendency is to say well that means it's not there it doesn't mean that it's not for today like they're doing with this cessation gospel it was only for the days of the Apostles no like I said last service everything in this Bible is available for you every experience every gift every manifestation every reality of the word of God is available to us because we're in an age of full restoration it wasn't available in every other age it was available in the first age and it was available in the last age I am Alpha and I am Omega I am not the middle but at the first and the last there's a perfect manifestation of the word of God in the body of Believers so he says let him be a curse because what it holds people back from the realities of the god that we serve he says for do I now persuade men or God or do I seek to please men if I for if I yet please men I should not be the servant of Christ see we can't be preachers preaching what you want to hear we've got to preach what the word says and it'll draw the men and the women that are children of God and everyone else will separate and it'll hurt and we won't like it but that's just the way it is he says but I certify you Brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for I neither received it of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ and paulw he would talk about as soon as he's he's baptized and receives the Holy Ghost God would take him out into the desert and open the word to him and he would take it from Genesis all the way through the Books of Moses and through the prophets amen and he would open it up to him and he would give Paul the revelation of Jesus Christ all through scriptures and in that revelation of Jesus Christ he would point to us as well within him so he would show us where Christ was in the Old Testament and then he would show where we were in the Old Testament as well why because Paul was the voice of the Holy Spirit to his age Paul was the voice speaking amen it wasn't Paul's Doctrine it was the holy spirit's Doctrine it was the voice of the Holy Spirit to that age amen and if we take one word away what do we lose we lose the full revelation of Jesus Christ and we lose a part because we can't be there unless we're the full Revelation it takes away our part out of the book of life it was only Paul that preached the fullness of the Gospel Peter didn't preach it James didn't preach it Paul was the only one that preached the fullness of the Gospel that brought it I should say he took us all the way back Peter had no idea of these things Peter had no idea about it remember he would say and brother Paul he preaches these things that are hard to understand as in all of his letters Peter's looking at what Paul says he's like whoa this is hard to understand it amazes me the Catholics pick Peter as the pope when Paul has had preaching that Paul that Peter never had and Paul had to correct Peter uh Peter for his actions even but who was it it was the Holy Spirit guiding the church into all truth and what I mean church I mean the body of Believers not the nominal church not the professing church but the real church amen it was guided into all Truth by who the gospels of Paul but it wasn't Paul speaking it was the Holy Spirit speaking Paul wrote as he heard Paul gave as he received and so we're hearing the Holy Spirit speaking not Paul and today we do we know that because I preach from Paul's words as if it is God not because it's as if it is God it's because it is God I do not look to Paul I do not look to Paul and so when we had a Prophet come in this age and he says I preach Paul's message that's why I receive it because if he brought any other message he would be a cursed that's right that's right amen that's why we believe it we look at Paul's gospels as the literal revelation of Jesus Christ to the bride amen we preach it as if God said it because God did say it it was him speaking to Paul and Paul took it and brought it to the church now let's go back to Acts 2 where we started last service to talk about this evidence of the holy spirit because too many people today are preaching that it's speaking in tongues and listen I have no problem if you claim that speaking in tongues is the evidence of the Holy Spirit if you preach it by the scriptures which means there is an Evidence of the Holy Spirit by tongues but you see they don't have it watch this it says ' and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance notice other tongues they began to speak with other languages not unknown languages other languages and it says as the spirit gave them utterance so they did not start it the Holy Spirit moved on them to speak in a completely different language that they didn't know okay they couldn't start it they couldn't stop it it was the Holy Spirit using their tongues amen if we don't believe it then let's let Ser uh scripture interpret scripture okay let's go through this line by line it says and there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews devout men out of every nation under heaven now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and they were confounded because that every man every man heard them who those that were speaking in other tongues speak in his own language so those 120 people coming down from from The Upper Room are speaking known languages but languages they hadn't been taught to speak every person in the crowd there hears the language that they know it's not unknown tongues it's not gibberish it's not chaos there is total understanding of what they're saying okay it's not unknown tongues it's understandable languages and they were all amazed and marveled saying one to another behold are not all these which speak galileans in other words galileans don't know all of our languages how are we able to understand them how are they speaking this he says and how hear we every man in our own tongue wherein we were born parthians Andes and elamites and the Dwellers of Mesopotamia Judea capadia pontis Asia friia pamilia Egypt parts of Libya rout sirene strangers of Rome Jews Jews and prelates cits and Arabians we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God so people from all over the world are gathered in Jerusalem for this Feast amen and every single one could hear and understand what the 120 people were saying in their native language you want an Evidence of the Holy Ghost speaking in tongues there it is because only God can do that and we'll see why that is okay so this is a miracle now on the speaker this is the miracle touching those that are filled with the spirit that as they speak they're speaking in another language okay so tell if you want to preach Holy Ghost evidence in tongues then that's the evidence it'll teach you to it'll give you the ability to speak a language you've never been taught I don't believe that's the evidence but if you want to say tongues is it then let's do it the way the scripture says but remember Jesus said they were going to do this he said and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues new languages not unknown languages new languages things they'd never spoken before why Church why is he doing this because the evidence of the Holy Ghost is receiving the word he's setting them up so that people can receive the word he's not pointing to them he's pointing to the ones that are hearing the word and saying you need this so that you can receive the word and so he's creating a supernatural Miracle to make it so that there is no barrier to them hearing the word church this ought to teach us something our culture our language our birth family our heritage our tradition our DNA will not stop a child of God from hearing the word of God he'll get it to you one way or another listen if you can't speak the language he'll bring somebody that'll speak the language one way or the other whether it's through the Spirit or whether it's through somebody that speaks it naturally amen God takes care of his own yeah I think of of Blanca's father crossing the border of the US illegally and he finds a tract in the middle of nowhere church God will find you God will find his children Jesus said I will not lose a one I'll not lose a one they're they're engraved in the palms of my hand I can't lose them they're a part of me God will break down every barrier he'll Bridge every Gap he'll knock down every he'll open any door that's required to bring the word to his child but watch cuz that's just the 120 every one of them speaking and as they come up to somebody they speak their language what an Outreach tool what an Outreach tool can you imagine I'd feel like brother Vel speaking seven languages 15 different groups I think it was that are that are encountered here and as they come up to a person they can start testifying of what God's doing the word is a reality remember what Joel said this is it look at me I'll tell you what I used to be I'll tell you what I am and they could testify effectively but what happens now cuz they all shut up and one person starts to talk one person starts to speak and we know it's Peter Peter starts to talk and when Peter speaks he's not speaking in tongues Church he's speaking his native language he's speaking Aramaic but as he speaks the speech is translated in real time into the ears of the of the listener as he speaks he doesn't need to wait for 15 translations to roll through the crowd have you ever seen those overseas meetings where they've got three or four different languages represented there the preacher speaks and then and they go down the line and then he speaks and then another three guys do it or four guys do it and it it's say push and pull push and pull Peter doesn't have to do it as Peter speaks the holy spirit is there to translate his words into the ears of the hearer so that they understand perfectly what he's saying amen every person in the crowd understands him so I want you to catch this now so the miracle now is no longer in the speaker the miracle is in the hearer the miracle is in the hearer Peter's speaking as he always speaks but God's doing a work and he's taking what Peter says and he's translating it into the ears of the hearers amen the miracle was happening on the receiving end not on the giving end Peter had no idea what he was saying but he saw that they understood amen what is it God was being personal to every person in that group I'll meet you where you are and I'll lay it in your lap with the word amen what's it showing church it's showing the holy spirit's the one that sets us free it's not Peter's preaching that set him free it's not my preaching is going to set you free it's the Holy Spirit that'll take that word and interpret it into into your life and make it personal and direct and I know we've all been there amen where the preacher is preaching and it's like there's a a million watt Spotlight on your life and it's God getting personal with you with the word what's it showing you're a child of God you're a child of God and he's breaking down barriers so that you know I've said it many times when I when I gave my heart to the Lord the services leading up to that that I that the discernment that that came over that that told me what I was going to do or what I wanted to do what I thought I was going to do and then it said but you're not going to do it cuz you're a child of mine it was personal to me and that's all I heard of those services but I heard the part that was for me and it brought me to God because I was a child of God Amen see what happened at Babel remember is God confused their tongues remember they what did they do they turned to their own religion they turned to their own ideas they created a false unity and so God came down he says I'm not going to allow it and he confused their tongues he gave them languages and so they couldn't understand so this group went with that one and that one because they understood each other but now under True Religion under the revelation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ God is unwinding the curse of Babel as a Vindication of the truth of the message that they're hearing it's literally God undoing what he did at Babel what's he saying he's saying listen you've been raised to a certain way you've been taught a certain way you go to a certain church you've been in a certain family but that doesn't matter the Holy Spirit Will unwind Every curse that's held you back and Set You Free by the revelation of Jesus Christ what's god making abundantly clear here Church the evidence is not in the speaking it's in the hearing it's in the hearing amen the greatest Miracle there is that God is allowing people to hear a language that's not even being spoken why because you've got to be able to hear the word to receive the word and that'll lead you to receive in the spirit amen he made the word a reality that day listen he makes the word effective he makes you effective he'll take our simple words our simple ideas our simple lives our simple thoughts by the word and he'll magnify that so that other people can see Christ so they can see a reality that they themselves do not have I've said this before I don't say it to magnify myself you know my heart when I was in Texas I was working with another engineer there we're both same age roughly and he was a professing Christian and he only stayed about a year and then he left but before he left he wrote me an email and he said I thought I was a Christian until I met you he says and then I realized there's more to Christianity than what I have that's about the greatest compliment I could ever get but that ought to be our testimony that ought to be our witness is that there's more to this than just going to church there's more to this than just dressing a certain way there's more than than just identifying with the particular message or idea but it's a life it's a changed life it's a life of surrender it's a life of dying out but in that there is power by the holy spirit for God to produce himself in US amen now watch watch the effect of the Holy Spirit we say the holy spirit's working in us let's see what it does it says now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do what the word is effective then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it's a simple formula and it still works today Church repent turn your life around start walking the other way in sincerity be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost he says for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call it's not limited to the day of the Apostles it's not limited to that church it's not limited to that time it's not limited to those people it's for whosoever God will call whosoever God will call it says and with many other words did he testify and exhort saying save yourselves from this UNT Generation Now Watch What Happens and they that gladly received what his word they that received his word were baptized and the same day there were added unto them about 3,000 Souls and they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine and fellowship and in Breaking of bread and in prayers now you notice one thing here it says they were added 3,000 Souls you can't add a soul unless it's sealed and it can't be sealed except by the Holy Spirit but there's not a word here about those 3,000 speaking in tongues why the work had been done it wasn't needed anymore for them right then and there but what they did do was they continued in the word they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine amen they stayed with the word of God they continue with the word of God they were in fellowship with the Saints why because that's what Christ said the Holy Spirit would do it would lead you into all truth and so they continued in truth as it was revealed unto them amen so we see that this event is not repeated time and time again sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't and there's a reason for that we look at acts chap 10 in the house of Cornelius we've read this before says while Peter yet spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them which heard the word so what's the requirement of receiving the Holy Spirit receive the word you respond to the word let it change your heart don't try and change your life don't try and change anything receive the thing that'll change you and let it do the work when the Holy Spirit comes in amen open your heart and the word will change you by the power of the Holy Spirit but while he yet spake I was reading and brother Bram says why did God do it this way than than other than how he did it at Pentecost where they had to wait and be baptized to receive the Holy Ghost he says that's the apostolic way God can do it any way he wants Hallelujah church God can do it any way any time anywhere if you will receive the word God can do the work he can do it right then and right there you don't have to wait you don't have to t you don't have to be in church you don't have to be under a preacher in the moment but it'll take you there it'll take you into Fellowship it'll take you to a body of Believers it'll take you to living by the word but if you are under the hearing of the word and you receive it in any way the Holy Spirit can hit you right then and there and seal your soul to the day of your Redemption the changing of your body he says and they of the circumcision which believe were astonished as many as came with Peter because it on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost for they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God then answered Peter can any man forbid water that these should not be baptized which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we he says in other words they've received the Holy Ghost the same way we did which is what speaking in a known language so why does it happen here there's three different nationalities in this house speaking three different languages the holy spirit's coming down to give Unity of the word so that's what he does there amen they spoke in new languages not in unknown languages they spoke in known but new to them and he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord then prayed they him to T certain days but then acts in Acts 19 Paul would go to Ephesus he goes through Corinth he comes to Ephesus and there when they received the Holy Ghost they did two things they spoke in tongues and they prophesied so on the day of Pentecost they spoke in new languages here they spoke in new languages but had this Holy Ghost before they were baptized now he goes over to Ephesus where they were under John's baptism he baptizes them lay hands on and then they speak in tongues and prophesy so is that now the evidence of the Holy Spirit speaking in tongues and prophesying CU they did it we can't deny they did it but they didn't do it at Pentecost so we've got to pull everything from the word we've got to take it in continuity through the word see what's common there and see what's not but then Paul would go Peter would go down to Samaria in Acts 8 and now the Samaritans pre they speak the same language as the Jews it's Aramaic and so there he lays hands on them they receive the Holy Ghost no tongu why they don't need it they're all speaking the same language see what happens here is we've got this m misconception people have this misconception of what happened on the day of Pentecost versus what the gift of tongues is it's not the same thing amen Paul had to put it in order with Corinthians and we're going to read the entire chapter of 1 Corinthians 14 just to to lay this aside you say brother John why are you preaching on this we don't deal with this in this church well I don't know if we do or not I don't know what every body thinks or believes about this but I'll tell you this we've got to have an answer for why we believe how we believe Selena was testifying to some Pentecostal sisters yesterday and sharing how we don't believe that tongues is the evidence of the Holy Spirit she's got to know where she stands if we're going to witness we got to have it by the word not by what brother John says we've got to be able to take them to the word Paul says this follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy so what does it mean to prophesy Church prophesy means to have the word of the Lord thus saith the Lord that's what it means he says for he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men but unto God for no man understands him how be it in the spirit he speaks Mysteries and he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification and exhortation and comfort so Paul's contrasting prophesying with speaking in tongues and he says prophesying is far greater he that speaks in an unknown tongue edifieth who himself but he that prophesieth edifieth the church so speaking in tongues isn't for others it's for yourself unless there's an interpreter present it's helping you in some way but it's not helping anybody else he says I would that yall spoke with tongues and everybody says amen he says but rather that you prophesied so he says yes I would love for you all to speak with tongues but more than that greater than that I want you to prophesy he says for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speak with tongues except the interpret that the church may receive edifying so if you speak with tongues and there's an interpreter well that's thus sayeth the Lord it may be I should clarify that because you could say something of yourself and somebody else could as well but it's supposed to be thus sayith the Lord the purpose of the gift is to bring a word from God so he says if you speak in tongues and don't interpret it does nobody any good but if you prophesy it helps everybody in the church he says now Brethren if I come unto you speaking with tongues what shall I profit you except I shall speak to you either by Revelation or by knowledge or by prophesying or by Doctrine so let let me say it this way Paul's saying if I come to the pulpit and all I do is speak in tongues what good does it do you absolutely none it has no purpose it has no benefit he says but if I come in tongues okay that's great but if I come with Revelation and knowledge and prophesy and Doctrine that's when I'm really going to help you amen tongues aren't helping anybody they are not a significant element in the church he says but and even things without lifegiving sound whether pipe or harp except they give a distinction in the sounds how shall it be known what is piped or heart so so sound is meant to have purpose and Clarity it's supposed to have intention he says for if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle so in the old days they would use trumpets to give commands to the armies and based on how they heard the trumpet they would they would perform a certain maneuver or go a certain way or do something and if the sound wasn't clear from the trumpet then they couldn't know what they were supposed to do and it would cause confusion on the battlefield and they couldn't move together in unity he says so likewise except ye utter by the Tongue words easy to be understood how shall it be known what is spoken for your speak you shall speak into the air it's wasted words if nobody understands you he says there are it may be so many kinds of voices in the world and none of them is without signification every voice every sound has a meaning it has a purpose therefore he says if I know not the meaning of the voice I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian to me so if I go down to Africa and I preach a sermon in English to an African tribe that doesn't speak English what good am I doing them none absolutely none what I'm saying may be good in and of itself but if they don't understand it it does them no good whatsoever okay so the words would be useless or wasted he says even so ye for as much as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts seek that ye may excel for what purpose to the edifying of the church okay every person in here has a gift whether you know it or not and the purpose of the gift is to help the other believers it is not to help myself it is not to help yourself you may benefit from it but its purpose is to edify to help grow mature strengthen and encourage take care of the local body and the global body in some cases whatever is needed he says wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret now remember on the day of Pentecost they didn't need an interpreter the Holy Ghost was The Interpreter and it happened in real time this gift of tongues requires an interpreter another person so it's not the same gift they had on the day of Pentecost on the day of Pentecost they didn't have an interpreter the Holy Ghost was doing it in real time he says for if I pray in an unknown tongue my spirit prayeth but my understanding is unfruitful so he's saying even when I pray in tongues I don't even know what I'm saying there's a groaning there's an unction from the Holy Spirit there's an expression of the spirit but I don't even understand it I just know that I'm doing it and there's something in me that's causing it he says but if I don't if I don't get an interpretation it doesn't help me he says what is it then I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the understanding also I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the understanding also in other words I need to get to a place where there's understanding involved in my prayer and worship not just an expression of the spirit that's wonderful it's it's a wonderful feeling it's a wonderful moment but he says I need understanding in the end of all of this else when thou shalt bless with the spirit how shall he that occupy the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest so if we speak in tongues if we pray in tongues how can people say amen if they don't understand it I've been in churches where they would have somebody that spoke another language pray you know what I can't say Amen to the prayer cuz I don't know what they said we trust that what they're saying is good but to say Amen means to be so be it you're accepting it as the word you're accepting it as truth and he's saying how can somebody say Amen if they don't know what you're talking about they can't so they're excluded from the blessing and in fact they withdraw from it because they're not partakers of it he says for thou verily givest thanks but the other is not edified he's saying what you're doing is not wrong but it's not helping anybody I thank my God I speak with tongues more than you all so we are not against tongues by any means Paul did it more than anyone he says but watch this next verse he says yet in the church I had rather speak five words I would rather would be the way we'd say it today but yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding that by my voice I might teach others also than 10,000 words in an unknown tongue where is the preeminence where's the priority in the Church of God church it's on the word of God with understanding he says Brethren be not children in understanding how be it in Malice be ye children but in understanding be men see what happens what do kids kids what do we do we like that which we like and we don't go to the things we don't like but as we mature and as we grow we realize the necessity of doing and eating things that we don't like to do anybody here want to get up every single morning 5 days a week for the rest of their life until they retire and work I don't think any of us wants to do that but we do it because it's a necessity how many here eat broccoli why because it's good for you listen I'll occasionally eat a sprig just to say I did it but I don't like it and so I don't do it Paul's saying don't be not children in understanding in other words don't go towards the things you like about church and walk out with no growth in your spiritual understanding don't get caught up in the fun in the emotion in the in the atmosphere and walk away no stronger than you came in don't be like kids with this brother BR would say you've been children long enough playing with the gifts time to set them in order time to let God start using them amen he says in the law it is written but I like how he says how be it and Mal malice be you children listen I've seen it you see kids playing and some guy leans off and he punches the other one and 30 minutes later those two kids are back playing as if it never happened they cry maybe they get over it they come and complain and then they realize it's still more fun to play with them than be by myself and then they're back with them again he says in Malice let's be that way if you're going to be a child be a child about holding grudges he says in the law it is written with men of other tongues and other lips will I speak unto this people and yet for all that they do not hear me sayeth the Lord God prophesied he do it he did it he's still doing it today but without interpretation it serves no value okay he says wherefore tongues are for assigned not to them that believe but to them that believe not but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not but for them which believe he says if therefore the whole church come together into one place and all speak with tongues and there come in those that are unlearned or unbelievers will they not say that ye are mad so if somebody walks through those doors that is never uh heard of this of the gift of speaking in tongues has never heard it done never been taught about it you get a rank sinner knows nothing about God walks in off that street through these doors and everyone is here is speaking in tongues what are they going to do Church they're going to turn right around and they're going to walk right up cuz it means nothing to them in fact it makes us look crazy we don't change what we do based on how it looks okay that's not the reason we don't do it but he's saying you're not going to help that person by speaking in tongues in fact you're going to do the opposite you're going to push them right out the door because they'll have no clue what's going on they'll think you guys are crazy okay he says but if all prophesy and there com in one that believeth not or one unlearned he's convi convinced of all he's judged of all and thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest and so falling down on his face he will worship God and report that God is in you of a truth so in other words if there is prophecy going forth in the truth in in in the church and that that person's secrets are revealed his life where he's at what's going on whatever it might be if a prophecy Goes Forth and says uh sir in the back you you are here and you've been doing this and you've been doing that God tells you to stop it he's got a plan for you he wants you then he can say oh my goodness they don't know me I'm a stranger to this church and coming in here they knew who I was he's saying that's of God and that person will know that it's of God cuz they know that you don't know anything about them so that can happen under the a gift of Prophecy if we had an actual prophet in our midst then that would be it is well but it can also happen under the preaching of the word because remember the scripture says who is the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart the word the word is the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so if that person comes in and the Holy Spirit anoints that man to speak to them then it can go into their life and discern and that's when we get that Spotlight on ourselves and to an unbeliever or not a not I call him an unbeliever to a child of God that doesn't know they're a child of God that can feel very uncomfortable at first but there's a draw in them that responds to the light and it pulls them forward and they're able to receive the word he says now this is Paul now the Corinthian Church was the only one that needed this instruction everybody else had it in order as far as we know he says how is it then Brethren when you come together every one of you can you imagine we've got about 50 people here this morning if every one of us has a PSAL has a has a special can you imagine the length of the service if we all had a special what would happen Church the word would never get preached everyone has a Doctrine everyone has a tongue everyone has a revelation everyone has an interpretation he says let all things be done unto edifying If any man speak in an unknown tongue he says Let It Be by two or at the most by three and that by course and let one interpret so Paul says in any given service if there's going to be a SP a speaking in tongues where the church will stop and listen he says it's at most two or three that's Paul's Rule and it says only by interpretation so brother visha was to stand up this morning go however that and there was no interpretation Paul says that doesn't happen in the church we will not listen to tongues without interpretation because it edifies nobody it's a waste of our time all it does is make that person look spiritual okay and he says we do it in course one after the other they're not fighting each other they're not speaking over each other it is the spirit moving sovereignly one in one in front of the other he says but if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church now that doesn't mean you can't speak in tongues in the church it means we're not going to stop the service to listen if we're praying if we're singing you do whatever you want to do you can do that at home you can do that in a small group whatever but in the church we will not stop the service to hear somebody speak in Tong unless there's an interpretation that's going to go with it so that means we need both in the church see you see in Pentecost what they're focused on is the speaking and nobody's focusing on the interpreting why because they're not speaking anything most of the time he says if there be no interpreter let him keep silence in the church and let him speak to himself and to God see remember what brother Bram says he said we do that before the service we do it before the service why we're going to check your motive do you want recognition or do you want to edify cuz if you want to edify you don't care if they know if you that you said it or you interpreted it you're there to help people not to receive it unto yourself okay it shows whether we're looking whether we've got a burden a message from God in our soul or if we're just looking for for other people to recognize us and then he says let the prophet speak two or three and let the other judge so Paul says I wish you all would prophesy but when it comes to putting it in order he says but still only two or three why the word is preeminent not gifts not interpretations and these things he says if anything be revealed to another that sth by let the first hold his peace so we don't jump we don't try and get in front of the other person we let them finish before we jump in he says for ye may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all may be comforted and the spirits of the prophets are subjects to are subject to the prophets so we can hold ourselves if we've got that gift we can hold it in check until the other person's done he says if you can't there's a problem for God is what not the author of confusion but of Peace as in all churches of the Saints so this isn't about you using the gift it's about God using the gift when I start to use it what happens confusion chaos but if God uses it it'll bring peace in the church it'll be in order it'll be shared it'll be spread out amongst the body so we don't put God in a box but we do follow his word and Paul said let's keep these things in check let's focus on the on the reason we come here and yes we love to sing We Love to Worship I love those things but he says we're coming for the word of God and that's why we gather here amen everything else is a minor it is not a major it is a minor amen anytime we make a minor a major we lose the power of the word because we're focusing on the thing that lacks the power it's a manifestation it's a gift but it has no power in and of itself so what happens the reason why we've we've taken this whole circular route remember what Jesus said to the priest he says you bind people with the traditions of men and you take away the power when we preach a false evidence of the Holy Spirit we take away the power of the word of God cuz what happens is all people try to do is get to the place where they speak in tongues and they stop short of the fullness of the word of God that's it that's it see people seek the sign or the evidence they think rather than the person of Christ in their life that's really what we're looking for that's what the Holy Ghost is it's the person of Christ in my life so they're wanting this defined experience rather than a sovereign experience listen I know our testimonies was it Souls that are prison that you two listen to so B Bob and sister Brenda get saved under a a a hard message a soul seeking message Souls that are in prison I got saved while listening to brother Barry coffee and brother Donnie Reagan everybody has a different story the word came in a different way a different style a different Ministry whatever it might be many of us got saved by listening to brother Gerald but not everybody did and that does doesn't mean they're out and we're in or they're in and we're out amen we cannot Define how he comes but we what we can Define is what he does when he gets there when we are finally in and we've died out to self then that's the the the commonality that we have and it's that the word comes to life inside of us but the problem today is we've got a me too Christianity and if you don't live the way I live you don't talk the way I talk you don't have the same experience I experience then you're not in and that is not what the word says we can find different experiences of the Believers in the book of Acts just in the first 19 chapters how they got the Holy Ghost where they got the Holy Ghost when it came before baptism after baptism before the preaching of the word they're in Samaria I think a month hearing the Gospel of Jesus Christ but they didn't receive the Holy Spirit till till Peter came everyone has a different experience amen but when we preach an Evidence of tongues we lower the standard to where it's a joke listen I've heard people speak in tongues literally I'm going to say this I'm not trying to be sacriligious and they said they were speaking in tongues this is a well-known woman preacher by the way that's not speaking in tongues give me a break just to call it out that's not speaking in tongues but people will sit there and think she's spiritual because she does it why they've lowered the standard to where anybody can do it all you have to do is go listen to a certain service where somebody speaks and copy it and they'll say you've got the Holy Ghost you won't because you'll know that you're just Faking It but listen you can get to the point where you believe your own fake absolutely true brother Chad that's right you can get to the point where you convince yourself and your conscience sin sear with a hot iron because you want to fit in so bad you won't take the word you'll take your fake experience instead my daughter was telling me that somebody told her yesterday when she was talking to these Pentecostal women late young ladies said I had to go speak in tongues again to make sure I still had the Holy Ghost what a shame what a shame one that she hasn't been taught that you are sealed to the day of your Redemption with the Holy Ghost once you got it you cannot lose it but two that she would go to such a simple experience to confirm to herself that she has it she's been talk completely wrong and she's in bondage because one she thinks she can lose it and two she thinks she has it because she does something that has nothing to do with the baptism of the Holy Ghost what a shame in bondage by the traditions of men sincere people sincerely seeking the Holy Ghost sincerely wanting to serve Christ amen but they sto short of the true baptism of the holy spirit because all they get is an evidence that they've made up and it's not according to the full word of God it's a work of their own lips rather than the work of the holy spirit in their life to strive so hard to get ahead in the word of God and fall short by what a tradition of man a denominational teaching the least of the gifts Paul says this now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular that means every one of us is unique and specifically here for a purpose every single one of us he says and God hath set oh oh my some some so we're not all the same we don't all act the same we don't all have the same gifts we don't all have the same Purp purp we don't all have the same position we don't have the same manifestations of these things God has said some in the church first apostles next prophets third teachers after that Miracles and Gifts of healings helps governments diversities of tongues diversities of tongues does not even mean speaking in tongues that's people that can speak different languages that was a value in that church because they had so many people mixed up in those multitudes how do we know this because we'll see in verse 30 he talks about tongues our are all Apostles is everyone here an apostle nope are all prophets no are all teachers no are all workers of Miracles Sister Mary Beth when's the last time you did a miracle see not all have all the gifts of healing do all speak with tongues do all interpret now the answer to every one of those previous questions up to tongues is no then what's the answer to tongues no so if not all speak with tongues then how can it be the evidence of the Holy Spirit it cannot be scripturally speaking the evidence of the Holy Spirit Paul is clearly saying not everybody does it have all sorry do all interpret he says but covet earnestly the best gifts gifts not evidences gifts he says but yet I show unto you a more EXC excellent way so beyond all of this Beyond every single one of these gifts is a better way and Paul he hammers it home in Corinthians 13:1 1 Corinthians 13:1 though I speak with the tongues of men and angels listen you can speak with a Godly language you can speak with an Earthly language you can speak every language and have not charity Agape the love of the Holy Ghost the personal presence of God in your life he says I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling symbol he says so what you're say what he's saying there is you will be of no purpose to the kingdom of God anybody know what a clanging symbol is like anybody ever ever give your kids a set of symbols where they can just bang them together worst sound ever amen sister Leah has been there worst sound ever annoying drive you nuts I was on 38 he's saying that's what you are if you do all those things but you don't have the Holy Ghost which means you can do them without the Holy Ghost Amen Let me close with this I've read a lot of scriptures today this is very much teaching but I want to emphasize this before we close today they said what is the evidence that a person is really filled with the Holy Ghost he says John 14:26 six when the Holy Ghost is come he will show you things to come now I want you to see how he interprets this I've never seen the scrip I've never read this before now he said see he will perfect it manads won't do it he is the word when the Holy Ghost is come he will identify himself in you with the scripture and that is the true sign that the holy spirit is in you because it is the word now remember I preached just before that I believe this was a two-fold scripture where the holy spirit will show you things to come because the word shows us what's to come amen we can see what's coming by the word it'll show us by a spirit of Prophecy amen that's what the the the the spirit of Jesus Christ is a is a spirit of Prophecy the revelation of Jesus Christ is a spirit of Prophecy I should say so it shows us what's ahead of us but the Holy Ghost is not just a spirit of Prophecy it's a spirit of fulfillment that's what he's saying here he will perfect it how does God interpret his word church by bringing it to pass so he doesn't just hang us out there by telling us what's to coming and we never receive it but rather he shows us what is there what is available what's coming and then he brings it to reality brings it into fulfillment into our lives amen we'll get to see that what the Holy Spirit has spoken comes true he'll perfect it he'll bring it to maturity he'll bring it to reality he says now look what if you spoke with tongues I just want to ask you that Jesus said when the Holy Ghost come what he would do and what if you spoke with tongues jumped up and down shouted and everything else and then come to the word and I'd prove to you by the scripture as I have that the baptism using the title of Father Son and Holy Ghost is absolutely a misunderstanding in the scripture nobody was ever baptized like that and you go ahead and hang with it anyhow he says could you tell me the holy spirit in you would do a thing like that how can it deny its own word listen God doesn't hold you accountable for what you don't know but when he brings it your way if you are a holy ghost filled believer you'll correct it this is why I've said before I believe you can have the Holy Ghost outside of the revealed word but it will bring you into the revealed word amen I don't believe brother Vel is here by Chance the spirit leads a child of God to the word amen how can it deny its own he says he says what is that he says you're committing adultery against your own body and when a woman goes out and lives with another man or a man with another woman when they're married to them they are when they're married to another they are defiling their own flesh and when a person says that he is a Christian and will absolutely deny the scripture being right he's committing adultery against the body that he claims to be in he says see so it's a mark of antichrist so much that would deceive the elected if possible amen God bless you stand if you would the musicians can come this has been very much teaching I know that certainly some preaching Blended in there and I trust we know these things but you know what I don't know what our young people know and don't know I don't know what's been preached since before I came here necessarily I know we've always been taught by Brother Gerald that it's not the evidence but sometimes we need to just roll through these things in the scripture and let the scripture interpret itself amen but this is really setting us up for the third ser third uh service on this because you I've said brother you know that that the evidence brother B says the evidence the scripture says the evidence of the holy spirit is that you receive the word but what does that look like because we all want an Evidence listen I know I'm married because I have a wife and I have a ring I have evidence that I'm married I have experiences that show that I'm married and when it comes to our relationship with God I believe we all want an Evidence but I will tell you this in the end you're going to have to have a personal revelation in the end that's it there is no one evidence that you could give right now today that says you're going all the way except the faith of God in your heart that says I've met him he's working with me and he's given me his word but I want to break it down you know me I yes I I love the Mysteries but I want to break it down as a pastor to where we're living Day by day not to give you un evidence but to give you what the scripture says about what happens when a person is filled with the holy spirit amen and hopefully that'll help us so we want to know what it looks like when we've received the word because some people will say well it's just going to church and you've received the end time message and and you've heard the word of God for our day and that means you've got the Holy Ghost no sir it does not absolutely it does not but that is UN evidence because you will hear the word for your day after that then we're going to go into questions and answers on the Holy Spirit how do I know I'm being led of the spirit how do I find the will of God in my life can I backslide and still have the Holy Ghost can I make mistakes and have the Holy Ghost can I have personal flaws and still have the Holy Ghost these different things because that's the places where Satan beats us up is our day-to-day lives and so I want to take the scriptures and I want to beat him back not to give license but to show you where God's Gra grace and mercy is and to give you a road back when not if but when you have your moments we've all sinned and come short of the glory of God we sin every single day and that I mean we step away from the word but there's a blood covering that he can't see it and there's a holy ghost power inside of us that will raise us above it day by day step by step line by line word by word amen and that's where we're going God bless you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we want certainty Lord we want to know that we know that we know Lord that our Eternal destination has been set by the indwelling power of your Holy Spirit Lord we want to know that our soul is sealed Lord and in doing that Lord we want to look away from everything that's contrary to that testimony but Lord I pray you give us a true testimony Lord that we would know in our heart of hearts that we have received your word that your word is working by the Holy Spirit to produce a body change Lord I pray you lift us to a higher plane Lord I pray as we seek Lord so we would find help us to be truly sincere Lord as Christ said not hearers only but doers also Lord that if we love you we'll keep your word we'll hear your word we'll apply your word Lord that we'll walk out those doors and we'll live the same life out there that we profess in here Lord make us real Christians I pray Lord that we could show others that you're alive and well strengthen us Lord give us a testimony Lord give us the words to speak as we give a witness for the hope that lies within us I pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen by his word 1260 by his word I [Music] Prevail by his
