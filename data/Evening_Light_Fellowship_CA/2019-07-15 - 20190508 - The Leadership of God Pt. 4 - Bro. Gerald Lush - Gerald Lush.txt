we get into the word we're going to sing only believe again and but just to pass on greetings from our brother Willie McGowan he's the pastor in Whitehorse in the Yukon I spoke with him last night on the phone and I mean we we spoke and talked for over an hour and I guess we're administering and preaching one to the other that's why we were so long but he sends his greetings for the st. cyr and so I did ask you to pass on greetings to our sister Susan and brother Phillip power and of course the brother Dwayne that is his song leader in Whitehorse because brother Dwayne was here for a month I believe was this year two years ago I can't recall but he was he was a fine brother nice spirit a man so the grace of God to him now our brother Willie you know he's pastoring a small assembly and much smaller than the one that we're here in tonight so we pray the grace of God to him as he ministers to them and I am also familiar with the pastor that was there before him and brother Don and what was the last name sister Betty phablets brother Don Bab let's write and he was the brother that I met in in brother ro Hildebrand's convention in 1988 and I was moving on at the time through the vestibule we're we're in a universe the building and a room there and but he caught up with me and he said brothers just want to share some thoughts with you and he said and to thank you and the brothers and and the Assembly in st. John's for what you've done and it was a brother dawn that informed me he said I don't know if you're aware of it or not but he said as a result of what you brethren have done and the material that we printed and sent overseas and it was quite quite a bit of that we printed and at one point there we did the Brethren did print and I believe brother Mark typed it and into the language to get the kiss Wally is a Swahili Swahili in the Swahili language and there was we there was three different booklets and we they did I think brother mark typed in I saw him one time in the basement of his mother's and father's old house and he was typing it in in the in that language amazing and we printed three ten thousand of each so that was thirty thousand in Swahili and he said brethren and not only that those books because in 1997 her brother met me at the convention in in Phoenix and thank me thank me for it and because of he said it's still going those books and he said no only that it was it was the first message material he said in our language so that's encouraging to the brothers and I drove to our brother mark here for sure for taking the time to do what he did amazing and but our brother Don said brother as a result of what you've done and all the Missouri who printed and sent overseas he said you brethren have started over three hundred churches he said in Africa and he said they're still growing that was in nineteen eighty eight so I would imagine there's a lot a lot more churches there now amen so god bless the Saints in Africa and we pray God rests our brother Don balances soul because he was in Africa and he was either ministering or he was they called him off the pray I'm not sure and he died in the pulpit he had a heart attack so we pray God rest his soul and put it this way I would believe by the grace of God that he's in he's he's got more joy now than we do or not yeah we've got we've got a measure of the joy that he's experiencing without measurement a man so God God rest his soul so our brother really is is ministering and pastoring in that area now as our brother Don did many years ago so he sends his greetings and we enjoyed the fellowship one to another and and thank the Lord the quote a quote there was a quote that I was looking for regarding the rapture and the resurrection and that I just couldn't find it I knew I had it somewhere but I couldn't didn't know where it was well I mentioned it to our brother Willie and started the quote he finished it and and he sent me down by email after he sent me down to a copy of the quote and where it was so sometimes might want to share that with you because it has to do with the rapture and the resurrection and I'm not what a blow be it will be the actual resurrection and the actual rapture itself and some comments said the prophet of God made and concerning how it's going to happen what's going to be happening you know regarding the living Saints and those that are gone on and Jesus and I said oh I oh I said I've been in the last few years I've been trying to remember where that was and that quote and I believe it was the quote was in questions and answers 1964 in Jeffersonville so I would share that with you some other time by the grace of God and some other thoughts as well on the rapture because it is serious but it comes to the when it comes to the rapture listen God's not requiring of us just what he what he in a sense he is but but he's required more of us than he did of any other age because he is revealed more to us than than any other age we got where he's requiring what they had plus what he has given us in this hour and in this age a man it is the progressive revelation of God right from Genesis to Revelation and right from the first church age right down down to the to the Lord of C&H and to the bride age by the grace of God so brother it's tremendous it is the faith that pleases God when we when we get the revelation of who we are and where we are in God's plan amen so you and brother sister God reveals it to the beginning and God reveals it to the end there's the Alpha there's the Omega the Omega but the others that the others they're just going on by faith as God reveals the word they did go on and witness for the word witness for the word witness for the word because that's what God required of them I'm going to reveal this to you I want you to go out and be a witness for it amen and but now there comes a generation that he reveals the word and brother now what are we get what are we doing were its to give us the faith for the resurrection and the rapture amen it to get out of here to finish it true brothers sister so more is required of us than was required of the others all they had plus a man so it's a tremendous responsibility a man so brothers nots and please in the name of the Lord don't take it lightly whatever you do you need to be and if you do if you're taking lately and you and you just take the same attitude that they had in Luther's day Wesley's day the Pentecostal day well you're gonna miss the rapture you're gonna miss the resurrection most definitely because why because they believed and went on and breached amen we got to believe and go on and bring the resurrection in the rapture into manifestation that's our believing for the change of their body amen praise the name of the Lord so I'll bring in more thoughts on that regarding regarding us getting together with the Saints that are that are gone on a man and that's the quote that I was looking for and again it is in in the questions than answers 1964 a man but I want to tonight by the grace of God to try and get into the message on the leadership and to finish it because there's other things we want to do regarding something that brother Alec and read highlighted on the internet and something brother Matthew had highlighted also on the Internet I want to get bring those things in and I have also I mentioned to a while ago that we wanted our brother Chad to finish his testimony amen and so I don't know if one service would be enough for him but we'll see so keep keep our brother Chad in prayer a man so by the grace of God so the Lord blesses and I showed this to you a number of years ago but I guess some of you didn't didn't see it or didn't notice it and this is dated December the 29th 1965 and this was the evening news and the front page was dealing with a memorial for William Branham and remember this that he the Winterbottom just he physically died in the in the vehicle accident just just a few days before this and this was the gathering in Batam tavern Akal and it said it is the final respects paid to it says reverent Branham and in the evenin this there's an interview with a Roman Catholic bishop a man who spoke very highly of William Branham and of wet winter Browns attitude and William Branham spirit and he said if just anyone you met and talked to and knew that they had love he said it was william branham he said he said it's just it was just his spirit it was just his nature it was his character he had divine love that was the evidence of the Holy Ghost in him a man so brother they spoke more and more I guess the better of him with a better attitude in the spirit then then even some Pentecostals a man because you know why because there's a lot of Pentecostals and nondenominational interdenominational they felt that William Branham was taken off the scene because of what he preached they felt that his ministry was was of God the the signs and the wonders that he had the gifts that he had the discernment of the thoughts and intents of the heart and now remember not just present tense but past future past and future tense amen he God revealed this country of that and of course you know about the sign he had in his hand and and many people saw that and but they believed it was God because he would take he would take your hand into his your left hand and and and he would things would happen on his hand and it was shown and revealed to other Branham what was wrong with that person and he would pray for them and when they were healed what was going on on his aim would be gone his aim would go back to normal amen so they believe that the gifts were of God they believe the ministry that ministry was of God but they were refused to accept his teaching a man and remembering of course as I had mentioned to you before that that a very popular and well-known evangelist did tell William Branham to stop preaching what he was preaching and and a prophet of God told the Evangelist he said brother somebody got to preach at the pastor's not doing it so he said I got to do it a man and so on but that that evangelist didn't agree with William Branham and what he was teaching and most evangelists didn't agree with William Branham and what he was teaching well I do thank God for and some of us do know and maybe if you got a man Marie our brother TL Osborn now I must say he had he had respect for brother Branham he did not agree with brother ran around a lot of things but he had respect for him a man so we I believe God will reward the brother for that for sure a man so the so thank God brother this is history for to a lot of people a man is history to us but thank God the word is not history the word what God did through this man is still in the present tense and what God is doing is still in the present tense because God is what God is dealing with his bride a man through what he did for true William Branham a man and there are there's many in the congregation here of course the building is full and there's many there of course that that I would maybe recognize if I look at them long enough that were preachers and evangelists back there in that day so thank God for the prophet a man and and remember again he his ministry was to the bride and also remember this he said we won't reach everyone with this message he said only the bride exactly but God has got others out there to preach to declare the word to the whole world because the bar business is going to go around the world they would receive a witness of the truth around the world and that's why it's in those magazines and on the radios and the televisions the talking about Jesus talking about this in the Bible that in the Bible talking about the Bible as well amen so it's the witness going around the world but the message and the messenger of the Malachi four it's only to the bride so you've got to be led by the time with leadership you got to be led by the Spirit regarding to whom you witness to a man you just adjust to the seat of God the elect of God Jesus didn't witness to everyone he just witnessed to the elect in his day a man and brother your sister you and I are witnessing to the election our day and especially of this age because he's going to climax with the resurrection and the rapture a man thank God for the word amen and what he's done amen

Timothy chapter 3 2nd Timothy chapter 3 amen and this see if by the grace of God I can be a notes preacher instead of inspiration well we need the inspiration even on the notes Amen praise the Lord so in 2nd Kurt in 2nd Timothy chapter 3 and verse 1 familiar Scripture but it says this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come so we need only goes leadership in these perilous times for men it says shall be lovers of their own selves a man and they are their lovers are their own selves and their own knowledge and their own revelation oh there they they they are they'll lift themselves up they'll exalt themselves but brother if we got it in our hearts not in our heads we'll humble ourselves for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection trucebreakers false accusers incontinent fierce despisers of those that are good this is absolutely brother sister the description of the of this generation in this age a mayor it's not like it used to be this is the end it is finished and we'll give you another scripture to show you why that it's in this condition and it says traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God professing a love for God but they're lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God religious but not spiritual a man and it says they have a form of godliness a man but denying the power thereof many a believer as a form of godliness and denying the power of the Resurrection the power of the rapture a man that's why there's only going to be a few living Saints that will go in the rapture amen because they have a form of godliness but they are denying the power anything their brothers do you don't do is don't deny the power we need the power of the blood of Jesus that's the Holy Ghost by the grace of Almighty God repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost a man by the very few that are truly repenting they have a form of godliness and they might go to a church a Mayan and but most today will stay away from the church and and just just going under the internet a man and try to use that as a as a as a justification for their faith a man the proto God's in no way he said in and III may be sure that quote with you to sometime if I can find it and he said he said we're don't care where you are and he said on a Sunday he said you don't go out a fish you don't go out and do this you don't go out and do that he said go to church he said wherever you are amen and then again you got believers that are allegedly almost same everywhere all over the Western world and maybe even even in the even in Africa or the other countries and and they and them one bother to go to church they don't have that burden they don't have that cry they don't have that hunger they don't have that search a man but if you're the seat of God and you got the Holy Ghost in your heart you want it a menu you want you wanna you want to go to church you want the fellowship you want to hear the word a man for the grace of God brother help us not just to have a form of godliness and deny the power but will be led by the power and you guys you got the Holy Ghost in your heart you're gonna be hanging and he's leading he's gonna need you to church he's gonna live avi a may not be a church all together might be a cottage meeting but well you will you're gonna you're gonna find out wherever you go there are there any believers here Amen that's right are they believers sir we'd like to go and have fellowship with believers anymore if there's anything better that the see of God wants it wants fellowship anything the feet of God wants anyway want stir once wants to get any into worship and we're with believers talk about the Lord table the things of God a may rejoice over the over the resurrection and the render rapture a man what God has done and what God is doing hey man listen saints of God and we're ordained for the resurrection rapture we are we ought to be experiencing God every day in our lives amen praise the name of the Lord God in our minds God in our thoughts God in our souls God in our spirits oh thank you Jesus thank you Jesus a man you'll drop this song here drop that thought amen oh I pray in the name of Jesus we're not going to leave him here when we go to the door amen I play you he came with you amen you didn't come to meet him you come with you a man to fellowship he come with you sure there watch to bring us into the spirit of worship and it says in the last days concerning the perilous times they'll have a form of godliness but denying the power their love and it says such turn away no from such turn away the bride will be separated on to the Lord amen before the resurrection for the rapture amen and it says again verse 6 for of this sort are they which crept into houses and led captive silly women laden with sins led away with divers lusts amen no wonder the Bible aghasura is a woman's world and what the women are like that's where the churches are like a man because the church is that the women train type the church that's right because we're out of it again he Jesus calls his brain a man and the and the earthly bride is going to be easy as United with the heavenly bridegroom a man from this sort are they which crept into houses and led see the leadership they came under and it says lead captives silly women laden with sins or unbelief and led away with divers lusts whether not just sexual lust but mercy after the things of the world he that loves the world the things of the world the love of God not in him any man and brother and I've studied that verse and Anna's and it says it's not when it comes to loving the world the things of the world he says loving the ways of the world loving the you know the order of the world like the way of the world does this does that does that or they said the if you love that he said in the love of God's not in you a man because anything we're looking for is God's leadership not man's leadership amen and then then the love the world of things of the world is the lo the leadership of man the leadership of the devil in men amen and it says there literally with divers lusts and ever alert as he does let's go beyond this idea oh that's that's that's sexual lusts and no no it's lost in after you lost after money you can left after after after clothing you can lost after planting anything a man my brother listen listen let's cry out for the for the resurrection and rap for an eternity by the grace of God hey man anything you want more than anything else it's Evan it is Jesus but no notice it says they are verse 7 they are ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth hey man the Bible says give wisdom but get understanding a man ever learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth ever learning they're learning what spiritual things religious things but not getting to the truth what God wants into to believe amazing brother we're living in that day we live in a tower ever learning never able to come to the knowledge and it's the correct and vital knowledge of the truth not just not a indolent electoral knowledge the correct and vital knowledge spiritual and as Janus and dreamers withstood Moses so do these also resist the truth medical up nines reprobate concerning the faith god bless his words you may be seated and those and maintained second Timothy chapter four and understanding that Janus and Jambres were Jews but they were withstood Moses amen and they were doing what was right in their own eyes but not following the leadership of God in the prophet Moses a man and there are those again today that are doing what's right in their own eyes but they're not following the leadership of God through them through the messenger of this hour and of this age and they're not following the leadership of gods for the fire the true rifle ministry there is a false rifle ministry and there is a true fifl ministry a my answers make sure that we're under a member of the true faithful ministry that is pointing us to the word getting us into the word to strain with the word and what is it it is the revelation that he that is going to be focused on the resurrection and the rapture as Luther's was focused on justification Wesley was focused on sanctification and then the Pentecostals the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the games but now we're focused on the resurrection and the rapture amen and as nigel being focused on this doctrine or the doctrine the Surrency or the other oneness of the god it and because they put the emphasis on that and they preach it and they preach it and they preach it but brother that's judge that's just getting us from here to there that's getting us out of the church how do they out of a denominational real world because Lola they're false and they have false teachings and they are false this and false that but you know the prophet of God had the truth and they will come out and go to a church this preaching the message of the Prophet amen but they're all there do all they're doing is they're learning the letter of the word but they're not getting into the faith of the word then I get into the revelation the faith that God has ordained in the message of the hour and it is to give us resurrection and reprieve ain't a man brother he got Luther in their justification it got whiskey into sanctification hallelujah brother they they were they were getting closer and closer and closer to Eternity amen God put him in contact with eternity and they rely all Jesus Lord Jesus you're my justifier you justified me it's not what I do is what I believe amen god sanctified me and it's not what I do that sanctifies me is what I believe by the grace of Almighty God a man and when it comes to the baptism of the Holy Ghost of the gifts of the Spirit amen it is the life Alleluia the Holy Ghost the evidence of the Holy Ghost is believing the word there is are the Holy Ghost is following Jesus Davis of the Holy Ghost is really like Jesus now it's not usually this crazy live within you through the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen see a God said I'm going to restore a made perfect sons and daughters praise the name of the Lord I'm gonna bring the hallelujah from the darkness they were in from the grave that they were in not only naturally but spiritually God is going to raise them up Alleluia until we under he will bring a ministry that would give us resurrection enrapturing faith hallelujah they had faith to believe what God had done for them there and we got faith to believe over what God is doing for us here anymore we're gods look down and God saw them they had that faith they were justified amen they were sanctified and it was there it was according to their faith and they live justified lives they live sanctified lives they live the lives of those baptized with the Holy Ghost and they didn't give the glory to me and they gave the glory to God amen amen thank you lord I thought I had to do this I thought I had to do that but lord I discovered now in the word that you did it all hey man you did it all and all you asked me to do was believe it all you asked me to do is accept it a man and then if I did in my heart he my soul you would come in and you would live out a justified life a made that brother that sister would go and they would they they would go out there condemned no and put down by the devil they go over there just a fight I'm justifying how do you lose you I believe God a man I believe the Word of God I believe I am saying not I will be saved I am saying Amen not I will be this I am then I will receive this I am a vain a man today that's what God was looking for he was looking for that faith because Luther was why they there they were going out and they were who do he works and they thought if I did this work and I did that work if I did this regard of that for God he would justify me no no he did it in Jesus anybody because are as the works were made where was was as much seen as man once because we were born in sin shaped in iniquity come to the world was making lies amen and it was nothing about seeing in our flesh amen David David made his confession and he said Lord he said in sin did my mother conceive me I was mother was more to shape than iniquity come to the world speaking lies and so on amen brother sister but God was God was bringing Lutheran and the church to the revelation they had lost during the Dark Ages when there when the Roman Church begin to take over when the Roman Catholic Church and in this denomination that denomination another denomination and they're going to take over a man and the people away from the 32y they were going to say to their doctrines to the letter of the word as they were going to teach it a million but brother the just shall live by faith amen the sanctified also live by faith because there is not what we do is what he's done and I have accepted it in my heart in my soul I've accepted is justification I've accepted he is sanctification the devil is there to continue the devil is Erika near me a man vicar and brother you persuade a lot of so-called believers even that they're not justified that they're not sanctified that they are down no no why is he pointing to your flesh and he's getting you to figure these thoughts in your mind he's pointy he's trying to get you to go by your your senseless and brother and if I did this if I'm living in a sinful body my senses are sinful and they are and they are as exactly the truth and my marina thoughts can be simple today there with the devil's influence a man might senseless and do this and do that and make us believe you know what God will remind you to do this God won't mind that you know you don't have to do this you don't have to do that and so on try to try and lead us to believe you'll be alright amen because you're good yeah you're good yeah yeah my father always said you're good good for what he says you're good or good for nothing and and I will come to any goodness that we got brothers Gardens God looking into our souls amen God looked into Martin Luther soul and the Lutheran's and the Methodists or the Pentecostals in order to their soul to love to see and a the the faith of believing what he had revealed in their day and in their power amen oh brother so we got to understand what God is doing how God does it amen whether it's Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden where's Abel outside the garden whether whether there's a knock walking with God whether whether is Noah you know there with the earth with the Ark of the Covenant and so on oh my god Elvis he not Robert God was not God took it what a lot of water while he did oh my amazingamazing what leadership was he under oh my was that the devil wasn't leading him and I'll tell you this his family wasn't leading him and man wasn't leading him not by any means now even though he had to do this that wasn't it that wasn't in control he just did what God wanted to do when God wanted him to do it and how aware a million he thought the gods leadership anybody not my real father don't be done oh praise the Lord he talked personally he said it all the time no matter what come up no matter what the decision no matter what he had you know and there were there were maybe the day he had to deal with the devil - oh yeah if I had a man he dealt with the devil and Cain and Abel a to deal with the devil a man named brother the other said the deal was Satan so brother I saw that Enoch any man sober sister and he's here to get you to down he's here to get you to get you to be religious but not spiritual he's there to get you to believe you know what God you know 99% of what God said you know plus a little a little here a little there a man see Cigna is not there to get you to like atheists you know that's absolutely that's absolutely serpent seed a man to say that you're in eight years I don't believe in God I don't believe this is heart say the death the devil is not worried about that person no not by any means he's not worried about the atheists he's not worried about those those are there anybody what he's concerned about are those who profess to believe God what he's after as those are those who profess to have faith a man and he's there to get it out of out of their hearts and get it into their hands amen it's gauge their to get him the gold not by the Spirit of God but they were led by his spirit and his anointing amen and he's gonna he's gonna focus on on your thoughts he's gonna focus on your feelings but not your faith anybody because he's going to try and destroy your faith he's trying to take away pain show your game by taunt you're going by feelings but not by thus saith the Lord Amen that's the only way we can defeat the devil is thus said the Lord the only way we can defeat the devil as it is written amen the Word of God and you got to say we're faith that you believe it a man that you believe it but we're living in a world that doesn't believe the the Bible they don't believe the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth anybody they'll believe this and believe that Plus and they'll add to it and they'll still explain it this way they'll interpret it this way amen but not all of it brother sister because they're there they'll they'll read the Bible skip that and they'll skip that oh you know I like that they're that rich Psalms but I mean they're going to read The Book of Daniel amen by the sister and oh yeah yeah they'll do they might read proverbs but not the book of that not not Isaiah and there might be another book that they'll read there but they're not going to not going to not going to read The Book of Jeremiah the weeping prophet amen and they'll skip this and skip that and brother the same thing with the revealed word and again we know that we got to take this and put it in air Amen so that it blends with look with the word of God the original trim amen and again as I said I said I might say you know a lot of believers you know when the one day when they got to get a book what they should do is that you started I have the last page yeah yeah because all they're interested in is signs and wonders so they'll start with it with the prayer line you know this one was the only discerned this he discerned that and so on or and then again there's a lot of the so-called believers that they were getting a read they'll read they are there that paragraph then they'll just I like the other one they'll skip that but it's not being registered in their heart anyway today they're getting they're getting the thoughts of it and the ideas of it in their minds but it's not as not going into the heart to give them the pain that God is looking for a man it gives them the faith to bring them out of the nomination condemned the nomination a man but again as the Prophet said you can be how do it and still a part of it because you've got to save the spirit of it amen I pray God in the name of the Lord that we don't have the spirit of what we come out of a man that we got the Holy Spirit we got the Holy Ghost amen and the emphasis is going to be the word the word the word the word they're going to forget what you come out of when it comes to the teaching any man and we're going to let God give you the new thoughts on the word the revealed word anybody they comes by hearing the word by hearing hearing by the word by the grace of God amen saying I that's how God leads us that's how a little Luther that's how he led Wesley that's how he laid all the others down through the ages amen you know the story of Luther going in and opened the Bible and it's all that one verse to just shall live by faith and he and he wrote down alone or only on the side I'm Dominic in E in the side of the Bible yeah amazing but you know what there was a time to do it and he took and he took such a stand for that day justification by faith that they were going to kill him oh yeah he was brought up before the council in the church there and and he said he said he's there I stand I can do no other and he said that he said the word says god said jesus said this is the word and I can do no other but believe the word anybody and they were going to kill him that's right but God had somebody there to take him and hide him away hey man praise the Lord but he but it didn't change his faith he still had the joy of justification Wesley had the joy of sanctification and the baptism of the Pentecostals the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit amen they don't have that joy today the day they had back then not by any means now they're just cold and religious and it's your your wretched miserable and naked and so on and he said you say you're rich and increased with Goods than that need of nothing but he sees your net you're not you're not cold and you're not out you're lukewarm that's the church a man well brother after a while they got cold and they are cold now oh yeah so cold that they get that they got they've started closing churches oh yeah Pentecostal churches have closed that's amazing and other denominational churches have closed why because the people are the people that attended just don't attend anymore hey man because the numbers have gone down down down brother and and we know that that well well it will happen in the message too and when it comes through the numbers of people like but the prophet of God said God's gonna have God is gonna use this small churches amen so I trust with the grace of God he's using us amen brother it's really little understand that word that we're following the leadership of God not in the leadership of the devil and Satan is right there all y'all say was this that people take the message and the arena and they'll skip a paragraph and all they're gonna do is I like this quote and I like this one and forget the rest a man we got to take it all brother amen we got to believe it all by the grace of God it's like I I never I don't think I finished what I was telling you on Sunday and I vote the woman that was that was wearing those I heel shoes and that she wanted she's felt that she could go up those three steps and she could walk the path to glory amen she felt she could do it the Father God said no you can not dare because he knew what she didn't know a man because she was looking at the bath right here and it was maybe I don't know maybe two or three feet or whatever it was wide and and she said I could do it and he and she pushed the Prophet out of the way and she started walking and any and he had warned her and she walked and walk she thought the path down there was just as wide as it was here a man the pyramid exactly brother is this way but it gets more narrow and more now hey man that's the truth brother and as the same thing with this woman then she started to walk down down down and actually walk oh what's going on here because the paths begin to get more and more and more narrow amen brother the closer we get to the resurrection of rapture the more narrow the path amen straight is the way and narrow is the gate that leads to lay a few there be that find it hey man oh they thought it was going to be this way there all the way down but she realized he was getting more and more and actually but she kept on going kept on going and she was fighting to keep her balance hey man under Valley because of watch two shoes she was wearing she lost her balance and the prophet saw her fall over into the fire yeah she went into the fire brother is make sure we're not wearing spiritual high-heeled shoes hey man all your spiritual high-heeled shoes absolute assurance you know I'm this tall no you're not I'm this big no you're not no yeah I just got see you anybody that is going to see you it's not a man as senior as God see you well that's good when God looks at you here tonight what does God see this is she sons and daughters of God amen is he seeing the new creatures in Christ is he seeing the reflection of the word in you in your heart in your soul your hunger your thirst for the resurrection Iraq that's what God is looking for absolutely that's right I'm looking just to see if you believe you know this doctrine you believe that doctrine no do you believe what I am I have focused on in the Ministry of Malachi for do you believe what I have focused on in the opening of the seven seals focused on in the in the mystery of God amen the resurrect what the resurrection and right Sharifi a man is for the public are through there and I already gave you the quote and it sure the third pole is to give you wrap through faith a man it is and we think the third pole is their third pole is the opening of the word the third pole is there is the breaking of the seven seals yeah it is but what was it ordained to do and reveal this it reveal this Amen every deal this this this know first we will reveal all of this all the ages and then he come into the seal to reveal all the seals a man from the first church age for the last search age a man and into the bride age until finally what is it it's the resurrection and the rapture Amen brothers sister praise the name of the Lord its and and the people just they're focusing on this this this but whatever this divine love brother that's what led lit Jesus to do what he did 2,000 years ago anyway and that's why when he come back he kept asking Peter lovest thou me lovest thou me and twice he said agape love divine love and once when at the third time he said figlio you human love a man and a man he creates Hallett's and a me and he let Peter know he was going to get something and he got he got the baptism of divine love he got the raptures of of Agape love divine love on the day of Pentecost and he was different then a man he was a new creature then a man brother sister Jesus wouldn't have to say to Peter get thee behind me Satan no more anymore Satan was gone and God was it well God was in control of Peter a man it's a it's Satan's influence in your life if from the inside is he gone is he just if he's just there to influence you on the outside now he's always be there Arthur were changed into glorified bodies oh yes he's obviously focusing on the under physical amen and on the intellectual is there but brother sister what about in your heart it's Christ on the throne of your heart amen bless if he's if he's not then you one sit with him in his room he's got to be on the throne of your heart in control and if he's on the throne of your heart he's leading oh yeah no matter what you do no matter when you do it where you doing how you doing here you led by the spirit he's in control he's in control and it's not just being led by the spirit in Doctrine and in this and in that yeah I believe that I believe that yeah but what about everyday what about way is he living in you well understand understand the the extent of what it meant when he said it's not me that lives as Christ that liveth in me anyway because he Co he himself could not go out and live that life any man but there but Christ in him he didn't say Christ with him many many believe all gods with me the Lord is with me Christ is with me ya know he's in me hallelujah hallelujah he'll interview that's what we need every man it's crazy to me the hope of glory not Christ with me praise the name of the Lord that's why he came and that's what he did what he did he laid down his life and picked it up again and he came back with the life of his blood and he put his life in you he came in you amen is Christ in me the hope of glory brother is not his doctrine is not his justice thoughts intellectually but it's it's it's the life of Christ himself brother god help us amen by the grace of God not to have a form of godliness and deny the power to control you in your life during the day that's right and those that don't have that anointing will be critical of those that do oh yeah they will or they hey what's wrong dude they think you're here you're being too spiritual not spiritual no ha ha ha wish we could get more spiritual but more spiritual in what we do more spirits and what we say more Spurgeon and how we think and how we talk oh yeah more spiritual so why Susu it's not you as Christ I don't know doesn't make a difference where you are and what you're doing it's Christ's doing it that's amazing it's Jesus just think of that and then some people will they'll pull back and they don't want to be like this didn't want to be like that I don't I don't want to leave the impression that I'm RELIGIOUS you know I'm a I'm a fanatic Oh what where's Christ is he we're in control you you you you and you do it like Christ you talk like Christ ain't mean I don't mean you gonna talk religious but you're gonna be straightforward you're gonna be honest when you're talking well and you're gonna you're gonna say I believe what we should do this I believe we should do that well it's not you saying that is the Lord but again they don't think it's you you know because you're controlled by a and another anointing it's an anointing in your mind your soul your spirit anybody it's annoying of the Holy Ghost and again the Prophet God I light of the fact and he did draw it out somewhere that we are that we are three a man you are a soul and a spirit and your body and God wants to get into your soul to control your spirit to control your body amen we are we we are we are three gods gods manifested in three not three persons three hits three attributes Father Son and Holy Ghost and so we are also manifested in three there's this it is the soul there's the spirit the human spirit and the body and and when you're born again is Christ comes in must the devil out and he's controlling your spirit and he's answer your spirit he's controlling your body and your thoughts amen so brother how can you go and do what you do and work what you work and and and not reflect God in simplicity yeah Christ Christ and it's not not just when people think all that's religious and you're always trying a religion and you always talk with the vow and know you're gonna live the Bible you just live it automatic Oh brothers sister grace to us that is that it is Christ in me and without it you have no hope it's Christ in me the hope of glory by the grace of Almighty God so brother let him have control a man well if he's in your heart he's going to have control your borned again you're a new creature anybody now I'm not - some really if you're born again I'm not the son of Hedley of Stella lush I'm the son of God anyway if you're born again you're not the son of this this man and woman no no you're just you're you're you're the son and daughter of God hey man that's what we were from the beginning and we're going to go back oh yeah praise the name of the Lord hallelujah god help us brothers sisters sorry what what no I didn't realize that lead in 2nd Timothy chapter 4 why is it perilous times why is it a form of godliness and no power ever learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth the correct and vital knowledge of the truth amen is because of the leadership anointing that they're under and in 2nd Timothy chapter 4 verse 1 I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom tremendous those quotes that our brother Willie shared with me I'll get along and I'll share them with share them with you again amen absolutely tremendous a challenge to our faith and he preach the word be instant in season and the instant out of season don't go by your feelings go by your faith a man oh I don't feel like this I don't feel like that what you're not going by feeling you're going by faith hey man that's why you got to walk in the spirit live in the spirit so that it's the Holy Ghost controlling you and not your feelings and or your senses hey man that's right but there's too many brother you just watch how they act and react to this and this and this all that shows that that shows that dirt dirt dirt you're walking by they're by the flesh but they're not walking in the spirit he not led by the spirit see it's like it's like the man one time that the prophet of God I know elderly man and he was talking to him about certain thing and he wasn't a Christian at the time but the prophet of God was bringing out some things there to him and it wasn't very I Lee what we call spiritual but the prodigal was challenging him concerning what he believed and how he believed anyway what it did was he became a Christian he humbled himself acknowledging his need of Jesus oh whatever the Prophet said to him he realized on a sinner in need of salvation and he got saved and some time later the prophet of God met a woman I don't know if it is his wife for a daughter and she what she said she said you're William Branham yes he said oh I've got something to tell you she said about this man and so on all she said he's gone to be with the Lord but I wanted to tell you she said that when he was dying he raised his hands and he praised the Lord and he was worshiping God and he said right to the end the problem God's had always said that's exactly what should be anybody so that's the way it should be hey man brother if you got your consciousness let's let's give God the glory a man to God be the glory a man is like sister Dunford when she was going and I and I took the tape recorder up and I put a tape on of old-fashioned hymns inner ear that the air the air you hate the airing there and she was listening and she was smiling oh yeah just shortly before the Lord took her but she was smiling to her it was praise the Lord anybody why he well it was feeding her faith it was strengthening her faith it was encouraging her faith hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah and I guess that I've witnessed the past he number many many believers and even our brother clogged hallelujah and what they had in his room he kept looking at right here in front of the bed on the wall there was was a picture of Hoffman said of Christ and yeah in the hospital that was in the hospital and even the nurses come in and the nurses pointed to the picture of of off instead of Christ and they said that's all right mr. Yale you've got nothing to worry about because he's here he said Jesus even the nurses I said why yeah and he would smile he would say a man that's right his faith was in God praise the name of the Lord and there's others to a witness they're going and their faith was him God praise the Lord oh yes brother burns hallelujah Haiti six years old myself sister Betty there and his sons and two daughters always all of my family is here now and he raised he raised his hand oh and he and he was laughing he was smiling and he and he called out to his wife Julie Julie he said I'm coming he said to meet you he said I'll be there soon and he was on his way and he was in that he was in that special care in the Grand Falls hospital there yeah and and he and we and he started this song and we stood and he sang the verses and we sang the course yeah and and my oh my and he is that one arm he couldn't couldn't raise but he another arm he could and when we went to leave I said brother Barnes I said I've got to go back to the city and I said so I'll be back again a few days I said so I said I want you to wait till like home and he and he looked at me and he smiled Oh a big smile and he said old brother he said he said III I can't promise you that he said that's in the hands of the Lord and he was smiling a man no fear no no he was looking for he was looking forward to it he was going home to be with the Lord I don't know yet I'll show you it's just so close to the Prophet where he's explaining what exactly is is going on right here now and where they are in that theophany body he said you can't see them now they don't see us either but he said they're in another dimension and he said they're there but he said the hours coming the hours coming he said when when they're going to appear to us and we're gonna see them and they're gonna call us he said they're gonna call us God and he said that's when he said we'll we'll go right into theophany and all of us with them in a glorified body and we'll be with them that's one of the quotes our brother sent me will be with will be with them and he said waiting but for all we think well we're going to experience the rapture here no no we said the rapture is in another dimension any more than what it's going to do is gonna take us into this that dimension where the others are right there you can't see them but they're there even you're a theophany if not twelve feet from you the Prophet said yours so there there's it's not far away any man so he surgery you're gonna you're gonna we're gonna go from here to there and we're gonna be me glorified bodies are Olivia and he said of that and after a while you would look up and here's Jesus coming down in that glorified body and we're gonna rise to meet him hey man it's a brother/sister god help us to be so full of the Holy Ghost that we're gonna get more and more sensitive to that dimension amen science amen and and the world is getting more and more sensitive to the natural dimensions amen when it comes to weather when it comes to what's going on in the universe when it comes to us going on around the earth and so on hey man they're getting more and more censored ain't no something that's taking place they know that's one be serious it's going to happen to the earth oh yeah we'll get into some of that under quotes where where the scripture brings it out what's going to happen to the earth and the atom and the Prophet all God brings it up when we're again we're gathered together with them and when rise to meet the Lord in the air and we're going to have fellowship hallelujah wonderful praise the Lord amen and he said what what are we wait for we're going to wait for he said the new heaven a new earth hey man by the grace of God God Elvis unfortunately too many are caught up with this this world not with with the faith of God they're cut out with Israel and not the new heaven new earth the more sensitive to to Wesley well yeah more sensitive to the to the natural things of life did the spiritual all right your theophany is right next to you do we do we know that do you sense that you do you at any time feel the presence of God moving moving in in your theophany as the prophet said when you it's not 12 feet from you at any given time he said when you sin it'll pull away and you get convicted and when you repent it comes back praise the Lord hallelujah ami till God be the glory a man cut one day you're gonna step into that and be glorified please God help us to believe Elvis to believe it Lord with a complete belief and what is a complete belief is a belief that got no questions and got no doubt God Elvis and we're getting closer to it brother if we don't go soon we're going to be caught up into in the Great Tribulation because why we're bringing it might be here in this scripture right here yeah what's going on right now we're going with Jesus and the and the rest of the world is going with the devil you know it's coming under his control why because the devil comes down with great wrath knowing his time is short and that's that's into the Great Tribulation oh yeah he knows his time is short and the bride knows her time is short god help us I charge thee therefore before God in the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom a man and we know that when he comes down she comes down with him his bride it's in the book of Revelation and it says preach the word preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering and doctrine amen for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine and that's the truth they want doctrine but not sound doctrine that's going to control them for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own last show they to themselves teachers having itching ears amazing the devil's influence they're going to be led not by the true ministry but by a false ministry but God gave gave the promise in his words just bear with me I'll try not to be too much longer amen there's a reference here to the death yes when it comes to the ministry that God sits in among the people but it is not exactly the correct one that I had there they see where God promised a promise to Israel he said I will give you pastors after my own heart he said that will teach you knowledge and understanding a man pastors to teach you knowledge and understanding so it's not enough to get wisdom and to get knowledge get understanding so do you understand who you are do you understand what God has done and what God is doing now in your life amen it's more than coming in and just hear somebody talk about this and talk about that no brothers sister it's God talking to us through the ministry it's not the ministry it's God and I trust this the Lord not the devil but that were worn right here that the enemy the enemy also comes down in East preaching amen he said the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears a man and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables amazing amazing so close it is they would deceive the very elect if possible it's what Jesus said but watch thou in all things endure afflictions amen we think because we're Christians oh we want had to put up with this one had to put up with that well all the way through scripture believers have to suffer and endure much tribulation amen God out but if you're to if you take your stand tribulation is going to follow god help us and it says we'll watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of thy ministry take your stand for the gospel for Christ amen don't go there preaching just to impress the people if you want to gloat impress anyone impress the Lord amen go there and preach the police Jesus not necessarily the people grace make full proof of thy ministry for I am now ready to be offered and the time of my departure II said is a tan a man he knew his time was coming amen turn with me to Revelation 12 and I'll try to bring it to a conclusion no I thought for sure I'd finish it but no not when you're getting to the scripture because you're going on and on and on this is just notes it's different but we want to follow the leadership of the Holy Ghost in Revelation chapter 12 and verse 10 and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the Kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down the devil when we go up the devil comes down when the bride goes up and the bridegroom goes up the devil comes down in the Great Tribulation he said for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night amen but it is finished amen Jesus on the cross that it is finished and it is in his Omega ministry it comes to a place in the bride it is finished amen and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death grace to us therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them wall to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea for the devil is come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he had but a short time and that's why that we are exceeding and experiencing in the world now perilous times and it's going to get worse because even talking to unbelievers they acknowledge that family is not like it used to be no no the relationship is just not there the love is not there like it used to be no why because the devil has come down with great wrath knowing his time is short that's why as the Bible says that they have a form of godliness and deny the power thereof a form of godliness the power is the devil but they're not they're denying the real true Holy Ghost power of Jesus but it's Jesus and Satan it's the bride and the church Jesus comes down to take the bride up into the rapture Satan is coming down a man to the Great Tribulation and the church is going to be martyred they lay down their lives in the Great Tribulation praise the name of the Lord that was the time in Revelation under the Somerton Church age where God's not to surrender Jade no it was the Philadelphia naitch and God said there's a time coming upon the earth that's gonna try try try those on the earth but he said I'll not he said but he said you won't go down for that he said yeah I won't cause you to do to witness that I won't cause you to experience that that's why he was going to he was going to take them into a resurrection rapture amen they elect the elect of God in every age are going into rapture they're going to be resurrected and and their loss in the bright age is gonna be right raptured with them by the grace of God always tremendous amen grace to us in this hour when the enemy has come down with great wrath and brother if there's anything we're witnessing is the great wrath of the devil but I trust that we have the revelation of the love of God the love of the bridegroom for his bride amen that we're going by the grace of God we're under his leadership the leadership of God not the leadership of the devil it's amazing that's that the world is under the leadership of Satan it's amazing that so many out there are following Satan's thoughts Satan's ideas but they want do one accept the ideas of our Lord Jesus Christ amen because it calls for a total separation from unbelief and they don't want that total separation there's a lot of professing believers today don't want that total separation no they feel they want friends they want company they want this they want that well the believers want Jesus he meant he's the one that comforts comforts the believers they finished with a couple of quotes here he said it was a time as in all times the people has never wanted God to lead them they want their own way of leadership and we're fighting that evening even and around the message you know how many are willing to say not my will father time be done God has ordained the ministry to lead you oh yeah prophet of God said you won't go any further than your pastor he said he's ordained to lead you through that's right you won't live any higher than your pastor the grace of God so he said as in all times that people he said never want a god to lead them they want their own way of leadership whether that was Cain's problem Cain says Satan Erica or God said Satan or Cain if you do what's right one won't you be accepted he wouldn't do it talking to God and he wouldn't do it and always he's gonna do this God said I'll set a mark on you that no man who killed you because he was afraid then after rejecting the word that he was going to be killed and God said I'll set a mark on you that no man will kill you a man how would the grace of God but again it was for a reason got a God at it for our purpose a man he said they want their own way of leadership that's right and this story this morning it was during this time he's in of the days of Samuel the man of God the Prophet and he had been a just man a good man honorable reputable true honest with the people never deceiving them and telling them nothing but straight thus saith the Lord they he said but the people that come to a place where they wanted to change this program and now they want to change the message that it's not just this and this now they're interpreting doctrines and they're turning this into a cult that into a cult and so on right and he said they had looked upon the Philistines the Amalekites the ammonites the Hittites and the other nations of the world they had seen that they had Kings that rule over them govern them guided them fought their battles and it seemed to be that Israel wanted to pattern themselves like these kings and these people God had Israel under the leadership of his prophets but Israel looking at the other nations wanted to be under the leadership of a key of a of a human King strain God God give them a king he said I'll let you choose the king and they did choose Saul yeah but again he he was gonna do what they wanted to him to do not what God wanted to do God told go do this go do this go do this but he feared the people and you got same thing today you got preachers that fear the people more than they fear God that's right god help us and the people want that people don't want that kind of that kind of a ministry just as Israel didn't want them to be led by the prophets Oh brothers sister got Elvis and he said this seems to be that Israel wanted to pattern themselves like these kings and like these people but he said it has never been in any age God's intention for his people to act like the people of the world or to be governing controlled like the people of the world God's people as always has been a peculiar people different people I called out a separated people and altogether different their actions different in their ways different in their manner of living than what the people of the world as they're advertised for the things and all that their makeup is is has been always contrary to the things that the people of the world desire and that is the absolute truth a man they don't he said they don't want to be separated they don't want to be peculiar or different in their actions their ways their manner of living no they want to be able to go nak like them and you know be friends with them and so on no no let's be let's be a friend of Jesus amen we pray grace by the grace of God will not do is Judas where Jesus who talked about betraying your friend and so on grace to us brother sister we'll get more of the of these things in in the next message amen the Lord willing and because again I wanted to finish this to continue with to do what brother Alec had suggested and to do what brother Matthew suggested and also for brother Matthew to have a testimony and our brother Chad as well so be in prayer that the Lord will help us amen well we just don't have enough time well maybe maybe we'll be at a time before we before before I finish it but I keep pointing you to an eternity a man so we don't need another message to point us to eternity we got that amen but just to highlight and and to break down some of the things that God has done and God is doing to what for what are we doing what are we here for now and hearing the word to is to increase our faith amen is to establish our faith so that we were firmly grounded in the revealed Word of God amen that we're firmly believing for the resurrection and the rapture amen and again let me tell you I understand they don't think you're gonna get you're gonna be cut up here in this dimension no no no we're gonna be cut into that other dimension and then all of us gonna be raptured up just with Jesus to meet the Lord in the air by the grace of God amen yeah what you talk about we're going the people are gonna want know there's going to be a rapture there's going to be that few goal they want know there that there was a rapture why because because it's just Oh in a moment between people die you're gonna be in this dimension then you're gonna be in theophany and the other dimension and then when you're in theophany and the other dimension with all the other saints that are gone on Oh in a moment in the twinkling of an eye you'll be changed into a glorified body and then the prophet of God said after a while he suggested that maybe we'll fellowship with one another then after a while and we look up and he'll be coming down and we'll and we are well then we'll be raptured up cut off by the grace of God amen Lord bless you let's tan praise the Lord thank God for the word amen we're gonna sing amazing grace because there was a quote that I was going to share with you can what the Prophet said about Amazing Grace amen and that that was it's part of the quotes on the rapture and he said you talk about worship he said if there's ever a time of worship if she's a woman when we get together over there and he said we're all gonna sing amazing grace and he said and when we're singing Amazing Grace we're going to look up there's Jesus hey man praise the Lord so he said brother's gonna be a tremendous time of worship praise the Lord let's sing it Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me I once was lost but now I'm found was blind
