[11:10] grace of God to him of course and we
[11:13] this morning was Thomas district Gail a
[11:16] sister Eileen Gail this week and she
[11:18] sends her greetings and that's the grace
[11:21] of God for her she's in Cordova still
[11:23] and also she mentioned where Joyce Heath
[11:26] his daughters remember him and he's in
[11:28] home they're the same one as sister Edna
[11:31] Gail is him and just want to remember
[11:33] him he is he has Alzheimer's so it's
[11:37] just I didn't said to pray form so we
[11:42] just want to remember him and also on
[11:44] brother
[11:45] he believes also we were talking to him
[11:47] yesterday and he wishes every woman
[11:50] happy Easter and he seems to be doing
[11:51] fine and but it was you know goes your
[11:53] pray for him and he's he was in very
[11:56] good spirits there yesterday
[11:58] remember also brother Matthew and his
[12:01] need for job at this time faced to him
[12:04] and his family and also a member also
[12:07] off brother brother John curly and
[12:09] family and we just appreciate the
[12:11] message we received from Friday night
[12:15] and last night and it was wonderful and
[12:17] we just appreciate him
[12:19] short notice to do that and also for the
[12:22] Steven as well and we pray also for a
[12:25] situation we're in with the pandemic and
[12:28] we just pray that this ends and just get
[12:32] back to somewhat of a normalcy and we
[12:37] know when that as I mentioned there
[12:38] before and we know in the Old Testament
[12:40] was a playing and Moses sent Aaron down
[12:43] through with the scepter and they had to
[12:45] look upon the scepter and he stopped it
[12:47] you know the plate was stopped it was
[12:49] time to stop God accomplished what he
[12:50] wanted to accomplish we pray that we get
[12:53] to that also as we see it starting to
[12:55] wane now in the in this weather so we
[12:57] just ask grace of God to come in and
[12:59] intervene at this time and there God
[13:02] would have accomplished what he wants to
[13:04] accomplish but this and we know you know
[13:06] it's uh something happened either
[13:08] something someone stood up in heaven or
[13:11] something but it's definitely something
[13:13] happened in heaven and we know it as the
[13:15] bride is sensitive to those things and
[13:17] we know that the only years is not going
[13:21] to be saved you know God has come for a
[13:23] judgment and in this last time and there
[13:26] was a
[13:27] you know there's it's gonna change
[13:31] we're gonna head toward the end faster
[13:34] than we realized and so it's not going
[13:37] to be the same anymore

[39:15] praise the Lord
[39:22] a Mandalore delicious amen and we thank
[39:26] the Lord for the opportunity to gather
[39:29] in spirit amen
[39:32] there very few here when it comes to the
[39:35] physical beans but again we trust that
[39:37] most of them are on line and that their
[39:39] spirit is with us and that they're
[39:41] getting into the spirit of worship and
[39:43] getting into the spirit ready to receive
[39:45] the word as our brother Steven coffee
[39:48] comes to minister of the word and again
[39:51] does understand the importance of
[39:53] hearing the word because the Bible says
[39:55] that faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[39:57] by the word he meant so that we want to
[40:00] get the true revelation as God wants us
[40:02] to have it and how God wants us to have
[40:05] it praise the Lord it's amazing right
[40:07] from the beginning right on down to this
[40:09] end the brother God has used the same
[40:11] thing to give us faith and that's the
[40:14] word a man the Satan challenges us
[40:17] challenges our faith a man to try to get
[40:20] us to compromise on the word but we're
[40:23] going to stay with the word stay with
[40:25] the word that our brother Jonathan
[40:26] Khaled preached we're going to stay with
[40:28] the word that our brother Steven copy
[40:30] will minister to us today and we thank
[40:32] the Lord amen again for the technology
[40:35] that that we have so that our brother
[40:37] Steven so so many miles away that he
[40:41] could be with us in worship and in the
[40:43] going forth of the word amen and that we
[40:46] could sit here and listen to our brother
[40:48] in the United States and watch our
[40:50] brother in the United States minister
[40:52] the word so God's grace to be with us
[40:54] brothers and sisters and God's grace be
[40:57] with those online a man to God be the
[41:00] glory and also when it comes to prayer I
[41:04] believe our brother onic is still in
[41:06] need of prayer and understand that he
[41:09] had a problem maybe fell or something in
[41:12] the earth is back and according to the
[41:14] prayer request last night that he was he
[41:16] was lying in bed so because of pain so
[41:20] the grace of God be with our brother
[41:22] onic today and maybe the trust that
[41:24] there's in tuned to the hearing of the
[41:26] word and God I pray by the word will
[41:29] give us the faith a man to believe that
[41:32] that brother Han ik was healed with the
[41:35] stripes that Jesus
[41:36] for a mayor to God be the glory please
[41:40] we've got to believe we've got to
[41:42] believe there's the promise if you can't
[41:44] believe for healing how you going to
[41:45] believe for the rapture so we got to
[41:48] believe it every day keep claiming the
[41:49] promise every day
[41:50] the devil is there to challenge it but
[41:53] it's all right faith is there to
[41:54] challenge the devil a man and we're not
[41:57] going to believe Satan we're gonna
[41:59] believe the promise amen
[42:00] regardless of how you feel what you feel
[42:02] they leave the promise amen and we pray
[42:05] the grace of God to continue with
[42:07] brother Mark and and I know the sister
[42:09] Maureen concerning the COFF and maybe
[42:12] the touch of the flu
[42:13] we just leave that with the Lord amen we
[42:15] got the victory amen we are more than
[42:18] conquerors by the grace of Almighty God
[42:20] Jesus laid down his life for us he
[42:23] picked it up again and shared it with us
[42:24] amen so praise the Lord
[42:27] just saying the devil could the devil
[42:29] challenge Jesus our brother Jonathan was
[42:31] bringing it out he challenged Jesus and
[42:33] now brother because Jesus is in you he's
[42:35] challenging us amen get thee behind me
[42:38] Satan praise the name of the Lord
[42:40] regardless of feelings no doubt Jesus
[42:42] felt hungry any man oh you after what he
[42:46] was a hundred but but he didn't he
[42:48] didn't give in to his weakness amen
[42:50] he stayed with the word will of God and
[42:53] God bless our Stephen coffee as he comes
[42:56] to minister to us the word amen and we
[42:59] certainly welcome our brother and maybe
[43:01] trust us some day the Lord will bring
[43:03] him bring him from the States and
[43:06] literally and physically back to st.
[43:09] John's again and we'll have our brother
[43:11] minister to us again so this being
[43:13] prayer as our brother comes to minister
[43:16] the word and let's believe that it's not
[43:18] our brother Stephen coffee it's the Lord
[43:21] they met you got a the problem of God
[43:24] said with oh my said this is not me he
[43:27] said this is Jesus he said I got to get
[43:29] myself out of the way so he can do this
[43:31] where brother if the father God had to
[43:34] do that when it comes to the signs and
[43:36] the wonders of a prophets ministry
[43:38] brother the ministry got to do it
[43:39] amen to get out of the way that Jesus
[43:42] came come and minister the word through
[43:44] the ministry a man and we got to get out
[43:47] of the way to let Jesus come
[43:49] received the word a man through those
[43:52] that are hearing the word so praise the
[43:54] name of the Lord God's grace be with us
[43:56] during this time and again we're living
[43:59] in a tremendous time when it comes to
[44:04] the pandemic when it comes to the
[44:07] coronavirus and what's going on and just
[44:09] recently he might even last night that I
[44:13] saw the headline on the internet and it
[44:16] says it's the end of the world but to
[44:19] them is the end of the world as it was
[44:21] it's the end of the world that we are
[44:24] used to because they feel that after all
[44:26] this is over he said we're going to live
[44:28] in a new world well by the grace of God
[44:31] were looking for a new heaven and a new
[44:33] earth amen so brother God is allowing
[44:36] this for a reason how God helped us to
[44:38] look up because our Redemption draweth
[44:41] nigh because this is the sign of the end
[44:44] so God's grace to us in the going forth
[44:47] of the word today and I want to express
[44:52] thanks to sister Kimberly for the buns
[44:54] that she made us and and the cards of
[44:56] course that our brother Paul delivered

[47:13] Steven and so thankful that our brother
[47:15] consented to minister to us online amen
[47:20] and again let's let the same spirit that
[47:23] would be with us here and the anointing
[47:25] in this assembly and on the Saints
[47:27] online pray that same anointing and
[47:29] power be with our brother Steven as he
[47:32] comes to Minister the Word of God and
[47:34] I'll leave you with a quote as we turn
[47:36] it to our brother Steven our brother
[47:40] Jonathan was preaching on overcoming and
[47:42] in the message out can I overcome just a
[47:46] short quote here and the puppet of God
[47:49] said the thing you have to overcome is
[47:51] yourself and he says you have to
[47:54] overcome your ideas and your things and
[47:58] surrender yourself to him and that's the
[48:02] truth because the devil is challenging
[48:04] us with our feelings but God wants us to
[48:07] lay aside feelings and go by faith and
[48:09] it says he'll were come for you he knows
[48:13] the way we don't so he said the hour
[48:16] is late very late and you do have good
[48:19] intentions but be cut inside now don't
[48:23] struggle just yield yourself to him and
[48:26] walk on with a perfect satisfied faith
[48:29] that what God has promised he's able to
[48:32] perform amen let's believe it that God
[48:36] will bless our brother Stephen as he
[48:39] comes to minister of the word to us amen
[48:41] and once buddies God's intention what is
[48:43] God's purpose is to increase our faith
[48:46] amen through the word through our
[48:49] brother Stephen coffee so god bless them
[48:52] and of course they're under the same
[48:55] conditions that were under here and
[48:57] they're only so many allowed in a church
[48:59] and I understand that Brian and I
[49:01] witnessed it online that our brother
[49:03] Barry coffee is ministering from his
[49:06] office a man sitting in his office of
[49:09] preaching to the people online so god
[49:11] bless us brother let's make sure that
[49:14] our faiths make our new table is an hour
[49:16] - what is an hour to make your calling
[49:18] and election sure you don't assume this
[49:21] don't assume that now you got to make it
[49:23] sure
[49:23] Amen because things are going to get
[49:25] worse so make sure that you that you
[49:28] have that calling that election of
[49:29] Christ in our hearts and in our souls
[49:32] god bless amen maybe I was going to sing
[49:36] but because of the time is getting well
[49:38] they're our turn to our brother Stephen
[49:40] god bless yes Amen god bless brother
[49:45] Stephen
[50:07] well hello everybody and good morning
[50:11] it's it's nice to be able to do this
[50:15] with you and to be able to meet with you
[50:19] however a long distance it may be so
[50:24] like to say a happy Easter to each one
[50:26] of you and whether or not you're in the
[50:28] sanctuary or you're at home happy Easter
[50:33] it's great to be together and I'd like
[50:36] to thank brother Gerald and the rest of
[50:38] the church for allowing me to speak this
[50:40] morning no matter how many times we do a
[50:45] digital service it seems a bit unusual
[50:48] so god bless the the assembly for making
[50:55] it so that we can all meet together I
[50:57] think I'd like to thank brother Darrell
[51:02] for a round and making the decision to
[51:06] meet digitally and not for everybody to
[51:09] get together it seems like a very
[51:11] contradictory thing for believer because
[51:14] the Bible says forsake not the
[51:15] assembling of yourselves together but
[51:17] we're not forsaking the assembling of
[51:19] ourselves together
[51:19] you can't break one scripture while
[51:21] following another so we are gathering
[51:25] together and we're also abiding by the
[51:27] laws of the land which the scripture
[51:29] tells us to do and we're also being wise
[51:33] and prudent the scripture tells us to do
[51:35] and protecting one another protecting
[51:38] those without the church so it's a hard
[51:41] decision to do that but we are
[51:43] assembling ourselves together I think
[51:45] the the people at the zoom headquarters
[51:49] and the Skype headquarters they had no
[51:52] idea what what they were doing and I
[51:57] believe it was the Lord that put the
[51:58] idea into their heads and they probably
[52:02] didn't have any idea what they were
[52:03] doing and now here we are using it I
[52:05] think brother Branham used conferencing
[52:10] and he had a phone hook-up and if he is
[52:13] if he was here today I think for sure
[52:15] he'd be using zoom or Skype or something
[52:17] and I believe video
[52:20] conferencing was actually developed in
[52:22] like the 1920s and call me crazy but I
[52:25] think it was developed just for the
[52:28] bride for these few months just so that
[52:32] we could keep meeting and yeah it's
[52:34] great in business and it's great for
[52:35] family and to be able to talk and
[52:37] friends and things like that but I'm so
[52:39] thankful that we can all be together
[52:40] digitally and and be able to meet and
[52:44] still assemble ourselves together in
[52:47] however strange away it may be in come
[52:50] together so I'm just thankful for
[52:52] brother Gerald letting me speak here
[52:54] today and it's a challenge following
[52:58] brother Jones sermons that he preached
[53:00] Friday and Saturday was a tremendous
[53:03] topic and tremendous service and it's
[53:05] actually the first time I'd ever heard
[53:06] brother John speak so I can't wait to
[53:09] see him in person and do that but I'm
[53:12] glad to be glad to be able to talk to
[53:14] you this morning I'll be honest I was
[53:16] feeling a little bit unusual in my heart
[53:21] this this week as I was preparing for
[53:23] this and just going over the different
[53:28] things that the Lord was putting on my
[53:30] heart and just considering how unusual a
[53:34] time it is and I think you know I'm just
[53:38] I'm tired of as I'm sure you are I'm
[53:41] tired of seeing all the headlines and
[53:44] I'm tired of talking about the
[53:45] coronavirus everybody you know I've got
[53:48] several friends who are who have it I
[53:51] know several believers who had who have
[53:52] had it and gone through it who are
[53:55] currently dealing with it and it's a
[53:58] it's a challenging time in the world for
[54:00] sure but um let's I'm just tired of
[54:02] hearing of it I think I think we have a
[54:05] greater hope and I would say this as
[54:07] well
[54:08] fear is fear is a valueless element
[54:13] there's there's there's nothing to it
[54:16] fear is something that may or may not
[54:18] happen so it's different than being wise
[54:21] and being prudent it's something that
[54:23] may or may not happen there is great
[54:25] value in faith I mean there's there's
[54:31] great
[54:34] great value in holding to something
[54:38] that's certain something that's true
[54:40] it's faith is the evidence of things
[54:43] that is not seen and the substance of
[54:46] the very things that we hope for so fear
[54:50] is fabulous there's nothing to it and
[54:51] the whole the whole of society is
[54:54] wrapped up in fear and I just think for
[54:58] a believer and for us inside of Christ
[55:02] looking out at the rest of the world in
[55:04] the condition that it's in its Laodicea
[55:07] I mean what else did what else do we
[55:08] expect from a time like this it's almost
[55:10] like it doesn't it doesn't even shock me
[55:12] you know being able to go into the
[55:16] grocery store and seeing everything
[55:17] almost completely off the shelves that's
[55:19] kind of new I guess you know but I guess
[55:24] just just from a believer looking out
[55:26] there's there's so much that we have to
[55:28] look forward to in Christ and faith is
[55:32] of great value you in a tongue like this
[55:35] fear is valueless there's nothing to it
[55:38] so I'm thankful that we have something
[55:41] that we can we can hold to this morning
[55:44] on this Easter morning and we can say
[55:47] Lord we believe in you and we believe in
[55:49] your the promise that you gave us a
[55:51] promise that is beyond anything that
[55:54] this life can throw at us that's what we
[55:57] hold to if you would let's pray
[55:59] so just wherever you are if let's just
[56:00] bow our heads and pray together Heavenly
[56:03] Father we thank you for for this morning
[56:05] we thank you for spring time in order we
[56:10] thank you for most importantly what this
[56:14] day represents to the Christian the
[56:16] resurrection or without it we would be
[56:19] nothing but with it Lord we are heirs of
[56:23] the promise and Lord we love you and we
[56:25] thank you so much and I pray that you
[56:27] would just keep us in your hands today
[56:29] lord I pray that you bless the Assembly
[56:32] wherever they are if they're in their
[56:33] living rooms if they're in the church
[56:35] wherever they may be lord I pray that
[56:37] you you just anoint them with the Holy
[56:41] Ghost this morning and for the rest of
[56:43] this day and as unusual and Easter as
[56:46] the
[56:47] is may it be the best one that we've
[56:49] ever had the Lord we thank you for our
[56:52] families we thank you for our friends
[56:54] and what we thank you for the
[56:55] opportunity to be able to spend time
[56:59] with our families to almost be locked in
[57:02] together with them Lord we want to take
[57:05] advantage of this time and and and we
[57:08] know that you've allowed it for a reason
[57:10] so Lord we love you and we thank you so
[57:12] much
[57:12] less than our time together this morning
[57:15] and bless all those that are assembling
[57:17] together and your name do we pray amen
[57:21] well if you can if you have your Bible
[57:23] I'd like to read two passages of
[57:26] Scripture so if you can turn to Joel
[57:27] chapter 2 in verse 25 very familiar
[57:33] passage of Scripture and almost a
[57:37] scripture that is synonymous with that
[57:39] with Easter morning but I wanted to read
[57:42] this so the book of Joel knew Bible
[57:45] leaders it's the book of Daniel and
[57:47] Hosea and Joel I I wanted to read up
[57:52] just a passage of scripture here in
[57:55] verse 25 so Joel chapter 2 in verse 25
[58:01] and I will restore to you the years that
[58:06] the locust hath eaten the cankerworm and
[58:09] the caterpillar and the polymer worm my
[58:12] great army which I sent to you and he
[58:15] shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and
[58:17] praise the name of the Lord your God
[58:18] that help that have dealt wondrously
[58:21] with you my people shall never be
[58:24] ashamed if you would let's go to one
[58:28] other scripture keep your finger there
[58:29] in Joel and let's go to Deuteronomy
[58:32] chapter 31 Deuteronomy chapter 31 and
[58:40] I'd like to read a verse we didn't verse
[58:43] 6 and this is a Moses last really one of
[58:52] the last consultations that Moses has
[58:54] with Joshua and with
[58:57] his is his priests and his Levites and
[59:00] so he's he's he's telling them different
[59:06] things consider on me chapter verse 31
[59:09] chapter 31 and verse 6 be strong and of
[59:13] a good courage fear not nor be afraid of
[59:17] them for the LORD thy God
[59:20] he it is that doeth that death go with
[59:25] thee and he will not fail thee nor
[59:27] forsake thee I love that scripture you
[59:31] know I was thinking I don't know about
[59:33] you but springtime and Easter weekend is
[59:37] my favorite time of year it's always
[59:40] been it's my favorite time of year
[59:42] the Song of Solomon I believe chapter 2
[59:48] it says behold the winter has passed and
[59:52] the rain is over and gone and the
[59:54] flowers appeareth on the earth and that
[59:56] the time of the singing of the birds is
[59:59] come and the voice of the dove is heard
[1:00:04] in our land and I think every new
[1:00:05] Philander rejoices more on that
[1:00:08] scripture that behold winter has passed
[1:00:10] and and the flowers appear on the earth
[1:00:14] but Easter time to me I I that just
[1:00:17] personally I'm in a more optimistic type
[1:00:20] of person this is the way I am and I
[1:00:22] guess springtime is the upward swing
[1:00:26] from winter and to me it's an optimistic
[1:00:29] time and it there's just a lot of
[1:00:32] potential there in springtime and in the
[1:00:35] world right now even the bride the
[1:00:39] church we're experiencing the effects of
[1:00:42] a fallen world
[1:00:43] that's wrought with fear it's just
[1:00:47] covered in fear and and it's covered in
[1:00:50] disease for that matter and it's it's a
[1:00:53] trying time for sure and it's an it's I
[1:00:56] honestly it's an abnormal time no time
[1:00:58] in history has everybody been told to
[1:01:00] stay home collectively as a society or
[1:01:04] globally and but even in the midst of
[1:01:08] that in this abnormal time and
[1:01:10] the hardships that this present world
[1:01:13] presents it's still springtime and we
[1:01:17] still have that to look forward to and
[1:01:19] it's gonna be summer and the flowers are
[1:01:21] gonna come we're going to be able to
[1:01:22] plant things and do all that and I love
[1:01:25] that and this may be this may be a
[1:01:29] little bit overly introspective or
[1:01:31] cheesy call it what you like but I was
[1:01:34] thinking of Easter and how unusual and
[1:01:37] Easter it is and there has if you look
[1:01:41] back so I calculated it just because I'm
[1:01:44] a numbers guy there's been approximately
[1:01:50] 1987 Easter mornings since Christ's
[1:01:53] death and resurrection so if you account
[1:01:55] his death in the year in his 33rd year
[1:01:58] there's been approximately 1987 sermons
[1:02:04] on Easter morning that's a lot of
[1:02:07] sermons that's a lot of that's a lot of
[1:02:09] Easter morning's and I was thinking on
[1:02:11] on all of that time all that the true
[1:02:14] church has experienced in that time and
[1:02:19] it's really just the bat of an eye for
[1:02:21] the Lord but for us all that that God
[1:02:24] has brought his church through and all
[1:02:27] that has happened in that time if you
[1:02:29] look at Martin Luther and you look over
[1:02:31] the span of his life if you look at John
[1:02:33] Wesley in the span of his life you go
[1:02:35] back in Calamba and Iranian the Apostle
[1:02:38] Paul even and all of the church
[1:02:40] messengers and you look at all of their
[1:02:41] lives in the span of their lives and all
[1:02:44] of the Easter morning's that have
[1:02:45] occurred in that time since Christ's
[1:02:48] resurrection there's there's been a lot
[1:02:50] of Easter that we've gone through and
[1:02:52] all the people that have lived and died
[1:02:54] all of the believers all over the
[1:02:56] historical events if you just step back
[1:02:59] almost zoom back and examine that
[1:03:01] expanse of time and then as it almost
[1:03:05] naturally for the believer as brother
[1:03:08] John read and believed Deuteronomy
[1:03:10] chapter 8 last night remember all the
[1:03:12] things that the Lord has brought you
[1:03:14] through to bring you to this point in
[1:03:16] time and all that has transpired and you
[1:03:20] know I was thinking just just personally
[1:03:23] as I was as I was looking over that
[1:03:25] expanse of history and thinking about
[1:03:29] all of those eastern warnings I believe
[1:03:31] just personally as though as I was going
[1:03:34] through it I believe that I'm in Christ
[1:03:35] Church I believe I have the Holy Ghost
[1:03:38] and as a little illegitimate of a child
[1:03:42] as I may feel as poor a member of his
[1:03:45] church as I am my faith is in what
[1:03:50] Christ did for me 1987 morning's ago and
[1:03:54] that assures me otherwise that I am in
[1:03:58] his church I am a child of God and I'm
[1:04:01] here in 2020 and I've been redeemed and
[1:04:04] I'm one of the few and I I just I think
[1:04:09] all that time all the things that have
[1:04:12] occurred and now we're at this present
[1:04:14] time in history and we're not we know
[1:04:16] we're not allowed to look into the
[1:04:18] future we know our future we know our
[1:04:21] end but we don't know what the next few
[1:04:23] weeks what the next few months will hold
[1:04:25] we are looking to his promise we know
[1:04:27] the very next thing to happen is the
[1:04:29] rapture and we're just at that point in
[1:04:32] time where it's the end times where
[1:04:34] we're experiencing a true restoration of
[1:04:38] the bride tree as brother Branham
[1:04:41] preached it in in 1962 and we were at a
[1:04:47] point in time in 2020 and we really are
[1:04:51] the Church of the Living God I heard an
[1:04:53] announcer say the Saturday because of
[1:04:58] the stock exchange rally that happened
[1:05:00] this past week and it says that he said
[1:05:04] something to the effect of the stock
[1:05:06] exchange at rally that we've had it
[1:05:07] shows that as a nation we have hope and
[1:05:10] I was thinking oh man just a hope that
[1:05:13] song this is just hope will not do I
[1:05:16] must be firmly decided and I would say
[1:05:19] to you this morning as a believer a
[1:05:24] Christian living in Satan's Eden on this
[1:05:28] day this Easter Day in 2020 you are you
[1:05:33] are the living proof
[1:05:35] that someone can do all things through
[1:05:39] Christ who strengthens strengthens them
[1:05:42] you you living in today on on April 12th
[1:05:48] 2020 you personally are the living proof
[1:05:54] you're a living manifestation of the
[1:05:56] scripture when it says you can do all
[1:05:59] things through Christ who strengthens
[1:06:02] you I genuinely believe that nobody's
[1:06:07] perfect you have things that are yet to
[1:06:09] be worked on you you might he might be
[1:06:13] just as crazy as the next person and
[1:06:15] have strange ideas strange opinions you
[1:06:18] might be more impatient than the next
[1:06:19] one we're all different were all unique
[1:06:21] we're all just as strange as the next
[1:06:24] guy or girl we we you know but for what
[1:06:31] for whatever we are at this point in
[1:06:32] time God saw fit for you personally to
[1:06:36] be alive today in this time and you are
[1:06:40] enduring the hardships of a Christian
[1:06:42] life you're believing in him you're
[1:06:44] believing that that his blood is what
[1:06:46] covers your past sin and some of you may
[1:06:49] still think to this day having been in
[1:06:51] the message for I don't know 30 years 20
[1:06:53] years you may you may still think how on
[1:06:56] earth could the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:06:58] actually cover my sin and that may still
[1:07:01] a question you and I don't think well
[1:07:03] ever fully understand that but you
[1:07:06] believe it anyways you believe it
[1:07:08] anyways and you're here you're still
[1:07:09] doing it
[1:07:10] you're still pressing on in 1987
[1:07:14] Easter's later there's still a people
[1:07:17] who are holding to the truth and the
[1:07:19] truth that they have been assured of
[1:07:21] which is what the scripture says they
[1:07:23] said hold to that which you have been as
[1:07:26] short of that which you know is the
[1:07:28] truth and I'll tell you you you believe
[1:07:34] it essentially and what I'm trying to
[1:07:36] say by all of that is that you in your
[1:07:40] of fallen flesh even you in your
[1:07:44] imperfect state that you are in you
[1:07:48] who hold to the truth who know where you
[1:07:51] stand with the Lord you are what true
[1:07:55] restoration looks like I really believe
[1:08:00] that and if you just think from a minute
[1:08:02] now because we really have to shift our
[1:08:04] thinking to to accept that because we
[1:08:08] look at ourselves and we look at our
[1:08:10] rights and our wrongs and we have we
[1:08:13] almost have a counter of I've done this
[1:08:15] right I've done that wrong I've got this
[1:08:16] to work on I've got that to get away the
[1:08:18] Lord delivered me of this I got to get
[1:08:19] this we have that mindset and just if
[1:08:22] you shift your thinking just for a
[1:08:24] second you essentially in your imperfect
[1:08:27] state you are what true restoration
[1:08:31] looks like a brother just passed away in
[1:08:34] our in our in our church recently a
[1:08:39] couple weeks ago and he was a good fella
[1:08:41] good old soul and I was even thinking as
[1:08:46] we were doing the funeral for this
[1:08:47] brother back to my grandmother who died
[1:08:50] at a year about a year and a half ago
[1:08:53] now and I was thinking of her and of
[1:08:57] this brother and when they died and I
[1:09:00] was just I can I was you know just
[1:09:04] looking at them and their family and I
[1:09:06] can still picture looking over the
[1:09:09] congregation and the casket in front as
[1:09:12] I was preaching funerals of these two
[1:09:14] individuals you know I'm just thinking
[1:09:17] in their own estimation when they passed
[1:09:21] away in their estimation they were
[1:09:24] probably not where they thought they
[1:09:25] needed to be with the Lord they probably
[1:09:28] thought I am NOT near where I need to be
[1:09:31] with the Lord I don't you know I don't I
[1:09:32] don't got this to work I've got that to
[1:09:34] work on I know where I'm going when I
[1:09:36] die but I don't feel like I'm ready to
[1:09:38] go just upon upon my actions alone and
[1:09:43] if you if you think about it according
[1:09:46] to God's view of what they were they
[1:09:48] were ready to go so their own estimation
[1:09:51] of who they were they they didn't feel
[1:09:54] like they were ready to go ready to go
[1:09:57] at all
[1:09:58] but they were in God's eyes and it goes
[1:10:00] back to it's a scriptural principle if
[1:10:02] you go back to the tune of Israel when
[1:10:05] the twelve spies went over and they they
[1:10:07] came back and they said we look like
[1:10:08] grasshoppers and Caleb and Joshua they
[1:10:10] said hey that may be the case but we are
[1:10:13] more than able to take them so those
[1:10:16] other 10 spies in their own estimation
[1:10:19] they were looking at themselves and they
[1:10:21] were thinking we are not able to take
[1:10:22] the land we can't do that and we're if
[1:10:26] we're not it's just it's just too much
[1:10:28] and Joshua and Caleb they look beyond
[1:10:30] their own ability and they understood
[1:10:32] the promise of God and they held to the
[1:10:35] promise of God regardless of what they
[1:10:38] were in their present state regardless
[1:10:39] of their inability and with their own
[1:10:42] physical ability to to take over and
[1:10:46] possess the land they knew that they
[1:10:48] didn't have the physical ability but
[1:10:49] they were looking beyond to the promise
[1:10:51] of God they they rested their faith in
[1:10:54] the promise of God and that's exactly
[1:10:56] what I think this brother who's a good
[1:10:59] Christian brother and my grandmother
[1:11:00] they did in their own lives they they
[1:11:03] placed their faith beyond their own
[1:11:05] ability to achieve something which it's
[1:11:09] an innately in a man to which to want to
[1:11:11] achieve something and want to achieve
[1:11:13] their own idea of perfection but they
[1:11:16] look beyond that to God's promise of a
[1:11:19] restoration and they had their the
[1:11:24] earnest of their inheritance was the
[1:11:25] Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost made that
[1:11:27] promise of reality and I think it
[1:11:31] behooves all of us this morning and what
[1:11:34] I wanted to encourage you to think about
[1:11:36] is is something that you already know
[1:11:38] but it's God will be working on you
[1:11:41] until the rapture or your time to go but
[1:11:45] God's promise of his church his
[1:11:47] restoration and when I when I think of
[1:11:50] you and I was I was thinking of
[1:11:51] everybody in the assembly this morning
[1:11:56] and for the Gerald and just I wish I
[1:12:00] could be there in the sanctuary today I
[1:12:02] know we all feel that way but I was just
[1:12:04] thinking of each one of you and I'm
[1:12:06] thinking that's you are the image of
[1:12:10] what restoration
[1:12:11] looks like in this day and age and I
[1:12:14] want to talk about that just for a
[1:12:15] little bit and it's really hard to wrap
[1:12:17] our head around that because Satan
[1:12:19] doesn't want you to know this and as the
[1:12:21] is the quote that brother John read last
[1:12:23] night you have when when the church
[1:12:29] knows who she is that's when the rapture
[1:12:32] will go when that revelation when
[1:12:34] everybody's in harmony with the
[1:12:36] understanding of who they are that's
[1:12:38] when the rapture will go and that's
[1:12:39] that's my favorite I think but I think
[1:12:42] the most referenced quote of all time at
[1:12:46] least for me and that's so true when you
[1:12:48] know who you are then you'll go and
[1:12:50] Satan does not want you to know who you
[1:12:53] are and he certainly doesn't want you to
[1:12:55] meditate on who you are and you as a
[1:12:58] believing professing Holy Ghost filled
[1:13:00] believer mistakes and all is what true
[1:13:05] restoration looks like in this day and
[1:13:09] age if you look now in the scripture in
[1:13:13] Joel 2:25 then this is a very familiar
[1:13:16] scripture and
[1:13:18] this is a scripture that father Brennan
[1:13:19] read out of in in the restoration of the
[1:13:21] bride tree and I will restore and the
[1:13:25] multiple other sermons that he used to
[1:13:26] preach about this subject and I feel
[1:13:29] like this morning as I was just reading
[1:13:35] this as I was listening to the wonderful
[1:13:38] special and things like that and I wish
[1:13:41] you guys would just make an album and on
[1:13:44] to marine and Priscilla and whoever else
[1:13:48] is there you guys just need to make an
[1:13:49] album and then do it quick because we
[1:13:53] all we all want that it was a beautiful
[1:13:55] special and I was just listening to the
[1:13:57] singing and Uncle Mark leading the
[1:13:59] worship there about the scripture and
[1:14:01] it's almost like this scripture is just
[1:14:03] I'm coming right through the pages and
[1:14:05] speaking to you personally as an
[1:14:07] individual so whether or not you're in
[1:14:09] the sanctuary or whether or not you're
[1:14:10] in your living room at home or wherever
[1:14:12] you may be the scripture is and the
[1:14:15] promise is I will restore to you and
[1:14:17] he's singling you out and I think again
[1:14:20] innately we have a problem because we
[1:14:22] look at ourselves and we begin
[1:14:24] think am I am I really what restoration
[1:14:27] looks like because this is this is
[1:14:30] really sad and Laura are you sure I mean
[1:14:33] I I mean I I know you love me and I know
[1:14:35] that I believe the message and I know
[1:14:37] that you know I I have the Holy Ghost
[1:14:39] and things like that but is this it is
[1:14:41] this what restoration really looks like
[1:14:43] and I find it interesting as well if you
[1:14:46] go back in the scripture and you look at
[1:14:48] the great patriarchs of of the Bible and
[1:14:51] you look at their individual resumes and
[1:14:53] their individual histories we wouldn't
[1:14:56] think if they came off the street we
[1:14:57] wouldn't let one of them be an officer
[1:14:59] in our church think about Abraham if you
[1:15:03] just took his resume now and Abraham was
[1:15:05] one to be a deacon in the church he
[1:15:07] wanted to be a you know a pastor of the
[1:15:10] church and we just looked at his history
[1:15:11] in his resume we could say well all now
[1:15:13] you're God's chosen and everything like
[1:15:15] that but what is this whole thing about
[1:15:17] just deceiving and and saying that your
[1:15:20] wife was actually not your wife and
[1:15:22] actually being willing for another man
[1:15:23] to marry him marry her what what was
[1:15:27] that all about or you take Moses and you
[1:15:29] say okay you're you led God's people
[1:15:31] through the wilderness what was this
[1:15:32] thing about murder your younger years
[1:15:36] and you still have a there was a scene
[1:15:38] in the wilderness when you hit a rock
[1:15:42] out of anger when God told you not to
[1:15:44] you just told you to do something else
[1:15:46] it was a murderer and if we looked at
[1:15:50] just his past if we looked at just his
[1:15:52] resume you would think there's no way in
[1:15:54] the world I'd let that guy be in our
[1:15:55] church as a vote him in as a pastor or
[1:15:58] something like that you look at reixach
[1:16:00] Rahab the the bear of Christ front
[1:16:02] bloodline and she was a prostitute and
[1:16:06] if we looked again just in her resume or
[1:16:08] David the king of Israel deception in
[1:16:11] killing a woman allowing a woman's
[1:16:13] husband to be killed so that he could
[1:16:15] take her know his own house and then we
[1:16:19] we give ourselves a hard time and we
[1:16:21] look at ourselves in and and we think
[1:16:23] and yes we should be examining ourselves
[1:16:25] according to the scripture that's not
[1:16:27] one of them that's not what I'm talking
[1:16:28] about but if in our own estimation of
[1:16:31] who we are in this time if we allow
[1:16:34] ourselves just to look at our past and
[1:16:37] allow a realization in our
[1:16:39] identification of who we are in Christ
[1:16:41] right now to be controlled by who we
[1:16:44] were or what what Satan did in our past
[1:16:48] then we're never gonna be able to get
[1:16:50] any farther with Christ I think as
[1:16:52] believers as in this this day today
[1:16:56] April 12 2020 I just felt it on my heart
[1:17:00] to encourage you to really look at who
[1:17:03] you are in Christ and to realize you are
[1:17:07] what restoration looks like it's not
[1:17:09] because of your if your your past or how
[1:17:11] perfect you are it's not because of your
[1:17:15] own estimation of what you think you are
[1:17:16] or what you what you have yet to work on
[1:17:19] all of us have things to work on all of
[1:17:22] us have have difficult situations and
[1:17:25] many are the afflictions of the
[1:17:27] righteous many of us have you know some
[1:17:30] of us may have tempers some of us may be
[1:17:31] more opinionated than others some of us
[1:17:34] may have a looser tongue than others
[1:17:37] that's a given we live in falling bodies
[1:17:40] we're gonna have that until the rapture
[1:17:42] but in God's eyes a people who hold to
[1:17:46] the message of the hour the people who
[1:17:49] hold to who Christ is and they're
[1:17:51] allowing the word to be made known in
[1:17:53] their lives in this day in the midst of
[1:17:56] Satan's Eden in the midst of the
[1:17:58] Laodicean Church age and you stand for
[1:18:01] that you are God's idea of restoration I
[1:18:05] love that now if you go back just on a
[1:18:08] just even on a personal level because I
[1:18:11] believe that God can restore us
[1:18:12] personally he there's an anointing that
[1:18:15] is on every age and within that
[1:18:17] anointing the bride will produce what
[1:18:20] she is supposed to produce God regulates
[1:18:22] the the bride to meet the season that
[1:18:26] she is in so he doesn't regulate the
[1:18:28] season to meet the bride she regulates
[1:18:30] the bride to meet the season that you're
[1:18:31] in because he has everything working
[1:18:33] according to His perfect will everything
[1:18:35] that is scripturally determined to
[1:18:38] happen will happen and he regulates your
[1:18:40] ability to meet the season that you are
[1:18:42] in tell me we look at the world when we
[1:18:44] look at the place at its at we look at
[1:18:46] just how hard it is to scratch a living
[1:18:49] from the face of the earth
[1:18:50] look at all these different things we
[1:18:52] look at the face of our companies and
[1:18:54] the economy and all these things God
[1:18:56] regulates our ability to meet the season
[1:18:59] that we are in so you don't have to
[1:19:01] worry about whether or not you can
[1:19:02] handle it he's already given you what
[1:19:04] you need to handle it and I realize I'm
[1:19:07] speaking very simply this morning but
[1:19:08] that's that's on purpose you you have
[1:19:11] everything inside of you that you need
[1:19:13] to meet the season that you are in you
[1:19:17] have everything that you need to raise
[1:19:19] your family in in the correct way you
[1:19:21] don't need to worry about it
[1:19:23] worrying is valueless it's something
[1:19:25] that may or may not happen so stop
[1:19:28] worrying about that and rather focus on
[1:19:30] faith because there is great value in
[1:19:33] faith because it's the evidence of the
[1:19:35] things that you don't see it's that it's
[1:19:37] the very substance of the things that we
[1:19:39] hope for but it's not good enough just a
[1:19:42] hope you have to be firmly decided and I
[1:19:46] think that's what that's what God is
[1:19:47] looking for you are the redeemed you are
[1:19:50] you you've made it this far and if
[1:19:53] you've made it this far he will he will
[1:19:55] help you make it the rest of the way if
[1:19:58] God has brought you this far then don't
[1:20:01] worry it's valueless have the faith to
[1:20:05] believe that you'll make it the rest of
[1:20:07] the way regardless of what the world
[1:20:09] throws at you regardless of the hardship
[1:20:11] that you will endure it's a hard life a
[1:20:14] Christian life is our life you can make
[1:20:17] it because God as he says in Romans 12
[1:20:20] he's given you the measure of faith so
[1:20:23] abide in the in the measure of faith
[1:20:24] that God has given you so he's given you
[1:20:26] the exact amount of faith that you need
[1:20:28] to overcome that which he has given you
[1:20:31] to overcome you don't have to agree
[1:20:33] about that at all
[1:20:34] I was thinking of just in terms of what
[1:20:38] restoration actually looks like because
[1:20:41] we have this idea of God is restoring
[1:20:43] the the bride tree and you know I think
[1:20:46] in our own minds and maybe this is just
[1:20:48] me I don't know but maybe the tendency
[1:20:50] is to think of oh I've got to be
[1:20:52] something I've got this image of what I
[1:20:55] want to be and it's more perfect than
[1:20:57] within what I am right now and I think
[1:21:00] that that as God leads
[1:21:02] through the Christian journey he he
[1:21:06] helps us overcome the things that we see
[1:21:07] in our own lives he helps us to realize
[1:21:12] that his power is real and just the same
[1:21:16] as it was yesterday is it can be today
[1:21:18] in helping us overcome the things that
[1:21:21] we struggle with and I believe that that
[1:21:23] we need to to allow that to happen
[1:21:25] but just as in a personal restoration as
[1:21:28] God has the anointing over his bride in
[1:21:30] this age to accomplish that which she
[1:21:33] has been ordained to accomplish you know
[1:21:35] personal lives he is also restored us as
[1:21:38] well and if you look at Luke chapter 8
[1:21:42] and verse 26 and I think it starts at
[1:21:45] verse 26 jesus and his disciples they
[1:21:49] come across the sea and they're there
[1:21:51] and they land on they land on the on the
[1:21:54] bank and then they're walking up to the
[1:21:56] land of the Garcinia which is also known
[1:22:00] as Ghaderi so they're walking along the
[1:22:02] path and I love this story
[1:22:05] Jesus and His disciples are walking
[1:22:07] along the path and then all of a sudden
[1:22:09] a naked man jumps out in front of them
[1:22:12] and I think you know if you're if you
[1:22:15] you know that may not be very odd at
[1:22:18] Newfoundland I don't know but in in
[1:22:20] North Carolina in rural North Carolina
[1:22:21] and people don't typically do that so I
[1:22:24] can imagine just the shock that must
[1:22:27] have happened and the disciples were
[1:22:28] probably you know thinking what's going
[1:22:31] on and then Jesus was there and
[1:22:34] everything like that and this man jumped
[1:22:36] out at him and the the discourse that
[1:22:39] begins to take place this man had he ran
[1:22:44] the hills naked he was in the tombs he
[1:22:47] was known as the maniac of Ghaderi
[1:22:49] and he was there and the Devils
[1:22:51] immediately knew who Jesus was
[1:22:53] and it's almost like they didn't even
[1:22:55] talk about anything else they they they
[1:22:57] immediately said please don't cast us
[1:23:00] into the deep so they knew their own
[1:23:02] fate so this man was bound up by Legion
[1:23:06] himself he was just bound up with with
[1:23:08] such a a difficult thing
[1:23:13] and and then he Jesus prays for him the
[1:23:18] Devils are cast out he heals him and we
[1:23:21] know that the story that takes place and
[1:23:24] after he heals him he's sitting at the
[1:23:28] feet of Jesus and Jesus is talking to
[1:23:29] him and they you know the story that the
[1:23:33] castle Legion out he goes into the
[1:23:35] swimming line and goes down into the to
[1:23:37] the rocks and things like that and I
[1:23:40] think I think we passed by that area
[1:23:43] that they think that that happened and
[1:23:45] brother Joe was on that trip in Israel
[1:23:47] that when we did that I don't know if he
[1:23:48] remembers that and it was it was known
[1:23:52] as the place of Ghaderi and the garcinia
[1:23:54] --nz where the were there so that he was
[1:23:56] healed
[1:23:56] and he was just a miraculous healing
[1:23:58] because everyone in that town every one
[1:24:01] of the garcinia knew that this man was
[1:24:04] crazy and that nothing could help them
[1:24:06] they chained him hold him down and he
[1:24:08] break the chains which back time the
[1:24:10] change was pretty pretty hefty so he
[1:24:12] would break the chains and go out and
[1:24:14] the spirit would drive him out in the
[1:24:15] wilderness he was a crazy man he ran
[1:24:17] around naked and it was just a just a
[1:24:20] horrible thing so all of the people were
[1:24:22] aware of this man and brother branham
[1:24:26] said in several quotes he said he he had
[1:24:29] an old gray-headed mother who was at
[1:24:31] home praying for him so this man had
[1:24:33] family that was in Ghaderi and he was
[1:24:37] not able to be with his family because
[1:24:38] his spirit would drive him out of the
[1:24:39] wilderness and they can go crazy and it
[1:24:41] was Legion so Jesus cast Legion out and
[1:24:44] he's all gone and then the Garcinia to
[1:24:50] begin to come out of the city and begin
[1:24:53] to see what's going on because they
[1:24:55] began to hear it so they're all
[1:24:57] gathering around and then after a while
[1:24:59] they begin to get afraid because they
[1:25:01] see the guy that this they knew was a
[1:25:03] crazy man and they knew it was very
[1:25:05] dangerous so they see the guy and he's
[1:25:08] sitting at the feet of Jesus clothed
[1:25:09] like a normal guy and then they see
[1:25:11] Jesus they're preaching and they don't
[1:25:13] really know what's going on so it's
[1:25:15] almost like they couldn't digest it they
[1:25:16] just couldn't believe it and they saw it
[1:25:18] in with their very own eyes and they
[1:25:21] still couldn't accept it and I think
[1:25:23] that's what that's a
[1:25:25] a testimony to a believer that they they
[1:25:29] see it and when the word is made flesh
[1:25:32] they can still accept it and I you know
[1:25:35] if you go back in the scripture in in
[1:25:38] the Old Testament it was the word the
[1:25:40] law and and you know that that was that
[1:25:44] was the word and then in John chapter 1
[1:25:47] it says the Word was made flesh and so
[1:25:49] the word was actually made flesh in
[1:25:50] Jesus Christ and they couldn't accept
[1:25:53] that transition of the word made flesh
[1:25:54] they could accept the test of the law
[1:25:57] they could accept the the word when it
[1:25:59] was in its former form but when God
[1:26:01] moved forward that's when they couldn't
[1:26:03] accept it and then in today's time in
[1:26:05] after the the resurrection which is a
[1:26:08] symbol of today after that time the word
[1:26:11] was made flesh then what did Jesus do he
[1:26:13] poured it into his bride so we see that
[1:26:16] the word was made into a the fullness of
[1:26:18] the Godhead bodily was made into a mini
[1:26:21] member bride so the word was made flesh
[1:26:23] again so when people see us at the the
[1:26:27] bride adhering to the Word of God and
[1:26:29] they see it even if you just take a
[1:26:31] simple scripture like first Corinthians
[1:26:33] 11 and a woman shouldn't cut her hair
[1:26:35] and they look at that and they see it in
[1:26:37] the end they know that the scripture
[1:26:39] says that and they still can't adhere to
[1:26:42] it they failed to make the transition
[1:26:44] they know that Jesus was the Word made
[1:26:47] flesh but then again they're still
[1:26:48] looking back and they can't look for it
[1:26:50] and they can't see it in there in the
[1:26:52] very own eyes and it was exactly like
[1:26:54] these people today they are in in in
[1:26:58] Ghaderi they could not they could not
[1:27:01] accept this
[1:27:01] so Jesus leaves he goes across the sea
[1:27:04] and heals gyruss his daughter it says
[1:27:07] very next thing that happened so he goes
[1:27:09] across and there's another healing on
[1:27:10] the other side of Galilee but for right
[1:27:12] now he's there and the man who was
[1:27:14] healed he looks at Jesus and he says can
[1:27:18] I follow you can I come with you so he
[1:27:22] asks to do the very thing that the rich
[1:27:25] young ruler refused to do when he was
[1:27:28] told to do that by Jesus this man
[1:27:30] actually asks and he said Lord can I
[1:27:33] follow you can I be a disciple let me
[1:27:35] come with you I mean my whole life is
[1:27:37] just
[1:27:38] Rek let me come with you and brother
[1:27:41] branham said that he you know maybe he
[1:27:43] had a drinking problem maybe we can
[1:27:44] begin to drink and that's what drove him
[1:27:46] out and eventual out the spirits to get
[1:27:48] get ahold of him and now he's standing
[1:27:50] and he's restored so he's healing which
[1:27:54] was a atoned for on the cross but when
[1:27:58] Jesus the very word healed him and in
[1:28:00] polled Legion Al he was standing there
[1:28:02] fully restored in his restored state and
[1:28:04] he said now Lord I want to follow you
[1:28:07] and Jesus said no absolutely not so what
[1:28:10] I want you to do is use turn around and
[1:28:13] I want you to go go back home I want you
[1:28:15] to go back and live among the Garcinia I
[1:28:17] want you to go back to guard era Ghaderi
[1:28:20] and I want you to live a normal life and
[1:28:22] the scripture says I want you to
[1:28:25] proclaim that which you have seen and
[1:28:27] that word proclaim in the Greek it means
[1:28:30] I think it means to prou clear I think
[1:28:35] my Greek is a little rusty but it's he
[1:28:38] says in other words that the definition
[1:28:41] of that word means to preach so he says
[1:28:43] I want you to go back live a normal life
[1:28:46] and I want you to preach to the Garcinia
[1:28:49] that which has happened to you now think
[1:28:52] about it for a second because Jesus says
[1:28:53] I don't want you to follow me I want you
[1:28:55] to go back and live a normal life and
[1:28:56] then he leaves because the people drive
[1:28:59] him out they basically said hey we don't
[1:29:00] want you around get out here so he goes
[1:29:03] across Galilee and this man then has to
[1:29:05] go home in other words Jesus he he pulls
[1:29:09] him out of his current condition he
[1:29:11] changes him heals him he restores him
[1:29:15] and then he sends him right back out
[1:29:17] into the the town that refused him and
[1:29:21] that it couldn't help him and now he has
[1:29:24] to live a normal life and go on
[1:29:26] testifying as to what Jesus Christ did
[1:29:28] to him
[1:29:29] so that he has to basically go and live
[1:29:31] a normal life with the people that just
[1:29:33] sent Jesus away that's a challenging
[1:29:36] place to be and if you think about it he
[1:29:40] says do this he's telling him to live a
[1:29:44] normal life imagine now after Ghaderi I
[1:29:48] mean we see that in the maniac of
[1:29:49] Ghaderi but think about that May
[1:29:51] life after he was restored he basically
[1:29:55] had to go to the supermarket he had to
[1:29:57] go back and go to his home he had to go
[1:30:00] find a trade or work or go back to his
[1:30:02] work he had to go back to his family
[1:30:04] think about the first time that he was
[1:30:05] walking just a pair of rice if he was
[1:30:08] walking through the supermarket and he's
[1:30:10] I mean you know people are looking at
[1:30:13] him and saying is that the guy that ran
[1:30:15] naked through the tombs I mean he can
[1:30:19] imagine how awkward of a life that would
[1:30:21] be and I mean even if even then in the
[1:30:23] historical sense in in those times and
[1:30:26] you know the the the harsh reality of
[1:30:29] living in those times in those days it
[1:30:31] would still be extremely awkward to see
[1:30:34] him at the well or whoever it may have
[1:30:35] been and to say that's the guy that was
[1:30:38] a crazy man that was you know going out
[1:30:41] over all these places
[1:30:42] that's what restoration looked like he
[1:30:46] had been transformed he had been renewed
[1:30:49] as the scripture says behold all things
[1:30:51] are made new and those who are in Christ
[1:30:53] old things are passed away and that's
[1:30:56] exactly what it was like so for him
[1:30:58] living in Ghaderi he is but he had been
[1:31:00] restored in a physical sense
[1:31:02] and that was what restoration looked
[1:31:05] like was a normal life people looking at
[1:31:07] him kind of weird and God sent him right
[1:31:10] Jesus sent him right back into the place
[1:31:12] of great challenge and great difficulty
[1:31:14] and said go live a normal life tell
[1:31:17] people what happened to you in the
[1:31:19] lively over the last time I was in New
[1:31:20] Zealand I preached about that how God
[1:31:22] pulls us out of laodicea he pulls us out
[1:31:25] of Babylon he says come out of her my
[1:31:27] people and then he changes you in what
[1:31:29] in and in and completely renews you and
[1:31:32] it's that it's his power to transform
[1:31:35] his brother branham said and then he
[1:31:36] turns you right around and sends you
[1:31:38] right back into the world with a
[1:31:39] commission says now go and preach the
[1:31:41] gospel every tongue a nation so he
[1:31:44] changes you brings you into his church
[1:31:45] and then he turns you right back out and
[1:31:47] says now go live a normal life go tell
[1:31:49] people what I've done for you go tell
[1:31:51] people about Who I am and what it means
[1:31:53] to live free I love that that's what
[1:31:57] restoration look like now that's even in
[1:31:59] a cross since if you go back even
[1:32:00] further as brother John was talking
[1:32:03] about
[1:32:03] last night the children of Israel in in
[1:32:06] the promised land in possession and what
[1:32:08] it means to be an overcomer and and the
[1:32:11] answer that an overcomer has if you
[1:32:14] explained it if you just expand and look
[1:32:16] over Israel's time they came out of
[1:32:18] Egypt they went through the wilderness
[1:32:20] and then as they go into the Promised
[1:32:22] Land the Promised Land is not that the
[1:32:24] is not heaven the Promised Land does not
[1:32:27] represent heaven because it was the holy
[1:32:29] ghost working through his people to
[1:32:31] possess the land so Joshua and his
[1:32:35] people possessing the land and they were
[1:32:37] going there was Wars there were famines
[1:32:39] there were all kinds of different things
[1:32:40] going on that cannot represent heaven
[1:32:42] that was a precursor to heaven but they
[1:32:45] were restored
[1:32:46] so scripture if you really if you just
[1:32:48] look at it now the time is very similar
[1:32:50] to where we are now in history 1987
[1:32:54] Easter's later we're standing in 2022 or
[1:32:58] 2020 and we're seeing that we are the
[1:33:03] restored we've been brought back to
[1:33:05] where God wants us to be and I think it
[1:33:09] now if you look at it in terms of the
[1:33:11] wheat and the analogy of a wheat plant
[1:33:15] we are in a time of history where the
[1:33:17] fruit is is is which is God's very own
[1:33:22] life his Spirit is on the vine so it's
[1:33:25] it's not a growing season according to
[1:33:28] Scripture it's a ripening season so if
[1:33:30] you take that if you take the analogy of
[1:33:32] the wheat and we look at this and we see
[1:33:34] that Israel just to bring that in they
[1:33:36] went through all the the things that
[1:33:38] they went through came out of Egypt
[1:33:39] through the wilderness and then they
[1:33:41] were in the land and they spent time in
[1:33:43] the land possessing so they were
[1:33:45] restored to where they were supposed to
[1:33:47] be and in that there was a great
[1:33:49] challenge that was great difficulty they
[1:33:51] had to possess that that position so
[1:33:54] they they came back to who they were
[1:33:56] supposed to be and they had to possess
[1:33:58] it now if you look at the the analogy
[1:34:00] the wheat and you expand it across the
[1:34:02] church ages you see that the the seed
[1:34:05] goes into the ground and then it comes
[1:34:06] up and then the stock and in that you
[1:34:09] see the wheat plant it comes up it comes
[1:34:11] out of the ground it goes up and then
[1:34:12] you go into the tassel and you go and
[1:34:14] I'm not a farmer so I'd know it I've
[1:34:17] just gone through my knowledge of what
[1:34:20] this is but you go through this the the
[1:34:22] husk and then you have the fruit so then
[1:34:24] you have the seed on the outside of the
[1:34:26] husk so it goes through a growing season
[1:34:29] and then you have the seed that is on
[1:34:33] the vine
[1:34:34] so you have the fruit that is on the
[1:34:36] vine which is the original original seed
[1:34:38] so it's exactly the same life that was
[1:34:40] on the inside it goes out to the outside
[1:34:42] can you see that all throughout that
[1:34:45] time was growing but it wasn't the fruit
[1:34:49] so the harvest time which is where we
[1:34:51] are right now is a ripening season
[1:34:54] because the food is on the vine the
[1:34:56] stalk in the in the shed the the husk
[1:35:00] they don't ripen there's no there's
[1:35:02] nothing to ripen they're not mature they
[1:35:04] are growing so all throughout the church
[1:35:06] ages you see God's church is growing and
[1:35:09] they're growing in the growing they held
[1:35:11] the life at one time and then all of a
[1:35:13] sudden they get up to the to the fruit
[1:35:14] and this the the seed is on the the food
[1:35:17] is on the bond the fruit is what ripens
[1:35:20] so it matures so it's it's what it's the
[1:35:24] original seed it's what God intended so
[1:35:26] it's restored - it's real - it's real
[1:35:29] position but it has to lay out in the
[1:35:32] presence of the Sun in order to ripen
[1:35:35] the fruit so it's a maturing season as
[1:35:38] we await the harvest so it is harvest
[1:35:41] season but the only thing that the the
[1:35:43] the farmer is waiting for it's like the
[1:35:45] farm that goes out into the farmer goes
[1:35:49] out into the field and he puts if he can
[1:35:52] put a dent in the wheat he knows that
[1:35:55] it's ready for harvest so he's there and
[1:35:57] he puts the little dent in the harvest
[1:35:59] and in the seed and he knows it's us
[1:36:00] it's it's harvest time it's it is the
[1:36:03] time for the harvest but there is a
[1:36:05] season when the fruit is laying on the
[1:36:07] vine and it matures and it ripens and
[1:36:09] that's exactly what's happening right
[1:36:11] now so you look at this this is what
[1:36:14] this is the time of restoration God has
[1:36:17] brought you back to a place where you
[1:36:19] hold to the unadulterated Word of God
[1:36:21] and he's working in you his spirit is
[1:36:23] alive in you just as much as he was
[1:36:26] working in
[1:36:26] in Luther's time and when he was working
[1:36:29] on Luther in the different things that
[1:36:32] he was in the different places that he
[1:36:33] brought him to in his life to be able to
[1:36:36] bring to him the revelation of who he
[1:36:38] was in Christ that I am justified by my
[1:36:41] faith and then all him and he moves on
[1:36:43] to Wesley and Luther gets old and he
[1:36:45] goes off the scene and then Wesley he
[1:36:47] goes through English to America he helps
[1:36:49] the Indians and he goes back to England
[1:36:51] and he does all these different things
[1:36:52] and he's you know learning all the
[1:36:54] different things in in in seminary and
[1:36:56] all these different things he's doing
[1:36:57] God is leading him in his life and then
[1:37:00] you come up to the Pentecostal age and
[1:37:01] Azusa Street starts and all the
[1:37:03] different things it's happening
[1:37:04] he beats brother Brandon to where he is
[1:37:05] and the bird you know brings him up in
[1:37:09] Kentucky and then brings him all over
[1:37:10] the world and then brother Branham goes
[1:37:12] off the scene and then you have
[1:37:13] different believers popping up
[1:37:14] everywhere and then some of you were
[1:37:16] born and during that time or before that
[1:37:20] time and he's moved each one of you to
[1:37:22] different spots in your life and maybe
[1:37:24] he kept you on on the rock but he's led
[1:37:28] you to certain areas in your life I just
[1:37:30] think it's amazing that the moving of
[1:37:32] the Holy Spirit and all of those times
[1:37:33] although there's an anointing over the
[1:37:35] age that you are in so we moved from
[1:37:37] Luther's age to Wesley's age to the
[1:37:40] Pentecostal age - now the bride age
[1:37:42] that's when the fruit is on the vine and
[1:37:44] that is when it's ripening that's what's
[1:37:47] happening to you right now it's a
[1:37:48] harvest season and we're ready to be
[1:37:50] pulled up into the garner I think that's
[1:37:54] an amazing thing that's what restoration
[1:37:56] looks like and you are those people that
[1:37:58] are to be harvested you are those people
[1:38:01] that are there that God has placed there
[1:38:02] listen to this 1965 this is a few weeks
[1:38:07] before brother man would die and he says
[1:38:10] this and he starts to pray this is a
[1:38:12] lengthy quote but I want to read it he
[1:38:14] says this is not the day of Pentecost
[1:38:16] the Pentecost age is past
[1:38:17] Pentecost is gone this is the harvest
[1:38:20] time and the harvest time the grain the
[1:38:23] waters done been poured out the grains
[1:38:25] getting right come into the grain my
[1:38:27] dear brother hear me believe me if you
[1:38:29] believe me to be a servant of God let
[1:38:31] each one in your in our own way bow our
[1:38:34] head and humility and offer the prayer
[1:38:35] that we should offer God take me as I am
[1:38:38] and knowing that something has to follow
[1:38:42] that and he says this nation has been
[1:38:45] shipped back and forth or through
[1:38:46] revivals and indications and things like
[1:38:48] that he said knowing that something has
[1:38:50] to follow that and if you just skip down
[1:38:52] further past the quote he says dear God
[1:38:54] as he begins to pray it says do you God
[1:38:56] you've healed our sickness and you
[1:38:58] forgive our sins and Lord of not being
[1:39:01] the kind of Christian that we ought to
[1:39:02] be
[1:39:02] he said professing to be a full gospel
[1:39:04] man or woman and here we find ourselves
[1:39:06] slumping often to do not that like a
[1:39:08] denominational chicken it says help us
[1:39:11] dear God and take us and shake us with
[1:39:13] your Holy Spirit and if there be
[1:39:16] anything in us that's not like you take
[1:39:18] it out of us Lord and plant our feet on
[1:39:21] the on God's holy word and let the Holy
[1:39:24] Ghost burn down in our heart and take
[1:39:27] all the dross of unbelief and all the
[1:39:28] drowsiness of this day and all the Lord
[1:39:31] maybe will rise and shake ourselves
[1:39:34] granite God cleanse mold us make us God
[1:39:38] granted and if there's any in here
[1:39:40] tonight Lord that's holding in their
[1:39:42] heart that grain that gene of God that's
[1:39:45] ordained a life from the foundation of
[1:39:47] the world I know Lord that they're bound
[1:39:49] to hear it at this hour and so I pray
[1:39:53] God that you'll fill their soul
[1:39:55] illuminate them with the fresh baptism
[1:39:57] of the Holy Ghost and send them on their
[1:39:59] Road rejoicing and happy it's almost
[1:40:03] like brother Branham is saying to us the
[1:40:06] exact same thing that Jesus told the
[1:40:09] maniac of Ghaderi after something
[1:40:10] amazing and happened to him go on your
[1:40:13] way rejoicing and happy live a normal
[1:40:15] life and I want you to to proclaim that
[1:40:18] which I have shown you and here brother
[1:40:22] Branham is saying the exact same thing
[1:40:23] Lord I pray that you'd fill them and
[1:40:25] illuminate with them with the fresh
[1:40:26] baptism of the Holy Ghost and send them
[1:40:28] on the road rejoicing and happy see the
[1:40:32] anointing of the Holy Ghost in that age
[1:40:33] will produce everything that it needs to
[1:40:36] produce in the believer as Isaiah 55
[1:40:39] says my word it shall not return unto me
[1:40:42] void so if you look at the bride tree
[1:40:44] itself in the heart of that of that tree
[1:40:48] is Christ its Christ very own life
[1:40:51] so in the bride Trina's as the church
[1:40:53] ages go the the the tree was eaten down
[1:40:55] by all the different the four stages of
[1:40:58] the of the kink of woman in the Palmer
[1:41:02] worm and the caterpillar and it was
[1:41:04] eaten down to the very core of that tree
[1:41:06] and Christ was at the core of that tree
[1:41:09] and what he's promised was I will
[1:41:11] restore to you again everything that was
[1:41:13] eaten down there will be a time in
[1:41:15] history when everything will be back in
[1:41:17] its place and the fruit will be on the
[1:41:20] vine and now it's that time 1987 East
[1:41:24] years later now it's that time and today
[1:41:27] is that time and you are living in that
[1:41:29] time I just think it's so awesome that
[1:41:33] we are sitting wherever you're sitting
[1:41:35] right now you're living in a time with
[1:41:38] an anointing over you that the Holy
[1:41:41] Ghost will produce everything in your
[1:41:43] life that it was supposed to produce and
[1:41:45] you're standing there the result of what
[1:41:47] restoration really looks like but we
[1:41:50] still all we sit back and we look at
[1:41:52] ourselves we think am I really what
[1:41:56] restoration looks like and God he
[1:41:58] changed you he formed you he his
[1:42:02] intention of you was formed before the
[1:42:04] foundation of the world and what you see
[1:42:07] yourself in as today in the fallen flesh
[1:42:10] you see all of your mistakes you think
[1:42:11] see all the things that you need to work
[1:42:13] on and God is holding to something that
[1:42:15] he already proclaimed over you before
[1:42:18] the foundation of the world so God is
[1:42:20] looking far beyond what would you see
[1:42:22] him yourself today and in your
[1:42:24] shortcomings in your issues he's looking
[1:42:26] at the promise that overrides what you
[1:42:30] think you need to be he's looking at the
[1:42:31] the promise of restoration he's looking
[1:42:34] at what the original seed was which is
[1:42:35] what it will be when the rapture comes
[1:42:38] he's looking at what you were before the
[1:42:40] foundation of the world and you look at
[1:42:42] yourself just on this day and say oh my
[1:42:45] I'm not what I need to be well of course
[1:42:46] you're not this is a time of ripening
[1:42:49] and maturing God wants to mold in you
[1:42:51] and mature you because character is a
[1:42:53] victory it's not a gift in character is
[1:42:56] the only thing that you're going to take
[1:42:57] with you on the other side so as we as I
[1:43:00] mentioned that the brother that passed
[1:43:01] away when he's laying there in the cast
[1:43:03] in his own estimation right before he
[1:43:06] died he said probably I nowhere near
[1:43:08] where I need to be but in God's eyes he
[1:43:10] was because God had brought him through
[1:43:12] all that he needed to be and there was
[1:43:14] an anointing over the age that that man
[1:43:17] had yielded himself to and said Lord let
[1:43:20] the Holy Spirit make in me what you want
[1:43:23] to see and as he as you go through life
[1:43:26] you will overcome because that's the
[1:43:28] anointing of a believer this time is to
[1:43:30] overcome is to possess as the children
[1:43:32] of Israel they got into the wilderness
[1:43:34] and they were possessing the land they
[1:43:36] were doing hard things
[1:43:37] that's what restoration looked like
[1:43:39] that's what it looks like and we have
[1:43:41] the earnest of our inheritance and God
[1:43:43] is looking at the promise that overrides
[1:43:45] us he's not necessarily looking at your
[1:43:47] faults and your shortcomings he is
[1:43:49] working on those because the Holy Spirit
[1:43:51] is is what the fruit that's on the tree
[1:43:54] is God at God's attributes and you were
[1:43:57] an attribute in God before the
[1:43:59] foundation of the world and so ensues
[1:44:02] because of the result of the fall so
[1:44:04] ensues the tug-of-war that happens at
[1:44:05] your mind in your mind and everything
[1:44:08] that you feel like you need to overcome
[1:44:10] this and it I feel like I need to do
[1:44:11] this and we absolutely do need to do
[1:44:13] that and we die daily on the basis we
[1:44:16] bring ourselves back because
[1:44:17] sanctification happens until the the
[1:44:20] change of our bodies but there isn't a
[1:44:22] group there is a greater anointing that
[1:44:24] is on top of you today
[1:44:26] as a result of being in the bride of
[1:44:28] Jesus Christ and adhering to the Word of
[1:44:30] God and placing your faith on that
[1:44:33] promise
[1:44:33] that is what eventually will come it's
[1:44:36] his word shall not return and invite and
[1:44:40] at the very center of that tree was
[1:44:42] Christ himself and now you are standing
[1:44:46] here as a result of the bride of Jesus
[1:44:48] Christ the grain isn't growing its
[1:44:51] ripening it's maturing that's what's
[1:44:54] happening right now it's been 55 years
[1:44:56] since brother Branham passed away the
[1:45:00] things like that John 15 and verse 5 it
[1:45:02] says I am the vine you are the branches
[1:45:04] and he that abideth in me and I in him
[1:45:07] the same bringeth forth much fruit for
[1:45:10] without me you can do nothing and what
[1:45:14] is the fruit it's the Spirit of God it's
[1:45:16] the attributes of
[1:45:17] in your life so as a result of becoming
[1:45:19] the word made flesh which is what you
[1:45:22] are in this day you are the
[1:45:24] manifestation of the Holy Ghost
[1:45:27] you are God's expression his only method
[1:45:30] of expression is through you so that's
[1:45:33] why he says go along your way and live a
[1:45:35] happy joyous life go out and proclaim
[1:45:38] the gospel of who Jesus Christ is is
[1:45:40] because you are the Word made flesh you
[1:45:42] at the very center of that tree that has
[1:45:45] been restored is that which God was in
[1:45:48] this very core which was Christ himself
[1:45:50] the word and now you are the Word made
[1:45:52] flesh you are manifesting the very word
[1:45:55] of God in 1962 brother Panama he says in
[1:45:59] the restoration of the bride tree I said
[1:46:01] God planted his tree to bear spiritual
[1:46:04] fruit this the fruit of the Spirit is
[1:46:07] that right
[1:46:07] he says now what what did man do man
[1:46:09] always tries to make an artificial form
[1:46:12] of it he did back there he does now but
[1:46:14] let's fire hard now quick and and man
[1:46:16] has always tried to take the spiritual
[1:46:19] church and make it an artificial form
[1:46:21] what is God planted that tree what is
[1:46:24] the tree to do to show forth the fruits
[1:46:27] of the spirit now I don't think there's
[1:46:32] any other explanation of this and I mean
[1:46:37] there's so many but in my mind and what
[1:46:40] struck my heart and I don't know if I
[1:46:42] talked about this the last time I was
[1:46:43] there or not but Shamgar I don't think I
[1:46:48] I just I love this story and just in my
[1:46:50] heart and in my mind it all comes
[1:46:52] together so beautifully if you look at
[1:46:55] in judges chapter 3 I think it's verse
[1:46:58] 30 but verse 30 31 it wind sham gar and
[1:47:01] all it says is that there was this man
[1:47:04] and he flew 600 Philistines with an ox
[1:47:07] code and also delivered Israel and I
[1:47:09] think of that and I think oh my goodness
[1:47:11] if we if just before I mentioned that if
[1:47:15] you go if you look in Revelations 8 or
[1:47:18] 10 8 through 11 it says and I John heard
[1:47:21] the voice from heaven that spake unto me
[1:47:23] again and said go take the little book
[1:47:25] which is open in the hands of the angel
[1:47:27] which was which standeth upon the scene
[1:47:30] upon the earth John a representation of
[1:47:32] the bride
[1:47:33] he heard the angels say something to him
[1:47:36] and he had a revelation of what he was
[1:47:38] to do so he knew he knew what he was to
[1:47:41] do he goes up and he takes the book out
[1:47:44] of the hand of the angel and he eats
[1:47:46] enemy he consumes it it becomes a part
[1:47:48] of him and then it was in his belly
[1:47:51] bitter but it was in his mouth sweet as
[1:47:53] honey and then the angel didn't say
[1:47:56] stand says to him and go out and
[1:47:58] prophesy again to all the nations and to
[1:48:01] all the tongues so the John basically he
[1:48:03] takes the book now he keeps oh he
[1:48:05] understands and he catches the vision so
[1:48:08] he hears the angel say to him you have
[1:48:10] to take the book go up and take the book
[1:48:12] and it's exactly what's happened today
[1:48:15] because as a result of Malachi chapter 4
[1:48:18] and revelations 10 7 something has
[1:48:21] happened to you that your heart
[1:48:24] something has happened in your heart
[1:48:26] where your faith is just the same as it
[1:48:29] was with the Apostolic fathers so if you
[1:48:33] look at yourself now and ask yourself
[1:48:35] the question what happened to you that
[1:48:38] your faith was turned back to the same
[1:48:40] faith the same just simple faith that
[1:48:42] the Apostolic fathers had in the
[1:48:44] resurrection of who Jesus Christ was and
[1:48:46] the adherence to the Word of God they
[1:48:48] saw the flesh they saw Jesus being made
[1:48:51] flesh and they they accepted it and
[1:48:54] today we see that the the word made
[1:48:56] flesh in our own lives and we have to
[1:48:58] accept that as well and something has
[1:49:00] happened turn my heart to the faith of
[1:49:03] the Pentecostal fathers something has
[1:49:04] happened for you to you to do that and
[1:49:06] it's happened and you cannot take that
[1:49:09] revelation away from me you cannot take
[1:49:12] the the fact that the Word of God is
[1:49:14] true and there's nothing else on this
[1:49:15] earth that is steady or that is solid or
[1:49:18] that I can place my faith on except for
[1:49:21] the basis of the Word of God and when I
[1:49:23] place my faith on the basis of the Word
[1:49:25] of God the Holy Spirit that can then
[1:49:27] come and work on that so when you hold
[1:49:29] to the scripture and you place your
[1:49:31] faith on that the Holy Spirit can
[1:49:33] quicken that in your life and it makes
[1:49:35] it a manifestation of who God is and so
[1:49:38] that's exactly what happened to John in
[1:49:39] in in the book
[1:49:41] go take the book something happened tell
[1:49:44] us to say I want the book I gotta go
[1:49:47] take the book I gotta know who I am in
[1:49:49] the book was the book of redemption it
[1:49:51] was it was the the who Christ was and
[1:49:53] who God made him in this day that's what
[1:49:55] the seals were is is the redemption
[1:49:58] story he told you who you were in Christ
[1:50:01] and if you go back even and just pull it
[1:50:04] back even simpler the revelation in it
[1:50:07] says it in crisis mystery of God
[1:50:08] revealed the new birth is the revelation
[1:50:10] of who Jesus Christ is to you so this
[1:50:13] revelation at John and it's the
[1:50:15] anointing over the age this revelation
[1:50:17] he said go take the book go you need to
[1:50:20] know who you are John took in any alien
[1:50:22] and he understood who it was so he
[1:50:24] caught the vision and that's exactly
[1:50:26] what's happened in today something has
[1:50:27] happened where we have the same faith
[1:50:29] that we can see in the pentacle and in
[1:50:31] the Apostolic fathers we have that same
[1:50:33] faith that adheres to the Word of God
[1:50:35] and is able to see the manifestation of
[1:50:38] the Holy Ghost and say that's the truth
[1:50:40] I want that I have to follow that it's
[1:50:42] exactly what's happened and that's what
[1:50:44] restoration looks like is it people not
[1:50:46] who are perfect because there hasn't
[1:50:48] been anybody perfect in the 1987 Eastern
[1:50:51] morning's under has it but anybody
[1:50:53] that's been perfect in that time but
[1:50:56] there have been a people who adhere to
[1:50:58] what they see in the Word of God and I
[1:51:01] and understand their identification in
[1:51:04] it and that's what God is looking for
[1:51:06] who is Jesus Christ to you personally
[1:51:09] and you adhere to that revelation of who
[1:51:11] he is it's not a revelation outside of
[1:51:13] the Bible it's a revelation of who you
[1:51:16] are in Christ which is the word and it's
[1:51:18] made flesh in this day because the word
[1:51:20] as we place our faith on the scripture
[1:51:23] and the Holy Spirit anoints that we
[1:51:25] aren't the very manifestation of the
[1:51:27] Living God in this day it says we are
[1:51:29] peculiar people so that we might show
[1:51:31] forth the praises of God I think that's
[1:51:34] amazing
[1:51:35] and so John caught the vision he
[1:51:38] understood who he was and then he he
[1:51:40] lived it so he ate it he actually took
[1:51:42] in and it became a part of him and then
[1:51:45] he proclaimed it now if you go back to
[1:51:47] Shamgar I love this because he's
[1:51:49] standing there and this is in the
[1:51:51] harvest season
[1:51:53] and he's got fruit on the vine and the
[1:51:56] 600 Philistines come up in in the in the
[1:51:59] place Shamgar was not a soldier he was
[1:52:01] not anybody to be recognized or anything
[1:52:03] like that he's just a normal Joe farm in
[1:52:06] his field sorry Joe he was just a normal
[1:52:09] man farming his field the the guys
[1:52:14] the Philistines which were a fierce
[1:52:16] force to be a force to be reckoned with
[1:52:19] they were standing up there 600 of them
[1:52:21] and he's got his family back here and so
[1:52:25] he's looking there and he says um and I
[1:52:28] I know what's coming
[1:52:30] so he can see the the situation
[1:52:32] unfolding and he looks back and he sees
[1:52:34] his family sitting on the front porch
[1:52:36] and he said they're gonna kill my family
[1:52:38] they're gonna take take this they're
[1:52:40] gonna take everybody else else's food
[1:52:42] and then they're gonna go and sow
[1:52:44] Shamgar is standing there and I love
[1:52:47] this because if you look at it in judges
[1:52:49] this is the portion of scripture in
[1:52:51] between the possession of the land and
[1:52:53] Samuel so this is in between Israel
[1:52:57] coming into whether where they have a
[1:52:59] king and the possession of the land
[1:53:03] so in between Joshua and Samuel you have
[1:53:05] this period of time called the judges
[1:53:07] so now Shamgar is in in the land they've
[1:53:11] possessed the land they're there where
[1:53:13] they need to be and he's still in the
[1:53:14] process of possessing land so God that
[1:53:17] there's a trial that comes and he's
[1:53:20] standing there and he realizes to
[1:53:22] himself I can either give this a shot or
[1:53:26] I can just run so though he understands
[1:53:31] now he says now listen this is a promise
[1:53:34] of God for us to be in this land so they
[1:53:37] keep in mind now there's an overriding
[1:53:39] promise over you as a believer and it's
[1:53:43] not just necessarily your your a daily
[1:53:47] ability to perform well there was an
[1:53:50] overriding scripture that that a promise
[1:53:53] that is is over the age and over you and
[1:53:56] his word God's word shall
[1:53:59] returning void and you are flesh of of
[1:54:02] that flesh bone of that bone you are a
[1:54:05] part of that word because it's inside of
[1:54:06] you behold all things are made new so
[1:54:09] you are now in that restoration because
[1:54:12] of an overriding promise that concerns
[1:54:14] you and so he said guard is standing
[1:54:17] there and he says now listen the law
[1:54:19] says that we are supposed to be here we
[1:54:23] are supposed to be here and those guys
[1:54:25] are not supposed to be here so he's in
[1:54:28] the land he's in a process of possession
[1:54:30] they have been restored and he's saying
[1:54:33] they are not supposed to be here and so
[1:54:37] he looked at his family yeah brother BAM
[1:54:39] explains the story a couple different
[1:54:41] ways I just love the paraphrasing of
[1:54:42] this story and he's got an ox coat with
[1:54:44] a little brass ball on the end of it and
[1:54:46] they come down he killed six Philistines
[1:54:48] they come down he's killed six
[1:54:49] Philistines in other words he's putting
[1:54:51] into action the faith that he has in
[1:54:54] that promise and that's what the fruit
[1:54:57] on the vine looks like a sickness comes
[1:55:01] you place your faith on the Word of God
[1:55:04] that he already healed you we just take
[1:55:08] into account so many times Wow I can't I
[1:55:12] can't do this I can't do that I can't
[1:55:14] overcome this I can't get rid of that I
[1:55:15] want to overcome this this person is
[1:55:18] annoying me that person is annoying me
[1:55:19] Baba Baba and we have all of these
[1:55:21] things at war in our mind being that
[1:55:23] Satan's playground but I in our hearts
[1:55:27] there's something that happened he
[1:55:28] turned the hearts back to the faith of
[1:55:30] the fathers so he's turned something
[1:55:33] back he's turned our our faith and as a
[1:55:35] result of the anointing in this age of
[1:55:38] the message of the hour something turned
[1:55:39] us back to a simple faith and adherence
[1:55:42] to the Word of God and adherence to what
[1:55:44] the Word made flesh looks like in our
[1:55:46] day and so we're standing here and the
[1:55:50] Holy Spirit coming down in you and your
[1:55:52] faith being applied to the scripture you
[1:55:54] have a sickness you have something and
[1:55:56] you look at description who says I am
[1:55:58] the lord that heals all our diseases
[1:56:00] that's something that is true that's a
[1:56:03] promise
[1:56:04] and every promise in the book is yours
[1:56:06] and if you think about it you already
[1:56:08] have been healed you already have over
[1:56:11] you don't fight from a position just
[1:56:15] like Shamgar shame guard they were
[1:56:17] promised that land so he already had won
[1:56:20] the victory he already knew that they
[1:56:22] were supposed to be there
[1:56:23] he gave Abraham that promise he gave
[1:56:25] Moses that promise they were already
[1:56:27] supposed to be there so it was beyond
[1:56:31] Shamgar estimation of his ability to
[1:56:34] take care of the situation but he still
[1:56:37] applied his faith to the Word of God and
[1:56:39] that allowed the Holy Ghost to work
[1:56:41] through him and the Holy Ghost consumed
[1:56:43] him and he killed every single one of
[1:56:45] those six hundred Philistines you today
[1:56:48] you as an individual as a restored
[1:56:51] message believer awaiting the fullness
[1:56:55] of your Redemption the the change of our
[1:56:57] bodies in that in the transition from
[1:56:59] this life to the next awaiting the
[1:57:02] rapture you as a restored individual in
[1:57:05] Christ do not fight from a place or do
[1:57:10] not fight for the victory
[1:57:12] you fight from a position of victory I
[1:57:15] heard a brother Barry say this a while
[1:57:18] back in the church in Hickory you don't
[1:57:20] fight for the victory you've already got
[1:57:23] the victory that's what it means to be
[1:57:27] restored that's why you don't have to
[1:57:29] worry is because faith is of great value
[1:57:31] you place your faith in the Word of God
[1:57:34] the word becomes flesh the word is
[1:57:37] manifested through your very life that
[1:57:39] is the expression of who Jesus Christ is
[1:57:41] in your life that is awesome that is God
[1:57:45] making himself known to do the rest of
[1:57:48] the world that is God allowing you to
[1:57:51] see yourself identified in Scripture you
[1:57:54] are that which is the fruit on the vine
[1:57:56] you are that which is the method of
[1:57:58] expression that God for a name before
[1:58:00] the foundation in the world you don't
[1:58:03] fight for victory
[1:58:04] you've hardly won the victory you fight
[1:58:07] from a position of victory and so
[1:58:10] therefore we apply our faith in the
[1:58:12] daily battles that we have we apply our
[1:58:14] faith in the daily short companies that
[1:58:16] we have which for some of us is more
[1:58:19] than others and we all have them we'll
[1:58:21] all continue to have them
[1:58:23] we apply our faith to the scripture and
[1:58:25] that our overriding anointing that
[1:58:28] promise that we have vindicates itself
[1:58:31] in our lives new fight of a position of
[1:58:34] victory you've already won it man it's
[1:58:36] exactly like Shamgar shame God placed
[1:58:39] his faith and he said ah the law says
[1:58:41] that God said that this is our land it's
[1:58:43] not theirs he placed his faith in that
[1:58:46] he fought and now he's proclaimed and
[1:58:49] all of Israel was delivered because of
[1:58:51] that one action hi I love that I love
[1:58:54] that and if you can hold that in your
[1:58:57] heart and say Lord it's not it's not
[1:59:01] because of my activation of Who I am
[1:59:06] it's not because I have achieved the
[1:59:08] level of perfection that I think I
[1:59:10] should be at it's because you already
[1:59:14] said I overcame to me that's what it
[1:59:19] that's what that's the result you
[1:59:22] believing that is the result of 1987
[1:59:28] Easter mornings in April 12th 2020 and
[1:59:34] this is not this is not nonsense
[1:59:37] April 12 2020 all those times all all
[1:59:40] that history that's ensued
[1:59:42] you sit there a born-again Holy Ghost
[1:59:46] filled believer you are what restoration
[1:59:50] looks like we think oh my goodness I've
[1:59:55] got so much to work on well yeah if we
[1:59:58] all do we all will you need to rest your
[2:00:02] faith in the overriding promise for this
[2:00:05] age don't don't don't walk by sight it
[2:00:08] comes back to a very simple application
[2:00:10] of a very straightforward Scripture
[2:00:12] don't walk by sight you walk by faith
[2:00:15] you say well brother Steve I've got this
[2:00:17] problem in the church and I've got this
[2:00:19] problem with that church well yeah you
[2:00:21] you yeah yeah last time I checked the
[2:00:24] world is full of people and people
[2:00:28] produce more people so I think I think
[2:00:31] we'll continue to have a bra
[2:00:33] until until the the end time that's just
[2:00:38] the way it's gonna be but you have an
[2:00:40] overriding promise of who you are in
[2:00:42] Christ and the word is able to overcome
[2:00:46] everything that'sthat's thrown that
[2:00:48] everything that the world and man alone
[2:00:50] sends it you if you look at the
[2:00:54] description I was thinking of scripture
[2:00:56] in John chapter 11 when he told Martha
[2:00:58] that Martha said I believe that you are
[2:01:01] I believe that that Lazarus will rise
[2:01:03] again and jesus said unto her I am the
[2:01:06] resurrection and the life and he that
[2:01:08] believe on me though he were dead yet
[2:01:11] shall he live Lazarus believed that he
[2:01:15] was the Christ and and on top of that at
[2:01:19] Martha believed for him as well and that
[2:01:21] belief was more powerful than the grave
[2:01:25] so that belief was he last was dead and
[2:01:29] yet that belief that he was the Christ
[2:01:31] when Jesus spoke he came out of the
[2:01:35] grave because he believed on who he was
[2:01:38] and that was more powerful than the
[2:01:40] grave itself and what what what more is
[2:01:43] there
[2:01:44] what more evil is there than death
[2:01:46] itself in the separation and Jesus says
[2:01:51] I am the way I am the resurrection I am
[2:01:54] the life and though you were dead if the
[2:01:56] worst thing that could happen is though
[2:01:57] you were dead that belief in me
[2:01:59] overrides anything that that Satan has
[2:02:03] he's thrown away the keys to death and
[2:02:05] he'll you are the restoration of the
[2:02:09] bride tree and that's why I wanted to
[2:02:12] read that scripture in Deuteronomy 31 be
[2:02:14] strong and of good courage fear not nor
[2:02:17] be afraid of them for the Lord thy God
[2:02:19] is he that do that death go with thee he
[2:02:23] will not fail thee nor forsake thee if
[2:02:29] the musicians want to get ready to sing
[2:02:31] and play I want to close it right there
[2:02:33] and I realized that this is just a very
[2:02:37] I like simple I like simple services so
[2:02:43] I'm not going to apologize for it at all
[2:02:45] I believe
[2:02:46] I believe that we need to take courage
[2:02:51] today and not just because of the
[2:02:53] coronavirus the chronovisor will go away
[2:02:54] and there'll be another one but you know
[2:02:58] and we look at the way that this is
[2:03:00] affecting our companies and our jobs and
[2:03:02] things like this I know several people
[2:03:04] even in my family and things like that
[2:03:06] people who have lost their jobs as a
[2:03:08] result of this I I think we need to take
[2:03:12] courage not just because of the current
[2:03:14] state of the world but because of what
[2:03:16] Satan is trying to get us to disbelieve
[2:03:18] or to get us stumbled in upon and that
[2:03:22] is the fact that I just love this 1987
[2:03:28] Easter morning's later you're sitting
[2:03:31] there you are what restoration looks
[2:03:35] like this is the harvest time this is
[2:03:38] the time when the fruit is on the vine
[2:03:39] this is the time of maturing and
[2:03:41] ripening and that's what God is doing to
[2:03:43] me I don't know about you but I can look
[2:03:44] back over a year I can look back over
[2:03:46] six months and say man I am not the same
[2:03:49] guy I was back then I'm not the guy I
[2:03:51] want to be ain't what I ought to be
[2:03:53] ain't what I I should be but I sure
[2:03:56] ain't what I used to be
[2:03:57] it's brother Branham used to say he
[2:04:00] brought us he brought you this far if
[2:04:05] you look out over that expanse of
[2:04:07] history and dig me maybe you've only
[2:04:09] been alive for 60 years of that that
[2:04:11] time or of you know 30 years at that
[2:04:14] time I don't know but he brought to you
[2:04:16] this far he'll bring you the rest of the
[2:04:19] way you really have to believe that
[2:04:22] he'll bring you the rest of the way
[2:04:25] continue continue on be strong and be of
[2:04:29] good courage don't be afraid for the
[2:04:32] Lord is your God and he goes with you
[2:04:37] there is an overriding promise over you
[2:04:40] that no demon out of torment could ever
[2:04:42] take away from you no none of your
[2:04:45] personality could ever take away from
[2:04:47] you none of your own inability to
[2:04:49] overcome your personality could ever
[2:04:52] ever take away from you you have an
[2:04:54] overriding promise of the Holy Ghost of
[2:04:56] the word itself
[2:04:58] overriding this time and he regulates
[2:05:02] you to meet the season that you're in
[2:05:04] his word shall not return unto Him void
[2:05:07] you can receive you you can have that if
[2:05:11] he brought to you this far he'll bring
[2:05:13] you the rest of the way
[2:05:15] let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank
[2:05:18] you for this Easter morning thank you
[2:05:21] for the resurrection Lord and I don't
[2:05:25] think there's one individual who can say
[2:05:27] you know what I'm exactly what I need to
[2:05:29] be I am perfect there's nothing that can
[2:05:31] say that you're always going to be with
[2:05:34] us he promised that we all we need is
[2:05:37] the courage to keep going to put one
[2:05:39] foot in front of the other keep just to
[2:05:42] hold our feet in midair and say Lord
[2:05:44] where do you want me to put it down know
[2:05:46] what I pray just for each one in this
[2:05:48] assembly each one wherever they may be
[2:05:50] gathered if they're gathered at home
[2:05:52] lord help us to take courage help us to
[2:05:55] be encouraged by this - no it's not what
[2:06:00] I see in my own eyes it's what he saw
[2:06:02] before the foundation of the world and
[2:06:04] it's so true that's what I am that's
[2:06:08] what I am I'm a result of the
[2:06:10] restorative act of the Holy Ghost and
[2:06:12] even in my fallen flesh I am what
[2:06:16] restoration looks like Lord if there's
[2:06:19] any way if there's anything in our
[2:06:21] hearts or our lives or anything that
[2:06:24] we've neglected to confess or neglected
[2:06:27] to to put down at your altar Lord may we
[2:06:31] do it now may we do it now we ask that
[2:06:35] you'd make us just good simple
[2:06:38] Christians Lord what what you saw on us
[2:06:42] I don't know but you loved us and may we
[2:06:47] realize may we live today like we are
[2:06:50] loved may we live today like we are the
[2:06:54] redeemed because that's what you said
[2:06:55] were and Lord our belief will live far
[2:06:59] beyond the grave
[2:07:00] and I believe that you will you will
[2:07:02] honor that Lord and we wait we await the
[2:07:05] promises of God to be fulfilled but the
[2:07:07] ones that we can lay hold off Lord may
[2:07:10] we as a group of
[2:07:11] people just normal everyday people reach
[2:07:13] out and grab those promises and make
[2:07:15] them alive you are making the word made
[2:07:18] alive you've done it before Lord you've
[2:07:20] healed those who need healing Lord
[2:07:21] you've given those jobs who need jobs
[2:07:23] you've done you've done it or from from
[2:07:25] the time that you rose again and you'll
[2:07:28] continue to do that Lord to make
[2:07:29] yourself alive in your people we are
[2:07:32] people of your kingdom Lord and may we
[2:07:35] just spend the rest of this day with our
[2:07:36] families realizing that's who we are
[2:07:41] it's not my own view of myself although
[2:07:43] we need excel phix Ammon it's what you

[2:08:11] thank y'all for the leadership of the
[2:08:13] Holy Ghost in our brother but thank God
[2:08:15] for the for the brothers willingness to
[2:08:17] let go and let God have his way I was
[2:08:20] surprised when he was said he was gonna
[2:08:22] close I thought he would go on for
[2:08:25] another while they read so so he has
[2:08:28] that Liberty here to want for a couple
[2:08:32] of hours for sure thank God for the
[2:08:35] impression of the ministry is left in
[2:08:37] this assembly and that any preacher
[2:08:39] would feel at home
[2:08:40] amen so we thank God for the word that
[2:08:43] brother Steven brought a man and again
[2:08:46] maybe I could go on for a couple of
[2:08:47] hours because with the notes that that
[2:08:50] the Lord gave me as our brother was
[2:08:53] preaching so it's tremendous but I won't
[2:08:55] do that
[2:08:55] but I was blessed when he highlighted
[2:08:58] the 1900 ascent 87 years since our Lord
[2:09:02] did what he did
[2:09:03] Amen so thank God and pray God's grace
[2:09:07] that the word that we heard today will
[2:09:10] never leave us a mess that we will never
[2:09:12] leave the word the word will never leave
[2:09:14] us Amen but let God make that word flesh
[2:09:18] in you you go forward with that faith
[2:09:20] that God was highlighting through our
[2:09:22] brother Stephen so praise
[2:09:24] the name of the Lord until God be the
[2:09:26] glory god bless our brother Stephen a
[2:09:29] man so I believe it was the Lord a man
[2:09:32] who wasn't brother Stephen it wasn't his

[2:09:35] it was the spiritual revelation by the
[2:09:38] Holy Ghost
