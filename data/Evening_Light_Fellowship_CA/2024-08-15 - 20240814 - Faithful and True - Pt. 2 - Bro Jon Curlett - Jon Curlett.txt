you amen just trusting that they'll be all better soon and Selena as well Hebrews 10: 19 says this having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a New and Living Way which he had con consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having an high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water in other words if God has done a work in your life that ought to give you confidence to come to him and expect him to finish the work amen if we've had our our our minds changed if we've had our lives changed if we've got a a heart that's inclined towards him we ought to have some confidence now that he's a God that's going to finish the work he says if we've had all these things he says let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering why because for he is faithful that promised amen God bless you this evening and as you might imagine we're going to take a second service a final service on this thought of faithful and true and and I want to start us with a conversation on The Impossible on the impossible circumstances I want to talk about things that can happen I want to talk about diseases that can't be healed I want to talk about situations that are so twisted up that none of us can unravel them I want to talk about people that are so far in sin so broken that we think there's nothing can ever restore them I want to talk about doors that could never be opened I want to talk about lives that could never be changed this morning because if we can't believe for those how are we ever going to believe to get out of here in a resurrection or Rapture amen but things that we write off as impossible is just the place that God dwells God dwells in the impossible we'll see as we go through this that is that that God is comfortable in the things that we call impossible because for him all things are easy there's nothing that's difficult for him amen but I I want to start with what I consider the greatest impossibility that we could think of physically because so often that's where our faith is first proven is in this Physical Realm we're in in the in the bodies that we're in in the lives that we're living and the greatest impossibility I know is a paradox and that's when something is going to be done that is against the very definition of what it is and there the greatest Paradox that we see in scripture this is my opinion this is Brother John is in Isaiah 7:14 that says therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel anden the idea of a virgin producing a son is a paradox because it contradicts what a virgin is which is somebody who has never known physical intimacy with another person it says somebody that has never done the act of producing life will produce life and this is the promise for the Messiah coming and it's just one scripture that shows how he's going to be brought to life in this earth and I want you to realize something the greatest promise for Israel and for the children of God starts with The Impossible he started with the impossible he started with a paradox he started with something that could not happen and so often we're looking for the great Miracles of our life church to happen at the end well when I'm a mature believer when I know this when I understand that then God's going to do this let me tell you God is living in the Supernatural God is Supernatural and there's always the element of the supernatural in the word of God in the believer's life from the very start to the very end as we spoke in the last service when whether it's the the the rain coming down whether it's the rotting the growth or whether it's producing fruit every portion of it is Supernatural and so often we look at things and we think it's simple because it doesn't look Supernatural but if we only knew what went on behind the scenes to make those simple things happen we'd realize that God was moving all along amen that's the way he does this and I'm not saying you know we ought to expect the supernatural a and I'm not saying we need to expect it daily but we need to expect it daily so that when it happens we're not surprised and we recognize it for what it is amen if we're if we're children of a supernatural God we ought to expect the supernatural to happen because God loves to show his power to his children God loves to show you that he cares about you and that all of Heaven is behind you to produce what he said you are that's what God's trying to do brother Brandon would say this he says God always in every age dealt with men through signs because he is Supernatural and where a Supernatural God is there is bound to be Supernatural things going on see remember that the the the the the condition of this age is that they they put out God out of the church completely we're going to get into that a little bit later but when they put God out they put the supernatural out so many times do where we got people that don't believe in Divine Healing we don't have people that we have people that don't believe in the Holy Ghost we have people that don't believe in signs and wonders we have people that don't believe that God is still doing what he did 2,000 years years ago but we are in the expectation of the supernatural of God in our life because in this age we expect the greatest Supernatural event that's ever happened and that's for a resurrection and a Rapture to happen in our bodies amen what a wonderful thing amen so don't sell yourself short this evening don't sell yourself self short say well I'm not this and I'm not that I'm not part of the ministry I'm not a listen if you are a child of God the Supernatural is embedded in your life whether you realize it or not so don't sell yourself short and definitely don't sell God short you know we have that story of the the man that went to the king and he asked for $1,000 and the King said no and then another man walked up and said can I have $10 million and the King gave it to him and they said King why did you not give him the ,000 but you gave the other one the $10 million he said because the one that asked the $1,000 didn't ask anything worthy of who I am the one that asked for $10 million asked something that I was worthy of giving I can give you those things and God is looking for people that are in expectation for him to do above and beyond what we could ever ask or think amen it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and what he did back then for people he'll do for us today amen he does not change if we won't change because that's the big question will we believe it will we expect it will we look for it will we testify it or do we just say well that seems impossible and so we leave it alone and we're just going to live a life like everybody else no that's not what he's looking for our confession Our Testimony ought to be Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and if you look in Hebrews that's 138 if you look at Hebrews 13:7 the the testimony of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever was in the lives of the Believers that's where it was found and it says follow after their faith imitate them as you see Christ the same yesterday today forever and them do what they do because it'll produce the same thing in your life now God promised the the children of Israel a messiah and he he said his name will be Emanuel which means god with us and God promised he'd come down and he'd live in flesh he'd be a man living like they were and he says and if you think that's hard to believe I'm going to make it even harder to believe I'm going to be born of a virgin that's the way God does things amen God does that we call the hard way naturally because for him everything is easy there's nothing held back from him there's nothing that can stand before his his power but you know it's one thing to believe that God could come down and live in flesh and be born in flesh but the thing is can believe that it will happen in us because there's many that that that could believe he was going to be born of a virgin but how many virgins were there saying I believe it could be born in me that's really what we're looking for amen it's an entirely different thing to believe that God can do it in me rather than God can do it and we all have probably heard of this this story of of the the trapeze artist that that that had a crowd in front of them and he says do you believe that I can walk across this tight RPP across these Falls blindfolded or that I can walk across it they said sure we do he says do you believe I can do it blindfolded sure we do he says do you believe I can do it blindfolded and pushing a wheelbarrow and not fall yes sir we believe you can do it he said Do you believe I can do all of those things that with somebody in the wheelbarrow they said we sure do he says who's willing to get in the wheelbarrow and guess what nobody was willing to get in the wheelbarrow it showed who really believed believed him and who believed him for somebody else when somebody else's life is in the wheelbarrow we've got all sorts of Faith don't we but God's coming for a bride that says I'll step into the wheelbarrow and me I'll take him at his word as impossible as it seems as foolish as it seems I'll get into the ark that he provides and I'll trust him to do the impossible when my life's on the line when my money's on the line when my family's on the line when my Health's on the line when my career is on the line when my relationships are in the line I'll step into the wheelbarrow and I'll trust him to take me across this great Chasm that's before me those are the ones that really believe in him the ones that'll get in there themselves now I'm trying to set a pattern tonight church for us because we have to be able to believe for the impossible we have to be able to do it because the impossible is what is our promise and so we've got to be able to believe it but I want us to see that faith without works is dead that's what this picture shows faith without works is dead belief without faith to actually step into it is not real faith I like what brother Jerry said he said Faith leads to trust and Trust means you'll put yourself on the line with the word because you believe it you truly believe it and that's what God's looking for somebody that says I'll believe your word but I want you to understand that if God has sent out his word then he's got a people that's prepared to receive his word that's a beautiful promise to us and if we look at the Fulfillment of Isaiah 7:14 there we come to the Book of Luke and it says in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espoused the Virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women what a greeting what what a greeting can you imagine Church Mary is sitting perhaps in the house and all of a sudden Gabriel is standing and he says God has favored you you are a blessed woman that would do something for us it says and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be listen church God sends angels to those that are favored of God Amen God as we move forward tonight angels are sent to a certain type of people but she's sitting there and she's saying what does this all mean I found favor I'm just a little girl she wasn't that old they say she could have been as young as 14 or 15 just a young lady just like our young sisters here and an angel comes and appears to her and says you are highly favored you are blessed God is with you wow I didn't know that says and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou Hast found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end in other words the angel is saying to Mary you're going to fulfill the word of God in your flesh what was written in Isaiah 7:14 you are the Fulfillment that's what he's saying there have been many virgins in Israel through the 700 years that were between Isaiah and this time many believing virgins but there was one chosen virgin out of all of them amen he says you're in the season of the Messiah and you've got a part of it and your flesh is going to play a part in this your body is going to produce the Messiah you're the chosen vessel to fulfill Isaiah 7:14 says then said Mary unto the angel how shall I how shall this be seeing I know not a man you notice Church she never says I'm not worthy I'm not qualified I don't want to do it go find somebody else all she says is how she says you I'm a virgin you know I'm a virgin and I know there's only one way that you can have a child and that's to know a man and I haven't had any intimacy with a man man yet how is this going to be notice what what gave her this attitude church if God sends an angel to you that ought to be good enough for us to look past all of our faults and failures that are inevitably there amen if God sends you a message if God sends you an angel if God sends you his word then the very coming of the word to you tells you that you are eligible and you are worthy to receive it Hallelujah that's where we stand this morning this evening is because he sent us his word we're worthy to receive his word the sending of the word tells you you're worthy to receive it God sends his Angel to people that will accept it and will listen to it and accept it and act on it that's who he comes to amen and her only question is how is this going to be it says and the angel said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall shall be called The Son of God in other words his answer is Mary you're just going to have to accept it and believe it this is going to be a working of the Holy Ghost you're not going to have a part to play all you will know is that it happens you won't know when it happens but you'll know it happens because there will come the evidence later that of what happened in your body it'll be a working of the Holy Ghost Church everything that we receive to produce the word of God is a working of the Holy holy ghost in our life and we may not be able to explain it how do you explain how you go from one minute a a a creature that is lost in sin and trespasses and dead in those things to be newly risen in Christ and you're a completely new creation with a new mind and a new heart and a new spirit how do you explain that you know when you've been changed because you know the way you used to think you know the way you used to feel you know the way you used to desire things and now when you received the Holy ghost when it does the work in your life you know something's changed but you can't say how that's the impossible happening and he says Mary The Impossible is going to happen and the only thing that does the impossible in you is the Holy Ghost it takes the Holy Ghost to do these things now listen what he says and behold thy cousin Elizabeth she also hath conceived a son in her old age and this is the six Monon with her who is called baren see the Holy Ghost comes and he says other people are having Miracles too he building up her courage he's building up her faith he's saying somebody else is receiving the impossible as well it's not your impossible but it but it was impossible for her she's old she's Barren she couldn't have kids and she's 6 months into her pregnancy already he's testifying of those things it says for without for with God nothing shall be impossible church that's where we're standing today for God With God nothing will be impossible it's not ours to to say how is it going to happen it's ours to say what she says next and Mary said behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her what an answer Church you're going to produce a child by the Holy Ghost you won't feel a thing all you will know is you'll be pregnant and you won't know what happen and he's going to become Messiah he'll be Emanuel God With Us his name will be Jesus and he will save you from your sin sins Hallelujah how's it going to happen I don't know but it's going to happen it's going to happen and all she says here is Lord I'll take you at your word what you said let it happen in me here I am that's all she said that's all she said church that's all we have to say listen to what the prophet God says he says now the angel Gabriel 6 months later have visited Mary and told her that her cousin was going to have a baby also so Mary knew that that would be a miracle of that woman well stricken in age having a baby but she said to the angel how shall it be with me seeing that I know not a man see see Zacharias and Elizabeth they'd had relations but Mary says this is that's great but that's not the same as me but he says and ask and you shall receive he said the Holy Ghost is going to overshadow you that Holy thing which shall be born of you shall be called The Son of God that's how it's going to happen like I said that's how anything good by the word happens in our life it's by the Holy Ghost and we may not be able to explain it it says Mary never talked back to the angel she never disgusted in any way the only thing she said was behold the handmade of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word he says did you think how that even the priest Zacharias had questioned him being an old man and her old to how this would be done and a priest who should know the word and know what God did but this little virgin was just a child remember Zacharias didn't believe it and so he was struck dumb so he couldn't speak until John was born his unbelief put him mute God said I'm not going to allow you to challenge this I'm going to strike you I'm going to close your mouth because you don't believe and when it happens then you'll be allowed to talk and when his mouth was opened it was because John was born and then the naming was John and as soon as he wrote that out then that's when his mouth came open but it said this little virgin was just a child she had no husband she had to believe the impossible something that had never happened before but she never argued she never questioned anymore it says his word was enough for her church that's where we need to get this evening his word is enough for me he says oh if the church could just get like that the word settles it if God said so that's all we need to know how's it going to be I can't tell you but if God said so it's going to be that way because God said so oh that's the way I want the church to know if there's anything I want you to sink faith in is in what God has said it has to be true he says did you notice she had to believe the impossible she could not go back like Zacharias could he could have gone back to Sarah and Sarah was almost 100 when she had the baby and Hannah at the temple she was an old woman too and they had plenty of examples of that where they had husbands but Mary had to believe some something that never had happened before what a position for this young woman to be in never happened before says you've got thousands of examples of Divine Healing look at people's been healed with cancer blindness dumbness deafness all kinds of sicknesses and diseases we've got plenty of that to look to as examples but this little girl didn't have nothing but just his word and that was sufficient his word was good enough for her Hallelujah he says I want want you to notice she didn't wait till she was positive it was going to happen she started testifying about it right away she didn't wait till she felt life so she could be positive she was going to have the baby just as soon as she heard his word she took him at his word she started testifying and praising God for the baby before she ever felt anything this is the Overcomer response this is the believer's response here he says give us more Marys around here that can take God at his word and praise him whether you feel anything or not take him at his word God's trying to find somebody who will take his word he says I don't care how you feel someone says well I don't feel any better I went to the meetings I was prayed for that don't have nothing to do with it God said so and that settles it amen somebody who will take his word that's what pleases him believe his word that's what pleases God that's the only way you will ever find favor with him is believe his word amen God help us this evening to believe him he said Mary had to believe for the impossible but God takes The Impossibles and makes them real when he's taken at his word church what impossible situation are you facing this evening we look around we've got people we're praying for we've got people facing debilitating sicknesses we've got people facing conditions in their body they've had for their life maybe for decades we've got people that are out in the world that ought to be in the church and it seems like things are getting more and more twisted up let me tell you there's always a god of the impossible amen there's always a god of the impossible the doctors might have said you'll never get rid of that cancer the doctors might have said you'll never be able to walk again it's impossible for you to do it he says but Impossibles Fade Out when God's taken at his word we sing that song Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus look full in his wonderful face and the things of this world will grow strangely dim in the light of his glory and grace it's what you're looking at that will determine what you see and as you look more and more on him as you look more and more on his word as you dwell in his presence and the things of God you'll find that these things start to fade away and Faith builds up and the impossible starts to happen and it doesn't always happen like this it may fade in slowly bit by bit I told the story many times of my mom when she came to the message and she she she loved her makeup but she had read in the scriptures that the woman that wore makeup was Jezebel and she said Lord I see in your word that I ought not to be wearing this she said but I want to wear it she was honest before God but she said I want to please you more than I want that makeup but you know that I can't give it up unless you change my heart and so she said I'm saying I'm willing to give it up but I'm asking you to take the desire away guess what she did not wake up the next morning with no desire for makeup but 6 months later she realized she was no longer wearing it anymore Hallelujah and she couldn't tell you the day it was taken away all she knew was that it was gone where once it had been I talked to my dad about that my dad doesn't serve the Lord he said John that's exactly the way it happened it just started fading out of her life until it was all gone and she never picked it up again The Impossible happened for her Lord I want it I like it I desire it but I want you more than that so take it away and God took away the very thing that she had loved for all of her life Impossibles Fade Out when God's taken at his word no matter what the doctor says he's doing the best he can he says but God is God Amen and his word is just like he is and you take his word that settles it forever if thou can't believe say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but will believe that what you've said will come to pass you can have what you said remember what he said Mary had no history of this no previous cases she couldn't turn back into the into the the Old Testament and say oh there's one that happened therefore I know it can happen again no God asked her to believe the impossible something she'd never seen never read about she had no testimonies nobody in her church to to to to bolster her faith but just the presence of the messenger of God with the word for her was enough to raise her faith to say be it unto me let it happen as you said it she knew she was nothing special that's why she wondered what's this all about that's the kind of people God comes to people that think they're nothing why me cuz you're chosen not cuz you're good not cuz you're great because you're chosen and it's his choosing not ours as we'll see as we go later but watch now I want you to show the to see the followup of this so she says be it unto me she receives the word she says I believe it and she goes to visit Elizabeth remember she goes straight to Elizabeth and it came to pass that when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary the Babe leaped in her womb and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost and she spake out with a loud voice and said blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb and whence is this to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me she says Mary you're special why are you coming to me God why is this why are you blessing me with this sing it says for L as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears the Babe leaped in my womb for Joy the first mention of the name Jesus brought life to a dead baby that b it wasn't dead it had never moved she was growing but the baby had never kicked in her and they were worried that it was going to be still born and as soon as that name Jesus Is Spoken life came to that baby and the Holy Ghost now comes over and anoints Elizabeth and she listen to what she says she says and blessed is she that did what believed if thou C believe all things are possible the only requirement for us is to believe it and act on it and blessed is she that believed for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord this is Elizabeth now speaking under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost and what does the Holy Ghost do Church it confirms the word you want to know if you've got the Holy Ghost does it confirm the word in your life does it say Amen does it make it a reality in your life that's how you know you got the Holy Ghost not because you speak in tongues not because of signs and wonders but because the life of that spirit is in you producing the word in you amen says Mary does this Mary said my soul do magnify the Lord church that ought to be our response when the word comes to you and you know it's to you we ought to start praising the Lord we ought to be able to worship though we can't feel it though we can't see it though it may not have happened yet in this Physical Realm when we receive the word it's as if it has already happened and we can praise the Lord for it right then and there remember brother Ram said he says if I've got the money for a piece of bread I can thank God for the bread even though it's not in my pocket yet why cuz I've got what it takes to get the bread she says my soul do magnify the Lord and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my savior for he ha regarded the lowest state of his handmaiden for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed and here's her confession for he that has Mighty ha done to me great things what a line what a scripture Church the Mighty God has done something wonderful in my life we ought to be able to testify of the Mighty God what he's done in our life amen that's what God does to people that believe him he does mighty things amen he changes them he turns lowly people into great names he says for he that is mighty had done great done to me great things and holy is his name notice how it says in verse 45 there shall be a performance of those things which were told you of the lord we saw God gave a word promise and we know his word can't return to him void it has to produce what it said it has to bring it to reality and now we come 700 years later of that bread being upon the Water the word's been given 700 years ago and God says now is the season of The Impossible after 700 years we'd say the word's dead it's not going to happen it's gone too far look at the conditions we're in the Romans have taken over us we're under we're under slavery we can't worship the way we want to the conditions are darker than they've ever been and God comes on the scene and says now is the now is the time the worst time possible God says this is it time for the impossible to happen and wonder of Wonders Church there's actually a virgin and she's actually a Believer this is not luck this is not happen stance this is not just an opportunity this is God not this is not God waiting for somebody this this is God preparing somebody at an ordained time at an ordained season that she would be a virgin that she would be a real believer that she'd be able to receive the message God spoke his word he wrote it down as a record and then God knew and for ordained somebody to receive it and fulfill it that's the way the word works because it's fulfilled in people it's not fulfilled in situations it's fulfilled in people the word is for people amen to is to be made flesh amen and so God's word went out and it prepared a person to receive the word that's what it did he prepared somebody to fulfill his word it wasn't just lucky it didn't take 700 years for a virgin there were plenty of virgins but God in the right time and in the right season said here it is it's time to go Abraham says this he says how but did you know God's more obligated to keep his promise than you are when God makes a promise he's got to keep it in order to be God every promise he makes is true and he's obligated to that promise if you'll keep that in mind while you're Crossing through this prayer line tonight something will happen to you to know that God cannot make a promise and not stick to it he's got to now catch this he says and he knows all things so he's infinite we're finite and can make a promise and have to take it back but he can't because he's perfect he knows everything the end from the beginning so he has to keep his promise and how does he do it church and he's always got somebody who will believe that he gives it and then he prepares a vessel to receive it he says God let me be one of those no matter how much you have to be criticized and laughed at let me believe God's promise and stay with that catch that thought he says he's infinite he knows the end from the beginning he gives a promise so that he can fulfill it and that means there has to be somebody to believe the promise and receive the promise to produce the promise church that ought to make us happy this evening that there are promises unfulfilled and we're in the season of those promises therefore there's got to be at least one person that's here that's going to receive it amen somebody that's going to fulfill the word amen we weren't born into Christian families we weren't born into families that believe this end time message uh by chance we don't hear the word of God by chance we didn't come out from under our mushroom brother Mark by chance but there is something that went out and prepared Us by predestination by for ordination that prepared a people that would take that word and receive it and make it live in their lives that's the way that God works amen there's always somebody ordained to believe it and to receive it and we read this scripture last service but I want to touch it again because it confirms this idea in Romans 8 it says we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are not just called the called according to his purpose Church there's plenty of people that are called scripture says many are called few are chosen The Chosen are the called there's a gospel call that goes out and people's consciences are pricked they want to live a better life they want to do better things as a as a father as a mother as a husband as a wife they want to be a better citizen whatever that might be and that that is that is a calling but that is not necessarily the calling amen they can they can feel the pull of the Gospel but they can't surrender to the gospel and they can't live it they love the idea of it but they can't receive the life of it remember what Jesus said he says my words are spirit and they are life amen but there's a group that is known as the called and that's the elected that's the predestinated and they have a purpose in their calling and it's God's purpose and what is God's purpose fulfill his word that's our purpose is to fulfill the word of God and then he says for whom he did for no past tense he also did predestinate past tense to be conformed future tense he knew you he predestinated you and you're going to be changed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren remember John 1:1 says in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh amen that's Christ in a nutshell and he's the first of all of us and what was he he was the word made flesh what are we the word made flesh he's the firstborn amongst men many brethren we are supposed to be just like him in the same image I'm not him completely you're not him completely but we're in the image of him we're we're we're little micro christs if we want to put it that way little anointed ones little words made flesh if we want to call it that it says morever whom he did predestinate past them he also called past and whom he called them he also Justified past and whom he justified then he also glorified past tense what shall we then say to these things of God before us then who can be against us in other words he's saying you're not here because of you you're here because of him you're not here because you accepted you're here because he called he said this is what you going to be and so now because he said it he's got to produce it and that's why we're here today he said he was going to do it Church we're not here because we're born into the right family look in the scriptures a a and you see how many horrible ungodly people come out of Godly homes the Kings had horrible children prophet had horrible Sons priests had horrible Sons some of the greatest Believers in the scriptures had some of the most horrible children look at Jacob and Esau Esau despised the word of God came out of the same the same flesh that produced Jacob who was a prince having power with God once he got changed before that he was a Shyer amen but but that's not the guarantee here is that we're we're here because we're raised in it lots of people are raised in it lots of people are brought up into it and guess what lots of them go out but there's an elect there's a called group that's here because he said there was going to be somebody here he says this Our God lives and Reigns he's a god of power he's the same yesterday today and forever he's the god that closed the heavens in the Days of Elijah he's the god that stilled the waters on the Mighty Sea that night he's the one that woke up his son from the dead after being in the grave for three days he's omnipotent he lives and reigns forever church that's our God that's my God that's your God tonight he says and he's the same yesterday today and forever he will always be God He will always have somebody who will believe him in that way too in that way too that he can raise the dead that he can heal the sick that he can change the lives that he can change the body that he can control the elements of this Earth that he can have an impact in the in the lives that we live that he's not just sitting up in a throne somewhere and that everything is just kind of bumbling along here no he can intervene and he has intervened in our lives to bring us to where we are today and he's doing that to continue to take us to where we ought to be tomorrow and the day after and the day after and the day after he says he will always have somebody who will believe him in that way too God has never been without a testimony I say Amen to that cuz I believe I'm one of those and I believe I'm talking to other people that are just like that cuz I know your testimonies I know what God's done I've seen the the healings I've seen the Deliverance I've seen the lives changed I've seen the character being molded I've seen people that used to be one way and now they're are completely different way and this way is like Christ and that was like their parents that was like their family bloodline but now they've been changed into new creatures and we may not be perfect but we're moving in the direction of Christ amen and that's why I believe it amen but let's not stop there let's not stop because we have a testimony let's go on until we have a body change amen let's go until we have a resurrection let's go until we can see sister coffee sitting around our table or sister Dumford sitting around our table and we've got some fellowship for 30 or 40 days before we go away I look forward to the day that we'll see those people amen I look forward to that that we we that we can be a people that say that I know that God is good I've tasted and seen it I know he's a Healer I know he's a deliverer I know that he speaks back to us I know that he's alive and well I know that he's a provider I've known him in the power of his resurrection that's when he changed us into a new cre creature but there's a literal fulfillment of that when he rises us up and gives us a glorified body like his amen now I want to take us to the present day for the last third of this service and I want to go to the Book of Revelation and we know that the Book of Revelation is the revelation of Jesus Christ and it's a full picture it's a summary picture of who he is what he is what he's doing what he will do and we read his description in Revelation 1 and I want you to catch this as we read this it says John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before thrown notice John's salutation he says in all that you read here he says let peace and Grace be what comes with it the Book of Revelation remember I it I believe the the original word is Apocalypto when it talks about the tribulation this is a book that has great judgment in it great destruction lots of blood lots of Mayhem lots of War but in it all John says hey if you'll receive what's here it'll be grace and it'll be peace to you no matter what the situation is he says and from Jesus Christ who is who the faithful witness we're speaking on faithful and true the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and has made us past tense Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen so we see the seven spirits of God which are the Seven Stars in his hand which are the seven Messengers to the seven Gentile Church ages and then we dive into Revelation 2 and it starts with the church ages with the first one which was the Ephesian Church Age and and Ephesian Church age was Peak Christianity what we call they were at the Apex they were the highest order uh of the Christians of the Believers why because they were LED and controlled completely by the Holy Spirit that's what made them great was that they were not under the the orders of men but what happened was God sent them a messenger an angel messenger which was Paul the prophet Paul the Apostle and Paul laid out the word and it set the church in order and everyone became subject to that word and what did it produce It produced Christ all over again that's what they saw remember what the scripture says and they looked at at at uh uh Paul and John and saw that they were ignorant and unted but they knew that they had been with Jesus amen sometimes we seem ignorant to the world but people know we've been with Jesus I trust amen but even Peter we see the man with the keys to the kingdom had to come into alignment with what Paul said why because Paul was the Ephesian Church age messenger he was the first star he was the first Angel messenger and and we know that what happened after that they those men died and things got Progressive worse with each age after that but notice how every Church age starts with a verse that says unto the angel of the Church of whatever right and then what is that church that angel It's a messenger it's not a literal angel from heaven it's an Earthly Angel it's a messenger and it's one man and that man is inspired by the holy spirit because it's God writing to the Church of each age and that man is inspired by the Holy Spirit he catches the inspiration for the age and he brings a message to that people and it's what they need to overcome in that age amen they're not adding to scripture they're not taking it away from scripture but they're focusing them on the scripture that's needful for them specifically to overcome in their age amen we don't need Noah's message today but it's in the Scriptures it it's it's for our admonition we can learn from it but Noah's message will not get us into resurrection and Rapture but every Church age has a messenger that comes to them and then at the end of every Church age it says he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and then it gives the reward for overcoming what is overcoming mean Church it means to hear and act on what the holy spirit is saying to the church it's the only way to overcome and how is the holy spirit speaking by way of the Angel messenger it's the messenger to the age it's God's chosen man it has nothing to do what we think of him his faults his flaws his failures his personality his education or lack thereof God chooses a man and he uses him to bring a message to that church age and the first one was Paul amen now that doesn't mean there isn't a five-fold Ministry Ephesians 4 tells us there is one amen of the the the pastors and the teachers and the evangelists and the apostles and the prophets and these things but there is one man in every age that brings a message to that age and to those people to overcome and it's not a new message amen it doesn't add new doctrine but rather it always points them back to the scripture because if we'll get back to the word we'll get restored back to God that's what happened in Israel's days remember every man did what was right in his own eyes and what did they do they veered off and they went into judgment and then God sends a man back and he brings them back shows them the word they repent come back and then God's with them again it's the same thing happening in the seven Church ages amen and that person brings that man brings a message that points them to their condition points them to where they've gotten off the road how to get back on the road and then what the reward is for getting back on the road remember what Paul said this the first church age messenger he says but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be a curse Paul couldn't preach any other gospel than what the the the Holy Ghost had given him in the desert in Arabia Paul couldn't take it back Paul couldn't change it he couldn't add to it couldn't take away from it he couldn't he couldn't adjust it for societal Norms he couldn't bow to political or religious pressure what was given was what was given and there was no change in it why because it was of the Holy Ghost it was God's word to the church and it's truth and it stands alone it's unchanging it's the gold standard of the gospel for the for the Gentile church is the New Testament and so nothing can change so if you have a messenger that comes and he goes a different direction than Paul Paul says let him be accursed and Paul says even if I do it listen when we go when if if we ever go through the church ages we'll see that so many of those Messengers they still had issues you look at Luther Luther brought the the fifth Church age message but even he went off into fanaticism but he brought the message that started them on the justification Road and that's all he had to do but he needed to go further and he didn't and he fell by the wayside he got wrapped up in politics and these different things fanaticism and so you had to have men come behind them to preach sanctification and then come behind that to preach the Holy Ghost and these different things because people either stopped or they fell by the wayside but nonetheless God used them it was God's choosing but I want you to realize one major thing is that in all of these Church ages there's a great falling away every time and they're going further and further into darkness but no matter how dark it was there was always an overcomer no matter what the conditions were no matter how bad it looked why because God doesn't give a promise and not fulfill it and if he says there's a reward for the Overcomer that means there's got to be an overcomer because there's got to be somebody to receive it and fulfill it and how did they overcome they listen to their angel messenger that's it there's a fivefold Ministry today but I've got to say the same things that our Angel messenger said and what did he say he said what Paul said that's how I believe him is because he said what Paul said but but he focused on the things that are needful for us to restore us back to where we need to be and when we look at the Dark Ages or we look at the church ages here the seven Church ages remember the angel Drew these out on the wall and when he drew them out i' I've put it here as he drew it and that's that it look how it goes in the first church age you have all this light that's the word the revealing of the word and it gets darker darker darker and then there's a turnaround at the fifth and into the sixth it's getting light and we think God's doing doing something and then it comes into the seventh and it is total darkness things are getting worse and worse and worse you look at the Dark Ages I don't know how people got saved in the Dark Ages they couldn't even read the word it was it was in Latin they couldn't couldn't understand it how do you get saved if you can't even read the word but God had people in there that were saved through those things and we see that the Catholic Church killed over 60 million people for disagreeing they gave their lives for the gospel 60 more than 60 63 68 million 68 million people killed for the Gospel of Jesus Christ God had people that would stand and they overcame by what taking him at his word and refusing to back away but we look in there and we see that no matter how bad it got look at that first church age as it transitioned and and they went from everything was going great and signs and wonders and now pretty soon they've got to give their lives and the scripture says women had their children saw torn apart and saw aunder and and people were being just destroyed and torn apart and and all these horrible things and it looked so dark and yet God had people there that would receive their message and receive the anointing that came with it and they go through anything and receive an overcomer reward we ought to be able to look at all six of those and see how difficult it was and say but there was still an overcomer so that when we come to this seventh one we say as black as it is there's got to be an overcomer amen no matter how long things drag on no matter how bad things got God was always there and then we come to the very end the end of all things and this ought to be the Golden Age of the believer the seventh Church age ought to be Peak Christianity it ought to be God just showing signs and wonders in his church it ought to be the greatest thing we've had seven ages to come with it and then what does the angel draw total darkness and the prophet of God would only add in a sliver of light he said to represent the bride that gets pulled out of that age and goes into resurrection and a Rapture in the darkest time possible when the world is in a Sodom and gomorra condition when the world is in total total perversion God says I'll do the impossible I'll pick the worst time to do the greatest time with a humble people that'll take me at my word amen before we read that last Church age I want to I want to jump to to Revelation 10 because Revelation 10 shows us the events of the seventh Church age it's the action that's happening in the latan church age we look in Revelation 10:1 it says and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire now if you look at the description in Revelation 1 we see this is none other than Christ himself Christ himself personal presence it says and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven Thunders uttered and write them not it says and the angel which I saw stood upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever now remember when he made the Covenant with Abraham he swore by himself by himself because he could swear by no greater now he comes down and he's what is he doing he's fulfilling the Covenant it's the same Oath by the same person he swore by himself it says who created heaven and the things that there in are and the earth and the things that therein are and the Sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer in other words God things have gone on long enough and God's wrapping up his plan he's wrapping up his word purpose God's going into action we'll see the seventh seal is an action seal it's not about talking now it's about doing it says now in verse seven so God's comes down Christ comes down and he he's here and he's got a little book open and it's the book of redemption but watch what's happening now this is the action of the of the leyan church age it says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel what's the seventh angel It's the seventh star it's the seventh spirit it's the seventh Church age messenger so in the v in the days of The Voice or the ministry of the seventh Church age messenger when he shall begin to sound when he shall begin to speak well he he shall begin to deliver his message it says the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets so everything he's been talking about the Redemption plan is the mystery of God how does does he do it who's he going to do it in but what is the mystery of God remember brother Brandon would preach Christ is the mystery of God revealed the Myster of God is Christ being revealed so in the seventh Church age there's a finishing of the revealing of Jesus Christ amen where is it I'm looking at it I'm looking at it it's the mystery revealing of Christ it's the anointing of Christ the head is coming down to the body they're being joined into one and so the finishing revealing of Christ is Christ in his bride he did it in the first church age he was Alpha and then he said I am Alpha and Omega he did not say I am Alpha through Omega he said I'm the beginning and I'm the end I'm revealed in the Beginning church and I'm revealed in the end church and it's Christ revealing himself and his bride amen and what is it it's the word being made flesh what's he saying in verse 7 here he's saying that the mystery is going to be finished the revealing of Christ is going to be completed what he started 2,000 years ago on the day of Pentecost he's finishing in the last Church age what's he finishing Church he's finishing you he's finishing me that's the work that's going on now it's finishing changing us as his bride from creatures of time into creatures of Eternity what's he doing he's molding us he's shaping us he's trimming us to match the word he's taking out what doesn't match and he's putting in what will match and he's putting us through Tri trials and tribulations and proving Us by the word through these things that we are Christ again in flesh just little bits here and there little lights Little Words little Messiahs little anointed ones little christs that's all Christ means is Anointed one he is the Christ the anointed one we are Christ we are anointed ones what's the work that needs to be done because we listen to that we say whoa wonderful praise the Lord this is great I'm the word made flesh I'm Christ being revealed to this age how does he do it church this is The Humbling part Revelation 3 it says and unto the angel of the Church of the leans right this is our message this is the voice this is what the holy spirit is saying these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation in God now we read in Revelation 1 earlier it said Jesus Christ who's the Fai ful witness and the first begotten of the dead and now he's coming back he never identifies himself as that until the last age why because this is where there's going to be another begotten of the dead now we've had it spiritually because we've been raised as new creatures New Creations in Christ but there's a literal now raising of the dead that's going to happen and it only happens in this last Church age didn't happen in the first and it didn't happen through any of the others that's for sure but he comes at the end and he says I'm the faithful witness I'm the first begotten of the dead and because of that now is the time for the rest of the Dead to rise now is the rest of the Brethren to be revealed because I was the first one amen he's the first but there's many others coming behind he's the first begotten among many Brethren and his his identity here is amen what is amen so be it it's the finishing of the work it's time for it all to get wrapped up it's time for all to happen here what he's doing is he's saying I'm it's the I'm the amen it's going to happen I'm the faithful and true witness what I promised is about to occur I'm going to do what I said I'm going to do it doesn't look like I'm doing it maybe it doesn't look like it's a good time it doesn't look like anybody believes but regardless I'm going to do it I'm going to do it in the darkest of The Darkest Hours Church in the most horrible conditions possible when people are religious but they're not real Believers they're warped they're Twisted the Earth is going into destruction that's when God says I'm faithful and true I'm the amen it's going to happen in the worst possible time God says here I come ready or not little bride are you ready and he sends a messenger to get her ready to receive her promise but I want you to look at the condition of the people here in verse 15 because this is the message to every person of this age including me including you whether you'll realize it or not see we think I raised in the message I don't this doesn't apply to me this applies to every single one of us church amen it says I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou W cold or hot he says you're not cold or hot I want you to be cold or hot he says so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I'll spew thee out of my mouth he says I know th sorry he says because why but catch this out in 16 he says because you're lukewarm you're not cold or heart God hates it when people are half in and half out there's no such thing as a half Christian you're either in or you're out there's no one on the fence God hates compromise and God hates lip service without a life that will act on what you say he spits it out their sacrifice such as it is isn't even accepted by him but catch the condition now and remember the condition for every age is a spiritual Condition it's not a natural condition they may have it naturally but what God's looking at is their spiritual condition because that's what he's coming to change he says because thou sayest Church what I think of myself has zero influence on who I really am if I think I'm great that don't make me great if God says I'm great I'm great but if I think I say I'm great and God says I'm not guess what I'm not no matter how much I might tell myself I'm great he says because thou sayest because you say I am rich increase with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou are wretched miserable poor blind and naked what a contrast think you're rich increase with Goods you have you don't need anything and he says you're wretched miserable poor blind oh and you're naked this is their spiritual condition it's a religious attitude it's a religious attitude that claims to be a Christian because of what they have rather than what they are now church that ought to be a warning to this message because we can sit here and say I have a message I have a messenger but that's what you have have you become it there's there was thousands on thousands heard Jesus message when he was here but how many received it how many became it 120 on the day of Pentecost out of the thousands that ate the bread and the and the fishes and got healed only 120 stayed through out of all of those to receive the holy ghost that first day yes they brought others in but there was only 120 that stayed through all the way through of this and actually received the word and were changed by it amen Christ is life he's not just Doctrine amen he's overcoming power not convincing words remember what Paul said I I he said I I I I I wasn't going to come to you with enticing words of men but in the power of his resurrection amen his words are spirit and life and if all we've got is a good theological argument if all we've got is perfect Doctrine Church guess what we're right here that's where we sit can I live it that's that's what I care about I say God give me a revelation that I can live rather than just talk about help me not to live so far above my Revelation so far below it that I look like a hypocrite remember what Paul said Paul said you can have all the gifts you can prophesy you can have all Faith he says without charity you're nothing and that word charity is agape which is it is God's love it is the Holy Ghost without the Holy Ghost we are nothing God says without it you're hopeless you're poor spiritually you have nothing to Value but this is God's way he never leaves us without a remedy he says I counsel thee here's my advice he says here's my way of doing it buy of me gold tried in the fire that's Godly character and notice it's always through the fire it has to be tested it has to be tried Paul says that the trial of our faith is is what more precious than gold because it proves we've got the real deal that's why we come through it and we say I'm glad I went through it didn't enjoy it perhaps but I'm glad I went through it because I see now he's working in my life and I've got something that it doesn't that doesn't go away with circumstances he says buy me gold tried in the fire get Godly character that thou mayest be rich The Riches of Christ Our character he says I'm white rment which is what the righteousness of Christ that that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear see remember what they said he said thou sayest if I wrap myself in what I think of myself it doesn't hide anything it's hypocritical it's see-through the emperor has no clothes but if I can wrap myself in what he is one it'll keep me humble two it'll keep me dependent on him that's what he's looking for that the shame of thy nakedness we've all got things we don't want seen under these clothes amen it's why we need clothes to hide the little things so he can work on them under the shelter of his blood under the shelter of his righteousness and it's Pride that would make us take those things off amen but if we wrap ourselves in him he'll do a work amen he says and then anoint thine eyes with isav that thou mayest see isav is always Revelation and here's the thing that only comes from him that takes the Holy Ghost to do that amen remember what Jesus said Blessed Be Your Eyes for they see the things of God and they didn't even understand it but when they got the Holy Ghost all of a sudden things started clicking they started to place things in the scripture and they started to see where they were they started to who were started to see who they were but there's a people that don't want to see any more than what they have they're happy with what they're ha what they have they're happy with their denomination they're happy with their Creed they're happy with their Community they're happy their soul is satisfied with it and they don't want to move any further but it takes the Holy Ghost to put a hunger and a thirst to open our eyes to see that there's more than what we have right now no matter how much we have catch this now he says as many as I love I rebuke and chasen so the message for this age doesn't coddle us we read so much that is encouraging from The Prophet's message don't we but I'll tell you what he doesn't hold he doesn't pull his punches he calls it the way it is and he lays it in our lap and now we've got a decision to make will we receive it or will we not and he says what as many as I rebuke I love I rebuke and chasen that's his that that that's his action but watch the response now of the Overcomer be zealous therefore and repent the Overcomer response for this age is to say I'm not what I thought I was I'm not yet what I ought to be no matter how great our UPC up coming our upbringing how great our ministry how great our church how great our family amen it's to realize that occasionally we get into a place of spiritual arrogance and pride and we need to say you know what I didn't know what I was talking about I don't have what I thought I had and usually that takes some trials to knock us off of our high pedestals and our high horses and we see that we knew nothing as we ought to or we should have known or we thought we did for sure but watch this now in verse 20 he says behold I stand at the door and knock Christ is outside of the nominal church because they've got so much stuff religious and natural they don't need him anymore so he's out completely and he says if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will Su with him and he with me it's an individual Affair but I've talked about this before so I won't belabor the point but no he says If any man hear my voice there's only one voice in this age and that's the messenger's voice that's the Holy Spirit speaking says he that ha an ear let him hear what the spirit's saying what's he saying he's speaking through a messenger and he's telling us what our condition is and he's telling us what our remedy is and now we get a choice do we take it or do we leave it he says if any man hear my voice and open the door I'll come into him and will Su with him and he with me it's an individual Affair now here's the reward to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches now we talked about he's got a a spotless bride he's got a glorious bride and and we are Christ revealed in this age but look at that condition that we just read about that's what we have to come out of we've got to come out of that condition and come into a Christ condition into a work condition amen and out of this these are these are horrible people we're horrible people before we receive Christ we're horrible and the most horrible of us are the religious ones that's the sad truth it's the religious ones that think we have something and yet we don't and yet God comes down he says I'm faithful and true and I'm going to bring you out of this into a Rapture Ready condition Hallelujah that's where we're sitting this evening amen he says I'm coming down and I'm going to put an end to it all you won't stop me your flaws your failures I'll put you through the fire I'll wrap you in my righteousness I'll cover you in my blood I'll wash you with my word I'll let you see who you are as you see me revealed in you and it'll raise your faith until the very end and you'll go into Rapture amen he says I'm going to come down I'm going to dwell in my bride I'm going to give her my life and she will be me in this age One Last Time Alpha becomes Omega he's faithful church this is the age where he says I am faithful and I am true he says it nowhere else except right here this is the time where he's revealed as faithful and true the book is open and he's here to claim his bride and his bride's got to be made ready before he can claim her Jesus only asked one question of this age do you remember what it was he says Jesus never asked will I find righteousness will I find people people that's living good Jesus said will I find faith when I return somebody oh they say I got faith he says well faith without works is dead what does faith mean he says will I find someone who will stand at my word and say every words right I'm not scared whether this one says so or that one says so or nothing I believe in God and I'm accepting it and standing right there on it he says that's the thing God is preparing a church today to be saved just as he did in the days of Noah and that Ark he says and the body of Christ today is that Ark do you realize what he's saying there we have a lot of people today saying I'm saved he's saying there's only one salvation today and that's to be in the body of Christ and how do you get in the body of Christ Church it is not saying I accept Jesus as my savior it is not baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Paul said by one Spirit we are baptized into that body you can do the first two and never go in this age there is only one Arc and it is by the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our individual lives and that joins us to the body of Christ everyone else has to go through tribulation they have to give their lives for it and then they have to come up and go through a judgment there's only one Ark today and it's by the Holy Ghost and that's to be baptized into the body of Christ otherwise we Face judgment judgement what's he finishing his Redemption work and his Redemption work is you and me it's a body that he's prepared it's a glorious church it's a glorious bride without spot or wrinkle and who's he coming for people that will take him at his word that's who he's coming for people who will take him at his word not perfect in themselves but people that will stand on the word no matter what happens and it's people that will repent of their halfway living I say God help me not to be a Halfway Christian God helped me not to be a 90% Christian see most of us won't identify with the halfway will we If we're honest but how many will say I'm 100% in I am completely on board with the word of God that's what he's looking for not a 90 not a 90 hey if we were in school how many here be happy with a 90% 95% 98% 99% God says you got to be in all the way you need to be 100% on board with this and that means we got to repent and we got to lay things aside we've got to keep looking at this word and how many times have I told us listen Our Lives go through a continuous sanctification there are things I used to do in my 20s that I didn't do in my my 30s there are things that I did in my 30s that I don't do in my 40s and no doubt there's things in my 40s that I won't do if I ever make it to 50 because God is continuously pulling us away from things not that they're wrong it's that they're not needful they don't edify us we've got better things we can be doing with our time we've got better things we can do with our money we've got better things we can do with our influence we've got better things we can do with our gifts and so God what does he do he brings us down he Narrows our Focus until we're walking and living in the word day by day I believe the prophet of God said something along the lines he said I sin a thousand times a day and I Repent every night I'm not resting in the fact that I'm going to be perfect but I will live by the word of God and every aspect of my life will be in line with that word amen this is a people that will humble themselves to the word and see it's not one big movement is we we've understood this and we've talked about this before that the Rapture is not an event it's a process and that process includes people that are being built up word upon word line upon line here a little there a little just a little step a day a little step a day a little step a day you can go a long ways just going one step a day go 10 steps a day you'll get there a little quicker but God's just doing a work constantly building us up building us up and we don't realize it so often until we come to those trials and we realize oh my goodness I got something I didn't have last year I've made progress I'm growing in Christ I've got a testimony I've got strength I've got power I've receive something beyond what I've had before and we start to realize he's working on me I'm going to make it cuz he doesn't start a work unless he's going to finish it and he doesn't give a word unless he's going to fulfill it he started that work and we have to trust that he's come down personally to finish it and join himself to us amen remember Ruth Ruth had all of her stages remember but at the end Ruth after all of her faith and all of her Works she had to rest in one thing and that's that Boaz had promised he'd take her to wife remember what the scripture says it says this is Naomi speaking to her she said sit still my daughter Ruth take your rest don't walk around don't be fretting don't be worrying sit down he's prepared food for you he sent you home with enough food to take you through sit down and have a meal Feast on what he's given you she said for until thou know how the matter will fall she says for the man will not be in rest until he had finished the thing this day as we close this is our opening scripture and we focus more on what he does but having heard all this when we read Hebrews again it says let us hold fast that's our part let us hold fast let us lay hold of the word let us have faith in it let us trust it let us testify of it let us confess it let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering why because he is faithful that promised he's the faithful one I'm just holding on to the faithful one this evening amen one quote three parts my ADV advice to you is this don't look at the Modern things around you the popularity and the glamour you could be but choose rather by faith him that gave the promise that someday he will come and write all wrongs and will give you eternal life and raise you up no matter if you take the despised way with the Lord's few make that choice if there are troubles in hand if there are troubles in the land if there are troubles in the church if there are troubles in the home no matter where it is make your choice by faith I'll serve God I'll humble my heart in his presence I'll take the way with God's children I see them despised and rejected and drove out and made fun of but I'll still take my post of Duty I'll stay right by and when they cry I'll cry with them and when they sorrow I'll sorrow with them the way they live I'll live like Ruth said to Naomi your ways will be my ways my ways will be your ways where you live I'll live where you go I'll go the god that you serve will be my God he says take that choice though it pulls the very skin off your conscience of thinking that you're somebody that's the thing we have to lose out of all of this is that we are only special because he chose us not because of anything we're bringing to the table he says skin yourself down and take your way with the Lord's dis desise few and stay loyal on the field of service and at the post of Duty amen God bless you let's stand if we would as the musicians come amen he never said it was an easy Road never said it wouldn't be dark didn't say it wouldn't be difficult didn't say we wouldn't face trials Temptations hurts offenses disappointments but he said I'll be with you I'll even be in you Till the End of the Age and me that's the faithful and true thing I'm holding on to I fall every day I disappoint myself if I don't disappoint him I disappoint myself every single day but yet I Look to Him and I say God you called me you've placed me you've done a work in my life and that's what I'm trusting in is that he who started the work will be faithful to complete it amen that's our rest tonight don't look to yourself don't get yourself down over what you've done over what you've not done over over where you're at it's his promise that's going to get us through to the End Amen it's his faithfulness it's the fact that he can't lie that he's prepared us to receive his word and produce it that's going to get us through amen God bless you each one let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we ought to be at rest tonight Lord though the battle rages though we Face difficult situations Lord though we see ourselves in the mirror every morning Lord and every night per perhaps we disappointed Lord at times but Lord in all of these things Lord we know you've been faithful
