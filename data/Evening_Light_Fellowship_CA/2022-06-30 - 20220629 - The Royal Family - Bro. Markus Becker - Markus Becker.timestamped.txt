[1:03:00] portions of the scripture
[1:03:02] in the book of hebrews
[1:03:04] chapter 2 verse 11 and i would like to
[1:03:08] title the subject for this evening the
[1:03:10] royal family
[1:03:12] and
[1:03:13] the the the verse that i'm reading i
[1:03:15] would like to take to believe what the
[1:03:17] bible says it seems to be a little bit
[1:03:20] spectacular for us
[1:03:22] it's
[1:03:24] thank you very much to the musicians god
[1:03:26] bless you brothers and sisters
[1:03:29] let us read two portions of the
[1:03:31] scripture
[1:03:32] in the book of hebrews chapter 2 verse
[1:03:35] 11 and i would like to
[1:03:37] title the subject for this evening the
[1:03:39] royal family
[1:03:41] and
[1:03:42] the the the verse that i'm reading i
[1:03:44] would like to take to believe what the
[1:03:47] bible says it it seems to be a little
[1:03:49] bit spectacular for us
[1:03:52] it's
[1:03:52] not ecclesiastical thinking but this is
[1:03:55] what the bible says you know
[1:03:57] chapter 2 verse 11
[1:04:00] for both i'm speaking about you
[1:04:03] and me he
[1:04:05] that sanctifiers that's christ
[1:04:08] and they who are sanctified that's us
[1:04:11] are all of one
[1:04:15] having the same father coming from the
[1:04:16] same source
[1:04:19] for which cause he is not ashamed to
[1:04:21] call them brothers
[1:04:23] that means a lot that means a lot and
[1:04:25] let us read in the book of esther
[1:04:30] esther chapter 2
[1:04:32] uh chapter 2 verse 5.
[1:04:35] and by my accent you understand that you
[1:04:37] have to take what i want to say not what
[1:04:40] i'm saying okay
[1:04:42] verse 5. now in shushan the palace there
[1:04:45] was a certain jew
[1:04:47] whose name was mordecai the son of jair
[1:04:50] the son of shimay the son of kish a
[1:04:53] benjamite
[1:04:54] who had been carried away from jerusalem
[1:04:57] with the cap
[1:04:59] captivity which have been carried away
[1:05:02] with joconia king of judah whom
[1:05:05] nebuchadnezzar
[1:05:07] the king of babylon had carried away
[1:05:10] and he brought up hadassah that is
[1:05:12] esther his uncle's daughter for she had
[1:05:15] neither neither father nor mother and
[1:05:19] the mate was fair and beautiful who
[1:05:22] mordecai when her father and mother were
[1:05:24] dead
[1:05:25] took for his own daughter may the lord
[1:05:27] add his blessing to the reading of his
[1:05:29] word he may be seated
[1:05:33] now i'm very very thankful to be here
[1:05:36] and i think brother paul my good friend
[1:05:38] my great example to
[1:05:40] grant me to speak to you my name is
[1:05:42] marcus becker i come from germany my
[1:05:43] pastor is pastor his brother rodeowald
[1:05:46] he sends his greetings to all of you
[1:05:49] especially to our most noble brother
[1:05:51] i'm here right in the u.s for some days
[1:05:54] for two weeks and
[1:05:56] yeah i had a reason to come by
[1:05:58] i told brother paul we knew us for many
[1:06:01] many years and we lost a little bit
[1:06:02] track and
[1:06:05] if i could say
[1:06:06] a
[1:06:07] great compliment i remember that
[1:06:10] him to be a good preacher i was his
[1:06:12] interpreter
[1:06:15] blessed services but
[1:06:17] preaching is a gift but character is
[1:06:18] something different you know
[1:06:20] so i remember when we were watching a
[1:06:22] little bit what's going on at bcf you
[1:06:24] know when our brother jeff resigned and
[1:06:27] there was some kind like a
[1:06:29] vacuum
[1:06:31] and um
[1:06:32] brother brother paul
[1:06:34] entered into preach there
[1:06:36] and i was impressed i was very very
[1:06:39] impressed you know not many people will
[1:06:41] do this you know
[1:06:42] to step into something there where you
[1:06:44] can lose nothing where you can gain
[1:06:46] nothing but lose everything
[1:06:48] because people surely will misunderstand
[1:06:50] that you know
[1:06:51] and i would say that that that that
[1:06:53] impressed me and uh i always said when
[1:06:56] whenever i would meet him i would let
[1:06:58] him know that that changed that that
[1:07:00] formed my life in a certain way you know
[1:07:02] to have that kind of a character
[1:07:04] and i was really blessed but i'm i'm
[1:07:06] really honored to say this to be part of
[1:07:08] the family
[1:07:10] look
[1:07:10] if if somebody is young and he's new he
[1:07:13] makes a lot of mistakes
[1:07:15] we have to live buddy but he needs
[1:07:16] somebody who's standing in the gap
[1:07:18] because we have a message mentality
[1:07:20] whenever when somebody makes a big
[1:07:22] mistakes
[1:07:23] we try to to to be distant you take it
[1:07:27] to to let me say to not to unquestion
[1:07:29] but then put him out of a brotherhood i
[1:07:31] always call it the message cold war you
[1:07:34] know
[1:07:35] the cold war then we have our democrat
[1:07:38] you know we have the east and the west
[1:07:39] and we ignore and we isolate and we put
[1:07:42] in the circle and we put out of the
[1:07:44] circle and this is not a very much of a
[1:07:47] mature attitude
[1:07:50] young people need they need
[1:07:52] somebody standing in the gap taking the
[1:07:54] shame
[1:07:55] because because and and that i've seen
[1:07:57] this in brother paul and i thought
[1:07:59] really brother paul that
[1:08:01] that
[1:08:02] how you could say that um
[1:08:04] it it blessed my life and it it changed
[1:08:07] my vision
[1:08:09] a couple of weeks ago i was in peru and
[1:08:11] there was a church
[1:08:12] big split because the pastor passed away
[1:08:14] and a lot of hard feelings and things
[1:08:18] people say foolish things out of wrong
[1:08:20] emotions
[1:08:23] yeah and i'm i'm happy that many things
[1:08:25] that we said over all these years are
[1:08:27] under the blood
[1:08:29] because it was not always the holy
[1:08:31] spirit speaking to us
[1:08:33] sometimes it was our frustration
[1:08:35] speaking to us
[1:08:37] and and if everybody takes let me say it
[1:08:39] takes these things let me say serious
[1:08:42] and makes a story and he said and he
[1:08:44] said
[1:08:45] i mean
[1:08:46] we are right but the question today is
[1:08:48] not is uh who is right
[1:08:51] the question is we have people
[1:08:53] we have young people they are watching
[1:08:55] us we have families we have children
[1:08:57] they they want to see the character
[1:08:59] behind our preaching
[1:09:01] so when i went there i knew and and they
[1:09:03] asked several ministers and they refused
[1:09:05] to go because this is a situation where
[1:09:06] you can only lose you know
[1:09:09] but i told them i said i will come
[1:09:10] because i have nothing to lose anyhow
[1:09:14] so so i was and i when i went there i
[1:09:16] had to think twice but i thought about
[1:09:17] brother paul i said we have to do
[1:09:19] sometimes you have to stand in the gap
[1:09:22] if people understand or do not
[1:09:24] understand no matter we are brothers we
[1:09:26] are friends
[1:09:27] and so i could be over help and so god
[1:09:29] blessed
[1:09:30] influence that is what i was searching
[1:09:31] brother branham speaks about uziah and
[1:09:34] he said on the other side of eternity i
[1:09:36] will tell him
[1:09:37] you say you influenced my life
[1:09:40] exactly so and brother paul i want to
[1:09:41] say you influenced my life in a very
[1:09:43] good way so god bless our noble brother
[1:09:46] i'm a gallant man of god i mean
[1:09:49] absolutely so and so i'm very happy i
[1:09:51] always try to when i i always thought by
[1:09:54] myself if i see him next time i would
[1:09:55] let him know you know really
[1:09:57] god bless you so
[1:09:58] uh i know it's the one so let me go
[1:10:00] directly into the word of the lord
[1:10:02] i left all the greetings and all these
[1:10:04] things i'm really blessed
[1:10:05] the royal family
[1:10:08] and let me be myself okay
[1:10:11] i'm traveling a lot around so i learned
[1:10:13] how to respect people i learned how to
[1:10:16] respect cultures
[1:10:19] the more you the more older you get the
[1:10:21] more you learn to respect people their
[1:10:23] mentality their background
[1:10:25] sometimes when we first traveled we
[1:10:27] traveled as germans
[1:10:31] and germany is a many germs therefore
[1:10:34] you know there's a lot of problems
[1:10:35] you're in trouble already when you
[1:10:36] arrive
[1:10:38] but
[1:10:39] but
[1:10:40] we learnt really to understand cultures
[1:10:42] and let people stand the way they are we
[1:10:44] cannot germanize everybody yeah we want
[1:10:46] to dramatize them with the word of the
[1:10:48] lord but not germanize them man
[1:10:51] so so also
[1:10:53] i hope i can say i can start with a
[1:10:55] sentence
[1:10:57] not offending you
[1:10:59] but the message that we believe does not
[1:11:00] come from america
[1:11:02] it comes from the presence of our father
[1:11:05] amen
[1:11:06] amen
[1:11:08] it does not come from jefferson well no
[1:11:10] it is not brother branham's message
[1:11:12] brother brennan was the voice
[1:11:14] the voice and and what we listen is the
[1:11:16] voice behind the voice
[1:11:19] the message of the hour is not a
[1:11:21] doctrine
[1:11:22] the message of the hour is our father
[1:11:24] talking to us
[1:11:27] when we gave our heart to the lord our
[1:11:29] our attribute
[1:11:30] god laid laid part of himself into our
[1:11:33] lives
[1:11:34] and and it is written in psalm it was
[1:11:36] said he even laid eternity into our
[1:11:39] hearts there's only one who is eternal
[1:11:41] that's god himself
[1:11:43] so when we answer to the altar called it
[1:11:45] was not our brain our brain was not fast
[1:11:47] enough it was the attribute answering to
[1:11:49] that call
[1:11:51] so so so so and then brother brahm said
[1:11:54] this bible became a new bible
[1:11:56] it's not that we should that we should
[1:11:58] throw the bible away because the prophet
[1:12:00] said the bible is the book of the year
[1:12:02] he said it will always be the book of
[1:12:03] the year till the end
[1:12:05] so so but it is a new bible and we
[1:12:07] understand that's our story
[1:12:10] this is our book that's our
[1:12:11] identification
[1:12:13] and and here we have that little girl by
[1:12:15] the name of esther by the way i want to
[1:12:17] greet the family of brother paul the
[1:12:19] boys that i met over there in brother
[1:12:20] ron peterson
[1:12:22] have very good memories still
[1:12:25] so esther
[1:12:26] the the story starts with
[1:12:30] a king
[1:12:32] who had a had a wife who was not very
[1:12:34] much obedient
[1:12:36] and the king
[1:12:39] the princes around the king he gave him
[1:12:41] a principle he said look if your wife is
[1:12:44] not obedient to your command all of our
[1:12:46] wives will
[1:12:47] do whatever they want
[1:12:50] they understood that we are examples
[1:12:53] do we understand that we are an example
[1:12:55] for our children
[1:12:56] for the people they watch us they
[1:12:58] observe us and we have a young
[1:13:00] generation especially preachers kids
[1:13:02] they they can detect
[1:13:04] uh they can even see body languages
[1:13:07] they can detect tensions you try to to
[1:13:09] to to to to to smile and to smile things
[1:13:12] away but they can detect already some
[1:13:14] vibes
[1:13:15] so it's so important that that we for
[1:13:17] all problems that we have that we find
[1:13:19] solutions
[1:13:21] if not it is a powerless church they
[1:13:23] have just a doctrine or some pictures of
[1:13:25] brother branham but we need solutions to
[1:13:27] go on you know
[1:13:29] so so we see that that this little girl
[1:13:32] esther
[1:13:35] her life story starts with two names
[1:13:38] one is esther which means
[1:13:41] star
[1:13:42] the other one is hadassah
[1:13:46] some translations say bright other
[1:13:48] translations say mer
[1:13:51] and you have to understand that we have
[1:13:53] two names
[1:13:55] amen on one hand side you are just an
[1:13:58] american
[1:14:00] on the other hand side on the inner man
[1:14:02] you come from god
[1:14:05] brother royal family is a privilege
[1:14:08] nobody can preach you in
[1:14:10] and nobody can preach you out of this no
[1:14:13] sir
[1:14:14] amen
[1:14:15] therefore this message that we believe
[1:14:16] is not a cult
[1:14:18] and a cult uh as long as you're a good
[1:14:20] brother people come to you and say oh
[1:14:22] it's our brother from the before the
[1:14:24] foundation of the world and we were
[1:14:26] eager and somehow you left and from that
[1:14:28] moment and the same people would say
[1:14:29] okay he left us because he was never
[1:14:31] part of us
[1:14:32] so you come back and you repent oh our
[1:14:35] brother from eternity we know us already
[1:14:37] okay who who wants to believe this
[1:14:40] if somebody's a brother he's a brother
[1:14:43] he's even if he's in spiritual amnesia
[1:14:45] but if he's a brother he's a brother
[1:14:47] if somebody's an eagle he's an eagle
[1:14:49] sometimes he forgets what he is but he
[1:14:50] still is what he is
[1:14:52] amen
[1:14:53] therefore this message is not a cult
[1:14:56] amen and and and and you are just a
[1:15:00] simple man uh over there in the us i'm
[1:15:03] just a simple brother from from germany
[1:15:05] i tell you one thing i'm a very very
[1:15:08] sympathetic man if you only would knew
[1:15:11] me
[1:15:12] because i i i this is now marcus this is
[1:15:15] my vision brother bram speaks about the
[1:15:17] tent vision and people say where is the
[1:15:19] tent
[1:15:20] is it in
[1:15:21] costa rica is it in germany is it in the
[1:15:24] u.s
[1:15:25] i said maybe this is my own
[1:15:26] interpretation of it and you don't have
[1:15:28] to accept it but i believe the bride is
[1:15:30] the tent
[1:15:32] because because
[1:15:33] we live in a tent if this earthly
[1:15:35] tabernacle
[1:15:38] in that tabernacle is nothing else in a
[1:15:39] tent if this earthly tabernacle will be
[1:15:42] dissolved we have a building from god
[1:15:44] which is eternal
[1:15:47] and then paul continues in romans he
[1:15:48] said we're now living in a tent in a
[1:15:52] tabernacle
[1:15:54] remember the vision that that that moses
[1:15:56] who was the first one having a tint
[1:15:58] vision that was moses
[1:16:00] going up and when he came down he built
[1:16:02] up the tabernacle according the vision
[1:16:04] that he saw and this was brother brandon
[1:16:06] revealing that his body soul and spirits
[1:16:09] and brother ben even said the curtain
[1:16:11] between the only supporters in the and
[1:16:14] in that place is our self-will the the
[1:16:16] the temple in jerusalem is a shadow on a
[1:16:19] human being
[1:16:22] and we're living in it this is no marcus
[1:16:24] we live in it for 70 80 years
[1:16:28] and then we go to our real death in our
[1:16:31] true body
[1:16:32] therefore i said i'm a very very
[1:16:34] sympathetic man but i'm just living in a
[1:16:36] german tent
[1:16:38] for 70 80 years standing in my own way
[1:16:41] having my complexes having my genes
[1:16:43] having having my story having my
[1:16:45] childhood
[1:16:47] but in me
[1:16:49] there is something of god
[1:16:51] and in you exactly the same thing
[1:16:54] so so that question of our esther who
[1:16:58] comes into view
[1:17:00] she is
[1:17:01] she she
[1:17:02] she is a she is a she does not have a
[1:17:05] father and doesn't have a mother
[1:17:07] she is part of the jewish group taken
[1:17:10] away in captivity captivity
[1:17:13] so our great king has veros he is king
[1:17:17] over 127
[1:17:19] countries
[1:17:22] now he wants to marry again and we are
[1:17:24] not preaching this evening about
[1:17:26] marriage in divorce no centimeter
[1:17:29] okay i wouldn't dare to do it behind
[1:17:30] another pulpit but we speak about a
[1:17:32] spiritual
[1:17:34] application nothing else okay please
[1:17:36] don't misinterpret it
[1:17:39] so he's searching now for a new wife
[1:17:43] a girl that he can marry
[1:17:45] and
[1:17:47] she is that woman is a nice girl
[1:17:50] but she has a special qualifications the
[1:17:53] bible makes it very sure
[1:17:56] she has no father and she has no mother
[1:18:00] now that reminds us to melchizedek
[1:18:04] amen we had no father
[1:18:06] and we had no mother
[1:18:08] remember he who sanctifies
[1:18:10] and he who's who is sanctified
[1:18:13] comes of one
[1:18:15] the same family
[1:18:17] so so let us see a little bit her
[1:18:19] background and i would ask uh the
[1:18:20] brothers and sisters to to
[1:18:22] to just
[1:18:23] i'm a german but when it comes to
[1:18:25] technique i get a little bit nervous can
[1:18:27] you just put some of this lights yeah
[1:18:30] and i will tell it in in some kind like
[1:18:32] a story because
[1:18:34] this is now the time of the roman empire
[1:18:38] we are in the fourth century
[1:18:41] and we have uh an eastern part in the
[1:18:43] western part
[1:18:45] uh this is now 300 around 320
[1:18:49] after christ
[1:18:51] in the roman empire we have different
[1:18:54] caesars emperors
[1:18:57] now in human nature
[1:19:02] many if somebody is a human leader he
[1:19:04] cannot
[1:19:05] see
[1:19:06] somebody besides him
[1:19:09] okay so
[1:19:11] we cannot have two caesars
[1:19:13] uh we cannot have two emperors so on one
[1:19:16] day we have our most noble friend by the
[1:19:18] name of constantine
[1:19:21] who decided now go
[1:19:24] into war with the other caesar to find
[1:19:27] out
[1:19:28] if we are two
[1:19:29] is one too much
[1:19:31] okay
[1:19:32] this is tombstone
[1:19:35] this is billy the kid against against
[1:19:37] the daltons so
[1:19:40] this saloon only needs one
[1:19:43] okay this is human nature
[1:19:47] brother brahm said if you have a gift
[1:19:48] watch what you will do with the gift
[1:19:52] will you help your brothers
[1:19:54] or would you pull them down
[1:19:56] would you make a name for themselves for
[1:19:58] yourself like like nimrod or will you
[1:20:00] help your brothers
[1:20:01] to come into their position
[1:20:03] but human nature brother i tell you is
[1:20:06] is selfish nature
[1:20:09] i mean
[1:20:10] can you please go back again brother so
[1:20:12] we see that now war starts
[1:20:16] and uh what happens is
[1:20:19] god is in control because he wanted to
[1:20:22] propagate christianity over the roman
[1:20:25] empire
[1:20:26] at that time it is god's plan
[1:20:29] what happens is that
[1:20:31] right before the night or the day
[1:20:33] there's different legions about it
[1:20:36] we see that constantine he sees a light
[1:20:40] over the sun
[1:20:41] and a cross
[1:20:43] and he hears these noble words in hick
[1:20:47] in hawk signo vince's that means you
[1:20:49] will win with this sign
[1:20:53] so
[1:20:54] he believes in a god that he that he
[1:20:56] doesn't know and his group will have now
[1:21:00] a sign of a cross
[1:21:02] on their shields and he's fighting
[1:21:06] on the milivian bridge in rome against
[1:21:09] marcenzius
[1:21:11] and constantine wins the wins the battle
[1:21:15] and from now on constantine he is the
[1:21:18] leader over the whole roman empire
[1:21:23] that question is settled
[1:21:25] at the same time we have different
[1:21:28] opinions in the church
[1:21:31] great opinions because
[1:21:34] we have different schools of churches in
[1:21:36] the eastern part
[1:21:38] and in the western part
[1:21:41] the question is this
[1:21:43] is
[1:21:44] jesus created
[1:21:47] or is he part of god
[1:21:50] that is not a problem for them as long
[1:21:53] as there are two different emperors but
[1:21:55] now it becomes into one state
[1:21:59] and this question have to be solved
[1:22:02] in other
[1:22:03] that means
[1:22:04] let me read it like this one purpose of
[1:22:06] the that is wikipedia one purpose of the
[1:22:08] council was to resolve
[1:22:11] disagreements arising from within the
[1:22:14] church of alexandria
[1:22:16] over the nature of jesus in his
[1:22:18] relationship to the father in particular
[1:22:21] whether the son had been begotten by the
[1:22:23] father from his own being and therefore
[1:22:26] having no beginning
[1:22:28] or else created out of nothing or
[1:22:30] therefore having a beginning so we have
[1:22:33] two
[1:22:34] big schools and they are one against the
[1:22:36] other one is arias one is okay
[1:22:40] the question is clear
[1:22:42] constantine was an unbeliever
[1:22:46] he wants to make deals
[1:22:48] i mean tremendous something like this
[1:22:51] unbelievable okay i mean he wants to
[1:22:54] make deals
[1:22:56] and maxencious he's a loser
[1:22:59] he's a total disaster you know something
[1:23:01] like this so what happens he makes a
[1:23:04] deal because he understands
[1:23:06] the god that i don't know is very very
[1:23:09] strong because i saw the vision
[1:23:12] but i don't understand the doctrine
[1:23:14] so we now have to make this as a state
[1:23:17] religion
[1:23:19] but you cannot have a state religion if
[1:23:21] the religious leaders don't understand
[1:23:24] their own doctrine
[1:23:27] you understand
[1:23:28] so
[1:23:29] he brought them together on the council
[1:23:31] of nicaea to say look brother i'm not
[1:23:34] interested in the solution because i'm
[1:23:35] not believing anyhow but when we come
[1:23:38] out of this
[1:23:40] we have one doctrine okay
[1:23:43] it's true because he wanted to make a
[1:23:45] deal
[1:23:46] he now wants to make this god they call
[1:23:49] it christian christian cristianos
[1:23:52] christians
[1:23:53] but i cannot make it state religion when
[1:23:56] they don't know their own doctrine
[1:23:58] so first we come together
[1:24:00] you make you make a deal you make an
[1:24:02] agreement no matter what i believe
[1:24:04] everything because he was a believer and
[1:24:07] he wasn't a believer anyhow
[1:24:09] and they found out
[1:24:10] that
[1:24:12] they believed in jesus to be part of god
[1:24:16] not just
[1:24:17] somebody who was created like an angel
[1:24:20] but part of god this was the birth of
[1:24:22] the trinity
[1:24:24] idea
[1:24:25] now i will not go into it sir it's not
[1:24:27] my place on the wednesday because i'd
[1:24:29] like to like to tell a story about
[1:24:30] esther but brother brandon makes sure
[1:24:32] jesus was completely god and completely
[1:24:35] man
[1:24:36] that
[1:24:37] that's what he says
[1:24:38] but it is an important question
[1:24:41] they call it a question of being homo
[1:24:42] homo
[1:24:44] homo uzios of one substance
[1:24:48] so
[1:24:49] there is a big difference
[1:24:52] between something which is created and
[1:24:54] something which is burst
[1:24:56] now if i'm creating something i'm
[1:24:59] building something up
[1:25:02] but if i'm birthing something that means
[1:25:04] part of me is in this
[1:25:08] i created many things
[1:25:10] but i burst only one daughter
[1:25:13] and the difference between the things i
[1:25:15] created in the birth part of me is in my
[1:25:17] daughter my own genes
[1:25:20] she is not just created she's she's
[1:25:22] begotten
[1:25:24] part of me is in her
[1:25:26] that's the difference between a birth
[1:25:28] and just a membership
[1:25:30] it's a big difference
[1:25:32] once your birth part of god is in you
[1:25:35] blessed be the name of the lord so we
[1:25:37] see this and please make the next one it
[1:25:40] was an essential question of that time
[1:25:43] and brother branham says and that is
[1:25:45] what constantine and his successes did
[1:25:48] at nicaea and after nicaea they invented
[1:25:51] the people of god to the convention and
[1:25:53] when the church sat down and eat and
[1:25:55] rose up to play partaking of church from
[1:25:58] ceremonies pagan feasts named after
[1:26:00] christian rites she was trapped she had
[1:26:03] a committed fornication and god walked
[1:26:05] out brother maim said the true believers
[1:26:07] should not have gone there
[1:26:09] and he he parallels it with with with
[1:26:12] the more bites
[1:26:14] they said we are all one but brother we
[1:26:16] are not all one
[1:26:17] we are not all one we are
[1:26:19] this message was not based on william
[1:26:22] branham
[1:26:23] this message was based on the pillar of
[1:26:25] fire
[1:26:26] that's a difference okay
[1:26:28] so we see it was a very important
[1:26:31] question and now the question is now
[1:26:33] where's the bride in it
[1:26:35] and let's have let's see it brother
[1:26:37] for the next one okay
[1:26:39] so
[1:26:40] here's what brother brahma said so he
[1:26:42] first was god jehovah
[1:26:44] and out of him let's just picture now as
[1:26:48] a little drama so you can get us
[1:26:50] let's see come out of space there was
[1:26:52] nothing let's make a little white light
[1:26:55] like a mystic light like a halo
[1:26:58] and that was the logos that went out of
[1:27:00] god in the beginning
[1:27:02] that was the son of god that came out of
[1:27:04] the bosom of the father that was what
[1:27:06] was in the beginning was the word and
[1:27:08] the word was with god and the word was
[1:27:10] god and the word was made flesh and
[1:27:12] dwelt among us in the beginning was god
[1:27:14] and then out of god came the logos a
[1:27:16] part of god that went out of god
[1:27:21] you remember that brother abraham said
[1:27:22] the first thing that i see is uh a
[1:27:25] little white light
[1:27:27] and he calls it like a child playing in
[1:27:29] the in
[1:27:30] in the garden but then brother brahma
[1:27:31] said this and i was puzzled over it he
[1:27:33] said the first thing that god created
[1:27:35] was angels another quote
[1:27:38] how to bring it together sure he created
[1:27:41] angels
[1:27:42] creation
[1:27:44] but that logos was not created
[1:27:47] it came out of him
[1:27:50] do you understand that we don't have two
[1:27:51] gods
[1:27:53] it's one person
[1:27:55] amen because that logos came out of him
[1:27:58] it was not created like the angels it
[1:28:01] was part of him
[1:28:03] now we learned through the message of
[1:28:05] the hour and here you see the royal
[1:28:06] family and
[1:28:08] remember this is what just one service
[1:28:10] please know there's much more to say and
[1:28:12] i don't know if i have all the balance
[1:28:14] in it but it's not a question for this
[1:28:15] evening
[1:28:17] but
[1:28:18] brother braham taught us
[1:28:20] the bride was in christ even on calvary
[1:28:23] as eve was in adam
[1:28:27] in what form ever but she's part of him
[1:28:30] we were reading it in in in in hebrew
[1:28:33] but if the bride was in christ and
[1:28:36] christ was melchizedek before then the
[1:28:39] bride must have been in him or too
[1:28:43] i don't speak about the church the bride
[1:28:46] i mean piled eve part of adam
[1:28:50] they call it the family of god
[1:28:53] so if the bride was in
[1:28:54] melchizedek i mean in some form in his
[1:28:57] thoughts whatever
[1:28:59] be sure she must have been in the logos
[1:29:03] because mckenzie came out of that logos
[1:29:06] amen
[1:29:07] so if she was in that logos she must
[1:29:10] have been on god
[1:29:14] nobody can preach you into it
[1:29:16] therefore brother brahman said if you
[1:29:17] have eternal life you always hear it
[1:29:20] but there will be people that will get
[1:29:22] eternal life that's true they will be
[1:29:25] safe not
[1:29:26] even at the white stone judgment but
[1:29:28] here we speak about a family a royal
[1:29:30] family
[1:29:31] that's different
[1:29:33] i'm a royal family
[1:29:35] so so
[1:29:36] in whatever form i cannot tell you but
[1:29:39] here is a picture amen next one please
[1:29:42] here's what brother brahm said the
[1:29:44] eternal thoughts of god let me ask you
[1:29:47] are the thoughts of god eternal
[1:29:49] if you can see this you will see many
[1:29:52] things
[1:29:53] god is unchangeable both essence and
[1:29:55] behavior we have studied that and proven
[1:29:57] that already god is infinite in his
[1:29:59] abilities so therefore he is god must be
[1:30:02] omniscient if he is omniscient then he
[1:30:05] is not now learning nor is he taking
[1:30:08] counsel even with himself nor is he at
[1:30:11] any time adding to his knowledge if he
[1:30:13] can add to his knowledge that he's not
[1:30:15] omniscient
[1:30:16] the best way we could say is that
[1:30:18] sometimes he will be but this is not
[1:30:20] spirit scriptural
[1:30:22] he is omniscient he has never had a new
[1:30:24] thought about anything because all his
[1:30:26] thoughts he has always had and always
[1:30:29] will have
[1:30:30] and knows the end from the beginning
[1:30:32] because he's god and now now you're
[1:30:34] coming in does the thoughts of god are
[1:30:38] eternal
[1:30:39] they are real
[1:30:41] and here's the difference between our
[1:30:43] thoughts our thoughts we think about
[1:30:46] things
[1:30:47] but he thought is substance
[1:30:51] they are real they are not simply like a
[1:30:54] man with a blueprint
[1:30:56] he has drawn up which one day will be
[1:30:59] translated into substance and form but
[1:31:02] they are already real and eternal and
[1:31:06] part of gods
[1:31:10] so when we say we were in the mind of
[1:31:12] god it was not just god was just
[1:31:14] thinking about us we were part of him
[1:31:18] part of his being
[1:31:20] blessed be i don't know who else was in
[1:31:23] that thought but we're just speaking
[1:31:24] about the bride you understand esther
[1:31:27] she had no father and she had no mother
[1:31:30] hallelujah bless blessed be the long
[1:31:33] so one thing is sure
[1:31:35] and i i'm always like to make that
[1:31:37] little demonstration that that brother
[1:31:39] beckett was making with some years ago
[1:31:41] this is just a demonstration it's not a
[1:31:43] doctrine just a demonstration to make
[1:31:45] things tangible
[1:31:48] now god before the foundation he made a
[1:31:50] picture of his family
[1:31:52] and here we were
[1:31:55] i mean therefore we are not arrogant
[1:31:59] but we are proud of our father
[1:32:02] we are proud who we are not arrogant but
[1:32:04] proud who we are
[1:32:05] amen so god took our souls
[1:32:09] and throwed it
[1:32:11] in seven church ages on seven countries
[1:32:14] some in america some in germany some in
[1:32:16] luther's time some in wesley some
[1:32:18] impulse some some in our time and god
[1:32:20] knows one thing my sheep will hear my
[1:32:22] voice
[1:32:24] i will i place the receiver in their
[1:32:26] hearts
[1:32:27] amen and god knows one thing
[1:32:30] when time is over
[1:32:33] the whole
[1:32:34] the family will be back together
[1:32:37] and brother branham explains it
[1:32:39] brother blame said this and
[1:32:41] the prophet was the first one
[1:32:44] who said in the time in the days of the
[1:32:46] voice of the seventh angel the mystery
[1:32:49] of god
[1:32:51] not mysteries
[1:32:52] scofield already revealed mysteries
[1:32:56] but they were big mysteries
[1:32:58] the mystery brother brain was the first
[1:33:00] man
[1:33:02] ever on this earth who said without you
[1:33:04] god is not complete anymore
[1:33:08] amen
[1:33:09] yet we were in his mind we could not
[1:33:11] have fellowship we should have been
[1:33:13] expressed but we were already part of
[1:33:15] him
[1:33:18] as my daughter was always in me
[1:33:20] he was not created she needed her time
[1:33:22] to be expressed
[1:33:24] so we wanted to come directly in our in
[1:33:27] our theophany
[1:33:29] amen and we landed in ohio
[1:33:34] and we came into families god never
[1:33:36] asked us do you want to be bro do you
[1:33:38] want to be male or female
[1:33:40] you want to be american or german
[1:33:44] i mean god never asked us do you want to
[1:33:46] be black or white
[1:33:49] sometimes we came into families that we
[1:33:51] were not choosing
[1:33:53] um i came from a family which was
[1:33:55] divorced
[1:33:56] and i hated myself in that situation but
[1:33:58] god there's a quote that brother blame
[1:34:00] said he said god planned our birth for
[1:34:03] many generations
[1:34:06] god did not only knew that we were that
[1:34:08] will come he planned our coming
[1:34:13] so in second world war all these hitler
[1:34:15] boys could not kill your father or your
[1:34:18] grandfather
[1:34:19] because you must have been expressed
[1:34:22] so you could just send them right into
[1:34:24] this secret line all these hitler boys
[1:34:26] come but god had to protect your father
[1:34:28] because he knew you had to come
[1:34:32] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:34:34] and if god planned my birth surely god
[1:34:36] planned my death
[1:34:39] therefore he came to marilyn monroe and
[1:34:41] said there's a young girl she will dying
[1:34:43] at this in this minute god knows the
[1:34:45] minute when we will die
[1:34:47] when we are born god knows already this
[1:34:49] is the end of his life
[1:34:51] what what a thing how we are in the
[1:34:53] hands of the lord
[1:34:54] can you say amen
[1:34:57] that's very special nobody can preach
[1:34:59] you into the family
[1:35:01] and nobody can preach you out
[1:35:03] when we were younger we would like to
[1:35:05] bring we give people if we have problems
[1:35:07] with people we like to to to give them
[1:35:09] over to satan
[1:35:11] because we did not have any remedy we
[1:35:13] didn't have a solution so it was easy to
[1:35:15] just unchristianize him it was the most
[1:35:17] easy way for
[1:35:19] unmatured people to to just say this is
[1:35:21] not a real brother so because
[1:35:23] today we learned we have to give them
[1:35:25] into god's hands
[1:35:26] he said heavenly father my my brother is
[1:35:28] as long as wrong as he can be but i
[1:35:31] believe it's my brother
[1:35:33] so so you had a lot of patience with me
[1:35:35] lord have patience with my brother
[1:35:38] amen can you say amen so so when i in in
[1:35:41] south america suddenly they are varied
[1:35:43] they are much more much more of guerrero
[1:35:45] fighters so one comes to the other and
[1:35:48] he says now now i will send you over to
[1:35:51] hell
[1:35:52] i said if he comes next time you say you
[1:35:54] cannot send me to hell because you
[1:35:55] didn't pay my price
[1:35:59] i mean you didn't pay my price you will
[1:36:00] send me nowhere i'm i have a father
[1:36:03] can you say amen
[1:36:05] next one please i mean
[1:36:07] i mean so therefore we we came on this
[1:36:11] earth
[1:36:12] and we came into a body that we didn't
[1:36:15] like
[1:36:17] i mean when we were teenagers we hated
[1:36:19] ourselves amen you remember the freckles
[1:36:23] i still remember that the preaching
[1:36:24] about the freckles i hated my freckles
[1:36:28] i see now my daughter hates the freckles
[1:36:30] i learned from you brother paul i tell
[1:36:32] you honey you will get a husband who
[1:36:34] loves your freckles one day
[1:36:36] exactly so but we hated us
[1:36:39] i mean do you know one thing brother
[1:36:42] most of our problems we're staying in
[1:36:44] our own way
[1:36:46] and and brother brahm himself he says
[1:36:47] i'm a melancholic
[1:36:50] and and even in the message uh on the
[1:36:53] wings of a snow white dove i mean that
[1:36:55] is 1965 he said all my life i was a
[1:36:58] neurotic
[1:36:59] so we thought as pentecostals the holy
[1:37:01] ghost come and everything is so it's not
[1:37:05] is not because we still have owner our
[1:37:07] human nature
[1:37:08] but we have enough grace and enough
[1:37:10] power to bring that human nature under
[1:37:12] his control
[1:37:14] but it's there
[1:37:15] it's there brother bram said i'm a nor
[1:37:17] and here is 1963 he brother brain
[1:37:20] received the holy ghost
[1:37:23] it was not a question of the new birth
[1:37:25] that that is where we outmade our
[1:37:26] mistakes
[1:37:28] we we
[1:37:29] we come in the flesh and then we ask
[1:37:30] ourselves if we are born again so
[1:37:32] another prayer line another prayer line
[1:37:35] another laying on our hands
[1:37:37] i said brother you can go so much in
[1:37:38] prayer lines that at the end you don't
[1:37:39] know if you are saved or not
[1:37:42] more prayer lines and more doubts come
[1:37:44] amen
[1:37:46] you have to make a star but from there
[1:37:47] you have to grow and you have to
[1:37:49] understand you have still that nature
[1:37:51] it's a process
[1:37:53] a person says yeah there's prayer and i
[1:37:55] was great i'm i i do prayers myself
[1:37:57] that's fine but the main thing is is is
[1:38:00] a process
[1:38:02] people sometimes think a minister comes
[1:38:04] like santa claus
[1:38:06] and and preaches things it cannot be
[1:38:08] because growth comes by god
[1:38:11] show me the prayer line for rapturing
[1:38:12] faith it will not be
[1:38:14] rapturing phrases in the word
[1:38:16] so if this answers in the word all my
[1:38:18] answers are in the word
[1:38:20] if young people need a prayer line let's
[1:38:21] go on but don't make it make a tradition
[1:38:24] of if if i wasn't at the altar it wasn't
[1:38:27] spiritual no take take your blessing
[1:38:30] wherever you are
[1:38:32] let's blessed be the name on hearer of
[1:38:34] the prophet look look look and he comes
[1:38:36] in the flesh and he says i build up a
[1:38:37] complex
[1:38:39] because he listened to people
[1:38:42] brother has two things for ministers
[1:38:44] that is difficult and if the younger you
[1:38:46] are the more you are affected to it
[1:38:49] the first thing is eat perpetual critics
[1:38:52] because this discourages you
[1:38:55] but the other thing is perpetual
[1:38:56] applause
[1:38:59] we need a balance in both things
[1:39:01] we need it but we need the critics
[1:39:04] and we need the applause but everything
[1:39:06] which is out of balance brings us out of
[1:39:07] balance
[1:39:09] can you say amen
[1:39:12] blessed be the name of the lord so so
[1:39:14] here he comes he listens to to these
[1:39:16] voices now i always tell the young
[1:39:18] people i said you are wednesday for
[1:39:20] example and we don't feel well we have a
[1:39:22] little cuff like
[1:39:25] and then we hear a voice no today you
[1:39:26] cannot go to church
[1:39:28] no no no but you you will bring a
[1:39:30] pandemia over the whole church no you
[1:39:32] have to sleep
[1:39:34] have you ever heard that voice
[1:39:36] you can say amen so in other words that
[1:39:38] voice speaks german and english
[1:39:42] because i hear it in german you hear it
[1:39:43] in english
[1:39:45] and and i always say this if satan tells
[1:39:48] you not to come to church you tell him
[1:39:49] no you stay at home
[1:39:51] [Applause]
[1:39:54] amen you say no you stay at home
[1:39:57] blessed be blessed be the name of the
[1:39:58] lord but we come into the flesh and once
[1:40:01] you meant to come into the flesh don't
[1:40:04] doubt your salvation
[1:40:06] don't don't doubt your family
[1:40:09] but come back and know the potential
[1:40:11] lays in me
[1:40:13] and let god again touch that eternal
[1:40:16] pardon you and you're coming back on
[1:40:17] track
[1:40:18] so whenever god came and and the prophet
[1:40:21] had his wings moved it's
[1:40:24] a swing moves
[1:40:26] okay he was a melancholic
[1:40:28] so god always brought him up on a higher
[1:40:30] level
[1:40:31] amen amen here he comes in another
[1:40:33] dimension will it help you to see the
[1:40:35] other dimension yes amen
[1:40:37] here he has again he is down and
[1:40:40] somebody comes in clifton cafeterias he
[1:40:42] said because thou has chosen brother
[1:40:45] brahman said i'm i'm never the same
[1:40:46] woman in brandon again and two years
[1:40:48] later he preaches the present stage of
[1:40:49] my ministry he's completely depressed
[1:40:52] that's how we go sometimes we forget who
[1:40:54] we are
[1:40:55] and then god comes and reminds us who we
[1:40:57] are
[1:41:00] brother i'm i'm dealing some time with
[1:41:01] people with with some kind like like
[1:41:04] like hell mental health issues
[1:41:07] and and it will occur more and more in
[1:41:09] our church because this is a very
[1:41:10] difficult time to live
[1:41:12] and one of the sisters she gave me a
[1:41:14] great compliment
[1:41:15] she said brother marcus one thing is so
[1:41:17] my psyche is not my faith
[1:41:20] my faith is here my psyche is here
[1:41:24] if you're a menopause your psyche is
[1:41:25] upside down but your faith always holds
[1:41:28] you don't feel it but god doesn't go
[1:41:30] after feeling god goes after his his
[1:41:32] eternal plan
[1:41:34] can you say amen
[1:41:36] blessed be the name of the lord so so so
[1:41:38] so so god says to brother ben look to
[1:41:40] the right
[1:41:41] this is your life i ask you the question
[1:41:44] when did these
[1:41:46] mountains appear
[1:41:48] 1963
[1:41:51] when god
[1:41:52] created the earth
[1:41:54] he made already that ridge of mountains
[1:41:57] knowing that in millions of years i have
[1:41:59] a seventh angel
[1:42:01] he will be a melancholic
[1:42:03] so we are he he was already portraying
[1:42:06] his life
[1:42:08] right when he created the earth
[1:42:10] don't you think that god knows about
[1:42:12] everything about us and we we start in
[1:42:15] our prayer line um heavenly father you
[1:42:17] know and you know and god says i know
[1:42:22] i'm in you know you know you know my
[1:42:24] life and you know and god says i know
[1:42:27] amen
[1:42:28] so so so he was building up he was
[1:42:31] showing the end from the beginning i
[1:42:32] always say this
[1:42:34] now
[1:42:35] the voice says to brother branham this
[1:42:37] is
[1:42:38] your life
[1:42:40] and i want to tell to you this
[1:42:43] is
[1:42:44] your life
[1:42:48] so brother if you are on the mountaintop
[1:42:50] don't become arrogant
[1:42:51] oh
[1:42:53] if i see this family and their children
[1:42:55] i i they should only believe they should
[1:42:58] only believe and god says okay i will
[1:42:59] bring the same thing to you
[1:43:01] and then if you're on the mountaintop
[1:43:03] never forget that the next valley will
[1:43:04] come
[1:43:06] there's no reason to be arrogant because
[1:43:08] we are not having now a good time
[1:43:10] but one thing is sure if you're in the
[1:43:12] valley don't give up
[1:43:14] if in the valley never give up because
[1:43:16] one thing is sure the next mountaintop
[1:43:18] comes
[1:43:19] [Applause]
[1:43:21] can you say amen
[1:43:23] but it doesn't come by nice
[1:43:25] bible slogans
[1:43:28] it comes by an understanding from where
[1:43:29] we come from
[1:43:31] we come from the mind of god
[1:43:33] and nobody will stop us
[1:43:35] even we will not stop ourselves we will
[1:43:38] pay for our nonsense
[1:43:41] but it will not throw us out of the
[1:43:43] family of god
[1:43:45] i talk about the bride okay this would
[1:43:48] be the name of the lord can you say amen
[1:43:51] so so therefore the the voice says to
[1:43:54] brother abraham here god understands
[1:43:56] people
[1:43:58] god understands human being and i i
[1:44:00] repeated what i'm doing from time to
[1:44:02] time
[1:44:03] a young boy he wanted to to buy some
[1:44:05] dogs okay
[1:44:07] and he goes and he sees
[1:44:09] one handicapped dog and the owner of the
[1:44:11] dogs he comes down the staircase and he
[1:44:14] says why do you want to have that dog i
[1:44:15] mean he's handicapped he cannot walk
[1:44:18] like the rest he cannot and the boy
[1:44:20] is putting up his trousers
[1:44:23] and from his knee down he has a protease
[1:44:26] an artificial leg
[1:44:28] and the boy says this i want to have
[1:44:29] this dog because when we go out i
[1:44:31] understand him and he understands me
[1:44:34] and brother brandon quote brother
[1:44:36] branham god became man to understand man
[1:44:40] quote brother branham but god became
[1:44:42] teenager to understand teenagers
[1:44:45] that's our father
[1:44:47] so when you pray even you you you pray
[1:44:49] about immoral thoughts
[1:44:52] god knows what you talk about it
[1:44:55] i mean he understands that we are human
[1:44:56] beings
[1:44:58] can you say amen
[1:44:59] that makes our message so sympathetic
[1:45:03] that makes the gospel the good news
[1:45:06] that brings relationship this message is
[1:45:08] not a doctrine this message is a
[1:45:10] relationship
[1:45:12] to our father
[1:45:14] because we come from the same family but
[1:45:16] we did not know who we were
[1:45:18] until we heard a voice
[1:45:20] we came to the lord and we were just uh
[1:45:23] somebody brought us under conviction and
[1:45:24] you're this and you're this and you
[1:45:26] listen christ died for me yes
[1:45:28] and we have to start like this but you
[1:45:30] cannot live your whole christian life
[1:45:31] under convictions
[1:45:33] once you must find out i'm a son of god
[1:45:35] i was trapped into the things of this
[1:45:38] world
[1:45:39] but the judge is my attorney
[1:45:42] can you say amen and brother i tell you
[1:45:44] this if somebody believes this from all
[1:45:46] his heart he will not become a worldly
[1:45:48] person
[1:45:49] no he will not he will do everything to
[1:45:51] serve the lord
[1:45:52] because he understands who he is
[1:45:55] blessed be the name of the lord make the
[1:45:56] next one amen this is the last one
[1:45:58] before yes this is the nice again
[1:46:01] therefore i i showed you in the bible in
[1:46:03] in the message of the hour
[1:46:05] we do not live by slogans
[1:46:09] have you ever heard when the young
[1:46:10] people that come out brother marcus
[1:46:12] we want a convention i tell you brother
[1:46:14] that was deep
[1:46:15] and we never heard it that way i always
[1:46:18] say yeah yeah you never heard it that
[1:46:19] way because the prophet never said it
[1:46:21] that way
[1:46:22] therefore you never heard it that way
[1:46:23] okay
[1:46:25] that was that was how do you say
[1:46:27] tremendous
[1:46:29] it was unbelievable
[1:46:32] fine
[1:46:33] then i said to the young person what did
[1:46:34] you get what did you understand nothing
[1:46:37] nothing okay if nothing i mean what is
[1:46:39] tremendous about nothing
[1:46:42] amen then then i say to him total
[1:46:44] disaster
[1:46:46] amen
[1:46:47] because you must we are not here to
[1:46:49] impress people
[1:46:51] we are here to help people
[1:46:53] to find their position in christ
[1:46:55] to find a relationship i don't
[1:46:57] understand all the doctrine of william
[1:46:59] brennan but i have a father
[1:47:01] what is your doctrine i have a father
[1:47:06] he called me his own
[1:47:09] long before
[1:47:11] even time began do we believe that my
[1:47:15] life was in his hands
[1:47:20] so you see by the point you're not the
[1:47:21] only one who can sing
[1:47:26] so look this is a picture
[1:47:28] of of this is an unbeliever
[1:47:30] this is just uh how you call it uh
[1:47:34] a filmer of of animals
[1:47:39] i think it's on youtube or whatever but
[1:47:41] a boy gave it to me
[1:47:43] this is an eagle and a crow
[1:47:46] national geographic some of these film
[1:47:48] of national geographic so
[1:47:50] the the eagle
[1:47:52] uh he had a crow sitting on his back and
[1:47:55] that crow
[1:47:56] was
[1:47:58] attacking the eagle right
[1:48:00] on the neck
[1:48:02] and this is the report of the unbeliever
[1:48:05] he knows nothing about the message and
[1:48:06] eagles and so forth and he said this
[1:48:08] the eagle when he recognized there's an
[1:48:11] enemy right on his back he did nothing
[1:48:13] and the crow was just picking on the
[1:48:15] head
[1:48:16] but at a certain moment the eagle just
[1:48:18] started to rise
[1:48:21] goes up and up and up and up and the
[1:48:23] eagle knows one thing
[1:48:25] hey friend
[1:48:27] you better go
[1:48:28] or you explode
[1:48:31] you see
[1:48:32] he does he does not fight the enemy he
[1:48:34] just goes up in another dimension
[1:48:37] they say amen
[1:48:39] and he said okay sports friends okay you
[1:48:41] can try but uh are you still there
[1:48:47] [Applause]
[1:48:48] brother we have something
[1:48:50] this message gives us a vision
[1:48:54] this message is not law and order
[1:48:56] this message comes from our father
[1:48:59] this message shows who we are really
[1:49:02] this message makes makes us to stand up
[1:49:05] harley i always love that picture
[1:49:07] sometimes sometimes we are boxers and we
[1:49:09] and we get it
[1:49:11] and then and then you can
[1:49:15] one two three four five and we're just
[1:49:20] six
[1:49:23] seven
[1:49:24] eight
[1:49:25] nine
[1:49:26] ten and we're coming back
[1:49:28] brother to fall
[1:49:30] is human to stand up as godly
[1:49:34] you will find out if you're a family of
[1:49:35] god there's something in you that stands
[1:49:37] up
[1:49:38] it is not your capacity is god in you
[1:49:41] standing up
[1:49:42] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:49:44] once you find out who you are you can
[1:49:46] have patience with others
[1:49:48] you can even have patience with
[1:49:49] unbelievers because you say if god
[1:49:51] doesn't reveal what can the person do
[1:49:53] about that
[1:49:54] we understand we live by god's grace
[1:49:58] and we understand even growth is god's
[1:49:59] grace
[1:50:00] so we can we understand we have to have
[1:50:02] patience with the family of god because
[1:50:04] god has much patience with us
[1:50:07] we're not judgmental anymore
[1:50:09] it's not that we don't call sin sin
[1:50:10] that's fine but but we are not
[1:50:13] judgment about brothers sisters we just
[1:50:16] say lord have a way for them
[1:50:18] so that is the background for our sister
[1:50:20] esther thank you very much for the
[1:50:21] technicians
[1:50:23] so what happens is this
[1:50:26] and i'm finishing by that by the little
[1:50:27] drama
[1:50:29] so we cannot read the bible
[1:50:32] in a western
[1:50:33] in a western understanding
[1:50:36] but this king he was inviting all these
[1:50:39] girls for one night
[1:50:41] into his room
[1:50:43] what happened was clear they played card
[1:50:45] okay
[1:50:47] exactly so
[1:50:48] so this was for the for the for the for
[1:50:50] the teenagers and 40 okay
[1:50:53] right
[1:50:54] so when the night was over of playing
[1:50:57] memory
[1:50:59] he was just sending the girl away
[1:51:03] and he was just asking her if he wants
[1:51:05] to play memory again
[1:51:07] so he had a full a full house
[1:51:10] of girls
[1:51:12] and esther she was made ready and she
[1:51:15] came
[1:51:16] under the care
[1:51:17] of a great servant
[1:51:20] it is always a main servant introducing
[1:51:23] the bride to the bridegroom
[1:51:25] remember the story of ruth and boaz came
[1:51:28] who is that girl it was the servant
[1:51:30] explaining who the girl is
[1:51:31] remember eliezer presenting the bride to
[1:51:34] isaac
[1:51:35] it's always it's always a servant
[1:51:38] presenting the bridegroom to the right
[1:51:41] and she came under the care of the main
[1:51:44] servant
[1:51:46] and she asked nothing now one thing it
[1:51:48] was clear all these girls knew one thing
[1:51:50] that king
[1:51:52] he will marry one of us our girls one of
[1:51:54] us girls
[1:51:56] so they tried to make a
[1:51:59] individual feature
[1:52:02] special earrings special deals special
[1:52:05] so that the king will remind them so
[1:52:07] that they might become the right
[1:52:09] but esther did not ask for nothing
[1:52:12] only what hey guy told her
[1:52:16] now esther was a wise girl
[1:52:18] because she understood one thing if
[1:52:20] somebody knows the taste of the king
[1:52:22] then it's higa
[1:52:25] and we have to understand that brother
[1:52:27] there was nobody living as close
[1:52:30] to the king as our prophet
[1:52:34] and you say amen
[1:52:35] none of the prophets
[1:52:37] could live could see as as far as
[1:52:40] william branham
[1:52:41] moses could just see in the beginning
[1:52:44] john could say in the beginning was but
[1:52:46] this prophet brought us before the
[1:52:48] beginning
[1:52:49] a little white light comes out of him
[1:52:52] blessed be the name of the lord that
[1:52:54] means he he knew higa knew the taste
[1:52:59] amen
[1:53:00] i mean and brother branham knew the
[1:53:02] taste
[1:53:03] of christ for our age
[1:53:06] so it's good to take him as an example
[1:53:10] and
[1:53:10] whatever you honor god by many things
[1:53:14] i remember i know this is wednesday but
[1:53:17] just just let me let me let me but by
[1:53:19] many things we honor god
[1:53:22] so many things how brother branham
[1:53:23] handled things especially in the church
[1:53:25] look how he went when he goes to hunt
[1:53:27] look how he goes to church
[1:53:29] it wasn't it was a reflection of he felt
[1:53:33] that would that would be pleasing unto
[1:53:35] god
[1:53:36] so i can take him as an example without
[1:53:38] idolizing the men
[1:53:40] but what happened is
[1:53:42] that she was under his care
[1:53:45] and the bible says this esther was taken
[1:53:48] unto king ahaz
[1:53:51] into his royal
[1:53:53] in the tenth months which is the month
[1:53:56] tibet in the seventh year of the reign
[1:54:00] so esther came into the palace of the
[1:54:02] king on the tenth month of the seventh
[1:54:05] year
[1:54:06] here we have our prophet
[1:54:09] amen
[1:54:10] remember remember one thing
[1:54:14] there were three magicians or three
[1:54:17] astronomers and they saw the star and
[1:54:20] they were just following the star
[1:54:23] and that star
[1:54:25] led them to the king
[1:54:27] so the three astronomers didn't say oh
[1:54:29] this tremendous three stars in one line
[1:54:32] let's make a picture like let's make a
[1:54:34] doctrine of three stars in one line and
[1:54:36] we are the leaders of that new movement
[1:54:38] the three-star lion movement exactly we
[1:54:40] become the high priest of that whole
[1:54:42] that that star
[1:54:44] led them to a person to the king
[1:54:47] and and and they and they had every
[1:54:49] evening they had search service
[1:54:52] that's marcus okay they had family altar
[1:54:54] and they had a they had they were
[1:54:56] preaching to one another but they had
[1:54:58] nothing to say
[1:54:59] the only thing that they were preaching
[1:55:00] was we have seen the star
[1:55:04] be the name of the lord they had no
[1:55:06] doctrine but they have seen the star
[1:55:08] and look and we have seen the star
[1:55:12] the seventh star
[1:55:13] we have seen the star but this star did
[1:55:16] not lead us to branham tabernacle but
[1:55:18] led us to the king
[1:55:21] to the person
[1:55:22] can you say amen he did not lead us to
[1:55:24] himself it led us to the king
[1:55:27] therefore i'm in sunset mountain brother
[1:55:30] brahma said the son is the king of all
[1:55:33] lights he says shalom good morning
[1:55:36] church
[1:55:37] the night is over shalom
[1:55:40] who appeared the king
[1:55:42] the light blessed be the name of the
[1:55:44] lord so we are not branhamites
[1:55:47] we're not brandonites no but we are
[1:55:49] christians
[1:55:51] but we understand the bible
[1:55:53] so what happened is this
[1:55:56] is on the 10th months of the seventh
[1:55:58] year she now came to the was presented
[1:56:00] to the king
[1:56:01] amen
[1:56:02] so
[1:56:04] all these girls wanted to impress the
[1:56:06] king
[1:56:07] by
[1:56:09] something outstanding
[1:56:12] i just give this as an example because
[1:56:14] i'm lacking i like singing
[1:56:16] though brother brahm said only those who
[1:56:18] are gifted should sing so i find my
[1:56:21] i i found my limitation about it
[1:56:26] as an example
[1:56:28] a person say uh
[1:56:30] i i'm impressing god because i can sing
[1:56:34] then you see jimmy swaggart
[1:56:36] jesus
[1:56:39] [Music]
[1:56:40] sing it again brothers
[1:56:44] and it's wonderful if you can sing but
[1:56:45] god has angels who can sing better than
[1:56:47] us
[1:56:50] somebody says i'm you know i know the
[1:56:53] message
[1:56:54] and i have a lot of wisdom that's
[1:56:55] wonderful but god is the source of all
[1:56:57] wisdom
[1:56:58] who wants to impress god
[1:57:01] amen we only impress him in this loudly
[1:57:04] seen age with humble
[1:57:06] hearts serving the lord and if we sing
[1:57:09] or preach or whatever we do it for the
[1:57:11] glory of god
[1:57:14] amen but we cannot impress god with our
[1:57:16] human abilities
[1:57:18] we cannot mix them together but doing
[1:57:20] everything for its purpose and now here
[1:57:22] comes that little little little girl
[1:57:25] and brother brian said this she was not
[1:57:27] adorned with nothing
[1:57:29] because they thought the king is just
[1:57:31] looking for
[1:57:32] female attraction you understand what i
[1:57:34] want to say
[1:57:35] but she knew that king has character
[1:57:38] and brother raymond said this
[1:57:41] the story of esther
[1:57:43] jesus never mentioned it in the bible
[1:57:48] paul never mentions the story of esther
[1:57:51] martin luther said we should throw the
[1:57:53] book of esther into the river
[1:57:56] he he really thought it's not part of
[1:57:58] the bible and martin luther was asked
[1:58:00] the question why is the book of esther
[1:58:02] not mention the bible or why does it
[1:58:04] belong to the bible he said first it's
[1:58:06] to jewish
[1:58:08] second is a feminist book
[1:58:10] third the name of jehovah is not even
[1:58:12] mentioned in the whole book of esther so
[1:58:14] it has no place but here comes the
[1:58:17] seventh angel
[1:58:19] taking that whole story for after 2000
[1:58:21] years and preaches the marriage of the
[1:58:24] lamb
[1:58:24] [Applause]
[1:58:26] making sense to the story of esther
[1:58:28] because we are that esther
[1:58:31] and then brother brahm said this
[1:58:33] he said when esther came into the
[1:58:35] presence of that king he said she was
[1:58:38] just adorned with the holy spirit
[1:58:43] with the holy spirit not with knowledge
[1:58:45] about the seventh seal
[1:58:47] this is part of the holy spirit very
[1:58:49] important part but that's not all
[1:58:51] because you can have a very nice
[1:58:53] understanding and an arrogant spirit
[1:58:56] you can have a very modest appeal
[1:58:59] but a very bad character behind the
[1:59:01] moorish appeal a person said we are
[1:59:03] better than others because you know and
[1:59:05] we have longer discipline the muslims
[1:59:07] have longer hair than us
[1:59:09] that's not what is imp that's part of
[1:59:12] the gospel but that's not the center of
[1:59:13] the whole thing
[1:59:15] the center is a heart
[1:59:17] it's a character it's a love
[1:59:20] blessed be the name so when he came
[1:59:22] remember that king was king of 127
[1:59:25] countries
[1:59:26] esther had nothing to bring
[1:59:28] she was just a girl without father and
[1:59:30] her mother
[1:59:32] but when she came in and and brother
[1:59:34] brandon makes the drama he said when she
[1:59:36] came in the king was so impressed
[1:59:40] the only adoration that she had our or
[1:59:43] jewelry let me call it like this was the
[1:59:45] holy spirit
[1:59:47] and the king directly found out
[1:59:49] this girl
[1:59:50] is not a barbie
[1:59:54] this is not barbie i always tell the
[1:59:56] sisters if you want to make up yourself
[1:59:58] as barbie you get you get ken as husband
[2:00:03] if you want to have ken as harvard go
[2:00:05] but if you want to have somebody with
[2:00:07] value
[2:00:08] i mean be a woman of value
[2:00:10] and the bible says god puts together
[2:00:15] blessed be don't make yourself cheap
[2:00:17] please not
[2:00:18] don't make yourself be
[2:00:20] know who you are
[2:00:22] i'm a daughter of god
[2:00:24] i'm a son of god may i'm at home i'm
[2:00:26] just a janitor
[2:00:28] so while i'm preaching i'm looking if
[2:00:30] all the lights are fine the fire
[2:00:31] extinguishers everything is because it's
[2:00:33] part of my job but in me i'm a son of
[2:00:36] god
[2:00:37] no it means different this is just a
[2:00:39] tent in which i'm living but one day i
[2:00:42] would step out of it and go into my
[2:00:43] theophany
[2:00:45] and you do exactly the same
[2:00:47] so the king was so impressed
[2:00:49] amen we are not going into all these
[2:00:51] details
[2:00:52] but what happens is this
[2:00:55] when haman when haman was rised up
[2:00:58] remember haman and esther i know i've
[2:01:03] omitting all these things because i know
[2:01:05] the story is well known
[2:01:07] but
[2:01:09] haman and esther were both on the one
[2:01:12] roof
[2:01:14] and
[2:01:15] they were both blessed under king
[2:01:17] ahasberos and brother branham explains
[2:01:19] in the church book there is the two
[2:01:21] wines and they grow together and god
[2:01:24] lets to grow both
[2:01:25] god blesses both
[2:01:27] but the moments that haman tries to
[2:01:31] touch esther
[2:01:33] then the king comes on the planet so so
[2:01:36] so here we have the plan esther becomes
[2:01:39] an intercessor
[2:01:42] i don't mean brother bram didn't save
[2:01:44] anyone they're all safe by calvary
[2:01:48] i asked a brother i said brother uh we
[2:01:50] believe we believe the bride is the
[2:01:52] final voice for the final age all these
[2:01:53] things we believe all this but i said
[2:01:55] that somebody goes into federal prison
[2:01:57] he never was in the message he wasn't
[2:01:59] never was in a christian church so he
[2:02:01] reads the bible and is so impressed and
[2:02:03] he gives his heart to the lord he never
[2:02:04] read the message he doesn't know brother
[2:02:05] bran no it doesn't is he saved or not i
[2:02:07] said surely he saved
[2:02:10] on what basis on calvary
[2:02:12] on calvary if not we end up in a sect in
[2:02:15] a cult
[2:02:16] you have to have so much message to be
[2:02:17] saved i mean if you if you start by this
[2:02:19] you are back in the mormon church
[2:02:21] god help us okay
[2:02:23] so so so so we are intercessors but not
[2:02:26] in that thing as that
[2:02:28] as as if we we can make a connection to
[2:02:30] god but
[2:02:32] we help
[2:02:34] we go for our brother
[2:02:36] we go for our sister
[2:02:37] we are in the plan of god
[2:02:39] have you ever thought about this he was
[2:02:41] in a
[2:02:43] finish nearly i mean but i have i have
[2:02:45] no no notes i'm just saying why don't we
[2:02:47] from from from wikipedia but
[2:02:50] you see have i
[2:02:51] thought about this here is jesus coming
[2:02:53] to mary and martha
[2:02:55] and martha she was running to jesus and
[2:02:58] said if you would have been here lazarus
[2:03:00] would not even would not have beaten
[2:03:02] or died okay
[2:03:04] so she knows she stops mourning because
[2:03:07] he knows jesus is here
[2:03:09] at the same time maria was still
[2:03:12] mourning
[2:03:13] because she doesn't know that jesus is
[2:03:15] here
[2:03:16] so martha goes to maria and says the
[2:03:20] master calls you
[2:03:22] that's the story
[2:03:23] now who makes the calling
[2:03:25] jesus but who is the voice martyr
[2:03:30] you understand
[2:03:31] jesus calls today but who is his voice
[2:03:34] who are his hands who are his feet you
[2:03:37] it's the voice of god you are the voice
[2:03:39] of god
[2:03:42] amen
[2:03:43] amen
[2:03:44] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:03:46] therefore every father is the head of
[2:03:47] his own home
[2:03:48] every pastor is the head of his church
[2:03:51] every messenger is the head of a church
[2:03:52] age and christ is the head of all seven
[2:03:54] messengers therefore there will be
[2:03:56] another people
[2:03:58] who will be the final voice for the
[2:04:00] final age under their messenger yes
[2:04:03] that's what it is not with their own
[2:04:04] message
[2:04:06] under their messenger
[2:04:07] so what happens i mean
[2:04:11] i mean heyman wants to kill
[2:04:14] the jews and here's the plan she becomes
[2:04:16] an intercessor she's now before the
[2:04:18] throne and and and and she she is timely
[2:04:21] there that's what mordecai says now is
[2:04:24] is not right the right time that you
[2:04:25] came into this position
[2:04:27] and remember your life
[2:04:30] is a blessing to somebody who brother
[2:04:32] paul and we cannot reach
[2:04:35] you have a ministry
[2:04:37] your life is the ministry
[2:04:39] sometimes i think
[2:04:42] i see many things
[2:04:45] but brother brahm said you mothers you
[2:04:47] are the fifth gospel
[2:04:49] it's an honor to take care of the
[2:04:50] children you don't have to go in another
[2:04:52] country to say i'm a missionary you are
[2:04:54] a missionary in your own home
[2:04:57] and god honors this
[2:05:00] blessed be the name of the lord and you
[2:05:02] see hey
[2:05:03] he she invites haman next time the king
[2:05:06] is still in love
[2:05:07] it's not just sexual love no he loves
[2:05:10] that character
[2:05:11] you can reach the story of the of esther
[2:05:14] the king doesn't even touch the girl
[2:05:16] because she said the king didn't touch
[2:05:18] me for 30 days she was not she was not
[2:05:20] barbie this was different
[2:05:23] this was different
[2:05:24] i mean
[2:05:25] for him
[2:05:26] she had a lot of value okay
[2:05:29] so she invites him for the first time
[2:05:31] and the king leaves the throne and comes
[2:05:33] into the house of
[2:05:34] in the female palace
[2:05:37] and
[2:05:39] the king says
[2:05:40] half of my kingdom will be for you
[2:05:42] esther
[2:05:44] amen and esther says if you would come
[2:05:46] tomorrow again and i wondered myself i
[2:05:48] said esther why didn't you now react
[2:05:50] it's not possible now here's the
[2:05:52] situation hang him up and it's time to
[2:05:54] do something with haman
[2:05:57] but god doesn't make mistakes
[2:05:59] god doesn't
[2:06:01] because the next day he came again the
[2:06:03] king was human and the bible said in the
[2:06:05] night the king couldn't sleep
[2:06:08] in that night the king couldn't sleep
[2:06:10] and the book was brought unto him
[2:06:13] and the book was opened
[2:06:17] do you see between the first and the
[2:06:18] coming second coming of christ there's a
[2:06:20] book to be opened
[2:06:22] and here are the names right in
[2:06:24] and our names are right in it
[2:06:27] brother and said what a happy day for
[2:06:28] john when these seals were open and he
[2:06:30] saw himself
[2:06:31] or saw his name
[2:06:33] however you want to bring it and he said
[2:06:34] there is john i saw my name right in the
[2:06:36] book
[2:06:37] blessed be the name of the lord and the
[2:06:39] king was so thrilled about the jews and
[2:06:41] about mother cry so when esther said
[2:06:44] i mean marduk i want a haman wants to
[2:06:46] kill us the king was a hundred percent
[2:06:49] that was nitro and glitzerine coming
[2:06:51] together
[2:06:53] god doesn't make mistakes
[2:06:55] can you say amen
[2:06:57] so the family of god brother and sister
[2:06:59] this message that we believe is red bull
[2:07:03] this red bull if you need energy for
[2:07:04] your life this message
[2:07:07] is red bull
[2:07:08] it's different it's more than just i go
[2:07:10] to church i mean
[2:07:12] this message is our father talking to us
[2:07:15] you find yourself hey i'm ruth you find
[2:07:17] yourself i'm esther that's me that was
[2:07:20] my story do you do you see how esther
[2:07:22] from a little girl from a hillbilly a
[2:07:24] hillbilly girl now came into the
[2:07:26] position of a queen
[2:07:28] do you understand that god is not
[2:07:30] bringing us now always to a new birth
[2:07:32] that's fine for youngsters but god is
[2:07:35] now molding us
[2:07:37] to take over the throne
[2:07:40] so god sends problems and things and and
[2:07:42] he wants to see our reaction
[2:07:45] we ask for an easy life god calls for
[2:07:47] troubles
[2:07:49] because he says i want that character to
[2:07:51] be built in
[2:07:52] you can you see amen god brings problems
[2:07:55] even problematic brothers we want to
[2:07:58] shoot them on the moon god says i sent
[2:07:59] them again
[2:08:02] because he wants us to grow with all
[2:08:04] these problems
[2:08:05] because one day that's rapture will we
[2:08:08] don't believe in the rapture in in some
[2:08:09] kind of a uh denominational way the
[2:08:12] rapture will be just one step for us
[2:08:15] we are already in the brotherhood called
[2:08:16] it raptured condition
[2:08:18] this is already the preparation for
[2:08:20] everything we're in the cycle already
[2:08:23] can you say amen
[2:08:24] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:08:27] amen do you love the lord
[2:08:29] i mean what a father we have
[2:08:31] if the musician said fine if the
[2:08:32] musicians would come brother paul he
[2:08:34] said okay i mean if they would call and
[2:08:36] come and
[2:08:37] let me finish buddhis
[2:08:39] i may put everything aside
[2:08:42] hallelujah
[2:08:43] i mean what a father we have
[2:08:46] brother for me
[2:08:48] to preach the message is a great honor
[2:08:51] to live the message is a great honor
[2:08:53] to be part of that movement i'm not
[2:08:55] ashamed of my father we know in the
[2:08:58] framework of this message there's a lot
[2:09:00] of childish things
[2:09:02] we know this there's a lot of scandals
[2:09:03] there's nothing wrong about it look the
[2:09:05] first exodus and you will see the
[2:09:06] parallel and the third but you have to
[2:09:08] see the core of that whole thing
[2:09:11] i mean maybe you have the song i have a
[2:09:12] father
[2:09:13] a man and would be singing because this
[2:09:16] is brother mark is what is what is your
[2:09:18] doctrine amen as for me and my house we
[2:09:20] serve the lord that is my doctrine
[2:09:23] there was a brother between esther and
[2:09:25] that king there was a true love
[2:09:28] love is not a feeling
[2:09:30] love is more than butterflies
[2:09:32] love is his substance
[2:09:34] if brothers love one another you cannot
[2:09:37] let let him go
[2:09:38] you cannot
[2:09:40] you cannot make cold war and says okay
[2:09:42] let him do no there's something in you
[2:09:43] like you know
[2:09:46] and then say income do are you
[2:09:47] responsible for your brother and you say
[2:09:49] yes i'm responsible for my brother and
[2:09:51] for my sister i am

[2:09:55] who told god uh my brother my husband
[2:09:57] brother no no we're family do you agree
[2:10:00] with everything no i don't agree no not
[2:10:02] at all but my brother is my brother
[2:10:04] if he wants to list me that's fine if
[2:10:06] not i come back
[2:10:07] [Music]
[2:10:09] that's the way how god was dealing with
[2:10:11] us
[2:10:13] brother brandon one time and the
[2:10:14] finishing buddies
[2:10:17] really finishing
[2:10:18] [Music]
[2:10:20] he speaks about the gallant man
[2:10:23] of david
[2:10:25] i honestly say i don't say it because
[2:10:27] i'm here i believe our brother paul is
[2:10:29] one of these gallant soldiers
[2:10:31] gallant man and brother brain preaches
[2:10:33] in the message um
[2:10:36] there's a man who can turn on the light
[2:10:39] he speaks about this
[2:10:41] mighty man about david gallant man
[2:10:45] man of valor
[2:10:47] character
[2:10:49] man of
[2:10:51] caliber
[2:10:53] the prophet said the woman of sraptor
[2:10:55] had the same caliber like the prophet
[2:10:58] elijah
[2:10:59] that's what he says the same caliber
[2:11:03] that's family of god
[2:11:05] brother branham was our brother
[2:11:07] sometimes he would say branham said and
[2:11:09] brandon said he said hey that's my
[2:11:10] brother
[2:11:11] this is my brother
[2:11:12] i have another ministry but it's my
[2:11:14] brother it's part of my family
[2:11:16] therefore we cried all when we were
[2:11:19] reading his life story
[2:11:21] germans never cry only in football only
[2:11:23] in soccer
[2:11:24] germans only cry in soccer but when we
[2:11:26] were reading the story of brother we
[2:11:28] were crying
[2:11:29] because it was our story
[2:11:31] that was closer to our family story than
[2:11:33] our family story in the flesh
[2:11:36] and and these people there's so much
[2:11:39] love david love
[2:11:41] is is mortar
[2:11:43] love is is is substance between people
[2:11:48] i mean love is more than just okay let
[2:11:50] him go and david just said i would like
[2:11:53] to have a drink from the well
[2:11:57] injured in bethlehem
[2:11:59] and here's what brother blame said
[2:12:02] he said these men i mean they were
[2:12:04] fighters
[2:12:06] [Music]
[2:12:08] they were real fighters
[2:12:10] but when it comes to david they love the
[2:12:12] man so much
[2:12:14] brother brahm said this the least of his
[2:12:17] com least of his wishes were command for
[2:12:20] these men
[2:12:21] david didn't say you you you go i'm the
[2:12:24] king here you no no he just felt and
[2:12:26] these men said let's do it for our
[2:12:27] brother
[2:12:28] and for 14 miles
[2:12:31] two took the sword and one took the
[2:12:33] bucket at them
[2:12:34] [Music]
[2:12:38] amen
[2:12:39] and they came back
[2:12:41] and david was so touched by this
[2:12:44] amen and he poured it out to god he said
[2:12:47] i will not drink this
[2:12:49] this man this is the blood of this man
[2:12:52] you see how the water becomes blood even
[2:12:54] in the gospel
[2:12:56] i mean the bloody word becomes the word
[2:12:57] for the age
[2:12:59] amen this is the blood of this man
[2:13:02] and brother blame said this
[2:13:04] and you have to find out that is you
[2:13:07] brother blame said these men had a
[2:13:09] revelation that david will become king
[2:13:12] one day
[2:13:14] you are not interested what the world
[2:13:16] says about this message you know what it
[2:13:19] is
[2:13:20] [Music]
[2:13:22] amen
[2:13:24] and when david became king he remembered
[2:13:26] these mighty men
[2:13:29] and they came into their positions some
[2:13:31] over cities and some other countries
[2:13:33] brother when our king
