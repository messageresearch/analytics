might see an eye and see Christ living through is written epistles amen thank you praise the Lord well it's good to be here in Newfoundland and I guess you know I kind of identify a little bit with Newfoundland where that little poof poof bird or whatever his name is and you know I remember seeing him a long time ago and didn't realize it was him that I saw until they were explaining to me that I was talking to brother Paul he's a tall he he flies over to England or your back in a day and I thought man you know what a flyer you know and then and then brother Mark was talking to me and he says oh yeah he says you know his wings you know that's kind of his weakness but he's really good into water and I'm thinking this see now there's a problem here and he's a good flyer but his weakness is his wings and then and then somebody else was talking to might have been might have been brother Gerald can't remember but when he has problems taking off you know and then in my brain I could come back they was showing this little old burden he was he said now you what he does he's have a hard time taking off so he's got a run down here to the cliff and then he jumps off and kind of gets a kickstart and then he does good after that of course he has a little problem getting from the start to the cliff sometimes you know then and so you have this one little guy coming and he's he's really doing good and get ready to take off and all sunny boop blue and you don't quite make it and I guess that's kind of way I am preaching you know I I started out kind of slow trying to make it to the cliff you know and and you hope you don't stumble before you get there but once you get once you get in that flight then you're good you know so we may be slow starters but buddy once we get in there don't get in our way amen amen it's not it's not so much start in a race but it's it's finishing that race and one thing's for sure we didn't start this thing he started it in us so then he's going to be the one that finishes it amen may we give him the the perfect liberty in our hearts that we might that we might finish it in perfect faith I'd like to turn to the book of Saint Luke tonight just been having a really good fellowship with the brothers and just find it that over here and in this island at the ending and beginning of the world you know everything is first but it might be you know the first is last on the last is first we don't know how this thing's going to turn out and but I've been having some real good fellowship and just enjoy the humor that's here you know it just you get really kind of tensed up especially if you're coming to a place for the first time you don't know you kind of anxious a little bit and I always you always when you come to a place you know especially the first time you're a stranger but you know you know by the grace of God by the time you leave you're gonna be you're gonna be a friend and you're gonna have friends and that's what we want we want friends true friends friends that have the Holy Spirit that we can differ with that we can get upset with and still know that we're locked together in our hearts and we're here we're here to help one another and that others might be able to depend on us I've got some brothers that I consider to be close friends very close friends may not talk to him in a year but I know if I ever need somebody they're there and you know it's not how often you talk to somebody it's how it's how dependable they are that's what counts and I believe that that God in our heart were we're the most dependable people or is in the world we may not be on time we might be late we might be early and all those things but but you know he he is integrity of our hearts and and he is there our strength so in st. Luke chapter 17 I've tried to stay within the bounds of the of the Newfie Bible and won't go beyond that to the American Bible too well for example like 2nd Peter of the 6th chapter I realize you although you don't have that in your Bible so I'm gonna try to stay with him you know you got your own encyclopedia you got your own dictionary but I know you don't have your own Bible if you do there's no sense of me staying here I might as well go on because we got to have an absolute so I try to stay within the bounds of this of this book that's been given to us by God and not not get too far away from it in st. Luke chapter 17 and verse 26 and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the Son of Man did he'd eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they builded but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even dust shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed may we bow our heads Heavenly Father and Lord we thank you for your mercy and grace this evening and for your your precious people Lord that's hearing this and as part of our civilization part of the earth Lord that you created to be inhabited and Lord I find them to be jewels you know and precious and and and just a real clean hearted people and I pray that you bless them father may you you bless our coming together tonight and may you bless the region of your word may you bless each one I ask in Jesus Christ's name hey hey man you may be seated so tonight we'd like to to talk a little bit if we can on Enoch and there's probably not too much that I can that I can preach on that you haven't already heard through the ministry that's here through the more I talk with brother Jarrell and listen to him talking and with your other brothers I realize the depth of the word that that the Lord has brought brother Gerald and this assembly and and there's fine that as I listened to him there's many similarities in our lives and the way we look at things and and I know there's something very similar in all of our lives and that's and that's the new birth and being called out of the world by by the shadow of the Lord and we are we're jewels were a peculiar people now peculiar is not so much like something that's an oddity but that word peculiar refers to like a ruby or a diamond or a precious stone that we're talking about something that's rare you don't it is really very peculiar to find just a diamond or a ruby land out on the ground somewhere you have to dig for it you have to a mind for it you have to hunt for it to to be able to come to it it's peculiars jewel it's precious and so when he calls us with precious our peculiar people's not because we're different or because we're funny but to him we've been purchased by his own that makes you very very precious because that means that you're more precious to him than his own blood you know I can I remember there was a time you know you you might carry a coin or a dollar bill a $2 bill you know they were kind of an oddity in America there for a while and you'd keep that thing for a souvenir but but you know one day maybe you want a cup of coffee and you reached in you said and gotten the coins and you pulled out your wallet oh man the only thing I got is a $2 bill what am I gonna do I know what I'm gonna do here I'd like a cup of coffee because that cup of coffee all it became more important to you than that then that $2 bill and you know coins are the same way people collect coins and then they get in a financial situation and they go sell things and they say you know this thing's worth $100 nicer I'll give you 25 you'd say well I'll take it you know and because of the need that you have and so then for God in Christ to shed his own blood for you on ion we are the purchase of his blood that makes you more valuable than than the blood within itself because it was shed to purchase you so then you're very precious people and and you're you're the apple of God's eye and that means that you're the center of his is I you're the center of his attention that's what the apple of his eye means not just a precious fruit but the center of his a his traction his eyes on you if a sparrow would fall to the earth and God would not be there then how much more precious are you than than a sparrow and and he he knows your needs he knows the questions it's on your hearts he knows the proper exit for pricks for prep LexA t that you stand looking at like there's things and it seems like every answer creates a problem but but he has the answer he has the way and may he provide that through his word so one thing I notice here that that in my Bible it breaks up even the chapters like it starts out here in chapter 17 it says Christ teaches of offenses and then in in verse 11 here this 17 chapters that Christ cleanses 10 lepers and it kind of this Bible that I have kind of changes it or puts topical the headings over these and so it's kind of nice you know like if you have a parable it'll say parable of rich ruler so when it gets down here to verse 20 I find that it's separated it from verse 20 all the way to 37 and in verse 22 25 when you go home and read it I was referring to it last night I believe this is where the Pharisees come in a demand want to know when the Kingdom of Heaven or the kingdom of God is coming and so the subject is the kingdom of God and so Jesus says well he says it doesn't come with observation and easy and he goes on to talk and he says the kingdom of God is within you it's right here in your midst and it's within within the individual so he was the kingdom of God he was the word made flesh he was that word that they were looking for to come and he says it just doesn't come with the natural wisdom and understanding and knowledge it doesn't come with observation you can't find it with binoculars you you know and then he says but the Son of man must suffer many things and so the kingdom of God had to suffer many things because he was that word and he was rejected so the kingdom of God was rejected in his day because he was the Word made flesh he came to his own and his own received him not and the darkness couldn't perceive it couldn't graphed it couldn't understand the light because light was opposed to darkness and darkness it's carnality even religious carnality and that means the natural mind and the natural mind is in the enmity with God because it can't receive the things of God because the things are God's by faith in our five senses we we live off of that's real the things that we can touch the things that we can understand and when it goes beyond that that's where faith comes in so the whole topic is here now in these verses from verse 20 down to 37 is the kingdom of God so then we have the kingdom of God that was in the in the days of Noah we had the kingdom of God that was in the days of lot and that was God's Word being fulfilled and how it was rejected just like it was rejected in two days of Christ and he comes down he says because you've not recognized your day of visitation he said there was a time you could have seen these things but now the time is past you can't see them so no matter how they sought from that time on they could never understand perceive a find the kingdom of God and because that they had rejected it because they didn't recognize the kingdom that they were looking for and the kingdom that they're looking for today is the Lord shall descend with a shout with the voice of an archangel at the last Trump the dead shall rise because that's the promise for us and they might come up in say halt well you believe that brother Browne is a prophet right and you say that shouts already started will tell me when is the resurrection when's the Raptors going to come they demanded to know when the kingdom was coming I don't know my father knows but I don't know it's not for me to know it's not for you to know but you better be ready when it comes that's what you need to do that's your that's your portion it's not for us to know the day or the hour at the time if I knew it was thirty days from now but yet it was appointed for me to ten days from now what good would it know that 30 days from now so each moment each day is a rapture rapture facing the rapture for you and I because resurrection is rapture because the word rapture when you go into American we're talking rapture we're talking translation but I go over to Europe I go over to Norway and I say rapture they're talking about a resurrection and they're talking about body change and that word is inclusive to them so the rapture is just not a translation it can't take place until the resurrection comes and then the translation comes so then the rapture really is all-inclusive of all the things that to take place and concluding in the catching up and meeting them in the air it's all inclusive of that but usually when we say rapture or I do mentally I'm thinking body change I'm not really thinking so much resurrection and yet I acknowledge that so they were looking for this kingdom and in the days of Noah and in the days of lot there was a rejection and in the days of Jesus Christ he said because you've not recognized your day in other words because you've rejected that which has come to you not one stone will be standing upon another so they're absolute the thing that they did was their typos his temple that God no longer dwelt in there but they claimed he dwelt in there it was to be tore down and there was to be no absolute as far as their religion left anymore and that's why Paul was so fervent with the Hebrews they were in danger of falling back into the temple worship they were going back into this world or comfort zone because of persecution they wanted something they could touch speak in tongues have this divine healing have a goose bumper cried just to know I'm in the will of God or something like that they they wanted to go back to the the temple worship to their comfort zone to find something and Paul knew that that world was fixing to be tore apart can you imagine falling away from a temple that nobody has access to except through the blood of Jesus Christ and we go back to a to an altar that anybody can have accent can break in there and touch it they broke in there and they desecrated it they broke in there and put blood and worship there was good and bad everybody had access to that thing but it was fixing to be tore down and what this denominational world has put an absolute in it's going to be tore down and burned and those that are falling away and going back as the Hebrews Paul said all he said don't do that because he knew that that that prophecy of that young prophet it had to come to pass and they say when Titus was coming down and he brought his forces down there was a group of Christians and in there they had kept alive this prophecy that there would not be one stone left another it was part of Paul's ministry a part of Peters ministry it was a prophecy that was was held in the church and talked to the church especially there in Jerusalem and they say according to history that when when Titus was coming down there was a group of Christians that fled Jerusalem because they remembered the prophecy of that prophet Jesus Christ and they recognized that the conquer the enemy was coming down to surround that temple surround Jerusalem and labor laid it waste but there was a group that remembered and Paul knew that this time was at hand he said as you see this day not necessarily talking about about the rapture because the subject here is falling back into that wall glare of another age after coming into the light of this age and that age was fixing to be destroyed back there and this was fixing to go on with God he said don't fall back and as you see that day Oh assemble yourselves even the more often as you see what evidence of the revelation of the rapture within an individual's heart is that there becomes a desperation to gather together two more off as you see that day so gathering is associated or linked together with the revelation of the rapture so these people that well I don't feel like going to church today there's something wrong with their inner vision because in there as we see that as we see that day coming close to a translation for the living there's there's a hunger within us like a woman that we talked about a woman pregnant and they're saying that she's hungry and for now if I'm coming to the threshold of the time into eternity if I'm coming to a body change then there's something in me down in this soul that's calling for that which is required to take that and it begins to hunger and thirst and the only place that we'll find it is in God's Word and so we assemble together not just for fellowship into strengthen one another but for the manna and Moses didn't bring that mana he said I am the manna how could he be the manna because the manna was the embodiment of nutrition for human life every bit of calcium every bit of phosphorous everything that you needed every mineral every vitamin everything that the human body needed for her immune system everything was in that manner it was the embodiment of the nutrition for human life and they could live off of that they fed off it there was no disease there was nothing he was the perfect food and it was prepared in heaven it wasn't accumulated down here on earth and given to the people God made it created it and put it together with elements whatever it was and have and Jesus Christ was the embodiment of eternal life that's how he was that manner because he had to give his life for you to have eternal life and outside of him there is no redemption there is no way to to heaven there's no approach to God except through Christ he was the embodiment of eternal life and he came back in the gospel and to take that gospel and to eat it and to be quickened by the Holy Spirit is life itself and he's still at manna I'm not the man huh you're not the manna there's Bibles not the manna but that word inspired by God becomes an Anna this might come manna for the human intellect it might become manna for a religious spirit but it's not true manna until it's inspired by God himself and you can't force God to inspire it you can't make him you can't fast you can't say I'm gonna jump off this cliff if you don't reveal something to me you can't force anything from God you can't beg it from God but you walk with God and as you walk with God he unfolds his truth to you as you have need so in here I find that we I thought it always in my life I thought well what a paradox because in here we have Noah and we have lot and that's what the days are signified by at the time of judgment because Abraham wasn't present down there in Sodom but lot was and Enoch was already gone but Noah was there and yet we find the key figures for you and I and our identity as the is the two that's not mentioned Abraham and Enoch they were both the type of the very elect and yet they're a mystery element of this time they're sealed in here in a mystery a prophet comes and he says Abraham he said God visited him in human flesh and where did he see that same sign in the end time lot never received that sign but it was to the very elect right before the body change you don't find that in here in st. Luke but yet it's there it's hidden in there in sealed in these scriptures Abraham was the very elect you and I are the very elect and yet we find that there was lot which was a type of the foolish virgin in the way that we were looking at it and how that he received a righteousness from Abraham through the message of the testimony of Abraham and so now we have we have Enoch and Enoch I don't even like to say that Enoch is a type of the raptured Saints because David was a type of Christ and Joseph was a type of Christ those portions of their lives but Enoch was was translated he wasn't a type of a translation he was actually translated so we are identified with Enoch he identifies the end times Saints at the time of the translation he was not a type of the church that died and gave their life for Christ down through the church ages he's not a type of the resurrected he is a type of those that's to be translated and we are directly tied to his life and all the types with it 7 throne Adam 7th church age so because it were so closely tied to him he is a pre figure of the other of the bride at the evening time not a type he's more than the tide because he was he was actually translated he was a man and he lived a life and you know that life that he lived was a direct reflection of the life that you're gonna live what made Enoch Enoch and what him brought what brought him to a translation is the same thing that's going to bring us to the translation so he's more than the tie he's more than a type so let's go back now and and we want to talk about Enoch and what we want to do tonight and then tomorrow morning if we can and I want to take anything and just kind of look at him and and I know by talking with brother Gerald you probably have heard most of all this but maybe it's a refreshing but I want to take Inuk and I want a time to know because know is the type of the foolish virgin and we know that brother Branham said the third pull he said it will be to the totally lost but it will be for the bride and the church because I quoted a law at at times I'd say well it was to the totally lost and for the bride now I was talking to brother Lonnie one day and he said and the church I said in the church yeah so I went back and I looked at it and sure enough that's what it says so the church is not the bride but it's not the church it's not the great and it's not the daughters it can only be the foolish virgin the church the righteous that are to be purged out during that Tribulation Period so then all rip represents to us the foolish virgin and I want to take these ministries and so the Association in there even though we might know it but to show that Lincoln there and how it also can reveal something to us in this evening time of the association because the bride is the last voice the last age you know there's not going to be another messenger and there's not going to be another voice to this age she's the final voice to the final age and I want to take and I want to show the association between Enoch and the foolish and between the bride and the foolish and to look at it back here as it was in these days so let's go back if we will and just start with with Genesis and and I just just to make a a footnote from from last night that in in justification I just wanted to make one thing clear I said that that justification is not a divine work but a divine verdict because justification only deals with your legal status as it was before before God but we find that in in justification that justification does not doesn't does not bring a moral change there's no work in you that's done it doesn't change anything in you it changes your status before God so even though that you stand innocent before God then the thing that made you do it is still there your moral nature has not been touched you justified but the thing that made you do those things that's still there so some can lay so heavy on justification that they forget it never touched the moral it never touched the man it doesn't touch it's not a work of God it's a divine verdict and that verdict is based upon your faith and that faith has to be in Jesus Christ and so he doesn't give us a pardon he justifies us through Christ because Christ has paid the debt for us and we're not we're not imputed righteousness it was imputed to Abraham but in the scriptures it says we become the righteousness of God in Christ but so there's a deeper work that's been done with you and I through the blood of Christ because they didn't have blood but they were still righteous before God and they were justified but their moral character was never dealt with so we find it under sanctification we have a divine work because his brother Brandon preached it in the future home he says that old snake he used that snake as a symbol he says thank our justification takes this away now we stand before God innocent but that serpent that snake that nature that calls you to do it is still there so under the work of the operation of God the scripture says through a spiritual circumcision that that dead flesh that serpent is taken away by the operation of God now you stand justified and sanctified and we know that we can be justified without being sanctified and we can be justified and sanctified without the Holy Ghost but I can't get the Holy Ghost without being justified and I can't get it without being sanctified and I can't be sanctified until I'm first justified so justification is not a divine work it's a divine verdict where you stand before God innocent but sanctification is a divine work and the baptism of the Holy Spirit is a divine is a divine seal it's a divine event that seals at it in other words the way it seals it he used it as an expression to the a woman's womb that once it she's impregnated and that child is conceived she cannot be impregnated during that pregnancy and so when the Holy Spirit comes in there and brings life to that there's no other life can come into that what you're born into this world you're born de or human being a personality you're complete you can be afflicted in the influencing and more than things but as a human being your unit and when we're born again that's what seals us were now the sons of God and that cannot change we're sealed so it's that's ours our starting point in life to understand these things understanding them does not bring them to pass in your life but it gives you understanding of what's taking place in your life you can look back and said that's why that's why and then to recognize who you are in Christ you know what your position in Christ is if he's and one said in heavenly places and brother Brent said you know what heavenly places this he's the Dutch your position in Christ and in fusion too he says he says when he when he resurrected what'd he do he sat down at all you're tired now we know he wasn't tired oh I know what he did he was taking his royal position beside his daddy he sat there on that throne no any what he did what was so significant about him sitting down because of the Old Testament under the feast days no priest could sitting on because the job was never finished offered sacrifice offered sacrifice again offer sacrifice clean the Hulk or clean this do that do this there was no rest there was no completion even for the worshiper all he could do was wait and intense anticipation for the next shedding of the blood the next day of atonement for the purging of all sins that he didn't even know that he committed what if I did something how do you know what it is so he waited for that day of atonement and the Catholic just tried to duplicate that you know what they have they have what they call a Jubilee door I don't know if anybody's seen it but I remember it was one time at Christmas and I don't know what year it was and I saw this and I didn't really know what was taking place at the time but they got this door over in the Vatican and it's all bricked up I don't know work that I don't know if it's in st. Peter's Basilica or where it was hat but Basilica but it's just during it and they brick it all up so once they call it a Jubilee door so every 50 years they come and and and the priest they they take all the bricks down and there's this door and then the Pope he he takes his his scepter there he comes up to the door and he goes and he steps back and they open the door now the significance of that is that whoever walks through that door all your sins all your time in purgatory everything the expiation of all sin and so humans are humble you know now they open it every 25 years because of his concern for the people and so as you approach the door then of course somebody's holding their offering plate so you go through this door after you do your duty here whatever it might be I don't know if they have an amount or what it is you walk through that and your sins are forgiven but then the first thing you do wrong you're right back in jail again so the only hope you have is to wait for the next day they open up that Jubilee door but he the expiation of all sinned he died once and for all for eternal redemption for all sin sins you did sins that you're doing sins that you're gonna do tomorrow all sin so when he resurrected and he went over there and he sat down he's the only high priest that ever sat down during the administration because it was a finished work and Ephesians 2 our position in in heavenly places he has made you to sit with him so then some of us have never sat down with him yet we're not in our position in heaven and we're not going to sit here like a royal queen with some scepter ruling the kingdom with him or in his vacancy but it's signified that we have accepted what God has done for us in Christ and were at rest our position in heavenly places with Christ is in perfect rest now we can serve Him because we're not working for him he is in us and we're in him but I just wanted to add that to last night in Genesis now we're going to go to Genesis 5 and in verse 21 and we're going to read about a little bit about Enoch here verse chapter 5 of Genesis and verse 21 and in Eclipse sixty and five years and begat methuselah an Inuk walked with God and he begat methuselah three hundred years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty and five years an in aquatic him so that's what we have now the first thing we notice is that Enoch for 65 years of his life he didn't walk with God because it said he was 65 years old and after he begat Methuselah he walked with God now there's only two people in the Bible in the Old Testament that the Bible ever said that walk with God in it nor there was kings that walked after God or in the way of God and Abraham walked before God but nobody in the Old Testament was spoken to walk with God outside of Enoch and Noah now the Bible says how can two walk together unless they be agreed and as we were saying last night when I go up here to two to Genesis five and I begin reading at the beginning it says Abel was created in the image of God and the likeness of God he was created and he bear forth his son in his own image said so we find that all man was born in are conceived in sin shapen in iniquity didn't come forth from his mother's womb speaking lies because now we're we're under a fallen nature we're not sons of God the seed is in us but the manifestation is the manifestation of fallen father because he could only bring forth children in his own image and so he brought forth children not in the image of God because he had lost the power of the spoken word so he could only bring them through a human natural relationship in the same way that animals and animals don't have a soul animals are controlled by their senses by reasoning by memory they can be trained they can be taught and so when we come into the world instead of the soul being dominant in our lives like it was with Christ the Spirit is dominant and it puts the soul there's an unbelieving nature that's permitted by nature the way that we come into the world if we'd been spoken like Christ we'd have come into the world and the soul that gene that come from God would be dominant and it would be controlling us even in the self Willy would control that self will and bring it under the will of God by nature not by subjection not because it had to under the law but because there was a greater power in a control room that that controlled him so we know that Enoch anybody we talked about in the Bible when he was born he was separated from God because you and I were separated from God we were dead in our sins and trespasses so Enoch because we're speaking of him he was dead in his sins and trespasses and he didn't walk with God for for five year or 65 years so now all of a sudden after he has a baby now he's walking with God so what happened something had to happen in between his 65 and 66 years that when he had this child now he's walking with God so he had to be reconciled to God he had to come into position of justification and righteousness to be able to walk with God and that's why we were back rounding this because now in order for Enoch to walk with God he had to have a revelation because it's faith that justifies us and it God has to reveal something to us so we know that that Enoch according to the scriptures that we're going to read that he had faith but wait a minute I cannot have faith without God supplying me a word and why was a nickname endowed from among the pure lineage because these are all the lineage of the firstborn that doesn't say sons and daughters sons and daughters they don't tell us about that he said and the sons of God they looked upon the daughters of men I don't believe that it was his firstborn lineage I believe it laid within the sons and daughters that was begotten by them because here we have a pure lineage coming down recorded by God that Seth begat eNOS and eNOS and on down so we know that when eNOS was born something taken place that was different than when Seth was born because Seth was born and he was a seed that was appointed by God instead of Abel but now eNOS is born and man begins to call on the name of the Lord so it wasn't it wasn't wild just Adam and it wasn't wow while Seth but something transpired when eNOS come for so we know to call upon God we would say they went back to the alternate offering of the sacrifice of blood because that was what was given to them through Abel by revelation so they went back to calling on the name of God which the name of God is the word of God revealed or the presence of God because in in Deuteronomy and in chapter 16 it says and you'll come before me three times a year in the Feast of Unleavened the feast of Pentecost and the feast of tabernacles and you won't come into because if you walk with me I'm gonna bless you and if you come empty it's because you kept it to yourself and you not brought forth the offerings of God recognizing that he's the one that gave it to you you know when when when Abraham when Melchizedek come and when Mackenzie said and God hath delivered the enemy into thy hand he knew the victory wasn't won by him it was won by God he didn't win it it was what God inspired and was with him in that battle and the spoils of the battle was not his earnings it wasn't what he got it was what God used to redeem him he redeemed those things and recognizing that he was not only the Most High but he was the one that gave him victory he gave a tenth of that back to God expressing the revelation that he believed that God gave him that that battle and when a man refuses to pay tithe he's refusing to acknowledge he's the Most High and he's the one that's given you the ability to have the have their earnings for your family you're you're declaring like like knit like at never can answer I have achieved this through my efforts in this job I got this money I deserve this money but Abraham said it's truth God gave me that victory I give this as a recognition tithing is only a recognition but never Knesset says I have created this great kingdom and the time it comes from his mouth he went back into a beast nature the words deeper than what you think so at the time of Enoch we know that man is calling on God oh what I was going to say in Deuteronomy he says but you won't bring your sacrifices everywhere not at all the gates that God gives you oh I was reading that I said not at all the gates that God gives you so then God must have given more than one gate God gave them gates plural and he said not at every gate but at the gate where I placed my name where was the first place that God put his name it was the tabernacle of Moses and you didn't walk up and say I am that I am they didn't say Jehovah lives here how do you know that's where his name was because his name is the manifestation of his word or the manifestation the Shekinah glory on earth which means the manifestation of deity and that pillar of fire came down and he placed his name there because his name is his manifested presence he covers all time and space we breathe we live in him the sinner lives in his presence but his manifested presence is what makes the difference and he gave him that gate the first gate that he gave him was the Garden of Eden because he met man he talked with man that was the holiest of Holies that was the center of Adam's Kingdom that's where his throne was and that's where God met him but he moved from that gate and then he moved from that gate to the Temple of Solomon and that gate was taken down so only only where he places his name that's where you bring your offering was that the gate where he placed his name so they were calling on the name of God but there was no response they called on him but there was no presence of God now it's interesting that in here when I was I never was much to look at lineages and things but I was I was noticing in here that that in this in this period of time let me see if I get this thing to work right I'm kind of afraid of this thing but but in here that Adam Enoch was 300 and yet eight years old when Adam died in equals three hundred and eight years old man Adam died so that means Adam was alive talking on the earth three hundred and eight years while Inuk was alive Methuselah was two hundred and forty-three years old when Adam died and the limit was 56 years old when Adam died you say whoa so what what what what significance is that and the significance is this that Adam was given a testimony if you if you look at I want to take this kind of slow until I get in where I want to be if you look in Chapter five of Genesis in in verse 29 the limit he has a son and it says limit and he called his name Noah and that in that word and that word means rest saying this same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands because of the ground which the Lord has cursed now how did lemak how did lemon know that the ground was cursed there was only two people that knew it was cursed and that was Adam and Eve so that means that Adam and Eve when they came out there were some verbal relationship of what taking place in the garden and he heard the testimony of Adam and he heard that how that God cursed the earth but somehow God is revealed to limit an insight into the Ministry of of Noah that in Lois ministry he's going to give them rest concerning this curse in the labor of their hands so he names him rest and we find it when Noah comes out of the ark God comes and speaks to him he said I will no longer curse the earth for your sake so then the curse was lifted now limit being prophetically named his son rest because of the toll and the labor and because the land was cursed and through Noah because the earth was justified under the flood of Noah then that curse was lifted and he said I'm no longer curse the earth so now we can see that there's a verbal or a testimonial relationship so they're coming together to call on the name of God or are worshipping Him so now Enoch and remember Enoch is a type of you and not really a type but I just say that just so he has 308 years that he's listening he's listening to Adam and you know I'm sure that after so many years that his testing onie you know people got tired of hearing that the church you know like one brother said maybe he'd going in the coffee shop and and there'd be some other brothers sitting with him and he'd start talking about oh I can remember back in those days you know how we walked walk with God and they said yeah well listen I've got to go at him you know I didn't heard this story before so he was he was he was talking about back there in those days you know as we read about back in the days of the book of Acts and some says well you know I don't ever be like that yeah well that's all right Adam but you know God's present don't come among us in the church anymore you know we pray and we worship and we offer up the offerings and and you know that's what God requires of us as to worship Him you know that's what Abel did that's what we're doing he said but you know there was a time that used to come down and and talk with us I remember back in Pentecost when we used to meet in to brush our burs in the presence of God oh yeah but do you know those days are past now we we've got the opening of the word you know and we we you know we've got the reality now that's fine and you know I can remember back in the meat into a brother Brent oh yeah I've heard that but now we're we're in the opening of the seals I read in here where Peter was just walking and then his shadows people was healed and you know the Bible Jesus said to work than I do you'll do and it was there oh yeah you know that was that's a long time ago well I got to go ahead am i I see you but you know there was something different about Enoch because there was a seed down in here I guess he would have been a little bit like the Queen of Sheba then she went to church she had a priest oh and he would tell her all about God and how good god was and he said you know God just loves you to give all friends and and we feed him this bread and we pour milk over this stone and you know all the things that pagans doing she's at all he's just a wonderful God he she said but you know in her there was a seed so she said old priest could you arrange some way that I could talk with him oh no no only the priest can do that you you you can't now if you have some questions I can ask him for you or if you have something you'd like to tell him that I can tell him for you oh yes well great priest would you tell him I just wondering about this and and maybe she had a child he was sick could could you ask him to heal you know and she just longed to talk to him so she just you know it's like talking through a translator you just want to sit down with people and talk to him heart to heart and when you talk to him you you can be this close but talking to a translator it's not it's not communicating like you want to communicate you know and she you know she was satisfied that this was all that there was you know and so she was content but I guess she was like Adam when he walked around he looked at everything and he said well how's it look everything's perfect he's what's wrong at him I don't know him but everything's perfect and so she said oh yes great high priest everything is just good he said what's wrong oh I don't know so one day the caravans come through and they come in offering all the jewels and bringing it up to her throne and and then she hears she hears him talking about the meetings they'd been up up there and in Jerusalem oh man she thought the presence of God you mean wait a minute wait a minute you mean the presence of God with oh yes we were there Queen oh my it the presence of God come down and here was Solomon and he was just oh my there was nothing that could stand before him but what wasn't revealed to him it was a very presence of God and oh my something just oh if I could just I could just get into his presence but so she goes to her pastor and says pastor you know I love you and I'm not leaving the church and but they're having some meetings up in Jerusalem could I please go well you know clean you know God would be displeased with you if you go and you know I'm not afraid for you to go but but perhaps if you went the camel might stumble and you might fall and break your neck because God would be displeased freeze you going to those meeting but we love you clean oh I love you great pastor but but you know I just I just feel like I've got to take this journey and go to church if you do God will judge you because if you leave here you're leaving the very presence of of God the great deity you know what I mean and she said well they're just a longing in my heart and I've just got to go great priest and I love you and so she saddled up and and took off you know I guess it was a little bit like Joe when he said if I just if I knew where he was if I knew where his seat was if I knew where throne was now she'd been given a direction and she'd be given some testimony and she went up there and you know after the revelation after God gave Joel the revelation of the question that was in his heart then he he met him he said gird up your loins and and he spoke to him through a whirlwind so he got his you know he'll meet with you if you really want a conference with him and if yours isn't sir in your heart desired you know he'll meet with you and she went up there to Jerusalem and so she was gonna test the preacher out a little bit you know they say because she didn't want to be fooled she wanted something that was real and she said you know King Solomon I've heard that God is with you and I I believe that inside I think you know I've got some questions I'd like to ask you I got some Bible questions here and what's this about water baptism what's this about serpent seed well you know you've got a child at home that's sick and you're wanting the healing for that child he not only answered all her questions he said and he told me everything that was in my heart and soul so it was with David you go over to the Psalms David said he just loved God and you know he loved the presence of God because he had experienced the presence of God Saul never did God had the knowledge of God and he experienced the anointing of God and he prophesied with the prophets but he never met with God he sought he sought the Word of God through the prophets and he went to the he went to the temple of Moses or the tabernacle of Moses and he offered up sacrifices but we don't know of any time that he had an actual visitation from God but David when he was a young man he said God delivered that bear into my hands God delivered that line into my hands he knew the presence of God and once a man has ever experienced that presence brother Branson once you ever drink from that artesian well you'll never go back to that cistern and David knew the presence of God and he said he was trying to express some way to tell how much that he loved God and he you know like we might say oh I give my right arm if I can have a car like that now we don't want nobody cut off arm but we're trying to think of something in our desperation to express how much we want something and David was thinking he thought I see how can i express my love for God and not not not just God but but the God is a person a relationship in it and a communication or a living relationship and he knew what the rest of the church they were satisfied with just going to the house you know some people might be satisfied to go to your house and they say ha that's where brother Gerald is what a wonderful thing wasn't that nice that's where he lived but there are those that would come and say is he home I want to talk to him I don't want to look at his house I don't want to look at the windows in his car I want to talk to him I don't want to wear his suit I want to talk to him and David said brother Brown said to him being a hunter he knew the relationship that when those hounds are that that hunter and wounded that deer it was bleeding and in that sense of that animal it new and desperation it had to get to that stream to hide its tracks and to drink that cool water to help coagulate that blood and give it new strength to escape the hounds of hell and he said oh what a desperation that deer was in he said o my soul thirst three on and I like the way the Scriptures written and it's written perfect he said my soul thirsts for God a living God he not not God up there in the cloud our God in the preacher God in the pulpit our God in his anointing on the Church of the Assembly but God my God that I can sit with him talk Abraham talk with him David talked with him many talked with him and I'm a child I want to talk with him Joe wanted to talk with him the Queen of Sheba wanted to talk with him he said my soul thirsts for God he said I go to I do go to the house of God the temple and I go and I worship Him with all the other worshipers and I go to church I go to his house I offer up the sacrifices of the day of Pentecost or whatever day it is Passover but when I come back why is there tears in my eyes all that I might come into his presence that I might come to his face but I might come to his presence he wasn't satisfied with knowing about him or just going to his house he wanted he wanted an fellowship he's that he's he's a God of my life he says my life is God God of my life the next films he said send my light and my truth so I can preach a good sermon no send thy light and thy truth that it might lead me to thy Tabernacles to his presence that I might worship that I might take up the instruments and I might worship and testify to the sinner into the law the God of my strength the woman at the well you know what her problem was her problem was not lust her problem was not sex her problem was she was hungry for God because then her was a seed so I said you know in my early life there is a seed in me and it hungered and it thirsted for God but the problem was is my spirit misinterpreted the voice of the soul and it says you need alcohol you need tobacco you need a woman you need a car he said we tried to satisfy that thirst with worldly things well where did that come from it was your spirit being carnal trying to interpret that which was divine and so it said what you need is what the flesh needs and so it misinterpreted it but one day I came to the right interpretation and I met him and the spirit couldn't understand it and the flesh couldn't feel it and it changed my life her problem was that she was thirsting for God so as a woman the spirit interprets it as comfort so it interpreted it to her as a as a husband so she marries and it doesn't it washes out and then she's still searching for God she's been to church and she's heard enough word that it's a little fire down here but nothing could help it and so now the Spirit is trying to satisfy the fire that's in her soul that's been lit through the word messiahs come in there is the Living God Abraham he talked with him and there was a fire that was lit down into that soul that the spirit was trying to satisfy through the flesh she married she married married and and she was falling falling falling until one day she wakes up and there's a man in the bed with her that she's lived with during the night and she comes to her senses and she looks over there and it's not even her own husband it's not even covered by a vow she's just living with a man may be married to another because Jesus said yeah and he's not yours and could you imagine how she felt because in here was a seed and the seed was looking at the situation she was in and what have I sunk to it's like waking up after a drunk and realizing what you did at the party how could I've done all that so she went about her daily business and I in my mind I thinks you know she must have been pondering on suicide because her life had come to an end there was no life the end of the tunnel because she knew that because her parents told her to there was and the priest told her there was there's no redemption for you there's no salvation for you you've gone too far we don't want you in the home we've taken your name out of our house we don't even talk about you no more and she went to the to the well and look look at st. John for seems like we're going a long way around the mountain but but sometimes it takes a journey to understand something st. John 4 and verse 19 now he tells us you you've had five husbands and the one you have now he said for thou for thou in verse 17 and the woman answered said I have no husband jesus said unto her that has well said I have no husband for thou hast had five husbands and him and he whom thou hast is not thy husband in that thou sayeth thou truly now when she heard that I guess she must have been a relationship to the Queen of Sheba down in here and she said you know he's revealed everything in my heart because the way that he said that she knew he didn't hear this through gossip it but it was something that went to the inner soul look what she says and the woman saith unto him sir I proceed now what did we read or what did we refer to in Deuteronomy 29 I did not give you a heart to perceive now she has a heart to perceive because God now has been leading her through the Ministry of Christ you know what makes a difference where you go to church because God can't quick an on word but as Jesus was talking to her we realized that her her vision her her inspiration her discernment was being elevated because it was a progressive revelation under the ministry of the word and now she says I perceive she was inspired I perceive that there are two prophet our fathers worshiped in this mountain and you say that in Jerusalem so what does she actually say him now she said I've sought him all my life I've stood outside the temple the house of God where where you go to church I can't go in there but I've stood outside and tried to listen see what we're going on I've been to my church up here on the mountain where we got the golden calf but I never found him you're a prophet where can I find him where can I find him I've searched here in all the religious places a night I never found him but you're a prophet if anybody knows where I can find him you can tell me and there he was standing in front of her the gate and she didn't know him but she was getting pretty close he's as well he said you're up there you don't know what you worship those that priesthood wasn't even a called priesthood the King wasn't even of the royal lineage and and you worship Cavs idolatry and call it Christianity and you change the dates and the times of the feasts and you don't know what you worship now we have the true worship down there in Jerusalem but it was a changing dispensation you couldn't find him down there because he was standing there in front of her he did stand down there at one time but now he wasn't there no longer he said but God seeketh them to worship Him in truth in spirit he says still under the inspiration of God now he could have revealed it terrific - but he was bringing her up to the opening of that seventh seal what's the seventh trumpet reveal when the seventh trumpet blows the door the gate in heaven opens up and there's the throne it reveals deity what did the seventh seal do revealed deity among us so she was approaching now the seventh seal under the ministry of the messenger of that age she says you know when Messiah comes he's gonna teach us these things and he was God was only inspiring her and bringing her on a journey to a position that he's as well he says the one that's speaking to you I'm he no altar call brother Brown says did you notice her sins was forgiven how by the inspiration of word through faith to believe that he was the Messiah and here comes the church what's going on hey what hey what the anointing we could say was broke but not the revelation and she sit then she pondered that in her heart no altar call no begging you know people come to church today and they want to get saved and I say they come down to the bargaining table all right what do I got to give up and what can I keep you know you say dresses what about a swimming suit or maybe pants when I'm working in the garden well that's a hard one or what about when I'm riding horses but you ever consider not riding horses if you can't write it decently you know well I tell you what how about some pantaloons I don't know you know what those hour of adult was those skirts that look like a skirt but it was actually two legs and women could wear them and as long as they walked just right you couldn't tell they had pants on but if they want to get on a motorcycle or do what they want to do then they were pants you know they were dual purpose so anyway today they come to the bargaining table well you know I was baptized and Father Son and Holy Ghost but in my heart I was thinking about the Lord Jesus Christ so do I need to really you know be baptized again and it's a bargaining table but the new birth is supposed to be a death it's not supposed to be you know trying to bring somebody back to life and and putting them on life support you ain't gonna be on life support and come to a resurrection there's no life support its life in you and you've got to come to a death and there's no bargaining when death comes [Applause] there's no hiding place from death but he said I am the resurrection in life she ran through the street and said come see a man and the church was still wondering what was going on he said the church is still wondering what's going on today not talking about the bride the church you know John's disciples they didn't even know who he was after all those years of ministry after walking with him all those years they didn't know who he was Jesus had to tell him who he was he was that Elijah someone couldn't even leave him to follow Christ Enoch Enoch was listening to one of the services or maybe he was sitting there in the coffee table with him and Adam says you know there was a time I can remember that when all in the evening when when me and Eve used to walk through the garden God used to come down and he just put his arms around us and walk with him you know on the rest of their church was that was good you know but those days are past but we still worship Him in truth in spirit but Enoch was just a little bit different than the than the normal church member or the backslidden member or the unbeliever because in him that when he heard Adam talking about God coming down and putting his arms around or perhaps if it was like brother branham said and he laid him down and he tucked him into the bed and give him a goodnight kiss you know they said oh that's good you know Adam and we've heard this a lot but you know down in the heart of Enoch and remember any cuz you I'm not talking about Enoch I'm talking about you and I ain't talking about the woman at the well I'm talking about you I'm not talking about the Queen of Sheba I'm not talking about David but we find our identity identification in them and Enoch says I believe that and I still believe that there's a living God and I believe that I can have that experience because he loved God so much and what Adam had told him said of fire down into his heart let's turn to Hebrews 11 for a moment Hebrews 11 and verse 5 now remember each one of these characters of faith that what Paul has written here by the instant buy the inspiration of God is in particular reference to the person that we're talking about we're not talking about Abel we're trying to talk about Noah we're talking about Enoch so what I read here in verse 5 and verse 6 is is specifically revealing enix life so here's what I read by faith Enoch was translated so now I know that his translation involves faith and faith what you can't have faith until what God supplies word but all adheres that word has not changed not have but what God inspires of the word that he sent becomes faith so Enoch had a revelation and it was through this revelation that he was translated and I'm not talking about anything I'm talking about you and he was translated so he would not see death and Elijah was translated but he didn't say he was translated so he wouldn't see death it just said he was taken up now we find him at Mount Carmel and then we find him in revelation 11 Enoch couldn't be in Revelation 11 because he was translated that he would not see death so then he couldn't be slayed down on her on the streets Lazarus was resurrected not that he would not see death but he was resurrected but Enoch was translated and he wasn't coming back to die you ain't coming back to die when you're translated you take on a glorified body and go into a millennium and into eternity in that body so Enoch was translated by faith through the righteousness of faith now I'm beginning to see why he was Wow he could walk with Him because God supplied something to him and then he inspired him to what he brought to him and that word because God had translated him and before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God now I heard one man said that he had a testimony that he pleased God I'm the Bride of Christ and I know I pleased God that's not the testimony the testimony is the life that you live by faith as a result of the revelation it's been given to you by God and that faith is being expressed through you in a life not in human obedience but through the life of the soul demanding that the spirit come subject to that by the power of the resurrection of Christ in you the outflowing power of Christ he had a life that please God because he had a revelation and that revelation changed his life before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is all right so this is telling me we're not talking about somebody else we're talking about Enoch in order for Enoch to come to God he had to believe more than the church and just call on the name offer up sacrifices and go home he like David was thirsting for the presence of God he that seeketh God must believe that he is that he's he's able to come into his presence he's able to have a conference with he's able to speak to speak back he's a God of reality he's your God he's my God God only speaks to the prophets God speaks to his children they didn't call him the name of the Lord are called by the name of the Lord are you called by the name of the Lord the Lord descended with a shout and the message was the call of people sanctify them father by through thy truth and thy Word is truth what sanctifies you is what separates you it's the word he supplies and inspiration on that word that separates you it's faith so faith speaks of a separated life and you cannot walk with God without faith he that seeketh God for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him so Enoch was seeking God and he sought him because he believed the testimony of Adam and it was inspired to him by God and it lit a fire and God was pleased and he come to him because it said he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek you know what that means that means that he will reveal himself to you because that's the reward of the seeker it's not money it's not jobs it's not power it's not gifts the reward of those that seek is the reward of the seeker finds him who they seek and he reveals himself to the seeker that believes that he is the same yesterday today and forever Jesus Christ the same same as he wasn't Pentacles same as he was in the Old Testament same God and he that believeth that he is it creates a thirst because you know he is if I knew where his seat was I go find it I want to talk to him you know where he where you can find them is in your heart the hearts the altar but listen you got to have something on your altar before you'll come talk to you you know he wanted fellowship with Abel because in able there was a seed he wasn't the man Abel it was the seed it was that gene seed that soul that was in him anyone had fellowship with the house that he was in and he came and he and he had an altar but if God would have come to him God meets man at the altar he builds the altar and God comes to the altar and man comes to the altar that's the meeting place the mercy seat but if you meet him at the mercy seat and there's no blood it's a judgement seat because sin cannot stand in his presence without being judged so he had to bring a word to Abel and then he had to inspire that word to him it wasn't it wasn't that dead lamb in that blood that made him righteous it testified of the righteousness that was given to him by God through that revelation and he wanted fellowship with him in order to have fellowship with him he had to inspire him that he'd had the right thing on his altar that he could meet with him and God wanted to meet with you but you had to have something on your altar and that was the blood of Jesus Christ and the only way that you're saved is by grace which speaks of the election of God through faith that he had to inspire you to accept the gospel truth of Jesus Christ now you had blood on the altar now he could come and fellowship with you so Enoch sought him we read that over in Jude we have two verses in Jude verse 14 and Enoch also the seventh from Adam oh let me make one more point here in in Hebrews I was thinking it Oh in Hebrews verse 5 chapter 11 verse 5 and was not found so he was not found now in order for him to be not found somebody was looking for him he could not not be found if nobody was looking for him so there's going to be somebody looking for you his mom and his daddy were looking for him his sons and daughters was looking for him his wife was looking for him everybody was looking for him he didn't know where he was there was no implication of where he was they couldn't find him they won't find you either so now it says in in Jude fort verse 14 and Enoch also the seventh from Adam prophesied so now we know that Enoch had a prophecy and in having a prophecy remember that makes him a prophet he had a prophetic ulm Ennis tree I'm not talking about him I'm talking about you because it said take and eat this revelation that I have brought to you this in time message that's to bring rapture in faith you eat this and then you go and prophesy again John so under the eagle anointing we have a prophetic ulm essage and we find that Enoch had a prophetic 'message because he and you are the same he said that was brother Branham it said there an eagle anointing not a city in Eagle not a walking eagle a flying eagle one that was moving one that was was on the move life in him and you prophesy John again prophesy to who you're not gonna prophesy to himself just have to prophesy to somebody so Enoch prophesied of these now who is that you have to go back and read verses 1 through 13 of who Jude is talking about contend for the faith for the revelation that was delivered to the Saints he talks about a backslidden that came out of Egypt and died in the wilderness because they didn't follow after the truth he talked about fallen angels that lost their estate he talked about he talked about Balaam he talks about Cain he talks about Cora these he prophesied of these whos these not people spirits so who's the end time people going to be prophets on these Antichrist spirit many faces many forms but same spirit and Enoch prophesied of these that means he was preaching about that in his day he was preaching against the backslidden church he was preaching against he pain in his religion he was preaching against the cold indifferent church that wasn't seeking the presence of God he prophesied he preached because of the revelation it was given to God from God to him 65 years he didn't walk with God and now he has Methuselah so Methuselah is connected to the revelation that was given to Enoch because he didn't walk with God because he had a boy he walked with God because he had a revelation and God revealed to him that he was pouring out judgment against those that he was looking at through the revelation it was given to him that actually came to the Word of of Adam and came to the presence of God and realized in the presence of God the condition of the world how did you recognize the world when you were blind again and the Spirit of God came in you and the light open your eyes and you looked at the world different than you ever did and a revelation came to him in connection with the judgment that God had revealed to him on that generation said when this child dies the deluge will come and he had a baby and he says your name is my fool ah his revelation was embodied in the name of his son not just a deluge was coming but there was a judgment being poured out on that central generation sin had been accumulating since Klain walked out of the presence of God it didn't start overnight it started back when he walked out of the presence but he built temples because his seed built temples the tower Babel and he built a false religion it was a glorious religion it was beautiful he created music God created a heart to sing King created a heart to play God created a heart that would speak through a voice Kaden created trumpets and guitars and cymbals and those are not evil but I'm just he was he he his children they were great singers and worshipers and instrument players and I'm not speaking against that I'm not what is it Church Christ or whatever they have been bleating music in the church because we know that David said let him play with instruments of strings horns whatever symbol sticks worship him but it must be music from the heart not talent the talent is only given to express what's in the heart and if the talent is expressing something that's not in the heart then it's not music to God it's music to the church it inspires a human spirit it can make you cry it can make it laugh it can make you feel brave it can make you march it can make you go into battle but it's what's in the heart that God looks at [Music] Sahin ik had a prophecy and it says behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his Saints to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him so his ministry reached all the way to the second coming of Christ but he ain't gonna be there but his relations will the bride of Jesus Christ because she's gonna have a prophecy and it's gonna speak the same thing that he is prophesied because God doesn't change his mind about his word so now we go back to Genesis again and we find that that Enoch now he walked with God and begat methuselah and he walked with God three hundred years so that means he preached three hundred years so Enoch had three witnesses he had a sign child that was divinely his name was divinely inspired by God and then when that boy died that's when the judgment was coming well Yannick you named that child right right you say God revealed that to you that when that boy died that the judgment was coming that's right you've heard my message you know what I preached against um you seen these things out here he said wool how old is he gonna be when he dies he said I don't know I said the Lord knows I don't know the day or the hour that he's gonna die but I know one thing he's gonna die because God said he was gonna die one things were certain he's gonna die because God said when he dies the deluge the flood the judgments coming when he dies so he had a son child and he had a divinely inspired prophecy a prophetic ulm Ennis tree and he wrote the entire Bible in stone now he might not have been able to read that Bible because John didn't understand everything that was in the book of Revelation but he wrote it under divine inspiration and the author knew exactly what he was writing and Enoch may not have known but that revelation and with that revelation comes to prophecy it was the only thing that came through the judgments of God was his own word the pyramid so they had the pyramid to look at and wonder at it and they said what is it this is well it's a revelation of God the entire plan of redemption is in that in that stone well what is it well I don't know he just told me to build it by divine inspiration I built it according to his blueprint to is revelation it's the entire plan of redemption is in there well I don't know it was the only thing that was on the earth not talking about the Ark that made it through because God's Word doesn't pass away it doesn't fail and it stands yet today I can go over there and I can take my Bible and read the prophecy of of Enoch and I can look at that pyramid I can't see a Sun anymore but I can look at the pyramid and I can look at that Bible and I can say the god of the god of Enoch lives and his words gonna come to pass because Enoch is you Enoch is me and so by divine inspiration he names the son and calls his name Methuselah and I thought you know this is interesting now here's a man walking with God and I don't know that you can eat any more spiritual or any closer to God than walking with him so we can say that he's pretty heavenly minded he's pretty spiritual because in order to walk with God you have to separate from the world so he was living a separated life by faith and he walked with God for 300 years and then I thought it was unusual it says and he had sons and daughters walking with God still having a relationship with his wife still being a daddy he'll being a husband still being a human and at the same time separated he was separated from his wife but he loved his wife and he had relationship with his wife but he was separated by faith and nobody went with him he went alone in when we go we ain't going together holding hands we're gonna step across one by one just as death but it's gonna be a unit it's a Bonnie but it's it's you in Christ that stepped across that chasm that steps over death and puts it under our feet with a glorified body Enoch is you and that's why you believe this message because this is the name of God that's coming this day this is the gate you can't go back you can't go back to the Pentecost you can't go back to Baptist and loser those were gates but it's the gate where his presence is that where his name is the son of man not son of God son of man not brother Branham I'm talking about son of man the manifestation of the sons of God the unveiling what's going to unveil you it'll be the word the word through you bringing his sons to sonship even to include the changing of the role the body speaks on Adam lost that but it's a very year store back to the sons of God as we bear our heads Heavenly Father your word is great your word is true your word is you but Lord we don't want just your word we want that word quick and made alive that same word that was in the beginning that was with God that was God that was made flesh that same word to come down on the day of Pentecost and Tabernacles itself and the people and as tabernacled itself in your children all down through the church ages even to this day but to come to it to fullness of its fruition any he thirsted for him and because it he thirsted for you he sought you and because he sought you you revealed yourself to him just as you did to Luther just as you did to Paul now he sought you with all his heart like the woman at the well but he couldn't find you and because he couldn't find you wasn't satisfied all but it when he met you on that road it changed his life it changed our life and you've allowed us by faith by inspiration to separate from the world and still to be able to live in the world as any continued to have children while he walked with you a human man with human feelings and yet he was walking in another dimension walking in two dimensions at the same time but controlled by a higher dimension he separated himself from the backslidden church and the unbelievers he walked a separated life in faith but he had children he loved his children and he taught his children he preached to them but he was one out of a generation but I remember your word that you looked down saw a lot and you remembered Abraham the Lord let us not be concerned with who's going and who ain't going but Lord with this that we're going and to testify of your coming in a reality of your revealing and your presence and to who those seeds lay in it will light a fire of thirst and hunger that nothing can satisfy until you come to them and reveal them yourself to them as you have revealed yourself to us in Jesus name Lord we pray amen I'm reminded of a of a story that brother Brennan told he was going to a meeting and he'd arrived in a car and there was a great crowd on the outside trying to get into the into the place where they were having the meeting and there was a little blind girl you remember the story she was she didn't got separated from her daddy and everybody was trying to get in there and they were just pushing and bumping her she was getting in people's way and they were one thing on their mind get in there to where they can get a good seat to hear the prophet and see some miracles maybe get prayed for but his highs fell on that little black girl that seemed to be so insignificant and helpless so he said that he he walked her through the crowd he had that raincoat on or whatever it was he had himself kind of camouflage so they couldn't know who he was and the little girl was being bumped around and trying to find her dad and saying daddy daddy kind of like blind bartimaeus Jesus Jesus get out of the way where is it yeah I got a good view Oh somebody's in my way let me touch him and so he said he positioned himself in the such a way that she had to bump into him and she bumped into him and he says oh he says little girl you know like oh what's this what are you looking for oh she says I'm blind and and I'm looking for my daddy he says all he says what can I help you she said if you'll get me down there to the healer he'll pray for me and how fine I did he said oh he said you don't believe that do you yes I do you just get me down there now find my daddy then that world woman was headed to a well and he just kind of positioned himself so that she would bump into him Oh Oh Oh what are you doing and one day he stood in front of you and he just stood in such a way you couldn't go around him you couldn't go under him you couldn't go over and you bumped into something that was real you didn't know what it was but you knew it was real he might be standing in front of you tonight because he wants to talk with you brother Gerald if you'll come god bless you amen thank God for the word appreciate our brothers ministry because he preaches the word it's not man it's the word amen there are so many that do preach about a man but he's preaching about the word I'm bringing us into a personal relationship with the word amen and that's what God wants us to do amen he doesn't want us to put the emphasis on a man but on Christ a man whether he's had a man with a message but as I said one time I said you couldn't recognize the messenger that's good but I said what good is it I said unless you take the message and recognize the message is like a messenger coming to your door and you recognize him and he come from the government and for the post office or wherever and he's got a message for you and and and you got to take it and you got a sign for it and so oh thank you that's it so you take the message in and you just lay it on the table and leave it a man there's a lot of people have done that a lot of people are doing that there's this in a tent instead of taking that and acknowledging the messenger thank God for the messenger praise the name of the Lord now what's the message hey man what's the message oh well oh you're a millionaire well what's the message oh you've got no more worries because somebody's gonna take over all your bills and everything a man but you got to acknowledge the message you got to confirm it hey man you can send all your money you want but we have electronic transfers to me but I got I gotta have a password and I've even had a token as it were and I've got to confirm the thing by the grace of God a man so that's good you know we're thankful for the messenger but thankful are we for the message and there's more to the message than just well being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ there's more to the message than the oneness of the Godhead or the serpent seed but rather we got to get to the person of the message the the one that gave all of this to the Prophet the one that revealed all of this to the prophet a man a vindication of who he is the Alpha the Omega the word in the beginning was the word the Word was with God the Word was God a man and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and the word is made flesh and Will's in us by the grace of God so the word is for brother browser uses the bride is flat is is God in flesh is tracing flesh he said he has come back to be the bride praise the name of the Lord so that the deity is not on there - Delia's down there amen sir brother I tell you this DeeDee who's that I praise the Lord maybe it's why God has not allowed me to preach I'm like what I said I was going to preach concerning Enoch now I Nana and it's been a burden on my heart that way you know I'm walking with God and I had maybe the Lord has been waiting for this for our brother to come and lay this foundation but he did he's been laid you know last night and then earlier yesterday and again today maybe tomorrow or whatever Thor would lay on his heart but but again he said it's you a man it's you it's you it's you and it's good to go back and recognize Enoch but what about you can you compare yourself to Enoch amen brother God has laid it in tonight so we are without excuse absolutely without excuse because our brother is going to heal right if we fail he's going to raise the judgment against us with this word that he that he minister tonight and we can't say we didn't know this we didn't know that we didn't know no no no God a God of God will bring up by our brother Macon's and listen here's that voice that's not him that's me of me I was ministering through him amen since the prophet of God had to get himself out of the way for their for their to manifest the gifts he had to get himself out of the way to preach the word a man it is the anointing is just a different level of anointing a main one is for this gift another one for that given another one for the preaching of the word by the grace of Almighty God so thank God for our brother and the world amen that his emphasis is the word and I noticed I noticed I noticed that last night when he was ministering I said Lord as it is the word I said it's the word it's the word and I said he's constantly trying to bring our attention to the word and to the revelation and as I've been talking to our brother here and I used to remember I said dude don't they don't take a spoken word book I said and just go preach on it don't you do that did you taking them put it in here and I said now preach it I said you'll preach the word a man and I'm sure that this is seventy of is appreciated our brothers ministry last evening and again this evening because it's the word and I thought about it I said O Lord I said he's reaching christ he's reached in salvation he's reaching the ISIS preacher redemption not just you know goddess and a prophet so I the devil believes that Satan and over this doctor that doctrine the devil believes all those doctrines he knows that's the truth and then not only that but he knows more about this hour then it's a lot of so-called believers because the Bible says he and he knows his time is short but a revelation he got what a faith that he got rather and his faith is safe he knows his time is short he's come down with great wrath so do you know that your time is short amen brother I tell you this and after hearing what we heard last night and hearing what we were it again tonight we ought to realize that time is short Amy yeah our brother took that word there and he takes it right on back I like that he talked and he said not talking about he like I'm talking about you it's good so I can't you identify with that can you identify with that what he's reading here about Enoch he's reading about you hey man praise the name of the Lord because you know what with God and and that's that's what I wanted was going to preach on what does it mean to walk with God you know and and so on he walked with God and he was not because God took everything so brother - what with God is here you're going to do something that pleases God yeah a man is going to go you're going to do something that well again then it's going to be anointed hallelujah it's got the aunts got the anointing that it'll do for you when it did for Enoch hallelujah oh he want me in that revelation and walked in that River should I walk into that revelation til he got more and more and more separated from the world and the things of the world he walked with God he had relationships with with this one as our brother brought out and that one in so many a right hand into intimate relationships and so on but it's greater this greatest relationship he was was was with God to see what he saw and the know what he knew all brother he was close to God hallelujah walk with God we gotta walk with God walking with the word walking with the message and brother again that our my brother's ministry last night and a ministering in the night is God is my god proving whether or not you're walking with Him a man whether or not you're identifying with the revelation that God is revealing has he not being a man praise the name of the Lord so it's in our motives in our attitude in our objectives we gotta please God and it's all got to be based on the word for this day it gotta be based on the word for this age by the grace of God it's got to be what God is doing and brother listen deadliness and believe it that our motives our attitudes our objectives pleases God does it whether it's here in this assembly whether it's a and if it do well what is women do if your motive objective and that who doesn't please God at work and in everyday living it doesn't please God here no no I got a please got here you're not going to receive the word the way you should if it's not right over there it's not right here you got to come in the spirit a man and a nu and go to walk with God in the revealed Word there's too many walking with the devil that's the truth they think they're walking with government or walking with the devil and let me repeat it again and because the messenger reminded us and warned us that the Christ and the Antichrist are twins in the same church so do you know which one years serving they're twins of the same church why because they got the word you know except the devil got 99.9 percent God got on two percent a man - they're twins sometimes you know you have twins out here and only mom and dad can tell them apart sometimes mother they can't even tell them apart and I've known where parents of many twins or triplets and and they've had to head to head their names on Honduras so they know which was which a main God knows God knows are we walking with God or walking with the devil that's good brother it's good cane walk with the devil able walk with God not Elvis brother we're huh I tell you Verena don't be like as our brother brother tonight he not be like that I tell you this he had a hunger and he had a first for thought he loved God because he knew God loved him a man and love will produce law that's where like the problem of God did say he said why did he do all this why did he allow all this why did he permit all this he says so he could reveal his character to you and you would love him for himself hallelujah he's a wonderful the revelation and you got it now that is forever settled I like it concerning the the verdict he had to do it before he could bless us with anything else he had the justify us Amen Saint was there accusing and accusing and a kerosene to finally got stood up the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world and they said look say you get out of here that's my son that's my daughter so on praise the name of the Lord he justified us so he could fit he could do the rest thank the Lord oh praise His name so brother let's make sure we're walking with God not the devil and their River oh well I'm not walking with the devil I don't drink I don't smoke well maybe I could say neither does the devil especially when he when he's identifying with religion and remember he's not worried about that religion of there he got that they're already worshipping him thinking they're worshiping Jesus and you got as I said believers worshipping the devil thinking they're worshiping Jesus that's how that's how serious it is so brother he's not worried about that I tell you where he's we're going to be right where God is he's gonna be right where God is doing this and doing that and doing something else it's gonna be in you in your life in your home in your job no matter what if he is he's called me right there to hinder your walk with God god help us oh my god I got to say this too just to say just to show our appreciation for the brother for the ministry and for what he's brought light brought out and that struck me it was good the bargaining table I'll tell you when it comes to a bargaining table is the devil got the bargaining table you know you love the bargaining table if you do this I'll do this if you do that in here yeah oh you'll get this you'll get that you use a compromise what the bargaining table does is compromise yeah that's what you got to do and you know we've had when we were living in Mount Pearl there and when we used to have a lot of wouldn't call it there are those yard sales and you know and you know the ones that we had the greatest problem with were the religious people yeah and the others were coming in and look at the insane yeah I'll take this I'll take this I take what happen and I remember and in particular I remember we had some religious people come in and I knew that they were they were really religious in the sense that in the sense that the woman had long hair and you're trans like woman you know very modest clothing and the man was very modest and so on and nice annoying they're talking but they were gonna pick up all this piccolo that all right now can we bargain over this well we'll give you this much work whereas the others just come as is here but they didn't want to do that even though it was you know that we we've used about of a sign and says listen our prices are the cheapest in Canada the TVs in Canada and yeah and yet still they they they're these so-called Christians were satisfied and knowing that others would come in and we didn't know they're Christians are not and we would say now 10% of all this goes to goes to charity goes through church and some would even give us more than what we asked o church yeah only said what you can keep the change we know we don't want to change brother a lot of world we're living in I tell you this when it comes to religion you got it you got a Brit judge everything by the word let's compare it to the word everything it is the distant Saints but I get it man thought my way is forever settled in heaven don't bargain with the devil that's good go get go get the DVD and listen to it again they man maybe we're going to get our brother come back and preach on the bargaining table a man yes we made will run with me we need that someone to enlarge on it we need something to break on it we need something to exhort on today and here is more more a greater revelation of it why to see that the devil is out there getting us to bargain with our faith bargain with what we believe you know you can still believe this and I'll give you this you still believe that but I'll do this yeah hey hey man praise the Lord brother Brown said he was you know what Jesus was be doing when he when he did that he was being an example he said for the Deacons I told the Deacons here in the church I said well I guess I'll add the group by some whips hey man and give them and give that give all the dickens a whip a man I guess there's a lot of Deacons would resign that's right brother yeah because why because in the temple they had bargaining tables you know they're Duke we don't bargain here for you know to exchange money you could go into a bargain here you know divided by this to the doves for sacrifices or maybe the Lambs or whatever they're what we call it a yard sale they call it a temple sale I guess Valentina this when Jesus saw it les said yeah hey do we have that attitude do we ever had to do the Jesus saying and I know a lot of people think that's not a Christian attitude oh yeah you call that man a Christian you call that me and you know a trial of God a servant of God he was gone anybody but again in this I heard we was people were thinking he's not a Christian here he was a Christian he wouldn't he wouldn't say that he wouldn't act like that he certainly wouldn't take a whip and whip them out of the temple a man he go ahead brother he got there and he went in and and he whipped about idiot get out of here and all the animals and all and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and he didn't stop to pick it up yeah dog meat oh now you call that Christian yeah see see the man got one idea Christianity God got another but see where did they get that idea they got it from the devil and he just whipped them out with and as we when we were in Israel and we saw some repairs going on there in a in Jerusalem and maybe none the Westside there's someone near the near the the eastern wall and and our guide said if you see that over there and he said where they're working I said yeah man we all see yeah he said well he said that's where Jesus he said whip them out of the temple he see needs to do it again and he was a Jew of Salvage that he needs to do it again why because my there's too much emphasis or the money and that is even around this message amen there's too many preachers that are taking the tithe and the tithe and the tithe and the tight and they're not going to share with nobody because they wanted a man that's not right remember the time that we need went into the sanctuary the tithe that went into the temple in the Old Testament that the Levites and the priesthood would only go in and take what they need it not what they wanted what they did and you had this need all right go get it yeah there's need go get it but you didn't go in there just take it and bake it somewhere in your tent there's a lot of preachers as I say that are that are that are that are ordering the tithing there and they keep their hands on they when they won't share it with anybody I even had an email and somebody asked me I said brother can you help me with this and he said he said if a minister is getting more tities than he needs he said easy obligated to share that with a pastor or a minister there that's not getting sufficient funds you know to me they're nice I said he is absolutely obligate additional sites absolutely we're that other and that other than the other ministries out there to help them there's a reason why our brother brought it about deciding tonight because when he touched on I said Lord I said why did he say that for what it says on that for is the Laureus summer I said there must be a reason I said you know Lord and again another brother that we all know and known around the world wrote and asked me said brother can you gonna give me some highlights on tilings and I and I went in tonight and I gave him a sort of a discourse on tithing in the in the email and he printed and he said I'm going to send this he said to every every clergy every minister that I know and I deal with in the message age thank you because it's being abused that's not walking with God that's walking with the devil that's right the prophet of God exhorted us on these things because I said now I so remember I said the man that I said that had the child that was dying then the pilot of God went in and pray for it and it got well and I said the man came and yet offered the prophet of God his tidings and the prophet of God turned it down and so now he said go he said pay it under on the hospital bill I said william branham said paid on the hospital bill not the profit that was the man but he said the doctor won't take it because the doctor said he didn't do anything to make him well it was a miracle and he came back and offered it again the poverty God said no sorries it just take it he said I put it toward this expense or that expense will in Brenham said that and I finally the third time he came back he said brother Branham the Lord told me to give you the tithing it needs to thank your brother I'll take it and I'll put it into the ministry and missions and God bless them see I said the Prophet said I'll take it William Brown said do this to that but the prophecy god help us to walk with God you got to walk with God in every choice you make every decision you make you and then you're walking to the revelation that Enoch walked into that's good you can preach on the bargain you do brother because the devil if his anything he's doing today and changing this whole world once today is a bargain everybody's looking for a bargain they want something for nothing that's the spirit of the world doing and I brought it out when I was talking on tidings that it is contrary to the scriptures for you to go out and get someone to do something for you and not pay them somebody that's kind and you know they'll they're there to help you and and they come in and volunteer even the Bible tells us that a volunteer that comes in and helps you to do some work that you're obligated to pay him the Bible forbids free labor I was shocked when I read it and you get people going around looking for free labor yes brother the neighbor is worthy of his hire thank God for the word Oh brothers no book like it no book liar in the world what it contains and I was surprised when I read that right there in the end in the Old Testament somehow it says you've got to give him something and an appreciation for what he did for you and yet people going around looking for get something free free free free free salvation wasn't free and as I said we couldn't afford to perk to purchase it so he did it but I said can you afford to possess it love you don't think that there's a price well Jesus said count the cost make sure you're able to finish what you started top the cost come on this let's this tape the exhortation tonight I've titled a message that we are denied enough in you that's good you know in you you know whatever yeah he couldn't tell you with him in the natural and you can't take it with you God is God help us to have Enochs attitude God Elvis to have a Enochs motives and objectives and you know what then got to take you on to the IRS and deeper depths of the revelation that we might they never that we might be turn up and become the missing once that's good they were looking for inna couldn't find him I trust I'll be looking for you and not find you as I said one of these days they're gonna show up and turn off in church and so on so is missing this one's missing just a few oh they're gone for a week in the week next weekend they're still not there there might be a scatter ministry short missing and maybe most will still be a little bit it's a challenge to our faith god help us let us not a bargaining table now you did say come let us reason together saith the Lord but we're not talking about bargains it's all right here forever settle to them you can't change it now come let us reason together saith the Lord though your sins be as scarlet they should be as white as snow red like crimson they shall be as wool a man that's the result of the reasoning and the bargaining with God that we see praise the Lord that's wonderful we got a reason with him the confines of the word that is forever settled in Hammond hey man god bless you brother Mike thank God for the revelation of Enoch and you you know and we pray grace that we're walking with God pray grace that were

it well there was a prophet here to interpret it well if God wrote rapturing fate and again I like what he brought in I said lord I come I never put the notes then in my Bible a bad bad and the Lord used our brother to bring it together for me I say thank you Jesus when he referenced Thessalonians the Lord should have said remember with the show the voice of the Archangel the Trump of God oh oh and that God brought big bud to my remembrance what another preacher preached years ago oh I said and I'm going right back to first Corinthians 15:50 I think it was about the last Trump [Music] we see bracelet for women [Music] inserting the coming of the Lord first 52 first corinthians 15:52 right brother the old he said I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed and in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and that's what struck me right there when our brother quoted that's the Lord's the last trumpet the trumpet shall sound and he said in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump hallelujah for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed hallelujah praise the Lord because he said there the the archangel and the
