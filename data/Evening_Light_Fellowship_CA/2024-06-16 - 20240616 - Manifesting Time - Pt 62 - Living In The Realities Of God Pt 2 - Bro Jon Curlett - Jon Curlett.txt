Lord we've got an eye that sharpened to see your word Lord and to dwell on that Lord and though sometimes it seems far away Lord we know that your word is yay and amen Lord It's truth and it cannot fail your Believers so Lord we're believing once again this morning Lord that your word won't fail Lord that it'll hit the mark Lord that it'll come into our lives and souls Lord that it'll draw us a little higher Lord a little further away from the doubts and traps of this world Lord that it'll Lift us into Heavenly places Lord where the fullness of the word is revealed nor not just in our minds Lord but in our very lives and souls we pray Lord won't you just have your way once again this morning Lord speak to your people Lord you are the shepherd and they are your flock Lord we're trusting you to do a work in each life here this morning Lord God lord we invite you in now to take preeminence in this service in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Psalm 17 Psalm 17 this morning amen want to say Happy Father's Day to all the faithful fathers that are here this morning and all of us that have a faithful father amen we've got a great father above us all amen he's more faithful than we can be and that's our great rest amen is that we have a heavenly father that loves us and cares for us and covers for us and protects us and meets all of our needs amen and we have a number of announcements this morning certainly appreciate the special this morning right in line with the service I was talking to brother Jim douly the uh yesterday and his his brother Jack has Belle's paly and he's got one eye that stays open and his jaw is having some problems as well so he asked for prayer for that brother Jim will be in uh tomorrow until the 30th so I've asked him he'll take one service Lord willing while he's here so we look forward to fellowship with him amen we want to re want to welcome sister Rebecca Benjamin to the church this morning amen all the way from Ontario amen the Lord gives amen so I was telling her yesterday I don't believe that God just sends us members he sends us a part of the body that we were missing and we didn't know amen so if somebody comes in we believe they're here for a reason they're here to get a blessing and they're here to be a blessing Amen to be a part of the body so we want to certainly make her welcome so the Lord gives and the Lord also takes away and uh brother Josh and sister relle asked me to announce to the church that they'll be me moving to Ottawa on July 11th right after the special meetings and they just feel led to do that so I said it's a real shame we certainly have appreciated having them brother Josh has been here 15 years maybe brother Josh is that about right 15 years of faithful service and he's been a real steady believer it's a it's a real shame it's a real shame to miss him but here's the thing somebody needs him more than we need him apparently so we trust that God does all things well and he gives a blessing and he takes away some blessings but we say brother Josh sister relle and baby anniah God go with you God bless you we certainly love and appreciate you and if there's anything we can do to help you on that move then just let us know and and we'll be there to do it amen amen God bless you Psalms chapter 17 and verse 5 this morning David says this he says hold up my goings in thy paths that my footsteps slip not I have called upon thee for thou Wilt hear me oh God incline thine ear unto me and hear my speech show thy marvelous loving kindness oh thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them keep me as the apple of the eye hide me under the shadow of thy Wings amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and we're continuing our series on manifesting time on the adoption of the Sons and Daughters of God and I want to continue the the series we started last service on living in the realities of God and I want to keep pressing on this and we asked last service where is the god of the Bible amen and it's a fair question and we know it's been asked many times in scriptures and just by way of review this morning for those that weren't here Gideon asked if God be forc and where are all the Miracles Gideon had heard of the god of Moses and the the god of Abraham and the god of Isaac and the god of Joshua and these different things but he says if God is really with us then where are the Miracles where is the proof that he's with us amen we know that Elisha when elah died he came over to that River and he says where is the god of Elijah and he smot the waters and they parted amen and we see that God is still alive and well he never dies he never stops moving he never falls asleep but there Comes A Time of Need there Comes A Time of battle there Comes A Time of decision there Comes A Time of trial and we need the reality of God Amen it's not enough now to just sit in church and hear a preacher it's not just enough to sit and read your Bible but you need the god of that preaching the god of that Bible to step out of those pages and into the circumstances of your life amen we don't just want a god of reality we need we need a god of reality amen and if we are to step into adoption if we have stepped into adoption then we've got to see that God is a reality because this world is broken people are broken the systems are broken politics are broken the financial systems broken morality is broken everything's broken there's only one thing that stands steadfast and sure and that's the word of God in our lives amen amen I read this quote last service and I want to repeat it for those that weren't here just to keep us moving forward this morning brother brownan would say this he says I think that today we've had much preaching many five ministers able ministers have brought us the word your pastors and evangelists and so forth that come through the city but I think the main thing that I'm trying to bring to you now he's setting himself apart and this isn't ego talking but this is the Fulfillment of scripture speaking over the pulpit now amen this is a prophet of God and he's differentiating his ministry he says what I'm trying to bring to you is the reality of the presence of Christ he says that you might see him and know that it's him by his identified promise for the day so we have to see that there's a revealing of God for each day and it's according to the promise of his word he does not come the way we want him to come he comes the way he said he was going to come amen he he is in alignment with his word at all times and so last service we talked about the mystery of Christ The Mystery of God being unfolded in this age and we talked about a seventh Angel's voice and a restoring message that brings us back to the original truth of the Pentecostal fathers and we said why does God have to do this because God's got to take us to the uh the intended conclusion of the word which is a resurrection and a Rapture it's a Redemption it's a restoration of the Bride to her original position in Christ and to do that she has to have the original word as it was understood and taught Amen brother bham did not bring a new message if you think that it's heresy he did not bring a new message he brought a restoring message that restored the truth of the word that was lost through 2,000 years of men's ideas and denominations anden there's nothing new here they understood those things already but Paul would say this mystery this mystery unveiling it's been there since the world began but it's been kept secret but he says it's happening now it's manifesting now it it's coming to fruition right now and God has been working in Simplicity all through 6,000 years and usually working in Simplicity means working with simple people amen it's not not big flowery speeches it's not men of renown in terms of their education or their knowledge but it's simple people of Faith simple humble Victorious Believers that God has worked in through all these times and it's the revealing of God Through the Ages in little simple humble men and women throughout the times Paul would say this he says to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is what Christ in you the hope of glory not just Christ in the prophet not just Christ and the one that's bringing the word but there's a word that comes to the word and it's revealing who you are in him amen this morning so it was all tied to the church ages it was tied to that final messenger of the final seventh Church age and we have plenty of scriptures and I'm not going to go into it this morning if you weren't here Wednesday night go back and listen to the first 15 or 20 minutes and it'll set you up for where we're going this morning but after I said all that I read one quote and I wanted to read it again this morning as we're talking about living in the realities of God because we want to know what are the realities for today what are we supposed to be looking for and what does it look like in our personal lives amen not just what's happening out there what's happening in here what's happening in here that's where we want God to be amen the re the reality of God is for God to fulfill his word that's what it looks like amen and so we've got to know what the word is supposed to be fulfilling in our day now brother BR would say this and he reads Revelation 10:7 in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger when he shall begin to sound the history of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets he says there it is he's sending a Vindicated Prophet he's sending a prophet after almost 2,000 years he's sending someone who is so far from organization education and the world of religion that is John the Baptist and Elijah of old he will hear only from God and he will have thus saith the Lord and speak for God now that's a heady statement but we see it in Revelation 2 and 3 that there's an angel mess meenger to each of the seven Church ages and that angel messenger has the voice of the Holy Ghost it says hear what the spirit sayth unto the churches and guess what it speaks through a prophet messenger and what's he doing he's bringing you to the word for your day amen that's what we believe this morning but then he says this he will be God's mouthpiece And he as it is declared in Malachi 4:6 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers that's where you and I come in he says he will bring back the elect of the last day and and they will one here a Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth as it was with Paul he does not bring a new message he is telling us what Paul originally taught then he will restore the truth as they had it and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his Works amen behold I said unto you Elijah the prophet he's coming to do a work in our lives not just through that prophet he did not stop at a prophet but the voice has moved into the bride now and she is speaking in the stad of God because why the Same Spirit that's in hers is in the prophet amen it's God speaking through his bride and we know that God and brother B would say it's all been hidden through types and shadows throughout the scriptures after those seals were opened he says he says go back and read your Bible and if you don't see Jesus Christ on every page go back and read it again and yet what do you read in those pages you read about people you read about people and it's just a mention here of God does this and God did that but every page is God working through a bride it's God working through an elect people and he's saying you got to see Christ in the people not just Christ in the pillar of fire or Christ in the body as he came 2,000 years ago anden we see the word always comes to a woman so many times not always comes it comes so often to a woman and many times she's an outcast many times she's a gentile we see Rahab gets a a promise of saving life see it always comes with a promise and Rahab it's not only to say save her life but anyone else she can get in he'll save them as well it's extended to her you have the woman at the will well what's her promise you'll never thirst again you'll never seek anything once you've tasted what I've given you hallelujah amen that's why we don't go seeking another message that's why we don't go seeking after other things we've already got our thirst satisfied and we're drinking from a well that will never will never end in our lives amen see Ruth what does she get she gets a promise of redemption something that never belonged to her and yet it's redeemed to her she didn't realize she owned something she didn't realize she had an inheritance but she had a man that came to her and he redeemed her by the word of that day so this morning we're going to talk about a woman but this is not an outcast but this is a great woman amen it's a woman with wonderful character faithful in her house and community and she was well regarded in many ways and you know many of us were H were perhaps outcasts in some ways you know brother Mark would say he was living under a mushroom you know certainly in the in the things of God outcasts Catholics atheists agnostics whatever it might be but many of us were born in a Christian Home praise the Lord and so we have to still come to a place where the word comes to us not just where we go to church but we have to make a decision and we have to have a personal experience that validates and vindicates that word in our life where we know that God is real and God is alive and well but we see this word coming to a woman and we can read about it in 2 Kings 4 and if you'll take your Bibles there I may move around a bit but we'll stay in Second Kings this morning and it says this and it fell on a day that Elijah passed to shunum now that that that that word shunum means double resting place it means undisturbed in other words you're at peace so much that if the first piece is broken you got a piece behind the piece and you cannot be frustrated you cannot get worried you cannot be broken you cannot be fearful it's peace layered on top of Peace On Top Of Peace you are at rest at all times what a glorious thing to think of that no matter what's happening you can say all is well amen and we see that's exactly the way it goes but it says in shunum there was a great woman and she constrained him to eat bread you know they did that on when they were walking to emus they constrain Christ to come in sometimes we've got to pull him in he comes our way but we've got to pull him in it constrained him to eat bread and so it was that as often as he passed he turned in thither to eat bread so notice here it says that there was a great woman there were many women in shunum there were many Israelite women in shunum but there were also a great Gentile woman great women maybe perhaps but there's one great woman that the scripture mentions and she is a gentile this is a blended City they have Israelites and they have Gentiles listen uh uh living there but there's only one that's identified as a great woman by the scriptures and the prophet of God would confirm this many times he says she was a shunamite she was a gentile and we'll see where he gets that from as we go through the scriptures this morning it it was interesting I was doing some just some research on on on different element of of this is I was studying yesterday and I I I was reading of a a woman theology professor and she was talking about the patriarchy and the right of agency and and the roles of women in the scripture and she ties this woman to Israel and she's made a false premise right there because she says she had leadership over her husband and she had this and that and the other and she completely misses that this woman was a gentile she's gone off on these things Church we're blessed to have a message like we have today I was listening to an Adventist service yesterday and they're convinced that the tribulation will will will center around those who celebrate uh who meet to worship on the Sabbath that's what's going to cause the tribulation hasn't caused the tribulation yet why would it cause it now there there there's nothing going on about the Sabbath nobody cares about it but they're convinced on it why because they picked an element of scripture that they're going to stand on and they'll Circle every single thing about it and they'll completely Miss what's going on around them we're blessed this morning to have a word amen but you first word it says a great Gentile woman I looked up that word great and the first time you see it is in Genesis 1116 where God created two great lights a greater one to rule today the day that's Christ and then a lesser one to rule the night and that's the moon and that's the bride reflecting Christ This is a reflection of Christ here in this little story that we see and she stands far above all others and we see why that is as we'll go through that this morning it says and she said unto her husband behold now I perceive that this is an holy man of God which passes by us continually this is Elisha the prophet believe me everybody that's an Israelite knows who Elisha is she has no clue who she is but there's something about him that she says he's a holy man he's a good man there's something different about this man and the prophet of God will put it this way he says elishah so conducted himself around in that Gentile country there that this my woman realized that he was truly a servant of God by what his character his conduct and the things that God did by him she recognized him to be a servant of the Lord notice those three things say we think well it'll be the signs and wonders he says no his conduct and his character his day-to-day living was the first thing that catches her attention and then the signs and wonders follow that what are people looking at in our lives church can they see the character can they see the conduct does it cause them to want to draw us into their lives or is there something that's pushing them away the starting point of this story is not Elisha it's the woman it's the woman and she has wealth and she has a big house and so she takes those things and she welcomes Travelers that are passing by in to take some refreshments to put up their feet to have a nice meal or a cool drink or something her character inside of her makes her welcoming to whoever would come her way that ought to be the nature of the Bride amen God crosses a lot of paths today amen when you're walking around this world it's God Crossing people's paths and the question is church is our conduct and character causing people to draw Us in or is it pushing them away cuz sometimes our attitude is the thing that pushes him away not what we stand for our attitude is the thing that pushes him away but Elisha walks by and he's God's Prophet he's God's mouthpiece for that day and God spoke through Elisha and Elisha went a lot of places and a lot of people that knew him turned him down but here's a gentile woman and she brings him in and brings him in and over time she realizes that this is a special man this is a special man he's a holy man and you'll find that with Believers all over the world and when you talk to them about their testimony they'll say there's just something about the word that I can't get away from and it doesn't matter where they come from doesn't matter if they're from India from Africa from Canada I've been over in Ukraine and Russia people that are true believers are drawn to the word and they don't even know it they don't even know they're a Believer sometimes but there's something about when Christ the word in your life passes through their life that they latch on to it and something Springs to life and they realize there's something there that I want there's something there that I need and they'll pull us into their life what's the difference church it's a seed there's a seed inside that person and they don't even know it's there but something Springs to life and they start to feel things they start to think things they start to understand things and yearn for things that maybe they had never thought of before it's the word coming to the word so what do she do do with this she says let us make a little chamber I pray thee on the wall the literal meaning there is let's build him an upper room it's on top of the of the roof of the house and let us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool and a Candlestick and it shall be when he cometh us that he shall turn and neither she wants this man in her life she wants this Prophet to be on her property she wants the blessing of the word in her life amen he's different and she wants to do something for him she recognizes that he's worthy of it and it fell on a day that he came and he turned into the chamber and lay there and he said to GES a servant call the shunamite and when he had called her she stood before him and he said unto her say now and he said unto him say now unto her behold thou has been careful for us with all this care what is to be done for thee what has thou be spoken for to the king or to the captain of the host and she answered I dwell among my own people in other words she's happy with where she's at she's a gentile she's got her family she's got relatives around she's got what she needs she says I don't need anything I didn't do it for that I'm just happy to give you a little portion and he said what then is to be done for her and gesi answered verily she had no child and her husband is old in other words she hasn't had a child and there's no hope of her having a child and he said call her and when he had called her she stood in the door and he said about this season according to the time of life Thou shalt Embrace a son and she said nay my Lord thou man of God do not lie unto thine handmaid she is so past hope of an heir of a child she didn't ask for this she wasn't expecting it she did it out of kindness out of the inclination of her own heart she acted to support a prophet and now he comes and he gives her he tells her the desires of her heart and then he says you'll have it and she says don't play with me like this don't don't play games that's that's a serious thing that's that's close to my heart and you're sitting here telling me I'm going to have it don't lie to me like that but he doesn't back off because it's not him that's making the promise Church he's a mouthpiece for God Elisha does not have life in himself amen but he's got a god behind him that shows him what's going to happen and he speaks as God speaks to him and he says he's saying thus sayith the Lord you're going to have a child God's the author of life God's the one that brings these things and that woman has promised a child and not just a child a son an heir a continuation of her generations and of her family name she's a gentile woman she's on the outside of the Israelites she has no right and no access to God there is nothing that allows her to come to God but yet the word comes to her hallelujah it's a sovereignty of God reaching out to her why because there was something in her that would respond when God came her way Hallelujah God comes to those that will receive him amen and this woman this Gentile woman is right there with Hannah the mother of uh of Samuel he's right there with Elizabeth the mother of John she's right there with Sarah the mother of Isaac and she's a gentile woman that has no promise in the word but yet the word comes to her and says you're going to have this I'm going to give it to you and it's the Sovereign working of God church that's why we're here this morning is The Sovereign working of God why because he knew us before the foundation of the world he knew us before we even had a thought before we came into existence and he knew what's inside of us and he knew if he came our way then would respond to him and we would take him at his word amen amen unto you I send Elijah the prophet he sends his prophets to people that will hear the word amen God knows what's inside of each and every one of us now watch what happens it says and the woman conceived and bear a son at the season that Elisha had said unto her according to the time of life and when the child was grown it fell on a day that he went out to his father to the Reapers and he said unto his father my head my head and he said to a lad carry him to his mother and when he had taken him and brought him to his mother he sat on her knees till noon and then died can you imagine how she feels about this church can you imagine if God heals you and then six years later that disease comes back on you there's sister Andrea Grant over in BC she's had cancer three times church and she's been healed three times see what's the attitude going to be when things take a turn for the worse when the word promise seems to have been lost that's what what this son is to her is he is the word made flesh he is the manifestation of the promise of the word in her life her word promise has just died where is the god of Elijah now where's the god of Elisha now where is the god that promised it God gives it now he takes it away what kind of a God would do this when God blesses our brothers and their businesses and things are flourishing then all of a sudden things get tight all of a sudden we're staring bankruptcy in the face where is the god that gave me my business we've had brothers that have and sisters that have lost spouses across this message just in a moment where is it why would God do that what's our response when God does things like that when God allows it when God allows it look at job job lost everything except the wife that gave him bad advice and he said the lord giveth and the lord taketh away and he didn't stop there he said blessed be the name of the Lord good times and bad praise His name amen that's the attitude that's the attitude God blesses us and then sometimes he pulls back just to see what you're going to do amen we're in a season of change this woman was in the season of change and in seasons of change you have things that are given and you have things that are taken away and it's for your good amen and you've got to be able to praise God through all of those things amen we have we we think that the realities of God is all the blessings and the Miracles but here's the thing you've got to go through a time of needing a blessing and needing a miracle before you get it You' got to go through a battle you've got to go through a trial before he can be the god of your answers amen it's a yin and yang if we wanted to put it that way so when the things are pulled back then what do we do are we faithful and strong giving praise to God as Abraham was or are we whiny and petulant like the children of Israel when we don't get our water for the day or we don't get our bread for the day we need a checkup this morning because this woman is a type of the Bride it's a woman that has found favor with God and that doesn't mean she doesn't have trials or or tribulations but a means she's got a rock in a weary land that she can go to Every Time those things happen we've got a sure Foundation we can go to church that God has Us in the palm of his hands every single time watch what she does now it says and she went out and laid him on the bed of the man of God and shut the door upon him and went out and she called unto her husband and she said send me I pray thee one of the young men and one of the asses that I may run to the man of God and come again this is almost a casual like honey I'm going out for groceries and I need somebody to carry it for me this is not a woman that's that's distraught that's all up in tears or throwing a tantrum or or or or just in the in the the the depths of Despair but she says I'm going to need some help can you give me one of the servants to go with me I'll be out I got to go see the prophet and I'll be right back what an attitude she's got the promise of the word laying dead in her house and she says I've got to go out and I'll be back in a little bit that's all she says and he and her husband said wherefore wilt thou go to him today it's neither new moon or Sabbath there's two things here that man's going to be somewhere on a new moon or a Sabbath he's going to be somewhere you can find him she's a gentile she's not in church and she says you're not going to be able to find him and you know what she says she says and she said unto him it shall be well it'll be okay it'll work itself out all I know is I got to find the prophet and I have a need for him therefore I'm going to find him it's going to be okay and then she saddled and asked and she said to her servant drive and go forward slack not thy writing for me except I bid thee no hysterics no moaning no complaining she says go until I tell you to stop don't stop for anybody don't stop for anything unless I tell you to stop this woman is in A desperate need amen and she's not letting anything distract her got to get to Jesus amen so many times what happens is we've got a need and it's as I said last service it's quick now I lay me down to sleep Lord help my need and then we fall asleep but no let's press let's lay aside everything that would hold us back let's not not get distracted by the things of this world but say Lord I'm coming to you and I'm not going to stop until I find you and it'll be well that's when it'll truly be well brother Braham says this he says now sometimes when we meet the requirement we think why didn't he answer God does that sometimes to see what our reaction will be look at the shunamite woman for instance see she wanted to see he wanted to see what her reaction would be and he does that many times just to see how we'll react but if this is the big if church if we're certain that we have met God's requirement just stay right with it he's got to act he says you hear it he's got to act if he made the promise he's God and has to keep that promise he's God he can't just take it back and say well I was mistaken God makes no mistakes he's perfect amen so if you're resting on the word you can have confidence that God is going to fulfill it he's perfect his first thought is always perfect his first action is always perfect his first word is always perfect he doesn't have to go back and change it we're preaching on the realities of God what does this look like it looks like waiting in faith it looks like believing it looks like trusting that's part of the realities is that something holds you when you don't even think you can hold yourself remember what they said to brother brandham when his wife died and when his daughter died brother brandham did you did you hold on to your religion he said no My Religion held on to me there's something inside of me that won't let go even if I wanted to sometimes our emotions want to let go sometimes our intellect wants to let go but there's something deep on the inside that says I will not let thee go until thou bless me Jacob had no hope of wrestling that angel to the ground but he says I'm not going to let go you're going to have to drag me out of here before I let go because I came here for answers and I'm going to get the blessing that I seek I need a reality of God in my life amen church if you're tired out this morning are you tired out this morning do you feel you've lots of BL do you feel like you've lost the battle this morning stand still hold on to God's word amen hold fast to what God has said he'll never fail that's what believers do they believe the word no matter what comes no matter what circumstances look like amen why it's that word that's inside of us and it's pulsating day in and day out and you know what keeps us strong church it's when we feed the word that's inside of us with the same word amen that that's the thing that will help hold us day by day that'll turn our depression and turn our whininess into praise and joy and Faith cuz Faith is what's going to hold us through all of these things amen this woman she went and she came unto the man of God to Mount Carmel and it came to pass when the man of God saw her a far off that he said to gesia Servant behold Yonder at shunamite run now I pray thee to meet her and say unto her is it well with thee is it well with thy husband is it well with thy child and she answered it Is Well church what kind of Faith are we looking at here she's not willing to throw in the towel until God says it's over it ain't done till it's done it's not over till the prophet says it's over she's going to her access point to God and she says until he says it's over I'm believing that all is well I've got a promise that I've held on to I've lived in the realities of that promise every day with that boy is a miracle and I'm looking for that Miracle to continue because God gave me an air to continue on my family name we see we read our Bibles we see the promises of God and we look and it seems like we're at the end of our rope and nothing's nothing's happening and it's easy to say it's all over church we need to grow a backbone we need to grow a backbone and say it's not over until the word says it over and if the word is given then the word never ends it never fails amen it's about time we got some backbone and Satan started walking back depressed because he says it is really over now because I can't get them off that word and I know what happens when people stay with the word they overcome Hallelujah when they stay with the word they overcome and he walks away saying how am I going to do it now we need him to start walking away from losing some battles amen start coming with some praise and some worship into the battle rather than depression and how's it going to work out how's God going to do it say God is always has made a way through for his children and start testifying of what God has done so you can build yourself up on what he's about to do amen hallelujah Hard Times come our way we ought to meet it with a mouth of praise and worship and faith and trust in his name and in his word listen to this it says and she said did I desire a son of my of my Lord no sorry verse 27 I didn't finish that it says and when she came she says to the servant it's all well and when she came to the man of God to the hill she caught him by the feet but gesi came near to thrust her away and the man of God said let her alone for her soul is vexed within her and the Lord had hid it from me and had not told me then she said did I desire a son of my Lord did I not say Do not deceive me she says I didn't ask for the promise I didn't come to you beseeching this you came to me and you said this is the the word and the promise of the Lord she says and now it's gone I'm broken I'm hurting I'm in pain because you gave and then you took away the thing that you said I was going to have and he said to gesi GT up thy loins and take my staff in thine hand and go thy way if thou meet any man salute him not and if any salute thee answer him not again and lay my staff upon the face of the child and the mother of the child said as the Lord liveth and as thy soul liveth I will not leave thee and he arose and followed her why she said you're the one gave me the son I'm not leaving unless you come with me my trust is not in your servant my trust is not in your Rod my trust is in you as the mouthpiece of God to come and make a change in this situation amen she says you're my only link to life and I'm not letting go until I get life back in my child and gesi passed on before them and laid the staff upon the face of the child but there was neither voice nor hearing wherefore he went again to meet him and told him saying the child is not awakened Church what does Elisha do he sends his servant with his rod and he tells him to touch the boy's Faith with it what does the rod always represent the law and judgment he sends the law ahead it might bring Deliverance but it never brings life the law took the children of Israel out of Egypt but it doesn't restore you back to life legalism can protect you for so long but it does not give you life it can keep a hedge of protection about you but what happens inevitably if you don't get life is you either become a performance-driven Christian where you think that your works are good enough to get you into heaven and you become a Pharisee or you ultimately fail as we all do and you fall away because you fail God legalism is not life it's a protection and in the end what a Believer does is out of the heart not out of of a demand because there's a life inside of us that's calling us to that word amen but watch now what happens and when Elisha was coming into the house behold the child was dead and laid upon his bed and he went in therefore and shut the door upon them Twain and prayed unto the Lord and he went up and lay upon the child okay he prays lays upon the child and put his mouth upon his mouth his eyes upon his eyes and his hands upon his hands and stretched himself upon the child and the Flesh of the child wax warm now notice the initial effect of the prophet's presence it warms him up he stone cold dead he's probably got rigor mortise sitting in he's cold as cold can be in that climate and he lays on the boy and the body warms up but no life comes in we'd say the boy was lukewarm can I put it that way this morning we're we're trying to bring it to the realities of God in our day amen the prophet comes and the prophet's pray presence only warms up the body his first message only warms people up but what happens next says then he returned and walked in the house to and fro see so often we think the prophets have it easy but this Prophet walked the floors walked the floors they don't have it easy we don't have it easy either Church walk the floors what do I do now what do I do now nothing's happening Lord at my prayer nothing's happening I'm your Prophet nothing's happening Brother Braham says it this way he says so away they went and came into the yard and now looked into the crowd everybody around wailing and screaming he says what a place for Faith you cannot depend on the the circumstances to provide you what you have need of you've got to come with what you have need of Amen you've got to be ready in the word you've got to be planted in the word you've got to be settled on who you have believed in that he is able to do that which he's promised to do in your life he says Elisha standing there no vision don't know what to do all he could do was look around he's got no answer the prophet has no answer in himself he needs the Lord to speak he says there was the father screaming there were all the neighbors and everybody carrying on well he goes around to his little old chamber and the woman had the baby laying on the bed so he shut everybody out of the room and P pulled the door together by himself Church you want answers get alone with God that's what he's saying shut out all the noise turn off the phone tell your family don't disturb me for the next two hours and go in there and wait on God Amen we've got to get serious if we want direction if we want leadership if we want healing if we want Deliverance let's make ourselves serious before god let's let him know we want it as much as we say we want it amen if if we're needful of it let's go do it church if we needed money we'd work till our our fingers bled but we won't spend 10 minutes on our knees in prayer he says he went over in a corner and knelt down and began to pray when he got through praying he got up and walked up and down the floor back and forth to and fro up and down the floor until the spirit of God Came Upon him Church we've got to know that God is with us and that means we've got to wait until he's with us we cannot presume we cannot assume we've got to wait on him and when we know he's with us then we can do something in faith otherwise we're going to fail every single time Watch What Happens it says and he went up and stretched himself upon him and the child sneezed seven times and the child opened his eyes he says when the spirit of God come upon him no doubt but what he saw a vision he goes over stretches himself on top of the baby his nose again its nose no prayer no prayer why the word of the Lord has been spoken to him he doesn't have to say anything he just has to do now just the nose against his nose lips against his lips eyes against his eyes hand against his hands and the baby sneezed seven times and come to life he says what was that that wasn't that preacher that was Christ in his Prophet that brought that boy back to life Hallelujah now you notice here it says the child sneezed seven times we're talking about the living in the realities of God we're talking about the word promised for our day and brother bam says two times he says I wish I had time to get into those seven sneezes doesn't say he does or he doesn't he just says I wish I had time to do it but what does a sneeze do this is just me what does a sneeze do it clears out the things that ought not to be in your body it opens up your passageways it allows the Breath of Life to come in uninhibited this is like a little Revival that's going on casting out all those things that are caught in his lungs and in his throat and in his nose and these things amen it flushes out those things that aren't supposed to be in your body we could put it this way Church his starting condition before he died was his Alpha condition he was a young healthy man and then what happens amen he's a perfect manifested promise and then he has what an event that drops him from perfect health almost directly into darkness like that the alpha Church dropped right into darkness the promised word is there signs and wonders God moving in his people and then in just 30 years they drop away there are already wolves among you you've already left your first love and they drop down and they drop down the prophetic presence could only get him warmed up notice when you read in in Ezekiel in the valley of dry bones the prophet's first message could only get the bones and the Flesh and the Senus together but there had to come a second portion there had to come something that followed to bring the breath of life and that's what we see in this boy is we see that there's a first work that brings him to life but there's got to come a second work there's got to come a latter rain there's got to come something behind it that'll bring life back into that body CU it's all Fallen apart amen but his final condition his Omega condition is exactly the same as his Alpha condition he's perfectly healthy he goes down into a temporary sleep and then he wakes up and he's as good as new as if it never happened it will be worth it all when we see Jesus life's trials will seem so small when we see Christ one glimpse of his dear face all Sorrows will erase so bravely run the race till we see Christ that young man had no idea what happened to him all he knew was I was alive and I'm alive again Sovereign work of the power of God inside of his life amen there was no between that promise between the start and the Finish there was just a trial of faith in the middle that's it never had an issue the rest of his life as far as we know he died when he died no doubt old and and typical of all the the rest of the the people of that time but God comes in and by Grace brings them out of that Darkness black back into glorious life says and he called unto gazy and said call the shunamite so he called her and when she was come unto him he said take up thy son then she went in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground and took up her son and went out now we always have the story twist don't we we think this is the story twist remember we read in last service we talked about the the woman with the cruise of oil and and how everything's provided for her and then all of a sudden what happens there's death in the house and she loses the son of her promise the food's not going to run out the food didn't run out but her son died anyway why cuz God's always working on his bride he's always working to show himself real he's always working to help us grow in our faith amen we got to have faith for a resurrection and a Rapture pretty soon church that means he's going to be working in our day-to-day lives amen we should never stop and think this is it we're done we're not done till we're gone and Paul would say this in Philippians he says not as though I had already attained either were already perfect if there's somebody that ought to be perfect to be that prophet he says I don't even look at it but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus in other words he says I want to be what he says I am I don't just want to be satisfied with where I'm at I want to be the Fulfillment of what he says I'm supposed to be and I'm not going to stop until I get there I want to be found fulfilling everything he says about me in his word amen he says Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended Paul spoke with tongues more than them he had signs and wonders following he had the Holy Spirit speaking lip to ear he wrote the majority of the Gospel of the New Testament and he says I don't even look at it don't even dwell on it I'm not resting on that he says I count not myself to have apprehended I haven't made it yet he says I don't act and believe that he says but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth into those things which are before amen we can't rest on our past experiences they're there and they did a job back then but we need an experience today we can't rest on our Laurels we can't rest on our works there has to be a continuation of God in our lives day by day he says one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth into those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus Paul never let off the gas Paul never slacked on his daily devotions Paul never stopped praying that's it I'm good I'm sealed I got the Holy Ghost no let's get forward into what God has for his Believers in this age back in 2 Kings it says then spake Elisha unto the woman whose son had restored to life saying arise and go thou in thine household and sojourn where wheresoever thou can sojourn for the Lord hath called for a famine and it shall also come upon the land seven years now here's more proof she's a gentile because a prophet will not send you out of the land of promise doesn't do it Naomi went out and what did she return as bitter she wasn't supposed to be outside of the land but he says no go out you're not bound there's judgment coming to the people here they Fallen away from the word they've Fallen away from God and so famine is coming you don't have to go through this Hallelujah you don't have to go through the tribulation you don't have to go through the Judgment you can be set aside so go wherever you can and make a living right she's not bound to the Judgment that they're bound to notice now he comes to her she doesn't come to him why she's a friend of the Prophet brother Bram says it's handy to be the friend of a prophet sometimes amen he's not telling everyone this he's just telling her he's telling her the secrets like Jesus said in John he says henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I've made known unto you we're not ignorant we're not ignorant of Satan's devices and we're not ignorant of what God's trying to do in this age that's for sure and then we know what he's doing and so he says and the woman arose and did after the saying of the man of God and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years now we see what's happening here this is God not God protecting the woman this is God protecting his word it's God protecting the promised son it's God protecting the promise that he gave this woman amen and this great Gentile woman with the promises warn get out take all of your household with you but catch the sacrifice because she's a gentile if she leaves it behind she loses it she has no right of redemption she has no right of a kinsman redeemer she's a gentile when it's gone it's gone and he says get out preserve the word preserve the promise go make any way you can make it because you won't last if you stay here there's judgment coming so she's got a she's got wealth she's got a a large farm it would seem a large property she's got tons of money she's got ease of life and all these things and he says walk away if you want to keep the word alive if you want to keep your promise alive set it all aside and go make a living someplace else because there's going to be coming judgment here you know I look around this church this morning and some of us have made some big moves in our lives and I'm not just talking about geography and me I look at sister Morin and I know Sister Brenda's not here they made huge moves to get away from judgment and today even so they still pay a price to a degree with their families because they came and accepted this message why to preserve the word that's it I look around this room we've got Josh here in the back we've got brother Grant and sister Nikki here we've got sister Rebecca just moved here big moves leaving Comfort leaving convenience leaving people you've known for many many years pastors Ministries fellowships have it all maybe and you come here and you got to start all over again hopefully because the Holy Spirit Led you but there's almost always a sacrifice with following the leading of God there's always something we've got to give up and there's always something though that he's going to give us in return amen I look around and church don't let this hurt you this morning but don't let the knowledge of the sacrifice keep you out of the realities of the blessing see we can dwell on what we've lost for so long that we don't get to enjoy what we have right here and we don't see it we don't see it amen and it's hard again I think of sister Moren she was literally pushed away from her family brother Mark was not accepted for 10 years I think 10 years being out just an outcast from your family if she dwell on it it would have driven her insane and she'd have missed the blessings that were all around her if all you can see is loss in following God you've missed the vision and you've absolutely missed the blessing because God is not just a God that gives away takes away he's a God that gives as well you know I miss a lot about being out west in Alberta and BC here I only get to moose hunt on my own tag every three years there I could hunt five species a year every year without fail pretty much Edmonton has over 300 days of sunshine can you imagine Church 300 days of sunshine a year that's three years worth of New Finland Ministries rolling through constantly camps special meetings hundreds of Believers you can find the perfect friend there because there's so many to choose from I've got to settle for Joe no but there's an ease that comes with some of these things but God didn't send us here for ease he sends us for purpose and he sends us for what he has in need of Amen I miss being able to fly my wife out to California for $400 or let her go in the car so she can go see her family I don't have any blood family here I've got family here I believe this is family and you treat me like family and I'm trusting I'm treating you like family but there is a difference at times and we don't have that my kids don't get to see their Grandma all the time barely know my dad there's a price to be paid for following the leadership of the Holy Ghost but there is always always always a greater benefit than a price that's paid god brother Braham says God has no unpaid debts amen I'm a testimony of that this morning you know the scripture says God loves a cheerful Giver God loves a cheerful giver and we look at that as opening up our wallet and putting money into the tith box and the offering box and this is just me okay I think God loves a cheerful sacrifice when he calls you to give up something and you say I'll do it cheerfully I'll let it go for his sake cheerfully not bemoaning my fate not are you kidding me I put so much time and effort no Lord you can have it what did he sacrifice for us cheerfully willingly his own body his own life God loves a cheerful Giver Jesus said in Luke give and it shall be given to you good measure see we give light and FL we just give what we're supposed to give but he says when he gives it back he'll give it in a good measure press down shaken together and running over shall men give into your bosom for with the same measure that you meet with all it shall be measured to you again God has no unpaid debts now watch what he says because he's talking about this little widow woman he says a little woman Widow came by and she only had three pennies all of her living and now what would you have done if you'd have stood there he said you'd see that little woman put them three pennies in you'd run and say oh no sister don't do that don't do that because we got plenty in here and we don't need that more to the point her money she was putting in would not make a lick of difference three mites worthless it's like somebody giving a dollar in tithes don't stop doing it because that's a blessing to you but the simple fact is a dollar and TI is not going to make a difference in this church but you give it nonetheless why because there's a promise behind it weed go to that woman and say sister sister sister you don't need to do it keep your money keep your money you got kids you don't have a husband you got kids all around you keep your money sister we don't need it he says but Jesus never told her not to do it he let her go ahead and do it why because he knew he had something for her down the road a little something better he says you see so he just let her God loves a cheerful Giver it always takes sacrifice to follow the will of God Amen it is not the easy Road remember what he said in Matthew 7 wide is the gate broad is the way that leadth to destruction and many there will be that go therein the easy road is usually not God's Road scripturally speaking and if you look around nobody gets a an easy path to adoption nobody gets an easy path to position to influence to power they don't do it and the ones that do fail and fail and fail and fail because they didn't go through God's program amen but when we can go willingly cheerfully in the way that God calls us though include sacrifice what a blessing he lays out for us Amen on the other side of it so this woman goes away she leaves everything behind gives up all of her wealth and influence and position Great Farm whatever it might be and she walks away it says and it came to pass at the seven years end that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land this is what we said before that she has no kinsman redeemer she has no right to a land every Israelite has a right to the land and they can buy it back at any time she has no rights so she's got to go to the king now what about that son what about the word promise now the word has grown the promise has grown he's a man now he needs an inheritance he needs a place to set down Roots again and she's going to bad and saying now the word has to come into full fulfillment you didn't just give me to him so I could have him but now he's got an inheritance that's supposed to be for him as well I need to get his inheritance from her Jews could always rely if nothing else even without money on the Year of Jubilee but you could always buy it back if you had the money she's has to go to the king for this amen she hasn't got a kinsman redeemer she's not tied into the law but watch what's happening and the King talked with gesi the servant of the man of God saying tell me I pray thee all the great things that Elijah had done and it came to pass as he was telling the King how he have restored a dead body to life that behold the woman whose son he have restored to life cried to the king for her house and for her land and gesi said oh Lord my king oh King my Lord oh King this is the woman and this is her son whom Elisha restored to Life Church there's no uh there there there there's no uh coin Co inces in the life of a Believer Amen brother Vel there's no coincidences with meetings that you're not supposed to be in there's no coincidence as we run into people we run into situations and we say well that was handy who' have thought God thought God knew God placed you God placed them whatever it might be God has set things up he ordains the footsteps of his children the gahaz is there talking the king king says hey tell me about Elisha tell me all the great things he's done gy says well the greatest thing I've ever seen is that he he he raised a dead boy to life and this woman comes in he says there's the woman that's her you can ask her there's the son there's the proof ask them all about it they'll tell you and this woman comes in with a need right as the king is listening to her testimony Hallelujah the very day she makes her petition is the day that the king is talking about her says and the King asked the woman and when the king asked the woman she told him she gave her testimony and so the king appointed unto her a certain officer saying restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the field since the day she left the land even until now Hallelujah he doesn't say she gets the land now he says she gets every benefit that she lost when she obeyed the the prophet when she listened to the word when she put the word first when she put the promise first everything hallelujah oh my everything every benefit plus interest she gets it all there will not be a single thing missing when we go over there church there is nothing that he will hold back from them that he loves she has no reasonable right to expect this she just wants her lands back he says give her everything she ever would would have had if she hadn't obeyed the prophet what a place we stand in this morning church as Sons and Daughters of God called elected seed bride there's not going to be a one thing missing that you gave up that he doesn't give you remember the disciples said have not we left family and homes and Friends he says there'll be a h hundredfold given to you here and in the Kingdom to come why because you gave it up for my sake you listen to the call she had lost everything her way of making a living she' lost her husband by this point it's just her and the promised son she has no right to anything and in the presence of the king see Church she's moved from the prophet to a King now that Bride Comes To The King and she says I'm here for my inheritance and he says a certain officer is given to her to enforce her rights on the title told deed hallelujah what does he do he sends the Holy Ghost and he says you got to give it back everything that you lost you've got to give it back why she's the faith Seed of Abraham she was not in the bloodline but she was in the bloodline Hallelujah and by faith she obeyed and she went out and she came back and she got everything she missed plus everything amen everything she was owed everything she lost is back in her place butam says this as we start to close and so it is now with the people all that the Winter's coldness of cold former religion killed out there the nearing of the Son of God in these last days coming to his church restores it back to life again this is restoration of the brid tree he says I will restore sayeth the Lord see God restores his flowers his leaves his nature his seed of the earth and therefore we know then that God will restore also his habitation says ye are an house builder for God know you not that you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost he will restore his Eden he will restore everything that death killed that's right now the only way it can ever remain dead is let it lay in the wrong place that's something we have to change sometimes is we've got to let him move us to where we can grow and prosper in the word Amen brother Josh is leaving to go do that sister Rebecca is coming to do that amen that's the way God moves Sovereign to the individual and all we can do is say praise the Lord he says Let It lay in the wrong place he says but if it falls in the right place it's got to come back to life again he says so God let us fall in the right channel that's right for what a restoration what's the right channel Church what' the Prophet come to do restore us to the word he would say get back to the word get back to the word get back to God get back to God get out of the systems get out of the organizations get out of the denominations come back to the purity of the sovereignty of the word of God and let that do a work put the word in preeminence and then sit back and watch what God does cuz when you put him in preeminence that's when everything else comes into place amen seek ye first the kingdom of God brother BR puts it this way as we close give me a preacher give me a Christian we have some Christians here this morning give me a housewife that's a Christian give me a farmer or factory worker that will put God first in everything I'll show you a man will be successful in spite of all the devil can put on him why he seeks God first Hallelujah let's stand this morning amen God restored the woman's promise it's not just the woman now it's not just the the son but it's the inheritance that they lost as well he's giving them the everything they always had and all the benefits of what they lost they've come now in the presence of a king and that's where we've come as a bride we've come in the presence of a king we don't go to a prophet now that's what people did for so long with brother Bram I believe that's why he had to go on was because we were stopping at Eleazar instead of going into the tent with Isaac amen but now we're in the we're in the presence of the king and like we talked about Esther he's extended his scepter of Grace and says whatever you want up to half the kingdom we'll go splitsies on it you can have half whatever you have need of I'll give it to you that's the unmerited favor and Grace that he's extended to the bride this morning amen the king says I will restore rest I will restore you know what that means Church you can't have a restoration if you haven't lost something and sometimes that's where we've got to be honest and say I've lost something sometimes we've lost like David the joy of our Salvation sometimes we lost our peace sometimes we've lost our rest sometimes we've lost our health sometimes we've lost our Direction we've got to go back to the king and say would you restore it would you restore it I've lost my North Star I've lost that rock in a weary land I don't know where I'm at but I'm trying to keep your word and I want to put your word in preeminence and when you do that he steps in he says I'll do anything you ask me to do because when the word's in preeminence you'll ask according to the word amen and that takes you right into the perfect will of God God Amen sometimes our Miracle is to get something sometimes our Miracle is to hold on to something amen it's no different it's the same God it's the same Faith it's the same strength but he's there to do above and beyond what we could ever ask or think amen what put the word first come into His presence and Trust what God will do amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord You're known by many names Lord but you are Jehovah Gyra to us this morning Lord God Lord that you don't just provide the need but
