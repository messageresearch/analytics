we're left with the impression that the building is full when it's not a man thank God that the recording is on the right side not on the wrong side Amen not on the left because the seats are empty amen this is amazing so every time we need to be impress it's in this time while all these things are going on and pray the grace of God for the for the bride the grace of God for the sons and daughters of God the grace of God for the elect well you see we're brothers you know this is this is for believers you know and it starts to test our faith yeah it does test test our faith but again you go back 2,000 years ago when the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost and the church in the first stage where the Bible says they went from house to house and they gathered and fellowship but we're not allowed to do that you know really loud just a few here in the in the in the congregation a few in the in the in the church and we're not allowed even to go and fellowship one with another you know just maybe two families are together or whatever and and so on so brother as is the test of our faith alright let's see if we're going to maintain our faith stay with the word and he-man stay with the promise of God and say well I believe so I'm not going to let the devil deceive me I'm not gonna let the devil hinder me I'm gonna keep pressing on a man and force I guess for some it's it's a lonely existence because you're you know you don't have the fellowship you don't have you're not ain't not allowed to go here go there no no not by any means so but we pray the grace of God be with us and take us through this trial amen the grace of God be with us and help us brother and again brother and you know again God is God is testing our faith God is testing our hunger and our thirst for him God is testing our thirst for our thirst for for the word our hunger thirst for fellowship a man are longer thirst for Jesus a man that's that's exactly the truth because if you hunger thirst for Jesus you want to get together with the body of Jesus by the grace of God so brother God God sees our faith and God sees our actions and our reactions to to what's going on in the world concerning this guest to call it pandemic and so on and it's amazing yeah it's amazing I guess it's not something that we were really expecting but maybe it's could be something that the prophet of God would it would have told us he knew that there was things going to happen but he said it will be in my heart he said when I go to my grave he wouldn't tell us he would tell us this was going to happen that was going to happen and what else is going to happen well there's going to be other things happen in the world too but it's going to test your faith to see if you're going to stay with the word a man and and the prophet of God did say the hour is coming when we won't be allowed he said to pray for the sick we won't be allowed to do this won't be allowed to do that so we pray the grace of God to help us amen to stay with the word and there's something somewhere a prophecy concerning that you know we might be out there in the street somewhere in a corner to to to fellowship or the minister or to do this or to do that yeah so I pray the grace of God give us his wisdom and his anointing rather an hour that we need is anointing it's now and listen this is not 10 years ago this is not 30 40 50 I can guarantee that because that anointing that was in the atmosphere then is not in the atmosphere now brother because it has been narrowed down and narrowed down to where to our hearts the anointing in our hearts this is what's going to keep us moving back back years ago the anointing way oh yeah Luther had in his heart but it was also in the atmosphere a man if you walked into Luther's and lose his presence you would feel the anointing a man not just Luther was feeling it you you would sense it and was all around everywhere and this is how that John Wesley came to what he did revelation that God gave him because II was in a Martin Luther cottage meeting he was yes he was and there was a brother preaching that believed what Martin Luther preached Martin Luther had gone home and now here was John Wesley the next messenger rising on the scene and he needed a revelation hey oh yeah he believed this need believe that and like Martin Luther he was what he was doing his works you know Martin Luther believed if he if he did this did that did that he'd be justified and to finally got the revelation that he justified by faith in Jesus Christ and Christ justified him a man always struck Martin Luther or what a revelation a man that he had and so in a Martin Luther cottage meeting a man and brother that's where I got a lot of revelation with in a cottage meeting and Martin Luther was in a cottage minion oh yeah and and the brother was preaching and just just as justified by faith and that's where it struck Martin Luther he was sanctified by faith because like Luther John John Wesley and then the Methodists they were would do he works or if I were if I do this if I do that and I do that I'll be just I'll be sanctified oh yeah I'll be sanctified and uh finally he was there and he was worse with me and he was stood up and and he was hearing the word and and it finally struck him or justified by thing I'm sanctified by faith it's my pain and it went as I said it went from the crown of his head right to the soles of his feet he found that anointing moving not just and I was really not just in him now but it was in the audience it was in the in in the atmosphere oh yeah in the cottage amen and the anointing was on the preacher it was on on the others there and it was on John Wesley and he finally struck him I'm sanctified by faith a man and he went forth with the revelation for that for that church age praise the name of the Lord so brother the the anointing is with us the anointing in us I pray grace and now as I said more and more the anointing was with them there did not just in them but it was with them they had that power at the end that anointing and those that met them they they they if they were believers and they were they had any Christian experience they would know oh there's something about that Martin Luther there's something about John Wesley there's something about the Methodists there's something about the Lutheran's those that believed and had received that faith there was an anointing in them and it was all around them they created an atmosphere they created an atmosphere and brother it was a time when believers used to create an atmosphere but not so much now as it used to be all mine we go into a into a cottage meeting we go and meet brothers and sisters just in their homes and fellowship with them there was an anointing there as I said when we first came to this message even when I went to be or maybe in 1970 or 71 and I went to Bjorn - to our 1969 dude because why because sister Golding was witnessing to family and friends in Bern concerning the message of the hour and they caller said what's this all about you know and she sent them the message of the spoken word message of the prophet a man certain messages to her sister and her brother-in-law and and what did he do did he read it no he didn't read it just listen amen god help us a man and what did he do with it well he went into his what we would call a while I don't know what it was in his kitchen and off the kitchen there was the cupboards and where they would wash their dishes and everything and where they put their food and there was a window there and above the window there was a shelf yeah and he took those books that Citra Kolya said them the spoken word books and he laid them up on top of the shelf and he didn't read them he just looked at the Oh william branham and and then maybe the titles of the message and left him there yeah but how did he get to the revelation of it well he had a border that it that was living with him and I guess attending the not dear it's a college a college there tending a college and and he was he was bordering paying to stay at brother Smiths and he was Pentecostal and any I think he was going on to eventually a Pentecostal pastor but err he was and he was at the sink there and he was washing something and he looked up and he saw the books and so he took the books down he looked at it william branham oh no their of their followers are William Brennan you know more about William Brown then then our then our brother or sister Smith did at the time a man and he so he went in there that's what happened he went in a report on it that they were followers of William Branham because they were getting together they were having cottage meetings but not listen you do with him random they were listening to Jack Cole they're listening to Jack Cole's records yeah it may it's absolutely amazing just here little the Lord just to give this witness and give this testimony and so when they got together for a cottage meeting and with brother Charlie and he went on when he was only 33 when he went on to be with the Lord and they were having cottage means in his love and listening to listening to say Jack Jo was Jack Cole listen to him on record listen to my records and and they and that this this young brother thought it was listening to Elam brain'll and he went and reported it and said they were message believers and they believe William Branham and they were gathering together and cottage meetings and listening to Willie rattle but it was Jack Cole and brother and of course they attended the same Pentecostal church and of course that's when they called they called a special meeting and they called brother and sister Smith and three or four other those are the Saints they're all gone on now and they called him in into this special meeting and oh they were shocked when when they when they were being judged for following the message of William Branham and they didn't they didn't know about William Branham they didn't know what he was teaching they didn't know these things yeah but there but they just asked brother brother Smith one question and they said brother Smith and he said yes sir and he stood up and he said got one question okay said he said do you believe in the Trinity and he thought they were believing brother Brown was teaching on to Trinity but they didn't know what william branham taught they had no idea and he said Willie so I believe the Bible he said the Father the Son the Holy Ghost and he said these three are one and so on so he says what I believe so and oh they they're you're this you're that well eventually before the surf was over they were put out of the church because they took their stand for the word even though they didn't realize it was William Branham but they took their stand for the word and after that brothers sister they went back to the message and God it's hard to get into the message and they called sister Goldie and they said what's this message all about we like to know because we just been kicked out of the church for it and they were for that of the church for it and and and and there was of course sister Donna was there too at that meeting and there was a brother Brown there and he's gone on for many years now and he was at that meeting and our brother sister brush it and they were at that meeting so we thank God the EEC God God does it one way we do it another but we got we got a we got a we got to know God's ways and his ways are he's no wonder God said my ways are not yours and he said my thoughts not yours and so on it's right as I as the heavens are above the earth so are my ways and thoughts above yours and that's the truth that exactly the truth brother and God proved it in calling out our brother and sister Smith and the Buren fellowship at the time God proved it in calling us out him in in gamble oh yeah because he even even even in gamble brother they weren't really following the message with a random when they were put out of Pentecost they were nondenominational they were following people like a a alan and TL Osborn and so on and they were question concerning the faith and what they believe you don't believe this you know but had they said no we don't believe in denominations no anyway that when they came out of that they finally came to the message not long after that oh yeah someone someone mentioned him but William Brenda Oh what did William Graham say and that's and all triggered it triggered their faith and they got into the message by the grace of God see God's ways are not our ways see God I got out of God out of purpose in bringing them out of denomination to bring them into the message amen he didn't bring into the message and out of denomination he brought him out of denomination into the message by the grace of God so it's absolutely amazing what God does and how God does it amen oh yeah and and even did there's others too I know another sister that's gone on god rest her soul god bless her a man and she case she was she left Pentecost come to them G and leave it they put her out and again there wasn't B she didn't come with many costs because he didn't come to the message because all I saw the message so I'll leave denomination no no she saw things in denomination that she knew wasn't right and it wasn't the Lord a man it was she said this is not the way God does things I don't agree with this and she tried to stop it but they voted her out and she was a neighbor of mr. burns and a man and she came from set came to visit sister Birds and she was she was sorted down and sister Burns was there to encourage her not to press the message on her just to encourage her that's all right sister God is not in in in that no more and so on God is in his word oh and sister the sister said oh why did what do you mean and she began to explain things to her and that opened her heart and soul to the word and she came to the message well I believe that she said he's right amen brother Branham is right she said I agree with it even though she was she put she was put out why because of her stand for the word but not the message at the time but she came to the message after a man and she and the Lord took her on few years later she was with us in the cottage meetings worshipping and praising God a man and and she was diagnosed where the cancer going to die and brother Manuel was preaching there one time and he and he made reference to it and touched on it that's regarding our sister there was going to die and he and he he felt you know maybe that after that maybe it was hard for him to say what he said or to highlight it and maybe thin not thinking that she knew about it and I don't think she did and he said I didn't mean to do this that's certain brother she said listen she said death has no terrorist to the blood but one that was her faith a man I remember now when she was sitting behind me in the cottage meaning to God be the glory so brother God give us faith God increase our faith by his word God increased our faith by his message amen brother he brought me from one to another to Pentecost or from Pentecost to the message a man well this God doing why are we here tonight where are the others listening online to the message tonight why is because God has increased our faith a man we went from faith to faith the faith to greater faith in a greater faith and now that we're even and go what going from one one church to another Church to another Church to the message of the hour and now in the message we're going from faith to faith to faith a man God is increasing our faith by the grace of God because we got to go move on to a greater faith we got to move on to a resurrection enrapturing faith brothers ever of faith that God is looking for in this hour he's living for the faith in the resurrection he's looking for the faith in the rapture do we believe it amen that's the thing that God wants a mad house should be confessing that's the thing that God wants us to be putting the emphasis on it's not just a message of the hour of this doctor of the adoption but the resurrection and the rapture is two getting out of here by the grace of God amen this not list not what's going on in the world today don't let that get our get our attention to the extent that it's going to it's going to pull us away from what God wants us to focus on amen no matter what's going on in the world let's keep our focus on the resurrection and the rapture amen no matter how much the devil is trying to do to distract us from this revelation let's stay with the word and let's stay with the purpose that God is working out in you and me and brother we know what he was working out in Luther and Wesley and the Pentecostals and other churches what's he working out in you and me it's the resurrection and the rapture amen because it may men that our testimony be thus so that there will be a generation left behind that's going to say I thought there was to be a rapture it already happened they didn't know it I trust by the grace of God that they'll miss you and me a man that you and me we won't be here because we'll be gone in the rapture by the grace of Almighty God so brother God's got a mystery of the way he's gonna do it how he's gonna do it anybody but there's you again there's gonna be so few missing they're not into we're not there's not many gonna be missed well where is this one where's that one oh no doubt their God here they're gone they're somewhere but then but there's very few will say well where's the rapture yeah that's already happened and you didn't know it it'll strike them so god help us brother if we get to the word a man not mean to take all that time a man but just to share with you that that experience that that testimony a man to let you know is God him and revealed in simplicity a man it most definitely was if you were to go to see see it in burn if you were to see it in gamble you the city even a central new plan when it started it was God in simplicity amen then I can tell you there what happening in central no fillet or did they stride this church that church listen brother one of the men the one that really started it was brother William brother Manuel and any any you he was listening to brother ground States even when he went to a denominational Church listening to the tapes and he than sister Manuel what did she do she would give him those she buy bited by William branham's sermons the the reel-to-reel tapes she

the grace of God oh yeah play the tape and we had wonderful we had a wonderful time of fellowship and it was in sister Goulding's house amen I can still remember by the grace of God any man God hidden and God revealed in simplicity that's right and you know how did we come to understand to know about them in central did we find them ourselves no no not by any means it's just that brother Barnes went into a store there and the owner of that store which I know right now and that person did ask me a Bible question when we were sitting in a certain church and I where I pray the God rest his soul

bless his turn with me to Revelation chapter 3 Revelation chapter 3 and we'll read the scripture and the explanation of what brought the church to this time of anointed ones at the end time a man what did the Anointed One said the end time produce what was the church what was their spirit a man what was their action their reaction so we pray the grace of God to give us understanding a man and the Lord Williams have already been maybe hour a half an hour or so will see us see whether where the Lord will lead us into trying to get some thoughts as I said that the Prophet Express in the message the anointing once at the end time and to give us the true understanding and to put us on our guard and I think that if there's any message again that the Prophet preached to put us on our guard it would be in the anointing once at the end time a man so we're not just going to go go by the anointing and say that brother is anointed that sister is anointed so I'll believe there I believe that part brother that sister and I'll just I'll follow them and I believe what they say and so I know we got to judge all those things by the word amen bring it back to the world and when we witnessed the anointing let's make sure that the anointing is going to be in agreement with the Word of God a man grace of God are not be with us and in Revelation chapter 3 and verse 14 and unto the Angel of the Church of the lauda seon's write these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness a man not a false witness but the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God a man I know thy works God knows our works will trust my grace that is my faith that pleases God a man that your works my works is based on a faith that pleases God a man that were not false anointed ones but they are true anointed once a man and again we know that even the false enlightened ones ahead has got a genuine only ghost anointing but a false teaching so buddy if you were if you're a true a ninety-one you got the true teaching of the word of God a man you're going to reflect the word I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would thou wert cold or odd but they're lukewarm yeah because they're in the middle the grace of God that we're not in the middle and we're not cold but grace of God that were hot filled with the Holy Ghost a man so then because thou art lukewarm neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked is amazing amazing that they could be in that condition oh yeah and here is the a man of God the faithful and true witness bearing witness to them concerning himself and his word because I sensed oh I'm rich and increased with Goods I got need of nothing and he said but they don't know that they are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked god forbid that we should get to that place god forbid that we should be in that person in that condition a man although we think we're in the word we think we're in the message we but again like the prophets Edgar the message is not in you a man and that's why he could say that they were in this condition and he said you don't know he said your wretched miserable poor blind and naked oh because although I believe this I believe that they felt they were in the will of God but they're out of the will of God a man and they were wretched in the eyes of God so now what you are your eyes what are you wearing the eyes of God a man again looking looking to the mirror of the word and don't deny what you're seeing a man the testimony of the word regarding you and again I'll never forget our brother Perry green there preached on that many many years ago and I still got the tape where he braced on it and he talked about going good movie now out somewhere and he said right on the side there was a mirror and he looked in the mirror and it struck him concerning the scripture a man don't break the mirror a man leave the mirror held of the revealed word and many have broken the mirror of the revealed word today and that's why they're going that a living this way doing this doing this doing that and they still feel that they're believers but they're not because they're denying what they're seeing in the revelation of the word denying where they're seen in the mirror of the revealed word they they feel that they are this because I believe this and again is all by the doctrine but what about the spirit a man you've got to know your anointing you got to make sure make your calling and election sure and has to make sure of your anointing that you got the right anointing because they saw this but when Jesus looked down he said your wretched your miserable amazing and you're poor and you're blind and naked we think we're Richmond in the revealed Word oh yeah not only physically but we're thinking we're rich in the revealed Word we're rich they're rich they're and so I got this I got that but in the eyes of God they're wretched oh I'm wonderful no I'm not are you looking in the eyes of God through the eyes of God or your own eyes amen grace brother then the anointing the anointing can give us to reveal word but brother whatever it's in our heads but the prophecy is not in the heart he may that's right he said again let me repeat it he said you're in the message but the message is not in you hey babe and there are many other in the message but the message is not in them I know that by their attitude I know that by their Spirit amen I know that by how they lived their actions and their reactions in the Holy Ghost is not in them it's not Christ you get this reaction what's wrong with that person you get that reaction what's that wrong with that brother what's wrong with that sister where's the Holy Ghost amen brother if we got the Holy Ghost it is Christ in us and we're going to have Christ's reaction amen and look at Christ's reaction even and get cemani not my will father don't be done anybody he gave himself up to endure all things for the elects sake for the words sake a man so brother sister grace that we are by the grace of God they were not miserable they were not poor we're not blind were not naked let's follow his counsel and he said to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou may s be rich and he said wait raiment that thou may s be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear praise the Lord grace of God and it says an anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that thou mayst see a man not your brother's not the brain and 9 your eyes that you're going to see the things of God the way God want you to see it a man for he said as many as I love I rebuke and chasten when was God chasing you that's God rebuke you any my brother's sometimes in our daily lives we're experiencing the tracing of God and the rebuke of the Lord amen then maybe we'll step in a line there and got a rebuke us amen to bring us back in line again and God will chasten us to bring us back in line again by the grace of God amen so it's not my will Lord your will be done so it's not me their lives it's Christ that liveth in me by the grace of God so as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent don't just repent casually the be zealous or a bazzill in your old God forgive me please Jesus please forgive me hey man grace give me more of your life so lord I'll stay with the word amen the old I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me grace that were in fellowship with Jesus wonderful to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm set down with my father in his throne he that ever there the year of the soul let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches God bless his words you may be seated amen brother how many are zealous in their repentance brother in your initial repentance that brings you in as a son of God as a daughter of God as a Christian your repentance with my verses repent and be baptized in his name brother that doesn't mean say Oh Lord I'm sorry that was it no it's being sueded you're going to repent zealously amen you're gonna be really serious in your repentance acknowledging that you are apps you were born in sin you were saved in iniquity you come to the world speaking lies and brother when you get to when you get the revelation of repentance amen brother it's not a casual thing it's not a religious thing it is a spiritual conviction in your heart and in your soul and whether you're going to repent with tears and Lord forgive me Lord yes Lord that's me I was born in sin i was shaped in iniquity i come to the world speaking life forgive me lord i was the absolute opposite of the righteousness as you're looking for and lord i I'm sorry forgive me and I received Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior because without him I lost without him there's no hold for me so Lord die I thank you for what you did amen and lay down your life for me amen just think he laid down his life for you and you know it ought to bring upstairs amen in other caused us to cry in other causes to weep a man in our repentance when we consider the place that he paid to redeem us what he suffered to redeem us what he endured to redeem us just think brother sister what he what he suffered as Jesus in the flesh I'm being rejected by this were rejected by that one and what he suffered when they are when he was betrayed by Judas yeah amen and the power of God brings that I went to come through the anointing was at the end time and he said here is Jesus The Anointed One and here is Judas and he said he was anointed because Jesus was anointed them and he went out and did his signs and wonders they healed the sick they raised the dead and Judas was among them and understand this there's very very very little said about Judas in the Bible just that he was naive was identified as a disciple and again a a is highlighted when it comes to the betrayal of Jesus amen but Jesus knew who he was he knew who was going to betray him amen because they went when he served the Last Supper there and and he turned to Judas he said what you do is to do quickly a man and a man this is must have struck Judas and again I believe maybe Judas knew and Jesus knew a man Jesus discerned the spear that was in Jonas and no doubt Judas maybe knew that Jesus knew him but yet he was among the 12 disciples that Jesus sent out with the anointing amen and they came back and testified or we did this we did that and so on and Judas was among them there is there's no where where where the Bible separates Judas to say that Judas was there so Judas was that and Judas said this spirit of that spirit brother as I have said before the one that is highlighted among the disciples more than anyone else it's Peter Peter Peter Peter was there to say this Peter was here to say that and when Jesus said this gee Peter stood up and Peter Peter said this wanted to stop this and stop that and I know that Jesus had to turn to Peter and say get thee behind me Satan a man so what he was under he was under the annoy of the revealed word to recognize Christ as Messiah but brother is also in the United order of sub judice of Jeff of Satan rather a million what for to prevent Jesus from doing what he was ordained to do in going to Jerusalem and he and he was trying to stop Jesus from going to Jerusalem and Jesus said get behind me Satan he knew it was Satan's annuity on Peter a million because Satan knew what Jesus was going to do when he got to Jerusalem and brother Tommy the devil knowing that brother that a that he is power his anointing was going to be weakened amen when Jesus would lay down his life and pick it up again a man Satan had the power over death hell the grave and Jesus was going to conquer it amen amen praise the Lord and when he when he came back on the day of the resurrection that is the Saints that where they were locked away and the Saints they were they were imprisoned there in death Jesus brought with him amen because he opened the gate and he said come on I should have said you free and he rebuked the devil and he said I'm going to take the key of hell and of death amen he rebuked the devil brother neros and they conquered death hell and the grave for the believer he conquered death hell and the grave for the elect of God and brother he proved it when the saints of God the Old Testament Saints arose with him and they went into the city and appeared on too many amen again though that may be why then the prophet of God as I later that the Saints of the New Testament are going to rise from the day and they're going to appear to the living Saints by the grace of Almighty God amen and the prophet of God said we're going to be changed in a moment between them and I and with them we're going to be caught up to meet the Lord in the end or in the rapture amen he said we get together - he said in that dimension and in the slum where the prophet of God did say thirty to forty days and I'm still looking for that that quote and and then he said after that he said we're going to be cut looking we're going to look up and he said there he said there's Jesus why the pillar of fire would go up and get the body and get into the body of Jesus had come down to receive us unto himself amen praise the name of the Lord for the marriage supper of the lamb and we look up oh there's Jesus and we're going to rise to meet him he comes down we go up amen to the marriage supper of the lamb by the grace of Almighty God so God help us in this day and in this hour brother sister that we're not going to miss that revelation when are they going to miss what God has done what God is doing brother to get us into that bride material amen so brother that we know we're braids brother I'd say that God got out of us that we're not going to be deceived by the end by the false anointed ones at the end time just because we got the anointing I feel this and I feel that yeah and I and I believe the word I believe this that message that message this doctrine of that doctrine but when it comes to influencing your everyday living brother or no then then they'll prove you're talking about a false anointed one not a probe not the false anointing but the false person in their teaching in their actions and in their reactions amen oh they they they they could they say well I believe the message I believe this I believe that but brother it's in their heads but not in their hearts Amen because it was in the heart that it's Kalei it's going to take control and all your life you could have take control of your spirit take control of your mind and it's going to bring it all subject to the Word of God it'll bring your subject to the will of God for your for the day of the hour that you're living in amen brother took control of our Luther it took control of Wesley and brother we'll all praise the Lord and they went forth and they lived that justified light they went more than they'd the sanctified life and the Pentecostals went for the lay of the Pentecostal light where there were the gifts of the Spirit amen that was there on the day of Pentecost amen now that wasn't the resurrect that wasn't the rapture they were a man that was God bringing us on to perfection amen he revealed this to Luther that diversely that to the Salvation Army there to other churches and to finally the Pentecostals a made and after the end the Pentecostals brother went around the world in a way that Luther's message didn't go in a way that Wesley says he didn't go but the Pentecostal mercy went around the world amen brother and they were all shocked and even the religious people non religious people they were shocked at Pentecost is their Pentecost is there it's in that country it's got over there it's got over there oh my why because what brother was game was getting closer and closer to the resurrection getting closer and closer to the rapture amen and that's why the prophet of God said that the message of the hour and the ministry of Malachi 4 was the capstone of the Pentecostal message amen what happened after Luther was the capstone of his message and happened after Wesley and the Bayon and the others and the Pentecostals brother the curbstone of the Pentecost are not the bangles but the capstone of what God was doing in there taking them on to the capstone but brother when God brought the capstone on the same they rejected it oh yeah they rejected it brother la lista they were they were there were Methodists they believed Luther and went on with Wesley but again there was there were those I believe Luther's message that wouldn't go on to Wesley and they're those say oh yeah then there are those that believe the Pentecostal message of Lutheran's and Methodists and they went on with the bedycasa 'ls but they're also they were still Lutheran's they're still Methodists dan there are still other churches that would not believe the Pentecostal revival and move on with the pedicle revival they wouldn't do it no no but again the elect of God moved on the seat of God moved on and brother brother hallelujah praise the Lord and that's what you and I are here amen God is moving us on to perfection God add the predestinated seat in Luther's day Wesley stay the Pentecostal day got a debride native seed brother a man to bring this do you and me to this place a million it was their predestinated seed of God amen amen that God was going to raise up to believe the message of the hour there was a generation a man that did come out of Pentecost there was a generation that did believe the Prophet they did believe the message of the hour a man to the extent that God had revealed it in that day a man that the problem of God was preaching preaching preaching and they didn't understand at all the part of the God said I know he said you know you're not getting it he said it's because he says not striking me the way that it should well what did he mean by that not striking him the way that it should well to strike us the way that it should is going to produce the resurrection and the rapture and he said but he said is not the hour and he knew that it was going to rise a generation that it would strengthen the way that it should and it would produced the resurrection but if the rapture I pray the grace of God that we are that generation because listen the part of God even before God took him off the scene he was talking to her brother concerning the word and concerning the message of the hour and what God had done what God was doing and whether or not that generation was seeing all that God had done and why God did it and what is God doing and the powder God said brother he said the older generation eration around the message now he said they will not see it and he said they will not catch it that way but there's a generation rising and he said that's going to it's going to strike them the right way there's a generation that's rising that's going to catch it and they're going to see with a generation back there in 1965 in the 1960s whether they never got it no no no they just dated knew God has said a prophet and thus and the mysteries of God was revealed but when it comes to seeing the resurrection of Raftery faith it wasn't striking them and it wasn't under the 1990 70 90 70 72 73 the other day that God began to get the people and brother a watt into the message a man not not to bring them around the message and to identify with the message amen my brother he began to bring them into the message and the message in them any man to make the word fleshing them to give their in the faith that they needed old brothers sister if God didn't do that in nineteen seventy seventy two around their brother and that's whereas when what what happened there brother the ministry are upon till that hour the ministry was preaching goddess and a prophet goddess and a father to goddess at a profit and they went around the world preaching God has sent a prophet a man oh yeah and I know I've heard this pretty sure I've heard that preacher this brother that brother a man and well they didn't preach this to know because the way God didn't want them to preach it then it wasn't ordained for to strike them then a man so they they all that was ordained all they what God wanted to be a witness he wanted to be a witness say that Malachi 4 was fulfilled in that God has sent a prophet a man to turn our hearts back to the original Word a man but not to the extent of the faith that he was looking for the rapture the resurrection a man and brother and any they oh yeah sure they that generation believe that God has sent a prophet and that the mystery of God was revealed and then the word was was writ was was was revealed the seven seals are revealed but when it comes to getting into the revelation of the seven seals the revelation of the mystery of God to get the faith that we needed for this hour they didn't have it no no they weren't ordained to get it as the Provost said they will not but there will arise a generation and as I say there wasn't on two ninety seventy seventy two around there that they begin to get into the message and there was a brother that was rising around the message then there was other brethren that caught what he was saying and then they went forth and say oh what's the message he said with now he said we know there was a messenger he said they said because God said I'll send you Elijah the prophet and he'll do this and he'll do that yeah but what is what's what's the faith in it what is the faith that God is looking for in me now that he is right now that the populists on that now that the word is revealed what is God looking for innate whether it's God looking for in you by the grace of Almighty God amen and one of those preachers I want mine saying who is he's gone on for many years now and it's our brotherly veil and he said well he said we now we know there was a messenger but what is the message Amen what is the message exactly so many many are acknowledging the messenger many are knowledge and even the fact that all the seven seals to reveal revelation 10 is fulfilled and so on but they're not getting into the message then I getting into the revelation that God wants them to hear God wants them to say God wants them to manifest the faith a man of that mystery they made it praise the name of the Lord and away and brother was in the early 1970s as that brother Bo yeah he was criticized by a lot of believers and not only him but many other preachers were criticized by so-called believers honor their teaching this their teaching this to teaching that they were trying to get the believers to get the braids into the word a man and get the word in the bright praise the name of the Lord not they that were around the word and the message was around us let's get into the word and get the word in us a man and in that if that is the teaching we got to get into the teaching and get into the teaching and acknowledge this acknowledge that God has done this I got it God has done that amen so brother sister than God looking for me looking to have that faith in me looking at that faith in you and so on so brother and now God is looking for us to have a faith that they never had even ten years ago or a paid that they never had as fleshly 50 years ago or a time when the problem of God was called off the same brother what faith do I have compared to the faith that they had what they do I have compared to the faith of Eddie yes even in nineteen sixty or sixty-five or 1970 Amen brother I tell you this as I said I come to this word in 1966 that's when I was baptized in the river in the bitter Falls River a man and again I might have been in December a yo December 1965 I was baptized in the name of the titles in the Pentecostal church oh yeah it's like I can remember that now and brother and going up there behind the behind the the the the platform because I used to sit on the platform singing in the choir you did oh yeah I did I was singing in the choir there oh yeah I remember looking down oh yeah when there was a certain church that that I started in that church when it was on KC Street and that ability to still there but it's not a church and I went to that church when they built the new one yeah I was on the platform when they dedicated the new one I was on the platform with when they took up a donated took up the offering and I believe it was six or seven thousand dollars yeah amazing the church was full and when they took up the donation it they took up six or seven thousand dollars and that was a lot of money for that day yeah and I remember Sunday platform standing up and singing and I believe yeah and I sure you believe it but I believe that I had that I was singing higher than all the rest I believe that I was singing louder than all the rest because when I opened my eyes and I looked at the song leader at all I said I must be disturbing everybody because I don't know what we were singing but I was singing loud I were screaming a man not just so I'm a member of the choir so I'm gonna I'm not gonna sing any higher than this I'm not gonna sing no louder than the dis and so on no it was for the glory of God amen nobody mentioned it but I didn't go back into the choir and and by the grace of God I was still in that church I stayed in that church I was there on Wednesdays when they made their bread made their broadcasts and recorded their broadcast returned and it was and is still on the radio oh yeah they still it's been on over 50 years yeah maybe 60 or 70 years that has been honest on a Sunday morning service amen and it's still there and I and again as I said I was baptized using the titles in 1965 in that church yeah and I believe it might have been that might have been the pastor of the Church of the time they baptized me a million but then in the early 1966 you know I was in fellowship with the but with the brothers in gamble I was in fellowship with with the cottage means in gamble I didn't know anybody in central new plant at the time but a man I just yeah but I know it was in June June or July yeah that's when I got the gamble for a holiday and sister Goulding called me on the phone I call sister goalie and she said Oh our brother Joel I got some good news and I said what's that she said God has set up off it and I said oh I said is that right well yes she said wonderful a man is a 20th century prophet she said amen to call her the bride in this hour in this age for the resurrection and rapture always said praise the Lord Amen praise the Lord we were nondenominational a man we're having cottage meetings a man so we're hearts were open to receive the Prophet praise the Lord and that was in 66 of energy around June I guess and again as I said before in July I was in Bishop Falls and I was and brother bill I got baptized me and they go in in the bishop falls River yeah it's not like it used to be them because it's all collapsed I think the Falls that was there a million but I remember now our brother Bill I get out there being baptizing there this one in this one in this one in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and a man and there were there I don't know how many maybe a two three or maybe could be three hundred people or more that was gathered upon the banks there and looking down a man and at the cottage meeting that are not a cottage mean by the open air service that brother Manuel the other brothers and sisters were having and they used to be lifetime we're not gonna miss your balls but that church is gone now a million but he said now he said we got a brother here he said a young man he said from st. John's Newfoundland and he said we're gonna baptize him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and he went out and I Kenny and he did quote the scripture according to the promise yeah and they come and they said to baptize in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost I'm going to baptize my brother in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen not names name Amen if you believe in a Trinity it had to be names in the names of the Father of the Son and the Holy Ghost but it's in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and I thank the Lord for that revelation amen and that was just seven months after I was baptized in Pentecost amen come to the word and brother again I gotta go beyond when it comes to recognizing the Prophet he got to go beyond their recognizing over the doctrine recognizing water baptism in the name he gotta go beyond that by the grace of Almighty God amen we got to go from that and get into the word and let the word get in us a man yes not just a word of repentance and what about him in his name oh yeah and the oneness of the Godhead oh yeah there's not a Trinity it's just one God and so on and then as Jesus said the father may die in you and you and me and they're all and they're all worn by the grace of Almighty God amen sure is going beyond that mother and it's getting us more and more and more into this revelation this revelation of that revelation amen amen thank God that he brought us into the greater revelation yeah get out of denomination and watch this beyond your guard against denominational spirits amen amen listen let's be led by the spirit and under the control of the spirit sons and daughters of God led by the Spirit of God a man not a religious spirit by the Holy Ghost Christ in you leading you Christ in you controlling your thoughts your words and your deeds amen so again and again it's not you that lives is Christ living in you it's Jesus living in you go by the mirror and see if you're seeing Christ Saviour see Jesus in you Savior seen the revealed Word in you the revealed word is Christ amen again as the Bible says it's not me that lives as Christ liveth in me now I'm their brother lot can confess it but how many are going to live it let's believe oh is Jesus living in me because oh he led me to do this he led me to do that brother he's got it he's got it oh yeah he let me give you baptized in his name he led me to believe that there is one God and this doctrine and that doctor and their doctrine brother he's gonna live your life not just doctrine it's the life you're living it's your attitude it's your actions it's your reactions amen you're reflecting Jesus Christ you're reflecting God amen brother sister grace to us grace that will reflect God as abel did reflect god brother as the promise and as the saints they down through the ages will reflect god as they did in the early church ages as Luther did as Wesley did a man and reflect I tell you will reflect more of God reflect more of God than Luther did reflect more of God then Wesley reflect more of God than the Pentecostals that's where the prophet of God said the pedicles don't recognize the crowning of their message no they didn't recognize the crowning of the Pentecostal revival oh yeah they they felt oh yes ed we got the revival and oh yeah we got this we got that and then we got the gifts of the Spirit and so on so I believe a Billy you know what they believe they believe the next thing was the coming of the Lord but they didn't recognize it amen could the Lord should the Saint remember with a shout is in a day that you know you don't ravely recognize that a day they don't realize he stressed when the Lord is going to come amen when they didn't know it they didn't realize well they thought that it all happened back in 1906 yeah they held it all happened back then you know I'm around that around that time when the prophet of God was born that God said the Pentecostal revival and brother it was something that started in England yeah you're saying they were Lowther Wesley then brother then it came from England to America because in England in 1885 they had a they had a revival yeah preachers anyway it was a ministry revival that they're having in England in 1885 and what were they having a revival for and they were discussing the gifts of the Spirit they're discussing the anointing of God in the lives of his sons and daughters amen the results and the reflection of God oh they came they came up with the revelation of the gifts the gifts Oh amazing absolutely amazing brother sister and after that the number then came of course came back to America and a certain certain state there in America at a certain city in America there a million and that's where the Pentecostal revival was starting there amen and went from there of course we're done down to California and a man in 1906 the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit came back to the church a man but there was already a man praise the Lord God already puttin that seed in another's life he already played that seed in Wesley's heart amen and he was but he had already put that seat in the heart of those Pentecostal believers amen back in eighteen the late eighteen hundreds and the early nineteen hundreds a man a man hungry that's asking for what God wanted to reveal oh they're thirsty for what God wanted to do in the Pentecostal revival and the gifts of the Spirit amen because God had to reveal that before they opened the word oh yeah we could bring that out in the book of Acts there and so on oh thank god brother sister in the name of Jesus place in the name of Jesus know the word in the name of Jesus that your faith being the word Amen you're great brother have you got a quick say they the world Oh got a question or the family got a question friends got a question his written is the answer amen it was not well I I believe this I believe that no it is written we believe it is written so give them it is written not not your ideas are your thoughts oh well what's going on why do you believe this where it is written brother because Jesus every every time that he was questioned or challenge it is written gave me behind me Satan it is written amen go there be any Satan it is written do you know what's written do you have the Holy Ghost that's going to bring to your remembrance was written well if you got the Holy Ghost senior so you'll bring to your heart it is written amen if it's in your soul brother win win and your faith is challenged the Holy Ghost comes up into your spirit it is written amen he's not gonna use your brain to root to reason not gonna use your brain to there to explain this and explain that no brother the only explanation we need is it's written Oh explain this explain that no it's written oh yeah believe us though this amen believe us now this brother that's the challenge do you believe it is written amen whether or not not man's idea but God's revelation of it by the Holy Ghost in our hearts and in our souls brother we got to have it in our hearts brother when it comes to the anointing which at the end time oh yeah many have the anointing in their flesh but Pew got the anointing in their heart and the proud of God is highlighting it he is bringing it out he is explaining it even brings out concerning Jesus and Jonas amen brother the other disciples had the Ananya in their souls as it were but Judas said the anointing in his flesh in his mind oh yeah if he had it on the inside the inside and rather he had that wrong idea he wouldn't do what he did Jesus should be betray this your friend he said with with that with it with a kiss oh yeah I seems people all do it a lot of people he would have bet he would have been deceiving and he was he was because he was he was acting like a Christian acting light not a Christian but a believer back in Jesus day in the disciples day there's nothing Dave gets the disciples when Jesus talked about someone's gonna deceive it what oh well that's gonna be Jewish no no all the disciples said is it me is it me is it me oh yeah they thought it would they would do it and didn't know it but they did they didn't they didn't separate Judas they didn't think was going to be Judas what do you think old well if he had that spirit on him all well surely they would have recognized him as a deceiver no he didn't have that spirit oh yeah yeah but they couldn't Rene didn't deserted they didn't see it a million because there was another anointing on him as a one of his disciples yeah oh my my my Amen brothers sister that same thing in the same that's been the same all the way down through the ages yeah brother we could have rotted out in in Revelation chapter 2 concerning the other church ages and the spirit that was that was among them than the Nicolaitans spirit the spirit of deception amen and what is aminika Leah's spirit to conquer the laity yeah to conquer the laity a man bring them somebody to the ministry know that the minister be subject to the lady for to give them the word exactly by the grace of Almighty God a male subject of the Holy Ghost to minister to the laity by the grace of God amen but see when God started in the church the devil started and brother he was Dan he was there then and he's here now so we better be on our guards better be on our guard make sure that we're not going to be under the influence of Satan spirit a man in our flesh by the grace of God that we'd be under the anointing of the Holy Ghost yes but controlled by the Holy Ghost from the heart the Providence you can have the anointing in yours in your flesh 24 hours a day and go to hell and he said you can be healed and go to hell that's exactly the truth and he brings out example after example in in the scriptures concerning oh yeah this one experienced this but they were lost just when I experienced that but they went to hell different experience that but God destroyed him yeah brother god help us amen make your calling and election sure there was a man and we were warned jesus warned us that it would be so close it would deceive the very elect if possible amen I believe God I believe the Lord I believe the message yes but let's become one with it and let the message be in us let God through the message control us from the soul not from the head and her a lot they got it in their heads but they don't have it in their hearts amen and that's why they're going to compromise oh yeah and brother you start compromising with yourself and the word oh yeah not with this one but that eventually that that will come but first you start compromising with yourself compromising with your thoughts compromising with your feelings compromising with your with your ideas yeah brother you better make sure it's the word coming out of your soul very man not religious ideas coming out of your head grace of God see grace that we're gonna make our Colleen any let no wonder Jesus said make it sure amen how are you gonna make a sure by lighting up with the word judge yourself by the word in your thoughts in your days in your motives in your objectives in your actions in your reactions am I am i reflecting jesus god help us that we're not going to reflect judas yeah brother again he said judas was anointed because he went and did what he did as the other disciples but he said his spirit was of the devil hey man he wasn't he wasn't the seed of God he was serpent see oh yeah and he had that anointing he had that anointing that the disciple said but being a serpent seed in his heart in his soul he had that yeah dead anointing god help us see make your calling and election sure make sure you got the anointing of the Holy Ghost in your soul amen you're living its word from the heart not your head you're living this word from the heart based on the word not just a book of message book no no as I said and I like I said back some years ago in in a film when brother Billy Paul was testifying he also highlighted it he said don't take this he said he said and and leave out this he said you got to take this and put it in there oh I said that's good I said god bless him for that he said yes because this he said is the revelation of this a man this is the wolken word as the word this is the revealed word for this hour to give us the faith that we need in this age hey man amen it is the revelation of the mystery of God brother from not not a and in the book of Revelation only not in the new trucks with only it is a revelation of the mystery of God from Genesis to Revelation it is a revelation of revelation of the mystery of God brother from before Genesis 1:1 from eternity down through time back to eternity hey brother there's no other revelation as a word that God has given down through the search agents but this revelation is taking us back to eternity amen because we need it we need this revelation brother it's not a revelation that put us on to the next stage the next stage to the next stage amen is this revelation of taking us out of time and into eternity is this - revelation is taking us out of this list fleshly body and this sinful body into a glorified body by the grace of God oh my there's not many believers hungry for not many believers thirsting for it oh they they they believe it's going to come on uh I hope God does this God does that God is doing it God is day are we submitting ourselves to his leadership are we subjecting ourselves to that anointing where God is old why if God is doing it in yellow and die doing the MA he's changing us oh yeah and we're being changed more and more and more and as time goes on we'll all praise the Lord we're beginning to get becoming more and more eternal creatures more and more we're becoming more and more hallelujah subject to the word taking us from time to eternity oh yeah more and more conscious of eternity more and more conscious of the Resurrection and the rapture and then they are looking for the dead in Christ to rise as I've said how many is looking for sister Dunford a sister coffee will you see them tomorrow will they appear to us well they're going to appear to those living Saints those that are ordained and predestinated for the rapture they'll appear to them probably God brings it out I'll add to try to find that message he brings that out and highlights it he said now I said the daddy Christ going to appear to us first you know then he said we're going to step into our glorified bodies will recognize them we're not glorified but he said well step into our theophany bodies and then he said well get into a glorified body and we'll go off to meet him no grace of God amen the grace of God brothers sister that we're going to be the annoying ones at the end time the grace of God that we're going to a man that through the anointing in us not with us or around us that the anointing in us that God is going to bring to pass the promise is ordained for this our God Elvis a man the only an ID movie they had the finish just for tonight and the Lord willing continual I thought maybe I should go I would finish this book here tonight and I haven't even started it it not I've started it yes but I wanted to get into a not sure what page it is maybe 9 or 10 something like that and it's a so over 60 pages and I'm not going to go to every page our brotherly Bay all did I like brother rouse messages I remember one time he said he was preaching out a certain message and he went word by word by word by word line by line by line a man preached a commented preached and commented amen as I said he preached maybe seven sermons on that on that one message and a certain brother I told you before a certain brothers at all said you're not let your you can't preach likely Vale and so on because I preached just very few messages on a certain sermon and so finally I said okay I just preached this I said and I preached and I sure I'm any message of many many messages on I said goes from part one right on oh I said do I equally Vale now amen I didn't I don't think so because they didn't never come back yeah so brother sister could take again now I'm not going to do it to it that way line by line but it just parts of paragraphs that I want to share with you what for to give us a greater revelation of the anointed ones at the end time what for so that at the end of it we're going to come to the conclusion and know the anointing that's on us and where it is to make sure that we yeah we're anointed but not false anointed now as the prophet of god said the 90 is true the 90 is real and it's in it's Christ he said buddy said the false he said it's a false teaching oh yeah I said you can experience the true and 90 of the Holy Ghost and then he said but not take the teeth to true teaching you glad to add a wordy rattle were there a change of their change it there and brother were experiencing a lot of that even around the message so the anoint there's a true and ninety-one at the end times are staying with the word and there's a there's a false of ninety-one at the end time Lord brothers sisters the true anointing but they're compromising on the word and brother concerning considering know what I have seen and what I've heard over the year of fifty years there's been a lot of compromising and there's more and more compromising as we get more and more into a modern world as we get more and more into the time of the end please let's not compromise this makes a man let's submit ourselves to the true anointing of the Holy Ghost amen in our souls so amen if your if the whole nun is in your soul you're going to stay with the word you're going to stay with the message you're going to go out there and live a life that's reflecting the word reflecting Jesus in thought word and deed in your hata tude oh yeah in your attitude in your actions in your reactions reflect Jesus Christ how many times do you talk to him during the day by the grace of God through the day III oh my I don't know if this is an hour to go through but I don't call on Jesus Oh Lord Jesus your grace your grace your grace Jesus I need it yeah every step of the way so brother let's recognize the anointing of the Holy Ghost in us not with us oh I got the anointing good is it in you or with you is Jesus with you or in you he's with those with this one with that one but he's the end oh yeah the problem of God oh my he was absolutely true he said yeah he said there's many anointed ones he said even now he said and there was because some of them when I was back there as a young believer maybe we were myself and and those in our cottage means back then in gamble we were supporting this evangelist that evangelist that one and they all condemned within badams teaching yeah but yet they went out with signs and wonders heal the sick yeah even some were it raised the dead and he did this and did that yeah but denied the message of the hour and eventually push William Branham off the scene you know they begin to they refused to support William brows ministry as I said one evangelist went to William Branham and I said brother Bentham you got to stop preaching those things he said because people is not don't want to hear it and they're gonna refuse you when he said prophet said somebody got to preach it he said the pastors are not preaching it so he said I gotta preach it and that was a very famous evangelist that told him to do that yeah and it was an evangelist that I don't know I might have one on tape at all now somewhere or it might be here in this church in a box somewhere yeah and you while there were several several other evangelists dead oh yeah they recognized wooden brenell and there was one evangelist brother/sister that came to Newfoundland some years ago and he was in it in that church in sin new sport and he mentioned william branham highlighted wheeler Branham he said all their be honest he said he said you could he said you could take he said William Branham and put him or him one into the scale and he said you could take he said a dozen of the rest he said of the Evangelist and put him in the other end and he said no way would they balance out William branham's ministry no way he said we know Browns ministry was so powerful and he says so great he said that there that our ministries and that he had a signs and wonders ministry himself and and I mean he named some others and others and others and others very famous evangelist signs and wonders and he said no there's no way our that that our ministry sees that are going to balance William Branham he said William Branham is going to take us all yet they rejected wheeler Brenham yeah brother grace to us they rejected Jesus they rejected the prophets I pray grace grace to us that we're going to stay with the word grace that the word is going to stay with us and be in us the word is going to control you your thoughts your words your deeds what you do how you do it when and where and your spirit so it's you're under the control of the Holy Ghost even listen even even if you're working even if you're working oh yeah you're a Christian oh yeah again yes if you're a mother in your house you're a Christian it's Jesus in mom it's Jesus in daddy oh yeah and you reflect it thought were indeed oh you're you're constantly reminding your children and sometimes reminding one another now that's not Christian we shouldn't do that don't think that don't say that that's not Christian that attitude that spirit is not Christian hey man you want Christ to control you from your soul ain't it the grace of God be with us so that we got the anointing in our souls not in our flesh god bless just let this stand amen oh my Oh tremendous some of the some of the things the prophet of God has said there's absolutely tremendous yes a man who brother sister go read the message and then let the pastor quicken it to your heart it's a little strike you this thing I want that kind of blessing praise the name of the Lord when Jacob met the Lord upon that lonely night and wrestled there alone until the morning light he won a princely title to gird him for the right I want that kind of blessing and brother oh yeah in the hour and world were living right now you can experience loneliness that's right because we're separated yeah and believers will experience loneliness oh yeah they want a hunger they are burned they thirst for fellowship I'm gonna thirst yeah even if it's the ministry just preaching for 5 and then preaching to 10 and I don't know when he'll cool off you know maybe sometime in June he'll grow up again we'll see yeah oh yeah so the grace of God be with us brother how close are we getting to the end when we won't be able to have this fellowship at all playa the hours coming as I said when we won't be allowed to get together they'll try to force us to go out there and unite with this
