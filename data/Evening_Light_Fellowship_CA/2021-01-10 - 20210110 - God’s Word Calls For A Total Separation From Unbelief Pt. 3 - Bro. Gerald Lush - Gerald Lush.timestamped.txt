[59:54] 11 amen and we'll endeavor ever by grace
[59:56] to read the scripture move on and to
[1:00:00] finish the the thoughts of the message
[1:00:02] concerning a total separation from
[1:00:06] unbelief amen and of course he included
[1:00:09] in the title The reason because God's
[1:00:12] word calls for it amen and it's still
[1:00:15] calling for it and the closer we get to
[1:00:18] the resurrection closer we get to the
[1:00:20] Rapture brother the separation from
[1:00:23] unbelief becomes greater amen we're just
[1:00:26] getting out of this world Amen goodbye
[1:00:30] amen just we trust by by grace that
[1:00:33] we're going to meet some of you again in
[1:00:35] the other dimension but for the most no
[1:00:38] amen so the grace of God be with us
[1:00:39] brother amen that what God requires for
[1:00:43] the resurrection and Rapture a total
[1:00:45] separation from unbelief amen a total
[1:00:49] separation from the world the things of
[1:00:51] the world Amen so that we're not caught
[1:00:54] up with the world on to many getting
[1:00:56] caught up with that Rapture no no we
[1:00:58] want to get caught up with the Rapture
[1:00:59] and glory amen out of this world and
[1:01:02] into the kingdom of God one it's going
[1:01:04] to be wonderful as I mentioned I believe
[1:01:06] in Wednesday service that that we're I'm
[1:01:10] longing to get there because why I want
[1:01:12] to get into a world where there's
[1:01:13] nothing negative and where everything is
[1:01:17] positive amen praise the name of the
[1:01:19] Lord there are no wrong thoughts no
[1:01:21] wrong Deeds no wrong actions or
[1:01:23] reactions amen there's absolutely no sin
[1:01:27] Amen brother we don't we won't have to
[1:01:30] wrestle with what's going on in the mind
[1:01:32] no no it'll be all under his control it
[1:01:35] be the Holy Ghost with us yes but praise
[1:01:37] God it be the Holy Ghost in US amen not
[1:01:40] only that but brother we not we're going
[1:01:43] Beyond adoption to into the Revelation
[1:01:45] that we are not adopted Sons but the
[1:01:47] true sons of God in eternity oh right
[1:01:51] here it's adopted oh yeah we're
[1:01:53] experiencing adoption yeah by the of God
[1:01:56] by the new birth but we're going to get
[1:01:58] in there where there's going to be an
[1:01:59] absolutely new body glorified body amen
[1:02:04] nothing there nothing there to testify
[1:02:06] of sin or of the world we're getting out
[1:02:08] of Amen it's you know what he's looking
[1:02:10] for not you to come in say oh I remember
[1:02:13] this I don't brother I don't think we're
[1:02:14] going to remember anything not not
[1:02:16] concerning this old world definitely not
[1:02:19] oh no not but again as I said there's a
[1:02:21] certain church that believes that oh you
[1:02:23] know the dead are just over there and
[1:02:25] they're in the in in the grave during
[1:02:27] the funeral or in the cemetery no
[1:02:29] they're not physically they are because
[1:02:32] God prophesied it God said dust Thou Art
[1:02:35] and unto dust shalt thou return amen the
[1:02:38] physical part of you that's born in sin
[1:02:41] but brother we get out of this and into
[1:02:43] a glorified body we're sin no sin amen
[1:02:48] so God help us brother and sister oh my
[1:02:50] it's it's get to get into that world
[1:02:52] again nothing negative there are no no
[1:02:56] questions when it comes to govern by
[1:02:58] doubt not by any means or it's going to
[1:03:01] be tremendous and make no one of the
[1:03:03] props that he'd be there singing Amazing
[1:03:05] Grace amen and it's why because it's by
[1:03:08] God's love projected Grace Grace
[1:03:12] projected Faith amen so there's too
[1:03:15] often people are taking scripture out of
[1:03:16] context and as I said again or they say
[1:03:19] Where Oh by the grace of God we're saved
[1:03:21] oh just by the grace oh yeah just by the
[1:03:24] grace of God he did it he did it he did
[1:03:26] it yeah but he it was his Divine love
[1:03:29] that projected Grace and what does Grace
[1:03:31] Project Grace projects Faith Amen to get
[1:03:35] you back amen praise the Lord and Grace
[1:03:38] projects amen listen we're remembering
[1:03:40] this remembering that when we get over
[1:03:42] there we'll know it but and we won't
[1:03:44] remember about this world why because
[1:03:47] the dead know not anything again like I
[1:03:50] said that's what that person belonging
[1:03:51] to a certain Church told told me you
[1:03:54] know they they said all the dead know
[1:03:56] nothing they're just gone on and and so
[1:03:58] on they're out there in the in the in
[1:04:00] the cemeteries no no I said not by any
[1:04:03] means I said what happened like I said
[1:04:05] what happened to the to the Rich Young
[1:04:07] Ruler he lifted up his eyes in Hell
[1:04:09] being in torment amen that's right the
[1:04:13] grace of God brother but I said Lazarus
[1:04:15] was in the in the bosom of Abram oh she
[1:04:17] said he must have some bosom I said yes
[1:04:19] it's eternal life but again they don't
[1:04:21] believe it oh so God help us brother
[1:04:24] that when we go we're not going to a
[1:04:26] place of Torment oh thank God for that
[1:04:29] hallelujah we're going to a place of
[1:04:31] Peace amen where there's absolute Rec
[1:04:35] contentment yes and love and pure love
[1:04:38] amen you want have to wonder what what
[1:04:40] will this one do what will that one do
[1:04:42] no no we'll know by the grace of God and
[1:04:45] we're getting there by
[1:04:47] grace and to get there God God requires
[1:04:53] separation amen a separation amen and a
[1:04:56] hunger and a thirst to get there amen
[1:04:59] but the more we hunger the more we
[1:05:01] thirst the greater the separation
[1:05:03] becomes between you and the world and
[1:05:05] the things of the world Amen so God's
[1:05:08] grace be with us and God help me I just
[1:05:11] I don't want to get just go on and on
[1:05:12] with the scriptures but I I would like
[1:05:14] to share with you again some of the
[1:05:16] thoughts that the that God has given us
[1:05:18] through the prophet of the hour amen and
[1:05:21] again we're not worshiping the prophet
[1:05:23] we're worshiping God Amen we're not
[1:05:26] acknowledging just of the ideas of a
[1:05:28] prophet we're acknowledging the
[1:05:30] revelation of the word amen by the Holy
[1:05:33] Ghost praise the
[1:05:35] Lord in Genesis 11 and let's start to
[1:05:39] read at verse
[1:05:41] 31 we could read more of this
[1:05:44] but to get more time just to share with
[1:05:47] you some of the thoughts that God Amen
[1:05:50] see there's a written word and then
[1:05:52] there's a revealed word so we want to
[1:05:54] get into some of the the things that God
[1:05:56] has revealed to us in these last days
[1:06:00] amen and Tara that was Abram's father he
[1:06:04] took Abram his son and lot the son of
[1:06:07] Aaron his son son and Sarah his daughter
[1:06:13] in-law and his son Abram's wife and they
[1:06:18] went forth with them from the earth of
[1:06:20] the Cales to go into the land of
[1:06:24] Canaan and they came unto Aaron and
[1:06:27] dwelt there and the days of terara were
[1:06:31] 205 years and Tara died in Haron God
[1:06:36] bless his word you may be seated and
[1:06:39] keep Genesis to Genesis CH 12
[1:06:46] amen full obedience to the word brings
[1:06:49] us the total separation amen the more
[1:06:52] and more we're subject to the word the
[1:06:54] more and more we put our control under
[1:06:56] God's God's power God's anointing God's
[1:06:58] love the greater that we are
[1:07:01] experiencing separation from the world
[1:07:03] and the things of the world Amen and
[1:07:06] brother if there's ever an hour that we
[1:07:08] needed that anointing it's the hour that
[1:07:10] we're living now because people are
[1:07:12] getting caught up with this and caught
[1:07:14] up with that all that's going on in the
[1:07:16] world and concerning the covid-19 issues
[1:07:20] and you you got to do this you got to do
[1:07:22] that in the eyes of man but what do we
[1:07:24] have to do in the eyes of of God Amen
[1:07:27] man is looking for us to obey this and
[1:07:29] Obey that but what is God looking for
[1:07:32] what does God want to see in you what
[1:07:34] does God want to see in me in in
[1:07:36] considering in in the light of all
[1:07:37] that's going on in the world the world
[1:07:40] is cut up with what's going on the world
[1:07:42] has cut up with the covid-19 issues and
[1:07:45] the world has cut up fighting one
[1:07:47] another to try to try to get the
[1:07:49] influence this one influence that one
[1:07:51] Amen to do what what they feel that they
[1:07:53] should do to prevent this
[1:07:56] disease from spreading around the world
[1:07:58] again and to prevent it from getting
[1:08:00] worse than what it is now well brother
[1:08:03] sister God Allelujah God has done what
[1:08:06] he's done Amen to put our attention in
[1:08:08] in eternity and to put our attention on
[1:08:11] what he's doing amen and that so that
[1:08:14] we're not going to put our attention on
[1:08:15] what man's doing but what God has done
[1:08:18] what God is doing and what God will do
[1:08:21] amen praise the Lord because in what he
[1:08:24] has done we have the example of God we
[1:08:26] have the testimony of God we know what
[1:08:28] God is like we know what he how he talks
[1:08:30] we know how he expresses himself amen
[1:08:33] and so we're entering into it what he's
[1:08:34] doing and then believing what he's going
[1:08:36] to do but again if you're going to if
[1:08:38] you're going to catch what he's going to
[1:08:40] do you got you got to have the
[1:08:41] revelation of what he's done and what
[1:08:43] he's doing amen because if you don't
[1:08:46] then you're not going to recognize him
[1:08:47] when he moves on the scene in the Final
[1:08:49] Phase so God help us to recognize God in
[1:08:53] the word God in in the written word God
[1:08:56] in the revealed word amen and brother
[1:08:59] brother believing that Allelujah is
[1:09:01] giving us the faith to be part of what
[1:09:03] God will do praise the Lord Allelujah
[1:09:07] we're just moving on and on and on and
[1:09:09] on to the Rapture on and on to the
[1:09:11] resurrection
[1:09:13] amen but amen God is allowing all these
[1:09:16] things to happen and it's going to
[1:09:18] distract the unbeliever it's going to
[1:09:21] distract the make Believers they're
[1:09:23] going to get partially caught up with
[1:09:24] that again
[1:09:26] understanding the message that the
[1:09:27] prophet of God preached concerning the
[1:09:29] three kinds of Believers and he said but
[1:09:33] and and again thank God for the
[1:09:35] understanding that they all they're all
[1:09:37] under a genuine anointing but he said
[1:09:41] the their unbelief and their make belief
[1:09:43] he said amen is manifested in their
[1:09:46] false teachings amen so I Oh I thought
[1:09:50] they had a false anointing and there are
[1:09:52] some that do have that false anointing
[1:09:54] they have that devil the devil's
[1:09:56] anointing on him to do this and this and
[1:09:57] this amen yet Satan's anointing is
[1:10:01] religious that's right he knows the word
[1:10:04] he knows what God has said he knows what
[1:10:06] God is is doing he knows what God will
[1:10:08] do and that's why as the Bible says he
[1:10:10] has come down with great wrath he knows
[1:10:12] his time is short well if he knows his
[1:10:15] time is short the bride ought to know
[1:10:17] that her time is short amen if it give
[1:10:20] the devil that Faith what faith ought it
[1:10:22] to give Believers Amen brother if and
[1:10:25] and oh yes it's producing this these
[1:10:28] works in the devil and oh the devil's
[1:10:30] going to do this the devil's going to do
[1:10:32] that oh yeah and he and he's going to
[1:10:34] make things worse and so on and he has
[1:10:36] great wrath oh is the devil amen but
[1:10:40] brother I tell you this if if that's in
[1:10:42] the negative what is God doing in the
[1:10:45] positive amen amen Amen brother the
[1:10:48] bright is not going to have great wrath
[1:10:50] the Bri is going to have great faith
[1:10:52] amen and and and and she's not going
[1:10:55] down she's going up praise the name of
[1:10:57] the Lord hallelujah so let God help us
[1:11:00] that we're going to keep in the the
[1:11:03] faith we're going to stay in the faith
[1:11:05] the faith is going to control us not Us
[1:11:08] control the faith amen there's too many
[1:11:11] trying to control the faith and you'll
[1:11:13] do this when this is all right when that
[1:11:15] is all right when that is all right but
[1:11:17] Believers are just moving on by faith
[1:11:20] amen the revelation of what God has done
[1:11:22] what God is doing what he will do
[1:11:24] brother the is living for it amen it it
[1:11:27] just absolutely controls the bride Amen
[1:11:31] brother we're we're we're
[1:11:32] considering the scriptures were
[1:11:34] concerned in the word amen it is written
[1:11:36] it is written it is written thus say the
[1:11:38] Lord see again I said Jesus went through
[1:11:41] that that time of Temptation in the in
[1:11:43] the up in the wilderness there what for
[1:11:46] to give us an example how how that we
[1:11:48] ought to face Temptation and now that we
[1:11:50] deal with temptation amen how did he
[1:11:53] face it how did he deal with it with his
[1:11:55] word amen and he he didn't he wasn't
[1:11:58] going to add to his word it was the word
[1:12:01] that that doesn't change the same
[1:12:02] yesterday today and tomorrow amen by the
[1:12:05] grace of God and so when the enemy said
[1:12:08] this he said yeah but it's written and
[1:12:11] the enemy said well what about this he
[1:12:13] said well it's written see didn't have
[1:12:15] to add to it he just had to give it the
[1:12:17] way that God said it the way that he had
[1:12:19] said it amen through His prophets this
[1:12:21] is absolutely amazing so I pray the
[1:12:24] grace of God brother that we have the
[1:12:26] anointing of the Holy Ghost to recognize
[1:12:28] that enemy that's down with great great
[1:12:30] wrath and I'll tell you he's right there
[1:12:32] and as he's the first one in the church
[1:12:35] that's right what's he there for he's
[1:12:37] there to control your thoughts he's
[1:12:38] there to try to turn you around and he's
[1:12:40] there to to get you to oh well to
[1:12:43] compromise don't you well don't take
[1:12:45] that too too serious you don't have to
[1:12:48] worry with that brother I think we do I
[1:12:51] think we we need to take it more serious
[1:12:53] the things of God Amen
[1:12:55] let's not just say oh well praise the
[1:12:57] Lord you know well we know that's going
[1:12:59] to happen and this is going to happen
[1:13:00] all these things are going to take place
[1:13:02] and so on yeah yeah but what it's going
[1:13:04] to affect the world but it's also going
[1:13:06] to have an effect on the elect of God on
[1:13:09] the seed of God Amen so what effect is
[1:13:12] it is it making us more spiritual is it
[1:13:15] causing us to call on the Lord more
[1:13:18] brothers so what effect is all this
[1:13:20] having on you what effect is it having
[1:13:22] on on many of the Believers around the
[1:13:24] world and again I I I don't feel it's
[1:13:27] having the the the the the the influence
[1:13:29] or the effect that God wants us to have
[1:13:32] that God want wanted it to have it but
[1:13:34] he knows he's going to see it in the
[1:13:36] elect he's going to see it in the true
[1:13:37] seat of God Amen he's going to see it in
[1:13:41] the True Believers because they're going
[1:13:44] to stay under the right anointing and
[1:13:45] they're going to stay in the right
[1:13:47] teaching by the grace of God and you're
[1:13:49] not going to add to the teaching not
[1:13:50] going to take away from the teaching
[1:13:52] brother it's you that's that believes it
[1:13:55] and it's feeding on it by the grace of
[1:13:57] almighty God but yet there's too many
[1:13:59] too many so-called Believers brother I
[1:14:02] tell you they're going the church and
[1:14:03] they hear this preach and they hear that
[1:14:05] preach and that this and oh I believe
[1:14:06] this I believe that but they're going
[1:14:08] out there and living the same kind of
[1:14:10] life that the people in denominations
[1:14:12] are living that's the truth the only the
[1:14:14] only difference is oh oh yeah well
[1:14:16] they're they're Pentecostal they're
[1:14:17] Salvation Army they're this oh yeah but
[1:14:19] I I'm a believer I'm a message believer
[1:14:22] and I go to this church I go to that
[1:14:23] church but

[1:14:28] they're religious amen and and they know
[1:14:32] that they're going to we got church on a
[1:14:33] on a Wednesday and on a Sunday like one
[1:14:36] time I said we always at it Sunday

[1:14:40] the sister's here I don't know if she
[1:14:42] would want want me to say mention her
[1:14:44] name but she said she hope we get back

[1:14:52] going to do with the time amen what are
[1:14:55] you going to do with the dime oh well we
[1:14:57] all we need is just one service what one
[1:15:00] service brother probably God did iight
[1:15:03] somewhere that one day he said we want
[1:15:05] to meet every
[1:15:06] night oh yeah when we consider all
[1:15:08] that's going on we want to meet every
[1:15:10] night and brother now the rules are that
[1:15:12] we can't do that the rules are you just
[1:15:15] just got to have so many meat and so
[1:15:16] many do this so many do that oh yeah and
[1:15:18] it's going to get worse and worse and
[1:15:20] worse so what is see God Amen God's
[1:15:24] allowing that to happen and he's
[1:15:26] watching the result the the the the
[1:15:28] results of the world out that they're
[1:15:29] feeling what they're doing the reactions
[1:15:31] of the world out there amen oh he knows
[1:15:34] but now he's also seeing our
[1:15:36] reaction amen considering all that's
[1:15:39] going on oh the world is acting and
[1:15:41] reacting this way acting and reacting
[1:15:43] this way they're getting all caught up
[1:15:44] with what's going on naturally in the
[1:15:47] world but what about the bride amen is
[1:15:50] she is she getting caught up with that
[1:15:52] or is she getting more and more and more
[1:15:54] spiritual and more and more caught up
[1:15:56] with the promise of the resurrection and
[1:15:58] the promise of the Rapture I tell you
[1:16:00] too many Believers are just casual Just
[1:16:02] Let It Go on yeah well they'll
[1:16:04] acknowledge it as as being judgments in
[1:16:06] the world Amen but they're not getting
[1:16:09] they're not getting more spiritual
[1:16:10] they're just religious they keep on
[1:16:12] going but we believe this we believe
[1:16:14] that no brother sister if you really
[1:16:16] believe it you'll have a hunger for it
[1:16:18] you'll have a thirst for it and you and
[1:16:20] you want more and more to get together
[1:16:22] with the Believers and and talk about it
[1:16:25] Amen to see if there's something that
[1:16:26] somebody's going to say to increase our
[1:16:28] faith amen and somebody's going to
[1:16:31] explain something amen not concerning oh
[1:16:33] this is going on there that's going on
[1:16:35] there no let's let's be more and more
[1:16:38] and more sensitive to what's going on in
[1:16:41] our souls amen are we getting more
[1:16:44] spiritual and and I tell you this if if
[1:16:46] you're getting more and more spiritual
[1:16:48] amen and recognizing what God is doing
[1:16:50] amen and you're believing Hallelujah
[1:16:52] you're believing like the devil oh time
[1:16:54] is short
[1:16:56] time is short we're getting closer to
[1:16:57] the Rapture amen the devil's going to
[1:16:59] try to influence you to get away from
[1:17:01] that not to put too much emphasis on it
[1:17:04] oh yeah but if you're elect of God and
[1:17:07] if he's in control you're going to put
[1:17:08] more and more emphasis on it and you're
[1:17:10] going to be constantly looking for the
[1:17:11] for looking for the resurrection looking
[1:17:13] for the Rapture Lord is getting close
[1:17:15] please don't let me miss it Amen brother
[1:17:18] it ought to do it to us considering what
[1:17:21] the prophet of God said that there might
[1:17:22] be a dozen Out of Africa
[1:17:25] oh yeah amazing so what how many is
[1:17:28] going to come out of Canada how many's
[1:17:30] coming out of out of out of America
[1:17:33] considering all that's going on in
[1:17:34] America now oh yeah brother I tell you
[1:17:38] it's going to get less and Le he said
[1:17:40] that's scripture that's the word it
[1:17:42] ought to put us on our guard brother it
[1:17:44] ought to create a greater hunger and
[1:17:46] thirst to make sure that we're going to
[1:17:47] be part of the Resurrection part of the
[1:17:49] Rapture amen by the grace of God when we
[1:17:52] consider all the these things amen so
[1:17:55] brother God help us amen that we're
[1:17:58] going to be more spiritual less
[1:18:01] religious amen more spiritual and
[1:18:04] definitely not political amen why we're
[1:18:07] going to focus more listen we see
[1:18:09] someone says this is going on oh my
[1:18:11] that's right oh Lord it'll bring you
[1:18:13] back to the
[1:18:14] word yeah oh Lord now what what else is
[1:18:17] there what's what's left to come now
[1:18:18] Lord Lord we know that that there's not
[1:18:21] much time and that we're going to be
[1:18:23] there for the Rapture amen
[1:18:25] but again he warned
[1:18:27] us he warned us concerning the very very
[1:18:31] few Saints living Saints that'll go into
[1:18:35] Rapture amen Grace To Us
[1:18:39] brother God help us brother that we're
[1:18:42] going to live for it amen morning noon
[1:18:45] and night amen that what we can't I tell
[1:18:48] you if you got the Holy Ghost you won't
[1:18:50] be able to get away from it you you
[1:18:52] can't shake the thoughts away just like
[1:18:54] the people out in the world there they
[1:18:56] they they get up in the morning and
[1:18:57] they're thinking this thinking Natural
[1:18:59] Things thinking about what's going on in
[1:19:00] the world and all that but how many are
[1:19:03] getting up in the morning still thinking
[1:19:05] about the
[1:19:05] Rapture how many still thinking about
[1:19:07] the resurrection how many really believe
[1:19:10] it oh yeah not just a religious
[1:19:13] Doctrine but a really really believe in
[1:19:16] a prophecy concerning the resurrection
[1:19:18] and the Rapture not
[1:19:21] many so brother as I've been as I've
[1:19:24] said going through the day praying Lord
[1:19:26] please don't leave me
[1:19:28] behind Amen brother I believe that
[1:19:31] should be the attitude of Believers when
[1:19:33] you're going through the world Amen
[1:19:35] you're going to work you're going to
[1:19:36] education you're doing this you're doing
[1:19:38] that and and and you're very conscious
[1:19:39] of what's going on around the world in
[1:19:41] the natural and so on with the devil's
[1:19:43] Works amen but I tell you this you're
[1:19:46] going to be constantly constantly
[1:19:48] calling on the Lord don't leave me
[1:19:50] behind amen because again there's going
[1:19:53] to be a generation left looking for the
[1:19:55] Rapture they said you it's already
[1:19:58] happened and you didn't know
[1:20:01] it is that you is that me that the
[1:20:04] Rapture is happening and we're not
[1:20:05] conscious of it but I tell you God's
[1:20:08] going to reveal it to us by faith amen
[1:20:11] and what he has done in these last days
[1:20:14] through the ministry of William brandham
[1:20:16] amen well God took him off the scene why
[1:20:19] because there was too much emphasis on
[1:20:22] him oh yeah cuz as I said
[1:20:25] there that series that he preached and
[1:20:27] and that brother put that note in his
[1:20:29] pocket William brandom is my
[1:20:31] lord well he got up and read the note
[1:20:35] and he said I can't I can't he said stay
[1:20:38] do this he said to do that he said that
[1:20:40] would make me
[1:20:42] Antichrist yeah and he felt that if they
[1:20:45] if they continued with that that he was
[1:20:46] going to he was going to leave the
[1:20:48] ministry yeah so brother sister I pray
[1:20:51] Grace brother if they they had that
[1:20:53] revelation they had that idea oh Willam
[1:20:56] brand was Lord no no brother but but the
[1:20:59] bride recognizes the Lord was in his
[1:21:01] ministry amen it wasn't Willam brandom
[1:21:04] it was Jesus amen and again the prophet
[1:21:06] of God said he said that's that's the
[1:21:08] problem he said he said you don't see
[1:21:12] the other Angel they saw William brandom
[1:21:15] but they didn't see the other Angel amen
[1:21:17] they didn't see
[1:21:20] really the pillar of fire and that
[1:21:23] wasn't William brandom that was God

[1:22:23] amen that we're going to have a the
[1:22:27] faith the faith that God was working on
[1:22:31] to give us right again it was a brother
[1:22:35] that told brother brandom he said
[1:22:36] brother and that brother's gone
[1:22:38] on and he said
[1:22:40] brother bradam he said where's the
[1:22:45] Rapture he said surely after after all
[1:22:48] that you have God has done in these last
[1:22:51] days surely said the Rapture is not far
[1:22:56] amen but B of God again knew that many
[1:22:59] were going to miss the Rapture oh yeah
[1:23:02] they got a Doctrine there's a lot of
[1:23:04] churches out there with this doctrine of
[1:23:06] the Rapture the Lord the the dead in
[1:23:08] Christ shall rise first we which are
[1:23:10] alive remain to be come together with
[1:23:11] them to meet the Lord in the air amen a
[1:23:15] lot of them they got an intellectual in
[1:23:17] their heads but that's it they don't
[1:23:20] have the spiritual experience of a new
[1:23:22] birth amen they're not new creatur
[1:23:25] amen thought that's where they come from
[1:23:28] and that's where they're going they're
[1:23:29] going home praise the name of the Lord
[1:23:33] amen God help us in Genesis chapter
[1:23:37] 12 again I'm going to have to just read
[1:23:41] the
[1:23:43] scripture and go back to what God told
[1:23:47] us through the messenger of the age and
[1:23:50] brother see what God did is ordained to
[1:23:52] give us faith
[1:23:55] oh yeah as I let me say it again what G
[1:23:57] God did in Luther and preached through
[1:23:59] Luther was ordained to give him that
[1:24:01] faith of
[1:24:03] justification and the same with other
[1:24:05] ministering Brethren down Through the
[1:24:06] Ages and it was Wesley we know when
[1:24:08] there was Salvation Army and the
[1:24:10] Pentecostal and so on and uh I don't
[1:24:13] remember the brother's name he was a
[1:24:14] black brother that God used in the
[1:24:16] Pentecostal Revival yeah in
[1:24:21] California I think yeah so it was him
[1:24:25] and I understood too that I tell you it
[1:24:27] was God in the brother God controlling
[1:24:29] the brother because it was to the place
[1:24:31] where he would stand in the pet with a
[1:24:32] box over his head and pray yeah praying
[1:24:37] brother that's brother he was convinced
[1:24:39] of something oh yeah he knew it and he
[1:24:42] and he knew that that's what we needed
[1:24:44] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the gifts
[1:24:45] of the Spirit he was crying for it he
[1:24:47] was praying for it until finally amen
[1:24:50] God God honored it amen and they went
[1:24:53] around the world preaching it by the
[1:24:56] grace of God and brother so they
[1:24:59] recognize that do we recognize what God
[1:25:01] has been doing since because the
[1:25:04] Pentecostal Revival started and then
[1:25:06] Pentecostal Revival went into
[1:25:07] denomination amen but God kept moving on
[1:25:10] the scene amen with the revelation of
[1:25:14] his word oh there were there were a
[1:25:16] number of Messengers going down through
[1:25:19] the Pentecostal age right on into the I
[1:25:21] got
[1:25:21] a chart that I drew and to explain to
[1:25:25] you what happened in in this time what
[1:25:27] happened that that year this year that
[1:25:29] year what was God doing amen what's God
[1:25:32] doing
[1:25:33] now and I thank the Lord that that our
[1:25:37] brother is gone on now but our brother
[1:25:39] that uh he he sang A Hymn during the
[1:25:43] church church or the Seven
[1:25:45] Seals he was brother Ram was preaching
[1:25:47] the Seven Seals and during one service
[1:25:50] there before brother Bram came to the
[1:25:51] pulpit to preach on another issue cuz
[1:25:54] concerning the seals that this brother
[1:25:56] got up and sang and brother Brown got
[1:25:58] commented on that he that was a blessing
[1:26:01] to him amen and uh I think that brother
[1:26:04] was also a ministering brother and I did
[1:26:08] uh he did see the chart that I drew in
[1:26:12] in the United States and he said brother
[1:26:15] excellent he said that's exactly the
[1:26:18] truth and he said but he said one just
[1:26:20] one place he said I would change there
[1:26:23] and he said right here and he told me
[1:26:25] and I I changed it and he said so he
[1:26:27] good he said that that's good he said
[1:26:30] that's exactly the Revelation he said
[1:26:32] what God has done through the Pentecost
[1:26:34] or right on yeah from the Pentecostal
[1:26:36] Revival right on up now to the bride
[1:26:39] Revival amen and the prophet of God did
[1:26:42] say it's not going to it won't seem like
[1:26:43] a Revival that's right the bride no
[1:26:47] because all all the revivals were
[1:26:50] noisy but the bride Revival is be still
[1:26:53] and know that I am am God Amen so he
[1:26:57] it's going to it's going to get more
[1:26:58] quiet when it comes to the bride Revival
[1:27:01] and he is highlighted a number of things
[1:27:03] in in in even in the message I believe
[1:27:05] it was ashamed
[1:27:07] 1965 because he also mentioned
[1:27:10] 1965 concerning total
[1:27:12] separation and I want to share with you
[1:27:15] a thought that he preached in
[1:27:17] 1961 concerning total
[1:27:20] separation he
[1:27:21] knew God separated the prophet
[1:27:25] from all the other ministering Brethren
[1:27:27] why they got to the place they wanted
[1:27:29] the signs they wanted the Wonders but
[1:27:31] they didn't want the word that's
[1:27:33] amazing yeah when they would approach
[1:27:36] him and tell them stop preaching this
[1:27:38] Don't Preach that they won't but they
[1:27:40] want him to get up and just talk with
[1:27:42] the Lord and then then show the gifts
[1:27:45] amen yeah what about the word because
[1:27:49] all that amen whatever God does in signs
[1:27:51] and wonders is to point you to the word
[1:27:54] bring you back to the word amen I trust
[1:27:57] by the grace of
[1:27:59] God brother it's having the effect on
[1:28:02] us concerning the Rapture and the
[1:28:05] resurrection again let me say it that he
[1:28:08] it it affected the devil and it give him
[1:28:10] Faith what faith is it giving
[1:28:14] you go Grace Genesis 12 and verse
[1:28:19] one and the Lord has said unto Abram get
[1:28:23] thee out of thy country yeah God
[1:28:27] requires
[1:28:30] separation get the out of thy country
[1:28:33] and from thy Kindred and from thy
[1:28:36] Father's House onto a land that I will
[1:28:40] show thee
[1:28:42] amen God called for a separation there
[1:28:44] God's calling for a separation in your
[1:28:46] life and mine Amen to show unto us what
[1:28:51] he's doing and where we're going amen
[1:28:54] and he said separate yourself from thy
[1:28:57] Kindred and from thy Father's House onto
[1:29:01] a land that I will show thee and brother
[1:29:03] what God required there requires of
[1:29:05] Abraham's seed separate from thy
[1:29:09] father's house from thy Kindred and onto
[1:29:12] a land that I will show thee in the
[1:29:14] revealed word oh yeah so there
[1:29:17] separation how many of us are able to do
[1:29:20] it how many of us are able to deal with
[1:29:21] it how many of us are able to allow God
[1:29:25] to separate us as he was instructing
[1:29:29] Abraham yeah
[1:29:33] Grace and he said I will make of thee a
[1:29:35] great nation and I will bless thee and
[1:29:38] make thy name great and thou shalt be a
[1:29:42] blessing amen I will bless them that
[1:29:45] bless thee and curse him that curseth
[1:29:47] thee and in thee shall all families of
[1:29:50] the earth be blessed amen it's go go to
[1:29:54] another scripture Amen to J 1 John
[1:29:58] Chapter
[1:30:04] 2 1 John Chapter
[1:30:11] 2 praise the
[1:30:22] Lord and let's read
[1:30:24] from this
[1:30:29] SE oh my it's
[1:30:33] tremendous let start with verse one my
[1:30:36] little children these things write I
[1:30:38] unto you that ye sin not amen and God
[1:30:43] did the same thing in this hour the
[1:30:45] revelation of the
[1:30:47] word to stay with the word that we sin
[1:30:50] not amen that we not disbelieve God
[1:30:56] amen and be careful what is what is the
[1:31:00] sin for which there is no
[1:31:05] forgiveness blasphemy yes amen and he
[1:31:10] says what what is blasphemy they think
[1:31:12] oh if you do this you do that you do
[1:31:14] that or that that's that's sin and and
[1:31:17] and you won't be forgiven for it no
[1:31:21] probably God to thank God for the
[1:31:22] revelation of that
[1:31:25] amen the sin that is there's no
[1:31:28] forgiveness is to what is to see what
[1:31:31] the the Holy Ghost is doing God through
[1:31:33] the Holy Ghost is doing and call it the
[1:31:35] devil and he you call it the devil he
[1:31:38] said there's no forgiveness in this
[1:31:40] world or the world to
[1:31:42] come amen and there are those many many
[1:31:45] so-called Christians they look at this
[1:31:47] group and that group well that's the
[1:31:49] devil that's the devil no it's not it's
[1:31:51] God be careful
[1:31:54] because if you're going to call God the
[1:31:56] devil call the Holy Ghost the devil
[1:31:58] there be no forgiveness you better be
[1:32:01] careful what you
[1:32:02] say
[1:32:04] Amen so he If any man sin we have an
[1:32:07] advocate with the father Jesus Christ
[1:32:10] the righteous and it does say somewhere
[1:32:12] but people take it out of context and
[1:32:14] say that you know Believers and
[1:32:16] Christians they don't sin no they don't
[1:32:19] sin
[1:32:20] habitually or they don't have the hunger
[1:32:23] and The Thirst to do
[1:32:24] it but there there is a Temptation that
[1:32:26] the devil try to get you into sometimes
[1:32:28] to fall here and to fall there and you
[1:32:30] do it but again you're not going to go
[1:32:33] and practice in habitually and live for
[1:32:35] it live for it no no no you're fighting
[1:32:38] it you're fighting it and sometimes you
[1:32:41] stumble other times it the devil
[1:32:43] stumbles amen
[1:32:47] Grace because he said If any man sin we
[1:32:50] have an advocate with the father Jesus
[1:32:52] Christ the righteous and he is the
[1:32:54] propip for our sins and not for ours
[1:32:58] only but also for the sins of the whole
[1:33:01] world Amen and thereby we do know that
[1:33:04] we know him if we keep his
[1:33:08] Commandments amen and to keep his
[1:33:10] Commandments we're going back Beyond Ten
[1:33:12] Commandments it is the word amen and he
[1:33:16] that sayith I know him and keepeth not
[1:33:19] his Commandments is a liar and the truth
[1:33:22] is not in him
[1:33:24] amen my God have mercy on us because
[1:33:26] there's many out there professing to be
[1:33:28] Believers and professing to be
[1:33:30] Christians but there their lives don't
[1:33:32] measure up with the
[1:33:34] word amen they're religious but they
[1:33:36] still want to do this and do that do
[1:33:38] what they want to do but not what God
[1:33:40] wants them to
[1:33:41] do that's right
[1:33:46] grace verse five who so keepeth his word
[1:33:49] in him verily is the love of God
[1:33:52] perfected and brother to keep the word
[1:33:55] of God to stay with the word of God
[1:33:57] we've got to have a total separation
[1:33:59] from the world and the things of the
[1:34:01] world
[1:34:04] Amen and verse six says he that saith he
[1:34:06] abideth in him ought himself also so to
[1:34:10] walk even as he walked that's a
[1:34:13] challenge are you going to walk and live
[1:34:15] as Jesus
[1:34:17] did if you if you're looking for the
[1:34:20] Rapture looking for the resurrection you
[1:34:22] got to walk and live as Jesus
[1:34:24] did oh yeah praise the Lord and He that
[1:34:29] saith he abideth in him ought himself
[1:34:32] also so to walk even as he walked
[1:34:35] Brethren I write no new commandment unto
[1:34:38] you but an old commandment which he had
[1:34:40] from the beginning the old commandment
[1:34:42] is the word which you have heard from
[1:34:45] the beginning amen and the new again a
[1:34:48] new commandment I write unto you which
[1:34:50] thing is true in him and in you because
[1:34:53] the darkness is passed and the True
[1:34:56] Light now shineth amen and he that saith
[1:34:59] he is in the light and aeth his brother
[1:35:02] is in darkness even until
[1:35:05] now amen he that loveth his brother
[1:35:09] abideth in the light and there is none
[1:35:12] occasion of stumbling in him and don't
[1:35:15] let's focus on our spiritual brothers
[1:35:18] and sisters amen and there's there's
[1:35:21] so-called Believers Christians that they
[1:35:23] they look down their noses at another

[1:41:14] world I don't care what's out there and
[1:41:17] now there there's more and more and more
[1:41:19] stuff getting invented and then remember
[1:41:23] is Satan doing the inventions to to get
[1:41:25] your attention to distract you from God
[1:41:29] from the word oh yeah that's why the
[1:41:31] problem of God highlighted it in the
[1:41:33] scripture when God did this when God did
[1:41:35] that he judged them and he sent this
[1:41:37] among them he what what did he do he
[1:41:39] said he destroyed their
[1:41:42] inventions
[1:41:44] man so brother don't love the world
[1:41:47] don't love the inventions and they're
[1:41:48] they're they're inventing this and
[1:41:50] inventing that and brother I'll be
[1:41:51] honest it's a there's a lot of Believers
[1:41:54] so-called Christians are attracted by
[1:41:56] those things amen but where is God in
[1:42:00] Simplicity don't be looking for all
[1:42:02] these big things look for the
[1:42:05] simple amen just think God was so simple
[1:42:09] 2,000 years ago and A Man Called Jesus
[1:42:11] that the that the the Jews never
[1:42:13] recognized
[1:42:16] him oh no they said no he's not this
[1:42:21] he's not that you they accused him of
[1:42:24] they accused him of being born of
[1:42:27] fornication oh yeah not not not a virgin
[1:42:30] birth but they felt it was it was
[1:42:34] fornication
[1:42:36] yeah no but he he he bore that sin he
[1:42:39] bore it to just the shame of it for us
[1:42:43] he endured it all for us oh to think
[1:42:45] what they did to him what they said to
[1:42:47] him and brother he could he could have
[1:42:49] spoke the word and and killed him
[1:42:53] huh could have all died but he didn't do
[1:42:55] it he humbled himself humbled himself
[1:42:57] humbled himself and even even when when
[1:42:59] they he told the disciples that what was
[1:43:03] going to happen in Jerusalem and so on
[1:43:05] and then when he he got to the place
[1:43:06] where he was going down to Jerusalem
[1:43:07] Peter tried to stop
[1:43:10] him no no no we don't want you to do
[1:43:14] that and Jesus said get thee behind me
[1:43:17] he didn't say
[1:43:18] Peter he said get the behind me Satan
[1:43:24] brother let's not come under Satan's
[1:43:25] influence when our in our thoughts in
[1:43:28] our motives and our
[1:43:29] objectives but let's let's let let the
[1:43:31] Holy Ghost have the influence amen that
[1:43:34] whatever we do say it's for the glory of
[1:43:37] God keep your spirit right your attitude
[1:43:39] right
[1:43:42] amen so again love not the world neither
[1:43:45] the things that are in the
[1:43:49] world how many of us love the world
[1:43:55] love the things that are some of the
[1:43:57] things that are in the
[1:44:00] world well there's a lot of Believers
[1:44:02] that cut up with the world cut up with
[1:44:05] the things of the world
[1:44:08] yeah God's grace to
[1:44:11] us and it's not necessarily again let me
[1:44:14] remind you don't read the scripture and
[1:44:16] think or is this just talking with the
[1:44:18] sinful things where the Bible says Thou
[1:44:20] shalt not Thou shalt not Thou shalt not
[1:44:22] and so on don't don't do this don't do
[1:44:23] that that's the devil yeah but there are
[1:44:27] things out there that
[1:44:29] that that were attracted to Natural
[1:44:33] Things you
[1:44:36] know it could be your
[1:44:38] house yeah it could be your
[1:44:41] vehicle yeah and again that brother that
[1:44:45] gave brother Brandon the
[1:44:47] catalac gave him a Cadillac yes it was a
[1:44:51] gift to him and brother
[1:44:54] bam he would not drive that Cadillac
[1:44:57] around
[1:44:58] Jeffersonville no
[1:45:00] way because he felt they would think him
[1:45:02] too high or too rich or whatever and so
[1:45:06] on oh that's what he wants the money for
[1:45:08] and so on no he wouldn't drive the
[1:45:11] Cadillac around Jeffersonville and I
[1:45:13] understand that he did allow brother
[1:45:15] George Smith I think to drive it when he
[1:45:17] was sort of courting brother R's
[1:45:20] daughter
[1:45:21] Rebecca and uh
[1:45:24] and our brothers given the
[1:45:26] testimony at the time when he they went
[1:45:28] out and driving and they maybe went into
[1:45:31] a restaurant or something this and this
[1:45:33] and this and they come back to to bring
[1:45:36] sister Rebecca and the car
[1:45:38] back and when he looked in the rearview
[1:45:41] mirror oh who's that somebody was
[1:45:46] following
[1:45:47] him and it was brother
[1:45:49] Brandon he followed them amen and and he
[1:45:54] WR right back to his home again praise

[1:46:35] that's what you're going to focus on
[1:46:36] where you come from why you're here
[1:46:38] where you're going amen not I've seen a
[1:46:42] lot of religious people but they're not
[1:46:44] focusing on Glory they not focusing on
[1:46:46] the kingdom of God they're not focusing
[1:46:48] on eternal life and the new body no no
[1:46:51] they're focusing on this world more than
[1:46:54] the world to come because they like this
[1:46:56] they want to do this they want to do
[1:46:57] that God help us or oh yeah sometimes
[1:47:01] the devil gets into others and and and
[1:47:03] they'll praise praise that person and
[1:47:06] bless that person oh you're good you do
[1:47:07] this you do that oh he's he's tried that

[1:47:42] were sort of amazed at me that I was so
[1:47:44] calm with it and they said what's wrong
[1:47:48] with you I said nothing I said I'm
[1:47:50] looking for it and I said I said where
[1:47:52] it is I said the Lord will show
[1:47:55] us
[1:47:57] oh but they weren't considering the
[1:47:59] Lord they were considering just

[1:48:42] the love that God's looking for is agapa
[1:48:45] love not filio filio is human love agape
[1:48:50] love is divine love it is God's love
[1:48:53] amen how many of us really manifest
[1:48:58] that how many how many of us got that
[1:49:00] recognition from others out there
[1:49:03] friends the same they had William Brown
[1:49:06] they said if there's anything you knew
[1:49:07] about William Bram when you met him he
[1:49:10] said you knew he loved you even though
[1:49:12] he didn't say this didn't say that just
[1:49:14] his attitude his Spirit he said was was
[1:49:16] love
[1:49:18] Yeah amazing so would they say that
[1:49:21] about you
[1:49:24] your attitude your spirit it's like a
[1:49:26] certain sister one time was talking a
[1:49:28] certain Lady of a certain church was
[1:49:30] talking to my
[1:49:31] mother on the phone
[1:49:35] concerning the attitude of a of of well
[1:49:39] it was a Believer supposedly believing
[1:49:41] this message oh yeah and uh and she was
[1:49:45] saying St Stella oh my she I can't bear
[1:49:49] that when they come and visit me

[1:50:05] she said oh and that person is not
[1:50:07] really showing you what they believe
[1:50:10] because she said my son she said Jal and
[1:50:13] his wife she said they believe it and
[1:50:16] she said oh my but she said their spirit
[1:50:18] is so
[1:50:19] different from that other one that
[1:50:21] you're dealing with see there there are
[1:50:24] believers that that Christians like and
[1:50:26] they reverence you respect you and
[1:50:28] there's Believers that they don't like
[1:50:30] oh yeah because they got a really got a
[1:50:32] religious spirit and you're there to
[1:50:34] force this and force that and force
[1:50:36] something else oh no she said she said
[1:50:38] she said my son and and and
[1:50:40] daughter-in-law is not like that she
[1:50:42] says they have a nice spirit and a nice
[1:50:43] attitude and she said they're always
[1:50:45] there to help you yeah
[1:50:49] and and by the way that was the that was
[1:50:52] the lady that that my mother
[1:50:55] saw when she was going beyond the
[1:50:57] curtain of time yeah as I said that and
[1:51:02] that lady was already gone on but she
[1:51:04] appeared to my mother when my mother was
[1:51:06] on her way praise the
[1:51:09] Lord oh brother God help us to be
[1:51:12] spiritual
[1:51:14] amen yes brother I tell you to be
[1:51:16] spiritual you have to have a separation
[1:51:19] from
[1:51:21] unbelief yeah
[1:51:23] and brother God help us to win the
[1:51:25] rapture we got to have a total
[1:51:28] separation from
[1:51:30] unbelief amen we are absolutely cut off
[1:51:35] from all the things of the world Amen
[1:51:37] and you you are with Him amen you walk
[1:51:41] with him talk with him amen by the grace
[1:51:43] of God he's in control amen you're not
[1:51:47] controlled by this world you're
[1:51:48] controlled by the world to
[1:51:50] come amen for all that is in the world
[1:51:53] the lust of the Flesh and the lust of
[1:51:55] the eyes and the pride of life see Satan
[1:52:00] is attracting our attention through what
[1:52:01] we see and feel and smell and hear
[1:52:05] amen he says the pride of life is not
[1:52:08] that's not of the father but is of the
[1:52:11] world and the world passed away and the
[1:52:14] lust thereof but he that doeth the will
[1:52:17] of God abideth
[1:52:20] forever amen and amen amen amen so he
[1:52:24] that is I tell you if you're doing the
[1:52:25] will of God you're totally separated
[1:52:27] from unbelief you believe
[1:52:30] God and before the prophet of God
[1:52:33] preached the
[1:52:34] message in January 64 it was in January
[1:52:39] or not January but April of 61
[1:52:44] 1961 he was preaching on
[1:52:48] Abraham and his seed after him and he
[1:52:52] was exting that God Amen had called for
[1:52:56] a total separation in Abram's life and I
[1:53:00] could have taken took the scriptures
[1:53:02] this morning concerning Abraham and
[1:53:05] Genesis but again it would take another
[1:53:07] hour or so to indicate God calling for a
[1:53:12] total separation from unbelief whether
[1:53:15] it was Abraham having to separate from
[1:53:17] his father where Abraham having to
[1:53:20] separate from lot
[1:53:23] amen it was it was as long as as long as
[1:53:26] he was dealing with his natural father
[1:53:28] Amen brother yeah God didn't deal with
[1:53:33] him didn't deal with Abram but when
[1:53:37] Abraham's father died God called Abraham
[1:53:39] up and he said now Abraham I want to
[1:53:41] show you this this is what I'm going to
[1:53:43] do for you and he said I want you to do
[1:53:46] this amen God was calling for a total
[1:53:49] separation from unbelief in Abraham's
[1:53:52] life
[1:53:53] amen and brother but the issue there was
[1:53:56] another issue concerning this the
[1:53:57] unbelief of his father and the unbelief
[1:54:00] of that one or somebody else brother he
[1:54:02] also had an issue with lot amen and God
[1:54:06] had to had to wait till he and lot
[1:54:09] separated and God allowed this to happen
[1:54:11] that to happen What for to bring a
[1:54:13] separation between Abraham and lot and I
[1:54:16] could go on further to show you other
[1:54:18] things that God had to separate Abraham
[1:54:21] from but Abraham he did at one point
[1:54:24] there he did this he worshiped God he
[1:54:26] made an altar made a sacrifice oh yeah
[1:54:28] and God blessed him but he eventually
[1:54:31] left that area and he went on somewhere
[1:54:33] else and God had to bring him back to
[1:54:35] that area where he had where he had
[1:54:37] offered made made the sacrifice where he
[1:54:40] had made the altar amen when God brought
[1:54:42] him back the altar was still there and
[1:54:44] this was still there amen but see
[1:54:46] Abraham being caught up in the flesh he
[1:54:48] began to go here and go there but God
[1:54:50] wanted him to get back there total
[1:54:52] separation from unbelief amen he had to
[1:54:55] separated him from lot now he was there
[1:54:57] to help lot and anytime that lot needed
[1:55:00] needed help what Abraham and his his men
[1:55:02] as it were went down to to deliver him
[1:55:05] but again God wouldn't allow lot to come
[1:55:08] up and and and and be in that constant
[1:55:11] fellowship with Abraham no no because
[1:55:13] God knew what was in lot's heart and
[1:55:16] when God did bring lot out of it and his
[1:55:18] wife turned and look back don't look
[1:55:20] back for what you came out of
[1:55:24] amen we could bring it again we could
[1:55:26] preach again on all these things but
[1:55:29] what what what lot lot did and what his
[1:55:31] wife did yeah remember Lot's
[1:55:37] wife amen so as Believers we need to if
[1:55:41] God has brought us out let's keep on
[1:55:43] going don't stop and look
[1:55:45] back no no oh maybe I should do this
[1:55:48] maybe I should that no you keep on going
[1:55:49] follow his leadership in your life let
[1:55:51] him do what he wants to do in your life
[1:55:53] by the grace of almighty God amen amen
[1:55:56] amen but there's too many believers they
[1:55:58] make those decisions but not God oh yeah
[1:56:01] they think well the Lord led me to do
[1:56:03] this leted me do that what was it for
[1:56:05] his glory or
[1:56:06] yours was it for his good or
[1:56:09] yours amen and it's unfortunate that
[1:56:12] many they consider what they want to do
[1:56:15] not what God wants them to do brother
[1:56:18] whatever you do you got to do for the
[1:56:20] glory of God amen and brother if if if
[1:56:24] it's a job no matter what it is you're
[1:56:26] doing Do It For the Glory of God

[1:59:30] tell you God still requires it
[1:59:34] amen as he did with them he'll do with
[1:59:36] you and me and in
[1:59:38] 1961 moving forward to the message on
[1:59:41] separation a total separation not a
[1:59:44] partial separation a total from unbelief
[1:59:48] and he said in this message in
[1:59:50] 1961 and what was he me ministering on
[1:59:52] the subject was Abraham and his seed
[1:59:56] after
[1:59:57] him that's you and
[2:00:00] me and he said so now it's by grace that
[2:00:04] God called you not what you
[2:00:07] did he said what you could do what you
[2:00:11] will do and if you're the Seed of
[2:00:14] Abraham God spoke to you by his Amazing

[2:04:36] instrument is Abraham and it represents
[2:04:39] this seed after him and the Covenant was
[2:04:42] made to both Abraham and his seed after

[2:05:12] and election and they heard the voice of
[2:05:14] God and believed God and it was imputed
[2:05:17] to him for
[2:05:19] righteousness and brother
[2:05:22] you say it's imputed to you for
[2:05:23] righteousness because you believe the
[2:05:25] word yeah but the word would only be
[2:05:29] imputed to you for righteousness if you
[2:05:32] have a total separation from
[2:05:35] unbelief amen you got to come separate

[2:06:02] 1965 in
[2:06:04] July not long before the Lord took him
[2:06:07] home he made reference to it
[2:06:12] again and he
[2:06:15] said if I'm a Christian and has been
[2:06:18] filled with the spirit wearing the
[2:06:20] testimony of Jesus Christ's Resurrection

[2:06:49] to push you around and and he said you
[2:06:52] don't do this you don't do
[2:06:54] that he said you do it if God has given
[2:06:59] it to you to
[2:07:01] do and he said we don't have power the
[2:07:04] policemen don't have power to stop in
[2:07:06] one car and sometimes there're three or
[2:07:08] 400 horsepower motor he said what could
[2:07:12] he do about it he said he doesn't have
[2:07:15] the power he has the
[2:07:17] authority
[2:07:19] amen and that's the church we have
[2:07:22] authority by the resurrection of Jesus
[2:07:24] Christ and his promised word Allelujah
[2:07:27] he said the things that I do shall you
[2:07:29] do also and more than this will you do
[2:07:33] for I go to the father don't be ashamed
[2:07:36] of him in this generation sinful perplex
[2:07:40] the last generation that'll ever be on
[2:07:42] the earth the sinful adulterous and full
[2:07:45] of all putrified sores all everything
[2:07:49] that has been decent has become indecent
[2:07:51] decent amen that's

[2:08:02] amen my what would he say
[2:08:05] today he said this 55 years ago or 50
[2:08:08] years ago what would he say
[2:08:10] today considering all that's going on in
[2:08:12] the world now brother I tell you this
[2:08:14] he'd be really looking
[2:08:15] off he would for the Rapture oh he'd be
[2:08:18] warning us amen screeching look look up
[2:08:21] look up look up amen Don't Look Down
[2:08:26] Grace
[2:08:29] amen I didn't mean to read this
[2:08:33] but a lot has happened in the last 55
[2:08:39] years there are many people that we knew
[2:08:42] about and knew their names knew their
[2:08:45] what they did and they're gone now
[2:08:49] they're worldly people but it's amazing
[2:08:51] that most of them are all
[2:08:54] gone you know and of course brother
[2:08:57] Brown did say that certain ones went to
[2:09:00] hell and I believe that I have read the
[2:09:03] testimonies of those that had gone
[2:09:04] beyond the curtain of time and the and
[2:09:07] the Lord even took him down to
[2:09:09] Hell and showed
[2:09:11] them and they were
[2:09:13] surprised concerning the ones they
[2:09:17] saw yeah and of course brother Brown did
[2:09:21] say that I think Elvis pres was in hell
[2:09:24] and I think one of them testimonies I
[2:09:27] read over the years that they also when
[2:09:30] they went down to hell they saw
[2:09:33] Elvis and they saw this person and that
[2:09:35] person they were
[2:09:37] shocked yeah as the prophet of God said
[2:09:40] again he said you're going to be
[2:09:41] surprised who made it and you'll be
[2:09:44] surprised who didn't make
[2:09:45] it you think this brother's going to
[2:09:47] make it that sister's going to make it
[2:09:49] no
[2:09:52] you want to Sur surprise they never made
[2:09:55] it no never made it he didn't make it
[2:09:58] she didn't make it you know God knows
[2:10:00] the
[2:10:02] heart and God allows these things to
[2:10:05] happen in your life let this this thing
[2:10:07] to happen that thing to happen you got
[2:10:09] to deal with this you got to deal with
[2:10:10] that you know what God's doing he's
[2:10:11] bringing out what's in your
[2:10:15] heart
[2:10:16] yeah he's what for it'll it'll be a
[2:10:20] confirmation whether you you are born
[2:10:21] again or not born again but if you born
[2:10:24] again you're a new creature on the
[2:10:26] inside of the
[2:10:27] inside oh yes so but God allows many
[2:10:31] things to happen to bring it out amen so
[2:10:35] that the world's not going to judge you
[2:10:36] and said oh well he's not born again
[2:10:38] she's not born again look what look at
[2:10:40] the attitude they got look at the Spirit
[2:10:42] they got yeah God help us keep your
[2:10:45] attitude right your spirit right
[2:10:49] amen and he said this
[2:10:53] this let me read it he said way back in
[2:10:57] the jungles of
[2:10:58] Africa on Safari Hunters they had to
[2:11:02] take ey powerered radios to hear Alvis
[2:11:07] Presley
[2:11:10] amazing but and Pat Boone and them guys
[2:11:14] with that rock and roll and twist and
[2:11:16] the natives trying to see them act along
[2:11:20] jerking their Ed and acting like that
[2:11:22] the natives stood and looked at looked
[2:11:24] at it yeah it was Americans over there
[2:11:28] haunting but back then I guess the
[2:11:31] Africans would know about it but back
[2:11:33] then they were wondering what in the
[2:11:35] world they doing it was
[2:11:37] noisy you know but the Americans were
[2:11:40] enjoying it but the Africans
[2:11:43] weren't yeah but I guess they would
[2:11:45] enjoy it now cuz that's many many years
[2:11:49] God help us brother amen man he said the
[2:11:52] natives stood and looked at it but you
[2:11:55] see they're not
[2:11:56] Americans like Pat Boone Alvis Presley
[2:11:59] Ricky Nelson and them guys and he said
[2:12:02] they are not judices of that
[2:12:06] type because elv was pretty I think Bop
[2:12:10] you were shocked that he was
[2:12:13] Pentecostal Elvis yeah that's the church
[2:12:16] he was raised in but then he got out and
[2:12:18] he started to rock and roll and that
[2:12:20] they said
[2:12:21] because in Elvis and those that have
[2:12:23] seen maybe a video of him or something
[2:12:25] and that's why he he would he wouldn't
[2:12:27] just St up there and sing you know he'd
[2:12:29] be very
[2:12:31] active and you know and he'd be going
[2:12:33] all over the place and up and down and
[2:12:35] they said where did he learn that he
[2:12:37] said he learned that in the Pentecost
[2:12:39] church he said regarding those that
[2:12:42] danced in the
[2:12:43] spirit oh I said that's true so what he
[2:12:47] did was he went out and took that out
[2:12:49] with him but with and roll and worldly
[2:12:52] music and he would dance but it wasn't
[2:12:55] the right Spirit certainly wasn't giving
[2:12:58] God the glory no definitely not and yet
[2:13:01] we know we do know too that wherever he
[2:13:06] went to
[2:13:08] perform and he went and and they had
[2:13:10] this program they sang All these rock
[2:13:12] and roll stuff songs and yet when he
[2:13:15] went back to his
[2:13:17] hotel where they were
[2:13:19] staying he'd only seen s
[2:13:22] hymns I said what yes he said we've got
[2:13:26] the testimony said from from those other
[2:13:29] musicians and singers they said oh yeah
[2:13:32] Elvis want just want to sing hymns in
[2:13:34] the hotel said
[2:13:36] what why I guess to satisfy his his
[2:13:40] conviction but he wouldn't respond it
[2:13:42] with he wouldn't respond to it with
[2:13:44] repentance he just responded with with
[2:13:47] hymns brother that don't save you
[2:13:51] amen not by any means no repentance
[2:13:55] brings you into
[2:13:57] salvation
[2:14:00] amen so but Alvis Presley again there's
[2:14:05] many many of s singer gospel
[2:14:11] singer that uh they're gone on to now
[2:14:14] because they' be in their 80s and 90s
[2:14:16] and but then they they also experienced
[2:14:18] Elvis oh yeah and Elvis and they they
[2:14:21] went and got together with Elvis and
[2:14:22] sang A himym and did this did that oh
[2:14:25] yeah
[2:14:27] amazing yeah and uh and there's two or
[2:14:31] three of them were going on now and they
[2:14:33] spent a lot of time with Elvis and and
[2:14:35] Elvis they said Alvis just loved love to
[2:14:38] frost the sink yeah yeah but Elvis kept
[2:14:42] on going in the world and the things of
[2:14:46] the world yeah God have mercy
[2:14:52] he said the spirit is not only in
[2:14:54] America it has spread itself all over
[2:14:56] the world to bring them to the battle of
[2:14:59] Armageddon and they act like that they
[2:15:01] said whatever Nation they come from
[2:15:03] Africa India wherever it is that vulgar
[2:15:06] and stuff has spread all over the Earth
[2:15:09] by just one man starting it Elvis
[2:15:12] started rock and roll and it went around
[2:15:14] the
[2:15:16] world and so as the gospel and the power
[2:15:19] of almighty God as spread around the
[2:15:21] world and the separation time is now
[2:15:23] taking place when God is calling a bride
[2:15:27] and the devil is calling a
[2:15:29] church but God devil got a church God
[2:15:32] got a
[2:15:34] bride so he said let me be part of the
[2:15:36] Bride amen again that was in the message
[2:15:40] called ashamed
[2:15:43] 1965
[2:15:45] amen and I guess we're going to to leave
[2:15:47] it again to another I was open this
[2:15:51] maybe I'll finish today and I'll get
[2:15:53] brother Jonathan the
[2:15:55] minister
[2:15:56] no so we'll see what the Lord would have
[2:15:59] us
[2:16:00] do
[2:16:03] amen oh yes I shared these quotes with
[2:16:06] you on uh Wednesday I
[2:16:17] believe he said if we believe the word
[2:16:20] of God
[2:16:21] it's the Word of Life To Us amen and if
[2:16:26] we question the word of God it's death
[2:16:28] to us amen that's
[2:16:32] true oh my God help us understand that
[2:16:36] it's
[2:16:37] life oh yeah right from the the the
[2:16:41] beginning is death the end is eternal
[2:16:44] life and we're told don't add to it
[2:16:46] don't take from it amen that's right
[2:16:51] from from the beginning amen it came
[2:16:53] from eternity into time and man did what
[2:16:57] he did in time in believing the devil
[2:17:00] really it was the woman but the man put
[2:17:02] himself in death with the woman trusting
[2:17:05] that God would redeem her when he
[2:17:08] redeemed him him now and that's why
[2:17:11] that's why Adam stepped out there with
[2:17:13] with Eve and and sinned yeah grace of
[2:17:17] God but brother again right from the fog
[2:17:21] see God is calling a to Total separation
[2:17:23] from
[2:17:24] unbelief but Eve left Adam and went
[2:17:28] out to see the tree in the in tree of
[2:17:32] knowledge of Good and Evil she wanted to
[2:17:35] see what that was all about oh yeah Adam
[2:17:38] didn't go out looking for it now
[2:17:39] remember they they were having
[2:17:41] fellowship with
[2:17:42] God because during the during the
[2:17:45] evening they go over and fellowship with
[2:17:47] God and maybe the the god that they were
[2:17:49] fellowshiping with was the pillar of
[2:17:50] Fire
[2:17:51] you know but they had a revelation of
[2:17:53] God they saw God they knew it was God
[2:17:56] and even after they sinned and they went
[2:17:57] into the trees and they they hid
[2:17:59] themselves among the Trees of the garden
[2:18:02] and yeah and God came Adam where are you
[2:18:05] where are
[2:18:06] you and they instead of well before they
[2:18:10] were glad God saw them but now they said
[2:18:13] we hate them because we they they didn't
[2:18:15] want God to see this they want God
[2:18:16] because they knew they were naked before
[2:18:19] they
[2:18:19] didn't see we're going to a
[2:18:22] perfect
[2:18:24] Kingdom amen thank the Lord I think
[2:18:27] we'll have a weit r on and so on but
[2:18:30] again by the grace of God but again
[2:18:34] there won't be there won't be no
[2:18:35] knowledge of sin no feelings of
[2:18:38] sin no no not by any means by the grace
[2:18:42] of God Amen but God allowed all this to
[2:18:45] happen for a reason amen all down
[2:18:48] through time Old Testament New Testament
[2:18:51] I pray God that he that he
[2:18:53] is revealing in us what he wants to
[2:18:57] reveal amen bringing out in you and me
[2:18:59] what he wants to bring out and
[2:19:03] brother you're going to testify of God
[2:19:05] or testify of the
[2:19:07] devil your life what you do and how you
[2:19:10] do it who's in control
[2:19:14] amen
[2:19:17] Grace listen he said
[2:19:21] Jesus and or rather God has always
[2:19:24] separated he said in Genesis he
[2:19:26] separated he separated the waters from
[2:19:29] the sea he said he separated life from
[2:19:32] death and if we believe the word of God
[2:19:35] it's the Word of Life to us but if we
[2:19:37] question the word of God it's death to
[2:19:39] us for God has spoken who can deny it
[2:19:43] amen and he said if we question the word
[2:19:45] of God then it becomes
[2:19:47] death amen like Eve
[2:19:51] Eve questioned one little phase of God's
[2:19:54] word and what did it do it caused all
[2:19:57] this trouble that we have but you see
[2:20:01] there Came Death and then God also at an
[2:20:04] atonement being merciful to us he
[2:20:07] accepted a substitute death for their
[2:20:10] death and he separated life from Death
[2:20:13] also in the Garden of Eden and he did it
[2:20:16] by his word amen yes is all the word
[2:20:20] amen
[2:20:22] amazing that whatever God has done
[2:20:24] whatever God is doing it's his word stay
[2:20:27] with the word don't add to it don't take
[2:20:30] from it it is forever settled in Heaven
[2:20:34] by the grace of God the word
[2:20:37] amen but yet man under the anointing of
[2:20:41] the devil sometimes he'll change
[2:20:45] it he said he separated life from Death
[2:20:48] In the Garden of Eden he did it by his

[2:22:56] amen and if we love him we love his word
[2:22:58] we love one
[2:23:00] another because in the beginning was the
[2:23:02] word the word was with God the Word was
[2:23:04] God and the Word was made flesh and
[2:23:07] dwell Among Us and now the word made
[2:23:09] flesh
[2:23:10] again in you and in
[2:23:12] me yeah by the grace of
[2:23:14] God you're going forth you're reflecting
[2:23:17] the word amen Grace
[2:23:20] and he said Jesus has constantly told us
[2:23:23] that there is a separation and we find
[2:23:26] that the last thing that's predicted to
[2:23:28] the human race before the great final
[2:23:31] day when we Ascend into the presence of
[2:23:34] God there will be a final
[2:23:39] separation God is all down Through the
[2:23:41] Ages and even the church ages he has
[2:23:43] separated separated separated because in
[2:23:46] every age when God did what he he did
[2:23:49] and it was a Revival
[2:23:51] but after the Revival they went into a
[2:23:53] denomination and when it comes to the
[2:23:55] these right here they went into IR Paul
[2:23:58] ireneus and Martin what happened after
[2:24:00] after they were taken off the scene
[2:24:02] everything went into a into organized
[2:24:04] religion and it was around 300 ad and
[2:24:08] that that's when the Catholic church was
[2:24:10] formed amen they had the I don't have
[2:24:13] the time to get into scripture and show
[2:24:14] you the spirits that Jesus was concerned
[2:24:16] of in the seeven in the seven Church
[2:24:19] ages and there was a spirit in the first
[2:24:21] one the second one the third one amen
[2:24:24] and whereas it went from a just a spirit
[2:24:27] and influence in their lives it became a
[2:24:28] Doctrine and after the doctrine it
[2:24:30] became a church yeah they they formed
[2:24:33] the first organized church and that's
[2:24:36] that's where then that everybody had to
[2:24:37] come in and listen to the listen to the
[2:24:39] priest and listen to the to the pope and
[2:24:42] so on but God started to Revival and
[2:24:45] brought it out then another and that
[2:24:47] that Revival organized and became
[2:24:50] another church and then he start went on
[2:24:52] to another one right here and we know
[2:24:54] that it went for so long but when the
[2:24:56] third or fourth generation came on the
[2:24:58] scene what do they do they made they
[2:25:00] made a denomination they made an or
[2:25:02] church organization based on
[2:25:05] justification amen and that's it we
[2:25:08] believe period but if you're a Believer
[2:25:11] you believe
[2:25:13] plus whatever God's going to reveal to
[2:25:16] you next right amen so they they believe
[2:25:19] period and that's it and it became a
[2:25:22] just maybe a Lutheran denomination a
[2:25:23] Lutheran organization but God started a
[2:25:26] Revival through Wesley and
[2:25:28] sanctification they they denominated
[2:25:30] around sanctification then God went on
[2:25:32] and started a Revival well actually it
[2:25:34] was Pentecost amen and brother Brown
[2:25:37] said he said this message is the
[2:25:39] crowning of the Pentecostal message this
[2:25:42] is Ministry but he said Pentecost don't
[2:25:44] recognize that or they wanted brother
[2:25:46] Brown to come and pray for the sick they
[2:25:47] wanted brother Brown brother Brandon
[2:25:49] brother Brandon and and the sign in his
[2:25:51] hand and and the discernment and all
[2:25:52] that love that praise the Lord Allelujah
[2:25:54] they were screaming that's right but
[2:25:56] when he started to get into the word
[2:25:58] they said no they turned their back on
[2:26:00] him amen amazing yeah so so in this
[2:26:05] Pentecostal Revival it takes God takes
[2:26:08] us on to a bride Revival amen and he's
[2:26:12] calling us to open the
[2:26:15] door amen by the grace of God and he'll
[2:26:18] come in with us and and us with him amen
[2:26:21] the word becomes flesh again for the
[2:26:24] resurrection and the Rapture Amen to God
[2:26:28] be the glory
[2:26:31] amen so he said we are in the hour of
[2:26:34] the final
[2:26:36] separation and he will separate the
[2:26:38] sheep from the goats and as I said when
[2:26:40] when they started denomination God
[2:26:42] separated this his seed and moved them
[2:26:44] on they organized there but another
[2:26:46] generation rose up and he moved them on
[2:26:49] Amen hallah Hallelujah moved moved him
[2:26:51] on to Pentecost but now we're going
[2:26:55] from the message of the hour to the
[2:26:59] Rapture the married supper of the Lamb
[2:27:02] by the grace of God Amen this is
[2:27:06] tremendous don't don't think God's going
[2:27:08] to look back and just require this or
[2:27:11] just require that no no what what is he
[2:27:14] doing that's what he requires that's
[2:27:17] what gives us the faith to go on Amen
[2:27:19] but the grace of God and praying Grace
[2:27:23] that we're going to get the faith for
[2:27:24] the Rapture and go
[2:27:26] up but understand to a number of people
[2:27:29] that I W was witnessing to there
[2:27:32] recently and I noticed that they kept
[2:27:35] asking the
[2:27:37] question uh you believe in heaven I said
[2:27:40] yes we believe in heaven oh okay good
[2:27:44] good and I thought why in the world
[2:27:46] would they ask that question you know
[2:27:48] believe in heaven so we're going to go
[2:27:50] to heaven but then we're going to come
[2:27:52] back why because he's going to create a
[2:27:55] new Heaven and a new
[2:27:58] Earth amen where there is no sin and by
[2:28:02] the grace of God we're going to live in
[2:28:04] the New Jerusalem in the new Heaven and
[2:28:07] the New Earth by the grace of
[2:28:09] God
[2:28:11] Amen so the Lord bless us and brother
[2:28:14] we're going to meet meet the Lutheran
[2:28:17] now meet those that were in Wesley's
[2:28:19] Revival the real true seed there's a
[2:28:22] Lutheran Revival and on down all that
[2:28:24] God God has called but again the few
[2:28:27] chosen is the bride praise the Lord
[2:28:30] thank God for such
[2:28:32] Revelation
[2:28:34] amen so he said it's a final separation
[2:28:37] and he will separate the sheep from the
[2:28:40] goats amen so I trust for sheep not a
[2:28:47] goat oh well you meet goats and they're
[2:28:51] always Buton butt butt butt butt yeah no
[2:28:55] butt amen just Faith believe the word
[2:29:00] and he said God will continually and has
[2:29:02] been separating separating and that's
[2:29:04] what he's doing tonight amen that's what
[2:29:08] he always does and he said he separates
[2:29:11] Faith from
[2:29:12] unbelief he speaks out he declares
[2:29:16] himself to those who will believe him
[2:29:18] and have faith in him
[2:29:20] amen and we find out in Numbers Chapter
[2:29:23] 6 that a nazarites call he said was as
[2:29:27] to separate themselves from all the
[2:29:29] world to the word of God that's a
[2:29:32] Nazarite call separate amen and we find
[2:29:37] out that Samson was a nazarit unto the
[2:29:39] Lord
[2:29:42] separated and he said I think today when
[2:29:44] we see our sisters wearing long hair and
[2:29:46] the Bible said they should I think as a
[2:29:49] Nazarite son that they want to follow
[2:29:51] the Lord
[2:29:54] amen and he said I know that sounds
[2:29:57] flat I want it to go home it looks like
[2:30:00] somebody is trying to do something that
[2:30:03] God told them to do no matter what the
[2:30:05] price the world has to say about it he
[2:30:08] said out there how many scornful
[2:30:12] laughters and critics that doesn't
[2:30:15] bother a person that's totally separated
[2:30:19] from the things of the world world to
[2:30:21] the things of God they'll obey the word
[2:30:25] they'll separate themselves from the
[2:30:26] things of the world because the word
[2:30:28] separates them and if you're believing
[2:30:31] the word in your heart in your soul it
[2:30:34] will keep separating you from the world
[2:30:36] and the things of the world love not the
[2:30:38] world or the things of the world Amen
[2:30:41] grace of God Amen if you believe the
[2:30:44] word it'll keep separating you amen
[2:30:53] I know that sounds flat the world has to
[2:30:56] say about it he said how many scornful
[2:30:59] laughters critics it doesn't bother a
[2:31:01] person that's totally separated from the
[2:31:03] things of the world to the things of God
[2:31:06] they'll obey the word and separate
[2:31:08] themselves from the things of the world
[2:31:11] because the word separates them amen
[2:31:15] keep walking in the light believe in the
[2:31:16] word amen and you'll get it there'll be
[2:31:19] a greater in a greater separation from
[2:31:22] or it will come
[2:31:26] yeah from the world and it might be some
[2:31:29] cases it will be eventually they
[2:31:31] separate it'll get a greater and a
[2:31:33] greater separation from the family
[2:31:35] friends and nature nature and yes
[2:31:38] neighbors yeah oh yeah because the more
[2:31:42] spiritual you
[2:31:43] get the more religious your neighbor
[2:31:46] gets
[2:31:48] yeah they don't they don't consider you
[2:31:50] to be religious if you're just spiritual
[2:31:53] they feel there's something wrong with
[2:31:55] you yeah so God help us but again there
[2:31:58] will be a few that will be friends of
[2:32:00] the
[2:32:00] Bride amen thank
[2:32:05] god let's
[2:32:09] see the world always knows its own but
[2:32:13] as I have said remember criticism on
[2:32:16] account of the word of God is only
[2:32:19] growing pain of his grace
[2:32:22] amen it shows that you have separated
[2:32:25] yourself to be a
[2:32:27] Christian act like a Christian live like
[2:32:30] a Christian and obey every commandment
[2:32:33] of God it's a Nazarite vow to separate a
[2:32:37] call from God that separates you from
[2:32:39] the things of the
[2:32:41] world Amen well brother I tell you
[2:32:45] closer you get to

[2:33:54] oh he
[2:33:57] said God has one way of bringing light
[2:34:00] to you and that's when you're ready to
[2:34:03] separate yourself from all the things of
[2:34:05] the world and all the cares of the world
[2:34:07] and cling only to God's promised word
[2:34:11] amen Paul was a
[2:34:14] Nazarite Aaron was a Nazarite amen
