to see brother Chad sister Leah back amen we miss each one when we go when they go and then we know that Blanc is traveling to California tomorrow so we want to remember her in prayer and then brother Isaac and sister kzzie I think are also leaving this weekend is that right so we want to remember God's grace to them amen I've been working to find a minister for camp and I I do have an announcement for a speaker for this year and we will have brother Aaron Oglesby come up and preach for us this year and I've also preemptively booked brother Craig Boer for next year so uh we'll see uh what the Lord would have there um but uh brother Aaron will come up this year and brother Craig Boer next year Lord willing I've been talking to a number of other ministers about coming up to preach over the next 6 to9 months as well so we'll see what the Lord would lead but but we want to be in prayer not only for brother Aaron coming up shortly but also brother Paul LaFontaine and brother Jerry Fury as they come up to do our special meetings amen want to remember brother Paul Gail or Paul Gail I guess we can call him brother I guess maybe but uh I went in to visit him on Sunday and he was due to go into surgery on Monday to have a screw uh adjusted in his spine because it was touching the nerve and they went and adjusted it and uh he still had issues so he went back in today to get it readjusted so he's really struggling there with that that back surgery that fusion surgery that he got but that said I was able to have a chat with him and his wife and she had many questions about what we believe and why we believe it so in it all amen we we testify of God and we just trust that he's in all of these things so certainly keep them in prayer I'm hoping to get to see them uh sometime this weekend Lord willing I've got a family to take care of full-time now so we'll see how that works out but uh just remember them in prayer amen this is this is part of being a Believer it's not just the preaching of the word and these different things but it's going to those that are in need and holding up those that that have need of what we have amen and trusting God to do something that they would get a testimony that he's alive and well amen Hebrews 138 it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen let's turn to the scriptures if we would John 15 and verse 16 says ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you we're going to talk about some of that choosing today he says I have chosen you and in that Cho chesing he says I have ordained you that you should go forth go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain he says that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you amen God bless you you can have your seats this evening and we're continuing on our series on manifesting time this adoption series and I want to take yet another fourth series on adoption by position and we're going to or authority by position and I want to spend some time on David today because in David we see this clear progression and he he he goes from being just another boy to being an anointed boy to being an established young man to being persecuted to being an outlaw and all the way to being a king and we see this beautiful transformation of a person's life and the difference is always that anointing that comes on him amen and I I want us to see that this idea of progression of an anointed child of God because we need to understand the idea of progressing in our walk with God Amen that that people can think well as soon as you got the Holy Ghost you've got everything yes you have the potential for everything inside of you amen but it's got to bring your life into subjection it's got to bring your mind into subjection it's got to bring your body into subjection and it's got to prove you and train you and all of these things and so we don't just get the Holy Ghost and then have everything manifested in their life that we're supposed to have but it takes a while for us to get the strength and the knowledge and the understanding and the wisdom of the word of God and and get it to come out at our lives amen and so we're growing at all times the scripture says that Jesus grew in wisdom and stature and favor with God and man and that did not stop at Jordan but it continued to grow and mature all the way up until he came to his Mount Transfiguration adoption experience amen and so we see even in Ephesians 4 this idea of progression Paul says he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the saints that word perfecting doesn't mean sinless Perfection but it means for the maturing of the Saints so if we need maturing that means we don't start out mature amen it means that we start immature if we want to put it that way and the purpose of the five full ministry is to bring us into a place of being mature Believers in the Gospel of Jesus Christ he says it's for the maturing the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry and for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man a mature man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ so we can't get out of here and until we're all mature we're all mature in the word amen we're mature Sons and Daughters of God we're all living our lives in the same place so to speak why he says that we henceforth be no more children that means we were children we are born children we are Christian children but yet we are children nonetheless that we be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the Slate of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive he says but speak speaking in Truth and Love We may grow up we've got to grow up we've got to increase in our understanding increase in our nature increase in our wisdom increase in the way that we react relative to the way that Christ would react that we may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ amen so we've got to grow into our position in Christ and the prophet of God would say this he says every seed of God correctly placed will sure notice he says correctly placed have you ever noticed when you start a a plant out now I don't have a green thumb I don't profess to but I know we've got people in here that like to plant plants and so many times what do we do we don't plant them outside what do we do we take them and we take a seed or a couple seeds and we put them inside a little pot in the house or we put them inside of a a greenhouse where it's nice and warm and it's it's you know heated warmer than what's outside side and and so that plank gets all of the sunshine when they're Sunshine but the winds and the storms they don't they don't cause it problems because it's protected but in those conditions that seed starts to grow and it it it comes forth and it blossoms out and it breaks the ground and we start to see that yes there's something growing but we notice very quickly even in those shelter conditions it starts to outgrow the pot and so you have to either move it into a bigger pot or you have to move it out doors and so what do we do then is we take it and we put it someplace else and now it starts to face the challenges of being a real plant but under that it starts to dig deeper Roots it starts to become more resistant to disease and insects and these things and pretty soon it grows into a fully mature plant Paul says we've got to grow into our position in Christ and we see even in in different churches I was talking to Brother Steve clar about this he says our church in Edmonton is purely Evangelical it is meant to bring people to Christ to show them the truth of this end time message and he says that's what we did all the time and so what would happen is they would be plant they would be Planters they would get people to Christ but what would happen pretty soon is those people would move to other churches that have a different style of ministry why because they needed to be matured they needed to be stabilized they needed to be settled and so they had a lot of churn in their Church By Design because God had put a Ministry there to get plants to start growing but then they had to move to another church to continue to grow and mature and there's nothing wrong with that that's what the ministry is for is to take us all the way from the planting to the Harvest and everything in between and and so we've got to be placed what we see here is we've got to be placed someplace where we can mature and that doesn't mean it has to be in this church amen I've said it before if we're not fed here then we need to go someplace else if you're not fed under this ministry you need to go someplace else make sure it's not me and make sure that it's not you make sure that it's the leading of God but if you're not fed here go someplace where you can be fed because there's a god-ordained pastor out there for every child of God that's here that's what Ephesians 4 is telling us that there's somebody that's there that'll bring you into full maturity so we're not fertile ground for every type of Christian some people need more Fellowship some people need a broader base of ministry and more people coming in in those things that's what they need and we don't always have that but we do need to be correctly place and the correct placing is always in the word of God that's the thing that is common amongst all the five full ministry is they'll place you in the word of God not on themselves not on gifts not on signs and wonders they'll place you on the word of God and if you sit under the preaching of anointed hearing of the word then what you're going to mature and you're going to grow that's the way it works amen the holy spirit will always lead us to a place where we will mature he'll take us to a place that'll challenge us sometimes that's what drives people away is they get challenged and they don't like the challenge they don't like the personality of being challenged but it's the holy spirit that does those things and it brings us up because it's trying to get us to a higher place in our walk with Christ brother Brown would say this he says you can't expect a baby to be born a man you can't start at the top you can't just go into the water and come out and you're the superch Christian that's not the way it works he says it's got to grow to it and we grow in Christ to the full stature not somebody get converted tonight and tomorrow go to preach preach the gospel he says we grow up into manhood enter into the stature of Christ amen so it doesn't matter how long we've been going to church doesn't matter what Ministry we've been sitting under you've got to grow in Christ and that only comes by the Holy Spirit the only thing that'll make you an adult in the body is the holy spirit because otherwise you're just a child and remember you might be you might he said the scripture says though an heir yet still only a son just like a servant you're just like a servant because you haven't matured and it takes the Holy Spirit to tutor us and guide us and we've got these carnal bodies and these carnal minds and we've got these experiences and we've got emotions and all these things that have to be brought subject to the word and we're brought subject by the spirit that's the thing that overcomes us amen but once you get that Holy Ghost you are changed forever you are changed forever and I mean I believe everyone here that's got the Holy Ghost can say from that day on I was never the same again and I praise the Lord for that I wasn't perfect but I was never the same again amen there was no going back to what I used to be and so we always grow and mature in Christ in this walk and we can't we can't ever come to the place where we say I've made it we'll make it when we're gone we'll make it when we're gone amen you know I was reading in judges we're talking about Authority by position and the moving of the spirit in our lives and it was talking about Samson and it says this we're talking about the idea of progression here it says and the spirit of the Lord began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between zor and tell in other words it didn't say Samson just got all of this anointing and with that came all of this power all the time that's not the way Samson worked and that's not the way God worked God started what working in Samson's life and began to work in his life at times and so he began to move on Samson to do this and Samson to do that and what's God trying to do he's trying to get Samson to realize what his call is in his life and he's also testing Samson to see what he's going to do and when look at Samson we're going to spend more time with David this morning but or this afternoon but but Samson you'll see has an occasional experience with the spirit do you ever notice that in scripture Samson lived just like the rest of us do as normal people if we wanted to put it that way but then it would say and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon Samson and all of a sudden he tears a lion apart or he he goes and catches 300 Foxes or he goes and kills 100 Philistines it's the spirit of God on Samson that made him special or made him powerful brother Brandon was say he was just a runt nothing to look at him he wasn't some big Arnold Schwarzenegger out there but he was a just a normal man but that Spirit would come on him and he would do Mighty Deeds but the problem with Samson is that outside of that anointing he was very flawed and we see what happens is he kept getting into problems with women and these things but yet God continued to use him and he judged Israel for 20 years without any issues but then he got caught up in something else and even in that God used him and the spirit of God came on on him and he killed more in his death than he had killed in his entire life that's what the anointing will do on a person but we want to see David because David's experience with the anointing is different than Samson's and we see a much greater progression with with David here amen we'll see that David has he he gets this anointing he moves towards being a king but yet he never does it himself the anointing is what makes the difference now I want to take us back and we're just going to go through this quickly I know that brother Paul has spoken on this and and many times I've even spoken on it so I just want to lay a bit of a foundation on it here and it says and Samuel said unto Jesse are here all thy children and he said There remaineth Yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep and Samuel said unto Jesse send and fetch him for will not sit down till he come hither and he sent and brought him in now he was Ruddy and with all of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look to and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is he the youngest the least significant it says then Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward so Samuel rose up and went to Rama so we see here this picture where all of the young men that that are the sons of Jesse have come before before Samuel and each one looks good to him from the youngest all the way down to the second youngest and each one he thinks would be a good King but God says no it's not him it's not him it's not him and then and then David comes up and he says this is is the one and there's nothing looking at David that would suggest there's kingly material inside of him that's the that's the sight of God that's the sovereignty of God as he sees the inside of the inside and he knows what he's ordained for each and every purpose but David gets his anointing to be king here and historians believe he was only 12 or 13 years old here can you imagine you that are 12 or 13 or 14 you've got a king anointing on you and this isn't just un anointing church this is the spirit of God there's only one the spirit and that's the holy spirit this is the spirit of God on David as a 12 or 13year old and the purpose of this anointing is to do what mature him to the place where he can be a king it's a king anointing and the anointing that's on you will bring you to your position amen it will bring you to position and how does it do that it prepares you and it places you in the situations you need to be in to get you to learn learn what you need to learn amen that's what the purpose of the holy spirit is is to bring us into maturity so we can step into our purpose in the body of Christ that's what we're here to do amen each and every one of us it brings us to our original condition is really what it's doing amen but it gives you three main things it gives you overcoming power first and foremost over yourself that's what maturity is is when you put self aside amen when we look at us as a as spouses when we look at ourselves as adults and when we look at ourselves as parents maturity comes when you can set selfishness aside and you can act based on what's right and good rather than what's best for you second thing it gives us so it's first power over yourself the Holy Spirit the second thing that gives you is power over the world and the things of the world it separates you amen it separates you from those things from from ungodly influences from the lusts of the flesh from all these things that Satan throw at us and then the third thing after he you the the Holy Spirit conquers you is he conquers those things that are around you and that's when you step into position and now it's power over Satan and his kingdom and that's where you have the the the the power and the authority now for liberty for for casting out demons for Healing The Sick for for prayers having a real effect in these different things it's Ministry time then that's the third effect of of the Holy Spirit remember what brother Bram said he says the holy spirit is power for what service service so the first thing it does is It prepares you for service and then it gets you to live the word and then it gets you to act by the word amen It prepares you and then it starts to push you out into service for the people around you and we see that this happens with David because that anointing on David took him from a Shepherd to a warrior Shepherd to a political Shepherd if we want to call it that way to a musical shepherd He was the greatest Shepherd ever until Christ came he turned a God turned that anointing turned David into a Shepherd the world had never seen before this was a a young man that that developed the reputation for being great just by being out with Sheep amen we look at at David and and we see that God doesn't need us to go find a place for him to work on us God will take us exactly where we need to be and he'll bring every situation and every influence and every training bit our way to to get us to what he needs us to be we don't have David didn't have to go look him for a fight the fight came to David the lion came to David the bear came to David Goliath came to David David didn't go seeking a fight David didn't go seeking training David didn't seek anything David went to where God wanted him to be and he stayed there and in that staying God trained him into exactly what David was supposed to be God put him in situations that required him to step up in his walk with god listen to this brother B says and each one of us is born for something we weren't just put here for nothing that mountain he says never happened out there just to be that tree was put there for a purpose everything is for a purpose it's God to serve he says and we're here for a purpose don't despise where God has got you don't despise where God has got you imagine David now and he's he's watching over the sheep and if he was caral he'd be saying oh I'm supposed to be a The King and I could be out there learning to fight and train and I could be doing so much more with my life no David wasn't out there sighing and crying for for the miserable Place God had placed him David was happy to be doing what he was doing he didn't despise where God had put him he says but serve your purpose there's coming a great Victory Day one of these days where the battle is over so God knows how to prepare us and he takes us there his way not our way it's always a path of his choing choosing knowing what we're supposed to be I've said this before doesn't make us ready to be it amen knowing you're supposed to be a king doesn't make you ready to be a king we know that because God didn't Place David for 15 more years after Goliath he wasn't ready to be it though he was anointed yet he had to be prepared amen David's exploits all came after his anointing he didn't kill the lion he didn't kill the bear until after he was anointed he doesn't come to Goliath until he's anointed as well and these things take years and years it takes time and God knows how to work it out so that when the situation comes up we're ready for it amen you say I don't know how I'm going to handle where I'm at in my life I don't know how to handle the troubles that have come up listen God has prepared you if you're a holy ghost filled son or daughter of God God has prepared you for this moment amen he's prepared you he knows how to work it out brother BR says this he says God trains men and bring brings them up he says it's his purpose it's his purpose that he's preparing you for and it's his purpose to prepare you for those things he says time is with man see we get caught up in the time element we think we've got to push it we've got to rush it we've got to get it done the word says it's going to happen so we got to get it going no God will get it going in his time and when he does it he does it perfectly and there's no stopping it he says time is with man eternity is with God and I love what David because David never changes himself and David never attempts to change his situation in fact you'll see David is usually having to react by running for his life to keep from taking the kingship David's actually trying to keep from pressing in and grabbing what God has already promised him and so David's either running for his life or he's protecting somebody else from something unjust you know that like the most police uh you know uh uh divisions and and groups their models to Serve and Protect all you see with David is to Serve and Protect why because that's what Kings do is they protect those that are under their care and all you see with David is he's constantly trying to protect those that are around him why there's an anointing that's pushing him to do those things and placing him inside of those positions but you notice he stays right where God has put him until his authority moves him elsewhere David never jumps the queue they never tries to get ahead David just goes with the flow of what God's doing in his life and there's a lesson there brother Brown says but brother and sister you better know what you're doing he says you better be careful and you better be sure that you understand he says don't walk out there stay right where God's called you until you know what you're doing for it's a dangerous thing you can't just walk around slinging this word you got to know that you know that you know that God has called you to do certain things remember the seven sons of Sia in the name of Jesus whom Paul preaches they tried to cash out Devils what did they do they they presumed brother brandham said and that devil said those Devils said Jesus we know Paul we know who are you and it ripped the clothes off of them and ran them naked down the street it made a laughing stock of the gospel because they tried to pretend they were something they weren't amen David couldn't say I'm anointed to be king and therefore I'm going to be a king right now no he had to wait for that anointing to prepare him before it would Place him and we see that David's challenges just start ratcheting up and up and up and and what he experienced as a Shepherd prepared him for his next challenge which would be Goliath and we see here that it's the basics that are drilled into us that'll hold us through all the way of our life you don't think maybe you young people that what Brother Paul's teaching you in Sunday school is going to hold you listen let me tell you what brother Mark drilled into our heads in Sunday school has stayed with me all my life because it's the basic Simplicity of the gospel and the types and shadows that we learned there that help me to see things for the way they ought to be cuz God never changes God never changes you know I've run in my time to to many ministers and men that they just love to talk about the mysteries of God and they love to go into these great depths and sometimes they get so deep into the word that your head starts to spin and you start to wonder do I even believe that message what am I do I even know what they're talking about and you think you're left behind but what I realized in those situations is bring it back to the basics because the basics never change and so often what I found with those Brothers is you can ask them one question from the basics and the whole thing falls apart why because they've gone to seed on one little quote or one portion of a scripture and they neglected the entire principles of the Bible the basics that are building up the Gospel of Jesus Christ it's the basics we get in those times that set us up those little things that we think don't matter those are the things that save our life amen that's the things that we hold to it's the simple things remember brother BR would talk about that story I think it was Martin and sorry my voice is kind of bad tonight i' I've been struggling with the cough the boys had but brother brother Brandon was talking I think it was about Martin and and remember that that that Vision he had or a dream and it was Christ that came to him and he says Martin do you know me Martin do you know me and the prophet says Martin hesitated cuz something seemed off and this was a great bean and he had Mighty robes and and gold and all these things and he looked very Majestic and he had a crown on his head and he said Martin do you know me I am Christ and something caught Martin and he just he wasn't certain about what was happening and so he waited and three or four times this this Vision this person this this this thing in the vision said Martin I'm Christ don't you know me and then Martin looked at him and he says you can't be him he says because you've got a crown and the word says the Saints will crown him he says and that thing disappeared out of his way what was it he knew the word and he applied it to what we would often think would absolutely be something of God you have a supernatural experience you automatically think that's of God because I'm a Believer no there's a whole Supernatural world out there and there's Satan and there's God and there's two things in there and it was his knowledge of the basics of the word that caught that one detail cuz everything else looked right but then he said you can't be Christ because we're going to crown him we're going to crown him and that's what made the difference was that little that little scripture that little thing that he knew and it caused that Vision to disappear we see what David's doing and he's out there and he's watching the sheep and maybe not much is happening and maybe he yearns for excitement and he's wondering what the future holds and then one day a lion comes out and I don't know what happened in previous times when David faced a lion maybe he never had I'm sure he probably did cuz where there's a lion once there's usually a lion before but perhaps he's never fought that lion maybe he used to run from them but this time with the anointing on it David doesn't run from the lion he runs to the lion completely same situation completely different result and the scripture says he goes and he grabs him by the Mane now I don't know if you've ever fought a lion but you don't want to be where the man is because that means his teeth are in front of his man and the claws are there to latch on to you and rip you apart but David gets right up in his grill and he kills a lion he kills a lion and then after that what happens is a bear comes out bigger meaner stronger and David kills that bear the same way that he kills the lion why not because David's anything special but because there's an anointing in David that says you are called to protect those that are under your care that's all David's doing he's responding to the situation based on the authority that's been given to him protect the sheep protect the sheep and that anointing gives him confidence and faith that he can face whatever is in his in front of him why was David confident David was confident because he knew that he hadn't placed himself there he hadn't picked his anointing he didn't choose any of this God had placed him God had anointed him God had chosen him God had ordained him and therefore David's confident was that confidence was that God was doing a work he also knew he had to be a king and if you're if God's given you a vision of what you're going to be you can have confidence he'll take you through what you're facing even if it's a lion even if it's a bear it's a wonderful thing to know you're going in a Rapture church because nothing here can take you nothing can stop you nothing can separate separate you from the love of God David's facing what's in front of him because he's placed based on God's choosing mamas you're placed to protect your house you're anointed to protect your house and you're anointed to kick out anything that tries to come in there dad's you're anointed even above your wife to kick out anything that Satan tries to place in your family in your relationship in your home in your bodies just make sure you didn't bring it in just make sure you didn't bring it in you know it's interesting that with our youngest he he's got an interesting personality as many of us know and there's certain things that set him off and it's up to us to protect him from those things CU by his choosing he won't protect himself from it there's things he likes to do that don't help him and we've got to protect him we can't blame him for what happens if we don't protect him from it if we allow it if we're the ones that bring it into the home as the case may be amen so we are we are anointed to take care of whatever Satan tries to throw in front of us like brother Braham says you don't have to take that box of rattlesnakes you don't have to take it Satan will try and get you to sign for it you're anointed to turn it and say send back to sender we don't want that in this house listen to this brother Bram says this he says any man here that's been circumcised by the spirit of God that's been born again he says any of you people that's sick the devil's a bluff he'll rob you he'll pale your cheeks he'll do everything he can but you don't have to stand for it no longer now catch what he says here you say I'm not a preacher cuz we think it's got to be an apostle it's got to be a member of the fivefold ministry to these things out to deal with it he he says you say I'm not a preacher he says but you're a Christian you're a Christian he says shamgar didn't know how to fight nowhere in scripture does it say shamgar was a trained Warrior it says you say I don't know nothing about faith he says step out anyhow yes sir he says I was going to a football stadium one day and I saw a little thing that hanging on the wall that always struck me it's he said it's not the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight in the dog that's what does it if you're a big dog and just a coward you'll get whipped anytime I remember when I was living in Mount Pearl and we were playing hockey one time and there was this big guy that we used to play hockey with and he was just a bully and he was pushing his weight around and you know it's you're just playing on the street it's not supposed to be that physical and he was throwing his weight around and so one day I let him have it and you know what he practically cried and then he never bothered us anymore sometimes all we've got to do is turn around and say Satan that's enough and lay down the law and say No More Bullies are weak at heart and all they're hoping is that you don't realize how how truly weak they are remember he says Satan's just a bluff and he's hoping you don't realize how strong you are he says you could be a little puppy and a lot of grit and you could put the enemy running anytime now catch this he says it's the size of the god of Heaven that's in the heart it's not about you in the first place it's the size of the god of Heaven that's in the heart he says and he's a big God and a good one that covers all space and time he says sure what the church needs tonight is another getting back to God realize that it's the spirit of God in you that's going to do the work anyways amen it's the spirit of God that makes the difference in all of these situations and we see with David the spirit of God is just raising up and it's raising up and there's something in him that's coming up that's never come up before and no doubt he's sitting there saying what is this what is this I often wonder his thoughts as he's running towards that Lon in that bear as he's saying what are you doing what are you doing stop stop stop but I believe there's something that was screaming in him you're you're more than able you're more than able to do this there was a what it was the authority of God Rising ing up inside of him and saying you're anointed to deal with this situation we need to recognize our anointing finally David Gets a change of scenery and he's Out Among the sheep for a couple years and then we know he goes to Saul and he does his musical bit but then David has a change of scenery it's not by his choosing but rather his dad comes up and he says listen I need you to take some cheese down to brother Mark coffee down there and the captain of your of your brothers and go down and see how things are going 10 cheeses he had to have been a coffee brother Mark 10 cheeses for one Captain wow but his dad says just look you've been a good shepherd now be an Aaron boy go down and see how the battle's going see if you can do something down there and we know that as David comes up to the to the Army and to the camp that David or Goliath comes out and he issues his Challenge and David hears the challenge and remember David's anointing is always go forward and accept the challenge that's the that's the power of the holy spirit in a Christian is it'll say accept the challenge accept the challenge every time and God's putting him in these situations now remember we read last service where where the scripture says God said to Joshua he said be courageous and what did he have to be courageous with keep the word in your mouth keep speaking the word keep saying the word why because you're establishing your rights and you're also reminding yourselves who you are and what you really believe we're forgetful hearers we're forgetful hearers you know it was funny I was talking with my wife today we were talking about special meetings she said boy I just don't remember anything that brother said that's why we need to be reminded all the time is in the moment it's great but we got to have that continuing sustaining that continuing hearing that continuing feeding on the word of God and David comes up here and he's he's been a king over the sheep and he been a king that conquered the lion and he's a king over the bear and now David's word that he has to be courageous with is you're a king that's anointed to protect and serve and so he sees Goliath and all of a sudden what happens the king anointing is rising up inside of David he can't help it and watch what he does it says and David spoke to the men that stood by him saying what shall be done to the man that kth this Philistine and taketh away the reproach from Israel David is already saying what am I going to get when I kill this guy I love that about a son or daughter of God says what's the reward when I have the victory what's going to come out of this it says for who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the Living God and the P people answered him after this manner saying so shall it be done to the man that kth him remember they they'd be taxfree the rest of their life and he'd get to marry Saul's daughter it says and elab his oldest brother heard what he spake unto the man and eliab's anger was kindled against David and he said why camest thou down hither and with whom has thou left those few sheep in the wilderness look he's putting down David Church David's the only one that's got the courage to speak and somebody's already trying to rip the testimony out of his life the few sheep he's minimizing you weren't even much of a Shepherd it was just a few sheep and who how come you're down here and who did you leave back there to take care of those few sheep he says I Know Thy pride and the naughtiness of thine heart for thou art come down that thou might seat the battle he's saying David you're not even supposed to be here you've been disobedient to come out here you need to go back to your little job and leave this to the men what have the men been doing cowering in their tents doing absolutely nothing says and David said what have I now done is there not a cause persecution Without a Cause is the Hallmark of every Christian they'll tear you down for no good reason and really eliab's pride is probably the thing that's most hurt here he's the oldest he didn't get to be anointed king and he hasn't done anything about Goliath and now his little brother did get the anointing is coming in and saying I'll take care of that L that giant for you it says and he turned from him toward another and spake after the same manner and the people answered him again after the former Manner and when the words were heard which David spake they rehearsed them before Saul and he sent for him and David said to Saul let no man I love this church young men young sisters this is what a 15-year-old with the the Holy Ghost can do what's our excuse brothers and sisters he says let no man's heart fail him because of him thy servant will go and fight with this with this Philistine in other words don't be scared everyone I'll save you says the 15-year-old can you imagine what this looks like I don't like to pick on people but can you imagine my son Jonathan standing up and saying I've got this everyone it's going to be okay I'm going to kill the 10-footer it's ludicrous it's Madness but David steps up before the king and he says I've got this and Saul said to David Thou Art not able to go against the Philistine to fight with him for thou art but a youth and he's a man of war from his youth watch this D Saul's saying look David I appreciate the attitude I I like the can do attitude but you got to realize this guy's been fighting since he was kneehigh to Grasshopper And you barely come up to his knee he can beat you with one he can beat you with both hands tied behind his back he'd probably just kick you to death David you don't have a chance against this guy I like your faith I like your testimony but that's not going to cut it this is the real deal now but Watch God's training hasn't been lost on David David knows exactly who he is and he knows why He's there cuz there's something rising up inside of David that's saying go forward and take the challenge answer his bluff it says and David said unto Saul thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock now watch this past experiences are being applied to Future experiences he says and I went out after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me I caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him see David's got experience on his side that's the thing that Satan can't beat out of you as your experience in God when you know you've met God when you know he's real when you know he's personal Satan can't take that from you and all he can do is try and get you focused on circumstances rather than the realities of God in your life and David's got a great memory he's saying no no no you don't understand I've been in impossible circumstances before let me tell you about him amen he's got a revelation of what it means to beat something that he can't beat it says thy servant slew both The Lion and the bear and this uncircumcised shall be as one of them seeing he had defied the armies of the Living God David is the only one there that remembers that he's a living God Saul's had victories Saul's had Miracles Saul's had God doing all sorts of wonderful things and then a big giant Rises up and all of a sudden he forgets all about it and David said moreover the Lord that delivered me out of the Paw of the lion and out of this paw the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine and Saul said unto David go and the Lord be with thee David says listen when you've beaten one impossible enemy then you've beaten them all it's not about me he says the Lord the Lord that's with me is going to beat him it's not going to be me he delivered me he doesn't say I killed he doesn't say I defeated he says God delivered me God kept me safe while I was in the line of duty that's what David's walking in here amen he's saying what I know who am I whom I believed and I'm persuaded that he's able to keep that which I've committed to him against that day David knows exactly who he is Goliath is no different in David's eyes than a lion or a bear in fact Goliath is below them because those were just brw animals Goliath is uncircumcised David is circumcised David has a covenant that tells him that you can destroy anything that's uncircumcised David has a word promised for Goliath that he didn't have for The Lion and the bear David's on more sure ground with this 10-foot giant than he was with the lion and the bear he's got a word covenant that applies to him and he knows where he's standing amen but I want you to see and we're not going to read it for the sake of time but right after this what a Saul say he says here's my armor here's my sword take them out and what does David say I can't take those he says they haven't been tried they haven't been tested they haven't been proven with me David's saying your experience won't get me through this battle Saul the biggest problem we have is we're relying on somebody else's experience or we're trying to get somebody else's experience and that's their experience it's it's not yours you've got to live your life and I've got to live mine and God deals with you differently than he deals with me and he prepares you differently than he prepares me you know it's something that I've seen often and often brother brother uh Brandon was talking about this in a quote I was reading and he says you you'll see a church and God will move in that church and he'll bring a certain gift or a certain Ministry and God will bless it tremendously and you know what happens every other Church wants that gift and they want that blessing and so what do they do is they mimic it and brother Bram says when you mimic it it always fails and it brings a reproach on the gospel because it's not yours if David went out in Saul's armor he'd have died why he doesn't know how to fight in armor he doesn't need armor it's just going to get in the way armor makes you self-reliant David goes out with only what God has proven to be able to use with him and that's a Shepherd staff and a sling that's it that's what David walks out at amen no armor no sword he didn't need a sword Goliath would do just fine Goliath provided all the sword that David needed and so he heads out there and God's prepared David for this encounter just by giving him a time with the Sheep the Simplicity of the preparation of God church we can look at our lives and so often it seems like it's not a whole lot going on let me tell you there's more happening than you realize you know my wife asked me the other day she said How's your shoulder doing I said you know because why it's so slow in its growth back to normal that you can't tell day to day but what'll happen is a month from now I'll do something that I couldn't do a month before and then I'll know that I've been growing but in the meantime I don't notice it dayto day as a Believer if you're feeding on the word of God if you're spending time in the presence of God you're growing whether you realize it or not look at little Rafi how much has Rafi grown in the last 6 months he's a beast now right why just eating and sleeping if you read your Bible and you pray you're going to grow maybe just that much a day but you put a 100 days of that together and all of a sudden you grown in an inch just the little things it's simple it's not complicated but it requires that faithfulness that Simplicity of purpose to sayl I want to be with you and I want to be in your presence and I want to dwell on the right things David knew what God could do with a sling and a Shepherd staff that's all he needed he knew what he could do brother says this he says David he knew he was anointed and was Vindicated to be a good shot David's experience is supporting him as he moves into a new challenge he says he knew that they knew he was a good shot David was anointed he knew it but when he stood before Goliath he never cried oh God what must I do now I know what you did in the times past you let me kill a bear you let me kill a lion but what about this Goliath out here huh he says he never did that he just spoke and what did he say he said you will be like they are that's not Cockiness that's experience if you know you can it's not being cocky right he says you will be like they were he spoke and what did he do he went forward he never prayed a prayer he never offered nothing he knew he was anointed amen he was anointed and that slingshot had proved the right kind of a thing he had faith in his anointing church you've got to know your anointed you've got to know you've got the Holy Ghost and if you've got the Holy Ghost you've got to have faith that God has given it to you for a purpose and it comes with authority he says he had faith that God could direct that rock right straight in the middle of that helmet there where the only place could be hit he was standing there he knew he was a good shot in other words he knew he had something to contribute but that in itself would not do it notice he says he was standing there God needed somebody to stand there so he could use them somebody had to go out and face the giant that's all all God needed he says he knew he was a good shot he knew God had made him that he knew he had killed a lion he knew he had killed a bear but that was Cash oh Hallelujah he says that was with his Earthly father's possession he says here is his Heavenly father's possession that's just money that's just jobs that's just a house that's just a car but now it's Souls amen it's his children it's his precious elect bride it's the ones that he is going to come and die for it's his people if God will do that for our jobs if God will do that for our possessions Church what will he do for the souls that are in our care amen when the situation gets elevated to things that really matter that's when our confidence ought to elevate with it and say if God's with us in the little things that really don't matter he's definitely with us in the things that matter Above All Else amen he says amen he didn't get down what must I do now Lord he spoke and said you will be like The Lion and the bear and here I come he didn't wait for Goliath to start the battle he said it's I'm bringing it amen glory to God yes sir he spoke and went forward to meet this Goliath he says regardless of his size he was a little Ruddy looking fellow you know he wasn't very big now regardless of his size and his so-called ability to do so you know the Bishop told him said now look here son this man is a theologian sees a fighter he was born a fighter and he's been a fighter from his Youth and you're no match for him church people will look at you and say you can't do it I don't know why believers do this but somebody steps out in faith and they say I don't think you should do that if you got faith to do it go do it brother B says you may have I may not have faith to do it but if you have faith to do it I'm not going to stand in your way I'm not going to want to beat you down that's the sign of somebody that's got pride is they're trying to bring you down to where they are rather than let you get ahead of them amen some of the greatest miracles in the Bible came to the simplest and humblest of people that's who God uses that's who God calls it's just Little People Like Us it's not big shots big shots are not in the economy of God it's a bunch of little simple people God will say or people will say better people than you have tried this greater Christians than you have believed on this and they never got it what hope do you have that's Satan he's trying to make you look at yourself trying to make you look at yourself David was walking out there with a covenant it wasn't with an idea it wasn't just his well I'm going to be a big shot no David was walking out under a covenant he knew where he stood on the word and that's what he was walking out and the anointing in him was what bringing that word to fulfillment that's what it was doing listen to this very familiar scripture but God had chosen chosen that's specific that's intent God had chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God had chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty you know what if you say I'm a weakling here's your scripture God has chosen you to confound the wise and to confound the things that are Mighty you know what that word confound means it means disgrace to bring to shame to put to utter confusion and to frustrate now this is probably best put into sporting terms it's when you're playing a football game and the little guy that's 5 foot 8 knocks down the the 6'4 300 pounder people love an Underdog Story they love a David and Goliath and what Paul is saying here is he's saying the little guys they're built to win God chooses the little guys so that they know it's not in them to do it that it's God that's doing it and yet the victories keep coming and coming and coming Amen brother Chad the contracts keep coming the jobs keep coming the victories keep coming the healings keep coming what is it it's God saying I'm with you I'm in you press forward take heart have have faith I've chosen you to frustrate I love that because remember what demons are they're tormentors and what does it cause frustration guess what we're supposed to frustrate Satan more than he's supposed to frustrate us we're chosen of God to frustrate Satan we're chosen to frustrate demons we're Frozen chosen to frustrate sickness and these things that he throws at us chosen just little old you and me are chosen to frust the kingdom of Satan he says and his brother said oh you naughty thing come out here to do such a thing as that get on back home that didn't bother him why he knew he was anointed you've got to know your anointing he says the god that delivered me from that lion the god that delivered me from the paws of that bear he'll more than that deliver me from that Philistine here I come I meet you in the name of the Lord God of Israel amen he says he didn't pray through he was already prayed through matters how you start your day Church matters how you spend your week church he was prayed through he says God prayed him through before the foundation of the world in other words God had made a way for David God had built David up God knew what David needed and God had prepare David for David's challenge David's prayed up he was anointed for the job now catch this he had to speak and go forward that's all there was to do about it just speak and go forward that's all there was to it he says about his denominational Brothers them scoffers standing there too you know oh yes they were standing there saying and scoffing and making fun saying his brothers you know and say ah you can't you're just naughty that didn't move him a bit you want to be different from somebody else you just want to show off if that had been showing off it had been so but they only looked at the intellectual side their problems were all in them not in David none of this had anything to do with David all this showed was what was inside elb all the show was what was inside Saul he says David knew the anointing oil was on him am man didn't make any difference to him he said that Philistine will be like the bear and the lion so here I come he predicted it before it happened what did he do he killed the bear he killed the lion he knocked the lion down what with with the slingshot and took a knife and then the bear he killed the lion with a knife that's the same thing he done Goliath he knocked him down with a rock pulled his sword cut his own head off right there before it what a lion is a bear as a Goliath doesn't matter to David it's all the same thing it's got to go down he says what did he predict before it happened and you will be as they are why it says he spoke the word that it would be and then went forward to make it be fulfilled David didn't say you're going to die Goliath Maybe not today but you're going to die no David says it's going to happen right now because you've challenged the Living God because you've cursed me I've got a word to stand on and you're going to have everything you said happen to you right here today and he went forward to make it be fulfilled he says amen oh brother he spake and took over the situation that day if there was ever a time that man should speak he says it's now you know what David did David called his shot now those that know Sports know what calling your shot is and the first one we know was probably Babe Ruth remember and he takes his Bat and they don't have a picture of it they've got video of it but what does he do he points at this center field wall and he says I'm going to hit a home run and on the next pitch what did he do he hit a home run then you see Owen Nolan the skater up there and he's playing the game he's got two goals and he says I'm going to score a hattick I'm going to get three goals and as he's going in on the goalie he points with his hand to where he's going to shoot and then he puts it right there and he scores the goal then you see Mark Messier 1994 game six Conference Finals he says we're going to win tonight they're down four games or three games to two he says we're going to win tonight and then we're going to win the next game and what does he do he goes in and they win the game and then they win the Stanley Cup that's not what we're talking talking about because they were doing it to build hype they were doing it to build morale they were doing it to get people going but they had no guarantee of winning Babe Ruth had no guarantee of hitting that pitch out of the park for all he knew it was going to go in the dirt and he would have even had a chance to hit it but David Knew by experience what was going to happen David had a word promise David wasn't being cocky David was standing on the promise of the word of God on the Covenant that God had given him that's why he said it that's why he could call his shot was because he was standing on the word amen our certainty isn't in ourselves Babe Ruth was certain of his power ow and Nolan just knew that he was going to be able to beat that goalie Mark mesier just knew that they could beat that team that's not what we're talking about David's certainty was that the god that's been with me is the god that's with me today and he'll be with me tomorrow and he's going to be with me all the way until he places me in the Throne of Israel that's his certainty amen what is it it's his word quickened by his Spirit by the anointing of God in our lives brother Braham says this he says the people that laid in his shadow never said Oh Come Apostle Peter and pray the prayer of faith for us to God no no they never said that they knew he was anointed and a Vindicated Apostle of God so they said just let us lay in his shadow you don't have to say a word we know it we believe it he says it's life within them the Apostle couldn't get to them all and they themselves catch this he says they're a part of it see we focus so much on the bigs the ministers the apostles the prophets brother brandham is trying to rip this Doctrine apart because why he's going to leave the scene and if it's all about the prophet then what are we going to do after the prophet's gone if it's all about Moses then what are we going to do after Moses is dead if it's all about Christ in his physical body then what are we going to do after he leaves the Earth he's trying to get us ready for what's about to happen he says the he couldn't get to them all and they themselves they're part of it Moses said it's not just me going we're all going he says we've all got something to do we've all got to be anointed amen it's not riding on the coattails or the shoulders of some man or some Ministry amen this makes me want to shout because he's saying we've all got an anointing that's with us now listen some of us are anointed to speak but somebody's got to be anointed to be on the receiving end to hear and to act on what they hear and it's the exact same anointing working from both sides to bring the word to pass that's what God's doing as he's working on both of us Moses can't be a deliverer unless there's someone to be delivered somebody to accept the message that he's bring bringing what's the point of being a pastor if there's no sheep but what's the point of being sheep if the P if the shepherd's not effective it takes the two group groups to come together brother Bram saying we're all going to be there we all are there we're all anointed we've all got a part to play in these things amen we're all headed to Eternity we're all on the Gospel Ship to Zion I'm not getting here there without you and you're not getting there without me it's all got to be there and sometimes it's power to give and sometimes it's power to take sometimes it's power to speak and sometimes it's power to receive but all of it is what the authority of the spirit of God inside of us that's saying the word is true and it'll happen happen if we'll just hold on to it amen you know I was talking to my wife about Wednesday night service and I said you know sometimes I feel like I'm I'm preaching too simple the the depth of the message is so it's so rich but the thing is God has to meet us where we are first and foremost amen we've got to learn how to do addition and subtraction before we can go to multiplication and division before we can do algebra and calculus we're not going to kill Goliath the first day as a Christian in all probability man we've got to grow and we've got to mature and I'm not saying the church is immature but I'm saying that we've got to be able to take the Simplicity all the way up to the great mystery and everything in between it's all got a purpose to develop Us in these things amen and God will meet us where we are and he'll feed us something that'll take us right to where we need to be God knows how to do it but he says here we've all got to be anointed brother BR puts it this way God rich and mercy says this is not a Superstition it is the manifestation of a promise of God that's what David was standing on David was saying Thy word have I hid in my heart now here's the situation let the word come forth that's all he's saying let the word have its promised effect so simple but what courage did it take for David to stand there David was the only True Believer standing there that would take God at his word he says it depends on what you're looking at there's no virtue in any man there's no power in any man but we as Believers have authority not power but Authority somebody asked me long not long ago said brother brandham you believe you got power to do this I said I ain't got no power at all but I've got Authority and we all say Amen the prophet had Authority and then he says every believer has it every believer has it not just the prophet he says if you refuse it you'll stay where you're at but if you'll accept it Hallelujah it'll do the exceeding abundance because God is rich in his Mercy if you'll accept it if you'll believe it if you'll act on it if you'll hear it if you'll dwell on it if you'll feed on it if you'll saturate yourself in it it'll do the exceeding abundance you know there's nothing in the scripture that says that when David was going towards Goliath that he had this great anointing sweep over him doesn't say that David had goosebumps running up and down his arms it doesn't say that David started sweating profusely it doesn't say David had a Hallelujah moment all it says is David ran toward Goliath sometimes we're waiting for the emotion of the anointing we want to feel anointed brother Braham didn't say that the scripture didn't say that you have to know you're anointed the emotion may come it may not come sometimes by the time the emotion comes you've moveed past the point you missed the moment you've got to know your anointing when we read those quotes how many times did Brother Bram say David knew he was anointed That's What mattered it didn't say David felt anointed it said David knew he was anointed that's the Difference Maker amen we've got to know we're called and in that calling God backs us up because it's the anointing that's doing it it's the anointing that's pushing it's the anointing that's pulling it's the anointing that's pressing us forward in these things brother Joe I hope you don't mind me sharing this part of a conversation we had had he he was in a meeting and and a client brought up something that you know about these alternative Lifestyles and what they want to do a project and brother Joe was saying you know I H I forced myself to get those words out to say no we don't do that why because if we sit there and wait for courage the moment goes and we fail but we have to speak regardless and stay with the word that's why Joshua had to be courageous stay with it whether you feel it or don't feel it amen I don't always stand up here and I feel like the the anointing of God is just flowing through me he never promised that but he promised he'd be with us and he'd never forsake us and if we'd stay in the line of duty he'd back his word up every single time that's what my rest is in is that he said not that I feel not that I feel we can't wait on the emotion of the anointing or the feeling of the anointing we have to know we're anointed otherwise we'll miss the opportunity every time he says you know after we've confessed our sins and met every requirement that God requires we've believed on God there's a circumstance has to be met and it's according to his will and we've confessed our sins made all the wrongs that we've done right done everything we know how to do every requirement that God has made or asked we've met that requirement and yet he lays silent he just won't won't answer us we're talking about Authority by position he says I'm sure that I'm speaking to people who've come to that place I've been there many many times myself and when I've went back and traced my life and turned over every stone and I find that I've did something wrong I go confess it and say Lord God I'll make it right and go do so then come back again and say now Lord Thou Art God you'll answer me surely I met every request that you required me to do and every requirement I've met it and still he won't move seems to set silent he says that's when you've got to be sure that he is God don't be discouraged the only thing is in your heart to be certain of God you've got to know that you know that you know I was listening to brother Jerry Fury the other day he was talking about faith and he says you've got to have faith from the inside to the outside because you can have it in here but it's got to work its way out amen it's got to work its way from the heart through the Mind into the spirit and then it takes into the Flesh and then the whole being is subject to Faith but if you've just got it in here but it can't get past the mind it won't do you any good amen it won't have the effect because you start to doubt your own self there's got to be a way for it to come out he says but be certain first before you do anything if you want to have authority you want to know that you're where he wants you to be doing what he told you you to do that's the hardest work as a Believer find the will of God and when you have found the will of God stay stay there and don't worry he says be certain in your heart that it's God and when you've met everything he said then make sure he says then you're sure that he's God that's when Faith goes to work right there Faith stands steady for it knows that what he is your trust is in him not in yourself and you met every requirement you believe that he is and Faith holds steady Faith won't move for it's sure that God is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek him that's when real faith can kick in you're certain you know you're where you need to be he says now Satan likes to throw that at you why you're no better than you were when you were anointed you're no better than you were when those preachers prayed for you those preachers aren't right in the first place he says it doesn't matter about your that preacher it's your faith in the Living God what counts it's not what the preacher is it's what God is the preacher never made the promise God made the promise I remember brother darl Ward saying it's not my job to heal them it's my job to pray for them in faith because it ain't my promise but it's my commission the prayer of faith shall save the sick amen it's my job to have the faith to pray it it's God's job to do the healing and that's in his time and in his season he says it's not what the preacher is it's what God is the preacher never made the promise God made the promise it's not up to the preacher it's up to God and your faith to believe that that is God so be certain of God be certain that it's God and that's God's word he says and God is in his word amen let's stand together if we would David was standing on the promise of God nothing shall stand before you David saw no difference between him and Joshua why he was the son of Abraham he was in the lineage of Abraham he was under the same covenant made the same sacrifices worshiped the same God and was in the same line of duty David was standing on his word he didn't consider what other people thought nobody thought he could do it and it didn't even enter David's mind CU he had an experience that said otherwise that God was with him amen God had anointed him God had called him God had placed him in the situation and so he knew he had to be able to walk right through it David walked out with only one thing his anointing everything else was stuff that he had with him all the time he didn't do some sort of special preparation to face the battle he walked out the way he walked in God had brought to him everything that he needed to face Goliath amen he knew he had a word promise like that little children's song remember that old song He flung The Rock and God did the rest God needed somebody to stand and throw a rock that's all he needed David said I can do that and God took down a giant took Israel out of slavery why he knew he was anointed church are you filled with the Holy Ghost this evening ask yourself do I have the Holy Ghost because if you do you've got the exact same anointing that put a Goliath on his back you got the exact same anointing that took down Jericho's walls you got the same anointing that raised Christ from the dead there is no difference maybe in portion but there's no difference in that anointing that means that when the situation arises you've got an anointing to take you through it however it is over under through God's got it all and he's equipped you with an anointing to have authority to say this has to change he'll be he'll be the one that decides how it does it it's not up to us to tell God how to do it but it's up to us to stand out and say God I believe you and I'm going forward and I'm going to keep pressing forward until this thing changes amen all he's asking us to do yield to the anointing and stand on his word that's what a child of God does sons of God are led by the spirit of God and the spirit of God always leads us to stand on his word amen it's simple when we talk about it it's easy to preach it now we got to live it we got to seek after him say God what am I anointed to do what have you placed me here to do look around we shouldn't have to look very far Church certainly not for our first line of duty as husbands as wives as Fathers as mothers as as Sunday school teachers as song leaders as musicians as preachers whatever it might be but maybe there's more you young people you're called if David could be anointed at 12 what can you be anointed for if he could be a king what can you be if nothing else you can be an example of a living God amen amen let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord one thing we know is your anointing will always bring Glory To You Lord it'll lift up your name Lord It'll point to your word It'll point to a living God and Lord I believe we're here to express Hebrews 13:8 Lord that you're alive and well you're the same today as you were yesterday Lord and you'll be the same thing tomorrow and the day after and the day after and Lord you're looking for people that'll stand on your word Lord that'll be anointed Lord to live on that word to live through that word to become that word Lord in a day-by-day life Lord I pray you Quicken us this evening Lord It's a simple thought but Lord how wonderful it is if we could grasp it Lord if we could surrender our lives a new to you Lord if we could walk by faith day by day Lord that as the mountains rise as The Valleys come Lord as difficulties come our way as sicknesses thrown at us Lord as Trials come and tests Lord that we would have an anointing that say says press forward son keep going daughter there's Victory ahead Lord help us to keep our minds stayed on you Lord to see
