I'll overcome hely father Lord we've been taught that when you give us something you give us the best there is Lord and we know from the very beginning you gave us your word Lord because behind that word is every need supplied Lord every Victory is overcome every battle is overcome Lord Lord we're safe from every enemy from anything that Satan brings against us Heavenly Father Lord we overcome by your word I pray you help us to stay behind it Lord Lord even as we speak this morning on these things Lord that we would stay behind that word Lord that we would rest on it that we would have the full Assurance of it that we'd have faith in it Lord that we would rest our very lives and souls upon it day by day Lord God Lord help us to dig into it Lord help us to just have a sure Foundation that's not moved Lord by Society or by circumstance or by need Lord or by desperation Lord but that our lives would be fully settled on the foundation of your word Lord I pray you just teach us this morning Lord that you would help us to lay more more more tightly Lord to grasp more tightly to what we've received Lord our soul hangs on it Lord Our Lives hang on it the lives of those around us hangs on it Lord the fruit of Our Lives hangs on it Lord I pray you help us to lay hold of it in a special way this morning Lord grant us your grace now in Jesus Christ name we ask it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to John chapter 1 John chapter 1 greet each one it's beautiful day supposed to be sunny and warm and looking at the forecast for next week we've got a little bit of of rain perhaps Monday Tuesday and then clear sunshine and warmth for Camp so we thank the Lord for that I uh reached out to brother Aaron Oglesby uh earlier this week and he's preparing and he's excited for Camp so keep him in prayer but I did want to say that brother Paul and Sister Kim are the ones that are managing the camp and they have my full support they've discussed the camp with me the plans the preparations the way of doing things and they have my full approval so they're acting with my full Authority so what I'm asking is if they ask you to do something please do it don't say I think it should be done this way or that way or better way there is no room for opinions at Camp we've already decided so unless it's scripturally off the word we're just going to do it the way that they decide to do it and if you feel it could be done better by all means you can come chat with me after the camp but please don't approach them on changes or anything like that it's set in stone we're doing it the way we're doing it and if they want to make changes they can but it won't be us that makes those changes they got enough on their plates and they don't need us horning in and giving our opinions um like I said unless it's a word matter leave it alone come talk to me after Camp when it's all said and done okay amen I don't mean to be Stern but I want to protect brother Paul and Sister Kim from this they put in a lot of effort and uh they don't need any hassle from from any of us frankly amen so Let's uh let's keep remembering that in prayer let's keep the services in prayer I think we're going to have about 70 people is that right brother Paul 65 people coming so obviously there's a lot of people coming that don't regularly attend our services so we trust God to move in their lives amen and in our own as well it's for our benefit but we've got people from the community coming people we've been witnessing to people that have wanted to attend church for a while and so we just want the Holy Spirit to have free reign and so let's come and yes let's have a good time during the day but we're there to grow spiritually amen so let's keep that in mind and also I don't know if they mentioned no service on Wednesday of course since we'll have three this weekend so just keep that in prayer as well as we move into the weekend amen God bless you let's uh let's read in John chapter 1 and we're in a teaching service this morning and I know not everybody loves teaching but I find if we don't set a foundation for the the word then we don't know what we're praising God about we don't know what we're reacting to so this is very much a teaching service this morning in John 1:1 it says he came unto his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name he says which were born not of blood so not born of human reproductive cells nor by the will of the flesh nor by the desires of the flesh nor by the will of man nor nor by the decision of a man he says but of God so he says our birth that we have right now is not of God that's it's by the will of man but God uses us uses that to bring us to to the real birth to the New Birth by the Holy Spirit and that's the basis of the series now because John is drawing a distinction between our natural birth and our Godly birth and he says they are not one and the same thing it's not even of God in and of itself it's not his intended way amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning and we're back to the to the series that we barely started a couple of weeks ago and we're going to continue on this this series on the holy ghost that I've I've titled the token life and I want to take a second service on how the mighty have fallen and we we spoke in that first service and if you weren't there and you didn't hear it then I highly recommend you go back and listen to it again because if you don't you're not going to understand why we're saying the things we are this morning it's the foundation for this and we're going to be building up as we go through this but we spoke in the first series about or the first service about why we have to have a new birth what's the true baptism of the Holy Spirit uh which is the the new birth or the New Birth is the holy spirit which seals our soul to Eternity it's the down payment of our body change amen but the question question we were asking is why do we need a new birth in the first place what's wrong with our birth right now what's wrong with our natural birth and why is it called a new birth why isn't it called a new page why isn't it called a new chapter but yet Jesus comes along and he says to Nicodemus he says except a man be born again he said you have to be born again you need a new birth and it can't be the same as your first birth he says unless that happens he says you cannot even see the kingdom of God and you even look at his disciples and they could not see the kingdom of God until Pentecost they had to have a new birth they thought they understood it they thought they were a part of it and they were but their eyes did not come open until they got the Holy Spirit and the Word was Quicken to them and he said even of Peter now Peter who was a preacher who had signs and wonders yet after the day of Pentecost the prophet of God would say now he was a a what an inspired teacher his eyes were opened he understood who he was and where he was and of course we read where David had said that he was brought into existence and iniquity and that his mother sinned in conceiving him and yet we know that David Avid was born of a of a woman that was married to the father he was born in wedlock and they were God-fearing people and then we read where it said that we've all sinned and come short of the glory of God and that's a birth issue it's a birth issue it's not a personality issue we are not sinful by choice at Birth we are sinful by our birth itself amen we're in a fallen condition but yet so many people can't explain today why we're actually in a fallen condition we can say well Eve sinned or we can say Adam sinned but we can't say why am I sinful why does their sin translate to me why is it that I'm falling because they fell why does she get to make a choice why did Eve get to make a choice and then Adam behind her get to make a choice and I've got to abide by their choice they can't people most can't Mo mostly can't tell us why this is amen and so the question is why are we in a fall condition why is it that humanity is doomed by our births by our bodies and remember we looked at the tree of life which we saw was Christ and we talked about the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and we spent some time perhaps making someone comfortable about that term eating the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and we saw that that was a a a description for the physical act of intimacy between a man and a woman between a male and a female perhaps I should say and we saw that after they had done that act they lost access to Christ and you know I I I noticed this in my study yesterday that it's no coincidence that in the scriptures the intimacy between a man and his wife is called knowing his wife it's the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and it says a man knows his wife it literally is the act of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil that's where it comes from so we know that and I'm just doing a quick review this morning we know that the pathway to Christ was removed and so what that meant is they did not have the choice to go and spend time with God he could come to them but they were not guaranteed to be able to go to him amen they could pray they could ask he could descend down to their level by his Sovereign will and choice but now they weren't at the same play they weren't on the Level Playing Field they couldn't just say God I I want to talk to you God I want to spend time with you and automatically have that access amen they went from being amateur Gods amen remember Adam was called the Son of God and they went from being amateur Gods now to being Fallen children without the ability to fellowship with God whenever they wanted so by now we ought to know what the original sin was what the Act was for sure but I and I'll try and be delicate for the sake of the the young years amongst us but as we said last time the result of the eating of the fruit ought to tell us what the eating of the fruit was amen if it was eating an apple or an orange or a mango then it ought to be the same thing that we see today if we eat a fruit or anything that that would be along those lines amen but we know it wasn't like that and so I want to jump forward to the New Testament and we read this scripture last time where Paul gives us some insight here and then we'll go back to Genesis to confirm our suspicions on these things so Paul said to this he said would to God that you would bear with me a little in my Folly and indeed bear with me for I am jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have espoused you to one husband he says I've engaged you to marry one person he says that I may present you as a chased virgin to Christ now notice he says Chase virgin that's a woman that is Untouched by another man except the one that who will eventually be her husband amen she cannot be touched by any other man by his and we would say it today by man's ideas by men's religion by men's denomination by Logic or reason or any of these things he says but I fear lest by any means as the serpent begot wild Eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ now we know that root word for beguile is seduce so he says as the serpent seduced Eve through his subtlety through his craftiness through his shrewdness through his arguments through his logic he says I'm worried that as he did that to Eve so he would do the exact same thing to you today in your minds he did not say he' do the exact same thing he did to Eve to you but he says that he would do to your minds what he did to Eve because we see with Eve he absolutely seduced her mind but he did not stop with her mind and it's the same thing he's trying to do today he's trying to seduce our mind so that he can have control over the body and use it for his purposes and his desires rather than those of the will of God and the word of God Amen and so if we go back to Genesis 3 now we're looking at the serpent and it says now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said to the woman yay ha God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden now now if we just look at the scripture this morning you'll notice that that it says the serpent was more subtle than any other beast of the field so the serpent was not a reptile today he's a reptile he's coldblooded and and he looks completely different but but back then this was a completely different creature and he was the most cunning that word subtle means cunning it means shrewd he could talk he could reason he he had logic he could interact with Humanity he wasn't human but he was the closest thing to a human he was a mammal and and he wasn't the way he was today but I want to just stop right here real quick because what was Eve's problem what got Eve into trouble here she started talking to something that was under her Dominion none of us would go have a talk with a with a dog or with a parrot even something that can speak back to us and have a conversation with a prare it and give it any any power in our life and yet Eve sits and she's talking to something that is to have no power over her but she gives it an opportunity and she listens to it and now she gets under the influence of the serpent but I've mentioned this before but it just for the sake of completeness this morning let's look at Adam because we can't let Adam off the hook here and if we read in Genesis 2 it foreshadows the husband's role and it's reflective of Adam's failure it says Adam said now Eve the woman is brought to he says this is now bone of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called woman he did not say she' be called Eve he says she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man woman literally means out of man she's not called Eve Eve is the name she gets after she falls but after but at this point she is called woman and her name is Adam she shares the same name as her husband because they are one she is Mrs Adam he's Mr Adam we are he is Christ we are Mrs Jesus Jesus Christ we take on his name I am Christian I have no name of my own I take on his amen but she's bone of his bone flesh of his flesh she has no identity but her source which is Adam her origin is Adam and so when God's calling in the garden remember he only calls one name Adam but they both respond they both come to his call their name is Adam and that's a beautiful Revelation to us because we have the same situation with us we don't have any other name except Jesus Christ it says let everything that you do be done in the name of Jesus Christ amen my wife does everything in my name she doesn't do it in the name of Blanc and neis she does it in the name of klet she is Mrs Jonathan klette and I'm responsible for everything she does because she has my name she's a part of me amen we are him he is us that's the Revelation that's the revealing of the mystery of Christ back to perfect unity in this age but watch in verse 24 he says therefore this is a foreshadowing it's pointing past the events that are about to happen it says therefore shall a man leave his mother and his father and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh now Adam and and the woman are not husband and wife as we are today amen they are helps they are companions but there's no marriage yet in the way that we would understand it we're in a fallen marriage today compared to what they had in the beginning remember what Jesus said from the beginning it was not so what you have today is not what it was meant to be it's a fallen thing but notice what he's telling he's telling all of the husbands he's saying man cleave to your wife now that word cleave has two word two meanings and they're completely opposite but the one that's meant here is hold closely stay close to your wife why because if you let her get out on her own she's going to get into trouble I'm sorry sisters but that's what the scripture is saying here amen he didn't know he had to do that he didn't know that there was somebody trying to mess with Eve he doesn't know there was somebody there that didn't believe the word and so he just let her do her own thing and what's he trying to tell us he's trying to say men stay close to your wives don't let them go do whatever they want you need to pay attention to where they're going and what they're doing with their time what their relationships are like because if you see something you don't like you need to find out what's causing that and get to the root of it before it causes problems amen us men are supposed to be watching our wives we're supposed to be helping them we're supposed to be caring for them and then in verse 25 it says they were both naked the man and his wife and they were not ashamed nakedness had no meaning to them physical intimacy was not a part of the relationship they were perfectly pure at this point but remember it says the servant was subtle he was crafty and shrewd and so he had the sharp mind he could speak he could Converse and he was in every way like a person like a human except he had no soul a beast has no soul and that's what the serpent was he was an animal he was nearly the same as a human he was upright as we were he walked he talked he looked like us and we see that because when we see God curse him we see that God changes him from what he was then to what he is now amen and it took away his ability to interact with humanity and in Genesis 3 it says the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou Hast done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life then he says I'll put enity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seat and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his H heel so his original form was not on his belly writhing around on the dust and the dirt as we see today but that's a curse that God put on him and it changed him from being upright to being now on the ground amen God says I'll put enmity between you and the woman between your seat and her seat he says I'm going to put hostility I'm going to put a barrier there I'm going to make something that causes conflict between you two and he says and and not only that but I'm going to make it impossible for you to do what you do here now and he changes him from his original condition and abilities so if you want to know where the missing link is science is looking for the missing link between humanity and all of the beasts and it's sitting right here in the scriptures and they'll never find it because God changed the serpent in the moment like that and completely turned him into something else so they'll never find it but it's there except it doesn't have a soul but it's a beast it's the link between humanity and the rest of creation it's a creature that's practically human it can interact with with Humanity it can blame with Humanity it's a beast human if we want to put it that way and that's going to be critical as we go through this series on the Holy Ghost because we'll see today that the Beast nature is what we find most prevalent in this world a beast because a beast is a man without God that's what it is and that's what we'll see as we go through this scripture that's why Humanity keeps getting worse and worse and worse is because the Beast nature is being brought out and the god Nature has been completely eradicated at this point so we go back to Eve's conversation this this morning he takes her down a path of controversy because he says are you allowed to do whatever you want to do now Eve is a good believer she has to answer truthfully and she says the woman said to the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said ye shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it and we touched on this last time where she said you're not we're not just not allowed to eat it we're not even allowed to touch it why because with touch comes an awareness and with awareness comes emotions and feelings and with those things comes the act that will follow all of this it has a reaction if you're a healthy human she says and we can't do this lest ye die remember what death is death is separation from God when you get away from God then you die you lose eternal life amen so death is separation from God and Christ fulfills the the the definition of life because he says if you he that believeth in me shall never die and if Eve had believed the word she would never have died she'd have stayed behind it and she' have had eternal life so his word is tied to eternal life and he is tied to eternal life so death is not the fact that we go away death is when we're separated from the source of life which is Christ himself then verse four says the serpent said to the woman ye shall not surely die now this was not the first conversation church because if you tell somebody what you believe and they say that's not true you're going to walk away usually but he's brought her to the point where she will listen to him where she'll consider what he says who knows what Fellowship they've had to this point but Eve here she she missed on her discernment what should she have done we've talked about this before remember what happened to Joseph when when Piper's wife came to him and she tried to seduce him he used his feet for discernment he got out of the situation he didn't sit there and talk he didn't tell her why he couldn't he just walked away he didn't walk away he ran away he struggled to get away from her his Focus was on getting away not in staying there and convince her saving her soul no he tried to get away and he did get away and that's what Eve should have done here today use her feet for discernment get out of the situation she should have went and told Adam what he said Adam would have dealt with the serpent and then they would have never had any more issues but remember the serpent had beguiled her he had seduced her that was a a process over time and all we see now is the consequences of this is that when he cont contradicts the word completely he says something that is completely opposite to what God has said she listens you say how do we get there it's a process of time Church you listen to a little bit different than what you believe what the word says and over time you can go 180 degrees and raise your hand and say I believe that's the word of God and you are wrong wrong wrong sincerely but wrong he says you shall not surely die for God knows that in the day that you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil now he is not wrong here they're going to know it but they're not going to understand it beforehand he's not giving her the full picture he's not telling her a lie he's telling her a lie in that they shall not surely die they would die but the effect he says you're going to be just like God you're going to know what good and evil are all about it usually sounds pretty good doesn't it when Satan comes our way young people it sounds pretty good but he never tells you the effect or the end result he never tells you the fruit of if you do what he tells you to do listen people don't start doing cocaine just on a whim but something convinces them to do it and they try it and it awaken something in them and now they can't get away from it people will tell them about the the the the joys of drugs of alcohol or sensual uh Pleasures these different things people will tell you about the pleasures of stuff the whole world is trying to get us centered on getting things rather than being something and they won't tell you the effect of it the burnout and the pain and the suffering the effect on your marriage and the people around you and these different things the stresses that come with it but once you do it you get hooked on it and all of a sudden it has fruit it has a harvest that you never understood up front you sure got the pleasure but you get something on the end and they never tell you about that and so the woman saw that the tree was good for food her interest was quickened she she her curiosity was Peak she saw the potential and she saw that it was pleasant to the eyes in other words it was desirable and then it says that it was a tree to be desired and that means pleasurable so she saw that it was desirable and then she s felt that it was pleasurable and she took of the fruit thereof and did eat so she partook of the fruit without her husband there it says and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat so she part took of it with her husband second she partook of it once without her husband and once with her husband so we know what eating the fruit is we covered that last service it's physical int intimacy between a male and a female and Eve partakes of the fruit without her husband present church so who is she partaking of the fruit with there's only one other creature there and that's the serpent and he's upright he's like a man he is as a man he is in every way a man except he has no soul so her intimacy was with the serpent who seduced her that's what Paul was telling us it went from the mind to the body and that's what happens when you see people fall away from the word is he gets their mind and the body follows you know we had that believe the sign thing roll through and and those people are still living in that area and and one of the the wives of of one of the ministers was in the church getting wine for communion if I remember correctly and the man in front of her was the man that had tried to blow up this message and he had his arm full of alcohol and he knew she was behind him but he refused to acknowledge her and so she tapped him on the shoulder and she said hello brother so and so and he turned around and you know what he tried to do explain why he was holding an arm full of alcohol why his mind had been seduced and now his body was following and now he's trying to justify and he says oh it's for our guests I don't bring alcohol into my house for my guests why is he doing it because his body has followed where his mind was seduced what a shame what a shame the mind when it's lost here then everything else follows behind it amen so we look at that Serpent and we think well he's you know we look at a serpent today and we look at them and they're beautiful so many of them are beautiful and that was what he was was he was beautiful he was manly he was masculine he was muscular and even compared to a Son of God he would perhaps have been more beautiful even than Adam or more handsome than Adam was because you look at the beasts you look at beasts beasts are muscled up aren't they they they're more than a man you look at a at cattle or horses and they're just muscles on muscles you look at at the great cats and these different things it's just muscles and and they're lithe and they're Sleek he would have probably been a better-looking man than Adam was and he seduced Eve by his Beauty after he seduced her with his talk so then seeing that this was an enjoyable experience because remember she saw that it was pleasurable that it was desirable now After experiencing that with the serpent she goes to Adam and tells him about it and Adam knowing that she has been sentenced to death by her actions agrees to do the same thing with her Adam had a choice he could let her go and die or he could join himself to her and thereby go with her and keep her potentially from that sentence of death he did it out of love she did it out of subtlety she was deceived now if you want proof of that we go to 1 Timothy 2 and and Paul says this to Timothy let the women learn in silence and all subjection and everybody says not on your life hey that's where we're at in this world today isn't it not on your life it says but I suffer he says I don't allow and Paul's speaking by the Holy Spirit now this is not Paul's word this is the Holy Spirit but I suffer not I don't allow a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence for Adam was first formed then Eve so here's reason number one sisters why you can't take Spiritual Authority over a man is that Adam was created first in the image of God that's the perfect image okay but that's not the real reason that's one of the reasons and we'll see why he says but Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression so the second reason why women cannot be in leadership over men is because Adam wasn't tricked but Eve was tricked she was seduced she was beguiled but Adam went in with eyes wide open because he could not bear to be parted with her church the nature hasn't changed today what was there then is there today and so while as men are not perfect by any means what any man want to stand this morning and say I'm perfect and I have perfect leadership if you do we're going to call you to the Altar and pray for you right now because we are not perfect we are not in a position of leadership because we are perfect we are in a position of leadership because we are ordained and that is it and we have to grow into that the same as everybody else so God help us to be humble Brothers amen sometimes we need a rebuke and sometimes our wife will give it to us look at at Moses and his wife he's G running to Egypt with with the authority of God and he hasn't even circumcised his children according to the word and his wife says Thou bloody husband you've made me do this sisters sometimes we have to have a hard talk with our husbands but it needs to be with respect needs to be with respect Brothers help us to receive it in humility amen if God can use a donkey he can absolutely use my wife amen God helped me not to get to the place where he's got to use a donkey because I won't listen to my wife from time to time but remember what what first Peter says it says the woman's a weaker vessel because she came out of it she came out of the man she wasn't the full image she was a part of that image and and so as husbands and as as men our duty is to honor and help and support and encourage and lead the women in their lives spiritually now there's a natural leadership that comes with that certainly the man is the head of the household in these things but I want us to look at this because it says e the woman being deceived was in the transgression because we tend to think of this the other way we would say somebody's not guilty if they don't know that what they're doing is wrong and but then Adam did it and he went in with eyes wide open and you're saying he's not in the transgression but the woman who was tricked is in the transgression Adam knew he was doing wrong the woman thought she was doing right and you're saying she's wrong and he's right even though they both did the same thing but we have to look at sin the way God does because we look at sin as the attributes of sin but that is not what sin is to God sin to God is what disbelieving the word of God and what Eve did is she disbelieved the word and she accepted a lie and then she acted on it and she had to disbelieve that's what sin is and then what come after that is the attributes or the actions of her unbelief Adam did not disbelieve Adam accepted the consequences of his actions knowing what he was doing Adam had no disbelief he acted in love to preserve his wife he never disbelieved but Eve disbelieved that's why she's in the transgression that's why she sinned amen so to you to to disbelieve the word you have to accept the LIE of Satan and that's what she did and that leads to death and destruction it feels good at the beginning but it's fatal in the End Amen So Adam went in eyes wide open he was not deceived he was not unfaithful to God he didn't believe he didn't disbelieve the word of God he wasn't fooled he chose to go with her and he was a type of Christ why because he's in the image of God the attributes of God are in him and it's that nature to save to preserve to help to support to love in the same way that Christ would amen he's acting in the image of God by the attributes of God that are in him he's the son of God that's what the scripture says when you look at the geneal ologies So Adam didn't sin but he did he went into that position of of of that action with his eyes wide open and he just accepted the consequences knowing full well what it would mean now this is the only quote we're going to read this whole service he says now Adam was not deceived Adam knew just exactly what he was doing but Eve was deceived and Adam did not go out because he had transgressed he had not he wasn't deceived he didn't go out being because being deceived he went out because he loved his wife so well he went with her he says it's a very beautiful type of Jesus Christ knowing no sin but went to hell and took our place to redeem his wife the church that's just so you know that's not brother John that's the prophet of God Amen and we'll dig into this as we go in because this is what the Holy Ghost is given for it's a redeeming power it's a redeeming spirit it's Christ coming back to us again let's finish in second timoth 1 Timothy rather and it says notwithstanding she the woman shall be saved and childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and Holiness with sobriety so in other words Paul is saying childbearing now is a Salvation to the women it's ironic because childbearing is the act is the produ is the the fruit of the act that got them into it and now he says if you'll raise them in the fear and admonition of the Lord if you'll stay in the faith if you'll raise them in a Godly fashion with sobriety it'll save save you from yourself it'll keep you in a place where Satan won't have the access like serpent like the serpent did that's why we we generally recommend to our sisters don't go out into the workforce if you can at all help it or work in certain types of it so that you're protected from these sorts of things happening to you and brothers we always have to keep an eye on it we always have to keep an eye on it to see if there's a change because if there's a change then we've got to address it before it gets out of hand remember what the prophet said he said a woman can be fooled a thousand times quicker than a man and the thing is she'll believe she's a th% right and that's scriptural I'm not doing to put the sisters down I'm saying make yourself aware brothers that ought to make us that much more careful about what we bring into the home about what we do with our time about what we say about how we live our lives because the lives are going to magnify everything that we do and they'll reflect exactly what's been around I've said this before if you don't like the way your house is the if you don't like the way your wife is change you cuz she's a reflection of me if I don't like my wife guess what the problem is this guy right here CU she is magnifying what's going on in my life every single time God help us amen so now if we look at this eve has been intimate with two males she's been with the serpent she's been with Adam and now I know some Bible readers are going to say what about Genesis 4:1 where she says I've had a I've got a man from God but we'll address it as we go through but I want us to look at the effect of eating the fruit just as confirmation of what the eating the fruit was if it was eating fruit like we do today then it ought to have the same experience you eat a fruit today all you do is have a bowel movement maybe an upset tummy she got an upset tummy church that's for sure but it wasn't because of what she ate in that sense amen we still have access to the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil the access to Christ was what was taken away then it's back now but we've always had access to the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so that means we've been eating the fruit all along and didn't know it perhaps so if we go to Genesis 3 we read the scripture we just did when the woman saw that the tree was good for food that it was pleasant to the eyes a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also to her husband with her and he did eat now watch the effect here's Here's the the harvest here's what the action does for them says the eyes of them both were opened remember what the serpent said he says your eyes will be opened here they are they're opened and they knew that they were naked and they solded fig leaves together and made themselves aprons why do they know they're naked and why are they making aprons because when we do a crime we always try and hide the evidence of our crime don't we we become hyper aware of any evidence that would give us away we try and hide it think of it maybe none of you did this but certainly there were times where I snuck food when I was clearly told don't eat something and you know what I made made sure of every time after I snuck a cookie or piece of chocolate cake or something was that I put it back exactly the way it was and that I made sure my face was clean and my hands were clean so that Mama couldn't say did you eat a cookie did you eat a piece of cake but you know what it is as a young kid we don't know what the evidence looks like and so the parents come up and they say did you eat that chocolate cake and we say no and the parents are saying go look in the mirror and what do you see you see the evidence of your crime before you so what do we do we wash our face if we're smart we wash our face we wash our hands we get rid of all of the evidence that could give away the status of our crime amen we're trying to hide the proof of our Disobedience and so Adam and Eve eat the fruit together and the effect of that of that is that they realize they're naked as brother R said if it was an apple we need to pass around the apples because people are naked now and they're reving in it rather than ashamed of it but there's shame here why are they shamed of their nakedness because their nakedness is attached to their sin to their crime it didn't just make them realize they were naked it it made them Ed embarrassed it made them ashamed it it made them self-conscious whereas before they were they didn't even know they were naked and there was no embarrassment there they've lost their innocence with it and now they've lost the Purity with it and they make themselves a covering to hide the proof to hide the thing that was involved in the crime so what do they do they cover up themselves and their nakedness because that's where the trouble was why don't they make a mouth covering if they ate fruit shouldn't the face be covered shouldn't the lips be covered shouldn't the head be covered but no they make themselves aprons to cover their nakedness remember the effect must reflect the action the shame must reflect the crime and so what we see here is that they have a shame of the areas that were involved in the crime if I eat a cookie I'm not going to put a shirt on to cover it up but that's what your that's what people would say they ate a they ate a fruit and then they put a shirt on what does a shirt have to do with eating a fruit it doesn't do anything for you you it doesn't hide anything but their eating had something to do with their nakedness and it brought awareness that they were naked now watch the sequence that follows because you look at the questions and you look at the answers and it shows exactly what happened the scripture is perfect and if we can only read it the way it is it says and when they heard the voice of the Lord God Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the Trees of the garden and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid why because I was naked and I hid myself now for those that are listening online and I know there are this morning maybe some that have never heard this before the scriptures and and whatnot will be attached to the YouTube channel so if you just go into the the description there they're added at the end of the services or within a day so you can see all these scriptures if you want to look at them but he says Adam says I hid because I was naked and now watch the question that God answers comes back to him with and he says who told you you were naked and then he immediately says did you do what I told you not to do he says have you eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou should us not eat God links their their knowledge of their nakedness with the actions of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil immediately and this is not God being all knowing this is God knowing what happens when you do what he tells you not to do God knew that if they ever did it they would know about nakedness it would take away their purity it would it would take away their innocence and the man said the woman that thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat have you ever noticed here that Adam kind of subtly puts this on God the woman that you gave me she made me do it what a sad State of Affairs now that the Son of God has come to where he is implying that God made made a mistake that God didn't give him the perfect wife God doesn't address it God said to the woman what is this that thou Hast done and the woman said the serpent begal me and I did eat it they're just passing the buck and the Lord God said to the serpent because thou Hast done this does he say serpent did you do it he knows everything that's happened and we know everything he knows everything that's happened because he's already made a sacrifice so that he can eat even have this conversation in the first place he says to the serpent because thou Hast done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field now this is a reversal of Fortunes for the serpent because he's the Apex Beast he's the highest of the high he's the greatest of all the Beast and he says now you're cursed from that position you're the greatest and now you're going to be made the lowest and upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life now watch he says I will put enmity between thee and the woman I'll put hostility between you and her and between thy seed and her seed the little translation of seed there is Offspring so I'll put hostility between your Offspring and her Offspring he says and it her Offspring shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel now there's obviously a spiritual element here and a physical one in terms of seeds and we'll see it as we go God says there'll be hostility and hatred between your Offspring and her Offspring they can't get along they won't get along they're completely different and it's a difference that cannot be mended and then he says unto the woman so he's already now cursed the the the the serpent now he comes to the woman and he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception well what does that mean he explains it he says in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children children not child if there's one act it ought to be child but he says now it's going to be multiplied you're going to bring forth children multiple plural and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee Church what did God cursing the woman he cursed what caused her to fall he cursed the crime area he crued her he cursed her he didn't curse her mouth he cursed her reproductive system he cursed her womb he cursed her conception he cursed her desire he did not curse her hand in her mouth if she ate a fruit then he would have cursed those things but he didn't curse it he cursed what committed the sin and he says I'll greatly multiply your sorrow and conception in other words it'll be painful to bear and produce children pregnancy and birth will be a difficult process but then he says now to make matters worse I'm going to put a desire that's built into your body for this act on a regular basis and your desire will now be towards your husband you didn't have it before but now you've awakened it and every month you're going to have a desire for your husband husband whether you want it or not it's built into a woman now if she's healthy it's pleasurable he says but I'm going to take your pleasure and I'm going to turn it into pain every time or possibility of pain every time what there's a possibility of you getting pregnant on a regular basis if you engage in pleasure it's a constant reminder of the effect of sin that with it it eventually turns to pain so now she's got a monthly time where she can conceive it's built into her the beasts don't have this beasts don't have this beasts have like a six-month cycle from the spring to the fall where they can get pregnant and then it shuts off through the winter but a woman can conceive at any time all the way through the year it doesn't change with the with the seasons and these different things why cuz sin awakened it and God says now that you've awakened it you're going to deal with it and it's with you all the way you're never going to get away from it it'll have control over you your hormones will have control over you you might hate your husband one day and the next day you'll just you'll just want to be with them it'll have total control over you and he says you'll need an outlet for that but you're not just going to be able to do that with anyone he says it's got to be with your husband now and God puts a box around it he says it's out of my will it's not the way I meant for it to be but because it's there now there's only going to be one person you can do that with and that's your husband we see what Paul said in Hebrews 13 He says the marriage marriage is Honorable in all and the bed undefiled God allowed this God made it honorable God put a box around physical intimacy and he says it's only for marriage he says but wh mongers and adulterers God will judge you do it outside of it you're under under the risk of the Wrath of the Judgment of God but notice there he says he says not only will your desire be to him but he says he shall rule over thee we have a problem today with women trying to take control where God told them not to why because she's trying to get out of her place That's what Satan does is he tries to get us out of our place men we are not where we are because we are better we are are there because God said that we are the ones to do it so women cannot take authority but it can be granted to them but here's the thing a man cannot Grant a woman Authority where the scripture says only he can do it church I can't give authority to my wife just because she's better at it than I am if the scripture says it's mine to do that means I've got to grow I've got to mature I've got to I've got to increase in my relationship I've got to let the attributes of God grow inside of me to make me capable of doing that I can't just abdicate it to her because she naturally has it some women are very good leaders I work with some I've met plenty that are wonderful leaders but you're not a leader because you're good at it you're a leader because God ordained you to it and that's why we separate it that's why we separate it and inevitably what we have found is that they get LED astray by the very thing that Eve did and that's usually the shortcoming if you're dealing with somebody like that amen men lead women are in a support role in terms of spiritual matters and the household but notice here she was co-equal with Adam in this original role she was co-equal she was a part of him there was no difference between them I think that's the point is today we're looking for equality but there's this vast separation and they're trying to create these separations but they were one and the same they were co-equal there was no difference between Adam and the woman they were just one they were one body they they were from the same thing but after she s God says sorry he's in charge now and you'll answer to him and he's never changed it back and it only comes back under that when we go into eternity because we're restored back to our Eden Condition it's a type of us in the Christ and Christ he leads we follow I don't tell Christ what to do he tells me what to do and I do it and you look in the Scriptures it says husbands love your wives how as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it that he might present it to himself as a glorious bride without spot a wrinkle we're doing it for their benefit not for ours it's a sacrificial role Christ types the husband we type the bride of Christ the wife so he curses the woman and he curses what she did she curses the area that was the problem that that committed the sin and then he comes to Adam he says unto Adam he said because thou hearkened under the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat eat of it all the days of thy life Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat of the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return under the ground for out of it was thou taken for dust Thou Art and unto dust Thou shalt return so what is God cursing Adam his Dominion amen he doesn't have power over it now he was an amateur God he had power of the spoken word he was a Son of God but now he has to do it by sheer physical effort and he's got to sweat and he's got a labor he's got a toil and he will always battle his environment to survive in it God won't provide for him as he did before now the man has to provide for himself and it'll cause his body to slowly fail and die and eventually turn back to dust now watch in verse 20 and Adam called his wife's name Eve she had no name now she's got a name in her Fallen condition she gets a name why because she was the mother of all living it never says anywhere in the scripture that Adam was the father of all living but it says Eve was the mother of all living amen if you look at your genealogies Adam is listed as the father only for Abel and Seth Cain is not found in any genealogy in the scriptures well he's got a genealogy and we'll get to it and we'll see who his father was but Cain is never listed and we can't go back and say well well nobody wanted to have Cain in their family tree so they left them out you go through they list you whether you're in your you're good or bad they put you in the family tree they were were so precise with their genealogies the Jews and the and the children of God they could trace themselves all the way back to the beginning and yet Cain is not there why because he ain't a part of the genealogy there's something else that's different about him so God comes out now sorry it says he called his name wife's name Eve because she was the mother of all living and then he says unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skins and clothed them now I want to touch on that last verse a little bit because we see that God replaced their covering with his covering they were looking to cover up their nakedness they were looking to cover up the effects of their sin but it was not acceptable to God and for them to even come into His presence God had prepared a covering to hold back judgment in that moment and what was it it was the skins of an animal now the scripture doesn't tell us what it was but we know or we believe if we look into the future that that would have been a lamb that was the sacrifice it was the Lamb of God there was a lamb slain before the found foundation of the world it was always a lamb so you can't make a coat of skin without killing some animal amen and so God comes down and God doesn't now pull out a sewing machine he doesn't have the latest singer there and sit down and make a beautiful coat out of sheep skin and wool God kills an animal and he takes the bloody skin and he wraps them in it why because they've got to see sacrifice is not clean death is not clean right they had to realize what death meant right then and there and they look and with horror they would see that came from little fluffy lamb that used to love walking around with us and and fluffy the lamb is dead for me and they had to see the effect of their sin right then and there cuz remember there had to be a death there had to be a death and God said I'll take an innocent substitute for now and so what did he do he came down and it was a type of Christ the perfect sacrifice that would take their place later God's word had to be fulfilled death had to happen and so they there was a death that happened that day but remember they that day if we look in the scriptures a day is as a thousand years with God and so that day they started to die and they all died within a thousand years nobody lived past A Thousand Years Methuselah I think was 969 years nobody lived a day in God's eyes after that they were separated from him they they lost access to eternal life and that's why the Millennium so important is because it proves we're back in our in our original condition that we live a thousand years that we live a day again but it not just because they had to see what death meant but it had to be blood the covering we look at we think it was it was it was the skin the covering was not the skin the blood was the cover or sorry the the the the covering was not the skin itself the covering that mattered was the blood the blood was proof that a life had been lost but the blood covered the evidence of Eve's sin now the adults that are among us we we know that there's blood there's always blood when a woman loses her virginity and so when Eve's walking back she has blood on her body and the only thing that will hide blood is blood and so what happens is now she's coated in a bloody skin and Adam's coated in a bloody skin and what does it do the blood of the innocent sacrifice mingles with the blood of the proof of their sin and it covers it it does not erase it it covers it it's an imperfect covering but it covers it nonetheless and so nobody could look at Eve and say Eve there's the proof because everything's Blended in together now she's soaked in blood blood is falling down that's why it had to be blood to prove that a life was lost and to cover the proof of her sin in the first place to effectively cover it the leaves weren't covering the proof they were just helping them feel better and that's what the world's trying to do today isn't it it's trying to make you feel better in your sins rather than getting you under the blood of Christ and actually doing something about it so now what happens the effect of God's provided way is that it hides the proof of their sin it mingles with it it absorbs it the fruit of their actions is that they're aware of their nakedness and sexuality and the consequences is that they now lose access to the presence of God and they can't come to God anytime they want they could call they could request they could pray they could get desperate but it would be up to God to respond to those things now as we start to close let's look at the effect of all this let's look what it at What It produced because as we said before I it's not just going to produce an awareness but it produces an offspring God said there's going to be an offspring comes out of this it's going to be children there's always a harvest from our actions there's always an end result that comes out of it it's not just sin but there's a harvest remember what the scripture says uh be not deceived God's not mocked whatever a man SWS he'll also reap there's always a harvest that comes out of our choices so we look back again in Genesis 3 he says I'll put enmity enmity hostility between thee and the woman and between your seed and her seed between your Offspring and her Offspring will bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heal and then he said to the woman I'll greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception I want to put that together I will greatly multiply thy conception in sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children multiple and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee so we know that there's a spiritual element here it's a prophecy of Christ bruising Satan at Calvary crushing him when he died and he rose again and yet we know that Satan bruised Christ in his flesh and that there was a death that occurred but it wasn't fatal it was temporary and Christ rose again but when we look at what happened to Satan it's a fatal bruising it's a crushing of him because there at the cross when he rose again Christ conquered death hell and the grave and that's all the power that that Satan has over us amen but we notice here that there's got to be a physical element as well because he says the woman's Offspring and the Serpent's Offspring let me put it this way the woman's seed and the Serpent's Seed they would be at enmity they would be at war they'd be in Conflict they'd be in opposition and one of them will be of The Serpent and one of them will be the woman and God says I'm going to multiply your conception you're going to have more than one baby here so the serpent needs to have an offspring he needs to have a seed and the woman needs to have an offspring or a seed now put these things together and watch what happens and we read this before it says Adam knew his and Adam knew remember what we said the tree of knowledge knowing this is the act of knowledge Adam knew his wife single event single act and she conceived and bore Cain this is Genesis 4:1 now so this is everything's done they're out of the Garden of Eden it says Adam knew his wife and then she conceived and bear Cain and said I have gotten a man from the Lord but remember the scripture says she ate the fruit without her husband there and then she ate the fruit with her husband there so she ate the fruit with the serpent then she came to her husband and ate the fruit here is the record of Adam eating the fruit made very clear with his husband and then it says and she again bear his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground Abel was a Shepherd but but Cain was a farmer but we look at at that second verse it says she again Bears brother Abel it doesn't say that Adam knew his wife it just says that she produced Abel Now watch how this goes let's go to verse one first it says Eve says I have gotten a man from the Lord and almost everyone in denomination says see that was a child from Adam but let me say this first thing just CU I say it don't mean it's right she's fooled already I don't trust what comes out of his mouth if you'll give me that Grace this morning but just cuz she says it doesn't mean she's right now she's right in a way life only comes from God so this can happen by his permission you look in the scriptures remember the scripture says God closed up the womb of this one God closed up the look at Hannah Hannah is a faithful believer and God closes up her womb for purpose and it's to get her to a place where she'll say the right thing and do the right thing and then God opens it up Samuel's born she gives him back to God and then she goes and she has a bunch more children why God opens and closes God chooses God allows who has children who doesn't there are people that will do this act for their entire life and never have a baby and you say why God allows it or God doesn't allow it it's up to God Amen God would refuse to allow it or whatever so life is of god remember Satan cannot produce life he can corrupt he can destroy he can twist but he cannot produce life he is not a Creator he's a destroyer amen so life is of God but that doesn't mean the child is Godly that doesn't mean the child is good every child is born by God's permission and allowance not necessarily by his will but by his permission remember we read that first scripture in John where it says that we are not born of the will of man or by the blood but we are born of the will of God so everything that happens naturally he allows it but that is not the birth he's looking for so Eve saying this doesn't make it true in the sense that that that Cain was a child of or from God in fact we'll see what Jesus says Jesus flat contradicts and corrects Eve on this if we want to put it that way but this one doesn't add up if you go back to the original Hebrew language so here's here's where we dig into the scriptures a little bit now I hope I don't bore you I'll I'll take two minutes to do this because in the in in in Hebrews in the Hebrew in the original Hebrew you've got to look at the verb tenses here because it says Adam knew his wife and she conceived the two verbs are new and conceived and in Hebrews so we have a we have three we have past present and future so we could say Adam knew Adam was knowing and Adam will know but in the scripture or in Hebrew you only have he Adam knew and that's a a perfect tense or an imperfect so a perfect tense means it's a completed act and an imperfect t means it's an ongoing act so it says here that Adam knew Eve his wife and she conceived we read that in English and we read that as one and the same act but when you go into the Hebrew here then then it says that where it says Adam had known his wife it says it's in the perfect tense meaning it's a completed act but when it says she conceived Cain it's in the imperfect so it means that one is a finished act and one is an ongoing act so if you were to put that into English it would say that Adam had known his wife past tense and she was conceiving and bearing a son ongoing so he knew his wife he had physical intimacy with his wife that's one act but the the the the conception of Cain is an ongoing process that is outside of what Adam did with his wife so now and to show you why this matters if we go and look down into the next couple of verses so the first one is Genesis 4:1 Adam knew his wife and she conceived and be Cain and those are different events the verb tenses are completely different one is a completed act one is something that's going on because remember a child is forming in her okay it's forming it's not done it's forming right when a woman's impregnated there's a thing that goes on and it's got to embed itself in the wall in these different things so so Cain is being formed but that is not Adam's act with his wife so if we look at the next couple of scriptures now that say the exact same thing it says and Cain knew his wife and she conceived and bear Enoch the tenses of those verbs are exactly the same thing the the the relationship with his wife and the conception of Enoch are one and the same event and then we go and and Adam does the same thing with his wife again and it says and Adam knew his wife and she bear a son and called his name Seth for God she said ha appointed me another seed instead of Abel whom Cain slew Cain is not listed as a seed of God Seth is another seed from God to replace Abel who was a seed of God Cain isn't her seed he's a serpent seed but in this act again Adam knew his wife and she bear a son she conceived it's one and the same act in the same tenses it's tied together but yet in Genesis 4 one it is two separate tenses why is that in English it looks exactly the same in Hebrew it is completely different why because the acts in 17 and 25 are not the same as the acts in in Genesis 1 I thank brother Jason dears for this he's the one that gave me this when I reached out to him a while ago so he did all the heavy lifting on this I'm just using his work this morning but if you go back to the original scripture it shows that what happened in Genesis 1 is not the way that Cain did it and it's not the same thing that Adam did later to produce Seth it's completely different it's a separation of events so it looks like knowing and conceiving are the same thing but it's not the exact same thing here so then Eve has another child Abel she doesn't say he's from the Lord doesn't say Adam knew her well we'd say today well D John she had a twin she had a relationship with Adam and It produced twins but look at the nature of those two boys and you see something Abel's a shepherd and can's a farmer that doesn't make them different in of itself nothing wrong or right about that but if we look at their Natures how they act towards God we see something that is completely different so it says in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought the fruit of the ground an offering to the Lord Cain bought everything he had done he brought fruits and vegetables maybe flowers beautiful things this is a gorgeous offering it would have been amazing absolutely beautiful he brought the best of the best that he had it says and Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and the fat thereof you can't get the fat unless you kill amen so Abel comes and he takes a lamb and he kills it and he spreads it before God on the altar it says and the Lord have respect unto Abel and his offering so that was the best that he had but he did not leave it whole but he took his life he took the life of the lamb and he put it there and the scripture says God had respect unto it now what does that mean it means that God consumed it with fire like he did on Mount carel with Elijah God showed it was acceptable by consuming it it was a supernatural act that happened there so let's jump to the New Testament quickly because we see an explanation for this we see Cain does one thing and we see Abel does another and we say why did they do different things well Hebrews 11 says by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain didn't say Cain's wasn't good he said it was more excellent God requires it in a certain way he says by faith he did it and by which he obtained witnessed that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh now we know faith is a revelation of God faith is given to us from God when he shows something when God shows us something and it's really from him he gives us Faith behind it to act on it that's how you know you have a real Revelation is it'll cause you to act on it it'll cause you to stand on it it'll cause you to rest on it so Abel has a divine revelation of why he needed a sacrifice and why the sacrifice needed to be blood now here's the thing Abel's uh Revelation does not cause him to be under conviction it causes him to be acceptable he's a Son of God but it brings conviction to Cain and it highlights who Cain is in comparison to Abel now don't don't don't get me wrong Abel is not perfect but he's a Son of God and we'll see this we're not going to get into this service we see a line that is called the sons of God and we'll see a line that is called the sons of man and the sons of God have a purity in their line and the sons of God have can in their line what's the difference who the daddy is but but but Abel does this by divine revelation but watch Cain because if Cain is just the son of Adam and and Eve the way that Abel is then he doesn't need to be perfect but his response ought to be the right way God doesn't require us to be perfect up front but when he shows us something he expects us to abide by it and we see this isn't the case at all with Cain because it says but unto Cain and his offering he had not respect God didn't accept it God said it was excellent but God didn't accept it and Cain was very wroth he was very angry and his countenance fell his face got angry so Cain doesn't acknowledge it at all and Cain got mad and I don't blame Cain for that Cain gave God the best that he had and God said I don't want it church that ought to tell us something there's a way to approach God and it's his way not my way I can give him my best and that's not what he's looking for he's asking to come his provided Way by Revelation by faith the you can preach on some of these things for for for a month or or or a year and not get to the bottom of it I'm just doing broad strokes this morning for this for the sake of time and God said to Cain Cain why are you angry why are you wroth and why is your countenance Fallen Cain what's wrong with you he says if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted in other words he's saying Cain if you sacrifice the way Abel will I'll accept and acknowledge you and your sacrifice as well he says and if thou doest not well sin lith at the door God saying to Cain I don't hold it against you that you didn't do it right the first time but now that you see the way to approach me you've got a choice and you can obey it or you cannot obey it and he says and if you don't do it sin lies at the door in other word unbelief is cropping up it's coming up out of your life and you're going to fite that he says not only that unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him in other words sin will be chasing you constantly and you're going to be battling sin the rest of your life because you won't accept what I'm telling you to do right here he didn't say Cain I've turned you down because you're wrong he says Cain I'll turn you down if you don't do what you know to do is right God does God leaves us without excuse church he shows us what he wants and then he says will you do it or will you not and this is the deciding factor of who is and is not a child of God not signs and wonders not speaking in tongues not Church attendance it's will you do what God shows you by his word when he shows you he doesn't hold you responsible if he never shows you but as soon as he shows you now you're responsible for what he's given you you know what Cain says I am what I am I'll do what I want take it or leave it and you're telling me that's a the child of a son and daughter of God can't be look at verse eight it proves it and Cain talked with Abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him killed him they were fellowshipping then he killed him two completely different Natures supposedly from the same parents how does that work now you might look at Jacob and Esau and say well brother John we can see that all through the scriptures but they are not in the condition of Jacob and Esau this is before the mixing of the bloodlines if they are both of Adam and Eve the way Abel definitely is then they ought to have the same Natures but they don't they should be identical in that sense but they're not so we see what two Offspring at emnity two offspring that are in hostility with each other it's one-sided Abel's not persecuting Cain but Cain's persecuting Abel why because God said that's how it was going to be there's going to be two seeds there's going to be two offsprings there's going to be two Bloodlines and there'll be a battle between the two and in the end Cain murders able the evil one murders the righteous one so how can they be from the same parents if they're if they're two completely different Natures Adam and Abel have the same nature but Cain does not what's wrong with Cain why is he why is he different and not in a good way Cain is angry Cain's murderous Cain feels God is unfair and unjust we don't see any of these things from from from Abel but Cain you notice was religious he was Pious he was interested in being right before God and yet as soon as the opportunity is given and the opportunity contradicts himself and what he believes what does he do he says I'm not interested and he rejects God he wanted to meet with God on his terms not God's what was he he was religious that's all just religious religion won't save us church we got to come his chosen way if we jump to the New Testament John 8 now Jesus is talking to the religious leaders now religious cuz what we're going to see here is two Spirits interwoven remember within the framework of the church and this is the origin of it not worldly religious religious so Jesus is talking now to the to the priests he says I know that ye are Abraham's seed he's Naturally Speaking they were the children of Abraham by their bloodlines he says but you seek to kill me because my word had no place in you just like Cain I speak that which I have seen with my father and ye do that which ye have seen with your father he says I'm doing I'm doing what my father shows me and you are as well Jesus is saying your father ain't my father we come from a different bloodline we come from a different family and they answered and said unto him Abraham is Our Father and Jesus said unto him if you were Abraham's SE children ye would do the works of Abraham but now you seek to kill me a man that had told you the truth what did Abel do to Cain he showed him the truth by his works by his Sacrifice by his acceptance he said which I have heard of God Abel got this from God it's a revelation Jesus is saying just like Cain and Abel you're seeking to kill me because I tell you what you don't want to hear because it identifies who you are he says this did not Abraham Abraham didn't do that he said somebody else do it then he says ye do the Deeds of your father and they said to him we be not born of fornication they said we weren't born out of wedlock he just said your father's not like my father and they said we're not born of fornication what does that have to do with anything absolutely nothing the rest of the world would say absolutely nothing but Jesus said you're of a different father than I they're saying hey don't put that on us because they know exactly what he's talking about why because the father of murder is Cain and Cain is born of fornication they knew exactly what he was talking about and Jesus said unto them if God were your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me anden if Cain was as Abel was he'd have loved and obeyed God's word because they'd have the same nature their father and Jesus is showing now these two Natures these two spirits that work in the church one is of God and one is not but yet they can both look religious they can both look Pious they can both look Christian but they're not both go to church both say they believe the message but only one has the true evidence and that's that they'll let it live in them he says why do you not understand my speech why don't you understand my words he says even because you cannot hear it you can't understand it ye are of your father who the devil he says and the lusts of your father you will do catch us now their father's the devil and he's a lustful person who is the original lustful person it's the serpent Satan indwelt the serpent he says he was a murderer from the beginning who's the original murderer Cain Cain was a murderer he was the first one and he Abode not in the truth in other words he knew the truth but he couldn't live in the truth he couldn't live by the truth he says why because there is no truth in him what could why couldn't Cain accept it an Abel could because there was no truth in him he wasn't of God the way that Eve said he was he wasn't born of the Son of God Adam he says when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he's a liar and he's the father of it who's the original liar it's the serpent it's Satan and the serpent he told a lie and Cain is just like him Cain is a liar CU remember God comes down to Cain after he kills Abel he says where's your brother he says I don't know I'm not I don't I don't watch after my brother he's a liar he's a liar and then he comes he says because I tell you the truth you believe me not and which of you convinces me of sin and if I say the truth why do you not believe me he that is of God heareth God's words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of God here's the test of a child of God will you accept the full word of God not just the stuff you want not just the stuff you like you'll accept the stuff that cut you to your core that's it's got to be that way church it's got to be that way if we're going to be accepted we've got to accept his provided way and that's to be wrapped completely in his Robes of righteousness in his word to do righteousness is to do the will of God Amen so we look at Cain and Abel we see two Natures Abel's faithful true to God's word obedient and gentle and Cain is a liar a murderer he's angry he's unable to accept God's word thinks that God's unfair why two different fathers one was born of a lustful liar the serpent under the influence of Satan and the other was born of the Son of God Adam now what is this what is this you say brother John you're you're talking in riddles now so you're saying two fathers one mother how does that happen well it's called heteropaternal superation okay write that one down okay and this is when a woman conceives from two different males within a short period of time it's two separate eggs it is not an egg that divides it's two separate eggs brought to life by two partners to produce children that are completely different and it happens within a short period of time within 5 days okay this is medically proven the first case was reported by Dr John Archer he's the first doctor to receive a medic medical degree in the United States in 1810 and according to him there was a white woman that had two partners and she didn't tell anyone and when they were born one was black and one was white Eve had two that were born one was black and one was white now I'm not talking the color of their skin I'm talking about the condition of their soul one was a child of God one was not but I looked this up because I wanted to see you know how often this happens and it is very rare but the last one I found was a lady Nam named Mia Washington and Dallas Texas and she had an affair while she was married and she had two boys on May 8th 2009 and they looked nothing alike so they did a DNA test and they found that one was by her husband and then she finally had to admit that she'd had an affair with another man they were twins by birth but they not were not twins by the same fathers two completely different fathers and two children coming out of the same mother so the mother's DNA is in both but it's the father's DNA that's different between two of them let's take it back to what Jesus said as we wrap up this morning we're not too bad amen I'll take God's word over I'll take Jesus word over Eevees if that's okay with you this morning he says whoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he's born of God I am not going to unpack that scripture that's a series in itself we'll do it later by God's grace but he says he says he does not commit sin he does not disbelieve he's not saying you don't do bad things he's saying no matter what Hallelujah you keep coming back to the word of God even when this flesh is screaming it's wrong it's wrong I can't do it I can't do it we come up to that word and we say Lord according to your word be it unto me and we humble ourselves to it and we confess it and we repent and we press on that's what he means here he does not see say you are sinless in that you do not have the attributes of sin he saying you cannot disbelieve because there's something in you to disbelieve will be du to deny exactly who and what you are that's what it means okay we can dig into that a lot later maybe but he says in this the children of God are manifest he says in other words this is how you know who's a child of God and the children of the devil okay here's the litmus test whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God what is righteousness to do the will of God which is the word of God that's simple that's simple okay there's no other definition to do righteousness is to do the will of God he says so the so whoever doeth not righteousness whoever doesn't do the will of God who doesn't obey the word of God neither he that loveth not his brother who's the who this is like the the definition of Cain right he wouldn't do the will of God when God showed him clearly what should be done and then he didn't love his brother he killed his brother he hated his brother he says for this is the message that she heard from the beginning that we should love one another and now he brings it down and he clenches it not as Cain who was of God Eve said he was of God Jesus said the word says not as Cain who was of that Wicked one and slew his brother and wherefore slew he him why did he do it he says because his own Works were evil and his brothers righteous Jesus says Cain and Abel are proof of what I'm telling you Abel did what was right because he was born of God Cain did what was wrong because he was born of the wicked one are you telling me Adam was the Wicked one scripture never calls him that scripture calls him the Son of God Cain was born of somebody else and this is not a spiritual birth this is a natural birth there was nothing in him to respond to that word there was nothing to do it amen Eve said Cain was from the Lord Jesus said he was of that Wicked one Jesus tells us exactly what is meant in that scripture and what is right to it so what's the original sin Church fornication intimacy between a man and a woman that were not man and wife she was intimate even was intimate with the servant serpent before she was ever with Adam and what's the proof children of two different Natures one with the nature of God one with a nature contrary to the word of God but there's more to it and we'll get into that in the next service Lord willing we'll see there's two separate Bloodlines we'll see there's two spirits that are now interwoven through the church it's all in our Bible I use no quotes to prove this this is all scripture Jesus taught it Paul taught it the Sadducees and Pharisees knew it Moses taught it from the beginning it was there and it gives us an understanding now as to why we're Fallen but now they were all children of God and now you got Cain's line you say well I'm a Child of God but not by your physicality you're not that's been lost so long ago and we'll get into that Lord willing in the next service amen God bless you you can stand this morning you hope to only have to do that maybe once every 20 years but I trust you understand for the sake of our young people to understand this because you're going to be talking with people at some point and they're not going to be able to tell you what this what really happened here and you need to you need to be able to tell them or point them to something like this and say this is what we believe by the scriptures and we'll go into it and as we see as as we go through this we'll see the evidence that of that and we can go through it as we pass on in the in the series amen but we'll follow these two Natures these two streams down through history down through church starting with the next service Lord willing so again we've got no service on Wednesday so just be in prayer for the meetings if you have any if you need any help if you're missing something if if you need some support to get to Camp or whatever please let um brother Paul and Sister Kim know can also reach out to
