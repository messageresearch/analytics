[43:52] virgin espoused to a man whose name was
[43:54] joseph of the house of david and the
[43:56] virgin's name was mary
[43:58] and the angel came in unto her and said
[44:00] hail thou that are highly favored the
[44:03] lord is with thee blessed art thou
[44:06] among women amen you can take your seats
[44:08] this morning may god add his blessing to
[44:10] the reading of the word
[44:12] amen this is perhaps a little bit of a
[44:13] different christmas and new year's
[44:15] message but the wonderful thing about
[44:17] when we read about the birth of jesus is
[44:18] there are so many things going on that
[44:20] you can applied in so many different
[44:21] ways
[44:22] and so before we opened our gifts at
[44:25] christmas i was reading this this
[44:26] portion of scripture and just uh
[44:28] something jumped out of me and and said
[44:30] you need to preach on that so we'll get
[44:32] to that scripture a little bit later but
[44:34] and then when you when you feel that
[44:35] unction you want to be able to move i
[44:36] mean you don't want to just stay where
[44:38] you are and where what's comfortable but
[44:40] just take that and go so
[44:41] i like i said it's it's been a bit of a
[44:43] tougher tougher run of series you know
[44:45] it's really challenging to us it's
[44:46] getting down to where rubber meets the
[44:48] road so this morning trusting that the
[44:50] lord will encourage us this morning and
[44:51] i want to take a title this morning of
[44:53] our belief his performance amen our
[44:56] belief his performance now we start with
[44:59] this beautiful event that happens here
[45:00] and it's a story well known to us and we
[45:03] see here mary just a young woman and
[45:04] they don't actually know mary's age but
[45:06] they estimate anywhere between 14 and 16
[45:08] years old barely a woman if we could put
[45:10] it that way and she's walking through
[45:12] life and she's young and she's clean and
[45:14] she's beautiful and she's undefiled
[45:16] she's a real believer she's she's living
[45:19] her life according to what she's been
[45:21] taught you know
[45:23] and like many others at the world at
[45:24] that time you know mary doesn't jump out
[45:26] in any way perhaps from those that were
[45:28] around her if she were to walk through
[45:30] the synagogue nobody would say that mary
[45:32] was any greater or maybe even any lesser
[45:34] than anyone else she was just a regular
[45:36] person but yet we see here in luke
[45:38] chapter one and let's stay here this
[45:39] morning keep your bibles there because
[45:41] we'll spend our entire service there but
[45:42] in luke chapter one we have something
[45:44] happens and that's that in the sixth
[45:46] month the angel gabriel was sent from
[45:48] god into a city of galilee named
[45:50] nazareth now i want to start here
[45:52] because when god sends an angel the
[45:53] prophet of god says something's about to
[45:55] happen amen and he says very clearly in
[45:57] the message believe us thou this he says
[45:59] notice now when anything's going to
[46:01] happen on the earth first god sends a
[46:03] messenger and that messenger is anointed
[46:06] by an angel now in this sermon right
[46:08] here at the start he's actually talking
[46:09] about the birth of john the baptist and
[46:12] an angel comes to a man and that man
[46:14] takes the message amen so he says
[46:16] there's always a messenger but then
[46:18] there's an angel to that messenger amen
[46:20] we see that in the life of brother
[46:21] branham where he had the angel of the
[46:22] lord there you remember and he would
[46:24] come to him and then he would bring it
[46:26] to us he says and that messenger is
[46:28] anointed by an angel now sometimes minor
[46:30] angels come there's minor angels and
[46:32] major angels now this angel that came
[46:35] was gabriel who stands in the presence
[46:37] of god
[46:38] that was something major
[46:41] and he came down and when gabriel comes
[46:43] from heaven remember something's going
[46:46] to happen so this is a major event
[46:48] that's happening in mary's life we read
[46:50] that to say this mary is about to step
[46:52] into a major event because gabriel
[46:54] doesn't come down to just tell people
[46:56] things amen he's not just the casual
[46:58] messenger that god sends a thousand
[47:00] times a day to believers perhaps around
[47:02] the world but this is the angel this is
[47:04] the right hand man of almighty god he
[47:06] comes directly from the throne of god
[47:08] and says i have a message for you mary
[47:11] and then there's a special time that's
[47:13] about to happen and you need to know
[47:14] about it and verse 27 says he came who
[47:17] to a virgin espoused that means engaged
[47:20] to a man whose name was joseph of the
[47:22] house of david and the virgin's name was
[47:25] mary now i want to point something out
[47:27] here because joseph isn't where he's
[47:29] supposed to be for this prophecy if you
[47:31] notice he is of the city of david he is
[47:33] from the city of bethlehem but he's not
[47:35] there yet but yet the prophecy is about
[47:37] to come into position amen there's
[47:39] something about to happen even though
[47:41] joseph is not where he has to be just
[47:43] yet amen mary is not of the line of
[47:45] david mary is not told that she is of
[47:47] the line of david but she is of somebody
[47:49] else as far as we know i haven't checked
[47:51] that i might be wrong but as far as i
[47:53] know mary was not of the line of david
[47:54] necessarily the way joseph was but yet
[47:57] she's brought in by marriage she's
[47:58] brought in by engagement no matter what
[48:00] her background is she's tied to the man
[48:02] and so she's tied to the prophecy that
[48:03] she's going to be of the lineage in the
[48:05] household of david when she brings forth
[48:07] this messiah because the messiah has to
[48:09] come from the house of david in terms of
[48:11] the natural lineage amen so everything
[48:13] is set in place here for what the
[48:15] prophecy to be fulfilled and if prophecy
[48:18] is going to come fulfilled then
[48:19] something has to be in its place amen
[48:21] god has to move things around he has to
[48:23] get people in place remember brother
[48:25] braham said when he saw the vision he
[48:26] says if there was a hat over there he
[48:28] says that hat had to be there before the
[48:30] vision could take place and he said i
[48:32] couldn't do it and nobody else could do
[48:34] it except the one that had that hat i
[48:35] couldn't force the prophecy i couldn't
[48:37] force the vision to take place and what
[48:39] we see here is god putting things into
[48:41] their place amen people that don't even
[48:43] realize they're part of the prophecy are
[48:45] being put into their place so that god
[48:47] can bring it to reality in their life
[48:49] amen
[48:50] because what once god has declared it's
[48:52] going to be one way it can only come
[48:54] that way god doesn't change his plan god
[48:56] doesn't change his word god doesn't
[48:58] change his way what god says will be
[49:00] because god cannot lie amen so we see
[49:02] here that god is setting up for prophecy
[49:04] to be fulfilled and god had to arrange
[49:06] for a clean woman
[49:08] right a believing woman a virgin of the
[49:11] right household or that was going to
[49:12] marry into the right household to be
[49:14] available for this prophecy to happen
[49:16] amen
[49:17] and until this angel speaks nobody knows
[49:20] that they're going to be a part of it
[49:22] amen that's what we need to understand
[49:23] in our lives sometimes is that even
[49:24] though god hasn't spoken yet yet there
[49:27] may be something that we don't know
[49:28] that's going to be fulfilled in our life
[49:30] amen we've got to be what doing as mary
[49:32] did walking along faithful in what we
[49:34] believe and trusting that we're going to
[49:36] be a part of something at some point
[49:38] amen that we are not here without
[49:39] purpose that we're not here without a
[49:41] plan but god has us here for a purpose
[49:43] and it is to fulfill prophecy amen we
[49:45] are a prophetic age amen we're in the
[49:47] eagle anointing here we've had a prophet
[49:49] that comes to us and he's brought us
[49:50] something that is for us each in
[49:53] particular specifically amen god has
[49:55] something for brother david god has
[49:56] something for sister maureen for brother
[49:58] mark and down through the church each
[50:00] and every one of us have a part to play
[50:01] and an angel has come to us amen that is
[50:04] what he came as he came to tell us that
[50:06] you were a part of something that's
[50:07] going to happen in this age amen
[50:10] now listen brother braham says this he
[50:12] says when god has spoke anything he will
[50:14] perform it now he's speaking about
[50:16] prophecy in general now he says amen you
[50:19] believe that he's going to have a church
[50:21] i don't know who's in it but he's going
[50:23] to have a church without spot or wrinkle
[50:26] it's somebody
[50:27] amen i don't know who it is but it'll be
[50:30] there you say where will they get it i
[50:32] don't know but it's going to be there
[50:34] for god has said so and god can't lie so
[50:37] he said in the principle don't worry
[50:39] about the how just worry about the what
[50:41] if you know the what then the how it
[50:43] doesn't matter because god said it and
[50:45] you don't have to worry you can take it
[50:47] and believe that it's going to happen
[50:49] amen
[50:50] amen mary and joseph were alive a long
[50:52] time joseph was quite a bit older than
[50:53] mary as best we know right he had no
[50:56] clue that he was going to be the father
[50:58] of the messiah
[50:59] he had no idea about it he had lived for
[51:01] maybe 40 50 years walking through life
[51:03] and he had no idea that he was tied into
[51:05] the scriptures amen but yet he was a
[51:08] part of it and not doing it yet amen but
[51:10] until god starts working in their lives
[51:12] they can't know but as soon as he does
[51:14] religion starts to become reality amen
[51:16] prophecy starts to unfold and they
[51:18] realize hey i'm a part of what he's been
[51:20] talking about a long time
[51:22] verse 28 says and the angel came in unto
[51:24] her and said hail beca or thou that are
[51:27] highly favored the lord is with thee
[51:30] blessed art thou among women the angel
[51:32] pulls her out from the entire crowd and
[51:34] says among all of the women you are
[51:36] blessed
[51:37] amen of all the people on earth you are
[51:39] blessed mary there's only one can
[51:41] fulfill this and you're the one amen
[51:43] you're the one that's going to fulfill
[51:45] this you're blessed because you've been
[51:46] chosen mary amen you've been highly
[51:49] favored and when she saw him she was
[51:51] troubled at his saying and cast in her
[51:53] mind what manner of salutation this
[51:55] should be because he hasn't told her
[51:57] what she's got that's going to make her
[51:58] so blessed yet but he says you're
[52:00] blessed and highly favored now i've
[52:02] never had an angelic visitation in this
[52:04] way and i would imagine if he came an
[52:06] angel came to me i'd be wondering well
[52:07] what's this all about amen especially
[52:09] the angel gabriel i'm sure he was a
[52:11] mighty angel you know very imposing in
[52:13] his appearance and i'm sure mary had
[52:15] never had an angelic visitation all of a
[52:17] sudden he's standing there and he's
[52:18] proclaiming that you're special mary
[52:20] you're blessed and highly favored and
[52:22] she's saying well what's this all about
[52:24] what have i done
[52:25] what is it that's going to be so amazing
[52:28] you know is it a million shekels i'm
[52:29] going to win tomorrow in the judean
[52:31] lottery you know am i gonna have a
[52:34] wonderful life am i gonna have you know
[52:36] the the greatest king born perhaps maybe
[52:39] i'm gonna be part of the revolution who
[52:41] knows what was going through her head
[52:42] she doesn't understand because it hasn't
[52:44] been told or her part but she knows that
[52:46] something's about to happen that's
[52:47] really amazing amen
[52:49] but there's going to i want to say that
[52:51] to say this that there's got to come a
[52:53] place and a time in your life where god
[52:54] starts to speak to you by name where he
[52:56] says you are blessed and you are highly
[52:58] favored and you have a plan and you have
[53:00] a purpose and you have a role to play
[53:02] and i'm about to tell you what that is
[53:04] and we've got to be open to what he says
[53:06] our role and our and and his plan is for
[53:08] us amen there's got to be a time where
[53:10] that religion starts to become a reality
[53:12] where there's a relationship that
[53:13] develops out of all the things that
[53:15] we've heard and all the things we've
[53:16] been taught and all the services we've
[53:18] attended and all the preachers we've
[53:20] we've sat under there has to come a time
[53:22] where it becomes a reality and god says
[53:24] let's put it into react into reality now
[53:27] let's put it into a purpose let's put it
[53:29] into your life and take everything
[53:30] you've had to this point and make
[53:32] something out of it
[53:33] amen because mary didn't get here by
[53:35] happenstance she had kept her life clean
[53:37] she was a clean vessel for the coming
[53:39] messiah amen she had to be there and
[53:41] that was why because mary had taken the
[53:43] word seriously she had taken what the
[53:45] priest had taught she'd taken what her
[53:46] parents had taught and she'd held it in
[53:48] her heart and she'd done the right thing
[53:50] but it was for a purpose we don't just
[53:52] do the right thing to do the right thing
[53:53] but there's a purpose behind it and it
[53:55] is to make us prepared to bring forth
[53:57] life amen it is to make us prepared to
[54:00] bring forth a word for our day amen i
[54:02] don't care what your doctrine is in and
[54:04] of itself you've got to have the right
[54:06] doctrine but the right doctrine is not
[54:07] going to make you what god needs you to
[54:09] be it's a part of it amen i don't care
[54:11] how good your church is i don't care how
[54:13] good your pastor is the ministry you is
[54:15] your bloodline your family your
[54:17] schooling none of this matters that what
[54:19] matters is are you going to be ready
[54:20] when he speaks to you amen are you going
[54:22] to answer the call because how many have
[54:24] sat in a perfect church with perfect
[54:26] ministries and perfect doctrine and then
[54:28] god comes their way and they walk away
[54:30] amen they're too happy to sit with the
[54:32] understanding of it and and the teaching
[54:35] of it but they don't want to step into
[54:37] the reality of the word for their day
[54:39] but mary's willing to do it as we'll see
[54:41] amen
[54:42] amen we have to be able to see past the
[54:44] pages of the bible past the flawed men
[54:46] and the pulpits plus our our our parents
[54:49] that didn't do everything right and and
[54:50] past the things that have gone wrong in
[54:52] our life and see that there is a god
[54:53] behind it that is orchestrating all
[54:55] these things to bring us to a place
[54:57] where he can talk to us and we can
[54:58] respond in a way that will receive what
[55:00] he has for us amen
[55:03] brother braham says this
[55:05] he's talking about mary amen he says he
[55:07] came to a simple
[55:09] plain
[55:10] humble believer
[55:12] hallelujah
[55:13] he says
[55:15] he that's the way he does today too you
[55:18] don't entice god by the way you dress as
[55:20] in god doesn't come to you based on the
[55:21] way you dress
[55:23] you entice god by the way you live and
[55:26] think
[55:27] and act
[55:28] now i'm sure mary dressed right
[55:31] but what entices him he says is the way
[55:33] you live the way you think and you act
[55:35] he says god help us to get back to the
[55:38] old-fashioned holy ghost gospel i
[55:41] believe in it don't you
[55:42] old time backwoods sky blue sin killing
[55:45] religion that's right it'll help you and
[55:48] it'll save you
[55:50] what we've got to a place where what
[55:52] we've got is so much doctrine and so
[55:54] much truth and it is truth
[55:57] but we've missed out the fact that we've
[55:58] got to live it not just know it and
[56:00] that's what mary was doing was she was
[56:02] walking in a way that was pleasing to
[56:04] god we know
[56:05] right
[56:06] the angel said to her in verse 30 he
[56:07] says fear not mary for thou hast found
[56:10] favor with god and behold thou shalt
[56:13] conceive in thy womb and bring forth the
[56:15] son and shall call his name jesus and he
[56:18] shall be great and shall be called the
[56:20] son of the highest and the lord god
[56:21] shall give unto him the throne of his
[56:24] father david now he's telling her what
[56:26] this is all about and she is going to be
[56:29] the linchpin in the fulfillment of all
[56:31] of the law and the prophets they've been
[56:33] looking forward to this day where they
[56:34] would wouldn't have to sacrifice anymore
[56:37] they wouldn't have to go to the temple
[56:38] for all the feasts and this and that the
[56:40] other thing she is going to be the one
[56:41] that brings forth the messiah that
[56:42] they've been looking for for what four
[56:44] thousand years four thousand years is
[56:47] going to be fulfilled in mary's life and
[56:49] she's just a simple plain humble
[56:50] believer
[56:51] amen we're gonna have six thousand years
[56:53] fulfilled in our life six thousand years
[56:55] of waiting for what a full redemption
[56:57] and it's going to happen to who plain
[57:00] simple believers amen it's not going to
[57:02] be the big whats the big whos the big
[57:05] halves amen it's going to be the plain
[57:07] simple believers that'll just take him
[57:09] at his word and live that clean simple
[57:12] life before him and trust that he's
[57:14] going to do what he has to do in their
[57:15] lives amen
[57:17] verse 33 says and he shall reign over
[57:19] the house of jacob forever and of his
[57:22] kingdom there shall be no end
[57:24] he say mary you're going to fulfill
[57:25] prophecy you're going to be the vessel
[57:27] through which everything that you've
[57:28] ever hoped for will come
[57:31] can you imagine that can you imagine if
[57:33] today an angel came to you and said
[57:35] sister brenda you're going to kick off
[57:37] the rapture
[57:38] can you that's that's literally what
[57:40] we're talking about here is in your life
[57:42] something's going to happen that's going
[57:43] to trigger the greatest thing that ever
[57:46] happened on this earth which was the
[57:47] redemption promise of god amen but it's
[57:49] no different for us he's going to come
[57:51] to you and he has come to you and said
[57:53] you're gonna be a part of it now this
[57:55] time it's not just one person it's a
[57:56] multi-member body amen all of us have to
[57:59] give birth to the word in this in this
[58:00] time in this age amen but that angel is
[58:03] coming to you and he's saying it's gonna
[58:04] start in you and it's gonna start in you
[58:06] and it's going to start in you and it's
[58:08] going to start in you until the whole
[58:09] thing just takes off and we're out of
[58:11] here amen
[58:12] what there's going to come a place
[58:14] where he fulfills his word amen in his
[58:17] completeness amen
[58:19] he's talking to mary
[58:21] that little old girl little tiny girl
[58:23] nothing there's nothing special about
[58:25] mary from the outside as far as we know
[58:26] amen
[58:28] plain simple believers it's not going to
[58:29] be the great ones amongst us
[58:31] and then it's not going to be the
[58:32] prettiest it's not going to be the
[58:34] greatest speakers it's not going to be
[58:35] the ones that have the answers all the
[58:37] time and then it's going to be the
[58:38] simple humble victorious believer that's
[58:40] going to walk out of here amen it's not
[58:42] going to be the most gifted one the most
[58:43] popular one this is not what's going to
[58:45] take us into that place amen it's going
[58:48] to be the simple humble believer that
[58:50] gets you there amen he's got to get you
[58:52] to be a nobody that's what he's trying
[58:54] to do he's trying to get jonathan
[58:55] curlett to be a nobody so that he can be
[58:58] something amen and he's got to do the
[59:00] same thing in each and every one of us
[59:02] get us to the place where we are
[59:03] nobodies amen well we are absolutely
[59:06] nothing and then he can fill that up and
[59:08] he can do something amazing with it you
[59:10] look at the ones that were great people
[59:11] in the in the in the scriptures you look
[59:13] at moses moses was a great somebody
[59:15] wasn't he
[59:16] moses had many years of training he had
[59:18] years of luxury he had all the strength
[59:21] he had all the military prowess he had
[59:23] the intellectual knowledge that was
[59:25] needed to deliver the children and what
[59:26] to do god do god took him in the
[59:28] backside of the desert for 40 years and
[59:30] beat the daylights out of him until he
[59:32] couldn't even talk that's where he ended
[59:34] up and then he came out with what power
[59:36] and demonstration because he knew there
[59:38] was not in his sufficiency it was in the
[59:40] sufficiency of the god that called him
[59:42] to do it in the first place amen he had
[59:44] all the position and all the power to do
[59:46] it in the first place god took him out
[59:47] of it and then brought him back with
[59:49] what god's strength not his with god's
[59:51] knowledge with god's word with god's
[59:52] understanding and that's what gave them
[59:54] an exodus out of out of egypt amen
[59:59] now he says what the holy ghost is going
[1:00:01] to come upon you and overshadow you
[1:00:04] sorry then said mary unto the angel how
[1:00:06] shall this be seen that i know not a man
[1:00:08] it's a great question i'm sure mary knew
[1:00:10] about the birds and the bees at this
[1:00:11] point and she knows to have a baby a
[1:00:13] man's got to be involved she also knows
[1:00:15] she hasn't had any relationship with any
[1:00:17] man so she says how's this going to
[1:00:18] happen i i'm not disbelieving you but i
[1:00:22] need to know the mechanism here i need
[1:00:23] to know how this is supposed to happen
[1:00:25] because i'm pure and i have no intention
[1:00:27] of being anything but pure so tell me
[1:00:29] how this is going to happen amen it's
[1:00:31] funny because mary is talking to a
[1:00:33] supernatural being she's talking to the
[1:00:35] angel gabriel and yet he's talking about
[1:00:38] a supernatural event happening and she's
[1:00:39] saying how
[1:00:41] while she's experiencing the
[1:00:42] supernatural right there it seems like
[1:00:44] it wouldn't be too big of a leap to say
[1:00:45] the supernatural is going to continue
[1:00:47] amen when god starts something
[1:00:49] supernatural expect the supernatural to
[1:00:51] continue amen but she's sure she says i
[1:00:53] don't know how this is supposed to be no
[1:00:55] doubt she's read the scripture and it
[1:00:56] says a virgin will conceive and she's
[1:00:58] she's saying i know how that that that's
[1:01:00] in there but how is it going to happen
[1:01:02] lord how is it going to happen
[1:01:04] what is it she's in a fallen condition
[1:01:06] she knows there's no spoken word babies
[1:01:08] anymore there's nothing that's going to
[1:01:10] happen perhaps the way it should have in
[1:01:11] the garden of eden something's going to
[1:01:12] have to change inside of mary because
[1:01:14] otherwise she needs a man to make this
[1:01:16] happen right
[1:01:17] isn't that really our trouble half the
[1:01:19] time is we're sitting here and we're
[1:01:21] believing in a supernatural god we've
[1:01:23] experienced the supernatural we've heard
[1:01:25] the supernatural we've seen the
[1:01:26] supernatural and then we run up against
[1:01:28] something and we say how is it going to
[1:01:29] happen
[1:01:32] it's going to happen the same way it
[1:01:33] always has
[1:01:34] god said therefore it will be right it
[1:01:36] is the supernatural from start to finish
[1:01:38] it's supernatural that you wake up every
[1:01:40] morning
[1:01:41] right it's supernatural that you're
[1:01:42] provided in this in this crazy age that
[1:01:45] we're in it's supernatural that we have
[1:01:46] our health it's supernatural that we
[1:01:48] have our sanity we just don't recognize
[1:01:50] it so often because it's become common
[1:01:51] to us but we are living supernatural
[1:01:54] lives that we can stay apart from this
[1:01:55] world every day of our lives amen so all
[1:01:57] it's looking for is just that little bit
[1:01:59] more of supernatural amen whether it's
[1:02:01] the healing of your body whether it's
[1:02:02] the saving of of your kids souls whether
[1:02:05] it's a change in your life that's needed
[1:02:07] whatever it is he's just looking you to
[1:02:09] take that next step forward amen and
[1:02:11] just say the supernatural has started so
[1:02:12] let's keep expecting the supernatural
[1:02:14] god to work in our lives amen
[1:02:17] we've got to look beyond what we can see
[1:02:18] beyond what we hear and do what seeing
[1:02:21] here by eyes and ears of faith amen amen
[1:02:23] but god's gracious to mary
[1:02:26] he has an answer for it says in the
[1:02:28] angel answer and said unto her the holy
[1:02:30] ghost shall come upon thee and the power
[1:02:32] of the highest shall overshadow thee
[1:02:34] therefore also that holy thing which
[1:02:37] shall be born of thee shall be called
[1:02:38] the son of god can i rephrase that this
[1:02:41] morning mary
[1:02:42] you won't have to do a thing
[1:02:45] mary it won't have to do with you mary
[1:02:47] you won't have a part in it whatever's
[1:02:49] going to happen in you is going to be
[1:02:51] supernatural mary when it comes to
[1:02:53] bringing forth the prophecy of god when
[1:02:54] it comes to bringing forth the promise
[1:02:56] of god mary you don't have a place in
[1:02:58] this all you have to do is sit still and
[1:03:01] the holy spirit is going to do the work
[1:03:03] inside of you and mary you probably
[1:03:05] won't even know when it happens
[1:03:08] do you know why brother braham says that
[1:03:09] we could have the anointing or the the
[1:03:11] the holy spirit without sensation
[1:03:14] because mary had it right here
[1:03:16] she did not have a
[1:03:17] sensation as far as she knew when
[1:03:19] conception occurred in her womb there
[1:03:21] wasn't something to tell her it had
[1:03:23] happened
[1:03:24] no doubt the next morning she started
[1:03:26] maybe to have morning sickness you know
[1:03:28] maybe the little poof started to appear
[1:03:29] in her belly or something like that but
[1:03:31] as far as we know there was nothing to
[1:03:33] tell mary that it had happened and yet
[1:03:35] it had happened
[1:03:36] and mary knew that and something changes
[1:03:38] in her life amen but this is what we
[1:03:40] have to understand friends is when we're
[1:03:41] looking to the supernatural it's not you
[1:03:43] that can do it mary can't sing herself
[1:03:46] into having the messiah she can't
[1:03:47] worship herself into having the messiah
[1:03:50] she can dance around the altar into
[1:03:51] having the messiah all she can do is
[1:03:54] trust that what he said will happen and
[1:03:56] move forward now there's one thing mary
[1:03:58] can do and we'll get to it in a little
[1:04:00] bit amen
[1:04:02] but the angel continues and this is a
[1:04:04] beautiful time because he says and
[1:04:06] behold thy cousin elizabeth she had also
[1:04:08] conceived a son in her old age and this
[1:04:11] is the sixth month with her who is
[1:04:13] called baron so elizabeth has john the
[1:04:15] baptist in her stomach and he's six
[1:04:17] months in there
[1:04:19] he says for with god nothing shall be
[1:04:21] impossible now elizabeth was past the
[1:04:23] time of bearing children so he points
[1:04:26] her and he says look there's another
[1:04:27] supernatural birth that's happening and
[1:04:30] she's your cousin and she's having the
[1:04:32] same thing you're having but in a
[1:04:34] different way but it's supernatural
[1:04:35] nonetheless and she's going to have a
[1:04:37] baby and he's going to be supernatural
[1:04:39] as well
[1:04:40] and mary said behold the handmaid of the
[1:04:43] lord be it unto me according to thy word
[1:04:47] and the angel departed from her now mary
[1:04:50] never sees this angel again she has one
[1:04:52] experience with the angel gabriel and
[1:04:54] that's it
[1:04:56] right and that's all mary needed
[1:04:58] if you notice that's all mary needed she
[1:05:00] just needed him to tell her what and how
[1:05:03] and she was ready to go and she said be
[1:05:05] it unto me according to that word she
[1:05:07] didn't question she didn't doubt
[1:05:09] she just took it and she said whatever
[1:05:11] you say let it happen to me and she
[1:05:13] moved forward with it amen
[1:05:15] that's the place we have to find
[1:05:17] ourselves is where what we take the one
[1:05:19] word and we move forward when god says
[1:05:22] it when he quickens it to our heart we
[1:05:24] can take it and move forward and it has
[1:05:25] nothing to do with what we do say or
[1:05:27] feel amen we can move forward because
[1:05:29] god is the one that said it
[1:05:32] but watch what happens here
[1:05:34] brother branham is speaking
[1:05:36] of he's blending the two stories of john
[1:05:38] the baptist in jesus birth he says now i
[1:05:40] want you to know something come
[1:05:42] closely look when the angel came to the
[1:05:43] priest zacharias and told him that
[1:05:45] elizabeth was going to have a child by
[1:05:47] him he had plenty of examples before
[1:05:50] that hannah had had a child past age of
[1:05:52] baring sarah nearly a hundred years old
[1:05:54] or better had brought a
[1:05:56] child after the age of bearing plenty of
[1:05:58] examples but that callous priest failed
[1:06:01] to believe god but mary never she never
[1:06:04] questioned
[1:06:06] now when the angel came to zacharias it
[1:06:08] was the same angel gabriel and he had
[1:06:10] the same message your wife was going to
[1:06:11] have a child and he's going to be a
[1:06:12] special child but zachariah didn't have
[1:06:15] faith
[1:06:17] and brother branham says the reason why
[1:06:19] zachariah is struck mute is because he
[1:06:22] had examples to go by and he refused to
[1:06:24] believe the examples
[1:06:26] mary asked the same question as
[1:06:28] zachariah
[1:06:29] zechariah said how
[1:06:31] mary said how but in zechariah's case it
[1:06:33] was unbelief that asked how because
[1:06:36] brother bram says he had all the
[1:06:37] examples already he had his very line
[1:06:40] came from out of impossibility
[1:06:42] and he disbelieved amen but mary she was
[1:06:45] asked to do something that had never
[1:06:46] happened before she was allowed to ask
[1:06:48] how and it wasn't unbelief it was just
[1:06:50] clarification for her but zechariah was
[1:06:52] doubt that was asking and that's why he
[1:06:54] was struck mute but mary never she never
[1:06:56] questions he said behold the handmaid of
[1:06:58] the lord be it unto me according to thy
[1:07:01] word
[1:07:01] notice she didn't wait till she was
[1:07:04] positive
[1:07:05] she didn't wait till she felt something
[1:07:07] and felt life she started right then
[1:07:10] praising god for it for she had his
[1:07:13] promise
[1:07:15] brother brown continues he says brother
[1:07:17] sister give us some more mary's here who
[1:07:19] will take god at his word and not wait
[1:07:21] till you feel something or something
[1:07:24] happens take his word and start
[1:07:26] rejoicing about it hallelujah
[1:07:28] god said he's the healer i believe it he
[1:07:30] said he created me i believe it take his
[1:07:33] word and start rejoicing about it
[1:07:35] hallelujah that's the kind of people we
[1:07:37] need she went right around telling
[1:07:39] everybody she was going to have the baby
[1:07:41] and wasn't no sign or nothing of it she
[1:07:43] didn't have to have any signs only thing
[1:07:46] she had to have was god's word
[1:07:48] that's all we have to have god said so
[1:07:52] that settles it with me what about you
[1:07:55] believe it take him at his word and say
[1:07:57] it so and just go ahead that's all you
[1:08:00] have to have is his word it's bound to
[1:08:02] bring it forth he says you believe it
[1:08:04] brother stay with it hallelujah that's
[1:08:06] right stay with it it will bring results
[1:08:10] every time i've never
[1:08:13] seen it fail when a true heart comes
[1:08:17] before god and means business and took
[1:08:20] god at his word and started testifying
[1:08:22] of it and looking to the unseen then
[1:08:26] then god's promises always produces what
[1:08:29] it's asked for that's right amen we
[1:08:31] preached before that jesus christ is the
[1:08:33] high priest of one thing only our
[1:08:36] confession amen what is he saying he's
[1:08:38] saying confess his word i love mary said
[1:08:41] be it unto me according to
[1:08:43] thy word amen we get a lot of people
[1:08:46] talking words today and they're speaking
[1:08:49] things you see it in these ministries of
[1:08:51] spoken word for riches and wealth and
[1:08:54] and all of these things and they're
[1:08:55] speaking money into their lives and
[1:08:57] they're speaking this and that mary said
[1:08:59] beat unto me according to thy word and
[1:09:01] then mary went around and started
[1:09:03] repeating his word
[1:09:05] she didn't add to it she didn't take
[1:09:06] from it she just said what he said and
[1:09:09] she moved forward in it in full faith
[1:09:10] and belief amen
[1:09:14] amen we better be speaking his word
[1:09:16] amen you'll get into so much trouble if
[1:09:18] you start adding to or taking from we
[1:09:20] want to be able to take it back to his
[1:09:21] word to his promise for this age for me
[1:09:24] and for you amen
[1:09:27] but watch what happens to mary after
[1:09:28] this and this is a beautiful thing
[1:09:31] and mary arose in those days and went
[1:09:33] into the hill country with haste into a
[1:09:35] city of judah and entered into the house
[1:09:37] of zacharias and saluted elizabeth the
[1:09:40] first thing mary does is she goes for
[1:09:42] some fellowship with somebody else
[1:09:43] that's going through the same thing
[1:09:44] she's going through amen what does she
[1:09:47] do she goes to confirm the word with
[1:09:48] somebody else that's received a
[1:09:49] prophetic message
[1:09:51] and then brother branham prints this
[1:09:52] beautiful drama here and it's maybe a
[1:09:54] little bit of a side path but i wanted
[1:09:56] to include it this morning i thought it
[1:09:57] was a good instruction for us
[1:09:59] and he says i can see elizabeth sitting
[1:10:01] here on the porch maybe doing her work
[1:10:03] knitting or whatever she might be doing
[1:10:05] and mary comes up real quick as soon as
[1:10:08] mary comes she sees elizabeth my both
[1:10:10] christian women as we would call today
[1:10:12] ran out and threw their arms around one
[1:10:14] another hugged one another kiss one
[1:10:16] another saluting each other oh i like
[1:10:18] that i like a good warm feeling don't
[1:10:20] you
[1:10:21] i hate that old corn cold formal way
[1:10:24] we've got people today they're so far
[1:10:26] away from one another you don't care for
[1:10:28] one another that's what's the matter
[1:10:31] even church members get the same way
[1:10:33] they don't care for one another why if
[1:10:35] anybody does anything wrong try to shove
[1:10:37] them down don't shove them down pick
[1:10:39] them up help them that's right don't try
[1:10:42] to criticize him and tell somebody else
[1:10:44] go to him with your arms around him and
[1:10:46] today they got so afraid they don't even
[1:10:48] want to shake hands anymore
[1:10:50] now we don't do that because of cove at
[1:10:51] half the time but he's saying just
[1:10:53] because you're not what in communion
[1:10:55] with one another there's not a unity
[1:10:57] there something's happened he says they
[1:10:58] don't even want to shake hands anymore
[1:11:01] he says you don't know who's sitting
[1:11:03] right next to you today
[1:11:05] and in church and that fellows made a
[1:11:07] mistake that's one of god's sons or
[1:11:09] god's daughters don't turn them down
[1:11:11] help him that's right put an arm around
[1:11:13] him you don't know what god could do
[1:11:16] with him if you just help him a little
[1:11:17] bit
[1:11:18] that's right amen when i was reading
[1:11:20] this i thought that was a good reminder
[1:11:22] amen don't let things come between us
[1:11:24] don't let mistakes or misunderstandings
[1:11:26] come between us amen let's help each
[1:11:28] other and do what see what god will do
[1:11:30] in our lives it's i love what he says
[1:11:32] there you don't know what god would do
[1:11:34] with him if you just help him a little
[1:11:37] if you'll just be the one that steps out
[1:11:40] that lifts them up that encourages that
[1:11:42] restores whatever the case may be if
[1:11:44] you'll do that you never know what god
[1:11:45] might be able to do with that person
[1:11:47] amen too quickly we move to criticize
[1:11:49] don't we we moved to criticize we moved
[1:11:51] to point out the flaws and the mistakes
[1:11:53] and the whatever it might be that's
[1:11:55] going on you know but he says don't do
[1:11:56] that he says don't put him down don't
[1:11:58] criticize her
[1:12:00] what put your arms around them draw them
[1:12:01] back in amen
[1:12:04] what drew mary to elizabeth was what a
[1:12:06] commonality a commonality for a
[1:12:08] supernatural birth and that's the
[1:12:09] commonality we preached about here amen
[1:12:11] if somebody else has that new birth you
[1:12:13] ought to be able to if they're a brother
[1:12:15] and brother you you can put your arms
[1:12:17] around if it's a sister shake her hands
[1:12:19] amen but we ought to be able to greet
[1:12:21] one another and be close to one another
[1:12:23] and encourage one another and then to
[1:12:25] draw each other in if we're if we're in
[1:12:28] commonality with that supernatural
[1:12:29] birthday meant by the holy spirit in our
[1:12:31] lives amen we ought to be able to hug
[1:12:33] the neck of every person that's got the
[1:12:35] holy ghost
[1:12:37] verse 41 says and it came to pass that
[1:12:39] when elizabeth heard the salutation of
[1:12:41] mary the babe leaped in her womb and
[1:12:44] elizabeth was filled with the holy ghost
[1:12:47] when i read this i thought when's the
[1:12:48] last time my conversation or my greeting
[1:12:50] had that kind of effect on a person
[1:12:52] and then when somebody sees me coming
[1:12:54] when i speak to somebody do they perk up
[1:12:58] right does something in them kind of
[1:12:59] rise up and well up that's life
[1:13:01] that's love that's encouragement that's
[1:13:03] growth that's strength
[1:13:05] or do they see me coming and they start
[1:13:07] to wilt a little bit inside and say
[1:13:09] what's he going to say to me today
[1:13:11] i thought it was great her greeting
[1:13:13] caused life
[1:13:15] inside of elizabeth amen we ought to
[1:13:17] bring life to one another amen we ought
[1:13:18] to be able to stir up the life that's
[1:13:20] already in there if we could put it that
[1:13:21] way when you come to a brother or sister
[1:13:24] and they say hey he's coming to my house
[1:13:26] she's coming to my house we're going to
[1:13:27] have a good time in the lord today
[1:13:29] there's going to be life there's going
[1:13:30] to be encouragement there's going to be
[1:13:31] testimonies amen i'm going to walk away
[1:13:34] better because they encouraged me
[1:13:35] because they came into my house today
[1:13:37] man you look here and there's an
[1:13:39] anointing that comes across elizabeth
[1:13:40] she gets a taste of what pentecost is
[1:13:43] going to have amen now she's not full of
[1:13:45] the holy ghost the way that they were on
[1:13:46] the day of pentecost this is an
[1:13:48] anointing that drops on her
[1:13:51] right
[1:13:52] this is an anointing that drops on her
[1:13:53] and if you notice the first thing it
[1:13:55] does is when that anointing drops on her
[1:13:57] it reinforces the word of god amen the
[1:14:00] holy spirit on you will cause you to
[1:14:02] reinforce the word of god not to go off
[1:14:04] in your own thinking or your own way but
[1:14:06] it will cause you to come back to the
[1:14:08] word and reinforce it to the one that
[1:14:09] you're speaking to amen
[1:14:11] it says and she spake out with a loud
[1:14:13] voice and said blessed art thou among
[1:14:16] woman women and blessed is the fruit of
[1:14:18] thy womb
[1:14:19] now that's what the angel said
[1:14:21] and she's saying what the angel said
[1:14:23] because why she's got the holy ghost on
[1:14:25] her causing her to speak
[1:14:27] she says and whence is this to me
[1:14:29] that the mother of my lord should come
[1:14:31] to me
[1:14:33] for lo as soon as the voice of thy
[1:14:35] salutation sounded in my ears the babe
[1:14:38] leaped in my womb for joy amen this is
[1:14:40] the kind of fellowship i want us to have
[1:14:42] amen if we were to take something into
[1:14:44] the new year let's let our fellowship
[1:14:46] cause love and joy to rise up within the
[1:14:48] one that's when hearing
[1:14:50] of our words amen that the right word
[1:14:52] spoken to the right person would cause
[1:14:53] life to bring to come forth in there in
[1:14:56] their bodies amen in their souls and
[1:14:58] their spirits amen
[1:15:00] but you have to understand here that
[1:15:02] she's pregnant six months and this is
[1:15:04] the first time that elizabeth has felt
[1:15:06] life in her womb
[1:15:08] it's the first time that she actually
[1:15:09] has her her belly's getting bigger
[1:15:13] but yet the baby has not moved to this
[1:15:14] point six months in that's not natural
[1:15:16] that's not normal for a baby to go that
[1:15:19] long without kicking amen
[1:15:21] and the reason he hadn't kicked was
[1:15:23] because of unbelief
[1:15:24] as we spoke about before but the brabham
[1:15:27] says this he says then he came and he
[1:15:28] announced that john was to be born
[1:15:30] and zacharias that priest
[1:15:33] righteous man yet without the
[1:15:35] appropriate faith
[1:15:37] you get what i mean many people come in
[1:15:39] the line say i've been a christian for
[1:15:40] 30 years that's good but what about your
[1:15:43] faith now
[1:15:45] god can't heal you on the merits of your
[1:15:47] salvation he heals you on the merits of
[1:15:49] your faith if you believe hallelujah
[1:15:51] notice if you believe he never said to
[1:15:53] the gentile woman anything but said if
[1:15:55] you believe all right he says that's the
[1:15:57] question
[1:15:58] can you believe god and take him at his
[1:16:02] word oh my if we do that there be a
[1:16:05] hallelujah sweep across the country
[1:16:07] healings would come from everywhere
[1:16:09] you'd see men out on the street claiming
[1:16:11] god healed him stay with it
[1:16:14] god will bring it to pass that's right
[1:16:16] because he's under obligation he swore
[1:16:19] that he would do it
[1:16:20] would he say it zachariah didn't have
[1:16:22] faith for that baby to show life that
[1:16:24] was a punishment from god we could put
[1:16:26] it that way where zachariah couldn't
[1:16:28] talk
[1:16:29] because he couldn't talk because he
[1:16:30] wouldn't express the right thing so god
[1:16:32] god shot his mouth so he couldn't speak
[1:16:34] he could no longer bring unbelief to the
[1:16:36] situation and then mary comes in with
[1:16:38] faith and it causes that baby to kick
[1:16:40] for the first time amen what zechariah
[1:16:42] was paying a price because he would not
[1:16:44] believe
[1:16:46] amen
[1:16:47] but there that voice speaks full of
[1:16:50] faith full of the promise and that baby
[1:16:52] comes to life within elizabeth and it
[1:16:54] causes her to what causes her to worship
[1:16:56] it causes her to confirm the word
[1:16:57] because now she knows that the baby's
[1:16:59] going to be okay now that life is proven
[1:17:01] inside of her and she's got a rest there
[1:17:03] and a piece there that it's all going to
[1:17:04] be all right amen
[1:17:06] amen if there's one thing our voice is
[1:17:07] meant to do brothers and sisters it is
[1:17:09] to confess the word of god and let
[1:17:12] everything else be a lie amen let our
[1:17:14] voice be speaking the word of god let
[1:17:16] our lips give praise to god let our
[1:17:18] confession be the word of god is true
[1:17:20] and everything else is a lie
[1:17:23] and then the prophet continues with his
[1:17:24] little drama here he says and i can hear
[1:17:26] elizabeth say yes i am oh i'm so happy
[1:17:28] about it but mary i'm just a little
[1:17:30] afraid see it's six months with me as
[1:17:32] mother and as far as we know the baby
[1:17:34] has no life she was a little weary yet
[1:17:36] about it you know
[1:17:38] little john was there and that's all
[1:17:39] together unnatural you see it's not
[1:17:41] right so about two or three months
[1:17:42] you're supposed to feel life and here
[1:17:44] she was all this time and no life yet
[1:17:46] and mary said the angel gabriel met me
[1:17:48] and told me that i was going to bring
[1:17:50] forth a son also and i was to call his
[1:17:52] name jesus well just the time that she
[1:17:55] spoke jesus little john began to leap
[1:17:58] and jump in his mother's womb
[1:18:00] brother the name of jesus christ the
[1:18:02] first time the name of jesus christ was
[1:18:04] ever spoke it brought life to a dead
[1:18:07] baby what audit to bring to a holy ghost
[1:18:10] church when the name of jesus
[1:18:12] is spoken
[1:18:13] hallelujah yes that name jesus christ
[1:18:16] when it was first spoken by mortal lips
[1:18:18] it brought life to a baby that was dead
[1:18:20] in his mother's womb the bible said he
[1:18:22] received the holy ghost and was born
[1:18:24] from his mother's womb full of the holy
[1:18:25] ghost hallelujah oh my what's the matter
[1:18:28] with christians
[1:18:29] wishy-washy half jellyfish
[1:18:33] what's that that's a lukewarm condition
[1:18:35] isn't it you're not one and you're not
[1:18:37] the other you'll just stay in the middle
[1:18:38] and be nothing right you'll be cold
[1:18:40] water's at least good for refreshing and
[1:18:42] hot water is good for everything
[1:18:44] he says you won't be anything what is it
[1:18:46] you're wishy-washy half jellyfish get a
[1:18:49] backbone in you and stand up for god and
[1:18:51] what's right and today's stand for what
[1:18:54] the bible says and believe it with all
[1:18:56] your heart
[1:18:57] think what it done when jesus name was
[1:18:59] spoke it brought life to that dead baby
[1:19:02] what ought it to bring to your limbs sir
[1:19:04] what ought to bring to your sickness to
[1:19:06] you men sitting here and you over there
[1:19:08] take the name of jesus with you
[1:19:10] everywhere you go breathe it everywhere
[1:19:13] in prayer be loyal be holy live for god
[1:19:16] and god will confirm his word yes sir he
[1:19:20] swore that he would do it there you are
[1:19:22] and the word come into her ears and her
[1:19:25] baby began to leap for joy they were
[1:19:28] hugging one another
[1:19:30] i want to ask you what has your
[1:19:31] conversation been recently
[1:19:33] amen what have you been talking about
[1:19:35] recently amen are you speaking life
[1:19:38] or are you speaking life into something
[1:19:40] that's supposed to be dead dead
[1:19:42] situations past sins past mistakes past
[1:19:45] problems past people or are you bringing
[1:19:48] life into something that needs life
[1:19:50] because when mary came she spoke life
[1:19:52] into something that was supposed to be
[1:19:53] living she wasn't trying to resurrect
[1:19:55] the dead she was trying to cause the
[1:19:57] that which was dead to live because it
[1:19:59] was supposed to be alive amen when the
[1:20:01] holy spirit's moving we need to speak
[1:20:02] things life into things that need to
[1:20:04] live and let things that are supposed to
[1:20:06] be dead stay dead because the more we
[1:20:09] talk about them the more alive they stay
[1:20:11] amen but if we can speak the word into
[1:20:13] the things that need life then we'll
[1:20:14] start to see life come forth amen what
[1:20:17] is it we put the word in our midst and
[1:20:18] we cling to what god has promised to us
[1:20:20] and then we hold fast what he said and
[1:20:22] let that be our only confession amen
[1:20:25] now we're coming up to the title
[1:20:27] scripture for today and this is going to
[1:20:29] be my new year scripture
[1:20:31] this is my new year scripture it's verse
[1:20:33] 45 it says and blessed is she that
[1:20:37] believed
[1:20:39] are you believing
[1:20:40] are you a believer this morning
[1:20:43] because if you are blessed are you that
[1:20:46] believe
[1:20:48] for there shall be a performance
[1:20:51] of those things which were told her from
[1:20:54] the lord
[1:20:55] amen each one of us is holding things in
[1:20:57] our hearts for the coming year amen
[1:20:59] we've got things that we prayed about
[1:21:01] for maybe days months weeks maybe even
[1:21:04] years
[1:21:05] and we do believe it and why do we
[1:21:07] believe it because we look in the word
[1:21:09] and the word has told us what to believe
[1:21:11] amen so if you have believed you're
[1:21:14] blessed this morning but there has to
[1:21:16] come a time where that blessing becomes
[1:21:18] a reality amen you're not blessed just
[1:21:20] because you believe you're blessed
[1:21:22] because as you believe so it will happen
[1:21:25] amen and if you've taken the word of god
[1:21:27] if you've taken the promises of god and
[1:21:29] you believed that then now it's time for
[1:21:31] him to perform them amen after you
[1:21:33] believe he performs
[1:21:35] amen mary is blessed because as she has
[1:21:38] believed so will be performed in her the
[1:21:41] thing that she believed would happen
[1:21:42] amen amen like i said before mary can't
[1:21:45] do anything she can't sing herself into
[1:21:47] this she can't worship herself into it
[1:21:49] she cannot do anything to bring forth
[1:21:51] the christ in her but she can do one
[1:21:54] thing and that is belief
[1:21:56] amen and she can speak and she can
[1:21:58] confess and she can believe and confess
[1:22:00] and speak and that is all she has to do
[1:22:03] and then it's going to happen inside of
[1:22:04] her whether she feels it or not whether
[1:22:06] she recognizes it or not and i can tell
[1:22:08] you in your own life you know this as
[1:22:10] you've gone before god and you've said
[1:22:12] lord change me lord add to me lord take
[1:22:14] it away from me and you have confessed
[1:22:16] his word and his promise you don't know
[1:22:18] the moment it was taken away in most
[1:22:20] cases some of us you know you get saved
[1:22:22] and you had you know the the desire for
[1:22:24] liquor or smoking or what you know if
[1:22:26] you came out of the world that way but
[1:22:28] for most of us we weren't living that
[1:22:29] way but yet there's a supernatural event
[1:22:32] that happened after we believed and god
[1:22:34] did it and we didn't determine the time
[1:22:36] all we determined was that he was going
[1:22:38] to do it and then he did it amen and
[1:22:40] that's what we look at we're not going
[1:22:41] to feel it every time you're not going
[1:22:43] to feel something lift off of you every
[1:22:44] time but what's going to happen is
[1:22:46] you're going to look back and you're
[1:22:47] going to say hey it's been six months
[1:22:49] since i did that where did that go right
[1:22:52] it's been six months since i've felt
[1:22:54] this it's been six months since i saw
[1:22:55] that it's been six months since i
[1:22:57] reacted this way wow he's done a change
[1:23:00] in my life hasn't he why because i
[1:23:02] believed i took him at his word i
[1:23:04] committed it to him and i kept walking
[1:23:06] forward as he's called me to amen
[1:23:08] why blessed is she that believe for
[1:23:10] there shall be a performance of those
[1:23:12] things which were told her from the lord
[1:23:14] didn't say there'll be things that were
[1:23:15] told you from somebody else or things
[1:23:17] that you said to yourself but if it
[1:23:19] comes from god then he's going to
[1:23:20] perform it if you can only believe it
[1:23:22] amen jesus went places where he could do
[1:23:24] no great miracles because they
[1:23:25] disbelieved
[1:23:27] but where they believed he could do all
[1:23:28] things because the people believed he
[1:23:30] could perform
[1:23:32] right
[1:23:35] 9 23 says if thou can't believe all
[1:23:38] things are possible to him that
[1:23:40] believeth
[1:23:42] amen only believe
[1:23:43] right
[1:23:44] it's all we were asked to do that's what
[1:23:46] he said to the he said brother branham
[1:23:48] quoted it earlier he said to the gentile
[1:23:49] woman if thou can't believe
[1:23:51] right and here it is if thou canst
[1:23:53] believe our things are possible to him
[1:23:55] that believeth listen god didn't
[1:23:56] randomly choose mary
[1:23:59] right god didn't have a tumblr full you
[1:24:01] know like to do these lottery things and
[1:24:02] he put all the names of the virgin
[1:24:05] believing women in a tumblr and just
[1:24:07] rotated it around a couple times and
[1:24:08] then randomly draw a name and it said
[1:24:10] mary
[1:24:11] right no he chose mary because he knew
[1:24:14] that she would believe he had prepared a
[1:24:16] vessel that would believe so that he
[1:24:18] could perform what he had promised to do
[1:24:19] amen he hasn't just picked your name at
[1:24:22] random amen he didn't just pick david
[1:24:24] sharp out of the lottery tumbler
[1:24:27] what he was chosen he was picked
[1:24:29] specifically because god knew that he
[1:24:31] would believe and he would hold and he
[1:24:33] would overcome and he would have the
[1:24:35] victory in this final age and he went
[1:24:37] through every person that's sitting in
[1:24:39] this church this morning and every
[1:24:40] member of the bride of christ and he
[1:24:42] called your name out of what the lamb's
[1:24:44] book of life it was written there before
[1:24:46] the foundation of the world and he says
[1:24:48] they're going to believe and they're
[1:24:50] going to overcome and they're going to
[1:24:51] have the victory amen it's not random
[1:24:54] it's not random there's not a chance
[1:24:55] that you will fail if he has called your
[1:24:58] name it's because you will be victorious
[1:24:59] it's because you will believe maybe
[1:25:01] though you don't now yet you will
[1:25:03] believe and you will go in that rapture
[1:25:04] you'll step off this earth without
[1:25:06] seeing death amen
[1:25:08] god chose someone that would take him at
[1:25:10] his word but brahm says now notice when
[1:25:12] god makes a promise to you he will
[1:25:15] fulfill it
[1:25:16] you don't have to be afraid that he will
[1:25:18] not keep his word for god will keep his
[1:25:20] word that's true you just must trust him
[1:25:24] amen amen like mary we can't make it
[1:25:27] happen
[1:25:28] we can't make it happen
[1:25:30] i can't make signs and wonders happen
[1:25:33] i can't make miracles happen i can't
[1:25:35] change myself i can't give myself
[1:25:37] character
[1:25:38] i can't make myself a more effective
[1:25:40] preacher i can't make myself a more
[1:25:42] effective lay person i can't do anything
[1:25:44] except surrender to him and say lord
[1:25:47] your word calls for it therefore i will
[1:25:48] receive it and i will believe it and i
[1:25:50] will lay my life down and let you do it
[1:25:52] amen amen
[1:25:55] there's got to be a supernatural event
[1:25:56] that's going to happen for that life to
[1:25:58] come forth in this age amen
[1:26:00] brother branham was talking about isaac
[1:26:01] and abraham going to mount moriah by
[1:26:03] god's command he says
[1:26:05] he says abraham got close to the
[1:26:07] mountain and he said to the servants you
[1:26:09] stay here
[1:26:10] think of how his heart must have been
[1:26:12] beating knowing that he was going up
[1:26:14] there to kill his son and destroy the
[1:26:16] only hope he had of ever being the
[1:26:18] father of nations
[1:26:20] but he said he have received him as one
[1:26:23] from the dead and he was persuaded that
[1:26:25] god could raise him up from the dead see
[1:26:27] that abraham faith see what it means no
[1:26:30] matter how ridiculous it sounds if god
[1:26:32] said it he means it amen if god said it
[1:26:36] he means it god doesn't waste his time
[1:26:39] with idol words
[1:26:41] right god doesn't have things in there
[1:26:42] that he threw in to trip us up if god
[1:26:44] said it it's because he means it he is
[1:26:47] the way
[1:26:48] he keeps his word it's up to him to see
[1:26:51] it through not you to try to see it
[1:26:53] through it's up to him to see it through
[1:26:56] he says now listen close i just love
[1:26:58] this he said to those servants you wait
[1:27:00] here the lad and i will go yonder to
[1:27:02] worship and the lad and i shall return
[1:27:06] how's he going to do it when he's got
[1:27:07] the knife and it's sharpened he's got
[1:27:09] the fire in his hand he's got the wood
[1:27:10] on his back and he took it all off his
[1:27:12] own back and placed it on isaac a
[1:27:14] beautiful type of christ packing that
[1:27:16] wooden cross up the hill he said you
[1:27:18] wait here the lad and i will go yonder
[1:27:20] to worship and we shall return amen he
[1:27:22] says how oh my how are you going to get
[1:27:25] out of those wheelchairs it's none of
[1:27:27] your business to think about it
[1:27:29] he's talking to people listen brother
[1:27:31] branham services they would stack up
[1:27:33] wheelchairs after the service in some
[1:27:35] places they literally took truckloads of
[1:27:38] wheelchairs away because those people
[1:27:39] didn't need them anymore he says how are
[1:27:41] you going to get out of that wheelchair
[1:27:43] sir
[1:27:44] how are you going to get well
[1:27:46] it's none of your business to think
[1:27:47] about it how are you going to get well
[1:27:49] it's god's promise the only thing to do
[1:27:52] is keep
[1:27:53] moving
[1:27:54] on in another message he said he's
[1:27:56] jehovah jireh how will he do it i don't
[1:27:59] know that's his business but he said he
[1:28:01] would do it and i believe him jehovah
[1:28:03] jireh the lord will provide for himself
[1:28:05] a sacrifice
[1:28:07] no matter what it is the lamb was there
[1:28:10] he provided a lamb when it needed a lamb
[1:28:14] catch that when you needed a lamb he
[1:28:17] provided a lamb
[1:28:18] he didn't provide a a bowl
[1:28:20] he didn't provide a goat you needed a
[1:28:22] lamb he gave you a lamb when you have a
[1:28:25] need he'll give you what you have need
[1:28:26] of he he says you don't ask for for a
[1:28:29] piece of bread or fish and he gives you
[1:28:31] a stone
[1:28:32] right what you have a need he gives you
[1:28:35] what you have need of
[1:28:36] right trust him because that's the way
[1:28:38] god works you have a need he's jehovah
[1:28:40] jireh he gives you what you have need of
[1:28:42] he says he provided a lamb when he
[1:28:45] needed a lamb when you're sick and you
[1:28:47] need healing he'll provide for you if
[1:28:49] you need salvation he provides for you
[1:28:52] if you need a revival he will provide
[1:28:54] for you if the meal barrel's empty he
[1:28:56] will provide for you amen if you're all
[1:28:59] down-hearted and drooped over god will
[1:29:01] provide for you what he's saying he's
[1:29:03] not just god of one thing he doesn't
[1:29:05] just have one answer but he meets you
[1:29:07] where your need is and he gives you what
[1:29:08] you have need of every single time
[1:29:12] if you're all down-hearted and drooped
[1:29:13] over god will provide for you for he was
[1:29:16] wounded for our transgressions bruised
[1:29:18] for our iniquity the chastisement of our
[1:29:20] peace was upon him and with his stripes
[1:29:22] we are healed amen the lord's provided
[1:29:24] sacrifice the lord's provided lamb we
[1:29:26] sang about it at the start of service i
[1:29:28] have a source
[1:29:30] of strength i have a source of healing i
[1:29:33] have a source of deliverance i have a a
[1:29:35] source of change
[1:29:37] what it's it's all there amen it's it's
[1:29:40] a wonderful thing that he has a a
[1:29:42] fountain open in the house of david for
[1:29:44] those who would believe
[1:29:46] amen
[1:29:47] you look at mary's response to this and
[1:29:49] it's such a beautiful thing and i
[1:29:50] believe this is a an instruction for us
[1:29:53] that when the supernatural is required
[1:29:55] in our life when god is moving when the
[1:29:57] word has been spoken and we take it we
[1:29:59] do what mary did and that's that mary
[1:30:01] did start to worship and she said mary
[1:30:04] said my soul does magnify the lord
[1:30:07] amen are we worried or are we magnifying
[1:30:10] and my spirit hath rejoiced in god my
[1:30:13] savior for he hath regarded the lowest
[1:30:16] state of his handmaiden i'm a nobody she
[1:30:19] says i'm just a girl
[1:30:21] it's like selena's saying at the the
[1:30:23] service right be born of me i'm just a
[1:30:25] little girl that's how mary was he's
[1:30:27] regarded the lowest state of his
[1:30:28] handmaiden for behold from henceforth
[1:30:31] all generations shall call me blessed
[1:30:35] now this is a totally different mary
[1:30:37] isn't it
[1:30:38] mary doesn't just think this is going to
[1:30:40] happen mary knows this is going to
[1:30:41] happen and she is giving him worship and
[1:30:44] praise for what he has said will happen
[1:30:46] in her life she went from a lowly
[1:30:48] handmaiden to everyone will call mary
[1:30:51] bless to the point where they worship
[1:30:53] her today
[1:30:54] that's how blessed she is that's that's
[1:30:56] the high esteem that mary has is that
[1:30:58] people will pray to her because they
[1:30:59] think she's something special
[1:31:01] right
[1:31:03] but look at what she says you took me
[1:31:05] from low and you put me to high
[1:31:07] james 4 10 says humble yourselves in the
[1:31:09] sight of the lord and he shall lift you
[1:31:12] up amen amen humble yourselves in the
[1:31:14] sight of the lord that's our part that's
[1:31:16] my part
[1:31:17] and then it says and he shall lift you
[1:31:19] up that's his party man if we lift
[1:31:21] ourselves up
[1:31:22] god pushes us down if we push ourselves
[1:31:25] down then god pushes us up amen luke 14
[1:31:28] 11 confirms it says for whosoever
[1:31:30] exalteth himself shall be abased and he
[1:31:33] that humbleth himself shall be exalted
[1:31:36] mary thought herself a nobody she lived
[1:31:38] as a nobody and look where it got her it
[1:31:41] got her to being the vessel for the very
[1:31:43] messiah that she had been waiting for
[1:31:44] all of her life amen mary's opinion of
[1:31:47] herself was that she was a nobody
[1:31:49] that's what god's looking for we spoke
[1:31:50] about it earlier god's looking for
[1:31:52] nobodies today people that will say
[1:31:54] there's nothing here that's worth
[1:31:56] talking about but if you'll step in if
[1:31:59] you'll do something if you'll let your
[1:32:01] word be born in me then maybe we'll have
[1:32:03] something to talk about but she's not
[1:32:05] glorifying herself now she's glorifying
[1:32:07] the god that did it amen
[1:32:10] verse 49 says for he that is mighty had
[1:32:12] done to me great things and holy is his
[1:32:15] name can you imagine if i'm up here
[1:32:16] saying i'm great
[1:32:20] right what would you think if i was up
[1:32:22] here saying i'm a great man i'm a great
[1:32:23] preacher well you'd laugh probably but
[1:32:25] the point is i'm not up here to speak
[1:32:27] about me am i
[1:32:29] look at mary she doesn't say i am mighty
[1:32:31] she says he is mighty that had done to
[1:32:34] me great things because she needed a
[1:32:36] great thing done to her to get her to
[1:32:38] where she needed to be and she had
[1:32:40] nothing to do with it so she's giving
[1:32:41] all the glory and all of the praise to
[1:32:44] him because he's the mighty one that did
[1:32:46] it amen he's the mighty angel he's the
[1:32:48] holy spirit he's the life that dropped
[1:32:51] into her and made her into something out
[1:32:52] of nothing the glory is given to him
[1:32:54] she's not lifting herself up she's
[1:32:56] lifting up the mighty one that did it
[1:32:57] amen that ought to be the way we speak
[1:33:00] amen for he that is mighty had done
[1:33:02] great things to me and holy is his name
[1:33:06] and his mercy is on them that fear him
[1:33:09] from generation to generation
[1:33:12] he has shown strength with his arm
[1:33:15] he has scattered the proud in the
[1:33:16] imagination of their hearts he hath put
[1:33:19] down the mighty from their seats and
[1:33:22] exalted them of low degree
[1:33:24] amen he has filled the hungry with good
[1:33:27] things
[1:33:28] and the rich he has sent empty away what
[1:33:31] a contrast
[1:33:33] amen he had filled the hungry with good
[1:33:35] things i want to ask are you hungry this
[1:33:37] morning
[1:33:38] do you have a need this morning that he
[1:33:39] can fill
[1:33:41] because if you're not hungry you're not
[1:33:42] going to get anything are you amen
[1:33:44] blessed are those that hunger and thirst
[1:33:45] for righteousness
[1:33:47] for they shall be filled if i'm sitting
[1:33:50] up here if i'm standing up here and i
[1:33:52] think i've got it all and i think i'm
[1:33:54] i'm in a in a rapture-ready form and i
[1:33:56] think i'm mr spirituality and stuff
[1:33:58] guess what god can't work with me kenny
[1:34:00] because i'm not hungry i'm not thirsty
[1:34:02] and i'm already i'm in a laodicean
[1:34:04] condition is what i'm in
[1:34:06] right if i'm sitting up here and saying
[1:34:07] i'm rich and increased with goods and
[1:34:08] have need of nothing i'm well clothed
[1:34:10] blah blah blah what is it i'm in a
[1:34:12] laodicean condition but he says what she
[1:34:14] says what he had filled the hungry with
[1:34:16] good things you've got to be hungry for
[1:34:18] the things of god you've got to
[1:34:19] recognize there's more to be had and
[1:34:21] there's a need for you to have more of
[1:34:22] him and then he can come in amen and
[1:34:25] with the rich and the rich he has sent
[1:34:27] empty away he had helped his servant
[1:34:29] israel in remembrance of his mercy
[1:34:32] as he spoke to our fathers to abraham
[1:34:35] and to his seat forever we're a part of
[1:34:37] that royal seat aren't we mary's not
[1:34:39] just speaking to israel now she's
[1:34:41] speaking to all of us write his seed
[1:34:43] forever she's saying you're a part of
[1:34:45] this as well amen it's all about god's
[1:34:46] work that's what this is all about when
[1:34:48] we look at this entire the the
[1:34:50] supernatural birth of jesus it was god
[1:34:52] gave his word of what was going to
[1:34:53] happen and he had one person that was
[1:34:55] ready to take his word at it exactly as
[1:34:58] he spoke it confess it and move forward
[1:35:00] and all of a sudden we have the
[1:35:01] supernatural messiah being born amen
[1:35:04] like i said
[1:35:05] we don't deserve it we can't make it
[1:35:07] happen
[1:35:09] but what we can do is we can what we can
[1:35:11] water it right we can we can set an
[1:35:13] atmosphere for growth can we that's what
[1:35:15] church is all about is an atmosphere for
[1:35:16] growth so that when the unsaved come in
[1:35:19] they realize there's more and that when
[1:35:20] life comes in then it grows a little bit
[1:35:22] taller in that service amen when we
[1:35:24] gather for fellowship when we gather
[1:35:26] together what is it it's to encourage
[1:35:27] one another to draw us up into that like
[1:35:30] precious faith amen to let life come
[1:35:32] forth just a little bit more to get that
[1:35:33] fruit to blossom out amen that's what
[1:35:35] we're looking to happen in our lives but
[1:35:37] there's one thing we can do is when he
[1:35:39] says it you believe it and that gives
[1:35:41] him the opportunity to put on the
[1:35:42] performance of what he said he would do
[1:35:44] amen
[1:35:45] but abraham says now i believe he will
[1:35:47] do it
[1:35:48] he has never failed me yet in all these
[1:35:50] years i believe him
[1:35:53] but you can understand what a challenge
[1:35:55] that is
[1:35:56] brother branham would stand up there
[1:35:57] remember he's over in india and they
[1:35:59] bring over the sun worshiper that had
[1:36:01] his head his eyeballs fried because he
[1:36:03] stared at the sun
[1:36:04] and he said he said can any one of you
[1:36:06] stand here and heal this man
[1:36:08] and nobody could and he gave them time
[1:36:10] to do it he says i have a god that can
[1:36:13] and he prayed for that man and he saw
[1:36:15] and he says
[1:36:16] he says but you can understand what a
[1:36:18] challenge that is
[1:36:19] because every time he stepped behind
[1:36:21] that pulpit he was looking for the
[1:36:22] supernatural and the expectation was
[1:36:25] that the supernatural will follow it's
[1:36:26] mark 16 all over again right he says can
[1:36:29] you imagine what a challenge it is
[1:36:31] because what the worst would come up to
[1:36:32] him and he had to believe that if god
[1:36:34] spoke it it would happen
[1:36:36] right and he had to repeat what god said
[1:36:38] he was when he was in that when he was
[1:36:40] in that channel brother branham didn't
[1:36:41] even know what he was saying half the
[1:36:42] time right he'd say was it true what he
[1:36:45] said he didn't even know it
[1:36:47] but he was a he was a microphone he was
[1:36:49] just repeating what that angel said to
[1:36:51] him time and time again
[1:36:53] can you understand what a challenge it
[1:36:54] is somebody said aren't you afraid
[1:36:57] aren't you afraid that they're going to
[1:36:58] bring up something that god can't heal
[1:37:00] that god can't fix that god can't change
[1:37:03] that god can't redeem
[1:37:05] no sir how can i be afraid and him right
[1:37:08] here
[1:37:09] by me
[1:37:10] amen you've got to believe he's with you
[1:37:12] brothers and sisters you've got to
[1:37:13] believe when he gave you the holy ghost
[1:37:15] that means he's with you he's in you
[1:37:17] every second of every day and he's there
[1:37:19] to fulfill his word in your life
[1:37:22] he says he it's his word
[1:37:26] it's not my word he says it's him it's
[1:37:28] his word
[1:37:30] it's not mine i'm just saying what he
[1:37:32] said and that's my confession confess
[1:37:34] means say the same thing the scripture
[1:37:37] which is god god in letter form the word
[1:37:39] was made flesh and dwelt among us and
[1:37:42] the word still is god
[1:37:44] the word still is god
[1:37:46] prophet's gone prophet's gone the word
[1:37:50] has remained the holy spirit has
[1:37:51] remained and he's what he's dwelling in
[1:37:53] you and in me that's right right the
[1:37:55] only thing that's changed is the
[1:37:56] messenger is gone but the one that was
[1:37:58] behind the messenger the other angel
[1:38:00] remember our pastor keeps saying they
[1:38:01] missed the angel behind him that's the
[1:38:03] one that's still here amen that's the
[1:38:05] one that's still here to take his bride
[1:38:07] off of this earth
[1:38:09] he says the scripture which is god god
[1:38:11] in letter form the word was made flesh
[1:38:13] and dwelt among us and the word still is
[1:38:15] god and the word said he's the same
[1:38:18] yesterday today and forever
[1:38:21] it's up to him to confirm it it's worth
[1:38:24] me to believe it
[1:38:25] now
[1:38:26] you believe it
[1:38:29] i shared this quote in a previous sermon
[1:38:30] but i thought it was a good way to
[1:38:32] finish
[1:38:32] he says where god is
[1:38:34] supernatural takes place
[1:38:37] for he
[1:38:38] is supernatural
[1:38:40] amen let's all stand together if we
[1:38:42] would
[1:38:44] i went a little short this morning i
[1:38:46] wasn't sure if my voice was going to
[1:38:47] hold up i remember just wanted to give a
[1:38:49] bit of a word of encouragement this
[1:38:51] morning as i felt led to do it
[1:38:54] then we're we're in a new year
[1:38:56] and the world is sitting there and
[1:38:58] they're making their new year's
[1:38:59] resolutions and they're vowing to be
[1:39:01] different and they're vowing to be
[1:39:02] better and
[1:39:03] vowing to change and guess what most of
[1:39:06] them don't make it three weeks
[1:39:09] that's that's what they say most of them
[1:39:10] don't get past three weeks with whatever
[1:39:12] they've promised to change amen
[1:39:14] i'd like to challenge you this morning
[1:39:16] not to make a commitment to change
[1:39:18] make a commitment to believe
[1:39:20] amen to let your confession be the
[1:39:23] promises of god as he has spoken them in
[1:39:25] his word don't make stuff up
[1:39:27] don't go looking around for something
[1:39:29] but go to his word mary had a
[1:39:31] supernatural experience and when you
[1:39:32] have that experience when the word is
[1:39:34] quickened to you when the message is
[1:39:35] quickened to you when something says
[1:39:37] that's for you whatever it is
[1:39:39] let this be the year that you believe it
[1:39:41] and you confess it and you say lord i
[1:39:44] believe it i'm looking for your
[1:39:45] performance now amen because there's got
[1:39:47] to be a time he doesn't give a prophecy
[1:39:49] he doesn't give a promise but that if
[1:39:51] you'll believe it he's going to perform
[1:39:52] it amen
[1:39:53] and my request is that we would have a
[1:39:55] year where we believe where we take that
[1:39:56] word and we put it on our lips don't
[1:39:58] just keep it in our minds and then put
[1:40:00] it on our lips let our confession let
[1:40:02] our testimony be lord i believe
[1:40:06] now i'm trusting you to perform what
[1:40:07] you've promised amen
[1:40:09] amen let's just bow our heads together
[1:40:12] heavenly father lord
[1:40:14] well your prophet said that you are
[1:40:16] supernatural and therefore where you are
[1:40:18] the supernatural follows
[1:40:20] and lord the very fact that we can stand
[1:40:22] here this morning and believe your word
[1:40:24] lord that we can confess it shows that
[1:40:26] there's a supernatural life within us
[1:40:28] lord that's calling for something beyond
[1:40:30] us amen but lord we want to lift our
[1:40:32] lives up to you this morning lord we
[1:40:34] want to lift up our weakness and our
[1:40:36] frailty lord our shortcomings lord and
[1:40:39] we want to put them away lord we want to
[1:40:41] put them inside and say lord i believe
[1:40:44] lord i believe your word i believe in
[1:40:46] spite of those weaknesses in spite of
[1:40:48] those shortcomings
[1:40:49] lord we believe regardless of what the
[1:40:51] word says regardless of what symptoms
[1:40:53] say regardless of how things appear lord
[1:40:56] we believe and we're trusting you to
[1:40:57] perform what we have believed because
[1:40:59] you said it and now we're repeating it
[1:41:02] back to you heavenly father lord we pray
[1:41:04] you would encourage your people lord for
[1:41:06] the coming year
[1:41:07] lord things seem to drag on so long with
[1:41:09] this pandemic lord it gets us down so
[1:41:12] often lord it hinders fellowship
[1:41:14] lord it hinders so many things lord but
[1:41:16] we're trusting for a supernatural
[1:41:18] breakthrough in our lives
[1:41:19] lord that our faith would be lifted up
[1:41:21] that as we would be perhaps stuck more
[1:41:23] at home lord that we'd use that time to
[1:41:25] draw closer to you lord that we'd set
[1:41:27] aside the things of this world a little
[1:41:28] more lord that we'd let you come in just
[1:41:31] that little bit greater each and every
[1:41:32] day so that your work could be born in
[1:41:34] our lives a little bit more lord lord we
[1:41:37] know time is short we hold up to our
[1:41:39] lost love loved ones lord those ones
[1:41:41] that haven't given their lives to you
[1:41:43] lord for those unsaved souls or we lift
[1:41:45] them before your throne of grace this
[1:41:46] morning lord we ask your holy spirit to
[1:41:49] go out and bring them into our into our
[1:41:51] midst or we pray that they would come to
[1:41:52] you lord not to a church not to a
[1:41:55] ministry lord that you would drop in
[1:41:57] where they are lord that your word would
[1:41:58] start to take hold and that would bring
[1:42:00] them into fellowship lord we pray
[1:42:03] lord many missing this morning lord sick
[1:42:05] and traveling these different things
[1:42:07] lord we pray your grace to them lord for
[1:42:08] the collins family lord homesick brother
[1:42:10] chad as he travels again lord pray for
[1:42:13] the tumbaya family lord praying that you
[1:42:14] would keep them safe as they go back to
