and your power lord god thank you for your leadership heavenly father thank you for healing and deliverance lord yes lord thank you for opening up your word to us this evening yes lord we are so thankful yes thank you lord we could praise you from the rising of the sun to the going down to the same lord and we not run out of things to thank you for lord for the very breath that we have lord for a sound mind lord for the love that flows out of us lord that you've given inside of our very souls lord we say thank you this evening lord thank you for forgiveness for the shed blood of calvary lord thank you for the promise of salvation lord for our wayward lost ones thank you for the promise lord that we're gonna be lord resurrected and raptured lord from this this this death ridden body that we have lord lord thankful that you've promised us a change lord body soul and spirit lord that will bring us into your presence or where we would live forever and ever and ever with you lord thank you lord for a city where you are the light lord thank you lord that our desire is not to stay here but it's to go to a place where all of these things are so lord they're so unworthy they're so old they're so faded lord they're so worthless to us lord that they can't even stand their lord but we go in your presence lord and that satisfies us and lord tonight we're satisfied to be in your presence lord god lord we're thankful you've brought us here but we're praying lord god that you administer now through the preaching of the word lord this is the main event this is why we come here the prophet said and it's not for me to speak lord but it's to you to speak heavenly father and so lord prepare the ears to hear lord prepare this vessel to transmit your word this evening we pray lord and where we have fallen short lord forgive us we pray for our silly mistakes or for wasted time and energy lord where we've given ourselves to something that doesn't please you lord we pray you forgive us this evening lord draw us a new closer to you we pray now in jesus christ's name we ask it amen and amen thank you musicians i appreciate it and certainly appreciate brother josh stepping up once again it's it's good to see him up here using his gift for all of our benefit not just once in a while but uh really putting his shoulder to the wheel amen certainly appreciating it's no it's no small thing listen when you get up in front of people and and you're expected to perform so often is what it is but it's not about performance it's about humility it's about subjection to the spirit and the leading of god and that takes courage takes bravery and we appreciate it brother josh you know brother bob might make it look easy sometimes and you know as a minister you get up behind somebody experienced and you think boy they just make it look easy but guess what every time they get up there's still got to be that submission and that tenderness to the leading of the holy spirit so it's no light thing and we need to be praying for him that god would bless him in that role that god would that god would make that gift manifest amen for the benefit of the body and that it would just be an anchor point for this church amen that the worship the worship always leads us into his presence it leads us to victory it leads us to deliverance it leads us to so many things and it sets the tone for the entire service amen so we rely on our song leaders to be led by the spirit of god amen and just trusting that's what's happened here this evening and then before we read i want to also thank those that that were at the church camp not just by attending but those that set it up and i know brother paul and sister kim took the the you know the the the main load there for getting things set up and whatnot but by no means were they you know alone it was everybody was helping and i was so pleased to see everybody helping in their own little way whether it was in the kitchen clean up and watching kids and giving breaks to this one and that one it was truly wonderful and i believe it was a wonderful time in the lord we had a very special service there amen i was i was so blessed by that service not in speaking but just the presence of god that was there and and the people came to have church you know to have church and and and that was just it meant a lot to me to see that we don't just put those things aside because we're away somewhere but that we could get in there and have a service as if we were right here and it was a special meetings or something like that that's what it felt like to me and there you know so i appreciate that i appreciate the the people getting in there and taking that seriously and i'm really looking for a blessing amen and we're hoping to do that again next year the lord willing and and maybe expand it just a little bit and and whatnot but we'll talk about that as we get closer but certainly appreciated each one that supported that with their presence their money their time their energy their effort we thank the lord we had a good time and a safe time for all that were there amen amen we're going to read from second corinthians chapter 4 and verse 1 this evening it says therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not it's his mercy we don't faint it's his mercy that keeps us going when others fall behind and fall by the wayside it says but we have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty not walking in craftiness nor handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of god that manifestation of the truth means we're living what we talk about i mean that's what people see is our life amen it's walking the walk not just talking the talk and that's what people take notice of is when you live different not just when you talk different and it pricks their conscience that what's that's what it means their pricks are conscious that our lives lived is what pricks are conscious and makes them stand up and take notice verse 3 says but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost in whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of christ who is the image of god should shine unto him amen our light is not our own amen what he's saying is the light of the gospel of christ is what they see in our lives this is the manifestation of the sons of god it's the very image of god our gospel is the very reflection of god it says for we preach not ourselves but christ jesus the lord and ourselves your servants for jesus sake for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us so you have a beautiful vessel you have a perfect vessel you have a strong vessel and guess what the glory can go to the vessel when it does and handle certain things you say well that vessel's worthy of honor but this honor is given to unworthy vessels it's given to frail vessels amen but it's a treasure nonetheless and he's put it in there for a reason amen and it's so that we don't get proud or high-minded and so that we don't get caught up in our achievements but we recognize that it's what's in us that makes us great not it's us that makes us great in the first place amen if there's any good that comes out of us it's because of the power and the grace of god in our lives it says we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair we are persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed this christian walk is not for wimps it's not for the faint-hearted it's not for the the weak it's not for the double-minded but it's for people that are committed to the walk amen amen we go through a lot as christians it says all will suffer persecution all are going to have a hard time all are going to go through chastisement all are going to go through the ringer they're going to be tested and they're going to be proven amen but it says that we are not destroyed everything we go through it may destroy a lesser person but because we have the seed of god in us it doesn't destroy us always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which live are always delivered unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh he says so then death worketh in us but life in you and we having the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believed and therefore have i spoken we also believe and therefore speak amen god bless you you may have your seats this evening may god bless his word as we've read it amen and we're headed into the final stretch of this series of in his form and with his mind and we've covered the original position of humanity we covered the failure and fall from that position we've covered the the redemptive work of god to make a way back to our position and then in the last few services we've walked through the process of repentance that emptying out that dying to ourselves and then we talked about after that the pouring in of the spirit and the life of god into the true church of god which is the bride of christ amen and we want to take that now a little bit into kind of where the the rubber meets the road and you know after you've done all these things there's an action that follows there's a life that follows behind it and we we want to answer the question that says okay now that i've got the new birth and i'm filled with sealed with the holy spirit now what because that is hardly the end of it all and and so often you know we can get caught up in the idea of getting the holy ghost and then we get it and we don't know what to do with it and so in light of that i want to take a a subtitle this evening of sealed and under subjection and we we read in second corinthians about paul talking about the manifestation of the truth and we covered that manifestation of the sons of god a little bit in the last year when we preached on authority to believe and we kind of came up to a certain point and i backed away from it and we're about to head into there over the next two or three services lord willing and and i want to talk about what it looks like now when you catch that mind of christ and when you're sealed with the holy spirit what happens to your mind and what happens once you get that mind and how that plays out through the rest of the body and i want to start out with a diagram and this is what i had in that that series on authority to believe because what happens when we get the holy spirit is that we do one thing happens and that it settles for once and for all who's in control that's what happens when you get the holy spirit see what happens before this is your soul is an open door and satan can come in and go out and god can come in and out and the influence of the world can go in and out and the influence of the word can go in and out and until it's sealed you have that back and forth and you have that vacillating between the word and the world the word and the world and it goes back and forth and you're never stable you can see the benefits of the word but you're never committed to it and you're never resting on it and there's never a peace about it when you stick with what the word says but once you get the holy spirit once you are part of the new birth you experience a new birth now that soul is sealed right and it's sealed all the way to eternity it's sealed all the way to the day of your redemption amen the day that your body has changed and nothing can change that and so so often what happens is we get the holy ghost and we kind of just take a deep breath and we say that's it i've got it i don't have to worry anymore and you're right you don't have to worry about about it anymore you are sealed all the way to eternity if you die tomorrow if nothing else happened in your life if you died tomorrow having been sealed with the holy spirit you're going to be in heaven and you'll you'll re you've received eternal life and you'll spend eternity with christ okay that that's done and that's wonderful but you'll see when we look at the body that we have three rings we have three three three uh you know uh kingdoms if you will within the body and the holy spirit when you're sealed only seals the first one and so you're living in this body that's got two other realms and yet your holy s the holy spirit really only has control over one of them and the goal now is to get it now to move out and flow out of your life so that it can what push out the nature that is with this carnal flesh it can push out the influence of the world and the things of the world and it can start to bring your body and your mind and your your spirit into subjection so that god can use you in a more in a greater way if we could put it that way amen amen the new birth ensures that god has the final say in your life maybe not the first time because sometimes the outer the outer man and sometimes satan will get in there and he'll he'll get you to change your mind but the point is that when it's all said and done you'll come back to the word because that's what you're living by that's what you're resting on it's a part of you now it's not just it comes and goes but it's there until the day that you leave amen it's never going to leave you now the prophet of god said this he says when god made man he made him thus for he made this little certain compartment in the man for his own throne his control tower he said god wants to lead man but man wants to lead himself women want to lead themselves too amen let's not only focus on the men this is this is not specific to men humanity mankind wants to lead themselves and he says therefore there is a war what until you're saved until you get the new birth no he says therefore there is a war how long constantly every day of your life you're going to fight something because what the outer man wants to lead itself and the inner man wants to let the holy spirit lead and so you've got a war inside your body he says man wants to go after what he sees with his eyes and that's where he's deceived that's where satan deceived eve by what she could see the fruit was pleasant to the eye but it was death to the soul so it is tonight he says god wants to lead man so he made himself a little control tower in the midst of his heart which is the nature of the soul so that man would be led by the spirit of god he says getting off on his own leading is what separated him from his fellowship looking what he could see with his eyes so the new birth does not seal the inner five senses of your spirit realm it doesn't seal your imagination your conscience your memory your reason and your affection and so those are open to use and attack by satan it does not seal those things out amen why because that's not where god resides god doesn't reside in your imagination your conscience your memory your reason and affection that's not where he lives now he can use those and we'll get into that in a little bit but it's not where he lives he lives in the heart which is the nature of the soul the sealed off portion is where god is now the prophet of god says but that's where he stands yet tonight who the man under his own leadership he says all those who are led by such things the scripture says that sons and daughters of god are led by the spirit of god but he says this man that's led by his own leadership he says your emotions is your control he says and you can notice a man or woman that tries to walk after the things of the world they can never please god amen never please god not occasionally never please god even so much and i mention the scripture all the time it says in that day they'll come to him and say didn't we do all these things in your name and he says depart from me your workers of iniquity i never knew you even though they did spiritual things in the name of jesus christ yet they could not please god amen he says but a man or a woman that will not look at the things of the world but just go according to the leading of the spirit they're usually in the will of god now you say how can they be usually if they're led by the spirit of god because your motive and your objectives still play into it and then you can do the right thing the wrong way with the wrong motive or objective and be out of the will of god your action is right but the reason you're doing it is still wrong and therefore you're not perfectly in the will of god your leadership is right but you haven't surrendered yourself to the leading of god completely he says that is the great fight tonight satan took the eye a man's head to control him by his head and god took his heart so you'll remember we had this we had the soul and the spirit and we said that the mind is the gate between the soul and the spirit that your mind brother brown would said you have to let your mind believe to accept the word of god and then it can flow out of your soul which is where the word is and it can now come into your spirit and your body and have an effect so the mind being the gate between the soul and the spirit that controls what what influence your spirit is now going to be under the soul sealed so it can't go in but it can allow things out and the goal is to let things come out of your soul through your mind and into your spirit rather than let things try and come in from your spirit into your soul and brother braham says this is the greatest battle ever fought is for the control of your mind because satan has taken your mind and god has taken your soul but satan if he can control your mind will block faith will block the effect of the word for manifesting in your life and in your relationships and in your in your entire your entire being if we could put it that way right so the new birth doesn't seal this out and if you're hoping for a time that this is going to be sealed then good luck the prophet of god says we battle constantly in this realm it is always going to be a fight and that's why i talk about that this is not this is not something that's going to be sealed but this is something we see that the scripture says is in subjection amen that it is subject to something that is under an authority that keeps it in check and commits it to do what that higher authority says and that's what we're looking for is to bring our our spirit realm and our body realm now into subjection to the to the will and the purpose of god which is always what his word it's always his word it's going to go under his word now brother brown's talking about the greatest battle ever fought and he said see his attack satan's attack his attack is what disbelieve god's word that's his attack there can you see the greatest battle was ever fought there's only two forces satan and god there is no neutral party there's god and there's everything else he says and what is satan's weapon against you it's to try to get you to disbelieve your weapon and notice he puts a capital w on the weapon why because the weapon of god is the word of god he says he disarms you let's listen real quiet now listen if he can get you to disbelieve your weapon is equivalent if he gets you to believe your weapon is not strong enough he has disarmed you look he's disarmed you when he gets you to disbelieve that weapon when you lay that down that finishes your fight you're done so he says hold that weapon don't you lay it down that's what i've said so many times before if all you have is one scripture use that scripture guess what brother branham said that the word of god will defeat satan any place any time if you take the word of god and you stick with it and you use it it will always win just don't forget it's not always when you want it to win amen it is a battle it's going to go on for some time many times amen hold your weapon he says don't lay it down now those inner five senses are controlled by your mind your imagination conscience memory affection and reason and these things they're all controlled by your mind so if your mind can take on the mind of christ rather than the mind of the world then now you've got the opportunity to bring your spirit realm into subjection amen now satan you would say well why doesn't he use that spirit realm why does he grab the mind why doesn't he use the outer senses as his primary weapon because brother brahm didn't say he used the five outer senses he says he uses the five inner senses why because look if there's something wrong in front of my eyes i can close my eyes i can walk away and satan can't bring that into my house satan can't make me see something i don't want to see listen if the music that's playing is wrong i can turn it off i can get myself out of that situation satan can't force me to drink alcohol or take drugs satan can't force me to touch and do things that i don't want to do but guess what i can't stop his thoughts from coming in amen i can't stop my imagination from working i can't forget memories so if satan can get in there he can work on me 24 hours a day seven days a week 365 days a year it's an all access pass to jonathan curlette is my mind which is why he picked it it gives him access no matter what i can't turn my mind off so satan is always working in there and he's always battling to try and get your attention trying to influence you to get you to do something that the word says you're not going to do amen we've been preaching that we're to take the battle of christ or the mind of christ and another way of saying that is that your natural mind is supposed to lose its battle with the holy spirit that's what we're talking about is when your natural mind is so overwhelmed by the word coming out of you by the leadership and the influence of the holy spirit in your life that you lay aside your natural way of thinking that's when you take on the mind of christ when what it is controlled by the life of god when it is controlled by the word of god when it is controlled by the spirit of god that's when you've taken on the mind of christ and so what you'll find is you're going to have the mind of christ at certain times in certain areas of your life we don't have it all right now i don't think any one of us could look at our lives and say i have the mind of christ in every area we said that would be our confession and that would be our profession but we would say that we're still struggling in certain areas wouldn't we absolutely uh i am at least me and brother joe we got a couple more there we go brother paul as well praise the lord but what it's a constant battle and that means that there's going to be back and forth there's going to be days where you'll win and there's going to be days where you lose amen but that doesn't mean you've lost the the war just means you might have lost that battle and you need to keep that now under prayer and you've got to get yourself built up in the most holy faith amen but we're trying to bring it now under subjection to the word of god and we read this in the last couple of services in romans it says and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind your mind has to be renewed to get the transformation to work its way through the rest of your body and then your soul doesn't need a renewing it gets a new birth i mean there's a new birth that happens that's a new creature but he says the rest of what you've got comes into a renewal now it brings you back to the way you used to think guess what you didn't used to think like the way you think now your natural inclination used to be that you would obey the word of god as a son and daughter of god if you were born the way you were supposed to be born in a time and in a you know the way adam and eve were you would naturally follow the word of god and you know what we still have the a bit remaining in our life that reminds us of that and it's called a conscience it's one of the things that sets us aside from the animals is that we will do things that are contrary to our very survival for the sake of right and wrong you know what it is that's the rem the remnants of what your mind used to be like your conscience is the remnants of what it was supposed to be like that you would do what was right no matter what but now we can override our conscience of course we see it going all around the world but says be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god amen but paul is pointing us back to this idea of the new birth that after the new birth there's a battle that starts and it continues and it's going to keep going on and on and on until we come very close to that resurrection in that rapture now this is just me this is thus saith brother john i believe at the end he'll be completely shut out amen i believe that that when the bride is in unity when we've come into full maturity that just like satan is bound by chains of circumstance in the millennial reign where he has nobody to work in i believe that's going to be his position in the bride he has nobody to work with they will be so sold out they will be so sealed body soul and spirit that he can't get them to do anything doesn't mean he won't try but he will not have success in that pride i believe she'll rise above it all amen and that and just before we go then there'll be that quick short work and he will be completely powerless to work in our lives we won't have any time we won't have any conversations there'll be nothing left for him to do but just stand outside in frustration and pound on the door and hope that we open it up that's me that's me amen i believe that we're going to be completely victorious before we leave here amen but brother branham said that satan's tactics were to get us to believe that our weapon the word of god is not equal to his weapon now what does satan use to get us to disbelieve our weapon two things doubt and fear and what he does the way he does that is he magnifies the things that we see hear feel remember you know your inner senses and your five outer senses all of these things and he takes what is the information that's fed into those and he magnifies it to cause you to think that it's greater than what it actually is amen right fear is only what a concern of the unknown it isn't guaranteed it's not proven but you're worried about what might be which when you think about it is the silliest thing to get worked up about what might be now what it what it is is a natural instinct it's something that's built into us so that we recognize things that are happening we make a a calculation say it's possible or probable that this will happen and so we can make up a plan to get away to stay safe back in you know the prehistoric days you know when a lion was going around if you heard a lion roar you went someplace safe you didn't sit around until you heard until you saw the line in front of you right that's a preservation instinct and that's what these things are that fear was supposed to preserve your life but now satan's doing it to keep you from preserving your life amen from giving your life over to something else he wants you to fear what's going to happen so that it keeps you away from the promises of god right he's trying to get you to doubt that the word is sufficient to handle what you're dealing with in your life in your body and your mind and your soul and your spirit wherever it might be he's trying to get you to doubt that if you trust the word it'll take care of the situation i love it i was talking to brother garfield here a while ago and he says i don't he said something he said i don't worry about what's coming out necessarily he says as long as the word is being preached and as long as the word has been put into my life it will have the effect when it needs to have the effect i thought that was pretty pretty amazing to say that because we trust what the long work right we trust the process we don't just we're we're not creatures of uh of right now my way my time but we trust the process that it will do what god has sent it forth to do in our lives second corinthians 10 says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh so other words although we live in a carnal world and in a carnal body we don't fight flesh with our natural weapons right there's a different weapon there's a different set of weapons that's given to us it won't work and it never will work never has never will he says for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strongholds so let me say this if you have a stronghold that's not a problem because we've been given a promise and a weapon that will tear it down don't worry if you have the stronghold worry do you have the weapon that will take it down that's what the christian needs to know do i have the right weapon in my hand to tear the stronghold down in my life what do those weapons do they cast down what are those strongholds what do they look like casting down imaginations and every high thing every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought every thought to the obedience of christ now he says exalting itself against the knowledge of god the knowledge of god is by revelation through experience it is not intellectual it is not just by hearing but it is by living it is a word express coming out of you that's the knowledge of god is when you have tasted and seen that the lord is good not that just you have heard it but you know it because you've experienced it that's the knowledge of god and it says the weapons that we have will say i've got a reality so you can't tell me it's not real i've seen the effect of the word so don't tell me that this word won't work again amen the greatest revelation you can have is the first time you trust god's word and it does exactly what it said then you know that it'll do it the next time and the next time and the next time and all of a sudden you're walking by faith and not by sight amen amen what is it satan's trying to what use our mind as a tool to make things that aren't real appear as real guess what the word of god does the exact same thing what abraham called those things which were not as though they were the difference is that god's promise isn't associated with fear and doubt it's associated with healing it's associated with peace rest love joy all of these different things amen so let me ask you if what's happening to you is causing you to fear then it cannot be the influence of god in your life it'll never bring that amen amen we are children of abraham and we call those things as not as though they were by the word by the word amen we believe and therefore we speak as we read in the first scripture amen second timothy 1 7 says for god had not given us the spirit of fear if you're scared it is not the anointing of god unless it is what a holy fear a holy reverence a holy respect for the things of god if that fear drives you to the word then it's god but it's driving you away from the word of god then you know that it's a satanic influence every single time he says what he has not given us a spirit of fear but a power of love and of a sound mind amen so when you're walking through life what is your response is it fear satanic is it love it's god amen is it panic panic is never of god you never have to make a quick decision that takes you out of the will of god you can always rest you can always wait there's no reason to panic there's never a reason to panic there's never a reason to have to make a snap decision without consulting the lord there's no reason for it amen what is it satan is taking those things that aren't real and he's magnifying them to try and get you to panic right to doubt to worry to fear to get caught up in what it looks like rather than sitting back and saying what is this really and more importantly what does the word of god say it is because if satan's magnifying it he's going to try to turn it into something that you can't overcome or you haven't ever overcome and you're going to sit there and say now what do i do now what do i do how do i take this one down the word of god every single time amen i remember we read that quote in where brother bram says when the enemy comes in like the flood like a flood the spirit of god will raise up a standard and he says the raising of a standard is god pouring his spirit into your life i love that it's become it's it's become my creed i think for 2022 is when things rise up look for more of god to be poured into you ask for more of the holy spirit ask god to raise a standard in your life to what holds you steady though the flood rises up against you at the same time amen to not allow you to step back to not force you to make a panic decision to not make you react with your emotions to not react with your your memory and your conscience in these different things amen when our emotions get strong what puts it pushes it back the holy spirit that says what does the word say amen when we get offended what pushes that offense back and says is this really worth getting all up in arms about the holy spirit right when our memory takes us places where we ought not to have been what pushes it back the holy spirit that says that's under the blood amen when our conscience is bothering us then what is it that takes us back into the presence of god it's what it's reminding us of the finished work of calvary amen satan magnifies those things and all you have to look at the word and say the word already addressed this i don't even have to talk to you about it satan i don't have to worry about it because the word already says i'm free i'm delivered i'm clean spotless i'm already raptured and resurrected brother gerald amen amen i'm already a finished work in his eyes the filter he's looking at me through is the blood of christ and that makes me look perfect to him amen satan's the biggest magnifier there is amen but it's a false magnification because he's trying to get you to think that the word won't handle your situation amen that's why we've got to keep our fires lit you know what if you're cold starchy if you're formal that'll work every single time because you've got nothing to fight with you've got no life within you to raise up and then you've got to go to god maybe you'll finally remember and say oh god you actually you can help me can't you pour your spirit in show me your word give me a give me a scripture to take me through this trial in this situation but if your fire is not lit if you're not on fire for god then you're going to face some real difficulty when these trials come up aren't they because the magnification of the world will be greater than the experience you had with god today or yesterday or last week or last month amen read your bible and pray that's how you keep your fires lit amen every day we're fighting as we read in second corinthians amen to cast down imaginations to not get caught up in the appearance of things and men do not get scared or offended that's a big deal these days you know as the church gets bigger and i pray the lord will bless us and break make it bigger guess what more opportunities for offenses will come up more opportunities for friction and guess what satan wants you to take those and use it to move away move away meaning separate yourself from fellowship to cause yourself to look down your nose at a brother or sister that did something you didn't think they ought to have done amen pain and panic are what causes animals to die in the wild pack animals i'm talking about herd animals if the sheep will stay together even sheep as helpless as they are they're very difficult for the wolves to get into but if they can get one to run away they'll take that down every time and guess what the biggest animals can be taken down if they get away from the protection of the herd amen scattering the sheep that's the tactic of wolves and lions that's the two things we're warned against satan goes around as a roaring lion and then we heard about it in the in the message the other day from brother jared where he talked about what those wolves from amongst you that try and separate the people out and draw people to themselves rather than point them to the word what is it satan can get you alone he's got you beat and you won't even know he's eating you that's the sad part is you won't even know you're defeated because he's picked you off and you've gotten away from what the umbrella of the authority of the word and the gathering yourselves together and you're hooped and you don't even know it and then you wonder why your life feels pointless and lonely and you get depressed and you get worried and you get more and more prickly in these different things why it's because you're out from under the umbrella of the word that's what happens he gets you by yourself you become a law to yourself and you become a denomination amen but our goal once let me say this you know what happens when satan gets you out you say well he let me out he's going to keep leading me you know what satan does he lets you lead yourself you become a law unto yourself you start to lead yourself and satan doesn't have to even touch you because any leadership that's not of god is satanic by its definition because there's only two sides there's only god and satan so if you're not led by god whether it's yourself or anyone else you are under satanic leadership satan doesn't even need to lead you he just leaves you to yourself and you'll follow your own lusts your own desires your own preferences your own ideas and you'll lead yourself straight into the desert and die that's what happens amen amen but our goal once we have the holy spirit is to let it apply the word by faith through our mind and now bring these things that are in our spirit realm under subjection to the holy spirit that's what the renewing of the mind is it takes us back to the leadership of god remember brother brown said in we've read the quote many times where he says that in the original creation that man was led by the holy spirit and he led the animals by that same spirit it was under the leadership of god that that man ruled and reigned on this earth amen so like i said before the spirit realm is not sealed like the soul but it becomes to a place where it's under the control of the holy spirit and that's what we're looking for is where there's enough of a fountain of life there's enough of a fountain of the word inside of us that it's pushing out and it's starting to influence that spirit realm amen so what happens now is when we come to this place it looks a little bit like this so you have your soul that's sealed by the holy spirit and then with that and remember this was from authority to believe but you catch what the will of god and that gives you faith to do what god wants you to do in the word and so it kicks out doubt and now it starts to press out into the spirit realm so now it starts to take over your imagination so now it starts to take over your conscience your memory your reason your affection you say well what does that even look like what does that look like when you're when your imagination is under the influence of the holy spirit now you can imagine yourself healed instead of sitting there with a degenerative disease for the rest of your life that's what it looks like your imagination now will take you to the promises of god rather than the depression of where you're sitting right now today in your current condition amen what will it do your memory when it's under the influence of the holy spirit will not remember what your brother or sister did to you but it will remember the shed blood of calvary that forgave you and asks you to forgive them the same way amen that it will cleanse your conscience so that instead of driving you away from the presence of god it drives you into the presence of god and it draws you near to him rather than pushes you away from it that's how you know when he's working in you is that it starts to drive you to looking at things the way god looks at them and looking at them through the filter of the word rather than filter them through your own carnal realities amen that it starts to put the word out there and says i'm going to choose to look at situations i'm going to choose to look at people through the promises and the realities of the word rather than what i've experienced in my carnal flesh that's how you know that that's what's happening inside of your life amen that's what we're trying to get to because if that mind can get opened up by faith to the word of god and it starts to push out all of a sudden now satan is he becomes really powerless really quickly in your life because the mind is his stronghold that's where he loves to hang out and when the word is flowing through there and it's pushing one way through that door he can't set up a camp there he can't get in there and hold on to you he can't get his talons into your mind there and so what happens is you start to push out all these things that have held you back through your life i remember i was in a a a men's meeting one time and and a brother asked he said we're dealing you know we're we're married men and we're dealing with situations in our homes and we're dealing with situations in our lives he says and everybody says get the holy spirit he says but he says can you give me something practical that'll help me and the answer is no there is nothing practical that will actually help you aside from the holy spirit that's why you need a new birth the new birth is the victory that's what we're looking for is victory and the new birth is the victory it's the holy spirit inside of you that's the one that's going to take you all the way so you can sit here and yes i can give you principles day after day but guess what until it's until it starts flowing from the inside out it's never going to stick it's never going to really take effect it's never going to push satan out it's just going to temporarily get you some respite until what he builds up another flood and comes in and washes away every principle you've had and you panic and you go out and do the same thing you've always done why because you haven't been settled inside the scripture says a double-minded man is unstable in all of his ways why because he hasn't been convinced he hasn't been converted he hasn't been converted and so he vacillates back and forth word world word world and he's going back and forth and guess what that's a man that can only take principles of the word because the word isn't inside of him all he's taking is the knowledge of the word rather than what the knowledge of christ which is of revelation by experience he's just taking it as good ideas as as something i can apply to my life rather than something that is my life right and then something from the inside out it's a wellspring inside of us that's coming out otherwise it's going to come in the opposite way and anything that comes in from the outside can be pushed out but if it's living and anchored and sealed on the inside nothing can take it away and you'll always come back to it that's why you've got to get the inside seal that's why we don't tell it we don't force our kids to do certain things that's why we're not legalistic about it that we give them grace to grow and learn is because if it doesn't happen naturally then it's never going to stick anyways god's got to deal with them as sons and daughters the same way he did with us and it's a maturing and a growing process in their lives amen so instead of being influenced from the outside now we're being influenced and controlled from what's on the very inside of you that cannot be touched that cannot be removed that cannot be depleted the only thing that's limiting us is how much we'll let it come out amen and brother branham teaches us he says that is the mind that's controlling that and that's why satan's kept out there because if he can choke that mind down so that only a little bit of faith comes through he says he's got you beat most of the time but if you can get that opened up under what the preaching of the word right that's what gives us faith there's only one way you get faith and that's by the preaching of the word by the hearing of the word let me say it that way the hearing of the word right whether it's me whether it's brother jail whether it's brother branham whether it's some other preacher under the hearing of the word that's what's going to open up the channels and flow those out brother donny reagan just preached down to brother ron spencer's one on on on unclogging the pipes it's a good one to listen to if you're dealing with things in your life amen that you've got to let something come in and clean up the pipes many times and he talked about it he said even myself he says we've got things that just get clogged up in time because we let them linger right because we haven't let the word flow through it it's a good message if you're looking for something to listen to in the next while amen but once you get that mind of christ once that's anchored there when you push satan out of that when the word is flowing the first thing it's going to do is it's going to confirm your position that's the first thing the mind of christ will do will confirm your position we get that from the word in john 5. it says then answered jesus and said unto them verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for whatsoever things he doeth these also do with the sun likewise we're looking into the mind of christ here and he says i don't do or see or i don't wh what i do or or or or say i do because i see it because i'm told to do it he says i don't do this of myself i don't come up with this with my own ideas jesus didn't say i take the word and i apply it the way i want it to he said no whatever god shows me to do that's what i do he was under an influence amen and he wouldn't do it unless that influence told him what to do but watch what happens when he says this we're talking about the mind of christ will confirm your position it says therefore the jews sought the more to kill him because he had not only broken the sabbath but said also that god was his father making himself keep self-equal with god i hadn't seen this until i i was putting this together in study because jesus said god is my father and they kill it they tried to kill him because he said god is my father why scripture says because they said they made himself equal with god how does that make him equal with god god is my father do you believe god is your father you're under the same condemnation then from the world then from the religious world because what happens is when you say god is your father what does that make you makes you a son of and what is a son of god it's a god they said when you say your father is a god that makes you a god and they said you're not allowed to do that but guess what god's birth gods god's father gods they don't father demigods they don't uh many god no no they father gods the seed of god is a god amen that's what we're talking about here of in his form and with his mind is the very god inside of christ living out of you you are no less of a god if you want to put it that way by your bloodline than jesus christ was we're talking about the inner man now not this body and we don't get to display it the way jesus did because we're not in sinless flesh but by by birthright by bloodline we are no different than jesus christ himself that'll choke a denominational believer when you say i am no different than christ the priest said what scripture says that jesus thought it not robbery to be equal with god why because he came from god and he goes to god you come from god and you go to god what you are a part of him you are a god in the way that he is god not the fullness but you are of his line in lineage you are a god that's what we're talking about we see the same the priest said that about him and they made it blasphemy instead of revelation the revelation they needed they turned into blasphemy and tried to kill him for it that's an amazing thing because this is where we need to get this is where we need to get this is the recognition we need to have is that when you are a son or a daughter of god there's a there there is a position that comes with that there is a recognition that comes with that there is a there is a placing that comes with that that is different than everybody else in the world and they can't take it away and you couldn't change it if you wanted to if god has called you because you are his child then you are going to sit in heavenly places you are sitting in heavenly places you will rule and reign with him you are heirs and joint heirs i believe we're going to read it here in a moment amen what is it jesus being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god in your mind you've got to recognize that when you take on the mind of christ the first thing it tells you you are a son and a daughter of god it confirms your position back to you amen what is it shows you who your daddy is my daddy is not lanny corlett my daddy is father god the almighty one the everlasting one jehovah god that's my father and when i recognize that fully it'll change me in a way that i haven't been changed yet we're still coming into that remember we read the scripture where it says we see through a glass darkly now we see bits and pieces we see shapes and shadows of it we we see elements of it but we don't see the full picture but there's going to come a day and we read the quote i believe in the last few services where it says when the by recognizes who she is then what the rapture will go there's a further recognition that we have to have in our life amen amen the thing it does is it takes us out of what bragging or worrying about who our natural family is too because what we're focused now on our heavenly father not on our natural father so guess what my father shame won't hold me down and my father's amazingness won't lift me up because i'm looking to my heavenly father amen that's what makes us all equal in here is that we come from the same daddy amen that's why brother brown said something along the lines of and this is i'm not don't have a direct quote but he says the people and this may not even be a quote it may have been something he said i didn't look it up i couldn't find it but it's something along the lines of that peep the people that say that i am god are closer to the truth than those that say i'm not remember we read that quote where he says what happened when he got the new birth was he said i recognized i was no longer the son of charles and ella branham right what he said i am what a son of god amen so that's it's closer to for somebody to call you the that you are a son of god than to say that you're a god than to say that you are not because you're in his likeness and in his image and with his life that makes you as close to a god as you could ever imagine isn't it without actually being his person amen the very original you know the the origin of god if we could put it that way amen what was he saying he say i come from god and god produces other gods so don't go so far to the left that you miss the revelation that's right in the middle of the road amen that you are a son or a daughter of god and that puts you in a very elite position not to lift you up but to restore you back romans 8 says but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you now we like to put that to the future don't we that's going to be the resurrection and the rapture but remember you had he quickened right now who are dead in trespasses and sins you're already quick and you're already made alive your natural body is being what brought into subjection and being glorified even as we sit here tonight it is bringing us to a place where the full expression of god in your life can come forth out of what this fallen body even that it can bring it to a place where it is so under subjection where it is so beaten down where it is so powerless that god can do exactly what he wants to do in each and every one of our lives as men what is it it says it will quicken it it will make it live now don't put it in the future it needs to happen now we want to be quick and today you have been quickened today you're sitting here because you've been quickened but i want to be more quick and amen that they might live and have it what more abundantly that's what i'm seeking he says therefore dead brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh in other words he says we owe the flesh nothing it's done nothing for us so let's not cater to it let's not think we've got to do certain things because it's our body no we don't we don't live the lives we live by the strength of our body right it's not the fact that i go to the gym that makes me strong amen it's the blessing of god in my life that makes me strong that keeps me alive that keeps me healthy he says for if you live after the flesh you shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body you shall live remember the scripture says there's a way that seemeth right to a man and the way thereof is death right he says if you're going to live after the flesh if you're going to live after the way your natural natural mind thinks if you're going to go the way your natural spirit realm goes you're going to die because it will not lead you to god it will not lead you to eternity it will not change you you're in a fallen condition and guess what you can't make yourself better right that's why you've got to die he says but if we mortify the deeds of the flesh we live if we will kill what this earth with this body is trying to do if we will kill what this spirit's trying to do he says that's when we're going to live amen listen paul was a spiritually minded priest doing what he thought was the absolute will of god and he was under an antichrist spirit persecuting the true church that can happen to a message believer is what i'm saying you can sit under the right word the right message of the hour the right teaching and it can take you completely wrong if you haven't what mortified the deeds of the flesh if the new birth has not taken effect in your life amen verse 14 says for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god that's the defining attribute of a son or daughter of god is that they are led by the spirit of god that's why we go back to that scripture lord lord did not we do this and that in your name he says get away from me i never knew you you workers of iniquity i told you what to do and you didn't do it you denied the leadership of the holy spirit and so you went your own way and nothing you did was for the kingdom of god not saying god couldn't get some glory out of it but it was not in his will or purpose and therefore it did nothing to support what his perfect will and his perfect plan for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear again to fear you were under a spirit of bondage right we didn't realize it but we are under a spirit of bondage and when you get the new birth you start to realize wow i was really tied down and even after the new birth you realize there's change that need to be broken right there's habits there's friendships there's influences there's things you do places you go people you spend time with that need to be pulled away from your life but he says we do have not received the spirit of bondage again this does not tie us down paul called himself he says i'm a prisoner of christ didn't he so there's a bondage there if you want to talk about it but it is not a bondage to fear which is what we were under last time amen it says but ye have received the spirit of adoption adoption the placing of a son right a place of trust a place of recognition a place of purpose a place with power and authority he says you've received a spirit of that whereby we cry abba father what's that word abomine daddy it's the colloquial version of father it's the familiar it's daddy dada papa papa god daddy father what happens when a child is scared where do they go daddy they don't go to father they go to daddy don't they they go to mama right it's familial it's close it's a there's a relationship that's tither and he says that's what you have even in adoption he's still papa god to you he's still someone you can come to that can be comforted by him that can be strengthened by him that can get their needs met by him amen he says and if children so many says we've received us that the spirit bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of god and if children then heirs then heirs are you an heir if there's nothing to inherit no there's something waiting for you if you're an heir there's something that's set aside there's a treasure built up there's money there's property there's position whatever it might be there's something waiting for you if you're an heir there's something that's given for you to inherit he says and if heirs of god then and joint heirs with christ he says so not just heirs but you are joint heirs with christ he puts you at the same level the same position as christ himself amen that's what we're talking about here your position the first thing the mind of christ will do is take you to your position and show you who and what you are maybe not in its fullness but it'll get you walking down the path to that full revelation of it he says if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together we are not going to be heirs we are heirs we are not going to be joint heirs with christ we are joint dares with christ amen we are now the children of god and all we this message is trying to do is get us to hear it believe it and act on it that's all god's trying to do get us to accept the simplicity of this message that you are children of god you are called for a purpose and it's to manifest the light and the gospel of god to a dying age before you go in a rapture that's it now there's a lot in there and there's a big process to get you through but that's what it's that's the simplicity of this message amen the first thing jesus recognized as a child was who he was before he did any miracles before he went out and amazed the world before he ever took those things on himself what had happened he was at the temple remember in his ma and mary and joseph left him there and they traveled a couple days away realized he wasn't in the caravan they came back and he was scolded by mary and she said your father and i were worried and he said don't you know that i must be about my father's business 12 years old in the temple and he knows he's the son of god first revelation jesus christ ever had was that he was the son of god that we know of and it's not a rebuke to her he's just letting her know i know who i am and there's a work for me and this is where it starts but i want you to catch this he was only 12 years old he didn't start his ministry till much later and it brings me to the principle that knowing your position does not mean you're in the right condition okay knowing you're a son of god knowing you're a daughter of god does not mean you're ready to go out there and handle the word in every way that you think you might why because you've got to be grown and matured into it i believe i'm a son of god there are things i wouldn't even dare to touch in this word yet because why it takes it takes a greater humility it creates a takes a greater subjection it takes a greater sanctification it takes a greater maturity it takes a greater setting aside and so god's got to bring those things into my life there's a process to those things amen the word of god reminds us that the air the air as long as he is a child different nothing from a servant though he be lord of all what's he saying your position is not reflective of your condition and in a way i thank god for that that he still calls me a son even though maybe i don't look like a son at all times but what until the time that he calls me son i'm under what tutors and teachers to bring me to that place and he says he's given us the holy spirit to be what a tutor and a teacher and then to bring us to the place where he can now put us into a position of authority where we can do something for the kingdom of god amen we read that quote a little while ago where brother braham said babies are not born men they're born babies and they grow to men he said it's no different for christians the new birth does not make you what a mature believer it just makes you a christian that's going to grow into a mature believer watch how jesus progressed listen you don't have to take my word for it look at what jesus actually had to go through luke 2 51 says and this is after he left um the after he left the temple he went back with him and the scripture says and he went down with them and came to nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart and jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and men listen this is god in flesh this is the godhead bodily this is the fullness and the image of god in flesh and it says that he had to be subject to someone and that in doing so he increased in wisdom in reputation and that he got favor with god and man jesus went from here to here he was not born the son of god and went to here he matured and he grew into that and it took him 30 years to get there to where god said you're now ready for my work and then what happened is what jesus comes to the river he talks to john he says i have to be baptized and the holy spirit comes down says what this is my beloved son he never said it before then but when god tells you when god announces it that's when you're ready to go and until he announces it there's no point in pretending there's no point in trying there's no no point in trying to being something you're not why because he hasn't called you and made you that yet you're still under training you're still under tutoring amen you can always testify you can always worship and praise amen but you can't do a work for god until he says you're ready to do it right but you're always called to testify your life is supposed to always testify amen but you're not going to do a specific work until god says you're ready my son you're ready my daughter you've proven yourself now i'm going to give you some responsibility and we'll see how you handle that and if you can handle that i'll give you a bit more and a bit more and a bit more and a bit more amen romans 8 5 says for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life it's not just life life and peace because the carnal mind is an enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can it be so taking on the mind of christ it takes us out of what enmity with god it takes out of being counter against in opposition to the things of god there's got to be a renewing that happens there to take us to the place where he can now flow through us as opposed to fight us like a cheese grater all the way through right where the flesh is just fighting the whole way through but when that natural mind is given aside so that the holy spirit can flow through it the mind of christ can come in now it puts us into alignment and makes us allies and co-workers instead of enemies instead of thorns and brambles something that's going to hold up walls that are built up in front of the will in the word of god amen first peter 4 says for as much then as christ has suffered for us suffered for us in the flesh arm yourselves likewise with the same mind for he that had suffered in the flesh had ceased from sin that tells you a life of ease and luxury is not for the believer doesn't it there has to be a suffering in the flesh not that we turn things down there's nothing in the scripture says you have to be poor and miserable but you're going to face challenges amen you're going to face struggles you're going to face trials it's not always going to be everything looking good and easy where you have all the money in the bank you need you have all the health that you you want where your relationships are great your marriage is fantastic your kids are perfect no no no there's going to be a suffering in the flesh because god's going to put you into a choice where you pick one of those or you pick his will and when you pick his will and his word then those are going to suffer and that's going to cause your flesh to hurt amen the way of god is never going to make your flesh feel good up front there's always going to be a struggle there it says that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men but to the will of god peter's showing us what a mind and subjection to god looks like and it's focused on the will of god not the feel-good desires of the flesh very simple very simple if you're doing it because you're you're going to feel good when you do it because your body wants it because your your ego wants it and these different things you're never going to be found in the will of god it's enmity against the will of god ephesians 4 says that ye put off concerning the former conversation so it says that you put off concerning your former life the way of spending your time put off that way of the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind notice he doesn't say mind but he says the spirit of your mind because what your mind is under the control of the spirit right it's under a subjection to something and the desire is that it comes under that of the holy spirit not of a satanic influence amen but what's he saying peter's saying get back to the right spirit in your mind bring it back to the place where adam was and that's going to take you all the way through that's how you get back in your position as you follow the leadership of the one that held you in that position in the first place he says and that you put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness so paul takes us now all the way to his logical conclusion we've read a bunch of scriptures this evening and he's what's saying don't stop with just the holy spirit but let the holy spirit have a work in your life and in your mind and then don't just stop with the renewing of your mind but take it until you can declare like paul did in this verse he said for who had known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him then he says but we have the mind of christ amen right we have it he said there's people that have heeded my words my words and peter's words they've they've taken this and they've allowed the holy spirit to work in their lives so that they could say we have the mind of christ now brother branham said in many places that prayer is the most powerful weapon god's given the believer he also said love is he also said many things were and i'm not saying that to confuse you but i'm saying that prayer is right up there when it comes to a powerful weapon but i want to talk about that a bit but when i was looking for that phrase uh you know the the greatest weapon this quote jumped out at me and it's it's maybe not particularly in the vein of the service but i wanted to throw it in there because it it was so good and i wanted to share with the church and send the message here you him he says the greatest weapon this is a summary in my mind the greatest weapon was ever put in the hands of man is the bible to be backed up with the holy ghost that christ died at calvary to free his church from superstitions and fear and doubt and trembling he lives today he rose from the dead and he's alive tonight he says hear ye him amen that's a powerful thing if you can recognize all of that that what the bible backed up by the holy spirit and christ died at calvary to free you free you from superstitions fear doubt and trembling and he's alive today hear ye him amen i thought that was just beautiful but paul's talking about the mind of christ and what it looks like and does it look like it says there who has known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him and he says but we have the mind of christ so what does the mind of christ look like does it look like a mind that instructs god because when we look at the mind of christ was he going around telling god what to do was he insisting on his way was he pointing a direction saying this is the way to go no the reason i talked about the greatest weapon being prayer is because prayer is a conversation it is a two-way road not a one-way road as i've said many times you talk to god but the point is he's supposed to talk back to you and paul says who has known the mind of god how do you know the mind of god when you talk to him do i know the mind of god when i'm speaking no i know the mind of god when he's speaking so the mind of christ was to go and catch the thought and the purpose of god and having caught that or seen it brother brown said he had an open vision ministry whatever it was having caught the mind of god he would place that now into his mind and he would say this is what i'm going to do that's what happens when you do when you go into prayers you're looking to catch the mind and the thought of god and so the question is are we asking god or are we telling god because prayer is supposed to allow us to catch the mind of god that's what makes it a weapon brother branham would say at times well it changed the mind of god and he talks about hezekiah when he turned his face to the wall and said i don't want to die and god said to the prophet okay tell him he'll get 15 more years do you know what hezekiah achieved in those 15 years nothing bupkis zero it did nothing for him his kingdom his family is ministering nothing he absolutely did not achieve anything else god gave it to him as a grace but it didn't do him any good why because god's perfect will was to take him right then and to move on with another king and all he did was cause problems right so prayer is not to go change the mind of god prayer is to catch the mind of god and that's what the mind of christ on us is doing is it's going and it's saying lord what do you want to do in this situation or lord what are you trying to achieve in this situation lord do i wait or do i go do i press do i stand do i move away have i ventured without authority have i presumed lord what is it that's going on here and you're going to him and then you're sitting silently and you're saying lord talk to me and you may be reading your bible and that's how he answers you may be listening under the preaching of the word tonight and he gives you an answer you may be listening to a tape or you may be meditating you know david tells us to meditate a lot you know what that word salah means think about it meditate on it when you've spoken to god meditate make yourself open to him and say lord i'm seeking your will and now i'm going to be silent for a while i've expressed the need i've expressed the concern i've expressed what has to happen here i need to make a decision whatever it might be and then you say lord will you give me your answer and then you go looking for that answer you go looking for him to speak and don't presume it's going to be brother john and don't presume it's going to be brother branham let him speak the way he's going to speak listen he might use balaam's donkey from time to time depending on how bad your situation is amen he might use your brother or sister sitting next to you husbands he might use your wife wife's he may use your husband he may use somebody you don't think very much of to teach you a lesson in humility amen listen paul was saying no one tells god what to do but those that have the mind of christ they go and they seek it out and they stay there until god lets them know what he wants to do amen it's the mind that knows what god once done not by telling but by waiting not by pressing but in resting amen to just let it sit i'm going to get to a quote in a minute to just just put this to bed jesus said in john 5 30 he said i can of mine own self do nothing what he was saying is i don't allow myself to do something in my own in my own way of doing things because what he knew it would come to nothing the only thing only things that done only what's done for christ will last amen we sing that song or that that poem and then he says i can of my own self do nothing as i hear i judge and my judgment is just why because i seek not mine own will but the will of the father which has sent me so his judgment his understanding of a situation his insight into things is not because of what seeking his will or his way but because he's seeking to what see it through the eyes and the thoughts of god that's what makes it to him go back to the lord's prayer right thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as is in heaven give us it's what it's going to him and looking and asking for these things now this is the quote that cinches it down he says now there's a perfect way and a permissive way and i feel that if god here on the platform can show me things that has been and in my rooms and so forth he's able to tell me just where he wants me and what he wants me to do so brother bam says there's a way that god can work in me that is perfect and it's effective and it does exactly what it's supposed to do he says but i feel as long as i've got it all hooked up or i feel that he won't put his hands on it as long as i'm doing it he says and that's the way it is with anything as long as you're going to do it now watch what he jumps to the first thing he jumps to if someone talks about you and you talk back about them god can't fight your battle you're fighting it yourself amen what defending your reputation defending what people think about you putting somebody back in their place he says no no no no no no not your job he says see just let loose and let him do it and just commit it to him now listen to this the greatest weapon that i know of of a christian today is a committal to god is a committal to god greatest weapon is to do what let god fight it for you amen when you can't do nothing about it just commit it to him and god will take care of it amen committed to god so often like so many things i've said over this pulpit we do that last rather than first right when we've done all we can then we say lord i'm going to commit it to you what we need to do is commit it to him up front and say lord i'm trusting you and then do we sit idly by do we do nothing do we expect god to move the candy directly to our lips from the plate no we don't sit around right like a victorian princess and just waiting for him to spoon feed us no no no we're more rugged than that but what we do is we say lord i'm committing the results into your hand and i'll do what i can of my part but trusting that you're the one that's going to have the effect not me amen and if that means sitting still and being quiet then let it be sitting still and be quiet but it means you've got to go and have a hard conversation go and have a hard conversation if it means you've got to let your business what rest on his unchanging hands rather than your knowledge and experience that's fine let it be whatever he moves you to do let it do but don't let inactivity be your definition of spirituality either right we're supposed to be up and doing by his leadership but jot just up and doing amen rather than wasting our time and effort and then turning to god we're better off turning to god so that we don't waste our time amen and that goes for ministry that goes for families finances careers health whatever it is what do we say lord i'm committing this to you i'm doing the best that i can knowing that it's insufficient that's what committee means knowing that what i'm doing is insufficient but if you'll put your hands into it if you'll get involved lord it'll have the effect it'll do what it's supposed to do amen and all you do is you're saying lord my trust is in you that's all lord my trust is in you that's what committing it into his hands looks like brother brown says and neither will our intellectual our intellectuality ever match god how can our little infinite i think it means finite mind ever compare with the or the they he he gets confused he's confusing me how can the finite mind of us ever compare with the infinite mind of god that infinite mind of god is so far beyond hindu human intellectuals that it until it would never be the only way that bird will ever know what a man is talking about is by yielding himself and accepting it and doing whatever he thinks that the man wants him to do he's talking about a bird brain right or a worm brain as i said the only thing you can do is say this is what i think he wants me to do and then do it and if it works out well then say good i was right remember it for next time if it doesn't work out say i need to sit still and look and watch and listen maybe a little longer he says that's the only way that we know god is to follow the leading of the holy spirit he says that's old-fashioned it's god's program it's always been god's program it always will be god's program not by power not by might but by my spirit saith the lord he says that's where it comes you know brother brown was talking about that gift in his life and and if he could just let god do it then he'd be okay but the minute he tried to get involved that's where the problem rose and you'll you'll see him say many times and it's after the discernment line and he'll say now was what he said true brother branham couldn't even repeat what the holy spirit had said through him that's how surrendered he was okay i don't have that gift i don't know anybody that has that gift that they are unaware of what they said but that's how that's how relaxed he was when he let go and let god have his way in his life that god could take over and he would say things and he wouldn't even realize that his voice was being used but i can say in my own life in my own little ministry and the testimony of this comes from you not from me where after a service somebody comes up to me and they'll say you repeated a conversation that we had yesterday and you know what i didn't hear that conversation where somebody says you address something in my life that you didn't know about where you put something in its place that you had no clue was going on that you addressed the family situation that you're unaware of and guess what i have no clue of that why because god is the one that's doing that work and the grace to you is if you can believe that that's the holy spirit rather than john right but that has happened time and time again in my life and in my ministry where there are things that come out and i don't know what's going on in your life some get offended because they're convinced of that but most of you have realized i don't go around i don't know all these things then there's the other side which is you'll tell me about an issue in your life something you're praying about something you're struggling about and you know what i've learned to do with that because so it's so easy for a minister especially to go into the word and to go into the message and try and find the solution for you and you know what i've learned to do because you know what you end up doing you want to preach about it right in their home if not over the pulpit you know what i've learned to do commit it to god amen and i say lord if you want to use me use me but i'm going to pray about it and until an answer comes i'm not going to force it you see something going on in somebody's life and and you want to go there and you want to correct it and straight out no no no sit back and let god work amen let god handle it and what i've found is that god will sovereignly use something whether it's through me or through somebody else and over time he'll deal with that situation without me ever having to talk about it never having to go to that person never having to deal with that situation make them awkward make me awkward it's not fear that makes me do it it's that i don't want to get my hands in front of his that i don't want to get my feet in front of his that i want him to do his work rather than me trying to force somebody into doing something that i think they should do right god will sort out his own children it's up to me to preach the word amen god is so sovereign in those things and i've seen it time and time again if i will relax and let him do it then it'll come out and so often it addresses it before i even know about it and that's the best time i'm glad i don't know about it i'm glad i don't know about because i can speak with confidence because i know that i don't know that i'm touching somebody i'm clueless when it comes to so many of those things amen well i'm telling you is what the prophet god said if you can keep your oar out of the water and let god move the boat you go a whole lot faster and a whole lot straighter than if you try and tell him where to go and what to do don't try and get yourself involved relax and let him do it commit it to him let him run with it let him work it out amen scripture asks who has known the mind of god that he may instruct god that's knowing something with the intent of trying to tell god what to do not me but sometimes we do i've covered this before we go in and we tell god what we want the solution to be rather than letting him figure it out amen be still and know that he is god find his will and that's when you can move forward that's when you can have that confidence amen sometimes we've got to speak sometimes we've got to be quiet sometimes we've got to reach out and touch someone sometimes we've got to hold back and let them go through the pain there's a wisdom that comes from following the leadership of the holy spirit because god sees the big picture i see so little so little i'm reminded of you know there's that that old story of an elephant there and four blind men walk up to him and they touch him and one touches the leg and he says he's like a tree and one touches the the the uh the trunk and you know and he says no it's like a snake and the other one touches the tail and says no it's like a uh uh you know a willow or uh you know the you know uh fuzzy things you know something like that and then the other one touches the skin and says no it's like a piece of armor and every single one of them was right but none of them saw the big picture right and that's the way we are so many times as we look at a situation and we're convinced that we figured out what's wrong with that person what's wrong with that family what's wrong with and we can't even figure out our own lives and yet we're sitting there trying to tell this person that person we're convinced that we figured it out it's never that simple god sees and knows all those things and i've learned to be quiet and let him sort it out because he knows what's going on far above what i can do i'm i'm struggling hard enough to get his own will for my life much less figure out what's going on in yours amen i'll help where i can i'll help where i can but i don't worry about trying to straighten you out i worry about letting him straighten me out amen even as i prayed in there today you know before i came out i said lord don't let this this word go from here out let it come from here and include me in it and go all the way to the back of the building amen this is for me as much as it is for you and these things amen amen lord help me find your will so i won't get in your way as that song says let's stand together if we would and then we covered the soul we covered the spirit and so next time we're going to go into the body we're going to start talking about what that looks like and that'll kind of be the end of this series it'll probably take a couple more services lord willing but what we're looking at is a life surrendered and then sealed submitted and surrendered and that's where we're going to be going for the the next few services but just be in prayer for it amen bring in prayer for the going forth of the word amen i take these things seriously we're getting ready to go you know when there's a lot of things got to happen before we go i believe but i believe we'll stay faithful if we'll keep our lives simple and then if we'll look to him then he's going to finish the work that he started in our lives amen let's bow our heads together lord jesus lord we're in a battle lord and the prophet of god said the meanest man he knew was william branham lord the meanest man i know was jonathan kerlet lord and that's the first battle that's got to be defeated lord and that's where the new birth comes in as it takes jonathan curled out lord and it puts christ in its place and lord we're asking that that life would flow out lord that lord you see the areas where we've struggled lord you'd see the fears and the doubts that satan has placed in our lives lord you see the strongholds that are there but lord we're asking for your word to flow through us lord that your holy spirit will quicken it lord that as we sit in the presence of the son lord as we mature and ripen lord as we lay these things in these promises before you lord may you just quicken it into our lives lord not just head knowledge lord we're thankful for the things we know we're thankful for the reason that we have lord that sound mind but lord we want a daily reality of the life of christ inside each one of us lord lord not just for me lord but for everyone that's here lord lord knowing there's many out that we need to come in and lord we pray your holy spirit will go after them lord that it would lord put an unction in their heart lord to return back to the way that they've been taught lord that they would return back to that word lord that that last little cog in this great lord bride this great great bride mechanism lord that it would start to function just the way it's supposed to lord though when that last one comes in lord we know we can get ready to go lord may we not be holding up the train lord but may we be quick lord to just get in line with your word we pray lord have your way in our lives fill us a new lord we pray lord push out doubt push out fear or push out those things that are clogged up in those five inner senses we pray lord and help us to submit these things to you and let you work on them but we ask these things in jesus name amen let's sing that song it's not in trying but entrusting 992. [Music] it's not in trying but entrusting [Music] it's not in running but in resting and it's not in wandering but in praying that we find the strength of the lord it's not in trying but entrusting [Music] it's not in running but in resting it's not in wondering but in praise that we find the strength it's not in trying but in trusting oh it's not in running but in resting it's not in wondering but in praying that we find the strength of the lord it's not in trying but in trusting it's not in running but in resting [Music] that we find the strength i give my mind completely to you 11 20.
