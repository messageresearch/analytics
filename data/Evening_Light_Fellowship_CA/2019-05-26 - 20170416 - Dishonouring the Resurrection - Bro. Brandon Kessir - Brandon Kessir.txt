here healer you hold my every moment amen you could stack them up against any group I just want to thank the Lord for that it was sung in our tremendous anointing and it was sung with revelation so we thank the Lord for that and the kids you know was just it was always a blessing to see the kids up there and I was thinking I'm looking at that deductr I think way back not everybody was here with you remember some of us remember when we did that I think was a Christmas time I've done on famous Road and remember that and Matt was only at that time and he stole - oh yeah still succeed on the show I guess but anyway we thank the Lord for that amen God has been good to us amen this was impressed upon me for a while to sing so if we just want to remember that God is in control of every moment of our lives and every need we have and he all we have to do is trust him all we had to do was believe him and when he rose 2,000 years ago sickness was done away with in his mind we were already healed so if you have a need this morning just hold it there on your heart and that God ministered through the rammer said you can be healed in music through music to the songs of Zion so it's my faith so let's sing that this morning as brother Brandon gets ready to come you [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I [Applause] lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] Wow [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I [Applause] [Music] [Music] I [Music] praise the Lord [Music] [Music] [Applause] praise the Lord Lord I'm coming now to thee it's ninety seven of their praised alone [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] a star [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so we're looking for this morning is for him to lay his hand on us as he has so many times before and he's been so faithful to us in so many situations and we just come and depend on him again this morning greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus and I was thinking this morning as I was getting ready for service that I'm really terrible at greetings and all of those things so you know where we had the last service and it occurs to me that I should greet you from the Saints at home and the ones that sit along there their greetings sirgreetings from brother Jerry Fury our pastor and from different ones that know you and met by the bomb sister Brenda especially have been a few times and for the lowland brother Jay and all the ones that know I said hi and passed along their greetings and and and all that so you've been greeted and I also see the same going back so for brother Gerald but Jerry else has had to greet you brother Gerald and I I think I did that but like I say I'm not very good at the greetings part of things so god bless you all anyway and it sure has been a a good time with you I always feel that it's just a real comfortable place to be in and just in fellowship and getting to know you and also you know to come in and step in the pulpit it it just feels very welcoming and I remember the first time I ever took a service somewhere else and I was literally shaking so hard and the brother had to give him give me a hug and reassure me before the service because I was I was just trembling at the at the pulpit but by God's grace we've got over some of those nerves a little bit over the years but I for the very first time I came here I just felt very comfortable so god bless you all for for being that kind of hospitable people and and we certainly appreciate that and you know time is short we come in and out pretty quick but Lord willing we have a chance to come in fellowship and and vacation here again we certainly enjoyed that in the past so and it's such good singing this morning and and playing and all of that and brother Paul was asking me how the music ministry has been and I I think it just really grown it's been you know awesome seeing the younger ones grow up and fill those roles and even in the sound booth there but the Danny coffees back there you know the young ones raisin up and fill in those positions that's it's a great thing and we always want to encourage that so praise the Lord and even the young brothers that stand in open the door I thought that's just the neatest thing that yeah brother Levi before the gayborhood just getting up there and and opening the doors and so this is awesome any more of that at home but yeah god bless you so you know this morning I was thinking it will actually win I'm brother Gerald had emailed me and asked me to come and and I'm not a by any means I special meetings types of a minister and and I've never taken a Sunday morning Easter message before but you know it's not a very conventional one this morning you know out about the rabbit and the eggs and everything like that you know they probably spoke about all over the place but but what what came on my heart actually was kind of a different different thought of dishonouring the resurrection yeah because a lot of people gather on Easter morning and it's the first time they've been in church since Christmas you know they you know we were driving here this morning and you know brother Adam you know big big crowds everywhere you know go by every Church and and the parking lots full and and you just think that oh wow you know all of these people have gotten you know up this morning special and they have got their suit on and they got maybe a new Easter dress for the little ones and the end you know the the ladies have all come up all nice and everything else and they think that God's going to be pleased by you know what they've brought to the table so to speak what they've done and I think oh man we're gonna come this morning we're gonna honor the resurrection but God's not honored by that God's not honored by a once-a-year type of commitment to to serving him he's not interested in twice a year when you you know come to Christmas morning kind of experience and so I started to think about this kind of experiences and how you know even in our own lives sometimes we get to a place where we're not really honoring God the way that we think that we we are and just kind of in that in that vein so you know there is there's some good news in there too because there certainly is a way that each and every day we can be honoring the resurrection but if we stand this morning we'll just turn to the scripture Isaiah chapter 29 another way the scripture tells us is that God's ways are not our ways and you know still most of the time when we think about God we think of them through our you know the way that we look at everything but you know God's got a different perspective on it all and what pleases God and what pleases us sometimes are very different things but Isaiah 29 here gives us a little bit of insight into this and it says verse 13 wherefore the Lord said for as much as this people draw near with their mouths and with their lips to honor me but have removed their heart far from me and their fear toward me is taught by the precept of men therefore behold I will proceed to do a marvellous work among this people even a marvelous work in a wonder for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hid if you turn over to Deuteronomy chapter 6 as well just quickly and Moses says there - to the children of Israel he says hear o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart let's bow our heads Lord Jesus father we just come to you this morning we are so thankful for a resurrected life that's been given to us Lord Father if it was only your death on Calvary and there was no resurrection then Lord we could we could go into death ourselves feeling forgiven Lord and knowing that you atoned for us by Lord it was your resurrection that really paved the way for us Lord Jesus that not only could we be forgiven the but we could be like you we could have fellowship we could we get it conquer this world Lord and we can follow in the example that you left this morning Lord I trust that the word that spoken many of those things I hope are not a reflective of our lives Lord but in the in the things that we do see Lord if there's any areas where we've we become cold where we become formal Lord then we just asked that you drive those things far from us Lord and that that powerful life that power of your resurrection could shine forth each one of our lives we pray father we commit each one to you this morning and I ask that you just take me out of the way Lord take us all out of the way and may we just let your anointing flow in Jesus name we pray man you may be seated this morning so as we look into this start I I was thinking about why it is sometimes that we miss the God so much him and we miss him and I don't know maybe you don't feel that way maybe you feel like you're always walking in God's perfect well every moment of every day but you know I'm just gonna be honest with you that I there's many times when I know that I'm not walking exactly where God wants me to be but I don't even know where that is sometimes you know you know I should be doing right and I will you know get up and I will pray you know read my Bible and do all those things but as we start on another day you know there isn't a big flashing light I want to do this talk to this person say this you know and so many times we know that we just keep walking as much as we can and we look for the leadership of the Lord in many situations to say what should I do in this case what should I do in this case how should I handle this situation but you know we really we really come into it because we have a disability okay we have a disability what's this all about well we have a disability because we're trapped in these bodies you know no matter what genes of intelligence and talent lay within us no matter how great and capable our flesh will ever become we're all disabled because we all contact the world around us by five natural and five spiritual senses you know we don't have the same access that God has when he looks upon his earth he sees things quite differently than we do because he's going beyond those senses that we have he knows the end from the beginning he knows all things he you know before he created a single part of it all he knew exactly where you'd be this morning not just what building you'd be located in but what the condition of your heart is where your mind would be this morning what struggles you're going through what trials and difficulties you're experiencing but when we come we don't see any of that you know where we're left to contact the world by our site and our hearing smell taste and feel and buy our affection memory conscience reasoning and imagination and and you might think those are not disabilities those are abilities you know and they are if you take one of them away you'll see how much more disabled the body becomes but they're all that we have many times to make our way around we make our decisions based on the information that we take in and process from those senses but have you ever noticed that your senses get lied to all the time you know your senses get lied to all the time you might think oh you know you know I can see this with my eyes it must be good and then find out that it's not that good you know they give us a false witness many times and many times we can't form a true judgment beyond what our senses have declared to us you know a really good example of that in the Old Testament is is Isaac you know who brother Graham tells us with a prophet who you know in his eyesight had gone and he was coming to a place where he wanted to bless his his sons and give them their inheritance and their portion and and so we see that you know Isaac had still you know for good remaining census is you know his hearing was good and his his sense of taste and smell you know we're excellent feel was excellent you know but is his eyes at dimmed and so he sends out his son Esau who you know was the one that he was his firstborn and that he favored and he said go out and get me some venison and cook it up for me just the way that I like and so you know it looked like you know he would get the the birthright and he would get the the blessing of the firstborn and all of that but while he's gone his his wife her Isaac's wife Rebekah and and Jacob they conspired together and and they they fool Isaac census he's got perfectly good working census but they fool those census to get him to think that there's someone else that he's blessing they to get them to think that Jacob is actually Esau and so what they do is of course well well Esau is off hunting the venison you know Rebekah has prepared Esau his clothes for Jacob to put on so that he'll smell like like ISA and she's prepared you know some some hairs for him to you know wrap his his arms with so that you know that he'll feel more like Esau cuz he saw was the hairier of the two brothers you know and she prepares the food just right so that it will taste and appeal to his sense of taste just like you know he would for for the meat that Esau is gonna bring back and so you know he's going to smell like Esau he's going to feel like Esau and the meat is going to taste like the meat that Esau supposed to be bringing and so his senses are giving him a report that's good one of his senses is tingling if it doesn't sound like the voice of Esau sounds like the voice of Jacob but even in that time where he's getting mixed messages his senses are strongly they're telling him but but I smell him and I feel him and I and I taste this meat its everything's lining up it must be right and so he's so convinced that you know you think if he was a little more nervous about it he would have held back a little bit on the blessing but you know he just blesses and blesses and blesses and blesses Jacob in the place of ISA to the point that when Esau comes later and and finds out the treachery Isaac basically tells him I don't have any blessing left you know I already gave it all to Jacob I already you know I already poured it all out on him and so we find that deception of our senses is very easy to pull off you know in this world actually prides itself on illusions you know optical illusions and auditory illusions and all these things because you know we like to have our senses fooled sometimes but we also fool one another with those senses deception has been around since you know the Garden of Eden and when a servant serpent deceived even and worked on her conscience and her her memory her reasoning to convince her to step outside of the perfect will of God and and do things that were not right in and so often we are easily deceived just by those same things by our memory and our conscience and our imagination being influenced gets us on the wrong track you know because we depend on those senses we take things at face value we take things the way they appear to be you know and when we when we think that some a certain way then we say well that must be the way that it is you know and you might be thinking well we've been given another sense we've been given a faith a faith sense but they're gonna call the sixth sense faith and we believe that you know that's very true we've been given faith and brother Brown tells us that faith is what contacts God and faith is a revelation of the will of God so faith gives us understanding and it gives us discernment in many situations but it's not a perfect indicator in every part of our lives you know and I believe that the reason that's limited is because it comes through this fallen flesh still and through our human spirit sometimes and so you know it's not it's not like it was in Jesus where it was a perfect discernment that worked every time you know it's not like it it would be in God where he sees the the right way every time but in HUS in our in our human flesh in this fallen condition you know that's not going to be a redeemed till the body change you know we we don't have that perfect discernment in every situation you come to church and you and you see the brothers and sisters here and you know you don't have a perfect discernment of their situation you know everybody shakes hands say Oh God bless you and we just how are you doing today good you say oh good I'm good too and so everybody well we were all doing good today that's wonderful you know nobody has any needs and nobody has any problems we're just all serving the Lord we're all doing good and you know and that's we kind of deceive ourselves sometimes by those things but God doesn't see us that way this morning you know when what we can come in here we can say I'm doing good and we could sing and praise God and everything but he knows exactly what your condition is this morning he knows exactly how much faith you have he knows exactly how much revelation you have he knows exactly if there's a Holy Ghost working in your life he knows exactly how sincere you are this morning and he's not fooled you know and that's not to to make us all scared and say oh man maybe God sees me in a different way than I see myself but it's it's to help us realize that when we come to church and we all put on our nice clothes and and then smile and shake everybody's hand God knows that there still needs in our lives okay there's still a place that we need him we depending on him and you know as much as we we try to put on the air that we we're doing really well sometimes that doesn't tell the whole story you know some of the places that we are most deceived actually is in church you know amongst Christians you know you say well that sounds crazy you know if there's any place that you should be able to you know really feel comfortable and the moment occasion of yourself it should be in church because you know you're not under the pressure of the world and the strain of sin and all those things you should be able to come here and just be yourself but often with we're here and we're acting on our best behavior not our typical behavior and we're here we're here in like the you know the the absolute you know best that we can be for a short time you know we're not we don't yell at our kids at church as much as possible you know we everything's just nice and we try to do everything just right and you know everybody just smiles and you know all of those things and we save all of the other stuff from one on the trip back home which tell the kids how bad they were don't you ever do that again don't you ever I don't ever want to see that and anymore you know and you know we do all those things and that's where our complaints come out and that's where you know all of our problems come out and all those things is away from church in church we try to be brave and strong and and smile and all of those things and we fool each other I believe with that all the time you know we shake hands like I said ever how are you doing good you know I've I still have not yet ever had a time where I strict somebody's hand say how you're doing they go oh just terrible brother just just really really really bad today please pray for me I've still yet to have that happen and yet you know I've shaken brother's hands that like manna they're going through some things it's good to see that he's doing so well you know and and then you know that on you know it can't possibly be that good but yet that's our our brave face that we put forth in churches so you know sometimes we do a disservice that way in the sense that we don't let people in so that they could know hey they're struggling let me pray for them let me let me support them let me help them out they're really struggling you know sometimes it's good to say you know when somebody asks you how you do is like you know would you remember me in prayer or would you you know just just remember me brother a brother or sister you know I would appreciate that you know that's the kind of thing that lets people know that hey there's a there's a life that's behind that that's vulnerable it's a human being they're still struggles and difficulties and things that were going through so we want to be real when we come to the house of the Lord and not always just so good so happy so vibrant and everything's so wonderful but we want to be real and genuine and you know when I think about when I think about the examples of the Saints before us you know from Jesus himself to to Paul to brother Brown to on and on and on the scripture tells us their mistakes scripture tells us their problems it tells us their bad days you know it tells us their weaknesses it tells them you know Paul was the one that preached to no I would do this but you know I would want to do right but I fail and I do wrong you know I want to do good but every time I want to do good evil is present with me you know Paul didn't just stand up and say like I don't make any mistakes and I don't have a bad day and I'm always doing so good you know Paul takes the time to write about his weaknesses write about his problems write about you know those those infirmities and say you know what I'm really struggling with this sometimes you know this person wrote the letter for me and it wasn't just because I didn't have time it was cuz I have seven trouble seeing I was having trouble you know putting it down myself so you know I had this brother write the letter for me or you know different things like that they let us into their lives brother branham you know never made it sound like life was easy you never made it sound like he was just you know he had a much easier time than you but he shared with he shared with you shared with me his struggles because that shows us the reality of what it is to be a human being serving the Lord it's not always you know just so spiritual it's not always just so you know walking with the Angels and in fact most of the time it doesn't feel like you're walking with the Angels it doesn't feel like everything's super spiritual the Lord said unto Samuel you know one day Samuel was looking around god I told him to go choose one of Jesse's sons to be the king and you know he was looking like we would look he would he was looking on the outside appearance who would be the most kingly amongst these sons you know and yet he had picked out the oldest one who was strong and tall and all those things but the Lord gives him a little insight that that travels our trim translates well to the thought this morning and he said the Lord said unto Samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because I've riff used him for the Lord see if not as man see it for the man looketh on the outward appearance but the Lord looketh on the heart and that principle that the Lord doesn't look on the outward appearance he looks on the heart is is what really guides everything about the way God moves you know we may be many times would look at a certain person and say that person will make a great Christian that person you know you know it's just a real example to me that person some of that I put my confidence in but a lot of times we're putting our confidence in them because they look big and strong and tough or because they look sweet and mild and meek and we think you know that's the kind of person that I'm putting my confidence in and yet you'll time will come to pass that you know that person didn't make a very good Christian you know they they could never subject themselves maybe to the Word of God or you know they just couldn't persevere you know that sister that was so sweet and kind you know she ended up not being very sweet and kind when you know things got down to it or whatever kind of situation comes along or she couldn't endure and so God he's not looking at those things he's looking at the heart he's looking at the inside to see what's there and what will respond to his word and God sees us as I said as we actually are he sees if there's unconcerned unconfessed seeing in our lives he sees how much revelation we have he sees if we have the Holy Ghost and we can't really tell brother branham himself said you know even with the gift that he had he couldn't tell if you had the Holy Ghost or not and he couldn't tell if you were gonna make it or not if you were the bride or not you know he had to depend upon his senses as well you know he had to depend upon his being able to see the fruits of your life and maybe look at the pattern of your life and tell you that you're on the right path but you know unless God showed him he couldn't tell you that you know and so even in our even in our own life sometimes it's difficult to discern those things you know because if you're in a backslidden condition do you want to admit that you're in a backslidden condition not very often you want to justify your condition and say like oh I'm not really that bad it's just you know I just you know feeling this certain way or just going through a little time or whatever or this is okay it's not so bad other people are doing it whatever we do it's difficult to even detect in our own life sometimes it takes a real prayer and entering into the presence of God individually for God's Spirit to sweep over us and show us oh here's some sin that needs to be cleaned out here are some things we need to move out of our lives here's some things we need to separate from and to show us our true condition and to show us himself growing in our lives and as I mentioned before I think earlier one of those service my ultimate goal and every service is that we individually really reach the place where God's Word doesn't just touch our senses it doesn't just tickle our ears doesn't just make us interested but to the Spirit of God touches our spirit and soul and really just individually shows us where we at where are we at and where do we need to grow and where do we need to change and just examine ourselves that's really when it has power in our lives so saying all that kind of set the foundation this morning for this thought dishonouring the resurrection you know Isaiah said that the the people of Israel were drawing near to God with their mouths and their lips and their mind but their heart was far from him you know and we're used to the idea of honoring a dishonouring we we know when someone's saying something nice you know we know and you know some somebody's saying something insulting or dishonouring you know we know when someone's being polite or when you know and respectful we'd say okay you know they're they're approaching it the right way you know they're giving a Comey mister or sir or brother you know they're not just you know being mean that there's no slang or or nickname or anything involved they're being you know polite and respectful or we know when people are being rude and disrespectful to us and when we're being treated well we feel honored and when we're being treated poorly we feel dishonor but have you ever found that you can be deceived by that sometime someone will honor you they'll butter you up they'll flatter you because they're trying to manipulate you you know if you ever go to a place where there's a salesperson involved you know they're usually giving you compliments left right and center because they're trying to get from you to purchase their product they're trying to you know tell you about how you know how good you are huh what a great decision you know it you know when you go and you tell the the waiter what kind of meal you want he never says oh that's terrible why did you offer that myself excellent choice that was that was a wonderful choice that's my favorite meal you know you'll really enjoy it you know why because he's trying to tell you how good you are you're just making great decisions in everything else because they're trying to get a larger tip out of you you know or a real estate agent or a car salesman or whatever they're being so nice not just because they enjoy your company but because they have something to sell you and something to gain from you so what it usually comes down to when we think about this is is we question if somebody's being sincere and if we think they're being sincere then we say okay you know I can respond to that and I feel honored and I feel respected and all those things because they seem sincere but that sincerity is still a judgement that we're making on our five natural and spiritual senses and we still get fooled by that all the time but God isn't fooled by what we say or how we act God sees the conditions of our heart and God knows the thoughts that we think as well as what we say and do you know so many times the the reason that we don't really catch on to how someone feels about something so we don't know their thoughts we only know what they say and do and so as long as they say and do things that sound good to us we think it's all good but we don't know the thought behind that but brother Brown tells us that you know our thoughts speak louder in heaven than our actions do on earth and so you know it's not a mystery to God what we're thinking today you know and it's not a mystery to God that you know if we're really in tune with the moving of his spirit that's why I read the scripture in Deuteronomy 6 is that it's not one of the Ten Commandments you know love of the Lord with all your heart and soul and strength that's not one of the Ten Commandments and yet Jesus said it was the greatest commandment but it doesn't it doesn't have any do's and dont's in it it doesn't have any regulations in it it doesn't you know doesn't have any real doctrine or substance to it but it's really the meat and potatoes of the whole thing it's really the substance of a whole experience of a real Christian is love the Lord God with all your heart and soul and strength because that's the part you carefree you can't act it it has to be genuine you know in every one of the 10 commandments or every one of the commandments or doctrines even that we would follow today can be lived without a nature change every one you know how do we know because the Ten Commandments were actually given to a people who never had a nature change you know they were given to people that you know had no access to the Holy Ghost the people that you know we're just stuck in their same human nature and they did pretty well with those Commandments you know they've governed pretty well following those Commandments and so we know that many people get very good living the law of the word many people get very good at understanding you know what the church standard is and what what the message standard is and what you know what the Bible teaches and they get really good at those things and yet they feel the greatest commandment loving the Lord God with all their heart and soul in mind you know and so that's what we find at the time when Jesus arrives on the scene in the scripture the churches of that day have become absolute experts in dishonouring God while honoring him you know dis honoring God while everything they did look like they were honoring God you know what what a strange thing they honored God and everything they said and did and yet dishonored him at the very same time she want to read you some of the interactions with Jesus and the Pharisees you know and we always think bad Pharisees bad you know these are horrible people you know what look at what they did they end up crucifying our Lord you know they're they end up influencing all these people but we forget that at that time they were the most holy people around if you wanted to look at somebody that was consecrated and somebody that you could look at and say that's a real servant of God that's who I want to pattern my life after that's how I want my kids to grow up to be like that it would be like those Pharisees because everything they did look so good and holy in and when and just right and if you ever wanted to know should I be doing this should I be doing that you'd ask the Pharisees because they were the example of the most religious people around the people that were the most right and so in Matthew chapter 15 say then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees which were of Jerusalem saying why did i decipher us the traditions of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread this is the message elite you know the the people of that day coming to Jesus and you know they they had everything so down that nobody could point a finger at their lives such a good life to the point that they had a whole set of traditions they were even above the standard of the of the Word of God you know they were so righteous that they figured out you we don't even have enough rules you know most people are like there's too many rules but the Pharisees are like you know we we've got those rules down let's create a bunch more rules because you know we think that it should be even more holy and even and even you know more strict and so they had traditions that weren't even in the word traditions that were made up by people who like things are certain away and and could pressure others to live the same way as them and and so they you know they had a church standard that was even different from the standard of the word you know and what I like is that Jesus setting point fingers the same way that they pointed fingers at him you know he didn't just come up with some some rule to get back at them but he actually poked right through all of that and points right down to the heart you know so many times when it comes to you know word and doctrine and everything else people just rattle quotes back and forth you know and say oh you know well here's my quote well here's my quote whatever I'm said this year but this one said here and this one said here but Jesus pokes right through all of that to their heart and he points right to a point of Honor is the first thing that he looks at it and he brings it forth here in in verse three said but he answered and said to them why do you also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition for God commanded saying honour thy father and mother and he that curseth father or mother let him die the death but you say what whosoever shall say to his father or his mother it is a gift by which that might be prophetess by me and honor not yet not his father or a mother he shall be free thus you have you made the commandment of of none effect by your tradition you hypocrites well did Isaiah say of you saying the people draw nigh unto me with their mouth and honoureth me with their lips but their heart is far from me but in vain do they worship Me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men you know they probably felt pretty smug when they first approached Jesus you know something having something to correct him by you know some some place that they found where you know if you're the Messiah you should be living the whole word and Jesus turns it around and exposes their whole lives with this one scripture and he said their whole lives were built on outward honor and inward dishonor you know the example he uses of honor thy father and thy mother you know it's something that was a you know part of the Ten Commandments it was part of the you know very foundation of what Moses had given to the children of Israel but they had found a way to bypass it they had found a way to do it without love without respect without kindness because they said hey I got a great idea you know we don't really love our parents but let's have a Mother's Day and a Father's Day and let's give them gifts and then we can say that we we've honored them you know we we took a little time out we you know we spent a little bit of money on them and now we can say that we have honored them properly and yet throughout the year they could continue to disrespect their parents they could continue to not follow the leadership not take the advice not do any of those things but because they gave a gift because they gave a little token of affection that was good enough that's the way a lot of people approach God is that you know they don't really love God enough to take the word and live it out and do exactly what he said and and you'll follow the the gospel the way it was preached but they are they're good enough at giving gifts they're good enough at coming in and giving a little honor here and there so that it looks like they're being faithful to the Lord you know they're good enough to come in and and in worship a little bit the good enough to come in and and give a little bit of attention here and there but not able to really honor him every day honor him every day by by hearing his word by responding to his call they care too much about the outward you know if we look at even churches in the message we care so much about the outward that we missed the urgency of the condition of a soul you know we see someone new to church oh man I need to I see a nude sister in church today someone please get her a skirt you know wipe off her makeup you know can we sign her up for some hair extensions can we can we do something you know can we brush that outside make it a little bit you know a little longer you know what is that we have a we have a need in us to conform people on the outside to match the same thing that we are you know the same things that we want to be you know there's a new brother visiting church today does he have a copy of the church age book yeah has he learned to say the seventh angels Creed yet you know how does he have a Malik Malachi four memorized yet does he does he know revelations 10 yet does he know and we cram all these expectations on people because what we really want more than anything else is for the outside to match our outside you know when Jesus pointed that out to them it really rankled the Pharisees you know and am i wrinkle that's a little bit because I think in some in all of us there's probably a little bit of Pharisee you know we like people to look like we think they should look you know we like people that act like we think they should act and talk like we think they should talk you know in most of the time what we think they should do is a lot like us you know they should be more like us they should they should look and act and talk like we do then we know that they have it and then they can be just as hypocritical as we are sometimes you know because Jesus looked at them and he saw how polished they were you know and he didn't have any Pat's on the back for them you know and I'm sorry if it comes across hard this morning but but Jesus and and and all of God's ministers really they picked the hardest on the religious people on the people that already you know have a form of godliness because that's where the real problem is you know people would look at Jesus and say how come he has all this time for you know sinners a tax collectors and you know the woman at the well and everything else he didn't you know preach to her about her standard he didn't preach to them but he was for the ones that already had it all together that's the one who he was hardest are because there's so many so many tendencies in us to depend upon those things and then to use them as the justification why we're better than somebody else or you know or why we're really saved we're not saved because you know we live a cleaner life than somebody else we're not saved because you know we have a better doctrine than somebody else you know the difference between this church and the next Church down the street with the full parking lot this morning you know isn't because we have better doctrine it's because we are contacting the power of Almighty God in a way that they can't contact because they don't know where to look for him you know they've come to church looking for him this morning and there's no there's no God there for them because of the the false doctrine that they're under because of you know the the light that they're being shown is not a light it's a glare you know brother Brown when he talks about the Pharisees and hypocrites he would often get the the definition mixed up because you know you say the Pharisee means actor but Pharisee actually means separated you know they started out with with a desire to be separated to be a special holy consecrated people their lives consecrated to God that that they would be different they would be better than others but Jesus called them hypocrites and hypocrite means actor you know instead of becoming more holy they really became more skillful at acting holy you know and that's a case sometimes is that you know instead of becoming more close to God we come better at talking about being closer to God you know we get better at when we come to church you know say oh yeah it was just you know it just felt like the Lord really led me today and everything else and everything was going so good we just get better at acting out those things sometimes then we do had actually growing closer to the Lord Jesus has more to say to the Pharisees and he says woe unto you scribes and Pharisees for you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men for you neither go in yourselves neither suffer you them that are entering to go in woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for you devour widows houses and for a pretence make long prayer therefore you shall receive the greater damnation one two you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for you come pass sea and land to make one proselyte and when he has made you make him twofold more the child of Hell than yourselves Wow that that's an encouraging message brother Jesus the that you brought to the Pharisees there and and yet but nobody in that time nobody was going into the presence of God any more but everybody sure looked the part you know and see that you know in that time that the Pharisees they they would you know conduct themselves in such a holy way and when people would come and want to live that way they would give them a set of garments they would give them a code of conduct they would give them you know a standard and say this is what you need to do to enter in and that person who who used to have a fire and a desire to you know really get closer to God they adopt a new lifestyle instead and they never really get through to God people without the Holy Ghost convincing other people to live their dry dead religion holding back people who are on fire for God who don't see it like they do and conforming them instead to the standard you know we see that we see that in churches everywhere you know you know that the people come in they're excited they want to serve the Lord and then pretty much they're just a carbon copy of everybody else after a while you know they know what to say they know what to do they know how to fit in and yet that real passion and zeal that they had isn't there anymore jesus said you know they made them twofold more the child of Hell than they themselves were because they just can confirm them or converted them into their way of thinking you know of course we know that how that goes many times too in many churches pulling for money spiritualizing everything bringing damnation on themselves while they think they're doing God's work and you know really stood out to me this time reading through the scripture he says compassing land and sea you know what is that have that's a missions program compassing land and sea you know with with a message and you know so many times when Jesus said you know going to all the world and preach the gospel is what he said but so many times that mission program isn't about preaching the gospel it's about spreading the influence of a church or it's about you know getting more support in other places and you know some of that real purpose that we should be doing those things for us changed you know as churches have realized hey this is a great way to spread our name this is a great way to you know to have an influence this is a great way to you know control a program and we honor the work of man as much or more than the work of God sometimes and we measure our works in how many message books and and dollars were spent instead of how many souls were one for the kingdom how many people have been filled with the Holy Ghost why because it's a lot easier to measure those things it's a lot easier to you know to make the magazines and the printouts and the websites celebrating those things than it is to really put the time and effort and prayer and devotion to win souls to Christ Jesus goes on to say woe unto you you blind guides which say whosoever shall swear by the temple it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple he is a debtor you fools and blind for whether is greater the gold of the or the temple the sanctified the gold and whosoever shall swear by the altar it is nothing but whosoever shall swear by the gift that is upon it he is guilty you fools and blind for whether is greater the gift or the altar that sanctified the gift whoso therefore shall swear by the altar sweareth by it and by all things there on who should I'll swear by the temple sweareth by it and by him that dwelleth therein and he that shall swear by heaven sweareth by the throne of God and by him that sitteth thereon they had gone to a hardened condition they were to gone to such a hardened condition it was such so full of carnality and blasphemy and everyone was so concerned about proper form instead of real worship and praise you know the Pharisees had distorted the value so much that they can only see the value of the gold they could only see the value of the gifts instead of the God that's right there the god that's right there that you know that it's present that's real that's powerful and everything else and they had to reduce the whole experience down to gifts and gold you know and and and condemning the people that were there to you know to receive from God condemning them putting them under bondage instead of pushing them towards Christ you know I've heard people so concerned about blaspheming God because they didn't do this or they didn't do that just right you know instead of instead of realizing that you know just press in just press in and find God you know it's so concerned because he didn't do this or just right or that just right or because they believe this way or believe that way but the greatest blasphemy to me is when your confession and your life don't match and that's the condition that all of these Pharisees were in is that their their confession of their righteousness and their actual life didn't match your first John chapter 2 verse 3 says and hereby we know we do know that we know him if we keep his Commandments he that say if I know him and keepeth not his Commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him but whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected hereby we know that we're in him so they would say we're keeping his Commandments but there's no love in them John goes on to say in chapter 4 verse 20 says if a man say I love God and hate if his brother he's a liar he's for he that loveth not his brother whom he has seen how can he love God whom he had not seen and this commandment have we from him that he who loveth God love his brother also what a thing you know a lot of people will fuss and fight over a doctrine fuss and fight to the point that they'll say well if you don't see that your serpent see if you don't see that you know we can't have any fellowship if you don't see that you know if you see this different than me you know we can never can ever be agreed on anything and they're just violating what the scripture just said because how can you how can you say you love God how can you keep his Commandments and you don't have any love for your brother you know that's one of the things that I've seen and as as I traveled a little bit is that the ones that have so much revelation often have the least amount of of grace towards one another you know because they're God's brought them to a point they know everything and you don't know everything so you know you better get in shape really quick instead of having a desire to restore that brother or help that brother in any of those things it's it always comes with a judgment or with in a kind of an exclusiveness we've got this until you get here you know there's no hope for you that's not really the way that Jesus preached it some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words and said unto him are we blind also and jesus said unto them if you were blind he should have no sin but now you say we see therefore your sin remaineth God is always so merciful and kind and gentle and you know when I look at how he's treated me in my life he's just always had grace for me because I've certainly needed a lot of it you know there's many times that I thought oh man I'm on the right Road everything else strip and fall and you know all of those things and if it wasn't for God's grace to us where would any of us be you know if it's not cuz we got it the first time that you know we're here this morning it's not because we got it the second time but it's because after falling time and time again God still has grace for us you know and so the Pharisees asked Jesus like are you calling us blind then and Jesus said no you know if you were blind and if you would come needy and if you would come humbly there's a balm for those eyes you know just like the angel tells us you know in in our age late Asiya that there is a salve for our eyes you know that we can see that we can anoint our eyes with but if we come and we say we don't need it oh we're good we already see everything we already understand everything we already know everything and we don't put that 7 that's where Jesus said there's sin remaineth there's sin remaineth because they could look right at it and not see what once you scribes and Pharisees EPIK Ritz for you pay tithes of mint and anise and cumin and have omitted the weightier matters of the law judgment mercy and faith these ought you to have done and not to leave the other undone you blind guides which strain at a gnat and swallow a camel woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites before you make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter but within there full of extortion and excess thou blind Pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean also Jesus gets to the root of the problem as only he can and and when we focus on the outside we aren't being effective we're missing the most important things righteous judgment mercy of faith the most outwardly orderly churches are usually the ones lacking the most power of God brother Brian talked about that he compared the Baptist to the Pentecostals and he said you know the one you know is all no starchy and everything's in order and everything's perfect but the Spirit of God can't work there you know and the other has got so much of the Spirit of God but there's no order to it you know there has to be the balance between the two because otherwise you know they get off one way or the other the more you clean up the church the more order you get the more everybody's just doing exactly what they're supposed to be doing the less room there is for the Spirit of God to change it the more we get into our time schedules and our routines and everything else the harder it is for God to move us out of the way so that someone can get what they needed this morning the very presence of God was in their midst and I and I think about this is the very first part of that that we read and they bothered to ask Jesus why the disciples weren't washing their hands you know the Messiah was right there in front of them and that was their biggest concern he made me think of all the things that you could have asked God Almighty and the one you chose to ask is why the disciples didn't wash their hands it's just like a bit of a lost opportunity if you ask me you know just it seems like they maybe could have asked something that there would have been a little more beneficial to them but they were so concerned with church order they were so concerned with everything being exactly that way that that was the biggest issue on their minds sometimes we think that God chose us because we're so special because we have so many good qualities and and everything else like I'm sure they felt that you know God God chose them and purposed them because they were so righteous and holy but why did God choose fishermen and tax collectors you know what why would those Jesus disciples you know did he just forget about the Pharisees or the Sadducees of the scribes no he went and purposely chose people that nobody would have any confidence in that you know that nobody would say we're spiritual that nobody would would say oh man these are the elite you ain't found people that would just listen and respond to his call he could have called the Pharisees for hours and they wouldn't have come but he called out to Peter and said come follow me and Peter left his nets and when followed him you know he called out to to Matthew the tax collector and he came and followed him and so you know he knew they were going to frustrate him all the time you know you read Jesus interaction with the disciples it wasn't always a you know an easy road it wasn't always like oh wow Peter that was the most insightful thing you could have said no there was some get behind me Satan there were some there was some you know harsh words there were some ye of little faith there was all of those kinds of things as well but what Jesus was looking at was not at what they could bring him but how they could respond to what he would give them they were going to make mistakes all the time and in fact they would try the limits of divine patience but they were humble enough to learn to listen and to obey and that's what made the difference you know the Pharisees had gotten to a place although they look like they were honoring God where they really wouldn't listen to anything they wouldn't listen to anything that didn't support exactly what they were already doing you know and even the disciples you see when they got a little success behind them you know men that knew that they had done nothing but you know get a little success behind them and they started to think they were something you know they started to argue who's going to be the greatest you know who's gonna have the most compelling ministry who's gonna cast out the most Devils who's going to do that to the point they even prevented that boy being healed from epilepsy because they were arguing and fussing who should be the greatest God chose us he chose you because you would respond to his word because you could hear his voice and accept it and the greatest way we can honor him is to keep responding to his word keep accepting it you know and Jesus actually thanked the father that he had hidden truth from the wise and prudent you know and giving it to babes such as would learn that's why God chose us God chose because I'm so smart I couldn't no God chose because you were a baby oh that that doesn't sound very encouraging no he it is encouraging because he saw that you could be taught and you would take his word and you would listen to it and you would respond to it and you would grow up to live it out that's why God chose us because we were babies not because we were scholars let's go a little further woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites for you are like unto whited Sepulcher which indeed appear beautiful outward but with but are within full of dead men's bones and of all uncleanness even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men but within you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity woe unto you scribes and Pharisees hypocrites because you build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the simple curse of the righteous and say if we had been in the days of our fathers we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves that you are the children of them which killed the prophets fill you up then the measure of your father's you serpents you generation of vipers how can you escape the damnation of hell you know he wasn't he wasn't making the speech to the politicians you know he wasn't making this speech to the the prisoners in the prison he was making it to the most religious people of the day the most holy people of the day you know what a thing you know brother Branham came and he wasn't he wasn't speaking to the prisoners or the politicians either he was speaking to the preachers when he said I indict this generation you know he wasn't talking about he wasn't even talking about the lady he was talking about the preachers who should have known better because they were studying the word and they could see what was true but because their denomination didn't allow the flexibility of of the truth they would turn away from the truth because their denomination didn't allow for the correct baptism they would turn away from it because you know their denomination didn't allow for you know holiness it wouldn't allow for deliverance it wouldn't allow for miracles they would turn away from me and push God right out of the way every single generation has an easier time with the historical gospel than the present one it's interesting that in Jesus time they quoted Moses to Jesus all the time they said well Moses said and Moses gave us this and Moses was the one and you know you know you need to be following Moses law and always quoting Moses to him but when Moses was around they were chafing at every word that he said you know they were rebelling against every word that Moses said and then as Moses dies and passes off the scene and the longer Moses has been gone all of a sudden Moses quotes are the ones that everybody's using and everybody's justifying themselves to the point that Jesus is standing there in the flesh and they're still using Moses quotes against him that seems so strange in Jesus time they're yelling crucified but for an and it Moses this time they were trying to stone him but within in historical context looking back a few hundred years later they could say oh we're gonna we're going to support those quotes bring out those quotes that we liked you know share those ones those are the ones that we really appreciate we can't handle this present word and flesh and look what happened to Jesus you know Jesus and his his words were enough to stir up a crucifixion but how many people quote Jesus words today with no problem at all you know people that quote Jesus words today the parts they like anyway you know you'll hear lots of Jesus words you know read in churches this morning you know I said oh well that's just wonderful st. John 3:16 it's just you know God so loved the world you know all these things if you love one another and and then they'll share all of these quotes of Jesus but they couldn't stand Jesus in the flesh they couldn't stand him you know they couldn't stand the present word but they can take the historical word because they can pick and choose the things that they want you know of course after after Jesus is gone they're history they've lost that in-your-face quality you know now you can pick and choose which verses you want to highlight pick and choose which verses are important to you instead of have to sit there and listen to them say them right to your own ears Paul's words were the same way you know Paul Paul's words are accepted now in churches most of them anyway you know they leave certain things out you know we'll leave out what he said about homosexuals cuz you know you know we don't quite believe that here or we know well we'll leave out what he said here about the women cuz we don't quite believe that here but he preached a lot of good things about predestination and he he preached a lot of good things about you know faith and all that so you know we we have no problem with Paul's words but in in the time that Paul's given he he's getting kicked out of every single church he goes to you know you he would go and share these words that we say are so wonderful now and they would kick him out of the church they would say we don't want you here don't ever come back you know help him out the door stone him on the way out whatever you know make life as difficult as possible follow him from city to city poisoning the people of those cities he hasn't even spoken in yet to tell them don't listen to this guy don't you know don't have anything to do with him he's you know he's spreading false gospel that's what was happening in Paul's time as the word came out of present tense ministry but now when was the last time you saw something that said that don't don't read the you know writings of Paul don't you know don't know listen to those a little poison your mind now nobody says that now because so much time is nobody's throwing Paul in prison anymore that time has passed we praise Him and we praise the work you did in establishing the New Testament churches and but every new church age messenger fought the same battles you know fought the same battles in their present time that you know every time they would come and God anointed them with His Holy Spirit to speak the word that was necessary for their age and it created the same kind of problems with the present tense and yet everybody had a easy time with the historical gospel when people quoted Moses to Jesus they thought they were honoring the Prophet but they were actually dishonouring the present God you know when people you know quote Paul today and reject truth today they're doing the same thing because you can't honor one and dishonor the other it's all God's Word it's all truth people are doing the same thing today in our age now people are comfortable quoting brother Branham and still chafing at the present challenge of the Living God in his ministry today you know as the further we get from 1965 the easier it is to distance ourselves from the power of brother Rams ministry and take the quotes that we like you know in the wind the ways that we like things and the way the things that we agree with you know and the things that we have an easier time with and that's what we remember that's what we lift up that's a week's we rally around is those things that we agree with and the things that we support you know and all of those things and we grow more and more comfortable with brother Branham and we actually begin to dishonor God because we don't take the full things that he preached and live them we take the parts that we enjoy the most and we live them we get better at memorializing the highlights of his life teach the stories to our children point to what God is doing in our age by pointing back 50 years you know there's still a lot of people who who they're first you know when someone asks them what they believe you know and this is fine I guess in a way but but if the first thing that you tell someone that you believe is that God sent somebody 50 who passed away fifty years ago to lead a message then where's the present-day truth in your life you know where's Jesus Christ in that where is you know where is a living vibrant God today if everything that we're pointing to happened 50 years ago it's not any different than the way you know Jesus is being preached this morning as a man 2000 years ago instead of as a living God right now the more time that goes by the more focused we become on the past and the more that we're focused on the past the more that we miss what God is doing right now and what God has for us right now and what's still to be gained brother branham himself says in the message serves we would see Jesus he said and now if Hebrews 13:8 says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and I'm sure they here Baton Rouge were just as hungry to see Jesus as they were to see him then every man that's in his right mind and hears about the Lord Jesus he longs to see him oh when I was when I first heard of him when I was a boy I just couldn't hardly stand it I thought if he's God he always was God he always will be God so trying to put it off in some great time in the past or some great time that's coming on that's just the nature of man man is always praising God for what he did looking forward for what he's going to do and ignoring what he's doing that's just the nature of man it's always been that way and it still remains that way today you know it it's the truth brother Branham in his time was saying that but now we've done the same thing for brother branham's ministry you know if somebody comes and asked you where is truth today and you point back to 1965 you didn't answer their question their question is where is truth today you didn't ask where truth was 50 years ago you know you might as well you know open up the Bible and show him Paul's you know writings I say that's the truth it well but that was thousands of years ago that's right no where is truth today we ought to be able to point them right here right here let me show you where truth is right here it's right in my life if right in my home it's right in my church it's right it's right where I'm living it's in my prayers every day truth and life and power is right here today brother van was trying to show people a present God and now the message again has put God in the past and people are content to leave God there because it leaves them free to do whatever they want now the most uncomfortable God is a present God it's the most uncomfortable guy you know that's why it's really easy to have a God of stone or of wood or you know of your own making because it's a comfortable guy because he's never present with you you know you never have to worry that there's a real power that will make you uncomfortable a real power that will make you change because you know it's a comfortable God the most uncomfortable God is the real true Living God because he'll make you uncomfortable you go places where you shouldn't be you get uncomfortable you do things that you shouldn't do you get backslidden you get uncomfortable you you know you you know you're not where you should be you know that God's speaking to you it's a pretty uncomfortable place to be in you know you know that you've got to be praying you know you got to be reading then it's an uncomfortable thing because that God's trying to pull you and you're resisting there's a real tension there but a set of doctrines a code of conduct some good stories those are comfortable things things we can share with our families things that we can be settled in you know but take the words that that Jesus said and then the words that brother Brad said and the words that we these men have said and and live them out and they're just as powerful as they were in the day that they were spoken you know that's why we can sing that song you know ancient words because the words themselves are ancient but the God is still living present-tense God today you know they're they says that they're long preserved they're not preserved in a in a dusty falling apart sort of way they're preserved that when you read them and you absorb them they still have life and strength and power today and they can change your life today just like they could 2,000 years ago just like they could 50 years ago as long as we bring them into our life today and live them out Jesus gives this indication to us and it's not a happy one it says not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then I will profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine is interesting he goes from there right into the parable of the man who built his house on a rock and the van to build the house on the sand he said whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock that's a very powerful thought that Jesus said someone could be so totally convinced that they had done a work for the Lord and yet he didn't even know that how strange would that be that that they had they were so completely convinced that they had done this that they could stand in the presence of Almighty God and and you know boldly proclaim we did this and we did this and we did this for you she said I don't I don't know I I'm searching the memory banks but I'm just not coming up with anything I know I don't even know you who are you where where are you coming from what you know did we have an experience do we have a relationship and it turns out they didn't you know that's that's such a strange thing you know but the band tells us the story of the man that that went into the presence of God and and you know he he was confronted did you ever tell a lie you know did you ever steal did you ever do wrong and in that holy presence all he could do was say yes Lord yes Lord yes thought I did do those things I I did make these mistakes I did sin and yet these people are so determined that they did such a great work for the Lord and the Lord doesn't even know who they are he never had a relationship with them he never filled them with his spirit you know and and I believe that we're starting to see more and more in the message as we get into the second third fourth generation of people raised in the message we're seeing more and more people that believe they have all of God because they've adopted the lifestyle the lifestyle of the message you know for the ones that have come from the world or have come from denominations to to find Christ they know the difference they know where they used to be and where they are now they know what it was like to you know to be in sin and to be separated from God and to feel that you know God was nowhere near you and then to come into a position where you feel God you know he's a present God and he answers your prayer and you can contact him and and you know he's revealed himself to you but for our children growing up they've always felt like they're close to God they've always they've grown up in the presence of God they've grown up coming to church they've grown up hearing about God all of the time they've adopted the lifestyle of the church and they don't know what it is to forsake all and come to Christ because they feel they've been right where he's at their whole lives you know my girls are going to be 15 and 13 in the next couple months and you know they look the part of the message just like they should you know they they look like they their lives are just as holy as anybody else's and they're their hair has never been cut they've never been in a pair of pants they you know they've never put on any makeup and compared to the kids at school they look holy compared to some of the kids at church they look holy but in the eyes of God all of us for not if they don't have a personal relationship you know a living walk with Christ and I believe it's a challenge for our young people growing up to look in the mirror and see no makeup you know see the long hair see everything else and still realize I'm a sinner that needs salvation because our whole lives were taught that by being Christians it means that we're dressing the right way and looking the right way and acting the right way and so they see themselves doing those things and they think they got it and they haven't really given their heart over to Christ you know I'm very thankful my kids have come to that point and they've been baptized and they've they've seen that need in themselves and I just keep encouraging them you know keep pressing for a Holy Ghost experience you know keep the more brother Bama tells us it's not a mystery it's not some big complicated thing the more room you make for God the more room he's got to fill you know the more space that you you make for him the more space he's gonna occupy and so you know I keep pressing them that way the same way I do in my own life looking for opportunities where God can work in a greater way and me but I see that as gonna be a challenge more and more for our young people growing up for you know to see that hey I've already been doing everything right I've already know what is it to live this message it's to go to church and knock the right way and dress the right way and say the right things it's so much more than that it's so much more than and I certainly don't believe that our children need to go out into the world to discovery but I do believe it's a challenge and we need to be we need to be upper of up front and honest with them and say there's much more to serving God than you know putting on a suit and tie hug on Sunday morning there's so much more to serving God than just going to him when we need him but there's a love that develops when we realize all that he's given us all these put into our hands all these entrusted us with there's a love and a relationship that needs to be formed there they need to be filled to overflowing with the Holy Spirit just like we do you know and so I would say how do we get them to the Holy Ghost how do we get ourselves into the presence of God sometimes and not just into the routine well we do it by breaking up the by breaking up the routine don't just do the same things that we always do you know don't just come to church at the same time every day sitting the same pew you know say the same thing sing the same songs you know worship the same way shake the same hands and everything else break it up God wants to show us our true condition God wants us to change our ways God wants us you know to come in and have the day be passionate and vibrant and all of those things you know and sometimes we we try to keep them so much the same and I try to wind up for time but you know I appreciated by fire and I was tempted to preach it here but you know really God wants to sometimes come in we're trying to build everything and preserve it and keep it just right and God wants to come in and just burn it to the ground and that might sound crazy but but he does because he doesn't like it when we've got it all figured out he doesn't like it you know when we get formal and cold and we build our little space for ourselves this person doing six inches closer to me in church and you know that was my parking spot in them in the you know and and how am I gonna worship God in these conditions you know you wait where you know your brothers and sisters who who carry this message to get it here we're worshipping in caves and everything else and you're worried about the air conditioner about the fan or about his to otter is too cold or you know it's going too long or a man I wish you would hurry up all of those things and yet God's trying to burn those things out of us if you here this morning and you needed to to get through to God but we have built such a form around church and how it works that you don't feel like you could come and approach the altar and get prayed for you don't feel like you could come and just pour your heart out to God because what would people think of you and and you know everybody would want to go home and everybody you know if you have that kind of feeling then we've got to change something it shouldn't be that kind of place brother Brahim said a church as a hospital and if we need to come to the hospital you know what a horrible thing you'd walk into a hospital they go I don't think I could see the doctor in this situation you know he's it's not available you know it's just it's just too hard to get to the doctor what would be the point of the hospital but churches like that sometimes it's so hard to get through to the great physician because we've got such a structure that we work with all this is Wednesday night no we can't do prayer question you know we can't we can't get prayed for on Wednesday it's supposed to be a short service or you know we can't do this on this day we can't do this why what are we really here for Paul writes this out here in first Corinthians 3 says according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise masterbuilder I have laid the foundation and another buildeth thereon but it let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon for other foundation can no man lay than this laid which is Jesus Christ now if any man build upon this foundation gold silver precious stones wood hay or stubble every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed thank you brother by fire and the fire shall try every man's work what sort it is if any man's work abide which he has built thereupon he shall receive a reward if any man's work shall be burned he shall suffer loss but he himself shall be saved yes so as by fire and then he says know ye not that ye are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you If any man defile the temple of God him shall God destroy for the temple of God is holy which temple you are Paul tells us that he laid the foundation of the word but we have built upon it and God's gonna try it by fire you know if it was built with good materials if it was built with things that will endure the fire like gold and silver and precious stones then you're gonna have something of value there when that fire sweeps through and if you've built with wood hay and stubble things that are temporary and perish in the fire then you're gonna suffer loss you know and he doesn't make this a point of salvation he said yet he himself shall be saved but but he says if you want the measure of your life take heed what you're building take heed while you're building and like I said we try so hard to preserve what we've built because we don't we don't want to lose what we built we spent time and energy and things building our lives and constructing them a certain way you know and if we think about the fire coming through you know we don't want to be left with anything you know you've probably seen the wreckage of fire before and you know sweep through a neighborhood or sweep through a house and and there's just nothing left but ashes who wants to go through a - type experience no we don't but wouldn't it be better to go through it now you know I don't know if you guys are singing the song here we're saying oh I know the time is near when everything that I hold dear will lay before the holy consuming fire all my works and all my deeds and every press that all my knees will lay before the holy consuming fire the Holy Ghost is a consuming fire and our heart's desire should be to let that fire burn through our lives and see what's left on the foundation it would be terrible to spend your entire life building on this foundation and one day when judgment fire goes through realize man there's nothing left there's nothing left here I thought it was all you know good and I had done such a great job constructing it all and the fire went through and I don't have the joy that I thought I had I don't have the peace that I thought I have I didn't have the Holy Ghost like I thought I did or we could say Alaura burn burn holy spirit burn in me set my soul on fire you know I I might not look like the most spiritual person at the end of it I might not look like I got it all together at the end of it but I'll know where I stand before Almighty God I'll know what's left on this foundation and I won't have to wait until rapture morning to see if what I built was good enough I'll know now that it's good enough or I'll know now that it's lacking and I'll know what it takes to get there and I want to know more than anything else that the materials that I built with are the same materials that God's building with you go and look at what he's building that new city out of its out of gold silver and precious stones there's no description there of any gates of hey you know or any you know pillars of stubble you know or any wood in this or wouldn't that it's all gold silver and precious stones so if that's what he's building with say god that's what I want to be building with I want to be building with that I want to know that what I'm putting it down is just as eternal as what God's putting down and so I'd say to you don't resist the fire proving our life don't say why me God why am I going through this guy say thank you Lord for putting me through this and may I may I get some understanding through it all may there be a purpose revealed in my life you know may I may I be lifted to a higher condition by this because he wants us to know him by his Holy Ghost and power not just by the knowledge of his word Paul says that he says and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of Christ the righteousness which is of God by faith that I may know him and the power of his resurrection not honoring his resurrection but by the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings Auto like that part know the Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain the resurrection of the Dead we really need to come to that place where said God whatever it takes whatever it takes it doesn't it doesn't take me just come in and doing the same thing what does it take Lord that's what I want to have brother BAM talks about this message is a few quotes as a wrap-up he said I believe Paul said to know Christ is life and he knew him in the power of his resurrection not to know him by his word Wow he says to know him by word that's all right but that's a long ways from being sufficient to know him by word we got to know him by person of his resurrection you know the Word of God is quick and powerful it says the word you know if you were to take all of the scriptures about the Word of God the Word of God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God but we need to know him personally in the power of his resurrection we know an awful lot about him but we need to know him in the power of his resurrection and we don't do that on Easter morning we do that every morning we don't do that you know on special occasions we do it every not occasionally at all but frequently but the map says how in the in the Testament the Old Testament what a beautiful picture was given of his death burial and resurrection when a man had leprosy a type of sin when he was healed by God he offered two turtledoves they brought the doves or the pigeons out they pulled the head off one turned him over like this and bled the blood all over the living mate and they took the living mate to the window and turned him loose and as the living mate went flying his little wings he bathed the earth I lost my place bathed the earth with the blood of the dead mate crying holy holy holy unto the Lord the living mate the husband of the Church of God is Jesus Christ he says the living man is the dead mate who was killed on Calvary for a sacrifice for leprosy cleansing of sin and sickness and his life and the blood was poured out upon the church and she's a crossing the world today preaching the old time gospel holiness the power of his resurrection of the Spirit of Jesus Christ crying holy holy holy unto the Lord he is the virgin born no sex connected with it at all he is the son of the Living God there is my hopes there is my strength there is my faith built on that right there what are we doing we're flying we're saying holy holy holy our lives are testifying that that death and resurrection that was provided for us not of my righteousness Oh looking look how good I'm flying over here no but every wingbeat testifies that there was someone whose life is it took the place of mine whose life was given for me you know that my strength and my power and my my zeal and amaya conquering all comes from him Butler Branham says as we wrap up remember brother the deeper you dig the more water you're going to get that's right we don't want nothing shallow we want all God's got for us everything power of his resurrection yes sir we'll just keep digging oh my you know I trust that we're not honoring the erection just by coming to church this morning you know you've all been faithful and most of you been here every service and so god bless you for that but you know we're not honoring the resurrection by the clothes we wear or the doctrines we believe you know we're not honoring God just because we believe a message we're not honoring God because we believe he sent a prophet we're not honoring God in any of those things we're honoring God when our whole lives are consumed with him we're honoring him when our own lives are resurrected when the life that we live is a Holy Ghost life you know when we can never again be the people that we were you know we never again could go back to that some people live in this in this condition a long time and then they can somehow go right back into the world and fit in they could go join a denominational Church and fit in I can tell you I can never do that I can never do it and it's not because I'm strong it's because I'm not the same person I'm not the same person that I was you know we can never again be the people we were but our heart has been changed our spirit has been changed we have his spirit pushing ahead you know pushing us pushing us pushing us I don't know about you sometimes when I go through a low time and and I think I don't know how I can do this there's just something inside that just keeps pushing it's just something inside this just keeps leading you there and you can't give up if you tried because there's a different life inside of here that's the power of his resurrection I know there's lots of quotes I could have read this morning but the bad talks about you know when he comes to that place when that curtain of death is hanging over he wants to know that he's met God in the power of his resurrection and I believe that without a doubt we can have that place now we're not wondering what death holds for us one day we're not wondering what sickness holds for us and you know what happens if this doesn't go this way or what happens if I don't make it home this afternoon you know because I get killed in an accident or what happens and this kind of thing it should all be settled if we've come into the power of his resurrection if we're truly honoring his resurrection in our lives it's all settled his spirit is pushing us ahead to the only destination we can ever be satisfied with which is our eternal place at his side you know as I as I wrap up as the musicians come I would say that I've heard many times over the years people would say oh I just want to make it there you know if I could just make it to heaven I'll be happy but you know what you shouldn't be because that's not the place that God has for his bride God didn't set aside a place for his bride where he said if you would just make it here I'd be happy with you he said I haven't got a place for you in my throne and when you overcome there's a place for you right and by my side right as part of me and so God is not going to be happy with you if you just make it God is not gonna be happy with you if you just make it in by the skin of your teeth so to speak er you know you just happened to live outside the city somewhere you know he's got a special place for you and that's where he wants you to be and until you reach that place he's not satisfied so if he's not satisfied lets us not be satisfied let's let's make the most of everything that we can and I really believe that that's the biggest challenge for the Bride of Christ in this age is the world makes it very easy for us to slack off and to relax and to you know stop pressing because you know everything just calms and soothes us down but it's a challenge to keep fighting every day and say I'm not there yet I'm not there yet so I want to keep pressing in let's bow our heads Lord Jesus father I thank you so much for the attentiveness of the people this morning this little message but lord help us to recognize our true condition more than anything else Laura I don't want to come here this morning and put on any kind of airs like I'm more spiritual than I am Lord or that we're further down the road than than we really are but this morning Lord we just say you know our condition you know where we're at you know where we have many needs and lacks and all of those things father deal with us in our present condition deal with us like we really are and Lord may we confront those things ourselves may we have boldness to say thought I'm not where I should be but I sure want to be lord I I know that I need more of you and I'm going to be honest and open and say father come and fill me Lord if if there's someone here that doesn't have the Holy Ghost to smore and knows it father I pray you you'd reveal that to them and that you would show them the path to receive it law it's just trust in you it's repenting it's it's pouring out themselves that you could have a place in them Lord father whatever the situation is for our healing for our deliverance for our loved ones Lord may we come to you openly and honestly this morning and just say father there's no pretense here there's no there's no image there's no happy face that's gonna hide the truth but lord whatever we have need of Lord you are the answer to every need that we have you are the the solution to every problem and we just ask though you'd sweep over the building this morning and you would show us our condition and that you would meet us I thought as we come and say father we need you more than ever before we love you we're so thankful for what you've done for us I pray you just bless this church abundantly Lord I've I've seen such growth here in the time that we've come and visited Lord and and I just pray that you would just continue to bless them bus brother Gerald and strengthen him Lord inspire him may you just lift up the Saints here father that they could you know be closer to you each step of the day Lord we just commit all these things into your care in Jesus name let's stand together should we sing better Paul burn burn Holy Spirit all right let's sing that burn burn Holy Spirit burning me that's one yeah burn burn holy [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen praise the name of the Lord hey man I guess the brother left you're still sitting there to give me the opportunity to continue but we want to thank the Lord again for the word and again and wasn't brother Brandon kisser it was the Holy Ghost a man and he prayed regarding getting himself out of the way the powder got it to get himself out of the way to minister the word and he had to get himself more out of the way for the for the Lord to come in and to end a manifest at Omega ministry a man of Christ is earning the thoughts and intents of the heart God going back to the past the present the future God healing the sick and raising the dead he men get himself out of the way and now it's Christ in the bride to get to get us out of the way a man to get our flesh out of the way because that's the endurance between us and eternity is the flesh worryin amen because we can't take this we're into that in the glory with with him no no it's got to be a new body a man that's why that we are believing that the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be changed reign we're gonna be caught up with them to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord but we're going to receive again as the scripture says it says as if this time when I could be dissolved we've got one already waiting eternal in the heavens amen swingley in the change and the power of God said the dead in Christ are waiting on us and he said God is waiting on us what for to come to that perfect rapturing faith amen we come to that faith the daddy Christ's are going to come to us amen they're gonna be at the problem of guys that are going to be changed in the glorified bodies and appearing to us we're going to be instantly go to theophany and in into a glorified body and he said and there is I said let's find that quote where he said we were going to fellowship with each other and he supports a minute for a certain period of time and then we're going to look up and that pillar fire is going to be in the body called Jesus and we're going to rise to meet him amen as the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ and our bringing me and thank God for what the Holy Ghost reminded us of a man it's just not going to heaven there's not a fairytale he's got a place for us a million in nitrogen people think of the prophet of God mentioned it and he says not just getting over there instead of just from flying around on on clouds Easter than playing hearts no no there there's going to be those that have been playing harps maybe and maybe playing guitars and other instruments but the brighter Christ is going to sit with him in the throne amen we have got a position so I pray the grace of God help us brothers sister and we're going on to that position by the grace of God is he changing us not that we have been changed we are being changed and we will be changed by the grace of God the other thing is as a brother brother coming out of the nominations even to the message I'm in the message I'm in the message but I've kept telling you lately the devil is in the message too amen and knowing that the devil believes the message more than some believers because the Bible's the Bible tells us that he has come down with great wrath knowing his time his shirt he has seen what God has done and it's and it's EDIUS according to the scriptures the word he has seen what God has done and what God is doing and he knows what it whether the significance of it in his ministry in his life says to remember the devil believes the message knowing that it has given the devil the faith he has given Satan the faith to do what he's doing knowing is time he's short and he's got ran against against against God and against the children of God the seed of God and so on a million brothers getting is going to get worse and worse and worse you know yeah and not just politically and and moral there in the world is going to get worse and worse and worse spiritually and religiously amen it's going to get so bad I tell you and we're not very far from it it's gonna get so bad he said that if he didn't shorten time there'll be no flesh ain't a man that's how bad it's gonna get or you think oh they're gonna get to a place we're not gonna believe in God or they'll believe in God all right but not believe God amen and there they and brother the hours coming I preach them way back in 1984-85 in Virginia and I said hear it and I said and that was many years ago my brother brought it about the Prophet having having been here for now for over 50 years he's gone he's gone for over 50 years the seals have been open I love over 50 years almost 60 years and we are still here we are still here and I reminded them in 1985 they said listen I said after the bride is gone I said there's going to be still people here preaching God has sent Apophis amen because they'll miss the resurrection they'll miss the rapture amen and I don't know the one day something is going to really happen and it's going to shocked them is going to shock them into the reality that all the wraps from us already took place and the part of God says something to say to them yes and you missed it a man sir brother is not what God has done they didn't miss that they were still believing that there was no breach of that but what God is doing is he's taking the message of the hour the revelation of the word and he is bringing us to perfection for the resurrection and the rapture that he has bringing us to maturity so that we're going to act on the word as the baby was saved right here and he said for if ye love them which love you what reward have you a man and it says you do not do know or do not even the publicans the same and he went on and he said and he salute your brethren only and he said what do we need more than others brother I tell you this he said do not even the publicans so I'll turn to this rather it is it's it's got to go beyond just this having this right doctrine and I believe God sent a prophet and I believe this and I believe that whether it's got a it's got we got to let God can take control and bring us to maturity and sons and daughters of God we got a bit too mature not not mature but Allah believers are saying when I God did this God did this God did that but what's he doing God did this God today but what's he doing in your life well he brought me out of denomination and he brought me out of this it showed me that but what else is he doing and why did he do that it's all for a reason we were coming up because we're going somewhere amen and he and he said he specified where we're going and again the trophies were coming out of it out of Egypt it came out to go into the Promised Land oh I like what he was talking about John Taylor amen last night last night and Jen Kayla being an old man and he anything he went and took the whole area that was given to him whereas the others and the others went on and just just took a little bit of it and settle down and so on that's right amen conquering or settling don't settle down no we're gonna settle and that's to be in the throne it may have settle in the throne but I do until we get to that place we gotta we gotta conquer and conquer and conquer and we're conquer and if there's any one you've got to conquer the greatest and the most is yourself amen and the census of your flesh by the grace of Almighty God bringing that subject of the word and pressing and pressing and pressing on by the grace of God to the change of our bodies we're in a battle were in a war by the grace of Almighty God we are ordained we retain - cuz the Bible says we are more than conquerors why because Jesus fought the battle won the prize now Wuerffel we're we're running the race - and pressing on to obtain the price amen oh well I don't have to worry about it she's going to give it to me well then if Jesus to give it said brother he's got to overcome the flesh he's got to destroy this he's got to turn I overcome that in our lives by the grace of God so that we we are dead to ourselves dead to the flesh we got to present our bodies as living sacrifices a May let's be living for Jesus morning noon and night amen you think of it when you go anyway when you get up in the morning you're you're going to talk to him for the day you're going to talk to him and when you when you laid yourself down at night and pray the grace of God be with us let's just st. salute if you salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the public and so and then he said in verse 48 be therefore perfect even as your father which is heaven in evidence perfect and again I let it just recently that it is not a sinless perfection because the body is not sinless a man the soul is but not dividing we're new creatures on the inside of the inside but how am I going to be perfect as God in evidence perfect and our brother Scofield brings it out he said it is a it is a it is a spiritual maturity it should be mature as God is mature a man not religious babies a man no no no we got a mature we go ahead Paul Paul with Deanie with the Hebrews and he said I gotta feed you with milk I gotta give you milk I gotta give you milk he said why because they can't take the meat of the word and there are a lot of so-called believers that can't take the meat of the word Amen you've got to give a milk because they are babies he's suing he said when you and we got to go beyond that because again as the prophet said that God is not a grandpa and you don't have grandchildren and grandsons and granddaughters they got sons and daughters as father he we are his sons and daughters and God he in the person of Christ we are his brothers and sisters when it goes beyond that to being the bright Amen of the Lord Jesus Christ so let's be mature as God is mature amen to act on the world as God stands on his word and speaks his word amen not children going around you know doing this doing this doing his son and they've constantly got to be got to be corrected constantly got to do this no but after they reach a certain age they know Amen you train them you train them out they reach a certain age they won't do this they won't do that and they're going on to perfection by the grace of God and they're becoming perfect as mum and dad mature as well one day it is mature a man by the grace of God as it is in the natural suitors in the spiritual and we don't become mature there's something wrong with its mentally a man it's the grace of God that we're going to mature so that we're going to act on the word and we're going to take God Eddie's word they mean because we are mature let's not dishonor as our brother brought of the resurrection and let's not be a settler you don't get don't you well I'm going to settle in the message no you better not because you got to go on he brought that up we have you dig dig deeper you're going to get more water of the revealed word amen brother amen the power of God said the more you hear the tapes and the more you get into this and study this the more is going to be revealed a man and again I just said it recently if I were to God said I know it's not striking you the way that it should he said it's not striking me the way that it should but there's going to come a generation that it would strike the way that it should didn't strike them because the are was and then for the rapture and the resurrection God Elvis brother that man by the grace of God don't dishonor what God has done and why God has done it don't let still have this honor what God has done and what God is doing amen amen thank God for that for that word and that that warning today because many are dishonouring what God has done Oh many are dishonoring what God has done because with the Provident mistakes and they've all their mistakes amen we all got mistakes but the word of the Lord was perfect and they're deciding what God has done in their finding fault here finding fault they're finding fault with one another listen to prophet of God say one time he said I'd rather I'd rather he fell oh with a with a brother that's got wrong doctrine and he said in her right spirit he said then he said then fellowship with somebody that got right doctrine and a wrong spirit and I've been dealing with that for over 50 years believers they got great doctrines with wrong spirits a million and sometimes they're in denominational realms find individuals college they got a better spirit a man and better attitudes we got to keep our attitude right our spirits right the prophet of God said they said least he said if a man got a right spirit he said God can change his doctrine praise the name of the Lord so God elbows brothers sisters that we're going to mature as God is be perfect as God has purposed perfect being mature as God as mature is the maturity of godliness he said not sinless perfection but God maturity in accepting the word you can take correction you can take instruction in righteousness by the grace of God because you mature and you're recognizing your need for it thank the Lord other thoughts here that our brother mentioned but I won't comment on it we can maybe fellowship around as we go to our brother marks later this afternoon but again God looks at the heart not the flesh is not what we're saying is what we're believing in our souls now what's in our flesh is what's in our souls by the grace of Almighty God and God's race to us that we're not numbered with those who after the rapture will be still here preaching that God has sent a prophet failing what failing to mature in the revelation of the message that will take us on take us on to perfect faith for the rapture Bhama Gaza we got to come to this for the rapture and you know what he said in perfect faith that means a lot of breaking down for me the Prophet the Prophet he said it means a lot of breaking down for brother Neville the Deacons the elders so it means a lot of breaking down for us to come to perfect faith I tell you it's really a test of our love for him lovest thou me more than these what do you love most and then you know if you love him you want to get out of here and you want to be with him but I'll tell you most people don't want to leave this whole world or to content in it but I'll tell you that God's gonna let it a the poppet of God said the bride will not go into tribute or would not suffer death entry in this church age book but he said God's gonna let us be here for a while and he said he said we're going to be tested with persecution persecuted he said and then he said God take you home it's gonna bring out your love for him and that your willingness to sacrifice anything in everything for him oh but God is gonna bless me with this blessed with that the thing I want God to bless me with his eternal life the resurrection and the rapture that's the most important thing amen rather this Kiba keep his Commandments with love for him and if we love Him we will love the sons and daughters of God your brothers and sisters in Christ will have a right spirit and a right attitude by the grace of God and he read the scripture which told us that we are the temple of God let's remember it these other things that I could say but we'll we'll leave it at that just one mother scripture that he reference I like it brethren I count not myself to have apprehended God bless your brother thank God for reminding us of this word most we would think I said I don't have anything else to do now I'm ready you'll only know that when you get there yeah I was ready I count not myself I many have this attitude like Paulette I like what a bother but Paul last night tremendous the probably God he got so bad that he thought he thought that he well he did have a nervous breakdown and then even he got so bad even after the opening of the seals he thought he was losing his mind because he saw so much going on and did him with so many spirits brother like Paul we count not ourselves sort of apprehended what for to keep ourselves on our guard that's good brother thank God do we have that attitude in that spirit so we're always on our toes I kind of nod myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God the upward call of God in Christ Jesus and notice verse 15 he said let us therefore as many as be perfect amazing well I'm perfect if you are you've got this attitude in this spirit while you're in this place let as many as therefore as be perfect be thus minded and if in anything you be otherwise minded God shall reveal even this unto you a man again verse 10 that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the Fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the Dead God blesses that we're going to press on by the grace of God and thank the Lord for our brother Brendan and the Ministry of the word amen trusting that the Holy Spirit we will
