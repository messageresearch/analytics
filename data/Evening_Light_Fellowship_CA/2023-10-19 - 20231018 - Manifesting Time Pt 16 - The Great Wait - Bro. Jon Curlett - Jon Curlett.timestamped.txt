[38:46] Lord God lord would you just grant it
[38:48] tonight we pray Lord asking your grace
[38:50] for those that aren't here Lord the many
[38:53] needs Lord Jesus we pray your grace to

[38:57] it amen amen God bless you each one turn
[39:00] if you would to Second Peter chapter
[39:03] 1 amen God bless you it's good to be
[39:06] here tonight and good to have sister
[39:09] Moren and brother Mark back and they
[39:12] came and a bunch of people
[39:13] left amen but we're glad to have each
[39:16] one that could make it I know Raphael is
[39:17] sick tonight and so pray for him and
[39:20] sister Priscilla of course without
[39:21] brother Joe there it's always tough with
[39:23] a with a sick child so praying Grace and
[39:26] I spoke to the mighty Hunters today and
[39:28] they haven't uh been able to harvest
[39:30] anything but they did see one moose so
[39:33] uh they chased her and I guess my only
[39:35] question is did you chase her or did you
[39:36] chase her with a bullet because the
[39:38] bullet's the only thing that's going to
[39:39] work in those situations but anyways
[39:40] they're they finally saw an animal after
[39:42] some pretty bad weather the last few
[39:44] days so just keep them in prayer and I
[39:46] think brother Bob mentioned sister Erica
[39:48] Parker as well which is brother Donnie
[39:49] Reagan's daughter that passed away and
[39:52] she had two 18-year-old girls and two
[39:54] 16-year-old girls and then of course a
[39:56] husband as well so we want to remember
[39:58] that family in prayer and I mean
[40:00] honestly at 18 and 16 that's Grace that
[40:02] they got that far she's had a a troubled
[40:04] life she's had a lot of health issues
[40:06] through her life and and whatnot but uh
[40:09] just praying God to be with them amen
[40:10] that's a that's a tough thing to bury
[40:12] your child so we pray God will just
[40:14] Comfort them and be very real amen he's
[40:17] a he's a very present help in a ton time
[40:19] of trouble he's a comforter and uh and
[40:22] this is when they're really going to
[40:23] need it amen second Peter 1 very
[40:26] familiar scripture given we've been
[40:27] reading it every service verse four says
[40:30] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[40:32] great and precious promises that by
[40:34] these you might be partakers of the
[40:36] divine nature having escaped the
[40:38] corruption that is in the world through
[40:39] lust and beside this giving all
[40:42] diligence add to your faith virtue and
[40:44] to Virtue knowledge and to knowledge
[40:46] Temperance and to Temperance patience
[40:49] amen God bless you you can have your
[40:51] seats this evening and we're continuing
[40:53] again the series on manifesting time and
[40:55] I want to take take a title of the great
[40:57] weight amen the great weight not weig g
[41:00] HT but W AIT T the great weight and
[41:04] we're speaking on this great attribute
[41:05] of patience and as I was studying on
[41:07] this I kind of thought of the great race
[41:09] we run as Believers and it is a race
[41:11] Paul said we're running a race and yet
[41:13] this race has a lot of walking and it
[41:15] has a lot of standing still and it has a
[41:17] lot of waiting as well amen so I thought
[41:19] that as I just take that title of the
[41:21] great weight because so often we're
[41:23] racing but we're not racing ahead but
[41:25] rather it's a distance it's an endurance
[41:27] event and that's really where patience
[41:29] comes into it brother Brandon would
[41:30] start off in the Statue of a perfect man
[41:32] and he would say then after that
[41:34] fourthly you want to add patience to
[41:36] your faith if you've got faith it
[41:38] worketh patience the Bible said he says
[41:41] now that's the next thing is going to
[41:42] build this stature and then he says you
[41:44] know God has got real material in his
[41:47] building and brother Bron would say time
[41:48] and time again he talk about that
[41:50] Blackbird that was taking peacock
[41:52] feathers and putting it in and he says
[41:53] that's not going to ever work as soon as
[41:56] you put it in any sort of wind as soon
[41:57] as you try and fly as soon as you try
[41:59] and replicate what a peacock is it'll
[42:01] fall off because it's not a part of you
[42:03] and he's saying here God's got real
[42:05] material in his building you know I
[42:07] spent a lot of time of course as an
[42:08] engineer with materials and you'll find
[42:10] out that there's a specification that's
[42:13] required for every design and to make
[42:15] sure they get the right material they
[42:16] test it and there's a quality assurance
[42:19] and there's a there's a package that
[42:20] comes with every piece of material to
[42:22] prove that that material is exactly
[42:25] that's as good or better than what you
[42:26] asked for and God's doing the same thing
[42:28] with this building is that he's building
[42:30] us into something that's using real
[42:32] materials you know if you ever have
[42:35] replaced a part you know I work on my
[42:36] car sometimes and if you've ever taken a
[42:39] part that's broken and it'll last you
[42:41] 100 or 150,000 km and then because we
[42:44] want to save money we go and we buy a
[42:46] cheap part that's a half the price of
[42:48] the original part and we stick it in the
[42:50] car and it breaks after 20,000 km you
[42:53] know why cuz it's not built to the
[42:55] original specification it's not the real
[42:57] deal if they didn't put the care into it
[42:59] that the original designer did and so
[43:01] the part fails even sooner than the
[43:03] original does why because it doesn't
[43:04] have the real material they didn't know
[43:06] what they had to put into it and it's
[43:07] the same thing with God God's not going
[43:09] to let us sit there and just say we are
[43:10] it or we've got it God's going to prove
[43:13] the material that's in the building of
[43:15] the Tabernacle that he wants to inhabit
[43:16] in our lives he says see how short we
[43:19] are brother and sister see where we're
[43:21] at we have glories we have shouts and
[43:23] things because we've got faith but when
[43:25] we come down to these things here God
[43:27] can't build us into that stature he
[43:28] can't make us up to that kind of a place
[43:31] we got all these other things the
[43:32] glories the shouts and things he says
[43:34] but we fall and we slide off with it see
[43:36] he can't build his church brother B
[43:38] would say time and time not just in this
[43:40] message but in many others he says you
[43:42] can't fake your Christianity you can't
[43:44] fake it you can you can ex you can try
[43:47] and present it and you can try and
[43:48] testify of it and you can try and talk
[43:50] it and you can try and walk it but when
[43:52] the rubber meets the road when the hard
[43:54] times come then the fake and the make
[43:56] believer always fall apart they always
[43:58] do because there's nothing real to hold
[44:00] up they're not built of the right stuff
[44:02] amen and the scripture tells us that the
[44:04] trials of this life are more precious to
[44:06] us than gold because they prove who God
[44:09] is and they prove who we are at the same
[44:12] time and we get to see what he's doing
[44:13] in our life and we get to see that we've
[44:15] actually got what we believe we've got
[44:17] you know we've got a life full of Faith
[44:19] Like brother BR would say we've got all
[44:20] this Faith but until that faith is
[44:22] tested is it really Faith how do we know
[44:24] what we believe until our faith is put
[44:25] to the test test and brother BR would
[44:27] tie the trying of our faith to patience
[44:29] and he would tie to that scripture now
[44:31] that word patience means endurance
[44:34] steadfastness constancy perseverance the
[44:38] ability to remain without changing
[44:41] regardless of circumstance and we know
[44:43] that this whole thing that we're talking
[44:45] about these the statue of a perfect man
[44:47] is a building process and we start on
[44:49] the foundation of faith and we have
[44:51] virtue and knowledge and Temperance like
[44:52] we spoke on last service but now we come
[44:55] to patience and brother BR would say
[44:56] this patience is not just built on but
[44:58] it's tied to something you have before
[45:01] so if you don't and say it's faith and
[45:02] if you don't have faith you can't have
[45:05] patience without the faith then the
[45:07] patience isn't going to work so how do
[45:09] we know we've got patience in this
[45:10] Earthly Tabernacle James would say this
[45:13] he says my brethren count it all joy
[45:16] when you fall into diverse
[45:18] Temptations this is going to be one of
[45:19] those Services we
[45:21] love but I'm looking for the day where I
[45:24] can have joy in the trial rather than
[45:27] after the trial because so often what
[45:30] happens is we come to the end and God
[45:32] comes through and we finally see the big
[45:34] picture and then we shout and we praise
[45:36] and we have our Hallelujah moment James
[45:38] says we're supposed to be doing that in
[45:39] the midst of the trial why because
[45:41] you're a child of God and God works all
[45:44] things for your good so when you're in
[45:46] the middle of it it's doing something to
[45:49] you it's preparing that material it's
[45:51] making you to the specification that God
[45:53] wants you to be and you can rejoice
[45:56] because you're going to come out better
[45:57] than you went in you'll come out purer
[45:59] than you went in you'll come out
[46:00] stronger than you went in you'll come
[46:02] out more fit for service than you went
[46:04] in and you can Rejoice because he's
[46:05] building you up now sometimes he's got
[46:08] to take you out he's got to strip those
[46:10] impurities out he's got to put you
[46:12] through a process a purifying process
[46:14] that makes you more qualified than
[46:16] before but James says we're supposed to
[46:17] be in joy in the midst of the
[46:21] trial what an attitude that ought to be
[46:23] as a believer that when we're going
[46:25] through we can say praise the
[46:27] Lord he's working on
[46:30] me he says knowing this this is why
[46:34] we're joyful he says that the Trine of
[46:36] your PA Faith worketh patience that word
[46:39] worketh means it brings out or it
[46:41] produces or approves patience so the
[46:44] trying of your faith produces patience
[46:48] but what happens with that patience he
[46:50] says but let patience have her perfect
[46:53] work oh there's a perfect affection that
[46:56] comes with patience it does the whole
[46:59] thing it doesn't let you out unfinished
[47:01] it doesn't let you out before the
[47:03] process has had its full effect it says
[47:05] let patience have our perfect work that
[47:08] ye may be perfect and entire wanting
[47:11] nothing I want to be to the place where
[47:14] I want nothing where he has given me
[47:16] everything that I need for this journey
[47:18] through life that means I've got to have
[47:19] patience and then I've got to let
[47:21] patience do its work let it have its
[47:23] effect patience is built on faith and
[47:26] James would tie the trying and testing
[47:28] of your faith to producing and then
[47:31] proving patience that tells me that if I
[47:33] try to go through a trial without faith
[47:36] I'll never have patience because Faith
[47:39] produces patience but if I just try and
[47:41] say oh yeah I've got patience but I
[47:43] don't have faith that God has called me
[47:45] to go through it then I'm going to fall
[47:46] short every single time but I've got to
[47:48] know that sons of God are led by the
[47:51] spirit of God and that if he's led me
[47:53] into it then there's going to be
[47:54] patience to take me all the way through
[47:55] there's a faith behind it amen otherwise
[47:58] I'm going to get overwhelmed I'm going
[47:59] to get run over I'm just going to get
[48:01] flattened by the situation and I'll be
[48:03] sitting there on the sideline saying I
[48:04] thought I was a Believer no I've got to
[48:07] have a revelation of who I am and I've
[48:09] got to have a revelation that I'm in the
[48:10] will of God brother Braham says we need
[48:12] more Revelation what Revelation that
[48:15] it's for our good Revelation that he's
[48:17] in the
[48:18] situation let's take it to a couple
[48:20] examples that brother Brown would preach
[48:22] on he would say in Hebrews he'd
[48:23] reference this he says for when God made
[48:25] promised to Abraham because he could
[48:27] swear by no greater he swear by himself
[48:30] sh saying surely blessing I Will Bless
[48:33] thee and multiplying I will multiply
[48:35] thee and then so after he had patiently
[48:38] endured he obtained the promise now
[48:41] there's a trend we're going to see in
[48:42] scripture God gives the promise you
[48:44] endure and then you get the promise
[48:46] promise there's a gap between what he
[48:49] says and when he does it so I you know I
[48:54] hate not hate but I apologize maybe for
[48:57] bringing up Abraham in so many of these
[48:59] things because Abraham makes us groan
[49:02] every time we preach on him because
[49:04] everything took long for Abraham 25
[49:08] years to get the core promise that God
[49:10] had promised him and he never got to see
[49:12] the fullness he got to see the start but
[49:15] he didn't get to see the Finish we look
[49:16] at Joseph and Joseph goes through years
[49:19] and years and years of trial before the
[49:22] vision comes to pass and I don't want to
[49:24] make you think that everything takes a
[49:26] long time like that not everything takes
[49:28] decades but God does have a gap between
[49:31] the start and the finish and the Gap is
[49:34] the trial of our faith and the trial of
[49:35] our faith produces patience to get us to
[49:37] the end that's what we're talking about
[49:40] you know I I'm so happy today I'm not in
[49:42] University I'm so happy that I've I've
[49:45] passed all my professional exams I'm so
[49:47] happy of that last day I wrote that last
[49:49] 8 Hour exam in Texas and then I walked
[49:52] out knowing that I had in all
[49:54] probability passed and I would never
[49:55] never have to write another test in this
[49:58] life but before I did that test I had
[50:01] six years of engineering school and as I
[50:04] was going through that you write a lot
[50:06] of tests and you're you're you're you're
[50:09] poorest Church mice you're driving an
[50:12] old rusty Volkswagen Golf you you're
[50:14] you're scrimping by on everything and
[50:17] you look around and you can see people
[50:19] that don't give that that that that
[50:22] sacrifice and they're going and they're
[50:23] going and getting jobs and they're going
[50:25] on vacations and they're buying homes
[50:27] and they're buying vehicles and they
[50:29] don't have to scrimp and save and you
[50:30] say why is it they get that and I'm
[50:33] stuck doing this but I've made the
[50:35] choice to go through the trial because
[50:37] there's something at the end that I
[50:39] consider to be worth more than what
[50:40] they've got without going through that
[50:42] trial so I go had to go through all
[50:45] those things and it was what to get me
[50:47] to a place where I am today whereby
[50:49] God's grace we can live on a single
[50:51] income income my wife doesn't have to
[50:53] work where I've got good job prospects
[50:56] that's the grace of God don't get me
[50:57] wrong I'm not putting anything on myself
[50:59] but I'm pointing to the trial and the
[51:01] patience that I had to go through while
[51:03] seeing others prosper in the way that
[51:04] they chose while I stayed poor what
[51:07] trusting that the riches and the reward
[51:09] would catch up in the end and it would
[51:11] be as good or better than what they have
[51:13] received I did it with purpose and we've
[51:15] got to look at our Christian walk the
[51:17] same way that we're going to choose to
[51:19] stay with the word and it's going to
[51:21] test us and it's going to try us but
[51:23] we're doing it because we know that
[51:25] there's a reward at the end there's a
[51:26] benefit and what is it it's it's a
[51:28] perfect character of Christ and me it's
[51:31] the very Life of Christ that's going
[51:32] through
[51:33] us but I had to see that that that the
[51:36] endurance of the testing was going to
[51:38] end at some
[51:39] point to know because if somebody told
[51:42] me to be an engineer you have to go the
[51:43] rest of your life and testing I would
[51:45] have said that's not worth it the stress
[51:46] isn't worth it but I knew if I put in my
[51:48] six years and then a year or two after
[51:50] that then it would all be done and I
[51:51] could relax more or less and just cruise
[51:54] through my career with the same basic
[51:57] stresses of everyone else but the
[51:58] testing would really be
[52:00] over but that was me having to prove
[52:03] that I could go through it but God does
[52:06] it a different way because God says I've
[52:08] called you and I've chosen you and he
[52:10] gives us a word that lets us see the
[52:12] guarantee of the end before we ever go
[52:15] through the test and man we get to you
[52:18] remember that old Cathedral Song they'd
[52:19] sing I've read the back of the book and
[52:21] we win we've read the book and we won
[52:24] not we will win we've already won it's a
[52:26] finished work but there's a trial in
[52:28] between that's going to have patience
[52:30] involved in us and we've got to stay the
[52:32] course because we've read the book and
[52:34] we believed it enough to let it change
[52:36] our lives to live our lives according to
[52:38] it amen his patience will take us
[52:41] through to the end but it's one thing to
[52:43] read it it's another to believe it
[52:45] enough to let it have an effect in your
[52:46] life brother B would say this he's
[52:49] talking about patience now he says
[52:51] patience with what what kind of patience
[52:53] first thing is have patience with God he
[52:57] says if you've got real genuine faith
[52:59] you'll have real genuine patience
[53:01] because Faith worketh patience When God
[53:04] says anything you believe it that's all
[53:07] you got patience say well I asked him
[53:09] last night to heal me and I'm just as
[53:10] sick this morning oh my what patience
[53:13] God told Abraham and 25 years later
[53:16] there wasn't even one sign but he was
[53:18] still believing he was patient with God
[53:22] Abraham had a special kind of patience
[53:24] because every year he could see his body
[53:27] deteriorating he could see himself
[53:29] getting older he could see Sarah getting
[53:31] older and more frail and get to the
[53:33] point where she's 89 and he's 99 and
[53:36] still there's no change that's a special
[53:37] kind of patience that he had but he was
[53:40] still believing the prophet of God says
[53:42] but now if we take it over to Noah which
[53:43] is the second example brother Brown
[53:45] takes Noah's building an ark for 120
[53:47] years and Noah's patience is first in
[53:50] his
[53:51] commission it does he believe that God
[53:53] met him that God spoke to him and that
[53:55] he heard the literal voice of God and
[53:57] that God gave him a plan so for 120
[54:00] years Noah's tested will you stay with
[54:02] it even though people are making fun of
[54:04] you you're losing friends maybe you're
[54:05] losing family you're you're you're
[54:07] ridiculed by so many people you're on
[54:09] the evening news on a regular
[54:11] basis will you stay true to it but watch
[54:14] brother brandham takes it now even
[54:16] further because he says Noah had real
[54:18] Godly patience God said I'm going to
[54:20] destroy this world with rain and Noah
[54:22] preached 120 years yet plenty of
[54:25] patience and not even Dew fell from
[54:27] heaven wasn't nothing just as Dusty As
[54:29] It Ever Was for 120 years but he was
[54:32] patient he was patient for 127 years he
[54:36] says and then God tries your
[54:39] patience God knows how to tighten the
[54:43] screws what's he doing he's making real
[54:46] material and then he's proven it's the
[54:48] real deal cuz having tested for Noah for
[54:51] 120 years now he tests him all over
[54:54] again he he says that's right God tries
[54:56] them after he told Noah now he said Noah
[54:58] I want you to go ahead get in the ark
[55:00] I'm going to run the animals in there
[55:01] and I want you to get in I want you to
[55:03] tell these people tomorrow what I've
[55:05] been preaching for 120 years is going to
[55:07] take place all right you go down there
[55:09] and tell them he says what was the first
[55:11] sign Noah got in the ark there's got to
[55:16] come a day where it's not just words but
[55:19] our life is on the line our kids are on
[55:21] the line our careers are on the line our
[55:23] finances are on the line well Whole Hog
[55:26] in right fully committed see while he
[55:30] was building it he could walk
[55:32] away but God said you get in and then
[55:35] I'll shut the door and there ain't no
[55:37] getting out after that you got to stay
[55:39] with the word you're going to live or
[55:41] die by your decision to get into that
[55:43] Ark and he had to stay in that Ark and
[55:46] listen we see the ridicule that he went
[55:47] through he says there wasn't no rain
[55:51] Noah got ready got the rain coat on and
[55:53] everything so he could look out once in
[55:54] a a while he got ready but the next day
[55:57] he says I believe he might have told his
[55:59] family and his daughter-in-laws and all
[56:01] them said oh my tomorrow you're going to
[56:02] see something you ain't never seen
[56:04] because all over the skies they're going
[56:06] to be black and thunder and lightning is
[56:08] going to take place God's big sword is
[56:10] going to zip through the sky he's going
[56:12] to condemn these bunch of Sinners that's
[56:13] turned us down for this 120 years you
[56:16] just watch and
[56:20] see next day instead of a black cow here
[56:23] come the sun coming up just like it
[56:25] always did he's trying the
[56:28] patience Noah looked out said hey there
[56:30] ain't no Cloud but Noah he had patience
[56:33] said if it didn't come today it'll be
[56:35] here tomorrow why cuz God said so when
[56:38] did he tell you that Noah 120 years ago
[56:42] I've come this far so I'm just waiting
[56:44] here he says see that see after a while
[56:48] what don't throw away all that you've
[56:50] done with a knee-jerk
[56:52] reaction oh I did it all and now he's
[56:55] disappointed me again I'm using air
[56:57] quotes he's disappointed me again he
[56:59] didn't come through again listen you
[57:00] spent 120 years you spent your whole
[57:03] life believing and you let one little
[57:05] thing knock you off and you wasted all
[57:08] of that Faith you wasted all of that
[57:10] patience you wasted all of that
[57:11] testifying you wasted all of that
[57:13] confession why CU you feel God let you
[57:16] down no no no he says Noah waited the
[57:20] fourth day passed no rain it's all right
[57:22] it's going to happen I can hear Mrs Noah
[57:24] come around say Dad are you sure he says
[57:26] don't talk like that he had patience cuz
[57:29] he had Faith he had virtue he had
[57:33] knowledge that God was right he had
[57:36] Temperance he didn't fly loose and say
[57:38] well I don't know what it's all about I
[57:40] lost all my popularity out there no no
[57:42] no people don't care for me no more I'll
[57:44] go out there and start all over New
[57:46] again no no he had patience God promised
[57:49] God will do it God will do it cuz God
[57:52] said so what a place to stand
[57:55] what a place to stand the door's closed
[57:58] you think it's done it's ready to go and
[58:00] then nothing happens for seven
[58:02] days he says now when you get that way
[58:05] add it but if you ain't got it that way
[58:06] don't try and add it it won't work it
[58:08] won't work on healing it won't work on
[58:10] nothing else see it's got to blend in
[58:12] with the same material it's vulcanized
[58:14] to for those that weren't heard
[58:15] vulcanization is when you take a rubber
[58:17] rubber and you put it on rubber but
[58:19] instead of just doing a cold patch or
[58:21] you just put some some adhesive there
[58:22] you put it under heat and pressure and
[58:24] when you apply that it melts that rubber
[58:26] in until it becomes one with the
[58:27] original and you can't separate the two
[58:30] he says that's right got to add to it
[58:32] patience with God's promise Noah
[58:34] believed it and he had patience with God
[58:37] 120 years notice how Noah had Faith to
[58:40] obey he had virtue to keep him going he
[58:42] had strength to produce the ark then he
[58:44] had knowledge that God was going to do
[58:46] something because God came down and said
[58:48] Now's the Time and then he had patience
[58:50] to wait until God's knowledge came to
[58:51] pass in his life but now Moses brother
[58:55] BR would jump over to Moses and we'll
[58:56] see the exact same pattern here he says
[58:58] Moses had patience with God yes sir he
[59:01] said Moses I've heard the Cry of my
[59:03] people I've seen their Affliction I'm
[59:05] coming down to deliver them and I'm
[59:06] going to send you down and the little
[59:08] contrast there between him and God and
[59:11] God showed him his glory he's talking
[59:12] about the little event there at the
[59:14] burning bush so Moses said here I go
[59:17] when he had once seen the glory of God
[59:19] you see he had Faith now watch the SE
[59:22] sequence now God started him with faith
[59:24] and he built him up from there why cuz
[59:27] without faith you'll never have patience
[59:29] you'll have good intentions you'll have
[59:30] all this motivation you'll have your
[59:31] Hallelujah moment but without faith you
[59:33] won't have enough to go all the way
[59:34] through to the end why because Faith's
[59:36] the foundation he starts them with faith
[59:38] and he builds them up to patience now he
[59:40] got down there to Egypt he come out
[59:43] there and said the Lord God said let my
[59:45] people go Pharaoh I want you to know
[59:47] this I've come as a representative of
[59:48] God you must obey me Pharaoh said obey
[59:52] do you know who I am I'm Pharaoh obey
[59:54] you as slave he said yes you'll obey me
[59:57] or perish you'll either do one you want
[1:00:00] to he says why he knew what he is
[1:00:02] talking about how God had proved it on
[1:00:04] the back side of the desert one-on-one
[1:00:06] he proved himself to Moses and he said
[1:00:08] Moses go out and do this in front of
[1:00:10] them and it'll take you out take this
[1:00:12] staff and take the sign in the hand and
[1:00:14] these different things and go out and
[1:00:15] I'll prove who you are and I'll prove
[1:00:17] who I am Moses had a commission and he
[1:00:20] has to go down there and he talked to
[1:00:22] God he had Faith he knew where he was he
[1:00:24] says he had a commission he was down
[1:00:26] there he says he knew what he was
[1:00:28] talking about he talked to God he had
[1:00:30] Faith he knew where he was at you want
[1:00:32] me to obey you get out of here Moses
[1:00:35] said I'll show you and Pharaoh says show
[1:00:37] me a sign he threw a stick down and it
[1:00:40] turned into a serpent why Pharaoh said
[1:00:43] that cheap magician trick come down here
[1:00:44] a minute come here you Janice and jam
[1:00:46] throw your sticks down they threw them
[1:00:48] down and they turned into a serpent he
[1:00:51] said now you cheap thing you come down
[1:00:52] here to me an Egyptian a pharaoh of
[1:00:54] Egypt Egypt you come down here with some
[1:00:55] of your cheap cheap magician tricks some
[1:00:57] of your hoaxes he said well we can do
[1:01:00] the same thing you
[1:01:01] do we we're we're looking for change in
[1:01:04] our lives we're looking for the
[1:01:06] Supernatural and we're always going to
[1:01:08] face naysayers and we're always going to
[1:01:10] face copycats and we're always going to
[1:01:11] face people that say we can produce the
[1:01:13] same thing you do and guess what in many
[1:01:16] cases they can for a while for a while I
[1:01:21] I remember and I won't mention names but
[1:01:24] just some people I know that that the
[1:01:26] husband was was struggling in his role
[1:01:28] and this isn't a Believer by the way and
[1:01:30] and they were having marital issues and
[1:01:32] what not he went to a psychologist or a
[1:01:35] psychiatrist and they got him all
[1:01:36] straightened
[1:01:38] out but didn't save his first
[1:01:41] marriage but now he's working on a
[1:01:43] second one and we'll see how that one
[1:01:44] turns out but they'll give you those
[1:01:45] results they they'll take you to to to
[1:01:48] alcoholic synonymous the they'll run you
[1:01:50] through the 10 or 12 steps or many it is
[1:01:52] and try and get you to the place where
[1:01:53] you think you're not not an alcoholic
[1:01:55] but without a new birth without a nature
[1:01:57] change you're going to keep running back
[1:01:59] and that's eventually what
[1:02:01] happens Romans 5:3 says this and not
[1:02:04] only so but we Glory we rejoice in
[1:02:08] tribulations also knowing that
[1:02:09] tribulation worketh
[1:02:12] patience it says and patience Works
[1:02:15] experience if you're patient and God
[1:02:17] ansers you'll be better able to be
[1:02:19] patient the next time God will build us
[1:02:21] up remember I was talking about the
[1:02:23] squirrels with brother brandom the first
[1:02:24] time the squirrel that he called out it
[1:02:26] came out in the right away right where
[1:02:28] he said and the second one did but the
[1:02:29] third one he had to wait and then the
[1:02:31] next day the first one took a while the
[1:02:32] second one really took a while and the
[1:02:33] third one didn't show up till the very
[1:02:35] very end and God had to challenge him on
[1:02:37] it God was building him up in that
[1:02:39] patience building him up to trust what
[1:02:41] God was doing with him to bring him to
[1:02:43] that it says now patience it it works
[1:02:46] experience it develops experience and
[1:02:48] experience develops hope cuz once God
[1:02:51] has answered you one time you'll believe
[1:02:52] the next time and you'll be able to hold
[1:02:54] hold on longer and longer and longer and
[1:02:56] that experience turns into hope which is
[1:02:58] expectation that today is the day that's
[1:03:01] what hope is and hope is if it's not
[1:03:03] today it'll be tomorrow and if it's not
[1:03:04] tomorrow it'll be the next day and the
[1:03:06] Hope keeps going because what you've got
[1:03:08] experience that God answers prayer am
[1:03:11] but we Face naysayers and it's amazing
[1:03:13] today how people think that we're crazy
[1:03:15] and they do think we're
[1:03:17] crazy but yet we look at how they've
[1:03:20] been managing the world for 6,000 years
[1:03:23] and we see the fruit of it and yet we're
[1:03:25] crazy for wanting something different it
[1:03:28] it's kind of amazing because we can
[1:03:30] literally see the result of their
[1:03:32] choices we can see the result of their
[1:03:34] religion and what does it look like
[1:03:35] death and destruction and we say we want
[1:03:38] no part of it and they say you're
[1:03:40] crazy but Moses now he's in the line of
[1:03:43] duty he's got a direct commission and
[1:03:45] yet he goes and he does exactly what God
[1:03:47] tells him to do and Janice and jamre
[1:03:49] produce the exact same signs and wonders
[1:03:51] as Moses
[1:03:52] did how disappointed could Moses have
[1:03:55] felt how betrayed could he have felt God
[1:03:58] I did something that was Supernatural
[1:03:59] and then they did the exact same
[1:04:01] thing he has a right carnally speaking
[1:04:05] to be
[1:04:06] disappointed but Moses wasn't
[1:04:08] disappointed Moses wasn't worried Moses
[1:04:12] wasn't afraid Moses just stood still
[1:04:15] that's all Moses did was he stood still
[1:04:18] why cuz he had done what God told him to
[1:04:20] do that's the only requirement that
[1:04:22] we're supposed to have is do what God
[1:04:25] tells us to do it's up to him to produce
[1:04:27] the results it's up to him to back up
[1:04:29] his
[1:04:30] word that's all Moses just had to stand
[1:04:36] there listen Ecclesiastes 78 says this
[1:04:40] it says better is the end of a thing
[1:04:43] than the beginning thereof in other
[1:04:46] words you have greater proof at the end
[1:04:48] of what something was than at the
[1:04:50] beginning David versus Goliath the
[1:04:53] beginning looked like it was in
[1:04:54] Goliath's favor and yet David's the last
[1:04:56] one standing when it's all said and done
[1:04:58] why the end is the proof not the
[1:05:01] beginning and then he comes and he says
[1:05:04] and the patient in spirit is better than
[1:05:06] the proud in spirit now being patient
[1:05:09] with God is better than being proud of
[1:05:11] what God's done you know we can get
[1:05:13] lifted up when God does something for us
[1:05:15] sometimes we can we can get caught up in
[1:05:18] gifts we can get caught up in blessings
[1:05:20] we can get caught up in provision and
[1:05:22] think it's something about us but that's
[1:05:23] not what's going to hold us because
[1:05:25] Pride elevates me patience elevates God
[1:05:28] cuz patience says this is all God's
[1:05:30] doing Pride says it was because of me so
[1:05:33] it's better to be patient in spirit than
[1:05:36] the proud in spirit so listen to this
[1:05:38] brother BR continue he says now what
[1:05:40] about Moses he didn't say Oh Mr Pharaoh
[1:05:42] I'm sorry sir I'll be your slave no sir
[1:05:45] he stood still amen stay right there God
[1:05:49] said just no doubt in his heart hold
[1:05:51] your peace and I'll show you something
[1:05:53] when you've done exactly what he said do
[1:05:56] seems like it went wrong it went wrong
[1:06:01] my kids have left my relationship's
[1:06:03] crumbling I've lost my job there ain't
[1:06:06] money in the
[1:06:07] bank
[1:06:09] seems Seems like something went wrong he
[1:06:13] says stand still and be patient Moses
[1:06:17] said you know what when I laid on that
[1:06:19] Foundation there was patience laid on
[1:06:21] there so I'll just wait and see what God
[1:06:24] will
[1:06:25] do having done all to stand
[1:06:29] stand what's he doing saying stay with
[1:06:32] the word and let God do his part your
[1:06:35] part's to do it his part's to back it up
[1:06:38] he says there are the old serpents were
[1:06:40] crawling around blowing hissing at one
[1:06:42] another and he says the first thing you
[1:06:44] know Moses serpent went gulp gulp Gulp
[1:06:46] and gulped them all down he had
[1:06:49] patience remember brother Ram says what
[1:06:51] do we have to do have patience with God
[1:06:54] what have patience to give God a chance
[1:06:56] to prove he's God and to prove that he's
[1:06:58] in the situation Amen to show that his
[1:07:00] workings different than the workings of
[1:07:02] the world so often what we want is God
[1:07:04] to match the world we want God's
[1:07:07] response to match the way the world
[1:07:08] would respond no he's God he'll do it
[1:07:10] his way amen give God a chance to to
[1:07:13] give the victory G give God the chance
[1:07:15] to show himself mightier and stronger
[1:07:17] but let him do it in his way in his time
[1:07:19] just stand still and see the salvation
[1:07:21] of God Psalm 40 says this I waited
[1:07:25] patiently for the Lord and He inclined
[1:07:27] unto me and he heard My Cry he brought
[1:07:30] me up also out of an horrible pit
[1:07:33] sometimes we think Faith keeps us out of
[1:07:35] pits no God leads you down the road and
[1:07:38] sometimes you're going to fall into hard
[1:07:40] times and it'll look like a pit but
[1:07:43] Faith doesn't keep us out of pits Faith
[1:07:45] gives us patience to wait on God to get
[1:07:47] us out of the pits to stick with the
[1:07:49] word and let it do its purpose amen so
[1:07:52] whether we're on a pit in a pit or on a
[1:07:54] mountain we ought to be able to have the
[1:07:55] same attitude we ought to have the same
[1:07:57] approach with God he said he brought me
[1:07:59] up also out of an horrible pit out of
[1:08:01] the myy clay now New Finland we got a
[1:08:04] lot of rock and not necessarily a ton of
[1:08:05] mud unless you go in the
[1:08:07] bogs but you go out in the bogs and you
[1:08:09] get into the real mud what happens is
[1:08:12] you're walking along and you'll put that
[1:08:14] foot down and it'll go down in the mud
[1:08:17] and you go to move your foot and you
[1:08:19] can't move your foot you can't get your
[1:08:21] boot out you can't get your foot out and
[1:08:23] you know what we always have to do we
[1:08:25] have to sacrifice the boot to get the
[1:08:28] foot out or else somebody has to come in
[1:08:30] and get us out you can get this is the
[1:08:33] myy clay we're talking about you're so
[1:08:35] stuck you can't get yourself out and we
[1:08:38] go into situations by ourselves what is
[1:08:41] it we're stuck and we can't get out we
[1:08:43] can't redeem ourselves we can't rescue
[1:08:45] ourselves reforming won't do it a
[1:08:47] mindset change won't do it God has to
[1:08:50] come in and he's got to get us out of
[1:08:51] our own nature he's got to get us out of
[1:08:52] our own way we need an external help
[1:08:55] here he says he took me out of the myy
[1:08:57] clay and he set my feet upon a rock and
[1:09:00] established my goings he brought them to
[1:09:01] new
[1:09:02] land right set him on a rock he says and
[1:09:05] he ha put a new song in my mouth even
[1:09:08] praise unto our God many shall see it
[1:09:11] and fear and trust in the Lord you stick
[1:09:15] with the word and watch God take you out
[1:09:17] that gives courage to the brother or
[1:09:18] sister that's next to you to say hey he
[1:09:20] does it God rescues God provides God
[1:09:23] heals
[1:09:24] God delivers God does all of these
[1:09:26] things cuz I seen him get you out of a
[1:09:27] place that nobody gets out of I've seen
[1:09:30] him deliver in ways that I've never seen
[1:09:32] anybody delivered I've seen them heal in
[1:09:34] ways I've never seen him heal it gives
[1:09:36] faith and it gives patience to the
[1:09:37] person next to us brother BR would talk
[1:09:40] about getting down to the wire and he's
[1:09:41] he talks about the three Hebrew children
[1:09:44] and they've had their big conversation
[1:09:45] before the king and they said we won't
[1:09:47] bow you know we believe God can do it
[1:09:49] but even if he doesn't we're not going
[1:09:51] to change that beautiful scene three
[1:09:53] teenage boys standing up to a King he
[1:09:57] says they started walking up the ramp
[1:10:00] one looked at another one and said it's
[1:10:01] all right all right they got patience he
[1:10:05] says went one step God wasn't
[1:10:10] there two steps he wasn't there three
[1:10:15] steps four steps five steps just kept on
[1:10:18] going still he wasn't there God how come
[1:10:23] you're letting me go this close to the
[1:10:25] fire I've stood for you I've stood for
[1:10:28] you I've stood for you and you're still
[1:10:30] not here walking towards the fire but as
[1:10:33] they were getting closer and closer to
[1:10:35] the fire what was happening to the
[1:10:36] guards and
[1:10:37] tormentors they were dying and as
[1:10:40] they're getting closer and closer to the
[1:10:41] fire there's nothing happening to them
[1:10:44] but all around them people are dying was
[1:10:48] the scripture say that a thousand will
[1:10:49] fall at thy right hand and 10,000 by thy
[1:10:52] side but it shall shall not come nigh
[1:10:54] unto
[1:10:55] thee sometimes he lets you get close to
[1:10:58] the edge just to prove that he's got you
[1:11:00] in the palm of his
[1:11:02] hand and I imagine I preached on this
[1:11:04] before I know maybe not here but
[1:11:06] certainly back in BC that I'm sure that
[1:11:08] something started to rise up as they're
[1:11:10] getting closer and closer to that fire
[1:11:12] and they start to see the guards
[1:11:14] dropping big Burly muscular powerful
[1:11:17] warriors hardened men versus some some
[1:11:20] tiny little skinny teenagers and the war
[1:11:23] Warriors are dropping from the Heat and
[1:11:26] the young men are walking over and it's
[1:11:28] not having an effect on
[1:11:30] them I imagine they had a bit of a
[1:11:32] Hallelujah moment
[1:11:35] honestly but even as their soldiers that
[1:11:39] were guarding them and pushing them
[1:11:40] along died they kept walking you ever
[1:11:42] notied that they kept walking with no
[1:11:44] one to push them in they kept walking
[1:11:45] because they've been told to
[1:11:47] walk and brother Ram says they stepped
[1:11:50] right off into the fiery furnace they
[1:11:52] had patience
[1:11:54] he says but he was there he was there
[1:11:56] all along he was there all along he says
[1:12:00] and see there was just enough fire hit
[1:12:02] them to burn their latches off their
[1:12:04] hands and their feet and then when they
[1:12:06] hit the bottom of the pit he was there
[1:12:08] see they had patience and in the midst
[1:12:10] of that trial they were so comfortable
[1:12:12] that they were able to walk around with
[1:12:15] the Son of God and not come out until
[1:12:17] the king told them
[1:12:19] to what were they proving he's still God
[1:12:24] he doesn't always take us out of the
[1:12:26] trial but he'll keep us safe in the
[1:12:29] trial I love when Moses said that the
[1:12:31] Red Sea said stand still and see the
[1:12:33] salvation of God and in the time of
[1:12:35] Trials we ought to have an expectation
[1:12:37] that God is moving you know the kids
[1:12:40] have been watching that that Narnia
[1:12:41] series you know and you know what they
[1:12:42] say as lands on the Move Well church we
[1:12:47] are at the end of the end God is moving
[1:12:51] he's moved in a powerful way he's sent
[1:12:53] us Malachi 4 he's proved himself by
[1:12:55] signs and wonders he's proved himself by
[1:12:57] the opening of the word we're in the
[1:12:59] time when God is moving in a way he's
[1:13:01] never moved
[1:13:02] before but yet there's trials and
[1:13:04] there's tests and it seems like things
[1:13:06] are going and they don't happen
[1:13:09] and but I'll tell you after they went
[1:13:11] through these three Hebrew children went
[1:13:13] through this experience I'll tell you
[1:13:15] they couldn't you couldn't put the fear
[1:13:17] of anything into
[1:13:18] them they've been through the fire and
[1:13:22] it didn't hurt them
[1:13:24] what are you going to what are you going
[1:13:25] to do say I'm going to kill you you
[1:13:27] tried it and all you did was killed your
[1:13:28] own people no fear in them let me tell
[1:13:31] you when God takes the fear out Satan
[1:13:34] has no hold because Satan operates under
[1:13:37] fear and when you realize that he's got
[1:13:39] you in the palm of your hand that
[1:13:41] nothing nothing can touch you unless he
[1:13:45] allows it that'll take the fear out you
[1:13:48] won't worry about your health you won't
[1:13:49] worry about your finances you won't
[1:13:51] worry about your marriage you won't
[1:13:52] worry about your kids you won't worry
[1:13:54] about your church you won't worry about
[1:13:55] your ministry you won't worry about your
[1:13:57] family you won't worry because he's got
[1:13:59] you in the palm of your hand perfect
[1:14:01] love casts out fear and on patience is
[1:14:04] on the route to perfect love you get the
[1:14:07] Holy Ghost that takes out all fear we'll
[1:14:09] see how that happens amen but it takes
[1:14:11] patience patience on top of Faith to
[1:14:13] take you to a place of perfect love
[1:14:15] where you recognize that his Banner Over
[1:14:17] Me Is Love he operates under love and
[1:14:21] that kicks out all the fear because no
[1:14:23] no matter what's happening you know it's
[1:14:24] for my good and it's going to be turned
[1:14:26] to my good remember Hebrews 10 says this
[1:14:31] cast not away therefore your confidence
[1:14:34] where's your confidence
[1:14:36] today what have you placed your
[1:14:38] confidence on where are you resting
[1:14:40] today he says don't Cast Away your
[1:14:42] confidence which had great recompense of
[1:14:45] reward great compensation in another way
[1:14:48] this kind of confidence has great pay
[1:14:51] God pays well
[1:14:54] we're all looking for good paying jobs
[1:14:56] he says God pays well for you have need
[1:14:59] of patience that after you have done the
[1:15:01] will of God you might receive the
[1:15:03] promise remember here's the trend God
[1:15:05] gives the promise you have patience you
[1:15:07] do the will you have patience and then
[1:15:09] God gives you the promise he says for
[1:15:11] yet a little while now this is God's
[1:15:14] little while this isn't our little while
[1:15:15] this is God's little while and I know
[1:15:17] sometimes God's little while is a really
[1:15:19] long
[1:15:20] time but it's yet a while there's a time
[1:15:23] declared for it it says and he shall
[1:15:25] come and he that shall come will come
[1:15:28] and he will not t now the just shall
[1:15:31] live by faith but if many any man draw
[1:15:33] back my soul shall have no pleasure in
[1:15:35] him he says but we are not of them who
[1:15:38] draw back into predition why we left
[1:15:40] predition we left the place of the
[1:15:43] Damned we left the place of the lost
[1:15:44] we've come out of it there's nothing
[1:15:46] left for us what we're in even if it's
[1:15:49] bad is way way better than everything
[1:15:51] we've left behind there's nothing for us
[1:15:53] back there we don't draw back he says
[1:15:55] but we are of them that believe to the
[1:15:58] saving of the Soul that's the thing that
[1:16:01] matters God bless you Roy I didn't even
[1:16:03] see you come in amen it's good to see
[1:16:05] you but now he comes and he he moves on
[1:16:07] to the Pentecostal people he says now
[1:16:09] how about the Pentecostal people he's
[1:16:11] talking about the the the the day of
[1:16:12] Pentecost the you know when the the
[1:16:14] disciples and the the ones went up on
[1:16:16] the on the top of the temple he says as
[1:16:19] long as they got the commission wait
[1:16:21] until you're endued with power how long
[1:16:23] they didn't have no answer to that
[1:16:25] question how long will it be they just
[1:16:26] got the answer wait until he didn't say
[1:16:30] it was going to be 10 days he didn't say
[1:16:31] it was going to be a day an hour nothing
[1:16:33] he just said wait and they went up there
[1:16:36] and they said all right boys maybe 15
[1:16:37] minutes from now the holy spirit's going
[1:16:39] to be on us and we're going to have our
[1:16:40] ministry 15 minutes pass nobody one day
[1:16:44] pass no 2 3 4 5 6 7 some of them might
[1:16:47] have said hey don't you think we got it
[1:16:49] already no no no
[1:16:52] no
[1:16:53] you better come on out boys the devil
[1:16:55] said you know you've already got what
[1:16:58] you want go on start your ministry they
[1:17:00] said no no no we ain't got it yet cuz he
[1:17:02] said there will come and what would take
[1:17:04] place in the last days with stammering
[1:17:06] lips and other tongues will I speak to
[1:17:08] this people and this is the rest that I
[1:17:10] said see Isaiah 28:19 said this is it
[1:17:13] why we'll know when it comes and there
[1:17:16] they waited 9
[1:17:17] days nine days I talked about it before
[1:17:21] they're nervous cuz their disciple of
[1:17:23] Jesus people are looking for him they
[1:17:24] want to put him in prison they want to
[1:17:26] persecute him 120 people in an upper
[1:17:28] room in the temple sweaty tired
[1:17:31] cramped nine days nothing
[1:17:35] happens he says and then on the 10th day
[1:17:39] we were there how often we miss the
[1:17:42] blessing because we wait a while but not
[1:17:45] all the
[1:17:47] way we go 90% And then we stop and we
[1:17:51] take a hike on that last 10% and we
[1:17:53] missed the blessing of God that we were
[1:17:55] waiting all that time for we put in so
[1:17:58] much effort and then we walk away
[1:18:00] sometimes in church we put in all this
[1:18:02] effort and there's a tremendous
[1:18:03] anointing in the building and a
[1:18:05] tremendous present and what do we do we
[1:18:07] walk
[1:18:08] out and sometimes the greatest blessing
[1:18:10] is in staying
[1:18:13] behind sometimes we put all that prayer
[1:18:15] in we put in all that time and then we
[1:18:17] make the decision on our own rather than
[1:18:19] waiting on God we put all the effort in
[1:18:22] stick with it God's
[1:18:26] moving he said now they had patience to
[1:18:29] wait now if you got that kind of
[1:18:30] patience after God gives you a promise
[1:18:33] and you see it in the Bible it's mine
[1:18:36] then wait what's he saying when you get
[1:18:38] a personal revelation that God's
[1:18:39] speaking to you hold on to it we need
[1:18:42] Revelation that our name goes in this
[1:18:46] book that when he talks about the bride
[1:18:48] of Christ that our name goes in the book
[1:18:49] when he talks about the believer it's
[1:18:51] it's our name that goes there when he
[1:18:53] talks about the Overcomer it's our name
[1:18:54] that goes in there when he talks about a
[1:18:56] Christian our name goes in there and
[1:18:58] when he does every attribute and every
[1:18:59] blessing belongs to us but we got to see
[1:19:02] that it's not just for brother Mark and
[1:19:04] sister Moren it's not for Rebecca just
[1:19:06] for Rebecca and Lydia but it's for me
[1:19:08] and it's for you and so we can read it
[1:19:10] and say it is mine it is mine we sing
[1:19:13] that song it is mine mine blessed be his
[1:19:15] name he has given peace perfect
[1:19:18] peace it this treasure is mine it's not
[1:19:22] just yours it's M I've got to see it for
[1:19:23] me not just for you I've got to have
[1:19:26] faith for myself he says then if you've
[1:19:28] got that kind of patience added to your
[1:19:30] faith and see how high you're getting
[1:19:32] now you're getting way up here
[1:19:35] now I was studying this and I just
[1:19:38] sometimes you get down into roads and
[1:19:40] you don't know why you're there and I
[1:19:42] got down this road and I just felt to
[1:19:44] bring it as it was a blessing to me as I
[1:19:46] was reading it and I felt it would be a
[1:19:48] blessing to the church tonight so just a
[1:19:50] bit of a change in Direction here we'll
[1:19:52] go to to Luke 15 this is Jesus and this
[1:19:55] is the parable of the prodal son
[1:19:57] remember and he said a certain man had
[1:19:59] two sons and the younger of them said to
[1:20:01] his father father give me the portion of
[1:20:03] goods that falleth to me and he divided
[1:20:05] unto them his living the son said I
[1:20:07] don't want to wait till you die I want
[1:20:09] your blessings now I want my part of
[1:20:12] what you've worked so hard for now and I
[1:20:14] want to
[1:20:16] leave it says and not many
[1:20:19] days I know this is a parable but let's
[1:20:21] pretend they're real for the for for
[1:20:23] this this little portion there one of
[1:20:24] the greatest disappointment of their
[1:20:26] lives happens when that boy tells them I
[1:20:28] want to take your money and run you ever
[1:20:31] notice how Satan Works
[1:20:33] fast they they have a bomb that gets
[1:20:35] dropped into their beautiful Christian
[1:20:37] home and fast is the way Satan works
[1:20:40] that guy just wants to get out of there
[1:20:42] it says and after the younger son
[1:20:44] gathered all together and took his
[1:20:46] journey into a far country and there
[1:20:48] wasted his substance with rius
[1:20:51] living brother BR pick up the story he
[1:20:53] says now I noticed his father weary
[1:20:55] walking up and down and the next day
[1:20:57] when it came time for the boy to leave I
[1:20:59] can see him pack his little suitcase and
[1:21:00] get out there and see him go around and
[1:21:02] say so long folks and start off mother
[1:21:05] say just a moment honey before you go
[1:21:07] let's have prayer one more time kneel
[1:21:09] down on the floor I can see the old
[1:21:10] mother and dad with their arms around
[1:21:12] one another praying to God say God we've
[1:21:15] raised him and took him this
[1:21:18] far can we at least say
[1:21:21] that he says he's gone out from the way
[1:21:24] from us now wandering please father take
[1:21:27] care of him and I can hear him just
[1:21:30] Restless while they're praying they
[1:21:32] didn't want to hear them prayers of
[1:21:33] mother and dad no more he had other
[1:21:35] things on his mind he says that's the
[1:21:37] reason sometimes we're impatient we just
[1:21:40] can't wait a few minutes can't pray and
[1:21:43] can't wait for a prayer but there'll
[1:21:45] come a time friends you'll have all
[1:21:46] eternity to think about it he says pray
[1:21:49] now be ready now to meet your master
[1:21:52] consider this situation the parents are
[1:21:54] just grieving they're absolutely gutted
[1:21:56] this son maybe been showing all the
[1:21:58] signs of being a wonderful believing son
[1:22:00] and then he just comes in and says I've
[1:22:02] had enough I'm leaving I want to take
[1:22:04] whatever I can and I want to go and he
[1:22:06] splinters the family but notice a
[1:22:09] Praying family real Believers amen not
[1:22:12] again these aren't real people but in
[1:22:14] the story we we often look at the nature
[1:22:16] of the son and we see the work of God
[1:22:18] but I want you to see the nature of the
[1:22:20] parents behind this as well cuz brother
[1:22:22] takes and he flips it in a wonderful way
[1:22:25] we go back to the scriptures and it says
[1:22:27] now when he had spent all listen
[1:22:29] everyone hits the end of the road
[1:22:31] everyone hits the end of the line at
[1:22:33] some point and we can look at our
[1:22:35] children or we can look at relatives or
[1:22:36] family pick whoever it is in your life
[1:22:39] this morning and we see them and we
[1:22:40] believe they're making wrong decisions
[1:22:42] or they're living the wrong way they're
[1:22:44] walking away from what they've been
[1:22:45] raised and taught is right listen if
[1:22:48] they're God's child they're going to hit
[1:22:49] the end of the road sometime they're
[1:22:51] going to hit the end of the line and it
[1:22:53] may not be
[1:22:54] pretty but if they're a child of God
[1:22:56] they've got to hit the end of the line
[1:22:58] at some point cuz that children of of
[1:23:00] the devil they just get to keep going
[1:23:02] but children of God hit the end of the
[1:23:04] line he says but when he had spent all
[1:23:07] he he' taken every blessing every
[1:23:09] benefit every good bit that his parents
[1:23:11] had given him he says then there arose a
[1:23:13] mighty famine in that land and he began
[1:23:15] to be in want and when you get in need
[1:23:19] you see a real change in people and
[1:23:22] they'll either turn to evil even more or
[1:23:24] they'll turn back remember scripture
[1:23:26] says raise up a child in the way he
[1:23:27] should go and when he is old he'll not
[1:23:29] depart from it J doesn't say in the
[1:23:32] middle he doesn't sometimes we have some
[1:23:34] departures in the middle but he'll come
[1:23:36] back
[1:23:37] around he says and he went and he joined
[1:23:39] himself to a citizen of that country he
[1:23:42] gone completely out of his country he
[1:23:44] wasn't on home he wasn't in the Home
[1:23:46] Country anymore he' left his inheritance
[1:23:48] completely behind he says and and he
[1:23:51] sent him into his fields to to feed
[1:23:53] swine sent him out to feed the
[1:23:55] pigs and he says and he would have
[1:23:57] filled his belly with the husks that the
[1:23:59] swine did eat and no man gave unto him
[1:24:01] he's living off pig food he's living off
[1:24:04] corn husk he's fighting in the mud to
[1:24:06] survive with the pigs what a
[1:24:09] life from from a son from a wealthy
[1:24:12] family with a a good Farm a good ranch
[1:24:15] with good believing parents and he's in
[1:24:16] the mud church sometimes God's got to
[1:24:19] get us in the
[1:24:20] mud to let us realize something's not
[1:24:24] right what is it God was getting his
[1:24:26] attention brother BR he he continues
[1:24:28] this story he says one night I see a
[1:24:30] Restless Mother and Dad begin to speak
[1:24:32] about their boy hear the mother say I'm
[1:24:34] just so Restless dad I don't know what
[1:24:35] to do I just keep thinking about our boy
[1:24:38] wonder where he's at wonder if he's got
[1:24:40] something to eat I hear dad say well
[1:24:42] we've always been taught that all things
[1:24:43] work together for good to them that love
[1:24:45] God he said let's pray I can see them
[1:24:48] get down on the floor and begin to
[1:24:50] praying about that little Johnny I can
[1:24:52] hear and pray oh God take care of our
[1:24:54] boy wherever he is whatever state he's
[1:24:56] in take care of him father and send him
[1:24:58] home then brother R comes around he says
[1:25:00] where's he at he's down in the Hog Pen
[1:25:03] going to the Hog Pen hopeless situation
[1:25:06] he's lost he's he he's filthy he's worn
[1:25:08] out he's homeless he's the drgs of
[1:25:10] society he's messed up he's filthy he's
[1:25:13] dirty but that doesn't matter what
[1:25:15] matters is that a prayer of faith has
[1:25:17] been prayed and there's a patience
[1:25:19] that's holding the ones that prayed it
[1:25:21] amen
[1:25:23] we focus so much on the child but let's
[1:25:25] look at the parents behind that
[1:25:28] son it says and when he came to himself
[1:25:32] he said how many hired Servants of my
[1:25:34] fathers have bread enough and Des spare
[1:25:36] and I perish with hunger and in other
[1:25:38] words even those that serve my dad even
[1:25:41] his employees have food and I'm a son
[1:25:43] and I don't have that even servants get
[1:25:45] more than I've got he said I will arise
[1:25:48] and go to my father and I will say to
[1:25:50] him father I'm your
[1:25:53] son
[1:25:55] no no no no because when you come to
[1:25:58] yourself there's a repentance that comes
[1:25:59] with it you realize I got off track he
[1:26:03] said father I have sinned against heaven
[1:26:06] and before thee and I'm no more worthy
[1:26:08] to be called thy son make me as one of
[1:26:11] thy hired servants we jump back to the
[1:26:13] story and he says the angel of God come
[1:26:15] to him and said boy wake
[1:26:17] up talked to him and said oh what about
[1:26:20] you just get back home to them' then the
[1:26:22] son says think of my father that has all
[1:26:24] the wealth that he has and all the
[1:26:26] things he's given to me and here I am
[1:26:28] laying here dying of hunger laying in a
[1:26:30] Hog Pen eating the Bible said he came to
[1:26:33] himself that's an act of God because
[1:26:36] without God we are completely hidden by
[1:26:38] this Beast nature we are completely
[1:26:41] hidden by the carnality that we have
[1:26:42] we're a slave to our baser instincts and
[1:26:45] this boy had ruined his life by his
[1:26:47] baser
[1:26:48] instincts he'd used up everything
[1:26:50] everything good we're lost and capable
[1:26:53] of rescuing ourselves from this this
[1:26:55] hopelessness that we have in this carnal
[1:26:57] body but catch this next thought no
[1:26:59] because sometime so often we put
[1:27:01] ourselves in the parents' place and oh
[1:27:04] we're the praying parents we're the the
[1:27:06] praying family members and God's going
[1:27:07] to you know but but watch the prophet of
[1:27:10] God changes because our attitude is so
[1:27:13] often one of forgetfulness of who we
[1:27:15] are even as children of God he says
[1:27:19] that's what the church needs to do today
[1:27:21] is come to the El and realize who is
[1:27:24] your father for sometimes we act as
[1:27:26] though we have no Heavenly Father for
[1:27:29] all the goodness of Heaven belongs to
[1:27:31] the church he's saying let's us remind
[1:27:34] ourselves who our father is even as
[1:27:37] we're looking to our prodical children
[1:27:38] even as we're looking to those that are
[1:27:40] lost in the world don't forget your
[1:27:42] father has good things for you and he'll
[1:27:44] give you the souls that are needful he
[1:27:47] says what he's given us the all the
[1:27:49] goodness of Heaven belongs to the church
[1:27:51] Divine Healing salvation freedom from
[1:27:54] worry or anything it all belongs to the
[1:27:56] church Jesus died and we inherit all
[1:27:58] that God has through him we are Heirs of
[1:28:00] the Kingdom we're rich remember brother
[1:28:03] R would say the church is living under
[1:28:05] its privileges why because we forget who
[1:28:07] our father is we forget that we have a
[1:28:10] place to go we have a storehouse to draw
[1:28:13] from we have a a source of blessing that
[1:28:15] is waiting for us and all we're doing in
[1:28:18] this this time is trying to remember
[1:28:20] trying to be reminded of Who We Are
[1:28:23] by what our
[1:28:24] father God's come down and he's trying
[1:28:26] to remind us who he is and how we fit
[1:28:28] into
[1:28:29] it we don't have to eat brother saying
[1:28:32] here we don't have to eat the slop of
[1:28:34] the world we don't have to be worried
[1:28:35] when times get tough we don't have to be
[1:28:37] down when we get sick we don't have to
[1:28:39] to to get into despair when things
[1:28:41] aren't going our way why because God's
[1:28:43] waiting there with every provision
[1:28:45] remember Paul said I've never seen the
[1:28:47] righteous forsaken nor his seed begging
[1:28:50] bread he didn't say we we'd always have
[1:28:52] a big house and a nice car but he says
[1:28:54] I've never seen them needing he always
[1:28:57] meets the need brother Matt would talk
[1:28:59] he's told me and I know this is is
[1:29:01] common knowledge that when he was off
[1:29:03] work for over a year he came through
[1:29:05] that year with virtually no hit
[1:29:07] financially because people were helping
[1:29:09] him and he was getting checks in the
[1:29:10] mail with nobody's name on it just
[1:29:12] people sending him money to help him and
[1:29:14] support him and and things just working
[1:29:16] out what was it God showing him I am
[1:29:18] Jehovah Gyra even in the time of trial
[1:29:21] yet meet your need brother saying wake
[1:29:24] yourself up come to yourself when you
[1:29:26] seem like it's despair is coming over
[1:29:28] you realize you've got a good good
[1:29:31] father that's got everything that we
[1:29:33] have need of
[1:29:35] amen he says and he arose and came to
[1:29:38] his father he remembered his family
[1:29:40] heritage he remembered what the family
[1:29:42] had it says and when he was yet a great
[1:29:44] way off his father saw him and had
[1:29:47] compassion and ran and fell on his neck
[1:29:49] and kissed him there's the patient
[1:29:52] father in expectation with Faith and
[1:29:55] Hope today's the day and you know what
[1:29:58] eventually today was the day and there
[1:30:00] came the son coming back and he was
[1:30:02] ready to see him a far way off he says
[1:30:04] then I noticed down there again I can
[1:30:06] see the father get real Restless get up
[1:30:09] and pull his coat and walk out through
[1:30:11] the gate a moonlet night look down
[1:30:13] across the path wondering where is his
[1:30:15] boy he says I can hear him I can hear
[1:30:18] the son say I'll arise and go to my
[1:30:20] father now here he comes
[1:30:23] crawling it's not always an easy road
[1:30:26] back notice the son's got to return the
[1:30:29] father doesn't leave cuz the father's
[1:30:33] standing on the word the son's got to
[1:30:35] come back to the word he's got to crawl
[1:30:37] back he's coming repentant remember he's
[1:30:39] coming in humility he's not strutting up
[1:30:41] saying oh yeah I'm his son he's no no no
[1:30:43] he's coming back with the right attitude
[1:30:46] he says I'll arise and come to my father
[1:30:48] here he comes crawling and I can see Dad
[1:30:50] and mother sitting out in the room and
[1:30:51] here he comes the rising of the sun
[1:30:53] across the fields shoes off his feet
[1:30:56] clothes tattered and torn staggering
[1:30:58] home and I can hear his mother say there
[1:31:00] he comes dad and he dad say That's my
[1:31:04] boy oh even in his horrible condition
[1:31:07] beat up and bruised and hagger and and
[1:31:10] completely hungry that's still my boy
[1:31:14] and he welcomed him back into the house
[1:31:16] we look at that that son but what about
[1:31:18] the attributes of the father he's so
[1:31:20] full of faith that he's looking for that
[1:31:21] son every day and he's not just looking
[1:31:23] nearby but he's looking off in the
[1:31:25] distance and everything that breaks the
[1:31:27] Horizon there he's thinking that could
[1:31:29] be my son today he's in expectation why
[1:31:33] because the trying of your faith
[1:31:34] produces patience and patience produces
[1:31:36] an
[1:31:37] expectation of hope that it's going to
[1:31:40] happen today
[1:31:42] Amen brother Brian would turn a corner
[1:31:44] after this and he says now he says we
[1:31:46] should have patience with one another
[1:31:49] see we get so much impatient with one
[1:31:51] another we think we got to be like Moses
[1:31:53] Moses had patience he says we think we
[1:31:55] got to be like Moses Moses had patience
[1:31:57] with the people even one time when that
[1:31:59] rebellious bunch of people had such
[1:32:01] impatience they caused Moses to do
[1:32:03] something was wrong but yet when it come
[1:32:05] to a showdown God got sick of their
[1:32:07] actions and he said separate yourselves
[1:32:09] Moses I'll kill the whole bunch of them
[1:32:11] and start a new and Moses threw himself
[1:32:14] in the breach and said God don't do it
[1:32:16] he says what is it patience with the
[1:32:18] people that was rebelling against him he
[1:32:20] says I wonder if we could do that he
[1:32:22] says if you don't don't come to that
[1:32:23] stature of the dwelling place of the
[1:32:25] Living God if you haven't got patience
[1:32:27] with one another I was reading in
[1:32:29] Matthew in devotions this morning where
[1:32:31] Jesus
[1:32:33] says you got to
[1:32:35] realize we're not here to judge each
[1:32:38] other this is a self-judging
[1:32:40] gospel we can discern a situation and we
[1:32:43] ought to be able to judge a situation
[1:32:46] whether it's right or wrong but don't
[1:32:47] you judge that person this is not what
[1:32:49] we do here I can dis agree with what
[1:32:52] somebody's doing without judging them
[1:32:54] I'm judging the action not the person
[1:32:56] Paul the Apostle when he was Sol and he
[1:32:58] was persecuting the church if we judged
[1:33:00] him he would have been B out but God
[1:33:02] says he's a chosen vessel he's a chosen
[1:33:05] vessel to spread the gospel and all it
[1:33:06] took was one moment in the presence of
[1:33:08] God and he turned 180 degrees and he
[1:33:09] went out and started preaching that
[1:33:10] Jesus is the Messiah Jesus is the Christ
[1:33:13] and then God took him all the way to the
[1:33:14] Gentiles we don't judge the person but
[1:33:16] we ought to have discernment for the
[1:33:17] situation by the word of God but in
[1:33:20] Matthew remember Jesus said he says why
[1:33:23] why do you look at your brother and you
[1:33:24] see the Splinter that's in his eye you
[1:33:26] see the little flaw he says and you've
[1:33:28] got a wooden beam stuck through yours
[1:33:31] why because we didn't examine ourselves
[1:33:32] in the word first before we went looking
[1:33:34] for something in our brother or sister
[1:33:36] and we get frustrated because they keep
[1:33:37] doing something over and over again not
[1:33:39] knowing that many times we're doing
[1:33:40] something just like it in a different
[1:33:43] area of our life and other people are
[1:33:45] showing us way more grace than we show
[1:33:46] for that brother or sister
[1:33:48] self-examination is where the word
[1:33:49] starts always always
[1:33:53] always but as we start to close I want
[1:33:56] to pull it down into our day because
[1:33:57] we're in this final age we're in the the
[1:33:59] final time of the working with the
[1:34:01] Gentiles we know time is wrapping up and
[1:34:03] we know a tribulation is coming and
[1:34:05] before a tribulation comes we know the
[1:34:06] Bride of Jesus Christ has taken up but
[1:34:09] it's been written about for thousands of
[1:34:10] years we've got 6,000 years and more of
[1:34:14] scripture that's been written and being
[1:34:17] written and yet it hasn't happened yet
[1:34:19] you know we've got people in this church
[1:34:21] I look at brother Gerald back there
[1:34:22] maybe 60 years of believing that Christ
[1:34:25] is going to return brother Gerald has it
[1:34:27] happened
[1:34:30] yet we're still
[1:34:33] here we're still here you know what
[1:34:36] we've seen people that believed to be
[1:34:38] healed they didn't get healed we
[1:34:40] believed that people we have people that
[1:34:43] believed that a Rapture was going to
[1:34:44] happen and they've died without ever
[1:34:45] seen it but yet so much has happened to
[1:34:49] tell us we're in Rapture season we're in
[1:34:51] Resurrection season it's not that
[1:34:53] nothing has happened we've got to see
[1:34:55] the signs of the times remember Jesus
[1:34:57] said you can look at the sky and you can
[1:34:58] tell what the weather's going to be like
[1:34:59] but you can't look at the what's
[1:35:01] happening around you and tell what's
[1:35:02] happening by the word we know what's
[1:35:03] happening by the word we've received a
[1:35:05] Malachi 4 Prophet that has told us and
[1:35:07] has placed Us in the scripture it's been
[1:35:09] going home time for a while now but it's
[1:35:12] still going home time the fact that it's
[1:35:14] been going on for a while doesn't make
[1:35:15] it any less of the time now habac would
[1:35:18] talk about this he says and the Lord
[1:35:20] answered me and said write the vision
[1:35:22] and make it plain upon tables write it
[1:35:24] out he says that he may run that
[1:35:27] readeth
[1:35:29] it when you hear the word it has an
[1:35:32] effect always it has an effect he says
[1:35:37] that he may run that read it that it
[1:35:38] will cause him it'll put him into action
[1:35:40] he says for the vision is yet for an
[1:35:42] appointed time so habac write it now but
[1:35:46] it's for a future event it's a future
[1:35:48] event for a future time he says but at
[1:35:50] the end it shall speak the the vision
[1:35:51] will come to pass and it won't lie
[1:35:54] though it t wait for it he says though
[1:35:56] it waits you wait don't get impatient
[1:36:00] don't walk away he says for because it
[1:36:02] will surely come it won't T it'll T
[1:36:05] until it doesn't it'll wait until it
[1:36:07] doesn't wait it's going to happen he
[1:36:10] says behold his soul which is lifted up
[1:36:12] is not upright in him but the just shall
[1:36:14] live by his faith brother R would say
[1:36:17] this he says I believe that all these
[1:36:19] things have a time of lingering of
[1:36:22] waiting but it's waiting for a time for
[1:36:25] the scripture to be fulfilled till
[1:36:27] everything gets right and everything is
[1:36:30] in order remember BR he he had that
[1:36:32] vision of that girl that was going to be
[1:36:33] healed and and in the vision he saw the
[1:36:35] way the room was and when he got to the
[1:36:37] house the Hat wasn't in the right place
[1:36:40] CU it was supposed to be hung up
[1:36:41] somewhere and when he got there he saw
[1:36:43] the Hat was not where it was supposed to
[1:36:44] be but seeing that vision of the event
[1:36:46] that's about to happen the Temptation is
[1:36:49] for him to go take that hat and put it
[1:36:51] it to where it was supposed to be but he
[1:36:54] says I can't do that he showed me that
[1:36:57] so that when it happened I'd know that I
[1:36:59] was in the vision and I could go pray
[1:37:01] but until the Hat was moved over there
[1:37:04] it couldn't happen and so brother Bram
[1:37:05] had to sit there and be patient until
[1:37:07] somebody without any of him him saying a
[1:37:09] single word went there and put the Hat
[1:37:11] over on the coat rack and then he could
[1:37:13] go and he could do what God told him to
[1:37:14] do he couldn't Force the
[1:37:17] situation he says many times we get
[1:37:19] impatient like a child we get great
[1:37:22] anticipation and many times we jump way
[1:37:24] ahead and that just hinders the work
[1:37:26] until the work gets caught up see we
[1:37:28] must just move reverently have a purpose
[1:37:31] in heart that God if he would desire to
[1:37:34] use us in such and such but wait till he
[1:37:37] makes the opening cuz he has to go ahead
[1:37:39] of us he says remember going David going
[1:37:42] to battle that night he was weary about
[1:37:45] the fight and he laid under those
[1:37:46] mulberry trees until he heard the Lord
[1:37:48] and the rumbling of the leaves going
[1:37:50] before him God God said David don't
[1:37:53] start the battle until you hear the
[1:37:54] rustling in the mberry
[1:37:57] trees okay when's the last time that
[1:38:00] happened has that ever happened no but
[1:38:03] God said here's the sign you can start
[1:38:06] fighting when the mberry trees start to
[1:38:08] rustle and when they did David went out
[1:38:10] and he won a great Victory but he had to
[1:38:12] wait David was the king he' been
[1:38:14] promised Victory but he had to wait for
[1:38:16] the timing of God he said then he went
[1:38:19] with courage because he knew that had
[1:38:21] gone before him he says if we'd only do
[1:38:23] that Brethren knowing the battle must
[1:38:27] come every child of God has to be tested
[1:38:30] every child of God has to be tried he
[1:38:32] says otherwise we're
[1:38:33] bastards he says knowing the battle must
[1:38:36] come but we must wait till we see the
[1:38:38] hand of God going before us to make a
[1:38:41] way we have so much truth we have so
[1:38:45] much knowledge of the word we we
[1:38:47] understand where we're at and I think
[1:38:49] sometimes the hardest thing to do is to
[1:38:50] sit back back and wait on God to make it
[1:38:54] happen we we I mean we're going to be
[1:38:56] preaching on adoption we're going to
[1:38:58] we're preaching on the manifestation of
[1:38:59] the sons of God we're talking about
[1:39:01] signs and wonders we're talking about
[1:39:02] all of these things that are happening
[1:39:04] at this end time and you think I've got
[1:39:06] to do it no you have to follow God as he
[1:39:10] does it as he leads you as he guides you
[1:39:12] in these things God's got a timing for
[1:39:14] it and that patience is the thing that
[1:39:16] holds us steady until he says go rather
[1:39:19] than we say go we want to be ready our
[1:39:22] job is to be ready his job is to tell us
[1:39:25] when to
[1:39:26] go he says many men go out impatient but
[1:39:30] listen he says believing that the time
[1:39:33] is near that's not bad he says you try
[1:39:36] to do something within yourself he says
[1:39:38] wait upon the Lord patience is virtue if
[1:39:41] you can have if you can have patience
[1:39:43] it's virtue they that wait upon the Lord
[1:39:45] shall renew their strength not they that
[1:39:47] try to get ahead of the Lord they that
[1:39:49] try to tell the Lord Lord I know you
[1:39:51] want me to do this and glory to God I he
[1:39:53] says don't do that he says wait upon the
[1:39:57] Lord but then you have the other side
[1:39:59] and Hebrews 10 gives us a full list of
[1:40:01] all these wonderful Heroes of The Faith
[1:40:03] from Abraham and Noah and and David and
[1:40:06] all these different ones and they
[1:40:07] believed and then the scripture says
[1:40:09] they died having not received the
[1:40:11] promise like I said we know people we
[1:40:13] look at sister Erica
[1:40:15] Parker and she dies having believed that
[1:40:18] God is her healer having believe that
[1:40:21] she's a that it's a god of the
[1:40:22] supernatural they've seen many
[1:40:24] Supernatural things in her father's own
[1:40:26] Ministry in her own
[1:40:29] church and yet God
[1:40:31] answers or really they'd say God maybe
[1:40:34] somebody would say God didn't answer God
[1:40:36] didn't heal her no God answered God said
[1:40:38] I want you with me she had lived a
[1:40:41] troubled life I guarantee you she's
[1:40:43] happier today than she was yesterday
[1:40:46] guarantee it but in our disappointment
[1:40:49] sometimes we say we see people that have
[1:40:50] believed believed and yet here they are
[1:40:53] and they're at the end of it and they
[1:40:54] still haven't received it that has
[1:40:57] nothing to do with it but we got to keep
[1:40:59] Faith through that we've got to have
[1:41:00] patience through those things but watch
[1:41:02] how the prophet takes this thought on
[1:41:03] waiting of God waiting on God and he
[1:41:05] says God's waiting
[1:41:07] too he says we find God come this far
[1:41:11] waiting for the church
[1:41:13] too he said she she'll she'll be a bride
[1:41:16] she'll be a church that's spotless
[1:41:18] without wrinkle she'll be washed in the
[1:41:20] blood of the the lamb she'll be dressed
[1:41:22] in the Garment of the word she'll be
[1:41:23] dressed in his
[1:41:25] righteousness but where is she today is
[1:41:28] she exactly the way that he said it yet
[1:41:31] no but he says God's waiting too he says
[1:41:34] and she will be there but it'll be there
[1:41:37] God's what sent forth his word and he's
[1:41:40] waiting patiently for his word to do the
[1:41:42] work God's not
[1:41:45] concerned if he's not concerned Why
[1:41:48] should
[1:41:49] we he said says don't you worry he
[1:41:52] promised it he's waited all this time
[1:41:54] for a he says we've waited all this time
[1:41:56] for a resurrection there'll be one don't
[1:41:59] worry God promised it but he's the only
[1:42:01] one can call it he says he'll call and
[1:42:04] I'll answer him said job amen if the
[1:42:07] musicians would come I want to read one
[1:42:09] scripture and one more quote as we
[1:42:12] close Psalms 47 says this I had fainted
[1:42:16] in other words I would have
[1:42:18] fainted I'd have had no virtue no
[1:42:20] strength unless I have believed so I'd
[1:42:23] have had no strength unless I had Faith
[1:42:26] to see to have the knowledge of the
[1:42:28] goodness of the Lord in the land of the
[1:42:30] living what in the here and now he says
[1:42:33] wait on the Lord be of good courage and
[1:42:36] he shall strengthen thine heart wait I
[1:42:40] say on the
[1:42:41] Lord last quote we can all stand
[1:42:43] together if we would he says put him
[1:42:46] always before you let him be the next
[1:42:49] Crossing thing in other words let God be
[1:42:52] the one that takes the next step and
[1:42:53] then you
[1:42:54] follow then scripture says Thy word is a
[1:42:57] lamp unto my feet and a light unto my
[1:42:59] path unless the word goes Christ is the
[1:43:01] word unless Christ goes first we're in
[1:43:03] darkness he says let him go first you
[1:43:06] can't cross him so just keep him before
[1:43:08] you he said so and it's going to happen
[1:43:11] see keep him before you that's right
[1:43:13] always putting him before you
[1:43:15] remembering it was he that
[1:43:17] promised he said it wasn't me that
[1:43:19] promised it wasn't the Pastor that
[1:43:21] promised it wasn't some other minister
[1:43:23] that promised it wasn't some priest or
[1:43:24] Pope it wasn't no man of the Earth but
[1:43:26] it was God that made the promise and God
[1:43:29] is able to keep everything he promised
[1:43:32] all right he says if you got that kind
[1:43:33] of Faith to know God promised it say
[1:43:35] brother brandom I'm sick I need healing
[1:43:37] awful bad he says accept it it's a gift
[1:43:40] given to you yes sir if thou can't
[1:43:42] believe well you say I do
[1:43:45] believe let me ask you are you believing
[1:43:48] for something this evening he says then
[1:43:51] forget it that's all it's all
[1:43:56] over it's already done it's finished
[1:43:59] work we've read the back of the book we
[1:44:02] win we go through trials in life and you
[1:44:06] know sometimes we're in for the Long
[1:44:07] Haul because it took us a long ways to
[1:44:09] get into the pit and sometimes God says
[1:44:12] I'm going to let it take just as long to
[1:44:13] get you out so that you never want to go
[1:44:14] in again you take a side road you get
[1:44:17] off of the word of God you get
[1:44:19] disobedient you turn away from his will
[1:44:21] you don't do what you ought to do or you
[1:44:23] do what you ought not to do and you get
[1:44:25] off to the side and it takes you a year
[1:44:27] or two to get down there you know what
[1:44:29] sometimes God will take a year or two to
[1:44:30] get you back just so that you remember
[1:44:33] the pain and the difficulty of that
[1:44:35] decision so that next time you'll catch
[1:44:37] yourself way earlier and say I don't
[1:44:38] want to go through that again sometimes
[1:44:41] God makes us wait just because he's got
[1:44:43] to get other things in remember we
[1:44:46] talked about the big picture before and
[1:44:48] we can look through things with blinders
[1:44:49] and all we can see is is oursel but not
[1:44:51] realizing that we're part of a much
[1:44:53] greater work we're part of a much
[1:44:54] greater body and God's working in the
[1:44:56] entire situation to bring out his glory
[1:45:00] amen sometimes we need that experience
[1:45:03] of waiting for an
[1:45:04] answer to have that knowledge that God
[1:45:07] always answers always whether it takes a
[1:45:11] day whether it takes a week whether it
[1:45:12] takes a year whether it takes a decade
[1:45:14] whether it takes 25 years like it did
[1:45:16] for Abraham God always answers and he's
[1:45:19] building us up in that patience amen and
[1:45:21] then sometimes God's just getting things
[1:45:23] in position and that's it he's got a
[1:45:26] time for it like in habac there's a time
[1:45:28] for the vision to be fulfilled and all
[1:45:30] you got to do is wait for that time so
[1:45:32] that when it comes you're ready to go
[1:45:35] ready to leave ready to move ready to
[1:45:37] speak ready to act and all that patience
[1:45:40] is doing is letting you show that you're
[1:45:42] trusting God that you're trusting his
[1:45:45] leadership his provision his way of
[1:45:47] doing things and then God steps in and
[1:45:49] listen when God steps in it is almost
[1:45:52] always
[1:45:52] immediate he's been setting up for a
[1:45:54] long time God's the ultimate chess
[1:45:56] player he can set up a Move That You
[1:45:59] Don't See coming and then at the last
[1:46:01] end it's just that one move and you
[1:46:02] realize game over and what you don't
[1:46:04] realize is the game was over before it
[1:46:06] started because he knew everything was
[1:46:07] going to happen and he worked it all out
[1:46:10] and all you did was you just saw that
[1:46:11] last piece that gave you the victory but
[1:46:14] he had the victory all along he knew
[1:46:15] every move see God cheats he knows the
[1:46:18] end from the beginning God doesn't get
[1:46:20] surprised God doesn't get caught aware
[1:46:23] you know S I won't say oh he's he's
[1:46:25] sleeping Samuel had a bit of a a moment
[1:46:28] today where he was
[1:46:30] inconsolable and he was in his
[1:46:32] room and and I went in there to try and
[1:46:34] talk him down off the ledge and that
[1:46:36] wasn't working and so he he hid himself
[1:46:39] under his blanket and so what I did was
[1:46:41] I flopped flat on the ground so he
[1:46:42] couldn't see
[1:46:43] me couldn't see me and all of a sudden
[1:46:46] the crying stopped cuz he looked out to
[1:46:49] see if I was still there trying to
[1:46:50] console him and I wasn't so he's like
[1:46:53] huh and it flumed him for a bit so after
[1:46:55] about you know a minute or so Benny
[1:46:57] started to cry again but he was still
[1:46:59] under his blanket so I reached out and I
[1:47:03] tweaked his toe and then I flopped flat
[1:47:04] again you've never seen a baby stopped
[1:47:06] crying so quick he didn't know who was
[1:47:09] in the room he thought he was in a
[1:47:11] supernatural
[1:47:13] experience he had no it went dead
[1:47:16] silent it went dead silent I share this
[1:47:19] with my family
[1:47:21] after about 15 seconds cuz I didn't want
[1:47:23] him to be too freaked out I set up and I
[1:47:26] went Bo and he jumped from a seating
[1:47:31] position I was there all
[1:47:33] along and you know what he started to
[1:47:35] laugh and all of a sudden he was okay
[1:47:38] but I was there all
[1:47:40] along and he was so
[1:47:42] distraught and then something happens
[1:47:44] and he can't put it in into perspective
[1:47:47] he's like I know something touched me I
[1:47:49] know I had an experience I know I did I
[1:47:53] I I didn't imagine it but he couldn't
[1:47:54] see any evidence of anything in the room
[1:47:57] but I was there all
[1:47:58] along and then I and then when I stopped
[1:48:01] laughing I popped up and I let him know
[1:48:04] it was just me all along and I was here
[1:48:06] all along it's the way God
[1:48:08] is sometimes he just reaches in just
[1:48:12] you're like who touched me where' that
[1:48:14] come from been here all this time son
[1:48:17] been here all along daughter I know you
[1:48:19] didn't see me like those three Hebrew
[1:48:21] children no you didn't feel me no you
[1:48:23] didn't hear me but I was here all along
[1:48:26] I'm just letting you know I'm in the
[1:48:28] situation just have patience just trust
[1:48:31] me and I'll bring you through to the

[1:48:50] just something that it seems Lord but
[1:48:53] the reality is you're working on our

[1:49:17] 40 years to beat it out of Moses Lord I
[1:49:19] pray that we'd lose that idea of us
[1:49:22] being able to do it ourselves Lord but
[1:49:24] if we could trust your leading Lord of
[1:49:25] your Holy Spirit Lord if we can find our
[1:49:28] place and position in the word Lord we
[1:49:30] know that patience will hold us until

[1:49:46] other up in prayer Lord in bonds of Love
[1:49:49] Lord that we' let nothing come between
[1:49:51] us Lord Jesus Lord that you would just
[1:49:53] be a Unity here that Satan can't break

[1:49:57] of us Lord then nothing can break us

[1:50:02] rest in our hearts and souls Lord that
[1:50:04] we'd have that calm Assurance Lord
