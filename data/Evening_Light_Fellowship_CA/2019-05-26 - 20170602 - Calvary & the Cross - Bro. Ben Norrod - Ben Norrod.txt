now and some would think well maybe it was the early ages when 68 million lay down their lives yes the Holy Ghost was there and they were encouraged a man they saw beyond the curtain of time and wanted his step there and and to lay down their lives or they were going from this dimension to another but in this hour they weren't living in this hour they weren't living in this age where and it is written that that there's going to be very few saved they want to live it in this hour where it is written if he didn't cut time short there be no flesh saved so we thank God for his strength to keep us moving on his strength to keep us pressing on it is straight to keep us praising the Lord amen and encouraging us in the promise for this day and age in the promise that they were looking forward to that you and I are looking to the reality of it the resurrection and the rapture the change of our bodies can go in again going from time to eternity amen and if you're the bride and you got the Holy Ghost and you want to go you want to go from time to eternity Jesus yeah and I excuse me for repeating it but again in the Alpha ministry he was there for thirty three and a half years and he wanted to go a man well I've been here for almost 16 almost 69 years and I want to go by the grace of God so he knew where he come from he knew why he was here and he wanted to go back to where he come from amen so we know where we come from we know why we're here and we want to go back to where we come from we want to get into that personal fellowship with our Lord Jesus Christ amen in a glorified body a mansard rod Elpis brothers sister that we're going to be calling for it and praying for it and believing for the change and again to remind you what the prophets say that God is waiting on you God is waiting on me don't wait on the Lord you'll miss it God has given us the revelation so that we're going to move into it by the grace of God by faith on a daily basis getting closer to the Lord look up because your Redemption draws nigh a man so the Lord ever bless you and we welcome our visitors our sister Priscilla's mom and dad all the way from Tucson wondering where this weather came from a man so thank the Lord a man thank the Lord that it's been warm for a couple of days and believing that our brother and sister brought it with the a man so we need it and around and our brother worthington from UConn he went back a little or too early and he missed it a man so trusting that he'll get it up there as well in the Yukon but he enjoyed his trip here and thoroughly and I was talking to his pastor for quite a while yesterday so we'll keep them in prayer they need prayer it's only he's only part of us a very small fellowship I believe it might be 15 15 brothers and sisters and most of them are sisters so remember our brother Willie our yes Dwayne Worthington and his past pastors brother Willie and McGowan I believe and so pray for them the grace of God be with them and the grace of God of course to the bride around the world because things are getting worse amen but the bride looks up for hers getting better amen and the hope is getting more precious by the grace of Almighty God we're a man the world is going to give birth to the to this bride of the Lord Jesus Christ and again to is something else regarding the Bride of Christ we're not the father God said in 64 were not going to a wedding he said we're going to a marriage supper he said we're married here a man so I pray God that it become more and more real to us that that we're married and that we are we are obligated to him our Lord Jesus Christ amen the bride is subject to the bridegroom amens I trust that we are subject to him in his leadership in our lives day in and day out god help us brother and I pray that Jesus is wildly I hope he's as real to you as the person sitting next to you a man I could say shake hands with Jesus where where well shake hands to the person next six sitting next to you you're shaking hands with Jesus because he is it is it is Christ in flesh Amen because the brother the part of God said that the bride is the alpha or the Omega rather the bridegroom was the Alpha he said the bride is the Omega a man so is Christ in the bride Christ made flesh and to bring on that resurrection to bring on that rapture the change of our bodies so God's grace be with us so the Lord bless you and we're praying grace to our our brother being nor out and sister nor artists they fellowship with us we look forward to the hearing of the word and we look forward to the if they have a on their hearts to sing as they did here the last time God blessed us with their singing God has blessed us with the Ministry of the word and trusting and believing that God will do it again amen so let's do this let's appreciate it let's let's hold on to it because the hour is coming when when you're when you will hear it for the last time that's right when when I may be our brother will minister for the last time will hear the ministry for the last time they're part of God said the hours coming when will won't even be allowed to pray for the sick easier they'll shoot you and so on if you pray for the sick so that hour is coming and it's not far away because the worldís world is getting more and more religious but less spiritual and they want us to they want us to be religious but not spiritual it will be spiritual in their eyes it's fanaticism you know it's to try and say oh you've got to do this you got to do that and you got to live this way gonna live that way no they just want to live related religiously Wednesdays and Sundays or maybe just Sunday and just just occasionally here and there no it's giving your life for him it's not you the lives it's not me that lives that's tremendous as Paul said but it's Christ that live within me amen so I trusted you yes amen I trust that we can all say amen to that to that to that statement to that revelation now you could go over there and you could look back through your life and say well that's not me that's Christ in me a manner back through this day that's not me that's Christ in me help us Lord so we can truly honestly say that it's not me that lives his Christ that liveth in me amen so the Lord ever blessed us and we're going to turn to service to our brother being to give them as much time as the Lord leads foreseen and/or the hearing of the word I said I said if your message is not a certain lamb I said I might ask for a refund amen and yes because we want we want the whole truth nothing but the truth a man with no refunds don't take oh don't take away a word and also we just want what God wants and wants us to have and don't had a word amen we're just going to

Christ and sir appreciate the Lord tonight amen I want to the Lord helping us I want to turn tonight to Matthew chapter 27 I will speak to you tonight on this this thought to the place which is called Calvary to the place which is called Calvary I will read three places tonight start Matthew then I want to go to mark 15 and then Luke 23 just a couple verses out of each chapter but just to get a kind of a well-rounded picture if you will of this particular scene of Calvary Matthew 27 verse 40 and saying thou that destroyest the temple bill to sit in three days save thyself if thou be the Son of God come down from the cross likewise also the chief priests mocking him with the scribes and elders said he saved others himself he cannot save if he be the king of Israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him we will believe him cannot can I draw your attention to who it is talking this isn't the chief drunks the chief prostitutes the chief gamblers these are the chief priests this is the preachers if you'll notice right the very ones that missed him ones are supposed to know him they're the ones that missed him right mark 15 verse 30 mark chapter 15 verse 30 then we'll go to the Book of Luke now each each one of these are Calvary pictures truly but I want to try to show by the help of the Lord the different viewpoints that each rider gives each one has a certain vantage point of which they portray this and I want you to see each part of it mark 1530 saved thyself and come down from the cross likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes he saved others himself he cannot save let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross that we may see and believe what a statement you know it troubles me about that they're looking right at him in the last few hours of Jesus's life scripture after scripture after Scripture is being fulfilled like watching popcorn pop in a pan seven hundred and some-odd scriptures are being fulfilled they're looking at the word being completely manifested it went right over top of their heads let us see and believe what a what a terrible thing to go to condition to get into and they that were crucified with him reviled him now let's go to Luke 23 verse 33 and I want to kind of close the opening part of this reading with this particular chapter because here's where brother Brennan draws his subject for there they crucified him and this is this is on purpose here to pull this in Luke 23 verse 33 when they were come to the place which is called Calvary there they crucified him they're the most holy city they the most holy people crucified the most terrible punishment any man could ever be put through him the prince of life there they crucified him not the drunks not the mongers not the liars message people praise the Lord somebody message people that's the ones that crucified shame in shame but it's happening again it's happening in the day we're living it message people once again are looking right at the word and they're crucifying the effect of it they really don't realize that when they're against Pentecost against the moving of the Spirit and on and on and on they're actually doing the very same thing to Jesus that these people done 2,000 years ago that's right let's pray together Lord Jesus what could we say about such a text Lord the very depth of it almost baffles are mine but Lord we're looking to you denied to come and make this plain for us help us to see and recognize that which you would want to speak to our hearts tonight I pray Lord that you had just moved me out of the way Lord that I might be a vessel used Lord and that you would come and speak through my lips and that you would manifest your great word right here amongst the people god this little group gathered up in here Lord to hear the word of the Lord may you just open their hearts that they might receive all that you'd have for him open their eyes that they can see that which is necessary to see is God we are hungry and desires to hear you speak to us we pray you take your word now Lord and may you break it to us manifest it to us may you anoint us Lord that we might be recipients of all that you would say now as we look into the Word of God for this last day Lord of where we're living in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen god bless you you may be seated what a picture surely these people most likely didn't really recognize the depth or the the type of anointing that was falling upon them here they are with the Bible as we would say in their hand they have the ability to read the same prophets quotes they have the ability to read the same statements to hear the same type of preachers preaching and yet when the word is manifested before them of what they've been preaching about and reading about they were so blind they couldn't really see what it was hanging in front of them you know it goes to prove to us that unless God opens up your eyes there's no way that you can see it even if it's right in front of your face that's why I say to people many times if you can see what God is doing in the last day if you can see what the Holy Spirit is doing in this great hour you ought to be the happiest person that ever walks shoe-leather because there'll be millions upon billions of people trillions even that will never be able to comprehend nor recognize the word as it's been fulfilled in the day they're living in they'll make excuses for this and make excuses for that and oh you know I I believe the message and they'll have all of that but yet blind blind cannot see what it is that Christ wants to do with the elect of God with the Bride of God with the people of God and no doubt there'll be people that will be quoting quotes plumb up to the rapture and be recognizing certain scriptures all the way up to the rapture there'll be part of church services as we would say all the way up to the time the bride is taken out of here but yet blind still cannot see the full effect of what God has done for the people in the last day now to take these scriptures and to weave them together I I want to start at the initial foundation of what it is we believe in Christianity which is the cross of Calvary and I want to take this cross this old rugged cross and I want to talk about it for a little while but then I want to preach a little bit later about your cross because it was Jesus that has a cross alone but it's you and I that has a cross as well and we'll find in a little while that Jesus identified that we must pick up our cross and follow after him so the the part of Calvary that I believe has truly been ignored and the days we're living in in the the suffering of the Lord Jesus and the purpose of Calvary and what Calvary is to you and I has been so downplayed that if a man preaches on Calvary well he's not even touching the revelation of the hour but I Got News for you unless we preach the cross in conjunction with the opening of the word and all these other great revelations you'll never get a person in the rapture if you preach the cross alone that'll never get them ready to go out of here if you preach Revelation alone without the cross that'll never get them out of here you must marry both of them together in order to get the full revelation are you with me to be able to take the bride of Jesus Christ out of here and what you'll find is that there are many people around the ranks of this message that are following Jesus but they're doing so without a cross on their back and there's no way that you can truly follow him unless you're willing to go to the cross yourself now let me just read you a couple of things here just to kind of get a start here on on this about crucifixion some things that you may not have known about crucifixion but it is actually something that goes on even to this day in other parts of Asia there was just a case with the Isis group not long ago some young men and women had refused to deny Christianity and as a result they crucified these young people and left their bodies out to be destroyed by the Sun and by animals and what more just left them hanging out so crucifixion is actually a process that goes on even to this day and really there's never been a death that has been as gruesome or as brutal or as painful as crucifixion a lot of the reason why that it was such an intense thing is because that often the person that was being crucified will left there for days upon him and they learned how to work the the prisoner as they was hanging on the cross where they would feed them just enough give them just enough food in water so that they would go on living just from even more days beyond what they would have expired and the purpose of it was was not just a torture the victim or the person that was being crucified the thief or the criminal ever what it was but the deeper reason was because the government wanted to flex their muscle to the eyes of the people and let them know you cross us we're gonna cross you if you get my meaning they meant to show forth a message now Jesus himself was acquainted with the imagery of the cross when he walked here upon the earth because many times walking into a city or even at different spots around the city history records that there would be crucifixions actually going on all around the place they didn't always take them all the way up to Golgotha every time but many times entering into the city that would be maybe one or two or three outside the city hanging there crucified sometimes dead sometimes tied to the cross and still living and they would use this as a method to send a message to the rest of the people we will not deal with kindly with people that are against government or anti-government we will not deal with anybody that reproaches the king or that stands against our way of doing things so the imagery of the cross was their way of sending the message that we will not tolerate your disrespect or your disloyalty and yet here Almighty God takes this very same image that the government used as a symbol of their disrespect or so forth to the people for disrespecting them and Jesus hanging on the cross it becomes a symbol to every devil out of hell you break the word you defy the word right here's where you were defeated if on this cross right here it's a wonderful imagery when you look at the depth of it of what it is and then you realize of course that the the victim is that hung upon the cross often they would either beat tied to the cross or they would be nailed to the cross many times in the form of an X or in the form of a T and they would take a post and stick it into the ground oftentimes this to 300-pound posts would be sunken to the ground and then the hundred-pound crossbeam would be attached to the back of the person as they would walk up what we would call Via della Rossa the pathway to Calvary and they would take this cross this cross beam and strap it to the back of the criminal or the prisoner and they would have to walk himself now see this was also a part of the humiliation it was also a part of sending a message to others you mess with us we're gonna get you now remember this was capital punishment under this time period so it would be the same as you and I walking in sitting down in a little room watching somebody being strapped to a gurney and lethally injected or walked over to another place sat in the electric chair somebody throw the switch and burn up in the electric chair it was capital punishment now could you imagine the way that this must have looked to the disciples that followed the Lord Jesus and here we are brother Samson we're sitting inside of a room and they tied they tied Jesus into the electric chair throw the switch one punches the other hey that's my Messiah in there that looks strange but yet to the eyes of the public that's exactly what it looked like when Jesus was being crucified he was being crucified under capital punishment this did not happen to innocent men this did not happen to those that was just given a you know well you're just you know we just we just don't like you if they they had to absolutely commit a vicious crime and be taking so taken so seriously that when Rome would go to crucify this individual they was using that as I said to send a message this is a serious person this person right here is somebody not to be reckoned with can I tell you something that's what the cross still represents when you see Jesus hang in there it is a force that the devil should never reckon with it is a symbol of the bride excellence and power and glory because before the beacon can come a resurrection before there can come a defeat of Hell there must be the cross first must be the cross first they would display these victims as a warning to those that would attempt descent you don't like this government you don't like the way we run things this is what happens to people like you you know like what King says this is what happens to people like you you don't like the way we tax it like the way we do well let us show you how we handle business like that it's the same old devil when people try to make examples out of folks that break the law and man and they try to give them harsher punishments and what maybe they're worthy of doing what setting an example somebody break a small law and so they'll they'll put 20 extra years on him in prison when they could have given five months to do what send a message and Rome wanted to send the message anybody that comes against our government we're gonna take him out all the while playing right into the hands of Almighty God because out of all the ways that God chose for Jesus to die it was the cross that he chose to manifest the death of the Lord Jesus Christ if we think of it in modern terms he could have died in a chariot race he could have been robbed by a thief and stabbed he could have been shot with a gun or ever what it maybe could have been bludgeon by something he could have died anyway but he took the cross as an example for how Christ was going to be lifted up between heavens and earth as a symbol the most horrible punishment that a man could ever endure and remember this is not this kind of scene that Mel Gibson painted in his in his Passion of the Christ brother BAM said that you can in the movie if you've ever seen the film you can still recognize Jesus some but brother Brendan said when they put Jesus on the cross they had beat him beyond recognition you couldn't even recognize him anymore he looked like a piece of meat hang in there not a man he knew that the Bible said that his bones would stare at him and they did so whenever they took that cat of nine tails that often did dip it in some kind of sticky type substance and run it through glass and what more and as they would take that kind of nine tails and whip it on the back it would grab ahold of flesh and rip strips of meat off the back of the person and here Jesus going to Calvary with his ribs showing through well they'd rip the meat right off of his body this isn't just a Hollywood film with a little trickle of blood going down his face he was taking the cross which was one of the most horrible things a man could endure freeze God now you notice the victims were left on display as a warning to others as want you to catch this crucifixion was usually intended to provide a death that was particularly slow and painful whatever means that was necessary and expedient to that goal that's what they studied that's what they learned how to do and they became master perfectionist at holding a man at death for days and not letting him die you remember when they went to give Jesus to stop a lot of times we look at that as that was a merciful action it was not when they went to give him the salt the purpose of that was keep him hydrated long enough he'll hang on a few more hours well Jesus refused it it was just as just a furtherance of the hastening of the death of the Lord Jesus they wanted to hold that man there to make him suffer not because they care about what the man was or what he did they wanted to send a message to other people we are the great Roman government and you do not cross us we'll show you exactly what we're made of why would Jesus have chose such a place this place called Calvary Adam every place that God could have chose for the Lord Jesus why would he have made such a decision for Jesus to do to go to this place why couldn't he just get a disease and go off into the corner and die and then somebody just tell us he died for us because there was a purpose behind the cross that he could not avoid he had fulfilled everything in life that God had designed for him to fulfill remember brother mem said God cannot take you off this planet until your purpose in life is done and everything that the Lord Jesus needed to complete was over his next step in following the will of God was the cross his next step what's the cross what good would have done him to have great miracles signs and wonders raised the dead we shout glory to God Jesus never preached a funeral but if he would have refused to move to the cross all of that would have been absolutely void and pointless because he had to be so obedient to the will of God that when he laid the cup of the winepress of the wrath before the Lord Jesus he had to say father if it be thy will let this cup pass from me but nevertheless not my will but thine be done so you see the purpose behind the cross now I just want to take this slow just so you get some of these points the purpose behind the cross to Rome wants to put a man on display just so forth their great power and God used governmental action to show forth his own power I hope you're listening to him because brother BAM said down in the last day that there would be a boycott against the bride you heard the brothers say just a few moments ago their governmental power would squeeze against the elect of God they would try to stop them from preaching stop them from praying for the sick stop them for this stop them from that but in the hand of governmental power that's when the bride will shine forth and that's when the third pole will come to its fullness and you'll see what that has been temporarily manifested manifested in his fullness because anytime satan goes to squeeze his big fat fingers around the neck of the bride it's like trying to hold on to a bar soap in the shower hey it just slips right on out come on somebody you can't hold on to the elect of God she's got an exit strategy hey she's got away [Applause] Satan new looking at Jesus if this man is who he says he is and we're about to see something really great here so the devil and Devils moved on the chief priests hey come off the cross and will believe you say you who you are see the devil knew that everything that was prophesied of the Messiah he could see the type see Jesus could see the shadows he could see everything lining up in conjunction with what was supposed to happen and if this was truly the Lamb of God is John the Baptist said the devil heard it he knew what was being said about Jesus he knew exactly what was being prophesied of him and he knew if that man was who he said he was he was in some real trouble so his last-ditch effort to try to torment our Lord God was to come down and move on these people if you be who you say you are the crowd will see and will believe you know that's something about the Lord Jesus is something about real Christians too when you learn to turn off all of the naysayers and turn off all of the gossip and turn off all of the critics and turn off all that stuff once you get your eyes single that you're following the will of God you don't matter what anybody else says I do only that which pleases my father Amen that's what he had on his mind that's what he had in his heart no matter what they said he was gonna stay with the will of God we know the Holy Spirit left Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane we know that he went to Calvary died as a man yet at the same time it's very man that the Holy Spirit had moved off of again seventies remember he's becoming a sinner for our sake as they walked up to Calvary not as a savior not as a saint but as a sinner and dying as a sinner he becomes our Savior dying as a sinner he becomes a saint of the Most High but he had such a character about him that when Peter got mad and cut off mouthpieces ear he was able to attach it and you know what you couldn't even find a sword mark when he got done with it you know that tells me God believes in perfect justification when you mess up he can put the ear back on and not nobody can find the mark come on somebody that's why God forgive you and I that's the way he forgives me he forgive me so much that it's not even held against me it's as though I never done it same man on the cross of Calvary father forgettable what was it his character of who he really was it held no matter what was going on around him the cross of Calvary this place called Calvary now to look at this for just a moment in the way that Jesus was crucified on Calvary we understand as the Bible said he yielded up the ghost now this word and I might have shared this with you last year allowed me to do so again the word yielded that he used us there as though a general would be dismissing his troops and the Bible said that Jesus yielded up the ghost or yielded up himself when he died so not even death itself could call the shots on when Jesus would take his last breath he was all the way in charged to the very end when he dismissed his spirit and said it is finished hallelujah to show why he is not only the conquer but he's in control of every circumstance oh I hope somebody's hearing me tonight he is not only in control of every situation but he is the God that controls life he's the God that controls death he's the God that controls circumstance there nothing that gets without the reach of his great fans oh I hope we realize that one's sickness is coursing through our body and troubles are passing through our home and problems are arising at work and whatever more I hope when we look at the cross that emblem of grace and mercy that Jesus was showing and testifying I am in control of everything [Applause] the devil tried to get him to lose control let the Christ the King of Israel they didn't believe that dirty hypocrites had no no no right to use his name in such a manner they didn't had no right didn't love him they didn't have no mercy for him they had no right to use his holy name in such a scoffing manner that Christ that the king of Israel let him come off the cross if Jesus could have told him he'd like to probably look back at him and said I coming off this cross y'all ain't got enough money for me there's not enough that you could offer me to come off of this because I am here bound by the will of God by what the word said I'm supposed to do because I've got some sick children down the road that body strikes from my body they will be healed by the right hand down on the throne of my father and you'll sit down in the throne with me what kind of message can we learn from the cross this is what we can learn that when you think it could get worse and it's about as bad as it's ever going to get and you think man it's only going to get worse from here just remember if you're being obedient to the will of God in your life what looks like it's only getting worse and worse and worse means it's something really great great greats coming down the road somewhere praise be to God that's the reason why you must understand that out of death life is birthed out of death remember won the fair one that when the Greeks came to Jesus and they said sighs we would see Jesus he said except the corner wheat died there'll be no life it took death to bring forth life I listen to me if you want eternal life it only comes through death you cannot hang your Christianity up in a closet and pull it down on Sundays and Wednesdays and expect to make the rapture if it took a cross for Jesus it's gonna take cross for us hi let's look at this for a little bit Matthew chapter 10 verse 38 now let's look now at the words of the Lord Jesus now here's what's amazing to me is that in this particular chapter whenever he comes to this this is about six chapters preceding Matthew 16 where Jesus gives the keys of the kingdom to Peter okay once Jesus makes this remark out of all the things he could have said it makes you wonder why did he point to the cross I mean it's it's a simple thing why didn't you say if you want to follow after me such-and-such me anything but the cross but Jesus points to the cross what a strange thing it's almost like you kind of knew he was gonna have to go that way somehow Matthew chapter 10 verse 38 because I'll show you what the cross represents in just a moment but I'm kind of giving you a cliffhanger on purpose I want you to think if I give you the answer now you shut down time to go home and we're we gonna eat all that Matthew 10 verse 38 and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me how men wants to follow Jesus for an takes across takes across without the cross you cannot be his follower because it only comes through the cross that you could become a true disciple of his who you always shouting now you don't know what to say do you right you see how what it does to us this is why the people of this message I fear that many of the preachers coming on they're too positive about things or the bride and Friends people don't even halfway understand what these real message terminologies mean they haul our bride the holler elected they holler all that and a half the people in messes don't even know what you're talking about yet they want to move into deep things move into supernatural things move into spiritual things but listen to me very carefully it's gonna take a cross to get us right with God before we can ever move forward into anything spiritual it's gonna take this old rugged cross right here in our life if we try to bypass this we try to skip past this part and move on to the blessings it'll never work it'll never work now I know you're not stupid but two plus two is still four you got to have two before you get to two hit for that right you gotta do the first thing before you can do the second thing you cannot move on to conquering devils and conquer inhale and raise him on the throne all of that comes through the cross makes me wonder friends how many people in this message are following the message without a cross on their back notice this the guiltiest of criminals the basest slave robbers and authors of insurrections would often be placed upon the the cross of punishment borrowed by the Greeks and the Romans from the Phoenicians the Romans have fixed down to the time of Constantine the Great the punished even Roman citizens by this way of the cross nobody was exempt the cross holds of meaning to whosoever will on the negative side they all could be criminals liars thieves or they could be peaceable men that maybe roam just sought out to make an example of nobody was exempt from the cross let me tell you preacher deacon trusty housewife farmer factory worker painter nobody is exempt from this cross I'm preaching about right here today [Applause] nobody is exempt from their own personal Calvary you must have it you must have it to get resurrection life you must have this who you say but brother Ben I'm already saved I'm already born again great you still need a cross you still need the cross in your life mmm that's right what's your Matthew chapter 16 now now what this is after Jesus gives Peter the keys to the kingdom they brother left said a moment ago the Omega well we read the Alpha now let's read the Omega of this Matthew 16:24 then jesus said unders disciples If any man will come after me ah here we go let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me so the cross a man will take up is a cross of self-denial it's easy when somebody builds the faith to deny the devil it's easy when you build up the right kind of faith to deny critics and gossipers and everything else but how does a man deny himself how do you deny who you are don't y'all look at me like a bunch of serums and angels and holy people you know what I mean to you we have this idea in our brain that if I just overcome the devil I've overcome it all you're only getting started bub that's once you overcome the devil the biggest of all the overcoming these come that's the overcoming of your own self see if it greater-than overcoming the devil remember the prophet of God said this room could be full of Devils I'll just paraphrase he said this room could be full of spirits and not one thing would affect you until you allow it to affect you do you yield yourself and listen to me the end Matthias will read it in a moment the enmity in the Garden of Eden wasn't even so much the devil as much as it was Eve Satan might have pounded away at her day after day but it wasn't until Eve brother Ben said lusted after a PhD and opened up her mind to hear what the devil had to say that's what caused the great enmity because Satan was the devil was the devil was the devil all the way back and there's no telling how many hundreds of years might have passed that Satan wants that woman and she was veiled behind the Word of God but what caused the enmity not the devil human will caused the enmity and human will still causes the enmity go see somebody separate themselves from God watch them prefer their self over the word and it automatically separates them from anything spiritual ooh y'all are hanging in there pretty good you're doing better my folks did Wednesday night that's for sure I thought some of them was gonna pass that on me for sure now watch this Jesus now say let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me he tells them to Matthew 10 take up the cross he gives Peter the keys to the kingdom shortly before he goes back and says Alpha and Omega take up your cross can you imagine how this must have looked when Peters by the fire and Jesus as we would think of it as being strapped into the electric chair aren't you one of them oh I'm a boy he didn't want to end up on a cross next to him as they found out even walking with Jesus he might have been next he's a coward won't even stand there that fire burned that woman looking ahead and say you're one of them I can tell by the way you talk every time you talk you're talking about mysteries and seals and thunders and revelations a lot of them Charles said woman I am NOT and in one place the Bible said after he says the third time the crowed Jesus was standing in a place that he could turn and look at Peter as if to say I told you so you think you're strong you think you've got power but don't you understand the cross proves one lesson that once a person denies themself they're not only denying their ability for salvation to save themselves but they're also denying that ability to be strong to be the leader to be powerful to be smart to be savvy to be the lead guy or lead gal they're tacking all of that to across as you see when friends people get on the cross right they don't have the pride like you see swelling in some people around this message they don't if they're really attacked to this cross right here they are dying a humiliating death and let me tell you it is humiliation for a man a woman to have to ignore what they think about a matter and take the word sometimes over what they even think themselves because a smart man might look and say it doesn't make sense a whale swallowing up Jonah well then well don't have a big enough thought for it but if the man is willing to put himself on a cross he'll go back in the world we'll say it was a prepared fish not a whale he had a throat that he could swallow that profit on it or not the word would be the predominant thing but if a man's not on the cross he'll put up a website he'll put up proof you'll put up evidence that's a man not on the cross close friend of mine just a few weeks ago I was actually surprised in a way but another way I was I told my wife a year ago so wouldn't surprise me a bit if this boy actually walked off matter fact Barry's gonna be there either this week in her next weekend gonna try to help the church this man walks to the platform and says I'm done with the message I was reading a Jehovah Witness book and found out that some of the things they got there's some things that brother Branham preached and on and on and so this man Jehovah Witness who's an utter fanatic he had the message and that's where brother Branham got well I thought what a bunch of nonsense and hogwash I have no doubt that brother Ben didn't study after many learning men I have no doubt he was an angel of God tying loose ends together I have no doubt that he talked about Larkin and Charles taze Russell and and and Whitfield and all these I have no doubt that he studied after many of those men but at the end of the day it was God's revelation that he placed before the people not Charles taze Russell or Luther or any the rest of them but a man that is tied to the cross he's willing to lay aside what he thinks no matter how good it looks no matter how much proof may be laying before him listen to me friends you think this thing is over about people getting discouraged and leaving the message we've only really begin to see the the brunt of it coming on now it'll get worse because the situation is going to going to get harder sir church situation Church circumstances are going to get tougher and tougher and tougher it's going to be fewer places you can go and have confidence in fewer preachers you can have confidence in on and on and on and on but listen to me it is he that is tacked to this old rugged cross that will endure no matter what's going on around him or what everybody might say if they're attacked to this cost then stay with the will of God and ignore everything everybody else has said not my will but thine be done oh Lord [Applause] [Music] people that aren't on this cross something in the world is going to get them something in theology is going to get them something and their family is going to get them but if they're attacked to this cross everything they are is being crucified and yielded no matter if you're a PhD or a or an OD that's a matter of you the smartest guy or the dumbest guy when you go to the cross it levels the playing field for every person hanging there amen that's what I love about this crate this crate wedding supper we're being made ready for now we'll go sit there no doubt the chairs will be this high and then this high and then this high because as it was in history when a king would prepare a banquet he would have all of the certain guests at certain heights sit at certain parts of the chair that way when he walked out looked across that great table every person was sitting on the same field they were setting the level and no one above the other no one below another and let me tell you that's the reason I believe that I've got the same Holy Ghost that brother Branham had I've got the same Holy Ghost that Paul in them had I'm not less sir I'm not least I've got the same life in me that was in the Lord Jesus Christ himself and then can you say the same thing but a man tied to this cross here look at things differently he'll perceive things differently he might actually look at somebody and say you might be right about that I know that's miraculous around the message because everybody believes their opinions the absolute but a man that's tied to this cross he's not looking for a way to get a leg up he's not looking for an advantage he's yielding himself completely that Almighty God could take him over and out of the brokenness of his life can bring forth glory and bring forth power we need the cross we need it more now that we've ever needed it we preach to our young people around the message about brother Branham and about the message that's true but let's not forget they need to get on a cross before they start getting in anything deeper I'll show you just in just a few very short moments how that many people around this message if they're not careful they're gonna be following the message without a cross on their back and it's not going to do them any good send them to hell as Jesus demanded that a man first die die to himself deny himself died his thoughts I don't care how much they quote the message that ain't gonna put him in unless they're willing to hang on an old rugged cross died to their ideas and be born again by the Holy Ghost how do you a man Luke chapter 9 verse 23 and he said to them all If any man will come after me let him deny himself appear to nuuma apparent anemia to affirm that one has no connection with someone to forget oneself lose sight of oneself lose sight of one's own interests a pair of the meal good lord that's easy to do when it comes to the devil behind me Satan but to deny my own interest to deny what pleases me what makes me happy to deny that when the Word says this you say that ain't easy course it's not it ain't easy to die being on an old rugged cross doesn't make it easy for any of us praise the Lord it's not supposed to be easy it's not supposed to be an easy thing it wasn't easy for Jesus to admit that he was going to have to give up life he didn't want to die but the man who said he didn't when he's laying there and gets 70 he's thinking about his disciples thinking about his friends he knows what's landing ahead of him he needs he's seen crucifixion before and he knows what they're gonna do to him when they get ahold of him they're gonna make a real example out of Jesus he knows that and in his flesh he didn't want to die same thing with us there's many things that we hold on to because they're what interests us but are you willing to get on a cross if that's what it takes to obtain eternal life that's the question I want to know about many of the people I preach to are we willing to get on a cross because remember without the preaching of the cross there is no salvation friends if we've forgotten these principles that I'm preaching to you tonight have we put them so far out of our mind because we're busy talk about seals and thunders and statue of perfect man and on and on part of that is void if a man's not willing to die and deny himself they go get him nowhere ain't go getting nowhere Luke 9:23 said to them all If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me you want to follow Jesus we have to daily take up a cross daily we have to deny ourselves and deny what we want if the word says this way then we go that way that's usually the way it operates Bible says this we go that direction but when a man gets on a cross he said God the only direction I want to go is which way that words pointing the word says this I want to follow right with that word I do not not South the way I'll follow along with the revelation of God hello Riddick God now y'all are kind of looking at me like I did Wednesday night this is hardening this is tough be honest it's tough this is kind of preaching when they say with a rubber doesn't meet the road cuz you understand this is the part of Christianity that has so been forgotten around the ranks of this message we do you believe God sent a prophet yes I believe you believe that message yes I'm gonna read to you in just a few moments a man that followed the message to the letter but had no cross on his back and wound up in hell because of it mm-hmm Luke chapter 14 verse 27 well y'all ain't shouting but I didn't expect you to but this is good and this is true and this is going to help you nonetheless right Luke 14 verse 27 and whosoever does not bear his cross his cross his cross and come after me cannot cannot be my disciple you want to be his disciple then you got to have a curls without the cross there is no discipleship hey there's one thing about it they'll never be able to deny that true Christianity is represented in the ability of one person to completely deny self to let have it let the Christ have the right away you understand friends many times when people hold on to opinions I think I feel I this I that you're talking to a person's never been on the cross if they've ever been on the cross right whew I got you quite as a Presbyterians they ever get on the cross ride it's not I think I feel I believe it's the word said the Prophet said the message said the Bible said Paul said Peter said that's a crucified life a crucified life in that way does not allow themselves to put themselves before the word they can't do it I believe it will come to pass as I've told you before that people will wind up in hell because they have become their own absolute what they think is the way they think of what they believe is what they believe in you cannot budge them I don't care how many quotes or scriptures you show them that person is never been on a cross before it's when a person's been on a cross you show them the word Amen that's right that's the word you show them the message Amen that's what I believe it that's a person on the cross when you hear them that's a person not on the cross you've never seen anybody crucified saying hey they just yield themself Mark chapter 10 verse 21 now let's look at this message boy message man this is a message man the rich young ruler this is a message person hello praise the Lord this is not somebody from the outside a Pentecostal and on a Memphis Baptist Presbyterian this is a message kid y'all look at me funny got something on my face well this is who he is he's following the message of the hour the message of the hour is what Moses preached they're following a prophet they're following a message they belong to a message church they got message preachers come on somebody these are message people this is a message boy right here Jesus said you know the commandments Lord I've kept from my youth up what wasn't that enough following the message following the Prophet what not enough well Jesus didn't think so and this is why read with me when he and jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing that thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven hold glory to God don't you see it was money no it wasn't read deeper take up the cross and follow me listen close the problem was not money the problem was the man who was in love with his money did you hear me it wasn't the money it was the man himself he wasn't willing to put denial to himself delay all of that aside for the will of God okay you understand it may not be money for you but something else is laying in there just like this man here there's some something that the devil knows an old kid yourself the devil knows you he knows me he studies our life he knows what entices us what pleases us what makes us happy what he knows and all it takes is for the right proposition in the right time at the right moment when you're the most vulnerable and all it takes is one little bad decision and now this ain't like modern Pentecost once you're saved tomorrow you're not sure if he was we believe once you got to hold a ghost you've always got it but let's be honest just as this kid right here was following the message without a cross on his back so are there thousands around the world following this message without a cross on their back and they do things for God for each laborer heal the sick raise the dead cast out devils and their following of Jesus they follow him all the way up to the white throne judgment and that's where I'm Matthew chapter 7 Jesus looks down on them and they've said we follow the message we preach we've labored in your name and Jesus said turn around for me please you have no cross on your back where's your cross oh you know what I believe the Prophet I didn't ask you that I said where's your cross well aura I don't have one he said and I don't know who you are either depart for me you worker of iniquity I never knew you if we're Fellowship of the suffering of Christ we have to tack our self-denial to the cross of Calvary that's the cross for you and I today it's being able to tack our will our obedience everything we are attack into an old rugged cross hallelujah to be able to say Lord Jesus I'm still too in control of my life so I crucify that part of me let me tell you many of you sitting here tonight you want answers to questions you want answers to circumstances you want to figure out why you're still too in control of yourself that's why that's why God is calling us tonight to step back and take a look at the old rugged cross because right there lies many of the answers were looking for it's when a person comes back to this place of such crucified attitude and crucified life then the answers just start multiplying the answers to your questions will multiply when you start recognizing the reason this didn't happen is because you were still holding on here and the reason this couldn't happen because you were standing in the way of God come on now yo I know you can say Amen louder than this come on help me message kid all of these I've kept from my youth up but he had no cross it doesn't do them any good be able to quote the message quote the Prophet and tell all the revelation if they don't have a cross on their back it doesn't know good you say don't say that is the word then I'll challenge this I'll challenge your thought with this thought if a man's not willing to die to himself then according to brother branham he's still a sinner so what good does it him to memorize message quotes and message scriptures if he's still a sinner my wife read it to me this morning brother Bremen said if any man was to deny any supernatural working of God he is still a setter he's an unbeliever he's not willing to tak himself to an old rugged cross no matter how much he memorizes or how much he learns or she without this crucified life right here all they've done is compiled a bunch of things in their mind and that'll all be used against him at the day of judgment because then Jesus is going to say you knew this and you knew that and you were aware of this and you read this in the message and you read this in the Bible well I then you deny yourself and get on the cross it's true I'm preaching that lay do sins if I was preaching this in the emphasis church they they'd be tearing the walls out of the catacombs right now right but this is the age of people's rights what we want is what we want I'm sorry this is not Burger King you cannot have it your way the pinna that sounds hard I mean it's supposed to be easy this crucified life this is what real Christianity looks like but it's not the Christian has been presented to us be a good boy be a good girl there's no such thing as your goodness unless you're willing to tak it to a cross listen to me your goodness ain't gonna get you into heaven your goodness ain't gonna keep you out you're a sinner from birth and until God straightens that out you are on your way to hell that's why we need a cross in our life to deny everything about ourselves I know goodness about me I told Sam there tonight sitting down in Missouri he's a little old cabin they put us in back here and I sit back up there and then her and I was talking and I just was just kind of opening my heart to her and I said you know I think this is where the biggest problem is among the ranks as we travel what we see more than anything else is people just don't want God to be boss whatever he wants to do he's gonna do it whether I say yes or no or maybe or up or down or left or right or white or black he's gonna do what he wants to do anyhow but people try to boss God around and make him do what they want him to do and how could I as his creation say back to my Creator I want you to do it in a certain certain way I have no rights that's why I've got to tack myself to an old rugged cross how could I ever say to em I think it ought to be this way save that person don't say that how could I ever say to an Almighty God that knows the end from the very beginning I've been said marriage and divorce he could throw me in the dust anytime he wants to but how dare I try to throw him sheep sheep have no rights Barret can call snake can bite a tiger can growl but a sheep just lays itself out and lets the Shearer take its wool from it you know fight you don't struggle you don't wrestle come on now and Jesus was the Lamb of God and remember the only nature that the Holy Spirit can mate with is that lamb like disposition or to God and unless we've got that in our unless we've got that kind of attitude you no matter how much of the message of the Bible we've memorized it won't serve one purpose until we're willing to crucify ourselves thank you Jesus mark 8:34 what he called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me again and again and again and again and again and over and over and over again Jesus keeps preaching this theme because you realize the cross for Jesus was an entirely different reason than what Rome put him there for I've already established to you what Rome's purpose was to send a message about their power and authority but Jesus's cross really took place in the Garden of Gethsemane whatever he yielded his human will to what God his father wanted him to do that was the real cross what came ladder what came at the end was only what Rome had done to him my way of death but really he had already but went through his crucifixion when he gave up his own will and submitted it to God his father do you understand that the results of what happened in Gethsemane is what produced the resurrection later if Jesus would have not been willing to give up himself he would have never been able to lay his life down nor take it up but because he was so submitted to God who was his father he had the ability to lay down the son of man lays down as AI and picks it back up again because of the cross the emnity was not the devil the emnity was human will Satan just used human will to interject himself in the human race but the real real culprit of why Satan was able to overwhelm the woman in the Garden of Eden was because she yielded her human will over let the devil do to her whatever he wanted to do to her we'll say something now everybody hang on you can only do and live as you let God do and live in your life and you can only be overcome as much as you let the devil overcome you the power of yielding surrendering brother said one of the greatest weapons that he ever saw was the power of commitment being able to commit it over to God and say God it's yours not mine it's yours I deny myself I got to you Jesus can I go a bit farther thank you greater than Solomon is here search needs tonight not a soft hybrid something soft and flabby like the church is if you don't know what soft and flabby is just look up here he said the church makes a confession baptized and then you're a Christian he called that soft and flabby well isn't that the same formula that we plug in for message people believe the Prophet believed the message be baptized you believe the seals are open hey man you said there was I believe it believe it or not a cop for sure so what you're telling me right I believe it but without the cross in a person's life all of that is just sympathizing with the message I hope you're getting this church it's just sympathizing and brother BAM called it soft and flabby hard to run a race when you're soft and flabby believe me I speak from experience brother brems said to be a Christian is self-denial not self-affirmation not positive thinking I'm a great person I'm gonna be good today I'm gonna be smart huh that might help you as a believer to speak positively about your walk with God but we're not talking about positive affirmation of the believers walk we're talking about what it means to be a Christian altogether positive thinking mind over matter we'll never make a man what he's supposed to be you know other thing that I'll make him is when he's willing to get on a cross and the nice health friends do you understand why altar calls and the message don't work anymore because we try to get people saved without taking them to the cross I don't mean just the cross of Jesus but I mean their cross make a confession you want to be I want to be I want to be saved yeah you saw I'm sorry for my sins I want to be a cruiser yes I want to be a Christian and then when they walk out from the altar the very next day they go back to doing what they want to do and how they want to do it and the way that pleases them and they do their own thing and then everything they said at that altar was an absolute lie they can say their minute at the time but their life proves it really wasn't genuine you'll want to see an altar call really work for people put them on own cross when they're up here you wouldn't deny self you're willing to walk away oh I guarantee you brother you put up the test to him like that makes it a whole lot harder I have one guy tell me brother be and that sounds hard I said they ain't supposed to be easy dummy right well that's itself - now take up your cross deny yourself follow me daily today people are so soft well I got up this morning and the devil started telling me I'm not a Christian and I I'm not saved if he was a dead man on a cross it wouldn't affect you because dead people don't react there's the lord levan said you take a man he's dead he's dead you kick him he don't kick back you talk about him he don't talk back why he's dead let a man deny himself and die to himself no matter what people say about him or what anybody else said the only matter the devil said no matter what they say they're dead be not afraid with him said Christianity is self-denial Laurie you know get any quieter we're gonna have to call this the evening light Presbyterian Church the evening light Methodist which age you want to choose brother let us figure that out as we go along and if you understand what I'm preaching to you tonight only the elect is going to be able to make this live right here only the elect foolish virgin need not apply anybody else need not apply only the elect can really do what I'm talking to you about tonight because this right here is a quality that only a real believer can apply to their lives it's impossible for them to do otherwise because of a man's not really built in a way where he can die out to himself then it's just a bunch of words and Church association but you let paint glory to God the elect have the ability to deny themselves because they know that their self has nothing to do with getting out of here in the rapture not saved it works that any man could boast but by the grace of God been so long since message preachers have preached on the cross that people really don't understand what it means anymore to them it's just a cheap emblem that we use you know kind of like a cloud or a picture it's become so common to people that the cross is just an emblem everybody wears it Satan worshippers turn it upside down put it in earrings and on and on and on witchcraft folk use it in a different way as an emblem for their witchcraft and Christianity but what they don't understand is it's not just the cross of Jesus but it's their cross as well everybody loves the cross of Jesus after the fact but you're a cross is what's gonna make a difference whoo you need a five-minute take a big breath break Romans chapter 3 verse 25 now watch how how the Apostle Paul words this about our perpetuation now I just want to show you now what this propitiation is we hear this term often is applied to the cross of Calvary Romans 3:25 the propitiation but I just want to show you what this is well whom God has set forth I'm not Jesus now to be a propitiation through faith in his blood there you realize it's not the blood of Jesus that saves you no it's the faith in his blood that saves you but the venom said if you had a charger of the blood of Jesus Christ sitting upper like that you could dip your finger you could wash your face in it it wouldn't do not one thing for you but faith in that blood can change the center to a safe change a drunk into a sober man a liar into a truth-teller and change him all together well hallelujah somebody and change him all together faith in the blood of Christ can turn his whole world upside down so what good does it do for them to have 15 skulls of John the Baptist and 14 cross of Calvary nails and that has nothing to do with it and we're getting about as bad and a message with our relics pieces of brother Rams floor and I've got a piece of his sleeping bag I've got a piece of his shirt I've got a piece of his tie I got a piece of God does that matter to anybody right whom God has set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare whose righteousness his his righteousness well what about mine what am I chopped liver don't I have righteous don't I have anything no no not at all that had been pertinent he would have said something about it but he skipped it because there was no need even mention it it's his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of God thank you Jesus that watch the word propitiation simply means a victim it is spoke of in the Old Testament of the covering of the Ark and the holy of holies when the sprinkling of the blood by the victim on the annual day of atonement the victim signifying the life of the people and the loss of which had merited by their sins this victim was offered to God oh listen that God by this ceremony would be so appeased that he would look down on him and say from this day forward to another year I'll no longer look at you as a sinner I can no longer see you as a sinner for one calendar year you are no longer as centered in my eyes oh my god I hope you're hearing what I'm getting ready to say to you the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus at Calvary means that once not one time and then another and then annually but once once and for all the Bible said once he sprinkled the blood over my life he never never never never can ever see me again as a sinner we sing the song I'm a sinner saved by grace that's absolutely incorrect once you are saved you're no longer a sinner you're no longer just a no you're no longer a sinner in the eyes of God once you are saved it's over he always sees you through them eyes of grace why he'd offered his life as a living victim in Romans 12:1 when he said I beseech you brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice the word sacrifice there is victim so Jesus became the victim so that I couldn't be wouldn't be a sinner anymore and I've got to become a victim I've got to become a victim it's the only time in the Bible you're allowed to be a victim [Laughter] somebody it's the only time you're allowed to be victimized is when you're giving your life as a victim to him never again never again can I be looked at as a sinner that makes me feel so good I feel like shall we glory to God my my my thank you Lord Jesus in 1st John chapter 2 verse 2 well my clock says 6:18 up here I got plenty we're just getting started anyway [Music] [Laughter] 1st John 2:2 and he is the propitiation or the victim for our sins listen to me Jesus lived thirty three and a half years from creation from birth from childhood from adolescence to adulthood to Christ to it on Transfiguration to adoption all the way up to the Garden of Gethsemane not one time thirty three and a half years did Jesus ever feel guilty for sin in his heart not one time because there was no sin found in him he was spotless he was virgin and there was nothing in him that would ever make him lay in the bed of a knight tears coming out of his eyes like you did us God I need you somewhere god I need mercy I something's wrong with me Lord I Jesus never not one time ever felt the touch of condemnation or gilding his heart of being a sinner not one time and it wasn't until Gethsemane that he offered himself a victim do you understand this man that we call the Lord Jesus how perfect he was had never understood what it was like to be a sinful feeling no idea had no idea what it meant to feel the burden or the weight of a convicted heart he never felt it never not one time and then he sees the cup sat down right before him and he realizes this is more than a cross this is more than have my skin tore from my body this is more than people beating me to they can't recognize me this is more than a crown of thorns going on my head I've got to actually become guilty for every sin bride or not bride I've got to become guilty for everything they do so past present and future yes God poured out the winepress of his wrath and Jesus became a living victim did you imagine walking up to Calvary 33 and a half years he'd never know what it like to feel like to be a homosexual or to be a murderer or to be any other type of thing he never knew what it felt like to be a liar but now as he walks up to Calvary he can feel lying he could feel lust he can feel murder he can feel thievery he can feel this he can feel that no wonder he looked down on his own children no wonder he could not Harbor bitterness in his heart because for thirty three and a half years he never felt what it was like to be burdened with sin but here he is hanging on Calvary's cross and now he can look at them and he can understand why they feel the way that they feel holy to God glory to God he can feel he can see he can sense he can relate no no one who can look honorable such mercy and say Father forgive him they just don't know what they're doing because he could feel it for the first time in his life he could feel it but he was willing to become a victim Oh God god help me I'm not virgin born I've lived all my life with that mark of sin on my life but God helped me as a believer to become a victim so that you can mold me and birth me and make me into a son and daughter of God now just as he went without feeling that condemnation that's what Paul said he said when we cross the line between mercy and judgment he said a person can never come back to mercy but you flip that around we cross the line between judging judgment and mercy then you could never get back to that judgment part and now since I've been born again I've lived every day of my life not knowing what condemnation was all about a man because there is that nation to damage her in Christ Jesus they're free a victim a living victim first John 4:10 here's love not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his son to be the victim for our sins now watch this first Corinthians chapter 1 verse 17 I'll give you a moment to turn in I want you to read this with me right here this this especially this part here first John 1 verse 17 18 I hope you're not getting tired I'm just getting warmed up first corinthians 1 verse 17 for christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel what's stranger mark well that's it that the purpose of preaching get him to the water get him to repent get him saved well this is that what a preacher is supposed to get him in the message listen what Paul says here if this don't do anything to you tonight nothing you've heard thus far does anything you do not let this affect you right here he said not what the wisdom of words lest the cross of Christ listen should be a made of none effect which the word kino mains me make void of no reputation make empty deprived of force render vain useless hollow thoughts Paul said if my words can put you in that it makes the cross hollow useless and false listen to me carefully message people not only that not it's not the words of a preacher that puts you in it's your response to those words and whether you get on a cross after he preaches or not because there be many people that heard what Paul said there was many in his third pool of the day that heard him preach and they would blind it out couldn't hear another word he said go to the Gentiles they rejected what I've said so just hearing the words of a prophet won't put you in come on somebody but it's after you hear the words of that prophet preach are you willing to get on the cross or not listen to me and don't misunderstand a word I'm saying that's where a lot of these folks have believed just listen to the tapes and it's gonna put them in or believe brother BAM is gonna put them in or just hold on to what the preacher says gonna put them in they're missing the ballgame altogether because that's not how you play the game of life if you want to win you got to get on the cross if you want resurrection you got to get on the car listening to the tape will only make you a 2-fold than what she was before you got to be willing to get on the cross well I was somebody's hearing me for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved ah and us that are saved come on save people it is the power of God in other words let me put it in my phrases it takes what's been preached and makes it the opposite of null and the opposite of void and the opposite of ineffective it makes the word effective it makes the word have substance it makes the word have a have a feeling inside of your heart you know how when you're listening to the messages you've heard it over and over again but all of a sudden somehow you you give up a part of yourself and God answers back with some great revelation and it's just almost like it was just it's just so real I brother general said and like somebody's standing next to you was so real don't you relax what that was you got on a cross and when you got on the cross he answered back with the power of God from that cross and made that whatever it was real to you in a way the devil or websites or mommy or daddy or preachers nobody could take it out your heart ever again the power of God put it in there because it's something that that cannot be explained it's like going through that little room and the devil woman standard the clipboard tell us what it's all about we can't that's exactly the way it is you cannot explain a revelation from God all you can say is it was the power of God relations 5:11 we're not far now but still a little ways to walk relations 511 total Gerald make sure y'all get your money's worth Galatians 5:11 and I brethren if I yet preach circumcision why do i yet suffer persecution in other words y'all say that if a man is circumcised that's what will make him saved so I preached it and y'all still ain't happy then he asked him this question then as the offence of the Cross ceased so in other words your circumcision or uncircumcision isn't gonna put you in or take you out those days are over those days are over you imagine hard this must have been for these men that was these Galatians that was going around preaching to be a Christian you had to be circumcised in your flesh if you was a circumcised you really didn't give your heart to God reminds me of people around this mess if you're a Christian you won't have facebook and you won't do this and you won't do that legalism legalism legalism y'all looking at me pretty hard okay my turn people in this message will make a devil out of anything because the bottom line is they're really not secure and they're hard that they've got to hold a ghost themselves that's why they got to make everything sinn same people that fussing crow about Facebook are the same ones that lay on the telephone 24 hours a day years ago the telephones just as much a devil as a Facebook is you got to hold a ghost the Holy Ghost will tell you what's right what's clean and what's wrong it's exactly right people criticize brother Brennan for going down and watching the 10 commandments been preached against television shouldn't you stay away from that he knew what was right he knew what was wrong but Ram wasn't a dummy he knew how to follow the Holy Ghost you know we've done around this message you live a certain way sister's long hair long dresses brothers no shorts no jewelry all right everything just straight then I'll ask you the same question and Paul asked these people then as the offence of the Cross ceased so holy living is what puts you in huh well then why Jesus died because I read this morning where brother Branham said if there was anything you could have done about it Jesus died in vain come on somebody [Applause] so we measure people's holiness by the size of the heels the sisters wear yo y'all are getting quiet it don't scare me it just makes me know that you need to learn how to say a man when the Heat's on I believe in holiness I believe we need more of it but my holiness or abiding by holiness is not going to put me in a rapture no no that ain't what puts me in the rapture what puts me in the rapture is my faith in the finished work of Calvary and God sending back the token life as a result of that faith into my heart vindicating yes you are a believer here's the Holy Ghost is the evidence remember because it's not what I accept the Holy Ghost it's when the Holy Ghost accepts me man that makes me feel Pentecostal right nothing I could do about it if I could do something about it where the jail why he died what was the purpose of him dying if I can make something happen but here's why we do it no message all right buddy you believe the message that's what brother Bram said here oh you do oh man you're a believer oh oh everybody believe are you the guy how about this about this serpent see down here oh yeah see that how about this about marriage and divorce yeah that's exactly right mmm oh no no no no - stay right there with that word right there now oh you believe the bat I believe the message all right you got it boy you're on your way when's the last time we ever drugged him up and said you want to be saved you want to be right with God I got a hip you up on the cross all right let's get started now we're not supposed to do die but but what about all this other Oh we'll get to that eventually first we need you to die this is where our altar calls have went wrong because we tried to take him to step 5 instead of taking them to the first part without the cross the message will not have the effect on us that we need it to have it's still part of the Bible this is still Bible preaching and I my Bible tells me I don't know what your says over here in Newfoundland but mine says he that adds to or takes away his part will be taken out I don't want to take that part out of the word just a bit further forgive me Galatians 6 verse 12 as many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh they constrain you to be circumcised only lest they should suffer persecution for the cause of Christ for neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law so do as I say not as I do that's what that means basically hmm huh but desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh let me tell you you know why that guy's a believer I told him how to dress I told her I died verse 14 but God forbid that I should glory Paul says save a man in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ by whom the world is crucified unto me and I under the world the fusions chapter 2 verse 16 watch this and he may reconcile reconcile both under God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby don't you understand he rendered the devil Pallas when he yielded up his human will Satan could not drive a razor blade into his experience when Jesus yielded his human will incarnate assembly he was brother many said he was so yielded to his father and brother Ram called it a toxin he said they would use a guinea pig and practice on a guinea pig how to make sure a toxin held and he said when the inoculation came to Jesus it had to be tested to see if it would hold or not well all right and he said when he came to get fattening and the devil tried to get him to trade the cross for the world and for peace and for this that the other and Jesus yielded his human will for the cross and for what the father wanted but remember said it proved the inoculation from heaven how it held in death it held in trials it held in suffering and greater than he could defeat the devil because he yielded his human will said father not my well I don't settle down I'm gonna start speaking another language in man oh brother Bob I'm into my heavenly places with y'all are not Jesus Thank You Lamb of God one body by the cross having slain the L&T thereby you say but the enmity is the devil right but the results of how the devil was slain was because Jesus did what Eve would not do Eve yielded herself to the devil's lie Jesus refused to yield don't you understand I just preached to you how can I overcome that is the essence of how you can become an overcomer it's not whether you pray through or eat cereal with angels or have great supernatural things all of that comes with the life of a believer but when a matter one can become so consecrated to God until the devil take touch up there so that's what Jesus that's how we overcome and that's how you and I that's how he slain the enmity because he was willing to yield himself thank you Philippians 2 verse 8 mighty God we thank you thank you or chief Olympians 2 verse 8 being found in the fashion as a man why the Bible say this couldn't left this part out this whole thing about the matter why is that important at all don't you realize Paul was trying to show this human and he had to show this human element because it was through the human element that Christ came to the greatest overcoming of his life we're not going to overcome God or the devil rather as angels we're not going to overcome as infallible people will rid of God somebody but the bride I'm talking about the real elect of God is going to overcome this evil Age of Satan's eater that we live in as a man follow the Holy Ghost yielded to the Holy Spirit you're not going to overcome overcome the devil as being an infallible person that never makes a mistake but actually compromise you're gonna be the guy that's always messing up but it's so yielded to the Holy Ghost that when you do you say Lord I'm sorry forgive me keep working on me keep working on me Jesus it's that kind of attitude that's gonna put a man on the cross and bringing out the resurrection Jesus could have we have every reason why I shouldn't go I got more revivals I can preach I got more dead I can raise I got more but the will of God his next step in life was the cross of Calvary and believe this or not it was the greatest part of his ministry and the only thing that superseded it was the resurrection power when he raised on the third day Philippians 3:18 being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death Paul says even the death of the cross even the death of the cost founders of fashion as a man he humbled himself became a beaten to the death of the cost of Liberty 3:18 from any walk of whom I told you often and now tell you weeping they're the enemies of the cross of Christ let me work on your mind for a moment in our thoughts we thank enemies to the cross we think of people that are maybe picketing signs outside of churches and down with God and blaspheming God but really an enemy to the cross of Christ is any person that would try to lead somebody to Jesus Christ or to follow Jesus Christ without coming through the cross route so a preacher or some preacher or some leader or somebody in the message a father or whatever it might be that would try to lead people into the message without coming through the cross they have made themselves an enemy to what the cross stands for because the cross wasn't about Jesus dying as part of it sure it wasn't about him taking stripes that's part of it sure but to be many that was healed by those stripes that never go on to the fullness of what the cross meant that's right there'll be many for the mention a prostitute walks on the platform have faith to be healed go right off at a worse thing to come on or six months later never serve God another day in her life the stripes was a temporal thing for you and I brings our resurrection brings all these other things but the purpose of the cross was deeper than just divine healing the purpose was to show that a man could so yield himself to God that he could take away the enmity hang on everybody but the bride is going to become so yielded to the Holy Ghost that while she's living on this earth and Satan's Eden she's going to overcome every emnity every devil every spirit every evil come on now she's gonna whip everything contrary to the word not when the rapture come but before she's taken out of here she's gonna put her feet on everything there is to put her feet on and then why she knows how to slay the enmity she heald's herself over Colossians 1:20 and having made peace through the blood of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I said whether they be things in earth or things in heaven now listen Christ was not just going to reconcile that which was on the earth because remember there's some people that had already crossed over into paradise that needed this work of reconciliation - and every one of them died died like men died like women every one of them went to the grave that be a death Quran Zac gone dead every one of them with the same way every man's ever going to go that lives in a human body but in order for Jesus to reconcile and make peace between God and man it had to be taken through a cross now remember the cross wasn't just two pieces of wood but remember brother Branham said God crossed himself with humanity stretched his tent so there was actually a greater cross on the hillside of Calvary than just the old rugged cross but it was the cross between God and man and in that cross between God and man God had crossed himself with humanity he reconciled the world unto himself so it wasn't just the old rugged cross that saved me but it was that rugged there was that cross between God and man that saved me as well maybe you're not getting it but that cross is how come you and I could be saved if God didn't become us we could never become him come on somebody so we had to cross himself with humanity and by doing so ever he was able to reconcile in one body heavens and earth and all things beneath the earth and all things around the earth he could bring reconciliation through the cross while he hung on the cross [Applause] Colossians 2:14 blotting out the handwriting of Ordinances that was against us maybe you don't understand this I hope you can I think you can I believe you can but there was a handwriting of Ordinances what a man walked into the temple his sin was wrote down on this book right here they take the lamb sprinkle the blood and that sin was covered but next year if he walked in and had the same problem and they found that sin on the book he was stoned without mercy under two and three witnesses but Jesus he said lo I come in the volume of the book meaning the sins it was wrote down and the sins that wasn't wrote down the handwriting remember God keeps a record of everything that's ever been done or ever will be done that handwriting of the book of sin as it were symbolically speaking this little book of sin we could say that had every sin that man would ever commit God knew it from the very beginning when God became a man Jesus went to the cross he took that book and he tacked it to himself that's what the Bible said which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross so as it was he took this book of sin every sin you'd ever commit things you didn't even realize was Sam was against you and he took that sin book and tacked it to the cross took his blood and wrote his blood all over the outside hallelujah to the lamb of God he took that blood and washed away every sin that would ever be committed by the elect of God that's the reason why I could die in him in Calvary be with him in hell and take the keys and race with him on the third day because I was already justified when he took my and now to the cross of Calvary and no matter how hard the devil prize he'll never get this book off that cross my Jamie I wish I wasn't old now that way I could shout like I want you Hebrews 12:2 what a great scripture to finish on looking unto Jesus the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross I have a hard time getting my mind how that he had any idea what I was gonna be or how was gonna be or how was gonna go about being it I have a hard time figuring out into the sea of people that he'd have to weave through and wade through how he had me on his mind but that's what makes him so great because he doesn't see even a flea bad as I but what he don't know how much talos in the eye he don't see a sparrow go hungry but what he don't send down your McDonald's french fries it was too stealing you threw him out the window Jesus was feeding sparrows with him come on somebody he knows he knows he knows everywhere we are and everywhere we're going to be and everything we've ever been in his mind he saw us in this way of perfection he saw us in the way of maturity as manifested sons of God but he also knew the way we would come to this earth the only way that we could ever raise up to that great place in God is he would have to take what we came to this world in sin iniquity speaking lies he'd have to take every bit of that upon himself and tak it to a cross now if my sins are gone then the only thing that I can do after that is from here on out every day of my life so under my will to what his word has to tell us that's what I meant preachers nowadays are too nice they're preaching positive thinking they're preaching positive living and and and and heaven and God and rapture and all of that's great but it makes me wonder we've got a whole generation of people coming up now and many of may never really heard the cross preach like they need to hear it preached and many of them know how to start that's the reason why some of the young people sit around this mess is I don't even know if I got to Holy Ghost none it's because they've never been taken to the foot of the cross and shown how to die out so that Jesus could be made new in their life that's the reason some of us still struggle with things trying to figure out what's the answer what's the solution what's the we got to go to the cross that's the answer you want rapture you want resurrection you've got to go to the crops that's the only things gonna take us there god help me to stay tied to an old rugged cross so so so so so much more than I could say but as we say at home I think you get the gist of it if we don't understand perhaps what that means by self-denial let me give you a small example it's as if a person walking through their day would have certain thoughts that they meditate on certain things they could they they contemplate it could be with the word could be not with the word but we we entertained through our mind different thoughts a lot of times if we're not careful what the devil does is he uses them thoughts to start building a case of something either something's trying to trap you into or discourage you with or ever what it is but this is why Paul said first Corinthians 10 bring every thought to the obedience of Christ this is what crucifying yourself really looks like bringing every thought to the obedience of Christ no matter what it is make sure it lines up with the word at a young man write me today brother band I've had a certain dream into certain dreams this way and I saw this figure and it was this way and that way and I said brethren this is the problem with dreams nowadays brother branham said if it's not a prophet in the land it cannot be a simple thing to be interpreted it must be a direct message like you said fear not to take Mary thy wife there was a direct message symbols and all that stuff remember said those things aren't for us today so when you see dreams I can't they're full of symbols you either need to take you a pepto-bismol before you go to bed or quit eating burritos for the nights over I'm talking to you Joe because those are not inspirational things but you see how quickly people will take a dream or some kind of supernatural to start building a case and a lot of times the devil knows that down the road if they hold to that fault like you talk about that gun shooting a certain way you said if it gets off just a little bit up here when it gets way down to the target it's way off down on the end of it down there and say that's where we have to be the most careful a certain thought go through our mind you make sure that thought is crucified with Christ on Calvary because that thought may be the very thought that leads to a believe the sign web site or it leads to a preacher that's not telling the truth or leads to a dot dot dot get lead anywhere that's why we need to bring every thought Oh B D n't to the mind of God God help me help me God help me please help me more tell me it's practica thank you Lord Jesus for your word tonight God we are so grateful once again Lord in this little place called the rock you've come down Lord and spoke to us so expressing ly we thank you so much Lord God as I told the brothers today just

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen praise the Lord thank God for the word Amen than I trust by grace it's a revelation to our hearts Amen then we also bear a cross and I was thinking of the scripture and our brother was to have his looking forward looking for it and that as our brother was ministering concerning you know to know him and the power of his resurrection and again I keep remembering with our brother Bill Hagin said years ago and I was that was in the church and that was back on the platform somewhere and he was that he was ministering and he sent he quoted that verse and he said in Pentecost we only quoted the first line and he said we said to know him in the power of his resurrection we stopped and he said but now he said we need to go on and he said to know him also in the Fellowship of is suffering a man and to do that we have a cross severe a man so and again there was a song and the song is take up that cross and follow me and it says I hear the blessed Savior call how can I make a lesser sacrifice when Jesus gave us all a man so there's a cross for us to bear by the grace of God where any easy there to enable us to bear he's there to give us the strength to bear it and I mean there's also a scripture that came to my mind and in my heart right I believe and our brother read it a million our brother read that brothers is tremendous I trust we will not forget it don't go I don't know go and try to live your life and think well Jesus did it all Jesus did it all but we're going to identify with him in the Fellowship of his suffering amen he suffered now we suffer amen in appreciation for what he has done he suffered for us now we're going to we're going to endure this and endure this and endure that for his sake and for the glory of God and then the any reference Luke for Dean and I ministered I'm not not long ago concerning those who are called to the marriage the lame and refused and because they were selfish they weren't they didn't want to bear no cross they wanted to do what was in their own eyes but was right in their own eyes and so on and you know and they said we'll go call this one and he said I can't come because I bought some land I got to go check it and I can't come because that I bought five yoke of oxen and I got to do this I can't come because I got married and I can't do this and he had and he said well he said they won't taste with my supper no no they were not willing to they were not willing to lay it all aside pick up their cross and go and go in obedience to the master to the king amen they made to pay a price you got it you got it first see and crying let that be crucified what you want to do what does God want to do a man then let it England here will be crucified so if we're going to do the will of God no even the powers resurrection and in the Fellowship of its suffering amen god help us amen so then again a knee and he went on and he said they won that I can taste some of my supper and he's a good into the highways and byways to give the lame the halt the blind brilliant even those that were occurring crosses those that had a cross willing to carry across a man and not complaining by the grace of Almighty God they were going to use this as an excuse or that as an excuse I can't afford it and I can't I can't do this and I can't do that no no they they they honored it by the grace of Almighty God and Jesus said none of them those that men which were bidden shall taste of my supper none god elvis not all believers are going to taste of the summer as he as he said that all believers are going to be in the resurrection and rapture any man only those that had that have laid down their their lives and they picked up a cross a man says that I walked one day along a country road and there a stranger journey to bend blow beneath the burden of his road it was a cross a cross I knew a man sir we all that crosses to bear they made every one of us there's the challenge of our faith by the grace of God amen and he said right here and he said if any man come to me and hate Nadia's father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters and his own life but that's a cross that's a cross it's not not doing what I thought I want to do I do what God wants me to do and he said he cannot be my disciple it can't be my disciple and our brother quoted verse 27 whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple to bear the cross of total separation unto the Lord the better the cross has taken your stand for Jesus regardless a million and on down he said he says so likewise whosoever he be of you that forsaken not all that he has he cannot be my disciple that's tremendous rather than revelation of the cross it is absolutely tremendous wonderful so I trusted that you will not forget what God has spoken tonight and if necessary go get a coffee and listen to it again and listen to it again and listen to it again amen and say lord help me to take my take the cross amen by the grace of Almighty God so there is a cross to bear it may a might have to do with your your personal light it might have to do with your family your friends your neighbors they might have to do your your your your income I don't know but God knows but we bear it but what is what God allow it all that for to test our faith and then to bring out the Christ in us amen what he did not my will father then be done amen those though those that were invited to the supper you know with the land and the oxen and the marriage and all that they were going to say not my will father thine be done no not on your life they want to do what they wanted to do amen now the will of God by their own will amen so this thing I love him because he first loved me and me and prayer for our brother as it comes to minister of the word again tomorrow night hey man said that ask God Lord whatever my need is whatever my brothers and sisters need Lord I pray that you'll anoint our brother with that revelation by the grace of Almighty God I love him because he first loved me but that one verse another verse rather from that him well let me bear thy cross dear Lord I cried and lo across for me appeared the one forgotten I had cast aside the one so long that I had feared a man so let's take our bar cross and let's follow him do it with you well why why for the glory of God show your appreciation for Jesus look what Jesus did for us amen oh I'll do anything for Jesus hey man let's do it for Jesus I'll tell you he'll bless you and he'll bless you with
