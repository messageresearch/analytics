so we'll hear what the lord will give us today amen the will of the lord be done amen so be in prayer for our brother as he comes to minister the word but also i i want to pass on greetings from our brother ed cater he called two or three nights ago and he sends his greetings to the saints here and he's requesting our prayers for him in there and uh i understand that today around two o'clock he will be having service in grand falls windsor area so we pray the grace of god to be with brother ed cater amen been many many years since i've known our brother because when i first come to the word and that was i guess in 79 or 1980 that uh brotherhood was part of brother cater's family amen of course his brother a caterer brother alan cater and brother alec cater and so brother alec of course is in i believe in new brunswick or nova scotia and brother allen caters with brother danny olson's church in ontario but it's been a while since brother ed of course been serving the lord but of course when he when he turned back and gave his art to the lord again uh he did come here and he and he did give his testimony here so the lord willing he'll be starting a is as it were a church in central amen because there was a number of churches there and when i first came but now of course it's all down to just almost i guess in a sense one but even the pastor's gone there now that was brother guy's assembly and the last time i ministered there i'm sure i ministered to around 70 believers but now it's it's really down to just a few maybe eight or nine believers so but brother is going to we'll be starting another church there this afternoon so god's grace to brother cater and uh also be in prayer for his son tim he uh advised me that tim was in here and he had surgery and maybe he's gone back home now to central so we pray for his son tim and i'm not sure her name tim's wife so god's grace be to them amen so thank the lord for bringing us back together in fellowship again with our brother ed keator it's been many many many years amen to god be the glory and we thank god for his grace to us in this assembly here and all that has happened that we we're still maintain our faith we maintain our love for the lord amen our hunger and our thirst amen to god be the glory amen so be in prayer for our brother jonathan as he comes to minister to us amen and uh that god will minister to you personally he'll let you maybe god ordained this god predestinated this to happen so that our brother's going to going to say what you want him to hear amen by the grace god and not not you want him to hear no he's going to say what you need him to hear what you need to hear amen by grace and we welcome our sister again today and uh we were there to help our sister salfina yes sir okay praise the lord so god god bless her amen so and uh of course any of the other saints that might be visiting sometime god's grace to them and again uh brother ed did no doubt he may be online now he did uh tune in online i think it was last sunday or on wednesday when we had a service and he expressed appreciation for the word amen so god bless them today and whoever may be online amen across the island or maybe sometimes around the world god's grace to us amen grace because we're ministering to the bride of christ amen and understand this ministering to give faith amen for the rapture faith for the resurrection because that's what god's doing now we know what he's done all the way down through the ages and he did this to give that faith that to give that faith but now he's doing this to give us the faith we need for to get out of here the resurrection the rapture grace to us amen so let's stand and as we turn to our brother jonathan we'll sing only believe all things are possible only believe give the glory to jesus amen only believe oh living [Music] all things are possible only be yes amen praise the lord yes hallelujah believe the word hallelujah believe god amen amen all things praise the lord just believe god amen jesus is here jesus is here all things are possible jesus is here jesus is here jesus is here amen hallelujah [Music] because jesus is here amen hallelujah lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible lord i believe amen amen just to pass on some information that sister basically we just received uh email from uh so i want to remember them in prayers understand brother carr sister and brother carmen and his wife and a few others in the church they've got coveted 19. so we pray the grace of god to them amen so keep them in prayer amen so the lord be with them today i i don't know if they'll be gathering much today but they're not not gathering today in the church because the rules and regulations in new brunswick is not just a few there there were no they weren't allowed to get together no church was allowed to open so i uh i'll assume they'll get together for worship i don't know but be in prayer brother we're at the end amen look up our redemption is that end god's grace jesus god bless you brother god bless you amen let's bow our heads if we would heavenly father lord we've just sung that we believe lord and according to our confession lord we're claiming it for this service this morning heavenly father lord that as we've sung the songs of worship lord as we've invited your presence into our midst lord so lord you are here because we've got two or three gathered in your name and lord we're lifting up this service lord each one pray that you grant me grace set me aside lord help me to settle down lord pray that you just grant the people grace to just pull on the gift lord that your word would have preeminence lord that your presence would be real amongst us sword lord go into our lives we want to be changed lord we want to be drawn up into higher lord heights and deeper depths of your word lord we want our relationship with you to grow stronger lord we want to be separated from the world that's around us grant us your grace lord this morning we pray minister to each heart and soul we ask in jesus christ's name we pray amen god bless you thank you musicians if you'll turn the scriptures to titus ii titus the second chapter and this morning i have notes but no slides i felt i was safe as of nine o'clock last night but apparently i was not so i didn't do slides i'm sorry so i'll try and go a little bit more slowly certainly on the quotes when you can read it i i usually rip through it pretty quickly but this morning we'll we'll try and take our time a bit amen titus 2 verse 1 it says but speak thou the things which become sound doctrine that the aged men be sober grave temperate sound in faith in charity impatience the aged women likewise that they be in behavior as becometh holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chaste keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of god be not blasphemed amen god bless his word you may be seated we spent the last couple of services speaking on bride authority we showed how the bride of christ receives authority she does not take it it's not something that she wrestles with it's not something that she fights for but it is something that is given to her amen and that we know that christ is the one that has the power it is christ that has the strength that is christ that has the abilities and all we are doing is we are going to him and we're taking advantage of what he has to apply to our situations and into our lives amen he gives us authority to call him on the scene amen and we talked about the token as brother ellie mentioned his prayer that we hold that token before us when we go into prayer and that is what proof that he has given us the authority to ask for things and to receive what we would ask for amen but we talked about when it comes to bride authority that the key to it is always that trusting and loving relationship amen and it's not just him to us but it is us to him the thing that god's doing on this earth right now is he's getting us into a place where we will trust him completely because if we will have full obedience we have to have full trust amen we've got to believe that the word is and will do what it says it will do amen we've got to believe that god is who he says he is and that he has the power to do the things that that we would want him to do so the greater trust that he has for us the greater the authority that he gives us but again it's got to be that we trust him because with that authority has to come trust to do it the way he would want to in the way that he's asked us to rather than pulling things to ourselves and doing it in our own strength amen and you're of no use to god if you don't trust them because there's going to be times where god says what no we're going to go to him in prayer about a situation we're going to go to him with the request and god is going to say one of two things sometimes he'll say no or he'll say wait and that's where the trusting relationship comes in is because you trust that he sees something that you don't see you trust that he has a bigger picture in mind and so you're willing to wait on the lord rather than try and ram it through by just i'm a christian i'm a bride of christ in these different things and say you owe it to me you said whatever i asked i give it to you no we have that trusting relationship with them where when he says just hold on a second son hold on a second daughter that we are resting in that that he's going to do what it what needs to be done in that situation at the right time amen so if even if we trust him completely he has to trust us as well and that is done by what proving you over time he puts you into situations to see what you're going to do to see if you'll stick to the word to see if your full obedience will shine through or if your human nature if your human character will bleed through and he knows that he's got to work with you a little bit more before he puts you into a higher level of authority and trust amen because we don't run around doing everything in jesus name do we we've got to do what he wants us to do in his name amen we have to be focused on the kingdom purpose not on our own purpose and that's what he's looking to see in us amen like we talked about last service we read the quote where brother branham said we'd have to pray in every situation amen well what are we doing we're going and we're talking to our husband we're going and talking to the bridegroom and saying what do you want us to do in this situation you've given us you've given us authority you've given us gifts you've given us discernment you've given us knowledge you've given us all these things but what do you want us to do in this situation because we're still bound in a body that's two-thirds uh unredeemed amen and unredeemable if we could put it that way amen but just as a quick refresh remember the authority we're under is what tells us how much power is available to back up what we're doing amen and so when we come under god's authority we have unlimited power because we read that all power in heaven and on earth is given to him so if we can come under god's authority then guess what we have all power in heaven and earth is behind us to back us up as long as we are in his kingdom authority amen as long as we are doing it for the purpose of his kingdom but what happens is when we go under our own authority then we are our own limitation and as i pointed out we have a certain amount of power we have power to create we have a power to make to manufacture we have power to choose how we eat power to make money and how to spend it and when we look at that so often we do so poorly and that's why god doesn't give us power right he gives us authority and then he chooses to apply that power or not apply it amen and the other thing is is that when you're on your own side when you're under your own authority then you're not on god's side are you so there's only one other authority that you're under then and that's going to be satan's every time when we fall into our own thinking when we fall into our own ways when we fall into man's ways of doing things we are putting ourselves on satan's side every time we don't like to think that but that's what's happening because if you're not for god then you're against god there is no offense right the fence belongs to satan if you're on the fence you're on satan's side because you haven't committed to god right so he's got to know that you're going to be on his side and doing what you're doing amen so that's what we were preaching to the whole congregation that's to the brothers and sisters collectively as the bride of christ but we want to bring it down now to our sisters specifically because the the principles that we talked about of a trusting relationship a loving relationship they come right down into where our sisters live every single day and we want to tie that in there and the the principle of a trusting relationship is the key to all of this and that's that your husband is going to have to trust you your father if you're a single sister is going to have to trust you before he gives you any authority in the family name and those different things amen so the key here is us men have to earn that trust god doesn't have to earn it god is god amen he is the great sovereign one he's yeah we were made for him right and so he doesn't have to earn it he proves himself he proves himself by his word but us men are in a fallen condition so we're asking the women to trust us and we have to earn that trust don't we we have to day by day show that we put the concerns and the cares of the family and the body of christ above our own because by nature we're selfish so we have to earn it and so the men are having to do a work there and then the women have to what have faith that we're going to do the right thing and even after we don't do the right thing they still have to keep having faith that we're going to do the right thing that god will continue to grow us and and teach us and mature us to the point where they can trust us fully where what they trust us as much as we trust them right it's got to be back and forth for both of them now we open with this scripture and titus for a reason and i want to dive into it a little bit a little bit deeper because we have to know our position to know our authority like we said before if i work for the prime minister's office i have the power of the prime minister behind me but if i work at canadian tire i have the manager of canadian tires authority behind me i'm limited by my position so i have to know my position inside the relationship that i'm in amen and if i can know my position then what's going to happen then i can act within it and then i don't make a big mess of things and i don't get out of out of my place i mean if i'm at my job and i start trying to act like my boss the director what happens i make a big mess for my director i i i uh you know cause my coworkers to not think very highly of me and i make a mess of my own life as well don't i because i'm trying to act in his stead when i don't have that position but when i can stay in my position then all of a sudden things work really well because i'm acting within the authority that i have in my own job right what is it when i get out of place it causes trouble above me and below me and with me but if i can stay in my position that things tend to work out beautifully so brother braham says this in the message the easter seal he says jesus was so full of quickening power he said if you can destroy this temple that took you 40 years you thought to build i'll raise it up in three days why why could jesus say that he knew that he was amen i wish i could make that stick he knew who he was he knew that every word god had wrote in there of him he had fulfilled it amen he knew he was the one david spoke of do you know you're the one the bible speaks of do you know your position is in christ if you're in christ you're a new creature do you know that this word is just like everyday living to you is the word everyday living to us that's what it's supposed to be why sure it's yours you're an eagle that's your food and he knew that by the power of god he would do it because it was prophesied he would do it he didn't know it because he thought about it and he sat down for a while and said you know what let's let them kill me and then i'll raise up but he went into the word he found his position and as he fulfilled that position and he saw it coming to pass in his life he said that means the rest of it's got to come to pass as well so if because it's happened now let me take it into the future and i can speak with confidence that the thing that is impossible is going to happen because it is prophesied of me because he has proven who i am that means the rest of what he said i'm going to be is going to happen as well amen that's the reason he wasn't scared to say destroy this temple and i'll raise it up in three days because david said i'll not leave his soul in hell neither will i suffer my holy one to see corruption he knowed not one cell of his body could corrupt and it corrupts in 72 hours so he said destroy this temple i'll raise it up again in them three days why he was so full of that quickening power that quickened every word didn't quicken his every thought it didn't quicken his every idea but it quickened every word that was written about him in his life even into his very body amen he says he looked back and saw every word god wrote to him and the prophet said he fulfilled it and he know that will be fulfilled too amen he found himself in the word he recognized his position and he stepped right into it and with full confidence he said you'll kill me but i'll raise up in three days what a thing to say amen never happened before that somebody gave his life and rose himself of what his own word but yet he was willing to do it so i want you to see three things here jesus knew what was written about him in the word he knew his word position right not because his family said so not because his colleagues said so not because his disciples said go said so but he went into the word and he said the word says this is what i am and it's proven in my life and then he knew that he was living out what was written about him in the scripture now jesus knew his scriptural boundaries because remember when he gets up in the temple and he reads from isaiah he doesn't read the full scripture because he knows his position is now to do something different than what the end of that scripture said when he comes back what in the tribulation in the millennium that's when he gets to go to do the last half of that scripture so he stops in the word because he's what he's bound by the word the word is setting up a boundary on his first coming and he cannot cross that boundary and still be what he says he is he sticks with what the word says about him amen he knows where it's supposed to be he's not there they're under oppression they could have used that messiah that's coming in the tribulation in the millennium couldn't they they were ready for it but that was not his place but if he had listened to the people around him if he had listened to peter that kept drawing his sword if he had talked to the zealots and listened to them they would have said you've got the power deliver us from the romans but in the word he knew he couldn't do that he was bound he had boundaries on his position though he was a god-man amen and then what the third thing is that he knew that if he did what the word told him he must do the rest of the word written about him would be fulfilled remember brother braham says full obedience is what entitles you to the token right and the token is what's going to take us all the way through isn't it the token is what's going to give you power to stand when everyone else falls the token is what's going to give you patience when everybody else is all fussing and fighting right the pa the holy ghost is what gives you rest when everyone else is in chaos right that's what's going to take us through amen you have to know your word position and that's what jesus was showing there is i know who i am and i know the limitations i have we've got to know that there are limitations to our position amen we don't run around taking off satan's property satan has property that belongs to him satan's seed belongs to satan god's seed belongs to god so if we find god's seed then we take them but if it's satan's seed we leave them amen that's up to satan to take care of we have to know our position if you're a pastor you have a word position and you have boundaries to that position now the funny thing about positions is you have to have qualifications and then you also have limitations and then you have benefits within there so a pastor has to marry a certain type of woman he has to have children he has to have a family he has to act a certain way he has to have a certain reputation and he can't have certain vices they're not allowed in his life there are qualifications there are boundaries to that position but if he meets those qualifications and he has the call of god in his life he can step in there and he gets benefits from it right and the people benefit from him staying in his position now a pastor that runs around evangelizing what is he doing he's out of his position because a pastor is not an evangelist he's supposed to stay and guard and feed the sheep now you get an evangelist tries to be a pastor what's the problem he doesn't work very well either he needs to be out evangelizing and usually what it really is is he doesn't have the pure qualifications of a pastor he doesn't have that desire to stay home with the sheep he has a desire to run around he shouldn't be there and so everybody has a it causes difficulty in the church because of it because he's not really where he's supposed to be amen a husband and a father has qualifications that are required of him amen we think that because you can father a child that means you should be a father no that's not it at all by the scripture you're supposed to have qualifications as a father there's responsibilities that are given to you and you have to be willing to apply yourself to meet those responsibilities before you ever get married before you ever become a husband before you ever become a father amen so what you have authority over your own house but you have no authority over somebody else's house do you i have authority in my home but i can't go tell brother matt what to do in his house i can't tell his family how to dress i can't tell him where no why because that's outside of the boundaries of my husband-father relationship right but within there i have all sorts of authority right i can tell the family this is the church we're going to attend this is where we're going to live this is how i'm going to spend my time this is the way i'm going to make a living right but i don't have a right to beat my wife and children do i there are boundaries to that authority it doesn't give me full ability to do what go against the word i'm bound by the word in my conduct of how i run my family and how i run my marriage amen and our sisters therefore also have a position and there are qualifications for that position you are a woman and that puts you within certain boundaries but you have to earn certain rights and trust within that that part of true womanhood as we talked about before and the scripture places boundaries about our sisters so we want to talk about today what those boundaries are and then lord willing in the next service we'll talk about what the benefits are within there amen but if we can set the boundaries and we can work within those boundaries and guess what god can bless you because you're within his word now and when you're in his word position then god will give you everything that you have needed for that position amen a woman has authority in the scriptures and we'll get into that she has specific authorities she has certain rights she has certain responsibilities that god has not just called her to do but he has ordered her to do he's placed it in her wheelhouse to do it's her job to do these things and there's a wonderful blessing if we'll do that amen but just like everyone else she has limitations there's nobody in scripture has ultimate authority even a prophet doesn't have ultimate authority why because we are all subject to one thing and that is the word the word is the only thing that has and even the word is a limit to itself god bound himself to his own word god can't work outside of his word and that's a comfort to us because it means if we do what he tells us to do he won't do something different than what he promised to do amen our rest is in his constancy not in ours and then we're all playing by the same rule book that's the beauty of it we're all playing by the same rule book so if we read it the same way and the holy spirit will quicken it the same way then we're going to be in good shape aren't we now when we start talking about a woman's authority in the word we need to see where the word points her and then we see it want to see where the word sets up boundaries we want to see the qualifications that require authority and when then we want to see after it's all said and done the blessings and the goodness that come out of that so in titus 2 3 it says the age of women likewise that they be in behaviors becometh holiness not false accusers not given to much wine and teachers of good things so these are the qualifications of a woman that is supposed to teach right one is that she is aged but there's a bunch of things that come after that just because you're older doesn't mean that you get to teach because there's lots of older women that shouldn't be teaching anybody because their life was in shambles and they've never come under the authority of the word amen so it says what that they have to have a holy lifestyle it says not false accusers it means that they have to keep their mouth shut unless they have all the facts yes amen they can't be inclined to going overboard with alcohol now i don't think that's a problem in most churches but i want to point you back to something because you know what the great was drunk with her own fornications and you know what that wine is is that is her own ideas that she is what taking ahead of her headship and then she's sitting there and they're they're getting there by going against the word of god she's drunk on moving against the word of god that's what the great was right she was doing the things she wanted she was drunk on self-will and empowerment that's what we're talking about here amen so sisters you might be sitting there saying well i don't drink but do you drink of your own thoughts to the point where it puts you in rebellion against headship amen take it all away we can look at it naturally but we can look at it spiritually as well because the great was drunk all the time and it was drunk because she had no headshift she was drunk with her own power and her own self-will if we want to put it that way amen what you have to get out of your personal opinion and preferences and put it under word authority amen and then the last thing it says they have to be teachers of good things now you can be a teacher of bad things as well right so there's good things that you want to be teaching you don't want to be teaching bad habits you want don't want to be bringing rebellion you don't want to be bringing pain and offense to people you want to bring the good things of god to them amen now i want to stop here and say one thing and i have it here in my notes and it goes for men and women alike and that's that if you're a teacher you're going to be humble because a teacher will always teach by experience not just by theory and the thing is you will not teach without having made a mistake in your life and so often what you're teaching people is don't do what i did because there's a price to pay if you do what i did and then so you're often using your own mistakes of teaching not just what well everything's great and everything's good and i've never made a mistake in my life amen we don't teach because we've read the bible we teach because we've read the bible and found it to be true in our lives amen we want the word to be alive to us not just a theory and so humility is the key in teaching because it keeps you from being put on a pedestal either by your own self or by the people that are listening to you if all i did was get up here and point it to my good qualities the inclination could be to raise me up same thing with any other minister brother gerald or what not if all we did was got up here and talked about the good things god was doing in our life and never showed how god has humbled us how we've made mistakes how we've had to backtrack how we've had to realize that we were doing things of our own leadership and not holy ghost leadership then we'd have a lot of problems right but we've got to keep ourselves humble as we're doing that teaching amen the simple fact is if you're teaching and you feel you've never made a mistake you're either naive in thinking you haven't or you're ignorant because you don't even realize you have already amen we've got to be humble when they do that in verse 4 it says that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet chaste keepers at home good and obedient to their own husbands that the word of god be not blaspheme now we're talking about a woman's position and paul starts to go into now the characteristics that he's asking the older women to teach the younger women now remember if you have to be taught that means it doesn't come naturally just because you have the holy ghost doesn't mean that you have every character or characteristic that you have need of right because why we're being changed from glory to glory word upon word line upon line there's a life that's being built there's a character that's been perfected in our lives so he says this is something that is taught right some of it you have by nature and some of it you've got to overcome that's what character is is a victory if we remember amen so what so some of these are specific to just being a woman in her word position if you're in your position sisters you're going to have these characteristics and he starts with sober it means to restore one to her senses to moderate to control to curb to disciple and to hold one to her duty loving we know what loving means i don't think we need to go too much further into that but discreet means of a sound mind sane in one's senses curbing one's desires and impulses self-controlled and temperate meaning there's no wild swings in the way you act that there's a constancy in your attitude in your approach to things now chase means that your your exciting reverence meaning that your life causes people and yourself to be reverent not irreverent venerable sacred pure from carnality modest immaculate and clean keepers at home means to be caring for the house working at home the watcher or keeper of the house and taking care of household affairs good means of a good constitution or nature useful pleasant agreeable joyful happy excellent distinguished upright honorable obedient to subject oneself to obey to submit to one's control to yield to one's admonition or advice that's quite a list of qualifications i'd say most of those are just standard christian qualifications if we're honest that's not just for sisters us men ought to be you know have the majority of those as well but what there's a pointed emphasis here on where and how a woman should spend her time i think we've run into some issues today because what happens is the sisters say well the word doesn't tell me i can't do this but what they're ignoring is that the word does tell you what you should be doing so if you're spending your time doing something that god doesn't care to spend the time to tell you not to do rather than not spending your time on the things he tells you to do then there's a problem because you're majoring on a minor that isn't even important enough for him to mention while ignoring all the things that he told you to do in your life and you'll see here that he points time and time again to sisters stay in your home okay now that doesn't mean you have to but that's where he says that's where you should be focused amen and we'll get into that that is not the only limitation for a sister and i've got scripture after scripture to show you where a woman fits outside of the home as well but the main area the main thrust of where a woman should be spending her time is in the care and caretaking of the home that's where he points her to and as we talked about before where paul even goes as far as to say that a woman is saved in childbearing that that is what keeps her out of trouble and keeps her focused on the word of god there's a there's something that comes with that right so paul's saying here sisters focus on this when he's talking to titus he's saying focus on these things focus on developing these characteristics focus on learning focus on grow growing here and the rest will be added to you right if god wants to move you into something if god puts a gift in your life if god puts a different type of ministry into your life that's well but this is where your bread and butter is sisters because if your attitude is outside of this you're going to run into trouble no matter where you go no matter what you do you've still got to have the attitude whether you're married or unmarried you still have to have the same attitude the sisters are called to have the same approach the same atmosphere around them the same the same way of doing things amen because paul says if you do what i'm telling you to do he says it will keep you from blaspheming the word of god that's a serious thing he's saying if you get outside of that then you're going to have problems and it's going to bring a reproach that where blasphemy means you'll cause people to speak evil of or speak reproachfully to rail at to revile or to make defamatory comments about the word of god so you bring a reproach on the gospel of christ when you get outside of those characteristics so if you'll focus on them it'll keep you out of trouble if you say that's not for me i'm going to focus on something that god didn't say i couldn't do you're going to get into trouble every single time but if you have those attributes and characteristics you'll be a blessing and not a stumbling block because you'll be representing christ the word beautifully amen now that's old-fashioned that's old-fashioned what we're talking about here is old-fashioned and if anybody outside of this church you know in the world listen to this they'd say they'd say all sorts of things about me in particular and you for sitting there and listening to it amen but what if you want to have authority sisters you've got to know your word position if you want to have word authority you can have all sorts of authority in this world if you want it anything a man has is available to you but if you want a word blessing you've got to stay in your word position and it's that simple amen that's why i say it's old-fashioned because the word is old-fashioned right it changes not when he said it he kept it and he hasn't changed it ever since amen so we see what's happening is that we've got the same thing happening today where they're telling women you have authority go take it but they're doing it under a title of something else and what is that female empowerment right that's the bride authority for the word it for the world is what they call it female empowerment amen and he's telling her what that she has greater value greater impact greater autonomy greater happiness and greater fulfillment by stepping out of the word pattern that god gave right that's what they're saying is they're saying get out of the word of god they don't say the word of god because most of them don't even realize that's where this originated in the first place and they're saying do this and you'll be happier and you'll have a better life and you'll be more fulfilled in all these different things and i will say in response to that and i'll say it straight especially to our younger sisters if you're looking to break the traditional mold of what god has called a woman to be you're stepping onto antichrist territory right because you're stepping outside of the word boundaries right if he set a boundary you don't get to cross it no matter what and we'll get into that a little bit more amen but if you step outside of that now i'm not saying again that every woman has to get married and stay home and clean the house in these different things we'll see in the scriptures is in the next couple of services where god has clearly showed there are women that had other purposes that paul even commissioned women to do certain things and he he asked the churches to support him and those things and whatnot so there is a place outside of this but the characteristics of a sister never change and that and that is that she has to be under the authority of men's headship she has to no matter what single married it doesn't matter amen but i looked this up this is this thing on female empowerment and i went to the european institute of gender equality amen female empowerment they say is the process by which women gain control and power over their own lives and acquire the ability to make strategic choices now on the face of that that sounds great who doesn't want that right we ought to be able to decide our own things right and let me point you back to the scriptures sisters you do have a choice you have a choice to serve god or to serve the world and if you're going to serve the world then by all means go by female empowerment if you're going to serve god then go but by the way the word but a sister even within the word she has a choice and that choice is do i accept the headship of a husband or do i stay stingle and as soon as you say i'm going to get married i'll accept that proposal you bind yourself by the word to the headship of that man whether he's good whether he's bad whether he changes in your marriage it doesn't matter you're bound to that headship because by the word is what you're really binding to you're not binding to him you're binding to him because the word says that's what you're supposed to do but if you're single now you're bound in headship under what your father as long as you're under his roof as long as you're eating his food and these things you're under his head ship the scripture specifically says of a young woman under her father's roof if you want to leave and you want to pay your own rent and buy your own food you can do your own thing but now you're doing it in your name not your father's name and you have to be doubly careful of that because now you answer directly to god if you go out from under your father's headship and that is the most dangerous place for most women and most of what they do if they're smart is they stay close to their dads they say dad i i might be out from under your roof i might be out from under your direct headship i don't talk to you and see you every day but i'm going to let you be the one that helps guide me through or they'll get close to a pastor the problem is that's dangerous for the pastor and the woman because she's single so it caught you know causes some issues there so if they're smart and they look at what the word says they'll stay close to their father because he'll help guide her through those key decisions in her life right but being single doesn't mean you can do whatever you want means you what you can do whatever you want within the scriptural boundaries of a woman no matter what you're still bound by the word this european institute for gender equality said the key area of focus is women's empowerment has five components their sense of self-worth the right to have and to determine choices their right to have access to opportunities and resources their right to have power to control their own lives both within and outside the home and their ability this is key their ability to influence the direction of social change to create a more just social and economic order nationally and internationally now that's a lot of big words and what he's saying is he said that the final linchpin is that they have the power to change the way things are be done everywhere around the world that's that's the linchpin to all this is that they have as much influence as men do amen now i want to contrast that against what the prophet said would happen this is the end goal of this movement and they're going to succeed they're going to succeed to where women will run everything they practically are in many ways now but he says did you know this is in the message choosing of a bride do you know the fall came by women at the beginning the end is going to wind up the same way women coming into authority and ruling over men and so forth he says do you know the scripture says that in the exposition of the seven church ages in the laodicean church age he says the fifth vision had to do with the moral problem of our age centering mostly around women god showed me that women began to get out of their place with the granting of the vote then they cut off their hair which signified they were no longer under the authority of a man but insisted on either equal rights that's great or in most cases more than equal rights this is a prophet speaking from from visions that he had 80 years ago okay and where are we at today he says she adopted men's clothing and went into a state of undressed until the last picture i saw was a woman naked except for a little fig leaf type apron and with this vision i saw the terrible perversion and moral plight of the whole world so the rallying cry for women's empowerment is what rise up cast off your change claim your rights you're as good as men are or better right listen we're all in a fallen condition there's no one better the men are not better than the women the women are not better than the men right but we do have a position that god tells us to stay in and that's the only reason we are where we are the only reason mannerism are in in authority in a scriptural principle is because god put us there not because we're better not because we're worse not because we're more capable or less capable he put us there and that's just the simple answer amen we're no better we're no worse it's just the way god put it and that's what we fall back on amen the simple fact is no matter what you choose to live your life by you're going to have boundaries right you're going to have boundaries you're going to create your own moral code if you're going to live outside the word but you're still going to have boundaries there's things you won't do and there's things you will do and there's things you'll agree with and things that you won't agree with amen but the thing is what saudi society is pushing us towards with no boundaries is what they say is what they really mean is let's put up boundaries to hold back the things we don't like and let's knock down the boundaries to get more of what we think would be better there's still boundaries there but what they're doing is now they're saying we're going to limit one side of the equation and we're going to open it up for the other one to try and bring balance into the world right what they're really doing is they're determining what's good and what's bad for society the word has no place in it good is bad bad is good now black is white white is black that's where we're at today amen all we can see is them determining with their oh i don't know where they get it from but they're determining what's right and it has nothing to do with what god has ever said amen what they're trying to do catch this because they're trying to bring back a position of equality listen we're all equal in christ there's no male or female jew nor greek right bond or free amen it doesn't matter in christ but we each have a position but what they're trying to do is bring us back to equality when is the only time that we saw true equality eden what are they trying to do they're trying to bring us back to an eating condition without paying the price that had to be paid for eden they're trying to do it outside of the cross that where christ paid the price at calvary right they're trying to bring us back to eden without recognizing that the very thing they're doing is what brought us out of eden in the first place they're giving power to the woman brother branham said this he says now a dominating female is the greatest curse in the world the wisest man the world could ever the world ever saw was solomon and he said and he reads the scriptures out of ecclesiastes it says i applied my heart to know and to search and to seek out wisdom and the reason of things and to know the wickedness of folly even the foolishness and madness he was trying to find out why are things the way they are why are things as bad as they are this is solomon speaking he says and i find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets and her hands as bands who so pleases god shall escape from her but the sinner shall be taken by her behold this have i found saith the preacher count them one by one to find out the account which yet my soul seeketh but i find not so he's looking for a good person he says one man amongst the thousand have i found one in a thousand for men he says but a woman amongst all those have i not found i sometimes wonder if solomon hadn't got his heart broken when he wrote this you know but he says look it's tough to find a good man he says it's even tougher to find a good woman that's an amazing thing i looked up what that verse 26 says in the amplified bible and it says and i found that of all sinful follies none has been so ruinous and seducing one away from god as idolatrous women more bitter than death is the woman whose heart is snares and nets and whose hands are bands whoever pleases god shall escape from her but the sinner shall be taken by her and what do we see today sinners being taken over and over and over again and happy to do it happy to be there brother bradham continues he says paul said i suffer not a woman to us to teach or usurp authority but from the garden of eden onward man woman has constantly and successfully tried to take control over the man and right today it is a woman's world with the goddess of america being a naked female as the female idol falling out of the skies remember her arms were iron bars characterized the first ephesian age so her power has grown until she has gained absolute authority such authority being usurped by her iron disposition right they won't back off they won't back down they will not be under authority they'll go their own way remember what brother brahm said when he continues in that quote he says an iron disposition is what never of the holy spirit right it can't be so the system they're proposing through female empowerment can't work it won't work the bible tells us it won't right it can't do it that's what happened in the ephesian age and it carried all the way through and we see it now as the great horse sitting on the thrones with many kings and these ones with her it doesn't work and in the end what happens destruction total destruction it brings everything down amen nothing will hold it up why we see today even in the age of laodicea people's rights you think with people's rights everybody would have rights but it's not it's only a select group of people that have rights and they'll trample everybody's else to get there amen what is it somebody then other than god thinks that it's the right thing to do and it just leads us to more problems brother braham says this in in the message oh it's a long one i don't even have it on two pages he says let us go back to the beginning he's setting a contrast here he says in the original physical creation as we know it today god made everything in pairs male and female there were two chickens a rooster and a hen there was two cattle the cow and the bull and right down the line but when it come to man there was only one they were not a pair adam had been made in the image of god and he was a son of god and as a son of god he could not be tempted and fall that would be impossible satan had no access he had access to adam but adam gave him no access if i could put it that way adam had no desire to to talk it over with the serpent right and he says he could not cause adam to fall so god took a byproduct of a man to cause the fall the woman never stepped fresh from the hand of god as a true product of god she was produced from man and when god caused her to be brought forth from men she was vastly different from the other females he had created she was able to be seduced no other female in creation can be immoral but the human female may be touched at almost any time and that weakness in her allowed satan to seduce her by way of the serpent and has brought the woman to a very peculiar position before god in his word so brother bram sets up this big contrast here because he says the animals are all made one way but he says when it came to humanity a woman is made different than every other creature in the world and he says it brings her to a peculiar place now watch how he pulls this out now because he's giving us a big picture he says she is the type of all things vulgar foul and loathes them on one hand and nobody said amen but listen he says and on the other hand she is the type of all things clean beautiful and holy as the receptacle of the spirit and blessings of god so you can be death and you can be life sisters on the other hand she is called the who is drunk with the wine of her fornications and other on the other she is called the bride of christ on one hand she is called mystery babylon the abomination before god and on the other hand she is called new jerusalem our mother on one hand she is so foul and wicked and lewd that she is summarily cast into the lake of fire as the only fit place for her and on the other hand she is exalted to heaven sharing the very throne of god as the only place befitting such a queen i ask you today what are you choosing are you going to choose to go satan's where are you going to choose god's way because one is foul and loathsome and lewd and the other one sits at the right hand of power as befitting a queen amen the beautiful things that i underlined here all the good things you can't see it on the screen but what it's the only thing that takes you to god's end goal is by submitting to the word that he's given to us amen you don't get there by stepping outside of the boundaries you have to stay within the boundaries to get the reward of that position you've got to stay in your position is what we're talking about amen so what does that mean it means you're going to face times of disappointment you're going to face times of pain discomfort hurts suffering even neglect why because you're under failed headship in men and so you're going to have to deal with that failure while staying in your position and that's the test of your character and faith that's what it is for a sister is to stay there when it's not going so good isn't it hey why imperfect men are in the place of perfect headship it doesn't work but yet we have to stay there as men we have to leave and as women we have to submit right so the question i'd ask the sisters is do you think you could do any better everybody would say yes often yes we can do better but the simple fact is as men are not doing great or poorly because they're great we're in a fallen condition right and a woman's in a fallen condition so whether we have a man leading or a woman leading we're in a fallen condition ain't nobody going to do better right because why in the end without a new birth we're all going to fall back on selfishness and we're all going to look to ourselves and that's what causes destruction is when we do only what is good for ourselves we forget the golden rule isn't it right so a woman if we gave everything over if we men just stood up and said you know what women take it we're going to reverse roles today the world would not go to into some utopia why because women are as fallen as men are it's never going to change what needs to change is what a new heaven and a new earth right we got to change the whole thing and we got to come back with character this time and that's the great reset that we're really talking about isn't it it's not changing our emissions and it's not going to electric vehicles and cutting out coal power it's what the power of the holy spirit burning us out so that we've got character to rule and reign with him and then we all need the new birth and the only way that a man's going to lead properly is if he has the new birth right he'll still make mistakes but he'll do a whole lot better won't he and he'll humble himself to the word and he'll apologize when he fails and falls to the ones that he's supposed to be leading and what he'll point back to the word every time amen amen the path of god's leadership is not easy but it has proven results amen we've seen it we've seen it with those that are around us we've seen it in our our grandparents and our parents and those that have gone by way of the grave already we've seen it in the scriptures amen but if we look at satan's path it's much easier isn't it because you get to do whatever you want as long as you don't do the word you're in satan's path right and it's much easier brother braham says this he says in this thyatarana church shade she is a dominating female she's mystery babylon she's the great she's jezebel a false prophetess why because the true female is submissive to god christ is her head she has no word but his no thoughts but his no leadership but his but what about this church she has cast out the word destroyed the bibles and worthy essays of the godly she has slain those who have preached the truth she has taken over kings and princes and nations she controls armies and insists that she's the true body of christ and her popes are the vicars of christ she is entirely seduced by the devil until she in turn has become the seducer of others she is the bride of satan and has produced his bastard child religions he's talking about the catholic church there right so go tell the world that's where they're headed and they'll laugh at you they'll say no no no we're just bringing back balance we're not bringing back balance every time you'll see it no matter what in churches and companies and whatever when they try and fix things what happens is they're on this side and they swing way past the middle and they go bounce off the rev limiter on the other side and then they come back in and they just do this they just go back and forth overcompensating over reaching their goal every single time and it's just problem after problem after problem it's the way humanity is right there's no eden to be had by bringing equality the way they want to it's not going to happen right but what are those boundaries and why does god put boundaries in why does god put boundaries is it to protect god god puts boundaries in to protect us right god puts boundaries in there to make it easy in the body if we have defined roles and positions and places and authorities that makes the body work really really well because it means that i don't have to step on your toes and you don't have to step on mine to do our jobs and he did the same thing for men and women he put them in these nice little beautiful boxes and there is a little bit of crossover of grace right but generally there's two defined boxes and that's so that the two of them together work really really well but if each of them doesn't know who's supposed to do what then you get into problems because sometimes we'll fall back on capability rather than what the word tells us that's when we get into problems so often right what does it do when god puts us in positions it cuts us down on confusion it keeps it out of the body keeps it out of the marriage it allows you to play within your own sandbox first timothy 2 says this these we're talking about some boundaries now let the woman learn in silence with all subjection you can stay silent but if you're not in subjection you're still in trouble aren't you he says i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence for adam was first form then eve now that doesn't mean anything in and of itself but listen to the next verse in verse 14 he says for adam was not deceived that's where brother branham says satan couldn't fool adam because adam wasn't deceived that's how you know adam couldn't be fooled because he wasn't fooled that's the proof right that's right adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression that's where the sin was because she was deceived notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety and i want you to catch here because he sets up two boundaries here and often those are misunderstood about why they're there and what they look like the first thing he says is a woman can't teach the men that's the first boundary he sets up now does that mean a man can't learn anything from a woman absolutely not right does that mean a woman can't tell a man something that he doesn't know no does that mean that a woman can a woman remind a man of something he ought to know of course right this isn't about conversations that happen about day to day this isn't about fellowship but this is intentionally looking to sit men down and straighten them out right that's what we're talking about here right it doesn't have to be formal it can absolutely be informal and if you sit down with the intention of correcting men brothers are unbelievers it doesn't matter by the word of god then it's forbidden to the sisters to do that that's what he's saying is the woman does not handle the word to try and correct authority why because the man doesn't answer to the woman he answers to god so that correction comes through god again not saying he can't use a woman but she's got to be very careful how she's going to do it that word teach this is where the misunderstanding often is is they think well that means you can't preach he didn't say preach he said teach right they say well you can't get behind the pulpit but i can go do it someplace else no he says i suffer a woman not to teach period right it means to be a teacher to hold discourse with others in order to instruct them so if you're sitting down and having a conversation with the intent of teaching of instructing somebody then you're going to be off the word unless you've been given authority to do it and we'll get to where that is in a second to deliver moral instruction to tell people they're doing things right or wrong is not for a woman to sit down and do to conduct oneself as a teacher you say well i'm not formally a teacher it doesn't matter if you're acting in the capacity of a teacher in any way and you haven't been given the authority to do it you are off the word of god sisters to impart instruction to instill doctrine into one to explain or espound a thing or to teach one something from the scriptures so again there is a place where women are allowed to do that but he says when it comes to men you're not allowed to do it you are not allowed to address or instruct the men in anything formally or informally that's a very tight boundary isn't it that's a strong boundary sisters i noticed there that it said to conduct oneself as a teacher because that was a big that really jumped out to me these days because of social media because what we have here is a sister would never presume to do that in person but if you put her on social media all of a sudden she'll sit there and she'll start to do what spread doctrine teach to give moral instruction say what she thinks is right say what she she thinks is wrong and she's doing exactly what paul told her not to do he says you're to stay in silence on these things right and they'll say well i'm not doing it to men i'm just putting it on social media but if you can't control your audience then you're speaking to men right if you have men in your social media feeds you're speaking to men so you you are instructing men whether you agree to it or not if they can see it then you're instructing them and you're not supposed to be doing those things if your intention is to teach or deliver moral obstruction or expound on the word of god you are forbidden to do it if man can will or could see it that's the requirement for her sister she is not to give that type of instruction at any time unless she's given authority to do it by a man specifically right and if you're going to do it only to women which is where you are instructed to do it as we read earlier you are what it is given to the aged women with a proven life and life experience of living and experiencing the word of god in their personal lives that's who does it amen so there's a boundary for a woman to teach and it's given to ones that have the experience to do it now remember the reason i brought up social media is the first time i saw this happen was by a very well-known message minister's wife and she got online and she wrote up a post about something and my wife shared it with me and i said this ain't gonna be good and you know what happened is a bunch of women flocked to her and they started getting all riled up and so she riled up all of these women and then finally what happened is somebody let her husband the minister know what was going on and that post disappeared like that and she has never done it since because why she gotta be in her bonnet she got on there to give her deliver moral instruction to her social media followers and she started doing something that she wasn't supposed to do and it was a rebuke to her it was a rebuke to her husband's ministry and it was a rebuke to the church that she was representing as well she got out of her place now did she do it with good intent absolutely right maybe she was uh frustrated with something that happened maybe she there was an injustice there that she felt needed to be corrected but she took it on herself to do it rather than taking it to her husband her head and letting him deal with the situation she went straight to social media and what she do she put a mark on her testimony because she stepped out of her word position amen what is it she was speaking to an uncontrolled audience taking the corrective role of a teacher and giving moral instruction by the word of god and she's forbidden to do it in the scriptures that's the greatest danger to our sisters right now is social media because you can preach on there as if you're in a pulpit you have a bigger audience than i have i sit here and i preach to 30 people you can go online and you can have six seven hundred eight hundred a thousand fifteen thousand whatever it is that are following you and you can sit there and preach to every one of them and you're off the word of god every single time you do it and it's a dangerous thing sisters she may have had great motives and i'd like to think she did but good motives don't allow you to cross the word boundary and that's what i find so often is we have great motives we have great reasons for doing it but if you don't follow the word you're still wrong listen to what brother branham says he says there she stands there she is that's her she preaches the word handles the word becomes a goddess and is the cause of every sin the bible said i suffer not a woman to teach or usurp any authority but be in obedience is also saith the law see she can't do it but they make her a ruler of the land a mayor or governor soon shall be president sure there you are that's the way it goes see and the people do that because they don't care about this word they'll never see it so that's all speaking to you know the world in general but then he brings it into the ranks of christianity and the message choosing of a bride and he says she eve persuaded him adam out of the will of god and caused him to do something that he should not have done and by it caused death to the whole human race that's why the bible forbids her to teach or to preach or to handle god's word in any manner okay so everything i've said forget i said it and here's the prophet saying right if you believe malachi 4 it says simple he points us back to the scripture and he says it so you don't have to say that's just brother john talking that's brother branham talking that's a malachi 4 the prophet of the age saying it he says i know sisters many of you say the lord called me to preach listen to this i'm not going to argue with you but i'm going to tell you the word says you're not to do it she shall not teach or usurp any authority but to be in silence right the lord called me to preach he says well you say the lord told me to do it listen to this he says i don't doubt that one bit did you hear my message the other night about balaam i think this was a trap wasn't it he says balaam got the first straight cut decision out of god don't do it but he kept on fooling around until finally god told him to do it so you don't have god's will you have god's permission that is not what he's talking about amen god might permit you to preach i don't say he didn't but it's not according to his original word and plan for she is to be under obedience is also say at the law it's true therefore she's not supposed to do it the hallmark of a true ministry is not to be identified as a balaam ministry if i can put it that way if you've got to go the balaam route to be in your ministry you're off the word and what happened to balaam after he went in his own way brought him to his death didn't it right he couldn't even achieve what he wanted to he did it out of selfish desire he wanted the rank he wanted the money he wanted the recognition he was a true prophet he had a real prophetic gift but he wasn't supposed to use it of his own way and he pushed and he pushed until god said go ahead and do it and then what did he do he went he couldn't even deliver the message he wanted to and then he was killed in doing so right balaam lost his life because he insisted on it he got god's permission but he didn't have god's will and he definitely didn't have god's blessing and it led to his destruction not to his benefit all it did was benefit the ones he was trying to knock down actually amen balaam died fulfilling his call to minister not god's call to minister if we could put it that way right god didn't tell balaam to do it god gave him permission to do it and that's a big difference i don't want to go to god for permission i want to go to god for leadership direction and guidance amen that he would tell me what to do not that i would tell him what i want to do amen now paul ties together that idea of teaching with usurping authority and that's where we get some clarity on the matter because you can't take authority to teach but you can be given authority to teach sisters amen you can't presume or assume or take that position or authority over men informally or formally you have to be given it that word usurp means one who acts on their own authority to govern an absolute master to govern exercise dominion over one to unilaterally take up arms meaning you decide to do it without any consultation i.e you're acting as an autocrat somebody that has no headship literally you are self-appointed acting without submission or headship so you can't take authority to give moral instruction or handle the word of god but you can be given it amen and who do we have teaching our young people youngest people in sunday school is it a brother or a sister is it a man or a woman it's a sister isn't it sister kim so why does sister kim get to do it and nobody else get to do it because sister kim has been given authority by the pastor by the sunday school superintendent and by her own husband to sit there and teach those youngest of children in the word of god right but you'll notice that as soon as we start getting deeper into doctrine into instructive truths of the word who do we have doing it we put it into the hands of a man right out of respect for the age that they're coming into they receive instruction from a man not from a woman our sisters are sitting at home and they're teaching our children all day long aren't they they are given authority to raise the children in the fear and admonition of the lord that's a word authority that's given to him not just your husband would give that your husband can't deny you that that authority to teach your children the word gives you that authority you're supposed to do that you're supposed to keep the word of god in your mouth day in and night you're supposed to be teaching them and telling them the stories and and raising them up in these different things so you have authority but it's given to you either by the word or by the headship that is there in the first place but you can't presume to take it amen like brother brown says it all goes back to eve she mishandled the word and that's why the woman's not allowed to take it anymore unless she's given authority to do it amen right now let me say this i can absolutely allow a woman to teach me i've had many fine women old and young tell me things that i needed to know share things with me encourage me correct me in those different things i don't think any man that's worth assault is going to sit there and say a woman can't teach me anything you have to be an idiot to think that amen if a woman's got the holy ghost then absolutely god can use her mouth if he can use balaam's donkey and he can use my mouth he can use a woman's mouth amen there's no reason he can't but you got to be humble to recognize that amen we all need to be humble scripture says we're supposed to be humble one to another to submit and subject ourselves one to another so if sister maureen or sister brenda or sister betty came up to me and said brother john i'd like to share something with you i guarantee you i'd sit and listen to it amen why because they've earned that respect for me to say absolutely sister share with me what's on your heart i wouldn't turn her down right but the other thing is is she wouldn't do it without having to talk to her husband first i guarantee you that if there was a real issue there and chances are he'd come and talk to me not her but sometimes she'll just have it's in conversation she'll shut you know one of them will say something i'm i've got to be able to receive that amen we're believers we have the holy ghost we are part and members of the bride of christ we ought to be able to accept that but to sit down and formally instruct she's not allowed to do it or informally instruct if her intent is to do that then she's got to be very careful because it has to be given her she can't take it amen remember usurping is when you take permission when you take something without permission and that's where you what presume and brother bram says to presume is to venture without authority first corinthians 14 is the scripture he's been referring to and he says let your women keep silence in the churches for it has not permitted them to speak but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law and it's like we said before it's not just okay to be quiet but you have to be in subjection and obedience in your quietness if rebellion is stirring in your heart while you're sitting there in silence you're not doing a very good job are you you've got to be in subjection to headship when you're doing these things and if they will learn anything let them ask their husbands at home their fathers if they're single for it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church that's why we don't allow a woman to minister in the church is that it's expressly forbidden she can sing she can testify she can speak in tongues she can express the gifts of the spirit but she's not allowed up here to handle the word of god it's forbidden her in the scriptures amen they're not to leave but they're to obey they're to be in obedience as paul said when it comes to the operations of the church and the positions within it she can't hold any of those things they're not to preach they're not to teach formally or informally and they're not to try and tell the men what to do in those positions either brother bram says this and we're closing he says and he made her for man and not man for her did you know that the woman was made for men and not the man for the woman the bible teaches that all right she was given a place in man before the fall equal over all creation that's where she started equal no one greater no one lesser fully equal but after the fall now here we bring the subject up but after the fall he was her ruler she must keep uh silent in all matters now after the original beginning is over that's an interesting phrase he says the original beginning is over you had an original beginning where all were equal in the eyes of god right he says that original beginning is gone now but guess what there's a new beginning coming isn't there we've got a new heaven and we've got a new earth where we come back and rule and reign with him and that's where the that's where the equality is going to come back but until then we're stuck in this broken system where you have fallen men and fallen women just trying to make it worth by work by one thing and one thing alone and that is the new birth the baptism of the holy ghost in each one of you it's the only way to make it work amen amen we'll stand if we will amen i'm looking forward to a new beginning and i'm looking forward to a place where it's christ above all amen he's got to be above all right now but i'm looking to a place where he takes it all amen we're just sitting and we're resting and we're relaxing in his presence where we don't have to rely on ourselves where we don't have to look at our own failures where we don't have to see where we we mess things up but where we can just look at him where he is the light he is the ever-present one he is the ever gracious one he's the one that's made it all possible and we're literally just able to sit there and rest in his presence amen it'll be a wonderful place i do believe let's bow our heads together heavenly father lord some strong words
