amen true through the fire all through the life yeah thank you Jesus [Music] amen praise the Lord God blesses amen the grace of God amen to us all the grace of God to again the sink and the gentleman Terry that brother Bob was mentioning and I understand he's in just in his 50s around there and we pray the grace of God to him for the salvation of his soul God knows a man maybe he's not conscious of much when it comes to we don't know when it comes to the natural but again God is conscious of him and goddess conscious of his heart amen maybe to the to the to the family or friends that he's he's out of it and he's not aware of them a man and really there's nothing that they can this point to but as far as God is concerned there's life there a man so we pray the grace of God to Terry a man and again I don't know what is the will of God why did God allow it why did God permit it a man so and I understand he's not he's not married he doesn't have a family I don't think so what but again there's somebody that that he's that he I'm sure he's aware of or that they're aware of him and friends but again we pray that he's between time and eternity that's right he's between he's between death and life so we pray the grace of God some other God will see something in his soul a man that pleases the Lord some there's kind of like good again the Prophet said we trust that he's there that the Prophet says you're going to be surprised who made it who didn't make it and that's the truth and I'm referring to the bride but those those mainly those outside the city so maybe he'll be there we don't know well as the Bride of Christ we are pleading the token life of the blood a man for Terry we're pleading the grace of God brother is grace for me it's grace for him grace for you grace for him a man so I pray the grace of God to him and to family and friends to God be the glory and brother there's a lot going on and there's a lot more going going to take place because it's going to get worse and worse and worse the closer we get to eternity the closer we get to the end the closer we get to the resurrection and the rapture a man and there were some quotes that I was going to share with you concerning the rapture tonight but we'll leave that for another service and tonight and I I was going to minister on another subject but I decided when I got here that we maybe will listen to a tape by the prophet it'll be just over an hour but there were things that I want to share with you concerning grace they met so that we would understand grace and have a greater honor with a revelation of grace and the extent of grace but again there's there's things that I did I discovered when I was just checking some quotes with a prophet I said Oh grace I I never thought about that never thought in those terms I said Lord so we'll share that with you too maybe next Wednesday we'll see as Lord leads us amen grace I said Lord we most don't understand that that thought of grace or that revelation of grace either to us I said the most that we know about grace is Ephesians 2:8 by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God so we thank God for grace for the salvation of our souls we thank God for grace and a redeemed redemption of our of our bodies and so on but grace it goes beyond that oh yeah oh yes there's an alpha and there's an Omega it's amazing that the first revelation of grace is is in Genesis Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord and you go right on through the last the last revelation of grace it's revelation 20:2 the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all amen a man begins with grace it ends with grace and and knowing that the book of Revelation itself begins with grace and ends with grace amen oh yes it's tremendous see without grace we're not going to make it without grace no no and not just from time to eternity but we need grace to make it through this life that's the truth it is my grace I'm sane but it's my grace that I go one step at a time it's grace that takes me a day at a time the grace it takes you a day at a time how do I get through this day grace a man and it's grace that's enabling us and with us to get us through the the issues regarding the selling of our home because as I said that we thought it was sold but all that was cancelled so we're committing it to the Lord again and asking for grace and for the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen so keep it in prayer by the grace of God amen so it's it's it's a difficult time for myself as too many to deal with these issues and we pray the grace of God to provide what is will is a man also to remember in prayer again we were there last night to visit them they invited us out for supper and that was sister Goulding's daughter Joyce and her husband Cecil they invited us out to I think his opera gullies and to share supper with them and they did express that they would like to have more fellowship with us and so on so if my self sister Betty of course and my older brother Melvin and his wife and of course Ivan and his wife so it was we had a wonderful time of fellowship a man and it's not just natural things there were times when the Lord allowed spiritual to come into it and so we thank the Lord for that amen to God be the glory amen so god bless Joyce and Cecil they are professing Christians and they do ordinarily and understand attend the Salvation Army somewhere out in this in CVS area so we and I did here the the path the clergy the the officer that preached there I did here in one time not long ago I was had a brother's house and and he put on he put it put on the Salvation Army's service and this officer does the same Church they go to and this officer preached and I mentioned it after I've told he told you about it and he preached on the subject of being thankful and he said not just for this that but for all he said even some of the things that we we looked out we think is his heart and so on it's discouraged disappointing he's to be thankful he said because God has ordained it for a reason God has allowed it for a reason so he said be thankful not just for the good and not just for this not just for that I prefer everything he said the bible encourages us to do that and he of course he was given scripture a man so i pray the lord bless that officer he was it was the word he was into the word he wasn't denying it a man so to God be the glory and that it that is their their clergy so God's good God blessed them aim at and again he might be one of that's gonna be there outside the city as well we know it's not the bride but again and I've been preaching that for years you know I like I said I started that my sermon was rebuking this believers because they had a wrong attitude and they had a wrong spirit towards those people they did and my first sermon was to rebuke them and say don't do that any because as I said if you love them which love you what reward have you you know and so on do not even the publicans the same and the believers think oh we just live gotta love believers no no you got to love everybody any man show the law by the grace of God so I said don't don't you put your fingers down there or your nosed out I said on those out there because they're in that church there in that church as I says grace for you is grace for them because there goes you but for the grace of God a man so the the grace have brought you out there's grace to bring them a man so I pray greatest Elpis mother keep a right attitude and a right spirit amen because Italy Italy take you in or put you out a man so thank God Jesus kept the right attitude and a right spirit prays and also to keep our brother John condition prayer understand that he's been in contact now with our brother Neville I understand that he passes the church maybe in Washington United States but he also ministers in the church in Ottawa so our brother John is hoping to be able to get to the church somewhere in Ottawa and and to fellowship and here our brother Neville preached you understand if you remember he preached there too for us and God bless brother Neville and also to remember in prayer our brother John Dan quoi I got an email from him today I understand that easy in Ghana he does have the church in Ontario I believe that's where our brother makandal goes to and right now brother Dan cause in Ghana and he is there for a funeral service and it was surprising that not for one person but for two and it's for a ministering brother understand and his wife and I I don't understand how that they both went at the same time so he said he was there for the funeral of the brother and his wife so I prayed the grace of God to brother Dan call in Ghana amen and there's another brother at all so that's emailed me concerning some needs that he had and he's requesting prayer and it's her brother Samuel and that's the English version what the other version is I don't know and where he lives on not sure exactly brother Samuel and so he's requesting prayer for his needs God's grace to him amen so there's there's many needs so I pray the grace of God were sensitive to it man turn with me just before we turn to brother branham turn with me to Ezekiel chapter 22 God's grace our sister Kimberly is she home oh she's out there god bless her and brother Joshua it was his working he's home okay our brother Weiser will be hadn't gone for at least another couple of weeks of grace to him and he's also looking for a church in Ottawa or in the area nor Mississauga and I did provide him with the name and address of a church and the phone number so god bless brother vital in Ezekiel chapter 22 and beginning to read at verse 23 and the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man say unto her thou art the land that is not cleansed nor rained upon in the day of indignation there is a conspiracy of our prophets in the midst thereof like a roaring lion ravening the prey they have devoured souls they have taken the treasure and precious things they have made or many widows in the midst thereof this is the reef response the results of the ministry of the prophets to Israel brother we're going to witness a lot of the same things in these last days around the message because it said it says there is a conspiracy of our prophets in the midst thereof like a roaring lion ravening the prey they have devoured souls and there's many a ministry that's devouring souls not really feeding souls they're feeding on souls a man so we pray the grace of God to us to give us wisdom and revel nation and understanding a man take heed what you hear and it's just devoured Souls and they have taken the treasure and precious things and they have made her many widows in the midst thereof over an hour for desperation it was an hour then and if an hour an hour for desperation it's an hour now a man and her priests have violated my law and have propane my holy things they have put no difference between the holy and the profane they mad but there is a difference between right and wrong between that which pleases God and that was don't please God and it says neither have they show difference between the clay unclean and the clean because why because they're there to get the favor of the people but brother God is here to put it through the Ministry to correct the people a man to get the line up with a word by the grace of God but again most don't want that kind of a rebel ministry they wanted ministry that's Genesis teach on Revelation revelation yeah you know they had this doctrine this time this I just understanding that understanding no brother once we get into it God wants us to line up with the word when we get into the word when we get into the message God wants us to God wants us to die to ourselves so that the message can live in us amen so it's not you the lives it's the message it's the word living in you but Ezekiel was discovering the promise to priesthood just never had the right anointing and it says again her priests have violated my law a profane might only things they have put no difference between the holy and profane and neither had they show difference between the unclean and the clean and have heed their eyes from my Sabbath's and I am profaned among them amazing or princess in the midst thereof are like wolves revenue prey he said to shed blood and to destroy souls to get dishonest gain this is amazing from the profits to the priesthood to the leaders it says to shed blood to destroy souls and to get dishonest gain that's the world we're living in and her prophets have dubbed them with on tempered mortar seeing vanity and divining lies unto them saying thus saith the Lord God when the Lord hath not spoken make sure it's God speaking through the ministry they met sometimes you can you can think that it's God's or that brother gone through that brother when it's not might be the devil a man could be a false anointing so he said when the Lord has not spoken they're saying the Lord said but he didn't forceful but he didn't the people of the land have used oppression and exercised robbery and have mixed the poor and needy yay they oppress the stranger wrongfully amazing wrongfully never had the right attitude and the right spirit and I sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that I should not destroy it but I found none and is coming down to that place where he said if he didn't shorten time to be no flesh saved but for the elects sake thank God therefore he said have I poured out mine indignation upon them and I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath their own way am i recompense upon their heads saith the Lord God a man what a place what a position that Israel came to a man and what a position and a place that the Gentile churches and even among that it's not just out there it's even around the message oh yeah I witnessed that over the years and I've seen it come over the years little by little by little a man you'll find a lot of people not living for the Lord they're not living for the for the gospel they're not living for the resurrection that I live in for the rapture no no we're just living for themselves or they're living for family they're caught up with this to kind of with that but to not caught up with the Lord do not cut out with the word they're not caught up with the body of Christ no no no oh yeah I see it more and more of that now because why because they're getting away from the spiritual getting into a religious spirit and if you got a religious spirit you're going to focus on just natural things I'd like to do this and I'd like to do that well the bride likes to get out of here a man she got a spiritual a man she's spiritual but a lot of believers today are just religious and they're concentrating on natural life natural things that's the devil oh oh no well God is love yeah easily love all right prophet of God brought of that how that people knew they blow that out of proportion about God bought know he's God being good God is good god is good or he is good probably saying he's good all right he said but he said he's also a God of judgment and he said he got to come to judge you for this judging for that Oh is he good people think he's good this is what the problems were I lighting did people think God is good so god they he won't judge them for this he won't judge him for that brother he's gonna judge her for what he's revealed the word he's given you god help us brother please must be on our toes so that were not left out Anthony really members how many are really on the earth today that are bright material there's not many and they're getting less and less and less you know so the grace of God brother just consider the scripture we just read the position that Israel came to the position now that the church has come to amen God promised her stories real again he said I'm forever married to backs lady in Israel a man my brother when it come to the church no he was shorten time only for the elect and for the rest his judgment God's grace to us is my prayer so we're going to hear the prophet of God Minister on the subject of desperation amen and afters anything that the revelation of the word and prophecy in this hour produces in the bright it is desperation amen and are you desperate for the resurrection are you desperate for them considering what's going on and what's happening are you desperate to make it by the grace of God and God a respond to that desperation that's grace amen oh yeah no no I don't have to get desperate this grace oh yes you do God come down through Grace or two to those different disparate souls that's grace amen not because of yours the stairs I believe Lord in your head no no gods believe it in your heart and if you got it in your heart you're desperate amen you're desperate for the law Taylor Luther was desperate for justification Wesley was desperate desperate for sanctification the Pentecostals were desperate for the baptism of the Holy Ghost morning noon and night Oh were they desperate a male by the grace of God and God responded by grace he responded to that desperation and God it can respond to the blood desperation for the resurrection and the rapture God's grace to us as I rather Matthew brings the Prophet to minister to us amen God blesses and also he preached desperation p.m. amazing he preached the message he preached in the morning the token the token message and he says I'll give you the boat he says he said this message is the highlight of the entire ministry it's the highlight of his entire his ministry and the message of the hour what the token amen it's it's so now let's be desperate for the token amen god bless you and now we're going to read from Jeremiah the 29th chapter the 10th first what us saith the Lord that after seventy years be accomplished at babban I will visit you and perform my good word towards you in causing you to turn to this place for I know the thoughts that I think toward you is this we saith the Lord though thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you accepted in then shall you fall upon me and ye shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your heart and I will be bounded you saith the Lord and I will turn away your captive and I will gather you from all nations and from all the places where I have drove you saith the Lord and will bring you again anton unto the place which i calls you to be carried away captive back to pinnacles i put that in myself it doesn't say that's what I was meeting to nature Luke 16 again 15 first our 61st the law and the prophets were until child since that time the kingdom of God is preached and presses into every man presses into it not just simply walks into it easy but it's got to be pressed into thing now when you seek me with all your heart then I'll be found and you promised that he would return and bring the people from scattered all the earth actually was seven years back into Jerusalem more than that from and he did it just that way that's right now we're going to talk on on desperations for a few minutes now usually it takes a state of emergency to throw us into desperation it's too bad it has to do this but human bees are so slothful in their lives their tastes an emergency something arises and when they do then it throws them into that desperation and really in doing that in desperation it brings out that real thing that you are it shows what you're made out of in the time of desperation it usually pulls out all the good things that's in the time of death other people when they know what they were dying the things that they kept secret all the right things the desperation they were trying to confess it see that time I take this and make it right go please go dude see and desperation y'all have done that before he they not wait till the time of emergency would you do so and so for me the emergency calls his desperation when we ought to do it without the emergency now we know it's tonight that we're taking symbols of the Passover and the Passover was taking in emergency in times of desperation you know in Exodus the trial chapter and the eleventh first of the truck chapter I believe it is it says eat this passover with the shoes on your feet with your loins Girt it up and with the staff in your hand see you're eating and desperation they had seen the great hand of God then I saw all these miracles the sign of their token and while they were under the sign of the tokens they'd taken their communion in desperation for they knew at that time God was fixing to strike with judgment and it was a shaking time it was a time where every man was examining himself because the word of the Prophet had not failed one time it had been proven to be true whatever he said it captain just exactly he said the fire was still there and then the Prophet a torn out that God only passed over when he saw the token at the door and it was a desperation I'd imagine the children when they saw was big black wings drop down from the sky like a smoke sailing over the city the screams coming from every house the Chu Romano daddy are you sure that we're under that token and he could go to the door look upon the poster little thing stop that's according to his word remember I'm your oldest child daddy are you positive I am positive that's according to what the Prophet told us and he has a word of the Lord say when I see the blood off heads over you take a lamp for the house I brought all you children in your firstborn that's the ones dying on the net but there is a brother that swap thus saith the Lord buzz so that's my son rest at ease because God made the promise think what daddy why you got your shoes off why you got the staff in your hand well you got a piece of bread in one hand and a lamb in the other hand why is that bitter herbs and days why are you eating lots of sweat round off your face about son yes he's gonna strike see it was in a time of desperation I believe that we're living in the days that we're otherwise the days that we're living in should cause the church to go completely into desperation I'll release since the message this morning from God not me I believe that order Joel this is our congregation into this Friesian we have played home enough we went to church long enough we got to do something how is it that we could see other great signs and wonders done on others and what about us this is called a state of desperation that we are determined before God the sides of his coming should bring this entire congregation when we've read it from the word the Holy Spirit tourists go has certain place such as such a thing what happened not tell us what it was but it would happen we'd go there it happens that way the newspapers packet the magazines package show the picture of it come back here and see those great mysteries hidden the Bible opens up to us on a field that we never know before and perfectly blends into the coming of the Lord Jesus and at the end of the map did you see the action of the great holy spirit seemed calm down visible before people even take pictures of it see if working and showing that is not a man it's not just a preacher it's not a certain congregation it's a holy experience showing the same thing it did when it was invited in the body of Jesus Christ it's embodied in the body of his bride it should thoughts in the desperation though Steve had seen the hand of God and the communion they took it with desperation because they know that something was fixing to happen and we know something fixed to heaven I remember the coming of the Lord will be a sudden secret going away you come and take her like a thief in the night and I think that if somebody all of a sudden or members of our family gone and you're left behind it should draw us into desperation by the grace of God will not be let back behind because anything not don't we don't leave these are they a few days to go away i sharing meadow thompson sang that song remember me when tears are falling down yes remember media when friends are not around well I've crossed over this river joy when you're calling your role remember me no the Lamb's Book of Life I want my name bro how do you remember me on the roll call I chose me in the desperation that is I pause it after I have preached the gospel should obvious a stowaway Slavia a cast off it could happen so shows me into desperate stage desperation to think of enter all these years of preaching when I could I a place karma rocket Bailey what's the next move what must I do next and throws me into a nervous stage now what can I do George Lee to the mountains into the valleys that's hard because while wizard people I've got to be all things to all man that I might win some of the Christ yes but that tokens always before me things see things is cutting up and you can't tell the people you see different things and your opinion then visions that they caught on and something to be sorry you did tell and you know better to do it and then you go so far visions to everything becomes a vision and Georgians are nervous stage you your let me take out my divisions back then the right is this official what about really standing at do you overwork yourself your ratash yourself and you find out things about people it's your wish you didn't know that people have desires these things and all these things they don't realize what that type of ministry cost you don't know what goes with it then it throws at the desperation Lord God no would have to answer jack more said to me one time I hate that answer like you have kids a day of the judgement said God has put these people into your hands and you're going to give it a count for every one of them you're going to answer for your ministry that's been about 15 years ago or maybe 18 in a desperation what will I do let me say only what you say Lord let me tell them what's the truth oh don't say nothing it throws the in desperation then see these signs coming seeing the Holy Spirit take us out there and bring these seals and lay them in like that bring the church age just lay down in they come down on a great big pillar fire backer to reveal himself they come down Olynyk bang all the seven seals and reveal it even put the papers and magazines they come in and take the angels of God that 7yz over the seven messages and confirmed it exactly what the Bible said then during that time come up and breaking the wood see you one of those signs flashes of the in time and bring it up to the beef will tell them how it was all about it the Lord working out there showing himself present and then got it down like this might calm and require that token on every person then you're like people you're the ones that all love these and them's listen to the tapes and so forth then you see what desperation puts me in a bad desperation sighs oh it's time to throw every member of Christ into desperation now about our souls about our our welfare for your actor well what are we going to mouth to if we gain the whole world what are we what are we living for what do you want for what are you eating for what is starving for to live what are you living for to die and you're not fit to live until you're fit to die true and we see some pain miracles of healing it should cut us into desperation Paul are you the boy here somewhere well here's a woman sitting on your ass talking about I just have to look over here if God can do that for that little boy Tori in the desperation a man from New Albany may be here tonight he's a friend of my brother roars I think his wife had cancer once and was healed and now the little boys got was so bad he's just in bad shape look I'm almost answer thrown himself and then he brought the little boy yes his hand up in the back back there it's pretty far the small you see desperation when the wife was about to die with cancer you know that God could heal her then God could heal alive God can heal along and throws it into a state of desperation see you must come and what you're desperate then God to listen to you you don't care where there does or not then that's different you say you do but it takes desperation to do it I believe that the reason we don't have desperation is because it's a lack of love God the love of God I think that the love of God causes desperation if God is in you the token inside of you and you see the conditions of times and people waiting in sin the way they are it'll throw you into desperation I believe it will now the word plainly states you don't put this down in Galatians five and six that faith workers ball of the feet workers below and the only one that you can have faith is heavy love first because after all faith is Laskin city you city that's exactly what my faith in get something cities your level if you don't have drugs you can't have faith see how can you have faith in your wife if you don't love her that's in delial the gospel to God how can it be if you don't love God if you said you love your wife and never tell her about it never make love to her express her to kiss her hug her and tell her she's the best cook in the country the things that you know how pretty she is and how much you love her if you don't do that she'll ever know it that's the way if you do not express it that's the way we do to gone when we sobbing we tell him about it we [Applause] worshipping teeth love promises today that all what if something's got to be done for your life wanna show you the desperation to get it done what somebody says your wife's got cancer what if somebody says your your wife's got TVs she's fixing diet you're doing anything see it'll throw you into desperation that's the same thing that it is we must have love before we can have faith in faith when we have genuine love what them to do it pushes our faith on the battlefront for all genuine godly love for God and for his word and for his people or pushed fades out there that just takes over faith and it's home let's go how'd it go oh that's what love does John 14:23 jesus said if a man loves me he'll keep my words now you can't keep his word to hide and faith and I say see if he loves God then he keeps God's Word if he said out the Lord healed me he believes that love XE believe it because love dominates all you want to speak with Tom angels have not love it nothing see though I have faith to move mountains and have not laugh it's nothing love dominates all cause God is love a God of love now dead center if Jesus said if a man loves me he will keep my words we know it is true that God will meet a desperate soul now we don't know that but it usually takes something to drive us into that to despair to the desperation it takes something to do it we find out and change 5:15 I will say that the affectional that's desperation in factional righteous man availeth much what a righteous man a good man gets in travail our soul travel travail UI optic travels a better word for video Bailey course what the Bible said you're also and change 16 560 said if confessing our faults getting right make it ready far confess our faults one to know Foster ask people to pray confessing our faults walk together and praying one part of the other there you are with love love it I got comedies I can confess to you my wrong you can confess to me your own pray for you you pray for me almost stay with it with a macho thing that's desperation that's what we should have all the time let's take some scripture examples of that what happened now for another about 15 minutes allure buddy Jacob he was the man your first time every boy he thought his own line that he knew that the birthright and everything to him and he didn't care how I had to get it just so he got and after he got he thought everything was alright because he had the birthright he thought the thing was settled talked to his brother when he was hungry coming in from the field from working with the cattle and hunting the deer his brother yeah leaving a big part of punished Wow PZ the things together might have been very tempting when a man's hungry actual walking all day and his brother said I'm just about ready to feet give me some of this he said fella he conspired to me I get the birthright see he didn't care hi done it just so he got and he thought when he got the bread thought that soon Pentecost you thought because you were born of the Spirit harm to the Spirit of God the birthright that selling but it only starts you remember in the message of of hearing him oh that's a child after his bar in the bank of the Kama Sun it had rights to the first time but it had to be proven China tree and then if it did not prove out the piano pedia child to the father's will then it must be did not get these done because air in error nothing yet it was a son but he had nothing if he wasn't interested in the father's worth and so when the Holy Ghost fell of all the Pentecostal people and they began to restore back the gifts and things that was in the church they thought because they were born to the spirit that settling but you see there's a place the other son and Exodus son proved to be a real son then he was taking a public place and then was set up and changed robes and set up there and then there was a placing of a son that he had and of everything the father had God did the same thing to his son oh man transfiguration it was over sheddeth but the cloud that was transfigured and his raiment shine like the Sun and a boy said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased Moses in the law and failed this is him yeah he was place dig now Jacob thought because that he had the birthright that everything was made so did the Pentecostal people and they were gonna organize it the one of the sweetest and Trinitarian of all kinds of organizations and to the point water prude if the token wasn't showing medalist simply strike see that's what I got you Oh see Jacob thought the same thing but in fear one night of his own life desperation took ahold of him what he thought the test across that river in her my brother's waiting to kill me he's going to see the bread right that he had gotten was the thing was going to cause his death and sometimes that third thing that you received as the Holy Spirit it is hard to get on the spirit if you don't want that same thing we'll continue with it right the very deep waters that saved or condemned the world the pain that that you would call fanaticism might be the very thing that condemns you at the end of the room ah Jacob knew that his life was cloaked at the end yeah a mess you're come told me that his brother with $400 man what's coming to me t notice it was on his room here he sent man on a head with oxen cattle and sheep to make a peace offering with Esau then after that he started for the nether older stuff then he started another group with another lorry stuff coming to mediate British guitar attorneys right then you got the thing is that won't stop in the ecology totally rich you're not he doesn't need it then he touches wives his little children and set them across and Esau would see that little children and his wife as it surely all these all known nieces and nephews he would not slam jacob cross the road these needs you know we have time in a car loan shyster before that their excuse expression but have a little maybe was to take up Jacob needs a deceiver and that's what he loved but to some happen to you desperation there may be men and women sitting in a place right before you and the only way you're gonna be able to achieve the thing that you're wanting is to desperately come when you pay for a back to the Holy Spirit their token don't say when I work John Lord o mercy pay your seat don't need it don't need to make it in if he comes it out pass through the prayer but the wall away I'll see if it doesn't be any good runs where you're at then God will move on that takes desperation to rain god of the sea Paul until he got ahold of God and when he did he wrestled not for 15 minutes here at so cheap even his soul hold on it's still he knew he didn't have the bussy and he was able here at so desperately until the besties come then and what he sees until God came on the scene and then in despair when you begin to feel fancy coming at morning some people say glory to God I got it now there are your deceit yeah someone to all this feel so good for the breath oh and I pray Oh shivers run over me god I'm so a great life before me there's still not even God any what I'm talking about the Bible said he breeze the 6th chapter the rain are all the just and the unjust do the same now you take wheat and take weeds and part of an appeal and the rain is actually sent far the wheat but the rain all the weeds is Sanderson times a week and I rated the weeds is just as happy about the ring as the wheat isn't it's a same rain but they Holy Ghost to follow unbeliever and make it just exact same way believer Act but by their fruits their new that's what I'm speaking that's a total today and take a brother and desperation you're here with me somebody she's a fine the personal sense they stick up jump up down out there is it I got it I got it I got it no Jacob stay there something happened he's a different person because that he stayed until that happen and he was able the Bible says he held until he's prevailed how can a man for be over God but you can do it [Music] you can tell it and can prevail over God what time there was a man named Hezekiah I've been told by the Prophet does Santa larger going to die it's a kind of turned his face to the wall and he more years after God had told him that something's going to happen he's going to die and a desperation he changed the program of God desperation be wet bitterly desperation stay there until the blessing came and changed his name hey deceiver you're a prince with God even the nation was called by his name yes sir wasn't the results was because he got desperate

desperation challenge to our faith can we say Amen I'm desperate in the desperation that he's been ministering now or just excited something get excited others are desperate because morning new tonight they can't get away from it the promise the revelation morning new tonight they're thinking about it morning noon night praying about it a man that in all things there could they consult the Lord amen praise the name of the Lord I pray grace Lord to help us that we will be desperate concerning what God has revealed to us oh yeah all down to the scriptures you go from Genesis to Revelation you'll find that that those that God dealt with they had a desperation that a spirit of desperation hunger and thirst for God for the things of God or for something they wander from God is not just casual you know not by any means they really showed an interest show God that you're really serious so show God that you're really sincere show God that you really mean it you know that's that's what God is looking at and there are those that are so casual with it that the Lord just goes on and pasture by but then there's others that are really desperate even if he's looking for desperation in any he's looking for desperation he and his sons and daughters you looking for desperation in the bride amen brother by the grace of God she says she wants to be desperate and she's focusing on the spiritual not on the natural and again the brother brought it out a brother brown-butter but concerning Ruth and so on and Naomi Ruth had a choice Naomi give her a choice Naomi give or pas that was her two daughters-in-law you know and she and she focuses she Naomi just was challenging their faith really it was God challenging their faith now Naomi and and God's gods through Naomi said to the stretch for them oh that's all right you don't have to come with me I'm going back to where my people are and so on and but you can go back to where your people are well Orpah kissed Naomi and went on but not Ruth the but the Bible says that Ruth cleave unto her all she did she it wasn't casual with her he was serious with with with Ruth a man Ruth had some revelation concerning Naomi that that open never had a man Ruth had some revelation concerning Jehovah that open ever had because the Bible says that Ruth went back onto her people and onto her gods and so on and they only was was encouraging Ruth now Ruth you go on back with her Ruth didn't know she's I'm going to go where your people are I'm gonna go where they die I'll die where they buried all be buried a man said she had a revelation there was something in her there's a desperation oh yeah she had to be a desperation for for Ruth to make the sacrifice that she made a man she was a widow or / was a widow Harper went back to her people don't find a husband back there another one but not Ruth no no no she didn't know what God had in mind for her but he wanted to go with Naomi she wanted to be with the children of Israel a man so brother was a tremendous witness or a testimony that that Ruth does Naomi's husband maybe was to Ruth that maybe Ruth Naomi's son was to Ruth a man the one that married her and the one to die but brother again we think oh why in the world did Naomi and her husband leave Israel during a famine and go down to this place and so on you know I'm David they were they were idolaters and so on pagan but a man but God saw Ruth God knew Ruth was there and Ruth was a predestinated seed of God hallelujah that maybe we would say that her name was on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world a man and but this is God's way of doing things a man and God sent said Naomi and and her husband down there and her and their two sons and they married those those two women a man but yet God knew that one of them was his child was his daughter in their souls praise the name of the Lord this is tremendous brother sister Oh again there's no book like this one you got religions and that around the world they got their books but I cheered it it's not like this one the story in their books is not like this one the plan the purpose the pattern in their books is not like this one and I was thinking about I said oh my lord my lord I said we got this book and there's are thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of preachers around the world I said preaching out of this book a man they got this revelation this revelation that revelation but again that's not like the other religions the other religions are just gonna just going to read a form I saw just just a religious book and they'll read this read that and so on but when it comes to the Word of God and when it comes to the Bible a man the god that anointed them in the beginning he anoints them down through the ages the prophets he had nights of doubts for the ages the messengers and the fivefold ministry oh my they're all preaching this is absolutely amazing most words that mostest on fortunately there are some that just stick to or just they'll read the letter of the word letter of the Bible but most just consider how many preachers that God has ordained how many prophets that God has used down through the last almost six thousand years hey man brother it shows the brother is not man it's God absolutely so brother again when it comes to Ruth that God saw Ruth Naomi and her husband maybe didn't didn't know her sons didn't realize it a man but God took took me on his husband God took her sons that's right why did God do that why because it had to come to this place right here that they had to make a decision amen God was going to reach bring Naomi back to Israel praise the Lord all types of examples but God knew what he was doing a man and Orpah and a Ruth had to make their choice make their decision oh brother but brother in the plan of God was a Ruth and Boaz praise the name of the Lord oh just think of that it may be boy a thought or he would have a wife in in in Israel he or she would be a Jew no she was a Gentile hallelujah God's predestinated plan God's purpose gods types of examples to God be the glory hallelujah brother this is not some religion out there in Europe somewhere in Asia not not some religion other some other country no this is God's plan purpose and pattern brother see oh it just highlights so much but Ruth at a desperation that Orpah never had that's right she wanted she know I'm not going back there she said I'm going with you I'm gonna stay with you we're not going back there we're going to stay with the word we're gonna stay with the promise amen God has said in her heart a desperation oh yeah yeah sure yeah if you read the Book of Ruth if not much they're the only two or three pages you read it when roofing back Oh what did she do she felt she felt led to led to boy I believe his name is and so on and she felt led to do this do this Naomi said well just do this they were looking for looking for the Lord to meet their physical needs their natural needs for food and so on but God had a greater plan for Ruth and boys oh yes oh I thank God for that revelation I thank God for His Word Alleluia thank God for his plan and his purpose and his pattern praise the name of the Lord so brother let's be desperate for God and for this revelation of God what God wants to do in us spiritually not naturally by the grace of God there was a spiritual plane that God wanted to fulfill a man in Ruth and Boaz is a spiritual plan that God wants to fulfill in us by the grace of God God help us to be desperate a man as I said Ruth Luther was destined holy was desperate Wesley was desperate and I know others like the old fashioned Salvation Army they were desperate weren't they desperate for God and the things of God the blessings of the Pentecostals I know they were desperate they were brother didn't matter with the rain his brother Ben was bringing out there a man they stood in the rain praise the name of the Lord didn't matter we thought the weather was like they didn't hinder them from going to church or going to for a cottage meeting or fellowship or or a open-air service out there and as I said I've been experienced a number of open-air services around Newfoundland and so on and I believe thank the Lord for that grace I believe I preached the last open-air service in Newfoundland amen and as I said it was in Grand Falls and I think brother and brother cater there was was it was taking was add to control of it but I've ministered the word oh yes we got complaints and told us to turn down our PA system and there was a man sitting about three or four feet from me I was stood up with the microphone and two or three or four feet from me was a was a man that was drunk oh yeah he was drunk but he was in judgment against a lot of others because he stayed right there to hear the word and hear the message yeah and as I said I didn't know what was going on or what happened when I turned around and saw the police the police car was parked behind us and and I brother Aiden Kater at the time he he was he had to go over and and talk to the police because why they were trying to get us to bring it to a close and to turn everything down now so I said well Lord it's in your hands now hey man see it's desperation desperation I preached a preach to preach to preach and laid in the word for the glory of God Amen sir brother were witnesses of the truth we're not going to we're not going to change or be afraid or you know no no we're going to be a witness concerning what God has done and what God is doing by the grace of God amen he said again it was in the message desperation he said now watch what come after the seven seals he said the Uniting of the people he said United signs the red light flashing in the last days he said the sign of woman getting prettier man what they would do all these signs the Holy Ghost he said leading up and then he said come right back here to the capping off of all those messages since the seven seals what message is he referring to the token he preached that in the morning this in the evening he said the token message was the capping off of all those messages since the seven seals it's capped off in this one thing the token that we are all right just check ourselves and see if we are in the faith amen check ourselves and see if we are truly in the revealed Word of God by the grace of God and he said you can't be desperate he said till God speaks to you Oh Church rise shake yourself pinch your conscience wake yourself up in this hour we must be desperate or perish he said there's coming for something from the Lord I know it as thus saith the Lord there's coming for something and we better desperate a mint d'etre for the Resurrection desperate for the rapture and if you're desperate concerning it you're thinking about it morning noon and night yeah as us concerning the same of our house there and we're thinking about it morning noon and night but by the grace of God a man in our hearts were thinking about him in our souls we think about him a man and a brother Bob did mention at the beginning that sometimes we go through the day and we and we forget God we forget Jesus is there that's right but let's get desperate in our souls so that we don't forget it no matter what it is we're going to remember Jesus we're going to a man we're going to experience Jesus amen we love Jesus we want more for fellowship with him by the grace of God concerning what he's done for us what do you want to do for you he said it's between life and death and it is the resurrection the rapture is between life and death he said it'll pass through us and we won't see it let's get desperate so that we're not going to miss what God is doing amen but what God's doing he'll do it in you and through you he's going to bring the resurrection and the rapture to pass in us by the grace of God hey man where is the resurrection rapture seeing you see me grace as I said there were some thoughts on the rapture that I want to express again thoughts that I didn't know about before I never noticed before in the message amen I did I lied I preached on the rapture quite awhile but and that the opening of the seals brings us and gives us rapturing faith that's right but the problem of God highlights it in another way as well he and grace he said we must have love before we can have faith when we have a genuine love it pushes our faith out on the battlefront for God genuine godly love for God for His Word and for his people will push faith out there amen and again he highlighted to the scripture that I've also showed you first Corinthians 13 you can have all of this all of this all of that but if you don't have divine law it's all in vain just saying you can have the understanding of the mysteries of God the scripture and this one this one this and that know this and know that have this gift this gift but even if it's not motivated by divine love it's all in pain how many have believed this word in vain believe this message in vain he said we know it's true that God will meet a desperate soul but it usually takes something to drive us to that despair to the desperation it takes something to do it and we find out in James he said the effectual fervent prayer desperation he said fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much yeah not casual a form of godliness prayer but a heartfelt Holy Ghost desperate prayer it's God crying out for what he wants to do amen it's God calling for what he wants to do in and through us he's the winner righteous man he said a good man gets in travail or soul travel he said travail or travel either which one you want to call it he said when the soul gets in desperation in travailing and effectual fervent prayer of a man that can show the token it does something praise the name of the Lord we'll stay with it with an effectual fervent prayer until it's answered that's desperation that's what we should have all the time amen grace god bless his word to our hearts and grace that the Holy Ghost will take control to bring us to desperation amen to God be the glory amen god bless you let's stand praise the Lord let's be desperate for those that were praying for a man God's grace again to tarry God's grace again to the other saints of God let's let's be desperate just be really sincere what was you be different or to jury your son your daughter your husband your way you'll be different but what about that that other one there you should have the same desperation by the grace of God amen the same victory ahead when the host of Israel led by God round the walls of Jericho softly trot trusting in the Lord they felt the conquerors tread it was by faith desperation they saw the victory ahead a man desperation faith you've got a real genuine thing it'll lead to desperation desperate prayer desperate actions a desperate attitude a man says the arm down it says when like
