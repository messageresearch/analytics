bailey now amen because all things hallelujah [Music] believers though this [Music] amen praise the lord amen [Music] now amen hallelujah grace grace hallelujah now i believe amen praise the lord god bless us and turn with me to the book of hebrews chapter 11 and uh on wednesday we were doing some thoughts on faith we're going to continue those thoughts today and on as far as the lord will take us we'll see amen and of course to share with you some of the thoughts uh that he has revealed to us through through his servant the prophet amen and uh i want to emphasize some thoughts in the message that he preached in 1963 in august and it's entitled perfect faith amen amen and if there's anything by the grace of god that god's requiring of us now it is perfect faith amen and if there's anything that we are without excuse for not having it is perfect faith why because god what what we need forgive us forever faith god has done amen god has given us god has revealed to us so i trust by grace that we are here today with perfect faith when we go out the door we'll have perfect faith amen when we go through the through this week we'll have perfect faith and just it's not just in this church amen it's not just when we oh well i'm going to pray i'm going to do this it's going to do that it'll be amen 24 7. amen we'll have perfect faith we'll be representing the perfect faith god has revealed in these last days amen so god help us to believe with a absolutely complete belief leaving no room for questions or doubt amen there's too many asking a question there's too many made doubting this done in what god has done done what god has said but brother i tell you this the bride has no doubt she believes with an absolute complete belief oh brother sister we could go back because it's in the book of hebrews there chapter 11 and it says oh by faith this one by faith that one by faith what do you mean by faith i tell you this they never read the bible they never read this but they had faith amen it was it was a revelation in the heart and god revealed this god revealed that they and they believed it and they did it amen we go right back to the beginning in genesis and it says by faith abel what by faith where did he get that faith he didn't read it in this book no not by any means he never read this book never read any book amen but he had a revelation in his heart amen brother he knew god he met god he talked with god god talked to him but again let's understand that cain was there too and amen he knew he he knew oh he should give a sacrifice you know and abel oh yeah i want to i want to sacrifice to god and i should sacrifice to god but look at the sacrifice that abel made con concerning the sacrifice that cain made amen oh brother which one had the real faith amen the one that pleased god and in this day and in this hour brother there there there's cain over there and he's doing this and he's doing that but then there's an able brother and i trust by grace that we have the faith that abel had that we're going to offer the the perfect sacrifice we're going to offer amen by perfect faith amen what god requires of us in this day and in this hour amen brother what are we looking for i tell you this a a but cain and abel they were totally cut out they were totally out there of course they heard they weren't in the in the in the where where adam and eve was they were all put out amen so they knew they needed redemption if they can only get back to god we're going to get back into fellowship with god get back into contact with god amen and brother so by faith abel offered the more excellent sacrifice and you cannot like i said cain's sacrifice was excellent it was excellent amen but what about more excellent amen i trust that we are offering the more excellent sacrifice i trust that you are offering the more excellent sacrifice out of your heart today oh brother sister amen and again there and i believe that there's remember cain and abel was right there they and they had talked with god they had fellowship with god and so on but abel offered the more excellent sacrifice and i trust in our fellowship we're going to be like abel amen not king okay he believed god cain was worshiping god cain had a sacrifice amen oh yeah he had all of this on the altar amen oh man and then maybe it looked good maybe it felt good but why what about abel abel what are you offering what are you doing yeah altar is nothing but blood it didn't seem right no it didn't seem right to cain he felt my able shouldn't do that maybe he felt maybe that god wouldn't require that but that's what god required and abel offered it amen even though it was going to he was going he was going to kill the lamb and he was going to shed the blood all over the altar amen yeah but abel had that faith he had he had the more excellent faith offered the more excellent sacrifice i trust we're offering them more excellent sacrifice amen and what god requires in this day and what god required in these last days amen because religion is teaching you that oh you just do this just do this god love this god love that amen oh yeah they think it's this but the first god's concern is this amen believe the word amen that he has given to believe the word that he is giving what's an ordained to do oh as it was with abel bring him back to god bring him back into fellowship with god bring us back into fellowship with god amen not with a church but with god and not only that to get us out of time and into eternity amen and remember that was back there in in genesis and ain't enabled what happened brother man came from eternity into time he got trapped now it's getting back from time back to eternity we we need to offer that sacrifice that god's required in these last days amen not church just church no i'll do this and i'll do that no what does god require when it comes to his word believe the word but not only just believe the word but believe the word for this day amen and believe what god has done and believe what god is doing and believe what god will do praise the lord and that oh yes and not only this let me say to tell you again oh i'm just waiting on the lord no no god's waiting on you the prophet of god said that he said that and there's too many believers that i'm just waiting on the lord what are you waiting for i'm waiting for the resurrection waiting for the rapture amen well praise the lord god's waiting on you because he's given you the resurrection and he's given you the rapture amen again as i said when when i preached that in a in a certain church at all and and uh and even the pastor turned around and said let's say turn around looked at the congregation and he shook his head no no no no and now i said oh no i said i just want to show you i want to prove to you i've been raptured i want to pray to you i've been resurrected because they didn't believe it because they weren't they were looking for the resurrection looking for the rapture but if you want to be a part of the resurrection and rapture up there you've got to have it now amen you've got you've got to experience it now amen and sir listen i said i want to let you know i've been resurrected i want to show you by the word i've been resurrected you are the kraken i said you as he made alive who were dead in sins and trespasses so i said i've been resurrected oh i said i want to let you know i've been raptured that the word yes is right here i said because now isaiah has he has cut us up into a heavenly place in christ and the prophet of god said what's going on up there he said the word is being revealed amen and it's going to give us that faith so that we're not going to just go up there spiritually we're going to be changed physically into a glorified body do god be the glory brother god help us to believe the word god of us to believe what god has done god of us to believe what god's doing amen and what he's going to do by the grace of god amen so he in hebrews chapter 11 and the lord bless us and i want to welcome our visitors again not meaning to forget you amen and our brother david and sister alana my she looks like mom [Laughter] amen so the lord bless sister atlanta and we we thank the lord for oh yes for the testimony she's had of her healing amen praise the lord and you know what that's pointing to it's part of not just the healing of the physical body you're just just here no no it's the change of that body praise the lord brother sister if we don't believe in healing are we going to believe in the resurrection and the rapture that's right probably god said that praise the lord because that's and what god has done for our sister in healing her that's just pointing us to the to the change of the body amen i'll heal the body now i'm going to change the body brother i'll tell you this we need healing we all need healing right here now yeah what for to get out of this physical thing that's that's under under the the sentence of death into eternal life into a glorified body and only that praise the lord amen uh our gray heads there we will be back to regular color amen praise the lord brother sister if you think you feel you feel young look at yourself in the mirror amen and finally and you'll see oh i i do i need the resurrection i'm looking i'm looking maybe a bit young but but but still up here tells me i'm getting older amen so brother when we can step out of time and into eternity amen and we're going to be just as you your your yes brother like our young brothers here uh sister atlantis and brother david's sons here amen just take it just thank god that you won't get old like us amen unless thank god that we're going to be young like them amen they're not going to come up we're but we're going down amen why because it's god and i'll tell you as i said i had a book and i gave it to somebody else but and in that book with the picture of the resurrection yeah and the rapture and in that book oh this painting that somebody did and and they had the babies coming out of the graves and grandmother and grandfather coming at the graves old brothers and sisters and and the young ones and so on and being caught up in a rapture i said my i said they need a revelation because i said the bible says there's not going to be no infant of days nor an old man that has not fulfilled his days so i said well how come that they would resurrect and rapture these old people that's what they had in the painting i gave the book to somebody else amen because why because it wasn't exactly according to the revealed word amen praise the lord amen so when i get there brother i'm not going to see you know our brother david just a gray hair or brother bob getting less hair no no not by any means no we're going to be back to whatever we were 20 years ago about 20 years ago when we were 20 years old amen and uh yes our our brother david is young too but our brother david but's here but but he's younger than us but he needs to get younger yeah amen by the grace of god so let's press on by the grace of god sorry to keep you standing but that's all right brother i because i see people standing a lot lot longer when it comes to the things of the world out there oh yeah they'll stand and stand and then we'll complain keep on going no god's grace to us amen in hebrews chapter 11 and begin to read at verse 1. and he said now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen so do you have the substance and do you have the evidence amen of eternal life for by it the elders obtained a good report i trust we're obtaining a good report through our faith for the resurrection our faith for the rapture and through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear by faith abel offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice than cain amen by which he obtained witness that he was righteous amen offer the more excellent sacrifice in this hour and in this last day what is the sacrifice god's requiring and it will testify of your righteousness amen that has been imputed to us through through jesus and it says god testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh verse 5 by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god amen i trust we have that testimony amen because we're believing for what he not experience the resurrection and the rapture amen but without faith it is impossible to please him amen grace to us to understand without faith it is impossible to please him make your calling and your election sure how make sure your faith is the word amen because without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him by faith noah being warned of god of things not seen as yet move with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house and by the which he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith amen see the importance of faith the significance of faith without it it's impossible to please him verse 8 by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went amen but by faith he so joined in the land of promise as in a strange country and dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the hairs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is god god bless his word you may be seated you can turn to james chapter 2 and just want to read a verse from jude but it you can turn to james chapter 2. and it says in judah says blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand amen and the time is that end for us for the fulfillment of the word for this hour and in james chapter 2 and beginning to read at verse 14. let's go back let's see verse verse 14 what does it profit my brethren though a man say he hath faith and have not works can faith save him and your works is not just going to church on a sunday or on a wednesday but rather it is everyday living so that it is not you that lives it's christ living in you amen this is the manifestation and the revelation of your faith you're expressing it in in the life you live you're expressing it in your actions and your reactions you're expressing it in your in your conversation in your words amen how you're going to talk how you're going to express yourself amen are you going to respond amen to what is going on in the world or to family or friends or neighbors amen it's going to be a reflection of your faith amen and again as i said when we were endeavoring to sell the house there in paradise and the neighbors was was encouraging some other uh individuals to buy the house and they said oh they said you should buy this house and the one that we were selling and they and they said why would you encourage us to buy that one and they said oh he said she said the lady said all the the couple that lived there they were christians and oh yes she said they were absolute christians and then they said they lived it and then and they and they were they're just reflecting it and so on in their their faith oh they were yeah what was the response well the person said oh thank you she said i don't think i'm going to buy it. she said why oh considering she said what i would do in that house she said what i would allow in that house and considering she said the life that they lived there she said i wouldn't want to do that god will honor them for that amen almost heavily i i thought i said that's what they said yes she said that's what they told me that they they couldn't buy that house because she said that they would go do things that wasn't exactly christian and they would allow those things in that house and because of that she said because of that you were you were a clergy because you and your wife were living living for them for the lord and that she wouldn't do it she didn't want to offend the lord amen god honored her for that amen amen oh brother i pray the grace of god and father if if she had that spirit what spirit would we have what spirit does god require us amen if she was going to refuse to do this refuse to do that and then want to offend god in this or that brother amen how much more are we want to have that same attitude that we don't want to offend god in what we're going to do with family or friends or neighbors no because brother sister if you're born again i tell you this you're you're now you're part of a different family absolutely a different family and the relationship with the natural is is down but the relationship with the spiritual is up the relationship with your spiritual family is more important now to you than the physical amen praise the lord because now we've been come together with an eternal family the other is going to pass away and you'll just leave it with the lord and pray the grace of god to your family pray the grace of god to friends and neighbors amen but you're going to put more and more fellowship in with the natural aim with the spiritual family and i tell you this first when we come to this word and first when we come to this message oh believers i don't it doesn't make a difference who they were whether they were young or old or in between amen i tell you this they were living for one another as believers oh yeah and and and the natural family was was becoming a little bit jealous well because it was it was i was challenged with it with a certain family member one time and then and because oh they said oh what's wrong with you they said you're spending more time with them than you do with us you're more caught up with them than you are with us why because they were natural family but again at the same time they were not exactly christian amen but yet when we when we would go to an area where there was natural family we would just say hello we just maybe you know stop in for a moment and just move on to the believers amen well yeah and then we would we would stay with the believers yeah oh yeah because i remember listen let me show you with this this is tremendous amen you're talking about god in nature and i remember one time that we went we went and we took our our pet with us and it was a cat yeah and and we went and we visited as a family member and we we just went in and and we're going to spend some time with the family there and and even the cat wasn't wasn't comfortable no oh the cat was oh it was joe's just so as out out of order and out of line oh my they said what's wrong with the cat i said oh she's not comfortable here i said for some reason i don't know and so after a little while that we didn't stay there very long after a little while we just moved on and two up to a believer's home and when we did oh my the cat went in what's the first thing she did the cat went in got up on the dress field went to sleep oh she's relaxing oh yes i said she's relaxing i said she didn't relax up the other house which she's reduction here because it was a believer a believer's home amen and i'll tell you this in that believer's home they even even clergy from other churches denominational churches that they would they would come into that home and and have prayer with brother this brother and sister why and why because they said oh we feel different here and yet this brother and sister didn't go to denominational church but that denominational clergy would come he always looked forward to coming to visit that that couple why because when he couldn't get into the home the atmosphere was different oh they felt the presence of god and the anointing was there oh yes and they said well now we want just want to share share the word with you and we want to pray with you so brother do they feel that way when they come into your home i pray the grace of god help us that you know what it is you know what it takes you've got to live in the spirit and you've got to walk in the spirit amen if you live in the spirit water in the spirit that means he's in control amen if he's in control out there he's in control in your home amen and that anointing is in your home praise the name of the lord god of us that we have that faith that pleases god amen all right sorry let's go to james chapter 2 again amen and it again let me read it again verse 14. what does the prophet brought my brethren though a man say he hath faith and have not works can faith save him not without works faithful that works he's dead and there's many a believer that got a dead faith how many of us got living faith amen how many got faith that pleases god amen praise the lord so faith without works is dead therefore he said if if it has not works can faith save him no it's a dead faith and if a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food and one of you say unto them depart in peace be warned and filled notwithstanding you give them not those things which are needful to the body what does it profit amen even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone now brother sister does your faith have works oh yeah yes sister atlanta i believe that that the healing was a work that god did amen so it wasn't faith without works it was faith with works amen showing that god was there showing that god was with her god within her amen i trust that god is with us god is in us amen by the grace of god praise the lord we know it is grace praise the lord do we have that faith and as i said yeah you can't have it if it's a living faith okay how can you just be just not express yourself not express it if you got a living faith and as i said i saw sister lana when she was testifying of god ailing her and she she ran down the the the aisle in the church there and brother tim pruitt's and she ran down the aisle back up again ran down the hall and back up again i said praise the lord i said there's an expression of faith and praise to the lord amen how many of us want to praise the lord for what he's done for us oh yeah well well brother he never healed me didn't i didn't experience this and experience that no but you experienced redemption he's he'll just fear spiritually i trust he's healed you spiritually amen by the grace of god so brother it all it ought to produce in us what he's done for us spiritually what would it produce in our sister atlanta what he did for her physically and not only physical which was also a testimony of her spiritual by the grace of god amen don't put too much on the physical brother you got you remember it's there's got to be a spiritual that's that's that's causing it that's doing it amen god help us that we have faith with works because if you don't have the works amen brother we can go to hebrews 11 again and it can say oh by faith he did this by faith he did that by faith he did that so what are you doing by faith yeah exactly brother amen so brother sister what you do morning noon and night by faith you're going to follow god's leadership you're going to follow the leadership so it's not you that lives it's christ that liveth in you amen and if christ is living in you then morning noon and night it's not you living the life it's jesus living it in you oh i'm going to do this and i'm going to yeah but it's christ in you by the grace of god how many family friends and neighbors look at you and see jesus see christ again as i said let me give it further it's for the glory of god amen and if we're going out there as christians we're going to grow because we want to we want to reflect jesus for the glory of god why but when we consider what he's done for us we consider what he's doing and we consider what he will do amen on to eternal life we want to give him the glory you want to love him you want to serve him amen you want to reflect there amen you're not going to be ashamed of him amen and as as i said let me say for the glory of god that when i was working for the military and and that gentleman came and just tapped me on the shoulder and i said yes i said excuse me what is it oh he said i just wanted to tell you he said that i know you're a christian oh oh i said well i said for the glory of god it's the grace of god yes he said but i just want to let you know that i recognize it okay i said lord bless you and said after we went on and he went on amen and again another time i was doing some work there and uh and and then some people passing by and one of them was a he was a soldier i think and he stopped and he said oh excuse me he said yes i thought he wanted me to do something there no he said just want to tell you he said that that i know you're a christian he said you don't have to tell us we know because you're living it i said oh i said well only by the grace of god oh yes he said well but i just want to let you know we appreciate it yeah and i've received other other others coming to me and saying the same thing amen but i wasn't i wasn't going to talking to them i wasn't going you know just being religious but as too many people it's just religious but they're not spiritual amen well religious talk the letter of the word talk the letter of the message oh yeah this doctrine that doctrine oh yeah but they don't have it spiritual yeah because why because their actions and reactions prove they don't have the anointing within them yeah they got the and brother the prophet god said you can be in the message but the message not in you and there's many of the message they're in the message but they're not the message is not in them amen because if the message is in you you're going to live it amen if you're in the message you're going to talk it but not walk it amen god help us brother sister no wonder when the son of man comes will he find faith what faith considering what god has done and considering the word that god has revealed surely he find faith if but there's going to be very few that's right brother why the prophet of god said he said well one time he said there might be 500 living saints go into rapture around the world and there's two million no i think he says five i'm not sure 500 million i'm not sure how many christians around the world but he says if there's one in a million he said there might be 500 going to rapture but brother i tell you this he lowered that and he lowered it and he lowered it tell him there another time he said it might be a dozen the problem someone said oh brother branham if god asked you if the lord asked you to go there and and pick up the bride he said would you do it he said i might get a dozen i said what yeah he said he might get a dozen and i it's getting fewer and fewer and fewer because more and more and more are becoming more denominational because in the messages the prophet god warned us that the people water he said what happens to the people he said god does this god does that and he said then after a short time he said they just go back into a denomination not not out there in denomination but a denominational spirit gets on them i trust by grace we don't have a denominational spirit no no the holy spirit the holy ghost amen so the the the word brother is not like a denomination or a creed and like i said to a lot of people this is this is one creed there's another creed oh yeah oh we believe this and we believe this brother what you believe you go and live it controls you amen knowing that it controls and governs what you're looking for and what you're believing for amen and what brother what has happened down through the years when it comes to all that god has done down through the ages oh they became a denomination and all they just believed the past not the present or the future oh god did this god revealed this but what's god revealing and what's god doing amen because the prophet of god warned us concerning the message of the hour now he said as you go on he said more is going to be revealed yeah he said so he said he said dig deeper amen amen brother sir that we're recognizing not just that god sent a prophet but brother recognizing the message says lord yeah praise the lord it was the opening of the seventh seals that's good praise the lord but yet where's the faith that it's ordained to give us yes oh it's the faith that god did this god did that yes but he's given us the faith of what god's doing what's he doing brother what are we believing for luther was luther was believing for one thing wesley was believing for another and the pentecostal is another what are we believing for brother we got it was not did we thank god for luther thank god for wesley as i said brother we thank god for justification sanctification and the gifts of the spirit amen the anointing of the holy ghost amen but now brother god has brought all those things and give us now what are we to be doing what are we to be looking for what is god expecting of you and me now brother god god is expecting more of us than he did in luther or wesley or the pentecostals amen what god's expecting of us now is the resurrection and the rapture how many of us are getting into getting into a resurrection and a rapturing faith luther got into justification faith with sanctification faith and the pentecostals the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit and the power of god said they're still there he said they're just laying on the count on the shelf there and he said if you want them they're there but now god's requiring of us resurrection rapturing faith amen this is what age is this anybody know amen this is the bright age amen there's too many still back in the pentecostal age yeah but brother by the grace of god we're in the bright age and what is what's god doing in the bright age resurrection and rapture amen it's the invisible union of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride praise the lord amen brother and for to go into that complete union there has to be a resurrection and a rapture praise the lord not just a spiritual union but it's going to get into a physical union into glorified bodies by the grace of god brother are we getting that faith god laying laying in the word leaning in the word laying in the word to give us that faith amen god is laying in the word laid in the word to get us to look up amen not look here look there oh look here look there oh yeah yeah we'll keep looking at this no you better look up the resurrection by the grace of god brother if there's anything that god's requiring of us now it is perfect faith perfect faith for the resurrection perfect faith for the rapture as it was in jesus now he's looking for the same in mrs jesus christ amen the word was made flesh in the son of god now his word may flesh in the bride of the lord jesus christ amen brother oh yes the word was made flesh and all down through the ages but it was only a portion of the word but now is the the fullness of the word in the beginning was the word the word was with god the word was god the word was made flesh and dwelt among us as it was so it is now amen amen this was in this back 2000 years ago it was in in our lord jesus christ the son of god now it's in the bride of our lord jesus christ amen right brother amen so you've got to believe that for the if you want to be part of the resurrection you've got to believe it amen and claim it by the grace of god brother we come to the place of perfect faith god help us amen see james 14 where did i go verse 17 again says even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone your works is going to reflect what you believe yeah it's going to reflect your faith in the resurrection the rapture that's what you're looking for yeah yeah a man may say thou has faith and i have works show me thy faith without thy works and i will show thee my faith by my works amen so are we reflecting our faith by the life we live huh sister lana's healing was a reflection of her faith oh yeah so we're going to go forth and reflect it in in other areas of our lives reflected in our separation unto the lord reflect there now our separation from sometimes from family friends and neighbors yeah it's a reflection of faith it's what we believe it's not that we it's not that we want this and what that we just want the will of god whatever god wants will do yeah by the grace of god amen and thy belief is that there is one god thou does well yeah i think we don't believe in trinity well neither does the devil it says read there the devils the devils also believe and tremble amen amen so they believe this they believe that they believe the word and they tremble but there's believers that believe it and they don't tremble they don't have that fear of god and that i'm when i say fear of god means i'm not afraid of god no you have absolute respect for god that's what it means yeah people think oh the fear of god the fear of this the fear of the no there's certain things you're gonna you should be fearing the devil yeah but you don't have to fear god or fear jesus if you're his son and daughter amen praise the lord so brothers sisters thou believers say there is one god thou do us well but the devils also believe and tremble so brother we ought to tremble too considering what god has done and what god is doing amen and considering why tremble considering that we are born in sin born and we're in this in this physical body and we're believing in longing and calling for resurrection calling for a glorified body to get out of here amen please don't let this message don't let what god has done don't let it become just religion to you no let it become an absolute spiritual revelation it is god dealing with you very personally god god loves you amen and he's there to reveal his word he's amen he'll hide it from others but he'll reveal it to you amen you'll give this he'll give this and give that to give them this faith this faith amen but he'll keep it from the others because they're not going to honor the way the bride will glory now remember again don't because i know there's many many many many believers that that looked on their noses that others out there don't do that because we're bride but still there's some of them are going to be saved that's right they're not bride so just just commit them to the lord and move on but keep your attitude right in your spirit right and again again what the the angel rebuked the prophet when he was looking at that woman walking down the street there and he was criticizing her and the angel said don't you do that he said some of them are my children amen not bright but they're not going to be in the city they'll be outside the city but they're going to be or as we know they're going to they're going to have a right attitude right spirit because god knows the heart yeah amen well yeah and they'll they'll be certainly a new creature when they get to glory for sure amen and god god's got a lot of their faith god honors their their respect amen so again brother we're bright but don't look down your noses at anybody else that's why the problem of god would respect if he no matter sometime when he was preaching oh yeah and they think that brother brown oh what after they opened the seals brother brown was would go to a certain place where he was asked to come and preach and he would preach there in one way and when he get to where all believers were he preached another way he said brother brown why'd you do this why'd you do that i i shared the quotes a few years ago where the problem of god said well he said listen i did it because he said they're not bride so he said i'm going to minister to them he said according to the way what their faith in god oh yeah not bright you'll minister to the bride one way but he's going to minister to the others another way amen god help us don't get self-righteous there's too many self-righteous don't again please in the name of jesus keep your attitude right keep your spirit right toward them all right listen oh we shouldn't oh we shouldn't deal with this one shouldn't deal with that one oh wait a minute why no and if this was in your church considering what they did you shouldn't let them do this shouldn't what brother listen jesus talked to the woman at the well now and she had he said you you have five husbands and he said one you're now living with is not your husband and you need fellowship with her oh yeah did and he offended the disciples they decided to say you're talking to that woman they knew who she was because why because the tradition back there was that you there's certain time that you would that that you could go to the wall the well to get water and there's certain times that they would go to the well and you wouldn't go because of who that woman was that was the tradition and the disciples didn't understand why jesus would go up there where that woman was and talk to her whereas the jews they they wouldn't go because at a certain time that's when they were allowed to go to the well but nobody else would go yeah yeah but jesus went and talked to her yeah he rebuked the disciples why because oh yeah he said you had five husbands the one you're now living with is not your husband and she was living in sin and he talked to her this talked to her that oh and he struck her in the heart and she took off she said oh you're the messiah and she went and she gave witness to others and they came yeah responding to her faith and they came to jesus they said oh she said they said you're right he is the messiah amen brother so you don't know who god's going to use [Laughter] amen brother we think god's going to use the the righteous but i tell you the righteous he uses is those that are righteous in jesus name amen oh we think oh god's going to use this when god's going to use it or they they're not guilty of anything they're not guilty of this brother god's going to use the ones that are guilty of the worse yeah amen sister that's right because why sinners saved by grace and you'll use sinners saved by grace to be a witness to you to humble you amen only you true that to that brother or that sister's testimony amen hallelujah respect that brother or that sister's testimony amen to god be the glory don't boast in yourself boast in jesus amen so brother c god god is not accepting anyone with self-righteousness amen no no brother all that comes got to humble themselves to acknowledge that we are sinners saved by grace amen sinners saved by grace by the grace of god praise the lord amen sorry again verse 19 says thou believers that there is one god not a trinity but one god that's good but he said the devils also believe and tremble so stay humble thank god for the revelation and move on amen by the grace of god look up brother we're getting we're getting into the resurrection getting into the rapture we are bright understand that not everybody out there is bright but as i said let me say it again the bride is going to be in the city with the bridegroom but the others will be outside the city and knowing that the bible also speaks of those that will bring their glory and their honor into the city but they're not bright god help us brother we need a real revelation of humility amen he said well thou know vain man that faith without works is dead amen grace of god to us it was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar sees thou out faith brought with his works and by works was faith made perfect this is new testament oh i'm saved by grace through faith that's it no works wait a minute if you if it's by grace through faith it'll produce the works amen the works of the revealed word the works believing the word amen and says see us now how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect praise the lord so brother and it's not just going to church is the life you live actions reactions the testimony you're you're reflecting amen to the people god help us amen yeah it might be where you're going to school it might be where you're going to university amen it might be where you're working but you do it as a christian and again as i said i was working with the military and basically in the kitchen and not necessarily a chef there or maybe just a cookie that i would do something here something there they would call on me to do this or calling me to do that but i remember when i was taking that break and we were in the in the in the room there with a few others that we were taking the break usually a 15-minute break and again i haven't mentioned these things very much i don't want to boast about it but give god the glory and again when i was sitting in the room with others there just for a break there was a time when uh one or two people came again looked in the room says oh uh gerald i said yes i said what do you want me to do oh we said nothing we just want to let you know that we know you're a christian we appreciate that thank you i said lord i said what's all this about is to give him the glory i tell you whether they must have reflected they must have been seeing jesus experiencing jesus hell to god be the glory and i've been serving there one time and there was a big line up and there somebody came to the part of the line and they were they mentioned some things they said there's a certain thing and there was only me and the chef there behind the counter and he sort of shocked a number of people and i said excuse me i said you shouldn't say that i said you need to repent i said ask god to forgive you amen because he made some harsh remarks what it was i don't know now i don't remember but i do remember taking my stand and and the others that were in the line oh they they agreed yep yeah good good yeah and i believe the person did repent and ask forgiveness so our brother are we reflecting our faith by our works taking your stand at work at home no matter where it is especially at church you know taking your stand for the truth take a stand for the word that you're going to you're going to even in church you're going to be an example to to the other brothers and sisters by the grace of god a sincere heart a right spirit and the right attitude because many times over the years they all over through the through the years with this message i i've seen people with bad spirits wrong spirits wrong attitudes self-righteous you know they point their oh yeah they would point their fingers down at this one that one out there especially if they were part of a denomination i said look believe them i says may the grace of god that they'll come to the word as you leave that with the lord and then they'll go and condem believers you know point their fingers at believers whether you forget it pray one for another amen by the grace of god keep your attitude right keep your spirit right amen are you bride bring forth the works of the bride amen so again in verse 20 2 see is thou how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect amen the prophet of god is preaching not perfect faith but the perfect revelation of the word but it will produce the perfect works that god's looking for amen what's god looking for now yeah thank god for healing and our sister elena but god's looking for what looking for the resurrection and the rapture the change of the body praise the lord and the prophet of god did say again let me say it he said if you don't believe for healing how can you believe for the rapture that's right brother because the right because the the rapture is the total healing of the body that's right so if you're sick let's believe god amen if you're not sick let's believe god for the change of the body lord uh lord i feel this in the body i sense this in the body we got to deal with this we got to deal with that that's all right my son by grace are you saved through faith trust me yeah believe for the rapture believe for the resurrection again how many of us father god said god is waiting on us and then he said another place he said yes and the dead in christ are waiting on us they're right there they're not over they're not out there in the grave no no that's the old body they do they they were living in that's that's the body that was under the curse yeah but he said there's going to be dust amen and so that's gone so he they're gonna receive a glorified body amen oh it'll be like that one when it comes to you you see them it'll be like that only they'll be around the prophecy around 20 years old when we get into that dimension and so brother sisters they're right here they're right there when the prophet of god went beyond the curtain of time oh he saw sister hope sister mita and they came running to him oh and they thought she should see he thought they were going to call him you know their their husband or whatever and they just referred to him as a mate you know and uh and they oh they welcomed them you made it you made it praise the lord yeah they were just a brother and a sister by the grace of god you know in eternity i pray grace lord almost have more and more faith that they're not up there they're not out of that cemetery they're right here and they are waiting on us because when that hour comes that we come to that perfect faith they're going to step into time and they're going to the power of god said they're going to they're going to step in and and meet with us yeah and then he said we're going to be changed into a glorified body and go into that dimension with them and then he said praise the lord he said well then we're going to look up and see and see jesus and we're going to rise to media in the resurrection and the rapture praise the name of the lord hallelujah god help us brother sister to have that perfect faith that god's required in this hour for the resurrection and for the rapture amen so again verse 22 sees thou faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect so is your faith made perfect by your works is your faith made perfect by the life you live in your actions and reactions amen so that god can trust you for more and more and more faith with more and more faith yeah and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god and you see then how that by works a man is justified i trust by grace that we're the friend of god that by works we are justified and not by faith only and many preach that it's only by faith no according to according to the the the scriptures right here it is faith and works because i tell you faith without works is dead but if it's faith producing the works then then it's a living faith and it's god in you is christ in you living it out amen oh my we got to have the balance of the revealed word you see then how by works a man is justified and not by faith only and likewise also was not rahab the harlot justified by works when she had received the messengers and had sent them out another way for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also if you truly got faith you will have the works that reflect the faith amen bear with me i'll try not to be too much longer he said faith this is the prophet in the message perfect faith he said faith is based on forgiveness a forgiving spirit and he said as we said this morning trying to get the church into the place to where we could really see apostolic times moving among us and he said it's just laying right at the door and we want it such a flow he said it'll be it'll be a help to us he said flow out to others and remember he said jesus he said he never used his power for himself he used it for others that's what it was said for and brother if we got the same anointing the same holy ghost in us we're living for others not just you and you ignore your brothers and sisters no you're there to help them you're praying for them you know god help us and you think sometimes he said why would a man that was so full of power like jesus would have to be ever ever be sick yes sir i read in some books somewhere where when we he raised up that boy the widow's son from nain and he said and he sat on a rock and groaned with a headache yeah and he said he bore our infirmity and he and to bear those infirmities means that he packed them and he said he had sickness he had temptations he had trouble he had frustrations just as we have because he had to be the right kind of a mediator amen so he had to be a partaker and the husband man of the fruit amen before he would know and the woman at the well and many things see they looked right into the scriptures amen jesus came to identify with you and me and to experience what you and i experience and he did amen he did but he said not now he said we want to speak upon faith a different type of faith perfect faith he said that's a great thing and he said faith we're told in the bible faith cometh by hearing and you cannot be saved without faith and faith is something that you have to believe it's there that really nothing else will declare it but faith amen he that cometh to god must believe that he is and it's impossible to please god without faith and he said if you could see him it would be no more faith but he said you don't see god physically but spiritually amen god is there yeah and he's with you day in and day out he's there to help you he's there to encourage you he's there to reveal this reveal that do this do that where are you lord the works that you see is him he's there do you believe is he with you at home is he with you in your in your job i pray gracious with you in the church remember again he comes with the saints but the prophet told us the first one in church is the devil yeah yeah so i trust you come with jesus why because you got the devil to deal with amen most definitely he's there why because he's there to challenge the word he's there to challenge your worship amen oh brother sister god tells us that we're going to come with faith amen through our lord jesus christ and listen he said he said if you could see him it would be no more faith so anything that senses declares is no more faith it's a scientific fact it's not no more faith he said you have to accept him by faith he that cometh to god must believe that god must believe god and faith comes by hearing the word see you must believe he said this is god's word and you must come to god by the word just take the word amen and god's been dealing with you today today this afternoon god's dealing with you with through the word not brother gerald amen brother no it's not brother journal yeah and when you're back in the wild is it it's not temp brother temp road it's god yeah he's dealing with the people through the word oh well the bible says you know that god has through the ministry of the bible ministry god has set in the church amen for the perfecting of the saints so i can't do it in myself but again it's like the prophet of god said amen when he would come he would preach and then he would move get move into the the realm of of healing and praying for the sick now he said i got to get out of the way yeah i got to get out of the way so he could take over so he said because i said i can't do this and he couldn't he needed the holy ghost to do it he needed the anointing to do it discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart and declare thus saith the lord you're healed thus saith the lord this thus saith the lord that amen god help us get yourself out of the way so that jesus has controlled you now amen he's ministering the word and he's receiving the word oh he's there to give you the word he's there he's in you to keep to take the word to become one with the word hallelujah he said listen abraham had to believe just what the voice told him amen that's the truth and again they never read the scriptures like you and i have you know to go back and and they'll read read the bible well i i believe god this i believe god that no no brother god was giving to them and they they had to write what god what you and i are reading now it was their experience is their faith oh yeah brother from genesis to revelation it's a revelation of faith the faith the faith of the of of the prophets the faith of abel and cain and the faith of yes of isaac and and and jeremiah and so on right on through to the faith of john the revelator amen god revealed himself through them to the elect hallelujah see faith by hearing the word so where did faith get where did abel get the faith god must have spoke to abel in his heart not not just hearing the word with this these ears let him that hath an ear not ears let him that earthen ear hear the word amen where is that where is it it's in the heart there's too many think oh god i'm going to hear the word with these ears no got to hear it in your heart hear it in your heart by the grace of god that's like god ministering the word and there can be there can be two people and one said oh yeah that's right that's right and the other one say i don't understand what he's talking about where's the other follow those why because one is getting it in the heart and the other one is getting it in your head amen god's in the heart revealing his word amen i trust god is in your heart revealing his word to you amen and that what that praying the grace of god that that's why you're here and that's why you're going to church is because of the word amen there's a hunger and a thirst for the word and why because faith comes by hearing the word and you want to hear the word the word the word amen amen oh brother i got a bible so i can read it yes that's that's fine that's good but again you got to hear it preach because god has set in the church this ministry of that ministry for the perfecting of the saints it's not just to get you to read the bible intellectually but for you to hear the word being preached and trust that is not being preached intellectually but spiritually spiritual revelation amen he said again faith is actual substance amen of what god reveals now he said these are real deep lessons and i'll catch the top of it and then you go you dig down into it amen how many are digging down into the word to get resurrection and rapturing faith we got to really dig down into the message amen what for brother to get the faith that god god has ordained to us in the message of the hour oh yeah it's not just the opening of the seals and this and and the revelation of the guardian the revelation of water baptism the rest of the that's all is it but again brother the faith that god god wants all of that to give us the faith that pleases him amen that honors god respects god amen to get to get our attention oh brother sister what's it ordained for the brother ended all god did this through in the message of the earth there are three pools god did this god did this god did that but brother all of it is to bring us to resurrection and rapturing faith amen all that god did in luther was to bring him to justification and wrestling sanctification the pentecostals the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit amen but brother now what god has done now is to is to give us yeah we got the faith of justification we got the faith of sanctification we got the faith of the gifts and the baptism of the holy ghost but now brother god is giving us the faith for the resurrection rapture to get out of here god gave them the faith to do this faith to do that but now he's given us the faith to go from time to eternity let's be more conscious of eternity and less of time god help us he said these are real deep lessons but he said i'll catch the top of it you dig down deep into it and he said notice that it's something that you possess not imagination yes you really have it it's just as real amen as you know that you're sitting in a church it's just as real as you hear my voice and it's a substance not imagination it is not emotion but it is something that you have and it comes to you by hearing the word of god faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of god and that puts it back to where you your faith then is not in some individual is not in a man he said it's in god because god is the word and your faith is in god amen well it's in the word yeah god is the word he said you see somebody else he said do something by a word act of god a promise of god many of them say i can do that too and when they do you find them wrecked up out there somewhere it's got to be substance that now he said that is that is potentially a faith but when it's revealed to you it's a faith a perfect faith that cannot fail amen if it's revealed to you amen grace he said you must hear the word god's word is that all sufficient word and it's all you have need of is this word amen for there's many times that people have faith today tomorrow they haven't got faith the next day there's something but when god once anchors it you see there's nothing ever going to make you move from real faith amen no no once it strikes you in the heart that's it if it's only in your head oh yeah the devil will change it yeah if it's in the heart no it's forever see forever settled he said i want you to get this now the church has got to lift itself in the power of god how he said we are too close to the end now and i believe the church is in condition where we can teach it a little deeper things and rub some of this make-believe out and get into something real he said it's got to be something that you know amen you know it to be the truth he said god uses man man only god doesn't use machinery god doesn't use groups of man god doesn't use organizations god uses individuals always amen amen he said others have people come say oh i got all faith oh i sure have well what are you standing there for he said you your very actions prove you haven't got what you're talking about amen grace that we're going to go forth and live it amen what we talk we'll live by the grace of god brother you believe in the resurrection rapture you're going to live the life that's looking for the resurrection rapture you're going to live the life that's expecting the resurrection rapture oh yeah because faith faith makes it more real to you than what's going on in the world people are more caught up with what's going on in the world what's going on maybe in this part of the world that part of the world in america maybe in europe maybe in asia oh yeah they're caught up and oh they want us what's going on what are they going to do now what's when is this going to happen yeah but the bride is caught up with the word this comes that goes this comes that goes oh my well we know that all these things are going to going to take place all these things are going to happen in the world because the bible prophesies this prophesies that but we're not caught up with that we're just caught up with with the resurrection of rapture lord i'm expecting the resurrection lord i'll tell you the more and more that goes on in the world the more and more that we're going to get more conscious of the resurrection rapture oh yeah we're gonna get oh lord anytime now maybe before maybe before another day comes we'll let there be a resurrection rapture lord i want to be conscious lord of the saints that are gone on lord i pray grace oh god that that when the dead in christ arise that they're going to appear to me amen and then we're going to be changed and caught up with them to meet the lord in the air oh brother and sister there he is amen we can be caught up spiritually and recognize him but now we're looking for the change to be cut up in a physical sense if the problem of god said see here's jesus that's right no no there's the prophet right there brother man he was caught yeah he was oh yeah here he is right there in the cloud of angels i trust by grace that we're going to get caught up and that we are being cuddled now we will be we are being caught up in the process to where one day we're going to let go and we're gone by grace grace god give us that faith amen brother let's recognize what took place he said there he is he said looking down at us amen and what is he doing he's giving us the word to catch us up to him by the grace of god and again all praise the lord brother brown said see he said i'm not there he said i'm right here and he is if you get that picture you look at it here he is i can see him you can see brother madam i said yeah i see brother brown right here he's there any any and he identified this and he highlighted it now he said i want you to i want you to notice he said that's not he's i'm not there he said i'm right here you know he's right here in in a i would say maybe it's theophany body but everybody was seeing this beyond this it's him by grace oh brother sister god help us amen and again the prophet god did say too and he said if anybody said looks at this picture if anybody sees anything other than jesus he said they're not seeing it as they should because why he said because this is jesus the lord jesus christ amen he has come down to catch us up amen he has come down to give us the word to give us the faith to be cut off in the resurrection please in the name of jesus god help us amen to believe what he's done and to believe what he's doing god's not dead brother he's still with us the prophet is gone but he's still with us amen as i've said i remember going to a meeting in gamble and uh i remember when i i got out of a a not necessarily a vehicle i guess i don't know but i remember before i went into brother and sister barnes home and i looked up to the end of the town where where i was living at the time and right at the right on the on the where the the sky and the earth met i said oh what what in the world is that oh brother it was almost like this here but i could see and oh it was all it was just lit right up the rest of the sky was all dark but on the on the on the border there red blah blah broth above the earth was all this this light and it was like something like this i said this is and i was just a young boy i was just maybe in my late teens yeah when i saw it i said thank you lord amen had another time too i was just giving the experience i was in a home here in st john's east where my parents lived and i remember lying in a bed there and i turned i was praying and reading my bible and i just turned back laid back on the bed and when i did i looked and i saw the mountain you did yeah and there was the mountain and i and i climbed the mountain to see jesus they said yeah i said yeah i said oh lord oh lord i said don't leave me don't leave me amen i fell back on the bed and it disappeared amen do god be the glory i've had many experiences over the years of things that i have seen things that god has done for me and things that god has revealed he said again if you had perfect faith you would look right straight to god amen because your faith has done made it you have no need of these things he said do this do that no faith is done amen he said your genuine faith would do it right there he said look at that little woman with the blood issue and she said if i can only touch the border of his garment i'll be made well and as soon as she did it she said she felt within herself that her blood issue stopped she actually believed it do we believe as she believed for that do we believe for the resurrection and the rapture we're believing for the change of our body as sister atlanta was believing for the healing of her body so let's believe for the change amen hallelujah and brother that if she ran up down the aisles in the church that we're gonna run up and down in glory amen praise the lord he said now listen at first the disciples did not have this perfect faith they didn't have it because they had christ walking with him but then afterwards christ was in them and so you see it's hard then to have that perfect faith without the holy spirit it has to bring it and it does now you say the disciples didn't have perfect faith no for they had an epileptic child there that they were trying to cast this devil out of them and they couldn't do it and as the father seen jesus coming he said we have brought thy son to your disciple my son to your disciples and they could not cure him and afterwards the disciples asked jesus saying why could not we cure him and jesus said because of the lack of faith he said of your unbelief amen now remember they had the power jesus had given them power to heal the sick raised the dead cast out devils just a few days before but they had the power but not the faith to use the power amen he's given it to us let's have the faith to use it please in the name of jesus now he said here is the random tabernacle there's the church the bride today the holy spirit is here with the power but you haven't got that faith to move it see what i mean it takes faith to move it perfect faith to ignite the power of the holy spirit which we have now that's brother we need that faith we want to get out of here we want to go into a resurrection want to go into the rapture let's focus on our faith amen by the grace of god that we're going to be built up in the most holy faith and thank god that luther had faith wesley had faith the early pentecostals had the faith amen but now brother and sister god's looking for your faith in you and in me for the resurrection he did this he did this he did that he did that but now he wants to manifest the resurrection and rapture not only in jesus but jesus in you and me by the holy ghost and that's why god has done what he's done in this hour and in this age in sending the a prophet with the revealed word amen and confirmed is confirmed the ministry of the prophet with his own presence amen to get the attention of the bride and to give the bride the faith that he wants the bride to have to to be resurrected and raptured he said could you compare a christian today with them christians of long ago how them disciples walked in the power of the spirit moved by the holy ghost and he said just a prisoner as i preached on the other night a prisoner to the word and the will of god and he couldn't even move until god moved him wouldn't you like to see a church rise like that it's going to it's going back it's got to come he said it's on the road right now for the word identified himself what he was and the same word identifies us god help us amen and when it comes to being a prisoner for the word to the word we think if we go into jail we're a prisoner no you're a prisoner to the word now are you a prisoner now to the word you're just in the word if you're if you're in a natural jail you can't get out you're bound in oh i'm in prison yeah are we prisoners to the word by the grace of god yeah we're bound to the word for the word amen he said if you are a believer recognize yourself as a believer and recognize that these things are for you and if there's condemnation in your life straighten that first and believe amen he says jesus lived in a world that no one knowed about he was a hard person he lived in a world of perfect faith in the perfect god and if we live in a perfect faith of a christian to what we are we'd be a mystic to the world and the people wouldn't understand you you'd walk in the spirit and that's the way it is to all believers they are mystics and he said the people don't understand because they live in a world to themselves and jesus lived in a world that nobody else could touch the disciples couldn't understand him and when he spoke to them they they say this and they said that this is why you talk like in riddles he said we don't understand this how can this be and so when a man lives by faith walks by faith substance faith is isolated from the entire world i trust we have that faith so that we are totally separated unto the lord totally separated onto the resurrection totally separated to the rapture we are spiritual not religious spiritual by the holy ghost if you're spiritual god is catching us up with the revealed word for this hour luther for his day wesley for his day the pentecostals were their day and us for this hour the bride this is a bright age not a pentecostal age it's a bright age amen and brother he said when a man lives by faith walks by faith and i mean substance faith he is isolated from the entire world and becomes a new christian a new creature in christ now he said there now you're getting into bride material you're getting into a rapturing condition and that means for each one of us amen not just the pastor not just the deacons or the trustees that means for the laity and he said every individual walks in a world with god alone and you're baptized into this kingdom and there's nobody in there but you and god he gives the orders and you pack them out whatever god says there's not a shadow of doubt anywhere you walk right on if the lord says this there's nobody in the world can talk you out of it amen he said you're coming into that perfect faith perfect perfection that cannot fail that faith never fails yes he was a mystic to them with his perfect faith and so it is now with those who have perfect faith are a mystic to others amen and we are taught to resist the devil and he will flee from us resist is to just simply turn him down amen and that is to just walk away from it amen faith believes that god will work it out i don't know how long he's going he's going to do it he'll do it anyhow amen because what faith will master all circumstances amen that's the truth that's right sister and he said have faith and love is real relations because you can't have faith unless you got love because your faith is in a god who is the very essence of love faith and love works together amen brother there's many with faith but they don't have laws that's the truth and brother if you've got love you're going to show it well brother if you got it it's just automatically going to express itself yeah not just natural law the spiritual law praise the lord remember again that jesus said if you say to this mountain be moved don't doubt he said but believe that what you said will come to pass you can have it amen that puts you back in the word now he said that's not skim milk he said it puts you back i know it's going to jump over the top of you here because he said it can't anchor because but he said real genuine faith catches that right now amen he said oh where should we be there's perfect faith no vision just speak the word never saw the squirrel he just said the scriptures what it was he said speak the word and that prophet spoke the squirrel into existence he says speak it don't doubt he said and i took god at his word amen i have to try to amen let me finish this message with this quote listen he said this is now coming into that third poll amen he said i'm working out something it's taking this charge of faith and going right back to begin and come in to kind of raise faith listen he said to kind of raise faith in a bracket where you have never noticed it that way before so where's our faith has our faith increased not just the revelation of this doctrine or that doctrine but the faith to believe and claim what god is doing listen he said not a faith but a perfect faith and he said watch a perfect god with a perfect heart keep a perfect promise by his perfect word amen which is sharper than a two-edged sword and a deserter of the thoughts of the heart and he said we are coming now to the perfection because the people as to come to this in order for the rapture so have we come and are we coming to that perfection perfect faith that you're living for god you're living you love the lord he loves you and you just live for him and your son as sons and daughters were led by his spirit he controls you he's controlling your love your your life is controlling your job he's controlling your actions and reactions with family and friends and neighbors you see god in control family friends and neighbors are not dealing with mom and dad brother sister cousins uncles and aunts they're dealing with jesus amazing dealing with jesus he said we're coming now to that perfection because the bible has to come to this in order for the rapture amen so have we got that perfect faith for the rapture and that's what's holding it away right now is waiting for that church to come to that perfect raptured faith we're still here because god's waiting i don't think the bride's gone if the bride's gone why am i still here if the bride's gone why are you still here i'm looking for it it means a lot of shaking down for me and it means a lot of shaking down for you but together we'll make it by the grace of god amen and he brings his message to a close and he said don't you love him and he said right now already begin a work in your body of your healing because that he promised it would happen and he said he said listen did you catch what i was saying tonight he said have you got the riddle of it he said if you say to this mountain don't doubt but believe amen he said i'm your brother standing as your brother an intercessor and i'm trying my best to hold you before god and i'm standing here right before the white throne he said pointing my finger to that bloody sacrifice and speaking through his name that it is done grace to perfect faith amen there's still some thoughts here that i've never expressed concerning faith amen maybe we'll do that another time we'll see as the lord leads but just to share this with you that the prophet preached 23 sermons on the subject of faith 23 and the last sermon was perfect faith no the last sermon he preached on faith was november 1965 and it was entitled works is faith expressed so does your works reflect your faith amen and what is your faith expressing now it's not just going to church but again is it in your job in your home in your in your relationship with family friends and neighbors you're expressing faith amazing absolutely amazing in 1965 before the rapture message the prophet referenced faith 36 times after the rapture message he referenced faith only six times from 1963 to 1964 amen he spoke of faith 1610 times that was from 1963 and 1964 just two years before the opening of the seals in 1962 he referenced faith 1297 times amazing so is not i would say it is normal to preach on faith if he highlighted faith faith faith faith so often amen just think 1961 amen let's see oh no through his entire message he emphasized oh yeah through his entire message he preached and emphasized faith 1610 times amen in 1961 just 94 times in 1960 almost 900 times amen that he preached faith god help us brother to put the emphasis on faith as much as the prophet did faith faith faith amen just think that he emphasized emphasize emphasize faith thousands and thousands and thousands of times in his ministry god help us brother i pray grace that we have the faith that pleases god amen and the question is do you control faith or does faith control you there are many that control faith but how many let faith control them so that you're going to live by faith by the grace of god amen praise the lord so many thoughts faith is a revelation of how what and how god wants us to do it amen by grace the first message that the prophet recorded on faith is entitled faith is the substance 1947 and the last recorded message on faith is works is faith expressed november 1965. god help us to have the faith that pleases god let's make our calling and election sure let's make sure we have the faith that pleases god god bless you
