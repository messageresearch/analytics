what you are doing father the revelation of the resurrection the revelation of the rapture the change of our bodies receiving a body like your glorified body hallelujah praise the name of the Lord I trust Lord a it is more real to us than the natural things of this natural life Amen father that we are hungry and thirsty for the reality of the spiritual hey and hallelujah by the name of our Lord

see what we see it is the grace of God we know what we know it is the grace of God that we have what we have a man the Blessed hope with full expectation of fulfillment praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen now I believe all things are possible [Music] possible [Music] possible [Music] they might praise the name of the Lord turn with me to Romans chapter 12 the book of Romans chapter 12 they have already read it in a previous which on this subject but it'll be a blessing again a man Romans 12 and beginning to read again at verse 16 be of the same mind one toward another a man and mind not I things naturally but condescend to men of low estate and be none wise in your own conceits a man be nigh wise in your own conceits but let's be wise in our Lord Jesus Christ have his wisdom and it says recompense to no man evil for evil see again confirming what we have ministered concerning keeping your attitude right and your spirit right a man so recompense to no man evil for evil but provide things honest in the sight of all men and the right attitude and a right spirit a man and if it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with all men a man that takes the grace of God that takes that takes again the the attributes of an overcomer so if it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with all men amen you're going to do what God wants you to do you're going to do what God has enabled us to do but if there's no peace then maybe it's them not you because you have gone beyond to make peace it's their choice to accept it or to reject it amen but we will still live peaceably with all men and verse 19 dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give place under wrath for it is written vengeance is mine I will repay say the Lord a man therefore if thine enemy hunger feed him a mayor brother this is tremendous god help us now i do unto others as they do to us but do unto others as jesus has done to us amen praise the name of the lord so he said if if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head amen and it says be not overcome of evil but overcome evil with good a man the grace of God that will not be overcome of evil but overcome evil with good a man by the grace of God and the good is the word of God god bless you may be seated and turn with me to Revelation chapter 3 and again we have read this but I want to read it again with another thought Revelation chapter 3 and verse 21 to him that overcometh and our thought as men and is the message how can I overcome there is a reason that God has laid this message on the prophets heart at some time ago I did give you a quote where their private Oh God summarized the message summarized why he was preaching it and this sorry to his own church and as I have already highlighted allow me to do it again then he saw the need in his own church for this message because there was many a professing believer in Brenham tabernacle there was not an overcomer a man the Prophet was recognizing that the enemy was overcoming them but they were not overcoming the enemy then the the world and the flesh and the devil was overcoming them but they were not overcoming the world or the flesh or the devil brethren we're going to be victorious and we're going to hear whether what the Bible is promised that we're going to inherit as conquerors a man as / as well as overcomers we have to have the testimony and the witness in our lives that we are overcomers and that we have overcome you're going to have their witness need that witness within you that you have overcome the world and you're going to live that life showing that you have overcome the world you're going to live the life showing that you overcome the flesh amen this is from this is a tremendous challenge to our faith and again you read then you have to go forth and live the life there so that you have overcome the devil Amen brothers with anything anything and that God has blessed us with is the victory over the world the flesh and the devil why because to an arat and here are the blessings too good to go from time to eternity a man to go out of this body need a glorified body we have to overcome the world the flesh and the devil a man there is no other way out brothers but so our Lord that gave it gave us the victory he made bike buddies by grace through faith amen to give us the victory over the world the fleshly devil so that we could experience a man and the mother not not just on the role but to experience it now to experience the resurrection and the rapture praise the name of the Lord as it is written in the word in Ephesians there you and he quickened you as resurrected you as he made alive who were dead in sins and trespasses I am if I if I got an experience with God if I got an experience with Jesus I have been resurrected any man and I am resurrected and I'm going to be resurrected a man with the dead in Christ by the grace of God and knowing that I have been raptured because the Bible says again in Ephesians 2 that an ISA we have been caught up into heavenly places in Christ amen in Christ Jesus and that is where the word is being revealed praise the Lord so I have experienced that spiritual resurrection I have experienced a spiritual rapture there brother sister that Alleluia amen I am in contact with God not in my head and not in my mind no no no but in my soul and I have been radford in my soul hallelujah the resurrection the rapture is is in my soul it is on the inside of the inside amen and our brother never was bringing those also concerning the emphasis that he was putting on the the prophetic ministry and in the office of a prophet a man and he was highlighting something that the prophet had already explained to us and came out of us still here no and he drew it on the board there and I and I have also drawn it on the board and the part of God he did draw it on a board but he did draw it on a large weight sheet of paper in Brenham tabernacle amen and we enter our labor day we are we are a we are as God is manifested in a three-fold manner so we're also manifested in a three-fold manner God is really as a father a son and the Holy Ghost amen but yet it's just one God amen and we and you and I we have it where we had the three three natures as there were three senses the deal with and it what is it is the soul or they are you not your spirit it is your soul amen that's on the inside of these and then it is the human spirit and then we have to deal with the flesh a man so when we were born when we were born then naturally a man there was a worldly nature on the inside of the inside a man Satan and the anointing on the inside of the inside and it controlled our spirit and it controlled our flesh and we went out and we live like the world and and desiring the world and the things of the world a man that's what we were living for but when you were born to gain the prophet of God said he said they said the Holy Ghost goes into the soul the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul amen and we are and what is that it is that is the anointing resurrection anointing you are they quicken not in our flesh not in our spirit but in our souls a man and he does it in our soul to control our spirit and through the spirit to control the flesh amen so there the Spirit is going to come sunny to the Holy Ghost in the soul amen and then the flesh a man this clay is in a battle we're in a war with you with the human spirit and they in the flesh amen the anointing of the Holy Ghost in the soul is moving into your spirit and to control your flesh to control the thoughts and the feelings said the enemy is trying to get us a focus on naturally a man but brother they were born to gain we're gonna focus on and we're gonna focus on what's on the inside of the inside we're going to focus on the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost we're gonna focus on the Word of God we're going to focus on the promise of God we're gonna focus on the will of God not my real fathers now you be done by the grace of Almighty God but there are too many today that are still walking in and doing what they want to do but not what God wants to do amen there still is still subject to the Satan's influence in the flesh and in their spirit there's a battle here a man God is ready to get into your spirit and control your flesh and the devil is in your flesh a man fighting to get into your spirit and to control your soul hey man hey man brother he was tempting Jesus when Jesus came in in in the flash called the Lord Jesus Christ and he went to the Mount of temptation and there was the devil a man so sane was there tempting Jesus and Satan as they uses our flesh to tempt God Satan is using our flesh to tempt us hey man but if we're born again brother is not is not me that he's dealing with it's God it is Jesus instead he's feeling with a man that the part of God said remember he said it's not having the anointing out here it's not having the anointing in your spirit he said we've got to have the anointing in our souls he says got to be on the inside of the inside a man - many have experienced God in their flesh and they think they're saved but they're not a man and give them the trade give to the witness of the word and they'll reject this let me check that because they feel they don't need to do this they don't need to do that because I feel God in my say my flash I've experienced God in my flash well that's good but if he doesn't get into the soul we're still we're still dead in the eyes of God wish that were unrighteous in the eyes of God because God is looking into the soul amen God wants to get in there amen the imputed righteousness of God is not in our flesh a man is if it's not in our spirits it's in our souls anybody by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen and it's the Holy Ghost are they on the inside of the inside amen what's he doing he is making the word flesh a man in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us a man a man and he did what he wanted to do so that he the life of that body could come back to you and me man so that he that he would be able to get in you and me and doing you and me what he was doing in the flats called Jesus hey man brother hey brother sister what was it it was Reza it was the resurrection and the rapture ain't a victory over the world the flesh and the devil this is what Jesus come to do that's what Jesus come to prove and that's what Jesus come to share with us a man victory over the world the flesh the devil amen so that we'd all had we'd all had an eternity a man on the inside of the inside a man he came from eternity a man the thing of it is he didn't bypasses theophany but we did because of our natural bird we bypassed earth a harmonie and we ended up and born in sin sheep didn't dig where they come to the world speaking lies but Jesus was born without sin a man he knew no sin but yet he was tempted at all points I guess we are a man brother they waited it wasn't the Prophet does bring it out here concerning what Jesus endured and what Jesus went through and but he was he was a conqueror he was an overcomer a man by the grace of Almighty God for your sake and for me hey man so I go share with us the life that he had a man and brother they they they're they've accused Jesus of this that accused Jesus of that and and so on and he and you know why they're the accuser you know they're accused Jesus of being gay why but they they they portrayed that any in Hollywood and that was that was in a film because and they use scripture oh yeah they didn't just accuse him whether with or without this or without that they they went to that went to the Bible said what did you read this in the Bible did you read this they were named one of them one of the Gospels and what it was was that when I believe it was when Jesus was being betrayed into the hands of the sinful people in shawnee there and they were taking Jesus away that this young man came and he ran through the group the ran through the disables and so on and he was naked anyway naked and they they were they rose just shocked and amazed and so in the movies and in Hollywood they they they sort of won't want to indicate that was that was a sin that Jesus was guilty off and so on brother he was going to be naked but not for that reason he was going to be naked a man and he was naked on the cross a man but he did it for your sake in my sink a man they took all of our sins a man a brand ASA Father forgive them for they know not what they do and brother's not just that not just the ones that were done at the foot of the cross it wasn't just the soldiers it wasn't just the scribes and the Pharisees father forgave them as me and you say God amen he was laying down his life for you even lay down his life for me but it wasn't them he said no man takes my life from me I lay my life down and he said I'm gonna pick it up a man brother who crucified Him it was well then like it like I said about brother Peregrine when he went and looked by winning walk past the mirror and and he looked at it a bear he saw I saw the way and that crucified my Lord amen amen you want to know you want to see who crucified the Lord well look into the next merrier you you may be out there somewhere in the church look into the mirror amen and you see the person that crucified the Lord hey man we brother he came and he laid his life down and he didn't lay it down for the devil he didn't lay it down brother and therefore this the absolute just children of the devil serpent seed he laid it down for the seat of God he laid it down for the sons and daughters of God that he knew a man would come into the world burned in sin he knew a man he knew those they had the seat of God in their hearts a man the seed was there but it need to be watered a quicken a man so that it would bring forth his life it would bring for the resurrection bring for the rapture bring for the the power of God amen and reflect God in this body of flesh amen brother but everybody had to get here to do you had to do it in such a way so that he could come into our souls not just give us an experience in our flesh brother when Jesus was there in the flesh by the scribes the Pharisees the disciples and many Jews they they they had an experience in their flesh they would feel this and feel that oh boy because of the power of the anointing that was in the body called Jesus amen brother it was Almighty God it made flesh in that body brother brother any of you have you had any sense of God at all than you you were going to you go to sense God amen sure you since God some power or some anointing you know there from that other dimension and here here it is in flesh the fullness of the Godhead bodily was in the body called Jesus now he said that the prophet said the foolish legardie body is in the brain Amen praise the name of the Lord and brother listen what he did he lay down his life and picked it up again so I tell you this the fullness of the Godhead body in the bride she lays out her life and many millions are laid it down physically a married but there's a bride that we all laid out spiritually hey man because because there there is the elect of God when it comes to when it comes to the Jews the prophet of God brings it out in this message right here and he said they said there is the many call few chosen and he said there there there's the Jews he said that are elected and then there are there other Jews that are still saved he said but he said they didn't all come up in the resurrection when Jesus came up and Bible says many but not all a million and they went into the city and appeared on the many a man and the bodies of this one the body without were they rose from the dead but not all of them the power of God said no no he said they're waiting for the general resurrection Amen the same thing with the Gentiles and he said they said a the resurrection of rapture he said there's going to be the elect of God he says going to be resurrected and the living Saints go with them they're going to be changed and we're going to be raptured a man but he said again he said the there there's going to be many that won't be resurrected they're going to be they're going to be there he said waiting for a man waiting to the it's going to be at least a thousand years at the end of the other millennial reign amen because of a the old veil witness still witness the the the bride and the bridegroom a man coming together their witness may be the the rapture of the bride of the bridegroom amen but they'll they'll go back into another dimension hey man the Bible said the rest of the Dead lived not again for a thousand years and so on by their they'll be there they're going to leave and they're there right there they're right there in Revelation and the Bible says you know they're like their God compares their lives for the to the word and the word that they knew what was revealed to them and so on and they are given eternal life and if they're now if their life didn't didn't measure up to the word that God had revealed to them and they had rejected the word they're cast into the lake of fire a man but they're the bride and the bridegroom is there a man doing that amid that judgment so brother it is a tremendous revelation that God has given us and God is giving us in these last days but I pray God in the name of Jesus that we're seeing what God wants us to see and that we are doing what God wants us to do amen that we are reflecting hey man this the spirit that he has come back with a man to the resurrection the Rajshree spirit amen so therefore but what for to resurrect us to rapture us amen in the in a boy what is it it is the end of time it is the end of the natural things a man and it is eternity taking over a man we're going back to eternity again hey and what is God doing in this hour of this age through the Ministry of a prophet he's making an end of time hey man we know that all over in a way and all that's over hey man but it is the end of time not judge not just the end of the the load of C in church a that is the end of time not just the end of this from the end of that it is the end of time oh well wait a minute brother there's got to be the the juice yeah but it's that's only three to half years that's only a snapping in God's mind

already - brother oh my oh my oh my I don't know if you noticed it within the last three or four days but I understand that the there was a gentleman that was challenging the Prime Minister of Israel to to run Israel based on spiritual a man based on the biblical spiritual things of God and he said he would be there that's was something that he was not going to do that he was not going to run Israel he was not going to rule Israel a man when a car guy cording to the biblical standards no no but anyway he was going to do what he buddy felt they they they're the people in Israel wanted done amen that's why politicians here are doing and the politicians in the world are doing they're doing where did you just to get the other to get the support of the majority of sinners and unbelievers and so on out there amen they're not going to do what pleases you or me and not know but not by any any any means they're going to do what pleases the majority so that they're going to be recognized by the majority they're going to be elected by the majority so the Prime Minister leaders lady wasn't going to he was religion control is is-is-is rulership brother but God is already moving in Israel amen that event that is evidence right there that God is already on the move in Israel hey man when when you consider that the leader is going to take a stand or for it or against it hey man you know that something is going on that god I told you about those those young young men that went beyond the curtain of time just rip maybe three or four years ago and they had experiences they saw this they saw that they experienced this from them and it was true it was amazing and then having the experience they were interviewed by by the Levites today by the priests the Jewish priesthood tell us what you saw tell us what you felt tell us what you saw what your what you were seeing what do you think it was all about a million and there were many there that were sitting all around listening to their testimony amen and there's Christians in Israel today that are that are witnessing to the Jews concerning the Lord Jesus Christ amen concerning the new the New Testament amen and the part of God brings it out here and how can I overcome brother he goes B goes right on back to there to eternity he comes right on down into time he comes right up through the Old Covenant of the Old Testament a man and the old recovers there and he comes on into the New Covenant and the New Testament amen and he said there there are those that are again we referred to though they'd the elect and the very elect amen many are called pure chosen but he said again the called are not lost amen whether whether you're looking back here in the Old Testament concerning the Jews or whether you're looking concerning the Gentiles oh but God has been doing the last two thousand years amen old brother these are tremendous gone again and again we go back that in the beginning God at a plan God at a purpose and God pattern anybody but there are very very few that really got the revelation of God's plan not many got a revelation of God's pattern now many got a revelation of God's purpose why God did this why God did that preferred for years as a question many believed over God did this that God did that and then the devil come in and did this and they leave the impression that God didn't know God didn't know this was going to happen God didn't know that was going to happen but God knew it all amen God knew everything from the beginning to the end amen God knew no knew what the devil was going to do God knew what Adam and Eve was going to do God knew what even the cameras gonna do God knew hey man well Enoch was gonna do what it what it would Noah was going to do amen and right on down to this hour and to this age right here and he knows what you're going to do and what this one is going to do that one's going to do well the churches are going to do and God knows what the Jews are doing I'm going to do amen brother I pray God in the name of Jesus all brother I tell you it's going to take faith and then absolute faith but not just on the feeling in your body not a feeling in your spirit but a revelation in your soul amen HK brothers could take faith because why we're going beyond feeling amen brother Paulo God say what you're worried about your faith declares it more real than what your site tells you amen and was your faith revealed is more real to you than what your set senses tell you what you what you're feeling brother I'll tell you this I can't a lot like I said I can't explain it the bullet you've got dying a little taste it not something on the inside the inside what it is but just it's just a power it's just an anointing amen really it is the life of Christ in us the life of the blood in us a man amen brother if we're to be overcomers where he's got to be on the inside of the inside brother ek II can annoy our flesh but we're not going to overcome the world and the things of the world amen even are we going to experience the unity of God in in our spirits and we might be a little bit more religious and even a little bit a little bit spiritual but not again not not be not truly born again no no the new birth comes only when the when the light comes into the soul any night when the life of Christ where the Holy Ghost goes into the soul to quicken the seed of God amen anyone now we're born again Alleluia we were dead in sin and he resurrected us a man and we were we were but we were put away because of that seed but then he ruptured us by the power of the Holy Ghost so that we'd have fellowship a man in another dimension by the grace of God brothers sister if we're to overcome it's got to be guarding in the soul amen you could have got again you could have God in your flesh and go to hell you're going to have God in your human spirit and go to hell you're going to have God in your soul but then God in the Solow controls your thoughts your feelings your motives your objectives what you're living for and how you live amen brother they bring no matter what you do you know they don't mean you're evil you're not going to do wrong sometimes but if you know you're going to be convicted oh yes most everything you're going to be convicted no matter no matter no matter how small the thing you're going to do I bet we think it's going to be a big thing sometimes it might be a big thing sometimes it might be a small thing but everybody getting together Holy Ghost there's a conviction amen and you would have no rest no peace until you have made it right with God that is right amen there's not area you can't you want to go there and just do this and do this and and then not bother you normally will bother you amen - if we're overcomers you get you're in a battle you gotta fight the battle and win win the battle by grace to overcome and the Bible said we are more than conquerors anyway they were more than conquerors were overcomers amen we're over covers why because Jesus conquered the world the flesh the demo Jesus conquered for else death hell of the green amen amen praise the name of the Lord so called Elvis brother see in Revelation chapter 3 there that is it tells us that Jesus overcame a man in verse 21 to him that over a comment to him yes he said when I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame a man Jesus overcame for you and he's going to she's going to share that overcoming power and anointing with you amen when you receive him you accept him they receive and accept this word and you repent amen repent and rather not repent in your head repent in your soul amen it's a hunger and if you're a seat of God it's a hunger to thirst on the inside of the inside and you repent and you're baptized because you want to identify with his death burial and resurrection and in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and yeah and you were to read you were to repent amen to be born again and went home when you and when you repent and you're about twice the father God said he said no he said that's your two steps he says the third step is God's amen but he said it's God recognizing your faith amen it is God responding to your faith I pray God has responded to the faith of every one of us here amen amen amen I trust God has responded in your faith that God has responded to my faith and by the way what is his response it is the baptism of the Holy Ghost anybody repentance is me the Holy Ghost by a man I trust as the Holy Ghost in me getting me to repair and it's a Holy Ghost repentance it is it is the word repentance it is virtual repentance amen so body or spirit oh god I was born in sin as David repented amen so brother I'm going to repent and then I go out and I acknowledge my faith in the Lord Jesus Christ in his death and burial is resurrection and I get this brother - put me down and bury me and day in the water and then I resurrect amen brother we we died and we're resurrected amen but now we need to be raptured amen you know wonders with our Lord Jesus Christ and into eternity and for that he's got to be eat eat God's got to send us all respond to our faith and give us the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new birth now there was a time this is why I feel there has to be a ministry you know there is a private event has to be a ministry receiving the word of the Prophet and expounding it to the Saints amen because prior to the only of the sea was a part of God say when you repent and they get baptized you're a born again amen but know after the Ovilus SEALs he changed it and he said no he said the new birth is the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen it is God responding to your faith amen amen amen and yet there's so many that thing I believe the message and I repented and I've been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you got the Holy Ghost as God responded to your faith amen and give you the Holy Ghost so that you become absolutely a new creature amen pair to the old creature that mom and a mother dad gave birth to a man are you a new creature amen brother God changes your your-your-your not your mind nothing of that Europe that's still interested in a central body God is going to change throughout the anointing in your soul hey man God goes in there any water waters to seed and the seed breaks in it against it and comes forth acknowledging God amen and God waters it and you will you believe this God waters it more and it comes forward you believe this you believe this amen and brother look what we're believing as God continued to water to see down through the ages amen hallelujah now it's bringing forth absolutely absolutely a glorified body baby brother it's like you say you plant the seed and you water it and then and then is its it pops up don't-don't-don't destroy the seed no no as something I have to preach on to I preached on some years ago now we did there's a generation is getting older and needs it yeah so you've got a water receipt and the water is the word amen and the water the seed and the seed at the seagulls oh we think all deceased is Ronnie yeah but got to it's got to soar their life on the inside is going to come out there is life on there do you go out there and find the seed there's a life on the inside of that seat water it put you've got to be in the right conditions the right atmosphere the right things around it amen gotta be watered with the right kind of water hey man and then all of a sudden it looks like it's getting wet and it's starting to rot but then all of a sudden something it'll sprout out of the seed and it'll come up oh is that all no you keep watering it and their leaves their branches comes on it it goes up higher more branches more branches more branches brother it's right there in Matthew 13 Jesus talks about in in the parable amen there are those that don't bring forth nothing with that they're cut off and they're burned amen but he's gonna even water it water till it brings forth not grafted in it comes to the churches and all of that no no but the sons and daughters of God bring forth the seed of God the the flower of God the fruit of God amen brother if you've been born again you're gonna bring forth the nature of God anybody your natural birth brother your sister you're dealing with your innate the nature of your your natural parents a man but in our spiritual birth we're dealing with the nature of all right our Heavenly Father amen you're gonna grow your now now that you're born together you're gonna think like him and hacked like him talk like him amen live like him that's right oh yes that old nature is still there but the new nature on the inside is like a-- is white got control amen brother sister I pray God that it didn't that you've been born again amen and the life you live pose that you're living the born to gain life amen that now you're born did it's the nature of the Holy Ghost it's the nature of God in you it's the nature of Christ and your brother you're going to have the nature of Christ you're going to have the attitude of Christ you can add the actions and reactions of Jesus old brothers is a tremendous challenge to our faith to have the love that Jesus had to walk in the light as Jesus deep to make the sacrifices that Jesus made amen - to be content as Jesus was content with the natural things of life brother-sister we going to take his advice if you're born again you'll take his advice but there's not many believers are taking the advice or in the counsel of Jesus no no there's dears joke because the wise because they're not born again they're still governed by the natural things of life oh yeah prophet of God aside I did those things and he highlighted you know where we put so much emphasis on vitamins and things like that they were starting back then in the in the early 60s yeah and he preached on some vitamins Bible vitamins and I sure what the ones he used you might have used the vitamin F faith you know and the but this vitamin that vitamin this is what we need amen the Holy Ghost and so on Gospels yes brother he said if he said if I had no he said I had pills he said that and he said that I said nowadays you take these pills that you'll be you be healed he said oh they wouldn't have room up there for the for the prayer line issue did all come all to get one of those pills but he said I'll give you the Word of God there were these stripes you are healed and that's the gospel but they won't take that one they'll take it in their head but they want to take it in the heart and if it's in the heart it'll control you it'll control your attitude your spirit regarding all the rest amen amen because our faith is in on the inside of the inside it is not what we're feeling in our flesh during our spirit it is what we have in our soul a man by the grace of Almighty God god help us brother are we overcomers yeah I don't mean to overcome your church the church you were in somebody get here or the church that I was in it and this and that and something else no and you really overcome yourself the power of God said Esther that when it comes to overcoming he said that's that's the that's the number one that you've got to overcome yourself yeah you got to overcome your thoughts your feelings your emotions so that why if you're over you overcome that your being going to be governed by they Christ in you know you're going to have his thoughts his ideas his feelings his actions his reactions are you Christ in flesh when it comes to your actions today when it comes to your reactions today was it Jesus or was it the the son or daughter that was born in sin and not born again if you're born again again it comes right back to that what what we've said so often it's not me that lives is Christ at everything hey man and brother were not just talking spiritual when I just talking when it comes to their you know going to church and believing this and believing that and believe in this doctrine this doctrine this theology that's the elderly no no if you're born again is Christ living in you is Christ reacting is Christ talking amen so as not me lives as Christ living in me thought word and deed hey man brother sister god help us see again I like they're like the brother that I don't know where it was true they vision of the dream and he was going to go mode to get we're going to heaven going into enter into the city and the angel asked him the password or something like that and oh well I believe Luther no that's not where the were not that's not not it I believe this and I believe that oh no no go over there think about it and they would say this to say that but the door never opened oh he said no that's not right and ah finally a boy came up and boy stood before the angel and the angel asked him where his faith was he said me my faith he said I trusts in the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ he redeemed me and the angel didn't have to say anything or do anything to gain automatically open and he went the others were focusing on doctrine and this teaching and that teaching this one but none of them confessed the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ amen no don't confess the finish work of Calvary amen brother that's what it was all for so that God could respond to our faith repenting baptism and give us the Holy Ghost that we'd be borned again now we're going to go forth as the sons and daughters of God amen now we're going to go forth as overcomers amen because we now in Christ we are more than conquerors why because he said right here to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sit down with my father in Israel he overcame now he wants us to overcome he over come and sit down with his father in his strong and the prophet of God I lighted it he said now he said we're not going to sit on the throne we're going to sit in the throne it's in the hour of judgment amen praise the Lord so brother's sister he overcome so that he could come back to you and me in a new birth born begin if you're born again you're an overcomer if you're a religious you're not an overcomer well here just caught up with doctors of theology in your head or feelings that in your flesh or in your human spirit you're not an overcomer the overcomer is Christ he's Christ oh Christ you sure yeah buddies he's known as this brother this sister this had this daughter brothers sister it's like just recently you know here in Newfoundland that two old men just break just realized that they were brothers and it was decades it was years that they were separated they are under different names until finally something came up that somebody else started and and there and they began to search it and and and and and look for it this information this information to finally discovered that their brothers yeah there's a picture of the mum on the on the internet news amen and they never they thought well we don't look look look look the same but they did say they had dead same actions you had to save reactions and so on and any any motion and so on by the sister we might look different but if we're all born again we got the same nature everybody they had the same nature they said there's something what's going on here this MIT really must be the truth is that you're related and they are they discovered it and I think one come from Switzerland somewhere I was in Switzerland a man and there so they traced everything back to do for the land yeah his brother I trust that we regard to where we're from naturally we can trace it all back to each other eternity amen that you're a son of God you're a daughter of God amen we are brothers and sisters of like precious faith we come from eternity we're going to eternity amen brothers sister we're on our way back to theophanies and in order are more important to us is the glorified body Wow how can I overcome that the overcomer have come and control the overcomer come in so that I'm born again by his nature by him by his Spirit in his life amen by the grace of Almighty God amen and the spirit and the bride say come she's an overcomer brother but brother bound preached this message listen we had to overcome the world the flesh the devil to experience the resurrection and the rapture there's no way we're going to be part of the resurrection rapture honest we are overcomers amen you have to overcome the world of flesh the devil and then we're ready for the resurrection in the rapture Amen brothers sister the grace of God help us and there's no and then no way are you an overcomer unless you're born again the prophet of God I'm gonna try to bring it to a conclusion he's a time in eternity will blend together when God and His people blends together not blame with the church no no we are one with one another we're borned again a man but the great oneness is our oneness with God amen and and you'll bring forward the nature of your heavenly Father and you'll be focusing on the nature of your heavenly Father you'll be thinking like your heavenly Father acting like you're having a father anybody hungry no thirsting for what he would on birthdays man amen when he was here oh my brother's sister Grace of God so that in the hour like Jesus one day on the Mount of temptation we're not gonna let the devil overcome us amen are you trying to overcome Jesus and get Jesus to do this get Jesus to do that focus on we under weaknesses of the flesh oh yeah Satan will focus on the weakness of your flesh well we got to be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might so we're not gonna we're not gonna focus on the weakness of our flesh or our human spirits or our feelings or our thoughts no no we're gonna focus on thus saith the Lord the word a man I'm when I'm going to stay with the word I'm going to stay spiritual I'm gonna walk with God I'm gonna do what God wants me to do when he wants me to do it where he wants me to do it how he wants me to do it amen yes grace grace grace grace it is the I'll tell you if you're born again you got the grace of God without measure everybody if you're born again the grace of God is there amen and what does grace provide the faith we need for this situation this situation that situation he gives us the faith we need to overcome to overcome the devil's temptations to do this to do that oh there's a need so what am I going to do well go with your soul not your mind cut the devil is going to go with your mind and your feelings and your senses and you'll try to persuade you to do this do this do this better take you away from God a man won't bring you closer to him but mother's sister just go by faith Lord what is it and you'll be a revelation in your heart that I I feel God want me to do this I feel God wanting to do that yes we're seeking the will of God in not yeah in every area of your natural life what is the will of God are you in the will of God Lord because oh brother sister were challenged to what we're jealous can we say what Jesus said not my will father die and be done or do we have our own thoughts about what we want to do how we want to do it when and where we want to do it and so on why we want to do it not my will father dying be done we come down to this hour we come down to these ages the end and and right now brother sister the whole world is a witness and a testimony to us that for the saints of God the next thing is the resurrection rapture so what is is that more important to you than the natural things of life or are we working are we working more and more on the natural things or we want to make sure that this is secure this is secured that's secure we're gonna have this we're gonna have this worked out that worked out are you focusing more on that than on the spiritual Oh Lord you you see this happening out there in the world you hear this is going on in the world Lord the resurrection Jordan it's the resurrection here now Lord the rapture Lord we go are we going to be caught up today in order we gonna be cut up within the next hour how many are how many are really only two thirsting to get out of here and into eternity how many like I said a lot of don't really don't want it they're not hungry for it they're not that thirsty port oh that's all right when I die I'll go to heaven that's like I said I got it my by over there some call it heaven I call it home and to elope he was just heaven it's just a nice place to go when you die but what of it when you but about right now our young sisters right here are young evening young brothers hey are you are you wanting to go into eternity and you wanted to go into glory you wanted to go into the kingdom of God listen Saints did this this is this is to be boring real boring compared compared to eternity oh yeah and you have you considered going to doing to into an atmosphere into a place where there is no sin there's no thoughts of sin there's no negative thoughts everything is positive everything is peaceful everything is love oh my my it's gonna be such no known no fighting you'll argue you know it's gonna be a wonderful place yeah grace but I'll tell you there's not many of this really got the revelation of the resurrection and the rapture this is something that they think will happen down the road but where we're seeing those things out there in the world and every time we see this we see this we hear this we hear the head who Laurie forgive me if any sin that I've done nor do I pray that you that I'm ready for the resurrection I pray Lord we're ready for the rapture oh lord please don't leave us behind the prophet of God said I hope he said when he comes he don't leave me behind and I believe and brother that's the attitude of the bride oh yeah we don't want to be left behind so we're on our guard we're on our toes and when we see this happening we hear this is going on that's going on we get more and more spiritual and we call on the Lord Lord don't leave please grace I read some of these things over before this was 19 August 63 he said I feel that that third pole is beginning to move you see it's within me now I want to pray for everybody the third pole was in brother Branham I trust the third pole is in us there at the faith for the resurrection the faith for the rapture brother what else is there to focus on I'll be honest there's nothing else left to focus on because everything everything has been done we're gone gone beyond the loud of seeing Church Shh we're in a bride age so what is the end of the right age the resurrection record so there's nothing else to focus on spiritually morning noon and night see God is gonna allow this to happen this happened naturally to us what for to get us to look up it gives me more conscious of the spiritual and less of the natural so he so I feel the third pole is beginning to move he said it's within me now I trust it's in you and in me amen and we're gonna pray for one another and I are praying for one another yes as we study this my purpose of this is just not to come to fellowship with you people which I love to do that and he said have I had a chance to do that I would come to your home shake your hand talk with you eat dinner with you he says set out under the shade tree and talk and fellowship but he said when we come here we are here for one specific purpose this is the house of correction amen not many want correction because it's a generation that does what's right in their own eyes that generation doesn't want correction and he said this is the house of correction listen this catch the revelation and be serious and sincere he said this is the throne he meant the throne the house of correction the throne this is the throne of God and judgment she goes forth from the house of God more serious than what people realize and he said here is where we come together gather in love with one another as only Christians can love and we are here to take reckoning among us to see where our short places are is God showing you your short places he said to see where our shortcomings and he said how can we catch from where we should be over to where we ought to be so your relationship with god you're here but God wants your year but you've got to have that hunger and thirst of that desire when you come in lord help me give me what I need and give me the strength I need the wisdom I need the revelation that I need Lord and the power to do what you want me to do amen and he said take reckoning among us to see where our short places are our shortcoming and now can we catch from where we should be over to where we ought to be now as I told you he preached this because of what he was seeing in Batam Tabernacle yeah they were getting tired of brother Branham preaching these things that's right and he said where to where our to where we ought to be and he said that's what we study he said many ministers study those places for their people so are we as spiritual as we ought to be do we think spiritual talk spiritual there was a generation that they absolutely didn't build spiritual well brother Brown was beginning to recognize even the older people in this day was losing their spirituality because he said it he said if those old folks he said lose it and drunk get dry he says gonna be bad you know and it is it is as I said the atmosphere is not like it used to be the anointing is not like it used to be we're at the end now toddled it got us a lot of it for a reason and he did say he did say if he didn't shorten time to be no flesh saved the Bible tells us to make our calling and election sure now it didn't say God was gonna do it you got to do it and God got to work with you and gotta be there to help you oh yeah but you gotta you gotta show your hunger and your thirst you gotta sure that you want to do it I think gotta be on the scene there to give you the strength and the wisdom you need praise the Lord so he administers study those places for their people and he said when they see the people their lack then they begin on that amen and that's why he said in this message he said I I know I stood at the end of the message there I read it he said I know what you're thinking brother branham much longer you gonna preach on this he said I'll preach it till you stop doing it amen he was what he was doing was trying to correct them and get them lined up for the resurrection into rapture now he says soon I think that the church maybe should be taking just a little step higher at this time blending into eternity let's take a step higher in the revelation of the word and let's get more spiritual unless carnal amen I want to bring the church he said just something that you should know I believe now amen and brother he went on to preach after this perfect faith the token desperation and souls in prison he's trying to get him to be more serious in their thinking yeah but more emphasis on the spiritual and less on the carnal and he said we're speaking on this overcoming and he said the word overcome you know what it means you have got to have something to overcome and the number one thing is yourself and the nature you're born with naturally yeah and this church age that the Holy Spirit was speaking about here had the loudest see in church age and he says we have just meant through it he said needed every bukey louder see you had to be rebuked because it's difference toward Christ to put Christ outside in their age and Christ was on the outside trying to get back on the inside he said that's love a man let's pray Christ is not outside of us but crisis inside of us it's Christ in us the hope of glory amen praise the Lord for Christ to live in you he's got to be he's got to be in you yeah by the Holy Ghost he said when he said I'll pray the Father give you another comforter and a lot of people think it's the third person of the Trinity the Holy Ghost no I said go on down he saw I pray the Father but the Holy Ghost and so on in John there but he said I won't i won't leave you comfortless he said I will come to you amen again I told you about the pastor of a church that wrote me and he said you brethren don't believe the Trinity but he said just 3:3 right here he said in John I think might be John 14 and he said just three right there he said Jesus and he said I'll pray the Father and he's gonna give him another comforter the Holy Ghost so he said that's three I said brother I wrote back to him I said brother you need to go down on another two or three for three or four verses I said Jesus said I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you and you'll know that I'm in the father the father and me I in you and you would be so I said Jesus and the father's one and the Holy Ghost are all one and and we're one with them so I said now where's your Trinity so he never responded I said I said brother I said it's warm but brother it's just the three offices of the one God everybody he did this to reveal his nature as a father he did this to reveal his nature as a son anybody and and what as your brothers your brother your brother and revealed to get us the revelation of broadbean brothers and sisters in a man I pray God looked we're not looking at this one looking at that one oh that's that's brother Alec he's from graph falls he's brother Cator son no he's not he's God son you know or a brother John's back here easy our brother and the Colombo's are they our family yes they are our family we're brothers and sisters in Christ he mean we got that we got the nature of our of our Heavenly Father hey man I trust ya I trust you because they Amanda then that you got the nature of your heavenly Father that I got the nature of my heavenly father in my soul and I concerned about my flesh is my soul but I tell you this it's Christ in us working on your spirit and my spirit working to what for to bring our flesh subject to the word yeah why that knowing one day this robot flesh shall drop in rice and seize the everlasting price and shout well passing through the air farewell farewell sweet hour of prayer but again if this time when I could be destroyed the one we're living in not sitting in not the pew at this tavern I could be destroyed we got one already waiting eternal in the heavens amen thank God he that liveth and believeth in me shall never die that's what Jesus said so I prayed we got that anointing in our souls we got that love in our souls it's defined it's eternal not natural hey there we go we're moving beyond the natural we're focusing on the eternal and the spiritual by the grace of God they're with me moment don't paw Christ outside of your life the churches that put them out but I trust that we haven't put them out of our lives don't put them out of your house no no no no not just Christ here in this church is crazy in you and it's crazy in your home by the grace of God Christ in your job he's Christ in your in your vehicle yeah you got to give preeminence to him and he said it was Christ on the outside trying to get back in the inside now I said that's love and the church itself in all that put him out but now notice is call here is not just the church he that overcometh not the church he said the church would be seen the church body but it's either overcometh the individual that will overcome a man and he said now he said we see knowing that this is the loudest see an age and knowing that this age needs a sharp rebuke from God it needs a sharp rebuke and when our clergy gets so soft and dhoti like some agent grandfather to his grandchildren he said has been said so much that God is so much it's such a good God until they make God just a dhoti Oh grandfather he said God's a good God but he's also a God of judgment a me and he said but he is not a donee Oh grandfather he said he is a father a father of righteousness of Correction and love is always corrective love corrects no matter how bad it hurts it's still corrects a real mother will correct her children a real dead will correct his children how does it finish there he said you take a Christian that's supposed to be a Christian he said led the life of God go from him and experience the joy of serving Christ and living in the church where such as going on he he will rotten twice as quick living right under it it's like the long he said that I saw he said outside the long looked good and he said look like a beach a big old beach slog and when I jumped on it Oh a great chunk of it fell off it was real rotten and dhoti and that's the way he said the Christians are becoming rotten and dhoti that's the way a lot of believers are becoming rotten and dhoti and he said they've been dead in sin and trespasses so long to become dhoti they can all no wait at all and he said they know what the overcoming means and then I began to think of this text overcome he's a keep life in you and he said when life went out that's what brought that log to that condition and it made it worse than ever when it laid in the branch where the water was a man you got to go forth and manifest the life of Christ in you it's not you'll become a rotten dotI believer he was not if it's just in your flesh or in your spirit your soul will become rotten but was in yer if it's in your soul then your spirit and your flesh becomes rotten and we're going to have a new body amen and then now you take a Christian that's supposed to be a Christian led the life of God go from him and experience the joy of serving Christ and living in the church where such as going on here odds twice as quick living right under it so here we are trying to follow the message of the hour or at least this part of the message we should live constantly in the life of Christ by again he's preaching to those in his own church that were not living the life of Christ he said don't you lay around and know these things that you're supposed to do and don't do it the Bible said he that know what to do good and doeth it not to him it's sin again not what you did do was what you didn't do people go to hell because of what they didn't do and as much as you didn't do it to the least of these my brother you didn't do it to me said Jesus so he said you go to the lake of fire amen stop and consider what you've done but consider what you didn't do that God wanted you to do God again hidden and revealed in simplicity and he said the person he said with that air that had hid her in nature he becomes Doty rotten when you're separated from the life of God so strive with all that's in you to stay in the life of Christ that you would be fruit berry a man grace of God he says the ending of time and the blending of eternity it is the greatest single age and there's more sin in this age than there ever has ever been and that's the truth what would he say today Alvis Ramos Ramos 60 years later brother there not many overcomers I trust by the grace of God that we are numbered among the few overcomers amen and that we're going to continue pressing on the upward way we're going to continue to press on press on into the kingdom of God press on to the resurrection and the rapture by the grace of that brother as I said what God reveals in the age that's what the people hunger thirst for so what's what's he revealed in this age resurrection and rapture amen the coming of the Lord for the bride to resurrect the bride rapture the bride for the marriage supper of the lamb and brother if there's anything we're hungry and thirsty for is the resurrection in the rapture and the marriage supper now definitely he said in another message he said he said God before he does this or does that he'll send the Holy Ghost ahead to create in the heart of the people a hunger for what he's going to do and he said then he's a bait then he said what are they doing they're calling for what he's going to do and then he said God is going to respond to the hunger and the thirst got to respond to the call amen so brother in this hour God is responding to the hunger and call of the bride for the resurrection rapture so how much emphasis are you putting in your life in your relationship with God in your experience how much emphasis are you putting on the resurrection rapture I've troubled are you with this world do you concerti what's going on in this world does as it increase your hunger and your thirst for the resurrection your hunger thirst for the rapture I want to get out of here well but what about this one what would that would you we're praying for that one who pleaded the token for that one amen Jesus went and did what he did listen Saints they're not gonna be lost if if they're predestinated no and they're not we lost sheet-like jesus said on the cross he said Father forgive them for they know not what they do amen all there was a lot they were doing many many many in his heart yeah then he was cursor over right from Genesis to Revelation amen but he knew that what he was going to do would give them the passport back into glory so I trust you got the passport amen amen you got the you got the yeah you got the official citizenship folder papers ayah your your your your citizen of that kingdom your citizen of the New Jerusalem yes I know our brothers here from Africa they after their hair well not only here there but there's many many many in Canada that after a certain pair time they're going to apply for Canadian citizenship well brother we hunger and thirst for the eternal citizenship of the heavenly kingdom and true they were born to get experience we get our citizenship recognition our passport into glory for the glory of God hallelujah so I trust my grace that you're thinking spiritual acting spiritual talking spiritual amen long in and thirsty for what God has revealed amen he said his birth when Jesus was born on earth he had a black mark to begin with he was always received by the common people and scorned mostly by the religious sect but by the great writ see and I mind the people in them days and it's just about the way today - - it's the same now as I'm trying to say that rich or rich see people cannot be saved if they'll humble themselves and come like the rest of us they can but we must all come in one way that's come knowing that we are nothing and he is all and being willing to surrender ourselves to him in order to receive benefits from him if you ever get anything from God he said you have to humble yourself and become nothing before him and know nothing but one purpose that is you're trying to find Jesus and then when you humble yourself down God will exalt you but when you exalt yourself God will see that you are brought to a base that's right he said so in his word so brothers sister not just humble yourself before the people that can be a put on a cloak yes but you humble yourself in your own mind in your own sight and in your heart persuaded that you are nothing less than a sinner saved by grace in the message wid three witnesses he said what is it friends Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever be humble let yourself be the lowest of all don't ever exalt yourself if you do you're going to become a beast humble yourself and God will lift you up don't figure that God owes you anything remember you owe him all and God's not under obligation to us we are under obligation to God love him with all your heart believe him and God will bless you amen god bless his word to our hearts amen to make our calling and election sure to make our overcoming faith sure that we have overcome the world the flesh the devil we have overcome all the influences of this life amen and getting preeminence to the hunger and thirst for the resurrection and rapture grace of God be with us amen be in prayer we will have to continue the thoughts on how can I overcome but the problem is going to focus on what you got overcome and then you'll focus on how can I overcome amen you got acknowledged first you got to acknowledge that you need to overcome yourself the flesh yes you need to overcome this spirit that spirit amen you need to overcome the devil because Satan is there with these thoughts all mine to try to get us to compromise but Christ is there by the Holy Ghost in your soul to get you to speak the word and rebuke the devil amen let's claim the victory of the finish work of Calvary for ourselves our relationship with Christ and let's claim the victory of the finished work of Calvary for the sick there's some honest a man come on let's believe it if if if if the message of the hour is giving us resurrection and rattray faith it'll give us faith to claim healing for our brothers and sisters please in the name of Jesus let's be serious let's be sincere with the word a man claiming speak the word the prophet of God preached the message why cry speak Amen God have mercy God help us please that you have God will give you the revelation of who you are amen the devil was tempting Jesus but Jesus overcame the devil but Jesus could have done exactly what the devil wanted to do but he didn't he didn't kneel to Satan he stayed with he stayed with the revelation of who he was and what he was ordained to do what he came to do so brother sister let's stay with the revelation of who we are and what God is expecting of us and why God is looking for in you and in me amen and he's not just looking for somebody believe the message no no he's looking for something that's going to live the message amen there's got to bring it bring it to pass and make make the word flesh what the resurrection and the rapture this there's nothing else left for the Gentiles nothing else left for the Gentiles only the resurrection rapture and God is holding us responsible amen god bless you let's stand there saying since Jesus came into my heart what a wonderful change in my life had been wrought since Jesus came into my heart I have a light in my soul for his long I had sought said Jesus came into my heart amen now

of churches this week and heard a lot of sermons and it seems to be it seems to be a continuity here but you were preaching and one of those heard preached they can ascend to the word and emphasis on Christ in the body Christ coming in me Christ coming in the body of Christ and that's that's what I saw there tonight and it was really encouraging because it seems like God is moving out of ministry to get the pride ready because there's very very little time left Amen there was an event that dead I spotted on one of the news websites it was reminiscent of World War two pre-world War two and that was that where the German government told the Jews in Germany not to wear those you know macaws because it was attracting attention from the radicals and people were getting attacked the Jews are getting attacked so the people of Jerusalem yeah I'm sorry of Germany were more on the side of the Jews they said we can't have that but it was a sign that something is moved that something that's getting ready that's just the way it struck me that it's closer than we think America said it in his prayer so it behooves us to ask God to pour his spirit eye on us and show forth his life in us I mean everything brother Gerald said everything that was said tonight and what we've heard we need we need more of him for sure let's ask him one more time pour your spirit on him let's sing the first
