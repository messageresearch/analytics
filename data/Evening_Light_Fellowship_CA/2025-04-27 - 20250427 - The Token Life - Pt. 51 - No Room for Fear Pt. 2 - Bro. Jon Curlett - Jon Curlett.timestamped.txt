[15:06] that
[15:07] again. Ask brother if you'd just come
[15:10] and open in prayer this morning. And to
[15:12] remember brother John, of course, as he
[15:14] brings the word of the Lord. And uh we
[15:16] pray for also brother Kingsley, sister
[15:19] Melody, and Kashi there. Uh he's they
[15:24] sent a note there to us and said
[15:27] that he's doing better. Kashi's doing
[15:30] better. Uh but he still has some skin
[15:33] reactions and it looks like possibly an
[15:36] allergy. So they're keeping an eye on it
[15:38] and uh he's improving daily and we're
[15:40] going to continue to pray that uh he
[15:43] improves 100%.
[15:46] So, I want to remember uh them today.
[15:48] And also, uh Sister Laura Snow, we just
[15:51] want to continue to pray for her full
[15:53] recovery. She's uh she's in a battle,
[15:56] but uh but God is the victor. So, and
[15:59] he'll give her the victory. So, let's
[16:01] just continue to pray for her and call
[16:04] on her faith.
[16:06] Uh also the Mandos uh called us and uh
[16:09] they wanted us to uh wanted me to greet
[16:11] the uh the church on their behalf. They
[16:15] still think of us. They still pray for
[16:16] us and uh assured them of our prayers.
[16:19] So just remember them. Brother Chad,
[16:22] Sister Lee, and and the family are not
[16:24] here as well today. U still in central I
[16:28] guess. So remember them. also was down
[16:30] to Adam last night and uh uh he had
[16:33] gotten his results from the MRI and the
[16:36] and the doctor told him that the uh the
[16:39] MRI was clean in the sense that uh
[16:42] everything is still in place as it was
[16:44] the damage to the spinal cord is still
[16:46] the same but not worse or anything like
[16:48] that and there's nothing more that they
[16:50] can do at that point. Um but uh the
[16:54] interesting thing is uh 7 years ago he
[16:57] had an MRI done and the MRI said that
[17:00] showed that he had uh arthritis and that
[17:03] it would get worse. U when he did the
[17:07] MRI this time no
[17:09] arthritis. So we thank the Lord for
[17:12] that. That's the God we serve. Just is
[17:16] just amazing. Adam has had his share of
[17:20] problems over the years and God has just
[17:22] brought him through every time. Amen.
[17:24] So, we thank the Lord for
[17:26] that. So, let's uh let's sing that. God
[17:29] still moves. Thank God he's he still
[17:32] moves among us. We need him all the
[17:34] time. Brother Vic will uh open in
[17:39] prayer. God still
[17:43] moves. Amen.
[17:46] God still
[17:48] moves.

[17:54] hearts of his
[17:57] people, God still
[18:01] moves.
[18:02] Amen. He does not
[18:06] sleep. Amen.
[18:09] Nor does he
[18:15] smile. God still
[18:18] moves.

[18:26] more. Oh, God still moves. Oh, praise

[40:51] marvelous. You are just
[40:55] beyond. Oh, just
[40:58] beyond the veil.
[41:00] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.
[41:04] Hallelujah.
[41:06] Thank you, Jesus.
[41:09] Just to
[41:11] see our beauty
[41:14] there, just beyond the veil.
[41:21] And
[41:23] beautyful you are.
[41:28] How
[41:29] beautiful you
[41:33] are.
[41:36] Beautiful. You are You
[41:40] are
[41:42] beautiful. You
[41:45] are. And you are the
[41:49] prince of all.
[41:52] Oh, you're the prince of peace.
[41:58] peace. You're the prince of peace. You
[42:05] are You're the prince of
[42:10] peace. Amen. Let's bow our heads.
[42:12] Heavenly
[42:14] Father, Lord, you are our Lord and
[42:17] Savior. Lord, you're our
[42:20] rest. Lord, our rock in a weary land.
[42:24] You're our shelter, our protector, our
[42:26] provider, our defender. Lord, you are
[42:29] the mighty conqueror this morning. Lord,
[42:32] we are so thankful for all that you
[42:33] bring to us. Lord, in ourselves, we know
[42:36] there's no good thing. We bring nothing
[42:37] to the table, Lord, but a yielded
[42:39] vessel, Lord, that your power could flow
[42:41] through us, Lord. We're thankful for the
[42:43] blood this morning. We're thankful for a
[42:45] word that washes and cleanses us, Lord.
[42:48] Lord, we're thankful for a God that
[42:50] stands behind what he says. Lord, that
[42:51] all your words are yay and amen. And
[42:54] Lord, as we bring this message this
[42:56] morning, Lord, we pray that it would be
[42:57] you, Lord. All of you, none of me. Lord,
[43:00] that you would speak to the people. You
[43:02] would speak to this body of believers.
[43:04] Lord, that you would touch our lives,
[43:05] our hearts, our souls. Lord, that you
[43:07] would engraft your word into our lives.
[43:09] Each one, Lord, that your life could
[43:11] flow through us in purity. We pray,
[43:13] Lord. Bless your people, Lord. those
[43:15] that aren't here, those that are
[43:16] traveling, those that are sick. Lord, we
[43:18] pray a special grace to them, each one.
[43:20] Lord, just be with us now. We ask in
[43:22] Jesus Christ's name we pray it. Amen.
[43:25] Amen. God bless you. Turn, if you would
[43:26] again, to First John 4 and 18. Amen. We
[43:31] want to remember young Kachi. He's still
[43:33] not feeling particularly well. He's
[43:36] home. Sister Melody's with him today.
[43:38] So, just praying God's grace to them.
[43:40] But we also have some good news.
[43:43] And remember, brother Grant made it
[43:44] through his exam week. We're trusting
[43:47] that he made it through his
[43:49] exams. But him and Sister Nikki have
[43:51] been trying to buy a house as as many of
[43:53] you know, it's been mentioned and
[43:55] they've had opportunities and lost
[43:56] opportunities and it looks like they
[43:59] have bought a house. So, we're just
[44:00] waiting for the paperwork and the the
[44:02] financing, all those final details. You
[44:04] know how it is to go through, but by
[44:05] God's grace, they'll have a house in the
[44:07] next month or so, I'm guessing. And so,
[44:10] we want to pray that that would just
[44:11] work out perfectly. that the Lord would
[44:12] take them all the way through, give them
[44:14] the desires of their hearts and settle
[44:16] them here. Certainly happy to have them
[44:18] amongst us. So, God bless you, brother
[44:19] Grandister Nikki. Congratulations, and
[44:21] just trusting the Lord to continue to
[44:23] bless and provide for your needs.
[44:25] Remember Biscuit this morning. We gave
[44:27] him a ham bone which he completely ate
[44:30] the bone, everything. And it's it's kind
[44:32] of wre havoc on his digestive system.
[44:34] So, Jonathan's with him this morning
[44:36] just to make sure that he doesn't
[44:38] destroy the house while we're gone. But
[44:39] uh just pray the Lord to help us get a
[44:41] get his digestive system back where it
[44:43] needs to be. So we don't have to worry
[44:45] so much. So and Blanca can get some
[44:47] sleep through the night from having to
[44:48] wake up and deal with that. So amen.
[44:51] Just remember that. 1 John 4:18, we're
[44:53] continuing from last service. And he
[44:56] says, "There is no fear in love, but
[44:58] perfect love casteth out fear because
[45:00] fear hath torment. He that fearth is not
[45:03] made perfect in love." Amen. God bless
[45:06] you. You can have your seats again this
[45:07] morning. And we're continuing this
[45:09] thought on on uh no room for fear. And
[45:12] we closed last service on that idea of
[45:14] how how God says something and then
[45:16] people take it and they expand it and
[45:18] they add to it and they magnify it and
[45:20] it becomes something that God never ever
[45:22] intended. And we spoke specifically
[45:23] about the Sabbath day. How God said you
[45:26] shall do no work on it. No surviile work
[45:28] is is really the phrase that that that
[45:30] is intended there. And we looked at what
[45:32] God said and he had four things. Four
[45:33] types of work that you weren't allowed
[45:35] to do on the Sabbath. who was carrying,
[45:36] burning, plowing and reaping. And then
[45:38] by the time Christ came that four had
[45:41] expanded to
[45:42] 39 God, man, God, man, God, men, God,
[45:48] religious people, God, people with good
[45:50] intentions, God, men trying to develop
[45:53] their own ministries with a particular
[45:54] flavor. And we see how we have that
[45:56] tendency as people as a as
[45:59] well-intentioned as as people that are
[46:01] are inclined toward the things of God
[46:03] that we can take things and we can
[46:04] magnify it and we can make something out
[46:06] of it that God never intended. And I
[46:08] said last service that we don't really
[46:09] know the motive or intention behind why
[46:12] they expanded this so much. Moses never
[46:14] did it. That's for sure. While the
[46:16] prophet was there, it was never a law.
[46:17] But yet after the prophet left, all of a
[46:19] sudden, people took that prophet's
[46:20] message and they started to turn it into
[46:22] something that it wasn't. And by the
[46:24] time Christ came, it had gone from being
[46:26] a message to being a game of spiritual
[46:28] oneupmanship and about a facade and
[46:30] about a presentation of a of certain
[46:32] values and these different things. And
[46:35] and Jesus came and he rebuked them. He
[46:36] says, "Listen, these these men are
[46:38] putting these these huge burdens on you
[46:40] and they're not even doing it
[46:41] themselves. In public, they do it. In
[46:43] private, they don't do it." He says,
[46:44] "They're hypocrites and they're binding
[46:46] the people in things that God never
[46:48] intended." And and like I said, if we're
[46:49] to give people the benefit of a doubt,
[46:51] maybe those those men, those ministers
[46:53] had the best of intentions, and they
[46:54] they were just trying to protect the
[46:56] people. They were just trying to keep
[46:57] the people from doing things that would
[46:59] potentially hurt them or have the
[47:01] outcomes that that they'd seen happen in
[47:03] those things. And there's nothing wrong
[47:04] with giving advice, church. There's
[47:05] nothing wrong with giving warnings.
[47:07] There's nothing wrong with having a
[47:09] reason not to do something. But you've
[47:11] got to make sure that there's the word
[47:13] and then there's reasons. And they are
[47:15] not one and the same. Listen, we teach
[47:17] our kids many things and we say this is
[47:19] what this usually leads to. That's why
[47:21] we don't do it. The word doesn't have a
[47:23] standard, but we don't do that because
[47:24] we've seen the fruit of that decision in
[47:27] many people's lives and and in the
[47:28] aggregate on on average it tends to go
[47:31] very poorly. That's why we don't do it.
[47:33] But it's okay to have good reasons. It's
[47:35] okay to have ideas. But the thing is
[47:37] that my experience may not be your
[47:39] experience. And your experience may not
[47:41] be my experience. You may be buil built
[47:43] differently than I am. I'm certainly
[47:44] built differently than you are. And so
[47:46] what affects me may not affect you the
[47:48] same way or may affect you in a greater
[47:50] way. And we get into those different
[47:52] things. And so your danger is not a
[47:54] danger to me and my danger is not a
[47:56] danger to you because of how we're built
[47:58] in the way that God has made us. But I
[48:00] want to dig in this morning on this
[48:02] approach or this uh this approach that
[48:04] we can take where we add to the word of
[48:06] God. And the thing is this, we can't add
[48:08] anything to the word of God. You look at
[48:10] the last chapter of Revelation. He says,
[48:11] "If any man adds to the words of this
[48:13] book of prophecy or takes away from it,
[48:15] then the plagues that are in it will be
[48:17] added to his life." We do not add to the
[48:19] word of God, and we do not take away
[48:20] from the word of God. We preach it as
[48:22] God gave it, and we let him be the
[48:24] interpreter of it. We We let him do
[48:26] that. Amen. So, church, this morning,
[48:28] remember, I am not preaching to the
[48:30] world. I'm preaching to you. I'm
[48:33] preaching to me. I'm preaching to this
[48:34] church. I'm preaching to those that
[48:36] support this ministry. So, let's not
[48:38] look at this this morning and say,
[48:39] "Well, Brother John, that's for other
[48:40] churches. That's for other people. I'm
[48:42] preaching it here because the Lord has
[48:43] laid it on my heart to preach it here.
[48:45] I'm not out preaching at some other
[48:47] brother's church. This is for this
[48:48] church. Amen. I'm preaching to myself.
[48:50] I'm preaching to my family. I'm
[48:52] preaching to the congregation that God
[48:54] has given me. Now, Jesus comes and he he
[48:57] and and when he comes on the scene, he's
[48:59] constantly dealing with
[49:01] expectations. He's constantly dealing
[49:03] with man-made laws of the priesthood.
[49:05] And he has to help his disciples fight
[49:06] through this because they're under a
[49:08] tremendous amount of church and social
[49:10] pressure to do what they they they've
[49:12] been told to do all these times. And I
[49:14] want to take us into the scriptures this
[49:15] morning about this. He said in Mark 7,
[49:18] he says, "Then came together unto him
[49:19] the Pharisees and certain of the scribes
[49:21] which come from Jerusalem, spiritual
[49:23] people, people that know their
[49:25] Bibles. And when they saw some of his
[49:28] disciples eat bread with defiled, that
[49:30] is to say, with unwashing hands, they
[49:32] found fault." Now, catch the wording
[49:34] here. They didn't just say they're
[49:36] dirty. They didn't just say they're
[49:37] unwashed. He said they're
[49:40] defiled. That word means
[49:44] desecrated. That is not a simple dos and
[49:47] don'ts, church. That is putting a
[49:49] spiritual condition on a physical act.
[49:53] You are a desecrated believer. You know
[49:55] what we'd say today? If they had the
[49:57] Holy Ghost, they wouldn't do
[50:00] that. Right? Now remember, they've
[50:03] reduced the disciples to being
[50:05] desecrated people because they didn't
[50:08] wash their
[50:11] hands. He says, "For the Pharisees and
[50:13] all the Jews, except they wash their
[50:15] hands often, eat not holding the
[50:18] tradition
[50:20] of the
[50:23] elders." Can I put some names to it?
[50:27] Brother Mark, Brother Bob, Brother
[50:30] Gerald, Brother David, Mom, Dad. I'm not
[50:34] saying you do it, brothers, but I'm
[50:35] saying that's who it would be in our
[50:37] church that the elders would be putting
[50:40] a burden on the youngers by tradition
[50:42] and by teaching. Okay? Now, that word
[50:46] tradition is an interesting one because
[50:48] it means it is a
[50:51] handover. It is not something that is
[50:53] established. You don't need to hand over
[50:54] something that's established, church.
[50:56] You have to hand over something that is
[50:58] not established because it's not written
[51:00] anywhere. It's not it's not documented
[51:02] anywhere. You have to hand it over
[51:04] because you're carrying it and you've
[51:06] got to give it to somebody else to
[51:07] carry. That's what a tradition is. It's
[51:09] a handover. It's a carryover. Amen. It
[51:12] is not a revelation. It is a tradition.
[51:14] It's a handover from somebody else often
[51:17] without reason or
[51:18] explanation. This is the way it is.
[51:22] He says, ' And when they came from the
[51:24] market, except they wash hands, they eat
[51:27] not, and many other things there be,
[51:29] which they have received to hold. Many
[51:31] other traditions which they've been
[51:33] handed over, and they're holding them,
[51:34] they're a burden to them. Now, he said,
[51:36] as the washing of cups and pots and
[51:39] brazen vessels and of tables. Now, let
[51:41] me stop and ask this. Is washing hands
[51:45] bad? Church, in that age, washing hands
[51:48] was about one of the best things you
[51:50] could do? In that age, washing hands
[51:52] might save your life because people were
[51:54] pretty dirty. They didn't bathe that
[51:56] often very much in the old days
[51:58] traditionally. So, whenever somebody was
[52:00] sick, whenever somebody was dirty,
[52:02] whenever somebody was infected, if they
[52:04] didn't wash their hands and you didn't
[52:06] wash your hands, the plague would run
[52:07] rampant. That's why the the black plague
[52:09] could run rampant through the dark ages
[52:11] and these different things is because
[52:12] personal hygiene was horrible. Washing
[52:15] your hands saves lives back then. This
[52:18] is not a wrong thing to do. It is a good
[52:21] thing to do. It is a right thing to do.
[52:24] What it is not is a word thing to do.
[52:27] Okay. So, now we get into why do we wash
[52:29] our hands? To keep from spreading
[52:32] diseases. Good idea, but it's not a word
[52:35] requirement. But there is a word
[52:37] requirement to wash. And when you go
[52:39] into the book of Leviticus, you go into
[52:41] the law of Moses. Amen. There were there
[52:43] were those that had to wash because they
[52:45] had an open wound.
[52:47] So if you had a cut, if you had a sc a
[52:49] scab or something like that, you had to
[52:51] wash your hands and you had to wash
[52:53] everything that you touched. And if you
[52:55] refused to wash it, then you had to
[52:57] break that pot or whatever it was so
[52:59] that nobody would want to use
[53:01] it. If you were a butcher and you were
[53:04] dealing with carcasses, you're dealing
[53:06] with meat, you're dealing with
[53:07] potentially things that are very
[53:09] dangerous. And so you had to wash
[53:10] yourself and you had to wash your
[53:12] clothes if you touched those things. But
[53:15] God didn't tell everyone to wash
[53:16] everything all the time. What did he do,
[53:19] church? He went to the source of the
[53:21] problem and he dealt with it at source
[53:24] rather than spreading the burden over
[53:26] the entire
[53:27] congregation. So those that were in a
[53:29] position of danger to those things, he
[53:32] said, "You wash yourselves regularly."
[53:33] The priests had to wash to come into the
[53:35] presence of the Lord. The people did
[53:37] not. The priests did. There is a level
[53:41] of sanctification required for the
[53:43] ministry that is different than those of
[53:45] the congregation. Now if you live your
[53:47] life to that level of a minister that's
[53:49] a good thing but that is not necessarily
[53:51] the requirement. Okay. So what happened
[53:55] is these peoples that had that presented
[53:57] a danger to themselves or to others he
[54:00] said on you I place the burden of
[54:02] washing all the time but I don't put it
[54:04] on everyone else because they're not in
[54:06] danger. They're not a danger to the
[54:08] people that are around them. Amen. And
[54:10] so those that could cause suffering or
[54:12] pain or even death, he said, "We're
[54:14] going to keep you clean and everyone
[54:15] else can just go about their lives happy
[54:17] golucky because they're not a danger to
[54:19] anyone." Can you catch that, church?
[54:21] There are those that need to be clean.
[54:24] We're we're speaking spiritually now.
[54:26] Cleaner than others. Because otherwise,
[54:29] if they're not clean, it spreads to
[54:31] everyone else. There's a standard of
[54:34] life for the ministry that I believe is
[54:35] higher than the people. Because people
[54:37] look at the ministers and they take what
[54:39] the ministers do and they go one or two
[54:40] steps beyond that. So if we live a life
[54:43] that's higher, then what happens is
[54:45] they'll live right there and they'll be
[54:46] perfectly fine if they can do that. But
[54:48] we don't live our lives by standards of
[54:50] the ministry church. That's above and
[54:52] beyond. That's what gets us here in the
[54:53] first place is we live by a minister
[54:55] standard rather than by a word standard.
[54:58] You'll notice we wash our hands all the
[54:59] time, don't we? During co what did they
[55:02] say? Wash your hands. Wash your hands.
[55:03] Wash your hands. We ought to wash our
[55:05] hands all the time. Who washes their
[55:06] hands more than anybody else in the
[55:08] world, church? Doctors. Why? Because if
[55:12] a doctor has dirty hands and they're
[55:14] touching people that are sick, they can
[55:16] make them even sicker. A surgeon with
[55:18] germs on his hands can kill a person
[55:20] because he's going into
[55:22] situations where you can't go in dirty.
[55:26] He's going he's breaking barriers. He's
[55:28] breaking B things that are put in the
[55:30] body to keep infection out. He's going
[55:31] past those barriers for barriers for the
[55:34] intent of saving a life of correcting
[55:36] something. But he's got to go in
[55:37] perfectly clean or he kills that person,
[55:39] that
[55:40] patient. Listen, if you're a hand in the
[55:43] church, you're going to have to be
[55:44] cleaner than anybody else because the
[55:46] hands touch everything. We eat with our
[55:49] hands. We we shake hands. We hug people.
[55:51] We handle everything with our hands. And
[55:53] then it touches our mouth. It touches
[55:54] our face. It touches other people. The
[55:56] hands have to be clean. Is it okay for a
[55:58] hand to be dirty? Yes. if it's doing
[56:00] dirty things, but you better wash your
[56:02] hands after you're done doing the dirty
[56:04] things because then you're going to do
[56:05] things that require your hands to be
[56:06] clean. What if you're a knee? Do we
[56:09] worry about dirty
[56:10] knees? No. Knees don't touch anybody.
[56:14] Knees are of zero importance when it
[56:16] comes to cleanliness. You could live
[56:17] your life with dirty knees and never
[56:19] have a problem. But you live with dirty
[56:21] hands and you're going to have lots of
[56:22] problems. You're going to have lots of
[56:23] sickness. You're going to cause lots of
[56:25] issues. Amen. So listen, you can be the
[56:27] world's cleanest knee, but you don't
[56:30] have to be clean. But if you're a hand,
[56:31] you've got to be a clean hand.
[56:33] Otherwise, it causes issues in your
[56:35] body. Amen. He says, "Then the Pharisees
[56:38] and scribes asked him, why walk not thy
[56:40] disciples according to the tradition of
[56:42] the elders, but eat bread with unwashing
[56:44] hands?" Church, at least they're honest,
[56:46] honest enough to say, "Hey, this is our
[56:47] rule. This is not the law of Moses. This
[56:50] is ours. It's a tradition, not the word
[56:51] of God." And he answered and said unto
[56:53] them, "Well hath Isaiah prophesied of
[56:55] you hypocrites, as it is written, this
[56:58] people honorth me with their lips, but
[57:00] their heart is far from me." Now notice
[57:02] Jesus problem is not with the
[57:05] washing. His problem is with the doing
[57:07] what God never told you to do and not
[57:10] doing what God told you to
[57:11] do. God doesn't care so much if you go
[57:14] above and beyond. That's on you. You can
[57:16] do that if you want. But he's saying,
[57:17] "At least do what I've told you to do."
[57:19] And when you expand it and do a bunch of
[57:21] things he told you not to do and you
[57:22] don't do the things that he did, that's
[57:25] when we get problems. And that's when
[57:27] you develop a legalistic religious group
[57:29] of people. That's exactly what he's
[57:31] dealing with. They put their own
[57:32] traditions above the law of God. He
[57:34] says, "How be it in vain do they worship
[57:37] me teaching for doctrines of
[57:39] commandments of men." This is the
[57:41] definition of a denomination. It's the
[57:43] commandments of men being taught as if
[57:45] they're the word of God. Now realize
[57:47] this, church. The Pharisees didn't stop
[57:49] preaching the word of Moses. They didn't
[57:51] stop preaching the message of Moses, but
[57:53] they added on to it. They blended it in.
[57:56] And what happened is they destroyed the
[57:57] faith of the people and they took the
[57:59] power out of the word. That's it.
[58:01] Because guess what? If I tell you
[58:03] something that's of me and not of God,
[58:04] how much power does it have? Zero. I'll
[58:07] tell you that today. Zero. What I say
[58:09] has no power. What the word says is
[58:11] where the power is. And so what happened
[58:13] when they blended it? They lost that.
[58:14] Amen. And it turned them into religious
[58:16] people rather than righteous people. It
[58:18] turned them into self-righteous people
[58:20] is really what happened there. It got
[58:22] them dwelling on their own works rather
[58:24] than focusing on the fact that we need
[58:26] the
[58:27] blood. We need the blood, church. It's
[58:30] our works aren't getting us there. We've
[58:32] got to have the blood. And it got their
[58:33] eyes off the atonement. It got them
[58:35] working on their own salvation. And it
[58:37] led them down a path of destruction. He
[58:39] says, "For laying aside the commandment
[58:41] of God, we hold the tradition of men as
[58:44] the washing of pots and cups and many
[58:47] other things, many other such things you
[58:50] do." So, our focus is on the laws and
[58:52] the rules and the standards and the
[58:54] traditions of the church rather than
[58:56] what God told them to do in the first
[58:57] place. And it bound the people. It was
[59:00] self-made works to please God and to
[59:02] make them feel good about themselves.
[59:04] And he said unto them, "Full well ye
[59:07] reject the commandment of God that you
[59:10] may keep your own
[59:13] tradition." Jesus would say that you
[59:15] neglect the weightier matters of the
[59:17] law, justice and mercy and all these
[59:19] things. He says, "You don't have the
[59:21] attitude or the approach of the law.
[59:24] What you've got is a bunch of rules to
[59:26] make you feel good, to make you look
[59:27] good." And he comes down to verse 13. He
[59:29] says, "You're making the word of God of
[59:31] none effect through your tradition." He
[59:33] says, "You've taken the power out of the
[59:34] word." He says, "Which you have
[59:36] delivered and many such like things they
[59:39] do." They've distracted the people from
[59:41] the essence of what really matters. And
[59:44] they've blanketed that word with
[59:46] personal traditions and rules and
[59:48] regulations. Brother Bram says it this
[59:50] way. Kind of glad we don't have visitors
[59:53] this
[59:53] morning. He says, "And today we still
[59:56] use
[59:57] self-sufficiency. We use all the
[59:59] different ideas and vain philosophies of
[1:00:01] man. And it's absolutely of not. Jesus
[1:00:05] said, "Men worship me teaching for
[1:00:07] doctrine their traditions of men and
[1:00:09] they worship in vain." He said, "You
[1:00:10] could worship the Lord and still not be
[1:00:13] worshiped in the right way and it would
[1:00:15] not be reckoned to you for
[1:00:17] reconciliation." God doesn't recognize
[1:00:20] your worship outside of what he tells
[1:00:22] you to
[1:00:23] do. That's not it. You can offer the
[1:00:27] sacrifice, but he's looking for what he
[1:00:29] asked for, not for what you want.
[1:00:31] Jesus would say this. He would say,
[1:00:34] speaking of Jesus, it says, ' And he had
[1:00:36] a contrary doctrine to what they've been
[1:00:37] taught. Yet his doctrine was purely
[1:00:41] scriptural. He says, I want you to hold
[1:00:43] that now just for a little bit and
[1:00:44] watch. It was scriptural. Every word
[1:00:46] that he said was scripture itself. Not
[1:00:49] one time did he break any scriptures,
[1:00:51] but fulfilled it just exactly. But their
[1:00:54] way of teaching it was contrary to what
[1:00:57] it really was. And then he says these
[1:00:59] words, "I wonder sometimes about after
[1:01:01] 1900 years if we haven't strayed a
[1:01:03] little bit from the path and gotten just
[1:01:06] a little bit off the
[1:01:08] path." I want you to catch that. He
[1:01:11] says, "You do something for God, you do
[1:01:13] it sincerely, and it's not what God
[1:01:16] required of you. And therefore, it is
[1:01:17] not worship. Worship is to give him what
[1:01:20] he asks for,
[1:01:22] not to give him what you have." The
[1:01:24] whole world is worshiping him. And
[1:01:26] they're giving him what they want and
[1:01:27] what makes them feel good and what makes
[1:01:29] them feel religious and what makes them
[1:01:31] feel accepted. And Kabad is written over
[1:01:32] the door. God's not even in it because
[1:01:34] they've walked away from the word of
[1:01:36] God. Amen. God asks us to do it his way,
[1:01:38] not our way. There's only one door.
[1:01:41] There's only one way. There's only one
[1:01:43] truth. There's only one life,
[1:01:45] church. And it's his way. It's not our
[1:01:47] way. The life of a born again believer
[1:01:49] is one of liberty in the spirit, not of
[1:01:52] traditions of the church. Amen. If we
[1:01:55] say if we take start taking a bunch of
[1:01:57] rules and living by it, we start to take
[1:02:00] comfort in the fact that we're a rule
[1:02:01] follower rather than a spiritfilled
[1:02:04] believer. Okay, that turns us into
[1:02:07] religious people, not sons and daughters
[1:02:09] of God. We've completely missed the
[1:02:10] picture. Watch this. Brother Bram says
[1:02:12] this. He says, "Now some of them say if
[1:02:14] we keep the commandments, that's all we
[1:02:15] have to do." He said, "If keeping
[1:02:17] commandments was all that God required,
[1:02:19] Jesus died in vain. The Holy Spirit
[1:02:21] didn't have to come because they had the
[1:02:23] commandments before the Holy Spirit
[1:02:25] came. He said, "But it takes the Holy
[1:02:27] Spirit to keep the commandments. You
[1:02:30] have to have it." God's word is always
[1:02:32] perfect and always the same each time.
[1:02:35] He says, "Now men pervert it and change
[1:02:37] it." And when Jesus came the first time,
[1:02:40] he found that men were doing this very
[1:02:42] same thing. They were perverting the
[1:02:45] ways of God. And Jesus said to them, "In
[1:02:47] vain you worship me. in vain you worship
[1:02:49] me. Teaching for doctrine the
[1:02:51] commandments of men. He says, "Now
[1:02:52] anything that's in vain, there's nothing
[1:02:54] to it. It's no good." And Jesus told the
[1:02:56] worshippers of that day that they were
[1:02:58] worshiping him in vain, teaching for
[1:03:00] doctrine the commandments of men. He
[1:03:02] says, "What am I trying to say?" He
[1:03:05] said, "You've got to go back to the word
[1:03:08] of God to get back. We have a restoring
[1:03:12] message in this age. taking us back to
[1:03:15] the word. Not taking us back to
[1:03:17] tradition. Not taking us back to
[1:03:19] denomination. Taking us back to the
[1:03:21] living
[1:03:23] word. He says, "You've got to go back.
[1:03:25] The church will never be able to move
[1:03:28] forward any further until it gets to the
[1:03:31] word and move on the word." We've got to
[1:03:35] come to the word. No matter what the
[1:03:36] sensation is, what it looks like, how
[1:03:39] big the church is, how mighty the people
[1:03:40] are, you've got to come back to the word
[1:03:43] of God. That's God's eternal word and we
[1:03:46] have to come to it. What does eternal
[1:03:47] mean?
[1:03:48] Unchanging. It has not changed. So why
[1:03:51] have we
[1:03:52] changed the word is what stays the same.
[1:03:54] We need to conform ourselves to the
[1:03:56] word. Let it be born in our lives. He
[1:03:58] said Jesus said, "In vain do they
[1:03:59] worship me, teaching for doctrine, the
[1:04:01] theologies of men, not the word." He
[1:04:04] says, "Man, his own conception of the
[1:04:07] word being interpreted." As I've said,
[1:04:10] God don't need no interpreter. He
[1:04:12] interprets every word himself. See, you
[1:04:14] don't need somebody to interpret it to
[1:04:16] you. God interprets it to you when
[1:04:18] you're willing to accept
[1:04:21] it. See, that's the life. That's life
[1:04:24] itself. I always tell this story about
[1:04:26] mom in her makeup, and she's given me
[1:04:28] permission to talk about this over the
[1:04:29] pulpit many times. My mom, it was
[1:04:33] preached that we don't wear makeup. Why
[1:04:35] don't we wear makeup,
[1:04:36] church? Because Jezebel was the woman
[1:04:39] that wore makeup. And Jezebel is not
[1:04:41] what anybody should pattern after that's
[1:04:43] a believer. That's why we don't do it.
[1:04:46] Okay? That's why we don't do it. But my
[1:04:48] mom said, "Lord, I like my makeup." But
[1:04:53] your word says that the spirit of a
[1:04:56] woman that likes makeup is not that of a
[1:04:58] believer. there's a gap between my
[1:05:00] desire and the word, I need you to close
[1:05:02] it. She did not say, "I'm stopping
[1:05:05] makeup." She said, "If you will take the
[1:05:07] desire away, I'll give up my makeup."
[1:05:11] Why? Because then there's a life behind
[1:05:13] it rather than a rule behind it. And 6
[1:05:16] months later, she wasn't wearing makeup
[1:05:18] and she doesn't even know how it went
[1:05:20] away. I asked my father about it. I
[1:05:22] said, "Dad, do you remember this?" He
[1:05:24] said, "John, I remember it clearly. It
[1:05:26] just started to fade away until one day
[1:05:28] she had no more makeup on and no more
[1:05:31] desire to do it, no more inclination to
[1:05:33] go back to it ever again. And she's
[1:05:36] never had to deal with it. Why? Because
[1:05:38] he changed her rather than conformed her
[1:05:40] to a set of rules. Amen. That's what
[1:05:43] we're looking for. And I'm getting ahead
[1:05:45] of my message this morning. We're not
[1:05:46] really going to go down this way, but
[1:05:48] we're trying to think about what does it
[1:05:49] mean to have the token life. It is not
[1:05:52] to follow dos and don'ts. It's to have
[1:05:54] the desires of the life of God inside of
[1:05:57] you living itself out without
[1:05:59] inhibition, without fear, without worry,
[1:06:02] without anxiety, without saying what
[1:06:05] will people think to say, "He has
[1:06:08] forgiven me. He has changed my life. I'm
[1:06:12] walking in liberty this morning." Who
[1:06:14] cares what people say? Now, there is a
[1:06:16] care we ought to have. And there's a
[1:06:18] balance there, and that's Romans 14.
[1:06:20] We'll cover that in a different service.
[1:06:22] But we've got to preach it as a life
[1:06:24] rather than as a
[1:06:26] requirement. That's why church, do we
[1:06:28] have standards? We have standards. But
[1:06:31] I'm not here to say you must do. I'm
[1:06:34] here to say you must receive him. That's
[1:06:37] what I preach. I'll preach the Holy
[1:06:39] Ghost all day long. And if you get the
[1:06:41] Holy Ghost, he'll take care of the
[1:06:44] standard. 100%. 100%. Get the Holy
[1:06:48] Ghost. You're having a problem with your
[1:06:49] kids, get them the Holy Ghost. Lead them
[1:06:52] to the Holy Ghost. Set an atmosphere in
[1:06:54] your home rather than just setting rules
[1:06:56] and
[1:06:57] regulations. Amen. They will come to
[1:07:00] life and they'll live it rather than
[1:07:03] come to the dos and don'ts and just obey
[1:07:06] it until they can get out from under
[1:07:10] it. Now, we can look at this and we can
[1:07:12] say, "Well, brother John, that's the the
[1:07:14] Pharisees. That's the Sadducees." We
[1:07:16] would expect that. It's obvious. Jesus
[1:07:18] said you are of your father the devil.
[1:07:20] That's what those kind of people do.
[1:07:21] They're just religious. No, that's not
[1:07:23] just religious people do it. We all do
[1:07:25] it. We all do it. We've had some really
[1:07:27] interesting conversations in our house
[1:07:28] over the last couple of days since I
[1:07:30] preached this on Wednesday and wondering
[1:07:32] where we were going with it cuz what
[1:07:35] happens when other believers are around
[1:07:36] us and they're trying to tell us this is
[1:07:39] wrong and that's wrong and you can't do
[1:07:40] this and you better do that. We deal
[1:07:43] with it. Absolutely. We deal with it in
[1:07:46] this very church. In every church, I'm
[1:07:48] not targeting us. I'm saying every
[1:07:50] church I've ever gone to has standards
[1:07:52] and traditions and ideas that have
[1:07:54] nothing to do with the word of
[1:07:56] God. And some that are built on it and
[1:07:59] magnified, some that have growth hormone
[1:08:02] injected into it to make it into
[1:08:03] something it was never intended to be.
[1:08:05] We all have all sorts of ideas and
[1:08:07] preferences and feelings about the way
[1:08:09] things should be done. And it has
[1:08:10] nothing to do with God for the other
[1:08:12] person. It may be all of God in your
[1:08:15] life. It may be all of God in my life.
[1:08:17] You know, listen, you look at the
[1:08:19] scripture and the scripture says, "And
[1:08:20] the word of the Lord came to soand so."
[1:08:24] Can I give you an example this morning?
[1:08:25] The word of the Lord came to Hosea and
[1:08:28] he said, "Go and get a wife that is a
[1:08:31] prostitute." Now, church, if I was to
[1:08:33] tell you brothers, that is the word of
[1:08:36] the
[1:08:37] Lord, and you all went out and got wives
[1:08:39] of prostitutes, what would this church
[1:08:41] be? It did end up exactly the way
[1:08:43] Hosea's marriage ended up
[1:08:45] poorly because it's not a standard. But
[1:08:48] for you, it is the word of God because
[1:08:50] God gave it to
[1:08:52] you. But he didn't give it to you,
[1:08:54] Brother Grant. If he told me to marry a
[1:08:56] woman like that, that's for me. But he
[1:08:58] didn't tell Brother Grant to do that.
[1:09:00] And until he does, Brother Grant should
[1:09:01] not go out and marry a prostitute. I
[1:09:02] didn't marry a prostitute, by the way.
[1:09:05] Far from it. Praise the Lord. Praise the
[1:09:08] Lord. But you see what I'm talking
[1:09:10] about? It can be a personal direct
[1:09:13] revelation and direction for you from
[1:09:16] God Almighty. And it is not the word. It
[1:09:19] is the word to you. It's for you to
[1:09:23] protect you, to guard you, to guide you,
[1:09:25] to provide for you, whatever that case
[1:09:26] may be. And as long as it doesn't
[1:09:28] contradict the word, that's okay. But it
[1:09:31] is not a church standard. It's a
[1:09:33] personal standard. We'll see this as
[1:09:34] Brother Brandham talks about it in a
[1:09:35] little bit. Watch this as we continue
[1:09:37] on. He says, "And it came to pass as
[1:09:40] Jesus set a meet in his house." He's
[1:09:42] talking about Matthew's house. He just
[1:09:44] called Matthew. Matthew came
[1:09:45] immediately. Praise the Lord, brother
[1:09:46] Matt.
[1:09:48] Right? He says that many publicans and
[1:09:51] sinners sat also together with Jesus and
[1:09:53] his disciples, for there were many and
[1:09:55] they followed him. It's a mixed
[1:09:58] multitude. And when the scribes and
[1:10:00] Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and
[1:10:02] sinners, they said unto his disciples,
[1:10:04] "How is it that he eateth and drinkkeeth
[1:10:06] with publicans and sinners?" Now church,
[1:10:09] catch this. This is a lesson for mature
[1:10:11] believers. Do we have any mature
[1:10:12] believers in here this
[1:10:14] morning? We got seven. Do we have mature
[1:10:17] believers this morning? Because let's
[1:10:19] see this church. The the the test of
[1:10:21] maturity is how you deal with
[1:10:24] immaturity. That's why we need maturity
[1:10:27] is to deal with the immature. Because if
[1:10:29] I am immature and I'm dealing with
[1:10:32] immaturity, what comes out of it?
[1:10:33] Nothing good. But it takes maturity to
[1:10:36] deal with immaturity. be the right way.
[1:10:39] It says when Jesus heard it, he saith
[1:10:41] unto them, they that are whole have no
[1:10:43] need of a physician, but they that are
[1:10:45] sick. I came not to call the righteous,
[1:10:47] but sinners to repentance. Jesus is
[1:10:50] saying, listen, mature believers can
[1:10:52] handle unbelievers. Mature believers can
[1:10:55] handle sinners. Mature believers can
[1:10:56] handle being outside of their house.
[1:10:59] Mature believers can stand to be around
[1:11:01] conversations and conduct that is
[1:11:04] unbecoming to them, but it does not
[1:11:06] touch them because they are of another
[1:11:08] kingdom. They're another life, of
[1:11:10] another
[1:11:11] conversion. They can be around it and
[1:11:14] not be touched by it. It does not change
[1:11:17] who they
[1:11:19] are. Jesus is not there for his sake.
[1:11:23] He's there for their sake. He allows
[1:11:26] them into Matthew's house. Hey, Matthew,
[1:11:28] come and follow me. By the way, look at
[1:11:30] this crowd. We're going to have them in
[1:11:31] your house. No.
[1:11:33] Unbelievers, ranked
[1:11:36] sinners, inviting them into your house.
[1:11:39] Whoa. Would we do
[1:11:43] that? Why? Jesus has a desire for their
[1:11:47] soul that looks beyond the dirt that
[1:11:50] surrounds
[1:11:51] them. Remember what Jesus said to Peter?
[1:11:54] Because here's the thing, church. We can
[1:11:56] sit at home and say, "I'm not going to
[1:11:58] get
[1:12:00] dirty." Jesus said, "Peter, you're clean
[1:12:03] every wit because I've washed you. But
[1:12:06] when you walk around, you're going to
[1:12:07] get dirty no matter what." And that's
[1:12:09] what the daily washing of water by the
[1:12:12] word is for. Because as we walk around,
[1:12:16] we're going to get dirty. And we're
[1:12:17] meant to walk around. Jesus said, "You
[1:12:20] are a city on a hill that cannot be
[1:12:22] hid." Right? Man does not take a light
[1:12:24] and put it under a bushel. You cannot be
[1:12:27] it. You have to be a witness and a
[1:12:29] testimony. And to be that, you're going
[1:12:31] to walk where things are dirty. And
[1:12:34] you've got to be okay with it. But I
[1:12:36] made a provision to daily wash you from
[1:12:39] those things. We got to go to work,
[1:12:41] brothers. Brother Matt, how are
[1:12:43] conversations in the bluecollar world?
[1:12:45] They ain't good. Get Let me tell you, in
[1:12:47] the white collar world, they're no
[1:12:49] better. People cussing like sailors, men
[1:12:51] and women alike.
[1:12:53] It doesn't matter, church. You're going
[1:12:55] to get dirty. But the thing is that
[1:12:58] ought not to be a fear that I'm going to
[1:12:59] get dirty. Why? Because I passed from
[1:13:02] death unto life. I passed from dirt into
[1:13:04] his righteousness. This is not going to
[1:13:06] hold me back.
[1:13:08] Now, you got to be able to judge
[1:13:10] yourself. Just cuz brother John says,
[1:13:12] "Go out, go ye into all the world, you
[1:13:14] got to be careful you go where God wants
[1:13:16] you to go." And that's where leadership
[1:13:17] comes in. But mature believers can
[1:13:20] handle immature situations, difficult
[1:13:22] situations, worldly situations, rough
[1:13:26] language. We're not looking for it.
[1:13:28] We're looking for souls and we're
[1:13:30] willing to go through the dirt and the
[1:13:32] mire to get it. Okay? I hope you catch
[1:13:36] my heart this
[1:13:37] morning. Listen to
[1:13:39] this. Because you say, you know, the
[1:13:42] last one it was the Pharisees and the
[1:13:43] and the different ones, but we're
[1:13:45] talking now about believers putting
[1:13:46] pressures. And in verse 18 it says, "And
[1:13:49] when the disciples of
[1:13:52] John, the prophets's disciples, was John
[1:13:55] a true true prophet, church, did John
[1:13:58] have a true message? Was John preaching
[1:14:00] the pure word?" These are real believers
[1:14:02] that followed
[1:14:04] John. And the Pharisees, they used to
[1:14:08] fast. And they came and said unto him,
[1:14:10] "Why did the disciples of John and the
[1:14:11] Pharisees fast? But your disciples fast
[1:14:14] not." Let me put it this way. Why does
[1:14:16] our church do this, but your church
[1:14:17] doesn't do that? Why does our family do
[1:14:19] this, but your family doesn't do
[1:14:22] that? We've all had it. We've all heard
[1:14:25] it. Realize what's going on now. These
[1:14:27] are the pro the disciples of John. John
[1:14:30] told his disciples, "Follow Jesus. He's
[1:14:33] the Messiah. I must decrease. He must
[1:14:36] increase. Go follow him." And then they
[1:14:38] go to him and they say, "How come your
[1:14:40] disciples don't act like us? If you're
[1:14:42] taking us further, why aren't they as
[1:14:45] fervent in their way of life as we are?
[1:14:49] Okay, you guys are really listening this
[1:14:54] morning. Why do they do it and we don't
[1:14:56] do it? Or why don't they do it when we
[1:14:58] do it?
[1:15:00] Okay. Is there anything wrong with
[1:15:02] fasting?
[1:15:05] No. Is there anything good about
[1:15:07] fasting? Yep. Is fasting scriptural?
[1:15:11] Yes. Is fasting
[1:15:15] required?
[1:15:17] No. Fasting is required if you want to
[1:15:19] get certain results. Jesus said there's
[1:15:21] some demons only go out by prayer and
[1:15:23] fasting. There are some things that are
[1:15:25] dealt with based on setting yourself
[1:15:28] aside to get closer to
[1:15:31] God. Not about public displays. Oh, I'm
[1:15:36] fasting. We're not supposed to tell
[1:15:38] people we're fasting. That's between you
[1:15:40] and God. Otherwise, it becomes a facade.
[1:15:43] It becomes a religious embellishment of
[1:15:45] your life. Has nothing to do with God.
[1:15:48] Then, so it's scriptural, but you don't
[1:15:51] have to do it. Says, "And Jesus said
[1:15:53] unto them," here's his answer. Now, "Can
[1:15:55] the children of the bride chamber fast
[1:15:57] while the bridegroom is with them? As
[1:15:59] long as they have the bridegroom with
[1:16:00] them, they cannot fast. But the days
[1:16:02] will come when the bridegroom shall be
[1:16:04] taken away from them, and then shall
[1:16:05] they fast in those days." What's the
[1:16:07] purpose of fasting? It's to get rid of
[1:16:09] all distractions and focus yourself on
[1:16:12] getting an answer from God. And Jesus
[1:16:15] says, "Listen, God's in flesh right now.
[1:16:17] Why would you fast? You can literally
[1:16:19] come have a conversation with me. The
[1:16:21] word is walking with you. You don't have
[1:16:23] to go and fast to find it. It's here."
[1:16:25] He says, "When I go away, that's when
[1:16:27] you might need to fast. But for now, you
[1:16:28] don't because what you have need of is
[1:16:30] right here now. Take advantage of it.
[1:16:32] Don't be religious while the answer's
[1:16:34] here.
[1:16:35] recognize what's here and you won't have
[1:16:37] to fast. Save the fasting for when I'm
[1:16:39] not here is basically what he's saying.
[1:16:42] Then he says these words, "No man also
[1:16:44] seweth a piece of new cloth on an old
[1:16:46] garment. Otherwise, else the new piece
[1:16:48] that filled it up taketh away from the
[1:16:50] old and the rent is made worse." We
[1:16:52] talked about that law last on on
[1:16:53] Wednesday, how if you take two different
[1:16:55] materials, then they'll pull apart.
[1:16:57] Well, it's the same thing with the same
[1:16:59] material but new and old. The old stuff
[1:17:01] has been it may be shrunk. It may be
[1:17:03] tightened up. They may be pulled apart.
[1:17:05] Whatever it is, you put the new with the
[1:17:06] old and all it does is it highlights the
[1:17:08] the the the fact that there is a repair
[1:17:11] made to the to the garment and it also
[1:17:13] pulls it worse. You can't do it that
[1:17:16] way. Then he says, "And no man putteth
[1:17:18] new wine into old bottles, else the new
[1:17:21] wine do burst the bottles and the wine
[1:17:23] is spilled, but the battle and the
[1:17:24] bottles will be marked. But new wine
[1:17:26] must be put into new bottles." Because
[1:17:30] what Jesus is saying here, he's saying,
[1:17:31] "Guys, you can't take the old and blend
[1:17:34] it with the new. You got to move on into
[1:17:37] the new and leave the old behind." He's
[1:17:41] talking now about the switch from law
[1:17:43] into
[1:17:44] grace, from the fulfillment of the law,
[1:17:47] now moving them into a whole new
[1:17:48] chapter. He says, "Guys, you can't do
[1:17:50] what you've been doing all along. It's
[1:17:51] great. You've got these things. It's all
[1:17:53] good. It's not bad in and of itself, but
[1:17:55] you can't hold on to an old way of life
[1:17:57] when you're coming into new life. it
[1:17:59] won't work. You've got to embrace the
[1:18:01] new and do away with the old. Okay, we
[1:18:05] saw this happen in the early days when
[1:18:09] people, you know, they came into
[1:18:10] Pentecost and they came into, you know,
[1:18:13] the different ones that might have been
[1:18:14] Salvation Army or wherever it was and
[1:18:16] they were in those things and they had
[1:18:18] all sorts of church traditions. I
[1:18:19] remember brother Gerald telling us about
[1:18:20] some of the the the traditions that they
[1:18:22] had in church where if a sister came in
[1:18:24] with a hat that was too fancy, they'd
[1:18:25] snip the they'd snip the the feather
[1:18:29] off. Now, we might laugh if we're
[1:18:34] immature. Sorry,
[1:18:36] Paul. We might laugh at that, but what
[1:18:39] is that? Rules and
[1:18:43] regulations. Did that change that woman?
[1:18:46] She needed a heart change, not a
[1:18:47] clothing change. That's why when we have
[1:18:50] visitors here, I've told the deacons,
[1:18:51] "Unless they are truly indecent, we let
[1:18:54] them in." Because we're looking for them
[1:18:57] to have a new birth experience, not a
[1:19:00] makeover. We are not here for makeovers.
[1:19:02] We are here to have a
[1:19:05] soulchanging, lifechanging experience
[1:19:07] with a personal Jesus Christ. That's all
[1:19:11] I'm interested in. I am not interested
[1:19:13] in that. I would rather you young people
[1:19:15] were
[1:19:17] disobedient in
[1:19:19] sincerity than faking it until you could
[1:19:23] leave cuz faking it won't get you
[1:19:25] anywhere. Now you're better off doing
[1:19:28] the right thing but there's no sincerity
[1:19:30] in that and you're not benefiting from
[1:19:32] it except that it guards you from
[1:19:34] different things.
[1:19:37] Okay. So what happened? people who came
[1:19:40] into
[1:19:41] Pentecost. And what did Pentecost do,
[1:19:43] church? They set up standards. Look at
[1:19:46] the Methodists. You talk about
[1:19:47] standards. The Methodists had standards.
[1:19:51] You can look at the Amish out in Western
[1:19:53] Canada. You have a ton of people that
[1:19:54] came out of the Menanite communities and
[1:19:55] the Amish communities. You talk about
[1:19:57] standards and they came right into the
[1:19:58] message and they carried half of those
[1:20:00] standards in there. And it had nothing
[1:20:02] to do with anything. It was just the way
[1:20:04] they were raised. It was the way their
[1:20:06] church was growing up. It was the way
[1:20:07] their family was. And they carried that
[1:20:09] in. And what did they do? They took it
[1:20:10] and they started to blend it into the
[1:20:11] message and spread all of these sorts of
[1:20:13] things. And what does it do? It sets
[1:20:15] expectations. It sets traditions. It
[1:20:18] sets rules and regulations inside of the
[1:20:20] church and has nothing at all to do with
[1:20:22] the word of God. And it binds people.
[1:20:25] And the minute that they do something
[1:20:26] that is contrary to that, the church
[1:20:28] hammers them down. Why? Because it's a
[1:20:31] church
[1:20:32] tradition. Nobody shall break it.
[1:20:38] I've heard dozens of things preached and
[1:20:40] preached hard that had nothing to do
[1:20:42] with the word of God. Never a scripture
[1:20:43] was
[1:20:45] mentioned, but they'll hit it and
[1:20:47] they'll hit it and they'll hit it until
[1:20:48] the people are too cowed to follow the
[1:20:51] leading of the of the spirit in their
[1:20:54] life. Brother Ram says it this way.
[1:20:56] Notice he said in vain do they worship
[1:20:58] me teaching
[1:20:59] discrepancy for doctrine. He says the
[1:21:03] docu uh teaching for doctrine, the
[1:21:05] discrepancy, the doctrines of men, the
[1:21:07] creeds of men, teaching that to be the
[1:21:10] word of God when it has nothing to do
[1:21:12] with the word of God. Okay? Can I give
[1:21:16] you some examples of this? Don't get
[1:21:18] tense on me this morning. Okay? Let's
[1:21:20] sit down. Let's just listen to this. I'm
[1:21:22] going to tell you things that I have
[1:21:24] heard preached around this message or
[1:21:27] that people have relayed to me that have
[1:21:29] been preached around this message. I
[1:21:31] call these things sacred
[1:21:33] cows. Sacred cows. Brother Vichel is the
[1:21:36] only one that probably knows what that
[1:21:37] means. In India, cows are sacred. You
[1:21:39] can't touch them. You can't do anything.
[1:21:41] You can't even push them off the road.
[1:21:42] You definitely can't eat
[1:21:45] them. Things that shall not be touched,
[1:21:48] that are inviolent, that you cannot
[1:21:51] question, and that if you say or do
[1:21:53] anything contrary to it, you get
[1:21:54] hammered
[1:21:56] down. I put up the pictures for it.
[1:21:59] I've heard it preached that men can part
[1:22:02] their hair down the
[1:22:04] middle. Can I read you a quote? I didn't
[1:22:06] put it up. Burbraham says, "The only
[1:22:08] thing I know last night I remember
[1:22:10] thinking the man I thought he had such
[1:22:11] pretty hair, parting his hair in the
[1:22:13] middle, this gray-headed man sitting
[1:22:14] here, he cares. Do you care?" What does
[1:22:17] parting your hair have to do with
[1:22:18] anything, church?
[1:22:19] Nothing. But yet, people will preach,
[1:22:22] you can't part your hair down the
[1:22:23] middle. Has to be a side part. I look
[1:22:25] around this church, I think we're all
[1:22:26] side parters.
[1:22:28] But our sisters part down the middle.
[1:22:30] Some of
[1:22:32] them, right? What does parting your hair
[1:22:34] have to do with anything, church?
[1:22:37] Nothing. If you're patterning it because
[1:22:39] the world starts to do it, that's where
[1:22:42] we have a problem. And it's not the hair
[1:22:43] parting that's the problem. It's the
[1:22:45] following the spirit of the world that's
[1:22:47] the
[1:22:47] problem. Here's the thing. Did you
[1:22:50] notice for a while that high and tight
[1:22:52] haircuts and nicely trimmed beards were
[1:22:54] in vogue? Guess what? I was in style for
[1:22:56] a while.
[1:22:58] I fit in. But when they moved on, I
[1:23:02] stayed. Why? Because I'm not doing it
[1:23:05] for the world. I'm doing it because
[1:23:06] that's how I want my hair to be. That's
[1:23:09] just the way it is. My hairstyle has
[1:23:10] changed very minimally throughout my 45
[1:23:12] years of life. It just doesn't change.
[1:23:14] Why? I am who I am. I'm not following
[1:23:16] the world. There was a while there where
[1:23:18] I was seeing message ministers changing
[1:23:19] their hair constantly. And I said, "What
[1:23:21] in the world is going on here? There's a
[1:23:23] problem." Now, listen. Sometimes you men
[1:23:25] have been in a barber and they do
[1:23:26] something you didn't intend. Listen,
[1:23:28] sometimes they take way too much off.
[1:23:30] Maybe they're trying to modernize us. I
[1:23:32] don't
[1:23:33] know. Sometimes that happens. Listen, we
[1:23:36] don't sit there and say exactly how we
[1:23:37] want it. Most of us don't at least. But
[1:23:40] sometimes they do something beyond what
[1:23:41] we do. Okay. But when you see people
[1:23:43] constantly changing their hairstyles, I
[1:23:45] say we've got a problem. But it's not a
[1:23:48] standard problem. It's an influence
[1:23:50] problem. See, we preach against the
[1:23:53] fashion rather than against the
[1:23:54] influence. That's the problem. Fix the
[1:23:56] influence problem. You won't have to
[1:23:58] deal with fashion issues
[1:23:59] anymore. It has been preached that you
[1:24:02] cannot have short sleeves for men or
[1:24:05] women. You can look down the list here.
[1:24:07] I put all of these abominations in front
[1:24:08] of
[1:24:09] us. It has been preached that you cannot
[1:24:11] wear any
[1:24:14] jewelry. It has been preached that you
[1:24:16] can't wear a jean skirt. My sister, my
[1:24:18] my wife told me this one. She said a a
[1:24:20] man was hammering this, but he didn't
[1:24:22] hammer it until he got you. And he says,
[1:24:24] "Any sisters that are wearing jean
[1:24:25] skirts, stand up." And they stood up and
[1:24:27] he says, "You're going to hell for
[1:24:28] wearing a jean
[1:24:30] skirt." We
[1:24:32] laugh, but we do
[1:24:35] it. It may not be jean
[1:24:38] skirts,
[1:24:40] okay? Young people can't play
[1:24:43] sports. Says who? Your prophet allowed
[1:24:46] his daughter to play tennis.
[1:24:52] What is it? Protecting them maybe. I
[1:24:55] don't know. But to preach it as an
[1:24:57] absolute, that's where we get into
[1:24:59] issues. You can't buy clothes from a
[1:25:01] store. Yes, people preach that because
[1:25:04] anything that is bought from the world
[1:25:06] has a worldly influence behind it.
[1:25:08] Therefore, it could never be on a
[1:25:09] Christian's
[1:25:10] body. You can't buy or read books not
[1:25:13] printed by a Christian publisher,
[1:25:14] including Bibles.
[1:25:18] Yeah, church. Do you honestly think that
[1:25:20] any publisher is Holy Spirit anointed
[1:25:23] and
[1:25:25] filled? It's silliness. The fact that
[1:25:28] they call themselves Christian does not
[1:25:30] make them Christian. When you look at
[1:25:31] everything they put out, there's stuff I
[1:25:33] wouldn't read from them. Well, what do
[1:25:35] we do? We pick and choose to make
[1:25:37] ourselves look
[1:25:38] better. It's just an attempt to make
[1:25:40] ourselves righteous when it's his
[1:25:42] righteousness is all that matters.
[1:25:44] You can't listen to music if it's not
[1:25:46] being sung by a message
[1:25:49] believer. Why? They don't have the Holy
[1:25:52] Ghost. Church, you're the filter, not
[1:25:54] them. You're the filter, not them. I
[1:25:57] won't list the name. You know the
[1:25:58] brother. He said to me, "Brother John, I
[1:26:00] can't listen to anything that's not sung
[1:26:02] by a message believer." But he doesn't
[1:26:04] preach that. He says, "I personally
[1:26:06] can't do it." He says, "But we've got a
[1:26:07] brother in our church that goes out and
[1:26:09] gets it, brings it in, cleans it up." He
[1:26:12] says, "And I'll listen to that all day
[1:26:13] long. It's the exact same song. He just
[1:26:16] can't take it
[1:26:18] raw." I have a ton of respect for that
[1:26:20] man to say, "For me, I can't do it." But
[1:26:23] I sure appreciate somebody that can go
[1:26:25] and make it into something that I can
[1:26:27] enjoy. Somebody's got to go out there
[1:26:29] and get
[1:26:30] dirty for his benefit. But that person
[1:26:34] that gets dirty has to make sure that
[1:26:36] they aren't truly getting dirty, that
[1:26:38] they're not not getting caught up in the
[1:26:40] spirit of rock and roll, of
[1:26:42] emotionalism, of songs that are all
[1:26:44] about us. Have you found Have you
[1:26:45] realized how much that worship songs
[1:26:46] have turned into me me songs rather than
[1:26:48] yuyu you songs? Absolutely. To go out
[1:26:51] and what did they do when they pulled in
[1:26:53] the nets? Jesus pulled in the nets. What
[1:26:55] did they do? He says he says, "I go out
[1:26:57] and I cast the net." He says, "And I
[1:26:59] only take the stuff that's good and I
[1:27:01] throw the rest away." That's what people
[1:27:03] do. I look at what my kids listen to and
[1:27:06] I listen to what my kids listen to
[1:27:07] because I want to know what they're
[1:27:08] listening to. Guess what? Some of it I
[1:27:10] throw away. Some of it I keep. But guess
[1:27:14] what? They've got to learn to figure it
[1:27:16] out
[1:27:17] themselves. They've got to learn how to
[1:27:18] figure it out themselves. You'll find
[1:27:20] that people that keep their babies in
[1:27:22] their house and never let them play with
[1:27:23] dirt, you know what happens to those
[1:27:24] babies? Always sick. I'm not saying feed
[1:27:27] them dirt. I'm saying occasional access
[1:27:31] with parental uh uh
[1:27:35] oversight will let them figure it out
[1:27:37] for
[1:27:38] themselves. There's a wisdom there. And
[1:27:41] every child is different. Some of my
[1:27:43] kids cannot handle certain things. And
[1:27:46] some of them you could do the exact same
[1:27:47] thing with them or allow them in it and
[1:27:48] it doesn't affect them. They just move
[1:27:51] on. No drums in church. Listen, drums
[1:27:55] are in the scripture.
[1:27:57] David writes many times, "Praise the
[1:27:58] Lord upon this and this and this and
[1:28:00] this." Some of them are strings. Some of
[1:28:01] them are
[1:28:03] percussion. They didn't have pianos back
[1:28:05] then. They didn't have organs back then.
[1:28:07] And we've made those the standard of all
[1:28:09] you can have in a church in some places.
[1:28:10] Some places they won't allow a piano,
[1:28:12] only an
[1:28:13] organ. Which leads to only old hymns can
[1:28:16] be sung in
[1:28:17] church. Can't sing anything
[1:28:21] new. Why? Personal
[1:28:24] standards. To say that no music today is
[1:28:27] anointed is to say that the Holy Spirit
[1:28:29] has left the world. Because as long as
[1:28:31] you have Christians that are yielded to
[1:28:34] the spirit of God, they will produce
[1:28:37] things that are for benefit for the
[1:28:39] bride of Christ
[1:28:41] 100%. We have message songwriters and
[1:28:44] musicians within the message that
[1:28:47] produce wonderful music. But church,
[1:28:49] realize this. You can have a right
[1:28:52] anointing on a wrong vessel and it can
[1:28:53] still produce something beautiful. There
[1:28:55] are songs we sing in this church that
[1:28:57] come from Hill Song Church. Church
[1:28:59] that's an antichrist church. It's a
[1:29:01] messed up denomination that focuses on
[1:29:04] me rather than Christ. But they have
[1:29:06] some beautiful music. And then they have
[1:29:08] mostly horrible rock and roll music, but
[1:29:11] they have some beautiful music. And what
[1:29:14] do we do? We take the cherry pie and we
[1:29:17] spit out the seeds. Now, if what you get
[1:29:19] is constantly pits, I'd say you probably
[1:29:22] don't be need to be eating from that
[1:29:24] pie. That would be my
[1:29:26] recommendation. But listen, if you're
[1:29:28] willing to to spit out seeds all day
[1:29:30] long, go and have at it. That's between
[1:29:31] you and God. I've heard it preached you
[1:29:34] can't own a
[1:29:37] motorcycle. I've heard it preached you
[1:29:39] can't go into the house of a person that
[1:29:41] isn't a Christian. When I was in
[1:29:43] Edmonton, I uh I took on a a volunteer
[1:29:46] opportunity to help immigrant engineers
[1:29:50] because the the the the work culture of
[1:29:52] of North America is quite different from
[1:29:53] a lot of others, especially Europe. And
[1:29:56] so I was working with this European guy
[1:29:57] and boy, he was having all sorts of
[1:29:59] issues. So I worked with him for a while
[1:30:00] and he really appreciated it. And he
[1:30:02] said, "I want to have you and your
[1:30:03] family over to my house for
[1:30:05] Christmas." And I said, "We would love
[1:30:07] to do that." He said, "You will be our
[1:30:09] guests of honor. This is just for you.
[1:30:10] we're going to do a multi-course meal. I
[1:30:12] said, "Lord Jesus, help me. European
[1:30:15] food does not tend to agree with me.
[1:30:17] They've got all sorts of interesting
[1:30:18] things." And I was right to pray. But we
[1:30:21] went over and they sat us down on the
[1:30:23] couch and their daughters are
[1:30:24] classically trained musicians and they
[1:30:26] played these beautiful pieces for us as
[1:30:31] guests. Two of them. They did a concert
[1:30:33] just for us. And then they brought out a
[1:30:35] round of food and then they did this and
[1:30:37] then they did that and we were their
[1:30:38] honored guests. What a wonderful
[1:30:41] time to just show the love of Christ to
[1:30:44] somebody that needed some help and to
[1:30:46] accept their thanks
[1:30:47] graciously without saying, "I'm sorry. I
[1:30:50] really appreciate it, but I'm a
[1:30:51] Christian and I can't go where
[1:30:52] unbelievers are. We're going to deal
[1:30:53] with this
[1:30:55] later." Can't use dice in a game, even
[1:30:58] if it's not
[1:30:59] gambling. My sons and I played yatsi
[1:31:02] yesterday. Five dice. I'll say this.
[1:31:04] When I in our house, we'd ever played
[1:31:06] with dice. We had a spinner for
[1:31:07] everything. What's wrong with the dice
[1:31:09] if it's for counting? Nothing. But it's
[1:31:11] associated with gambling. And so we say
[1:31:13] you can't ever use dice. Church, I don't
[1:31:15] know about you, but I never gambled. I
[1:31:17] have no background in gambling. I have
[1:31:18] no background in guard in cards. My wife
[1:31:21] was telling me her father would never
[1:31:22] allow them to play card games of any
[1:31:24] sort. Just seeing you holding cards of
[1:31:26] any type of any game. He couldn't handle
[1:31:29] it because that was the world to him.
[1:31:31] But if you're not of the world and you
[1:31:32] have no history of the world, it's not
[1:31:34] the world to you. It's just a game. Dice
[1:31:36] is just that. It's a counting mechanism.
[1:31:37] It's not a gambling mechanism, but you
[1:31:39] have it preached and all of a sudden
[1:31:40] nobody has dice in their
[1:31:42] house. Now, some of these things are a
[1:31:46] very tight interpretation of scripture.
[1:31:49] In other words, they actually have some
[1:31:50] sort of a scriptural basis and some of
[1:31:53] them are pure fantasy, some of them are
[1:31:55] controlling and some of them are with
[1:31:57] good
[1:32:00] intentions. Some have a little bit of
[1:32:02] the
[1:32:02] word. Some of them are past are a
[1:32:05] carryover of a past life, of past
[1:32:08] experiences, of past church traditions
[1:32:11] or past worldly
[1:32:14] habits. I I remember um I I forget what
[1:32:17] song it was and I was like and I was
[1:32:19] playing it. Somebody says that that's
[1:32:20] just a ripoff of of an Elvis song and
[1:32:22] I'm like okay. To them it was Elvis.
[1:32:25] They couldn't listen to it. To me it
[1:32:27] didn't mean anything. Didn't mean
[1:32:28] anything. It it wasn't sin to me because
[1:32:31] there was no sin attached to it. But for
[1:32:32] that person, it was wrong. They could
[1:32:34] not listen to that. And they frankly
[1:32:36] couldn't understand how I could, but I
[1:32:38] have no association with it of anything
[1:32:40] else. But it sounded like something that
[1:32:42] was wrong to them, and therefore that
[1:32:44] made anything of it wrong as well. Take
[1:32:46] something like clothing and jewelry. I
[1:32:48] hope we're okay this morning. We're
[1:32:49] getting we're getting pastoral. We're
[1:32:50] getting personal this morning. Take
[1:32:52] clothing and jewelry. There's a word
[1:32:53] standard for that. This is why I'm
[1:32:55] saying, you know, we got on the lower
[1:32:56] left, no jewelry. The scripture doesn't
[1:32:58] say no
[1:32:59] jewelry. But watch what it does say.
[1:33:02] Paul said, "In like manner also that
[1:33:03] women adorn." That word adorn means
[1:33:06] ornament decorate to make compellingly
[1:33:10] attractive. So let the women make
[1:33:13] themselves compellingly attractive in
[1:33:15] what? Modest apparel with shamefacedness
[1:33:18] and
[1:33:19] sobriety. And then here's where people
[1:33:21] say it says no jewelry, not with braided
[1:33:24] hair or gold or pearls or costly array,
[1:33:27] but which becometh women professing
[1:33:29] godliness with good
[1:33:31] works. It's not a none of this and this.
[1:33:35] It's let this be the thing that draws
[1:33:37] people to
[1:33:38] you. Okay? This isn't an absolute denial
[1:33:41] that women cannot wear jewelry. Listen,
[1:33:44] we wear wedding rings. If there was an
[1:33:46] absolute denial of it, we shouldn't wear
[1:33:47] wedding ring. And there are some
[1:33:48] churches that preach no wedding rings.
[1:33:51] Okay. Paul is saying that your
[1:33:53] adorement, what makes you compellingly
[1:33:55] attractive, sisters, is your
[1:33:58] modesty and your good
[1:34:01] works, not your beautiful,
[1:34:04] expensive clothing and not your jewelry
[1:34:08] and not your amazing hairdos. I love how
[1:34:11] you sisters do your hair. My wife, man,
[1:34:14] she can do her hair up and she does
[1:34:15] these amazing knots and twists and
[1:34:17] everything and I'm amazed. It's
[1:34:18] beautiful. It's
[1:34:20] beautiful. But that is not what is
[1:34:23] supposed to draw people to you. What is
[1:34:26] supposed to draw people to you is your
[1:34:28] attitude, the simplicity of your dress,
[1:34:31] the modesty of your dress, and the way
[1:34:34] you present yourselves in attitude and
[1:34:36] life.
[1:34:38] Okay? People aren't drawn to you because
[1:34:40] they want your clothes. They're drawn to
[1:34:42] you because they want what you have as a
[1:34:45] person. Okay. Brother Bram says this
[1:34:48] way. Not like some of these weird
[1:34:50] creatures we see on the street of this
[1:34:52] day. Church, if they said it was weird
[1:34:54] that day, what would he say
[1:34:55] today? Yoga pants everywhere. Flesh
[1:34:59] showing
[1:35:01] everywhere.
[1:35:03] Uh weird colors of the
[1:35:06] rainbow of hair tattooed up. Weird. It's
[1:35:11] weird. He says, "Not that kind of
[1:35:13] pretty." No, that's the most horrible
[1:35:14] looking sight I ever saw in my life.
[1:35:16] That is the perversion that's perverting
[1:35:19] the true thirst. He's speaking on
[1:35:20] thirst. Now, the true thirst that a
[1:35:22] woman should have will be to adorn
[1:35:24] themselves in modest apparel and to have
[1:35:26] a Christlike spirit. That's 1 Timothy
[1:35:28] 2:9. He says, "Now, that's a way the
[1:35:30] woman should thirst to be." Now, if you
[1:35:32] want to be pretty, that's the way that
[1:35:34] makes you pretty. It's a Christlike
[1:35:36] spirit and adorned in modest apparel.
[1:35:40] When it comes to modesty, when it comes
[1:35:42] to the way we dress, church people get
[1:35:44] offended all the time by us not meeting
[1:35:47] their
[1:35:48] standard all the
[1:35:50] time. Now look, if there's a legitimate
[1:35:53] basis for that standard, then we can
[1:35:56] sort of understand where somebody's
[1:35:57] coming from. And so we can maybe have a
[1:35:59] little more grace and we can decide how
[1:36:01] we approach it. And that's the Romans 14
[1:36:03] approach where if a brother doesn't eat
[1:36:04] meat, then for his sake, I won't do it.
[1:36:06] And we'll talk about that in another
[1:36:07] service, Lord willing. But you got to
[1:36:09] realize we've got people that are You're
[1:36:12] enjoying this, aren't you, brother
[1:36:13] Vichel? We've got people that are coming
[1:36:15] out of something and when they come out
[1:36:18] of something something, they're bringing
[1:36:19] all their luggage with
[1:36:21] them. And they may have never heard the
[1:36:24] full word being preached before. Brother
[1:36:26] Vichel, can I use you as an example?
[1:36:28] Brother Vichel comes out of an Indian,
[1:36:31] East Indian background, so he has all of
[1:36:33] the cultural norms. And then he comes
[1:36:35] out of a Pentecostal background. So he
[1:36:38] has a bunch of different religious norms
[1:36:40] and he comes into a church that says
[1:36:42] that you got to go beyond Pentecost.
[1:36:44] Brother Vichel has has religious
[1:36:49] traditions. He has cultural traditions.
[1:36:52] He has dietary traditions. He has
[1:36:55] doctrinal
[1:36:56] traditions. When he comes in, do we take
[1:36:59] him and say this is the message
[1:37:02] box? We better not because otherwise
[1:37:05] we'll make him twofold more a child of
[1:37:08] hell by conformity rather than letting
[1:37:11] the Holy Spirit work through him. And we
[1:37:13] will drive him out in
[1:37:16] frustration and fear and annoyance
[1:37:20] because we're trying to force him to
[1:37:22] become what God will do in his own good
[1:37:25] time.
[1:37:29] Okay, listen. And there's things that we
[1:37:31] do that probably shocked brother Vichel
[1:37:34] and he had to get past that. And I
[1:37:36] guarantee you, brother Vichel, there
[1:37:37] were things you did that shocked
[1:37:40] us. But how do we react, church? Mature
[1:37:44] believers can handle
[1:37:47] immaturity because we've all been there.
[1:37:49] We've all had to deal with these
[1:37:51] things. So sometimes they do things that
[1:37:54] shock us. Sometimes we do things that
[1:37:56] shock them. And we've got to be okay
[1:37:57] with that. We've got to be able to let
[1:37:59] God do the work. And then we look past
[1:38:02] those things and what do we do? We
[1:38:04] preach the word. We preach the word. We
[1:38:09] preach the
[1:38:11] word. Not conformity, not personal
[1:38:14] standards, not church tradition. We
[1:38:16] preach the word. And if they are a child
[1:38:18] of God, they will catch it. They will
[1:38:21] receive it. They will surrender to it.
[1:38:24] And the spirit of God will produce it in
[1:38:25] their life. And that's how you know
[1:38:28] they're a child of God.
[1:38:30] Okay? But if you come out of a
[1:38:32] particular holiness group, they've got a
[1:38:35] standard for church, for dress length,
[1:38:37] for sleeve length, type of buttons if
[1:38:41] any, for shoes, all of these different
[1:38:44] things, for
[1:38:46] hairstyles or hair cutting as the case
[1:38:49] may be. All of these
[1:38:51] things. And we have to realize that
[1:38:53] there is a word standard for those
[1:38:55] things. And then there is a church
[1:38:57] standard. People want defined standards
[1:39:01] because there's comfort in knowing you
[1:39:03] meet the
[1:39:04] standard. But God has left some things
[1:39:07] deliberately vague to test your faith,
[1:39:11] to test your character, and to test your
[1:39:14] maturity to see if you will stand on
[1:39:16] your own two feet with the revelation
[1:39:19] that God gives you.
[1:39:21] Amen. Why? The law of Moses was a
[1:39:24] standard. And how'd that work out for
[1:39:25] them? Not good. Not good at all, church.
[1:39:29] Modesty is not a standard. Modesty is a
[1:39:33] mindset. It's an attitude. Paul says it.
[1:39:37] Paul said to draw dress modestly. He
[1:39:39] said that means to dress with
[1:39:41] shamefacedness and sobriety. He did not
[1:39:44] say your skirts have to be this long.
[1:39:46] Your sleeves have to be this long. You
[1:39:48] have to have a particular amount of
[1:39:49] fluff to everything to hide your figure.
[1:39:51] He said the the the key to modesty is
[1:39:54] how you approach it. And he says it's
[1:39:56] with shamef facedness and sobriety. That
[1:39:59] word shamefacedness means a sense of
[1:40:01] honor, modesty,
[1:40:04] bashfulness, reverence, regard for
[1:40:07] others, and
[1:40:10] respect. You know what we hear today? If
[1:40:12] you got it, flaunt it. Go as close. Even
[1:40:15] within this message, you'll hear people
[1:40:16] say, "Well, as long as it's a dress and
[1:40:18] a blouse, you're good to go." But this
[1:40:20] world says, "If you got it, flaunt it.
[1:40:22] Who cares what people think? Who cares
[1:40:24] what men think? Who cares what attention
[1:40:26] you get? Attention's good. I'm going to
[1:40:28] be me and I'm going to show everything
[1:40:29] I've got." It's a horrible thing. It's a
[1:40:32] horrible thing. And there's no respect.
[1:40:33] That's an antichrist spirit on a woman
[1:40:35] that causes her to flaunt her build.
[1:40:39] Absolutely. Antichrist spirit. Why? It's
[1:40:42] the spirit of a That you want
[1:40:45] attention based on your sensuality.
[1:40:48] That's not what a Christian looks for. A
[1:40:50] Christian looks for
[1:40:51] character.
[1:40:53] Amen. The way you dress reflects your
[1:40:55] attitude towards others. And modesty is
[1:40:58] about others, not just yourself. It's
[1:41:01] about how you present yourself. Then he
[1:41:03] says it's in so it's with shame facess.
[1:41:05] He says modesty is also with sobriety.
[1:41:07] That means soundness of mind and
[1:41:09] self-control. Now Paul said in second
[1:41:11] Timothy he says for God hath not given
[1:41:13] us the spirit of fear but of power and
[1:41:16] of love and of a sound mind. Amen. In
[1:41:19] other words the port this portion of
[1:41:21] modesty comes from the Holy Spirit not
[1:41:24] from a
[1:41:25] standard. Remember what you got to
[1:41:28] realize that a sound mind a a and
[1:41:30] self-control is a fruit of the spirit.
[1:41:33] You cannot have true self-control
[1:41:35] without the Holy Spirit.
[1:41:38] So that means that you go into this this
[1:41:41] idea of a sound mind. It's not a
[1:41:43] standard. It speaks of self-control. And
[1:41:45] so you know the effect that you could
[1:41:47] have on people and you choose not to use
[1:41:51] it. Okay? You know the weaknesses of
[1:41:54] others, sensual and
[1:41:58] jealous sisters. I hate to say this.
[1:42:01] Sometimes we get
[1:42:03] caddyy. And it's simple jealousy that
[1:42:05] causes it because you wish that you
[1:42:08] could dress that way. But mommy won't
[1:42:11] let you. Daddy won't let you. Your
[1:42:12] husband won't let you. What will the
[1:42:14] church say? And there's nothing wrong
[1:42:15] with how that sister is dressing. You
[1:42:17] just wish you could do
[1:42:19] it. It's the honest truth. Seen it,
[1:42:23] dealt with
[1:42:25] it. Sometimes it's about dressing in a
[1:42:28] way that's a higher standard so as not
[1:42:30] to offend. And that's out of respect.
[1:42:34] and that's okay. But that's a personal
[1:42:36] decision. That's not a church decision.
[1:42:38] Okay? We'll touch on that part a little
[1:42:40] bit later, Lord willing. Then Paul says,
[1:42:42] "You have to be modest." That means
[1:42:44] respectable, virtuous, and decent. Now,
[1:42:48] church, that is absolutely up to
[1:42:51] personal
[1:42:54] interpretation. What is respectable
[1:42:56] today and what was respectable in
[1:42:57] brother Brandham's day is actually quite
[1:42:58] different. What has
[1:43:03] changed? Used to be a woman couldn't
[1:43:05] show her ankles. I can see all your
[1:43:07] sisters ankles today. I'm pretty
[1:43:09] sure. Were they right? And are we
[1:43:14] wrong? So why is it wrong if it's now
[1:43:16] the shin bone instead of the
[1:43:18] ankle
[1:43:20] tradition? But I'm going to talk about
[1:43:21] this a little bit.
[1:43:23] Okay. Some people preach you can't wear
[1:43:25] short sleeves for modesty.
[1:43:28] Some people preach that your skirt or
[1:43:29] your dress has to go to your ankles.
[1:43:32] Some people preach it has to go below
[1:43:33] your knees. Some people preach you can't
[1:43:35] have a
[1:43:39] slit. Many of these things are not in
[1:43:41] and of themselves scriptural, but you
[1:43:43] can tie them back to a principle. Okay?
[1:43:47] We're looking at the principle, not on
[1:43:49] what you do because it ought to line up
[1:43:52] with the word of God. Let's talk about
[1:43:53] lengths of skirts.
[1:43:56] The sisters all
[1:43:58] grimaced. Church, we're here about no
[1:44:01] room for fear. Not here to preach a
[1:44:03] standard. I'm here to preach the word of
[1:44:05] God. I don't have a word standard for
[1:44:08] the length of your skirt because there
[1:44:10] is
[1:44:11] none. None. There is none. What there is
[1:44:15] church is a requirement for modesty.
[1:44:18] Okay? So that's where that means your
[1:44:20] clothing needs to suit your activity.
[1:44:24] So, if you're out playing
[1:44:26] sports, what does your clothing need to
[1:44:28] be? Loose, not form fitting, allowing
[1:44:32] you to move without revealing your body
[1:44:35] shape. Okay, if you're just walking
[1:44:37] around in the mall or at the workplace,
[1:44:39] guess what? It doesn't have to be super
[1:44:41] loose cuz you don't need to move around
[1:44:43] that much. If you know you're going to
[1:44:45] be bending over all day, are you going
[1:44:47] to wear a loose blouse that flops open?
[1:44:50] No. Wear one that's tightly fitted at
[1:44:52] the top.
[1:44:54] not tightly fitted around you that's
[1:44:56] close to the neck so that as you bend
[1:44:57] over you don't have to constantly do
[1:44:59] this because eventually you're going to
[1:45:00] forget right you make your clothing to
[1:45:03] suit how you're going to be spending
[1:45:04] your day and air on the side of caution
[1:45:08] rather than
[1:45:09] liberty is that good will that work okay
[1:45:14] whatever you're doing you ought to be
[1:45:16] able to do it unconsciously and without
[1:45:19] adjustment to maintain your modesty
[1:45:24] That's the standard because the standard
[1:45:26] is not length of skirt. The standard is
[1:45:28] be
[1:45:29] modest. So whatever you wear, you have
[1:45:32] to be able to maintain modesty. So most
[1:45:35] preachers preach keep your skirts below
[1:45:37] the knee. Why is there a standard? Is
[1:45:41] there a scripture that says below the
[1:45:42] knee? No. To be modest, it means that
[1:45:45] you can do anything common to your day
[1:45:48] in a skirt below the knee. Because at
[1:45:50] some point you're going to sit down. And
[1:45:53] if it is above your
[1:45:54] knee, your skirt is now here. And guess
[1:45:58] what? Every brother in this church has
[1:45:59] been flashed at some point by somebody.
[1:46:02] Why? They were standing and they were
[1:46:05] perfectly modest. But as soon as they
[1:46:07] sat down and they forgot to keep their
[1:46:09] legs closed, people saw things they
[1:46:12] shouldn't be seeing. That's why we
[1:46:13] preach it. We're not preaching it as a
[1:46:15] length standard. We're preaching it as a
[1:46:18] modesty standard. But what happens is
[1:46:21] that people take it and it's preached as
[1:46:22] a law and they forget that the key here
[1:46:26] is modesty, not
[1:46:28] length. If you have to be conscious of
[1:46:30] what you're wearing, you probably
[1:46:32] shouldn't be wearing it. Okay? This is
[1:46:35] practical preaching this morning. Okay?
[1:46:37] This is pastoral preaching. If you got
[1:46:39] to think about what you're wearing to do
[1:46:41] what you're going to do, change it. Make
[1:46:44] it appropriate for what you're going to
[1:46:45] do. A modest approach will bring the
[1:46:47] right result every time. And then you
[1:46:49] don't have to worry about it. You don't
[1:46:50] even have to think about it if you do it
[1:46:52] that way. But when we preach to our
[1:46:54] sisters, wear skirts or dresses because
[1:46:56] those are women's clothes and they're
[1:46:58] not allowed to wear women's clothes.
[1:47:00] What we do is we preach it as a law and
[1:47:02] it becomes that if you wear a skirt, you
[1:47:03] are automatically
[1:47:05] modest. Church, you're not modest just
[1:47:07] because you wear a skirt. You can wear
[1:47:08] pants and be
[1:47:10] modest. Not many these days, but you
[1:47:12] can. You can have loose fitting trousers
[1:47:15] and be modest. It just hangs. It hangs
[1:47:18] the same way a skirt does. There are
[1:47:19] sisters that ride and they wear these
[1:47:21] kulots or whatever, which is big baggy
[1:47:23] pants. It looks like a skirt, but it
[1:47:25] allows them to to to to sit a straddle a
[1:47:27] horse, but it doesn't show any of their
[1:47:30] form. Skirt is not about modesty. Skirt
[1:47:33] is about the requirement that you not
[1:47:34] wear garments that pertain to a man
[1:47:36] because it's an abomination to God. But
[1:47:38] what happens is we preach skirts,
[1:47:39] skirts, dresses, dresses, and the women
[1:47:41] say, "That's what makes me modest." No.
[1:47:43] Because if you've ever been around this
[1:47:45] message, you'll see sisters that are
[1:47:47] wearing skintight skirts and they say,
[1:47:50] "I'm wearing a skirt, therefore I'm
[1:47:52] good." No. You're immodest, sister.
[1:47:55] You've met one law, but you've conflated
[1:47:57] it with the modesty
[1:47:58] law, and you've gone completely
[1:48:00] overboard. And so you got men in church
[1:48:02] having to hide their eyes and look the
[1:48:03] different ways and different things so
[1:48:04] that they don't see things they're not
[1:48:06] intended to see.
[1:48:09] If you wear a tight and revealing
[1:48:10] clothing, you miss the point, which is
[1:48:12] to protect yourself and protect others
[1:48:15] from unwanted attention or or the
[1:48:17] things. And church, you can you can
[1:48:18] dress in a skirt. You can you can you
[1:48:20] can dress in a dress and still be a
[1:48:22] modest. You can dress in a nonrevealing
[1:48:25] loose fit clothing and still be a
[1:48:29] modest because it's an attitude, not
[1:48:32] just a standard.
[1:48:34] I've met sisters and they're flirtatious
[1:48:37] and they're bubbly and
[1:48:40] they'll why they're immodest in their
[1:48:43] approach, not just in their
[1:48:45] clothing. There are sisters that post
[1:48:48] pictures, my wife, you know, show me
[1:48:49] this one or that one. I'm like, good
[1:48:50] lord, that woman is definitely not
[1:48:52] modest. Her clothing may be modest, but
[1:48:54] her posture and her approach to taking
[1:48:55] pictures is completely
[1:48:58] immodest. I'm sure we've all seen it and
[1:49:00] all dealt with it.
[1:49:03] church. What happens when we preach just
[1:49:04] the standard? You get standard
[1:49:07] meters, standard bearers. You get
[1:49:10] legalistic
[1:49:11] people. You get people that are focused
[1:49:14] on appearance. You get people that are
[1:49:16] focused on the outward rather than the
[1:49:18] inward. You get people that are focused
[1:49:19] on being by the
[1:49:21] book. This is how we're supposed to be
[1:49:23] by the book. Not by a written code of
[1:49:26] conduct for this church or an unwritten
[1:49:28] code of conduct. By the word. That's how
[1:49:30] we're supposed to be by the book. Amen.
[1:49:33] And the problem is when we have our
[1:49:34] unwritten but spoken words of conduct,
[1:49:38] it's a letter that kills because there's
[1:49:40] no spirit behind it to make it live in
[1:49:42] the
[1:49:43] people. We move beyond the law of sin
[1:49:45] and death, remember? And we move to the
[1:49:47] law of the spirit of life in Christ. And
[1:49:49] that's where there's liberty to serve
[1:49:51] him rather than get beat over the head
[1:49:54] by dos and don'ts constantly. We've all
[1:49:56] experienced it. We go to a church and
[1:49:57] they have a a certain expectation.
[1:50:01] I've told the story before. My wife and
[1:50:02] I when we were courting, we went some to
[1:50:04] some special meetings and and we had
[1:50:06] some issues and so we got there late.
[1:50:07] And so as we filed in, we just sat down
[1:50:09] in the order we sat we came in in, which
[1:50:11] meant that I sat next to my wife. Again,
[1:50:13] we were just courting. We're in church.
[1:50:15] Brother Brandham took his girlfriend to
[1:50:16] church, sat next to her. There's nothing
[1:50:19] wrong with it. There's no word standard
[1:50:21] for it. But guess what? By the end of
[1:50:23] that service, I had a man right here
[1:50:25] spitting in my face preaching about it.
[1:50:27] Was that comfortable? No. That man's
[1:50:29] also no longer serving the
[1:50:33] Lord. But what is it? We get all worked
[1:50:37] up in something and we start
[1:50:40] hammering. And guess what? Hammering
[1:50:42] doesn't give a new birth. It is the call
[1:50:45] of
[1:50:46] God, not the punching of God that's
[1:50:49] going to save our children. It's going
[1:50:51] to save our families. It's the wooing of
[1:50:53] the Holy Spirit. It comes with
[1:50:55] conviction, not condemnation.
[1:50:58] It comes with redemption, not with
[1:51:01] judgment. To reject it is to go into
[1:51:03] judgment, but he does not lead with
[1:51:04] judgment. He He leads with redemption.
[1:51:06] He leads with mercy. He leads with
[1:51:08] grace. Amen. Brother Bram says this. He
[1:51:12] says, "See, the holiness people began to
[1:51:16] say, holiness people,
[1:51:18] Pentecostal, the woman must wear long
[1:51:20] hair and long sleeves and all these
[1:51:22] things and long skirts and not wear any
[1:51:24] wedding rings or jewelry of any kind."
[1:51:26] He says, "See, it became a
[1:51:29] selfrighteous
[1:51:31] holiness." He says, "See, that's
[1:51:35] manufactured holiness." And look what's
[1:51:38] happened to the denomination. He says,
[1:51:39] "Now they've all got cut hair like the
[1:51:41] Pentecostals and so forth. And they all
[1:51:43] nearly wearing rings and so forth. Look
[1:51:45] at the Pentecostals years ago. How they
[1:51:46] harped on that. We're the church. We're
[1:51:48] the church." What is it? What changed?
[1:51:50] They made the rules so they could unmake
[1:51:52] the rules. It was their ideas, not God's
[1:51:55] ideas. It was their standard, not God's
[1:51:56] standard. And what happened? The
[1:51:58] standard fell apart. He says, "And now
[1:51:59] you're worse than you were at the
[1:52:01] beginning because you went overboard.
[1:52:02] You fell from it and you went way past
[1:52:04] where you were at the very
[1:52:05] start." Okay? You know what brother said
[1:52:08] about Martin Luther? What was what was
[1:52:10] amazing about Martin Luther? He didn't
[1:52:12] get caught up in the fanaticism that
[1:52:14] followed his
[1:52:15] message. And I'm telling you this
[1:52:18] morning, there is fanaticism that has
[1:52:20] followed this message. And it had
[1:52:22] nothing to do with the message the
[1:52:23] prophet got brought. It is not part of
[1:52:26] the restored word. It's part of man's
[1:52:28] ideas and it's bringing a denominational
[1:52:31] thinking into the
[1:52:32] church. Brother says this. He says the
[1:52:36] church is Christ's body. It's an
[1:52:39] individual amongst other individuals
[1:52:42] that is born in the kingdom of God. He
[1:52:44] says that comes from the inside
[1:52:47] out. It's automatically lived.
[1:52:51] He says you don't ask a sheep to to
[1:52:53] manufacture wool. The sheep don't have
[1:52:55] to manufacture wool. He says now he say
[1:52:57] now my master wants me to have some wool
[1:52:59] this year. I have to get busy. No, the
[1:53:01] only thing he has to do is just remain a
[1:53:03] sheep. That's right. The wool will
[1:53:04] automatically come. He says and we're
[1:53:07] not asked to manufacture fruits. We're
[1:53:09] supposed to produce fruits. See, bear
[1:53:11] fruits. And as long as you are a fruit
[1:53:13] tree of God with God's word, God's word
[1:53:16] will vindicate itself. If you're so
[1:53:19] worked up about it, let it work and see
[1:53:22] what comes out of
[1:53:23] it. And if it works well for you, you
[1:53:26] know what that'll do? It'll draw people
[1:53:29] to what you
[1:53:31] have. Absolutely it will. There are
[1:53:35] people that we all love to be around
[1:53:37] because we like who they are and what
[1:53:39] they have as a person. I don't like
[1:53:42] anybody more in this church because they
[1:53:43] have more money. I like them because
[1:53:45] they're a good Christian.
[1:53:49] because we can talk about the word
[1:53:50] because there's sincerity, there's
[1:53:52] trust, there's a
[1:53:55] reality. That's what I value. I don't
[1:53:58] care about how much money you
[1:54:01] make. I care about is the Lord alive and
[1:54:03] well in your heart and can I see that
[1:54:05] day by day. That's what draws me to
[1:54:07] people.
[1:54:09] Amen. He says as long as you are a fruit
[1:54:12] tree of God with God's word, God's word
[1:54:13] will vindicate itself. It'll bear fruit
[1:54:15] as long as the word is in there. Jesus
[1:54:17] said if you abide in me in my word and
[1:54:19] you ask what you will and it shall be
[1:54:20] done. See you don't manufacture it. He
[1:54:22] says you work yourself not up to it.
[1:54:24] It's actually there and goes on and
[1:54:28] on. So what is our requirement parents?
[1:54:31] What is our requirement
[1:54:34] preachers? Is it to lay down a
[1:54:36] standard? No. Our requirement is to
[1:54:40] preach and live the word and let the
[1:54:43] fruit come on its own. They've got to
[1:54:45] get tied into the vine themselves. Okay?
[1:54:48] Not opinions only, not good intentions
[1:54:51] only. The word is what is front and
[1:54:55] center. Church, what happens when we
[1:54:57] preach results without the source of
[1:54:59] life to go with it? Frustrated children,
[1:55:03] frustrated members of the
[1:55:05] church because they don't have it to do
[1:55:07] it in the first place. And the funny
[1:55:10] thing is, nobody ever made us do it. I
[1:55:12] mean, I look at brother Mark and Brother
[1:55:14] Bob. You had your opportunity to grow
[1:55:16] and learn, but now when you're raising
[1:55:18] it, the expectation is the kids will
[1:55:20] automatically do it. No, they need a new
[1:55:22] birth. Just like every one of us needed
[1:55:23] a new birth. Listen, we're all born in
[1:55:25] sin, shaped in iniquity, come to the
[1:55:27] world speaking lies, we all need a new
[1:55:30] birth. Amen. So what happens is if we
[1:55:32] preach the requirement of the word
[1:55:35] without the life of the word, you end up
[1:55:37] with people that are
[1:55:38] unfulfilled, unhappy, or secretly
[1:55:42] rebellious. And what happens is they
[1:55:44] walk away if they never get the life
[1:55:47] because they're just sitting there
[1:55:48] having to do something that's not
[1:55:49] natural to them. You'll find, you know,
[1:55:51] there are
[1:55:53] people, my wife and I were talking about
[1:55:55] this the other day, Christians that just
[1:55:57] seem to be unhappy with living the
[1:55:59] Christian life.
[1:56:01] You know why that often is, church? Is
[1:56:03] because they're living by a standard
[1:56:05] instead of by the
[1:56:07] life. So many times, so many times. I
[1:56:12] was listening to be not afraid this
[1:56:14] morning. Now, it made me think of like
[1:56:16] down in the mouth. If we're down in the
[1:56:17] mouth all the time, we got a
[1:56:19] problem. Brother Bam said this. I
[1:56:21] believe that happiness goes with
[1:56:23] Christians. I never been sad I was a
[1:56:26] Christian. I'm always happy I'm a
[1:56:28] Christian. He didn't say moments are
[1:56:29] always filled with happiness. He says
[1:56:31] I'm happy with who I am. I'm happy with
[1:56:33] what God has done in my life. I don't
[1:56:35] have to be down in the mouth because I
[1:56:36] don't have this and I don't have that
[1:56:37] and I don't do this and everybody else
[1:56:39] does. Listen, there ought to be a joy of
[1:56:41] salvation in the life of a believer that
[1:56:44] comes from a daily personal connection
[1:56:46] with Jesus Christ. That's our joy.
[1:56:49] That's our rest. That's our peace. But
[1:56:51] as parents, as as preachers even, we
[1:56:53] have the best of intentions many times.
[1:56:55] And those intentions are to get results
[1:56:58] and keep people
[1:57:01] safe, to clean them, to protect them.
[1:57:04] But the problem is, as he's pointing out
[1:57:06] here, there's got to be an inner work
[1:57:08] that produces an outward work, but all
[1:57:11] we can see is the outward work so we
[1:57:12] focus on outward results. He's saying,
[1:57:15] you got to get them cleaned on the
[1:57:16] inside so it'll produce wool on the
[1:57:18] outside. They've got to be a sheep
[1:57:19] before they can become they can produce
[1:57:21] what sheep produce. So, we don't push
[1:57:23] them to be a sheep before they're a
[1:57:25] sheep. They've got to come to life
[1:57:28] first. How do we do that? We do it by
[1:57:31] living what we talk about. We live what
[1:57:35] we preach. Our household, our children
[1:57:37] ought to know. Mom and dad, they don't
[1:57:39] just talk about it at church and with
[1:57:41] believers. They live it at home. That
[1:57:44] they live by the word. that societal
[1:57:46] pressures, that career needs, that
[1:57:48] financial needs, health needs, whatever
[1:57:50] it is, does not take priority over the
[1:57:52] word of God. But every decision we make
[1:57:54] and everything we do is filtered through
[1:57:56] the word of God. And that is all that
[1:57:58] matters. And come what may, after that,
[1:58:00] we're in the word and so we're going to
[1:58:02] be okay. And we present that united
[1:58:03] front of faith in the word of God that
[1:58:05] God will back it up. Amen. We need to
[1:58:08] rest our families on the word of God
[1:58:10] through personal leadership.
[1:58:13] personal leadership. Amen. Because when
[1:58:16] things get high, when things get hot,
[1:58:18] when things get heavy, when things get
[1:58:19] tough, you're not going to rest on
[1:58:21] Brother John said so. You're not going
[1:58:23] to rest on mom said so or dad said so.
[1:58:26] You got to rest on your own two feet, on
[1:58:27] your personal revelation that God is
[1:58:29] leading you and guiding you, and what
[1:58:31] you're doing matches up with the word of
[1:58:32] God. It's the only way you're going to
[1:58:34] make it through those trials and
[1:58:35] temptations. Like I said earlier, we've
[1:58:38] been having some interesting
[1:58:39] conversations in the house about legacy
[1:58:41] traditions and and things that we do,
[1:58:45] but we all have them. We we mention some
[1:58:48] in our house. I have them. That's why I
[1:58:50] said I'm preaching to myself. I'm
[1:58:52] preaching to you because I know you have
[1:58:53] them as well. But the question is, are
[1:58:55] we doing those out of love for people
[1:58:57] and the
[1:58:58] word or are we doing it just to have our
[1:59:01] way? Are we doing it to make ourselves
[1:59:03] look a certain way? Are we doing it
[1:59:06] because we fear what would happen if we
[1:59:08] didn't do it or because we did do it? I
[1:59:11] remember the first time I got a
[1:59:13] goatee. Hey, there was pressure put on
[1:59:15] me within the church to shave it
[1:59:19] off. No, no standard for it. Just I was
[1:59:23] the first to do it and it was seen as
[1:59:26] something that wasn't great. And guess
[1:59:28] what? All we have is beards
[1:59:30] here. What happened? We matured.
[1:59:34] We grew up. We realize it's not wrong to
[1:59:37] have a beard. Jesus had a beard. How did
[1:59:40] we get here? One person's
[1:59:43] offense. That's it. Has nothing to do
[1:59:46] with anything. We'll go into Romans 14
[1:59:48] maybe in the next service. I'm not sure.
[1:59:49] I don't know where the Lord will lead.
[1:59:51] But the scripture talks about if a weak
[1:59:53] if a weak one comes in. Weak does not
[1:59:56] mean they can't handle it. It's new to
[1:59:59] the faith.
[2:00:01] If we got old people that can't handle
[2:00:03] things, that's their problem, not a
[2:00:04] church problem. But if we've got new
[2:00:06] converts that can't handle it, that's
[2:00:07] where we need to be careful because it's
[2:00:09] a stumbling block to them. But older
[2:00:11] believers, we ought to be better than
[2:00:12] that. We ought to be more mature in
[2:00:14] that. But we'll get into that. Okay? But
[2:00:17] sometimes we do things out of respect.
[2:00:19] Oh, brother so and so, you know, they
[2:00:21] don't like that. Or brother, sister so
[2:00:22] and so, they they really struggle with
[2:00:24] that. And so out of respect, we don't do
[2:00:26] that. But guess what? If you have a
[2:00:27] relationship with that person and I
[2:00:29] don't, you can't expect me to act the
[2:00:30] way you do. That's you between you and
[2:00:33] them. But we don't sit here. We don't
[2:00:35] have a list. It's like these this silly
[2:00:37] pronoun game that they have today where
[2:00:38] you have to tell somebody your pronoun
[2:00:40] so they know how to talk to you. Are we
[2:00:42] going to sit down and go through the
[2:00:43] list of offenses and personal standards
[2:00:44] we have before every conversation or
[2:00:46] before we come to your house or you go
[2:00:47] to mine so that we don't offend each
[2:00:49] other? No. We need to be
[2:00:51] mature. We need to be mature and call
[2:00:53] out what is in the word and what is a
[2:00:55] personal thing. But I want to close with
[2:00:57] a final example. I'm I'm trying to make
[2:00:59] this point here today about the
[2:01:00] distinction between traditions of a
[2:01:02] family or a church or a ministry and the
[2:01:04] requirement of the word of God. And I
[2:01:06] want to make a distinction between what
[2:01:07] people have come out of and what they're
[2:01:10] going into because you can't blend the
[2:01:12] two. Remember what's going to set us
[2:01:14] free. Tradition won't set us free. The
[2:01:15] truth will set us free. Okay? And it's
[2:01:17] the truth that we need to stick to which
[2:01:18] is the word of God. Now remember Peter,
[2:01:21] he had to go down to the house of
[2:01:22] Cornelius. Peter has the keys to the
[2:01:24] kingdom. Nobody can get the Holy Ghost
[2:01:26] until Peter goes to that kingdom, to
[2:01:29] that group of people and preaches the go
[2:01:31] and preaches the Holy Ghost to them.
[2:01:33] Nobody could do it. Remember, Philip was
[2:01:35] down in Samaria and he was preaching for
[2:01:36] weeks. Nobody got the Holy Ghost until
[2:01:38] Peter came. Peter had to be there. That
[2:01:40] was part of his role as an apostle is he
[2:01:41] has to go to every group of people. But
[2:01:44] we saw that God had to do something with
[2:01:46] Peter before Peter could go and open up
[2:01:48] to the Gentiles. Okay, we preached this
[2:01:50] recently, but I'm just going to roll
[2:01:52] through it quickly this morning as we
[2:01:53] start to close. Said on the moral, this
[2:01:56] is Cornelius uh guys that he sent up.
[2:01:59] They went on their journey and drew nigh
[2:02:00] to the city. Peter went up upon the
[2:02:01] housetop to pray about the sixth hour.
[2:02:04] And he became very hungry and would have
[2:02:05] eaten. But while they made ready, he
[2:02:07] fell into a trance. So he had a vision.
[2:02:09] And he saw heaven opened, and a certain
[2:02:11] vessel descending upon him, as it had
[2:02:13] been a good sheet, a great sheet, knit
[2:02:15] at the four corners, and let down to the
[2:02:17] earth. Wherein were all manner of
[2:02:19] 4-footed beasts of the earth, and wild
[2:02:21] beasts, and creeping things, and fowls
[2:02:23] of the air. And there came a voice to
[2:02:25] him, saying, Peter, rise, Peter, kill,
[2:02:28] and eat. So, church, this is a direct
[2:02:30] contradiction to the law of
[2:02:34] Moses. Totally against everything that
[2:02:37] Peter has been taught.
[2:02:39] by the word, by the real word, by the
[2:02:42] true word, by the true law.
[2:02:44] Okay? Everything Peter has ever done
[2:02:48] when it comes to eating is being
[2:02:50] contradicted in this.
[2:02:52] Okay? This isn't tradition. This is law.
[2:02:56] This is God's law. But what is God
[2:02:58] doing? He's saying, "Peter, you're not
[2:03:01] under that law
[2:03:02] anymore. It was for a
[2:03:05] season, but we moved on. The law has
[2:03:09] been fulfilled.
[2:03:12] Okay. Now, church, why is
[2:03:15] Peter not so happy about this? Because
[2:03:18] all his life he's been not eating this
[2:03:22] stuff. Brother Vichel, I remember
[2:03:24] talking to you about eating food.
[2:03:26] Remember when he came here and we were
[2:03:27] feeding him burgers and chicken and you
[2:03:30] know, he said he liked it. I I to this
[2:03:31] day I'm not sure he really liked it. But
[2:03:34] what is it? All his life he was raised
[2:03:36] to not eat meat. And then he comes here
[2:03:39] and he's now no longer under the
[2:03:41] traditions of then he's under
[2:03:44] grace new
[2:03:46] grace. And we start cramming this stuff
[2:03:49] down because brother Vichela loves to
[2:03:50] eat. I don't know if you know that he
[2:03:52] loves fellowship and
[2:03:55] eating. And so we start to feed him what
[2:03:58] we eat. And for a while out of good
[2:04:01] grace and a desire for fellowship, he
[2:04:04] ate it. But you know what happened after
[2:04:06] a while? Brother Vichel stood on his own
[2:04:08] two feet. He straightened his backbone
[2:04:11] and he said, "Guys, thanks, but no
[2:04:13] thanks. It just doesn't sit right with
[2:04:16] me. The textures are wrong. Taste is
[2:04:18] good. The texture is wrong. The idea of
[2:04:21] eating flesh, it just doesn't sit well
[2:04:23] with me." Why? He has spent the majority
[2:04:25] of his life not eating this
[2:04:27] stuff. He doesn't like
[2:04:30] it. It's not spiritual. It's just he's
[2:04:33] ne he doesn't like it because he's never
[2:04:35] liked it. He's never developed a taste
[2:04:37] for it. Okay, he tried it for a while.
[2:04:41] Eh, but now once he's gotten comfortable
[2:04:43] with us, praise the Lord, he has stood
[2:04:45] up and said, "Guys, I'm just going to
[2:04:47] eat my way if that's okay. And if you
[2:04:50] can't do something special like we do so
[2:04:51] much for him, I'll bring my own food.
[2:04:54] I've seen him eat sandwiches. I don't
[2:04:55] know how he eats them. They are the
[2:04:57] weirdest ingredients, but he loves it.
[2:04:59] That's the way he's built."
[2:05:01] Peter is uncomfortable with this because
[2:05:04] he's never done this in his life. It is
[2:05:06] no longer wrong, but he is still
[2:05:10] uncomfortable. Is it wrong for you to
[2:05:12] not do that even though you don't have
[2:05:14] to anymore? No. Cuz you're comfortable
[2:05:17] in your not doing. You're comfortable in
[2:05:19] that standard of your own
[2:05:21] life.
[2:05:23] Okay? We could even say Peter has no
[2:05:28] desire. But if somebody's eating bacon
[2:05:31] down the street, Peter is not allowed to
[2:05:33] condemn them. Peter doesn't want bacon.
[2:05:36] Peter can't stand bacon. It is an
[2:05:38] offense to his nostrils and his pallet.
[2:05:42] Poor guy. But I can be sitting there
[2:05:44] eating bacon all day long. And Peter
[2:05:46] cannot condemn me because I have nothing
[2:05:48] in me that has a problem with bacon. And
[2:05:50] there's nothing wrong in the word with
[2:05:51] bacon. Okay. What is God doing now? He's
[2:05:54] showing Peter liberty in the spirit.
[2:05:57] Okay. says, "Peter said,"Not so, Lord,
[2:06:00] for I have never eaten anything that is
[2:06:02] common and unclean. I've never done
[2:06:04] this, Lord. No." And the voice spake
[2:06:07] unto him again the second time, "What
[2:06:09] God hath cleansed, not that call not
[2:06:11] common." And he says, "This was done
[2:06:13] thrice." It was done three times. God
[2:06:15] was emphasizing the message. He was
[2:06:17] making it clear, Peter, this is what I'm
[2:06:19] trying to tell you. He says, "And then
[2:06:21] the vessel was received up into heaven.
[2:06:23] And while Peter doubted in himself what
[2:06:25] this vision which he had seen should
[2:06:26] mean." So he's he's heard it. He's heard
[2:06:29] it three times. He's seen it. He doesn't
[2:06:31] want to do it, but he's been told to do
[2:06:33] something he doesn't want. He doesn't
[2:06:34] know what it means. Behold, the men
[2:06:36] which were sent from Cornelius had made
[2:06:38] inquiry for Simon's house and stood
[2:06:39] before the gate.
[2:06:41] And called and asked whether Simon,
[2:06:44] which was surnamed Peter, was lodged
[2:06:45] there. While Peter thought on the
[2:06:48] vision, he considered what he'd heard.
[2:06:52] He did not throw it away because it was
[2:06:54] uncomfortable with his past beliefs,
[2:06:56] with his current feelings, with his
[2:06:58] current
[2:07:00] desires. He said the spirit said unto
[2:07:03] him, what is it? The word interprets
[2:07:07] itself. Now the Holy Spirit comes down
[2:07:09] and said, "Behold, three men seek thee.
[2:07:11] Now therefore, arise, therefore, and get
[2:07:14] thee down. Go with them doubting
[2:07:16] nothing, for I have sent them." He's
[2:07:18] saying, don't waver internally. Don't
[2:07:20] get all worked up. Don't let your
[2:07:21] conscience rise up. Don't be fearful
[2:07:23] about where you're going to do. Don't
[2:07:25] worry about this shift in your life. Go
[2:07:27] with it. It is my work for you. It is my
[2:07:29] commandment for you to get over your
[2:07:33] inhibitions. Okay? Says, "And as Peter
[2:07:36] Peter goes with the men, we know and he
[2:07:39] walks and it says as Peter was coming
[2:07:41] in, Cornelius met him and fell down at
[2:07:42] his feet and worshiped him and Peter
[2:07:44] took him up saying stand up. I myself am
[2:07:47] a man." And he also talked with and as
[2:07:49] he talked with him, he went in and found
[2:07:50] many that were come together. Church, we
[2:07:53] talked about maturity, handling
[2:07:55] immaturity. Now he's in a place where he
[2:07:58] is in the minority, and a bunch of
[2:08:01] Gentiles are in the
[2:08:03] majority. And he said unto them, "Ye
[2:08:05] know how that it is an unlawful thing
[2:08:07] for a man that is a Jew to keep company
[2:08:10] or come unto one of another nation. But
[2:08:12] God hath showed me that I should not
[2:08:14] call any man common or unclean." He says
[2:08:17] it's unlawful for a Jew to be here. Now,
[2:08:20] you can search the entire law of Moses
[2:08:22] and you will never find that law. It
[2:08:24] does not exist. It is not
[2:08:26] there. God never said you can't go in
[2:08:29] and talk to a gentile. You can't go in
[2:08:30] their house. He never said it. It was
[2:08:33] the law of the elders that said that.
[2:08:36] Now, here's the thing. What does it go
[2:08:38] back to? Look at the principle they've
[2:08:40] taught. The principle that the elders
[2:08:42] have taught by oral tradition is do not
[2:08:45] go into a gentile's house. Now remember
[2:08:48] what God said about the Gentiles. He
[2:08:49] says don't do what they do. Don't eat
[2:08:51] what they eat. Don't worship what they
[2:08:53] worship. Don't plant like they plant.
[2:08:55] Don't have don't do anything that they
[2:08:57] do. But he didn't say you couldn't talk
[2:09:00] to them. But he said don't do what they
[2:09:02] do. But see we take it and we say what
[2:09:04] is the easiest way to keep from doing
[2:09:08] what the Gentiles do? have nothing to do
[2:09:11] with the
[2:09:11] Gentiles. And so they made it a law.
[2:09:14] Guys, we're going to make it easy. Don't
[2:09:17] have anything to do with the Gentiles.
[2:09:19] And how many witnessing opportunities
[2:09:21] and how many testifying opportunities
[2:09:23] did they have? Notice that the young
[2:09:25] girl that served in non's house had to
[2:09:26] become a slave in order to witness. She
[2:09:29] had to be taken out from under the oral
[2:09:31] traditions to give a testimony of
[2:09:33] healing so that a gentile captain could
[2:09:35] receive healing.
[2:09:37] cuz under law she couldn't give that
[2:09:39] witness. How many times we bind
[2:09:42] ourselves from opportunity because we
[2:09:44] have a personal
[2:09:47] issue. So rather than obey the law, they
[2:09:50] made it illegal to look at illegal
[2:09:54] things. They said, "We're just going to
[2:09:56] cut this off. We're going to handle the
[2:09:58] source problem. Rather than asking you
[2:10:00] to develop immunity, to develop an
[2:10:03] ability to stay away from this stuff, to
[2:10:05] keep yourself clean, we're just going to
[2:10:06] say if anybody does it, then they're
[2:10:08] they broken the
[2:10:09] law. What did it produce? It produced a
[2:10:12] people that were bound by tradition. And
[2:10:14] it never
[2:10:16] worked. Time and time again, they went
[2:10:18] back to they went to idolatry. They went
[2:10:20] to burning their children as children
[2:10:22] child
[2:10:23] sacrifices. Church, it doesn't work. I
[2:10:25] can preach a standard here all day long
[2:10:28] and it will not work unless you have a
[2:10:31] spirit of Christ in you to make it live.
[2:10:34] It won't work. Which is why I refuse to
[2:10:36] do it. I'll preach the
[2:10:38] principle and we'll see how it comes
[2:10:40] out. And if it comes out a little
[2:10:42] immature, we'll grant you some
[2:10:44] grace because I'm not interested in
[2:10:47] making you conform. I want you
[2:10:50] transformed. Transformed by the living
[2:10:52] word inside of you. All the law
[2:10:55] makingaking of the ministry could not
[2:10:56] stop the people from sliding into that
[2:10:59] which they shouldn't do. And you know
[2:11:00] what happened church? They started doing
[2:11:01] it in private until they started
[2:11:04] realizing that more people are doing
[2:11:05] this in private and then they made it
[2:11:07] public. Now all of a sudden you had a
[2:11:09] bunch of people that were completely
[2:11:10] contradictory and contrary to the word
[2:11:12] of God living public lives now that were
[2:11:14] contrary to everything that the ministry
[2:11:16] had ever taught. So Peter says, "Hey,
[2:11:18] you know, the law says I can't be here."
[2:11:21] But he says, "Therefore," he says, "god
[2:11:23] showed me it's okay." He said,
[2:11:25] "Therefore came I unto you without gain
[2:11:28] saying, without contradiction." He said,
[2:11:30] in other words, me being here now,
[2:11:32] because God has showed me what is right
[2:11:34] and wrong, it is not a contradiction for
[2:11:36] me to break the law because it isn't a
[2:11:37] law. It was a law. It wasn't the law. He
[2:11:42] says, "So God has shown me." So I'm not
[2:11:43] here in contradiction to my actual
[2:11:45] conscience. I'm not breaking anything
[2:11:47] that God holds dear. I'm here without
[2:11:50] any question of doing what is right.
[2:11:52] This is the right thing to do. Okay. His
[2:11:55] heart was settled and he came with a
[2:11:56] clear conscience. He said, "And as soon
[2:11:58] as I was sent forth, I asked therefore
[2:12:00] to what intent you have sent for me." So
[2:12:01] Peter was bound by Jewish traditions.
[2:12:03] Peter was bound by what his pastor had
[2:12:04] taught all his life. By what every
[2:12:07] pastor had taught all of his life. And
[2:12:09] Peter had feelings that were tied to
[2:12:11] those teachings. Peter had personal
[2:12:14] conflicts, emotions, inhibitions,
[2:12:18] revulsions that were tied to eating and
[2:12:21] spending time with certain people. And
[2:12:23] it had nothing to do with the intentions
[2:12:27] of
[2:12:27] God. Nothing
[2:12:29] whatsoever. Okay? I'm preaching on no
[2:12:33] room for fear. And we can get to this
[2:12:36] place where we think we have to be so
[2:12:38] clean that we can't move. And that is
[2:12:41] fear. It's a fear that if you get dirty,
[2:12:44] you won't make it. Remember what Jesus
[2:12:46] said to Peter? You're clean every wit
[2:12:50] when I've washed you. Why? It's his
[2:12:52] righteousness. It's his robe you're
[2:12:54] wearing. You're not getting there based
[2:12:55] on your good or bad days. You're there
[2:12:57] based on the blood of Jesus Christ that
[2:12:59] washes you and covers you and you have
[2:13:01] his righteousness. We cannot walk around
[2:13:04] in fear that something bad will happen
[2:13:06] to us.
[2:13:09] We go in with our guards up. We're in a
[2:13:13] battle. We don't go in ignorantly, but
[2:13:16] we don't have to go in with fear. We're
[2:13:19] here for
[2:13:20] souls, not just ours. We're here for
[2:13:23] others as
[2:13:24] well. Listen, Peter was shocked at the
[2:13:28] idea of eating bacon. I wonder if he
[2:13:30] ever ate it because I think the shock
[2:13:31] would reverse.
[2:13:34] How did I ever not realize the goodness
[2:13:37] of bacon? But maybe not. Maybe it was
[2:13:40] still a revulsion to him. But I
[2:13:42] guarantee you there were a few Jews that
[2:13:44] fell in love with
[2:13:45] bacon. And there was nothing wrong with
[2:13:48] it. And Peter had to sit there and be
[2:13:50] okay with people liking bacon because it
[2:13:53] had nothing to do with the word of God
[2:13:58] anymore. Have we considered sometimes we
[2:14:00] might be bound by our own spiritual
[2:14:02] traditions?
[2:14:03] that we can't witness, we can't testify,
[2:14:06] we can't spend time with people, we
[2:14:08] can't step out of our comfort zone, that
[2:14:11] we're trying so hard to stay clean that
[2:14:13] nobody can get a benefit out of
[2:14:17] us. You know, when I went to
[2:14:20] university, you know, it's it's always
[2:14:23] been taught get in, get out. And I
[2:14:26] believe in that. I believe in get in,
[2:14:28] get out.
[2:14:30] But I'll be honest, I went in there with
[2:14:31] the intent of nothing touching me there.
[2:14:34] That I would go out as as clean as I
[2:14:36] went in. That there would be no changes
[2:14:38] to me. That I would hold myself
[2:14:40] separate. And that's a good idea.
[2:14:42] Remember what Daniel went into the
[2:14:43] kingdom with? He says, "We're not going
[2:14:45] to eat or drink what they set in front
[2:14:47] of us." He purposed in his heart. But
[2:14:50] see, I went in purposing in my heart to
[2:14:51] keep myself clean, but there's a fear
[2:14:53] there that they would have an effect on
[2:14:55] me. And here's the thing, church. They
[2:14:57] had nothing I wanted. What was I scared
[2:15:00] about? They had listen engineers
[2:15:03] drinking, carousing. They're the worst
[2:15:05] of the worst on campus. And that has
[2:15:07] zero attraction to me. Zero attraction.
[2:15:11] But I'm going in now fearfully saying,
[2:15:13] "I'm just going to go in. Soon as my
[2:15:15] class are done, I get out and I go home
[2:15:16] and I study at home and my wife helps me
[2:15:18] and we do this and we do that." Very few
[2:15:20] study groups unless I had real problems
[2:15:22] or real issues or we had a group
[2:15:23] project. Get in, get out. Don't spend
[2:15:25] time with people. Don't let them get to
[2:15:26] know you. Don't have friends. Don't do
[2:15:27] this. Don't do that.
[2:15:30] And I came out and people knew I was
[2:15:32] different, but they had no clue
[2:15:34] why. That's a shame. That's a shame. I
[2:15:38] had six years to witness and testify to
[2:15:42] them of why I was different. And to this
[2:15:45] day, 99% don't have a clue about why
[2:15:47] John was
[2:15:48] different. And so they had all sorts of
[2:15:50] things I've talked about before. A guy
[2:15:52] sent an email out saying, "You're gay
[2:15:53] because you're always dressed nicely and
[2:15:55] you comb your hair well and we never see
[2:15:56] you around with the girls.
[2:15:58] I had a girlfriend and then I got
[2:16:01] married and god forbid I dress nice and
[2:16:03] comb my
[2:16:05] hair. But he he put that to being gay
[2:16:08] rather than me being a son of God. What
[2:16:11] an opportunity that was
[2:16:14] missed. What an opportunity that was
[2:16:16] missed. And then brother Joe goes in
[2:16:19] there and there's no fear because
[2:16:21] perfect love has cast out fear. And he
[2:16:23] has a freedom in
[2:16:25] Christ to act, to associate, to have
[2:16:30] friendships, to work with study groups,
[2:16:33] and in that to be a witness and a
[2:16:35] testimony. And even to this day, they
[2:16:38] know who he is and why he is. I didn't
[2:16:41] get that. Why? Fear of being
[2:16:45] tainted rather than faith of being
[2:16:48] sealed to the day of my redemption. What
[2:16:51] an opportunity lost in
[2:16:54] spirituality. I gave up an
[2:16:57] opportunity. Church, we are not called
[2:16:59] to fear. We are called to perfect
[2:17:02] liberty in Christ. Paul said it this
[2:17:04] way. And we're down to my last page
[2:17:05] here. I know I'm holding you this
[2:17:06] morning, but I'm trusting that's for a
[2:17:08] reason. Paul said, "Stand there. Stand
[2:17:11] fast. Stand
[2:17:13] fast." That means don't be moved in the
[2:17:18] liberty wherein Christ has made us free.
[2:17:20] Don't let somebody bind you out of your
[2:17:23] liberty. Don't let somebody put you in
[2:17:25] handcuffs. Don't let somebody put a yoke
[2:17:27] on you with their ideas, their
[2:17:29] inhibitions, their problems, their
[2:17:31] offenses, their standards, their
[2:17:34] traditions. The liberty where Christ has
[2:17:36] made us free. And be not entangled again
[2:17:40] with the yoke of bondage. Don't be bound
[2:17:42] by what used to bind you. And don't let
[2:17:44] people bind you with what used to bind
[2:17:46] them. And many times still does. You
[2:17:48] stand fast in your liberty that Christ
[2:17:51] has given you. Listen, we all have
[2:17:53] differing levels of their of liberty, if
[2:17:55] I could put it that way. Some of us
[2:17:57] can't handle being around worldly
[2:17:59] people. Some of us are just fine with
[2:18:01] it. And then there's a spectrum in
[2:18:03] between. Some of us, hey, I I don't like
[2:18:05] going to the mall. I'll be honest. I can
[2:18:07] survive, but I don't go there willingly.
[2:18:09] Some of us seem to be able to walk
[2:18:10] through no problem. Even spend money
[2:18:13] there. Stay long enough to spend money.
[2:18:16] When I go in, it's like what brother
[2:18:17] Barry showed at the marriage thing. I go
[2:18:19] to the store that has the things that I
[2:18:20] need. I've looked it up beforehand that
[2:18:21] they have it. I go and I get it and I
[2:18:23] walk out. But some of you can handle
[2:18:25] that. And guess what? You sisters,
[2:18:27] you're the ones that walk around.
[2:18:28] They're a testimony walking
[2:18:30] around just so people can see. Selena
[2:18:33] has made friends out of that.
[2:18:35] Pentecostal girls. And she's had an
[2:18:37] opportunity to witness because she
[2:18:39] wasn't scared to be a Christian in a
[2:18:41] dirty
[2:18:42] world. You all have it. I'm only
[2:18:45] speaking of Selena because I know
[2:18:46] Selena. I she, you know, we talk about
[2:18:48] this. For all I know, Justine and the
[2:18:50] rest of you are doing it. Sister Becky
[2:18:51] may be doing it, but you sisters that
[2:18:53] are in the homeschool groups, you are at
[2:18:56] liberty to witness even when things
[2:18:58] aren't perfect. Us brothers, I'll tell
[2:19:01] you, the workplace ain't perfect, but we
[2:19:03] are still a witness no matter what. And
[2:19:06] people that know you're a Christian, for
[2:19:07] me, people that know that I'm a minister
[2:19:09] and a pastor, they will come to you in
[2:19:10] times of need. They'll come to you in
[2:19:12] times of questions and times when they
[2:19:13] don't know what to do. They'll come to
[2:19:15] you. I I was telling brother Joe, you
[2:19:18] know, we work out at at times throughout
[2:19:19] the week and he wasn't there one day and
[2:19:20] a guy came over to talk to me and then
[2:19:22] another guy talked to me and I've never
[2:19:24] seen these people before, but these guys
[2:19:26] said, "Well, we see you all the time and
[2:19:27] it's a small gym. I mean, you'd think
[2:19:29] I'd see now I'm there and I'm very
[2:19:30] focused by God's grace, but these guys
[2:19:32] were talking to me. I saw you doing
[2:19:33] this. I saw you do that." I'm like, "Who
[2:19:34] are you?" People are watching is what
[2:19:37] I'm talking about. People are watching
[2:19:39] and guess what? But we're dressed
[2:19:40] modestly. We're not looking around.
[2:19:42] We're focused. We are sons of God in a
[2:19:44] place that is pretty filthy sometimes.
[2:19:47] But we can hold a standard and we can
[2:19:49] hold a witness in that place. Okay. But
[2:19:52] here's the thing. We've got to judge
[2:19:54] ourselves. Because here's the thing. If
[2:19:56] I go into university and I start to
[2:19:58] slide, I've got to be able to judge
[2:19:59] myself and say, "Okay, you've crossed
[2:20:01] the line, buddy. You need to back off."
[2:20:04] By God's grace, I never slid. But it's
[2:20:07] because I never went in. I stay
[2:20:09] completely away. Fear keeps us away
[2:20:11] sometimes rather
[2:20:12] than good
[2:20:15] reason. Sometimes we're so scared to
[2:20:17] make a move because we're worried about
[2:20:18] what will happen. Go to God. Say, "God,
[2:20:21] what would you have me to do?" But we've
[2:20:22] got to be able to judge the outcomes and
[2:20:25] say, "Was that God that was giving me
[2:20:26] liberty or was that a different one?"
[2:20:29] There's only two spirits, God's and
[2:20:30] everybody else's. And if we can look at
[2:20:33] the results and we say, "Oops." That's
[2:20:36] when we back off and say, "Okay, Lord,
[2:20:37] that was me. That wasn't you for
[2:20:42] sure." I said last service, I'm not here
[2:20:44] to say anything goes or throw away
[2:20:46] church traditions or you don't have to
[2:20:48] live a life like mom and dad. We've got
[2:20:50] wonderful testimonies of the elders in
[2:20:53] this church and the lives that they've
[2:20:54] lived. God bless you for it. But guess
[2:20:56] what? Not everything that they do is
[2:20:58] what I have to do or vice
[2:21:00] versa. Listen, we may have liberties
[2:21:03] they don't. And they may have liberties.
[2:21:05] We don't. As long as it's in Christ,
[2:21:09] that's what matters. That we don't put
[2:21:11] on this yoke of bondage again. Some of
[2:21:13] them came out of things and they can't
[2:21:14] handle that. There's too much. There's
[2:21:16] memories associated with it. There's
[2:21:18] people. There's smells. There's tastes.
[2:21:20] There's there's things. I mean, there's
[2:21:21] music I used to listen to. If I hear it,
[2:21:23] I can quote you the words perfectly from
[2:21:27] from rock and roll and country music
[2:21:28] songs I used to listen to. I don't dwell
[2:21:31] on it. But guess what? But I would never
[2:21:32] go in a place that played that all the
[2:21:34] time because there's memories associated
[2:21:35] with that that I don't want. I don't
[2:21:38] have that liberty. My my kids could go
[2:21:40] there and it would have no meaning to
[2:21:44] them. I'm talking about freedom of the
[2:21:46] spirit. And Paul told us what that looks
[2:21:48] like. We're going to close with this
[2:21:49] scripture. He says, I took this from the
[2:21:52] CJB Bible. He says, "Let us live
[2:21:54] properly as people do in the daytime."
[2:21:57] What do we do in the daytime, church? We
[2:21:59] do things that people expect us to do.
[2:22:01] We do things that are right. We do
[2:22:02] things that are correct. In the daytime
[2:22:04] is when people see what we're doing. So
[2:22:06] we live life right when everybody can
[2:22:08] see us. It's in the darkness. It's in
[2:22:09] the shadows behind closed doors. That's
[2:22:10] when we do things we ought not to do.
[2:22:12] Right? Paul says, "Live your life as if
[2:22:14] people are looking at you all the time.
[2:22:17] Do the right thing all the time."
[2:22:20] Okay? He says, "Not partying and getting
[2:22:23] drunk." I'm pretty sure we don't have
[2:22:25] that problem here. Not 100% but pretty
[2:22:27] sure.
[2:22:29] not engaging in sexual immorality. That
[2:22:32] brothers, look out. Sisters, watch your
[2:22:37] books. He says, "In other excesses, not
[2:22:39] quarreling and being jealous." Now, that
[2:22:41] I'm pretty sure we have moments
[2:22:43] of we quarrel. And guess what? Sometimes
[2:22:46] we're jealous. He said, "Instead, clothe
[2:22:49] yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:22:51] and don't waste your time thinking about
[2:22:53] how to provide for the sinful desires of
[2:22:56] your old nature." That's why I said this
[2:22:58] is not a preaching about anything
[2:23:01] goes. To the contrary, completely
[2:23:04] opposite. What I'm preaching is let the
[2:23:06] word of God guide us into where he wants
[2:23:09] us to be in our
[2:23:12] lives. Everyone does it is not a reason
[2:23:15] to do it. And what are people going to
[2:23:17] think is not a reason not to do it.
[2:23:19] We've got to stand on our own two feet.
[2:23:21] I really appreciate what brother Paul
[2:23:23] Laafontaine said when he was here. He
[2:23:24] said, "Huz uh uh parents," he says,
[2:23:26] "Sometimes your children are going to do
[2:23:28] things you disagree with." He says, "And
[2:23:30] it looks like rebellion." He says, "But
[2:23:32] they're trying to figure it out for
[2:23:33] themselves. And you've got to be okay
[2:23:35] with taking your hands off sometimes and
[2:23:37] letting them learn. Sometimes we're
[2:23:40] right, sometimes we're wrong based on
[2:23:43] the the makeup of that children and and
[2:23:44] how they are." Amen. So what we need to
[2:23:47] be led
[2:23:48] prayerfully prayerfully as individuals
[2:23:51] as
[2:23:52] families, as couples, not as a church
[2:23:55] body. There are things that are decided
[2:23:57] by vote, that are decided by church
[2:23:59] think, if we could put it that way,
[2:24:00] church leadership. But so much is
[2:24:02] dayto-day. And we've got to be okay with
[2:24:05] you doing it different than I do it. As
[2:24:08] long as it's not contrary to the word.
[2:24:11] As long as it's not contrary to the
[2:24:12] word. Amen. And then we need to judge
[2:24:14] our decisions by the fruit that comes
[2:24:16] out of them. Because I'll tell you this,
[2:24:18] fear never produced anything
[2:24:20] good. You look at that word fear. We'll
[2:24:22] cover this in another service. The word
[2:24:24] fear that perfect love casts out fear is
[2:24:26] a completely different word from the
[2:24:27] fear of the Lord. That's not the same
[2:24:29] fear. But we're looking at this fear
[2:24:31] that binds us, that holds us down, that
[2:24:34] causes anxiety, that causes worry, cause
[2:24:36] our heart rate to spike at just the
[2:24:38] thought of something. That's not God,
[2:24:40] church. That's not God. Perfect love
[2:24:43] casts out that fear. Amen. Let's stand
[2:24:45] together if we would. I've kept you long
[2:24:46] this
[2:24:47] morning, but I had a real burden on my
[2:24:50] heart. I was sitting in that office just
[2:24:52] scribbling away, adding to it and adding
[2:24:54] to it and adding to it. Was right after
[2:24:56] brother Bob came in, if I remember
[2:24:57] correctly. We were teasing him about
[2:24:59] that.
[2:25:01] No, but this is I know this is heavily
[2:25:04] pastoral.
[2:25:06] It's
[2:25:07] uncomfortable to think that somebody
[2:25:09] could do something that you don't like
[2:25:12] that that causes a very revulsion in
[2:25:14] your soul and they could still be right.
[2:25:17] But it is that way. It is that way. And
[2:25:19] we'll cover that as we go over through
[2:25:20] the next few services, the Lord willing.
[2:25:22] But we're looking at influences and
[2:25:25] principles, not standards, not
[2:25:28] legalism, not what brother John said,
[2:25:30] but we want to take it back to the word.
[2:25:32] Parents, we ought to be able to give a
[2:25:33] word answer for everything that we teach
[2:25:36] our
[2:25:36] children. If it's not word, then we say,
[2:25:39] but if it this isn't scriptural, but we
[2:25:42] do it because and give them the reason
[2:25:44] why, not just the hammer that says you
[2:25:46] must do it this way. Because what we're
[2:25:48] trying to do is what? Train up a child.
[2:25:52] Train. Train means you help them
[2:25:54] understand the underlying reasons and
[2:25:56] principles, not just instant obedience.
[2:25:59] Obedience is the early thing. That's
[2:26:00] what we need because it could change
[2:26:02] their life. It could save their life.
[2:26:04] But as they get older, you're trying to
[2:26:05] get them to understand what's going on
[2:26:07] under under the surface. What are the
[2:26:10] principles? What are the mechanisms that
[2:26:12] God's word uses to keep us safe and to
[2:26:14] guard us and to guide us in these
[2:26:16] different things? And we'll get into
[2:26:17] that a little bit more as we go through
[2:26:19] this by God's grace. Amen. Let's bow our
[2:26:21] heads. Heavenly
[2:26:23] Father, Lord, I pray that you've been in
[2:26:25] this, Lord. Lord, that you'll take these
[2:26:27] words that have been said, Lord, and we
[2:26:28] try and anchor everything in your word,
[2:26:31] Lord, but help them not to
[2:26:33] understand, Lord. Help us to know that
[2:26:35] your way is perfect. Your word is clear.
[2:26:38] Your leadership, Lord, brings a perfect
[2:26:41] end to all of these things. Lord, help
[2:26:43] us to lay aside our opinions, our
[2:26:46] ideas, Lord, our pride, our
[2:26:49] expectations, Lord, even our offenses,
[2:26:51] as the case may be, Lord, and to just
[2:26:54] commit each other into your hands, Lord,
[2:26:57] that we'd have grace and mercy one for
[2:26:59] the other, Lord, that in all things we'd
[2:27:01] hold each other up in prayer, Lord,
[2:27:03] taking each other before your throne of
[2:27:05] grace day by day. Lord, I pray for
[2:27:07] leadership for the heads of the
[2:27:08] household. I pray for my brothers in
[2:27:10] Christ, Lord, that you would lead them
[2:27:12] and guide them as individuals. Lord,
[2:27:14] that you would lead their houses in
[2:27:16] love, not in fear, Lord, that they would
[2:27:19] see that how you do things, Lord, always
[2:27:21] produces the right results. Lord, I pray
[2:27:24] for our sisters that face so much these
[2:27:26] days, Lord, that they would have a
[2:27:28] liberty, Lord, in the in the grace that
[2:27:30] you've given them, Lord, in the spirit
[2:27:32] of Christ, Lord, that keeps them clean
[2:27:34] from these things. for my brothers,
[2:27:35] Lord, my young brothers in particular,
[2:27:37] Lord, that you would guard them against
[2:27:39] every assault of Satan, Lord, that you
[2:27:41] would protect their eyes and their
[2:27:42] minds, Lord, their every part of them,
[2:27:45] heavenly Father, Lord, that you would
[2:27:47] give them victory day by day, Lord. That
[2:27:49] you'd help us as leaders, as parents,
[2:27:51] Lord, to just guide them along the way
[2:27:53] by your word and your spirit, Lord,
[2:27:55] until they come to a place where we can
[2:27:56] fully hand them over to you and say,
[2:27:58] Lord, they're in your hands. They are
[2:28:00] your children. Give us faith, Lord. No
[2:28:04] fear, no doubt, Lord, but give us faith
[2:28:06] that you are leading us by your word,
[2:28:10] Lord, and that we can rest in those
[2:28:11] results. In Jesus Christ's name we ask
[2:28:14] and pray it.
[2:28:16] Amen. Show me your way.
[2:28:22] 11:57 Show me your
[2:28:29] way that I may
[2:28:33] walk
[2:28:35] with
[2:28:36] you. Show me your
[2:28:43] way. I put my
[2:28:46] hope in
[2:28:50] you. For the cry of my heart is to love
[2:28:57] you more. To live with the touch of your
[2:29:03] hand stronger each
[2:29:10] day. Show me your way.
[2:29:17] Oh, show me your
[2:29:23] way that I may
[2:29:26] walk
[2:29:27] with
[2:29:29] you. Show me your
[2:29:36] way. I put my
[2:29:39] hope in you.
[2:29:44] For the cry of my heart is to love you
[2:29:50] more, to live with the touch of your
[2:29:55] hand. Stronger each
[2:30:01] day. Won't you show me your
[2:30:08] way? Set my spirit free.

[2:34:32] Do we know the the the verses as well?
[2:34:35] Okay. It's
[2:34:36] 10:67. I'm going to ask Brother Kingsley
[2:34:38] to close in prayer after we sing this.
[2:34:41] Amen. Remember Kachi in prayer. Remember
[2:34:43] brother Grant and Sister Nikki as they
[2:34:45] try and close on their house over the
[2:34:46] next few days.
[2:34:48] I remember brother Chad and Sister Leah
[2:34:50] as they're traveling today each one.
[2:34:52] Brother Nelson Guy out in central just
[2:34:55] dealing with a lot with this body these

[2:35:24] everything that I hold dear will lay
[2:35:29] before the
[2:35:31] holy
[2:35:33] consuming fire.
[2:35:35] [Music]

[2:35:47] the
[2:35:48] holy consume me
[2:35:52] fire. And all I want to

[2:36:01] Oh, all I want to

[2:36:09] me. All I want to see is
[2:36:17] Jesus
[2:36:20] shineing through me.

[2:36:28] selfinflicted pain and everything that I
[2:36:33] thought gave will lay before the

[2:37:15] All I want to see is
[2:37:22] Jesus
[2:37:25] shining through
[2:37:29] me and hear him
[2:37:33] say, "Well
[2:37:37] done, my precious
[2:37:46] Oh, well
[2:37:49] done. Well
[2:37:53] done, my
[2:37:58] faithful. Off the horse
[2:38:02] again. And all I want to see is Jesus.
[2:38:10] Oh, all I want to
[2:38:14] see is hidden in
[2:38:18] me. All I want to see is
[2:38:26] Jesus
[2:38:29] shining through me.
[2:38:34] Oh, and all I want to see is
[2:38:42] Jesus. All I want to
[2:38:45] see is him in me.
[2:38:51] All I want to see is
[2:38:57] Jesus
[2:39:01] shineing through
[2:39:04] [Music]
[2:39:13] me. Hallelujah.
[2:39:17] Um, can I say something that is funny
[2:39:20] but not so funny? Um, when my wife moved
[2:39:23] in, um, we want to go get groceries. I
[2:39:26] would say, "I don't eat pork. I'm not a
[2:39:28] big fan of pork. I could eat it, but
[2:39:30] not." And then when she comes back home
[2:39:32] with grocery wrap bacon, I get angry.
[2:39:36] And she's like, "But pork is bacon." I
[2:39:38] said, "No, pork is pork. Bacon is bacon.
[2:39:41] I don't understand how no one eats
[2:39:43] bacon."
[2:39:45] I'm trying to talk about what you said.
[2:39:47] So, let's
[2:39:49] pray in Jesus name. Heavenly Father, we
[2:39:52] thank you for your word that we've heard
[2:39:54] today. We thank you for the messenger of
[2:39:57] the word and the source of the word.
[2:40:02] We thank you for the changing of our
[2:40:03] heart through this word and for
[2:40:06] instilling in us the
[2:40:08] maturity of your word. Building us to
[2:40:11] that level
[2:40:13] where we are confident and comfortable
[2:40:17] of who we are in no matter where we find
[2:40:21] ourselves. We
[2:40:23] express the glory of your presence
[2:40:26] wherever we find ourselves. We thank
[2:40:29] you, Lord, that the word that we've
[2:40:30] heard today has only shown us more how
[2:40:35] beautiful there is maturity in your
[2:40:37] word. And we ask for the grace to be
[2:40:40] mature in your word. We ask for the
[2:40:42] grace to grow. Father, let this word
[2:40:46] flush out any part of us that has been
[2:40:50] built out of tradition, out of norms
[2:40:53] that were not built in your words, out
[2:40:55] of norms that have no foundation in you.
[2:40:58] Help us to hold still to your word and
[2:41:01] let us smile daily in the victory of
[2:41:04] your name. Father, we pray for those
[2:41:06] that are here child and his family. We
[2:41:08] ask that you grant them journey messes
[2:41:11] and you protect them in the every hour
[2:41:14] as they embark as a family whatever
[2:41:17] journey and activity they have chosen
[2:41:20] for themselves. We pray for Grant's
[2:41:24] family getting a home is not an easy
[2:41:27] journey but you oh Lord are the home
[2:41:29] that we desire. So you will make that
[2:41:32] possible Lord. I pray for Braachi that
[2:41:35] you give him healing and help him to
[2:41:39] remain cheerful like he always is. The
[2:41:42] week is a week of beauty and
[2:41:44] testimonies. Lord, as we have always
[2:41:48] lived in your beauty, back in your
[2:41:50] light. This week, we shall continue to
[2:41:53] give more testimonies like we've always
[2:41:54] done every other week. day by day. Give
[2:41:58] us more and more, more and more reason,
[2:42:02] oh
[2:42:04] Lord, to testify of your goodness. All
[2:42:08] this we ask in Jesus name we pray.
[2:42:23] Amen.
[2:42:50] Jesus is within me.
[2:42:55] All I want to see is
[2:43:01] Jesus shall
[2:43:24] Well
[2:43:27] done. Well
[2:43:39] done. All I want to
[2:43:43] see is Jesus.
[2:43:48] All I want to
[2:43:50] see is in
[2:43:55] me. All I want to see is
[2:44:02] Jesus
[2:44:05] shine to me.
[2:44:14] Well
[2:44:24] done. Well
[2:44:27] done. Well done.
[2:44:32] I
[2:44:34] pray
[2:44:40] for I want to
[2:44:43] see Jesus.
[2:44:48] All I want to
[2:44:51] see
[2:44:52] is
[2:44:55] me. All I want to see is
[2:45:02] Jesus
[2:45:06] shine through
[2:45:12] me.
[2:45:30] Glory
[2:45:33] every single
[2:45:42] All I want to
[2:45:45] see
[2:45:49] Jesus. All I want to
[2:45:52] see
[2:45:57] is all I want.
[2:46:29] Oh, you
