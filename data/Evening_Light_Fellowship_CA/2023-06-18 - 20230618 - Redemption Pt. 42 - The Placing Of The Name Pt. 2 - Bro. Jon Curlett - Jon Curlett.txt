it never ends Lord we can't outrun it Lord we can't go under it we can't go over it we can't go around it Lord but it's in front of us and we go through it and it's only your goodness and Grace Lord that keeps us in your good will Lord we're thankful this morning Lord we're thankful to be called out we're thankful to be Believers we're thankful to have the Holy Spirit working in our lives Lord God lord we're here to give you the honor the glory and the praise this morning Lord Lord we're here to Worship You Lord we're here to give you our lives in new Lord to sanctify ourselves or to surrender ourselves to you in a greater way Lord that you can be glorified that you could be magnified that you can be reflected in our lives Lord God help us Lord forgive us or forgive me where I fall short Lord Jesus Lord and just be in our lives that others could see you Lord that we could draw all men unto you Lord bless us this morning with your word we pray Lord minister to your bride that's gathered here Lord and around the world where she's gathered Lord anoint men Lord to speak your words Lord for this day in Jesus Christ's name we ask and pray it amen amen God bless you turn if you would to Ephesians chapter 3. Ephesians chapter 3 certainly you can see there's quite a difference here in the assembly in the sanctuary and we're thankful for all those that have put in the hard work and put their shoulder to the wheel to get this done of course the trustees but also the brothers and sisters that came out to help clean up and move things out and we know there's much more work to be done over the coming days but thankful for that amen Happy Father's Day to each that is a father here today I think the U.S in the U.S they did a study that said that basically if you don't have a father then you've got a 75 chance of going into drugs and illicit behavior and going to jail and all these different things you're blessed if you've got a father today amen but if you don't have a father today you've got a Heavenly Father amen you've got somebody here that is that is greater than any father we could have in this world no matter how much of the Holy Ghost they have no matter how much of this message they believe amen are our real father amen is our heavenly father and that's what we're being restored back to is back into his presence amen just a few announcements brother Dwayne Fair called meeting yesterday and just to check in and so he wanted me to pass on his greetings and love to the church here also we've got brother Barry coffee coming in so on June 28th on Wednesday he'll be ministering for us then we have brother Tim Pruitt coming in on July 14th through the 16th so we'll have a weekend of meetings then so those are all confirmed and then brother Andrew Glover is coming in August 28th through 30th for our camp meetings that we have out at the seven-day Adventist camp outside of town so he'll be coming in for three days for that as well so be in prayer for these brothers as they come in and then we've got quite a lineup for the summer and I think thank God for it it's good to good to have the fivefold ministry coming through amen so just pray for each one of those as they're coming in Ephesians chapter 3 and verse 14 says for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth and the length and the depth and the height and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God Amen God bless you can take your seats this morning and we're continuing our our series on Redemption I want to take a second service on this thought of the placing of the name and we spent last service and I'm sorry for the echo today we can't really do much about it they're going to turn me down a bit thank you brother vaishal but I love it in the singing I got to be honest I love the echo I know it's not great for the musicians but I just love to hear the sound just full in this room it reminds me of our old little church you know and that's the only thing I think I miss about that little church is that we could fill it with sound and here we can't fill it with sound we need about another 100 more people to do that but it is I I just love to sit in the office there and just hear the sound just filling up the sanctuary men but um you know we'll by God's grace once we get the carpet in that will help in the past hiding in the pews and whatnot remember we're speaking on the placing of the name again and last service we talked about the name changes that God had given we talked about Abram to Abraham and Sarai to Sarah and Jacob to Israel and Saul to Paul and these different things and we showed how God always gave a name change right before he was going to bring his word to pass before he was going to manifest it before he was going to reveal it before he was going to give the promise he gave a name change to those people and even Moses Moses didn't come in his name he came in the name of I am and he came down in the name of I am come down to deliver in these different things and we talked about people that have been predestinated amen they didn't earn it they didn't they didn't work it up they didn't call it down but God had predestinated them to be somebody to be something or to receive something and it was God's grace from start to finish and it was God's plans all along and I want to stop there and just say this my plan doesn't matter if you've been a Christian for a year if you've been a Christian for a week it doesn't matter you find out that our plans don't matter we can have ideas we can say this is how it would work best and here's how it should really progress and here's the way I see it going and then God comes down and he does it completely different and his way is perfect and ours is not and we've got to understand that we've got to be willing to to recognize those things that my skills my talents your skills your talents your your DNA your genetics your family line your family heritage it means nothing to God it means nothing to God in fact you'll see and I share this I think on the choir chat recently that God's calling for separators not mixers and he separates you from your family and he separates you from this and he separates you from that why he wants to get you to where you'll listen to him and him alone and you'll follow his word and his word alone and when you do that then he's got something that he can work with I've got a quote maybe I'll share in a future service where brother bam said God wants somebody he can put his hands on he wants somebody that he can move that he can he can change that he can use that he can bring to a place where they can do his work where they can be his hands and they can be his feet in this world Amen but the only thing that I have to offer will hinder God that's the simple truth is anything that I bring will hinder God if I bring it in and of myself but if I surrender to him now whatever I have he can use or he can disuse he can choose not to use it but if he picks it up then it's him but if I say I've got to do this or I've got to do that or I want to use this or I want to use that then we can't get there we can't get there we look at Abram and Sarai before they got their name changes and they knew they had a promise the word had come to them God himself had come to Abraham and said you're going to have a son and you're going to be the father of many nations and then from that point on they spent years they spend decades walking around and they're getting older and older and more and more wrinkly and they started to have ideas about how they could bring God's word to pass church we can't make it happen it is God's plan and therefore it is God's timing and we've got to step into his plan rather than try and make it happen in our life because we see that Abram and sarai's plan all it brought was all of the unrest in the Middle East and we're still paying for it today because they got an idea of how they could make God's plan come to pass in their life you can't do it you've got to believe it you've got to walk with him you've got to rest in him and then when it's his timing he's going to bring it to pass in our life amen there's a fine line between sitting still and being faithless and rather being faithful and patient until the timing because if we sit and we sit and we sit and nothing ever happens then that's something gone wrong because God is always moving but the goal is to see the progression of God to see that God has taken us bit by bit and we see with Abram and Sarai as they surrender to the real truth and the real Call of God they started to see changes because God told Abraham separate yourself from your family and the first thing he did was he took his dad and he took his nephew and then his dad died and then he finally separated from lot and as soon as he separated from lot God comes down says now I'm going to do it and it still took years it still took years but God came down and said now that you've fully obeyed now it's time for you to step into the full promise of God and sometimes the only thing that's hindering is our lack of obedience is our lack of obedience it's not that God isn't willing to do it it's that he's saying I've given you the first step I've given you the ABCs and you haven't even done the ABCs and you're saying I want the algebra now remember brother Brahm says I can't teach what Pentecostal baby Supernatural things because you won't even obey the word at its most basic form how in the world are you going to go into what he really wants to do in this age he says I can't do it you've got to do the basics before you can come into these things amen but Abraham was under a Grace Covenant and we are as well and the Grace Covenant is that we won't stop the work of God God's going to bring it to pass no matter what we've done Abraham messed it up Abraham messed up the plan of God and that he brought forth Ishmael and that made a mess in the world but it didn't mess up God's plan it just brought conflict where there didn't have to be conflict and that's what we'll find is as we put ourselves into these things we bring conflict but it does doesn't stop God because God said I'm going to do it and God's going to do it regardless church that's our that's our faith is that he's going to do it because he said he was going to do it that's a Grace Covenant is When God says I'm going to do it and you don't have a part in it as in you aren't it's not because of what you do but often it's in spite of what we do in these things amen but there's going to be a bride and she's going to be spotless and she's going to be without wrinkle and she's going to be white and she's going to be pure and she's going to be righteous because he said she was going to be there and that's what we're resting on that's the grace of God Amen but we've been speaking on the adoption of the the children of God and we see that God was seeking to put his name in a people and he he put portions of it and we'll talk about it a bit later this morning he put portions all through the age but God was seeking to move from this idea and brother bam talks about this in a crisis the mystery of God revealed he said God was looking to go from God the Father above us which he was with Israel to Christ God With Us in Jesus Christ and now to God in us in the Holy Spirit and what he was doing was he was revealing the name which is the word which is the nature of God all through different manifestations and the final places that he's trying to place his name in a bride today so that she will be Mrs Jesus Christ that's the that's the final word that's the final sign to the final age is that we are him and he is us and that's what he's trying to do he's trying to put his name inside of us amen and God put his name in flesh when Jesus Christ was here and that was a great Revelation the revelation of the name of God was a great thing and history shows and brother Branham talks about this that that Revelation got lost and they started to move into what the titles and they started doing things in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit and that was a Catholic Doctrine and guess what everything that's come from them has followed in that almost exclusively they've done it in the titles rather than in the name and then brother Branham would talk about this and and he'd bring it back to to the the church ages and he'd talk about it in in the Book of Revelation that there was an Open Door in the Philadelphia Church age and he said that open door was the name of Jesus Christ because Jesus said I am the way the truth and life he said I am the door of the Sheepfold he says I am the door and they had lost that name and it had to be restored before we could ever come to this place because they'd lost the revelation of the name of God but God was trying to pull out a a place for people and we see that Jesus told the disciples to baptize in the name of the father Son and Holy Spirit and that's where they got off is because Jesus said it and then Peter comes with the keys to the kingdom and he brings us Acts 2 38 and it says and Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and Jesus had said baptized in the name of the father Son and Holy Spirit and now Peter comes and with the keys to the kingdom Peter gives us the revelation of what Jesus meant because God's word cannot contradict itself Peter with the keys to the kingdom that are effective right they are effective he brought three thousand souls to the kingdom that day Peter says do it in the name of Jesus Christ and then they say no we've got to do it in the name of the father Son and Holy Spirit they miss the Revelation there's a revealing of the name and it was through Peter's Ministry that it was coming now amen it worked in Jerusalem and it worked in Corinth and it worked in thessalonica and it worked all over the globe that was how they went was in the name of Jesus Christ not in the titles of Father Son and Holy Spirit what is the name of the father what is the name of the son what is the name of the Holy Spirit the name is Jesus Christ and we covered that last service where Jesus said I come in my father's name brother Brian would say this and now we find that Jesus said also I came in my father's name and you received me not then the name of the father must be Jesus that's right and Gabriel called him Jesus the prophets called him Jesus and he was absolutely Jesus before his birth he even the holy prophet called his name Emmanuel which is god with us then God was manifested In the Flesh in order to take away the sin of the world and in doing so he was given the name of Jesus so he said so Jesus is the name and the name was placed in a man not a church not a denomination not a Creed but in a man he chose to place his name in Jesus Christ he says now we find out then that he becomes the place of God's worship where you worship Him he says ever before he was born his name was called Jesus it was so important it would give in to his mother by the angel Gabriel that his name will be called Jesus Son of God what he was there we have it then this is it alone it is for him alone God's chosen place of worship God's place he chose God chose to meet man not in a church not in a denomination not in a Creed but in Christ that's the only place that God will meet a man and he can worship God is in Christ that's the only place he said no matter if you're a Methodist Baptist Catholic Protestant let me add it message whatever you might be there is only one place you can correctly worship God and that's in Christ remember the scripture says by one Spirit we are baptized into one body that's the only way you can get in is through the new birth brother Brandon would say denomination will crumble and fall Nations will pass away but he will remain forever no other place that a man can find to worship God that God will speak back to him no place but in Christ Jesus notice that no other place God will speak back to him you've got to be in Christ you've got to be identified with Christ amen that's the only place the only place that God chose to put his name and the only place he meets man to worship he says your loss to believe anything else that's how serious this church is that you are under the banner of the name of Jesus Christ remember the scripture says where two or three are gathered where in church under the message of the hour I'm speaking of the words he says no where two or three are gathered in my name there will I be in the midst now he is identified by his word so you've got to have the right word you've got to be sitting under the message of the hour because that is Christ for today is the message but that's the written that's a spoken form but he's also in a living form and that's in the people that are gathered here but if you come to a church under the name of Pentecostal or Baptist or Catholic he's not even in your midst because you're gathered under a different name and the prophet would say those are the Blasphemous names that are identified in the Book of Revelation why you're gathered under a denomination rather than under Christ and you're identified with that because that is your absolute and you can't move away from it we think that we think that this is obvious that we have to be gathered in the name of Jesus Christ but church we have people today that are gathered in the name of William Branham they are they're gathered in the name of William Branham that's the only thing they'll ever listen to we've got people that are gathered around their local pastor and he's the only one they will listen to we've got people that are gathered around some Minister that they're streaming online and he's the only one they will listen to and what is it Christ is not there because they have put that man above Christ the word you can't put the microphone in the place of Christ himself and that's what they've done with our Prophet is they've made the microphone Christ himself that was not it he said I am a son of man revealing the son of man I'm just here when he's doing it is the way he would put it amen there's only one man brings a message to every age and that is William Branham for our age there is one voice and that is the holy spirit speaking to us and I understand that but when he left it dropped down into a five-fold Ministry that means you ought to have five people you can listen to if uh if nothing else five people you ought to be listened to because the spirit of God did not die with William Branham but it dropped down onto a five-fold Ministry amen if we can only listen to one man to one Ministry we are in a denomination and Christ is not there that's it that's it and yet you have churches that are gathered all over the place and they say that it is only my pastor it is only this it's only that you're in a denomination brother you're in a denomination sister if you say it's only in one church one place because it's a global body it's a global bride amen amen we're talking about this idea of placing of the name and we've got to remember we've got to take the right name we've got to be identified with Christ and Christ Alone amen and I feel sometimes this message has taken the place of Christ because people have taken the letters and the words themselves and put them ahead of a personal relationship with Christ and they don't get the Holy Spirit but they nod their head to the doctrines that have been revealed in the word that's been revealed to us and what is it they've missed the person they miss the person like Pentecost stayed with the gifts and they didn't get the giver what's happened is we've got we've got the word open and we take that word open and we take the the letter of it but we don't get the life of it we've got to be so careful it's a religious spirit that's walking around in this age trying to deceive us amen we've got to have that personal relationship with Christ amen we're not identified by William Branham but we believe he is the prophet to this age amen I'm not ashamed of that I'm not ashamed of that we've got it on our website we believe that he was the prophet to this age and we believe that is the one voice that brought us the message that we have to grasp today so we do listen to One voice but guess what I listen to lots of ministers because the same anointing that was on him has dropped down into a five-fold Ministry amen and it's tied to our adoption Ephesians 4 ties it literally to our adoption is the active work of the holy spirit in a five-fold Ministry it's to take us into Perfection it's to take us into Unity it's to take us into a Rapture amen amen we've gotta I believe we ought to listen to the messages I believe we ought to read the messages but if that is the only thing we do we have become a denomination amen we've become a denomination amen because the the Holy Spirit didn't die when William Branham left this Earth he's working in men and he's working in men today he's got to be working because that's the way he's always done it is he continued amen when Paul died the work didn't stop when Peter died the work didn't stop it went into other men and went into other ministers and went into men and women amen and the same things followed them because it was the same Spirit working inside of them amen we look at this name in this name Jesus Christ and what does that mean what is the the meaning of the word Jesus Christ or the phrase Jesus means Redeemer and Christ means the anointed one so this is the anointed redeemer is literally what the revelation of the name of God is it is an anointed Redeemer so the Holy Spirit anointing is what kind of an anointing a redeeming anointing it's a redeeming work Christ came down as Redeemer and his anointing follows down into each and every one of us and that redeeming work has been going on since he died on the cross 2000 years ago and it hasn't stopped and it's been Christ in every word and at every age trying to redeem the people back to himself amen listen I can't redeem you I've said this before there are preachers preaching that a man redeems his family I can't redeem my family because I needed Redemption myself but I have a redeeming anointing on me and you have a redeeming anointing on you and what happens is when that Holy Spirit drops on me then what I become a vessel for him to use and what do I do I point you to where the word I point you to Christ and I point you to Acts 2 38 which I read earlier and I say if you'll repent and you'll be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ then you'll receive the same redeeming anointing on you and you'll go out and you'll seek to point people to Christ as well what I'm not Gathering men to me I'm not Gathering women to me I'm gathering them to Christ who I'm pointing to because the anointing on me is to point them to the one that can redeem them in the first place amen but remember the spirit and the bride say come it's a call it's a poll amen and I see too often even around this message I'm I'm seeing churches that are putting people out because they don't have what they have or they don't have this minister they don't have that Minister and I say that's got to be an antichrist spirit because if you've got the spirit of God it's redeeming people and it's drawing them up if you're above where I'm at then you've got to be letting your hand down to help pull me up that's what a redeemer does is it takes you from where you are to where you need to be so if you've got what I don't have then stick with me and work with me amen pull me up to where you're at and we'll get across the Finish Line together but when they say well you're not here and you don't do this and you don't do that what is it's a denominational spirit and they're drawing a circle of US foreign or more and it's not a redeeming spirit it's a redeeming Spirit until the bride leaves because there's a mercy seat that's there and there's a blood that's on The Mercy Seat that's calling us amen but I don't want you tied to me because I'm going to fail and I have failed and I will fail but if I can tie you to Christ then when the hard times come you'll do okay because you're tied to the one that never changes and will not move away amen he's redeeming you back to you the prophet of God would say this God never takes his Spirit he just takes his men Elijah was taken but a double portion come upon Elisha then come out on John the Baptist and predicted to come again the last days see God doesn't take his Spirit he just takes his men and the spirit's on another man he said Jesus is here with the spirit of God on him and is come upon every one of you that's been born of the Holy Ghost every one of you men and women alike have an anointing a redeeming anointing on you he said Elijah was taken up and Elijah throw down what the same cover that he had to cover Elisha with a double portion of his Spirit he said it was the same thing just the double portion same power he said no more no more nor greater just a double portion of it like Moses when he was tired his father-in-law said to him you're wearing yourself out pray that God would take your spirit and put it on others and he prayed and he took the spirit and put it on 70 others and the 70 begin to prophesy he says they didn't have any more power they had more machinery Same Spirit just more people with it that's all and he says that's the way it is today one man can't do it one man can't do it so if you're saying it's only with one man then you're contradicting the prophet he says one man can't do it God has got his Machinery working everywhere but it's the same power the same power the same Holy Spirit the same Jesus amen have you got the nature of Christ you're going to be victorious you're going to be an overcomer but you're going to be humble because you know that you don't have it all and there's others just like you spread all around this world wherever you go God has his bride God has a group of Believers that are overcoming but it's a humble it's a simple church amen they're not braggers they're not running around talking about how great they are but what are they they are simply overcoming the age and as the barriers come up and as the doors are closed they just walk through them because the spirit of God is with them and every knee has to Bow and every door has to open before that name of Jesus Christ when you're in his will and when you're in his word amen what is it that's a people that's meditating on God they're dwelling on the word they're feeding on the word and Christ is identified in their midst it's going to be such a simple thing Church such a simple thing it's always been simple it will always be simple amen and we'll be looking for some great thing and you won't even realize I'm not not saying we won't but the world won't and most people won't even realize what's happening under their nose amen amen let's talk about this placing of the sun we're going to go to acts 15 of the placing of the name and it says Simeon had declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for his name the Amplified says Simon Peter has rehearsed how God first visited the Gentiles to take out of them a people to bear and honor his name amen remember we're a part of a church and we tend to think the church is this building or this people but that is not the church every Church brother Branham said has three kinds of Believers in it so we can't just say because you're here you're a part of the church you're part of a church where you may not be part of the church amen the church means the called out ones so before you can ever be gathered into a body you have to be taken out of one you can't be a member of the True Church of God unless you've come out of something amen you've got to leave something amen they've been called out they've been separated from this world and then they've been gathered into Christ amen they're gathered where under Christ the word for their day by the holy spirit because the holy spirit will lead you into all truth you get the holy spirit it's going to take you where the word for your day is there are people that got the Holy Spirit under Pentecost there are people that got the Holy Spirit under the Baptist Doctrine because what they were sincere and they obeyed the word but they never stayed there God took them out of it because that's not where his truth was you can get the Holy Spirit outside of this message but it'll take you into this message it has to it has to it'll lead you into all truth we think that because we're in it we've got it no it'll take you into it and you'll see people and they don't know what they're looking for brother random catch this you don't believe me brother Branham said this man he was searching and searching he went for a year after year after year after year and what he started him searching was that he read this little tract and then he said I went and I searched and I went to the Baptist and they didn't have it and I went to the Pentecost and I didn't have and I went to the lutherans and the methodists and all these different ones they didn't have it and he said brother Bannerman says I've come here and he says now I see the truth he says but I don't know if I've got the Holy Ghost and brother Branham says you got the Holy Ghost as soon as you started looking for the truth he was nowhere church and he went through denomination after denomination after denomination and what he already had the Holy Ghost and it was leading him into all truth I don't care where you were when you get it but you're going to get into truth amen but you can get it anywhere you can get it in your room on the back side you can go on the back side of a desert you can be in a drunk in a bar you can be anywhere church and he can drop down and he can meet you and he can fill you with his holy spirit but he'll take you to his word he won't leave you destitute he won't leave you unfed he'll take you to his word but God can save you in the middle of nowhere how many times have we talked to people and you talked to ones and they just come in out of nowhere and they say what happened they said I don't know what happened but I'm here they don't even know what happened it's so Supernatural it's so Sovereign God drops down into their life and boom it's a finished work and they're sealed to the day of their Redemption and God brings them to where his truth is to where his word is because that's where he's identified as where his word is amen listen to this what is it we look at the Lutheran Church my grandmother's a Lutheran and the lutherans had the truth for their day remember brother Brandon we read the quote last week he said Moses had the truth for his day and he was the revelation of the word of God but it won't work today and Moses had it but it won't work today and John the Baptist had it and it won't work today and Joseph had it and it won't work for today the lutherans had it but they didn't keep going with it it worked for their day but it was all of it and they didn't keep walking so they lost it and then he went into the Methodist and it was sanctification with John Wesley and they had it for their day but they stopped there and they didn't keep moving and then the Pentecostals had it and it was the restoration of the gifts but they didn't stop or they didn't continue on and so they stayed there in the denominated and they didn't keep walking they didn't keep moving in the revelation of the word and the name of God but God kept walking was the problem remember we read this we know the scripture by by heart I'm sure it says but if we walk in the light as he is in the light you can walk in light but if he's not there then you're no good you've got to walk where he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin I want to catch two thoughts out of this the first thing is we have to walk with Christ the word for today for today I can't walk and know his message I can't walk in those message I've got to walk in the word for my day and that's why I believe in a prophet messenger for this age there is a word that's anointed for this age to take us out of this world Amen but we have to walk with him we don't walk with a man we don't walk with a church you don't walk with your pastor you walk with Christ the word amen and we have to move with him if we lag behind we end up a dollar short and a day late you don't want to miss the Rapture by a day Church you want to be right with them and what happens if we walk ahead we're premature and what is it we're presumptuous and brother Bram said to be presumptuous to presume is to venture without Authority you get ahead of God doesn't mean it wasn't in his plan but you jumped ahead you try to make it happen yourself and God can't honor it because you've gotten ahead of him if you get outside outside of his light you're in what darkness and you're going to fall you're going to fail you're going to mess up amen but the second thing is that we have Fellowship within the body of Christ when we're walking with Christ Fellowship one with another one with another now some people would look at that and say I'm walking with Christ and that's enough no you're going to have fellowship with Believers as well because this is a body that's moving with you amen we're all part of it we're all part of the called out ones and that means we've got a local body for every believer and I know there's people listening to this tape to this message today if you're not where there is a church get to where there's a church because you're meant to be if you're walking with Christ the word that means there's a local body for you somewhere get to it be a part of it amen I know that sometimes that's hard because people will give us every excuse in the book as to why they're not a part of a body there is no excuse if you're walking with the word you're walking with Christ that means there's a local body that needs you somewhere you've got to fit in somewhere amen some of us would maybe somebody would say well he's saying that's fellowship with Christ but that we that has Fellowship turns into those that are cleansed by us it says us the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin us that are fellowshipping together we get cleansed by the blood Christ doesn't need cleansing by the blood we need it the we turns into us we're fellowshipping one to another amen I've said it before brother Paul hey let's quote he said a sheep that is by itself is only called one thing in the scripture and that is lost lost and you'll find that what defines it is when it is back with other sheep it's found when it is back with the rest of the sheep under the care of the shepherd amen we can tie this to Christ walking in the midst of the golden candlesticks in Revelation 1 and it was Christ the revealed word that was walking in the light of the Revelation for each age amen and we're talking as we look at this this placing of a name we're looking at the name of Christ but we also see that there are different names that are out there and this is the name that we're looking at when we look at these Blasphemous names when we look at denominations in these things and we read in the Book of Revelation about the great the mystery Babylon and we know that's the Catholic church amen she's Seated on Seven Hills which is Rome itself but in Revelation 17 speaking of this woman it says and the woman was a raid in purple and scarlet color you notice she's dressed in a way to please herself the bride is dressed in white pure she's dressed in purple but it's of our own making it's of our own uh preference amen she's decked with gold and precious stones and Pearls having a golden cup in her hand full of Abominations and filthiness of her fornication and upon her forehead was a name written mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and the Abominations of the earth now we can look at that scripture and say well we're not Catholics we're okay maybe we have Protestants that would say well I'm a Protestant I'm not a Catholic so I'm okay but notice it says she is the mother of harlots she had children she had children notice and if you know what a harlot is you know that when she has children it's by many men it's not by one man it's by many men and chances are she can't tell you who their daddy is but it's a bunch of different children by men amen not by the word it's by men and what was it it's the Protestant system that came out from her is the what the daughters of the Harlot and they're just like their mommy they're just like their daddy and what is it they can't come under the authority of the Holy Spirit they're just as corrupt as their mama was and what is it they've taken on the the authority of men because they've taken on the same influence they've got the same DNA and so they refuse one man's Authority and they took another man's Authority and so it was it's doomed from the very beginning amen but there's a voice that comes out of heaven in Revelation 18 and it warns the people to get out why because God's calling out a church out of all of that mess church out of all of that mess out of all of that prostitute system out of all of that filth God's calling a church and that's a Grace Covenant Abraham worshiped all sorts of gods before God called him out he was an idol worshiper packing idols and then God called him out of that amen that's why we don't look it down at the people that's why brother Brown would say I condemn I hate the system not the people in them because God's got children in there still that's why we still do Outreach that's why we still witness that's why we still testifies because we don't know which ones are which and it's God that's going to pull them out but in Revelation 18 4 it says and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of our sins and that you've received not of our plagues what's he saying if you do what she's doing you'll get what's coming to her but now God rich and mercy steps in and he gives a fair warning says get out of her get out of the system get out from under men's Authority get out to where my voice is speaking get out and hear what the holy spirit is seeking seeing brother Brown would say this he says now watch this doctrine of Balaam most carefully notice above all that it is a deliberate maneuver of a corrupt clergy to bind the people to them by Leading the People deliberately into the sin of unbelief brother Brown said the greatest thing that they could disbelieve is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that they put it back in the days of the Apostles and he says then he's right here today in exactly the same way that he was 2000 years ago except he's not in a Corporal body he's still here he says the Nickelodeon Doctrine was the corruption of the clergy as they sought political power amongst themselves while balaamism is the subjection of the people to their system of creed and worship in order to hold them now watch this carefully what was it that bound the people to the nominal church and thereby destroyed them it was the Creeds and dogmas formed into church tenets it was the doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church they were not given the True Food the word they were given the food that came from idol worship Babylonian paganism wrapped up in Christian terminology now you say I don't have that listen to your music Church what's put out there as music today and they're wrapping it all up in the same thing I spoke of this last service they're wrapping up their Natural Music their worldly music in a Christian rapper and they're saying taste and see and if you ever watch if you ever go on YouTube and you look at what they're doing they have turned them into rock and roll concerts that's what it is I said before I said last church I stand by this you can't finish in rock and roll if you didn't start in rock and roll so that song may sound great when it starts but if it finishes in rock and roll it started with a rock and roll anointing and it sucked you into it because it tasted good at the beginning you got to spit it out he says that very same Doctrine is Right amongst all Protestants and it is called denomination nickelatianism is organization humanizing the leadership of the church and thereby deposing the spirit and balaamism is denominationalism which takes the church manual instead of the Bible I was watching something and and it was they had a Catholic preach there and then they had a Protestant Minister there and they were talking about whether Jesus truly had brothers and sisters and the Catholic said no we don't believe that he have brothers and sisters because Mary was such a holy vessel that there's no way that God would allow her to ever be touched by a man so she had to be kept Sanctified and holy and therefore these had to be Jesus's cousins why because they had elevated Mary to a place of worship to where she had to be perfect Church Mary had to get the Holy Ghost same as everyone else did and that's the only time Mary became truly righteous was when she got the Holy Ghost amen she was the same as you and I blessed and highly favored of the Lord in her current condition in her Fallen condition amen and then the Protestant said I'll sorry but it says he had brothers and sisters he made it very clear they were his brothers and sisters so we don't worship Mary so we just believe the word The Way It Was Written he had Brothers you know but it just drew me because they they had elevated they had taken their Church Dogma worshiping Mary and said there's no way that she could be anything but a holy mother not even realizing that Mary had nothing to do with it there was nothing of Mary in Christ there was nothing to marry in Christ she just held she just carried him wasn't her blood it wasn't her it was a holy spirit seed that was inside of her there was nothing of her in it in the first place he says I'm right to this hour many of God's people are caught in the snare of denominationalism and God is crying to them come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins and that you received not of her plagues you see they are ignorant but if the Rapture should take place at this moment ignorance would be no court of appeal from the Judgment of God for being in the wrong ranks he says Harvest Time yes it's harvest time the two vines that grew together and intertwined their branches are now to be separated the fruit of those Vines which were at such variance will be gathered into separate Garners the two spirits will go to into their separate destinations he says now it is time to heed the final call that only comes to the wheat bride to the mature bride the final stage he says come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of our sins and that you the wheat receive not her the tares plagues he says the Great Tribulation of The Sixth Seal and Matthew 24. amen Abraham is the father of our faith and he had to come out before he could ever go in and we're in the same Grace Covenant in our life mirrors his and then we had to come out of something before we can arrive somewhere else and I think and I've said it before the hardest thing for us to understand is being raised in the message home and still having to come out of something I still had to come out of something when I got saved church I believe this message as long as I can remember it since it may be the age of 10 when I was under conviction to give my heart to the Lord I believed the message I believe that it was the truth let me tell you my dad who isn't serving the lord 70 years old today still says I believe the message is the truth that didn't save me and that didn't make me a Believer me saying I believed it did not make me a believer that made my confession that I believed it to be truth but I couldn't live it and I didn't live it and I wasn't able to live it and until I gave my heart to the Lord until I was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ until I repented and until I got the Holy Ghost I wasn't a believer I was potentially a believer but the proof that I was a Believer was when he sealed me with the Holy Spirit because he accepted the fact that I had repented and I've been baptized the right way and then he sealed me with the Holy Spirit that's the proof that I'm a Believer not that I said amen to the word because the priesthood in Jesus name were all saying Amen to the word but when it came their way they missed it completely why because they were of a different father amen Being Born Again by the spirit is what proves that I'm a Believer not just what I say not just what church I attend not just what message I listened to amen I still had denominational eyes we've got one one man denominations one woman denominations all over this world today because I had to die to my nature I had to die to my thoughts I had to die to my preferences and I had to be born again as a new creature in Christ and that's what makes me a Believer is that I have his nature and I'm a new creation under the holy spirit amen because I needed something that could bring this body into subjection that's what I needed listen to this brother Brian says when he gave Abraham part of his name positionally he put his name on the check the same as his was what we'd say today is he added his name to the bank account you go into the bank you can have multiple signatures that are allowed or multiple people that are allowed to sign off on the bank account brother Brown says when God gave Abraham his new name he positionally added him to the bank account he says his is Elohim Abraham is Abraham see he gave him part of his name not the whole name a part of it he says there's a great Revelation there what is it it's all Grace God giving a portion to a sinful man it was Abraham receiving god-giving but it was just a part he says so he gave him his own name Abraham and then when he did that the next thing he did after he gave him that name placed that on his name then what did he do he gave him a sign that he was ready to absolutely destroy all sin that was around him and positionally put his body in condition to receive the promised son that he had waited on he said it's exactly what he's done to the church what a thought Church Abraham's walking along and he's been walking and walking and it's been 24 years and he's getting old and he's getting tired and he's getting wrinkly and his maybe his hair is falling out and his beard is so gray and he's trudging and he's trudging and he's just he's worn out completely worn out and then God comes down says okay Abraham now I'm ready to take even the effects of sin out of your body I'm getting you ready for the word and Abraham's sitting here saying look at me sometimes we look at ourselves and we say look at me would you look at that and then God says yeah but that doesn't matter because this is a Grace work and I'm coming down to touch you regardless of where you're at because I promised that I was going to do it amen what was it it was taking away the effects of sin in his life He restored Abraham's body back to its youth what does Sin do it ages us it makes things stop working it makes us tired it makes us sore it makes our joints wear out it makes us slow all these things that we're starting to experience as we get into our 40s and 50s we're not the speed we used to be but he erased every aspect of that but look at Sarah because Father Abraham is our father of Faith but we look at Sarah Sarah is really the position of the Bride if you want to see that and Sarah he didn't restore her to her youth because in her youth she still couldn't have a child Church in her youth in this sinful condition she still couldn't produce a child she didn't have strength to receive seed the scripture says but Abraham or Sarah's body was restored back to what her place in the thoughts of God she was restored to her place in the word not restored to her youth Church we're not being restored to our youth Rivers being restored Back to Before Our Youth we're being restored back to where we were shouting before the presence of God before when we shouted and danced before God Amen that's what we're being restored back to we're being restored back to the word that she was before she ever existed that's what her body looked like she got a special body so that she could produce at that amen he's restoring us back to what we were in Christ before all this and he says what's he doing he says he's destroying all the sin that's around us what do we do when we go down in the water what do we do we're accepting the finished work of Calvary and the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all of our sins but now what's he doing he takes the holy spirit in Fire and it just burns everything out what does it do it sanctifies it you wash something that gets rid of some things but you put it through fire it takes everything out there's nothing left and it comes through and it not only Burns you out it not only sanctifies you but then it fills you and puts you into service so that you can produce the word amen it puts your body in a condition to produce and receive the word of God in this age amen he said that he gave Abraham a part of his name and why was that Abraham was just under grace in the Old Testament but it was under the Old Testament it was under the blood of bulls and goats and why was it because Abraham was only revealing a part of God and we'll get into this in a minute in the scriptures in Hebrews 11 but this was just one part of a whole family one part of a whole family Abraham was the father of many nations he was the father of a family that was going to come so God couldn't reveal everything in Abraham it was just a part it was just a start of what he was going to be doing by faith through the next thousand years as he started to reveal himself in Jesus Christ the fullness of God made flesh and then he was going to reveal his fullness in the full family the faithful family of Abraham brother Brian would say this he says now the church has come through those schools she married back Yonder a long time ago become a denomination an organization he says but you notice the birth produce something else the new birth produce something else and now it's got to a place where the Pentecostal Church he says with the new birth that's the Pentecostal experience not the Pentecostal denomination has been tested and tried and now it's coming to a place God doesn't deal with the church as just an organization he doesn't deal with the church as a group of people but rather he deals with the church as individuals each individual in the church he says and now it's got to a time he says and it's no secret we all see it when a man proves and God loves him he takes him out somewhere to himself and there in front of angels he does something for him he lifts him up there in the presence of God and Gifts him and fills him and sets him out he says that's the age we're living in the same holy spirit that saved the lutherans that Sanctified the methodists that baptize the Pentecostals is Now setting in order the coming of the Lord Jesus he says when it'll be so powerful that body will come into this group a church that'll draw the rest of them from the grave there will be a resurrection that's what the Holy Ghost was given for the Holy Ghost was given to produce a resurrection and a Rapture he says what is the Holy Ghost he says without us they cannot be made perfect he says they lived in one day under that he says we live in another day what was it God couldn't put his full name in Abraham because Abraham was an imperfect representation but he was a representation but when Christ came that was a perfect representation that was the sinless man that was the perfect one that was the Holy One and God could put his name in there because he was a perfect representation but in Hebrews 11 it's speaking of Abraham and all the others in that great faith chapter and it says and all of the and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise singular they got the word for their day but they didn't receive the promise because there's one promise that was coming there was one promise that God was giving it says God having provided some better thing for us you're saying that what we have is better than what Abraham we have what Abraham looked for church we have what he was seeking amen having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect what is it Christ the overcoming word the resurrection of this life the life of God inside of us was what Abraham was looking for that's what he was looking for scripture says he sought a city whose Builder a maker was God the only way you're going to get theirs by the Holy Spirit by the nature by the spirit of God inside of that Abraham needs us to be perfect these people in the faith chapter need us to be perfect and that word perfect at the end there it says that they should without us they should not be made perfect it means whole full complete consecrated finished Abraham was the start but he wasn't the Finish he was the the beginning of it he was a beginning but God had to finish it before he could say this is the whole thing Abraham was the father of the promise and we are the children of that promise through Christ amen Christ was the promise he was the one he was the answer but Abraham was an heir through righteousness and the promise of the day and he received it but he was looking for more he got a portion but he was looking for more and he died looking for that portion amen but we come to us today and we've got the full revelation of the name of God it's Jesus Christ and God has been seeking to put his name in flesh completely again he did it in the alpha church he did it in the days of the Apostles and then it fell down through the the Dark Ages and these different things again but he's looking to put it now in individuals that collectively will reveal Jesus Christ once again amen and he's doing it in a way catch this he's doing it in a way that I won't glory in it and you won't glory in it why because I'm just a part and you're just a part so what happens is I see Christ in you and I say Glory that's it but then you see Christ to me and you say Glory that's it and then you say I can't make it without you and I say I can't make it with you and so we say well let's stay together then why because you're the word and I'm the word but you're just a portion and I'm just a portion so we need all of those portions to make up the body of Christ and what is it you've got something maybe that I don't quite have not that I don't have it but I don't have it in the way you have it and you're the perfect revelation of it but I've got something else that you don't quite have either and so together the two of us the three of us the five of us the 50 of us the hundreds the thousands around this world together we paint this perfect mirror this perfect image of Christ but I'm not running ahead because I need you because you've got something that's revealing the word as well and you can't get too far away from me and I can't get too far away from you because it's only together we reveal him it's only together we reveal him it's not all me remember one man can't do it one man can't do it I can't do it you can't do it we've got to stay together amen and what is this the rest of those Believers that revealed a part of the word for their day they're waiting for us to fully reveal it to be the collective group so that we can all be gathered together one in Christ the head comes down and then off we go and we go to the marriage supper of the Lamb amen it's the word working supernaturally in you and it's the word working supernaturally me to reveal Christ today like I said that's the Simplicity of it that's the Simplicity of it because they won't see everything in you but they'll see something in you and they'll see something in me but they come in here and that's when they often see the greater thing and they realize there's more to this than just one man or one woman it's a whole body that's gathered together if we go to our first scripture that we started with in Ephesians 3 it says for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named they're waiting on us they're in heaven he's not with them remember brother Brandon when he went over on the other side they said he said where's Jesus they said he's a little higher why because we can't be gathered to him until we're all together it's the Gathering Together of the body bride of Christ amen it says the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named after him that he would Grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith and that you being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend we look at that comprehension and we think well I understand no comprehend by experience comprehend by having it in your own life what that you may comprehend with All Saints All Saints that's you that's me it's all of us together there's no big eyes in little used church it's all of us together going to comprehend it all of us going to experience it all of us with that Holy Spirit in our lives that All Saints we would know what is the breadth the length and the depth and the height that means we've walked all through it we've experienced it all we're not just staying in one place but as we're walking in the light as he is in the light he's taking us into all of the riches and goodness and glory of God he's taken us into all the blessings of God he's taking us through all of these things and it says and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that you ye plural a body a group a church called out once that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God he didn't just say the fullness of God he said all the fullness of God what is it Christ coming down into a bride to reveal himself completely once again in a body of the Bride that's what we're talking about this is this is the Heritage for the Overcomer this is the Heritage for the True Believer in this age is you are revealing Christ to this world all of us together he says we are flesh and bone of him as long as we are the bride of Christ do you believe that he says all right he died for us and we died to ourselves and are buried in his name that we would no more be of the world but in him of which both the family in heaven is named after Jesus Christ he says that's Ephesians 1 21. what's the family in heaven named Jesus what's the family on Earth named well that's the house of God where the blood's at he says is that right that's the door that's the gate that's the place he put his name and the Word was made flesh and dwelled Among Us it's the word reflecting and sparking off the age that you're living in that's what he was that's what Moses was that's what Jacob was that's the rest of them was sparking off that word of God the reflector was God that God was reflecting himself literally he says these men these women were the reflection of God in their age he says and come to that perfect image of God Jesus Christ God's Masterpiece who was struck that he might take the rest of them for a bride that's been reflectors today they have these these wonderful telescopes and they have the these systems that they have now and they have these mirrors and see the problem with mirrors is that it's very hard to make a perfect mirror out of one piece especially when you want to get very large and very precise and so you know how they make a perfect mirror now they make it out of many pieces they make it on many pieces and they can fit it perfectly and they can curve it and they can make the shapes that would otherwise be very difficult with a single piece of glass but with many pieces they can make a perfect shape that gives a perfect reflection it's so perfect it can reflect light perfectly without dispersing it they can shoot a laser hundreds of thousands of miles and that laser stays almost perfectly together because the mirror is perfect because it's made of a bunch of little different pieces and you know what makes them perfect they have a control tower that shapes and moves them perfectly to make that light go just where they want it to go the Perfection is in the control not in the mirror themselves they're polished they're about as perfect as we can get it but what the Breakthrough was was when they put them all under a single controller a single computer or super computer that could manage and bend them to be just perfect so they could get a perfect reflection of what's going on out there many units perfectly shaped for their position in the body controlled by one thing that was the Breakthrough they made you look at mirrors how big a mirror can you make you start going Beyond maybe five or six or eight feet and you have to do pieces and panels but they start just making just these tiny little facets and all of them together brought the perfect reflection that they needed to do the Technologies they have today for lasers and and SpaceX exploration and all these different things it's absolutely phenomenal what they do in the cost cost is in the billions and billions of dollars to do it but they've achieved something they could never do it before what many different little pieces under one control what is it Christ the head being reflected in a perfect body controlled by him what are we reflecting today Church what are you reflecting I'll tell you what you're reflecting is what's controlling you what's controlling you is going to be reflected in what you're doing because if you're on your own thing all you need in that mirror is for one piece to be out of place by a fraction of a millimeter and the entire mirror is imperfect it can't reflect the image just that one little piece out so it means we've all got to be in our place we've all got to be under the same control not a man but the head Jesus Christ the word and in that we have a perfect reflection when we're under his perfect control because we don't know we don't know how to do it but if we're under the holy spirit's control then all of a sudden we get right in line with everything else and it forms that perfect sphere and all of a sudden the image is perfect there amen here's one thing I don't worry if the image isn't perfect today I worry if the image is not getting better every day if it's not becoming clear because Paul said he says we see through a glass Darkly we're going we're growing we're progressing I'm not worried if it's not clear yet I'm worried if I'm not seeing a little bit more every day every week why I want to be growing I want to be maturing I want to be a greater revelation of Jesus Christ today amen I want as we sing that song Lord let the beauty of Jesus be seen in me is it being revealed day by day are the things of this world growing strangely dim that's what you'll see Church you'll see the world getting dim and Christ coming into light in your life when he's working there amen brother Brian would say this he says see as a man he made himself God just before the cross they said to him we do not Stone me for a good work that you've done but we Stone thee because you're a man making yourself God he was God he said he was God was in him and so then he said if you can't believe me believe the works that I do see just believe the works that there of God he says well now the same thing is today he's declaring it's the same thing he says there's no man on Earth as a god certainly not we're all human beings everyone born and sin shaped and iniquity come to the world speaking lies but as we've been through it so plainly this week to show that God once lived above his creature because of sin then he lived with this creature in the form of a body Jesus Christ he put his tent with us dwelt with us made flesh with us to suffer sin and pains Agony and the things that he do he says but then he Sanctified a church that he might dwell in so it was God above us God With Us God in us Jesus said at that day you'll know I'm in the Father the father's in me and I in you and you and me he says and you see there it's God working through so when a person is so completely yielded to the Holy Spirit and speaking it is not the person speaking I know that by experience he says of all my little experience with Christ I found the times that he would permit me to yield myself to him till I didn't know what I was saying he says and I wouldn't have said that for nothing in the world but he said he said the things that I said under yielding to him I would never say in myself why there were two fantastic two Supernatural too crazy to this world but he says under that yielding he says I would say things that I would never choose to say otherwise what's he saying he's saying church when we can get out of the way that's when he can get us into the way to bring us into his path amen we look at this thought of the Holy Spirit and we want to wield the Holy Spirit that's not the way this works Church he wields us as we yield to him we are the tool he is not the tool he's the controller he's a controller and see what we do is is we get this idea and what it is is we get caught up in ourselves as we start to say this is how it's going to be and this is where it's going to go and this is what it's going to do and that's not it why you have to be permitted by God to yield yourself that's the way brother Brown said it he permits you to yield so it's a work of God that does it to the point where you can step in to the place where you're completely removed and now it's Christ working through you and it's perfect in that place and that time because you're not a part of it you're not a part of it it's just him working through you amen he uses us not the other way around amen that's the sign of the adopted son is when you're out of the way and you're only doing the will of the father you've stepped into the word so completely that everything else is separated including our thoughts our opinions our preferences our desires our plans our will everything is gone and all you are is just a microphone for God to speak through you amen that's when hell can't stand before his church is when we're walking with him and he's telling us what to do he's telling us where to go and he's telling us what to say that's when everything falls before us let's stand together if we would I'm going to read just two more quotes he said then what you do in word and deed do it all in the name of Jesus I'm going to stop right there and say can you say that whatever you're doing you can say thus saith the Lord behind it can you say this is what God wants me to do when we sit down in front of our computer can we say whatever follows I can put Christ's name behind it as we step and we open up our phones and we do things on it can we say I can put Christ's name behind it when we go to work and the things we say and the people we talk to and the way we do things can we say I can put Christ's Name Behind what I'm doing today the scripture says whatever you do in word and deed do it all in the name of Jesus that's a high standard to say everything I'm doing in my life I can write the name of Jesus Christ behind it that's how taught him I am with the word that's a challenge church that's a challenge it's a challenge for me I know can I say that everything I'm doing I can be I can say I would be happy to sign Jesus Christ's name behind it he says after that what you do he says but first you have become in his name he didn't say you've come in his name he says you've become you've been transformed you've been adopted you've been changed into something you earned he says you become in his name he says there is many fine women in this building tonight find loyal women but there's only one Mrs William Branham she's the one that goes home with me she's the one that's my wife there's fine people in the world find churches but there's one Mrs Jesus Christ and that's who he's coming for listen to this he says that's where his name Lays that's where his worship is in her and her alone he says that is true now he's not saying she is worshiped he's saying the only true worship of Christ comes through her because why she's got his name the only woman I'm looking to have worship me or appreciate me or talk me up is my wife that's the only one that matters to me I appreciate a sincere compliment from from another woman but the only one that I really look for is in her because she's got my name she's the one I chose she's the one that I believe is going to reflect me she's the one that I trust is going to give me honest feedback real feedback so so a compliment to me doesn't do much except it comes through my wife and another woman if she starts complimenting me a lot you know what I say I don't want anything to do with you because you're getting into my wife's position right you're trying to you're getting close to me you're presuming that there's a relationship that allows you to say these things and more that I want to receive them from you but I don't I only want them from my wife he says the only one that can give and the scripture says that we're the only ones we're a priesthood that gives the acceptable sacrifices to God we're the only ones can do it because we have his name we know what he likes we know what he wants and even our worship he says the only worship that he accepts is through the bride of Christ why because she's gathered in his name she's his choice she's his church she's the called out ones he says that's the only one so you go into a church and they're not gathered in Christ's name they can worship they can shout they can dance they can play their music they can do whatever they want and it's not even received by God why because they're under a different name they're not his wife he says oh yes sir we find that to be true that's why all we do in word or indeed we do it in the name of Jesus Christ what my wife does whether I like it or not it's in my name it's in my name so when she does well praise the Lord when she doesn't guess what it's on me in the end because she's doing it in my name and what he's saying he's saying as the bride of Christ everything you do it ought to be worshipful to him it ought to give glory to him it ought to give praise to him because you're doing it in his name so watch what you're doing be careful what you're doing that you can put his name behind it without shaming him without causing him to Bow his head and say oh here we go again last quote he says he wants to be one with God us to be one with God and God is the word each individual in his heart must be that one with God I can't get you there I can preach the word but you've got to be one with the word The Living Word that's the only way we're going to make a church and I'll preach until I turn blue in the face but we've got to have a heart to receive it and we've got to have a life that follows what our heart says is there and we've got to have a reality of a relationship with Christ if we're going to make it on the other side amen let's bow our heads each one Heavenly Father Lord we're not here of ourselves we're here because you called us out Lord we're not a denomination Lord we're not seeking my leadership Lord we're seeking your leadership by the Holy Spirit Lord but Lord we're wanting that name Lord to be worshiped in US Lord that we will be to the glory of your praise Lord that your grace Lord will not lead us into disgrace that we would not abuse it Lord but Lord that we would take the Grace Covenant that you've given us Lord that under that shed blood Lord we would represent your name holy every single day Lord that our life would sing Holy Holy Holy Lord that our words would say holy holy holy Lord that our homes will be holy holy holy Lord that every aspect of us would be a reflection of the true image of Jesus Christ Heavenly Father Lord unite us together Lord your word said that we have Fellowship one another one with another when we're fellowshipping with you as well Lord grant us Grace to be drawn together each one Lord pray that you have feed our souls with that word of eternal life Lord that we would lay hold of it Lord that we would not let go Lord that we would lay claim to what you've given us in this age that you revealed to us Lord in that we'd stick with it and let it have its perfect work we pray Lord help us to surrender Lord give us the mind of Christ every day Lord that we would do your will Lord and until we found it Lord we would wait on you Lord give us patience to rest and wait we pray Lord bless us now we ask in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen do we know that song Holy Holy Holy are you Lord it's uh just pull it up for the visual 774 just look at it if we don't know what that's

appreciate any uh anybody staying behind just to help with the moving of the pews out into the fellowship hall and that's got to go and we're going to lift this there's a couple of things we have to do we've got to move essentially we had to move everything out of the out of the sanctuary shortly because the uh the installers are coming in tomorrow to carpet the whole the whole place right from that wall to that wall so uh if if we could if the brothers could give us a hand to just do some of that won't take long nothing is fasting to the floor except for that partition which will take take out shortly as well so it shouldn't take us too long so we could do that the other thing I'm going to ask is this you could take everything out of the pews uh as if you don't it'll end up being stacked somewhere when you come back to church sit near a few you may not find what you had when you left so if you would just take everything out and uh and that way it won't be lost or anything else I've been honest to you just move it out okay so let's sing this uh we'll we'll see God still moves for the day where you just closer if you would God still in the heart thank you Lord [Music] he does
