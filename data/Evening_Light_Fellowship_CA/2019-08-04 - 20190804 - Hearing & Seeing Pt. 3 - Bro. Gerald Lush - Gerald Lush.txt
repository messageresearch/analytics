first a man by the grace of God in the name of our Lord in the name of our Savior Jesus Christ to God be the glory amen [Music] Oh [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] a man praise the Lord god bless you turn with me just the Book of Psalms chapter 95 Psalms chapter 95 a man beginning at verse 1 oh come let us sing unto the Lord a man let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation amen let us come before his presence with Thanksgiving a right attitude amen and make a joyful noise we're on to him with Psalms for the Lord is a great God and a great King above all gods amen praise the Lord in his and are the deep places of the earth the strength of ills of the hills is is also a man the sea is is and he made it and his hands from the dry land oh come let us worship and bow down let us kneel before the Lord our maker a man for he is our God and we are the people of his pasture amen and the Sheep of his hand today if he will hear his voice today if you will hear his voice today and we ministering on I have heard but now I see make sure we're hearing the voice of God not the voice of the devil but it says today if he will hear his voice if you will hear the word harden not your heart as in the provocation and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness but they wouldn't listen to God they would listen to man but not in the Lord they wouldn't listen to God through Moses they wouldn't listen to God through Joshua and Caleb but then it's knew God through the false prophets a man God had mercy that we're going to listen to God through his word and it says when your father's tempted me they tempted God with their unbelief brother we attempt God the same way as with her unbelief or with our doubt and it says they proved me and saw my work but still they refused to take him at his word and it's a generation that's refusing even the day to take God at His Word in spite of what God has done in the light of all that God has said in the light of all that God has revealed they're going to do what's right in their own eyes now I'm walking in the spirit not led by the spirit but they're walking by a holy spirit the fall spirit a man walking by the leadership of the devil not the leadership of God grace to us 40 years long was I agree with this generation and said it is a people that do err in their heart we're going to make our calling election sure by going down into the heart amen because they're calling an election is in the heart are calling an election is in our souls it's the confirmation it is the vindication that is God calling me it's God calling you it is God ministering to you it is God ministering to me it is not it is not justifiable ministry it is it is God in the fight for ministry it is God through the faithful ministry he's not there to entertain us a man not not by any means he's there to purchase he's there to teach us he's there to encourage us a man well his word he's there to increase our faith because there's any that we need is Inc more faith a man by the grace of Almighty why because it is faith that pleases God we want the faith that pleases God it is not just to say I believe this I believe that yeah but in your head but you got to believe it in your heart God is looking for in your heart a man and the Lord has been bringing me back to this message here again on I have heard but now I see and it's been a burden on my heart he said go back and I want you to go back over these things again because they need it a man so I'm just following the leadership of what I feel is the Lord and the anointing of the Holy Ghost to go back over the things I've already preached and over the things I've already quoted a man in the message concerning I have heard but now I see in 19 and 65 I believe one of the significant message and one of the important messages for the bride just before God took the profit off the seen a man so God ever the ablest I have a and the heir of the soul and have the eye of the soul to hear what God is saying to see what God is saying here what God has done and to see what he has done Amen so I pray the grace of God you bear with me as we go through these things again and the Lord want me to highlight this and I like that before I get maybe two or three or four or five times but I said okay Lord I'll do it I didn't personally in myself I didn't want to do it I want to move on to this and move on to that but the Lord said no I want you to go back to this and I want you to write I want you to repeat this a man so the grace of God to us as we get into that word again as we get into that message again by the grace of God that we're going to hear it well your what God wants us to hear and we're going to see when God wants us to see a man it is just not a revelation but it's got to be the revelation it has got to be Christ reveal himself to you in your heart not your head not your feelings is in your soul a man and then brother we're night with absolutely the soul is not depending on your feelings your soul is not going by sight because old is absolutely faint a man it is God that worketh in you willing to do of his good pleasure by the grace of God so in prayer as we move from the scriptures eventually and get into the this message again and quotes that I've already quoted but they're sayings that the prophet and then the Lord rather would want me to highlight a man and only that it was it was just a few days ago that our brother Matthew had sent me a quote by one of our black for administering brethren I don't know where he is whether it's here in Africa what country is saying but when I when I looked at the quote it was it was from this message that I've that I've been ministering on I have heard but now I see Amen I should thank you Lord and I remember that I remember the quote I remember the paragraph then that the brother mentioned so brother were wherever he was God was dealing with him in that message God is dealing with us here in that message amen and we might be separated by miles and miles and miles countries amen so I pray the will of God be done please I pray grace that we're going to have the Holy Ghost in our soul a man to hear the word in our soul and not in our heads a man because there's too many with intellectual knowledge of this message they got an intellectual revelation of this message but it's not spiritual a man is not owned by the Holy Ghost and it's not God it's the devil a man for the grace of God the Bible says in verse ten forty years long was I agree with this generation a man that God dealt with in the wilderness after bringing them out of Egypt and again it's been many years that God has been dealing with a generation after brought us out of a denominational Egyptian bondage that's where the father God referred to we were brought out of denominational Egyptian bondage the same as Israel but a tavern a chiral edge Egypt were brought it out of their spiritual Egypt a man it was a spiritual Egypt a man and that we were slaves to a spiritual Egypt a man but God has brought us out a man by grace for deliverance to take us as he wanted to do there he wants to take us into the promised land a man not getting caught up with what's going on in this world but getting caught out what's going on in a turn by the grace of God so he said 40 years long was I agreed with this generation and said it is the people that do err in their heart a man if there's got to see anything is the error in our hearts he may it's error in our souls if God it is - one wants to do anything it is to purge and to cleanse us from the inside out a man from the soul and the spirit and the body amen but it's got to start in the soul and brothers no not not just to put on the the garment no no we got have we got to put it on in the soul got a white garment on the inside of the inside of the revealed word amen and God deals with us in our soul so his word by the Holy Ghost in our souls the word in our soul and then God a minister to us in our human spirits a man and then God through the spirit the human spirit you go forth the Holy Ghost to minister and control your body a man by grace God Elvis amen make sure yours not in your flesh is not in your mind is not just a human spirit but it's in your soul the pop of Gaza you can have God in your flesh twenty-four hours a day and go to hell and you could have great experience God in your spirit but still not be in your soul and still be lost amen you can be healed he said then go to hell a man but he why he said because we your motive wasn't right and your objector wasn't right a mate and he brings that out again in this message right here if you want God to do this you want God to do that he said why do you want God to do it he said it's for the glory of God is for your own benefit amen many want God to do this and do this do this for their own benefit but it's not for the glory of God amen brother we're not living for ourselves we're living for him let's give him the glory amen by the grace of Almighty God again I have urged mine now I see a trusting by grace we have heard it in our soul we have we see it in our soul a man and through the soul that is coming to your spirit and through the soul that is made flesh in you a man so but about too many are plenty of putting in the flesh but it's not getting to the soul amen brother he said God got to go down right down beyond your your thoughts beyond your spirit into your soul amen so that we're not governed by Irish bear burger your human spirit we're governed by the Holy Spirit anybody god give us the revelation that we need concerning our rather our late a relationship with him amen now relationship with brother Branham not relationship with one another not relationship with his Ministry of that ministry it's a relationship with Christ amen but again is the Bible Minister for the perfecting of the Saints and then bring us in more and more perfection in Christ amen by the grace of God and he said it is the people that do err in their heart amen and they have not known my ways amazing they have none after all that God did with them and for them in Egypt and in the in the wilderness ending coming out brother they did not know God amen and they did not know the ways of God surely after all we've seen after all we've heard that we know God we know the ways of God and we know why God is requiring of us where we know what God is looking for in you and in me amen brother I pray God that the word is accomplishing in you and maybe what God wants to accomplish there God that the word is bringing in you and me what God wants to see what pleases gone a man what is God looking for us concerning all that he is done considering all that God has done and all that God is doing what's gone through doing it for it's not just to get us out of the denomination and not just to get us into this revelation that revelation this doctrine that doctrine brothers enduring East case he's working on something a million and it's not just not just the ology amen he's working on eternity by the grace of God and to get us back to eternity amen he knows where we come from and he's trying to give us the revelation where we come from so we want to get back amen by the grace of Almighty God and it says they do err in their hearts I pray grace that you're not in error in your heart amen but many are there's a part of God so you can go in history so you can err shouldn't go to hell he says just a dead work you give baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and go to hell because there's just a dead work he said if it's not by faith out of your heart amen faith out of your soul looking for the resurrection in the rapture brother it won't be a reality to us on this a revelation coming out of the heart amen is a conviction in our hearts and in our souls concerning the resurrection anybody who that was convicted in justification others convicted in sanctification others and they give through the spirit and the bat and there was a conviction a man so the bride is convicted a man concerning what God wants to do he sends the word and by the Holy Ghost in that word he brings conviction in our hearts because he wants he wants us to to let him do what he wants to do in us and through us amen if not you oh you got it to decide one thing you decided to turn it over to God and you know they that lady and make the rest of the decisions anybody didn't you let God be the leader not you you're not gonna do what's right in your own eyes no no he said they do err in their heart and they have not known my ways the Bible said that they were doing what's right in their own eyes not going by the leadership of the Holy Ghost on to whom he said I swear in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest and brother they didn't enter into that rest in the promised land and there's many a believer today won't enter into God's rest in the Holy Ghost God's rest in the revelation of the resurrection and the rapture brother gives us peace god bless you may be seated and turn with me to 1st Thessalonians chapter 5 first Thessalonians chapter 5 so it's the Lord that has laid it on my heart to go back over some of these thoughts on hearing and seen a male and I personally feel that it's a revelation that the Lord wants us to confirm in our hearts a man God wants the confirmation of it in your soul a man not in your mind but in your soul so the grace of God to be in us and that we are experiencing God from the end side out a man and in verse chapter 5 and verse 1 but of the times and seasons brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape where by the grace of god were endeavoring by grace through faith to escape a man was coming the past in this world and what's going to happen on this earth that God had given us a promise that we're going to leave and go to be with him a man in the resurrection and in the rapture and it says be but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief a man that we're not walking in darkness we're walking in the light and I'm not in our bodies but in our souls brothers got to go bad beyond the flesh and again go beyond your human spirit it's got to go into your soul some other than what the life that you're living is the life of Christ coming from the inside out and the power of God as I lighted it there are those who are putting the emphasis on the outside putting the emphasis on the flash putting the emphasis on the under you in spirit but not on the in their souls a man this is this is where we got to make sure that we believe the message is on the inside of the inside this is where we got to make sure that we are serving God is from the inside the insight a man not just the insight but the insight of the insight a man praise the name of what's inside it's the human spirit so you go beyond the human spirit inside that and this is where God is going to be working on your life God's going to work on my life where God is working in his in his children a man is where God is working in his sons and daughters and we think because they look like believers they're believers know God God not looking at the flesh oh yeah they they they learned their modestly dressed and and the brothers got the haircut and then the sisters got their long hair and they got dresses and so on knowing God looking at the heart a man whether it was causing him to leave lived like this what it's causing to act like this is there something in their souls those are just intellectual knowledge in their in their heads brothers see God as God is absolutely a man wants to deal with us in our souls amen so there's no interferes with the flesh and the senses of your flesh and there's no interference with the senses of your human spirit amen that we are totally absolutely under the under the control of paint amen it is that it is it is the revelation of what God wants us to see what God wants us to hear what God wants us to do amen what God wants to do by the grace of God in this hour amen revelation what God wanted to do in Luther and Wesley the Pentecostals what about you and me amen and brother is called beyond just the sisters going to dress like a like old-fashioned sisters or to act like act like they weren't a brothers just do this and do this ain't man butter it's that but beyond that God wants to but wants to fulfill the promise of the Resurrection and the rapture amen but he's getting us ready for the resurrection and the rapture brother so I hate getting us ready so that God can do what he wants God is going to say when he wants gotta get his believe what he wants us to believe a man God's going to get us the gold where he wants us to go hey man oh my brother sister let's be on our guard amen and the scripture constantly is warning us to be on our guard a man anywhere it's the Old Testament whether it's the New Testament be on your guard this is what he said make your calling and election sure it's being on your guard a man because you don't want to be deceived and especially if there's ever an hour that we ought to be on our guard is this hour and is this age that we're living in because jesus warned us to be so deceiving it would to see the very elect if possible amen and if you see the very elect if possible the part of the guards that all mine he said just think and just consider it he said they're going to they're going to believe this we're going to believe this we're going to believe that now it's so close he said to what the bride is believing so close to what the true believers believing in their hearts and in their souls others are believed in and in their heads amen and then one is under the anointing of the devil the others under the anointing of God honey and only of our Lord Jesus Christ so he's warning and they might be in this message right here I have heard but now I see a man encouraging us to be on our guard encourage us to make our calling election sure making sure that we are under the right anointing any man neither the true anointing not the false anointing and again the old brothers sister go back read Malcolm at Matthew 24 and considered Lord I pray God Lord that I'm not going to be the seed Lord I'm not going to fall under the false spirit I'm going to be under the true and honey and the true spirit of the Holy Ghost but Lord you have warned us that it's going to be so close it would deceive the very elect impossible a man but the truth is it's going to be again it's going to be you know it so close to the real 99 that true is gonna be a hundred percent and the false is gonna be 99 percent or a hundred and one percent amen because the devil is going to maybe just take off the word and he always going to head on a few words amen you cannot head to it you can't take from it a man see there brother this is why that was the last exhortation that he gave in the scriptures he and the book of Revelation and it says if any man shall take away from the words of the of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life out of the holy city and from the things which are written therein and brother were also encouraged that we are not to head to it and we're not to think away from it amen but there are many that are the church to this present hour here in 2019 many a believer has headed to the message and they're continuing to add to the message and many a believer has taken away from the message a man they're taking away this for taking away their well weed I don't think God wants us to do this or God don't want us to do that come on brother I tell you God wants us to believe God wants to believe in our hearts where God God wants to give out and wants us to give him control of our lives amen so again and let me repeat it again it's not me the lives it's Christ I live within me and now you the lives this Christ living in you ain't a whether it withers not just in this church whether it's in your job whether it's in school no matter whether there's a fellowship with us visit us render that friend or relatives hey man it's Christ living in you a man just to save it with when Jesus was through a stroke preaching and they came in sat all excuse me your your your your mother and your brothers want to see you all mother and brothers he said who is my mother and who is my brother brethren amen well they would they would maybe it'd be considered to be an insult but Jesus turned and said these he said these that hear the word and do the word these are that are that are receiving the word amen he said this is my mother and this is my brethren so I trust by the grace of God we are his mother and his retirin a man that Christ is born in you amen praise the name of the Lord and brother we're going to let him raise us not us raise him hey man way that he's going to encourage us amen we encourage him but surrendering and let him have control hey man that has he lay down his life we lay down our lives amen all brother I trust by the grace of God it is that is Christ that's living in those fleshly bodies that I'm looking at ain't that a did you always not the old nature that you were born with living in Amen it's not the old nation of Barbara that controls you it's the Holy Ghost controls you a man I have heard but now I see I have heard with my soul now I see it in my soul hey man and it's not me it's Christ in me hey man what I believe is not me it's Christ in me he is revealing he's revision I believe what he has said I believe what he's doing Amen I'm gonna let him do everything I let him make the decisions not me amen no matter what you get no matter what the choice is no matter what the decision is it's not your choice it's not your decision is Jesus Amen brother that is absolutely dead to yourself and alive to him amen that means he is that is an absolute control of your life amen he's making the decisions oh brother I don't care what the decision is amen I don't care what the what what what God wants you to decide what God wants you to do it's not your choice you're leaving with Jesus amen sons and daughters of God led by the Spirit of God amen and it is the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father father father father amen by the grace of God so I trust whether when it comes to no matter it's your education it is your job it is your it is your made it is your family your friends hey man well I didn't choose this God chosen I didn't go this way God led me this way amen praise the name of the Lord again that's where I believe that their brother Troy went from the one job to this job to the head job and so on and at all and and the blessing of God was there and brother than it wasn't me it was Christ in me when they when they would all they would come and they would they would look for attention in me look for counseling advice in me I said Lord I said I don't have much wisdom but you do Amen it's not me it's grace amen and that's why all day they were coming in and and what want to know what I thought want to know what I was really want to know what I was doing amen no and not all together recognizing God and so on but I got like I said you know and when they said one time they were looking for something where I was working and they could come to me and they said Jarrell why are you looking for what we're looking for and they were going everywhere lookey were they looking for they're looking for looking for I said well I said look and ice according to the will of God I said we're gonna find it before the store opens and we did amen so brother they knew that I had a I had a faith they knew that I was trusting the Lord they knew that I I was Christian by the grace of God and then I wasn't at one point I was standing there and I was doing something and something that somebody can i excuse me I got a question I hear that you preach and then they said to you've reached I said oh yes and we have Kaddish means and I said I preached I said by yes for the glory of God I said as God leads us any man and I said been doing that for quite a while I've been working when I wasn't preaching to a million so the work wasn't gonna stop me from preaching a man because I own you because I would allow this like this I'll or whatever you want me to do I'm gonna do Amen praise the name of the Lord and hey you want to be a minister there ministry here I said I'm gonna do it ain't a and not only that I would minister what he wanted me to minister hey man brother I'm not here to entertain you not by any means no no no there's many a minister that people want all we want this ministry they want this Minister you know why because it's entertaining amen but what about what about getting this Minister that Minister that's going to lay in the word straighten things out a man get you on your toes a man to get you're down to a giddy that bring you down to a place of repentance and Oh God forgive me he may help me Lord straighten us out - huh by the grace of God and it was anything that God wants to ministry to do right now brother's not entertaining us not going to make us feel good oh ya know sometimes you're gonna cry a man sometimes you'll get you'll get that on your knees sometimes you're gonna be disappointed amen but it's God working on you it's God by the grace of God a man it's brother it's right there in the end the Word of God amen concerning what God has done and what God is doing for the ministry God has set in the church for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ man sir are we being edified by the grace of God oh my where was that Amen you know the scripture I'm referring to that God has set in the church God has said this in the church God has set that in the church and it's where our benefit a man for the work of yo no that's another scripture thank you brother amen and he said is for the perfecting of the saints so as the ministry perfecting you amen brother this is what God is this is how God is going to judge us and this is what God is going to judge this body if this scripture right here so make it our calling an election sure let's line up with a word right here a man so is the ministry perfecting us a man and are you reflecting that perfection not another thing what you can say but the life you can live any man and it is for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ it is to edify the body and to encourage the body with the revelation that they need Amen as a revelation you want it's a revelation you need a man so God is going to give us what we need and go and do what he wants us to do not what we want to do a man sir brother sister it is the edifying of the body of Christ to give us the faith we need and the understanding we need by the grace of God there's not just so I'm going to learn this and I'm going to learn that but is it is it producing in us what God wants it to produce and it is the greater and greater resurrection and rapturing faith amen God is going to put the evidence on what he wants to do hey man because that's what Luther's message was all around justification justification Wesley's managers all around st. avocation sanctification oh my brother Wesley can't you preach something else no this is what God wants us to preach more noon and night five days over five times a day that he Whitney preached on John sanctification amen by the grace of God and her justification sanctification and the Pentecost was the baptism of the Holy Ghost morning noon and night Amen brother sister it is for the perfecting of the saints and then they'll we're moving on further does not stop with Pentecost amen the song goes Goods go on to the perfection that God is working on in his bride amen the perfection that God is working on in your life and he might only play the grace of God amen and brother the more we get into it the more humble you become the more sincere you become a man and the more and more you're hungry or thirsty for the revelation that God's got in you any man but anything as I said we ought to hunger and thirst for this generation the previous generation as I said before no they didn't see what they didn't see in the messy what you and I are seeing all they saw was the profit all they saw was God sent a prophet a man know he do this but now you and I are seeing what he has done and why he has done it and God is working out in you and me why he's done it a man because God did that for this reason God did that for this purpose and what God did what he did in this this age is the accomplishing it in you and me now brother's been 50 over 50 years brother surely after 50 years there surely God is bringing us more and more closer to the resurrection the rapture reality a night the Bible says he dealt way he dealt with the with the Israelites there and those Jews he dealt with in 40 years in the wilderness a man and brother we have been we've been in this wilderness role over many many years I don't know whether it's going to be 50 years 60 years 70 years amen but God God has got a purpose in it somewhere that we are still here and like I said I have seen some nights and I hear so much oh my apprai and I talked to the Lord when I'm walking when I'm driving sometimes the Lord have we missed it and we missed it Lord I trust we haven't missed the rapture Amen that's been my prayer that's been my crying calling on the Lord lord I trust we haven't missed it I pray God you're not going to mr. rapture and the only way we're not going to miss the rapture is to focus on the revelation the way that God wants us to focus on it that we got to hear it the way God wants us to hear and we'll see it the way God wants us to see it amen and I just focusing on the doctrine of the Godhead the god of water baptism or this doctrine or that after no our servants ain't no it's the doctrine now of the trick of the revelation of the Resurrection and the rapture anything God wants you to focus on that's what he wants you to focus on anything you want a hunger and thirst for that's it a man does not I want this and I want that no no no there's people that want God to do this why God to do that brother Issa what's your more than objective and again this is something I never never brought up but it's here in this message and he highlights and what is your motive and objective he said I I doesn't make a difference eaten if you're looking for healing he said why do you want to be healed hey Marion he said there are those that way you know they come to his ministry and all they wanted we little Brandon was his signs in his aim that end the determine that all they wanted was Healy he's a why do you want to be healed he said as of the will of God for you to be healed and he said he said or he said does God have another purpose so he said you got to want God's will hey you got to want to do God's purpose amen but no no we want God today so we want God to do this what I got to do that make everything good for us and always could be wonderful he said but he said is God you wouldn't go if I got in it or just get the glory unto yourself a man brother he's bringing it out I have heard but now I see have we heard by the way that we should have had ever heard it a man they didn't hear about healing the way they should have heard it they didn't hear about this and that I bet the way they should have heard it because they want it for their own benefit but not for the glory of God a man it's for the glory of God that we want healing is for the glory of God we want salvation we want to go we want God to glorify himself in you and in me by what he's going to do in you and in me a man not oh I'm a Christian so I don't have to work don't have to worry you better read the Bible a man the Bible tells us that we go we got to take these things and consider these things and be serious about these Saints amen by the grace of Almighty God but again there's so many ministries that lead the wrong impression with people today that you're all you got to do is this not you got to do it and God is gonna do all the rest no he's gonna you're gonna do it that's why the father God said God is waiting on you amen and the dating just straight brother sister what a responsibility that God's through the revelation of the word of this age has put on ours our hearts that God has put on our shoulders amen that the Danny Crace are waiting on me what are you waiting for the waiting with a resurrection and the risen and as Jesus said I am the resurrection rapture you are the resurrection rapture amen Crais make flesh in the brain no the noting though that any Christ are waiting on the brain because they're the ones that are going to bring them to resurrection into manifestation amen and the rapture to get cut off amen God is waiting on us but there's too many pretty early believers today just waiting on God God do this God do that God do something else brother sister what are you gonna do God gives us the revelation God gives us the alrighty guy gives up the power God gives us the strength amen to do what he wants us to do amen God will look at what God did when he said I've heard the cries of my people and I have come down to deliver them a man he did it he did did he deliver them or Moses did he deliver they were or Joshua and Caleb did he take him into the Promised Land or did Josh Michaela see right here God has set in the church for the perfecting of the Saints God has set among Israel for the perfecting of Israel ain't no the ministry that they are the recognized guardian Moses called in Joshua God in Cana and God in other said that we're willing to go into the Promised Land amen it's the same thing in this day of this hour is recognizing God in the ministry ministry to you and as laying God is raiding the responsibilities of the word in your lap anything that's why again the part of God day he felt so bad and of this and so bad he administered the administrative minister but he wasn't seeing much results from him the people weren't responding the way that the way that God should felt they should respond and he went to the Lord about it you know Lord all my lord is to me and maybe I haven't done it right maybe I haven't preached it enough and so on underfunding went out into the wilderness and I think it was the wind that blew he opened his Bible and the wind came and blew the leaves and it went right right right it right through that scripture and then it says just committed a little make your calling lecture abundantly leave it with the Lord amen and Joshua did it amen but you gotta leave it with God he said he said leave it in their lap a man and God confirmed it when he opened the Bible to that verse that right there that he wanted to come he said both now brother Brown that's what you got to do you got to leave it in their lap he said God left it in there Israel's lap now he said he said we're leaving it in the people's left the resurrection the rapture amen brother God gave the word God gave the revelation that would give us the faith so we're with that excuse amen so the private of God cannot be judged because all hi I didn't I didn't do this I didn't do that too old to help the people to come to resurrection wrap through faith he did all that what God want them to do he did everything that he had to do in this hour to give it to give us resurrection right through faith we are without excuse old brother sister don't blame God don't blame women Bram you can't blame the ministry 50 years ago or 40 years ago no because God has through the ministry been giving us more and more revelation amen to give us the greater and greater faith brother/sister the yeah the faith for justification he did it was faith God didn't just bring it bringing the revelation of the letter to to the to - to this to his servant brother sister that the messenger Martin or no a man Luther Wesley the Pentecostals he just to give them intellectual revelation of the word he gave them an experience any merit and lo thoroughly what he do you experience justification hey man it was an experience in in soul and it changed Luther's heart and soul and spirit and motives and objectives hey man and he went from looking down to looking up hey man that's right and Joshua linfer an eye drops well but Wesley he went from looking down looking on by the grace of Almighty God amen and you talk about Pentecostals anyone looking up they were looking up hey and they were praising God and worshiping God with the gifts of the Spirit and so on hey man and now the brightest anybody looking up it's the bright a million because we come to that place where Jesus said when you see this see this see this look up how many are looking up just most still looking oh yeah look at her word and waiting on the rapture no no God does give you the word he make you the word made the word flesh turn you now God's waiting on the rapture why yeah God's waiting under after what we in the rapture yeah and and all those that are gone onto waiting on the resurrection oh wait but they're dead in Christ they died in Christ and they're he's the resurrection you know but crisis in the right now amen now she's the resurrection rapture brothers tremendous responsibility don't don't shake it away from you because you do you shake what you shake the Lord away from you hey man if you do you're not gonna be in the resurrection not gonna be the rapture if you're not hungry for it and you're not thirsting for it you're not gonna be a part of it amen as again I said I walk walk through the floor of the condo and I look at the window and look of an old Lord I said Lord I said the resurrection the Lord there I'm sure I said we need it now get us our Lord or there be no flesh ain't a man so you're recognizing the hour you're living in you recognize the seriousness of it anybody and you're recognizing what we need amen anything we need I don't need no Lord do this do this this lord help us to get more and more into the resurrection rupturing pain to get out of here and lord turtle we're going with the saints that are gone on and we're all gonna get in glorified bodies we with you and sit with you in your throne rather now sitting on this wrong prophecy is sitting in this room of the revealed word and and the word is a judgment seat amen yeah probably got certain words going over the pulpit is judging the people a man and the word going and going over to pull with today is judging you oh yes most definitely it's judging have you heard do you see a man it's not it's not all God's waiting for me to receive this receive that well he's waiting for you to acknowledge it the truth and to see what God wants you to see and if any and and God is going to see what it's going to produce a certain action in you a certain added to a certain spirit and he's going to Humble you brother you're a man Oh amen amen so be it that's the truth Lord amen but does it mean that you believe the word or does it mean that you are guilty or innocent there's some that yeah what is your lust there are some of this is a main dark knowledge into God I'm guilty Laurie amen that's the truth Lord yeah or other technology Oh amen praise the Lord that's true yeah thank you Jesus and he's innocent so to reprove the preaching of the word is God revealing your guilt you're guilty at your spirit or your your innocence your guilt or your innocence amen if God is revealing guilt in you and he's condemning this and we're trying to bring you to repentance amen oh yeah if your son of God you'll preach the word and it'll produce repentance and your homies are forgive me Lord amen and you move on we go hallelujah again if you're innocent praise the Lord hallelujah you're getting closer to him amen see if you're guilty you repent if you're innocent you praise the Lord for His grace most definitely in the going forth of the word brother it's not just hearing it up here and making their flesh feel good no no it's hearing it in your soul hey man and it's judging your relationship with God amen whether God is encouraging you or really God is causing you to repent convicting you oh yeah the preacher of the word is convicting some it's encouraging and lifting others huh hey man because for the door ones is convicting they got to come down to get off yeah you got to get down to get up humble yourself by the grace of Almighty God all brothers sister this is tremendous the purpose of the word the Ministry of the word God has said in Israel the ministry God has said in the Church of Pikeville ministry and there's many today don't believe in the ministry this is amazing we're gonna need it right on through the probably God said he said you know me that he said even the ministry here it's gonna be leaders there I said you think you're gonna get away from me here no no no definitely not you know I trust by the grace of God you get there and see me you want to own all after all those years amen oh there's there's many that would hope maybe I don't make it but I'll tell you this when we get there brother I tell you we're not gonna be conscious of time no way and no matter how hard that Minister was preaching to you you won't even know it amen you won't be conscious of it you didn't wanna think about it by the grace of God amen that's why again I'm a trying day I was a ranger certain ones concerning you over the dead and where they're going and they use that scripture out of context that dead know not anything amen it sits right there in the Old Testament and they use that and say all so and they teach it as a doctrine they dead don't know anything but I said go and put it back in its context and read it all I said they don't know anything other days like I said but they're very conscious of the of where they're gone amen because the rich man lifted up his eyes and helped being in torment and the only that he was seeing her CDs hello cold warning my brother's cool warned this one he said no they already had the word amen well but Lazarus lifted up his ice in the bosom of Abraham peace rest amen so brother sister the prophet of God did remind us that he's heard the ministry here is gonna be ministry there oh yeah because again there's just going to be those that there were those that walked up and down in the coals of fire even Satan in his Minister here he had a ministry there are you in heaven terney yeah and he got lifted up with pride oh yeah and he brought and it this is what this is what brought world in this condition right now God permitted it to reveal this and express his love and now a that to get love from you hey God once now not love you love him because you got to know love it because you want to any man when you consider the revelation of God you consider the nature of God you consider what God permitted and what God did and what God is doing and consider what where we were born thank you Jesus I don't deserve this I was born in sin shape that iniquity come to the world speaking lies Lord but look what you did look what you did to Adam and me look what you did to Abel look what you did even love brother God said to Cain if thou doest well want them also be accepted that was divine law hey man brother what would we do Oh King he murdered his brother get out of here yeah back to him get out of here oh yeah that's why that many would believe did it do the day because they believe is problem somebody kills somebody you can't you could take them and in a court and sentence them to death no you can't no no that's contrary to the word but there's many that would do that back there cuz they would have Cain's spirit they want to kill Cain yeah because he killed Abel brother God says came if you do well won't you also be accepted Amen brothers sister let let God deal with you in your heart and in your soul there's too many believers brother they're taking the word but they're not letting God deal with them through the word God got to deal with you brother to bring you to that place that did you please God and you love God God's gonna deal with you and the problem of God in this message right here on I have heard but now I see probably God brings it out God dealing with us reason a man and he on it--so again joke God dealt with Joel for a reason he wasn't punishing job he was purging job a man and brother is not God punishing yellow party she may is God purging you oh no no no Jesus perched me he's dead did it all oh no just a certain things that Jesus comes back in in your place to do amen he's there to do this he's there to do that amen brother listen that's why Paul warned us he said you could have this and have this and have that baby don't have divine law it's all in vain hey man just love him with the love wherewith he loved us the show that low lets manifest that love reveal that law brother sister no matter what the situation circumstances you're controlled by divine love amen no wonder the Father God or the Lord rather the Lord Jesus want me to come back to this message again he's your brother son he should go back yes I want you to I like this I like this he's I want to point out there's plenty of that they cussed her some things that I skipped even I was giving you the quotes again it's like I said brother it's like I said when when I said certain ones I said reading that reading the message is same thing and reading the Bible or they read it and I'll just skip that page oh not as should man no no I think I've said it I said Lord why you got so much in your Bible I said short of the world is without read it without excuse I said this is there to say Lord if they read your Bible I sook what do they think when they read that what do you think when they read this I said the Bible says you know that that the word is forever settled in heaven you have an earth shall pass away but the word will never pass away so I said I'd understand you and his Christians out there I don't care do many things we did watch history and you know they read their Bible and it's like that all due respect to that Catholic and I pray if she's gone on that God would rest her soul but she said pastor she said you know she said she said we don't believe all that the priest says now she says you know why and I said why she's a weaken now she said we can take our Bible and read it ourselves she says really there with you back then she said we didn't read a Bible and didn't have a Bible to read but now she said we got a Bible so you can read it ourselves so she's we believe what God says I said God bless you amen old brothers spirit brother she was getting away from the cast experience oh yeah I think the public God said you I trust a lot but I came out of I don't have the spirit of that denomination you know but I got the Holy Spirit the same with you folks here are some of you that came out of the Catholic Church pray God grace that you don't have the spirit of the Catholic Church amen so you think like them act like him you know that's all no that's gone purge when the Holy Ghost come he burned it out amen when the Holy Ghost came in me he burned out the spirits of those organizations by the grace of God but but there's still a lot of believers got those spirits power God says you can be you can come out of it be a part of it because you can still got the spirit of it oh yes but he said that's why I've dealt with people who even message believers they still got the Pentecostal spirit you still got a Salvation Army spirit you still got a name of your spirit you still got a Catholic spirit oh yeah make sure you got the Holy Spirit in your soul you've been purged and God is purging us more amen by the grace of God come on let God have his way so he can purge all that out so what so you're gonna think the thoughts of God amen praise the name I'm not gonna think brothers all due respect to them back there but I can't think like Luther talk now I gotta think I gotta think a lot better a lot more oh yes a lot more the same way that way Wesley the same with the aliens same with the Salvation Army in the Pentecostals any man God has revealed more now now our thoughts are based on further revelation our lives are based on the greater revelation all due respect to the others yes but let's make sure that God is seeing what he wants to see in you amen that God is gonna recognize in yo your spirit your attitude your motives your objectives hey man amen the results of God purging you that he's purged out everything that's Antichrist oh I'm not out of Christ at all you can do is change one word and your Antichrist oh that was saying didn't come to the Bible you know and they read and to skip this skip this skip this and now I said it's getting same thing around the man I should you'll read that you'll skip that skip that oh yeah that's nice there skip that oh yeah believers doing that believers are doing that man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God and brother Brown said he said this is not me please understand it he said he said I can't do this and he said I can't reveal this he said this is Jesus he said I got to get out of the way so he can do it hey man we around and preach this and this that was Christ in the Prophet a man brother Branham had never had to protonating anja of a preacher he had the anointing of a prophet amen and he went and manifested the the office of a prophet he died to himself and he let God have control of that prophetic ministry brothers sister gracious yes with sessile onehans 5 yes sorry mine but the times are seasons weather you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night but the brightest could not going to miss it why because she's not a child of light of darkness she's a child of the of the day she's walking in light amen that's why she's gonna recognize the coming but the world in general want he meant for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety well what's the thief gonna do is he gonna steal something as the thief or as the thief not that he is he's come to take the bride he's coming to take the away amen I trust it's you and me we're part of it as a thief Oh could the world's gonna miss us and wonder where we went oh he took us he took you yeah in the rapture you missed it I pray grace again we don't miss it for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape brother as I said we witnessed now the world has changed it's not the world we lived in a few years ago no no no because they you could hear anything happening now every day and it's not not way over there and waste somewhere else somewhere else it could be right next door now the world is insane it is insane I know it's insane yeah and it's gonna sudden destruction it doesn't surprise me not by any means and even there's warnings as concerning what's going on in in the Middle East yeah grace of God brother we know that all the nations are getting together going to get together one day against Israel they'll take their stand for Israel didn't they'll all turn against Israel or don't think oh they're taking a stand they're gonna move during quarters to Jerusalem who'd do this do this do this yeah don't worry about that that's just a deception for the world because the day is coming the hour is coming when they say this today and they'll turn it around tomorrow they'll be against Israel tomorrow god help us look up because the bride goes and then God goes back to the Jews grace but ye brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief that's here the way God wants us to hear it see what God wants us to see the deception of the age were living in that we not be deceived and so that they overtake you as a thief here all the children of light and the children of the day we are not of the night nor of the darkness by the grace of God therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober but there's too many that are drunk with the forces of this world they are there absolutely drunk with their own nature their drugged with with what the world is doing what's going on in the world - they're drunk well you got to maintain the sanity of the holy ghost you know what you do and how you do it amen therefore he said let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober don't get drunk on the foolishness of this world for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunken are drunken in the night but let us who are of the day be sober brother your soberness will bear witness that you're a child of the day amen your soberness will bear witness that you're a child of light not of darkness for they that sleep sleep in the night they that be drunken are drunken in the night but let us are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love amen the breastplate of faith and love for an element the hope of salvation brother faith love and hope salvation for us is the resurrection and the rapture we've been saved in our souls now God saving us in our bodies glorified bodies amen so brothers hear what God is saying and you really seriously consider it and say well no Lord I'm not drunk

Lord don't let me get drunk on this drunk on that so I gonna do what's right in my own eyes I'm gonna follow your leadership so you you're going further the word it's you guys got to respond to God and God sees your heart whether or not you're sober or what you're acknowledging or whether you're drunk God knows cuz you get drunk with the forces of this world oh yeah because the world is insane everywhere you go you see that insanity I don't know about evening even in jobs that you do in education and then not just university you know could be everyday schools and all that it's insane nothing is normal anymore only the bright gates to us so he let us who are of the day be sober and to show your soberness by putting on the breastplate of faith they might if you're sober you're gonna have the breastplate of faith the revelation of the will of God amen and love the breastplate of faith and love hallelujah divine love and for an element the hope of salvation praise the Lord I'm crown with the hope of salvation by the grace of God God confirming watching our souls for God hath have not appointed us under wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ amen so are we obtaining what he has appointed us for salvation not just say the message no salvation are we getting what God is revealing the message are we getting what God is teaching in the message are we saying manifested in us what God is doing in the message not many do grace to us brother he has not appointed us to wrath get upset with this and that something else this is not working that does not work another and I wish I had this always read that no forget that as long as you got Jesus amen because what God wants us to focus on is salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ that's what we're living for a man and you will die for it don't get caught up with the foolishness of this world the devil make you believe you oh this is good this is good this is good oh that won't hurt you that one are just good you need this you need this no we need Jesus let him decide what else we need yeah let him decide where we get it how we get it when we get it so on again sons and daughters are led by the Spirit of God are you live but were you led by the Spirit today will you be led by the Spirit this afternoon will you be led by the Spirit tonight or tomorrow even this going to work too often but even believers they they they're they're trying to just be spiritual but when I go to church or when I do this when I do that devotion or whatever no you have gonna be spiritual constantly twenty-four twenty-four seven your spiritual because the last one you say goodnight to is the Lord you know don't forget him you can't if you're a Christian you won't forget him have you been born again you won't forget no no no you love the Lord if you love him oh you can't forget if you love him you want to talk to if you want to love if you're loving Lord be with us tonight Lord we've put ourself in your care so Lord you you'll be glorified amen see you give the preeminence to him not to yourself and there's a lot of believers I know I know what doing how they do it to give them preeminence to themselves yeah God do this God do this good god you do this you do this you do that for God for the glory of God amen wonderful so brother he's appointed us to obtain salvation amen by our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us that whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him share his life that's what it means share is life just think Jesus not dead he's here oh oh he came from India he came from the Congo yeah oh he came from the States yeah so he could fellowship with his brothers and sisters praise the name of the Lord Alleluia praise the name of the Lord see we share his life we're sharing the life of Jesus here we're sharing the life of Jesus in Africa in India in the United States and all over the world by the grace of Almighty God so he said whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him share his life whether we're for comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as also ye do amen brother that do bring it to a conclusion right I thought I would just read scripture and go right on into the message but I've been in the message oh yeah quoting the message highlighting this not only that I lollie I like more as we go along because it's amazing what he's bringing out but it's a reason because he knew he was going because when he reached fifty-six years always today I see my incoming at 56 years old and this message that he preached on I have heard but now I see he preached that in Shreveport by the Jack Morris Church and in one of our books up there is a gene more by the Jack Moore's daughter her testimony is there and what she's experienced with the Prophet and God had ordained brother Jack more and it's a 70 to be there in Shreveport Louisiana what for for the Ministry of the word because he respected brother Branham and he honored brother Branham and brother Brown was free to preach what he wanted in brother Jack Morris Church oh yes and this is in 1965 and brother Branham went from Tucson to Shreveport Louisiana and he preached in Tucson he preached what else would you build me and then he went to Shreveport and he preached the invisible union of the Bride of Christ yeah revelations that we needed before he left he preached one message one time and maybe others and he said he said this is another revelation of the seven seals I believe that some of these messages are the results of the opening of the seven seals its mysteries that God wanted us to see a man his mysteries that God wanted us to hear a man to give us the faith that pleases they pleased him do you have the faith that pleases God today amen I told you your faith won't be selfish no no you it's not Lord do this for me for me no Lord not my will don't be done that's the faith that pleases God amen it's easily its leadership not your leadership and he preached invisible union of the bride he preached works is faith expressed he preached trying to do God a service without it being God's will and many tried to do that today gotta be the will of God he preached this message here I have heard but now I see amen and he continued on in shreveport and he preached God's only provided place of worship in Christ in the revealed Word and then he preached and concluded his report series on the wings of us no wait though Amen I believe this was the leadership of the Holy Ghost ministering to the bride before taking the profit off the scene a man and then he went on to other places in California but in Tucson yes and the last message he preached in California was leadership and the last message he preached before God took him home was communion a man why because all that God did all that God was doing and all that God is doing is to bring us more and more into communion with him hallelujah praise the name of the Lord oh he was highlighting natural communion but yes spiritual as well that we is in vain to take that if we don't have a communion with him it's all in vain in vain do you worship Me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men and so on so brother he preached communion he highlighted communion the significance of communion when he was in Tucson he wasn't pretty preaching Diaz asked him to get up and speak they exhort the people before they went into communion and this is what he did in the communion and at that same service he a man he prayed for brother green laid hands on him I pray God bless his ministry and so on but brother sister let's consider in our souls whether or not God has brought us into communion with him amen not just bread and wine but the reveal word by the grace of God amen so god help us brother that we're gonna recognize the significance of what God has done and what God is doing and let's consider Grady's after the questions do we have this revelation in our hearts of what God has done and what God is doing do we truly hear and see the Word of God the way that God wants us to hear it anyway the way God wants us to see it not in your head but in your soul a man he said just watch this was 1965 in August he said watch stay close to Christ he said let me warn you now as a minister of the gospel of this don't take any foolishness don't imagine anything stay right there until this inside of the inside is anchored to the word Amen that your soul is anchored to the word eat so that you are right in Christ because that's the the only thing that's going because we are in the most deceiving age that we ever did maybe that's why the Lord want me to come back and go through this these things there again in that message I have heard but now I see he said clean up your lives pay your debts Jesus said oh no man now he said he didn't mean like your rent I was renting and stuff like that he's you got to do it but he said get all your things off your hands and get everything right make ready get ready remember in the name of the Lord something is fixing to happen he was going but there was going to be a challenge to the bride and it's been a tremendous challenge since they're going to the Prophet amen he said that a little inside of the inside he said that's where you start he said which is your soul you don't start in your head start in your soul he's our the inside of the inside the control tower and he said it's either controlled by God or Satan so make sure your control tower today it's controlled by God a man he said when it's directed from the inside it throws all the rest of it together he said that's the guidepost that's the control tower the inside of the inside and he said the soul controls the spirit and the spirit controls the body amen so God through the baptism of the Holy Ghost through the rebirth in your soul controls your human spirit and the human spirit under the God's control controls the body make sure that he's in control of your soul amen make sure that he's absolute control of your soul so that he's controlling your human spirit and controlling your body god help us Aaron is one thing seen is another especially in the age wherein the false anointing is so close to the true anointing that it would deceive the very elect if possible just think of that that's the challenge you top it keep your eye on your garden on your toes that that prophecy ought to do that the false anointing is so close to the true anointing that it would deceive the very elect if possible dad oh brother you better make sure it's god that's think there's role of your life yeah it is absolutely necessary to make your calling an election sure make sure you're under the true anointing and not the false on ID are you hearing and seeing the message the way that God wants you to hear it the way that God wants you to see it brothers sister is it controlling your life the way God wants it to control and govern you and there's a lot of believers that the word and the message really the Holy Spirit is not controlling them no oh they say I believe this I believe this I believe that but brother is God in control because the devil also believes it amen are we governed by the Holy Ghost motives and objectives seeking the will and the leadership of God in everyday living or do you make choices do you make decisions no if you're born again its Christ in you that makes the decision and it's not your will it's his will that you're living out in everyday living these things are not to be taken lightly a man solely by the grace of God let's make it sure that Rhonda Reese can a man don't render evil for evil unto any man I don't care who it is keep your attitude right kid there goes you but for the grace of God oh yeah ever follow that which is good both among yourselves follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men keep your attitude great humble sincere rejoice evermore god help us pray without ceasing morning noon and night in everything give thanks yeah thank the Lord for His blessings for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you quench not the spirit no the Holy Ghost Compton reveals this to you want you to do this want you to think this don't quench the spirit that the Holy Ghost be in control God's not interested in you your knowledge you you think you're smart no if you think you're smart God knows you're stupid oh yeah God God's not reaching out there for for smart people educated people intellectual people knowing God's reach no their person those that have simple Holy Ghost faith they just believes and just say what God tells them to say didn't you know what I think I know this I understand this no no it's God as I said about that scientists in you know brothers Church there in the states that after service he'll always go to the most uneducated person there and fellowship with and you wouldn't know the brother told me he said you wouldn't know brother Gerald he said that that man was a scientist you would not he said he's like I don't act like one he certainly don't talk like one now the Hmong believers know he humbles himself god bless you oh yeah so he secretes not in the spirit despise not prophesying prove all things oh fast to that which is good the reveal word abstain from all appearance of evil not evil but the appearance of evil yeah gotta judge some not because of what they did like I said because of what they didn't do and because they were caught up with the appearance of evil not necessarily evil just the appearance god help us who you could have the appearance of evil in a thought in a word and a deed in an attitude or action and reaction oh yeah god help us brother that'll be the Holy Ghost in control God in control so abstain from all appearance of evil and the very God of peace sanctify you wholly and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ faithful is he that called you who also will do it but you got to let him do it amen not my will father dying be done brother God had brought Luther to that place not my little Lord dying be done thank you Jesus Wesley the Pentecostals and all the old fashioned Christians back there not my will of thine be done they live for God amen sure now brother if they live for God and much more with a bright lip regard as the bridegroom so the bride we come to that place oh yeah you got to come to that place we will he came to a we come to it and God sends angels to into to encourage us to strengthen us oh yeah God sent His angels or the angels came to encourage a strengthen Jesus and he said not my will father dine be done the flesh turned everything over to the will of God he knew what it was he knew what was going to happen but long with longs of the will of God brother if it's something negative out there are we willing and it's God's will are we willing to accept it and say Lord seems like it's a bit negative to me but whatever your will is Oh Lord I would prefer this and prefer no but you are over your will is not my will father don't be done don't make the decision based on your feelings or your thoughts in your head they sound faith the will of God as I said concerning that brother in France when they were be hitting Christians it was during the Civil War in France a civil war and they were beating people and this brother one day walked by and he saw them getting a woman ready to be hit her and he said no don't do that he said let me take her place why what kind of faith did he have it's amazing what what would you do would you take this person's place even for even even though it's not be being beheaded maybe it might be some other problems some other needs or some of this some days would you take their place and that you would endure this for their sake you did or that for their sake he was willing to lay down his life for the sake of that woman and he did they let the woman go and they took him and beheaded him god help us lay down our lives for one another that proves it's not you lives is Christ living in you by the grace of God be with us Lord grace god bless you - Stan praise the Lord they're saying Asian thy glorious coming Lord Christ coming now is nearing blessed day of his appearing this thought my heart great joy of forts
