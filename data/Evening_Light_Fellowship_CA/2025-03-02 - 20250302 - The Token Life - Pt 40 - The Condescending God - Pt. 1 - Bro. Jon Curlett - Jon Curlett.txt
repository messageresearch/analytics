made me want to shout Just Want to Thank You Lord thank you Lord sing that again praise the Lord I just want to thank you just want to thank you for there when I was so down and out you came along and made me want to shout I Just Want to Thank You Lord thank you Lord amen you can have your seats this morning I'm going to ask brother Kingsley and sister Melody to come up they've got uh their young son here this morning and they want to have him dedicated to the Lord so we're just going to invite them to come up at this time maybe we can sing that song One More Time while we're waiting for them I just W to thank you Lord for every time you heard my prayer I just want to thank you for all be there when I was so down and out along and made me want to shout I Just Want to Thank You Lord thank you Lord come on all the way up here yeah last time I did it they said you need to bring them up on the platform so we can all see on the camera and these things so let's turn you around so that the cameras and the people online can see as well amen so we have little an Dei how do you say it Oni on Dei Michael Ugo this morning and they want him to be dedicated and his name they they've really doubled down on this so his his Nigerian name means who is like God and his middle name Michael means who is like God and then you go I don't know what it means I think it means king or something or Prince something Royal oh the eagle there you go so this is a very very spiritual young man that has a Heritage certainly in his name as you can see he's already sitting up looking around enjoying his time in the presence of the Lord but you know when when God first made us he made us in His image and as cute as little Kachi is he's not in His image yet amen but I believe you'll hear by the sermon we're going to preach this morning God is bringing us back to his image God has come down to bring us back into his image and in the Old Testament they used to bring them in on the 8th day and they come in and they'd circumcise them that circumcision was to put them under the Covenant it was to join them to the promises of God and so today we don't bring them in to circumcise them I'm certainly not qualified to do that this morning but what we do is we bring him in and we say Lord we want him under your Covenant we want him under the Grace Covenant and really what we're doing is parents as we're humbling ourselves we're saying I can't do it I can't do it on my own we can we can do our best to follow the principles of the word but what we seek is the Holy Spirit to lead us by his word to show us how to raise our sons and daughters in the fear and admonition of the Lord and so we want to dedicate little Kachi this morning to the Lord if I can take him from you hey buddy there we go there we go all right let's bow our heads Lord Jesus Lord you took special time lord to bless the little ones when the parents brought them to you to bless them and Lord we want to lift up little Kachi before you Lord not only him but brother Kingsley and sister Melody this morning Lord they've acknowledge that they need you you are the great Shepherd you are the wonderful father Lord you are the source and inspiration for this little boy and Lord we're taking him this morning and we're committing him back to you Lord we're asking your grace for brother Kingsley and sister Melody that you would Lord fill them with your spirit daily that you would help them to find your leadership and your will Lord that they would follow in it day by day Heavenly Father may you set a hedge of protection around him Lord may you guard and protect him all the days of his life Lord may you make him a faithful servant for your kingdom Lord God Lord bless them each one Lord as they've invited you into his life and into their own Lord we pray that you would honor their faith this morning Lord that you would just do a wonderful work in each one of their lives we pray Lord we thank you for we thank you for a healthy baby a healthy Mama Lord a loving father Lord we pray that you would just be the center of their home all the days of their lives we pray now in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen that wasn't so bad was it that wasn't so bad amen God bless you God bless you as well okay God bless you God bless you amen let's stand if we would together and we'll turn in the scriptures to Exodus chapter 3 AM man it's one of the favorite parts of being a pastor is baptisms and baby dedications usually marriages but not always amen God bless you that'll be it musicians thank you this morning Exodus chapter 3 and verse 7 Exodus 3 and verse 7 very familiar scripture this morning this is God speaking to Moses now out of the burning bush Exodus 3:7 says and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason of their task Masters for I know their sorrows and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey unto the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites the amorites the perizzites the hivites and the jebusites amen God bless you let's bow our heads each one Heavenly Father Lord may you just take your word and open it this morning Lord may it Quicken our hearts Our Lives Lord may it just go in and anchor deep Lord may it spark something this morning Lord that would just reveal more of you and us Lord that would change us a little more into that image this morning we pray Lord take this service this people this time that we've set aside Lord to hear your word Lord and may you make us fit for service Lord by what we hear this morning we pray in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen God bless you you can have your seats this morning I certainly enjoyed our service on Wednesday that brother Garfield preached and I want to just take him take where he stopped in in some ways and just continue that this morning and I want to take a title this morning will'll be on this a few Services by God's grace called the condescending God Amen the condescending God and and our series is focused on the holy spirit this this series on the token life the token of the Holy Spirit the requirement of God for this this age this is this is the whole uh effort that God is doing in this age is to bring us to the fullness of the Holy Ghost In Our Lives Amen to bring us back to the fullness of our Redemption and I think one of the things that keeps us realizing that full power that that recognition of what's going on within a born again child of God is that we look at the Holy Spirit as a thing instead of as a person now now that seems a bit odd but the thing is what do we say we say well what do you need to do to truly be saved you need to get the Holy Ghost we don't need we don't say you need to get Holy Ghost we say the Holy Ghost we we treat it like a thing rather than a person if I was to say to you this morning you know all you need is all the right vitamins in your body and you'll be healthy then what would we do all day we'd be taking all these vitamins but if we could have a dispenser built into us that gave us exactly what we needed that's what we'd be looking for is what can I have inside of me that'll give me everything I need and so often what we look at at the holy spirit is we look at it as a dispenser as opposed to a person and because it's a thing then there is not a personality attached to that that we have to subject ourselves to but if we can see it as the person of God inside of us the very life of Jesus Christ inside of us then it changes our perspective amen and so we have to see that the holy spirit is the literal life of Jesus Christ inside of us this morning it is the person of Jesus Christ it's the very nature it's the very attributes of God and yes you have a little bit and I have a little bit we don't have it all but what we have has every portion of him that there is to be it has every attribute it has every Power it has every blessing it has every portion of our inheritance in it we just don't have it all that was for Christ Alone the fullness of the godhead bodily so if God is love and he is then we have a portion of that love if God is peace then we have a portion of that peace if God is rest we have a portion of that rest if God is all of these things then we have a portion of it and I'm not trying to diminish what you have this morning I'm trying to elevate your understanding of who it is that's living inside you this morning because we could say today brother John if I had all the money in the world that would be a wonderful thing but what if I said you had a small portion of all of the money if you said I only have 1% of all the money in the world you would still be a billionaire this morning when we look at God and you say I only have a portion of joy unspeakable how much joy do you have if I only have a portion of all knowledge how much knowledge do you have because he is he is he is unheld back by in his nature and in his person and when you have a portion of the the absolute of of the everything you have more than this world will ever have and can never give to you that's what we have inside of us this morning that when the spirit of God is living inside you by measure yet you have more than enough to take you to the end of your journey you have more than enough to do what you need done in your life this morning whether it's in your body in your spirit in your soul in your life whatever it might be whatever you've been born with whatever curse you feel you're under whatever hardships you're facing the spirit of God is more than enough to take you on through those situations but I want to take us back briefly this morning to set a a pattern in the scriptures and in the Old Testament because we're supposed to do that we don't just want to preach Doctrine out of one one scripture one point but we ought to be able to set a pattern from Genesis to Revelation to show how God moves and I want to talk to you this morning about how God and why God steps out of glory and condescends to be with his people I want to show what God does why does God come down that's the question we want to answer this morning and I want to start by saying this one thing our daytoday circumstances is not what moves God that is not what moves God see we tend to think that God's coming down to deal with circumstances no God's coming down to deal with us and too many times we're looking for change in circumstances when God's trying to change us and so that's what you'll see when Jesus comes is that they did not recognize him as Messiah because they were looking for Isaiah the the Fulfillment of Isaiah to take them under out from under Roman rule and instead he came to set them free from themselves he came to set them free from dead religion he came to fulfill the law so that they could live in newness of Life under the power of His Spirit but because he didn't change their circumstances God and morphate in flesh Emmanuel God With Us did not change their circumstances they rejected him his circum their circumstances in life were not what brought him down but I'll tell you one thing thing that moves God and that's faith in his word you want God to come in your life you have to have faith in his word you have to stand on his word I've said it many times if you want God to answer your prayer find your prayer in his word because if you can find your resting place on the unchanging word of God you have a compass pointing to the north star and he cannot fail to come in and meet your need because now you're standing in his word and his spirit is there to fulfill his word on a daily basis that's what we're supposed to do but we are in a Plan of Redemption we're in a plan that that that God is is moving and doing to bring us back to our original position position so where we are today in our flesh and in life circumstances is not where we were meant to be but God is not here to change our circumstances God is here to change his people his promise is for his people not for their circumstances we'll see God does change circumstances I believe God changes circumstances but that is the last thing on his list the first thing is to change this little person here this poor miserable beggar that I am amen but God moves by faith in his word and God moves according to his Sovereign will and purpose and when God does it he's moving with an intention God doesn't just get bored and say I'm going to come down to earth and spend some time with my family for a little bit God comes down with intention he has a purpose behind his movement he's not up there getting tired or impatient or frustrated time means nothing to God he dwells in eternity he steps into our time to to to to deal with us but he's not up there frustrated he's got a plan that's already laid out he knows the end from the beginning so he's not caught out by surprise he's not wondering what we're going to do he's not wondering how it's going to work out but he steps down now out of his Sovereign Place in glory and steps into this world to do something in our time and in our season he always moves with purpose and I want you to see this as we go back to our opening scripture in Exodus 3 this is now God again speaking to Moses out of the burning bush and he says moreover he said I'm the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac the the god of Jacob and Moses HD his face for he was afraid to look upon God and the Lord said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason of their taskmasters for I know their sorrows now you say brother John he's coming down because of their circumstances Church they've been in those circumstances for 400 years and he never moved why is he moving now he's moving now because in Genesis 15 he said will be there for 400 years and after that is when I will move that's why he's coming down is because he's coming to fulfill his prophetic word in their lives and until that time came they could cry they could moan they could raise their hands they could have Spirit-filled services but it would not change a thing because God operates according to his word not according to our circumstances so he comes down here and he says yes I've heard it but I'm moving because it's time to move because I've set a time I've set a season and God moves in according to his own Sovereign will and plan he says now I am come down to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptians oh it's not just about Deliverance Church you say I want to be set free this morning I want healing I want provision I want guidance but do you want what he has for you because because he doesn't set us free to go do our own thing he didn't set them free so they could all split up he says I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good land and a large you say I don't he doesn't have enough for me Church he's got more than enough for you this morning he's got room for every one of his children he has a place prepared for every one of us every needs subli he says a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey under the place of all these different things so again he's not setting us free to do our own thing did they have a choice yes they did they could have walked out of Egypt and gone their own way but the pillar of fire went before them to show where God wanted them to go and he led them according to what his word said he would do it was to the land that he had declared flowing with milk and honey with a lot of people in it as well amen God's moving to fulfill his word you've got a choice go with him or go your own way and we that there was a lot of people set free that day that couldn't walk into that land we'll see this as we go through our service today God sets people free and what do they do they walk away from him why because there was nothing in them in the first place to follow after these things you look at this scene and you'd say well brother John why did he have to lead them out of Egypt today we'd say start a revolution when you look through history when slaves revolted what did they do they just came up they killed their masters and took what they had and stayed there and made it their own God says I'm not going to put you in a place that's already been provided I'm going to take you to my place I'm going to put you under my word I'm going to put you under my protection I'm going to put you under my provision I'm going to put you under my leadership and I'm going to do a sovereign work to provide for you now you don't take what they have that'll just take you back into slavery I'm going to take you under my protection and I'm going to do things my way and under that you'll be blessed in a way you could never be blessed on your own God's doing it his way and his way alone Church God's God I I'm learning day by day I've learned and I'm continuing to learn when situations arise let God deal with it as a pastor so many times in my Germanic nature is to always nip it in the bud nip it in the bud I've had to learn let go and let God lead cuz you're his children you're not my children you're his sheep you're not my sheep you're his inheritance you're not my inheritance I'm merely a vessel a tool that he can use and so being able to sit back and say God you're God you know all things you see all things I'll tell you one thing I've learned this very very quickly coming into Ministry is I don't see everything I don't know everything I don't understand everything and it's I get I get so much further so much faster if I sit back and I say Lord what would you have me to do rather than go to him and say here's what I know and here's what I think I should do to be open to allow him to be God in these things God has a plan it's a perfect plan and if I can step back and say Lord I Surrender You Lead You Tarzan me Jane you lead the way you know where we're going you know how to do this watch what God does now he says now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of israels come unto me and I've have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppressed them come now therefore and I will send wait God said I've come down how come God's not going who does he send a 40-year past failure a man that's lost his education a man that's lost his ability to speak a man that's lost his ability to lead God sends a 40-year-old want to be an 80-year-old WN to be deliverer that's 40 years past his prime I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt I want you to catch that because we see in scripture too many times people are looking for the Supernatural and they miss the Simplicity of God see we want dreams we want Visions we want tongues and interpretation we want Thunder we want lightning we want something to just drop down and meanwhile God's using a simple little failed man to bring the people out I'm not saying we don't have dreams and Visions in the Supernatural but I'm saying don't miss what God's doing either because God uses people God uses ministers God uses the body of Christ to do his work he's the head he's the inspiration he's the lead he's the guide but he's here working through his body to do things and so many times we're looking for God to do something and he's saying I've already sent you that brother I've already sent you that sister and they're there to help you through this they're there to help you do these things but God moves why to fulfill his word in this situation yes the circumstances were bad the people were in a hard place but they've been there for over 400 years and that hadn't moved God he moved when it was time for his word to be fulfilled and he didn't just move to give them their freedom like I said he didn't just move to give them Choice he gave them a choice but they was hoping that their choice would be his choice that his way would be their way that his worship would be their worship His law would be their law but they had to make a choice that day time and time we see God move on the scene and what's he trying to do Church get people back to his word that's it get people back to his word you say brother John I'm dealing with a hard circumstance today where are you at in his word if you find your way back to his word that's the sure resting place that you're looking for if you can come back to where he told you to be then God can deal with you he can deal with your situations you can have confidence not in our self-righteousness but in simple humble obedience to his word Lord you told me to do it and now I'm doing it and now it's not now we're in his hands we're not in our hands amen now we're under his leadership not under our leadership God was moving to try and get them to a place where they could rest Under the Umbrella of his promise just like Abraham did but in a permanent place rather than so Journey throughout the land and these different things but we have to keep something in mind as we're going through this and this is really the basis of our the message this morning and brother Garfield touched on this on Wednesday night see God has a hierarchy of importance when it comes to dealing with his people okay God has things that matter more God has things that matter moderately and then God has things that really don't matter that much in the big scheme of things God is first and formost interested in our soul that is the very first thing a soul is worth 10,000 worlds to God it is priceless because if you're a child of God that soul is a part of him amen and so it's worth everything to him that's the Eternal portion of our being if we are a child of God now I want to take us back to Ezekiel 36 because God's talking about what matters to him you'll know what matters to God based on how he works if it doesn't matter to him then he doesn't work with it but if it does matter to him then he steps into it and we've read this before and I'm not going to read the whole scripture here but I want you to point to to to look at this idea he's saying to Israel and we are Abraham seed by faith we under this same Covenant he says I'm going to take you from the heathens gather you from where you are I'm going to a Sprinkle clean water on you and you'll be clean from your filthiness and your idols and I'll cleanse you then he says a new heart will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh I'll give you a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them and I've preached on this before so I won't preach too much on it this morning but you have to understand here is that nowhere do I appear in the actions of this verse God says I God doesn't say I will do this and you will do that and it will be a perfect work God says I will I will I will and I say I will receive I will receive I will receive and out of that comes a perfect work it is not God plus me it's God God God and out of that comes god in me it is his perfect work amen because when we add our portion to God it turns it into imperfection it takes away the absolute it takes away the truth it takes away the foundation it h breeds the seed because it Blends intellect with the word and that doesn't get us anywhere we saw that with Eve in the beginning we saw it with Canan and his worship when we add ourselves to what God wants it takes it into imperfection okay if we could do it Church we'd have already done it look around we've had 6,000 years to do God's work and what has happened nothing you've got 30 on Thousand denominations saying that they can do it that's that's why we're not a denomination the minute you put a period behind what you believe you kick God out because youve said it only goes as far as my understanding no no no we have to be open for God to further reveal himself to us on a daily basis amen the world tells us we know how to raise families we know how to take care of the earth we know how to take care of the people we know how to have a good marriage and do they no all we have is Fallen failed systems and people seems like today we struggle less to survive right we have refrigeration we have a supply chain that allows us to eat mangoes in January in New Finland okay unheard of supplies of food and and a way to to to have things when we don't plant and we don't Harvest and we don't hunt and we don't kill or butcher these things we have every need supplied so that we don't have to survive and yet today people are struggling yet to live with purpose all that it's done has made our lives more complicated and we've lost our reason for living it takes the word it takes God inside of us to give us purpose for life I think that's what we're seeing today so much as people go so far out on the limb because they're trying to find a purpose and so what do they do they find the world's craziest cause and they decide I'm going to support it I'm going to live for it I'm going to make this my goal in life rather than coming back to the Simplicity of the word of God look at Cain Cain tried to do it Cain tried to add his way of worship to God's requirement and God corrected him God gave him an opportunity and yet Cain turned it down Nimrod did the same thing and you see it then Through the Ages even into this day is men and women trying to produce a system that will give them the results that God said only come through him by simple obedience to his word takes God in our lives to do those things to get is truly living the way that we ought to live and we see if we look in the Old Testament God comes down time and time again he comes down with Moses he comes down with Joshua he comes down in the judges he comes down through Samuel he comes down through Saul he comes through David and then he starts to get pushed out more and more and more and yet God comes down time and time again but the effects are always temporary it's always temporary because the people couldn't hold on to him the people couldn't hold on to Victory the people couldn't hold on to the word their own nature their own Fallen flesh would p pull them away and so time and time again they go from blessing into curse they go from blessing into judgment because they kept walking away from the word God was with them God condescended to come down time and time again and yet it never held them it never held them you look at David a man after God's Own Heart the very desires of his heart were the same as God's and yet you read the Psalms and you see David's frustration with himself for not being able to live the life that he wants to live God being with us is not enough it's going to take God in us and we'll see that as we go through this this little mini portion or this Min series that we're doing here we've got a power today that they don't have I'm not saying we don't have ups and downs but the way that God looks at us now is different too because he looks through the blood but we're talking about this hierarchy that God's had that God has and we look in Ezekiel 36 and we see that God is talking about the soul he's talking about our spirit which is our nature he's pointing to our attributes and he's pointing to a time he's prophesying of a time where he'll change us from the inside out where he'll do an inner work to produce an outer effect see to many times under the law it was all about the outer person and the inner person never changed and it could never make you perfect Paul said even the blood that you that was shed even the sacrifices the atonement that was given it couldn't make you perfect and it couldn't cleanse your conscience and so people would walk out the same way that they came in but he's showing here in in Ezekiel 36 that he's not going to change the outer man he's going to change the Inner Man and it'll have an outer work that's the greatest change that you can have in this life church is an inner life it's a new creation is what he's pointing to because the old creation is born under sin he's wanting you to be born by the word now he's wanting you to be a new creation and so from this we see a hierarchy and I I would call it this morning spiritual triage when you go into a hospital if you go in and you have a torn Little Nail guess when you're going to be seen never because you got people that are having heart attacks ATT and you got people with broken bones and you got people that are struggling to breathe and people with rashes and cuts and wounds you got a little hang nail you're never going to get into that into that doctor in the AR cuz you have something that's not life-threatening and so when God looks at us he's got a a spiritual triage and the first thing he starts with is the soul because God wants to get your soul in the proper condition amen so that's what he came down to do and then he comes down after that and he says look not only is your soul needing a touch but your spirit needs a touch now your spirit is your nature and he says you need a nature change and that's a part of the three works of Grace because remember what brother Brown would say he says listen you couldn't even get along with yourself under your original nature you can't get along with other people you definitely can't get along with God so he has to give you a new nature so you can get along with God's nature he needs to give you a new spirit so you can get along with his spirit and when he does that then that opens up the opportunity for his spirit to come in inside of our of Our Lives amen so our spirit does not reside in our soul his Spirit resides in our soul and our spirit has to become subject to his spirit because remember the soul is the Throne of the life it it's the seed of power so whatever influence your soul is under is what will have ultimate Authority in your life so if my spirit is in my soul then guess who's in control this Fallen guy even if I'm a Child of God that's not going to get me there the new spirit he gives me is not enough that's why he says I've got to give you my spirit and only after I give you my spirit will you be able to walk in my statutes the way I want you to that's the only way you can walk and live by the word is by my spirit that's the only way it's going to happen amen so the Holy Spirit dwells in our soul it's the Seal of our soul Paul said until the day of our full Redemption amen and that Spirit though is the promise of God it's a part of the promise of God and that will go with us even to the other side because you remember your spirit is connected to your character you don't have the right Spirit then your character is going to be all wrong what is it that makes us do the right thing it's the influence of our spirit it's the influence of the Holy Spirit on our spirit but you go and you look in the Book of Revelation you'll see there's prophets talking to John and even over there they still have the spirit of a prophet they have a nature of a prophet remember that one John talks to to two different a prophet up there two different times he says don't bow to me I'm of your brethren the prophets he still had that nature there but he always was pointing to somebody else Samuel when Saul spoke to him he still had the nature of a prophet even over there see it goes with us but the one we take with us is from God that's why it can go with us it's not my nature now it's a nature he gave me and so we'll go over there and we'll have that with us I believe but God first deals with our soul and then next God is interested in our spirit in our nature and then after that comes our flesh our body our health in these Earthly conditions God isn't looking to change your Earthly conditions or deal with your flesh if your spirit is at odds with him and if your soul is not sealed to the day of your Redemption then God is more interested in that than in your body see so often we're we're looking for him to change this and he's saying we've got a bigger problem we've got a deeper problem and so we've got to deal with that listen you can look in the scriptures where God will sovereignly come down and touch somebody's body and usually they walk away and they have nothing to do with God after that some do most don't you look in the scriptures in Jesus and he heals the 10 lepers how many came back one one the rest went their way the scripture says that Jesus healed thousands upon thousands that Jesus would sit down and he would preach the word and then it would say he healed them everyone not a single person left that meeting unhealed and yet on the day of Pentecost how many people are in the upper room thousands of people healed 120 in the upper room and those people that he healed went and rejected him and crucified him why because they were in it for their comfort for their ease for their health for their emotions whatever it was but they weren't in it for relationship they weren't in it to be right with God they were just in it to have an easier life so if we're looking to God to do something in this life and we're at odds in our soul or our spirit I'll say this this morning it's better that you ask him to deal with the other things than your body than your circumstances because he'll allow those to go on until we get into line with what he wants us to do and then when those things are in good standing God will jump to our circumstances I've me I've mentioned this this this scripture many times in the past while I want to read it this morning John said beloved I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health and we all say Amen but he says even as thy soul prospers listen look what God did to job to give him a revelation of a redeemer and a life beyond this one he took away every enjoyable circumstance and wealth from his life for the sake of his soul for the sake of a revelation that would keep job going no matter what these things are temporal they're temporal it's all going to burn it's all going to burn that's what God thinks of it it's all going to burn at the end but what looking for is that soul and that Spirit to be changed above all things but I like how Jesus did it when he was here because he he he reflected it back on us see we can say look God wants us to be healthy and prosper even as our soul prosperous but then Jesus would come along and he would say focus on your soul focus on the things of God focus on the kingdom of God and he'd say therefore take no thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewith shall we be wherewith all shall we be clothed listen we need clothes you can't can't come to church if you don't have clothes church amen we need it we need a roof over our head we need food to eat but he says for all these things do the Gentiles seek we're Gentiles if you didn't know it that's what this world is seeking after food clothing shelter stuff amen things to satisfy this outer shell he says for after all these things do the Gentiles seek but your heavenly or for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of these things he's saying you don't ignore them at your peril you ignore them by faith because God knows what you have need of and so if we're out there killing ourselves to get those things he says you missed the mark You're not where you need to be he says but seek ye first the kingdom of God what is the kingdom of God the kingdom of God cometh not with observation but it dwells within you the kingdom of God is the holy spirit see speak first the Holy Spirit and he says righteousness what is God's righteousness God's Will and God's way if you've got the Holy Spirit you will eventually seek his will in his way because that's what his spirit is there to do Jesus said I can do nothing except the father shows me the spirit of God inside him drove him or caused him to seek after God's will he says and if you do that all these things shall be added unto you now I'm not trying to tell you God doesn't care about your health God doesn't care about your wealth God doesn't care about this flesh God doesn't care about our suffering listen he took the worst beating a man ever got so that we could be healed it matters to him but it's the last on his list of what matters if I could put it that way it's a part of our promise it's a part of our inheritance but he wants our soul and our spirit to be at Health before he moves in those Realms amen we're here on this Earth and listen Church we're always going to have tough circumstances that's the nature of sin that's the nature of being in a world that is out from under the control or or or surrender to God is that things are always going to be tough and everything in this flesh is temporary listen we can get healed today and be sick tomorrow and we can live our life in Total Health and we're still going to die if God terries and the resurrection and the Rapture doesn't happen God will allow this flesh to experience extreme conditions because he's trying to get us ready on the inner man to go in a resurrection and a Rapture this flesh is unredeemable it's unfixable that's where the greatest battle is these days isn't it it's to bring this flesh subject to the word of God it always has been that way this flesh is not redeemed it is not Sanctified it is lost it is failed and it's going to take a glorification to make it worth anything what happens is our Heavenly has to come down it has to swallow up this flesh and when it does that then it will dissolve everything that Satan ever did in this flesh and we'll have a body like unto his glory glorious body but that's the last thing God does Church why because that's the last thing that matters the first thing that matters is to get this man ready on the inside so that the outer man can be changed that's what God's trying to do so God has come down in many ways and many times with differing effect through the Old Testament but as we come into him trying to change us into a New Testament Church God steps into flesh and this is a GameChanger because remember God always dwelt above us in the pillar of Fire he was Untouchable unattainable you couldn't look at him face to face you couldn't Moses saw the back part of a man and just that seeing the back side of God put a glow on his face that required him to wear a veil but now God steps into flesh and he didn't just come down Church to have some a new experience he didn't come down for a thrill or because he was bored remember God condescends with purpose he's coming down with purpose and so he's revealing now as he comes down and steps into Christ he's revealing his name he's revealing his image he's revealing his purpose his identity and so he's coming down with a particular intention in mind and look at what Paul would say now is looking back after all these things that happened he says now I say that the heir as long as he is a child differeth nothing from a servant though he be a Lord of all but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of time was come church we were in the same circumstances for 6,000 years he did not come down because of our circumstances but when the fullness of time was come in other words when God said now's time that's when God did it we're going to see how critical this is when we get to Revelation 10 when you get to Revelation 10 and God steps down again he says what what's he saying in Revelation 10 time should be no more God comes down and he says it's time for a change in the fullness of time God determines that God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons so under the law you could not come into what God had for you Amen in other words as Christ has come and he's born in flesh he was born through a woman but he was not born by a woman he was born by the spirit he was a spoken word Son of God he was not born by man's desire he was born under the law Paul said he was born under the original Covenant in other words Christ was born into the same circumstances that we all deal with he wasn't born into a perfect situation a perfect world he was born into a perverted Fallen religious world and in that he had to come into perfection he didn't get an easy Road from his birth which was under a shadow of being illegitimate all the way through his life he was under a cloud of people thinking that he was something different than what he was he was born into the same Pig pin than you and I were born into and he had to live by the same rules that they did under the law he was held accountable to the same things they were held accountable to amen and he if he did his work properly under that law then he could redeem us that was a requirement now we're speaking of the condescending God this morning and like I said God always comes with purpose and the big purpose Paul tells us and we certainly would know this today is to redeem us that is what God's been trying to do this entire book of the Bible is a book of redemption is to bring us back to our original condition our original position our original relationship our our original Authority and power our original purpose it's to bring us back to our original estate amen it's not a finished work when Christ came down but it's the finishing of the first part that he could start the real work after that amen so God living in human flesh tells us why he came watch what Jesus says because Jesus would share his purpose so many times in different ways he says think not that I am come to destroy the law or the prophets I am not come to destroy but to fulfill then he jumps down and and he he says these words and church I want this to be encouragement to you this morning for I say unto you that except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees you shall in no case enter into the Kingdom of Heaven see the priesthood in that day it was all about image it was all about representation it was all about your reput your reputation and so they gave off this Aura they gave off this idea that they were perfect that they didn't sin Jesus said you tithe of your mint and cumin you get a little sprig of it and you cut off a then you give it to the temple they they they they followed the 613 laws that they had to the end degree apparently apparently amen can I preach this morning your appearance is not what's going to get you in there because he says unless your righteousness exceeds what you think is the best of the best here you'll never get into the kingdom of heaven church you can sit here this morning and you can say I'm not like brother so- and so I'm not like sister so and so you can have a complex about your lack of Works about where you're at in your life let me tell you this morning it doesn't matter whose standard you hold up if you think you're worse than them it doesn't matter because they're not getting in on their works anyways it's not by works we're getting in it's by Grace but don't use that as a license for disgrace remember what scripture says provoke spoke one another to Good Works we ought to hold each other accountable we ought to be able to say to one another hey I don't think you should be doing that I don't think that's the best decision I don't believe that's the way that the word wants us to live our lives we should be able to do that amen but we're not getting it done by works we're not getting into Heaven by works don't stop working but don't rest on those Works don't rest on your reputation cuz compared to Christ's reputation ours is as filthy rags the best of the best of the best of us is as filthy rags Paul said that's what our righteousness is so how are we going to get it done the only way we're going to get it done is when the I am says I will and we accept it when the Everlasting everpresent God comes down in the fullness of time for your life and says I'm going to do a work and we say yay Lord be it unto me according to your word we accept what he did at Calvary the finished absolute atonement the the work of Calvary is how I'm getting into heaven it's the work that he did not the work that I'm going to do he was Perfection he is perfection that's how I'm getting in is on his works not on mine God said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased that's the only one that ever got that in flesh up to that point and that was before he ever got the Holy Ghost and became God incarnate he said in his flesh I'm pleased remember Jesus was the same as Adam he's a word born son of God and he lived a perfect life and then the scripture dwells the scripture says that the spirit of God came and dwelt in him and that's when he became the fullness of God in a body he had every attribute he had every Power he had every element of God inside of him without limitation everything that God was he poured into that body of Jesus Christ every aspect of him God condescended to live in human flesh for the first time that's what he did watch now as Jesus talks about his purpose on Earth we're not going to finish our thought today but we'll set it foundation for Wednesday night Jesus says I came to fulfill the law see the law was a contract the law was just a placeholder it was not Perfection it could not perfect us what it did was it kept people busy until God could come and do a real Work If we're honest with it all it did was kept us temporarily from judgment year after year if we did what he told us then he would hold back judgment but it couldn't change us at all and that's why it was only a placeholder the law was a covenant of Works God said if you do this then I will do this or I won't do that as the case may be if you will sacrifice a lamb every year then I will cover your sins for a year if you will uh stay away for a week after you touch a dead body then you're allowed to come back into the temple and if you'll do this then I'll do that and if you'll do this then I'll do that and it was a covenant of works and it was just a temporary placeholder until Christ could come amen but it could never bring us Perfection all it could bring was condemnation if we were honest with ourselves all it could bring was condemnation it could not bring us into the presence of God it couldn't make us feel good because knowing in our own conscience and in our mind I still messed up today listen I might go through a day by God's grace where nobody in my family thinks I made a mistake probably not because they're eagle-eyed and Eagle eared but maybe there'll be a day where they say boy dad did pretty good today I didn't see him do anything wrong and yet I did something wrong I guarantee you right the law of Works only brings condemnation so God's got to get us out of works and get us into something else and that's what he's coming down to do and the only way for that law to be set aside was for the law to be fulfilled see when we sign a contract today it's between at least two parties and they say if you do this then I will do that if you will give me this car then I will give you this money and when they give us the car and I give them the money the contract is fulfilled the Covenant is fulfilled but under this one the requirement was that to fulfill the law you had to do two things you had to meet every requirement you had to live a life of sinless Perfection and then if you did that and God acknowledged it then you had to willingly lay down your life as a blood sacrifice for every other person that couldn't do it cuz remember under the law the sacrifices were animals it was the blood of animals and that blood the life of that blood couldn't come back and it would take the life of the blood of a human a perfect one to come back on us to bring us into Perfection so God stepping down into FLH God condescending into flesh to live perfectly and give his life is the greatest work of Grace you'll ever find God came down and he allowed his word perfect body to be ripped to shreds more mangled more destroyed than any other person in history so that you and I could come back to him that's what he did church God loves us so much that he came down to fulfill his own contract can you imagine if I went into a dealership and I signed a contract that if they if if they would give me a brand new uh Honda Odyssey that I would give them the $60,000 they want and I come in and I take that van and then they say by the way we'll pay your van for you they won't even do that for 60 Grand and yet God comes down Steps From the portals of Glory from his Perfection his Holiness he comes down to where they will spit on him where they will beat him they will reject him they will mock him they will tell lies about him him they'll besmer his reputation they will reject him in every possible way and he says I'll give you my life I'll let you destroy who I am for your sake listen to this he says God manifested in the pillar of fire god manifested in the son and now God manifested in you he says the same holy spirit that was the dispensation of the fatherhood Jesus was the dispensation of the F of the sunship and this is the dispensation of the the Holy Spirit that's the reason we are commissioned to baptize you in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost watch how he explains this now we don't baptize in titles because titles are not a name he says he why do we do this it's showing that God has unfolded himself condescended coming down and working his way through notice this Redemption process is also a process of revealing God he says it started with God above us as the father father in the pillar of fire he was working through the law then he comes down as God With Us Christ in flesh God and morphate in flesh and through that he does the work of Calvary and then the process continues with God in us Christ in you the hope of glory the Holy Spirit but it's still one and the same God from start to finish and it's all part of this Redemption process and then he says these beautiful words he says working his way through working his way through there's a a process going on there are phases going on it's not just one and done but there's this whole thing that's being unraveled and shown to us amen he says he couldn't enter into sin church that ought to make a shout this morning because if he couldn't enter into sin and he's entered into you by the holy spirit this morning what does that tell you about where you are this morning it tells you that there is no sin attributed to you it means that you are perfect that you are righteous that you are accepted in the Beloved if you have truly received the Holy Spirit this morning there is nothing that can stand before God and accuse you you stand perfect Hallelujah you stand perfect this morning if he has stepped into you it is his approval that matters and he says you are perfect you are blameless you are spotless you are sinless you are me and I am you praise the Lord that means you're a new creation it's not Jonathan klet anymore it's a Son of God it's a daughter of God that stands before him this morning he says he couldn't enter sin but he cleared his way as he went sometimes we're trying to jump to the end Church let's take it one day at a time let's take it one step at a time sufficient to the day is the evil thereof let's not look to tomorrow let's deal with today and have faith for today for God so loved man that he wants to come down and fellowship with him God tonight the same Jehovah God that spoke to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden lives in every born again man or woman trying his best to make you believe him he says have faith in him step out don't you doubt one bit he says but the same God that was with Abraham is the same God that is tonight he said it might make me act funny and be be a crazy man by this world but I cannot deny him who did so much for me he took my place in death he took my place at Calvary he did all these things he condescended from heaven from the pearly white Thrones to become a man catch this to taste my suffering to go through my temptation to know how to be the right kind of a mediator in me to lead me and guide me to eternal life and through his poverty I am made Rich Hallelujah through his poverty he emptied out his treasures and gave them to me through his death I am given life eternal life Hallelujah why did God condescend and dwell in Christ it's all tied to that great work of redemption but we see it's in phases and each phase has its own Works see some sometimes God comes down to start a work sometimes God comes down to finish a work and then sometimes God comes down to continue a work and then there's the final completion of it all at the end see it's All Phases and if we in our Humanity what happens is we get so frustrated in the phases because we know what's coming we know what's supposed to happen and we're trying to jump phases and God's saying if you'll just let me work my way through it in you you'll have so much more peace and rest in this situation let me work through it with you because I'm trying to get the inner man ready to go not just the outer man watch what Jesus says oh I love this he says the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy he says I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly why did God condescend in Christ that we might have life this isn't just be alive life this isn't just have breath life this is Zoey life this is God's Own Life Church I started crying when I read this yesterday because so often we're coming down and we're saying Lord I need this Lord I want this Lord I have need of this Lord show me this Lord show me that and he's saying if you only understood how much you're undercutting what I have for you because you're so limited by this fleshly needs that you're forgetting there's a Life Source inside of you that if you could just get those channels cleaned out I'd step in in a way you've never experienced before see we're so Bound by our stinking thinking we're so Bound by what this world is embedded in our lives that it inhibits the spirit of God inside of us from doing what it's supposed to be doing he didn't come so we could have our way we came so he could have his way he didn't come so we could have our thoughts he came so we could have his thoughts he didn't come so we could have our satisfaction so that we could have his satisfaction more abundantly pressed down shaken together and still pouring out church I want life more abundantly this morning I say Lord lift me up to a higher plane where I can let go of what this man wants this thinking that so failed and come to a place where the spirit of God could have its way in my life where I could surrender even my very situations my very hardships and say Lord have your way in my life Lord do what you're trying to do and help me to have a right attitude towards it help me to have a right Spirit towards it and don't let me get bitter let me trust you oh he didn't come so we could just have a little bit of Life see I said before we all have a portion of him but that portion is still more abundantly Hallelujah more abundantly there's more than enough to go around that's yeah there's that old song they sing I'm drinking from my saucer cuz my cup is overflowed see we don't tend to drink saucers and cups anymore do we we just have our tea in a cup but the old way the the the the the high futin way was you had your teacup in a saucer and that was there to catch the drips but see life abundantly is the tea is overflowed the cup and now you're drinking from the saucer Hallelujah that's what his offer is church God wants you to have his life more than you wanted God wants to bless you more than you want to be blessed but he's doing it in phases and ways and plans according to his desire and his Sovereign will not ours and what we do is we limit him by trying to Define what he's supposed to do to bless us to work in our lives in a particular Way Church I want something that raises me above those clouds of Life the storms the noise isn't the noise starting to get really really loud i' say you can't every time I turn on the news I think I should never have done that I'll be honest you know when I drive into the office or something I'll turn on CBC in the morning every time I I I say why did I do that I never learn I never learn trying to catch up on things you know I never learned there's never anything that's that's good or unbiased or clean it's a mess it's a mess it's a mess and it it embeds into our life amen but if we'll let that Abundant Life flow out of the Soul but we've got to be in the right place remember what brother Mark was talking about there when he took this service a few weeks or months ago he said how does God use you keep your life clean keep the junk out that's what clogs up the channels What influences are you under this morning listen your soul can be sealed but your spirit can be affected by many things and this flesh can absolutely be affected what is it that's clogging the channels up that life abundantly isn't flowing it's not God it's not God that's doing it Jesus said this I am come a light into the world that whosoever believeth in me should not abide in darkness and if any man hear my words and believe not I judge him not for I came not to judge the world but to save the world now that's that the bride's message has always come we see that in Revelation the spirit and the bride say come the message is come on get in but there's a judgment coming at the end of it all church but he says until that time the doors open I don't want you to live in Shadows and darkness I don't want you to live a life where you don't understand what's going on I don't want you to live a life where you don't know why you're here I want you saved secure amen not just a temporary effect when Christ saves it's not saved today lost tomorrow amen it's not in today out tomorrow it's not up today down tomorrow scripture says he saves us to the uttermost you know what the uttermost means all the way to the end one saved always saved I believe that doesn't mean we don't have our ups and downs I'm not trying to say we don't but he says you don't have to you don't have to be there you don't have to be in that place of up and down saved secure resting that's what he's offering he says in first John he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinth from the beginning and for this purpose the Son of God was manifested this is why Christ came that he might destroy the works of the devil I like that summary and this is where we're going to close this morning God condescended into human flesh in Christ Jesus so he could destroy the works so he could do every undo every effect that Satan has had on this Earth he came to undo it he came to make it as if it never happened but that word destroy there is is a bit different than what we would think it doesn't mean destruction as we would think of it means to loose it means to set free it means to dissolve it means to make it as if it as if it never happened in the first place Christ came to set his children free to live in Liberty as we preached last service he came to set his children free he came to turn the tables on the devil you know one of the first things that he did was he set Mary Magdalene free she had seven Demons Inside Of Her Seven demons and he went and he set her free to serve him and she went all the way up to that day on Pentecost what does he do he comes to the woman at the well does he change her circumstances Church no he answers the questions she's had all of her life and what does it do it Sparks something to life inside of her she went home and she still had a common law husband now I believe with all my heart she got rid of him but he changed her he set her free to worship he set her free to praise he set her free from everything that Society had dumped on her he set her free from her own decisions even and he set her free and remember what we said last time if your son sets you free you'll be free indeed I say it this morning once free always free when he does it it's a finished work that's why he came down was to break every chain to loose every shackle to heal every disease to break every oppression but it's starts with the inner man first thing I've got to be set free from is myself that's the biggest thing that he's got to do in this life everything else will fall in line after that he said Jesus came to destroy the works of the devil that's why God was made both soul and body Jesus had both soul and body and yet was God he said he came to take on himself the full form of man to redeem the full form of man back to God that's why he came in flesh and in Soul that's the reason Jesus could say it's not me that doth the works it's my father that dwelleth in me notice what he's saying the full form Body Soul Spirit remember he's come to destroy the works of the devil Church he's not going to leave anything untouched he's not going to leave anything behind he's not going to leave anything unresolved every single aspect of this Redemption is perfect it's complete and it's absolute amen listen you may go into a rapture sick I don't believe it I believe that if we're going into rapturing Faith then we're going to have healing Faith but you may be sick on that day of the Rapture but as that body change happens Hallelujah that sickness will lose its hold and not only that sickness death itself will pull its thing out and you will realize once and forever you're you're healed you're set free cuz in this flesh dwells no good thing it's always going to be problems even to the end it it'll be a battle even to the end it'll be a battle but as we rise Hallelujah As We rise that last thing will be changed and now we're in Perfection that's it Body Soul and Spirit the full form of man redeemed back he doesn't leave anything alone church I'm so glad he'll undo it as if it never happen he'll perfect Us by his Spirit by his word he'll lead us by his Spirit he'll get us off of Satan's gospel get us on his gospel he'll get us off of our leadership and the world's leadership into his leadership that's the battle we're in today take God at his word and let him lead that's it it's a battle for our minds it's a battle for control of our decisions the way that we live and we walk and do things day by day as we start to close I want you to see what this is going to look like as we set a foundation for next service he says behold what manner of love the father had bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him knew him not now catch verse two this is so beautiful beloved soon we are the sons of God in the future we will be the sons of God no now now are we the sons of God that's our position okay never confuse your position with your circumstances okay now are we the sons of God he says and it does not yet appear we shall be see sometimes it's hard to believe we're a child of God because we look in our flesh we look at our struggles and we say how can I be a child of God but Paul says it clearly we are now sons of God we are now children of God our condition may not match our position but it doesn't change our position and because our position cannot be changed we've got a work that's going on by the word of God that's why we need Redemption to make our condition match our position that's what Redemption is he says we doesn't appear we shall be in other words we're not in our final form yet he says but we know that when he shall appear we shall see in legal terms shell is an absolute it's certainty there's no wiggle room in Shell if the law says you shall stop at every stop sign there is no wiggle room there to roll through to occasionally blow through a stop sign shall is an absolute and God saying we shall be like him you can take that to the bank that's a that that's God's covenant to you we shall be like him he says for we shall see him as he is I want to ask you a question before we read this last verse how good a job is God going to do how good is a job is God going to do listen if he is the Eternal all powerful all knowing god that cannot disobey his own word how good a job is God going to do sometimes we're limited by our own thinking you can't change me this is too embedded I've been fighting it too long been dealing with it too long still haven't got the victory prayed and prayed and prayed still haven't got the victory does God do incomplete works let me show you give you some insight into the kind of work that God does verse 9 says whosoever is born of God does not commit sin that's the kind of work God does he says for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God the job that God does is so good so complete that Satan has nothing to use against us there is no sin found in you that's the kind of work God does Perfection the same Perfection of Christ that's what he's talking about here God has condescended to give us his own Perfection that's what he's doing bringing us back into himself amen God has condescended to destroy everything that Satan has laid on us 6,000 years of Satan working and there'll be a day where in a moment in a twinkling of an eye done that's it and When God says it's done it's done and Satan can't do a thing about it that's the kind of work God does amen God bless you let's stand this morning the whole purpose of God coming down is restoration it's to bring us back to our original condition our original position but it's God's work as we spoke of last service this is God doing this it's not mine it's not yours yes God uses people but I'm not going to change myself that's for sure takes God inside of us to do it it's the person of God living inside of us that changes everything Israel had signs and wonders for 40 years in the desert and it didn't change a person God had to change from just being with us to being in us and when he condescends CU he was above us in that Pillar of Fire then he came down in Christ but remember now he condescends to you and I and that's the greatest condescension when he's in the pillar of fire that's of his own making and Perfection Christ is the perfect body but now he condescends to dwell in sinful flesh and that's the greatest condescension you can see is when something that is greater than you dains to come down and say I'll live in you and I'll change you and I'll bring you into a place of overcoming power amen that's the condescending God Amen God bless you let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we're not preaching religion this morning Lord we not preaching tradition Lord we're preaching power and life Lord we're pre we're preaching a Redemption that changes Us From the Inside Out Lord and not here today and gone tomorrow Lord but it's an overcoming power inside of the believer Lord that draws us back to you by your word Lord I pray you help us to have a rest in your perfect Lord word this morning that declares that when it's all said and done we shall be like you Lord that there'll be no marks against us not because of our Perfection Lord but because we've accepted completely the perfect working of your word in our lives by your spirit Lord help us day by day Lord help us to keep fighting Lord help help us to feed our relationship with you Lord to not take for granted the knowledge of the truth Lord being raised in a good family Lord of knowing
