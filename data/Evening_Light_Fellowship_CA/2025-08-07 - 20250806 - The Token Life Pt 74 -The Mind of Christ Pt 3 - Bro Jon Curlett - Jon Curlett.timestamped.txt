[16:50] Amen. Heavenly Father, we once again
[16:53] bow, Lord, to thank you for the
[16:54] opportunity to come into your house,
[16:56] Lord, to worship you. And as the song
[16:58] says, Lord, then we can take the
[17:01] opportunity, Lord, to thank you for the
[17:03] grace that you bestowed upon us. As
[17:05] Lord, if as the scripture says, Father,
[17:08] if we were to thank you from the rising
[17:10] of the sun till the going down of the
[17:11] same, we wouldn't sufficiently thank you
[17:13] for all that you've done for us. So
[17:16] Lord, we just pray, Father, that as we
[17:19] Lord, enter into this service today,
[17:20] Father, that you would just help us,
[17:22] Lord, to put all things aside, Lord,
[17:24] that are not pleasing to you, Lord, or
[17:27] Father, we just would interfere, Lord,
[17:29] with the going forth of the word. We
[17:31] just pray, Father, that you'd help us,
[17:33] Lord, by grace to just to enter in,
[17:35] Lord, by by grace, Father, that the Holy
[17:38] Spirit have preeminence in every one of
[17:40] our hearts, Lord. and that you would
[17:42] minister, Lord, through the pastor,
[17:44] Father, to Brother John as he brings the
[17:46] word, Father. We just pray, Lord, that
[17:48] the anointing would be able to lift him
[17:50] up, Father, and lift us up as well,
[17:52] Father, that our faith might be
[17:54] increased. And Lord, we just pray that
[17:56] you'd minister to each and every one,
[17:58] Lord, the requests that were mentioned
[17:59] tonight.
[18:01] Father, you know, Lord, each and every
[18:03] one, we just hold them up before you,
[18:05] Father. Just praying, Lord, that you
[18:07] would just, Father, answer prayer. And
[18:10] Lord, just do a wonderful thing, Lord,
[18:12] in everyone's life. We pray. So bless
[18:14] us, Father, as we commit this service to
[18:16] you. May you bless Lord, Brother Joe and
[18:19] and Lord, the musicians, Father. May
[18:21] each one, Lord, be able to put
[18:23] themselves aside as well as the pastor
[18:25] and let you operate the gift, Father, in
[18:27] each one of them. So be with them, we
[18:29] pray. Be with us all as we commit this
[18:31] service into your hands in Jesus
[18:32] Christ's name. Amen.

[37:20] father. Lord, how thankful we are, Lord,
[37:24] for how good your greatness is, Lord,
[37:27] for your mercy, your sovereign touch,
[37:29] Lord, that reaches down into our lives
[37:31] and pulls us out of this mess, Lord, and
[37:34] raises us up into fellowship with Christ
[37:36] in heavenly places. Lord, how unworthy
[37:39] we are, but how grateful we are this

[37:52] finished work this evening, Lord, that

[37:58] season. So Lord, we ask you to take this
[38:00] service once more, Lord, that you would
[38:02] speak to your bride, Lord. Take us to a
[38:04] higher plane, Lord, a deeper faith,
[38:06] Lord, that we could just rise above the
[38:08] things that try and hold us down, that
[38:10] try and pull us back, Lord, that try and
[38:12] anchor us and choke us out, Lord. That
[38:14] we could step a little further in our
[38:15] walk with you, Lord, to be shaped more
[38:17] like Christ today. We ask in Jesus
[38:19] Christ's name we're praying it. Amen.
[38:22] And amen. God bless you. Amen. Let's
[38:26] turn to First Peter chapter 4 if we
[38:28] would. First Peter chapter 4. Good to
[38:32] see those that can make it. If this
[38:33] keeps up, we're going to have to start
[38:34] sending the deacons out into the
[38:35] highways and the byways. Amen. But I
[38:38] know some have to stay home for
[38:40] different reasons. And uh we're just
[38:42] trusting God's grace. Amen. And we're
[38:43] thankful that brother Paul and Sister
[38:45] Kimberly's
[38:46] acorage has been spared at least thus
[38:49] far that it's gone the other way. But
[38:51] now brother Bob potentially and brother
[38:53] Matt are in the in the the path. So
[38:55] we're trusting God's grace. Amen. That
[38:57] God will just guard that God will keep
[38:58] the fires back. We've got the whiffing
[39:00] family up in Conception Bay North and uh
[39:03] I think they're still a ways away from
[39:04] them but potentially they are uh they're
[39:06] they're there as well. So we're just
[39:08] trusting God to take care of his people.
[39:10] Amen. Amen. The forecast says no rain.
[39:13] If we need rain, God can send the rain.
[39:16] Amen. Let's trust him for that. But
[39:18] we're thankful thankful for each one.
[39:20] That's uh that God has spared and the
[39:22] the way that he keeps us in this life.
[39:24] Amen. Want to remember of course the
[39:27] family of brother Albert Snow. The uh
[39:29] the viewings would be tonight, today and
[39:30] tonight. And then the funeral I think is
[39:32] tomorrow um privately of course. But uh
[39:35] be free be uh you know if you if you've
[39:38] known them it would be a good idea to
[39:39] send them a note to brother Gourd by
[39:40] text as was sent out by brother Joe.
[39:42] I've sent one from my family um
[39:44] personally since we know them and had a
[39:46] personal relationship just expressing
[39:48] our thanks for their hospitality and
[39:50] kindness to us when we visit a few years
[39:52] ago and we've seen them as well since
[39:53] then. But feel free to send that
[39:55] yourself. And then later on, I think the
[39:57] idea is we'll send up a gift from the
[39:59] church to Sister Freda and we'll send a
[40:01] general um note of of condolences from
[40:04] the church at that point as well. But
[40:05] just trusting God's grace to her. It's a
[40:07] hard thing to just one minute you've got
[40:09] your spouse and the next they're gone to
[40:10] glory. Amen. No goodbyes, no prep, no no
[40:13] anything, you know. So, we want to
[40:15] definitely remember her and his family
[40:17] of course and children and those
[40:18] different ones there. Amen. 1 Peter
[40:21] chapter 4,
[40:23] he says this, "For then as much for as
[40:25] much then as Christ hath suffered for us
[40:27] in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise
[40:31] with the same mind. For he that hath
[40:33] suffered in the flesh hath ceased from
[40:36] sin, that he no longer should live the
[40:39] rest of his time in the flesh to the
[40:41] lusts of men." See, there's a time
[40:43] before and there's a time after. There's
[40:44] a there's a way of serving before and
[40:46] there's a way of serving after. He says,
[40:48] "But after this, he should live to the
[40:51] will of God." Amen. God bless you. You
[40:53] can have your seats this evening. And I
[40:56] certainly appreciate the cooler
[40:57] temperature in the church. I can feel it
[40:59] already, brother Bob. So, I thank you
[41:00] for that. It'll be at least five minutes
[41:02] before I take my coat off at this rate.
[41:03] So, amen. But I want to continue our
[41:05] thought this evening on the mind of
[41:07] Christ. And we're taking a third portion
[41:09] on this, but I want to start lifting our
[41:11] eyes. I've done some hard preaching and
[41:13] it doesn't I still reserve the right to
[41:14] preach hard. Amen. That's the Holy
[41:17] Spirit's right. I believe is to preach
[41:18] hard. Amen. But I and the thing that's
[41:21] hard is always when it gets us right
[41:22] where we're living. You know, when we
[41:24] can't duck it and it's just poking at us
[41:25] and and that's what hard preaching is.
[41:27] Amen. But the thing is where we're
[41:29] living now and where God wants us to
[41:31] live are usually two very different
[41:32] things because God's always moving. He's
[41:34] always trying to grow us. He's always
[41:35] trying to mature us. And so I want to
[41:37] start lifting our eyes now as we start
[41:39] to come to the close of this series on
[41:41] the Holy Ghost as far as I can tell, as
[41:43] far as my notes go and these different
[41:44] things. But we've got to be able to
[41:45] preach to a higher place. Amen. Because
[41:48] I we're going to a higher place. We're
[41:50] going to a a rapturing faith. And that's
[41:52] what's being built up now. We're going
[41:53] to a a body change. We're going to see a
[41:55] resurrection. And so, we've got to
[41:57] preach in a way that lifts our faith,
[41:58] that lives our expectations above where
[42:00] we're at right now. And that's what I
[42:02] want to do by God's grace tonight. And I
[42:04] want to open with a quote just to kind
[42:06] of set a tone here because as we preach
[42:09] on these things, I'm not just here, you
[42:11] know, checking off a list. Amen. I I
[42:14] believe I'm being led by the spirit to
[42:15] do the things I'm doing, the things I'm
[42:17] preaching. And some of it's hard and
[42:18] some of it is teaching and some of it is
[42:20] is, you know, different things here. But
[42:23] but I want the Lord to have his way in
[42:25] the series that we're doing here because
[42:27] I want it to see an effect in our lives.
[42:29] Amen. I don't want us to just say,
[42:30] "Okay, I know what the Holy Ghost is. I
[42:32] know what it does." I want us to be what
[42:34] the Holy Ghost is and does. Amen. I want
[42:36] us to see it in our lives in each and
[42:38] every one. But I want to take that
[42:40] thought just quickly as I start with
[42:42] this quote. this evening because we
[42:44] preached last service on hungering and
[42:46] thirsting for righteousness. And that
[42:48] hunger and thirst is what God uses in
[42:50] our life to bring us into fulfillment of
[42:52] the word in our life. Remember before he
[42:55] sends a revival, he sends a desperation.
[42:57] He sends a call for that revival to do
[43:00] what? To stir up what's already inside
[43:01] of you so that God can now take you and
[43:04] move you into a a higher plane to take
[43:06] you down a little further down the path.
[43:08] And it takes that hunger uh and
[43:10] thirsting for righteousness. But listen
[43:12] to what the prophet says. He says, "We
[43:14] can start a meeting, work signs and
[43:17] wonders." He says, "I go out and
[43:19] sometimes in the meeting the blind see,
[43:21] the deaf here, the people come around
[43:23] and look and say, that's wonderful." And
[43:25] then he says, "But when the revival is
[43:27] gone, you don't hear of them anymore."
[43:30] He says, "They're right back out." Well,
[43:33] yes, I believe in that. But you see,
[43:36] what brought them in was not their
[43:37] belief. It was what they saw in the
[43:39] meeting.
[43:40] There's nothing in them that keeps
[43:42] bringing them back except the meeting
[43:44] itself.
[43:45] What happens there? He says, "What it
[43:47] needs tonight is not a new preacher.
[43:51] What it needs is the Holy Spirit to get
[43:53] out amongst the people. Go to stirring
[43:56] them up, hungering and thirsting for
[43:59] righteousness sake." He says, "And
[44:01] whatever it is, it takes the Holy Spirit
[44:05] to do it." Amen. So hard preaching won't
[44:08] do it. Amen. We can preach it to the
[44:10] moon and back and it won't do you a lick
[44:12] of good if the Holy Spirit isn't behind
[44:14] it. If the Holy Spirit isn't there to
[44:16] quicken it to our hearts and souls.
[44:18] Amen. Coming to church won't have a
[44:20] lasting good or impression unless the
[44:22] spirit of God is there to take that word
[44:24] and imprint it and graft it into your
[44:26] soul. Amen. It takes the spirit of God
[44:29] moving. So otherwise that effort is just
[44:31] wasted on you if it if it doesn't come
[44:34] to that place. You know, we've been
[44:35] watching a bit of the services that my
[44:37] son has attended at in the camp there
[44:40] out west and that and excellent
[44:42] ministers with excellent services and
[44:44] these things. But it struck me because
[44:46] we've all been to camps. We've all been
[44:48] around people that will profess to have
[44:50] an experience at camp and what happens
[44:52] is they walk out and two months later
[44:53] they're right back where they were
[44:54] before they went into camp. See, the
[44:57] excellent ministry, the moving of the
[44:59] spirit does no good if it doesn't
[45:00] engraft itself in your heart. If there's
[45:02] not something in there to receive it,
[45:04] because otherwise what it is is just
[45:06] everything in that moment is good.
[45:08] You're around good people, you're around
[45:09] believers, the atmosphere is right, the
[45:11] music is right, the ministry is right,
[45:13] the message is right, everything's
[45:14] exciting, everything is go, go, go, go,
[45:16] go. But the minute we walk out of that
[45:18] service, the minute we walk out of that
[45:20] camp and it's all done, we've got to go
[45:21] back to real life. And in real life, we
[45:24] don't get to go to church twice a day.
[45:26] We don't get to only live our life
[45:27] around believers. We don't have to turn
[45:29] off our phones because we're in the US
[45:30] and we'll run up a huge bill if we turn
[45:32] them on. And so we have no distractions
[45:34] there. But then we come back to real
[45:36] life and now we're really in the battle.
[45:38] Now we're really in the battle. And
[45:39] we've got to have something that anchors
[45:41] in our souls. And the only thing that
[45:43] it'll work, church, is the word of God
[45:45] quickened by the Holy Spirit. It's the
[45:47] only thing that'll work. Amen. You know,
[45:49] if I was to be honest, I'd say over the
[45:51] last 10 years, I've heard a lot of
[45:52] preaching. I've done a lot of preaching.
[45:56] And we can preach on possession and we
[45:58] can preach on victory. And we can preach
[45:59] on overcoming and the bride's position
[46:02] and adoption. But what I'm not hearing
[46:04] so much these days is character, is
[46:07] humility, is patience, is waiting on
[46:10] God. The constant daytoday commitment of
[46:14] a true believer. Everyone's preaching
[46:17] where we're at, but there's no checklist
[46:18] to say, are you what we're talking
[46:20] about? We're preaching it as if we're
[46:22] all there. But I'll tell you what, we
[46:24] can we can we can preach without a
[46:26] challenge and it leaves the people
[46:27] thinking that they're good the way they
[46:29] are.
[46:31] And that is just a form of preaching to
[46:34] people with itching ears. If we don't
[46:36] challenge it, the ministry doesn't
[46:38] challenge you, we've missed something
[46:41] because the word is supposed to
[46:42] challenge us to step higher, to take
[46:45] another step in faith, to move closer to
[46:47] Christ and further away from the world.
[46:50] Amen. But that's a lot less popular.
[46:53] But you know, we preach about being like
[46:55] a a hero of the faith. Look at David.
[46:58] You say, "Well, we're all like David."
[47:00] But here's the thing. Are we prayed up
[47:01] like David was prayed up? Are we
[47:03] anointed like David was anointed? Are we
[47:06] faithful like David was faithful?
[47:08] Because if we're not, guess what,
[47:10] church? We don't get David's results.
[47:13] We've got to preach the whole David. Not
[47:15] just the David and Goliath. Not just the
[47:17] David being crowned king, but we've got
[47:19] to preach the whole process of character
[47:21] and trial and testing and staying with
[47:24] the word and not reviling back and
[47:26] watching your attitude and watching your
[47:28] tongue and holding fast and letting God
[47:30] lead you into it rather than trying to
[47:32] take it by your own hands. We've got to
[47:34] preach the entire word. Paul says, "I've
[47:35] not shun to declare you the full counsel
[47:37] of God." We've got to preach a rounded
[47:40] gospel. Not just the victory, but we've
[47:42] got to preach the humbling that comes
[47:43] before it. Amen. We got to preach the
[47:45] development work that goes into it. But
[47:47] I'm here tonight to hopefully by God's
[47:49] grace raise our our eyes. Amen. To
[47:51] quicken all of us. I'm here to catch my
[47:53] own message this evening. I don't want
[47:55] it just for you, but I want it for me. I
[47:56] want him to take me to a higher level
[47:58] this evening. And so if we go back to
[48:00] our first scripture that we open with
[48:02] Paul or Peter would say, for that for as
[48:04] much then as Christ has suffered for us
[48:06] in the flesh, arm yourselves likewise
[48:09] with the same mind. As we read last
[48:11] service, think like Christ thought. Let
[48:13] the mind that was in Christ be in you.
[48:16] And here's the mindset. For he that has
[48:18] suffered in the flesh has ceased from
[48:21] sin that he may no longer that that he
[48:24] no longer should live the rest of his
[48:26] time in the flesh to the lust of men but
[48:28] to the will of God. The scripture says
[48:30] that if we would rule with him, we must
[48:33] suffer with him. If we're going to reign
[48:35] with him, we've got to suffer with him.
[48:37] And we suffer through the same
[48:38] conditions that he suffered through. He
[48:40] was rejected. He was despised. He was
[48:43] misunderstood.
[48:44] Isn't that the thing we get all the
[48:46] time? Misunderstood.
[48:48] That's what we see so many times. Amen.
[48:50] We're lied about. We're falsely accused.
[48:52] And it's because he wasn't walking to
[48:54] the drum beats of the religion of that
[48:56] day. And neither are we. He was walking
[48:59] according to the word. He was in perfect
[49:01] harmony with the word. And that put him
[49:03] at odds with just about everyone and
[49:05] everything. You look at Jesus life once
[49:08] he was baptized by the spirit and he
[49:10] came out into the public. We would say
[49:12] that he became a lightning rod for
[49:14] controversy.
[49:16] Very few people agreed with the word
[49:20] especially when it was in flesh. Some of
[49:24] them could acknowledge that his words
[49:25] were true but the manifestation tripped
[49:27] them up so many times. Is that really
[49:29] what we've been looking for? Is that
[49:31] really what we've been talking about? Is
[49:32] that what we've been praying about for
[49:34] so long? So it's no wonder then. And
[49:35] it's small wonder that we would run into
[49:37] the same obstacles where we're
[49:39] misunderstood, where we're despised,
[49:40] where people look down on us, when
[49:42] people call us a cult, whatever it might
[49:44] be. And I say, you know, I would say
[49:47] even within the confines of
[49:48] Christianity, but I would say it's more
[49:50] like especially within the confines of
[49:51] Christianity because what we have and
[49:53] what we believe is heresy.
[49:56] That's what Paul believed was heresy and
[49:57] we believe Paul's message. Amen. And so
[50:00] we have to see one critical thing that
[50:02] if we've got the mind that Peter's
[50:04] talking about that Paul talked about, it
[50:07] is going to be contrary to everything
[50:10] else that this world has to offer. It's
[50:12] not going to line up with anything.
[50:14] Brother Brandham says it so simply. He
[50:16] says, "I want the mind of Christ. That's
[50:18] what I want." Do we want the mind of
[50:21] Christ this evening? Then get ready for
[50:23] this. He says, "And it's very always
[50:27] contrary to the world." If we find
[50:31] ourselves, church, nodding our head in
[50:33] agreement with with the podcasts and the
[50:35] commentators and the pundits and these
[50:38] different things, let me say tonight
[50:40] that is not the mind of Christ. We can
[50:42] look at this world and we can look at
[50:44] people analyzing this world and pointing
[50:46] out the hypocrisies and the fallacies
[50:48] and the silliness of it all and we can
[50:50] agree with it. But let me tell you, that
[50:52] is not the mind of Christ. That is still
[50:55] the mind of the world. The fact that
[50:58] they can see it as insane does not mean
[50:59] it get the mind of Christ. It just means
[51:01] that they've got a bit of logic left in
[51:03] their brain.
[51:05] Amen. They don't have the mind of
[51:06] Christ. And I'll tell you what, Satan
[51:08] would love to get us tied into people
[51:10] that can see elements of truth in what's
[51:12] going on in this world.
[51:15] He would love it if we would spend our
[51:17] days listening to Ben Shapiro and and
[51:19] Jordan Peterson and Matt Walsh and Joe
[51:22] Rogan and people that call things out
[51:24] the way they see it. Pick your female
[51:26] commentators and podcasters. I don't
[51:28] know them. I don't listen to them. I
[51:30] don't listen to them in in general.
[51:31] Amen. But there are people that are
[51:33] trying to fix our country and fix our
[51:35] families and take our schools back and
[51:37] take this back and throw this out and do
[51:39] all these things. And the thing they
[51:41] don't know, church, is that it's already
[51:43] too late. And so they're working to fix
[51:46] what we know is already too far gone.
[51:48] The prophet of God said the the log the
[51:51] the the the tree is on the skids. The
[51:53] logs on the skids and it's not coming
[51:54] back. The skids are those those those um
[51:57] bars that come off the side of a of a a
[52:00] logging trailer and they tip the big
[52:02] trees over onto it and then they let it
[52:03] roll down by itself. And nobody stood in
[52:06] front of that tree when it was rolling
[52:07] down the skids because it weighs a
[52:08] couple of tons. it to kill you. It would
[52:10] have crushed you. He says, "America's on
[52:12] the skids and she's not coming back."
[52:14] And guess what? Canada's in the same
[52:16] boat. The whole world is in the same
[52:17] boat. Amen. So, they aren't going to
[52:20] give us discernment. They're not going
[52:21] to give us truth. They're not going to
[52:23] give us direction. Cuz what are they
[52:25] doing, church? All they end up doing is
[52:26] they say, "Look at me. Listen to me.
[52:29] Take what I'm saying." And all they end
[52:31] up doing is pointing you to themselves
[52:33] rather than to the word, rather than to
[52:34] the truth. I have found for myself
[52:36] whenever I listen to those people, all
[52:39] it does is get me riled up about things
[52:41] I already know according to a prophet.
[52:45] Somebody was sharing something or the
[52:47] other day and I said, and we already
[52:49] knew that 50 years ago. I think it was
[52:50] my wife shared something with me. I'm
[52:52] like, science is finally catching up to
[52:53] the message. Things Brother Bram said in
[52:55] the 50s, 70 plus years ago, and science
[52:59] is finally starting to realize it was
[53:01] true. Isn't that amazing? But you know
[53:03] what? We'll get caught up in that and
[53:06] all it does is distracts us from what
[53:08] we're supposed to be focused on. Amen.
[53:10] Getting out of here. You know, Jesus
[53:12] didn't get caught up in it. They came to
[53:15] Jesus. They said, "Jesus, they won't pay
[53:17] us a living wage." He said, "Be content
[53:20] with your wages."
[53:23] They said, "Jesus, when are you going to
[53:25] set us free from the Romans?" Jesus, the
[53:27] Romans are taxing us too much. He said,
[53:29] "Render to Caesar what belongs to
[53:30] Caesar. Render to God what belongs to
[53:32] God." He didn't get caught up in what
[53:34] are you going to set us free. He says,
[53:35] "My kingdom is not of this world."
[53:38] And he kept walking on. He had his own
[53:41] message. He had his own gospel. Paul
[53:42] come behind him. And Paul didn't set the
[53:45] slaves free. He said, "Serve your
[53:47] masters as you serve God."
[53:51] What? He's not getting caught up in the
[53:53] issues of the day because he's got a
[53:55] word that's taking him beyond that. And
[53:57] today we're under an eagle anointing
[53:59] that's supposed to take us above it
[54:01] rather than scrapping it out down on
[54:02] this earth. Amen. We look a higher
[54:04] plane. We look beyond what we see today.
[54:07] We look beyond flesh and blood. We're
[54:09] looking to the eternal. We're looking to
[54:10] get out of here. We're pilgrims and
[54:12] strangers. We're not getting involved in
[54:14] those sorts of things. Amen. I would
[54:17] hate to find today that we're listening
[54:18] more to these podcasts and commentators
[54:20] than listening to a rapturing message.
[54:23] Absolutely I would. Amen.
[54:26] But we ought to focus on the word. You
[54:28] know why? Because the word focuses right
[54:30] here. Because what happens is if Satan
[54:33] can get us caught up and what everyone
[54:35] else is doing wrong, then what happens?
[54:38] We exclude ourselves from correction cuz
[54:40] I'm not like them. I see things they
[54:42] don't see. I don't do the craziness that
[54:43] they do. I don't buy into their agendas.
[54:45] I don't support this. I don't do that.
[54:47] And what does it do? It makes us feel
[54:48] good where we're at. rather than
[54:50] bringing us to the word which shapes us
[54:52] and which changes us and which corrects
[54:54] us and draws us closer to Christ. See,
[54:57] we can get caught up in being better
[54:59] than everyone else that we forget the
[55:00] goal is not to be better. The goal is to
[55:01] get out of here. The goal is to get out
[55:04] of here. Amen. Anything that keeps us
[55:06] from sitting under the correction and
[55:07] the direction of the word is just a trap
[55:09] for our attention. And Satan would love
[55:11] to get us trapped in those sorts of
[55:13] things.
[55:14] Amen. Problem is, those kinds of people
[55:17] are right in their own eyes, but they're
[55:19] still not subject to the Holy Spirit.
[55:21] Everyone's a Republican or a Democrat or
[55:24] a liberal or a conservative or a
[55:26] centrist or a leftist or a rightist
[55:27] church. It's all Satan's Eden. It's all
[55:30] Satan's Eden. And guess what? If you put
[55:32] the right in, then they'll go wrong just
[55:33] as much as the left will go wrong. Just
[55:35] in a different direction, but it's still
[55:37] all evil. It's still all Satan. It's
[55:38] still all wrong. They might have
[55:40] elements that are good, but they don't
[55:42] have the word. And they definitely don't
[55:44] have the spirit. Amen.
[55:47] They're commentators rather than
[55:49] examples.
[55:51] And I'm looking for examples. Amen. The
[55:53] mind of Christ, the prophet of God says
[55:55] it's very, it's always contrary to the
[55:59] world. Every political party, every
[56:01] affiliation, it's completely outside the
[56:03] word of God. We are Christians. We have
[56:07] no political affiliation. There's
[56:09] nothing in it for us. Brother Brown
[56:11] would say this. He says God is infinite
[56:13] and when he speaks it's got to be
[56:15] perfect. He cannot change. He says we
[56:17] cannot alter God's word. We have to we
[56:21] have to alter our thinking to his
[56:24] thinking. He says let the mind of Christ
[56:26] be in you. Then you'll know then you'll
[56:29] think like he thinks. Now we know this
[56:31] by now. We ought to know this by now.
[56:33] How do we know the mind of Christ?
[56:35] Always by the word. It's always by the
[56:37] word. Amen. That's our security. It's
[56:39] our assurance. It's our confirmation.
[56:41] And as we feel led by the spirit day by
[56:44] day, we always check it with the word.
[56:46] That's our our day-to-day assurance is
[56:48] that our life, our decisions, it all
[56:50] lines up with the word. And we have seen
[56:52] in the last two services especially that
[56:54] that mindset brings two things. It
[56:56] brings servitude and it brings
[56:57] surrender.
[56:59] It's a people that serve their God and
[57:01] it's a people that are surrendered to
[57:03] their God. Amen. And when we get to that
[57:06] point, that's when God can really stop
[57:08] can really start doing something with
[57:09] us. Brother Bram says, "And we've got to
[57:11] let God's thinking be our thinking." He
[57:13] says, "Let the mind that was in Christ
[57:15] be in you." He says, "And this Bible
[57:18] reveals the mind of Christ." Well, do we
[57:21] have the mind of Christ? If we have the
[57:23] mind of Christ, it means we've got to
[57:24] have the word for our day. That's the
[57:26] absolute requirement. Amen. The word for
[57:29] yesterday is true.
[57:31] It's just not fresh. It's just not
[57:34] fresh. Amen. Listen, we still have to be
[57:36] justified.
[57:38] We still have to be justified, but we've
[57:40] moved on from justification. You got to
[57:42] have it, but you can't stop there. Two
[57:44] church ages ago, you could stop there.
[57:47] But then sanctification came along and
[57:50] everyone that stayed with Luther, now
[57:53] they're lost because they didn't move
[57:55] on. So then they went into Wesley and
[57:58] sanctification. And all of a sudden,
[58:00] that's where the spirit's moving. But
[58:02] guess what? Then at Isuza Street, they
[58:04] went from sanctification to gifts, a
[58:06] pouring out of the Holy Spirit. And if
[58:08] you stayed in sanctification from that
[58:10] point on, you're lost because you didn't
[58:12] move as God moved. And what are we
[58:14] coming into today? See, we can listen to
[58:17] those things. We can hear those things.
[58:19] There are wonderful preachers out there
[58:20] that aren't in this message can do a a
[58:22] bangup job of preaching justification. I
[58:25] know I've said it before. I remember
[58:26] back in Edmonton, this guy that that
[58:28] that went to our church and and he he
[58:31] was talking to one of the deacons and
[58:32] and he said, "What have you been
[58:33] listening to these days and he says,
[58:34] "Oh, I've been listening to this this
[58:36] preacher so and so." And he started
[58:38] expounding on justification.
[58:40] And he says, "I've never heard that in
[58:42] my life." One, that's a shame
[58:45] because we've got to preach it. It's the
[58:48] first work of grace. But he was
[58:49] listening to a nominal Christian
[58:51] preacher that was doing a wonderful job
[58:53] of it. But that man ended up leaving the
[58:55] message because justification appealed
[58:57] to him more than what the message
[58:59] offered
[59:01] because he had a conscience that
[59:02] bothered him so often. And that's what
[59:04] led that that that's what drew him in.
[59:06] But he could only get to justification.
[59:09] He couldn't move into sanctification. So
[59:10] he went backwards from there.
[59:13] It's not it's not that it's not truth.
[59:15] It's just not the whole truth. We've got
[59:17] to be able to move beyond those things.
[59:19] Amen. And what are we moving now in now?
[59:22] We're moving into a divine marriage.
[59:24] We're moving into unity with Christ. I
[59:25] thought it was so fitting, brother Joe,
[59:27] finishing with that song that we did,
[59:28] the bride and Christ are one. Uniting
[59:30] time has come. We're in uniting time.
[59:32] We're in marriage time. We're in the
[59:33] invisible union of the heavenly
[59:35] bridegroom and the earthly bride. That's
[59:37] what we're in now. That's what the word
[59:38] is doing is joining us to Christ.
[59:41] I It's something that's bringing us into
[59:43] a unity that has not been here since the
[59:45] first church age. That's what we're
[59:47] getting into. That's what we're in.
[59:48] Amen. We've got to keep moving as God is
[59:51] moving. And let me say, God's moving.
[59:53] This message has not stood still since
[59:55] the prophet left. Absolutely, it has
[59:57] not. I believe we can look around this
[59:59] church and we can see the changes that
[1:00:01] have happened in our understanding, in
[1:00:03] our revelation, in the impact it's had
[1:00:04] on our life. God is still moving. The
[1:00:06] spirit of God is still here to draw us
[1:00:08] into the reality of the words uh this
[1:00:10] word. Amen. But it's not just for the
[1:00:12] sake of knowledge, but it's for sake of
[1:00:14] a revelation that brings us into the
[1:00:16] reality of what we've heard. That's what
[1:00:18] the spirit's here to do. Amen. But what
[1:00:20] we have is still maturing. We're still
[1:00:22] growing in Christ. This is just me. But
[1:00:24] I say we don't have everything that we
[1:00:26] are that we It belongs to us. Every
[1:00:28] promise in the book belongs to you and
[1:00:30] I, church. But I don't believe we have
[1:00:31] it all.
[1:00:33] As in, I don't believe we have the
[1:00:34] reality of it all. Why? We're probably
[1:00:38] not ready for it all just yet because
[1:00:40] we're growing and we're maturing day by
[1:00:43] day by God's grace. Amen. But God has a
[1:00:45] time and God has a season for it. And
[1:00:47] before this is all said and done, we're
[1:00:49] going to have everything that he
[1:00:50] promised. We're going to be everything
[1:00:52] that he promised. Amen. We're going to
[1:00:54] be that bride without spot and wrinkle
[1:00:56] that is perfectly united with her head.
[1:00:58] Amen. We're in the adoption season.
[1:01:00] We're in the time of placing under
[1:01:02] authority. Amen. I believe that's here
[1:01:03] now. But we're growing into a higher
[1:01:05] plane in our Christian walk every single
[1:01:07] day. And it's just a little bit here and
[1:01:10] a little bit there and a little bit here
[1:01:11] and a little bit there. And that's the
[1:01:13] patient bride that we're talking about.
[1:01:15] That's a bride that's seen those little
[1:01:16] things happen day by day. Listen, our
[1:01:19] prophet came to a place of adoption,
[1:01:21] didn't he? Absolutely he did. But you
[1:01:24] notice when it comes to adoption, God's
[1:01:26] not just allowing him to be a part. God
[1:01:30] invited him to be a part. God invited
[1:01:33] him. He says, "Hey, would you want to do
[1:01:36] this? I'm going to let you do this."
[1:01:40] It's not just allowing. He's inviting
[1:01:41] them in. Remember what happened? Now,
[1:01:44] it's interesting when you look at people
[1:01:46] that God said you can have whatever you
[1:01:48] want.
[1:01:49] They always made the right decision. You
[1:01:52] know why, church? Cuz they were at the
[1:01:54] place of their Christian walk where he
[1:01:55] knew they would make the right decision.
[1:01:58] And that's why he invites them in. He
[1:02:00] gives them a choice, but he knows their
[1:02:02] choice is his choice. He knows their
[1:02:04] will is his will. And so, what do we
[1:02:06] see? We see Haddie right there, poor as
[1:02:08] a church mouse. She has nothing to her
[1:02:10] name. She's had a a family member, I
[1:02:13] believe, that was very sick if I'm not
[1:02:14] mistaken. But what does she do? She
[1:02:17] doesn't. And remember, brother Rab said,
[1:02:18] he says, "You can ask for a million
[1:02:20] dollars and it will appear on this table
[1:02:21] right now. You can ask for the healing
[1:02:24] of so- and so." And she says, "I want
[1:02:26] the salvation of my two boys."
[1:02:30] Brother Brandon, remember, he he's he's
[1:02:32] standing there, his wife is about to go
[1:02:34] into the surgery, and the spirit of God
[1:02:36] says, "Whatever you say will happen."
[1:02:40] whatever you say will happen. And what
[1:02:41] does he do? He offers her mercy and
[1:02:43] grace and that tumor disappeared before
[1:02:45] the knife even touched her body. Why?
[1:02:48] God knew that they had the character to
[1:02:51] make the decision that he wanted them to
[1:02:53] make. Brother Brown would say this.
[1:02:57] He says, "God's looking for character
[1:02:59] from men and women who can conduct
[1:03:02] themselves as sons and daughters of the
[1:03:04] king." He says, "God have mercy on us
[1:03:06] that we will do it." God gives that
[1:03:08] authority to people he knows has
[1:03:10] character to do it. You'll never see
[1:03:12] Brother Brandon walking around with a
[1:03:13] puffed up chest, strutting around, I'm
[1:03:15] the prophet of God. I'm the messenger of
[1:03:17] the age. I'm the seventh angel. I have
[1:03:19] all authority. No, he never did that.
[1:03:21] You couldn't find a humbler man. You
[1:03:23] couldn't find a humbler man. My wife was
[1:03:25] telling me she was listening to a
[1:03:26] service and and the brother got up
[1:03:28] before brother Brandham and he he did
[1:03:30] this big glowing resume of everything
[1:03:32] that Brother Brandham was and had and
[1:03:34] all these different things. And brother
[1:03:35] Bram said, "Boy, I just hope I can live
[1:03:37] up to what he said." Right? Didn't walk
[1:03:40] up and say, "Thank you, brother. God's
[1:03:42] been so good to me." Yes. Amen. He said,
[1:03:44] "It would be an amazing thing if I could
[1:03:45] live up to what that man said about me."
[1:03:48] Humble. That's what always struck people
[1:03:50] about the prophet of God was he didn't
[1:03:53] walk up with a swagger. He didn't walk
[1:03:55] up as if he was some some some special
[1:03:58] person. He walked up in the humility of
[1:04:01] knowing who he was.
[1:04:04] He didn't need anybody to acknowledge
[1:04:05] him. He didn't need anybody to recognize
[1:04:07] him. He was there because God had told
[1:04:09] him to be there. Amen. Notice he says
[1:04:12] God's looking for character for men and
[1:04:15] women who can conduct themselves. What?
[1:04:18] Live by the word. So that when you walk
[1:04:21] out of these doors of the church, you go
[1:04:22] to your work, you live the same way. You
[1:04:24] walk the same way. You talk the same
[1:04:26] way. When you go to the gym, nothing
[1:04:27] changes. When you go down to to an
[1:04:30] event, when you go to the mall, when
[1:04:31] you're with certain people, your life
[1:04:33] doesn't change. You conduct yourself as
[1:04:35] a child of the king. No matter where you
[1:04:36] go, there's no variableness nor shadow
[1:04:38] of turning in your life. The same as
[1:04:40] there is with God's. Amen.
[1:04:44] Remember what adoption is? What's the
[1:04:46] what's the tutor's report when that that
[1:04:49] child is ready for adoption? They act
[1:04:52] like you. They talk like you. They think
[1:04:55] like you. They are you. And no matter
[1:04:58] what how much you squeeze them, no
[1:04:59] matter how much pressure you put on
[1:05:00] them, you know, no matter how tight, no
[1:05:03] matter the social pressure, the peer
[1:05:04] pressure, whatever it is, no matter what
[1:05:06] they do, they act just like you do. And
[1:05:08] he says, "All right, let's have a
[1:05:09] ceremony."
[1:05:11] Now, that's going to bring a reproach.
[1:05:13] It brings a reproach when we won't go
[1:05:15] along with what everyone wants us to do.
[1:05:17] It brings a reproach when we say,
[1:05:19] "Sorry, that's not quite the truth."
[1:05:22] That brings a reproach when we refuse to
[1:05:25] back down
[1:05:27] because we're accused of not being
[1:05:28] loving, of not being accepting, of not
[1:05:30] being of not showing equality,
[1:05:33] all of these different things. That's
[1:05:36] why Peter said, "Arm yourselves.
[1:05:38] Arm yourselves with this mindset." He
[1:05:41] says, "The flesh is going to suffer
[1:05:43] under the mindset of Christ." Amen.
[1:05:45] That's the way because your your your
[1:05:47] your flesh is going to be put down for
[1:05:49] the sake of the higher calling that's in
[1:05:51] your life. And it's through the mind of
[1:05:52] Christ. Amen. Peter's saying, "Get
[1:05:55] ready. This is going to hurt." You said,
[1:05:57] "Brother John, we're going to I thought
[1:05:58] you said you're going to raise our our
[1:05:59] sights." We're getting there. But
[1:06:01] Peter's saying, "Get ready because this
[1:06:02] is going to hurt the flesh." The flesh.
[1:06:05] Amen. This flesh does not and is not
[1:06:07] going to enjoy what happens when the
[1:06:09] mind of Christ is in operation in our
[1:06:11] life. It's a rough road. Amen. You know,
[1:06:13] in the old days, we don't arm ourselves
[1:06:15] the same way anymore. But in the old
[1:06:16] days, see, you didn't just strap on a
[1:06:18] weapon. First, you had to put on all
[1:06:20] your armor and you had to put it on in
[1:06:21] the correct order and in the correct
[1:06:23] place. And you had stuff for the right
[1:06:24] side, stuff for the left side, and it
[1:06:27] had to go on in a certain order. And
[1:06:28] then when all that was on, then you
[1:06:29] would strap your weapon on, you take
[1:06:31] your shield, and off you would go. And
[1:06:32] you had to do it very carefully because
[1:06:34] if you didn't, your life was forfeit.
[1:06:37] Cuz here's the thing. When you went into
[1:06:38] those battles,
[1:06:40] especially look at the medieval ages
[1:06:41] when there was so much armor and that,
[1:06:43] when you went out, people half the time
[1:06:45] weren't dying because you hit them with
[1:06:46] a sword. They died because their armor
[1:06:48] didn't fit them right and you found a
[1:06:50] gap. You couldn't put a sword through a
[1:06:53] piece of a polished armor that had no no
[1:06:56] flat surfaces on it. You could take a
[1:06:57] sword and try and ram it right through
[1:06:58] them and it would just glance off. You
[1:07:00] had to beat them down into the ground
[1:07:03] and basically stomp them and suffocate
[1:07:05] them or you had to find a weak point in
[1:07:06] the armor. And Peter's saying, "Listen,
[1:07:09] you got to arm yourself. You got to know
[1:07:11] this is going to hurt, but you're not
[1:07:13] going to die from it."
[1:07:15] And we all said, "Praise the Lord
[1:07:16] tonight. This is going to hurt. It's
[1:07:19] going to hurt." Amen. You have to be
[1:07:21] deliberate about these things. That's
[1:07:22] what Peter's saying. He's saying,
[1:07:23] "Listen, prepare yourself for what's
[1:07:26] coming. Prepare yourself for what's
[1:07:28] coming because look at what Christ dealt
[1:07:30] with and then figure that you're going
[1:07:31] to deal with the same thing." Now, we're
[1:07:33] not going to be crucified in the flesh,
[1:07:34] but the flesh is going to be crucified.
[1:07:36] That's what Paul said. And that's a
[1:07:38] daily thing. That's a daily painful
[1:07:41] reminder of who we are as the flesh gets
[1:07:43] crucified every single day because the
[1:07:46] spirit the the mind of Christ it takes
[1:07:48] the flesh and it stomps the living
[1:07:50] daylights out of it. It is not
[1:07:52] comfortable for this body. Amen. It it
[1:07:54] it annihilates it takes it completely
[1:07:55] out of the picture. It keeps it under
[1:07:57] control because remember what he says
[1:07:59] that no longer we should live to the
[1:08:01] time rest of his time in the flesh to
[1:08:03] the lust of men but to the will of God.
[1:08:06] In other words, the flesh is going to
[1:08:07] starve.
[1:08:09] It's going to starve. Now, I don't know
[1:08:11] if anybody's ever starved before
[1:08:14] unintentionally, for sure. That's one of
[1:08:16] the hard things. If it's intentional, if
[1:08:18] you're trying to lose weight, if you're
[1:08:19] fasting, something like that, maybe not
[1:08:21] so much. But do you ever go out sometime
[1:08:23] and you got caught and you didn't bring
[1:08:24] a snack, you didn't bring any food, and
[1:08:26] you couldn't go get anything? I've done
[1:08:28] that before. usually out in the country
[1:08:30] somewhere and you think you're going to
[1:08:32] be back in two or three hours and it
[1:08:33] ends up being 11 hours and you have no
[1:08:36] food with you and you come back and you
[1:08:38] would you would you would eat an animal
[1:08:40] raw. I remember one time when uh it was
[1:08:43] in the in the fall and we were over on
[1:08:45] Empire Avenue there at the church and
[1:08:47] you remember you'd go and clean up all
[1:08:48] those leaves. Well, I was work I was uh
[1:08:51] working at Tom and Tom and uh Gerinda's
[1:08:54] house cleaning off their their um
[1:08:57] siding. They had that wood siding and
[1:08:59] you had to hand scrape the whole thing
[1:09:00] before you could repaint it. And that
[1:09:02] was my job. So I didn't go to help with
[1:09:04] the uh with the um with with the the
[1:09:07] leaves pickup there that the brothers
[1:09:08] were doing with the kids. But afterwards
[1:09:10] they went and they got pizza and they
[1:09:13] came over to me and they dropped off a
[1:09:14] personal pantsized pizza from from Pizza
[1:09:18] Hut. Now I love Pizza Hut pizza. But
[1:09:19] when I opened it up, church, my heart
[1:09:21] sank because it had mushrooms
[1:09:25] and it had peppers.
[1:09:29] Oh, it had meat and cheese. But like
[1:09:31] those are things I would typically turn
[1:09:33] my nose up. But I was so hungry, church.
[1:09:35] I ate the whole thing and enjoyed it
[1:09:38] thoroughly.
[1:09:39] Why? Because I was starving.
[1:09:42] I was willing to put up with the disgust
[1:09:44] of I can barely say it, mushrooms
[1:09:49] because I was so hungry. The flesh was
[1:09:51] starving.
[1:09:54] And yet, that's what Peter's saying. Get
[1:09:56] ready. The flesh has to starve. Paul
[1:09:58] said, "Your flesh has to be crucified
[1:10:01] daily." And that can be hard. That can
[1:10:03] be hard because we look around and we
[1:10:04] see people that spend on everything and
[1:10:06] they they've got everything and they've
[1:10:08] got there's no end to what people will
[1:10:11] spend money on these days. Now, of
[1:10:13] course, we don't see the other side
[1:10:14] which how much debt they're probably in
[1:10:16] as well, but people will pamper
[1:10:17] themselves and they're pander to their
[1:10:19] their wants and these things and people
[1:10:20] just seem to have and have and consume
[1:10:22] and consume. And we're sitting here in
[1:10:24] moderation,
[1:10:26] but it's moderation by the word. in
[1:10:28] moderation by the word looks like
[1:10:29] starvation to the rest of the world when
[1:10:31] it comes to this flesh. And we can sit
[1:10:33] there and we can have a bit of a pity
[1:10:35] party. Why do they have everything and I
[1:10:36] don't? Well, it's because of this. We
[1:10:39] live by the mind of Christ, not
[1:10:41] according to the lusts of men, the lust
[1:10:43] of the eyes, lust of the stomach, the
[1:10:47] lust of the garage,
[1:10:49] whatever it might be, the lust of the
[1:10:51] cheese, the fine cheeses. Brother
[1:10:54] Vichel,
[1:10:55] we don't live that way. We're under a
[1:10:57] different mindset and it causes this
[1:10:59] flesh to starve
[1:11:02] church. We ought which ought to make it
[1:11:04] weak. Which means that as we go, it
[1:11:06] ought to get a little easier to deal
[1:11:09] without these different things. But
[1:11:10] that's where we live with the mind of
[1:11:12] Christ. You look at Christ physically
[1:11:13] speaking, he had nothing. He didn't have
[1:11:15] a home. He didn't have a bed.
[1:11:18] He didn't have a steady source of
[1:11:19] income. He had no security.
[1:11:23] The clothing he had was a gift to him.
[1:11:25] Now, I'm not saying we have to live that
[1:11:27] way and you're wrong to have your bed or
[1:11:29] your house or your steady income or
[1:11:30] these things. Amen. But rather, the life
[1:11:32] of the committ of a believer is not one
[1:11:34] of daily comfort or security.
[1:11:37] It is a life, church, not of comfort. It
[1:11:39] is a life where we are comforted.
[1:11:41] And there's a big difference in that.
[1:11:43] Amen. That we're comforted because we're
[1:11:45] seeking a city whose builder and maker
[1:11:47] is God. Amen. That our reward is beyond
[1:11:50] what we have here. Amen. And that in the
[1:11:52] in the meantime, there's a contentment
[1:11:54] that comes with just walking this good
[1:11:57] old way. Amen. With doing what the word
[1:12:00] tells us to do.
[1:12:02] But we're going to step it up a notch
[1:12:04] here. Now, that's the hard part. Now,
[1:12:07] we're going to lift our eyes a little
[1:12:08] bit. Amen. because I preached that
[1:12:10] hardship. But I want to take us now into
[1:12:11] the joy into the privilege into the
[1:12:13] opportunity that we have to get us to
[1:12:15] lift up our heads a little bit because
[1:12:17] brother Ram would say now it's the mind
[1:12:19] of Christ that the human being has the
[1:12:22] privilege to enter in and know the mind
[1:12:25] of Christ. Then he says hallelujah. He
[1:12:28] says my what a reality to dwell in the
[1:12:32] channel of Christ.
[1:12:35] You hear a lot about privilege these
[1:12:37] days.
[1:12:38] We've got privilege this evening. We've
[1:12:41] got privilege that nobody else has.
[1:12:43] Amen. What is this privilege, church?
[1:12:45] It's a privilege to get with the
[1:12:46] program. It's a privilege to be used.
[1:12:49] It's a privilege to see the reality of
[1:12:51] God. It's a real It's the the privilege
[1:12:53] of being a channel for the Holy Spirit
[1:12:55] to see the word of God becoming a
[1:12:57] reality in your life today. That's the
[1:13:00] privilege that we have. Listen to this
[1:13:02] now. Brother Ram says, "As I've said,
[1:13:04] faith doesn't come by fasting. Faith
[1:13:07] doesn't come by praying, reading a book.
[1:13:10] He said, "All of that's good, fasting,
[1:13:11] praying, and reading a book." He says,
[1:13:13] "But faith comes by a settled something
[1:13:16] that's in the human heart." He says,
[1:13:19] "Now listen to this. I'm I'm leading to
[1:13:21] a point here. It doesn't seem connected,
[1:13:22] but it is." He says, "Now when you come
[1:13:25] home, you told your wife you'd be home
[1:13:27] after the service was over." He says,
[1:13:28] "You do that unconsciously.
[1:13:31] You just go out and get in your car and
[1:13:33] go on home. Now, you could not do it
[1:13:35] unless you had faith you could do it.
[1:13:37] You would never move from where you're
[1:13:39] sitting if you didn't have faith you
[1:13:41] could raise up. He says, "But you've
[1:13:43] done it so much and you've just become
[1:13:45] so accustomed to those laws till it's a
[1:13:49] natural thing." Now, remember, we're
[1:13:50] speaking on the mind of Christ. We're
[1:13:52] speaking on being a channel for Christ.
[1:13:54] But he's taken us into the day-to-day
[1:13:56] before he takes us into the spiritual.
[1:13:59] He's trying to say, listen, the way to
[1:14:01] get here is to do the same thing that
[1:14:03] you do in your natural life. He says,
[1:14:06] you say you're going to go home. He
[1:14:07] says, after church, what do you do when
[1:14:09] church is over? You get up, you walk
[1:14:10] out, you start your car, you drive home,
[1:14:12] you come home. Why? He says, because
[1:14:13] you've got faith you can do it.
[1:14:17] You've got faith that you can do it. But
[1:14:19] watch what he says now. Now he flips it
[1:14:21] and he takes the natural and he throws
[1:14:23] it into the spiritual. He says, "Now, if
[1:14:25] we could throw ourselves completely to
[1:14:28] God and to his will,
[1:14:32] and he says, be lost to our own thoughts
[1:14:35] and just let the mind of Christ be in
[1:14:37] us, those same operations of the spirit
[1:14:40] would work through us just as the
[1:14:42] natural things do, just the same thing."
[1:14:45] because we were first created for that
[1:14:48] purpose to control, to rule, and to
[1:14:51] praise God, and to live for God. He's
[1:14:54] saying, "How do we get here?" He says,
[1:14:55] "Do what you do in the natural. Just
[1:14:57] take it into the spiritual." Because in
[1:14:59] the natural, we do something so much,
[1:15:02] and so often we become so accustomed to
[1:15:04] it, it becomes a natural thing. He says,
[1:15:06] "Now take that to the word." He says,
[1:15:08] "Get into the word. Get into the word
[1:15:10] until you become so accustomed to the
[1:15:12] word that it becomes natural. It becomes
[1:15:15] nature for you to do it. That's what
[1:15:18] he's talking about. We become so
[1:15:20] familiar with the word that anything
[1:15:23] that's off the word, we notice it and we
[1:15:25] go, "Hey, hey, did you see that? Did you
[1:15:28] see that? That ain't right. That's not
[1:15:30] in the word. Cuz I'm in the word and
[1:15:32] it's not there."
[1:15:34] That's what we're talking about. The
[1:15:35] mind of Christ to catch what God is
[1:15:38] saying and doing by his word. So that as
[1:15:40] soon as something comes off that's not
[1:15:42] supposed to be there, we say, "Hold on a
[1:15:44] second.
[1:15:46] Hold on a second."
[1:15:48] Like we read about the prophets of Ahab
[1:15:51] and that king, he came and he says, "Do
[1:15:53] you have a prophet of God, though?"
[1:15:55] Something wasn't sitting right.
[1:15:58] Something wasn't sitting right. Remember
[1:16:00] what Paul says? We've got to try the
[1:16:02] spirits,
[1:16:04] church. A believer is supposed to catch
[1:16:06] it before the fruits ever come out.
[1:16:10] That's a hard thing to say. Why? Because
[1:16:12] you can try it by the word. And we're
[1:16:15] not just now listening to the words, but
[1:16:17] we're looking at the attitudes. We're
[1:16:19] looking at the approaches. We're looking
[1:16:21] at the angles. We're looking at the how
[1:16:23] tightly people are trying to hold on to
[1:16:24] things. Are they forcing it through?
[1:16:29] What's going on? And we look at that and
[1:16:31] we take it and we judge the whole thing
[1:16:32] by the word. And the spirit of God
[1:16:34] raises red flags all the time, doesn't
[1:16:36] he? That's the way it works. You know,
[1:16:38] when I was studying on this, I thought
[1:16:40] about our brother Nelson Guy, you know,
[1:16:41] he's a he's a hunting guide. And we go
[1:16:44] out and as much as we like to think we
[1:16:47] can hunt, ain't none of us can hunt like
[1:16:48] Nelson. And we're going out and we've
[1:16:51] learned from him to look for things that
[1:16:54] show where the moose are or where
[1:16:56] they've been, how long it's been since
[1:16:59] they've been through. But there's still
[1:17:00] things, church, that we don't catch.
[1:17:03] But he catches. Why? He's been in the
[1:17:06] woods so much. He knows when something's
[1:17:08] out of kilter. He'll catch a branch
[1:17:11] that's bent. He'll see a little dark
[1:17:13] spot in the woods where they've just
[1:17:14] gone through and knocked some of the dew
[1:17:16] off or whatever. He'll see things we
[1:17:18] never see. Why? Because he's a guide.
[1:17:21] He's been there. He knows what it's
[1:17:23] supposed to look like. And every little
[1:17:25] thing, he catches it.
[1:17:28] I'm not going to catch everything that's
[1:17:29] off. But there's a spirit inside of us.
[1:17:31] Amen. There's a Holy Spirit. There's a
[1:17:32] mind of Christ that's inside of us. And
[1:17:34] that's what I'm resting in. I'm not
[1:17:36] resting in my discernment. I'm resting
[1:17:38] in being surrendered to what he's
[1:17:39] catching. So I can stop and say, "Hold
[1:17:42] on a second now. Something's off." And
[1:17:45] church, many times I don't know what's
[1:17:47] off. All I know is something's off. And
[1:17:49] then I've got to take it before God and
[1:17:51] I've got to say, "God, what's wrong
[1:17:54] here?
[1:17:56] This is a this is someone that I
[1:17:58] respect. This is a believer in the
[1:17:59] church. This is a minister. This is
[1:18:01] whatever it might be." And say, "Lord,
[1:18:03] what's the problem here? cuz I'm getting
[1:18:05] something that's holding me back, but I
[1:18:07] don't know what it is. What are you
[1:18:08] seeing that I'm missing?
[1:18:11] That's what the mind of Christ is
[1:18:12] supposed to do. Amen. The guide sees
[1:18:15] things that other people never notices.
[1:18:17] And remember, church, in the Christian,
[1:18:19] in the true believer's life, Satan is
[1:18:21] always working in subtlety. He is not
[1:18:24] obvious. It takes knowing the word to
[1:18:28] catch it every single time.
[1:18:31] It's got to become natural to us. And
[1:18:34] the thing is, if we're feeding on
[1:18:35] everything else plus the word, what does
[1:18:37] it do? It muddles the picture. It dulls
[1:18:41] the senses. It dulls the senses. You
[1:18:44] know, um, when you're when you're eating
[1:18:46] really cleanly,
[1:18:48] if you go off sugar, for instance, boy,
[1:18:51] you go off sugar for a month and then
[1:18:52] somebody gives you something with a
[1:18:53] bunch of sugar in it, you know what you
[1:18:55] say?
[1:18:57] Number one, it's too much. It's
[1:18:59] overpowering because everything we eat
[1:19:00] these days is oversweetened.
[1:19:02] But the other thing is your body rejects
[1:19:04] it. It doesn't like it. It'll make you
[1:19:06] sick because you've gotten you you've
[1:19:09] gotten to a point where what's natural
[1:19:10] to you is to be clean. But if you're
[1:19:13] constantly blending sugar with your diet
[1:19:15] here, a little there a little, guess
[1:19:16] what? Sugar doesn't bother you anymore.
[1:19:18] It doesn't have that same reaction. And
[1:19:19] so it doesn't raise a warning flag. He's
[1:19:22] saying here, you've got to do what you
[1:19:24] do in the natural. You got to do daily
[1:19:26] in the spiritual so that you have that
[1:19:29] channel that God can operate through. I
[1:19:31] remember the first time I drove a car
[1:19:32] and I didn't have a license and I was
[1:19:34] out in central. My dad used to take us
[1:19:35] to his in-laws cabins out there and we
[1:19:37] were going into a little town. It's the
[1:19:39] middle of nowhere. There's no real
[1:19:40] traffic and he says, "Hey, do you want
[1:19:41] to drive the van in to this little
[1:19:43] town?" He was with me, of course. So, I
[1:19:45] said, "Sure." I mean, of course. I I
[1:19:46] think I was 16 at the time, something
[1:19:48] like that. And so, we're driving out
[1:19:50] into this outport and it's a narrow
[1:19:51] winding road right next to the ocean.
[1:19:53] And so, I'm driving so slowly and
[1:19:55] carefully and because I don't want to
[1:19:56] crash. I don't want to hit anybody. I
[1:19:58] definitely don't want to go into the
[1:19:59] ocean. I don't want to make a mess of
[1:20:00] things. But now, scroll forward 25
[1:20:04] years, almost 30 years. I could drive
[1:20:07] that road one-handed while talking to my
[1:20:10] wife and not think anything of it at
[1:20:13] double the speed limit. Why? Because
[1:20:15] I've driven so much. It's become natural
[1:20:17] to me. It's nature to me. It's reflex. I
[1:20:20] don't even have to think about I don't
[1:20:21] have to think about how hard I'm pushing
[1:20:23] the gas or how I'm steering or anything
[1:20:25] like that. I just drive because I know
[1:20:26] how to drive. Now,
[1:20:29] I'm reminded of Sister Betty. The last
[1:20:31] couple of months, while Brother Gerald
[1:20:33] was taking a break from driving, Sister
[1:20:35] Betty had to drive him around. Now, let
[1:20:37] me tell you this. Sister Betty has
[1:20:38] always had a license. And she's always
[1:20:41] known how to drive. But guess what? She
[1:20:44] hasn't been driving for a really long
[1:20:45] time. Isn't that right, Sister Betty?
[1:20:47] And I guarantee you, I don't want to put
[1:20:48] words into your mouth. I guarantee you,
[1:20:50] she was nervous. I guarantee he was more
[1:20:52] nervous. But I guarantee you she was
[1:20:54] nervous. And I'll bet you she was a
[1:20:56] little bit herkyjerky and going slow and
[1:20:58] she probably got honked at a few times
[1:20:59] for being, you know, a little too slow
[1:21:01] to jump out into traffic and take No,
[1:21:03] but what is it? She's always had it
[1:21:06] available. She just hasn't been
[1:21:08] practicing. And so just as she was
[1:21:10] getting good at it, Brother Gerald
[1:21:11] decided to take the the steering wheel
[1:21:12] back. But I guarantee you, she's feeling
[1:21:14] a lot more comfortable today driving
[1:21:16] that car than she did the first day.
[1:21:18] It's becoming second nature because
[1:21:20] she's doing it all the time. But
[1:21:23] remember, we spoke about last service
[1:21:25] because sometimes the reason we're
[1:21:27] lacking in faith is because we're using
[1:21:29] it so rarely that we never get to build
[1:21:31] it up.
[1:21:33] Now, that's a that's that's a hard truth
[1:21:35] maybe to take this evening, but the
[1:21:36] reason is because we keep going in and
[1:21:38] out of his word and our way, his mind
[1:21:40] and our mind, what he wants and what we
[1:21:43] want. And we're stepping in and out of
[1:21:45] those things. And so, every time we use
[1:21:47] our faith, it's like the first time we
[1:21:48] used our faith. And so, we're never
[1:21:51] progressing. We're just holding in the
[1:21:52] same place we've always been. Amen.
[1:21:54] We're just using it intermittently.
[1:21:56] Brother Brandon would say, "Exercise
[1:21:57] faith. Get some muscles on it." That's a
[1:22:00] direct quote. Exercise faith, get some
[1:22:03] muscles on it. Remember, he says faith
[1:22:04] has a hairy chest.
[1:22:08] Great for us men, not so good for the
[1:22:11] sisters. But he say he said when faith
[1:22:13] speaks, everything else shuts up.
[1:22:17] The mind of Christ always speaks with
[1:22:19] faith. But we've got to exercise that
[1:22:22] faith. And how does that come? Amen.
[1:22:24] You've got to build it up. Now, if
[1:22:26] you've ever tried to build muscle, our
[1:22:28] our men here that were athletes as young
[1:22:30] men, listen, you don't build muscles by
[1:22:32] sitting at home. You don't build muscles
[1:22:34] by doing the same thing you've always
[1:22:36] done. But to build muscle, you got to
[1:22:39] strain and you got to pull and you got
[1:22:40] to push and you got to go further and
[1:22:43] harder than you've ever gone before,
[1:22:45] even to failure. If you can get your
[1:22:47] muscles to fail, that's when you become
[1:22:50] strong. Failure is required to maximize
[1:22:54] muscle growth because you've used every
[1:22:56] little bit of it. Amen. You got to keep
[1:22:59] pushing your muscles to get them to
[1:23:01] grow. Amen. And I'll tell you this,
[1:23:03] nobody pushes harder than a trainer.
[1:23:08] When I first went back to the gym after
[1:23:10] I came back to uh to Canada, I've been
[1:23:12] in a car wreck in Texas and so things
[1:23:14] were a little messed up. And so we we
[1:23:16] paid good money to have a trainer train
[1:23:18] me for the first six months to make sure
[1:23:20] I didn't injure myself and kind of just
[1:23:22] rebuilt myself back together and was
[1:23:24] good and stable before I took over
[1:23:25] myself. And I'll tell you this, he
[1:23:27] pushed me way beyond what I thought I
[1:23:29] could ever do. That's what coaches did,
[1:23:31] didn't they? Coaches will run you till
[1:23:32] you puke. They'll make you go one more
[1:23:35] lap. When you think you got nothing
[1:23:36] left, they'll make you go one more lap.
[1:23:37] A good friend will do that as well.
[1:23:41] But they push you harder than you ever
[1:23:43] thought you could go. and you realize
[1:23:44] all of a sudden you had more than you
[1:23:46] realized you thought you had. That's
[1:23:48] what the Holy Spirit's here to do by the
[1:23:49] word. It's here to show there's more
[1:23:51] here than you think. You've got more
[1:23:53] than you realize if you'll just let me
[1:23:56] use it. If you'll just let me push you
[1:23:58] to that point, you'll realize there's
[1:24:00] more to you. Remember what brother Brand
[1:24:02] would say? There was that woman sitting
[1:24:03] out there in the audience and he called
[1:24:06] her out and she was healed and he says,
[1:24:08] "You didn't know you had that much
[1:24:09] faith.
[1:24:12] There's more to us than meets the eye,
[1:24:15] but we don't know it because we're not
[1:24:16] putting into practice. And so that's
[1:24:18] what the trials and tribulations of life
[1:24:20] are here to do is to pull out that faith
[1:24:22] to get those muscles working so we can
[1:24:24] see I am a child of God. Not just
[1:24:27] because I've received the word, but
[1:24:28] because the word is working inside of my
[1:24:30] life and I'm getting the results of it
[1:24:31] out of it. The trainer knows more than
[1:24:34] we do and he keeps pushing us no matter
[1:24:37] if we're ready to quit or to stop.
[1:24:41] What's the intention of what's the
[1:24:42] intention of all what brother Brandham's
[1:24:44] saying here? Why is why is he he pushing
[1:24:46] us so hard? Why is Peter pushing us so
[1:24:47] hard to to let go to walk in faith?
[1:24:51] He says because we were first created
[1:24:54] for that purpose to control, to rule,
[1:24:57] and to praise God and to live for God.
[1:25:00] Amen. What a statement to make. But
[1:25:01] we're coming to this idea of becoming
[1:25:03] the channel of the mind of Christ, the
[1:25:05] privilege that it brings. And he says if
[1:25:07] we could just completely throw ourselves
[1:25:10] to God and his will, we'd start doing
[1:25:12] the spiritual things as easily and as
[1:25:15] naturally as we do the natural things.
[1:25:19] &gt;&gt; Now that's a simple principle, isn't it?
[1:25:22] That's a very simple principle.
[1:25:25] You say, "Well, I don't spend enough
[1:25:26] time reading my Bible." Then read a
[1:25:28] little bit more. Read a little bit more.
[1:25:30] Don't jump to an hour. You are, if
[1:25:32] you're not even doing it, start with
[1:25:33] five minutes a day. Start with one
[1:25:35] chapter a day.
[1:25:37] and slowly build yourself up to two and
[1:25:39] three and four and five, having a time
[1:25:41] of prayer, reading a message, listening
[1:25:43] to a message.
[1:25:45] Don't jump in and think you're going to
[1:25:47] become a superch Christian overnight,
[1:25:48] but you got to build your faith muscles
[1:25:50] up. You got to build up your walk. Go
[1:25:52] progressively. You'll stick with it a
[1:25:54] whole lot longer because you'll start to
[1:25:55] see those results. It'll be a little
[1:25:57] simpler if we go that. Amen.
[1:26:00] But what happens?
[1:26:02] He says we've got to throw ourselves
[1:26:05] completely.
[1:26:07] He says, "And be lost to our own
[1:26:09] thoughts." Remember last two services we
[1:26:10] talked about that flip-flop. My way, his
[1:26:13] way, mine hit my mind, his mind, what I
[1:26:15] want, what he wants. He says, "No, you
[1:26:16] got to knock that off. You got to commit
[1:26:18] one way or the other. Otherwise, you're
[1:26:20] in the lukewarm position. Hot, cold,
[1:26:23] hot, cold. Him, me, him, me."
[1:26:27] Word, logic, word, reason. That's the
[1:26:30] definition of lukewarm.
[1:26:32] Lukewarm ain't going to cut a church.
[1:26:33] That's halfway Christianity and halfway
[1:26:35] Christianity only gets you halfway.
[1:26:38] Halfway is not the goal. Halfway is
[1:26:41] still failure. Halfway is still
[1:26:43] disappointment. Amen. Better than most
[1:26:46] people is not the goal here. A rapture,
[1:26:48] a resurrection is the goal.
[1:26:51] So this flip-flopping, it's got to stop.
[1:26:53] Amen. That's our goal is to get out of
[1:26:55] here. Brother would say this and it just
[1:26:57] echoed in my heart. He says, "Why don't
[1:26:59] you just come to Christ and settle the
[1:27:01] whole thing?" He says, "Once born again,
[1:27:03] that settles it forever. Once born of
[1:27:05] the spirit of God, you have everlasting
[1:27:07] life and cannot come into condemnation,
[1:27:09] but have passed from death to life." He
[1:27:11] says, "Then you can enjoy yourself." He
[1:27:14] says, "Then it's a pleasure to pray. You
[1:27:16] don't have to wonder about whether God's
[1:27:17] going. When you kneel to pray, you're
[1:27:19] right in his presence. When you're
[1:27:21] walking on the streets, you're right in
[1:27:22] his presence. Wherever you are, you're
[1:27:24] in his presence all the time. for you
[1:27:26] have perfect fellowship with the Son of
[1:27:28] God. He says, "What a marvelous,
[1:27:30] victorious life." But what's the
[1:27:32] problem? We're not taking the time to
[1:27:34] enjoy our victorious life. We're missing
[1:27:38] the privilege. We're missing the
[1:27:39] opportunity to come into his presence. I
[1:27:42] remember when I was in church before I
[1:27:44] gave my heart to the Lord and in my
[1:27:46] soul, I wanted to surrender my life to
[1:27:48] Christ, but my mind didn't want it and
[1:27:50] my flesh didn't want it and my career
[1:27:52] didn't want it. And so I fought and I
[1:27:55] fought and so I'd just be miserable in
[1:27:57] church. And I blamed it all on Brother
[1:28:00] Gerald.
[1:28:03] Why? Because I was miserable. Because
[1:28:05] church was too long,
[1:28:08] right?
[1:28:10] It's too long when you're under
[1:28:11] conviction. That's the truth.
[1:28:15] Amen. God bless you, Brother Gerald,
[1:28:17] tonight.
[1:28:19] God bless you.
[1:28:21] It's too long when you want to praise,
[1:28:24] but you know your life's in no place to
[1:28:25] be praising God. When h when onethird of
[1:28:28] you wants to give in and the other
[1:28:30] twothirds are just beating up that soul,
[1:28:31] saying, "Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't
[1:28:33] do it. You'll regret it." And so, what
[1:28:34] was I? I was miserable all the time.
[1:28:37] Miserable all the time. Amen. I'd be
[1:28:39] fighting with myself the whole time.
[1:28:41] Nobody enjoys that. Brother B would he'd
[1:28:44] say the same thing. He says, "Halfway
[1:28:45] life is the most miserable thing there
[1:28:47] is." He says, ' And by the way, there's
[1:28:49] no such a thing as a halfway Christian.
[1:28:51] You've never seen one. You never will.
[1:28:53] Did you ever see a black white bird at
[1:28:55] the same time? Did you ever see a drunk
[1:28:56] sober man? Did you ever see a sinner
[1:28:58] saint? He said, "You're either a sinner
[1:29:00] or a saint. You're on one side of the
[1:29:02] fence." He says, "And if you're born
[1:29:03] again, you're saved. And if you're not
[1:29:05] born again, you're outside of Christ
[1:29:07] without hope, without God in the world."
[1:29:09] He says, "God's made preparations for
[1:29:12] you to be saved." How did I get out of
[1:29:14] being miserable? I took the way that God
[1:29:16] had prepared. I gave my life to him. I
[1:29:18] repented. I was I surrendered my life. I
[1:29:20] was baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:29:22] Jesus Christ. I gave control to him. And
[1:29:24] then I sought the baptism of the Holy
[1:29:26] Spirit. And when I got that church, that
[1:29:27] was it. I was content. I was content
[1:29:31] that Brother Gerald preached long.
[1:29:36] I was content to be in church with this
[1:29:38] group of people. I was content that my
[1:29:40] career went in a completely different
[1:29:42] direction.
[1:29:43] Why? Because I had satisfaction. No,
[1:29:47] something had changed inside of me. Now
[1:29:50] the soul is satisfied. Church, when the
[1:29:52] soul is satisfied, that's what really
[1:29:54] gives us that deep peace and rest.
[1:29:55] Remember, Brother Bram says it's that
[1:29:57] settled something in your heart. When
[1:29:59] the soul is at rest, yes, this flesh, it
[1:30:01] might hurt. It might be uncomfortable.
[1:30:03] Our emotions might get offended. We
[1:30:04] might get worked up about things. But in
[1:30:06] your soul, there's a deep peace and
[1:30:08] there's a deep rest. Amen.
[1:30:12] This flesh may not have got the fun it
[1:30:13] wanted, but I say, "Praise the Lord
[1:30:14] today." Anyhow, amen. That's why I'm
[1:30:16] here today is because I took his
[1:30:18] prepared way.
[1:30:20] He says that's the only way you can do a
[1:30:22] right kind of a job for the Lord is to
[1:30:24] put everything you got right to the
[1:30:26] forefront for Christ. Notice to the
[1:30:29] forefront.
[1:30:32] Because so many times we give it, but we
[1:30:34] give it in second place, third place,
[1:30:37] fourth place. He says, "No, you got to
[1:30:39] take everything you got and you got to
[1:30:41] put him first at the same time." He
[1:30:43] says, "All your strength, all your soul,
[1:30:45] all your heart, all your mind,
[1:30:46] everything you have." He says, "When
[1:30:48] you're doing anything, do it right or
[1:30:51] don't do it at all." He says, "Just
[1:30:54] leave it alone." If you're going to be a
[1:30:56] Christian, he says, "Put everything
[1:30:57] you've got to Christ, your time, your
[1:30:59] talent, your everything." Remember I
[1:31:01] said last service, the problem if we
[1:31:03] don't give it our all or we give it a
[1:31:04] half-hearted effort or it's half him and
[1:31:06] half us, is that we drag enough of God
[1:31:08] into there that it brings a reproach on
[1:31:10] Christ himself.
[1:31:12] So, we got to go all the way or he says
[1:31:14] you're better off not doing it. But what
[1:31:16] does this look like? What does this look
[1:31:18] like? What's what what does it mean when
[1:31:20] he says, "What a reality to dwell in the
[1:31:22] channel of Christ." And he says, "You
[1:31:24] got to throw yourself completely into
[1:31:26] Christ and be lost to your own
[1:31:27] thoughts." We've got to completely trust
[1:31:29] the word. You know, I and again, I'm not
[1:31:32] trying to be carnal here tonight
[1:31:34] speaking of personal experiences, but I
[1:31:35] think it gives us an idea if we can talk
[1:31:37] about maybe the natural, it'll help us
[1:31:39] see the spiritual. And I remember the
[1:31:41] first time I rode with my father in a
[1:31:42] serious sports car. And he took it and
[1:31:45] he ran it hard through a corner. And I'm
[1:31:48] sitting there and this is the first time
[1:31:49] he's driven that fast in a car with that
[1:31:51] capability in my life. I'm just a young
[1:31:53] kid, maybe 10 years old, 11 years old.
[1:31:55] And he's going through the corner and
[1:31:57] I'm seeing and the feet are dancing on
[1:31:58] the pedals. And if you've ever driven a
[1:32:00] car right at the limit and balanced on
[1:32:02] the edge of traction, the hands are
[1:32:03] constantly twitching the whole way. And
[1:32:05] at first I was scared because I'd never
[1:32:08] gone that fast through a corner for that
[1:32:10] long.
[1:32:11] But then I stopped. And this is the
[1:32:14] Germanic side of me. I said, "He's my
[1:32:16] dad. He would not put my heart in
[1:32:18] danger. He would not put my life in
[1:32:20] danger. He's just trying to show me what
[1:32:22] this thing is capable of."
[1:32:25] And I said, "I trust him. I trust him
[1:32:27] not to hurt me." And so what did I do? I
[1:32:29] relaxed and I said, "I'm going to enjoy
[1:32:31] this." And I had a riot. It was a blast.
[1:32:33] Why? because I trusted what he was doing
[1:32:35] even though it felt so uncomfortable for
[1:32:38] the first time. It's the same for us.
[1:32:42] I'll tell you what, it's not a thrill
[1:32:44] the first time you step onto the word by
[1:32:46] faith. When you step off solid ground,
[1:32:49] you step off logic, you step off reason,
[1:32:51] you step off financial security, you
[1:32:53] step off your your family approvals, you
[1:32:55] step off your relationships, and you
[1:32:56] stand on the word, it's not a thrill.
[1:32:59] It's usually a little bit fearful
[1:33:01] because you don't know what's going to
[1:33:03] happen.
[1:33:04] You believe what's going to happen, but
[1:33:07] for the first time, you don't know if
[1:33:08] it's going to work or not. It's like
[1:33:09] going on a roller coaster the first
[1:33:10] time. How is it going to feel? Am I
[1:33:13] going to like it? Am I going to hate it?
[1:33:15] Like I said before, I didn't give my
[1:33:16] life to Christ because I thought I would
[1:33:18] maybe not like it, but I was miserable
[1:33:20] where I was at. And you step out in
[1:33:23] faith on the word in something that
[1:33:26] really matters.
[1:33:28] Maybe not life or death, but it's very
[1:33:30] uncomfortable if it doesn't work out.
[1:33:32] And you step out by faith and you're
[1:33:34] standing there and and it's like you're
[1:33:36] standing on an island. You're all alone.
[1:33:38] All your supports are gone away. And
[1:33:41] you're standing there and you say,
[1:33:42] "Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe." And
[1:33:45] you stand there and the greatest thrill
[1:33:47] in the world is when he comes down and
[1:33:49] he fulfills his word in your life. As
[1:33:51] you believe it, he does it. Now, what's
[1:33:55] not so thrilling is the trial of faith
[1:33:57] that often is between the step and the
[1:33:59] fulfillment. Remember what Peter says?
[1:34:02] He says that the trial of your faith
[1:34:03] being more precious than gold tried in
[1:34:04] the fire. You'll realize the value of it
[1:34:07] later, but there's a whole lot of flesh
[1:34:08] dying that happens in there in the
[1:34:11] meantime. Amen. But he's saying this is
[1:34:13] how we get there. We've got to throw
[1:34:14] ourselves completely into Christ.
[1:34:19] Totally. He says we've totally lost
[1:34:22] ourselves to our own thoughts.
[1:34:25] Amen.
[1:34:26] Watch how Brother Brandham builds this
[1:34:28] platform for us to stand on, for us to
[1:34:29] live by. He says, "Now Jesus said, if
[1:34:33] you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:34:35] you, you can ask what you will and it
[1:34:37] shall be given unto you." He says, "Now
[1:34:39] the father and his word are inseparable
[1:34:41] because the word is his son. In the
[1:34:44] beginning was the word. The word was
[1:34:45] with God. The word was God. The word was
[1:34:47] made flesh and dwelt among us." He said,
[1:34:49] "God and his word are inseparable. You
[1:34:51] cannot have God without having his word.
[1:34:53] And when you have his word, you have
[1:34:54] God. So here's the foundation of it all.
[1:34:57] This is the starting point. Okay? But
[1:34:59] then he says, now if you want to go back
[1:35:01] a little further, just as far as
[1:35:03] historical, we could see the word. He
[1:35:05] says, in the beginning is was the word.
[1:35:07] He says, but what is a word? A word is a
[1:35:09] thought manifested. A thought spoken
[1:35:11] forth. God first he perceived the
[1:35:14] thought and spoke it and it became a
[1:35:16] word and the word became material. He
[1:35:19] says, "So everything that God has spoken
[1:35:21] in his word received into the right
[1:35:24] channel will materialize that word for
[1:35:28] whatever the promise behind it is." He
[1:35:31] says, "God will do it." He's obligated
[1:35:33] to it. Now, what's the key there? He
[1:35:35] says, "Received into the right channel."
[1:35:38] What's the right channel? The mind of
[1:35:40] Christ. Amen. The mind of Christ is
[1:35:43] what? A revelation of the will of God
[1:35:46] for you. It's the word for your day. for
[1:35:48] your life, for your family, for your
[1:35:50] church, your position, your work through
[1:35:52] your decisions, whatever it might be.
[1:35:54] But notice what he says. It's got to be
[1:35:56] received.
[1:35:59] Why? Because the mind of Christ is a
[1:36:01] receiving channel.
[1:36:04] Amen. It's not a broadcasting channel.
[1:36:07] It's a receiving channel. Amen. We're
[1:36:10] tuned to the word. We're pre-built.
[1:36:12] We're pre-tuned to receive it into our
[1:36:14] hearts. Amen. To receive what God's
[1:36:16] saying to us. We've preached on this
[1:36:18] idea of an echo chamber gospel, but
[1:36:20] that's where we speak and other people
[1:36:23] repeat it and we go find those people
[1:36:24] that believe like we do and we get them
[1:36:26] to repeat. We're a broadcasting channel.
[1:36:30] But he says that's not the way it works.
[1:36:31] We've got to be a receiving channel.
[1:36:34] We've got to catch what he's saying.
[1:36:36] Amen. In an echo chamber, we plan, we
[1:36:39] think, we speak, we decide. And but in
[1:36:42] this one he says now it's different
[1:36:44] because we've lost our own thinking.
[1:36:47] Brother Brown would say you've got no
[1:36:49] thought coming.
[1:36:52] He says you've lost your own thinking.
[1:36:54] Amen. And now this bride is receiving a
[1:36:56] gospel. She's receiving a word. She's
[1:36:59] receiving the plan and purpose of God.
[1:37:01] And now her role is to play that on
[1:37:04] repeat until it comes forth.
[1:37:07] Amen. That's all that she can say
[1:37:11] because she is receiving. She's not a
[1:37:14] broadcast.
[1:37:16] She's just reflecting what comes in.
[1:37:18] She's a microphone. That's all she is.
[1:37:21] Amen. We don't have to try and sort it
[1:37:23] out. We just have to receive it. What
[1:37:28] did Mary say? How can these things be?
[1:37:31] Now, when he said, "You're going to be
[1:37:33] overshadowed by the Holy Ghost." Do you
[1:37:34] think Mary understood all all the
[1:37:36] technicalities of how God was going to
[1:37:38] put a creative uh baby inside of her?
[1:37:42] No. But what did she say? Be it unto me
[1:37:45] according to thy word. She received the
[1:37:47] word.
[1:37:49] We don't have to argue at church. We
[1:37:51] don't have to explain it. We don't have
[1:37:53] to rebuke people when they come against
[1:37:55] us. We just have to stay with the word.
[1:37:58] It's that simple. Amen. We just repeat
[1:38:01] what the spirit of God is saying. And
[1:38:03] that's what keeps us in the channel of
[1:38:05] Christ, in the mind of Christ. Watch
[1:38:07] this. He says, "Then if you abide in me
[1:38:09] and my word abide in you, then you have
[1:38:11] God, the word in you." He said, "You
[1:38:14] believe the word just as you believe God
[1:38:16] because it is God and it's inseparable."
[1:38:18] Then he says, "If you have God's word in
[1:38:20] you
[1:38:22] and you have God's life in you," he
[1:38:26] says, then you have God in you.
[1:38:30] Remember Jesus said, "You've got to
[1:38:32] worship me in spirit and in truth." What
[1:38:35] he's saying here is if you've got the
[1:38:36] truth and you've got the spirit, you've
[1:38:38] got God.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; You've got all that he is.
[1:38:42] At least as much as it's revealed to us
[1:38:44] in this time and season.
[1:38:46] He says, "And then whatever God's word
[1:38:50] speaks forth out of you, it'll have to
[1:38:53] come to pass just like it was spoke from
[1:38:56] God." says, in other words, just as if
[1:38:58] it was spoken from God.
[1:39:02] Notice he doesn't say you speak. He says
[1:39:05] the word speaks forth out of you.
[1:39:08] Completely different situation. Amen.
[1:39:12] Jesus said, "My word has to abide in you
[1:39:14] before you get what you ask for." We've
[1:39:17] seen the spoken word in operation,
[1:39:18] haven't we? We saw it in Moses day. We
[1:39:22] saw it in Joshua's day. We saw it in
[1:39:24] Samuel's day. We saw it in Jesus day. We
[1:39:26] saw it in the apostles day and we saw it
[1:39:28] in our day. We saw a prophet with the
[1:39:30] spoken word. But what was it church? It
[1:39:32] was a ch it was a person operating under
[1:39:35] the channel of the word of God for their
[1:39:37] life, walking in faith according to what
[1:39:40] the spirit of God had said to them. And
[1:39:42] so when they spoke, they did it by
[1:39:45] obedience, by revelation, not by
[1:39:48] determining it themselves.
[1:39:51] That's the only way it'll work. Why?
[1:39:53] Because it was God's word, not their
[1:39:55] word. It was God's plan, not their plan.
[1:39:57] It was God's desire, not their want.
[1:40:01] It was all God. Amen. It was a
[1:40:02] surrendered life, living out, speaking
[1:40:05] out the word that had been brought to
[1:40:06] them. He says, Jesus said, "Whatever you
[1:40:09] ask my fa the father in my name, that
[1:40:11] will I do." He says, "Did you ever
[1:40:13] realize what that means? You realize if
[1:40:16] we go before God in the name of Jesus,
[1:40:18] it's just the same as Jesus himself
[1:40:21] praying." Whoa. He says it isn't me
[1:40:25] praying anymore. If I come in his name
[1:40:28] and he recognizes his name and Jesus
[1:40:31] said whatever you ask the father in my
[1:40:32] name that I do. And then I go to the
[1:40:35] father in Jesus name. He says it isn't
[1:40:37] me preaching anymore. It's Jesus. It's
[1:40:40] his spirit praying through me. Church,
[1:40:42] now we're getting somewhere. Now we're
[1:40:45] getting somewhere. But you do you see
[1:40:46] the difference of what he's saying?
[1:40:48] Because what he's saying is sometimes
[1:40:49] we're praying and it's us praying. It's
[1:40:52] our will. It's our desire. It's our
[1:40:54] discernment. It's our thinking. It's our
[1:40:57] preference. But he says, but there's a
[1:40:58] reality. There is a channel where you
[1:41:01] can come to a place, a unity of Christ
[1:41:03] where you come before the throne of God.
[1:41:05] And it's not you that's praying out.
[1:41:07] It's the spirit that's praying through
[1:41:09] you. And it brings you to a place where
[1:41:11] you catch exactly what God wants.
[1:41:14] Amen. It brings you into the very will
[1:41:18] of God. And now you're praying exactly
[1:41:20] what he wants to be done, not just
[1:41:23] praying for your thing. Church, there's
[1:41:25] nothing wrong with going in and praying
[1:41:27] for our preferences. And I say that by
[1:41:29] the authority of the word. Jesus in the
[1:41:31] garden of Gethsemane said, "If it be
[1:41:33] possible, let this cup pass from me."
[1:41:35] His preference, the man, Jesus of
[1:41:38] Nazareth, the preference of that man
[1:41:40] praying was, "I don't want to die. I
[1:41:41] don't want to go through the pain, the
[1:41:43] rejection, the hardship, the beating at
[1:41:44] the whipping post. I don't want to go
[1:41:46] through a crucifixion. I don't want to
[1:41:48] die.
[1:41:49] And guess what? A lot of times that's
[1:41:51] how we enter prayer, isn't it? I don't
[1:41:54] want. I don't want. Or I do want. I do
[1:41:55] want. I do want. Nothing wrong with it.
[1:41:58] But how did Jesus finish? Nevertheless,
[1:42:01] not my will, but thine be done. And then
[1:42:04] what did he do? He took himself back in
[1:42:06] obedience to the word and he prayed and
[1:42:08] acted according to the word.
[1:42:12] Amen.
[1:42:13] There's a place there where we can come
[1:42:16] in and our prayer is what he wants. Our
[1:42:19] desire is what he wants. Our actions are
[1:42:21] what he wants. We're completely
[1:42:22] surrendered to him. Church, that means
[1:42:24] there's a there's a time of prayer for
[1:42:26] seeking
[1:42:28] way before there's a time of prayer for
[1:42:30] speaking.
[1:42:33] So often we're talking hearing about
[1:42:34] speak the word,
[1:42:36] but how often are we hearing about seek
[1:42:38] the word?
[1:42:40] There's this presumption that we
[1:42:41] automatically speak the word. And we're
[1:42:43] right, church. I can find something in
[1:42:46] this Bible to support just about
[1:42:47] anything I want in my life right now. If
[1:42:50] I want to go find a scripture that
[1:42:52] supports a carnal or a fleshly desire or
[1:42:55] intention or plan, I can find it in the
[1:42:57] word if I want it.
[1:43:00] Now, I can't pull it through the whole
[1:43:01] word, but I can find a word. But we've
[1:43:04] got to be led by the spirit. Remember
[1:43:06] David when he fought the Philistines, he
[1:43:08] went into a valley and he faced them
[1:43:09] head-on. He defeated them. They came
[1:43:11] back to the exact same valley and David
[1:43:12] prayed again and God said, "Don't do it
[1:43:14] that way. Do it another way this time."
[1:43:16] And that's the only way you're going to
[1:43:17] get victory. You got to come up behind
[1:43:19] them. You got to wait till you hear the
[1:43:20] sound of them marching in the malberry
[1:43:21] trees, then attack. And God gave him
[1:43:23] victory. Same exact circumstance. Two
[1:43:25] different ways to go about it to get
[1:43:27] victory. Led by the spirit. Sons of God
[1:43:30] are led by the spirit of God. Amen.
[1:43:36] that shows me there's a place. And we
[1:43:39] can come in and we say, "Lord, I've got
[1:43:40] lots of ideas. I've got lots of
[1:43:41] emotions. I've got discernment. I've got
[1:43:43] this is what I see. This is what I
[1:43:44] think. I've got relationships. I've got
[1:43:46] influences. But Lord, there's one thing
[1:43:48] I want. That's your will." That's the
[1:43:51] the most powerful thing a believer can
[1:43:52] do is say, "Lord, what's your will?"
[1:43:55] I've been praying about a situation for
[1:43:57] quite some time now, just dealing with a
[1:43:59] a certain person, a certain situation,
[1:44:01] and it hasn't been resolved yet. haven't
[1:44:03] even approached it yet. And I've gone
[1:44:05] and I've said and I literally just
[1:44:07] praying this yesterday specifically. And
[1:44:10] I said, 'Lord, here's what I'm seeing.
[1:44:13] Here's what my discernment says. Here's
[1:44:16] how I'm feeling.
[1:44:18] And I said, and here's the attitude I'm
[1:44:19] taking. I said, but I'm not sure that's
[1:44:21] right. So I said, Lord, what do you want
[1:44:25] me to do? I said, and Lord, let's start
[1:44:27] with me first. Lord, what attitude do I
[1:44:31] take? Because if my attitude's wrong, it
[1:44:34] won't matter what else happens after
[1:44:35] that.
[1:44:37] So Lord, give me the right attitude
[1:44:39] before I make any moves here. Give me
[1:44:41] the right attitude. And then after that,
[1:44:43] Lord, show me how to approach it because
[1:44:46] I don't know if I'm right or wrong. I
[1:44:48] don't know if I've been right or wrong.
[1:44:49] I don't know about you, I've been right
[1:44:51] a few times and I've been wrong a whole
[1:44:53] lot of times as a Holy Ghost-filled
[1:44:56] person. I'm not always right. We've got
[1:44:59] to be led by the spirit. Amen. But I
[1:45:02] laid it out before God. I laid out the
[1:45:03] good, the bad, the ugly, how I was
[1:45:05] feeling, what I didn't like, what I did
[1:45:07] like, you know, all of my concerns. And
[1:45:08] I just said, "Lord, show me the right
[1:45:11] approach." And that's what I'm waiting
[1:45:13] on. And until I get that, I won't make a
[1:45:15] move because it's not about me. Church,
[1:45:18] like we said, I don't have a thought
[1:45:19] coming. How I feel, how I agree, how I
[1:45:21] disagree with somebody, it doesn't make
[1:45:23] any difference. I don't have a thought
[1:45:25] coming. It's Lord, what would you have
[1:45:26] your servant to do? That's the approach
[1:45:28] every day. I don't have a feeling. I
[1:45:30] don't have an emotion. I don't have a
[1:45:32] discernment that's worth uh overriding
[1:45:34] the will and the knowledge of God. He
[1:45:35] knows all things. Amen. And if he'll
[1:45:37] show me what to do, the results will be
[1:45:39] exactly the way he wants it. It'll be
[1:45:42] perfect. The results will come out in
[1:45:44] the meantime. He's got a chance to work
[1:45:46] on me. Amen. We all need to be shaped.
[1:45:49] We all need to be trimmed into his
[1:45:50] image. And he can start working on me in
[1:45:52] the meantime. So many times I found that
[1:45:54] these things are not about the other
[1:45:56] person. They're often about me anyways.
[1:45:58] So, it's good to go in and say, 'Lord,
[1:46:00] what do you need to do with me before we
[1:46:01] start working on this other situation?
[1:46:04] Last quote as we start to close.
[1:46:07] He says, "And then I've got to receive
[1:46:09] what I asked for because he said it and
[1:46:11] it's God's own word. It can't do nothing
[1:46:13] else but produce just what it said." He
[1:46:16] says, "So then we believe that we and
[1:46:18] this is the confidence we have in God
[1:46:20] that we get what we ask for for he's God
[1:46:23] and cannot take back his word. He's got
[1:46:25] to stay with his word. He says, "So then
[1:46:28] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:46:32] you, ask what you will and it'll be
[1:46:34] given unto you." He says, "Isn't that
[1:46:36] simple? Faith created," he says, "we
[1:46:38] were made for that purpose. Then through
[1:46:42] the fall, he says, why? We were taken
[1:46:43] away from that and then in redemption,
[1:46:46] we were brought back to it again." Amen.
[1:46:50] God bless you. Let's stand this evening,
[1:46:53] church. That's the place I want to live.
[1:46:54] Amen. I want a place where it's not me
[1:46:57] speaking, it's him speaking.
[1:47:00] Amen. A place where it's him moving, not
[1:47:01] me moving. Where it's him praying, not
[1:47:03] me praying.
[1:47:05] Amen. Where it's him desiring, not me
[1:47:06] wanting. Amen. We can stand. The
[1:47:08] musicians can come.
[1:47:13] It's not just about having the Holy
[1:47:14] Spirit.
[1:47:16] Like we said before, that's just really
[1:47:18] the start of the journey. But now it's
[1:47:19] to be used by the spirit. And I'm not
[1:47:22] preaching this as if we're not being
[1:47:23] used. I believe we are. I believe we are
[1:47:26] I won't I won't name names but it was a
[1:47:28] real encouragement to me that uh someone
[1:47:32] had shared with me they were going
[1:47:33] through a particular thing and they said
[1:47:34] you know someone just felt to give me
[1:47:36] this this verse to kind of help guide me
[1:47:39] through this situation he said and then
[1:47:41] you came and you preached on that exact
[1:47:42] thing. Well, you know why that's an
[1:47:44] encouragement to me? Because it means
[1:47:46] I'm not doing this all alone. It means
[1:47:48] that we've got sons and daughters that
[1:47:50] are led by the spirit of God that God
[1:47:52] can use them and move them. And then
[1:47:54] what he does is he can come behind and
[1:47:55] use me to confirm it sometimes.
[1:47:58] But that we're not all just looking to
[1:47:59] the to the ministry to do this, but that
[1:48:01] the spirit of God moves in hearts and in
[1:48:03] souls to to help each other and to
[1:48:06] support each other and to help guide
[1:48:07] each other in these different things.
[1:48:09] Amen. But that's where I want to be.
[1:48:11] Ready to move,
[1:48:13] ready to act, ready to speak, ready to
[1:48:15] shut up. Whatever he would have me to
[1:48:18] do, to be so close, church, that when he
[1:48:20] moves, I know exactly what he wants
[1:48:22] done. to be so close to him in that.
[1:48:24] Amen. That's what the bride is. She's
[1:48:27] yielded to the bridegroom to the point
[1:48:30] where in the end there's no
[1:48:31] distinguishing between him and her.
[1:48:33] That's really where we're going to go
[1:48:34] with this series as we start to close it
[1:48:36] out over the coming weeks is that that
[1:48:38] singleness, that unity of that perfect
[1:48:40] union with Christ, where we're so close,
[1:48:44] where what we're feeding on, what we're
[1:48:45] dwelling on, what we're thinking on,
[1:48:47] what we're fellowshipping on, it is
[1:48:49] Christ, Christ, Christ. And so nothing
[1:48:51] else can come in. And so it just starts
[1:48:52] to produce him in a greater and greater
[1:48:54] way. And we start to just go up and up
[1:48:56] and up and up. Then we have that last
[1:48:58] little moment and then we're gone. Amen.
[1:49:00] That's where I want to be. I say, "God,
[1:49:02] help us to draw closer to him." Amen.
[1:49:05] That as he moves, as he speaks, how do
[1:49:08] you I you know, you you know this if
[1:49:12] you've been married a while, you get to
[1:49:13] the point
[1:49:15] where you know what they're going to
[1:49:16] say. You know what they want. you know
[1:49:19] how they're going to respond before they
[1:49:21] ever say or speak or do anything. That's
[1:49:24] where Christ wants to be with us. That
[1:49:27] we know what he wants because we've
[1:49:28] spent so much time with him. That we
[1:49:30] know how he speaks because we've heard
[1:49:32] him speak so many times. That we know
[1:49:34] when to move because we've moved on his
[1:49:36] leadership so many times. It's become so
[1:49:40] natural for us that everything else
[1:49:42] feels unnatural. Amen. church. I would
[1:49:44] love it to be to the point where
[1:49:46] everything this world tries to throw at
[1:49:48] me is so unnatural it has no power.
[1:49:51] Amen. God bless you. Let's bow our heads
[1:49:54] together. Heavenly Father,
[1:49:58] Lord, we want to be closer to you,
[1:50:02] Lord. This word is supposed to be
[1:50:03] preparing a bride, Lord. And I believe
[1:50:05] it is,
[1:50:07] Lord, but it's a separation, Lord. Not
[1:50:10] just from the world, but from our flesh
[1:50:11] and from our mind and our thoughts and
[1:50:13] our feelings and all these things that
[1:50:15] Satan likes to just get riled up and
[1:50:17] work with, Lord.
[1:50:19] Lord, but there's a soul and there's a
[1:50:21] control tower in that soul, Lord. And
[1:50:24] there's a presence of your spirit in
[1:50:25] there to help lead us and guide us day
[1:50:27] by day, Lord. I pray that that would
[1:50:29] just be magnified day by day, Lord. That
[1:50:33] you would just have a complete and total
[1:50:35] control over our lives, Lord. that we
[1:50:38] would yearn and seek and hunger after
[1:50:40] those things, Lord. That our our thirst,
[1:50:43] Lord, would just be tuned, Lord. Attuned
[1:50:46] to tasting and seeing, Lord, the
[1:50:48] goodness of you, Lord, that we'd not be
[1:50:51] satisfied with the sweetness of this
[1:50:53] world and the the temptations of this
[1:50:55] world, Lord. But, Lord, but that the
[1:50:57] rich food, the fresh mana, Lord, your
[1:50:59] word that you've given to us would be
[1:51:01] our satisfying portion. and heavenly
[1:51:03] father. Lord, I pray you create a deeper
[1:51:05] hunger and thirst inside of us for these
[1:51:07] things, Lord, that we would want to be
[1:51:09] closer to you,
[1:51:12] Lord. It's not all signs and wonders,
[1:51:15] Lord, but it's that simple, humble,
[1:51:16] victorious Christian life that I'm
[1:51:18] seeking tonight,
[1:51:20] Lord. The arrest will follow, Lord. If
[1:51:21] you're in the right position, if you're
[1:51:23] in a place of preeminence in our life,
[1:51:25] Lord, Lord, if we're truly surrendered,
[1:51:28] everything else will come in. Lord, I
[1:51:30] pray you help us to be surrendered to
[1:51:32] you, Lord. So used to your presence,
[1:51:34] Lord, that nothing else can take your
[1:51:36] place. Lord, be with your people. Bless
[1:51:38] those that made it out tonight. Lord, we
[1:51:40] pray a special grace, Lord, to the Snow
[1:51:42] family, Lord, the family of Brother
