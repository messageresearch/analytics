praise in the name of our lord jesus christ amen jesus is here jesus here jesus is here all things are possible jesus is here jesus is here jesus is there all things are possible jesus is here [Music] amen the lord bless us and let's go right into the word by the grace of god amen and praying again for the lord be with us here and again and thank god we're still under the promise because it says where two or three are gathered amen oh verse five with again that's grace amen thank the lord for that to god be the glory and again before i could before i i moved to come out and to minister i was thinking him by all uh that the congregation was it was all here amen and then and when i come over when i came out oh my i said they're not here i was expecting brother so-and-so citrus also amen and uh not really anticipating the ones that are here but the ones that would have been here amen and praying the grace of god they're online amen listening for the hearing of the word so god bless them oh may the lord help us oh my i pray god that it'll be a it'll be in our hearts here it'll be in the hearts of those that are online amen what the hunger and the thirst amen for fellowship one with another amen just think of what it's going to be like oh yeah god is allowing this for a reason as i said god's allowing this for a reason out there in the world and what's going to happen in the world but he's also a liner for a reason so he can bring out the attitude and the spirit of the believers are they going to hunger and thirst for fellowship amen are they going to hunger and thirst oh for the lord to to move this away so that we can we can get together again amen welcome maybe this is why that the anointing was on on the apostle paul amen the messenger of that first age you know when he encouraged the believers in that age he said forsake not the assembly of yourselves together and much more as you see that day approaching amen the end so brother i believe that really applies to us much more amen because the world is out there under the control of the devil is taking control of all things amen and he's in control of us in that sense amen beware we and you're just making a law and so we got to abide by that law amen and we can't get together like this and as i was i might have mentioned it briefly but it's was shortly just after all this struck with us here i saw it somewhere maybe on the internet it was a picture of a of a believer somewhere in another country and of course what we're experiencing now they experience constantly in that country they live in because you know religion is not allowed and churches is not allowed and all that amen and the brother was saying oh my he said we're out and we're here in the wilderness they said but we we got no umbrellas amen and why would he need a umbrella because it was it was raining so i pray the grace of god you know that we'll really have that hunger and thirst for fellowship whether it's here a few of us two or three at a time or whatever or whether it's like them out there in the wilderness in rain amen so i pray i don't know what country they are in but i pray the grace of god so lord help us that we're not going to take this for granted but lord we're going to allow it to help us to identify with brothers and sisters around the world they are not allowed not allowed to gather in church like this not allowed to gather for fellowship around the word like we are so i thank god for it amen was only two or three allah or five rather allowed in the building here and praying the grace of god that the others amen are still in in in contact by the by the mass by the technology again we wonder why god allowed this why god allowed that the invention of those things amen well he allowed it for a reason amen the others are going to go that way but believers are going to go this way amen so we're appreciating day of the invention amen i'm appreciating what god has done amen though the world out there brother and sister they're they're not exactly into anything spiritual but the true seed of god is amen so we thank the lord for that and again pray the grace of god be with us here and the grace of god be with the saints at home again we're claiming the promise where two or three are gathered in my name there am i in the midst amen and trusting again as i have highlighted that it is it is not us that's gathered but he gathered us where i have gathered two or three together is in my name there am i in the midst amen well if if god didn't gather them he's not there yeah so we pray the grace of god be with us and the saints who are at home or wherever they may be god yes as i've said also that we i've been informed just recently that brethren brothers and sisters different parts of the world have been tuning in on the internet and and listening to the service so i we pray god bless them amen because there are places in different parts of the world they may not have a you know the internet they may not have it themselves the computers and all that but there there are buildings that they can go to a man and they're allowed to go in and sit down and and and use a computer and they and many of them they're those yes number of years they've been doing this some of them they're going to those places and man and maybe they got you know they have to pay something for it but they're going there and they'll go in and sit down and listen to our services amen so god bless them wherever they are whatever part of the world they're in amen now god help us to appreciate amen what we're doing and it's not just for us here it's for those around the world thank god amen so that i pray grace that we don't feel at home in this world anymore as you were singing tonight amen sing the truth by the grace of god amen lord bless us turn with me to romans chapter 5. and tonight i want to share with you some thoughts that brother branham brought to our attention and he preached it in uh in his own church in jeffersonville phantom tabernacle and it's amazing that uh the message is almost it's almost two hours to listen to on a tape but the thing of it is that brother brown never got into preaching oh maybe this message is 30 something or 35 pages and brother brown never got into preaching the message until we reach around i think it's page 13 or 14 something like that when he's or 17 17. it's pay 17 that's when he read the scriptures so he said i'm going to preach for a few minutes amen so we know brother brown's few minutes is not exactly according to our time schedule amen so he went it went a little longer amen because the message herself is almost two hours amen but i'm just going to share with you some of the thoughts that he has expressed and some scriptures concerning the subject that he was preaching on and the subject that he was ministering on is ashamed ashamed we're ashamed of this ashamed of that but i pray grace we're not ashamed of him amen that we're not ashamed of the gospel amen we're not ashamed of the message and there's also to highlight that within the last few days there was a number of things that i came in contact with that were totally completely anti-message amen anti william branham oh yes and there's one gentleman in i want to mention his name but i have been in contact with them when they who were part of the message left the message and because they didn't they didn't believe this they didn't believe that so they walked away from the message and uh and we uh brother joseph would know who they are and because uh they're i'm one of the ones at the accused of you know saying this and doing this and preaching this to cover they said cover up brother branagh's mistakes brother we don't need to cover up ears we need to cover our powers amen our mistakes but again i did my last thoughts with the brother and uh he did say all right he said brother he said i'll just move on he said we'll leave it at that because i was challenging him to do this to do that amen and so he got to the place where he would just end the conversation and we'll leave it at that and so this brother is is there talking for a one and a half hours amen and what's he doing he's trying to bring out mistakes he's trying to bring out this brother brown did this what was it wasn't right he did that wasn't right that wasn't right and maybe he was preaching certain things and he highlighted certain things and he said that wasn't right and oh yeah and he said oh yeah he said this there and then the difference in a different thing he said right here and i said lord i said we pray grace for that man he's gonna need grace for salvation for sure he's taken his stand against the prophet amen he's taken his stand against the message and again i won't say where it is but i have i have come across many many things that are negative against the message negative against william branham so brother i i well i'll tell you this as it was in the prophets in their day and age in the old testament as it was with jesus when he the word was made flesh amen he had to deal with the negatives and and oh he was accused of this accused of that he was condemned for this and condemned for that until they crucified him that's right so brother but what was it it was the truth it was the word in flesh amen but brother again they didn't they didn't see it they'd have read eyes to see they didn't have an ear to hear the word of god god help us and god thank us for that oh yeah that we got eyes to see and we have ears to hear the word by the grace of god amen this grace because you young people are here i call you young even though you're maybe in your 30s late 30s whatever and getting close to 40 amen but it's the grace of god that you're believing the word amen the grace of god that you're staying with the word the grace of god you're hunging and thirsting amen for the word and that you're amen and what god has ordained he's bringing to pass in your life to what poor to hunger thirst for the resurrection and the rapture amen because what god has done in the message of a prophet is to give us the revelation of who we are and where we are and to give alicia give us a revelation of time and what's left amen what is god moving on now not pentecost amen not luther not wesley amen not many others out there that god used no no now now god's getting us to look for the resurrection and the rapture amen it's tremendous when the prophet of god said he said god is waiting on you amen he was waiting on luther he's waiting on wesley amen god did this god did that and there was a time when when they caught the revelation for their day amen and god anointed them with a great anointing and they went forth living it amen and preaching it and now brother and sister are we living it and are we preaching it concerning what god has done today oh yeah we can get into the into the doctrine but that's that's fine amen but god really wants us to be sure on and living our lives for is is the resurrection and the rapture amen that we're going forth as witnesses and by pray grace that we're not ashamed amen he's preaching on this subject ashamed amen we're not ashamed to take our stand for the word we're not ashamed to take our stand for what we believe god did and why god did it it's one thing again understand this to you to us here and then the saints online understand it's not just recognizing and saying oh yeah this is what god did this is what god did i believe it i believe it no it's good but let's believe what he's doing amen but i tell you there's a lot of so-called believers that don't believe what god's doing and they're really not into what god is doing brother actually they're focusing on what he's done when they come when it comes to doctrine but they're not focusing on what why god did it amen and why did god do it he did it to give us a certain faith amen so that there's going to be somebody here believing this somebody here looking for this looking for that the resurrection and the rapture again god help us amen sir brother and again i believe god's going to would allow it to go on to the generation that's here and he said the third or the fourth generation usually he says that's the ones that go to the denomination but why because the greater number less past that believes it the greater number that knows what god is doing and why brother because they're going to go on amen and there's going to be another generation brother i tell you if if we're going on and our brother paul is still here and brother matthew and brother brother yes brother he's still here you're all still here and and the brothers and sisters i pray god you will be here amen brother and not just oh yeah not just uh saying i believe the message but no you're going to believe what god is wanting you to believe amen because if the older generation goes off the scene god wants somebody here by the grace of god that's believing it amen you're going going away from the doctrine into the revelation of the resurrection into the revelation of the rapture amen so i pray grace grace grace and again god forgive i pray those brothers out there that are online and and condemning william branham condemning this just teaching that teaching oh yeah it's amazing absolutely amazing for a person to go online for an hour and a half and just talk negative negative negative against the prophet and against the message god help us amen so let's go into romans chapter 5 and begin reading the first five verses amen therefore being justified by faith we have peace with god amen he said through our lord jesus christ amen thank god for jesus by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand amen and rejoice in hope of the glory of god and not only so but with glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope amen and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us amen hope that maketh not ashamed because the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost which is given unto us amen the lord bless you may be seated and turn with me to second second timothy chapter one amen second timothy chapter 1 and verse 6 wherefore i put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god which is in thee by the putting off of my hands for god has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind amen for not though be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our lord nor of me is prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god who has saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works but according to his own purpose amen and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began amen praise the lord just think that we're in the mind of god before the world began amen and god god was doing what he wanted he would want to want to do in these in this day this age he was doing it then he put it in your heart then he put in your soul then amen by the grace of god hallelujah see again verse 9 who has saved us and called us with an holy calling not according to our works no but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in christ jesus before the world began but is now made manifest by the appearing of our savior jesus christ who hath abolished death amen god eldest to believe and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel whereunto i am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the gentiles for the which cause i also suffer these things nevertheless i am not ashamed for i know whom i have believed amen i am not ashamed for i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day amen god bless his word amen and i'll share with you another scripture which the proud of god as i said he didn't get into the scripture to read it until page 17 and he was highlighting some other things to them before he really got in to preach a message and again at the same time he said he would only preach for five minutes and uh but it was uh i believe an hour or more amen so his his time and his watch is not the same as ours i guess and maybe yours is not the same as mine amen so but again that's that's amen it's we're not when it comes to time we're governed by a calendar we're governed by a clock amen but that doesn't interfere with the lord amen he's not into the calendars he's not into the clocks amen why because he's eternal amen and god through all down through the ages through the messages and the messengers that he has sent to minister to the seed of god and the sons and daughters of god amen is to put us in contact with eternity amen by the grace of god amen to give us an experience so that we're not ashamed of what god has done we're not ashamed of what god is doing amen and not ashamed of what he will do amen we're amen and that's why we are here tonight because we're not ashamed there are those that would be ashamed they would feel down why having to leave this church leave that church to go away but not not identify with that with the with these other ministries amen that's all right there's so there's ministries out there for the foolish virgin but there's ministries for the wise virgin amen so god has given us the wisdom to know that it it's with it's his wisdom amen so be be there when you take heed to what you're hearing amen by the grace of god amen because what we need to hear is what god wants us to hear in this hour what god wants us to hear in this age in this day amen so brother and again because we consider what william branham and who he was amen and what god did for him through him for us amen we consider those things but we want to be in the present tense what god is doing now through the message amen brother unfortunately back in luther's day and wesley's day and the other ages amen the people considered what god did through luther what god did so wesley but they went on and went on until they made a made a denomination out of it and as i said it was the the prophet said the third or fourth generation that rose on the scene of every message that god brought on the earth and and especially in the in the gentile ages and he said after the third or fourth generation he said they became a denomination amen and so what did god do god had to move on to another messenger he had to move out of of the organized religion of that day amen amen because what god wanted to reveal to them that organized religion wouldn't allow amen they would they would fight it amen and brother again even in this hour in this age there are things that god's revealing to the bride making real to the bride concerning the message of the hour and we're moving on with the spiritual revelation of the word god did this right god and god is doing this amen because the first pull goes into the second and the second goes into the third amen god is blending one with the other until amen it comes to that place where we got the faith that pleases god amen don't just go back and say god did this i believe it i believe what he did what he did what he did and i uh uh oh yeah and oh i believe he's gonna do this but but to get us ready for what he's gonna do he's doing something now amen based on what he did he's doing amen based on what he did through william branham amen through the oatmeal of the word the mystery of god brother that's good we can look back and say yeah that's what he did that's what he did praise the lord thank you lord amen yeah but he wants you to get into what he did and he wants you to enter into it you become one with it amen and have understanding of what he did amen and you'll prove it by your faith amen not just faith in what he did but now that god is adding to that faith it gets bigger bigger greater greater faith got it now now we're into what god is doing amen and brother if you want to trace it back it'll go back to what god did in the ministry of a prophet what god did in the ministry of william branham amen in the opening of the seven seals by the grace of god and again the power of god as highlighted a number of times after the opening of the sails he said why does god do it did all this he said it's to give us rapturing faith amen why did god do what he did to luther to give them get the faith for justification amen oh yeah brother when it struck them they read scripture read scripture read it before and over and over again but still they were looking oh i got to do this to be justified i got to do that to be justified you don't have to do it it's done amen same with sanctification don't have to do it it's done amen and god had to bring those messengers on the scene that would catch the revelation of justification catch the revelation of sanctification amen the baptism of the holy ghost and the gifts of the spirit amen oh brother what was it it was god coming down god coming down and becoming more and more one with his seed his sons and daughters amen and and they were getting a greater and a greater and a greater faith amen and even there's there's many in the early generation of the pentecostals oh yeah they believed that the pentecostal message was going to take us on to the resurrection the rapture yeah but god was going to send a messenger with it amen to to go go beyond it as he said this message he said it is the climax of the pentecostal message amen he said that in 1965 and he realized he knew it amen and there are other believers that knew god did that in pentecost but now they knew that god was moving on not not leaving it wasn't brother we don't leave luther beyond we don't leave wesley behind we don't leave the pentecostals behind and and what they were preaching and teaching amen amen and the revival they're experiencing amen it was moving on to a greater and a greater and a greater revival until we will get the faith amen it's not just going on and say well i'm following the message messenger of the hour and believing the message of the hour yeah if you are amen what are you going to do the others kept going on go on go on but now we're looking up amen now it's not going on so now uh oh is there any other preacher is he in any other messenger oh surely god's going to send us another message another message nothing whether it comes to a place where you're going to hear the last message amen praise the name of the lord and not not and oh my if you've got the revelation of it you know it is the last message if you got the revelation of it you know amen that this is to give us what we're what god is looking for now resurrection rapture amen resurrection and rapturing faith but i i don't feel much of that faith being manifested i don't feel much of that faith being expressed amen brothers all grace to us as god brought israel out of egypt brother and he did this he did this he did that but now he sent them a messenger that was really going to bring them out amen or they could have this one i have that one no no way because any messenger any any any person rose up that might want to do this and might want to do that no they got against it but then god let them go on amen but then he sent the prophet amen with the revelation of the mystery of god concerning israel and you know when he said it because amen they right because god said i've heard the cries of my people i've come down to deliver them amen so there was there were those in israel the jews in egypt rather there were those there in egypt amen that were beginning to hunger and thirst for deliverance amen the oil because why because they knew by the word that god promised deliverance amen and we know by the word that god has promised a resurrection and a rapture amen he said we shall not all sleep good praise the lord amen but we shall all be changed amen the dead in christ shall rise first and we which our line remains shall be cut up together with them to meet the lord in the air god help us brother amen that i pray grace we're going to catch the revelation of the saints uh coming back to appear to us and the pro the power of god said they will appear to us and we'll and we'll see them and we'll we'll well amen brother in that hour we'll have that faith amen not emotion not sensation it's going to be faith amen god in simplicity it's faith it's something that god reveals and and and and the believer believes it amen others feel that god's got to do this god has got to do that you got to do this and then i'll believe i'll see this and i'll hear this and oh yeah i believe well brother god's going to do not what you think he got to do whatever god is going to do is in the word amen praise the name of the lord i tell you this it wasn't so much in luther or wesley or even the other other denominations that experienced revival back in those ages amen but and the pentecostals but the closer we got to the end the more more people were considering the resurrection considering the rapture oh we're getting close to the end now and they weren't focusing on that in luther's day in wesley's day in the old-fashioned salvation army day amen they just thought it was all up the road but not recognizing failing to nice amen what god was doing was leading to it amen and oh yeah we're getting close yeah look look look look what god has done now look what he's doing we must be getting closer to the resurrection we might be getting closer to rapture we ain't getting closer to go home to be with the lord amen and there was a generation of pentecostals an older generation brother they believed that oh they they believe what god did in the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit amen but it was causing them with a greater faith to look on for the resurrection then where's the end oh lord we thank you for the resurrect we thank you for the for the pentecostal preach preaching and ministry of the gifts of the spirit the baptism of the holy ghost we thank you lord amen pray grace lord that you'll give us a double portion and move us on to the resurrection amen so god had to give it give us a double a different yet a double portion amen of the anointing of the holy ghost but with every anointing of the spirit comes the revelation of the word amen there was it was the holy ghost that came to luther amen and struck luther and when he struck him he looked into the bible oh that's it oh praise the lord amen jesus justified me amen luther oh jesus sanctified us praise the lord amen and then on to the pentecostals was getting greater and greater and the more one with the lord more one with the word amen and god or they begin to realize oh yeah oh they didn't well they didn't really realize what god was doing amen in the prophets god was coming in flesh amen he was revealing himself more and more and more in flesh of the prophets this prophet this prophet this messenger that messenger unto finally the word was made flesh amen in the god prophet praise the lord and brother and in the church ages they were looking for this looking for that amen oh we need we need this we need that amen and god did it and god did it amen giving us a greater and a greater revelation amen brother and again there was a generation after after luther a generation that was seeking sanctification and after after wesley a generation amen god have put into their hearts a hunger and a thirst for more of the holy ghost more of the power of god and more of the anointing of the life of jesus in us amen oh they got the revelation of sanctification they got the revelation of the uh of the justification amen and and they were hungry and thirsting for more amen jose why pentecostal that was that was on right on the on the road where god was moving amen what for god wanted that's what god wanted them to do next amen he wanted to come down and get more and more and more control he wanted to come down and get more and more of into their lives amen so that truly it wasn't them living it was jesus living in them amen to finally there their rise is the brave and brother it's not er living is christ living in me and in you this is absolutely tremendous amen brother i pray grace god was revealing it to the jews god's revealing it to the gentiles amen the jews turned it down and and and god came to to the gentiles the gentiles for the most part the greater majority is going to turn it down and god's going back to the jews amen and he is absolutely tremendous even because any even concerning the the copen 19 issues that are going on around the world and brother going on in israel and uh just recently within the last couple of days we heard a news item concerning israel and concerning what the government of israel is doing and how they're doing it and the jews are doing this they're doing that and there's a no way it's as you can you compare it with the rest of the world that's what they said basically you can't compare with the rest of the world because there's nobody doing it like but what israel is doing amen the way that they were facing it the way that they were dealing with it amen amen and brother oh it shows that god was in control and god is in control i'll tell you this amen i might get you to maybe to get our brother matthew to bring it up on on the screen here sometime of uh again and i mention it just not long ago concerning this young man that went beyond the curtain of time in israel he was a jew amen now not all are going to believe him but i tell you there's 144 000 somewhere amen that are going to be there i'm going to believe by the grace of god oh yeah and so there's jewish rabbis there and they're interviewing him and they're asking him this question this question what do you see and what what did you hear did they did they say anything did they explain this and explain that and so on so they're trying to bring get him to bring out this witness and this testimony of the experience that he had beyond the curtain of time amen so brother i thank the lord for that amen and again it's a it's a saying to the to the gentile bride look up get out amen we're going amen don't be left behind amen so brother let's be on our guard and let us walk in the spirit and let us live in the spirit amen and not be ashamed of it amen don't be ashamed of the life that god is reflecting in you don't be ashamed of the life that god is is manifesting in us brother he manifested it in luther oh yeah and again and luther just preached it preached it preached it and in wesley as i said wesley preached five times a day amen and you know what five times on a sunday and a wednesday no five times a day and yeah and there were other times that wesley oh he gathered at a church and and there was two the crowd was too big to go into that church there was just too many people and so we'll see wesley would go walk walk from the church and into the cemetery because back in those days there was a church and a cemetery was next to the church amen and when wesley went went over to the cemetery and he found the the biggest stone there and he got up on the tombstone amen amen the headstone we call it amen and he started to preach amen oh yeah in a cemetery amen proving that the power of the resurrection was in within luther within wesley amen and he began to preach and preach and preach by the grace of almighty god amen and he wasn't putting the emphasis on the natural things of life he put the emphasis on the spiritual amen and that's why like i said the governments went and invested in and checked them out why because albany when he says when he filed his papers at the end of the year with the government and for the government and they saw oh my uh he's making a lot of money you know and what's he doing with it and so on and he wasn't he wasn't i don't know if he was paying much taxes or not but like he said and so they came and they were they were shocked even in the house he lived in amen sure why because he only had one of this and one of that and one of this one of that they said come on look all the money you got you can have all of this you can have this he said i don't need it i don't need it he said no and i used the money for the just for the gospel and and again that's why i don't have i don't have and he said well what do you got well when luther when martin now martin luther when john wesley died brother all he had was a few pennies and he spoke it that's all he had that's all he had they went around searching wondering where's his money to because he had all he gave it out to the ministry here give it out to the ministry there give it out here give it out there amen and they say this is all he got they said that's all he got amen they're amazed not many are going to do it god help us brother concerning concerning you know these things oh my that we're not going to put the emphasis on the natural things of life but the spiritual and if god wants to bless us with more and more of the natural things but that's fine we'll let god do that and we'll give god the glory amen but we're not going to hunger and thirst for it amen no no lord your will not mine amen so the grace of god be with us and brother amen if god was looking for that anger and that thirst and that and that for for justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit notice that hunger and thirst increased with every age amen and not just increase but it involved more and more of the world amen because until pentecost it went around the world amen and they were shocked that the pentecostal revival had such an influence around the world yeah they said what what's going on the pentecost was here pentecost was there pentagon somewhere else the people were worshiping god praising god amen the anointing and baptism of the holy ghost amen but brother that wasn't the end that was amen that was just a testimony that god was moving and moving moving on with a greater anointing and a greater revelation brother in in in the lives of his his sons and daughters amen and again lord brother understand again we won't get into all that but again that there was just true seed of god that would be part of the bride of christ but then there are also others that are just believers they're called but not chosen amen many are called amen well if god if god wasn't interested in them he wouldn't have called them amen many are called few are chosen amen so god and what they with all that he called became a witness to the world amen but the few that was chosen was a witness to jesus that they had the faith that created that please god amen and faith was growing amen by the grace of god brother again went on to faith faith faith until really when they when the pentecostal revival went around the world they thought well oh we're going to the resurrection now we're going to the rapture this is what god's going to bring it on amen but no there was another message the revelation of the mystery of god amen that would give us resurrection rapturing faith amen what would it do it would let us know what god was doing and how god was doing it amen that's why that's why pentecost needed to know amen well the world in general the seed of god needed to know about justification they needed to know about sanctification and they needed to know until another generation rose up they needed to know about the baptism of the holy ghost and the gifts of the spirit amen and finally there was a generation that would rise that would need to know about the resurrection and the rapture amen because god threw that generation was going to bring into manifestation the resurrection and the rapture amen not through pentecost not true wesley not true and not true the others amen but it was going to come to another revival a bride revival amen oh yeah that's that's the lutherans that's the methodist and that's the pentecostals amen and we're not the brahmites no no we're the christians amen we're the bride amen you want bright eyes what do we want to call it amen we're the bride of christ amen and brother god brings the separation of the believer and make believer amen the grace of god god help us brother amen that will god is good amen that what what's going on in our lives in your life in my life amen is a testimony that we are the seed of god and that we are the brain predestinated to the resurrection and rapture amen because god has and god is quickening to us the message of the hour the mystery of god for this age pentecost said the mystery that's just that mystery but it they never they never received the mystery of resurrection and rapture amen that was for another generation amen that would climax all that god has done down through the church ages to god be the glory amen but brother and anything that god done anything god wanted to do and is doing amen there is a seed amen that he's going to call out and i tell you they won't be ashamed of what god's doing amen they won't be ashamed of what god has done and what god is doing in their generation their age they're going to recognize it and recognize themselves as seed of god by the grace of god amen that we're not this church or that church and oh we're under this ministry and that ministry no we're under the ministry of the holy ghost we are the seed of god the sons and daughters of god by the amen and going beyond sons and daughters we're the bride of christ amen brother you can you can believe yourself i'm the son of god i'm a daughter of god amen yeah are you bright oh i don't know about that well the bride is called to the mystery of god amen and she is not ashamed of what god's done and she's not ashamed of what he's doing and she's certainly not ashamed of what he's going to do amen so the father god was bringing these things in and he was highlighting oh he said this one is a shame that one is ashamed of this amen and they don't want to get involved with this don't want to get involved with that amen but he said we find out through the word that what god was doing god did this and god did that and he said the seed of god was not ashamed of it amen they wanted to be identified with god identify with his word identify with what he was doing amen and they would be the witness of god the testimony of god hallelujah what god was doing well you you don't see what god's doing uh well what about this this this group over there what was this these individuals are no they're fanatics that's what god is doing judge them by the word of god oh well they they believe this and they believe that and then that's why many many a person around the world would feel that we are fanatical and we are false because we believe this because we believe that yeah oh yeah they want us to identify with a denomination they want to identify with a church or this or that no oh they won't get involved with that they say you know so they're they're just religious no we're spiritual they are religious amen god has called us out of religion to be spiritual by the grace of god amen so we're not going to come under the control of a religious spirit only but spiritual amen and again his message was ashamed and he preached it july the 11th 1963 amen so i want to share with you and believe that the lord has already anointed and and brought forth some spiritual revelation amen but i want to share with you some of the thoughts that he was bringing forth in this message and again to consider that he was preaching it in branham tabernacle amen and we consider the things that he was saying again i believe it it applied to some of those that were attending ram tabernacle but it applied to i believe certain individuals all the way down through because the prophet of god been gone for 56 years amen or he preached this in july 65 and in july of this year that it will be 56 years amen and that that's a whole the prophet was when god took him off the scene he was 56 years old and now in in may month of this year it will be 56 years since he's been gone amen so i pray grace that god will help us to keep looking up amen that will not doubt what god has done we'll believe what god has done amen and believe what god is doing amen where is god god is in his bride what's he doing well look as you find the brain you see what he's doing in the bride amen now i tell you there's going to be humility amen the bride's going to be humble but the bride's going to be spiritual amen it's not me that lives as christ that liveth in me amen is god in control of your house is god in control of your home is god in control of your family by the grace of god amen amen and we commit ourselves to god every day lord we're in your hands we pray for your anointing we pray for your life amen lord that you have control soul body and spirit amen amen and you're pleading the token life of the blood of our lord jesus christ for yourself and your family amen and for your brothers and sisters in christ amen brother god god wants us to do that plead the token amen but plead the token knowing what the token is by the grace of god amen and knowing that all that my i need this my wife needs this my husband needs this amen my sons and daughters need this lord in the name of jesus i plead the token life of the blood of jesus amen for this one and for that one amen you do it by faith absolutely aware absolutely with a revelation that they need it and that you need it don't just assume we're just assuming well i got it thank you lord thank you lord i thank you but i pray for a greater anointing amen i believe lord i got the anointing the token life of the blood of jesus yes lord but i need more of it now amen i need more of the anointing so that i'm going to be more and more spiritual amen less and less religious but more and more spiritual and in love with him by the grace of god oh yeah and recognizing what he's doing in you amen when you look into the mirror see god in flesh that's tremendous amen but it's god in simplicity amen oh you mean say me god is in me yeah you look in look into the mirror on a sinner say by grace yeah that's right but but he's put his life in you to save you amen by grace amen anything we recognize is grace on meredith favor i thank you for what you've done lord i thank you for what you're doing i know lord i'm not worthy of it but i'm so glad lord that you provided the sacrifice that we needed our lord jesus christ amen and through christ he makes us worthy amen not our works it's his work to the glory of god amen so brother brown in in the beginning of this message right here because he goes to the first 17 pages before he gets into the preaching a sermon and he's just this is uh oh my let me see yeah they said it's in branham tabernacle jeffersonville indiana and uh he just gets uh oh yes what it was was that he had come back from us having meetings elsewhere and he went into branham tabernacle and of course uh when brother lee vale saw him come in level closed his notes and oh he said brother brown was going to go to the minister for us amen not that brother brown wanted to but usually when brother brown would come back to jeffersonville brother leville always wanted him to minister and brother vale would step down and turn the pulpit over to brother branham and this basically is what he did in july of 1965 after he had returned from somewhere else amen answer brother brown got up and he began to just exhort the people and and talk to them about the lord and the things that god has done and things that god was doing amen and to remind them of the different things and again halfway through this message he got into it preached the word and he went on with it with with a scripture that we've already read and in this book he said i want every day of my life to count for him amen do we have the same desire that we want every day of our lives to count for him and what i have left what time i have i want to spend it somewhere doing something if it's no more than stand on a street corner testifying to the glory and honor of god and i am here for that purpose amen but he lived his life always in the spirit amen he was ready that according to the leadership of the holy ghost if god wanted him to do this if god wanted him to do that he was going to do it it was it was just to be a witness to this one a witness to that one amen concerning what god was doing brother branham wanted to be in the spirit amen ready to be a witness and brother i'm sure even if it was a place that he worked amen one time that he even among his the the workers that was he was working with he wanted to be a witness but he was waiting on the lord to open up the way you don't you don't do it without his leadership amen no no so he said i want every day of my life to account for him and he said what i have left what time i have i want to spend it somewhere doing something and if it's no more than stand on a street corner he said testifying to the glory and honor of god he said i am here for that purpose amen what purpose are we here for i pray grace that no matter what your work is what your job is amen that you give him the preeminence amen exactly again as i said no matter what i worked for and where i worked amen i never left the lord outside amen i wanted to do it in the spirit not the spirit of the of the other workers but the spirit of the lord wanted to be in control the holy ghost in control amen as i said you know one time i worked somewhere and somebody come out and wanted this done that done and they said there's only one to do it they said give it to gerald to do and they said but don't don't give him anybody to help him he says he don't need it and they'll say they'll get in his way and there was many there in that area where i was working and so i had to go do it and just to and they said he'll do it don't worry about it amen and that was the the person that said that he was he was the manager and not only that he was you i was working with the military then and he was also a higher rank soldier there so he said that's it i i was well thank the lord i said grace lord it's your grace eyes amen i said that they're having that confidence it's not me it's you amen no matter what it was i was giving the glory to god thank you jesus amen that you give me that reputation among the people so that i can help them amen by the grace of almighty god so he said i want every day of my life to count for him and what i have left what time i have i want to spend it somewhere doing something and it is no more than on a street corner testifying to the glory and honor of god he said i am heir for that purpose and we're here for that purpose to be a witness oh yeah amen and then maybe your witness is going to be the life you live sometimes it's not what you say when it comes to well you get it is if your conversation it's going to be like this and like that and you're not going to be like the world out there no not by any means but basically the life you live it's going to reflect jesus the life you live is going to reflect your faith in the resurrection your faith in the rapture by the grace of god amen and he said i have got a little secret place up here at greens mill and what is that secret place it was his cave amen and brother george smith and sister rebecca they found it they went looking for it and seemed like nobody else knew where it was so they knew it was in the area of greens mill indiana and they knew that somewhere going to the cave because brother brown had mentioned it that he had to walk over some water some rocks in the water and step over and step over and get to the other side because it was on the other side was the cave somewhere yeah so they went and they did this brother george and brought sister rebecca and brother george's son it might have been william amen the individual that's in the in in in tennessee now amen with his sister angela amen so they they found that they found the cave amen and brother george did issue a monthly newsletter like and with pictures and they have pictures of the cave picture of they want their sun going down into the cave they took pictures they went down into the cave and took pictures of the place where brother banham would sit down amen oh yes it's right he said it's in the cave there was there was a section there that he could go in and they could sit down and he said the there and right in front of him was a flat area like a table oh yeah that's an and and then in the article they printed that picture's there yeah you you you get into the cave get down you got to get down then walk into the cave and then and it's just like a just like a hallway we call it amen so you walk up this hallway amen i don't know how many feet and there was a clear section right there and then you turned to your left oh there was it was the seat that he was set on and now to see it was just the way the stones were made there god ordained it for his prophet amen and he would go in and he could sit sit get him between the table and the seat amen there was the table shaped like a table and there was the seat right here and he could sit there and above the table was the was the rock pointing down and it was like a pyramid oh yeah then and there there are pictures of of that pyramid amen coming down pointing down and brother brown would sit there and he would study amen or sometimes he would get notes amen and it was when he was there that he looked and there was the angel the angel came down amen into the cave and and yeah told him that he had to go and do this this and this and this amen brother but now of course george remember they took pictures of it published it but now what they did once they once they were finished with it they went out and they just covered everything up so that nobody would recognize the cave so i know but joseph knows where it is and no doubt his family knows where it is but that's it now so brother you know be nice if we could go there and go into the cave but again brother it's not it's not believing the cave is believing the angel of god that came down and ministered to a prophet amen and there's where where brother brown came in contact with god in contact with the angels amen who told him that he had to do this and he had to do that and so on thank god amen and that was at greens mill and he said indiana and it's not a city it's a wilderness and some people have taken it over and don't even let you set a foot on it but i got a cave there that he would never find me when i got into it amen he said i go at night time and he'll never know when i go in or come out and he don't know where the cave is and he couldn't get it no matter where it was amen i want to go over and talk to the lord he said while i feel that it's a necessity amen god has somewhere for the prophet to go totally cut off from the world amen so that he could meet with the with the angels amen and with the lord amen praise the name of the lord and he said when you get to a spot and he said you're so smart that you know everything then god can't do nothing with you but it's if you get to a place that you're willing to listen and learn amen same with the preaching of the word you've got to listen and learn amen it's not listening and say oh yeah thank the lord thank you lord for the ministry of the word the preaching the sermon it's a sermon no it's revelation more than a sermon it's god communicating with you by faith god communicating with us here and those online by faith amen praise the lord amen and your your your hungry for your thirsting for it amen you're responding to the holy ghost he creates the hunger he creates the thirst and there he is satisfying it responding amen he responds to the hunger and thirst that he gives you praise the name of the lord wonderful amen so he said he said but if you get to a place that you're willing to listen and learn he said then it's god's time can move in and talk to you amen so if your attitude is right your spirit is right even here tonight amen oh yeah if your spirit nature is right your hunger thirst is right then god can talk to you amen oh yeah god can speak to you amen through the ministry of the word this will strike you and that'll strike you oh okay okay lord amen lord i believe it i believe i thank you for it lord amen amen it's not you're not i lighting the ministry it's highlighting god amen oh yeah basically you you're what amen we got to recognize and amen that it's not a man it's god amen and brother if we come here and we just looking looking for a man to do this for a man to do that he's going to talk he's going to talk no no no no we got to we got to recognize that this is god amen this is god's pattern this is god's ways is it because i have set in the church this ministry for the perfecting the ministry and to to do this for the for the people for the believers we're going to do this do this do this amen he's going to feed you for this he's going to feed you for that amen if the word's going forth and you're receiving the word with the right attitude and the right spirit amen oh god's going to produce and that word in you if your attitude is right your appearance right amen oh praise the lord if that's what you're feeding on amen i'll tell you this in the natural if you feed on this or feed on that people are going to see you oh i wonder what they're eating what they're feeding on and sometimes you you see a certain see see them in a certain way and you see certain things in that person's life or in that person's body you say well they must be eating a lot of this or they're eating a lot of that and so on oh that's the natural source of spiritual amen the natural is going to reveal itself in your flesh amen amen and i hear the spiritual is going to reveal itself in your soul spirit and your flesh amen got to come out of the soul into the spirit amen and then it reveals god revealing himself through you by grace amen so god help us to be spiritual amen in our souls people got this religion in their flesh they got it in their heads and to a certain extent it could control their spirit but it's not out of the soul amen that's why the prophet of god says you can have the holy ghost in your flesh he said he said 24 hours a day and go to hell well that's true amen because i tell you it's christ in us in our souls is that what humbles us amen so he said remember at the day of judgment let them bony hands reach out of the smoke condemn you he said their blood will be upon you not on me because i have tried for about 10 years to get back amen and he said i told my wife and i told brother wood when i got here and some friends that i met yesterday he said i have had about five years here that i hardly know what to do and he said it's been a nervous time and he said see the revival itself amongst the churches and he said the revival died amen everyone knows that and you feel it in this tabernacle oh branham tabernacle the revival was gone the revival was dead amen he said you feel it in this tabernacle amen and you feel it everywhere and he said there is a thump dead feeling and there is just something isn't right it's because the revival enthusiasm he said has gone away from the people amen the revival enthusiasm has gone away from a lot of believers amen what the anointing that was there when they first come to the word and the message oh no as i said when i when i ministered or even did a song service in in the lifetime of accomplishment or false oh my in the early days of the message there was worship and there was praise in the lord dancing in the spirit amen now nothing of course the church is gone but even and not only that most of the believers out there now are they're gone from a crowd back to a dozen but in central yeah amazing because of the things that have happened during the last little while yeah it's down down down down amen grace of god yeah and we know that uh a few of them are supporting here now you know by the grace of god amen god of us amen and god keep us humble and sincere amen and he said there is just something isn't right it's because the revival enthusiasm has gone away from the people amen go into churches and you'll see them sitting there and the pastor is stumbling around for a message and something another and the first thing you know he turned it off on some kind of a party that they're going to have it seems to be a dead thump everywhere what would if the prophet of god said that in 1965 what would he say today yes it's a dead thought almost everywhere amen and he said listen billy graham noticed it he did oral roberts noticed it and he said hey alan he said he got into trouble i remember that because we used to get a allen's magazine every month amen and if you were to go to tucson and you would go from is it phoenix where brother green is was in tucson tucson okay yeah tucson that's right and he would go you leave tucson and uh we go on to the main highway and we we drive i've done it and we drive a little further west yeah going to further west and uh and then on on your right side just drive for maybe a few minutes and then you turn on your right side and you look down and you see some buildings and it used to be a a allen headquarters hey allen's church yeah and that's where thousands of people would meet there under the ministry of a.a alum yeah but now it's all closed yeah and knowing that what about our myself and other brothers and sisters in in gamble uh it was middle brook really and uh including brother sister burns and others there amen that we were supporting brother allen a allen's ministry amen or we know that he had these problems this problem that problem oh yeah and eventually everything fell yeah but he did he ministered in canada he ministered around probably around the world and some of the believers from newfoundland did go to his meetings in ontario when he ministered there yeah and god did this and god did that so they they appreciated it amen so the grace of god regarding brother allen oh yeah and brother he said brother graham brother billy graham knows what the dead thump because billy graham said he said listen he said paul could go to a certain place and he'd get 30 maybe 30 or 300 uh believers he'd go back in the next year and he would have 3 000. yeah and he said i could go billy graham and or robert's rather he said i could go to a place and get 3 000 believers when i go back he said i might get 30. yeah he said because it says the world we're living in and they're not having they're not they're coming and responding to his altar call but in their heads but not in their heart amen because they weren't they never had never had the new birth born again experience you got to be born before the prophet god brings it out you see you've got to be born again amen and the new birth is not in your flesh it's in your soul amen you're a new creature from the inside out amen whereas before you were born again you you thought like this you acted like this you talked like this amen you're hungry and thirsty for these things of the world amen but when you're born again it's all change oh i'm not interested in that the devil's there to try to get you interested in this and this no i'm not interested in that now yeah i think i was interested one time but not anymore i'm a new creature i'm born again amen and now you've got the nature of god not the devil amen and he said billy graham notices it that the dead thunk and he said oral roberts and mr allen he said he got some trouble and he said oh yeah he said oral roberts has got that 50 million dollar buildings and he said he's got a school and will nobody on the field now and he said i left here by a vision to go yonder to tucson and to see what the lord wanted me to do and there he met me up there and he told you here and he would do it he said in the form of seven angels said to return back and the seven seals would be open amen that's exactly what happened amen and he said one day with brother wood when he come here he went to the same place and thr throw up a rock it came down and he said within a day or night and he says some i forget just what the words was he said you're going to see the glory of god and the next day a whirlwind came down out of the skies amen and we know the story of what took place and he said when it went up and they asked what it was and i said it spoke these words in three great blasts and the men only heard the blasting but i understood the words and said judgment is striking the west coast amen he's bringing evidence again in again july of 65 before the lord took him home amen he's reminding the people and warning the people concerning the judgment on the west coast of america and he said two days after that he said alaska like to have sunk and it's been thundering around earthquakes everything just look at them every day earthquakes just shaking everywhere amen i can remember that those earthquakes but and i didn't even know the message i didn't know about william branham but i knew with that what was going on in the world amen and he said my last meeting that i had will be my first message ready to preach since then and i was preaching he said in los angeles at the biltmore auditorium and i was speaking on a man choosing himself a wife and you probably got the tape of it and it says it reflects his character and his ambitions amen in the april the 29th 1965 this was july but in april brother brown preached the message choosing the bride amen and he also emphasized what was going to happen in california amen and he said again he looks for character a man choosing a a woman looks for character in a woman because he is planning a future home with that woman and he plans he gets a homemaker and said then they said christ according to his word ear tell us what our future home will be what kind of a wife will he choose then a denominational prostitute never he said will he choose then a denominational prostitute never he shall eat he'll choose a woman that's characterized by his word and that will be his pride the bride is focusing on the word amen the bride pushes the emphasis on the word it thinks the word talks the word amen it is believing the word oh yeah we're just living for the word and really it's the word in us living and reflecting christ well the word morning noon and night the word you can't get away from it no it's a living word it's not it's not a creed it's not just dead doctrines amen it's the living word revealed and being revealed in you amen every day we live more and more the word amen the word is coming more and more flesh and more and more in control till finally it takes us to the resurrection and rapture amen praise the lord he said and a while in there something struck me and i didn't know nothing about 30 mi 30 minutes and he said there was a prophecy went out and the first thing i remember brother mosley and billy which calls yourself by the name of the angels and he said that's los angeles city of angels see the angels which are exalted into heaven will be brought down into hell amen for if the mighty works have been done in sodom that have been done in you it would have been standing till this day amen and he said i now i just got through exhorting christ exalting him and telling the church i said you women no matter how i try to come to you preach against these things and you man you preachers you constantly he said conned all the time do i just do it just the same you walk over it as if the word of god was nothing yeah the prophet would preach this and prophesy this prophesy that and they just yeah they hear it and go on but it doesn't control them it doesn't get their attention of what god is doing amen anything god anything god is trying to do no brother i pray grace in your life amen in this assembly among believers brother whatever he's doing he wants to get our attention amen brother i tell you this he had he had to have the attention of the jews to get him out of egypt amen he wanted their attention to get them into the promised land but they didn't do what they would they wouldn't give him their attention amen joshua and caleb was seeking and seeking and seeking to get their attention amen point them to the promised land if god be with us who can be against us amen caleb knew that even his old age he believed amen amen do we have the same ongoing thirst for the resurrection rapture as as brother branham did amen he knew and yet he also knew eventually the lord revealed to him that he would go before the resurrection amen grace but he said one day he said they'll arise on the earth and he said some woman some man he said might be some boy some girl raised their hands and said lord i'm coming home and he said the rapture is gone and we've been in inspired concerning the resurrection are we inspired concerning the rapture concerning what god is doing in the bride or you're not going to see much out there but i tell you this there's gonna be a stirring in the bride in your heart in your soul amen amen and what's god doing he's laying in laying in laying in the word amen so when the hour comes you're gonna hunger and thirst for it amen when the hour comes you're going to speak the word why cry speak for the rapture and the resurrection and he said again you women no matter he said how i try to come to you or preach against these things and you man you preachers constantly conned all the time and you do it just the same you walk over it as if the word of god was nothing that's why they're going to miss the rapture they're going to miss the resurrection amen why because they're not taking it serious concerning what god has done to give us the resurrection and rapturing faith amen what to make to make the resurrection of rapture more real to us amen i tell you for centuries and for centuries they believed it believed it look for it look looking toward it looking toward it not not realizing in their hour but lord we know that ours coming here giving us the word now you know you're going to get us ready to die ready to lay our lives down but lord during the resurrection we'll come forth for the for the dead in christ will rise first and we which are lying remains shall be cut up together with them to meet the lord in the air amen sir brother god god gave them the revelation of the resurrection they would lay down they believed they were going to lay down their lives but they're going to be resurrected amen but there's a generation rising brother that we're not looking we laid out our lives for jesus amen not that not to be put into a grave not been put into the cemetery no we laid in our lives physically in this world and give jesus control for the resurrection lord i'm waiting for the resurrection i'm looking for the resurrection lord you're giving me more to this word thank you for the word lord we're in that you have given us resurrection faith amen faith for the resurrection faith for the rapture thank you jesus amen we're looking up lord we know that the dead in christ shall rise first amen but then we're going to be raised and changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye god help us the twinkling of an eye that's a split second yeah split second that somebody's going to strike you and brother you won't be able to get away from that that get away from it but the revelation or the driver you could sense it in the atmosphere sense it in your soul in your body what's going on lord the lord yes lord we're believing for the resurrection we're coming lord amen praise the lord and we go out of time into eternity amen amen and he talked about preaching he talked about california again of course los angeles and he said los angeles will be in the bottom of the sea amen and i come home and went to africa and while i was in africa they had an earthquake amen oh yeah and knowing that he highlights here about scientists that were there at the time and in in in america they're they're saying oh yeah yeah california's going down they said because we we voted with their studies and everything and what they've done investigating everything they said we know that california is going to got to go down yeah he said this has already happened underneath and he said this this earthquake and that earthquake another one and he says just getting to the place where calif it's gonna break and fall into the ocean god have mercy amen god have mercy he said oh we're at the end time a glorious hour the appearing of the lord jesus and he said he said there shall be earthquakes in diverse places perplexity of time distress among nations oh yeah the whole world now is distressed over cobit 19. amen brother it should really put the bride on our toes now oh lord was this possible is this possible for all the nations to get together like this like this oh yeah so god proved it amen look up nations are breaking israel's awakening and the signs of the prophets foretold the gentile days are numbered and with horrors encumbered return o disperse to your own amen because the day of redemption is near man's hearts are failing for fear be filled with god's spirit have your lambs trimmed and clear look up your redemption is near amen he said you see the picture the other day how he turned that picture sideways sideways and he said that very picture of those seven angels being lifted up and turned it to the right hand side and there is the face of the lord jesus looking down to earth again amen you know it amen looking up and looking up amen and he said there is the picture and of course there he said there's this here with seven angels and knowing that someone has highlighted the fact that right here is brother branham but you can only see a part of his head yeah yeah but it's right there god help us amen brother these are and again these are miracles that the science got no explanation for yeah they well is this this no no no he said we got no we can't explain it we don't know because it's because of how high it was and they said well nothing can be up there to make a cloud no and they said it might have been a plane or a jet going through and they checked they said no no jets went through so he said we don't know what it is or what happened they're seeing this you and i are seeing this and then the prophet said there he is and he said it is the face of the lord jesus looking down to earth again amen and you remember when i preached the seven church ages and i couldn't understand why jesus standing there with a white o yeah with a white over his head he was a young man i took it back to the bible and it said he came to the ancient of days whose hair was white as wool amen see again science got no explanation for any of this definitely none for that as i said that even in the and someone else has highlighted it even in the white house now that that those pictures are in a drawer up there and as i said again there was a previous president of the united states and when he was the president and he was in a in an office there somewhere and he was signing a a paper and he was like on this side of the table he was signed the paper and i noticed on the wall was william branham with the pillar of fire i said what in the world is that doing there yeah and you know it was this picture right here but it was huge yeah amen the world without not without a witness that's right no this has gone around the world these pictures they were in life magazine and they're also the another world magazine what was it anybody know it like i think it was in life magazine but there was another one and uh and it's still the mannequin still out there and it goes around the world i can't remember this hey could be something like the newsman but it's uh and i always we always thought of it as a scientific national geographic yeah and it made that national magazine it it had the it had the pictures there oh yeah they had the pictures too showing something miraculous and they had no explanation for it amazing that in in the life magazine they had they had this picture amazing if you open the open and see that picture when you open the other side there's a picture of a rainbow at midnight somewhere in the states oh yeah the rainbow midnight and of course they just put it there for that page and but i think it was the lord that ordained them to put to put this one on the other page oh yeah by the grace of god rainbow at midnight because that was the hour that it was all done whereas we're close why we're going beyond midnight amen and going to eternity amen so he said i was started i went up there and started on that first church age and he said there the holy spirit revealed it now i see you've got it right on your church ages i guess the books will be out pretty soon and he said it showed that jesus was judged what showed he was judged the white the white because revelation shows him his air was as white as snow in revelation chapter one or two his ear was at what the one that john saw coming down and he stood before him and he fell down before him and he said his hair was as white as snow amen praise the lord amen as i said to the brother that went to califor florida uh for a vacation oh he said it's wonderful here he said there's no snow oh i said you need snow he said because because i said the bible says his air was as white as snow and it talks about snow for this the snow for that so i said if you don't have snow you won't know what it means so i said you got to have snow oh you agreed yeah so when he came back of course there was snow amen so thank god brother there's a reason for it amen so he went on to talk about that concerning them angels the message the breaking of them seven seals and so on and it says he was god the father in one act god the son and another act and he said then god the holy ghost in this act and he said there he is his word is still supreme and we are living in the last days amen amen i got to finish amen pray the grace of god that those at home were not asleep amen and he said again standing up the other day they built us a new home and he's up there and brother mosley come down and was talking about it and he said oh that's just a little gift from my father and he started crying and i said you see he said if you will leave your homes leave your houses leave your lands fathers mothers i'll give you houses and lands and fathers and mothers a hundredfold in this life amen the an eternal life to come and he said i had to leave the tabernacle that i love so dearly my home that the lord gave me up there and had to leave it he just gave me this one back amen and he started crying and i and i said i had to come out here and separate myself he said come to this desert amen and it's not only a desert is it ought but it's a spiritual desert oh my there is no spiritual life at all in churches and he said why you've never seen such in your life we don't even have a church to go to nothing and he said the people are almost perished spiritually i notice it in the people that come out there and see the differences in them watching it amen so you stay under the spirit of god and your life becomes sweeter and tender like waters he said brings this grass and he said in arizona it would grow and he said these trees would be cactus and them leaves just wind up and make stickery and he said that's the way it is when you get dried around the church everybody is sticking one another and he said see you've got to have soft waters of rain soften you up amen and make leaves and shade for the pilgrim that passes by amen amen i just finished with another quote grace amen he said your bible now listen to listen to me and let me say this let me say don't do this it's a good thing and he said lord it used to be when a dreamer dreamed the dream and they took it down to the urum of thummim and told it and he said if the urum of them flashed the lights back is it a supernatural light the dream was true and i said but the priesthood and that uramutham is done away with and your bible is the urum of thumb now amen right amen and he said lord i may never do this again but i've asked you and prayed to you to give me a vision speak to me about what i am dreaming why i'm dreaming these dreams amen i said surely there is something in this word of god from genesis to revelation that some character in there that you dealt with would be the same basis that would be my question if somebody done something and you got after him about it then let me turn to that place in the bible and if somebody whatever they done it'll lean my way let me see some character in the bible like that and i close my eyes and just let the bible fall open and i put my finger on the scripture genesis 24 7. eliza abraham's faithful servant the model servant of the bible amen being sent to hunt the bride for isaac chills run over me amen and that's right with the rest of the message pulling out the bride amen as he was sent to get a bride for isaac so brother branham was sent to get a bride for the for the lord jesus christ to call out that bride amen he said yeah pull out the bride praise the lord and he said what if the woman won't come with me he said then you are free from this oath amen just a perfect message back to the word go get the bride that's a duty and that's what i'm here for and that's what i'm trying to do to call out a bride amen amen to bring the bride to that place where she is not ashamed of the gospel not ashamed of the calling not ashamed of the experience that god has given and is giving us amen for the resurrection and the rapture grace grace grace in the name of jesus god bless you oh i was going to say let's stand so we're going to sing 4 415. 415 and it's the old
