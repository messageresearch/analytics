[56:31] 1 Ephesians chapter
[56:34] 1 amen isn't God
[56:38] good amen certainly enjoy the specials
[56:42] this morning each one I know the time
[56:44] and effort that goes in and my wife and
[56:47] daughter would say we're going out to
[56:49] practice and they come back two hours
[56:50] later and these things don't just happen
[56:53] because people want to do it it happens
[56:54] because they put in the time
[56:57] but sister Nikki I noticed that's a
[56:59] rather large book that you have
[57:01] there and I think we've heard three out
[57:04] of it amen I want to encourage sister
[57:07] Nikki to sing some more of the songs in
[57:09] that book that she has amen what a
[57:11] wonderful thing each one each one sing
[57:14] as you're LED it's not a pressure it's
[57:16] not a pressure amen but I believe if the
[57:18] spirit of God quickens you to sing
[57:20] something it ought to it ought to be in
[57:21] our hearts to do whatever he would ask
[57:23] us to do amen that was wonderful each
[57:25] one amen God bless you it's good to see
[57:28] sister AA Baker with us this morning
[57:30] sitting back there in the corner God
[57:32] bless you Sister anden it's good to have
[57:34] her with us want to just announce there
[57:36] will be no service on Wednesday um the
[57:39] vast majority of the church or at least
[57:41] a portion of each of the most of the
[57:42] families in the church will be in
[57:44] central newfinland for the funeral of
[57:46] brother Ivan Brenton and we've been
[57:48] asked to take part in that in a number
[57:49] of different ways so we're just uh I
[57:52] think for the sake of Simplicity we'll
[57:53] cancel Wednesday night service and we'll
[57:55] meet up again on Sunday Lord willing but
[57:58] just keep remembering them in prayer and
[58:00] brother Luke Gibson's flying in on

[58:09] praying God to be with us be with the
[58:11] families the relatives each one that God
[58:13] will just Comfort them amen amen it's
[58:15] good to be here this morning it's good
[58:17] to see the sun shining good to remember
[58:19] we serve a resurrected Christ amen and
[58:21] we're going to talk about that this
[58:22] morning in Ephesians chapter
[58:25] 1 because what we don't want is a
[58:27] resurrected Christ of just 2,000 years
[58:30] ago we're not looking at a God we're not
[58:33] looking at a man of 2,000 years ago but
[58:36] we want to see where he is today and we
[58:37] want to see what he's done for us in its
[58:39] fullness and we only scratched the
[58:41] service surface in each of these
[58:43] Services I know and I left 20 odd pages
[58:46] of notes back home that untouched and
[58:48] just trying to to catch what the Lord
[58:50] would have this morning but amen let's
[58:52] see what he has for us this morning and
[58:54] and take it as our own Ephesians 1 this
[58:57] is our this is our book of Victory this
[58:59] is our our inheritance book it says
[59:02] blessed be the God and father of our
[59:04] Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us
[59:07] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[59:10] places in Christ you've got to be in
[59:11] Christ to have the blessings amen he
[59:14] says according as Heath chosen Us in him
[59:18] before the foundation of the world that
[59:20] we should be holy and Without Blame
[59:22] before him in love having predestinated
[59:25] us unto the adoption of children by
[59:27] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[59:30] good pleasure of his will to the praise
[59:32] of the glory of his grace wherein he ha
[59:35] made us accepted in the Beloved in whom
[59:39] we have Redemption through his blood the
[59:41] Forgiveness of sins according to the
[59:44] riches of his grace amen God bless you
[59:47] you can have your seats this morning and
[59:50] last Service uh we started this this
[59:53] little miniseries on the full atonement
[59:55] and I want to take a subtitle this
[59:57] morning of perfection restored and last
[59:59] service I opened up with the scriptures
[1:00:01] and the quote where it said that God
[1:00:03] requires Perfection to stand in his
[1:00:06] presence to be in relationship with him
[1:00:08] and we looked at what that looked like
[1:00:10] in the Garden of Eden and perfection in
[1:00:11] the Garden of Eden was a perfect people
[1:00:14] in a perfect world under a perfect world
[1:00:16] under a perfect word they lived in that
[1:00:18] Perfection because they stayed with the
[1:00:20] word of God they stayed in relationship
[1:00:22] they stayed close to God and when they
[1:00:24] stepped away from that relation ship
[1:00:26] when they stepped away from that word
[1:00:28] then Perfection vanished and death came
[1:00:30] in and sin came in and these different
[1:00:32] things amen but when they sinned
[1:00:33] Perfection was lost Perfection was lost
[1:00:36] and God could not be with us anymore
[1:00:38] amen and they were banished from the
[1:00:40] presence of
[1:00:41] God and then it was death to try and
[1:00:44] enter into the presence of God there was
[1:00:45] a there was a cherums with a flaming
[1:00:47] sword that was holding them back and
[1:00:49] that was that was showing the law it was
[1:00:51] the righteous justice of God that was
[1:00:52] holding us back from his presence but we
[1:00:55] needed to get back into his presence
[1:00:57] that's why we die is because we're out
[1:00:58] of his presence amen and we're trying to
[1:01:01] get back into it and then Jesus would
[1:01:03] come along they had years thousands of
[1:01:05] years of the law and and the sacrifice
[1:01:07] of lambs and bulls and goats and all
[1:01:10] these different things and and
[1:01:12] Perfection was never found even in those
[1:01:14] that were were so close yet Perfection
[1:01:16] was not found in them and then Jesus
[1:01:18] would come thousands of years later and
[1:01:21] he would drop this on us and he would
[1:01:23] say be ye therefore perfect
[1:01:26] after thousands of years of nobody
[1:01:29] meeting God's requirement Jesus would
[1:01:32] come and say be ye therefore
[1:01:36] perfect and not only just perfect he
[1:01:38] would say even as your father which is
[1:01:41] in heaven is perfect so if it wasn't
[1:01:44] just pressure to be perfect perhaps even
[1:01:46] in our own eyes now he says no I want
[1:01:48] you to be perfect the way God is perfect
[1:01:52] and to make this even worse he had just
[1:01:55] magnified the law remember he said you
[1:01:58] say you know the scripture says you know
[1:02:00] that that you're not supposed to commit
[1:02:02] adultery and he said but I say unto you
[1:02:05] that if a man looks at a woman and lusts
[1:02:07] after her in his mind in his heart he
[1:02:10] has already committed adultery with that
[1:02:13] woman and he will be judged by God
[1:02:15] accordingly having not done it but
[1:02:18] having thought about it he said that
[1:02:20] you'll be judged as if you had that act
[1:02:22] with that woman he had magnified it he
[1:02:24] had showed that your very thoughts the
[1:02:27] very Hearts the very intentions that we
[1:02:29] have God sees it all and he will judge
[1:02:31] us by that and then he says be ye
[1:02:34] therefore perfect who had a
[1:02:37] hope if by some chance somebody never
[1:02:41] acted on their thoughts yet each one of
[1:02:42] us has had thoughts and attitudes and
[1:02:44] motives and objectives that God would
[1:02:46] say they're not holy they're not
[1:02:47] acceptable before me how deflated would
[1:02:50] we feel if we had we had stood there and
[1:02:52] he had magnified the law showing us that
[1:02:54] even our thoughts will judge us us and
[1:02:56] then said now the requirement is for you
[1:02:58] to be
[1:03:01] perfect I don't think anybody walked
[1:03:03] away from that sermon feeling good about
[1:03:06] themselves and that's what the law does
[1:03:09] the law defeats you it leaves you
[1:03:13] hopeless it leaves you without a place
[1:03:15] to go it leaves you without a remedy it
[1:03:18] leaves you in your own
[1:03:21] failure and where do you go from
[1:03:24] there see that's where Satan will deal
[1:03:26] with us is in our failure and he'll say
[1:03:30] there's nowhere left to
[1:03:32] go well if we stay in our own condition
[1:03:35] if we stay in our own strength if we
[1:03:36] stay in what in the way we're born then
[1:03:39] he's right there is nowhere to go but
[1:03:42] there is a place that we can go amen if
[1:03:45] Jesus said to be perfect then there must
[1:03:48] be a way to be
[1:03:50] perfect amen Jesus was showing them that
[1:03:53] their Works would never make them
[1:03:54] perfect
[1:03:56] their works are something God expects
[1:03:58] but that is not their perfection but
[1:04:00] Perfection is determined by God and he
[1:04:02] sees and knows all things that are in
[1:04:03] our lives BR would say this he says if
[1:04:06] there is anything that I can do to make
[1:04:08] myself perfect in the presence of God
[1:04:10] then Christ did not have to die for me
[1:04:13] if there is one thing you can do that
[1:04:15] would Merit anything in the presence of
[1:04:17] God then Christ died in vain listen to
[1:04:20] this no lawke keeping no legalistic
[1:04:23] ideas of yours none of your own Holiness
[1:04:26] no things that you could quit doing quit
[1:04:28] lying quit stealing quit smoking tobacco
[1:04:31] quit going to the picture shows he says
[1:04:33] still you are
[1:04:35] lost cease
[1:04:38] action sit on your couch and do nothing
[1:04:41] he says you're still
[1:04:42] lost he says nothing can do it joining
[1:04:46] churches rituals ceremonies baptism
[1:04:49] orders of the church reading of Creeds
[1:04:51] saying of prayers all those things would
[1:04:53] count nothing you are lost
[1:04:57] not one thing you can do in yourself for
[1:05:00] you are a sinner under condemnation and
[1:05:02] there is no way within yourself or any
[1:05:05] Creed or anything you could do or think
[1:05:07] of of yourself that would Merit one
[1:05:09] thing in the presence of God why because
[1:05:12] you because I am a sinner to start
[1:05:16] with what a horrible way to start an
[1:05:18] Easter morning
[1:05:20] service we are lost we are sinners
[1:05:23] there's nothing in us that can bring us
[1:05:25] and make us uh uh Merit the favor of God
[1:05:28] to even allow us into his presence but
[1:05:31] I'm not here this morning to beat you
[1:05:32] down that's as far as we're going to go
[1:05:33] I'm beating you down I'm here to give us
[1:05:35] hope this morning I'm here to show us
[1:05:37] the path I'm showing us the acceptable
[1:05:39] way I'm showing us the way that God did
[1:05:41] it and brother Bram would say this and
[1:05:43] he said surely if God expects people to
[1:05:46] be perfect as Jesus said be ye therefore
[1:05:48] perfect even as your father in Heaven is
[1:05:50] perfect there must be some preparation
[1:05:54] somewhere if God requires it then there
[1:05:57] has to be a way to do it because he's a
[1:05:59] just God he would continue say if God
[1:06:02] required a church without spot or
[1:06:04] wrinkle he had to have something to make
[1:06:06] it that way he could not require it his
[1:06:09] Justice his judgments could not let him
[1:06:11] ask such a thing if there wasn't a way
[1:06:13] to make it but he reminds us and man
[1:06:15] cannot do it in himself he's a total
[1:06:19] failure that is the starting point of
[1:06:22] getting on the path to Perfection is to
[1:06:23] say I can't do it there's nothing in me
[1:06:27] I'm a total failure he says God let him
[1:06:29] see that through the law through the
[1:06:31] judges through all the Old Testament he
[1:06:32] sent the prophets he sent the righteous
[1:06:34] men and they found out that everyone
[1:06:38] failed he says so God by his Sovereign
[1:06:41] Grace sent from the portals of Glory his
[1:06:44] only begotten son to take our place now
[1:06:47] here's our hope he says I'll tell you
[1:06:50] now there is a perfect place a perfect
[1:06:54] heaven a perfect God a perfect savior a
[1:06:58] perfect blood a perfect atonement a
[1:07:01] perfect being for
[1:07:05] you you aren't it but it's for
[1:07:09] you in and of yourself you aren't it but
[1:07:11] there's a perfect place a perfect heaven
[1:07:13] a perfect God a perfect savior a perfect
[1:07:16] blood a perfect atonement a perfect
[1:07:18] being a perfect body that is built and
[1:07:20] ready and waiting for each and every one
[1:07:22] of us how many wants that Perfection
[1:07:24] this morning to say I want to step into
[1:07:26] that that I'm sick and tired of dealing
[1:07:29] with this I want to step into the
[1:07:30] Perfection that God has prepared and we
[1:07:33] can see it if we go back to Ephesians 1
[1:07:35] this morning where we started he said
[1:07:37] according as he had chosen Us in him
[1:07:40] before the foundation of the world that
[1:07:42] we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:07:45] before him in
[1:07:47] love where are we
[1:07:49] chosen in Christ not just by Christ in
[1:07:55] Christ
[1:07:56] that is a position that is a place that
[1:07:58] is a a a a an
[1:08:02] inheritance it is an origin for the
[1:08:06] believer he says what that we would be
[1:08:09] holy and Without Blame before the world
[1:08:11] was brought into order before God
[1:08:13] started doing anything on this Earth to
[1:08:15] bring anything out of it he placed us in
[1:08:18] Christ and he said in Christ You Are
[1:08:21] Holy and
[1:08:23] blameless that is our origin
[1:08:26] that is our seed that is where we come
[1:08:28] from and because that is our origin
[1:08:30] that's where we have to end up cuz
[1:08:32] remember God will not be mocked whatever
[1:08:35] a man SWS he'll reap the law of the
[1:08:36] Harvest is what you sow is what you get
[1:08:39] and God SED us there as holy and
[1:08:41] blameless in Christ that means what
[1:08:43] comes out has to be eventually holy
[1:08:45] blameless and in Christ amen he says
[1:08:48] before we ever messed up before we did a
[1:08:51] work good or bad we were already in him
[1:08:55] he says having predestinated us unto the
[1:08:57] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:08:59] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:09:02] of his will not according to our good
[1:09:04] works our good
[1:09:07] intentions none of that it says
[1:09:09] according to the good pleasure of the
[1:09:10] will of God and it's Grace to us because
[1:09:13] it's by his will that we come into this
[1:09:16] place it's unmar favor we don't deserve
[1:09:18] it he says for what what purpose to the
[1:09:21] praise of the glory of his grace wherein
[1:09:24] he had made us accept
[1:09:26] where in the Beloved who is a beloved we
[1:09:31] read it a couple Services ago when Jesus
[1:09:32] comes to the River Jordan and he's
[1:09:34] baptized and the Holy Spirit drops on
[1:09:36] him he says this is my
[1:09:39] beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell
[1:09:42] so it's in Christ that we are accepted
[1:09:44] amen it's through Christ we are accepted
[1:09:47] and it says in
[1:09:48] whom remember it's not with whom it's in
[1:09:52] it is a position it's a placing of the
[1:09:54] child of God in whom we have Redemption
[1:09:57] through his blood the Forgiveness of
[1:09:59] sins according to the riches of Grace of
[1:10:02] his grace it's through Christ that we
[1:10:03] have all these things amen through his
[1:10:06] blood we have the forgiveness of sin by
[1:10:08] his grace amen it's not by our works but
[1:10:10] it's by his grace and we saw as we
[1:10:12] closed in the last few scriptures on
[1:10:14] Friday night how that as Jesus died the
[1:10:17] veil of the temple was torn from the top
[1:10:19] to the bottom and when you look at the
[1:10:21] construction of that of those those
[1:10:23] curtains that were there the veil that
[1:10:24] was there it was not one piece but it
[1:10:26] was multiple pieces and multiple layers
[1:10:29] together and it was torn from the top
[1:10:31] showing that it started in heaven it was
[1:10:33] a work of God not a work of man starting
[1:10:35] from the bottom and ripping up but no
[1:10:37] man could tear that Veil it was woven
[1:10:40] too strongly it was too thick for a man
[1:10:42] to do it but God as Christ died he tore
[1:10:45] the veil into the holy of holies where
[1:10:47] his presence was where The Mercy Seat
[1:10:50] was where the word
[1:10:52] was and he tore it apart and did what
[1:10:56] let us look
[1:10:58] in now we know that before God is going
[1:11:02] to if God's going to open up access to
[1:11:05] him it must mean that access has been
[1:11:08] granted cuz God's not here to cause us
[1:11:10] to fall into a trap he's not going to
[1:11:13] say the do open and then as soon as we
[1:11:14] come into His presence we die because
[1:11:16] we're Unholy or unacceptable but he
[1:11:18] opens it because a way has been made
[1:11:21] something happened at Calvary that
[1:11:22] opened up a way for a person to come
[1:11:24] back into the Pres presence of God now
[1:11:26] amen but if we look in the Old Testament
[1:11:29] the holy of holies which was what what
[1:11:31] the veil surrounded was special because
[1:11:34] the presence of God was there the
[1:11:35] shikina glory was there and in that
[1:11:38] presence nothing died remember Aaron's
[1:11:40] Rod was there and it was just a stick
[1:11:42] from an almond tree but in the presence
[1:11:44] of God It produced almonds for thousands
[1:11:46] of years and the priesthood could go in
[1:11:50] and they could testify that the almonds
[1:11:52] are still growing because it's in the
[1:11:53] presence of eternal life
[1:11:56] it's showing what happens when we get
[1:11:58] back into the presence of God and
[1:12:00] remember they had the Mana that fell
[1:12:01] from heaven that fed the children of
[1:12:02] Israel and they had a bowl of mana and
[1:12:05] it was always there and it never went
[1:12:06] moldy it never went stale it never
[1:12:08] rotted away and then they had a the the
[1:12:11] the Ark of the Covenant there and on top
[1:12:13] of it was a seat and it was overlayered
[1:12:15] with gold the deity of God Amen but
[1:12:18] there was a seat there and once a year
[1:12:21] the priest the high priest would go in
[1:12:23] and he would pour blood on that seat and
[1:12:25] that made it a mercy seat it was
[1:12:28] judgment without the blood but if the
[1:12:29] blood could be placed on it it turned
[1:12:31] into a mercy seat and God would forgive
[1:12:33] the sins now for the sake of time this
[1:12:36] morning we can read about it in
[1:12:37] Leviticus 16 I'm not going to read it
[1:12:39] but I'm going to summarize it but in
[1:12:40] Leviticus 16:2 God warns Moses he says
[1:12:44] you can't just have men coming into my
[1:12:46] presence whenever they want he says
[1:12:48] they've got to be ordained men they've
[1:12:49] got to be chosen men and it was the
[1:12:51] ironic priesthood and it was the high
[1:12:53] priest alone that could go went to the
[1:12:56] the presence of God and he was only
[1:12:58] allowed to come in one day a year one
[1:13:01] day if he came outside of that one day
[1:13:03] God would strike him dead no matter how
[1:13:05] good he was no matter his good
[1:13:07] intentions he had to come in under a
[1:13:10] certain way and it was to make an
[1:13:12] atonement for the sins of himself and
[1:13:15] for the sins of the people it was to
[1:13:17] come into the presence of God for
[1:13:20] forgiveness and then you jump to verses
[1:13:22] 3 to 14 and only the high priest could
[1:13:24] come in in every year one day and he
[1:13:27] could only come in one way that was with
[1:13:31] blood he had to come in with the blood
[1:13:33] of a bull and he had to make a sacrifice
[1:13:35] for himself and his family and he would
[1:13:37] go into the holy of holies and he would
[1:13:39] hold this thing of blood amen God had to
[1:13:43] accept him
[1:13:44] first this is key God has to accept that
[1:13:48] high priest first cuz that man is
[1:13:50] mediating for the people and so he would
[1:13:53] go in and he would offer the blood and
[1:13:55] he would he would he would sprinkle it
[1:13:57] and he would place it on the mercy seat
[1:13:59] and then if he was not struck
[1:14:02] dead it meant that God had accepted his
[1:14:05] his offering and that man would walk out
[1:14:08] he would clean himself completely then
[1:14:10] he would offer a sacrifice for the
[1:14:12] people of a goat and he would walk in
[1:14:14] with the blood for the people and go to
[1:14:17] offer that and then God would accept
[1:14:19] that and he would come out and the
[1:14:20] people would Breathe this big sigh of
[1:14:22] relief because it meant their sins were
[1:14:25] covered for another year but they had to
[1:14:27] come in under blood amen and outside of
[1:14:30] that blood they would die and their sins
[1:14:33] will be held against them and the
[1:14:34] Judgment of God will come down on them
[1:14:36] so we see that blood is required to
[1:14:38] enter the presence of God that's what we
[1:14:41] see from that God required in Eden after
[1:14:43] they first sinned and for the next
[1:14:44] thousands of years God would God would
[1:14:47] require that blood to be there so we see
[1:14:49] that blood is the answer blood is the
[1:14:52] answer blood is the key to access the
[1:14:54] presence of God God and and he would
[1:14:56] tell us why in Leviticus 17 the very
[1:14:58] next chapter we've been talking about he
[1:15:00] said for the life of the flesh is in the
[1:15:03] blood and I have given it to you upon
[1:15:05] the altar to make an atonement for your
[1:15:09] souls the soul is what the atonements
[1:15:12] been made for because that's the Eternal
[1:15:13] part we're in Fallen flesh nothing here
[1:15:16] is good that's why we need a new body
[1:15:18] that's why we need a body like Christ
[1:15:20] glorious bodies because this one's in
[1:15:22] flesh this never will please him but the
[1:15:25] soul it's an atonement for the soul for
[1:15:27] the center for the for the the command
[1:15:30] center of our life he says it is an
[1:15:32] atonement for your souls for it is the
[1:15:34] blood that maketh an atonement for the
[1:15:37] soul why because you can't have blood
[1:15:40] without a life being lost amen the life
[1:15:43] is in the blood blood's the Life Source
[1:15:45] to us we can live without a lot of
[1:15:46] things for a while you can go without
[1:15:48] water for a few days you can go without
[1:15:50] food for a month or so you can go
[1:15:52] without oxygen for five or six minutes
[1:15:55] they've had it up to 66 minutes in cold
[1:15:58] water that somebody can survive without
[1:16:00] oxygen but you take the blood out of a
[1:16:02] person's body and they are dead
[1:16:05] instantly why because the life is in the
[1:16:08] blood and Christ was showing and and God
[1:16:11] was showing in types and shadows what
[1:16:12] was required to bring us back into
[1:16:14] Perfection into Perfection it's got to
[1:16:17] be blood but notice it's not the blood
[1:16:19] itself that makes us perfect it's the
[1:16:22] blood that makes us
[1:16:23] accepted it's not the blood that makes
[1:16:26] us perfect in and of itself amen the law
[1:16:28] was imperfect and we saw that an
[1:16:29] innocent animal was killed and the blood
[1:16:32] covered the sin but remember that their
[1:16:35] blood the the life of an animal is
[1:16:37] incompatible with mine I can't take a
[1:16:39] blood transfusion from a chimpan and put
[1:16:42] it in my body and it work it doesn't
[1:16:44] work that way why because their life is
[1:16:46] incompatible with my life their blood is
[1:16:48] incompatible with my body so what would
[1:16:50] happen is their blood they were innocent
[1:16:52] they would cover their our sins but the
[1:16:54] intention was that the life of that
[1:16:56] blood would come into the person and
[1:16:58] that would make them perfect because the
[1:17:01] innocent would come into the
[1:17:03] guilty and what change them I would
[1:17:06] become I would take on the Innocence
[1:17:08] because of the life of the innocent
[1:17:09] coming into me but it never worked
[1:17:11] because animal blood and human blood
[1:17:13] they don't mix amen but it pointed to a
[1:17:15] need for us to have a compatible one
[1:17:18] that would die for us and give his life
[1:17:21] for us and give his blood for us so that
[1:17:23] his life could come into us that's what
[1:17:25] would make me innocent that's what would
[1:17:27] make me perfect that's what would make
[1:17:29] me acceptable would be if the life came
[1:17:30] in not just if the blood covered amen
[1:17:33] why because the end goal was Perfection
[1:17:36] the end goal was restoration the end
[1:17:38] goal was Redemption to bring us back
[1:17:39] into the presence of God to have eternal
[1:17:42] life to have authority over the world
[1:17:44] around us to be living Sons and
[1:17:46] Daughters of God under the original
[1:17:48] conditions of the Garden of Eden amen so
[1:17:51] when Christ came and he bled and he died
[1:17:54] for us us his blood was the blood of God
[1:17:57] the blood was shed and he was perfect he
[1:17:59] was sinless and he was willing and that
[1:18:01] innocent was just like that of the Lambs
[1:18:04] and he gave that for us and God accepted
[1:18:06] that he was the provided Lamb of God the
[1:18:09] scripture says he was a lamb slain
[1:18:11] before the foundation of the world he
[1:18:13] was prepared by God and when he died the
[1:18:15] price was
[1:18:17] paid the price was paid for our sins our
[1:18:19] debts were erased our debts were
[1:18:21] eliminated there's nothing on the books
[1:18:23] it's not just marked out but it's
[1:18:25] completely erased there is no evidence
[1:18:26] that we are sinners this morning none
[1:18:29] whatsoever and we even see the effect of
[1:18:32] that on the on the cross because the
[1:18:33] thief is there remember and he says when
[1:18:36] you come into your kingdom remember me
[1:18:38] and Jesus says this day you'll be with
[1:18:40] me in Paradise that man was a
[1:18:43] sinner but the blood of Christ was
[1:18:45] coming off that cross and Christ died
[1:18:48] before that man paid the price for his
[1:18:50] sins and that Thief went directly into
[1:18:53] Paradise
[1:18:55] that's how effective the blood is but
[1:18:58] that Thief never went to Paradise a good
[1:19:00] man he went there a thief he went there
[1:19:04] a sinner the blood had paid the price
[1:19:06] and so he could go in amen but his life
[1:19:09] had not been changed when Christ died on
[1:19:11] the cross Peter didn't
[1:19:13] change John didn't change the disciples
[1:19:15] didn't change they were all still
[1:19:18] Sinners Sav by Grace under the blood of
[1:19:22] Christ their sins were hidden but their
[1:19:25] nature hadn't changed and they were
[1:19:27] still Bound in their own nature and we
[1:19:28] see what happened to Peter Peter went
[1:19:30] out and and he's fishing naked and he's
[1:19:33] he's disappointed and they're doubting
[1:19:34] the Lord's word and these different
[1:19:36] things why because they haven't been
[1:19:38] changed there the price has been paid
[1:19:41] their sins have been covered but they're
[1:19:42] still Bound in their own Humanity
[1:19:44] they're still Bound in this sinful flesh
[1:19:46] that they're born with but we see in all
[1:19:49] of this a promise that God would change
[1:19:51] our Natures as well that he'd set us
[1:19:53] free from the things that were born with
[1:19:55] our very being Amen to fix what was
[1:19:57] broken by sin and Paul will talk about
[1:20:00] this in Hebrews 10 and we're going to
[1:20:01] spend quite a bit of time there this
[1:20:03] morning and he's speaking about Christ
[1:20:05] he says wherefore when he comes into the
[1:20:07] world cometh into the world he said
[1:20:10] sacrifice and offering thou wouldst not
[1:20:12] but a body hast thou prepared me he's
[1:20:14] saying God didn't want
[1:20:17] sacrifices God wasn't sitting there
[1:20:19] wanting thousands or millions of animals
[1:20:21] to be slaughtered that was not what he
[1:20:24] wanted but he says a body thou Hast
[1:20:26] prepared me he needed someone to die he
[1:20:29] needed a man to die for those sins and
[1:20:31] he said and burnt offerings and
[1:20:33] sacrifices for sin thou Hast had no
[1:20:35] pleasure God didn't enjoy seeing those
[1:20:37] animals
[1:20:39] slaughtered he says then said I this is
[1:20:41] Christ speaking lo I come in the volume
[1:20:44] of the book it's written of me to do thy
[1:20:47] will oh God and Christ is saying listen
[1:20:49] you prepared a body for me and I'm here
[1:20:51] to use it for your will then we jump
[1:20:54] down to verse 10 it says by the which by
[1:20:56] what by the sacrificing of that body we
[1:20:59] will we are all we are Sanctified
[1:21:03] through the offering of the body of
[1:21:06] Jesus Christ once for
[1:21:10] all that means it's a complete and total
[1:21:14] acceptable work before God Amen remember
[1:21:17] we LED last last service where where
[1:21:20] when he when Christ was on the cross and
[1:21:22] at the whipping pulse and these things
[1:21:24] it's says God was pleased to bruise him
[1:21:27] and then when it was all done it says he
[1:21:29] was
[1:21:30] satisfied God had let it all out on that
[1:21:32] body and he was satisfied that meant the
[1:21:35] debt was settled the sin question was
[1:21:38] settled forever that's what happened to
[1:21:40] calary is it settled the sing question
[1:21:42] forever God was satisfied amen amen and
[1:21:46] we see here in Hebrews 10:10 that it's
[1:21:48] by the sacrifice of Christ that we are
[1:21:50] clean before
[1:21:52] God then it jumps down to verse 11 and
[1:21:54] it says and every priest standeth daily
[1:21:57] ministering and offering often times the
[1:21:59] same sacrifices which can never take
[1:22:01] away sins yeah under under the the Old
[1:22:04] Testament law the ministry the
[1:22:06] priesthood would offer these sacrifices
[1:22:08] daily to cover the sins but but Paul's
[1:22:11] saying it never took away the sins it
[1:22:13] just covered them we needed someone to
[1:22:15] wash our sins away amen we needed
[1:22:18] somebody to pay the debt we needed
[1:22:19] somebody to remove them from off the
[1:22:22] books amen the sin debt wasn't paid but
[1:22:24] but it was covered it was hidden by the
[1:22:25] blood of blls and goats temporarily he
[1:22:28] says but this man Christ it had to be a
[1:22:32] man it had to be somebody whose life was
[1:22:33] compatible with ours but this man after
[1:22:36] he had offered one sacrifice for sins
[1:22:40] forever he says sat down on the right
[1:22:43] hand of God I saw a news story yesterday
[1:22:46] where there's a man in the Philippines
[1:22:48] got crucified for 10
[1:22:50] minutes literally crucified they drove
[1:22:52] stainless steel nails through his feet
[1:22:54] through his hands and put him up on a
[1:22:56] cross and stood him up there for 10
[1:22:57] minutes that man needs to read Hebrews
[1:23:00] 10:12 the sacrifice has been paid now
[1:23:04] you say well I don't crucify myself but
[1:23:06] we beat ourselves up so often we let
[1:23:08] Satan beat us up over our mistakes and
[1:23:11] instead of just saying I claim the blood
[1:23:14] not in this flippancy of I'm going to go
[1:23:16] do it again and claim the blood and go
[1:23:17] do it again and claim the blood but Lord
[1:23:19] I'm sorry Lord I'm sorry I didn't mean
[1:23:21] to do it and I claim the blood and when
[1:23:23] you do that you and walk away completely
[1:23:25] free in your conscience we do not have
[1:23:27] to sit around walk around beating
[1:23:29] ourselves up over our mistakes it's a
[1:23:32] mistake we're trapped into it even
[1:23:36] willfully yet he's faithful to
[1:23:39] forgive when you do it willfully you pay
[1:23:41] a different price when you're trapped
[1:23:43] into it it's a little different there's
[1:23:44] always consequences but that we're
[1:23:46] supposed to have is death and he paid
[1:23:48] that death Price He satisfied that sin
[1:23:50] debt forever amen that man that got
[1:23:53] crucified has missed the revelation that
[1:23:54] Christ has already paid for every sin he
[1:23:56] took every bit of suffering we're not
[1:23:58] required to suffer like he is that's why
[1:24:00] he did it so we wouldn't have
[1:24:02] to he says and from hence
[1:24:05] forth expecting till his enemies be made
[1:24:08] his foot stol we're talking about
[1:24:11] perfection restored this morning let's
[1:24:13] read this together for by one offering
[1:24:16] he hath perfected
[1:24:18] forever them that are
[1:24:21] Sanctified one offering Christ
[1:24:25] perfects us our Perfection is all
[1:24:28] through his work amen notice he doesn't
[1:24:30] say he will perfect he's going to
[1:24:32] perfect one day I'll be
[1:24:35] perfect have perfected it's done it's
[1:24:40] finished it's a complete work Paul would
[1:24:42] say in another place he says we are
[1:24:44] sitting now in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:24:48] Jesus that's where we started we were in
[1:24:52] him holy and blameless
[1:24:54] Paul says we are now why by the perfect
[1:24:57] work of Christ at Calvary prophet of God
[1:25:00] would say this he says there you are
[1:25:02] that's the answer to the death of Christ
[1:25:05] he says that's the answer to Calvary he
[1:25:07] absolutely with his own blood purchased
[1:25:10] our sins and perfected forever his
[1:25:14] Believers he says therefore in Christ We
[1:25:16] Stand blameless perfected in the
[1:25:19] presence of God Almighty he says we are
[1:25:21] underprivileged people with our own
[1:25:23] doctrines not catch this he says we all
[1:25:26] been taught that we have to get up to a
[1:25:29] certain place we have to do a certain
[1:25:31] thing we read the scripture last time
[1:25:34] that says while we were yet sinners
[1:25:36] Christ died for us you don't have to
[1:25:38] come up to anything to accept him we
[1:25:40] don't have to clean up to come into
[1:25:42] church we don't have to make oursel less
[1:25:44] sinful to be accepted we just have to
[1:25:46] accept his
[1:25:47] sacrifice today whether I did nothing
[1:25:50] wrong yesterday or whether my day was
[1:25:52] full of sin it matters not because he
[1:25:55] took my place we don't come to church
[1:25:58] cleaned up we come to church to get
[1:25:59] cleaned up this is a hospital it's a
[1:26:02] place for sick people for lost people
[1:26:05] for imperfect
[1:26:07] people why because he was the Perfection
[1:26:10] that God
[1:26:11] required when we wait for ourselves to
[1:26:13] be better to come into the presence of
[1:26:15] God we're just hurting
[1:26:17] ourselves he says we've all been taught
[1:26:20] that we have to get up to a certain
[1:26:21] place and we have to do a certain thing
[1:26:23] no my brother it's nothing you've done
[1:26:25] it's what God did for you we are now we
[1:26:29] are if we are justified by faith we are
[1:26:31] perfected forever in the presence of God
[1:26:34] he says then Jesus said be ye therefore
[1:26:36] perfect he says then it was perfected
[1:26:38] forever God through the death of Christ
[1:26:40] 1900 years ago today perfected the
[1:26:44] believer that he foresaw before the
[1:26:47] foundation of the world forever forever
[1:26:51] you can't undo it you can't Merit it you
[1:26:53] can't make it at work he's done it it's
[1:26:55] already
[1:26:57] finished he says those who he has called
[1:26:59] he has Justified those he fornew he has
[1:27:01] called those who he has called he's
[1:27:03] Justified those who he has Justified he
[1:27:05] is already glorified he has perfected
[1:27:08] his Believers you're standing perfect
[1:27:11] before God this morning through the work
[1:27:13] of Christ but remember it said how are
[1:27:15] we Sanctified it says we're Sanctified
[1:27:18] by the offering of
[1:27:22] Christ how are we per ected by one
[1:27:25] offering but what did he
[1:27:28] offer see this is where so many lose it
[1:27:32] is they don't look at the whole
[1:27:34] offering and they miss out on the full
[1:27:36] Redemption they miss out on the
[1:27:39] Perfection because if we see what Christ
[1:27:42] offered then we know what is supposed to
[1:27:44] be working in our lives and we see what
[1:27:46] offer what an offering is because
[1:27:48] remember an offering is what you tear
[1:27:50] out and we see in Luke 23:46 it says
[1:27:53] when Jesus had cried with a loud voice
[1:27:55] he said father into thy hands I commend
[1:27:58] my spirit and having said thus he gave
[1:28:00] up the ghost he gave up his Spirit he
[1:28:02] willingly did it he did not they did not
[1:28:04] take his life from him he gave his life
[1:28:07] up literally the life went out of the
[1:28:10] blood somebody was talking to me the
[1:28:12] other day and and they were talking
[1:28:14] about what brother Brown was talking
[1:28:15] about he said it literally went down
[1:28:16] when he tore his body apart he went down
[1:28:19] to the atomic level and ripped that that
[1:28:22] that life was literally torn out out of
[1:28:25] him the very life in him was taken out
[1:28:27] of him that's what he gave up and then
[1:28:29] in John 19:34 it says and when one of
[1:28:32] the soldiers with a spear pierced his
[1:28:34] side and forth with came there out blood
[1:28:36] and water what was his offering Spirit
[1:28:39] blood and
[1:28:41] water that's what was torn apart amen
[1:28:46] remember the quote we read last service
[1:28:47] where he says then he tore the soul out
[1:28:49] of his own son he separated a covenant
[1:28:52] and he threw the body onto the ground
[1:28:55] now we know that body went back to
[1:28:57] heaven and and it's behind the Throne of
[1:28:59] God it's the proof of the sacrifice it's
[1:29:01] there amen and it's what what was
[1:29:03] represented in scripture when we readed
[1:29:05] about Abraham where he tore those beasts
[1:29:07] apart as a sacrifice to God to confirm
[1:29:09] the Covenant all of those represented
[1:29:11] Christ but remember we see here he
[1:29:13] didn't T he didn't tear the body out he
[1:29:16] tore the soul out he tore the El tore
[1:29:18] the elements of him out of him but the
[1:29:20] body he just
[1:29:23] left
[1:29:24] why is it the parts that are torn out is
[1:29:27] what makes up the Covenant what comes
[1:29:29] out of him is what makes up the Covenant
[1:29:31] and you got to have all the parts of the
[1:29:33] Covenant to have a
[1:29:35] covenant amen remember we talked about
[1:29:38] what they did in those days is they
[1:29:39] would write out a covenant in the middle
[1:29:40] of those beasts and then they tear it
[1:29:43] and however many people were part of the
[1:29:44] Covenant got a piece of that Covenant
[1:29:46] and the Covenant had to be restored
[1:29:48] together to be
[1:29:49] enforced every portion had to be there
[1:29:52] whatever was tore out had to be brought
[1:29:53] back to those that held the Covenant who
[1:29:56] holds the Covenant
[1:29:57] today it's God's covenant with us that
[1:29:59] means each and every one of us has to
[1:30:01] have a portion of this Covenant we've
[1:30:03] got to have a portion of the elements
[1:30:04] that were torn out when Christ when God
[1:30:06] tore Christ apart at Calvary he took the
[1:30:08] blood he took the water and he took the
[1:30:11] spirit the separation of the water and
[1:30:14] blood that's the that's the atomic
[1:30:15] separation of the literal elements in
[1:30:17] his body and he did it with purpose
[1:30:20] what's the purpose of the blood it's to
[1:30:22] pay the price for our sins
[1:30:24] that is the purpose of it it's what
[1:30:25] justifies us it erases our sin debt it
[1:30:28] satisfies the righteous anger and
[1:30:29] Judgment of God John 1 1 John 1:1 says
[1:30:32] but if we walk in the light as he is in
[1:30:35] the light we have Fellowship one another
[1:30:37] and the blood of Jesus Christ his son
[1:30:40] cleanses us from all sin the blood is
[1:30:42] there to cleanse us it's there to clean
[1:30:43] us of the initial thing of that burden
[1:30:47] that's there just by our nature just by
[1:30:49] our birth he says if we say we have no
[1:30:51] sin we deceive ourselves and the truth
[1:30:53] is not in Us in other words you can't
[1:30:55] come to God saying I don't need your
[1:30:58] your
[1:31:00] atonement you can't come and say I don't
[1:31:02] need to repent I'm good the way I am he
[1:31:05] says if you do that then the truth of
[1:31:07] God's not even in you and we're
[1:31:08] deceiving ourselves he says but if we
[1:31:11] confess our sins he is faithful and just
[1:31:14] to forgive us and to cleanse us from all
[1:31:16] unrighteousness so if we confess if we
[1:31:18] repent if we accept his offering he
[1:31:20] forgives us but catch that last phrase
[1:31:23] because he doesn't just say he'll
[1:31:25] forgive us but it cleanses us that's a
[1:31:29] working not just a washing but it's a
[1:31:31] working amen we'll be cleaned out not
[1:31:35] just covered not just erased but we'll
[1:31:36] be cleaned out amen we'll be transformed
[1:31:38] we'll be different than we were before
[1:31:41] that's a working of of that and what is
[1:31:43] the water amen it's the it's the washing
[1:31:45] of the Water by the word that's applied
[1:31:47] to our lives daily it's the word of God
[1:31:50] being washed being being effective in
[1:31:52] our life to take us away from the things
[1:31:53] into the world to expose the way Satan
[1:31:55] operates and to bring us into the plan
[1:31:57] of God and that's a daily thing we
[1:32:00] talked about it when we did foot washing
[1:32:01] on Friday amen he says you need to be
[1:32:03] washed
[1:32:05] daily because no matter who you are no
[1:32:08] matter where you go this is a dirty
[1:32:10] world and you're going to get dirty no
[1:32:12] matter what without intent without
[1:32:16] purpose you're still going to get dirty
[1:32:18] you can't walk through a mall without
[1:32:19] getting dirty you can't drive by a
[1:32:21] billboard without getting dirty you
[1:32:22] can't surf the Internet without getting
[1:32:24] dirty you can't be around co-workers
[1:32:26] without getting dirty it's dirt it's
[1:32:29] filth and that's has to be washed on a
[1:32:31] daily basis amen and sometimes it's the
[1:32:34] washing of the word comes by conviction
[1:32:37] and God shows us something that's off in
[1:32:38] our life and he brings us to a place
[1:32:41] where we'll say I'll lay that aside
[1:32:44] sometimes it's by
[1:32:45] inspiration I love it when I read this
[1:32:47] and it shows me that I can live in a
[1:32:49] higher place that I have blessings from
[1:32:51] God that I have promises from God and we
[1:32:53] can take that and we can we can we can
[1:32:55] have faith in it amen and it shows us
[1:32:56] what we're meant to be and how we're
[1:32:58] supposed to live and that there's a
[1:32:59] power of God's word behind it to make it
[1:33:01] live in us and then sometimes it's just
[1:33:03] by simple
[1:33:05] teaching this washing of water showing
[1:33:07] us right and showing us wrong very
[1:33:10] simple
[1:33:12] nonthreatening but it's still the
[1:33:14] washing of water helping us to live an
[1:33:16] overcoming life
[1:33:18] amen Ephesians 5 would say this husbands
[1:33:21] love your wives even as Christ also
[1:33:23] loved the church chch and gave himself
[1:33:24] for it that he might sanctify and
[1:33:27] cleanse it with the washing of Water by
[1:33:30] the word see that cleansing is the
[1:33:32] external dirt the sanctification is the
[1:33:34] internal
[1:33:36] work it's like a a car that is filthy on
[1:33:39] the outside if you're going to justify
[1:33:41] it you kind of just spray up the outside
[1:33:42] you clean out the exterior but if you're
[1:33:44] going to sanctify it you're going to do
[1:33:45] a deep clean on the inside and get all
[1:33:46] the the food that the kids left out of
[1:33:48] it and all the dirt and the muck and the
[1:33:49] filth cuz it's been left un unclean for
[1:33:52] so long it's an internal work he says
[1:33:54] that's what the washing of the water of
[1:33:56] the word does he says for what purpose
[1:33:59] that he might present it to himself a
[1:34:01] glorious church not having spot or
[1:34:04] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[1:34:06] should be holy and without blemish
[1:34:07] remember we read the quote where he says
[1:34:08] if God requires Perfection there's got
[1:34:10] to be a preparation for it there's got
[1:34:12] to be a way made for it so we see the
[1:34:13] first way is by the blood it erases the
[1:34:16] sin debt then we see it's by the word by
[1:34:18] the washing of Water by the word that it
[1:34:20] keeps us clean and it produces a child
[1:34:22] that's ready for the life
[1:34:25] he says it's a perfect place calling you
[1:34:28] to that Perfection and you have to be
[1:34:30] perfect to get there the Bible said so
[1:34:31] Jesus said be therefore perfect even as
[1:34:34] your father in Heaven is perfect it's a
[1:34:36] perfect Kingdom so it must be a perfect
[1:34:38] people come because you have to stand
[1:34:41] and be married to a perfect Son of God
[1:34:43] and you must be a perfect bride so how
[1:34:46] can you do it through anything else but
[1:34:47] the perfect word of God he says which is
[1:34:49] the Waters of Separation that washes us
[1:34:52] from our sins that's right the blood of
[1:34:54] Jesus Christ think of it the dripping
[1:34:56] bloody word amen the blood the word of
[1:34:59] God bleeding blood to wash the bride in
[1:35:02] amen yes sir she stands perfect virgin
[1:35:06] unadulterated she never sinned in the
[1:35:09] first place God doesn't attribute those
[1:35:12] sins to us the blood covers it and the
[1:35:15] water of the word keeps it away it's not
[1:35:18] there it can't be seen God can't see it
[1:35:21] so we have the blood we have the water
[1:35:23] of the the word but then we have the
[1:35:25] spirit that was taken out of Christ that
[1:35:26] he gave up and what is that it's his
[1:35:28] very life that's what the spirit is it's
[1:35:31] remember the life is in the blood and
[1:35:33] that life that Spirit went back to God
[1:35:36] Jesus said I commend my spirit back to
[1:35:38] you and it went back to
[1:35:39] God so the life came out but the life's
[1:35:42] got to come back too because that's the
[1:35:43] third portion of his Covenant that's the
[1:35:45] third part that was torn out of him and
[1:35:47] it's the holy spirit it's the eternal
[1:35:49] life of God and we can be clean we can
[1:35:52] be debt free we can look good but
[1:35:54] without the spirit we're just a
[1:35:56] good-look corpse that's all we are and
[1:35:59] that's what religion produces is
[1:36:01] good-looking
[1:36:02] corpses because they're clean they're
[1:36:05] washed but they're ready for the grave
[1:36:08] instead of life and that's where it gets
[1:36:10] us with man's ideas amen but that life
[1:36:13] has to come into us to give us that
[1:36:15] proven Victorious life because the same
[1:36:17] life that the same life that It produced
[1:36:19] in Christ is what it produces in a bride
[1:36:22] in the children of God Amen
[1:36:24] Paul confirms it in Hebrews 10 as we go
[1:36:26] back he says for by one offering he hath
[1:36:29] perfected forever them that are
[1:36:30] Sanctified and here's the proof of the
[1:36:32] Resurrection here's the proof of the
[1:36:34] sanctification here's the proof of our
[1:36:35] Perfection he says whereof the Holy
[1:36:38] Ghost is also a witness to us so the
[1:36:41] Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost in our life
[1:36:43] is a witness that we are
[1:36:46] perfect that's quite a
[1:36:48] statement but remember he's looking at a
[1:36:51] soul he's not looking at this body
[1:36:55] because the Holy Spirit seals our soul
[1:36:58] to the day of redemption see we're
[1:37:00] looking at perfection in this flesh no
[1:37:03] that's what the blood covers it covers
[1:37:06] that imperfection but the Perfection
[1:37:07] that he requires is not in this flesh
[1:37:10] it'll be when we get to the other side
[1:37:12] and we have a body like his a sinless
[1:37:13] body but it's the soul that he's looking
[1:37:15] at it's the heart of a man it's the
[1:37:17] nature of a man and when he seals that
[1:37:19] with the Holy Spirit when his life comes
[1:37:21] back in us that's the proof that we are
[1:37:23] perfect
[1:37:24] why cuz God can't dwell in
[1:37:26] imperfection if God requires Perfection
[1:37:29] and God is living in you what does that
[1:37:31] mean you are perfect in his eyes you're
[1:37:33] accepted in his eyes amen God can't
[1:37:36] dwell in imperfection and if he requires
[1:37:38] Perfection and he's dwelling in you that
[1:37:39] makes you perfect this morning if you've
[1:37:41] got the Holy Ghost he said that whereof
[1:37:44] the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us
[1:37:46] for after that he has said before this
[1:37:49] is the Covenant that I will make with
[1:37:51] them he says after those days sayith the
[1:37:54] Lord I'll put my laws into their hearts
[1:37:56] and in their minds will I write them in
[1:37:58] other words God would take his word and
[1:38:00] he would place it inside of us and he
[1:38:02] would make us live it by choice not by
[1:38:06] force he would put something in us this
[1:38:08] is the proof of his Covenant is his life
[1:38:11] in us that makes us want to live
[1:38:13] according to his word he says and their
[1:38:15] sins and iniquities will I remember no
[1:38:17] more that's Ezekiel 36 if you want to go
[1:38:20] back to it 24-27 so the holy spirit in
[1:38:23] our lives is the witness it's the
[1:38:24] confirmation it's the proof it's the
[1:38:26] certification that God has accepted us
[1:38:30] that's what it is it's God confirming to
[1:38:32] us that we have met his requirement
[1:38:35] through
[1:38:36] Christ how do you meet it except the
[1:38:38] work of Christ that's all it's so simple
[1:38:42] I don't have to come and and lay down
[1:38:44] here and beat myself up in that yes
[1:38:46] repentance will have tears a dry-eyed
[1:38:49] confession is no confession amen but
[1:38:52] when I repent and I lay myself before
[1:38:54] him and say I claim the sacrifice of
[1:38:56] Christ he he does what he certifies me
[1:38:59] and he says I accept it and he fills me
[1:39:01] with his spirit and that shows that I'm
[1:39:03] perfect in his eyes we can't just rest
[1:39:06] on the effect of the blood we need the
[1:39:08] effect of the life because that was the
[1:39:10] purpose of the blood was to give us the
[1:39:12] life that was inside of it amen the life
[1:39:14] of that blood is what makes us live as
[1:39:15] Sons and Daughters of God in 1
[1:39:17] Corinthians 12 it says for as the body
[1:39:19] is one and has many members so our
[1:39:21] bodies are a single unit but they have
[1:39:23] lots of
[1:39:24] Parts
[1:39:25] millions billions if you go down to the
[1:39:28] the cellular
[1:39:29] level billions of Parts but even all
[1:39:31] your your digits and stuff we're one
[1:39:33] body but we've got all these little
[1:39:34] Parts he says and all the members of
[1:39:36] that one body being many are one
[1:39:39] body see my pinky can say I'm Jonathan
[1:39:43] klet anybody that just looks at the
[1:39:45] pinky if I take a picture of my pinky
[1:39:49] nobody would say that's Jonathan klette
[1:39:51] but the pinky knows he's Jonathan klet
[1:39:54] and that's what he's saying he's saying
[1:39:55] the body of Christ is the same thing he
[1:39:56] says so also is Christ people will look
[1:39:59] at you and they'll say that's just the
[1:40:01] person but they can't see the full
[1:40:03] picture was which is you're a part of
[1:40:05] the body of Christ he says and that's
[1:40:06] what you are you're not the whole thing
[1:40:08] you're just a part of it but you are him
[1:40:12] you're in him he says Christ has many
[1:40:15] members many portions many elements he
[1:40:18] says for by one Spirit we're all
[1:40:20] baptized into one body so how are we
[1:40:22] placed in Christ Christ how are we
[1:40:24] positioned how are we restored back to
[1:40:26] Christ it's by the Holy Spirit by the
[1:40:29] spirit that he gave up at Calvary he
[1:40:31] says whether we be Jews or Gentiles
[1:40:32] whether we be Bond or free he says we
[1:40:35] have been all made to drink into one
[1:40:37] Spirit doesn't matter where you come
[1:40:39] from what your background is religious
[1:40:41] not religious Christian agnostic
[1:40:42] atheistic whatever it doesn't matter he
[1:40:44] says when you come into Christ it comes
[1:40:46] by one way and that is by the Life of
[1:40:48] Christ it is by the Holy Spirit coming
[1:40:50] back into us and we see what happened 50
[1:40:53] days after Christ rose from the dead on
[1:40:55] the day of Pentecost that life came down
[1:40:56] on 120 people and it was God
[1:40:59] redistributing himself now into the
[1:41:01] members of his body it's a multi-member
[1:41:03] body now he says for the body is not one
[1:41:06] member but many where's Christ
[1:41:09] today everyone would point to the man
[1:41:11] 2,000 years ago they would point to he's
[1:41:13] sitting up there and he's waiting for
[1:41:15] this Kingdom to be given to him that's
[1:41:17] not what Paul says Paul says his body's
[1:41:20] right here and you're a part of it and
[1:41:22] I'm a part of of it what by the baptism
[1:41:25] of the Holy Spirit we are the body he is
[1:41:28] the head amen Christ has a body it's a
[1:41:31] multi-member body and you won't ever see
[1:41:33] all of him by seeing one portion of that
[1:41:35] body but when they get together you can
[1:41:36] see
[1:41:37] him that's why we come together that's
[1:41:41] what sets an atmosphere here is that
[1:41:42] there's more of Christ here if I can put
[1:41:44] it that way if you can understand it
[1:41:46] that way there's more of him so people
[1:41:47] can come in and see Christ here maybe a
[1:41:49] little easy more easily than they do if
[1:41:51] they just see me or they just see you
[1:42:53] you could walk there and bump your head
[1:42:54] against it but if the spirit of God is
[1:42:56] in there the spirit of God will unhinge
[1:42:58] the doors he says you've got to have the
[1:43:00] thing in here to unlock it
[1:43:03] Yonder now he says now here he comes
[1:43:06] torn Riven tore to Pieces his soul went
[1:43:10] to God and God blessed him and then his
[1:43:13] soul returned back in the form of the
[1:43:15] baptism of the holy spirit that comes
[1:43:17] into every believer now here's the work
[1:43:19] of it to sanctify to clean up the mind
[1:43:22] to clean up the heart and then here's
[1:43:24] the infilling to leave a portion of the
[1:43:26] Holy Ghost in there here and there and
[1:43:29] here and there and here and there and
[1:43:33] here and there a portion not the
[1:43:35] fullness a portion a portion of
[1:43:40] perfection he says and when the Holy
[1:43:42] Ghost is given
[1:43:43] out because remember every one that's in
[1:43:46] the Covenant has to have a part of the
[1:43:48] Covenant and he's saying the Holy Ghost
[1:43:50] is a part of the Covenant and without
[1:43:52] that
[1:43:53] you can't go in he says and when our
[1:43:56] holy go when the Holy Ghost is given out
[1:43:58] that same holy spirit that brought the
[1:44:00] body of Jesus out of the Grave will
[1:44:02] Rapture it'll Rapture us he says and
[1:44:04] that Covenant Hast a dovetail remember
[1:44:07] it's got to match up what came what was
[1:44:09] torn apart has to be put back together
[1:44:11] again so he says whatever you come with
[1:44:13] has to match with what got torn out
[1:44:14] originally whatever wrote The Covenant
[1:44:16] has to be back there again all the
[1:44:18] pieces have to match that Covenant has
[1:44:20] to dovetail as he tore there and gave
[1:44:22] the body went back to God and the Spirit
[1:44:24] came back to the Earth he says then your
[1:44:27] spirit will have to be the same kind of
[1:44:28] a spirit or it'll miss that place going
[1:44:31] together he says amen yes sir not
[1:44:33] because you make yourself but because
[1:44:35] something the love of God has swept into
[1:44:38] your soul that's tore every Earthly Idol
[1:44:40] out he says there it is that's the
[1:44:43] working of the Holy Spirit that's the
[1:44:45] effect of the Holy Spirit he says and
[1:44:46] there's something that just breathes and
[1:44:48] calls to God he says it's your soul in
[1:44:51] here calling out to the heaven father
[1:44:54] there you are that gives you faith and
[1:44:56] you become a the Seed of
[1:44:58] Abraham you always were but what does it
[1:45:00] do it produces the life that was in that
[1:45:02] seed he says you believe God's promise
[1:45:04] like Abraham did and though it lingered
[1:45:07] yet you believe
[1:45:09] it we're waiting on a resurrection we're
[1:45:11] waiting on a Rapture we're waiting on a
[1:45:13] changing of our bodies but our faith
[1:45:15] ought not to be wavering this morning
[1:45:18] why because we have the earnest of the
[1:45:20] Covenant he says faithful Abraham St not
[1:45:23] at the promise of God through unbelief
[1:45:25] but was strong giving praise to God that
[1:45:28] Holy Spirit that God gives you when he
[1:45:31] receives your confession and your
[1:45:32] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ is
[1:45:34] his sign to you that you're going to
[1:45:37] make it the greatest Revelation you can
[1:45:40] have today is that I have the Holy
[1:45:42] Spirit not just something on me I've got
[1:45:45] something in me that when I walk out
[1:45:47] these Church doors I live the same life
[1:45:49] out there that I do in here and that
[1:45:51] it's calling me and that it's p pulling
[1:45:53] me and that it's drawing me and that
[1:45:54] it's Lifting me it's inspiring me it's
[1:45:56] correcting me to come back to the
[1:45:58] fullness of the word living out in my
[1:46:00] life that's the greatest thing you can
[1:46:02] have is that Holy Spirit living inside
[1:46:05] of you making you live the life of a
[1:46:07] Believer that's the separation between
[1:46:09] religion and Christianity is the Holy
[1:46:11] Ghost that's it that's
[1:46:14] it sons of God are led by the spirit of
[1:46:17] God Christianity is Christ calling you
[1:46:20] back to
[1:46:21] him with the same pieces that were torn
[1:46:23] out of him at Calvary the full word the
[1:46:27] full blood the Holy Spirit that's the
[1:46:30] portion of the Covenant that we each
[1:46:31] need and it's a life-changing event you
[1:46:33] can never be the same you get the Holy
[1:46:35] Ghost you cannot be the same as you were
[1:46:37] before cuz it's not your life now it's
[1:46:39] his life it's Christ in you he says
[1:46:42] there's none good but God but God is in
[1:46:45] the people that makes them good that
[1:46:49] marks the perfect man he says it's God
[1:46:51] in you that makes it perfect see be
[1:46:53] therefore perfect even as your father in
[1:46:55] Heaven is perfect how can you be perfect
[1:46:58] not in yourself but in him God doesn't
[1:47:02] look at you then he looks at him well
[1:47:04] you say I'm in him how do you get in him
[1:47:06] by one Spirit we're all baptized into
[1:47:09] one body and then you're in him when
[1:47:11] you're baptized by the Holy Spirit into
[1:47:13] the body he says and if a man comes the
[1:47:16] worshipper correctly before Christ
[1:47:18] seeing his suffering and he offers
[1:47:20] himself to Christ and says oh Lord God
[1:47:22] there's nothing nothing in me that can
[1:47:24] atone but I am Holy depending on you he
[1:47:29] says then the Holy Spirit comes into the
[1:47:31] human heart and the Very s question is
[1:47:34] settled
[1:47:36] forever for every desire of sin has been
[1:47:40] taken from you for if the law had done
[1:47:42] that those sacrifices would not have had
[1:47:44] to cease but being there that it could
[1:47:47] not do it he says Christ had to die to
[1:47:50] make us
[1:47:51] perfect he says it settled the sining
[1:47:54] question
[1:47:56] forever if God says it's
[1:47:58] settled then what do we say when other
[1:48:01] people bring it up what do we do when
[1:48:03] Satan comes knocking on your door and
[1:48:05] says I saw what you did last night I saw
[1:48:08] what you said hey here's a bad one I saw
[1:48:11] what you
[1:48:12] thought Believers don't think like
[1:48:17] that what do you
[1:48:19] say Satan where's your keys
[1:48:24] Satan do you can you even lock your door
[1:48:26] anymore Satan where's your
[1:48:30] power where's the hold that you used to
[1:48:32] have Satan start talking back to him
[1:48:34] about what he looks like start talking
[1:48:36] back to him about his position and say
[1:48:38] when Christ accepted
[1:48:40] me you lost all authority in my life he
[1:48:43] paid the
[1:48:45] price I ain't perfect he doesn't expect
[1:48:49] me to be perfect that's why he paid a
[1:48:51] price go go look at what he did at
[1:48:53] Calvary you ought to remember that day
[1:48:55] cuz that's the day you lost every power
[1:48:56] and authority you had on this Earth and
[1:48:58] over me you remind him the blame for
[1:49:01] this is going back to you buddy it rests
[1:49:04] on your shoulders now I'm sinless I'm
[1:49:07] perfect he's accepted me he's living in
[1:49:10] me now we're sitting in a work in a
[1:49:13] place of perfection because of the work
[1:49:15] of Christ today right
[1:49:18] now unworthy yet there we sit Hebrews 10
[1:49:23] Paul would say now where remission of
[1:49:25] sin is of these is there is no more
[1:49:27] offering for sin he says when sin's
[1:49:29] forgiven you don't have to keep going
[1:49:31] back and doing it over and over again
[1:49:32] you don't have to keep going back and
[1:49:34] saying I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry
[1:49:36] here's more blood here's more blood
[1:49:37] here's more blood he says Christ has
[1:49:39] covered it once it's done you don't have
[1:49:42] to go make a sacrifice you have to say
[1:49:43] you're sorry but you don't have to make
[1:49:44] a sacrifice you don't have to beat
[1:49:46] yourself up we don't have to keep trying
[1:49:48] to make amends that's the Catholic way
[1:49:51] make amends
[1:49:54] pay a price myself no he paid the price
[1:49:56] so we don't have to that we can say I'm
[1:49:58] sorry in sincerity repent walk away and
[1:50:01] go
[1:50:02] free and look at the effect of this he
[1:50:04] says having therefore Brethren boldness
[1:50:07] to enter into the holiest of holies by
[1:50:09] the blood of Jesus Remember in the Old
[1:50:11] Testament only one man a high priest
[1:50:13] could go in one day a year and he had to
[1:50:15] come in with blood and he went in
[1:50:19] tentatively he went in carefully he was
[1:50:22] glanced he was dressed perfect he was
[1:50:24] walking perfect everything remember the
[1:50:27] scripture says it has to be holy holy
[1:50:30] holy his actions could cause him to
[1:50:34] die Paul says we have
[1:50:37] boldness if I've got boldness what do I
[1:50:39] do I say how we doing that's
[1:50:43] boldness I'm not sitting there
[1:50:46] saying is he going to strike me am I
[1:50:49] acceptable Paul says boldness to enter
[1:50:52] into the presence of God boldness why
[1:50:56] because now you've been invited when he
[1:50:59] opens the
[1:51:00] door that's the invitation when he tears
[1:51:04] the veil that's the invitation when he
[1:51:07] calls that's the invitation and I've got
[1:51:09] boldness not in myself but I've got
[1:51:11] boldness because he opens the door and
[1:51:13] he says come into my presence and don't
[1:51:16] ever leave it you don't have to leave it
[1:51:18] you know how I know I don't have to
[1:51:19] leave it because he's living in me Jesus
[1:51:23] said pray to the god that is within you
[1:51:25] you are the Tabernacle of the Living
[1:51:28] God he lives in me he dwells in me so I
[1:51:32] can come boldly to the throne because
[1:51:34] he's he's opted he's chosen to be right
[1:51:38] here day in and day out I don't have to
[1:51:41] bring them down I don't have to lift
[1:51:43] them up I can in simple Faith say God I
[1:51:46] have a need God I've got a
[1:51:49] question God I've got a situation or my
[1:51:53] brother and sister does and he's right
[1:51:55] there I can boldly enter into his throne
[1:51:57] with a simple prayer that's all there is
[1:52:00] to
[1:52:01] it no restrictions no penalties remember
[1:52:04] in Esther when the the the the the
[1:52:07] advisers to the king said set up a rule
[1:52:10] that nobody can come in you're so great
[1:52:12] nobody should just be able to walk in
[1:52:14] you should have judgment over those that
[1:52:16] come in so here's the Rule King here's
[1:52:18] what we're going to do is if somebody
[1:52:20] comes into your presence and you didn't
[1:52:21] invite them then you can extend the
[1:52:24] scepter and if you extend the scepter
[1:52:26] they live if you hold it back we'll kill
[1:52:28] them on the spot that's the
[1:52:31] law but Paul says no no no he says
[1:52:33] having boldness to enter into the
[1:52:35] holiest holies how by the blood of
[1:52:38] Christ once and for all sin set sin was
[1:52:41] settled forever he says how by a New and
[1:52:45] Living Way see it used to be you came in
[1:52:48] by death something had to die to come in
[1:52:52] Paul says now this way is a new way it's
[1:52:53] a living
[1:52:55] way it's by life now we come into God's
[1:52:57] Presence by life not by death death paid
[1:53:00] the price but we come in now alive amen
[1:53:02] it's his spirit it's the token of the
[1:53:04] holy spirit that we come in with and say
[1:53:06] this token that you gave me is the
[1:53:08] living way and that's what brings me
[1:53:10] into your presence he says by a New and
[1:53:12] Living Way which he hath consecrated for
[1:53:14] us through the veil that is to say is
[1:53:16] flesh and having an high priest over the
[1:53:18] house of God he says let us draw near
[1:53:26] sometimes what's happening in service is
[1:53:28] the spirit of God is moving and you know
[1:53:30] what we
[1:53:32] do we sit
[1:53:34] back don't
[1:53:36] we God's doing something and what do we
[1:53:40] do we might be sitting here in these
[1:53:42] pews but we sit at the
[1:53:46] back and we say that's for
[1:53:50] them Paul didn't say just
[1:53:53] enter in he said draw
[1:53:56] near draw near let us draw near with
[1:54:00] what a True Heart a sincere heart a
[1:54:03] sincere heart he says in what full
[1:54:06] Assurance of our good
[1:54:10] works no full Assurance of Faith why
[1:54:14] having our hearts sprinkled from an evil
[1:54:16] conscience and our bodies washed with
[1:54:18] pure water amen it's his work in us that
[1:54:21] draws us in it's his work that makes us
[1:54:23] accepted it's his work that says you can
[1:54:25] come
[1:54:27] close it's our human nature to pull back
[1:54:31] when we've done
[1:54:33] wrong when my youngest in particular we
[1:54:36] notice this when he does something wrong
[1:54:39] not only will he not come up to me but
[1:54:40] he will hide himself from my
[1:54:43] face if he sees me even look at him he
[1:54:47] hides his face from me because he knows
[1:54:50] he's done
[1:54:51] wrong
[1:54:53] that's a law working in him that's not
[1:54:57] Grace working in him but what happens is
[1:55:00] after he gets
[1:55:01] disciplined he won't draw near to me so
[1:55:04] you know what I do I draw near to him
[1:55:08] and I smile and I try and engage him
[1:55:11] what am i showing him daddy still loves
[1:55:13] you the discipline of Daddy doesn't
[1:55:15] change my love doesn't change your
[1:55:17] access you can do something wrong and
[1:55:19] come right back and ask me for something
[1:55:21] that you need and I'll give it to you
[1:55:23] Paul's saying draw near you've been
[1:55:26] sprinkled with blood you've been covered
[1:55:28] with blood there's nothing to hold you
[1:55:29] back but we sit there and say God I'm
[1:55:31] not
[1:55:32] worthy you know what you did yesterday
[1:55:34] you know what you did last night you
[1:55:36] know what you did on your computer you
[1:55:37] know what you did around your colleagues
[1:55:38] you know what you did with that
[1:55:40] person he says no you're
[1:55:43] sprinkled that conscience that's been
[1:55:46] wiped
[1:55:46] clean he says and if our conscience
[1:55:49] bother us God's still greater than that
[1:55:54] our conscience ought not to keep us back
[1:55:56] but if we have not repented our
[1:55:58] conscience should keep us back but we
[1:56:00] draw near in Repentance a sincere honest
[1:56:03] heart that's how we come in that's how
[1:56:05] we come
[1:56:07] in he says and our bodies washed with
[1:56:10] pure water that means we've applied the
[1:56:13] whole word not just the little bit that
[1:56:15] we like that affirms where we're at but
[1:56:18] the whole word cuz we want the water for
[1:56:19] the dirty spots not the clean spots
[1:56:21] remember the doctor is not for the
[1:56:23] healthy people the doctor is for the
[1:56:25] sick people the word is for the dirty
[1:56:27] spots that's why we need it let's apply
[1:56:29] it to the dirty spots amen we come in
[1:56:32] boldly because the blood of Christ
[1:56:34] covers
[1:56:35] Us Brown say this he says what is it he
[1:56:38] says oh God requires Perfection now
[1:56:40] catch
[1:56:41] this we're talking about coming in with
[1:56:43] a sincere heart True Heart he says he
[1:56:46] requires your repentance he
[1:56:49] does repent and be baptized and you'll
[1:56:51] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost ghost
[1:56:53] he says he requires your loyalty to
[1:56:56] him but he's looking tonight no matter
[1:56:58] how much you sinned how little or how
[1:57:00] much you are still a sinner and you
[1:57:02] cannot get in no other way but by Jesus
[1:57:05] Christ God's all sufficient sacrifice
[1:57:07] and in him you are perfected
[1:57:10] forever he says think of it it's nothing
[1:57:12] you
[1:57:13] do now watch this we've just went
[1:57:17] through New Years not too long ago it's
[1:57:18] not new pages you turn Lord I promise
[1:57:22] this year I'll do better Lord I promise
[1:57:24] I'll do better today Lord I promise next
[1:57:26] week I'll do better it's not a new life
[1:57:29] you start from this day on I will be
[1:57:33] different it's a confession of your
[1:57:36] wrong and God's grace to
[1:57:38] you because without him you're not going
[1:57:40] to change you're not going to turn a new
[1:57:42] page what you'll do is you'll turn a new
[1:57:44] page and then you'll flip it back that's
[1:57:46] what we do as humans he says that brings
[1:57:49] you to Perfection and then you are
[1:57:51] perfected in Jesus Christ he says oh I
[1:57:53] hope you see it it isn't whether you're
[1:57:55] good enough to be a Christian or not
[1:57:57] it's whether he was good enough if God
[1:57:59] accepted him and his blood makes an
[1:58:01] atonement God doesn't see you he sees
[1:58:04] the lamb remember we spoke before about
[1:58:06] when the when the sinner came to the
[1:58:08] priest he brought a
[1:58:10] lamb and the fact that he was coming
[1:58:13] with a lamb identified him as a sinner
[1:58:16] because only Sinners offer sacrifices so
[1:58:18] the fact that you're there the priest
[1:58:20] knew you were a sinner
[1:58:23] but remember he didn't examine the The
[1:58:27] Sinner he knew he was a sinner he knew
[1:58:29] he'd done wrong because he was he was
[1:58:30] present with a sacrifice but he looked
[1:58:32] at the sacrifice and the sacrifice had
[1:58:34] to be perfect it had to be without
[1:58:36] blemish it couldn't have any lumps or
[1:58:38] scars or or fur missing or anything like
[1:58:41] that the sacrifice had to be perfect and
[1:58:43] the only thing that priest looked at was
[1:58:45] that animal he never looked at the one
[1:58:47] that was kneeling before him he only
[1:58:49] looked at the sacrifice he says God
[1:58:52] doesn't see you he sees the lamb he sees
[1:58:54] Christ amen he says Oh my he says that
[1:58:58] was me no good not fit to live worthy to
[1:59:01] go to hell born in a sinful family
[1:59:04] raised a sinner no good at all not one
[1:59:06] sound part about
[1:59:08] me that's right he says but one day I
[1:59:11] accepted Hallelujah when God looked down
[1:59:14] on Christ and Christ took my place then
[1:59:16] God doesn't see me he sees the perfect
[1:59:20] one he says then as long as I'm in here
[1:59:23] in Christ he says in him then I am
[1:59:27] perfected not in myself in him not my
[1:59:32] perfection I don't have any you don't
[1:59:35] have any how are we going to get in it's
[1:59:38] not by anything we've got he says but
[1:59:39] it's his Perfection therefore Jesus
[1:59:42] didn't make a mistake when he said be
[1:59:43] therefore perfect even as your father in
[1:59:45] Heaven is perfect How could a human
[1:59:47] being be perfect he could be perfect by
[1:59:50] his perfect faith resting in him saying
[1:59:53] he paid the price for me
[1:59:57] me you say when I can get quit of
[2:00:02] smoking when I can quit drinking when I
[2:00:04] can straighten this thing up I'll do it
[2:00:06] put yourself there this morning what's
[2:00:08] Satan hanging over your head I'll get
[2:00:10] the Holy Ghost when I quit this or that
[2:00:13] God will accept me when I quit this or
[2:00:15] that no no
[2:00:16] no he says oh it will never be done
[2:00:19] right you'll never be able to do it why
[2:00:21] don't you just come the way you
[2:00:24] are he says and by faith go to that
[2:00:26] stream thy flowing wound suppli them
[2:00:28] redeeming love to be your theme and
[2:00:30] shall be till you die why take a
[2:00:32] substitute try why try to get in by your
[2:00:34] church why try to come in because you
[2:00:36] quit drinking or quit lying see that's
[2:00:38] the human nature is to try and warrant
[2:00:42] it deserve
[2:00:45] it he says he says come by the way of
[2:00:50] perfection for by once sacrifice he has
[2:00:53] perfected forever those that are
[2:00:54] Sanctified how do I get Sanctified he
[2:00:57] says confess your sins in the presence
[2:00:59] of the blood of Jesus and the life that
[2:01:02] come from that blood comes back to the
[2:01:04] worshipper and sanctifies him from the
[2:01:06] desires of the things of the world for
[2:01:08] by that all sufficient
[2:01:11] sacrifice every need supplied church
[2:01:14] it's a complete and total work he says
[2:01:17] he has Sanctified us one Spirit we're
[2:01:19] all baptized into one body now there is
[2:01:21] no condemnation are you under
[2:01:23] condemnation this morning he says there
[2:01:26] is no condemnation to them which are in
[2:01:28] Christ Jesus to them that walk not walk
[2:01:31] not after the flesh but of the spirit he
[2:01:34] says if you're trying to walk by the
[2:01:36] spirit and still lusting for the flesh
[2:01:38] the sacrifice hasn't been sufficiently
[2:01:40] applied to you but that means it can be
[2:01:43] just CU it's not doesn't mean it can't
[2:01:46] be he says but the worshipper once
[2:01:49] purged has no more desire of sin that
[2:01:52] was Calvary he says it isn't a place to
[2:01:54] sell flowers or a little place to do
[2:01:56] this or that it was a place where God
[2:01:58] and man were reconciled what where the
[2:02:01] two pieces went back together
[2:02:04] again where the constituent pieces of
[2:02:06] that Covenant were put and placed and
[2:02:09] ready to be delivered back to humanity
[2:02:12] he said it was the place where peace and
[2:02:14] perfect safety was brought to mankind he
[2:02:17] says can you go with me tonight my
[2:02:19] sinner friend to Calvary and by faith
[2:02:21] apply this this Blood to your own soul
[2:02:23] and let the Holy Ghost come and sanctify
[2:02:25] You by his great sacrifice he says God
[2:02:29] and man were reconciled the parts of the
[2:02:32] Covenant were put back together God's
[2:02:34] work start to
[2:02:35] finish it the working of God he says I
[2:02:38] love this he says the peace and perfect
[2:02:41] safety were brought to
[2:02:43] mankind why do I feel
[2:02:48] discouraged why do we worry why are we
[2:02:53] lacking rest and
[2:02:54] peace because we forget the work that's
[2:02:58] been
[2:02:59] done amen we forget the power of a God
[2:03:02] that says he's going to work all things
[2:03:03] for our good there's a place of perfect
[2:03:06] peace of perfect safety when we step
[2:03:09] back and we say Lord this is your work
[2:03:11] and I'm your
[2:03:13] child and I'm trusting you we can have
[2:03:16] peace in the
[2:03:18] storm he didn't say take away every
[2:03:20] storm but he says we could have peace
[2:03:25] we could only remind ourselves
[2:03:27] daily because Satan is doing everything
[2:03:29] he can to remind us of what we are in
[2:03:32] our
[2:03:33] flesh and this word is trying to remind
[2:03:36] us that we're sitting in Heavenly places
[2:03:37] in Christ today with every blessing and
[2:03:41] benefit that comes with
[2:03:43] it the fruit of the spirit is
[2:03:46] what
[2:03:49] money
[2:03:50] no a
[2:03:52] job a
[2:03:54] spouse a
[2:03:56] career no fruit of the spirit is love
[2:04:01] joy peace patience it's the things we
[2:04:04] need day in and day out and it's not
[2:04:06] just for us it's for the people around
[2:04:08] us I said before when I get snippety
[2:04:11] it's because my relationship is getting
[2:04:12] cold with God and I need to go back and
[2:04:15] spend some time with him it ain't his
[2:04:18] fault I'm like this it's my fault for
[2:04:20] not entering in with boldness
[2:04:22] and laying hold of what he's already
[2:04:23] done for
[2:04:25] us let's go back to Ephesians 1 as we
[2:04:27] start to
[2:04:29] close it says that the god of our Lord
[2:04:31] Jesus Christ the father of Glory may
[2:04:34] give unto you the spirit of wisdom and
[2:04:36] Revelation in the knowledge of him the
[2:04:38] eyes of your understanding being
[2:04:40] enlightened that you may know what is
[2:04:41] the hope of his calling and what the
[2:04:43] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[2:04:46] in the Saints and what is the exceeding
[2:04:48] greatness of his power to usw who
[2:04:51] believe according to the working of his
[2:04:53] mighty power you know what your part is
[2:04:55] in there it's not power it's not
[2:04:59] greatness it's Faith believe I was
[2:05:03] reading a quote where brother Bram says
[2:05:04] God will do God can do anything you
[2:05:05] believe him to do that's pretty powerful
[2:05:09] it can't be contrary to his word of
[2:05:10] course but if you can believe it God can
[2:05:12] do it remember what Jesus said to the
[2:05:14] man all things have all things are
[2:05:16] possible if thou can't believe it's a
[2:05:18] scriptural thing if you can believe God
[2:05:20] will do it then God will do it if it's
[2:05:21] it's according to his word and it's not
[2:05:23] contradictory to it but where is this
[2:05:25] exceeding greatness and where is the
[2:05:27] power he says it's which he wrought in
[2:05:29] Christ when he raised him from the dead
[2:05:32] and set him at his own right hand in the
[2:05:34] Heavenly
[2:05:35] places this is where Christ sits he says
[2:05:39] far above all
[2:05:41] principality and power and might and
[2:05:44] dominion and every name that is named
[2:05:47] not only in this world but also in that
[2:05:49] which is to come and hath put all things
[2:05:52] under his feet and gave him to be the
[2:05:55] head over all things to the church which
[2:05:58] is his body the fullness that filth of
[2:06:02] him that filth all in all we've said
[2:06:06] this
[2:06:08] before if Christ is the head and we are
[2:06:10] the body and it says all things are
[2:06:12] under his feet where does that put
[2:06:15] us relative to all
[2:06:19] things because if you're just the little
[2:06:21] Pinky on his foot all powers all
[2:06:25] principalities all mights all dominions
[2:06:27] are still under
[2:06:28] you if you're just that scuffed up rough
[2:06:31] piece of skin on the ball of his big toe
[2:06:34] yet every in Satan's kingdom is under
[2:06:38] you today that's where you're standing
[2:06:41] that's what the atonement did was it
[2:06:44] placed you back into your original
[2:06:46] position it made a way back for you to
[2:06:48] sit there to stand there to rest there
[2:06:50] and say I'm in in him and in him
[2:06:53] everything is under me no matter which
[2:06:56] position I'm in no matter how great I am
[2:06:58] no matter how small I am no matter how
[2:07:00] much people think of me or see of me yet
[2:07:02] everything in Satan's kingdom is under
[2:07:04] me because I'm in his
[2:07:06] body as a part of Christ he would say
[2:07:09] when Adam's race stood demons Marching
[2:07:12] In from every side prophets had failed
[2:07:14] the law had failed sacrifice of bows and
[2:07:16] lambs have failed man's nature had
[2:07:18] failed everything and Adam's little race
[2:07:21] stood defeated outnumbered by Devils
[2:07:23] Superstition sicknesses diseases there
[2:07:26] was one stepped out in heaven and said
[2:07:28] this day I'll die for Adam's race he
[2:07:30] says and he came to the Earth and was
[2:07:32] made flesh he looked right down in the
[2:07:33] midst where the midst of the spears was
[2:07:36] the darkest the very darkest of all
[2:07:38] men's dreads was death and he took death
[2:07:41] into his bosom he's relating the story
[2:07:43] of uh Arie Von Winkle Reed I think it is
[2:07:46] you know where he said I die for
[2:07:47] Switzerland he ran to the place where
[2:07:49] the spears were greatest and he impaled
[2:07:51] them and it shocked the enemy so badly
[2:07:53] and it inspired the men around them so
[2:07:54] much that they had a great Victory and
[2:07:56] they've never had a war there ever since
[2:07:58] he says Christ did that the thing that
[2:08:00] we feared most he says I'll take
[2:08:02] that he says and on Calvary he paid the
[2:08:05] sacrifice and screamed make a way for
[2:08:07] Liberty and he screams to his church
[2:08:10] take this which I have left you my blood
[2:08:13] and my spirit and fight with whatever
[2:08:15] you've
[2:08:16] got because what you've got a covenant
[2:08:18] now you've got the pieces of the
[2:08:20] Covenant you've got the blood you've got
[2:08:22] the word and you've got the spirit if
[2:08:25] you have those three he says fight with
[2:08:27] ever what you've got we can conquer
[2:08:30] tonight through that friend you can
[2:08:32] drive the devil from you every old enemy
[2:08:35] that's in your life it can be drove out
[2:08:38] by the power of the blood and the spirit
[2:08:39] of Christ and you can stand in his
[2:08:41] presence Christ made the
[2:08:44] way this is the notes that I don't have
[2:08:47] time for today is under that atonement
[2:08:51] it un locks your authority to deal with
[2:08:53] Satan as Christ
[2:08:59] did see we have the earnest of eternal
[2:09:03] life by the Holy
[2:09:05] Spirit but that means it trumps every
[2:09:08] Earnest that Satan tries to put in here
[2:09:10] what is sickness it's the down payment
[2:09:13] of death isn't
[2:09:14] it so if life is in us then death has to
[2:09:17] go we sang the song he's in the house
[2:09:19] when the Holy Spirit came back you've
[2:09:21] got the water you've got the blood now
[2:09:22] the spirit's in there then it is there
[2:09:24] to take preeminence over everything in
[2:09:26] your life and if Satan is trying to put
[2:09:29] it in then the power of God the spirit
[2:09:30] of God is there to put it out that's
[2:09:32] what the fullness of the atonement does
[2:09:34] is it restores you back to every right
[2:09:36] and every position and every blessing
[2:09:38] that you had in your origin that's what
[2:09:40] it's there for and you don't have to
[2:09:43] pull it down you don't have to wait for
[2:09:45] a super Ministry to come in you don't
[2:09:46] even have to wait for your pastor and
[2:09:48] Elder you can do it he says you
[2:09:52] he says every old enemy that's in your
[2:09:54] life it can be driven out by the
[2:09:57] blood remember brother Brandon when he
[2:09:59] would go through the prayer lines and
[2:10:01] people would come up if it wasn't under
[2:10:03] the blood what would he say make it
[2:10:06] right he says your sin can hold back
[2:10:09] your healing you know you're doing wrong
[2:10:12] confess it and he would pull that person
[2:10:14] aside and he would speak quietly to them
[2:10:16] so nobody else would know and then he'd
[2:10:17] say you and if they could make it right
[2:10:19] there then they would and then he'd pray
[2:10:20] for them
[2:10:22] but remember there was a one that came
[2:10:25] up and somebody asked brother Bram they
[2:10:27] said what was it that held him back he
[2:10:29] says I don't know it's under the
[2:10:33] blood God can't remember it a prophet
[2:10:35] sure can't see it amen you come up and
[2:10:38] you take care of that by the blood then
[2:10:40] the spirit can go to work you've got to
[2:10:43] apply the blood you've got to accept the
[2:10:44] blood but when that's done then the
[2:10:46] spirit can
[2:10:47] flow because you're in your position
[2:10:49] you're in Christ he says the sinner
[2:10:52] don't have to wonder anymore whether he
[2:10:53] can be saved or not the sick man doesn't
[2:10:56] have to wonder whether he can be healed
[2:10:57] or not the opening Veil on that day at
[2:11:00] Calvary revealed the way to Total
[2:11:03] Victory God gave us the powers of his
[2:11:05] Spirit to live triumphantly over all
[2:11:07] these things he asks us only to believe
[2:11:11] it he says that happened on that day at
[2:11:14] Calvary there never was a day like it
[2:11:16] there never will be one like it it's not
[2:11:18] necessary no more the price is paid and
[2:11:20] we are redeemed
[2:11:21] thanks be to God he says we are redeemed
[2:11:23] there's no more you have to wonder about
[2:11:26] are you wondering this morning is it for
[2:11:29] me why do they have it and I don't have
[2:11:32] it don't wonder it's for you under the
[2:11:37] atonement remember under that sacrifice
[2:11:39] when Abraham did it he had the pigeon
[2:11:40] and the dove he said it was never torn
[2:11:42] apart to show that Divine Healing has
[2:11:44] always been available salvation is
[2:11:46] available the Holy Ghost is available
[2:11:48] there's none held back to the children
[2:11:50] of God
[2:11:52] he says there's no more you have to
[2:11:53] wonder about there's no more guessing
[2:11:55] about it it's all took away the veil
[2:11:57] pulled back the curtain and were set on
[2:11:59] a highway not to wonder anymore but to
[2:12:02] believe and just walk right
[2:12:05] on he says we walk right into God's very
[2:12:09] presence amen God bless you let's stand
[2:12:11] this
[2:12:14] morning church if he has said there's a
[2:12:16] way
[2:12:17] made I want to walk in that way I don't
[2:12:20] want to sit back I don't want to hold
[2:12:22] back I want to draw near amen I want to
[2:12:25] lay hold of him I want to be in his
[2:12:26] presence I want to be under the the
[2:12:28] power and the anointing of his Spirit
[2:12:29] day in and day out I don't want to live
[2:12:32] a dead Christian life I don't want to
[2:12:33] live a formal life but I want to live
[2:12:36] amen if there's life in me then I need
[2:12:37] to be living and I want to be living and
[2:12:39] I want to see that coming out in my life
[2:12:42] amen to not sit there and just say well
[2:12:44] that's just my lot no your lot is to
[2:12:48] overcome and it's by believing in a
[2:12:50] perfect word in a perfect sacrifice that
[2:12:52] he paid a price and that price was
[2:12:56] accepted God was satisfied with it the
[2:12:58] debts been paid and under that nothing
[2:13:01] is held back from us nothing is held
[2:13:03] back and you see it on the day of
[2:13:04] Pentecost what happened nothing was held
[2:13:07] back nothing they raised the dead they
[2:13:10] healed the sick they preached the word
[2:13:12] they went through troubles they went
[2:13:13] through trials they went to prison they
[2:13:15] were delivered from prison and yet they
[2:13:17] laid down their lives willingly as well
[2:13:18] nothing was held back what was it it was
[2:13:20] the Full Sacrifice the full atonement in
[2:13:23] them they were living under the promise
[2:13:26] of a full atonement nothing held back no
[2:13:30] Bulls no Goats No beating yourselves up
[2:13:32] no wondering does he love me no
[2:13:34] wondering will he heal me no wondering
[2:13:35] will he save me he was doing it and he
[2:13:39] keeps doing it and he keeps doing it and
[2:13:41] he keeps doing it and what happened is
[2:13:42] through seven Church ages what happened
[2:13:44] we fell out of it but now we're coming
[2:13:47] right back into it and we're right back
[2:13:50] under the fullness of that atment cuz
[2:13:52] remember it's water word blood and
[2:13:56] spirit we've got a full word the blood
[2:13:59] never lost its power that means the
[2:14:01] spirit's there to enforce
[2:14:03] it what holds us back if thou can't
[2:14:06] believe all things are possible it's for
[2:14:08] me it's for you tonight amen he said it
[2:14:12] he says we walk right into God's very
[2:14:14] presence when we're in his
[2:14:16] presence brother B we talk about the
[2:14:18] unrecognized presence of God
[2:14:22] I spoke on this when I was in BC a
[2:14:23] couple months ago if we come to church
[2:14:26] and it's just church you know what we'll
[2:14:29] get
[2:14:31] church but if we come in and say we're
[2:14:33] here to meet with
[2:14:36] God it'll change
[2:14:38] everything I was talking with brother
[2:14:40] Joe
[2:14:41] yesterday and I said I've got to be very
[2:14:43] careful because what happens I'm a
[2:14:45] Groove person I get into ruts I call I
[2:14:47] don't call them ruts I call it
[2:14:49] discipline that's my spiritualizing my
[2:14:52] flaw my one
[2:14:57] flaw but see what happens is you can get
[2:14:59] so caught up in the duty of being a
[2:15:01] Christian that you forget you're
[2:15:03] supposed to be Christ that you're
[2:15:05] supposed to be led by the spirit that
[2:15:07] he's supposed to be flowing through you
[2:15:10] and so it's not just studying for
[2:15:12] service it's not just preaching but it's
[2:15:15] supposed to be the power of God that
[2:15:18] foolishness of preaching is supposed to
[2:15:20] be the power of God
[2:15:21] it's supposed to be Christ it's supposed
[2:15:23] to be the Holy Spirit speaking not a man
[2:15:25] not
[2:15:27] intellect so I've got to come that way
[2:15:30] but you've got to come in the same way
[2:15:31] that it's not going to be brother
[2:15:33] John that the holy spirit's going to
[2:15:35] speak to me and we've seen him do it but
[2:15:39] that's an everyday
[2:15:42] thing here's the
[2:15:45] thing so
[2:15:47] often we let ourselves
[2:15:50] slide
[2:15:51] and we have to go ways before we
[2:15:54] realize I'm not where I need to be and
[2:15:57] I'm talking like some big backsliding
[2:15:59] but the thing is if you're not going
[2:16:00] forward you're going
[2:16:02] backward and you start to realize I
[2:16:04] conquered this three days ago I
[2:16:06] conquered this last week I conquered
[2:16:07] this last month why is it still here
[2:16:10] it's because we've cooled off it's
[2:16:12] because we're trying to be
[2:16:14] Christians rather than just letting
[2:16:16] Christ live through US letting that
[2:16:18] Spirit flow through US amen and I'm not
[2:16:20] chastising you this morning I'm talking
[2:16:21] about myself amen but our approach our
[2:16:24] expectation is set on where our faith
[2:16:27] is amen and how do I get Faith I get
[2:16:30] Faith by reading this by hearing this by
[2:16:32] looking at this by listening to anointed
[2:16:34] men speak it and when I do that I find
[2:16:37] that all of a sudden things get a whole
[2:16:39] lot clearer things get a whole lot
[2:16:41] simpler the focus comes back the purpose
[2:16:43] comes back and the Victory comes with it
[2:16:47] because what now you're walking into his
[2:16:49] presence now you're walking on his road
[2:16:51] now you're walking his path now you're
[2:16:53] in his will and all of a sudden the
[2:16:56] things of this earth grow strangely dim
[2:16:58] in the light of his glory and grace amen
[2:17:02] that's what the atonement does applied
[2:17:04] daily living daily through us under
[2:17:07] that if we could see it I think we'd
[2:17:09] live in a lot more
[2:17:11] Victory I'd think we'd see listen God
[2:17:14] doesn't stop because we don't see things
[2:17:17] but I believe we'll recognize his
[2:17:18] presence and we'll recognize his moving
[2:17:20] if we're in the spirit a little more
[2:17:23] that we recognize we're Sons and
[2:17:25] Daughters of God not just in church not
[2:17:28] just because we're under the hearing or
[2:17:29] the preaching of the word but we are it
[2:17:31] because he's in us he's with us day in
[2:17:33] and day out trying to work through US
[2:17:35] amen amen let's bow our
[2:17:38] heads Heavenly
[2:17:41] Father Lord your Prophet
[2:17:43] said we live under our
[2:17:46] privileges Lord and the greatest
[2:17:48] privilege we have is knowing you lord
[2:17:51] it's being in your presence Lord It's
[2:17:53] resting under the shed blood of Calvary
[2:17:56] lord it's having a completely open word
[2:17:58] to us and your spirit inside us to
[2:18:01] Quicken it Lord It's the full work of
[2:18:03] the atonement it's all three elements
[2:18:05] Lord to bring us back into your presence
[2:18:08] to bring us back into our full position
[2:18:10] in Christ Lord your word says we're
[2:18:13] there Lord all that's lacking is Faith
[2:18:16] to believe it and act on it Lord to
[2:18:19] trust it Lord to move as we're
[2:18:22] moved Lord to be still as we're told to
[2:18:25] be
[2:18:26] still but Lord I pray if there's any
[2:18:28] holding back from your presence this
[2:18:30] morning Lord if their conscience is
[2:18:32] bothering them if their habits Lord if
[2:18:34] those things that are besetting them
[2:18:36] this morning Lord I pray that they would
[2:18:37] give it up this morning Lord that they
[2:18:39] would say there's a victory in
[2:18:42] confession Lord there's a rest under
[2:18:44] that blood where he looks at you and
[2:18:46] Lord he doesn't look at us as
[2:18:49] Sinners Lord but he sees the perfect one
[2:18:52] Lord and then he puts that very life
