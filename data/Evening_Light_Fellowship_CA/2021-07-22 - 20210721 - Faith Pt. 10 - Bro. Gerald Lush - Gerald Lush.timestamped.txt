[46:16] then the all the anointing came down
[46:18] because why
[46:19] well even william booth the
[46:21] the old-fashioned salvation army and and
[46:24] the the early preachers in in the in the
[46:27] army they were calling for what they had
[46:29] on the day of pentecost amen see the
[46:32] problem of god said god always says the
[46:34] holy ghost to create in the hearts of
[46:36] his children he said for what he for
[46:38] what they want and what they need amen
[46:41] so you'll create a new a hunger and a
[46:43] thirst and a prayer and amen you're
[46:45] gonna you're gonna call for what what
[46:47] god wants to what you need really amen
[46:50] so brother god sent that call in
[46:52] luther's life for justification
[46:55] wesley sanctification the pentecostals
[46:57] the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts
[46:59] of the spirit amen they began to call
[47:02] for it god sent it amen but brother
[47:05] sister what what is god
[47:07] putting us to call for
[47:08] what it was in your heart what's in your
[47:10] soul what's in your spirit amen what's
[47:12] in the message amen that god has given
[47:14] the end time bride
[47:16] brother again
[47:18] the end time faith that god's looking
[47:20] for is resurrection and rapture
[47:22] amen so i pray the grace of god that as
[47:25] a result of father
[47:26] of the prophetic ministry as a result of
[47:29] the ministry that that's
[47:31] carrying that message on whether it's
[47:33] our brother jonathan ourselves here amen
[47:36] brother sister in the ministries around
[47:38] the world
[47:39] brother amen i tell you what it's doing
[47:41] it's giving the bride faith
[47:43] amen look up
[47:45] amen brother is creating a greater and a
[47:48] greater and a greater faith for the
[47:49] resurrection and the rapture but
[47:52] unfortunately the number is getting
[47:54] smaller and smaller and smaller when it
[47:57] comes to the numbers that are going to
[47:58] have that faith
[48:00] i trust that we're going to be numbered
[48:01] with them because when he comes will he
[48:03] find that faith
[48:04] amen will he find that faith amen it's
[48:08] the faith that he had when he was there
[48:09] in the flesh himself now he said now now
[48:12] is the faith that that brother he's
[48:13] looking for
[48:14] when he's here in the flesh of his bride
[48:16] amen brother as i said it was the
[48:19] redemption of our souls and now brother
[48:21] is the redemption of our bodies
[48:23] he was made flesh to do that he's made
[48:25] flesh to do this
[48:27] so i pray grace that we're we're

[56:33] praise the lord
[56:37] and the grace of god as we go into the
[56:39] word
[56:40] and again faith cometh by hearing the
[56:43] word amen the faith that god wants us to
[56:46] have in this hour brother he's ordained
[56:48] and predestinated the word to give us
[56:50] that faith
[56:52] amen not going back to luther not going
[56:54] back to wesley not going back even to
[56:56] the early pentecostals but brother into
[56:59] this end time word message hallelujah
[57:02] the mystery of god
[57:03] in these last days to give us the faith
[57:07] for the resurrection
[57:08] the faith for the rapture god help us to
[57:11] keep believing what he did in the past
[57:13] amen and brother he's going to add to
[57:15] that faith from saint justification
[57:18] sanctification the baptism of the holy
[57:20] ghost the gifts of the spirit amen but
[57:23] now we're going on further than that to
[57:25] the eternal life
[57:26] praise the name of the lord it's just
[57:28] not focusing on what god has done here
[57:31] amen and brother down through the ages
[57:34] no brother he's focusing on what god has
[57:36] did amen when he came in flesh amen in
[57:40] the flesh of jesus and now focusing on
[57:43] what what he's doing in flesh now that
[57:45] jesus is made flesh in us
[57:47] amen the word is made flesh again
[57:50] amen so let go and let god have his way
[57:54] by the grace of god amen
[57:56] and in the book of luke chapter 18
[58:00] and beginning to read
[58:03] let's see let's maybe start to read at
[58:05] verse 1
[58:06] and he spake a parable unto them to this
[58:09] end
[58:10] that men
[58:12] ought always to pray
[58:14] and not to faint
[58:16] amen stay in fellowship with god
[58:19] stay in communion with god don't be
[58:21] afraid
[58:23] amen rebuke the devil amen and go and
[58:26] talk with the lord
[58:27] and it says saying there was in a city a
[58:31] judge
[58:32] which feared not god
[58:34] neither regarded man
[58:37] and there was a widow in that city
[58:40] and she came under him saying
[58:43] avenge me of mine adversary
[58:47] and he would not for a while but
[58:50] afterward he said within himself though
[58:52] i fear not god as the prophet said god
[58:55] doesn't fear himself
[58:56] and he said nor regard man
[58:59] and yet because this widow troubled me
[59:03] i will avenger
[59:04] amen
[59:06] lest by her continual coming she weary
[59:08] me
[59:10] brother through seven ages amen but in
[59:13] the last age
[59:14] he steps on the scene
[59:16] to provide what she had need of
[59:19] and the lord said hear what the unjust
[59:21] judge saith
[59:24] and shall not god
[59:26] avenge his own elect
[59:29] amen which cry day and night unto him
[59:35] though he bear long with them
[59:38] praise the lord
[59:40] and i tell you
[59:41] that he will avenge them speedily
[59:45] nevertheless he's going to avenge his
[59:47] elect amen
[59:49] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[59:52] shall he find faith on the earth and
[59:55] thank god that our brother scofield here
[59:59] the faith that he referenced is a hope
[1:00:01] is a belief in the whole body of
[1:00:04] revealed truth
[1:00:06] amen so brother sister that's what god's
[1:00:08] looking for now
[1:00:10] and that's what's going to please god
[1:00:11] now that's what's going to bring them on
[1:00:13] the scene with resurrection and
[1:00:15] rapturing faith amen is those that are
[1:00:18] believing in the whole body of revealed
[1:00:20] truth amen that was revealed in christ
[1:00:24] amen and he was the resurrection and the
[1:00:27] rapture and now he's revealed in his
[1:00:29] bride a man to express and reveal again
[1:00:33] the resurrection and the rapture amen
[1:00:36] praise the name of the lord god bless
[1:00:38] you
[1:00:39] so he said again in verse you may be
[1:00:40] seated he said again in verse 8 i tell
[1:00:43] you that he will avenge them speedily
[1:00:46] amen
[1:00:47] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[1:00:49] shall he find faith on the earth because
[1:00:52] there's going to be so few that are left
[1:00:55] here believing
[1:00:56] there's going to be so brother time is
[1:00:58] going to go on to maybe the vast
[1:01:00] majority of so-called believers in what
[1:01:03] god has done and what god is doing
[1:01:05] they'll be going on amen well they'll
[1:01:08] they'll be taken off the earth amen and
[1:01:11] god is going to let it go on and on and
[1:01:13] on and it's been maybe what it's so many
[1:01:15] like 50 years or more since the prophet
[1:01:18] of god has gone it's been 50 years or
[1:01:20] more since the opening of the word the
[1:01:21] revealing of the mystery of god amen
[1:01:25] through through the opening of the word
[1:01:26] and through the prophetic ministry amen
[1:01:29] how much longer will it be amen because
[1:01:32] they and it's the truth because that's
[1:01:34] why that back then that after after in
[1:01:36] 1965 after the prophet of god
[1:01:39] was taken off the scene and and the
[1:01:41] believers back then who were in control
[1:01:43] they they had to go and they had to go
[1:01:45] and and oh yeah put guards around the
[1:01:47] grave
[1:01:48] william write them oh yeah because there
[1:01:50] were those that believed that after
[1:01:52] three days william branham was coming
[1:01:54] was going to be resurrected
[1:01:55] oh yeah that he was going to come back
[1:01:57] and then others believe oh well well
[1:01:59] it'll be it'll be seven days it'll be a
[1:02:01] week or it'll be this number and that
[1:02:03] number and and until finally brother
[1:02:05] sister got to the place where it was
[1:02:07] getting so
[1:02:08] so uh
[1:02:09] crazy there where there these ideas oh
[1:02:12] yeah and the and then this group was
[1:02:14] coming that group was coming to the
[1:02:16] grave another coming to the grave and
[1:02:18] well what were they going to do some of
[1:02:20] them were going to dig the grave
[1:02:22] they're going to dig it up because why
[1:02:24] they want they felt they wanted to prove
[1:02:26] that if they could open the coffin that
[1:02:28] the coffin would be empty oh yeah that's
[1:02:30] what they thought and so that went on
[1:02:32] for a number of years
[1:02:34] amen until finally of course you know
[1:02:36] now you know what they did what they had
[1:02:38] to do they had they had to put that
[1:02:40] pyramid
[1:02:41] over the grave amen because before there
[1:02:44] was just maybe just a marker right the
[1:02:46] grave and just the headstone whatever
[1:02:49] but now it got to the place where so
[1:02:50] that uh to just to discourage
[1:02:53] those believers and all all due respect
[1:02:55] for them you know and so on when it
[1:02:57] comes to they believe the problem of god
[1:02:59] went down but they also believed that
[1:03:01] after three days seven days a week
[1:03:03] whatever three years that he was
[1:03:05] resurrected so they kept going back
[1:03:07] because they wanted to be able to dig it
[1:03:09] up and prove that the coffin was empty
[1:03:12] well i think if you can go back and
[1:03:15] if you want to dig it up and open the
[1:03:16] coffin again he won't be empty
[1:03:19] not not by any means i i don't think
[1:03:21] brother brown was expecting that because
[1:03:23] i believe that that's the body that goes
[1:03:25] back to the dust
[1:03:26] amen and you're going to receive a
[1:03:28] glorified body you're going to say oh
[1:03:30] yeah amen because that one was born in
[1:03:33] sin shaped in iniquity and so on and so
[1:03:36] brother it was under the curse
[1:03:37] and thank god for the grace that
[1:03:40] that god
[1:03:41] gave our prophet amen and the faith that
[1:03:43] he had amen he was looking up
[1:03:46] amen and so he's not there any out amen
[1:03:49] if you went and dig the grave
[1:03:51] just just a day or two after after they
[1:03:53] buried him amen his body would still be
[1:03:56] in the in in the coffin but he wasn't
[1:03:58] there amen not by any means but he was
[1:04:01] in glory waiting on us
[1:04:03] by the grace of god amen because brother
[1:04:06] and sister you know what happened to him
[1:04:08] god showed brother branham what what
[1:04:10] happens when a person dies and of course
[1:04:13] and he was in it he was laying in his
[1:04:15] bed in his bedroom when he looked up no
[1:04:18] and he any any and the oh he got a he
[1:04:20] went into another dimension and oh yeah
[1:04:23] all his body was his physical body was
[1:04:25] still on the bed and he could look back
[1:04:28] and see it but he looked at himself
[1:04:30] going into another dimension amen where
[1:04:32] the saints of god were waiting for him
[1:04:35] amen
[1:04:36] right here and he went in there and he
[1:04:38] had fellowship and he met the angel and
[1:04:41] the angel told him this told him that
[1:04:42] and the angel showed him and showed him
[1:04:44] a
[1:04:45] a a young sister there and uh he always
[1:04:48] said you he didn't know her always said
[1:04:50] she was she was only just a young
[1:04:53] oh no she was not she was around 95
[1:04:55] years old when he said you want you
[1:04:57] letter to the lord
[1:04:58] during your ministry and by showing he
[1:05:00] looked like a young woman
[1:05:02] and he said what yes he said but that's
[1:05:05] the whole she was back there but this is
[1:05:06] what she is here in this dimension amen
[1:05:09] and they were all having this and those
[1:05:12] that were under brother brown's ministry
[1:05:14] amen oh they were all
[1:05:16] get get together in that dimension those
[1:05:18] that had gone on amen brother they were
[1:05:21] fellowshipping one another and then over
[1:05:23] somewhere else with another group that
[1:05:24] was fellowshipping with one another amen
[1:05:27] maybe the pentecostals maybe the
[1:05:28] lutherans maybe the methodists and and
[1:05:31] this group or this revival or that
[1:05:33] revival amen and then there were those
[1:05:35] that were that came under the prophet's
[1:05:37] ministry and here they were in that
[1:05:39] dimension amen and they were in those
[1:05:41] theology bodies and they were philosophy
[1:05:43] one another amen praise the name of the
[1:05:46] lord but why oh yeah because they knew
[1:05:50] what what what they had well they agreed
[1:05:52] on the earth and what oh yeah they had
[1:05:55] this in common that in common they
[1:05:56] believed the message this this one
[1:05:59] believed the message and so on amen so

[1:09:36] brother how much attention do we give to
[1:09:37] the word
[1:09:39] amen whether there's the the thus saith
[1:09:42] the lord the word the bible amen or
[1:09:44] whether it's the reveal the revealed
[1:09:46] word of god the revelation that god has
[1:09:48] given us to a prophet amen how much
[1:09:51] attention are we given to god
[1:09:54] i tell we're living in a world that's
[1:09:55] given a lot more and more and more and
[1:09:57] more attention brother to to the
[1:10:00] internet more and more attention whether
[1:10:02] to the foolishness of man
[1:10:03] but not god
[1:10:05] amen then i've given the attention to
[1:10:08] god and what god has done and what god
[1:10:09] has said amen brother sister but if

[1:10:14] important to you than the world

[1:10:20] interested in it amen brother sister is
[1:10:23] there ever an hour that we should have
[1:10:25] less and less and less interest in what
[1:10:28] the world is printing brother it's this
[1:10:30] hour
[1:10:31] amen because more and more now we
[1:10:33] realize that what we read in the word is
[1:10:35] becoming more and more reality
[1:10:37] amen it's recording more and more yes
[1:10:40] and not only that but it's becoming
[1:10:42] history and brother we're we're getting

[1:10:48] eternity
[1:10:49] oh please i pray god in the name of
[1:10:51] jesus give us the faith that god has
[1:10:53] ordained for us to get through the
[1:10:55] message of the hour
[1:10:58] amen brother i tell you this the faith
[1:10:59] that god that god was was was giving
[1:11:02] through the luther's age and your paul
[1:11:04] rather but luther amen through through
[1:11:06] justification amen they preached it
[1:11:09] morning noon and night and as i said to
[1:11:11] john wesley when he had the message of
[1:11:13] sanctification oh brother he would go
[1:11:16] even he would preach five times a day
[1:11:18] what oh yeah he would go to the to the
[1:11:21] minds there and he would preach to the
[1:11:22] soldier to the workers that were going
[1:11:24] into the mine amen and then he would
[1:11:27] wait for those that were coming out and
[1:11:28] then he'd be there to preach to them
[1:11:30] amen and then he gonna preach to that
[1:11:32] one then they go preach to somebody else
[1:11:34] five times a day he preached amen and
[1:11:37] then there's another time that he would
[1:11:39] go go to a cemetery amen he'd go to a
[1:11:42] church but brother he couldn't go
[1:11:44] preaching the church because there was
[1:11:45] too many
[1:11:46] amen the church wasn't big enough
[1:11:48] so that he would go out into the
[1:11:50] cemetery amen john wesley would and what
[1:11:52] he would do america he never had a
[1:11:55] pulpit oh so he found a he found a
[1:11:59] a headstone amen and he went and found a
[1:12:02] certain headstone there that he could
[1:12:03] stand on and he would get up and get up
[1:12:05] on the the headstone and preached amen
[1:12:09] and then the others would gather all
[1:12:10] around the cemetery and listen to john
[1:12:13] wesley preach amen just think five times
[1:12:16] a day amen and then one time oh yeah
[1:12:19] when it comes to church and services
[1:12:21] we'd have services maybe three four
[1:12:24] times a week amen some would have it
[1:12:26] five times a week in the times of
[1:12:28] revivals that happen almost every night
[1:12:30] amen
[1:12:32] and maybe sometime during the day
[1:12:34] and now it's down to two two times a
[1:12:36] week some maybe three times i don't know
[1:12:39] amen but i tell you it's going to get
[1:12:40] less and less and less because the
[1:12:43] groups are going to get smaller and
[1:12:44] smaller
[1:12:45] amen or and i'll tell you the groups
[1:12:47] that are going to get bigger brother
[1:12:49] forget it they're not
[1:12:51] amen the larger the group the further
[1:12:53] away from the faith they're getting
[1:12:55] amen because he said when he come will
[1:12:57] he find faith on the earth
[1:12:59] amen faith well you think it it oh the
[1:13:02] bigger the church and the bigger the
[1:13:04] number oh my they'll have faith no
[1:13:07] they might have an intellectual faith
[1:13:09] but they won't have a spiritual faith
[1:13:12] amen they might have they might as the
[1:13:14] prophet of god is i i just read it
[1:13:16] somewhere today there where he was
[1:13:18] saying oh yeah i said they're putting
[1:13:19] too much emphasis on it's on on the the
[1:13:22] dynamic
[1:13:24] dynamics to letter
[1:13:27] mechanics yeah that's right they started
[1:13:29] putting they're putting too much
[1:13:30] emphasis and more and more evidence on
[1:13:32] the mechanics of the word and not the
[1:13:34] dynamics
[1:13:36] amen that's the truth well one time the
[1:13:38] emphasis was on the dynamics the power
[1:13:40] of the living word and now it's just the
[1:13:43] letter of the word amen oh this doctrine
[1:13:46] that doctrine amen and as i said there's
[1:13:48] things that are eaten in this message it
[1:13:50] it oh this is this is our creed
[1:13:52] oh yeah oh we uh we believe this we
[1:13:55] believe that amen
[1:13:57] and as i said one night before i say
[1:13:59] when it comes to these these printed
[1:14:00] messages i should just say i i had to
[1:14:03] deal with a lot of believers over over
[1:14:05] the last you know number of years for me
[1:14:07] well say 50 years or more amen and i
[1:14:10] said you know i said when it comes to
[1:14:12] these books i said there's a lot of
[1:14:14] believers that i've dealt with i said
[1:14:16] you know what they should do i said they
[1:14:18] should start at the last page
[1:14:20] not on the first page or the last page
[1:14:22] why because all they're interested in
[1:14:24] was signs and wonders
[1:14:25] amen other interesting was god was what
[1:14:28] god was doing through william branham
[1:14:30] not the revelation of the word but the
[1:14:32] signs and wonders oh yeah the healing
[1:14:35] yeah amen
[1:14:37] and god did this and god did that the
[1:14:39] discernment and this is why a lot of
[1:14:42] churches this is why a lot of groups
[1:14:46] in the ministry of the prophet that's
[1:14:48] why they wanted william branham oh yeah
[1:14:50] and not only that it got to the place
[1:14:52] where where even all due respect to her
[1:14:54] brother oral roberts but he he called
[1:14:57] william ran him aside and he said uh
[1:15:00] brother branham
[1:15:01] and and he said we appreciate the
[1:15:03] ministry and we appreciate this we
[1:15:05] appreciate that but he said brother
[1:15:06] branham he said we want you to get up
[1:15:09] and do this and do this but he said
[1:15:11] you're going to have to stop preaching
[1:15:12] this
[1:15:13] oh yeah
[1:15:15] he was encouraging brother brown to stop
[1:15:17] preaching concerning the sisters and how
[1:15:20] they should act and how they should
[1:15:21] dress and he had to stop preaching
[1:15:23] concerning the brothers how they should
[1:15:24] act and how they should dress amen and
[1:15:27] about being spiritual and not religious
[1:15:30] oh yeah so that's why they wanted they
[1:15:32] wanted brother brown to stop they oh yes
[1:15:34] it was brother roberts
[1:15:36] they called him a sight and says your
[1:15:37] brother brown you'd have to stop it amen
[1:15:39] and because he wouldn't stop it they
[1:15:42] stopped him
[1:15:44] amen they never bothered to have him
[1:15:46] wouldn't wouldn't invite him in their
[1:15:47] services wouldn't have him to do this
[1:15:49] wouldn't happen to do that where as
[1:15:50] before
[1:15:51] before they came to that conclusion oh
[1:15:54] yeah oh yeah they they wanted william
[1:15:56] branham william branham wait a minute oh
[1:15:58] yeah and he'd come in and do this and
[1:16:01] show these signs show these gifts oh
[1:16:03] yeah because that's why a lot of a lot
[1:16:05] of so-called people will go go to old
[1:16:07] robbers meetings that's why they would
[1:16:09] go to te la altar meetings that's the
[1:16:10] way they would go to aal and meetings
[1:16:12] amen and me the other evangelists why
[1:16:15] signs and wonders amen and all and you
[1:16:18] know what they would preach signs and
[1:16:19] wonders
[1:16:20] amen they go in the bible and oh yeah in
[1:16:23] the bible and they would preach about
[1:16:24] jesus and his signs and wonders they
[1:16:26] preached the prophets and their signs
[1:16:28] and wonders oh yeah i i've been under
[1:16:31] those ministries i've experienced those
[1:16:33] ministries amen
[1:16:34] amen and and not not that i did it
[1:16:37] because i was young back then amen but i
[1:16:39] was associated with a lot of so-called
[1:16:42] uh
[1:16:43] uh pentecostals and well they they had a
[1:16:46] pentecostal experience and so on amen
[1:16:49] not necessarily denominational but they
[1:16:51] supported these evangelists they
[1:16:53] supported this avengers that evangelist
[1:16:55] that event oh yeah and i i remember
[1:16:57] going into a certain homes and brother
[1:16:59] and then there was a allen's uh magazine
[1:17:03] it was uh oral robbers magazine it was
[1:17:06] teal osborne's magazine amen oh yeah oh
[1:17:09] yeah signs and wonders god doing this
[1:17:11] god doing that amen but the emphasis was
[1:17:13] on the signs and the wonders but not on
[1:17:16] the word
[1:17:17] amen the only part of the word was the
[1:17:20] word that spoke about signs and wonders
[1:17:22] amen the the word that emphasized oh
[1:17:25] jesus did this god did this the prophet
[1:17:27] did this yeah but not what they said
[1:17:29] what they did
[1:17:31] amen but brother our emphasis is not
[1:17:34] what william branham did is what william
[1:17:36] branham said
[1:17:38] amen is what god said through the
[1:17:40] prophets
[1:17:41] amen and reporting our emphasis on the
[1:17:44] word amen and brother and god elvis that
[1:17:47] we're not going to put our emphasis on
[1:17:49] evangelists and preachers and pastors
[1:17:51] that might go around the world
[1:17:54] amen and they got signs and no wonders
[1:17:56] and they're doing this and they're doing
[1:17:58] that oh yeah
[1:17:59] with and they're message preachers oh

[1:38:37] was pentecost and we just stayed with
[1:38:39] them but we didn't we didn't support
[1:38:40] denomination and so on and finally
[1:38:44] for for me that was i was baptized in
[1:38:46] pentecost in 1965
[1:38:50] yeah december 1965 and it was again in
[1:38:53] the early 1966 that i that i received
[1:38:57] amen because i used to still have
[1:38:58] fellowship with brother sister burns and
[1:39:00] the saints in gamble and finally it's in
[1:39:04] early 1966 i finally
[1:39:07] got witness from them that god has sent
[1:39:10] a prophet no
[1:39:12] they just mentioned to me
[1:39:13] about william branham and sister burns
[1:39:16] oh yeah she was that she she was
[1:39:18] listening to
[1:39:19] the records and not the tapes it was a
[1:39:22] record of william branham's life
[1:39:25] is is his life story yeah
[1:39:28] on a record and that's what's that's the
[1:39:30] first time that sister burns heard
[1:39:32] william branham amen and she was talking
[1:39:34] about always a tremendous brother
[1:39:36] tremendous
[1:39:37] amen wonderful wonderful ministry and
[1:39:40] again not recognizing the messenger to
[1:39:42] the ages or whatever but just
[1:39:44] recognizing that it was that it was god
[1:39:46] amen in the man
[1:39:48] and finally when i got there in the
[1:39:50] summer amen and i spoke to sister goldie
[1:39:52] she said brother i got great news
[1:39:55] and i said what's that she said god has
[1:39:58] set a prophet

[1:41:18] our attention on
[1:41:20] what's it causing us to put our focus on
[1:41:23] amen what's it causing us to pray for
[1:41:25] hunger for amen by the grace of god
[1:41:28] remember they hungered and thirst for
[1:41:30] what god wanted to do

[1:41:42] gave it to him they hungered they
[1:41:44] thirsted for it they went and they
[1:41:45] preached it amen and lived it
[1:41:48] so are we preaching it and living it
[1:41:51] the resurrection
[1:41:53] and the rapture
[1:41:54] amen
[1:41:56] sir are we being caught up
[1:41:58] amen into a spiritual dimension
[1:42:02] by the grace of god
[1:42:04] amen god help us
[1:42:06] amen
[1:42:07] that we're going to walk in the spirit
[1:42:09] amen we're going to live in the spirit
[1:42:12] amen as they did manifesting what god
[1:42:15] had revealed amen so let us do it
[1:42:18] manifesting and confessing what god has
[1:42:20] revealed to us in these last days
[1:42:22] amen and what is it it is the
[1:42:25] resurrection and the rapture and the
[1:42:27] prophet of god has told us he said all
[1:42:29] that god has done and revealed he said
[1:42:31] is to bring us to this place of
[1:42:33] rapturing faith
[1:42:35] amen the conclusion thereof is rapturing
[1:42:38] faith
[1:42:39] god has done this god has done that amen
[1:42:41] that's good praise the lord what what
[1:42:44] faith is it giving you
[1:42:46] oh they gave the others that faith they
[1:42:48] did this they did this they did that
[1:42:50] amen so what are we doing
[1:42:54] yeah
[1:42:54] but the faith that god has given you and
[1:42:56] brothers takes more than just coming to
[1:42:58] church
[1:42:59] oh yeah we're gonna we we oh we go to
[1:43:02] church because you know we believe this
[1:43:04] we believe that but again it's just
[1:43:06] doctrines of theology and so on but is
[1:43:09] it faith
[1:43:10] oh yeah to a lot of people it's just
[1:43:12] just a creed as i said
[1:43:15] this here is creed
[1:43:19] oh this is the part of their creed
[1:43:22] they or perfect faith
[1:43:25] and many many others oh yeah just the
[1:43:27] creed
[1:43:29] just the our creeds of when it comes to
[1:43:32] creeds they have a much larger creed
[1:43:34] than
[1:43:35] those in denomination
[1:43:36] because they got so many of these
[1:43:38] messages
[1:43:39] and so on but brother to the bride
[1:43:42] is not a creed it's a faith
[1:43:45] it's a resurrection
[1:43:47] and a rapturing faith if there's
[1:43:49] anything that god is making more and
[1:43:51] more and more real to us is the
[1:43:53] resurrection and rapture amen the end
[1:43:56] time faith
[1:43:58] is resurrection and rapture
[1:44:01] amen
[1:44:03] and brother it's not a personal faith
[1:44:06] or a personal belief in god
[1:44:08] no
[1:44:09] it is a belief in the whole body of
[1:44:11] revealed truth
[1:44:13] amen because it's ordained to give us
[1:44:16] the faith that god wants us to get the
[1:44:19] resurrection the rapture amen
[1:44:22] brother christ was the whole body of
[1:44:24] revealed truth in flesh
[1:44:26] now the whole body revealed truth is in
[1:44:29] the bride
[1:44:30] amen
[1:44:31] so brother
[1:44:33] the climax of the revelation for the
[1:44:36] elect in this hour is the resurrection
[1:44:38] and the rapture
[1:44:40] if then god is looking for anything in
[1:44:42] you and me
[1:44:44] as a result of the ministry of the word
[1:44:46] it is resurrection and rapturing faith
[1:44:49] amen brother and it is brother it is a
[1:44:53] life that is putting more and more
[1:44:54] emphasis on resurrection and rapture
[1:44:58] you're living for the resurrection
[1:45:00] you're living for the rapture by the
[1:45:02] grace of god you're hungry for the
[1:45:04] resurrection you're hungry for the
[1:45:06] rapture brother because i tell you this
[1:45:08] why did god do this for luther and
[1:45:10] wesley and
[1:45:11] and and those in the early early
[1:45:12] pentecostal age amen because this is
[1:45:15] what they were hungry and thirsting for
[1:45:18] amen
[1:45:19] brother because god revealed this and
[1:45:22] and brother
[1:45:24] where did luther where did wesley get
[1:45:26] the revelation
[1:45:28] of
[1:45:29] sanctification
[1:45:31] he got it
[1:45:33] in a lutheran cottage meeting
[1:45:36] he did
[1:45:37] yes
[1:45:38] he was in a lutheran cottage meeting
[1:45:41] when when a brother was preaching
[1:45:43] concerning
[1:45:45] they were sanctified by faith
[1:45:47] justified by faith justified by faith
[1:45:50] and he what god had revealed to do
[1:45:52] martin luther and john wesley was there
[1:45:54] and and and they were worshiping and he
[1:45:57] stood up and he raised his hands and he
[1:45:59] and he said he said he felt the
[1:46:00] anointing and he said from the crown of
[1:46:03] his head to the souls of his feet
[1:46:05] oh yeah and he said why because he said
[1:46:08] when he was preaching he said say
[1:46:10] justified by faith and this and this and
[1:46:12] this revelation that revelation it
[1:46:14] struck him concerning sanctified amen
[1:46:17] because amen because luther thought that
[1:46:19] he had they had to do this and do this
[1:46:21] and do this amen and god would justify
[1:46:24] him amen but god given the faith jesus
[1:46:26] justified him
[1:46:28] amen amen and john wesley amen and the
[1:46:32] methodists they thought they had to do
[1:46:34] this and do this and do this oh to live
[1:46:36] a sanctified life huh
[1:46:38] to be sanctified no until finally when
[1:46:41] he was in that country's meeting it
[1:46:42] struck him
[1:46:43] oh
[1:46:45] justified by faith or he said we're
[1:46:47] sanctified by faith thank you jesus you
[1:46:49] did it
[1:46:50] amen you did it lord amen oh and
[1:46:54] and and john wesley started to praise
[1:46:56] the lord and he said i felt the
[1:46:57] anointing of sanctification amen go from
[1:47:01] the crown of his head to the souls of
[1:47:02] his feet
[1:47:03] he said jesus sanctified me
[1:47:07] amen he didn't have to get up you know
[1:47:09] what five o'clock or four or five
[1:47:10] o'clock in the morning and pray for two
[1:47:12] or three hours and then they had to go
[1:47:14] through the day and do this and preach
[1:47:16] this often and then he had to pray so
[1:47:18] another couple of hours and he'd go pray
[1:47:20] another couple of hours before they
[1:47:22] before the night time oh yeah that's
[1:47:23] what they that's that's that's what they
[1:47:25] they were trusting for sanctification
[1:47:28] amen
[1:47:29] right
[1:47:30] and like i said luther thought he had to
[1:47:32] go here and go there and he'd walk and
[1:47:34] walk and making sacrifices why because
[1:47:37] he felt that's what he had to do for
[1:47:39] justification
[1:47:40] until god revealed that jesus justified
[1:47:43] him
[1:47:44] amen amen
[1:47:46] amen and
[1:47:48] wesley got the same revelation oh
[1:47:51] oh lord you've sanctified me all right
[1:47:54] already
[1:47:55] oh and if i really got the experience
[1:47:57] it'll go forward and live the sanctified
[1:47:59] life
[1:48:00] not that he had to sanctify this i had
[1:48:02] to think by that god sanctified him
[1:48:05] amen and brothers the same thing with
[1:48:07] the baptist of the holy ghost the gifts
[1:48:09] of the spirit is not what we do it's
[1:48:11] what god does
[1:48:13] amen came with the resurrection rapture
[1:48:15] now what we've done is what god is doing
[1:48:18] amen he wants to he wants to reveal it
[1:48:20] in us make it flesh in us by the grace
[1:48:23] of god

[1:48:44] do it it's just automatic
[1:48:47] amen and see and what is it they were
[1:48:50] spiritual amen that's why luther
[1:48:53] he got the revelation and he went
[1:48:54] through he went forth amen with that
[1:48:56] faith and he lived that sanctif that
[1:48:59] justified life

[1:53:24] that amen down down through these seven
[1:53:26] church ages
[1:53:27] brother and concerning the prophetic
[1:53:29] ministry of this hour oh brother we are
[1:53:32] we are that we ought to have
[1:53:34] eyes to see
[1:53:35] ears to hear or in here not
[1:53:38] ears the ear of the soul
[1:53:41] amen i think brother jonathan brought
[1:53:43] that out
[1:53:44] single ear
[1:53:46] yes
[1:53:47] amen by the grace of
[1:53:52] god your all your your your hearing with
[1:53:56] your ears
[1:53:58] but i trust by grace that it goes when
[1:53:59] it goes into the heart it's it's the
[1:54:01] it's one ear
[1:54:03] amen amen you're going to hear
[1:54:06] with one revelation one understanding
[1:54:09] by the grace of god
[1:54:11] amen don't add to it don't take from it
[1:54:15] amen believe it take your stand for it
[1:54:18] amen
[1:54:19] brother because i tell you this they got
[1:54:21] to a place where where the
[1:54:23] luther's revelation wesley's revelation
[1:54:25] the pentecostal revelation just don't
[1:54:28] have the effect that it used to have
[1:54:30] oh yeah they'll go and preach what
[1:54:32] luther preached wesley preached to
[1:54:34] pentecostals yeah they'll preach it but
[1:54:37] they don't have it now it's it it's not
[1:54:40] it's not in affecting their lives like
[1:54:42] it used to be why because it's not by
[1:54:45] faith
[1:54:47] no
[1:54:48] and again it's it's the mechanics
[1:54:51] not the dynamics
[1:54:54] and brothers unfortunately there's too
[1:54:56] many now with the message and the
[1:54:57] revelation of what god has done and what
[1:55:00] god is doing for the prophet brother
[1:55:03] there's too many
[1:55:04] gotta got the mechanics but not the
[1:55:06] dynamics
[1:55:09] oh yeah prophet said this god said this
[1:55:12] god said that god revealed this god
[1:55:14] revealed that and it's all mechanics but
[1:55:16] where's the dynamics if god has revealed
[1:55:19] it to you he's going to live he's going
[1:55:20] to he's going to reveal it in your life
[1:55:24] amen soul body and spirit god's going to
[1:55:27] control you from the inside out amen
[1:55:31] a new creature inside and brother he's
[1:55:32] working out amen eternal life to take
[1:55:36] control
[1:55:37] by the grace of god
[1:55:39] god help us
[1:55:43] that we surrender to end time faith
[1:55:47] amen that we are
[1:55:50] laying ourselves more and more in
[1:55:51] control of end time faith of
[1:55:53] resurrection and rapture
[1:55:56] by the grace of god
[1:55:58] remember
[1:56:00] day and night
[1:56:02] martin luther
[1:56:04] was rejoicing in the faith
[1:56:07] martin luther was rejoicing in the in
[1:56:09] the revelation of the truth
[1:56:11] that god had given him or just think he
[1:56:14] went for so long
[1:56:15] figuring that he could do this and be
[1:56:18] justified do that and be justified but
[1:56:20] he still he wasn't he never had the
[1:56:22] peace of it
[1:56:25] still no matter what he did
[1:56:27] still he lacked that peace and and he
[1:56:29] and he had that conviction
[1:56:32] so lord what's wrong
[1:56:34] he said i'm doing this we're going here
[1:56:36] we're doing this we're preaching this
[1:56:38] we're you know what so finally the lord
[1:56:40] revealed it to him and you know what it
[1:56:42] was
[1:56:43] he went into the church
[1:56:46] i know that it was a catholic church and
[1:56:48] because they had
[1:56:50] and they had bibles in in what we call
[1:56:52] the portrait there
[1:56:54] and
[1:56:55] and and the catholics or whatever they
[1:56:57] could come in and not coming into the
[1:57:00] church but they could come over where
[1:57:01] the bible was
[1:57:02] and and read it
[1:57:04] amen and so luther did that one time he
[1:57:07] was so
[1:57:08] frustrated that he had
[1:57:10] tried and tried and tried and tried
[1:57:12] regarding all
[1:57:14] i'm doing this lord didn't justify me
[1:57:16] i'm still not justified still not
[1:57:18] justified
[1:57:19] and so on and finally he went into the
[1:57:21] church
[1:57:23] and he he opened the bible i think it
[1:57:25] might have been a book of romans there
[1:57:27] somewhere
[1:57:28] and
[1:57:29] it was opened and he read
[1:57:32] jesus
[1:57:33] justified us
[1:57:35] what
[1:57:37] lord what
[1:57:39] yeah we're justified in jesus
[1:57:42] well it's not what i did is what he did
[1:57:44] and he read it that read that again
[1:57:47] and he oh it struck him
[1:57:50] oh oh brother he had an experience
[1:57:54] what was it justification
[1:57:57] amen not conde no he wasn't condemned
[1:58:01] hallelujah
[1:58:03] he was justified
[1:58:05] amen he had the experience of
[1:58:07] justification thank you jesus
[1:58:09] oh yes oh he was such a glorious
[1:58:12] revelation amen
[1:58:15] and that's where revelation also struck
[1:58:17] john wesley concerning sanctification
[1:58:20] amen
[1:58:21] brother
[1:58:22] it's a revelation for the pentecostals
[1:58:24] the gifts
[1:58:25] the baptism and the gifts of the spirit
[1:58:28] and it's the revelation for the bride
[1:58:30] for the rapture
[1:58:34] they were justified they were sanctified
[1:58:36] they were baptized with the holy ghost
[1:58:38] and access to the gifts
[1:58:40] now
[1:58:42] were changed from creatures of time to
[1:58:44] creatures of eternity amen because god
[1:58:47] was taking control
[1:58:49] amen and we were getting more and more
[1:58:51] conscious of eternity and less conscious
[1:58:54] of time
[1:58:55] amen praise the name of the lord
[1:58:59] brother god help
[1:59:00] us that we're like luther
[1:59:03] like wesley like the pentecostals god
[1:59:05] help us to rejoice in the faith
[1:59:08] amen brother
[1:59:11] if you believe it you'll rejoice in it
[1:59:13] you'll thank god for it thank you jesus
[1:59:16] lord the rapture the resurrection we're
[1:59:18] believing for lord we want to get out of
[1:59:20] here
[1:59:21] the bride wants to go but if you're not
[1:59:23] bright you don't want to go
[1:59:25] you know why you'll get too caught up
[1:59:27] with what's going on in this world
[1:59:29] you're too caught up with with the
[1:59:31] natural things of life
[1:59:33] and you and you feel oh i've got to put
[1:59:35] the emphasis on this but dance on this
[1:59:37] on that on that
[1:59:38] but no and that's the devil
[1:59:41] and he's getting you more and more
[1:59:43] caught up with the natural things so
[1:59:45] you're less less and less caught up with
[1:59:46] the spiritual
[1:59:48] less and less conscious of the spiritual
[1:59:51] oh yeah
[1:59:52] brother but i pray but what the lord
[1:59:54] wants you to do is give more more
[1:59:56] attention to the spiritual and what he's
[1:59:59] doing and what he wants to do what he
[2:00:01] requires of us in our souls amen now
[2:00:04] he's not saying you shouldn't do this
[2:00:06] and shouldn't do that with natural he
[2:00:07] knows that as long as we're in this
[2:00:09] world praise the lord yeah we're we're
[2:00:11] going to put attention on this and i got
[2:00:13] to do this and i got to do that yeah but
[2:00:16] you're going to keep the balance in it
[2:00:18] you're not going to give the preeminence
[2:00:19] to the natural more than the spiritual
[2:00:22] you're going to give the preemis to the
[2:00:23] spiritual why so that you'll have the
[2:00:26] right control the the natural let the
[2:00:28] right control over you
[2:00:30] amen the spiritual will control you
[2:00:33] amen so keep the balance in the natural

[2:00:48] lot of believers that are just caught up
[2:00:49] with the natural caught up with the
[2:00:50] natural that's truth

[2:01:01] but i know that they were living just

[2:01:07] prophet amen i believe this i believe
[2:01:09] this amen these doctrines and so on but

[2:03:46] but they respect it
[2:03:47] why
[2:03:48] because we're not there to force it on
[2:03:50] them
[2:03:50] not by any means
[2:03:52] but they know
[2:03:53] that that
[2:03:55] that's the effect that what we believe
[2:03:56] has on our lives
[2:03:58] and they respect it
[2:04:00] and brother if you can go forth with
[2:04:01] that same faith they'll respect you
[2:04:04] oh yeah
[2:04:05] and i know there's sometimes there's
[2:04:07] gonna be some regardless they'll fight

[2:04:11] but keep it right keep your attitude
[2:04:13] right keep your spirit right by the
[2:04:14] grace of god
[2:04:15] amen
[2:04:18] because brother
[2:04:21] because the hour is coming when there's
[2:04:22] going to be a where there's
[2:04:24] there's going to be a great problem
[2:04:27] to take your you know
[2:04:29] great temptation to
[2:04:31] maybe
[2:04:32] get into the temptation to to compromise
[2:04:35] no
[2:04:37] brother
[2:04:39] and god's allowing this to happen god's
[2:04:40] allowing that to happen just to see if
[2:04:42] you're going to compromise
[2:04:44] or see if you're going to still stay
[2:04:45] with the truth
[2:04:47] take your stand
[2:04:49] amen
[2:04:50] and don't be ashamed of it but the thing
[2:04:52] of it is like i've noticed them through
[2:04:54] the ages that there have been believers
[2:04:55] that that have been too
[2:04:57] too arrogant
[2:04:59] in taking their stand for the word and
[2:05:00] the message
[2:05:02] you know they just never had the right
[2:05:03] attitude and so on and uh
[2:05:06] and that's why they've turned
[2:05:08] turn people against
[2:05:11] them and against the message
[2:05:13] but keep your attitude right keep your
[2:05:15] spirit right
[2:05:16] and they'll respect you and respect the
[2:05:18] word
[2:05:19] by the grace of god
[2:05:21] amen
[2:05:22] god help us
[2:05:23] of course then of course there's going
[2:05:25] to be that hour too and that time when
[2:05:27] we do take our stand that we're going to
[2:05:29] be rejected
[2:05:31] some are going to reject us but again
[2:05:32] the prophet of god said he said there's
[2:05:34] god has got it god is good god is
[2:05:36] ordained he said
[2:05:38] uh friends
[2:05:39] he said for the bride
[2:05:41] yeah friends for the bride he said it's
[2:05:43] going to be there to protect you and
[2:05:45] there to help you
[2:05:46] amen to defend you thank god but again
[2:05:48] there's going to be there those here
[2:05:50] that are going to condemn you
[2:05:52] but just stay with the word
[2:05:53] by the grace of god
[2:05:55] amen
[2:05:58] so brother as i said day and night
[2:06:00] martin luther was rejoicing in the faith
[2:06:03] you rejoice in the revealed truth
[2:06:06] of justification
[2:06:08] wesley rejoiced in sanctification
[2:06:11] the pentecost has rejoiced in the
[2:06:13] baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of
[2:06:15] the spirit the bride is rejoicing in the
[2:06:18] revelation of the resurrection and the
[2:06:20] rapture amen
[2:06:22] i pray grace
[2:06:24] that the revelation of the resurrection
[2:06:25] rapture is as real to us as
[2:06:27] justification was to luther
[2:06:30] amen as the gifts and the baptism was to
[2:06:33] the pentecostals amen
[2:06:36] god help us let go let god have his way
[2:06:40] not me that lives but christ that liveth
[2:06:42] in me amen
[2:06:45] bringing the word to pass in your life
[2:06:47] but whatever is prophesied for this hour
[2:06:50] he's doing it in you
[2:06:52] and in me
[2:06:54] weather morning noon and night do we
[2:06:58] think about the hour that we are living
[2:07:01] thinking that the resurrection of the
[2:07:02] rapture could happen any minute
[2:07:05] the whole body of revealed truth in this
[2:07:08] age is a sign that the resurrection and
[2:07:10] rapture is about to climax
[2:07:14] amen that's the truth
[2:07:16] by the grace of god
[2:07:20] and the prophet has said let me there's
[2:07:21] a couple of quotes
[2:07:23] on
[2:07:24] my didn't think i'd be able to get
[2:07:27] anything
[2:07:30] tonight
[2:07:32] and here
[2:07:33] nine o'clock i think
[2:07:38] brother brown said
[2:07:40] let me say something
[2:07:43] this uniting time
[2:07:46] he said to see churches uniting
[2:07:49] nations uniting
[2:07:51] it's a uniting time of
[2:07:54] god and his bride
[2:07:57] and i say this with reverence and
[2:07:59] respect
[2:08:01] i believe that the bride of christ is
[2:08:03] called
[2:08:05] i believe she is sealed in the kingdom
[2:08:08] of god
[2:08:10] i believe the mechanics is there
[2:08:13] and they're waiting for the dynamics
[2:08:16] amen they're waiting for the dynamics
[2:08:19] that'll take her off the earth
[2:08:23] waiting for the dynamics that will take
[2:08:25] her into glory
[2:08:27] in the rapture
[2:08:29] he said i believe it with all my heart
[2:08:31] yes sir we don't know how he's going to
[2:08:34] do it but he will do it
[2:08:37] e
[2:08:39] he is the dynamics
[2:08:42] he said we just become members of the
[2:08:44] machine
[2:08:45] of his body and forming ourselves into
[2:08:48] his image and see him uniting himself
[2:08:52] with us
[2:08:53] amen
[2:08:54] see him uniting himself with us in his
[2:08:57] works
[2:08:58] with his love gifts
[2:09:00] as he hands them to us just before the
[2:09:03] wedding supper
[2:09:04] and we're waiting
[2:09:06] watching for that
[2:09:08] amen
[2:09:09] the dynamics of this church
[2:09:12] will be a refilling of the holy spirit
[2:09:15] that we have worked in small measure
[2:09:19] and he said while the headstone is
[2:09:20] coming down to unite with the body
[2:09:24] but he said when the head and body
[2:09:26] unites together
[2:09:27] the full power of the holy ghost would
[2:09:30] raise her up amen he said just exactly
[2:09:34] like that
[2:09:35] and he said even the dead
[2:09:37] that's dead in christ
[2:09:39] for hundreds of years ago will rise in
[2:09:42] the beauty of his holiness praise the
[2:09:45] lord amen and take a flight
[2:09:48] to the skies
[2:09:50] the dynamics is the holy spirit
[2:09:54] praise the name of the lord

[2:10:00] dynamics the double portion of the
[2:10:02] anointing amen with us in us and around

[2:12:17] spiritual i got to be super
[2:12:19] no
[2:12:21] i'm not trying to be super spiritual in
[2:12:22] that sense no because sometimes we can
[2:12:25] we can go forth and you know
[2:12:27] act spiritual talk spiritual but not not
[2:12:30] be spiritual in our souls
[2:12:32] amen oh yeah you can act it you can talk
[2:12:35] it but no is it is it in control of you
[2:12:39] your life
[2:12:40] your soul your spirit amen so again it's
[2:12:43] not me that lives is christ that liveth
[2:12:47] in me
[2:12:48] is christ doing this it is jesus christ
[2:12:51] in me saying this thinking this amen oh
[2:12:54] yeah thought word indeed is christ in
[2:12:56] control
[2:12:58] it's amazing
[2:13:00] it's a big statement
[2:13:03] but i trust we're more and more dead to
[2:13:04] ourselves and more and more alive to him
[2:13:08] amen amen the more we die to ourselves
[2:13:10] the more he takes control
[2:13:13] so i trust he's got more control not the
[2:13:15] devil
[2:13:17] satan is working in our flesh and again
[2:13:19] as the power of god is highlighted and
[2:13:21] he says satan has got got control here
[2:13:23] in your mind
[2:13:25] oh he's got this sense in this sense
[2:13:28] uh the seven senses and so on and of
[2:13:30] your flesh and so on and he's working in
[2:13:32] this working in that but he said god is
[2:13:35] in here he's got one sense faith
[2:13:39] yeah
[2:13:40] so i trust and whether as we feed on the
[2:13:43] word think on the word and think about
[2:13:45] the lord and pray the more and more this
[2:13:48] sense has got control
[2:13:50] yeah
[2:13:51] the less we pray the less we talk to the
[2:13:52] lord the less where we're thinking about
[2:13:55] the word the less we're thinking about
[2:13:57] the rapture less we're thinking about
[2:13:58] the end time oh yeah the the the less
[2:14:01] that god's got control the less faith
[2:14:03] got control
[2:14:04] but the more we're we're thinking about
[2:14:06] it the more he got control
[2:14:08] by the grace of god
[2:14:11] so again this is all that god uses is
[2:14:13] faith
[2:14:14] the prophet of god has brought out that
[2:14:16] he's highlighted it and he said now
[2:14:18] satan got seven sentences i think he
[2:14:20] said he said here in the mind he's
[2:14:21] working down through the census and he
[2:14:23] said of your flesh and of your your mind
[2:14:26] your thoughts your feelings and so on
[2:14:29] but he said god is in here working
[2:14:30] through the heart
[2:14:32] faith
[2:14:34] by the word
[2:14:36] amen
[2:14:38] so
[2:14:40] who was in control of your life today
[2:14:43] your attitude your actions your
[2:14:45] reactions
[2:14:47] who's really in control
[2:14:50] not that oh
[2:14:51] well you mean to tell me that i did this
[2:14:54] this was negative that was not yeah but
[2:14:56] but again just praying that the negative
[2:14:57] wasn't controlling you
[2:14:59] you were controlling the negative
[2:15:01] or maybe if the enemy was working out
[2:15:03] some negative feeling in your flesh it
[2:15:05] would only go so far amen oh yeah
[2:15:07] because the enemy will come down and
[2:15:09] he'll do this and do that and then then
[2:15:11] the holy spirit comes in
[2:15:13] to apply the token
[2:15:16] to give you give you power over the
[2:15:17] enemy
[2:15:19] amen so oh yeah what for so all you got
[2:15:22] god allows it to happen to let you know
[2:15:24] the revelation of grace
[2:15:28] amen do you need great oh
[2:15:30] that struck me one day

[2:17:12] jesus god bless our young brothers god

[2:17:27] defending you

[2:17:31] oh yeah
[2:17:33] yeah
[2:17:34] he's imputing your is righteousness to
[2:17:36] you
[2:17:37] thank god
[2:17:39] amen brother and with that revelation it
[2:17:42] ought to humble us
[2:17:44] keep us humble
[2:17:46] don't exalt yourself humble yourself
[2:17:48] thank you thank you thank you jesus amen
[2:17:52] grace
[2:17:56] he said
[2:17:58] in this message he that cometh to god
[2:18:01] must believe that he is
[2:18:05] he said it is
[2:18:07] impossible
[2:18:09] to please god
[2:18:11] without faith
[2:18:14] amen
[2:18:15] amen
[2:18:17] and he said you
[2:18:19] have never seen him so then he said
[2:18:22] you've got to believe it by faith
[2:18:25] and if you could see him it would be no
[2:18:28] more faith anything that the census
[2:18:31] declares is no more faith
[2:18:33] he said it's a scientific fact and it's
[2:18:36] not no more faith
[2:18:39] but you have to accept him
[2:18:41] by faith belief
[2:18:44] and he that cometh to god must believe
[2:18:46] god
[2:18:47] and faith comes by hearing the word of
[2:18:50] god amen
[2:18:52] praise the lord through the hearing of
[2:18:54] the word tonight god has given you the
[2:18:56] faith to take you on
[2:18:59] amen god's given you the faith to keep
[2:19:00] moving on trusting believing thank you
[2:19:03] amen but
[2:19:05] with salvation
[2:19:07] amen you're going to get stronger and
[2:19:09] stronger and stronger in your salvation
[2:19:13] unto a resurrection
[2:19:16] on to the rapture
[2:19:19] amen praise the lord
[2:19:21] he said you must first believe that this
[2:19:24] is god's word
[2:19:26] for faith cometh by hearing the word
[2:19:29] and you must come to god by the word
[2:19:33] just take the word what it says
[2:19:35] he said everything else is contrary to
[2:19:38] it
[2:19:39] everything else contrary to it is not
[2:19:41] right
[2:19:42] and abraham had to believe just what the
[2:19:45] voice told him
[2:19:46] amen and when he was a hundred years old
[2:19:50] 25 years later he was stronger believing
[2:19:54] than he was 25 years ago
[2:19:57] amen
[2:19:58] and he staggered not at the promise of
[2:20:01] god through unbelief
[2:20:03] but was strong giving praise to god
[2:20:06] knowing that he was able to perform what
[2:20:08] he had promised and that's the way
[2:20:11] everyone must be that way
[2:20:13] you must come with an unfailing faith
[2:20:17] believing that god made the promise
[2:20:20] but now he says you have to be in a
[2:20:23] position to have that faith and that's
[2:20:26] what we're going to talk on to receive
[2:20:29] that perfect faith
[2:20:31] amen
[2:20:33] i'll just finish with this quote
[2:20:38] he said
[2:20:39] now these are real deep lessons and i'll
[2:20:42] catch the top of it and then you
[2:20:46] dig down
[2:20:48] amen dig down
[2:20:50] amen
[2:20:52] not a form of godliness but knowing your
[2:20:54] heart is into it digging down into it
[2:20:58] and he said notice it is something that
[2:20:59] you possess not imagination if you
[2:21:02] really have it
[2:21:04] he said it's just as real as you know
[2:21:06] that you are writing an automobile
[2:21:09] it's just as real as you know that
[2:21:11] you're sitting in a church
[2:21:14] it's just as real as you hear my voice
[2:21:16] it is substance
[2:21:18] not an imagination not an emotion but
[2:21:21] something that you have
[2:21:24] and it comes to you by hearing the word
[2:21:26] of god
[2:21:27] he said faith cometh by hearing and
[2:21:30] hearing the word of god
[2:21:32] and he said that puts it back to where
[2:21:34] your
[2:21:35] faith is
[2:21:37] not some in some individual
[2:21:40] it's not in a man
[2:21:42] it is in the word of god
[2:21:45] your faith is in god
[2:21:49] amen
[2:21:50] praise the lord but when it is revealed
[2:21:53] to you
[2:21:54] it's a faith a perfect faith that cannot
[2:21:57] fail
[2:21:59] if god reveals it to you in your heart
[2:22:01] and in your soul it is a perfect faith
[2:22:05] on to eternal life
[2:22:07] amen
[2:22:08] god's grace be with us
[2:22:10] amen in the name of our lord jesus
[2:22:13] christ
[2:22:14] may we
[2:22:15] grow
