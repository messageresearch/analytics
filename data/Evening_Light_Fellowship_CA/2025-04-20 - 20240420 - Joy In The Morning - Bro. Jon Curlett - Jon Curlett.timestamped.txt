[41:53] Hallelujah, Lord
[41:56] Jesus. Lord, this is the morning you
[42:00] rose, Lord. And when you
[42:03] rose, Lord, it was the spirit of God
[42:05] that raised you
[42:08] up, made you live
[42:11] again, Lord. And on the day of
[42:13] Pentecost, you sent that spirit back so
[42:15] it can make us live again. that we who
[42:17] were dead in our sins and
[42:19] trespasses, Lord, could be made a new
[42:21] creation in Christ by your spirit,
[42:23] heavenly father. And Lord, if there's
[42:26] one thing that spirit requires, it's a
[42:27] surrender. Lord, it's a laying down.
[42:30] It's a laying
[42:32] aside. Lord, we're here this morning to
[42:35] thank you for what you've done. To thank
[42:37] you that you're a living Christ this
[42:39] morning. But Lord, we need you to be a
[42:41] living Christ in me and in every person
[42:43] in this building, heavenly father. Lord,
[42:45] we don't just want to look to you as
[42:46] living. We want us to be living the same
[42:48] way, heavenly father. Lord, help us to
[42:51] surrender. Help us to yield, Lord. And
[42:53] in that yielding, may we rest on your
[42:55] word day by day, Lord. Trusting you to
[42:58] perform that which you promised to each
[42:59] one of us. Lord, bless this service.
[43:01] Bless this people, Lord, for their
[43:03] faithfulness, Lord. May you just
[43:05] minister this morning once again. We
[43:07] ask, Lord, have your way in this
[43:09] service. In Jesus Christ's name we pray
[43:11] it. Amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn if
[43:14] you would again to Psalm chapter
[43:16] 30. Psalms chapter 30. And men certainly
[43:19] enjoyed the the play in the program last
[43:21] night. It was absolutely
[43:24] wonderful. And uh it's a team effort.
[43:27] The team effort. And uh I certainly
[43:30] appreciate how Sister Priscilla and
[43:31] Brother Joe started this thing months
[43:34] and months ahead of time to give people
[43:35] time to get used to it and and kind of
[43:38] work our way into it and and I think it
[43:41] went off beautifully. You know, I don't
[43:42] think Levi missed the line last night,
[43:44] and he had a whole lot of lines in
[43:46] there. And I hate to say it, but I do
[43:48] think Satan stole the
[43:51] show. Amen. Brother Joe did a wonderful
[43:53] job there. But then afterwards, you
[43:57] know, I've been asked if maybe they
[43:59] could leave it up so I could preach
[44:00] under it today and just give everyone a
[44:02] break. And I said, I'd really prefer not
[44:04] to. And so everybody came in and they
[44:05] put their shoulder to the wheel and we
[44:07] got it taken down. I know it cost us an
[44:09] extra 45 minutes or so. But everyone was
[44:12] helping. Sister Cordella was back there
[44:13] taking down the bags and everything. The
[44:16] brothers helping things and brother
[44:17] Vichel was up here vacuuming. I said to
[44:19] the brothers, "He'll make a wonderful
[44:20] wife someday. He knows how to work that
[44:22] vacuum." So, everyone helped and and I
[44:25] just appreciate that from the youngest,
[44:26] the old Sean and Andrew were in here
[44:28] working. They don't have to. They're
[44:29] they're they're visitors, but they're in
[44:31] there. They wanted to put their shoulder
[44:32] to the wheel. So, I say God bless you to
[44:34] each one of them. And and I certainly
[44:36] enjoy the accents. I didn't know sister
[44:38] Lydia could speak like that. I didn't
[44:39] know a number of people could speak like
[44:41] that, including Elsa and Jensen and
[44:43] these different ones, but uh certainly a
[44:45] wonderfully done program. And God bless
[44:46] you. Trust it was a witness and a
[44:48] testimony, especially to those that were
[44:50] here. Amen. We're not here to put on a
[44:52] show. And I I said afterwards to some
[44:54] people, I said, "This wasn't
[44:55] entertainment. We don't do it for
[44:57] entertainment. We do it to worship God
[44:59] in the simplicity of the gifts that he's
[45:01] given us." And I thought that was just a
[45:04] perfect way to express it. So, God bless
[45:05] you. appreciate it. And the bar has been
[45:07] set. Hi, Sister
[45:09] Priscilla. So, we'll see what next year
[45:11] holds. Amen. Psalms chapter
[45:14] 30. Same scripture we wrote la read last
[45:18] service. It says, "Oh Lord, thou hast
[45:20] brought up my soul from the grave. Thou
[45:23] hast kept me alive that I should not go
[45:25] down to the pit. Sing unto the Lord, oh
[45:28] you saints of his, and give thanks at
[45:30] the remembrance of his holiness. For his
[45:32] anger endureth for a moment." That's
[45:35] what we preached on last service. He
[45:36] says, "But in his favor is life. Weeping
[45:38] may endure for a night, but joy cometh
[45:42] in the morning." Amen. God bless you.
[45:43] You can have your seats this morning.
[45:45] May God bless the reading of his word.
[45:46] And I want to take us from enduring the
[45:48] night of weeping now to joy in the
[45:51] morning. And the church of the living
[45:52] God said, "Amen. Joy in the morning."
[45:55] And we closed out Friday night in in
[45:57] Revelation 5 where John was told, "Stop
[46:00] crying, John, that the lion of the tribe
[46:02] of Judah has prevailed." And we want to
[46:04] look at that prevailing this morning.
[46:06] And I think you'll be able to see that
[46:08] we prevail because he prevailed. Amen.
[46:10] We overcome because he overcame. We're
[46:13] redeemed because he redeemed us. Amen.
[46:15] What he did is what we benefit from. He
[46:18] does it and we receive it and we benefit
[46:20] from these things. And we close on this
[46:22] thought last service that God doesn't
[46:24] ask us to do anything he doesn't do
[46:26] himself. Amen. And so we see that Jesus
[46:29] day his his last final as normal day on
[46:32] earth as a human as a as a typical man.
[46:35] He had to lay his body. He had to lay
[46:37] his soul. He had to lay his spirit on
[46:39] the line based on what the word said
[46:41] about him. He had to have faith in the
[46:43] word the same way that you and I have to
[46:45] have faith in the word today. He doesn't
[46:47] ask us to do something that he that he
[46:49] wouldn't. And he had to believe that
[46:50] that word was right, that that word was
[46:52] true, and that that word was for him. He
[46:55] had to identify himself in the word. He
[46:58] had to place himself there and say,
[47:00] "This is what the word says about me and
[47:02] therefore that's what the word is going
[47:03] to do for me." And he had to take it and
[47:05] he had to lay himself into that. And we
[47:07] see at the end of of his life that Jesus
[47:10] is still holding to the word. Now
[47:12] remember, the spirit of God left him in
[47:14] the garden of Gethsemane and the sins of
[47:16] the world came and they dwelt on him.
[47:19] And remember, God can't dwell in sin. I
[47:22] said this before, that ought to make us
[47:24] shut if we've received the Holy Spirit.
[47:25] Because if God can't dwell in sin, that
[47:27] means you're sinless this morning. But
[47:29] Christ took every sin of humanity on
[47:32] himself. The spirit of God left him and
[47:34] he faced those final hours, that final
[47:37] day as a man. No presence of God, no
[47:41] spirit of God, no supernatural strength.
[47:44] He faced it as a man. And he laid down
[47:47] his life for love of you and I. He held
[47:50] himself there as a man. There was
[47:52] nothing in him that took him through
[47:54] that except that his love for you and I
[47:56] held him to the whipping post. It held
[47:58] his arms on the cross for you and I. And
[48:01] he prevailed in those final hours as
[48:04] just a man. Praise the Lord. What kind
[48:06] of love does that have does that man
[48:08] have for us? But we see in the final
[48:11] hours, it says when Jesus therefore had
[48:13] received the vinegar, he had to do that
[48:16] because the scripture said they were
[48:17] going to offer it to him. After that he
[48:20] said, "It is finished." In other words,
[48:22] every part of the word that had written
[48:24] about been written about him up to his
[48:26] death, he had fulfilled
[48:28] it. Everything the word required of him,
[48:31] he had done it. And he said, "I've done
[48:33] it. It is finished." It says, "And he
[48:35] bowed his head and he gave up the
[48:37] ghost." And that word gave up means that
[48:40] he gave it willfully. In the original
[48:42] language, it shows that this was an act
[48:44] of will. It was not torn from him. He
[48:47] was not fighting to hold his life until
[48:49] the bitter end. But when the word was
[48:51] fulfilled, he says, "Now I give my life
[48:54] up." He said, "No man taketh it from me.
[48:56] I give my life." And so he gave it up
[48:59] himself. He voluntarily gave his life.
[49:03] And in that moment, he laid his life on
[49:05] the word and gave it away.
[49:08] We say we believe
[49:10] church, but when things come down and
[49:14] what's critical to us is on the line,
[49:16] that's when we find out if we really
[49:18] believe. Do we take the word or do we
[49:21] take the
[49:22] circumstance? Amen. When our life is on
[49:25] the line, how many of us has had our
[49:26] real life on the line? Not many. Not
[49:28] many have really had to lay our life on
[49:30] the line and say, "Though he slay me,
[49:32] yet I'll trust him." But that's the
[49:34] attitude of faith of the believer is
[49:36] that when our career is on the line,
[49:38] when our finances on the line, when our
[49:40] health is on the line, when
[49:42] relationships and family are on the
[49:44] line, will we say I'll stay with the
[49:46] word or do we cower and go to that thing
[49:49] which we hold more dear. See, it's when
[49:51] times get tough, we find out, do we
[49:53] really
[49:54] believe? It's in the trial that we find
[49:56] out if we really believe. It's easy to
[49:58] believe the word when everything's going
[49:59] great. It's easy to believe the word
[50:01] when you got your health. It's easy to
[50:02] believe the word when you've got a a
[50:04] stress-free life. But when things get
[50:06] difficult and you've got to give
[50:08] something up for that word, that's when
[50:10] you find out what do you value? What do
[50:12] you truly believe? And Jesus here is
[50:14] resting himself completely on the word
[50:16] of God. Church, he believes it so much.
[50:18] He's testified about it before it ever
[50:21] happened. He's told them, if you let if
[50:23] you kill this body, I'll raise it up in
[50:26] three days. Amen. He's testified that
[50:28] his body is going to come back. He's
[50:30] testified. I'm going to go back to the
[50:32] father. Church, that ought to be our
[50:35] attitude every day is that we can
[50:36] testify of the victory before we have
[50:39] it. Why? Because the word says it. I was
[50:41] listening to brother Ron Spencer last
[50:43] night before I went to bed and he was
[50:45] preaching at Louisiana Youth Camp and he
[50:47] said, "We've got to be able to testify."
[50:49] It was in my notes before I heard him.
[50:51] He said, "We've got to be able to
[50:53] testify before we receive it." Remember
[50:56] the scripture says of the saints, it
[50:58] says they overcame by two things. The
[51:00] blood of the lamb and the word of their
[51:02] testimony. What is the word of your
[51:04] testimony, church? It ought to be this.
[51:07] By his stripes, I am healed. That he's
[51:10] healed my broken heart. He's delivered
[51:11] me from
[51:12] myself. If we can't testify about it
[51:15] beforehand, we don't believe it. And
[51:17] brother Ron Spencer was saying, he's
[51:19] saying, I've testified for five years
[51:21] that I am healed from cancer.
[51:24] five years of stage four cancer. He said
[51:27] they took out a tumor from the back of
[51:28] my brain. They said I wouldn't walk.
[51:31] They said I had four months to live. He
[51:33] says five years later I'm cancerree. But
[51:35] I had to testify that I am cancer free
[51:38] before I ever became cancer-free. The
[51:40] testimony doesn't take you out of the
[51:42] test. The testimony takes you through
[51:44] the test and then at the end you say his
[51:47] words are faithful and true. That's the
[51:49] heart and that's the soul of a believer.
[51:51] Amen. God help us. God, help our faith
[51:54] to rise up and say, "I'm healed whether
[51:55] I can see it now or not. Whether I'm
[51:57] feeling better or not, by his stripes,
[52:00] we are healed." Amen. That we can speak
[52:02] the word of God and see it come to pass
[52:04] in our life because there's something
[52:06] that's anchored in our heart. And that's
[52:07] what it's about is that it comes down
[52:09] into our heart. It's not just in our
[52:11] mind. It's not just Brother John said
[52:13] so. It's not just mama said so, but it's
[52:15] that God has laid his word in my heart
[52:17] and faith has come forth and it's laying
[52:19] hold of it and it declares it to be even
[52:21] though I can't see it. That's what we're
[52:23] looking for this morning.
[52:25] Amen. But Jesus was laying his life
[52:29] down. And on Psalm 16, he was David
[52:32] would say this by the spirit speaking
[52:34] through him. And this is this is what
[52:36] Christ would have had on his mind.
[52:37] There's many scriptures. I just picked a
[52:39] couple over these last few services. He
[52:41] said, "Therefore my heart is glad and my
[52:45] glory rejoices. My flesh shall also rest
[52:48] in hope. For thou will not leave my soul
[52:52] in hell. Neither wilt thou suffer thine
[52:55] holy one to see corruption. Thou wil
[52:57] show me the path of life. In thy
[53:00] presence is fullness of joy, and at thy
[53:02] right hand there are pleasures forever
[53:04] more." Church, notice it didn't say he
[53:07] didn't have to go to hell. It said he
[53:10] would not be left in hell. He had to go
[53:13] to hell. He went to hell as a sinner.
[53:16] Now catch that. He is not a sinner. He
[53:19] went as a sinner because he had sin on
[53:21] him. He had never done it. But he took
[53:24] your and my sins on him. And so he had
[53:26] to go through the process of what a
[53:28] sinner goes through, which is to go to
[53:29] hell. That's where sinners go is they go
[53:32] to hell. And so as he died as a sinner,
[53:34] he had to go down to hell. Abraham says
[53:36] this, "In the garden of Gethsemane, the
[53:39] anointing left him." You know, and he
[53:41] had to die as a sinner. He died a
[53:43] sinner. You know that not his sins, but
[53:46] mine and yours. He says that's where
[53:48] that love came in. How he took mine.
[53:51] That was the love of God that he would
[53:53] take your condition and put it on
[53:55] himself. And so he goes down into hell
[53:57] and he's got some time on his hands
[53:59] because he's got to be down there for a
[54:01] while. He's got about 36 hours to kill
[54:03] in hell if we could put it that way.
[54:05] Now, that would make most of us shrink
[54:07] back. I'm going to have to spend 36
[54:09] hours in hell. How many of us are are
[54:11] are lining up to say, "I'll spend some
[54:13] time in hell this
[54:15] morning." But he knew he had to go down
[54:18] to hell. And we notice that nobody has
[54:20] ever come back from hell. You've got to
[54:23] go where nobody has ever
[54:27] returned. And you say, "Yeah, I'll
[54:29] volunteer to go down." That's what he
[54:31] did when he gave his life for you and I.
[54:33] He said, "I'll go to hell." He took your
[54:36] place in hell, church. And he didn't do
[54:38] it. And he didn't shrink away from it.
[54:40] But he says, "I'll take that on. I'll go
[54:42] down willingly." And he didn't go down
[54:44] maybe the way that we do. Amen. Because
[54:47] why? The scripture says he's got to go
[54:49] down to hell, but hell won't hold him.
[54:52] He's got to go down to hell, but hell
[54:54] can't keep him. In fact, when he goes
[54:56] down to hell, he's going down to
[54:58] conquer. So when Christ goes down to
[55:00] hell, he's not like us. And we're just
[55:03] looking around and how bad is it going
[55:04] to
[55:06] be? Oh, what are they going to do when I
[55:08] get
[55:10] there? Listen, Satan was no doubt
[55:12] holding his press conference that
[55:14] morning just like they did with Bin
[55:17] Laden. We got him this
[55:19] morning. He's dead. I have confirmation.
[55:22] I have video. I have the doctor
[55:25] certificate. Jesus Christ, the son of
[55:27] God, the anointed one, died this
[55:30] morning. And all of hell is cheering and
[55:33] you don't see Christ kind of creeping
[55:35] around the corner. But he strides right
[55:37] in
[55:38] there. He walks in. He's not worried now
[55:43] cuz he knows what the word has said
[55:45] about him. So he's not just shrinking in
[55:47] and maybe sitting over in the corner and
[55:50] hoping nobody will notice. But he walks
[55:52] in and he strides in. Why? because he's
[55:55] coming as a conqueror, not as a defeated
[55:58] sinner. Remember, because he is no
[56:01] sinner, he just has to go for your place
[56:03] and for my place.
[56:05] Amen. We can shrink back so easily from
[56:09] situations because we forget who we are.
[56:14] Because we forget what the word says
[56:16] about us. If we could only read all the
[56:19] way through to the end and read the
[56:21] portion that says we are more than
[56:23] conquerors through Jesus Christ, more
[56:26] than
[56:27] conquerors. Paul says that means we
[56:29] prevail mightily. We overwhelmingly
[56:33] conquer. That's the attitude of the
[56:35] believer. We've been made more than
[56:37] conquerors. The situation looks tough.
[56:40] Maybe nobody's ever walked through this
[56:42] before, but I'm going to walk through
[56:43] it. and I'm going to come through as
[56:45] gold tried in the
[56:47] fire. It's for my benefit. It's for my
[56:51] brother's benefit. It's for my sister's
[56:53] benefit. We don't just walk through
[56:55] things to walk through them. We walk
[56:57] through them to conquer. We walk through
[56:59] them to overcome. We walk to them to
[57:01] show the world there's a way you can
[57:02] live. That doesn't mean you're down in
[57:04] the dumps all the time. Woe is me with a
[57:06] downward turn
[57:08] mouth. That is not the nature of a
[57:10] Christian. And if it is, we need a
[57:12] refilling of the baptism of the Holy
[57:15] Spirit. If it is, we need a baptism of
[57:18] the Holy Spirit because we've lost the
[57:20] joy of our salvation. He does not walk
[57:23] down there as a weak man. He walks down
[57:26] as a conqueror. And you can see Satan
[57:28] having that that that press conference
[57:30] that morning and all of a sudden, you
[57:33] know, they have these from time to time.
[57:35] Somebody interrupts the
[57:37] speaker. You ever see that? I've seen it
[57:41] recently in the news where somebody
[57:43] starts yelling at the speaker at a press
[57:45] conference. Well, guess what? Satan got
[57:47] interrupted that morning. We've got him.
[57:50] We're good. We're safe. We've defeated
[57:52] him. And then brother Arab says this. He
[57:55] says, I can hear Jesus say, I am the
[57:58] virginborn son of God. I came from the
[58:01] ivory palaces of my father and I came to
[58:04] the earth and on the earth it's bathed
[58:06] this morning with the blood that I gave
[58:08] and paid the price of death, sin, and
[58:11] hell. He says, "Give me those
[58:13] keys." Hallelujah. I'm taking over from
[58:16] here on. You've kept the people in
[58:18] bondage. You've kept them in fear and
[58:20] everything else, but I'll take over from
[58:22] this time on. He says, "Hallelujah." He
[58:24] took them off and hung him on his own
[58:26] side. pushed him back in hell and walked
[58:30] away. What a morning that must have
[58:34] been. Everything looked like it was
[58:36] going
[58:38] sideways. And he walks down in the place
[58:41] that is furthest from the presence of
[58:44] God and he
[58:45] conquers. David said, "Yay, though I
[58:48] walk through the valley of the shadow of
[58:51] death, I will fear no evil. For thy rod
[58:54] and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou
[58:56] preparest a table before me in the
[58:59] presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest
[59:02] my head with oil. Surely goodness and
[59:04] mercy shall follow me all the days of my
[59:06] life. That's how you can walk into
[59:09] situations, church. Yay, though I walk
[59:11] through the valley of the shadow of
[59:13] death. I will fear no evil. He said,
[59:16] "The mighty conqueror," since he rent
[59:19] the veil in two, lo, behold him in full
[59:22] view, the mighty conqueror rose up and
[59:24] said, "I am he that was dead and is
[59:26] alive again, and I'm alive forever more,
[59:28] and I have the keys of death and hell."
[59:31] Now, catch this. He that heareth my
[59:34] words, and believeth on me, on him that
[59:37] has sent me hath everlasting life. I've
[59:41] got the keys of the resurrection, and
[59:42] I'll raise him in the last day. He says
[59:44] that satisfies me. Amen. I am
[59:48] he. You go in first Peter chapter 3 and
[59:52] it tells us that Christ didn't just go
[59:53] down and take the keys of death, hell,
[59:55] and the grave. He went down and he
[59:57] preached in hell. Church, you know you
[59:59] own hell when you get to preach the word
[1:00:01] in hell because they don't preach the
[1:00:03] word in hell. But Christ went down and
[1:00:05] he preached to those souls that were
[1:00:07] imprisoned, those spirits from the days
[1:00:09] of Noah. It says those that had turned
[1:00:11] down the word. And he went down and he
[1:00:13] told them, he says, "Here's the proof
[1:00:14] that Noah was
[1:00:15] right. Here's proof that the message was
[1:00:18] right. I am the one that tried to help
[1:00:21] you. I am the one that tried to save
[1:00:23] you, and you turned me down. You didn't
[1:00:25] turn Noah down. You turned me down." And
[1:00:28] souls that were in prison had to watch
[1:00:30] him as he turned around and he walked
[1:00:32] out and he slammed the door shut of
[1:00:34] hell. Can you imagine the feeling?
[1:00:38] You've had thousands of years in
[1:00:42] torment and you think, "But maybe I'll
[1:00:45] get out." And then Christ comes down and
[1:00:48] says, "I'm sorry you turned me
[1:00:50] down." You talk about a weeping, a
[1:00:54] wailing, a nashing of
[1:00:55] teeth. There was no victory for them
[1:00:58] that morning. And just like it was on
[1:01:00] the day when the ark, the door of the
[1:01:02] ark
[1:01:03] closed, there's a day coming here, too.
[1:01:06] There's a day coming here too. Amen.
[1:01:09] When the door to salvation will be shut.
[1:01:11] There's a time, the book of Revelation
[1:01:13] says there's a time when your condition
[1:01:14] gets locked in. It says, "And that he
[1:01:17] who is filthy be filthy still, and let
[1:01:20] him who is holy be holy still." And
[1:01:22] while the door is open, that's the time
[1:01:24] to come because you'll find there's a
[1:01:27] bunch of people come knocking on the
[1:01:29] door way too late. And they say, "Let us
[1:01:31] in. Let us in. Let us in." He says,
[1:01:33] "Depart from me, you workers of
[1:01:34] iniquity. I never knew you. Don't wait.
[1:01:38] Don't wait till then, church. It's too
[1:01:40] late
[1:01:41] then. But I love that there's a second
[1:01:44] group of people that's waiting in
[1:01:45] another
[1:01:46] area. There's another group of people
[1:01:48] that have been waiting for thousands of
[1:01:50] years and they weren't in hell, but they
[1:01:52] were in paradise. And paradise is just a
[1:01:54] place of waiting. It's just a place
[1:01:57] where people wait and you're still as
[1:02:00] you are here. You remember that when the
[1:02:02] King Saul talked to Samuel after Samuel
[1:02:05] was was brought back, remember he went
[1:02:07] to a witch and the witch could reach out
[1:02:09] and touch Samuel's spirit. And when
[1:02:11] Samuel spoke to Saul, he was exactly as
[1:02:13] he was on earth. He wore his prophetic
[1:02:16] robes. He was still a prophet. He still
[1:02:18] had the word of the Lord. Nothing had
[1:02:21] changed about Samuel in paradise except
[1:02:24] his location. He was still who he was.
[1:02:26] Amen. They have been wait and you could
[1:02:29] only do that. You can't do that today.
[1:02:31] Back then, they were under the b blood
[1:02:32] of bulls and goats. They were waiting
[1:02:34] and so they couldn't be pulled back that
[1:02:36] way. But for 4,000 years, if you look at
[1:02:39] Adam and Eve and Abel and those ones,
[1:02:41] they've been waiting in paradise for the
[1:02:43] promise. 4,000 years, church, 4,000
[1:02:47] years of waiting. But then you've got
[1:02:49] the latest edition, which is the thief
[1:02:52] on the cross.
[1:02:53] thief on the cross only spends about 30
[1:02:55] hours, 35 hours in hell or or in
[1:02:58] paradise, I should say. Jesus said,
[1:03:00] "Remember, you're going to be there with
[1:03:01] me." And he goes, because he accepted
[1:03:04] Christ there, he goes into paradise and
[1:03:06] he's only waiting for a day, a day and a
[1:03:08] half
[1:03:09] tops. But you look at these people and
[1:03:12] they died in faith, the scripture says,
[1:03:14] and we're going to read it here. They
[1:03:16] died in faith. They all died in faith,
[1:03:19] not having received the promises. They
[1:03:22] only got a portion of what God had
[1:03:24] promised. But the scripture says they
[1:03:26] died in faith, not ha but having seen
[1:03:29] them aar off and were persuaded of them
[1:03:32] and embraced them and confessed that
[1:03:35] they were strangers and pilgrims on the
[1:03:37] earth. For they that say such things
[1:03:40] declare plainly that they seek a
[1:03:42] country. And truly if they had been
[1:03:43] mindful of that country from when once
[1:03:45] they came out, they might have had
[1:03:47] opportunity to have returned. He says,
[1:03:49] "But now they desire a better country
[1:03:51] that is in heavenly wherefore God is not
[1:03:54] ashamed to be called their God, for he
[1:03:56] hath prepared for them a city." Now, I
[1:03:58] don't know how time passes in paradise.
[1:04:01] I've never been there. I've been to
[1:04:03] paradise, but it's not the paradise
[1:04:05] we're talking about. And time passes
[1:04:07] very slowly
[1:04:09] there. Talking about paradise just up on
[1:04:12] the hill. We know that. But it's a place
[1:04:14] of waiting. And they clearly knew they
[1:04:16] weren't in hell because they weren't in
[1:04:17] torment. and that ought to have been a
[1:04:19] great comfort to them. I think if you're
[1:04:21] not in torment, you're in the right
[1:04:23] place. Amen. But they could not come
[1:04:25] into the presence of God because they
[1:04:27] were only under the blood of bulls and
[1:04:29] goats and the full atonement of Christ
[1:04:31] had been made. And so I would like to
[1:04:33] believe this that as they died in faith
[1:04:36] there they rested in faith because
[1:04:38] remember death doesn't change
[1:04:40] you. If you die in faith, you're going
[1:04:43] to stay there in faith. Remember, I was
[1:04:46] talking to some brothers after church
[1:04:48] yesterday or or the day before, whenever
[1:04:50] it was, and I said, "Death doesn't
[1:04:52] change you. It just changes your
[1:04:53] dwelling place." When you look in the
[1:04:56] book of Revelation, those that go
[1:04:57] through the tribulation, they die and
[1:04:59] they're in torment for a thousand years.
[1:05:02] And yet, when they raise up, they
[1:05:04] haven't learned a thing. They haven't re
[1:05:07] they haven't come to a place where they
[1:05:09] know that their actions are wrong, and
[1:05:10] therefore they should change. They have
[1:05:12] rejected Christ, the word. They have
[1:05:14] killed the saints. They have persecuted
[1:05:16] the true
[1:05:17] church and they die and they go to a
[1:05:20] thousand years of torment. And when they
[1:05:21] raise up, what do they do? They go right
[1:05:23] back and fight against God again. Why?
[1:05:24] Because death doesn't change you. It
[1:05:26] just changes your dwelling place. So
[1:05:28] that's true for them and I believe it's
[1:05:29] true for Abraham as well that he died in
[1:05:32] faith and so in paradise he was just as
[1:05:34] faithful as he was here on earth. But
[1:05:36] he's been waiting now for thousands and
[1:05:39] thousands and thousands of
[1:05:41] years. Now remember Abraham had received
[1:05:44] a covenant from God and he had received
[1:05:46] a promise and he had received a
[1:05:48] covenant. Now the promise was I'm going
[1:05:50] to make you a father of many nations and
[1:05:52] then God gave him one son. Now I don't
[1:05:55] know about you but one son does not
[1:05:56] equal many nations to me. What did he
[1:05:59] see? He got the first fruit of the
[1:06:01] promise but he saw a far off what would
[1:06:04] come. But then he also had the covenant
[1:06:06] where God came down and he said Abraham
[1:06:09] I'm going to make a covenant with you.
[1:06:10] And he told him to make these sacrifices
[1:06:12] and split the bodies of everything
[1:06:14] except for the two birds. And then he
[1:06:16] said,"Abraham, you stay there and I'm
[1:06:18] going to make a covenant with you." And
[1:06:19] then God came down and he put asleep on
[1:06:22] Abraham and Abraham went into
[1:06:25] darkness. Now darkness does not mean
[1:06:27] he's in a place of separation. Darkness
[1:06:29] means he's in death. And Abraham's in
[1:06:32] death. And then God walks through and he
[1:06:34] pro and he confirms the covenant. And
[1:06:37] you'll see that Abraham has nothing to
[1:06:38] do with that covenant. Only God is doing
[1:06:41] the work of the covenant. And so Abraham
[1:06:43] has received a covenant, but he has not
[1:06:44] received the full benefit of that
[1:06:46] covenant. And he dies in faith looking a
[1:06:49] far off and saying it's coming. And so
[1:06:51] he goes into paradise. And Abraham is
[1:06:53] looking for his
[1:06:55] covenant thousands and thousands of
[1:06:57] years. But church, if we know Abraham's
[1:06:59] good at one thing, it's waiting.
[1:07:01] Abraham's good at receiving it,
[1:07:03] believing it, testifying of it, waiting
[1:07:06] for it, but he's also really he's used
[1:07:08] to receiving it as well. And so he goes
[1:07:10] into faith. He dies in faith. And for
[1:07:13] thousands of years, he stays in faith
[1:07:15] because he knows that he'll be faithful
[1:07:17] who promised it. That's the fe that's
[1:07:20] the seed of Abraham. And so now Christ
[1:07:22] has preached to souls in prison and he's
[1:07:25] left them there and they're sitting
[1:07:26] there and they're wailing and weeping
[1:07:27] and nashing their teeth. But he's got
[1:07:29] one more stop to make that glorious
[1:07:31] morning. And he's got to go through
[1:07:33] paradise. He has that Abraham seed, that
[1:07:35] faith seed, that believing seed, the
[1:07:37] elect of God that are waiting for him.
[1:07:40] Because now that the atonement's made,
[1:07:42] they can be truly free. They can go to
[1:07:45] be with him. We're talking about joy
[1:07:47] this morning. He says, "I can see him."
[1:07:50] He said, "Wait a minute. There's another
[1:07:51] group over here. Have been Job and
[1:07:53] Abraham, Isaac, Sarah. Why heaven
[1:07:55] wouldn't be heaven without Sarah and
[1:07:56] Abraham in it?" Hardly. There they were
[1:07:58] over here in paradise. They couldn't go
[1:08:00] in the presence of the father. They
[1:08:02] lived under the burnt sacrifice. That's
[1:08:04] all they knew how to do. They were
[1:08:05] justified, but it couldn't divorce sin.
[1:08:08] It couldn't take away sin. He says, "So
[1:08:11] Abraham and them back there in paradise
[1:08:13] having a good song that morning perhaps
[1:08:15] along about 2:00 in the morning with
[1:08:18] time on earth. I can see him walk up
[1:08:19] there to the gates of paradise and
[1:08:22] knock." Now, I don't think people knock
[1:08:24] on the doors of paradise very often.
[1:08:28] And you have to imagine that at that
[1:08:30] knock something stirred in the hearts of
[1:08:32] the believers there who have been
[1:08:34] waiting, who have been fellowshipping,
[1:08:36] who have been testifying in faith,
[1:08:38] waiting for this day. He says, "And I
[1:08:40] can hear Abraham say, I wonder who that
[1:08:42] is." He opened up the door and Abraham
[1:08:45] said, "Well, there he is, the one I saw
[1:08:46] in a vision." I can hear Daniel raise up
[1:08:49] and say, "I know him. He's the rock that
[1:08:51] I saw heweed out of the mountain without
[1:08:53] hands." I can hear Ezekiel say, "Yes,
[1:08:55] that's him. He's the one I saw coming in
[1:08:58] the clouds with dust under his feet.
[1:09:00] Hallelujah. Oh, there he stands. And he
[1:09:02] said, "Children, you died under good
[1:09:05] faith." Job said, "That's the one I call
[1:09:07] my redeemer, for I know the deliverance
[1:09:10] is nigh now." That's him. He said he had
[1:09:14] to witness to everything. He had to go
[1:09:17] to the lowest regions to the highest
[1:09:19] heavens and witness from all of
[1:09:21] them what? That the word was true. that
[1:09:25] the covenant was good, that God is not a
[1:09:27] liar. He said he witnessed to the earth,
[1:09:30] to hell, to the lost souls, back up here
[1:09:32] to paradise. He said, "You were
[1:09:33] faithful. Now, come on. We're going up
[1:09:36] this morning. It's almost daylight. They
[1:09:38] have my body sealed in up yonder. I've
[1:09:40] got a different body." He says, "When a
[1:09:42] saint dies, I'm not able to tell you
[1:09:43] what kind of a body he receives, but
[1:09:45] it's not a glorified body. It's not a
[1:09:47] spirit, but it's some kind of a body
[1:09:49] that lasts until the resurrection."
[1:09:52] And when he said, "I haven't received
[1:09:53] this glorification yet, but I'm going up
[1:09:55] and we're going to come out in a few
[1:09:57] minutes." I can hear Sarah say, "Come
[1:09:58] on, Abraham." All of them get together
[1:10:01] and the saints rallying around him.
[1:10:02] First thing you know, it's along about
[1:10:04] daylight. And I can hear Abraham say,
[1:10:06] "Master, you're going to wait around a
[1:10:08] little while. Can we make a little
[1:10:10] whistle stop before we go up to glory?
[1:10:12] I'd like to look the old home place over
[1:10:14] again." "Well, sure," he said. Sure. I'm
[1:10:16] going to be with my disciples 40 days
[1:10:18] and nights. Come on. And away they went.
[1:10:20] He said the morning star gave its light.
[1:10:23] The angel of God came and rolled away
[1:10:25] the stone. And the Bible in Matthew 27
[1:10:28] said that the saints that had slept in
[1:10:30] the dust of the earth rose and came out
[1:10:32] of the graves and and appeared to many.
[1:10:35] Can you imagine the shock waves rolling
[1:10:37] through every dimension that morning?
[1:10:39] There's a lot of change that was going.
[1:10:41] Remember on the day he died, the earth
[1:10:43] shook. There was an earthquake. All of
[1:10:46] nature stopped for a while. darkness for
[1:10:49] three hours. Everything came to a
[1:10:51] screeching halt at his death. The veil
[1:10:53] was
[1:10:55] torn. Then he goes down into hell and he
[1:10:58] starts working his way from the bottom
[1:11:00] up. And he goes into hell and he takes
[1:11:03] the keys of death and hell and the
[1:11:05] grave. And then he goes up into
[1:11:07] paradise and he takes the saints out of
[1:11:10] there and they rise with him. Church,
[1:11:12] you see that everywhere that Christ
[1:11:14] goes, victory goes with him. Amen. He
[1:11:16] goes as a conqueror. He may look like
[1:11:18] he's defeated as a bloody lamb, but the
[1:11:21] spirit of a lion is inside of him. And
[1:11:23] the lion always conquers. He's the king.
[1:11:26] He's the ruler. He cannot be defeated.
[1:11:28] Amen. Everything that Jesus does, he
[1:11:30] takes control of. You talk about
[1:11:32] bruising Satan's head. He went there and
[1:11:35] he took the keys to his own house. Satan
[1:11:38] is dwelling in a place of torment and
[1:11:40] it's not even
[1:11:42] his. You're in a sad state when the
[1:11:44] place you live, you don't own. And it's
[1:11:46] a horrible place to begin with.
[1:11:48] He can't even own the worst place there
[1:11:49] is to be. Christ comes down, takes those
[1:11:52] keys, and hangs them on his belt and
[1:11:54] says, "Now I'm in control." You'll have
[1:11:56] a time, Satan. But there's a day when
[1:11:59] it's all going to be finished. Satan has
[1:12:01] no power even in his own kingdom. Then
[1:12:03] paradise full of saints waiting for
[1:12:05] thousands and thousands of years, fully
[1:12:07] expecting that great day. Can you
[1:12:09] imagine that thief? I think there's was
[1:12:11] it Alistister Beg uh that preached a
[1:12:13] sermon, the man in the middle. He says,
[1:12:15] "Where that thief comes up to paradise
[1:12:17] and he knocks on the door." They say,
[1:12:18] "Who are you?" He says, "I'm so and so."
[1:12:21] "I'm a thief. I just died." They say,
[1:12:22] "How are you going to get in?" He said,
[1:12:24] "The man in the middle said, "I could
[1:12:25] go." And he is received into paradise,
[1:12:29] having been a thief all of his life, a
[1:12:31] man that was worthy to die. And he steps
[1:12:34] into paradise on the words of Jesus
[1:12:36] Christ. And then 36 hours later, he's
[1:12:40] back up and he's rolling through
[1:12:42] Jerusalem in a glorified body. church.
[1:12:44] Is he a merciful God? Is he a gracious
[1:12:47] God? Is he a loving God? That one word
[1:12:49] of acceptance and he'll take and give
[1:12:50] you eternal
[1:12:52] life. Can you imagine that thief
[1:12:57] saying? What a mighty God we serve. How
[1:13:00] long did you serve him? I lasted about
[1:13:02] two hours after he
[1:13:04] died. But for those two hours, he
[1:13:08] believed. He believed. and he's walking
[1:13:12] through in a glorified body lesson two
[1:13:13] days later. Hallelujah. What a morning
[1:13:17] that was for the thief. You ask me why
[1:13:20] I'm happy. So I'll just tell you why.
[1:13:21] Because my sins are gone. And he had a
[1:13:23] lot of sins. He lived a he lived a life
[1:13:26] of sin totally and completely. He died
[1:13:28] for it. And yet he rose again two days
[1:13:31] later. A glorified son of God. God's
[1:13:35] going to get his children, church. God's
[1:13:37] going to get his children. Hallelujah.
[1:13:40] But we look at that morning. We're
[1:13:42] preaching on joy in the morning. And I
[1:13:44] want to read the resurrection story this
[1:13:45] morning. And in Matthew 28, it says in
[1:13:47] the end of the Sabbath as it began to
[1:13:50] dawn toward the first day of the week.
[1:13:52] This is the first watch. So remember on
[1:13:55] the Sabbath, you can't do any survi work
[1:13:57] until that first watch. So this is
[1:14:00] sometime between 6:00 and 9:00 a.m. It
[1:14:03] says, "Came Mary Magdalene and the other
[1:14:05] Mary to see the supplr. And behold,
[1:14:07] there was a great earthquake, for the
[1:14:09] angel of the Lord descended from heaven,
[1:14:11] and came and rolled back the stone from
[1:14:14] the door, and sat upon it. His
[1:14:15] countenance was like lightning, and his
[1:14:17] raignment white as snow. And for fear of
[1:14:19] him the keepers did shake, and became as
[1:14:21] dead men. And the angel answered and
[1:14:24] said unto the women, "Fear ye not. Fear
[1:14:26] not ye, for I know that you seek Jesus,
[1:14:29] which was crucified." He says, "He's not
[1:14:32] here, for he is risen as he said.
[1:14:37] He always points back to his word. I
[1:14:41] told you I'm going to rise again. I told
[1:14:43] you I had to die. I told you I'm going
[1:14:45] to rise again. He says, "Come and see
[1:14:47] the place where the Lord lay and go
[1:14:49] quickly and tell his disciples that he
[1:14:51] has risen from the dead. And behold, he
[1:14:53] goeth forth before you into Galilee.
[1:14:55] There shall ye see him. Lo, I've told
[1:14:57] you." And they departed quickly from the
[1:14:59] sephiler with fear and great joy and did
[1:15:03] run to bring his disciples word. Can you
[1:15:05] imagine being the first to get the news
[1:15:06] he's risen? That with your eyes you see
[1:15:09] that he is risen. You have an angel
[1:15:11] speak to you a message. He's risen. You
[1:15:13] talk about joy in the morning. And who
[1:15:15] gets this joy
[1:15:17] first. Who does Jesus appear to first?
[1:15:20] Church? That fallen woman, Mary
[1:15:23] Magdalene. Mary Magdalene was the worst
[1:15:25] of the lot if we were looking at them
[1:15:26] carnally. Remember, she was one of
[1:15:28] Jesus' first miracles and he cast seven
[1:15:30] demons out of her. She was a broken
[1:15:33] woman.
[1:15:35] She went from being possessed to being a
[1:15:38] woman
[1:15:39] transformed under the ministry of
[1:15:41] Christ. And he comes to this woman and
[1:15:43] he says, "Mary." And as soon as he says,
[1:15:45] "Mary," she says, "smaster." And he
[1:15:47] says, "Don't touch me. I've still got to
[1:15:49] go to my father." He says, "But go tell
[1:15:50] them. Go tell them I'm coming." And so
[1:15:53] she goes and she tells the
[1:15:55] disciples. And what do they do?
[1:15:59] Disbelieve. They disbelieve.
[1:16:02] Now, Peter goes and runs. John goes and
[1:16:04] runs with
[1:16:05] them. And they go and they look at the
[1:16:07] tomb. And they go away. And they're
[1:16:09] pondering in their hearts what's going
[1:16:11] on because he's not there. But they
[1:16:13] still can't believe it. What joy they
[1:16:15] ought to have had as Mary comes and says
[1:16:17] he's risen. But their unbelief in the
[1:16:20] word keeps them from having joy. And
[1:16:22] they continue to suffer and they
[1:16:24] continue to mourn and they continue to
[1:16:25] beat themselves up. Remember he gave
[1:16:27] that message to Peter. Tell my disciples
[1:16:29] and Peter, Peter, it doesn't matter that
[1:16:31] you betrayed me. It doesn't matter that
[1:16:33] you turned your back on me. Doesn't
[1:16:35] matter that you walked away, Peter. I'm
[1:16:37] still coming back. You're still my guy,
[1:16:39] Peter. You're still my son. Peter should
[1:16:42] have had such joy that morning. But
[1:16:44] because of his unbelief, he could not
[1:16:46] have the benefit of the resurrection.
[1:16:48] And so, he endured for hours these
[1:16:50] different things.
[1:16:52] Finally, Jesus comes back to them and he
[1:16:54] goes and he appears in the room
[1:16:56] personally and they finally believe. And
[1:16:57] the scripture says this. It says, "Then
[1:16:59] the same day at evening being the first
[1:17:01] day of the week when the doors were
[1:17:03] shut." Now remember, he's been alive
[1:17:04] since the morning and they've been
[1:17:06] mourning into the evening. They wasted
[1:17:08] 12 hours maybe 12 hours of morning
[1:17:11] because of their unbelief. church. He
[1:17:14] says, "When the doors were shut where
[1:17:15] the disciples were assembled for fear of
[1:17:17] the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the
[1:17:19] midst and saith unto them, peace be unto
[1:17:22] you. And when he had self said, he
[1:17:24] showed them his hands and his side. And
[1:17:26] then were the disciples glad when they
[1:17:28] saw the Lord." That word glad means that
[1:17:30] they rejoiced and were joyful. We're
[1:17:33] speaking on joy in the morning, but for
[1:17:34] them it was joy in the evening because
[1:17:36] of their unbelief.
[1:17:38] So many times, church, we look and we'd
[1:17:41] see the situation rather than the word,
[1:17:43] and we lose our joy. And if we took the
[1:17:46] word on our lips and in our heart, we'd
[1:17:48] have joy, even though there is nothing v
[1:17:51] visible. We walk by faith, not by sight.
[1:17:55] We live by the light of the word, not by
[1:17:57] the light of circumstances, because
[1:17:59] those circumstances will beat us up
[1:18:01] every single time. Listen, church, these
[1:18:03] were sincere. These were children of
[1:18:05] God, weren't they? These were sincere
[1:18:08] believers. They had sat under Jesus
[1:18:10] ministry for three and a half years and
[1:18:12] yet unbelief had overtaken
[1:18:15] them. What a condition we can get
[1:18:19] sometimes. They could have had that joy
[1:18:21] a whole lot earlier. How often could we
[1:18:24] cut our sorrow short if we looked at
[1:18:26] what the word says rather than what
[1:18:27] circumstances are trying to tell us?
[1:18:29] Because Satan will beat us up through
[1:18:31] circumstances every
[1:18:33] time. Every time.
[1:18:36] every time you're not going to be
[1:18:38] healed. You're not going to get the
[1:18:39] business you need. That relationship's
[1:18:41] not going to be mended. Those kids
[1:18:42] aren't coming back. They're going
[1:18:43] further and
[1:18:45] further. Listen, circumstances defeat
[1:18:48] faith if you focus on it. That's why we
[1:18:51] focus on the word. That's why we feed on
[1:18:53] the word of God. Thomas wasn't even
[1:18:56] there when Jesus came. And so now all
[1:18:59] the disciples and Mary are and the two
[1:19:02] from Emmas, they're saying, "Thomas, no,
[1:19:04] he's alive." Thomas says, "Though I put
[1:19:05] my finger in his in his side and though
[1:19:07] I touch his hands, that's the only time
[1:19:09] I'll believe." And so Jesus finally
[1:19:11] comes to there when Thomas is there
[1:19:13] eight days later. So Thomas has now gone
[1:19:15] eight and a half days in sorrow. Why?
[1:19:18] Because he won't believe the testimony
[1:19:20] of the believers. He won't believe the
[1:19:22] word. Finally Jesus comes in. He says,
[1:19:24] "Okay, Thomas, put your finger in my
[1:19:25] side. Put it in my hands. Do you believe
[1:19:27] now?" And he says, "My Lord and Christ."
[1:19:29] And Jesus says these words. He says,
[1:19:31] "Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because
[1:19:34] thou hast seen me, thou hast believed.
[1:19:36] Blessed are they that have not seen and
[1:19:39] yet have believed." Because remember
[1:19:42] this experience of seeing a risen Christ
[1:19:44] physically where you could touch and
[1:19:45] feel and hear. That was only for a
[1:19:48] select
[1:19:49] few. That's only for that group for that
[1:19:52] day. And so they got a personal witness
[1:19:56] of a resurrected Christ.
[1:19:58] But remember, Jesus said, "You're all
[1:20:00] going to be witnesses for
[1:20:01] me." Paul was a witness of Jesus. And
[1:20:05] Paul was a witness of the resurrected
[1:20:07] Christ, not because he had touched and
[1:20:09] handled the body, but because he had
[1:20:10] received the same spirit that raised
[1:20:12] Christ from the dead. Those that have
[1:20:14] what? Not seen and yet have believed.
[1:20:17] Now, yes, Paul saw the pillar of fire,
[1:20:20] but that was not the body of
[1:20:22] Christ. That was the supernatural body
[1:20:24] of light. Didn't look like the man
[1:20:26] Jesus. Pill of fire doesn't have a beard
[1:20:28] and holes in his hands
[1:20:30] inside. But yet Paul was a witness of a
[1:20:32] resurrected Christ. And you and I are
[1:20:33] the very same thing today. There's a
[1:20:35] people that have not seen and yet they
[1:20:37] have believed. And Jesus spends 40 days
[1:20:40] with his disciples and he's building
[1:20:42] them up, encouraging them, helping them,
[1:20:44] uh instructing them on what's going to
[1:20:46] come for the next phase of their life.
[1:20:48] And look at these words just before
[1:20:49] Jesus descended. It says, "But you will
[1:20:52] receive power when the Holy Spirit comes
[1:20:55] upon you." The Holy Spirit is the power
[1:20:58] we
[1:20:59] need. I've said it before. They had all
[1:21:03] sorts of power to cast out demons, heal
[1:21:05] the sick, raise the dead. That's not the
[1:21:06] power that was going to take them
[1:21:08] through. He says, "And you will be my
[1:21:10] witnesses both in Jerusalem and all
[1:21:12] Judea and Samaria and even to the ends
[1:21:15] of the worst of the earth." So there's a
[1:21:17] witness that's required, but it's not a
[1:21:19] witness of just what we have seen and
[1:21:21] heard. It's a witness that has to be
[1:21:23] experienced in our own
[1:21:25] bodies. Even to this point, they're
[1:21:28] still
[1:21:29] struggling because why? They haven't
[1:21:32] been changed yet. They're still fighting
[1:21:34] this nature. They're still fighting this
[1:21:35] flesh. And Jesus said, "You've got to
[1:21:37] receive power to be my witness." And
[1:21:39] that power is not just power to raise
[1:21:41] the dead or heal the sick or these
[1:21:43] things, but it's a power to have God
[1:21:45] come inside us and lead us and guide us
[1:21:47] and walk us through this life and help
[1:21:50] us to lay our thoughts aside and lay our
[1:21:52] ideas aside and lay our opinions aside,
[1:21:54] lay our fears aside, lay our worries
[1:21:56] aside and say, "Lord, let you lead me
[1:21:59] and I'll just follow along in your
[1:22:00] footsteps." That's the power that they
[1:22:02] needed. But watch now as we start to
[1:22:05] close this morning. Jesus prepares the
[1:22:07] disciples for what's coming and he
[1:22:09] ascends into the heavens. And we see
[1:22:11] here that the joy of that day does not
[1:22:13] stop on earth. But now it resounds but
[1:22:16] back up into the heavens. Amen. Now he's
[1:22:18] going up and the joy keeps rolling
[1:22:20] throughout the heavenly places. After 40
[1:22:23] days on earth, he comes back to heaven.
[1:22:26] And we see that wherever he goes,
[1:22:27] there's a victory. The shout of the king
[1:22:30] is in the camp. There's a victory parade
[1:22:32] everywhere Christ goes. And I want us to
[1:22:35] kind of look into the heavenlies this
[1:22:36] morning. He says after 40 days and
[1:22:39] nights they visit the earth. They heard
[1:22:40] him saying, the New Testament s or the
[1:22:42] Old Testament saints heard him saying,
[1:22:44] someday we'll return him back.
[1:22:46] Hallelujah. Then when Jesus was taken
[1:22:48] up, the saints went with them. The Bible
[1:22:50] said he led captivity captive and gave
[1:22:53] gifts unto men. Whatever bounds binds
[1:22:56] you, he has bound. Whatever hurts you,
[1:23:00] he has disarmed.
[1:23:02] Everything that comes against us, he has
[1:23:04] given us the antidote
[1:23:06] for. He says, "I can see him as he goes
[1:23:09] on up past the morning stars, past the
[1:23:11] moon, past the sun, on into the
[1:23:13] archangels, beyond them, on into the
[1:23:16] heavens of heaven." And the first thing
[1:23:17] you know, they come in sight of the
[1:23:19] great ivory palace. I can hear the Old
[1:23:21] Testament saying, "Lift up, ye
[1:23:23] everlasting gates, and be lifted up, and
[1:23:26] let the king of glory come in."
[1:23:28] Hallelujah. He says, "David's prophecy
[1:23:30] had to be fulfilled. There he comes
[1:23:32] triumphant walking. Here he come
[1:23:35] walking. God's word is eternally true.
[1:23:38] See, he has to witness from the lowest
[1:23:40] region to the highest region. It's all
[1:23:43] subject to the word of God. He said he's
[1:23:46] coming again going walking down through
[1:23:48] their tri triumphant. And I hear the Old
[1:23:50] Testament saints rallying around him.
[1:23:52] This is the redeemer. Lift up ye
[1:23:54] everlasting gates and be ye lifted up
[1:23:56] and let the King of glory come in.
[1:23:58] church. Remember, they knew these psalms
[1:24:01] and they would sing them at the
[1:24:02] different feasts and these different
[1:24:03] things, but they would sing them looking
[1:24:05] forward to the day when it would happen.
[1:24:07] But now, as they're walking up with
[1:24:09] their mighty conqueror, they start to
[1:24:12] speak the word and say, "It's
[1:24:13] fulfilled." What a moment that must have
[1:24:16] been. Marching up into the heavens and
[1:24:19] you're coming up to the gates and you
[1:24:21] say, "The word is being fulfilled." And
[1:24:23] now you can sing that song in a reality
[1:24:26] that you are a part of it. What a moment
[1:24:29] that must have been. He says, "I can
[1:24:31] hear the angels back over in the
[1:24:34] glorious presence place of God say, who
[1:24:36] is this king of glory? It's a duet
[1:24:40] inside and out." And that's what the
[1:24:42] Bible said. And the Old Testament ang
[1:24:44] saints said, "The Lord of hosts mighty
[1:24:46] in battle. Here he comes, the king with
[1:24:48] his delegates." See, his word brings his
[1:24:50] word. And they were a part of his word.
[1:24:53] They've received it in part, but now
[1:24:55] they're walking into the totality of it.
[1:24:57] Now they're receiving the fullness of
[1:24:58] the covenant that they believed. Abraham
[1:25:00] seed the king with his delegates, the
[1:25:02] conqueror. He's a mighty conqueror since
[1:25:04] he rent the veil in two. He says, "And
[1:25:06] the angel pressed the gates down through
[1:25:08] the city of Jerusalem came Jesus the
[1:25:11] conqueror with all the Old Testament
[1:25:13] saints that lived back there believing
[1:25:14] he would come sometime. I can see him
[1:25:17] marching as angelic bands beating and
[1:25:19] playing and the angels sing hosana."
[1:25:21] Here comes the Old Testament saints and
[1:25:23] Jesus walking through the streets right
[1:25:25] up in front of the father. He said,
[1:25:26] 'Father, these are those that died in
[1:25:29] good faith. Well done, my son. Climb up
[1:25:32] here on my throne and sit down at my
[1:25:34] right hand till I make every enemy your
[1:25:35] foottool. For one of these days I'm
[1:25:38] going down. He says,
[1:25:39] hallelujah. He said, I'm going to send
[1:25:41] you back again and get everyone that
[1:25:44] dies in faith. Amen. There he is, the
[1:25:47] mighty conqueror sitting at the right
[1:25:49] hand of the majesty of God tonight in
[1:25:51] his presence, making intercession on
[1:25:54] anybody here that will dare to take him
[1:25:57] by faith. He says, "And God will send
[1:26:00] the Holy Ghost down to seal you into the
[1:26:03] kingdom of
[1:26:04] God." What a moment that must have been.
[1:26:07] He's the first man to go down to hell
[1:26:10] and come back,
[1:26:11] church. He didn't come
[1:26:13] up. I barely made it.
[1:26:16] Oh, I just survived. It was close, guys.
[1:26:19] It was close. No, no, no, no, no. He
[1:26:23] walked up, head held high, chest out,
[1:26:26] mighty conqueror, not a fallen
[1:26:29] hero, not a broken soldier. He came up,
[1:26:33] king of kings, lord of lords, the
[1:26:37] prevailing lion of the tribe of Judah.
[1:26:40] Amen. And
[1:26:42] just so tough, guys.
[1:26:45] You just don't know what I went through.
[1:26:48] No, no, no. Woe is
[1:26:51] me. He came up and said, "I am he that
[1:26:54] was and is and is forever
[1:26:58] more." The Alpha, the Omega, the
[1:27:02] beginning and the end, the amen, the
[1:27:04] faithful one. That's who came up. That's
[1:27:07] who came up.
[1:27:09] Amen. That's the kind of God I believe
[1:27:11] in, church. That's the savior that I
[1:27:14] believe we have on Christ the solid rock
[1:27:17] I
[1:27:18] stand. What does it say? My hope, his
[1:27:22] what is it? His oath, his
[1:27:24] covenant, his blood surrounds me in the
[1:27:28] whelming flood when all around my soul
[1:27:30] gives way. He then is all my hope and
[1:27:32] stay. On Christ the solid rock I stand.
[1:27:35] All other ground is sinking sand. Amen.
[1:27:39] Unfailing God in flesh marches up. and
[1:27:42] they open the gates and he returns the
[1:27:44] mighty
[1:27:45] conqueror. I want to take us back to
[1:27:47] Revelation 5 as we start to close us out
[1:27:49] this evening or this morning. We see
[1:27:52] that bloody lamb that was slain, his
[1:27:54] body destroyed for our sins, his blood
[1:27:56] released for our life. And now he's
[1:27:58] standing next to the throne and we see
[1:27:59] the scene that we closed with last
[1:28:01] service. Remember where the book of
[1:28:03] redemption, the book of life was there
[1:28:04] and no one was no one was worthy to take
[1:28:06] it and John cried and cried. He wept. He
[1:28:09] could not be consoled. But verse 5 says,
[1:28:11] 'And one of the elders saith unto me,
[1:28:13] weepad not, John, behold, the lion of
[1:28:16] the tribe of Judah, the root of David,
[1:28:18] hath prevailed to open the book, and to
[1:28:20] loose the seals thereof. And I beheld,
[1:28:23] and lo, in the midst of the throne, and
[1:28:25] of the four beasts, and in the midst of
[1:28:26] the elders stood a lamb as it had been
[1:28:29] slain, having seven horns and seven
[1:28:32] eyes, which are the seven spirits of
[1:28:34] God, sent forth unto all the earth.
[1:28:36] That's your seven church age messengers.
[1:28:38] He says, "And he came and he took the
[1:28:40] book out of the right hand of him that
[1:28:41] sat upon the throne. And when he had
[1:28:44] taken the
[1:28:45] book," See, he's got to take it for
[1:28:47] anything to really
[1:28:48] happen. It's not just saying he's
[1:28:51] worthy. It's when he takes it because
[1:28:53] that's the proof that he was worthy. And
[1:28:55] when he had taken the book, the four
[1:28:57] beasts and the four and 20 elders fell
[1:28:59] down before the lamb, having every one
[1:29:01] of them harps and golden vials full of
[1:29:02] odors, which are the prayers of saints.
[1:29:05] And they sung a new song, saying, Thou
[1:29:08] art worthy to take the book, and to open
[1:29:09] the seals thereof. For thou was slain,
[1:29:12] and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood
[1:29:15] out of every kindred and tongue and
[1:29:17] people and nation. This is Abraham's
[1:29:19] covenant being
[1:29:20] fulfilled. You did it. You did it. You
[1:29:24] did it. And we get
[1:29:28] redeemed. He says, "What? You're worthy
[1:29:32] because you died. You redeemed us." and
[1:29:35] it's your blood that bakes a way for us.
[1:29:39] It's the fulfillment of Abraham's
[1:29:40] covenant and made us and has made us
[1:29:43] unto our gods, kings and priests, and we
[1:29:45] shall reign on the earth. He says, "And
[1:29:49] I beheld and heard the voice of many
[1:29:51] angels round about the throne. and the
[1:29:54] beasts and the elders and the number of
[1:29:56] them was 10,000 times 10,000 and
[1:29:59] thousands of thousands saying with a
[1:30:01] loud voice, "Worthy is the lamb that was
[1:30:03] slain to receive power and riches and
[1:30:06] wisdom and strength and honor and glory
[1:30:08] and blessing. And every creature catch
[1:30:11] us now. Every creature which was in
[1:30:13] heaven and on the earth and under the
[1:30:15] earth and such as are all in the sea and
[1:30:17] all that are in them heard I saying
[1:30:20] blessing and honor and glory and power
[1:30:23] be unto him that siteth upon the throne
[1:30:25] and unto the lamb forever and ever. You
[1:30:28] talk about joy in the morning church.
[1:30:29] John shouted and everyone heard him all
[1:30:33] the way from hell to heaven. Everybody
[1:30:35] heard him shout out. And what did he
[1:30:37] shout out? blessing and honor and glory
[1:30:41] and power. Why? Because redemption is
[1:30:44] now opened up. Because there's a pathway
[1:30:47] back to God. That bridge we talked about
[1:30:49] on Friday from the earth to the moon of
[1:30:51] our salvation, it's back. Somebody built
[1:30:54] what could not be built. Somebody
[1:30:56] crossed the gap that we could not c that
[1:30:58] we could not cross. He's shouting
[1:31:00] because he knows that he's in that
[1:31:03] book. He's in that book. And now he's
[1:31:06] going to make it.
[1:31:08] Hallelujah. But notice he doesn't start
[1:31:10] shouting until he sees the lamb take the
[1:31:13] book because that's when redemption
[1:31:16] starts. When he takes the book now it's
[1:31:18] in his hand and he looses he can loose
[1:31:20] the seals. He can open it up. He can
[1:31:22] start reading it. He can start sharing
[1:31:24] it. He can come and claim we're redeemed
[1:31:26] but he's got to come take his
[1:31:27] possession. And that's what the
[1:31:29] resurrection and the rapture is. But I
[1:31:31] want you to take to take us to another
[1:31:33] moment this this morning because we see
[1:31:36] Christ is holding that
[1:31:38] book and John shouted when he took the
[1:31:41] book. But remember that was the title
[1:31:43] deed of redemption. That was the title
[1:31:45] deed to the earth that Adam held in his
[1:31:47] hand and when he was on this earth he
[1:31:49] was the son of God. The scripture says
[1:31:50] Adam was the son of God. But he lost
[1:31:53] that and he fell from his position. And
[1:31:54] when he did, the title deed of earth,
[1:31:56] that book of redemption went back to
[1:31:58] God. Because remember, it's the book of
[1:32:00] life. And what did God say to Adam and
[1:32:02] Eve? He says, "Go forth and prosper." In
[1:32:06] other words, produce what's in the book.
[1:32:09] That's what they were supposed to
[1:32:11] do. But they didn't do it. They took it
[1:32:14] the wrong way. And God had to take it
[1:32:16] back. And now God had to produce his
[1:32:17] sons a different way.
[1:32:19] He took it
[1:32:21] back. But now we're in that plan of
[1:32:23] redemption. That's what John's showing
[1:32:24] us through Christ. And we're coming back
[1:32:26] to our eating condition. And so within
[1:32:28] that book is our true position and our
[1:32:30] true authority as the bride, as the
[1:32:32] children of God. But before that
[1:32:35] authority comes, church, character has
[1:32:37] to come first. Amen. And so that's the
[1:32:39] time that we're in now. That's what's
[1:32:41] going on now in our lives is he's
[1:32:43] developing character to match the
[1:32:44] authority of sons and daughters of God.
[1:32:47] And then when that's done, when our
[1:32:48] character matches that, then Christ
[1:32:50] comes down, the head unites with the
[1:32:52] body and there's that quick short work
[1:32:55] where Christ says, "She is me and I am
[1:32:58] her." And he proves to the world one
[1:33:01] last time that he's alive and well. And
[1:33:03] then after 30 or 40 days, we go. But
[1:33:06] we're in the moment of the character
[1:33:07] development. Now, I want to read this
[1:33:10] out of Revelation 10. This is a bride
[1:33:11] scripture. It's a bride chapter. And I
[1:33:14] saw another mighty angel come down from
[1:33:16] heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[1:33:17] rainbow was upon his head and his face
[1:33:20] were as it were the sun and his feet as
[1:33:22] pillars of fire. You look in Revelation
[1:33:23] 1. We know very clearly that's Christ.
[1:33:26] It says, "And he had in his hand a
[1:33:28] little book open." Now notice it is a
[1:33:30] small book. It's not a big book. Okay?
[1:33:34] The people of God have always been a
[1:33:36] minority. Always been a minority. It's a
[1:33:38] small group. Relatively speaking, this
[1:33:40] bride of Christ, we just read there. He
[1:33:42] said 10,000s time 10,000s. Now 10,000*
[1:33:45] 10,000 is 100 million. You say that
[1:33:47] sounds like a lot of people. When you
[1:33:49] look at the idea that they believe
[1:33:50] there's been a 100red billion people in
[1:33:52] this earth so far, that
[1:33:57] means.1%. So 99.9% have not been
[1:34:00] children of
[1:34:01] God. He said 10,000s time 10,000. So if
[1:34:05] we move that up and we say, well, we
[1:34:07] could go all the way up to 10 of those,
[1:34:08] then that would be a billion, 1%.
[1:34:11] 1% of the entire earth was children of
[1:34:13] God. It's a small book because later
[1:34:16] they open up
[1:34:17] books, all the books, but there's only
[1:34:20] one small book and it's a book of life.
[1:34:22] Now notice a little book. It's not
[1:34:25] sealed now. It's open. The seals have
[1:34:27] been broken. The book is open. It's able
[1:34:29] to be read and
[1:34:30] understood. He says, "And he set his
[1:34:32] right foot upon the sea and his left
[1:34:34] foot on the earth." So we see that
[1:34:36] Christ is here and he's holding down all
[1:34:37] powers. His feet are on everything
[1:34:39] that's on the earth. And you go into the
[1:34:42] types and shadows of of the sea is
[1:34:43] usually people and and the earth would
[1:34:45] be powers and these different things.
[1:34:47] But notice here that he has taken all
[1:34:49] circumstances under his control. When he
[1:34:52] comes down with the open book, he comes
[1:34:54] down, he takes all things under his
[1:34:55] control. Earthly powers, what's going on
[1:34:57] in this earth will not stop him from
[1:34:59] coming down and taking what's in this
[1:35:00] book. He's coming down now to possess.
[1:35:03] Nothing will stop this process. And he
[1:35:05] cried with a loud voices when a lion
[1:35:07] roarth. And when he had cried, seven
[1:35:09] thunders uttered their voices. You go
[1:35:11] back to John 12 and you'll see that when
[1:35:12] thunder speaks, it's God speaking.
[1:35:15] That's the voice of God. He says, "And
[1:35:17] when the seven thunders had uttered
[1:35:18] their voices, I was about to write. And
[1:35:20] I heard a voice from heaven saying unto
[1:35:22] me, seal up those things which the seven
[1:35:24] thunders uttered and write them not."
[1:35:25] He's saying to John, "Keep them a
[1:35:27] secret, John. You heard them. You
[1:35:28] understand them, but you can't pass it
[1:35:30] on. It's a
[1:35:31] secret, but it won't stay a secret
[1:35:34] forever. He says, "For when the
[1:35:40] Sorry." Yes. And write them not. And the
[1:35:43] angel which I saw stand upon the sea and
[1:35:46] upon the earth, lifted up his hand to
[1:35:47] heavens, and swore by him that liveth
[1:35:50] forever and ever, who created heaven,
[1:35:52] and the things that therein are, and the
[1:35:54] earth, and the things that therein are,
[1:35:55] and the sea, and the things which
[1:35:56] therein are, that there should be time
[1:35:58] no longer. Now, this is not the end of
[1:36:00] time, okay? This is the end of
[1:36:03] redemption for the Gentiles and Christ
[1:36:05] coming back for his bride. The unknown
[1:36:08] clock runs out here, if I could put it
[1:36:10] that way. Because remember, God deals
[1:36:11] with Gentiles in seasons and ages. And
[1:36:14] with the Jews, he works in years. He's
[1:36:17] on a timeline. He's on a clock with the
[1:36:19] Jews. But for the Gentiles, we're in an
[1:36:20] unknown clock. We don't know when it is.
[1:36:22] Remember, Jesus said, "No man knows the
[1:36:24] day nor the hour." Right? So, we don't
[1:36:26] know. But what we know is that when this
[1:36:28] thing happens, that's when the rapture
[1:36:31] is going to go because the clock runs
[1:36:33] out. Because once the rap once the bride
[1:36:36] raptures, what happens? We have a known
[1:36:38] clock that starts ticking because as
[1:36:40] soon as the bride goes up, the clock
[1:36:41] starts ticking with the Jews. And it's
[1:36:43] three and a half years of tribulation,
[1:36:45] right? And then at the end of that, you
[1:36:47] have a few weeks. If you go look in the
[1:36:48] Old Testament, you see there that
[1:36:50] there's a few weeks to do this and a few
[1:36:51] weeks to do that. So you have a little
[1:36:53] time after that. And then you jump right
[1:36:54] into the millennium. And that time we're
[1:36:56] on a clock as well, a thousand years.
[1:36:58] And then when the millennium's over,
[1:36:59] then you have that period where there's
[1:37:01] that final battle. And then you have a
[1:37:02] new heaven and a new earth. So here is
[1:37:04] where the unknown clock runs out. And
[1:37:06] what it is is God says, "I'm finishing
[1:37:08] what I started." That's what it
[1:37:12] means. So when will this happen? When
[1:37:15] will this clock run out? When will God
[1:37:17] kick off this final process?
[1:37:20] It says, "But in the days of the voice
[1:37:21] of the seventh
[1:37:23] angel when he shall begin to sound." Now
[1:37:27] that's that seventh church age messenger
[1:37:28] from Revelation 3. Remember to the
[1:37:30] latest in church age. It's the final
[1:37:32] age. And he's bringing that restoring
[1:37:33] message of Malachi 4. He says in the
[1:37:35] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:37:37] when he shall begin to sound. When he
[1:37:39] brings his message, he says the mystery
[1:37:41] of God should be finished which he as he
[1:37:44] had declared to his servants the
[1:37:45] prophets. What is the mystery of God
[1:37:47] church? Paul said, "It's Christ in you,
[1:37:49] the hope of glory." And it's been
[1:37:51] revealed all in types and shadows down
[1:37:53] through time. You look at Joseph, a
[1:37:56] nearly perfect type of Christ. Remember,
[1:37:58] goes all the way down into prison and
[1:37:59] then rises up to the right hand. You
[1:38:02] look at David speaking through the
[1:38:03] Psalms of what Christ went through. My
[1:38:05] bones, my bones, they stare at me, but
[1:38:07] thou will not let my uh uh let your holy
[1:38:10] one see corruption. All these things. It
[1:38:13] was it was God working through men
[1:38:15] showing that there's coming a day when
[1:38:16] he would be truly united in perfection.
[1:38:19] But it was all in types and shadows in
[1:38:21] the Old Testament. Then you come into
[1:38:23] the New Testament and under that first
[1:38:24] church age, that original Pentecostal
[1:38:27] church under the prophet Paul, they were
[1:38:29] imperfection for a mid, but they fell
[1:38:32] away from their first love. But there's
[1:38:35] a perfection coming. There's a
[1:38:36] completing of that word in the bride
[1:38:38] that's going to take her into a
[1:38:40] resurrection and a rapture. And what is
[1:38:41] it going to be by? It's going to be by
[1:38:43] the restored work. That's the only thing
[1:38:45] that's going to do it. Amen. There's a
[1:38:47] perfection coming where that head Christ
[1:38:49] is joined to the body and she is exactly
[1:38:51] as she is. And so we see the seven
[1:38:53] angel. Remember he's coming down the the
[1:38:55] angel Christ comes down with an open
[1:38:57] book. And so that seventh church's
[1:38:59] messenger is preaching out of a book
[1:39:01] that was sealed for all these
[1:39:03] ages. And what is it? It's the fully
[1:39:05] restored word. It's the open word again.
[1:39:08] It's not denominationalism. It's not
[1:39:10] churchity. Right? They all fell. They
[1:39:13] all went into the darkness. But there's
[1:39:14] a bride that's going to be restored by
[1:39:16] the word again. And he's restoring the
[1:39:18] bride to the faith of the Pentecostal
[1:39:20] fathers. He said, "And the voice which I
[1:39:22] heard from heaven." So there's those
[1:39:24] people that'll hear that message. But
[1:39:26] watch the message doesn't stop with the
[1:39:28] seven church age
[1:39:29] messenger. It says, "And the voice which
[1:39:32] I heard from heaven spake unto
[1:39:34] me." Bride, the bride is represented by
[1:39:37] John here. So the voice says to the
[1:39:40] bride, "Take the go and take the little
[1:39:44] book which is in the hand of the angel
[1:39:46] which standeth upon the sea and upon the
[1:39:48] earth." Isn't that beautiful, church?
[1:39:50] He's telling you, you take the book of
[1:39:52] redemption. You take the title deed now.
[1:39:54] You take it in your hands. You got to
[1:39:57] make it a part of you. Don't just leave
[1:39:59] it with him. You go and you take it for
[1:40:01] yourself. And John says, "And I went to
[1:40:04] the angel and said unto him, give me the
[1:40:06] little book." Now, this is not him going
[1:40:08] up arrogant and saying, "Give me the
[1:40:10] book." That's not what John did. This is
[1:40:13] John going up and this is now John uh
[1:40:16] being obedient to Christ and he says,
[1:40:18] "Give me the
[1:40:19] word." That's what we want, isn't it?
[1:40:22] Give me the word. That's why we come to
[1:40:24] church. Give me the word. Not just to
[1:40:27] satisfy a Sunday tradition or a
[1:40:29] Wednesday night tradition, but we want
[1:40:30] the word.
[1:40:33] And he says
[1:40:35] this. He said, I said to him, give me
[1:40:38] the little book. And he said unto me,
[1:40:40] take it. Now what do you do with the
[1:40:42] word, church? And eat it up, and it
[1:40:47] shall make thy belly bitter, but it
[1:40:49] shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.
[1:40:51] And I took the little book out of the
[1:40:54] angel's hand and ate it up. And it was
[1:40:57] in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon
[1:41:00] as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.
[1:41:04] I had an experience like this with the
[1:41:05] cheesecake yesterday, which was
[1:41:07] wonderful until it
[1:41:11] wasn't. We've all had it. Don't pretend
[1:41:14] we haven't. I see Sister Justine
[1:41:16] giggling
[1:41:18] here. What? It tastes so good in the
[1:41:21] mouth. But when it gets down into the
[1:41:23] system, it's a little tougher, isn't it?
[1:41:27] Now, remember what I said before. We're
[1:41:28] in the time of character
[1:41:31] development. You see somebody preaching
[1:41:34] authority, you know what you want to
[1:41:35] look at first? Where's your
[1:41:37] character? Because otherwise it's
[1:41:41] satanic. Because authority, power
[1:41:43] without character is
[1:41:45] satanic. But power with character is fit
[1:41:48] to rule. We know these things. But the
[1:41:50] book speaks of authority and position
[1:41:52] because it's the book of redemption.
[1:41:53] It's restoring us back to our Eden
[1:41:55] condition. But remember when we cross
[1:41:57] over to the other side we don't change
[1:42:00] just our body changes. And so we have to
[1:42:02] have the character to rule and reign
[1:42:04] with him right here right
[1:42:07] now. Right here right
[1:42:09] now. Anybody here ready to reign and
[1:42:13] rule? Michael
[1:42:18] is. We've got to be ready to reign and
[1:42:21] rule, church, because we're not changing
[1:42:22] over there. Just the body's been
[1:42:23] changing. The soul has already been
[1:42:25] sealed. The character has already been
[1:42:29] developed. How do we respond today?
[1:42:31] That's how you'll respond then. I say,
[1:42:34] Lord, help us to have the right kind of
[1:42:35] character to judge the situation
[1:42:37] properly. That mercy and grace would
[1:42:39] flow out of us.
[1:42:41] Amen. Our will has to be lost in his
[1:42:43] will. Our thoughts have to be laid aside
[1:42:45] for his. Our desires have to be lost in
[1:42:47] his. That's the character of the bride
[1:42:49] of Christ. And that's a painful process
[1:42:51] for this flesh. That is a painful
[1:42:54] process for this flesh because you're
[1:42:57] getting rid of everything else and
[1:42:59] you're just letting the word stay in
[1:43:01] there.
[1:43:02] Amen. Sweeten the mouth. I'm becoming
[1:43:05] the word, brother John. I'm becoming the
[1:43:06] word. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Oh,
[1:43:09] it's so good. The word is so good. And
[1:43:11] then we walk out that door and we find
[1:43:12] out that it doesn't taste so good
[1:43:14] sometimes. And after you've lived a
[1:43:16] little while and you get used to the
[1:43:18] rejection and the ignorance and the
[1:43:21] persecution and the making fun, why do
[1:43:24] you dress that way? Why do you do your
[1:43:26] hair that way? Why don't you do this?
[1:43:28] Why don't you do that? Come on and do
[1:43:30] this. Oh, they're just a stick in the
[1:43:34] mud. After a while, it starts to feel a
[1:43:36] bit bitter. And if we're honest,
[1:43:38] sometimes we feel more like we're in the
[1:43:40] night of weeping than the morning of
[1:43:42] joy. But character is coming through
[1:43:45] that. Character is coming through
[1:43:48] that. We are what we eat, they say. And
[1:43:52] the bride eats the word. Why? So she can
[1:43:55] become the word. We don't vomit it up
[1:43:58] when it doesn't taste
[1:44:00] good. We just gulp it back down again
[1:44:03] and say, "Be it unto me according to
[1:44:06] your word." That's the nature of the
[1:44:08] bride. That's what communion represents.
[1:44:11] The Catholics have this so messed up.
[1:44:14] It's the literal body of God. It's the
[1:44:16] literal blood of Jesus. No, it's not.
[1:44:18] What is it? It represents the body of
[1:44:21] Christ. What is Christ? Christ is the
[1:44:22] word. When you eat the bread, you're
[1:44:24] saying, "Lord, I'll eat your word. I'll
[1:44:26] take your word. Every bit of it. I'll
[1:44:29] take every bit of your word. I won't
[1:44:30] leave anything on the plate." And then
[1:44:32] what is his blood? The blood is his
[1:44:34] life. Remember, the life is in the
[1:44:36] blood. What is the life of the blood?
[1:44:37] It's the spirit. It's the Holy Spirit.
[1:44:39] So when you take the communion, you're
[1:44:41] saying, "Lord, I'll take your word and
[1:44:43] I'll take your spirit and that'll make
[1:44:44] me a living word." That's what the
[1:44:46] communion's about. Nobody understood it.
[1:44:49] Most don't
[1:44:51] today. It represents what's happened in
[1:44:54] your life as a believer by the new
[1:44:56] birth. It's a witness to you that you
[1:44:58] passed from death unto
[1:45:00] life. He
[1:45:02] says, "I mean, you look at the
[1:45:05] disciples after they ate the word, did
[1:45:07] they have an easy life? Sure didn't.
[1:45:09] Most of them died. Unnatural lives,
[1:45:12] natural deaths. Peter was crucified
[1:45:14] upside down. Many of them were beheaded.
[1:45:16] Paul was cut in
[1:45:17] half. They ate the word and it was
[1:45:20] certainly bitter in their belly, but it
[1:45:21] held them. It held them through that
[1:45:23] time. And their character stood firm by
[1:45:25] the power of the Holy Spirit. Now, catch
[1:45:28] this last verse. He takes the book and
[1:45:30] he eats
[1:45:31] it. Tastes good in his mouth, not so
[1:45:33] good in his belly. But then the angel
[1:45:35] says to him, "Thou must prophesy again
[1:45:38] before many peoples and nations and
[1:45:40] tongues and kings." Church, you can't
[1:45:43] preach it until you've become
[1:45:45] it. Yes, we can preach forward-looking
[1:45:47] things. I do it all the time. I'm like
[1:45:49] Paul in this sense. I don't speak it as
[1:45:51] if I've attained it, but I press towards
[1:45:53] the mark. Amen. I keep pushing. But if
[1:45:56] we p try and and witness it unless we
[1:45:59] have it, we're going to produce a false
[1:46:00] religion every time. We're living by a
[1:46:03] painted fire. Amen. We're living by a
[1:46:05] painted fire. But when you become one
[1:46:07] with the new one with the word, that's
[1:46:09] what the new birth is. And that's when
[1:46:10] Christ starts to become expressed
[1:46:11] through you. And then you can testify
[1:46:13] how he's changed you. You can testify
[1:46:14] what he's done for you. You can testify
[1:46:16] how he's he's healed you in these
[1:46:18] different things, what he's done in your
[1:46:19] life. Joy stood have stayed with that
[1:46:21] church, that original church all the way
[1:46:25] through. They had the perfect word. They
[1:46:28] had the power of the spirit. They had
[1:46:30] everything they needed there, but under
[1:46:33] Paul the Apostle, they had it exactly
[1:46:34] the way it was supposed to be. That was
[1:46:36] the alpha. But the scripture says in
[1:46:39] Revelation 2 that they left their first
[1:46:42] love and they lost all the power of the
[1:46:44] word and they exchanged it for men, for
[1:46:47] men's ideas, for men's for men's
[1:46:49] programs and all these different
[1:46:51] things. The word lost its power, but a
[1:46:55] few
[1:46:55] listened, but the majority didn't, and
[1:46:58] they went off into darkness.
[1:47:00] And they went all the way down in every
[1:47:02] age. They got worse and worse and worse.
[1:47:04] And it culminated in the lowest of all
[1:47:06] which was the dark ages. And not many
[1:47:08] people were saved in the dark ages
[1:47:10] because they were completely under the
[1:47:11] thumb of false denomination. Catholic
[1:47:14] church
[1:47:15] primarily completely bound up in the
[1:47:17] things of men. But a few
[1:47:20] overcame. But from there a restoration
[1:47:22] work started. And we see this through
[1:47:24] the scriptures. And Jesus told us that
[1:47:26] Elijah would come back and he would
[1:47:28] restore us. He said to his disciples,
[1:47:30] they said, "I thought Elijah was going
[1:47:31] to come." He said, "He has come." And
[1:47:32] they did with him what they wanted. John
[1:47:33] the Baptist. He says, "But he shall come
[1:47:35] and restore all things." That's why we
[1:47:38] believe in a prophet. That's why we
[1:47:39] believe in a seven church age messenger
[1:47:41] is because Jesus said there's one that's
[1:47:43] coming to restore you back to the word.
[1:47:45] He will not speak of himself. John
[1:47:48] didn't. He won't speak of himself, but
[1:47:51] he'll point you back to Christ the word.
[1:47:53] And that'll be his vindication is that
[1:47:54] Christ is working in his ministry the
[1:47:57] same as he did then. And we see that in
[1:47:58] all the signs and wonders. But Christ is
[1:48:01] preparing a bride. And we see here in
[1:48:03] Revelation 10. He's preparing a bride by
[1:48:05] one thing and one thing alone. She takes
[1:48:07] the word. That's the only way it works.
[1:48:10] And it's going on here today. You may
[1:48:12] not realize it this morning, but you are
[1:48:14] becoming the perfect the perfect bride
[1:48:16] of
[1:48:17] Christ. And you may only take a little
[1:48:19] step forward today. You may only have a
[1:48:21] little change this morning, but it's
[1:48:22] doing a work nonetheless. Listen, when
[1:48:25] you eat food, do you see it building
[1:48:26] muscles and and and building new cells
[1:48:29] and replacing things in your body? You
[1:48:31] don't see it, but it's doing it
[1:48:33] anyways. And next thing you know, I
[1:48:35] mean, the I can't imagine what it is as
[1:48:36] a young child. I certainly can't
[1:48:38] remember. I mean, you look at at our
[1:48:40] young ones here, and you know, it seems
[1:48:42] like yesterday. I mean, look at Brother
[1:48:44] Kingsley's little son, Kachi. I mean, I
[1:48:46] saw him within a few days of him being
[1:48:48] born. He was this big. Now he's this
[1:48:50] big. He has no idea he's
[1:48:53] changing, but he's getting new
[1:48:55] capabilities and he's getting new
[1:48:57] understanding and he's getting new
[1:48:58] awareness of what's going on around him.
[1:49:00] And that's what's happening by the
[1:49:02] word. I so appreciate talking with my
[1:49:05] wife so many times because it's so easy
[1:49:07] to see things happening in somebody
[1:49:09] else.
[1:49:10] and she'll share things with me about
[1:49:13] the things that she's been hearing and
[1:49:14] things she's been reading and things
[1:49:16] that have been preached over this
[1:49:17] pulpit. And it just makes me rejoice in
[1:49:19] my heart because I see the word is doing
[1:49:21] something in
[1:49:22] her. But it's so easy to see it
[1:49:24] happening in our young sisters and our
[1:49:26] young brothers. But we got to be able to
[1:49:28] say, "Lord, it's happening in me even if
[1:49:30] I don't realize it because I keep eating
[1:49:31] your word. And when it tastes not so
[1:49:33] great in my belly, I still keep it down
[1:49:35] because I believe it's for me." That's
[1:49:38] what's preparing a bride. And whether
[1:49:40] you feel like you're bitter this morning
[1:49:42] or whether you're you're in the in the
[1:49:43] moment of joy, it matters not. If you're
[1:49:46] eating the word, it's going to have an
[1:49:47] effect in your life. Why? That more that
[1:49:50] night of morning always turns to
[1:49:53] joy. It always turns to joy. There's a
[1:49:57] morning coming, church, when the last
[1:49:59] trumpet of God shall
[1:50:00] sound. And all of time will be no more
[1:50:03] for us. It'll be the end of it for us.
[1:50:05] Amen. and we get to go be with him. And
[1:50:07] all those years of bitterness, all those
[1:50:09] years of pain, all those years of
[1:50:10] disappointment, all those years of
[1:50:12] suffering, all those years of
[1:50:13] persecution, in a moment, in a twinkling
[1:50:15] of an eye, they will fall
[1:50:18] away and you'll start
[1:50:21] going. You'll start to realize, "I made
[1:50:24] it." There's events that happen on that
[1:50:27] resurrection morning that are going to
[1:50:29] change us in a way that we've never been
[1:50:30] changed before. Because Satan's been
[1:50:32] working on the feeling of all of these
[1:50:34] things that we go through life. We got a
[1:50:36] lot of feelings this morning. But that's
[1:50:39] not going to stop the word. It's going
[1:50:41] to keep working whether we feel it or
[1:50:43] not. Listen, I don't like broccoli, but
[1:50:45] whether I like it or not doesn't change
[1:50:46] the fact if I eat broccoli, it does a
[1:50:48] wonderful thing in me. I'm told. I'm
[1:50:51] told. And the only reason I would eat
[1:50:54] broccoli is because I believe it's good
[1:50:55] for me, not because it tastes good.
[1:51:00] The word's doing a
[1:51:03] work, but we see through it all. The
[1:51:05] pride
[1:51:06] prevails. Why? Because she's got the
[1:51:08] prevailing spirit of Christ within her.
[1:51:10] It's not you. It's not me. It's Christ
[1:51:12] within me that makes us more than
[1:51:14] conquerors. Paul would talk about in
[1:51:16] Romans 8. He says, "But if the same
[1:51:19] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:51:22] the dead dwell in you, he that raised up
[1:51:24] Christ from the dead shall also
[1:51:26] quicken." In other words, in the same
[1:51:28] way, quicken your mortal bodies by his
[1:51:31] spirit that dwelleth in you. There's the
[1:51:33] quickening power that gets us through,
[1:51:35] church. And it culminates in a
[1:51:37] resurrection and a rapture. But notice
[1:51:39] it says it quickens your mortal bodies
[1:51:41] by his spirit. Do you have his spirit
[1:51:44] now? Four of
[1:51:46] us. Do you have his spirit now? Then
[1:51:50] it's quickening your body as you speak,
[1:51:52] as you listen, as you sit here this
[1:51:54] morning. And what is it doing? It's
[1:51:56] taking the word and making it live
[1:51:58] through you. And it finishes in the word
[1:52:01] that says in a moment, in the twinkling
[1:52:03] of an eye, we should all be changed. But
[1:52:05] there's a changing before the changing.
[1:52:07] And that's that character development
[1:52:09] we've been talking about. It's that
[1:52:10] submission to the word. It's Christ
[1:52:12] becoming a reality in you. The power is
[1:52:14] already there. It's just bringing the
[1:52:16] character before it takes us into
[1:52:17] authority.
[1:52:19] He says, "For ye have not received the
[1:52:21] spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye
[1:52:23] have received the spirit of adoption
[1:52:25] whereby we cry aba father." The spirit
[1:52:28] of God takes us and it draws us back to
[1:52:30] God, makes us call on God, draws us into
[1:52:33] relationship with God, draws us into
[1:52:35] fellowship with God. So we don't have to
[1:52:37] go through a man. You don't have to go
[1:52:38] through brother John this morning. You
[1:52:40] don't have to go through mom and dad.
[1:52:41] But the inddwelling Christ inside of you
[1:52:43] is available every day abiding with you.
[1:52:47] And what does it do? It's drawing you
[1:52:49] back to your original condition, to your
[1:52:51] original relationship. And he says, "The
[1:52:54] spirit itself beareth witness with our
[1:52:56] spirit that we are the children of God.
[1:52:59] And if we are children, then heirs,
[1:53:01] heirs of God and joint hes with Christ.
[1:53:03] If so be that we suffer, if so be that
[1:53:07] we have our night of weeping." He says,
[1:53:09] "With him, that we may also be glorified
[1:53:11] together that we might have our joy in
[1:53:14] the morning." He says, "For I reckon
[1:53:16] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:53:19] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:53:21] glory that shall be revealed in us."
[1:53:23] Remember we said yesterday that Jesus
[1:53:25] despised the
[1:53:26] shame. He said, "What I'm going through
[1:53:28] and what I will go through is nothing
[1:53:31] compared to what's waiting at the end."
[1:53:33] We have to have the same the same idea,
[1:53:36] the same mindset. This is nothing
[1:53:38] compared to what waits on the other end.
[1:53:41] We'll have a body like unto his glorious
[1:53:42] body. will sit with him in his
[1:53:46] throne. He says, "Nay, in all these
[1:53:49] things we are more than conquerors. We
[1:53:53] overwhelmingly prevail is what that
[1:53:55] means." In other words, it's not a close
[1:53:59] affair. It's not a barely made it
[1:54:02] thing. It is a total annihilation of
[1:54:06] your
[1:54:08] enemy. He says, "In all these things, we
[1:54:10] are more than conquerors through him
[1:54:12] that loved us. For I am
[1:54:14] persuaded. Christ was persuaded, church.
[1:54:17] Abraham was persuaded. Samuel was
[1:54:19] persuaded. David was persuaded. Are you
[1:54:21] persuaded this morning? I am persuaded
[1:54:24] that neither death nor
[1:54:27] life, life's the part that's
[1:54:31] hardest. He says, "Nor angels, nor
[1:54:34] principalities, nor powers, nor things
[1:54:36] present, nor things to come." Does it
[1:54:39] matter who wins the election, church?
[1:54:42] Nope. Does it matter who's in power? No.
[1:54:46] Does it matter what rights they take
[1:54:47] away? Does it matter what things they
[1:54:50] try to impose on us? Not according to
[1:54:53] Paul. And Paul spoke by the spirit. He
[1:54:56] says, "Nor height, nor depth, nor any
[1:54:59] other creature shall be able to separate
[1:55:02] us from the love of God which is in
[1:55:05] Christ Jesus our Lord." Amen. God bless
[1:55:07] you. Let's stand this morning.
[1:55:10] There's a resurrection morning coming
[1:55:12] sometime in that first watch between
[1:55:15] 6:00 and 9:00 a.m. You say, "Brother
[1:55:16] John, the scripture says no man knows
[1:55:17] the day nor the hour." I'm giving a
[1:55:19] range of hours because why? The first
[1:55:21] one was in the first watch. The second
[1:55:22] one will be the same way. But there's
[1:55:24] going to come a knock that morning. And
[1:55:26] I've always said I look forward to that
[1:55:28] knock because I believe for me, who
[1:55:30] knows? I don't know who's going to go by
[1:55:31] way of the grave. But if it were to
[1:55:33] happen tomorrow morning, I believe it'd
[1:55:34] be Sister Coffee waiting for me.
[1:55:38] I believe be maybe she'd have a
[1:55:40] bumbleberry pie that she brought from
[1:55:42] the from the heavenlies. I don't know.
[1:55:45] But I know what she looked like in her
[1:55:47] youth, so I'll recognize her. But she'll
[1:55:49] be shimmering in eternal health and
[1:55:51] beauty. And she'll say, "Brother John,
[1:55:54] it's time to go. It's time to get ready,
[1:55:57] not time to go." Maybe it'll be Aunt
[1:56:00] Satie Dicks. And Aunt Sadi is not one I
[1:56:02] would ever recognize because I only knew
[1:56:04] her in her old age. You know what Aunt
[1:56:06] Satie Dixs would have to say to me for
[1:56:07] me to recognize her? She'd have to say
[1:56:09] some
[1:56:10] sweet. Because we go visit her in the
[1:56:13] old folks home and mom would make us go
[1:56:15] and give her a hug before we left. And
[1:56:17] when we did, she was always she'd always
[1:56:19] peck us on the cheek and she'd say,
[1:56:20] "Some sweet. I don't know what an Sadie
[1:56:23] is going to look like, but I'll tell you
[1:56:24] this. She's going to be a beautiful
[1:56:26] woman in the prime of health and youth."
[1:56:30] And you know what's going to happen?
[1:56:32] I I'm not a part of your family, Brother
[1:56:34] Bob, but Nan is mine. On that
[1:56:36] resurrection morning, Nan is mine. And
[1:56:38] she's going to come in. She's going to
[1:56:39] say, "Brother John, get
[1:56:42] ready. Get ready." And for 30 to 40
[1:56:45] days, we're going to have fellowship.
[1:56:47] You talk about joy in the
[1:56:49] morning. When you see the resurrected
[1:56:52] saints, many of us have lost people. And
[1:56:56] you see
[1:56:58] them, that's when your faith becomes
[1:57:00] sight. That's when any mourning you had
[1:57:03] turns to joy and you say, "I'm going."
[1:57:06] Because only the redeemed are going to
[1:57:08] see the redeemed and we're going to
[1:57:10] spend 30 to 40 days together. I don't
[1:57:12] know how that's going to look. I don't
[1:57:14] know if we'll have
[1:57:16] church. I don't know if we'll just sit
[1:57:18] around and eat bumbleberry
[1:57:20] pie because it doesn't matter if we gain
[1:57:23] weight because we're going in a
[1:57:24] glorified body in 30 to 40
[1:57:27] days. But you talk about joy in the
[1:57:29] morning, church. We're going to have a
[1:57:31] shouting moment. Listen, Biscuit woke us
[1:57:33] up this morning chasing a moose outside.
[1:57:36] There's a moose outside our
[1:57:38] door. Biscuit's not going to wake me up
[1:57:40] that morning, church. It's going to be a
[1:57:42] knock on the door and says, "It's
[1:57:44] resurrection time, son. It's
[1:57:45] resurrection time,
[1:57:48] daughter." I think we'll have a shouting
[1:57:52] jubilee. Some of us may even speak in
[1:57:57] tongues. You looking forward to it? I'm
[1:58:00] looking forward to seeing Nan. I'm
[1:58:02] looking forward to seeing N Sadi.
[1:58:03] Brother Gerald, are you looking forward
[1:58:05] to seeing Brother Barnes and Sister
[1:58:06] Barnes? Amen. It'll be a wonderful,
[1:58:08] wonderful thing when our faith becomes
[1:58:11] sight. Isn't he good to us? Are you
[1:58:14] looking forward to it? You know, we
[1:58:17] ought to wake up every morning and until
[1:58:19] that clock hits 9:00, say, "This could
[1:58:21] be the morning." Hang around the front
[1:58:23] door a while. Say, "Lord, maybe this is
[1:58:26] the day." Start your day with the idea
[1:58:28] this could be the day we go home. This
[1:58:31] is the day the process starts. That last
[1:58:32] 30 to 40 day countdown to where we're
[1:58:34] going to get out of here and we'll get
[1:58:36] to be in his presence forever more.
[1:58:38] Amen. God bless you. Let's bow our
[1:58:40] heads, Lord Jesus. Lord, what a
[1:58:43] wonderful joy that comes to our hearts,
[1:58:45] Lord. when we look at your word, when we
[1:58:47] look at your promises, Lord, and we know
[1:58:49] that these trials of life and these
[1:58:52] difficulties, Lord, these sicknesses,
[1:58:54] these hardships, these heartaches, Lord,
[1:58:56] these offenses, this persecution, this
[1:58:59] ignorance we deal with, the suffering,
[1:59:02] Lord, it's all going to vanish one day,
[1:59:04] Lord. And you're going to wipe every
[1:59:05] tear from our eyes. And we'll have no
[1:59:07] more memory of these things which are
[1:59:09] passed, Lord, but we'll be in perfect
[1:59:11] joy, peace, and love, Lord. how our
[1:59:14] hearts long for it this morning, Lord.
[1:59:16] And we get a taste, I believe, when
[1:59:17] we're in your presence. And Lord, with
[1:59:19] saints of like precious faith, but Lord,
[1:59:22] our hearts cry out for that bula land
[1:59:24] this morning, Lord. There's nothing here
[1:59:26] to keep us. And if there is anything
[1:59:27] that will keep us, Lord, I pray you help
[1:59:29] us to cut those strings this morning.
[1:59:31] Lord, that we see that there's nothing
[1:59:33] worth it in this world except
[1:59:36] you. Lord, bless this people, Lord. Lift
[1:59:39] us up. Encourage us day by day. Lord, we
[1:59:41] see these bodies failing. We see this
[1:59:43] world crumbling around us, Lord. We see
[1:59:45] the God of this evil age, Lord, rising
[1:59:48] in power, Lord. But there's a bride
[1:59:50] that's going to overcome through it all
[1:59:52] by the power of the word and her by the
[1:59:54] spirit, Lord. Help us to wake up every
[1:59:56] morning, Lord, with joy in our hearts,
[1:59:59] Lord. That you've made us more than
[2:00:01] conquerors, Lord. That we are overcomers
[2:00:03] by your word. Lord, you've given us an
[2:00:06] unconditional covenant that you'll take
[2:00:09] us through. Lord, bless us now. We pray
[2:00:12] in Jesus Christ's name we ask it.
[2:00:23] Amen. How great thou art.
[2:00:31] 246. Oh Lord my God.
[2:00:38] And I in
[2:00:40] awome
[2:00:43] wonder
[2:00:45] consider
[2:00:47] all the worlds thy hands have
[2:00:55] made. I see the
[2:01:00] stars. I hear the
[2:01:04] roaring thunder.
[2:01:08] Thy power
[2:01:12] throughout the
