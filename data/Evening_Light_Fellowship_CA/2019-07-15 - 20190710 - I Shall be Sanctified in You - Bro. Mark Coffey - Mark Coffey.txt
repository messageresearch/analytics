just turn in our scripture first of all we love our scripture reading in Isaiah 53 from in your scripture and we'll read verses 1 to 12 just welcome everybody here tonight and just thankful for this time we can get together and just just run over these things in the word refresh our memories and we just forget so much you know that it's just always good to just go back and refresh update it's good see sister Leah I guess Chad is away ok Isaiah 53 verse 1 who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall grow up before him as a tender plant and as a root out of a dry ground he has no form nor comeliness and when we shall see him there is no beauty that we should desire him he is despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief and we hid it as it were our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity the chest meant of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we were healed and we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all amen he has oppressed and he he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her Shearer's is dumb so it so he opened not his mouth he was taken from prison and from judgment who shall declare his generation for he was cut off out of the land of the living for the transgression of my people was he stricken and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done so had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth it had pleased the Lord to bruise him he has put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and a pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities therefore will I divide him a portion with the great and he shall divide the spoil with the strong because he has poured out his soul unto death and he was numbered with the transgressors transgressors and he bare the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors amen we call the musicians back and sing and go home after reading that Amen he may be seated Mandalore dad's blessing to the reading of his word tonight so just just a couple of things - I did hear from brother Colombo today he called and as the Sunday school group had taken their money that they collected and they into I gave it as a donation to brother Colombo for his mission and he called today just say thanks for that's what I the first part of it was collected and rolled and and all that hasn't been done but the first part was just just two hundred dollars so that was good and brother Colombo certainly appreciated that and he travels tomorrow to the Congo I think for two and a half weeks so we want to he has to be remembered in prayer and he asked me to mention that to the church that he was very thankful for that donation going towards the cause in Congo that he's going on in the next little while and of course it's been a it's been something he's done for a while amen warm up here so anyway so just a couple of things here I just want to talk about undie song service was like right in line with this which is good you know it just makes your heart go bubble bubble bubble you know to quote you know brother brother Ron uh-huh and so that we you know where you going along and so it's just a little exhortation and I just want to talk about the Blood and the Holy Ghost and those things and just put it together back in the basics so that we can you know just refresh ourselves because many times you know we just go and everything gets jumbled up you know how life is it's just a jumble and the devil is good at that that distracting us and where we're hearing so many ideas coming in all the time and and different things but really right through the whole Bible there's a there's a path there you know just like pilgrim and he had to find this and there was a lot on the side and a lot on you know to set him astray or divert them or to deceive him so we just try to keep you know every now and then just try to you know we can kind of see the light at the end of the tunnel ins is good in our lives because it's just so busy and those things so so you know our life you know we started you know in the flesh and it was very contrary contrary to the Spirit of God we were born that way you know we had no choice you know and there was our mind with a mind that was an enmity with God there was just nothing in common with garden-party just that it can never that the mind the carnal mind can never agree with God's Word it will never be subject to that and a chance to come to God is is 0% for us to come to God if you're here today and you're serving God you know that is by grace we know that that's grace that brought you and it's God rich in mercy that will bring you to the the point where you will recognize God and surrender your life to God other than that at 0% you can't do it I know for a fact it wouldn't have happened I mean you could be raised up in a church you know your whole life or whatever in the message church but unless God comes you know it's it's the only way that you're gonna receive that grace is for God to come and and find you if you go looking for God that's denomination right that's just your own your own your own mind putting things together and go on and looking for God and that's what turns into it's just a man's religion so was God rich and mercy and it was grace that saved you so just um I just wanted to it's kind of different but I just wanted to play something by brother Lonnie it's it's an old thing I saw just a little while ago and it's only a little four or five minutes but I think it's it's kind of a good introduction into into this this what we're gonna just go through today and it's just a little Bible teaching and he talks about this picture right here in something grass what wasn't dumbing down where this picture was taken and he talks about he talks about this behind him here so I rather me going through it I think it's just basically just watch that little Clint but I don't know if people know very much about you know this this picture and just one of the things that he had explained to Sidney Jackson who or Loni calls a prom I believe he was and he he he he was talking about around a brother brems explained in this picture to him and explained in this part and of course brother Lonnie was in Tucson and Sidney Jackson was there for a good while and this is what Sidney Jackson brother Sidney Jackson had told brother Lonnie about about that I thought it was very good so I don't know if people are familiar we can just pass that around but if a brother brother Matthew can just play that for us Romans 8 I quickly ran off a slide in the back room while ago and I don't think it's going to project it's a slide of this picture which was the seven licks of fire the supernatural picture taken in Grass Valley California and I don't think it's going to project what I want projected so I did a little ink addition on it right there and if you ever get this picture in your hand again you can look for that little picture there because it didn't show up on this transparency but I've told you before but I've never shown you the picture I was talking with builder Sydney Jackson one day prophet from South Africa that was a close friend of brother banners and he's brother he said brother Branham took this picture and he says brother Sydney he says look close behind me on the platform holding up this this picture and he says look closely behind me he says do you see that face that looks like an old Indian chief or something and brother Jackson says yes I see that said I've never noticed that there before he says that's my old nature he said it's always there to haunt you he says when he says when you receive Christ and his word now I'm going to do my hands the way Sydney did because it's very significant and he said that's the way brother Brennan did he says when you stand and receive the word for the hour the revelation of the hour he says that Holy Ghost fire comes down into your soul and he says burns out the old nature he didn't say a word but you got a picture it loses the position of Dominion but it moves to a place of influence it cannot make you do anything but it'll talk to you as if it's in the same place that it always was but it has no power and he says that he says my old nature looks like an Indian chief because he says cause my mother was half Indian now if that happened to a prophet that's what happens to every child of God the old nature is burned out of you and your new nature is God but the old nature is always there to haunt you it'll try to condemn you over the things that it did in your body are you following me so consequently that's why God says you are a new creature why because the control tower inside is brand new absolutely new and didn't do a thing against God and that's why you can stand justified before God as if you never did it because you the real you the predestinated soul from God you did not do it it was that in nature that did it and were you perfectly you from the beginning you wouldn't have done it so therefore the blood of Jesus Christ washes away all of the old past it's gone you're not held accountable anymore that's why the Prophet says we answer to God for the spirit that we allowed to use our body I could go through a list a mile long of things that are all flesh and yet we still allow it to manifest in our life and think we're okay doing it you're giving over to the wrong thing because the flesh is tied with that old nature Noah bromans eight now I don't know if anyone's heard that before if it would ever came up but I thought it was interesting and I'll probably just transcribe it not send it out to everyone so you'll have just a copy of it you know what he said there you know because it's it it's good to know there how are these sometimes mechanics work you know and why you had that influence so that's kind of what I was gonna just hug go into a bit here just explain a little bit of that I'll never do it like what I think ins you know God versus home we should just play that that would have work force so I just I just wanted to speak just a little bit here and it just won't be too long you get going here but and it's just talked about that and go into a little bit more Medici about what he just talked about then just knowing you know what that influence how that influences on your life and that only chair that old man and his brother branham and just places him there right behind you know any and it gets picked up in the picture and we all know that that old man just stands for it stands there all the time torment you know and that's how the devil work works through him but he's and it's important to two words he'd be he is an influencer and and he doesn't have dominion or domination over anyone anymore who is born again by the Holy Spirit but it'll be there until the did thank you it'll be there until day you die you know you will if you wear a rapture it'll be there that that day before you know when it happens or if you go you know the way it a grave you'll be in your deathbed and you'll be still dealing with those with that thing because that remains there forever because you're in the flesh and that's why you need the blood still that's why you need an intercessor and and the intercessor is still interceding for you the son of God is still you know the the the the priest the high priest there is still on that mercy seat and the blood is still there for the bride in this hour so the Holy Ghost comes upon our lives and and we have an experience so so when we look at it we look at the ourselves here the this poor soul here in the middle who's trying to get to the end and we we see that there's the Holy Ghost and there's also the blood here I need and you it kind of ask yourself which keeps you is that the Holy Ghost that keeps you it's a blood how does this work in between and they're so they just I put up that slide they're very Mathew doing I just showed us a quote which is just me so here in the indictment message bar I'm says that's the reason we don't see things happening in the churches they confess that they believe the blood but they reject the very plan to get to the blood which is the word so the way to have the blood working for you is through the word for your day that's how you have access to the blood and not everyone has access to the blood so we know that you know that you know what I mentioned before about Calvary and Calvary you know we can we can never forget Calvary because that was that's where the the blood atonement was made so all through the Old Testament you know they used the blood of bulls and go once a year to cover sin but it never took away it just covered the sin but there was going to come a savior as we read in Isaiah 53 that would that would you know complete or do away with the the same question forever by the shedding of the blood on Calvary so you know when you look at John 3:16 for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son it's talking about that on Calvary and whosoever believes in him shall be saved and that is true because at on Calvary I'm just going off already so on Calvary here you know the the price was paid here for everybody it was for the whole world so as we read down here through Isaiah 53 it says it says in verse 4 shortly he had borne our griefs and carried our sorrows so you know he didn't have a hidden have those sorrows but he had the sorrows of the world that were on that cross that he died for that day and he completed it for anyone who comes with a depression or a sorrow he he he healed him of that right and he was he was stricken he was smitten of God he was afflicted and surely has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows right there on the cross he's done this prophecy is talking about Jesus on the cross and he did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted all of that he was wounded for our transgressions in verse 5 he was bruised for our iniquity so all our mistakes all the ones that were done in the Old Testament all the ones that were done in the New Testament all the ones that were being done then it was all it was all you know resolved right there there was there was there was no more sin right then at that point in time there was no more sin it was all and still today there's no more sin in the sight of God but in order for you mahat the effect of that you had to accept it so you see that he died for all the world but all the world is not going to accept it but if you wanted and God leads you to it then he will he will heal you of all your disease so if you're sick if you're sick then you brother Brian says even if if Christ was right here he couldn't heal me because he did it all at Calvary and you have to claim it right so I think I have a I got a couple of quotes on that so he says here in a way of a true prophet in the bowl if I was our Lord Jesus Christ standing here and this woman was sick you know I could not heal her if I was the Lord Jesus I couldn't do it because I've already done it he did it at Calvary has already forgive your sin he's forgiven every sin every sin that you will do every sin that you did he is he is forgiven you he's he's already healed every sick person he's already appropriated that blood at the Calvary the price is already paid it's already paid the only thing you have to do is accept it believe it and accept it and you cannot accept it until you first until first you believe it so that's how that's how John 3:16 works because people say well Jesus died for us all he did die for you he he died for every sin that you committed an area you will commit but you have to accept it and they don't accept it they turn away and they turn away from the word that would lead them to the blood that would that would now they could claim through the blood that was shed on Calvary that day it was the greatest day ever but he still had to be resurrected or it was no good because that life would not come back on the thing so so it was justification it was the blood was shed for everyone and God can't do anything for you now that he's already done program says it many times right we heard him say that many times just see what he says here he says Lord Jesus I accept your atonement I'm a sinner you were saved back there you were healed back there you just accept it by faith you saved by faith you accept your salvation and anybody comes around tells you that that they got healed they got healing power and they can heal you you stay plumb clear of that because it's now healing power is in Christ already a finished work if a man tells you God has give him power to forgive your sins and do that don't you believe it right Catherine says that they're already forgiven Jesus standing here tonight the only thing it would declare that he was the son of God what if he was what if now my hands was full of nail scars and blood running out of them and thorns a cross hair they were they still won't make it Jesus they would be my flesh and he knows that flesh is sitting on the right hand of God and when it comes time will be no more that's right when Jesus descends that's all of it but he's here in the spirit form and then his life is in you and I to give your faith and to give me faith so the we know the body is there at the right hand of God and it's the the the blood is there to atone for our sins and the Holy Spirit because he resurrected the Holy Spirit then comes back on the believer to so that he can dwell in that life and that blood cleanses away because God in all the Old Testament he couldn't he couldn't come into a believer so David Abraham all of them God could anoint them but they he could never dwell in them because it has to be a sanctified it has to be a sanctified place for God to dwell so so so the blood of goats and and lambs and things like that could not did not have the power to sanctify a place for God to spirit to dwell but at Eden Calvary on Calvary he made a way they made that way which we we see here in in Isaiah 53 which is amazingly so so accurate that Isaiah he must have fully saw what was happening there because it was all complete right there it was it was it was a salvation for man kind it was right back in in the beginning and if we turn over to let's just turn over to Ezekiel Ezekiel 36 and all through the Old Testament it's prophesied in in there and in Isaiah 42 and in Psalms and right here in Isaiah 36 and it talks about what God was gonna do because he just realized with Israel he realized that I mean of course he knew it all the time but they could never complete he never do what he wants them to do so basically he said in his prophecy that I'm going to come in to you and I'm not gonna try to adapt this problem or fix it you know I am just gonna come in to you and I'm gonna do it so as I kiyul 36 verse 16 moreover the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land they defile it by their own way and by their doings their way was before me as the uncleanliness of a removed woman wherefore that means because of this because of this i poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it and i scattered them among the heathen and they were dispersed through the countries we know that Israel was scattered through the through the different lands in amongst the heathen and according in their way and according to their doings I judged them and when they entered unto the heathen whether they went they profaned my holy name so you notice there he didn't say they profane me they were they profane God he always will use the term they profane mine they profaned my holy name right that's what he's protecting there is is that that name because we know where we know with with the Jews they always said like you know what is your name you don't need to give him a name he said Moses you know Moses said to the people there you know it said to God why don't I tell the people who you were and he said you know I am the I am and he was satisfied with that but it was always like like Paul in in when he was struck by by that light and and Jesus came and he said who are you know what is your name you know what is your name and that's what they look for right because they they they always and they wouldn't even say the name right they always used to use consonants when they didn't write that name they didn't want to say it because of it was so holy right and we know and then we know and when the angel Gabriel came to Mary he said now call his name Jesus right because it had to be that name it is really important about the name of God and you would think so he said just when they profane my Holy Name when they said to them these are the people of the Lord and are gone forth out of his land now here in verse 21 but I had pity for mine Holy Name which the house of Israel has profaned among the heathen whether they went therefore say unto the house of Israel thus saith the Lord God I do this for your sakes or house of Israel but for mine holy namesake which ye have profaned among the heathen whether you went because they were supposed to represent God his name right and God did never did one he never did want idols or statues or a four-foot statue of some animal to represent his name or his image right he wanted a living living representation of his name and that living was going to be his people so he wanted that's why you never see images in you know like in the in in Jewish Christian play you know you don't see images because God has to live in living things his his family right there was the plan and I will sanctify my great verse 23 and I will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the heathens which he have profaned in the midst of them and the heathen shall know that i am the lord i am the lord saith the lord god when i shall be sanctified in you before their eyes so so in verse 23 and i will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the heathens which he have profaned in the midst of them and the heathen shall know that i am the lord saith the lord god when i shall be sanctified in you before their eyes so he says i will be sanctified in you so i will sanctify that place and then i will dwell in you this is the prophecy that was to come under which was fulfilled at the day of pentecost rain so Christ died and resurrected fifty days later we seated to see the day of Pentecost and that was the 50-day Jubilee where they were released right and they received what / - is is the abstract title deed so they then possessed what Adam lost back in the garden even they got the title for that do in an earnest right but the abstract says it was it was it was cleared right back to God right so now they received that on that day and received that in in hearings but also there was a place sanctified in these people because the blood was shed at Calvary and and the Holy Ghost came down in that hour and dwelt in those people and that was the start of the New Testament the New Covenant where God would come down and fulfill this he says I'm going to come down and live inside of you and do it for you because you couldn't do it and that is wonderful here's how it's going to and here's how he was going to do it verse 24 for I will take you from among the heathen and gather you out of all the countries and will bring you into your own land this is familiar then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean from all your filthiness and from all your idols for like lend you a new heart also will I give you a new spirit or like put within you and I will take away the stony heart of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statue and ye shall keep my judgments and do them and what was what was promised there came to pass in the upper room experience and on that first day it was the first day the first church we we see received back into their possession a title deed to eternal life that Adam had held Amen so so all through the Old Testament it was a revealing of God through the different people so that you know they could you know see God revealed and understand and understand who God was because God was so complex and it took all this time and all this time and all these experiences that he he would do it and and and many times there would be a prophecy it's like you know Abraham you know you know what the prophecy of Moses down in that land you know and you know the one was a prophecy but then he would come down into a person and he would he would fulfill that prophecy and he would do that for his name you don't the name was so important so that people could could see the name of God it was a manifestation Terp rotational that word was those people doing what what the prophecy was to fulfill so in in what I was getting to here just back to that so it with the Holy Ghost saying what the what the Holy Ghost is for and what the blood is for and we know that it's a grace that saved us through faith Ephesians chapter two and this is what was what was being fulfilled in each one of us on that day on that fateful day in in the day of Pentecost so the Holy Ghost is really what it what it does such as some of the things that it does I'll just list them here is it it's really what came and tracked you down because like we said you could never you'll just you'll never it never you'll never find your way you know there's no way you can find it because your mind is enmity with God you cannot you're you're dead in trespasses and sins but unless you know the Holy Spirit it comes and he's the one that bring the Holy Spirit is the one that brings that seed that's in you seed to life in you right because we know that lays dormant in you and that's the one that will it it'll empower it'll empower you and it will undo you with power as that's what happened in the in the upper room so it will give you right standing with God I just kind of wrote them in there so there could be more here it gives you a right right right how's the right standing with God and as we know it's a comforter right and it's a guide so it does guide you and you understand that right you live in that right now you understand that it will guide you you know your safety what do I go why do I go here what I got there you know why didn't I do this why did I do this you know it's a it's a it's a guide for you and it direction and if you know it's it's it's what's gonna guide you into maturity you know in the end as a son of God and as as a maturity and also in a state of rapture for us because that's that's what you know will that's that's a word that will be interpreted in us right it won't be it won't be God over here it's gonna be God in us who'll interpret the word just like all the instances would you see in the Bible right because we had to come to that so it directs you it guides you it's a comforter to show you these things and again it it keeps it tries to keep you from from sin sinning and because as you know it warns you how many have been warned you know how many have been warned by the Holy Spirit right do not look at that you know do not go in there you know don't don't listen to that and we all got experiences to them and you know as you go and grace you know there's there's more there's you know there's more and also also in entitles you you know so so those are the those are the things but over here with the blood with the blood that's that the the price that was paid at Calvary in the blood that was shed what does that do for us right well that that's what keeps you so before so here if you you can relate to this so we can all relate to it I can relate to it this week and you know you're here and in that flesh and that's all nature you know is what the challenges in your life right and that that's a sin nature that's a sin nature that you have and I said you didn't lose this in nature but it it's still there with you because you're in the flesh because the the spirit and the in the body are of the beast nature and you had that beast nature and so you'll always have that you'll hall always had that but you have to keep it pressed down and in subject and that's just because it has a sin nature the sin nature that you were born with you're born in iniquity shaped in iniquity born in sin so you have to keep that in subjection all your life so you you you you have to to do that so when when something happens that she did wrong and you shouldn't have done it better Lonnie said you know there was a hundred things that he could list in the flesh then brother Branham says that that dog of you know that dove will fly off over here right until you settle down and you feel it you feel that anointing you know you see it you feel cold right you feel like you know like you'll feel like that and you know it doesn't you make a mistake right you make a mistake and that happens and that Holy Ghost that that dove there will take its flight from you right and then you'll go through a trial you had to learn it's all a learning experience right but so you feel like gee you know I made a mistake you know I'm not I haven't got the Holy Ghost right and that's not true that's not true you know like yeah the devil is saying to you you never got the Holy Ghost you know that the Holy Ghost you didn't get the Holy Ghost God you know he's gone he's not gonna and you know you feel like that because the but we just read you know you're covered from every sin you know on Calvary everything is paid everything is done and you've accepted it right you've accepted what Christ did on there and the blood cleansed every bit of it and the devil is reminding you of these things it might be something that you you did years and years ago right and you're feeling now guilty does and the influencer is bringing it up in your mind and your now you're thinking about it again and and you say hey you know you're you feel so sorry I did it and and God is up there scratching his head because he doesn't know what he's talking about because he has put it in the sea of forgetfulness and he could forget so he doesn't know what you're talking about you're just going babbling on as far as he's concerned because he doesn't see you right Bertram says he only hears you right so he he has said that's behind right this has nothing to do with us anymore here we're moving on there but say that influencer will torment you so what what really keeps you is the blood the blood keeps you even when you feel like this you know and the Holy Spirit is doing all these things for you because the Holy Spirit comes back you know and you feel that again you know Bourbons fending off he lost the holy holy spirit for six months I can't remember now what it was I can't remember but he said you know I never felt the anointing for six months you know at all I told bond he came back and he says so it keeps you it sanctifies you it speaks for you because we know that from from Abel he came down and he said the blood is speaking Abel's blood was speaking Cain you know so if I make a mistake a mistake I'm covered right now when I talk my unbelief you know we're talking with some things on the flesh my belief is in the soul like you know sin and sinning as to his sin is unbelief right so so you know just my own experience I mean from the very dot you know when I came in contact with it with the with the word and you know it was true that added and stuff like that I mean the Holy Spirit was there with me that's a time right and from that point on I never doubted his message once you know so I can't you know by the grace of God I cannot deny it I cannot denies the truth I know brother Brennan was a word prophet because when he spoke something in my soul said that's right it was just rebounded right there it just clenched in there at the head the one not so you know when we have a week we have weak spots here everybody knows that we're still in the flesh it comes might come from your you something you had or your grap your father your grandfather or way back whatever it's all you know it's all part of your ancestry or what whatever it is and it could be you know money I'm saying now popularity this is the ones program talk about popularity women these are for preachers here and it could be it with church you know you have problems you have trouble with clothes maybe I'm just doing the list of a hundred here now entertainment leisure you know what what you could fall you're stuck to some music or something you know could be something family life you know it's a weak the weakness their friends you know you're still kind of frequenting that it could be work it to caught up with that you know it's just these things in life with which we can you you know like that you might not have subject to some people have no problem with this but they might have problem with that you know internet that don't forget internet or something you know all these things devices you know things that would distract your things that would you know you know bring you away from God bring you know just move you away you know that some things you have to do is required you know but you know there's grace for all of that but you know you could be going too far with things those are the week's top week things that the blood the blood covers right you know you could be could be slack and stuff you could be slack with your church-going you know you say well I won't go tonight or whatever your prayer your your fellowship you know your Bible reading all of these things you know all of these things that you had to deal with but the the blood keeps you it doesn't matter what the blog key so once you turn and you repent you know it's just like David you know and we do it the Sheba and and Uriah you know when he you know when he went to repent God forgave them punish them right and you'll feel punishment but he's only just getting you into a place where you need to go and if you go off to the side well he'll bring it he'll bring you around them so it's grace its grace that brought me and grace Ted so here so here so the devil the devil is here in all of these things to distract you so when you make a mistake you know the debt the Holy Spirit will will move away from you but that blood never moves away from you that blood is there it'll cover you as long as you're into the in the flesh you know and you accept that sacrifice at Calvary and you will always have that atonement that'll keep you so that's what you look to right you know you look to that so that sacrifice that was made on that day that brought me and and it's wonderful and God sees sees you through the blood of Jesus Christ and that sin nature will always have with us and brother and Abraham didn't have the Holy Ghost right he never did you know and God spoke to him you know he didn't grab him by the neck you know get up that hill and even to kill his own son you know Abraham's had just walked and just did it without the Holy Ghost so it's it's a tremendous testimony and we stand today now he had his things he had his things you know when he went to Egypt and with his with Sarah and all those things down there and you know made mistakes and God had to come down himself and that's predestination you know come down and you know get him out of there and say to that King no don't go take he can't had that woman and he's he's my prophet and he's gonna pray for you and you know he's confused and but that's that was but over and if you read in Hebrews 11 Abraham never made a mistake he was perfect in all his ways face upon the earth and the father of the faithful so just God rich in mercy so in in that so after all that and there's it could be more added I'm sure but we know that the Holy Spirit is there to as a as a mission to guide us we read it in Ezekiel 36 when he's and the God is going to come down and do what he has to do in order to bring bring up plan of redemption to bring his family back together with him in a new land right as we read there and that's what's happening right now and it's right at the end of it so so here so just finish under and the blood brother Brennan talked about that that the experience he had with the cafeteria on a Sunday morning and he walked into it and he saw corruption what was going on in there and the woman and etc etc and and he was he was you know he was grieved by it and he he was said to God you know you know how long are we gonna put up with this why don't you come down and just eliminate it all and and the Holy Spirit was was great and called him in behind the door and he said and he showed him he showed him that bumper that bumper of blood that was around the earth right so this is this is too great this is Grace for our age because we're in the we're in the in the age of Pentecost under that under the Jewish law it was seven times seven the forty forty nine weeks that they did but with us it was the ages - it's a seven ages and were under this this blood so there's a so before before that that this this was if someone wasn't under the the blood of the bulls and goats they could be judged but under this blood that that God has put in from Calvary it's all sort of wood and all over the world and it's grace so people people can do things in sin and whatever and there's no judgment there's a judgment to follow but there's there's grace inside on the earth now because of Calvary Acts John 3:16 for God so loved the world so that is Grace and we know the grace is waning it's starting to pull away from the earth now because we're over there the 7 times 7 now rather than 7 Church ages and the and the 17 is really it see you know it's the age of Pentecost really you know is the Pentecostal age and and and now we're you know it's broke up into - really - Pentecost Asia and the bride age which is the last part of the seven days but in here if a person if a person in here sins they do really they're really they're not judged at the time they they they're not born again or whatever or if they you know they're not you know on there but they're still under the blood per se and if they if they leave that if they died here and went into the ground when they when they come up before God they will come out of it once they come out of this out of this dimension here and into the other dimension dimension of the lost they will have all that was on them going in to face a judge and angry God they will have that right now if you're a believer here and you and you've you're under the blood you claim the blood like that when you cross this blood line in here you will go to the sixth dimension and you'll be covered by the blood and you'll have nothing nothing to be judged by as a bride of Jesus Christ so all of that will be absolved from you because you claimed it and it was washed away and you received the Holy Ghost so you can pass from this life into the next dimension and you'll be covered you'll be in a place of rest a place worth God god abides me so that that will that will happen but not for the unbeliever because that bumper of blood is still there for them right and then it'll it'll be there but you notice now you'll see more and more you know where your see God is and it's just going into his his judgment the part of this judgment so that's the so that's what brother Branham saw and when he when he saw that and he saw that Christ was was there you know for the forgiveness of sins and for that woman that was there you know and for what he said and for what that woman said Christ took all of those sins so you can't condemn anybody Christ don't condemn them so you can't right and there is coming a time when they will be condemned you know they will be before and judged and whatever you know it's like brother Lonnie said there and in the message that you know that there will be answer for what they did in for the spirit that controlled him right today that hit they'll have to face that at some point because we know that the picture of the cloud there is a picture you know of a judge you know coming into a judge there with the white beard and the white wait here and everything it's a judge no longer a priest we're in the cemetery changes in Revelation one you seem with the with the cloth around him like a priest so that that now is passing because you know it with with seven you know all through revelation as seven is his completion and when Jesus on a cross he said it was finished that part was finished but it wasn't all finished because he went he went he did his thing you know he went to to the souls in prison and you know they were waiting for that appoint on Calvary and then they were released they had received a blood sacrifice they release and went with with God and be and and before that he went as an and that's right he went and raised from the dead and he went into heaven and presented as sacrifice which would be the atonement for the sins just as soon as the high priest would go to the Holy of Holies he on a yearly basis he did that once for all we read that in Hebrews so that was done and then he came back down anything ate and everything but before he couldn't touch him because he was he was narrating could not be defiled by someone human and had to do that so but once he did that he came down eight and then he fellowship there with the Saints for so many days right and then he went went back he became he took under then the role of the Son of God and came back and living in his in his his children those that were his family those were destinated who had the seed life of God so we talked about before with the with the token and we know that in the in the first three ages you know it was continually declining as they as the really the first three ages were a lot based on the teachings of Paul and they started to slip away and the devil was moving in and mix him with the word and then funny and it opened Pergamus where they ended up with a trinity of god's and lost the name of god they lost the name of God then it was the most precious thing but they lost it and so then in the fourth age we know that if went into you know it went into almost disappeared off the earth but it was just safe barely it was the longest age but it was the time they they were in this age where the Catholic Church was coming you know in the power and the Pope and all of this was getting set up in that age and it was a terrific time for the church the truth are almost you know was it was but only by grace that it wasn't just eliminated from the earth but it it wasn't and the corner corner took the seat had to go back into the ground and come back in again which it did in Luther so we see now Luther coming back here Luther was coming back my brother Brennan was said it was a sprig a sprig that came up and the word was starting to be restored again through this age of reformation and then and as we talked about last time in the token you know the Luther received the Holy Ghost and and he received the Holy Ghost and the gift and just under justification and they had that revelation of justification but then you know there was a lot of things that still had to come and he was covered by the blood because he still did things that were in today you just couldn't do right you know he's so drank and smoked and he believed in the annihilation of the Jews and all you know so there was a blood covering form the blood had to cover for that for him and then came along the next day revealed more and it was in the Philadelphia age and it was sanctification and that was it there was more revealed justification and sanctification now for for Wesley and it was you know we're still no different than the Holy Ghost you know because you know how do you get the Holy Ghost well you know Luther's saying you know I'm justified well how do I know you're just fine you know I mean how do how do you know you're saying you know it's it's one of those it's a spiritual thing but then there was things that Wesley had to the cover but they had they were given given gifts here and the blood had there was less to cover with the blood but the blood had to cover because he still believed in a Trinity and all of those things right and then there was the next came up was the baptism of the Holy Spirit and the gifts that came up in the Pentecostal age in this age because now we're starting to see an open door here at the end of the at the end of the Wesley age going into this age and which reveal again the name once more started to get again and and people were sent to baptize them in the name in that soul so here where it was almost lost down here it was certainly come open brother mentioned your name you know that scripture where it talks about the opening door the door opening up in that age into the last age where the name again would be revealed so then there was there was still more things that had to be covered by the blood because this wasn't exactly if if we remember that you know Wesley came up and was these leaves of the wheat plant and then there was more came up and then we in Pentecost it was the husk but it's still not the same that was planted here is not in the green right here we're still not at this grain age so God would God would give these things as a token you know you had to be justified that was a token back then right in what in Wesley it was a token that sanctification and God gave to give the giver gave that gift into that group so that they could be saved you don't I think we gathered that they could receive the Holy Ghost and in the last age now and Pentecost thought they had it they thought they had it you know and they and realized after they didn't and in the last age it was a grain age we see the seed age is where now after the planting the seed came up and it's identical to what was planted here wasn't see it wasn't identical and it had to be covered by the blood how they lived and everything wasn't the same what they believed wasn't the same as what went into the ground right it had to be the grain I mean and here so there was less of the blood you still lose some of the blood because you're you're in the flesh but what happened here it wasn't to give her given a gift now it was the giver had come in because it was back to grain again so and that's the token that's what brother brian says that's the most important thing is now he's getting ready for the last last the last event in the in the church now which is the resurrection and in rapture I were looking for a rapture yes but we're looking for a resurrection first right the Saints gotta rise first and then we see the rapture so now in this just to finish up that there you know we were talking about the token but the token now is to give her right here the giver was given a gift or perb and says you got to have the Holy Ghost but they had the Holy Ghost you know how does that work right but it was just a part of him because in because we know that the we know that in the seven church ages Dewar's the seven spirits of God and each age had a spirit but in the last age when this came all the seven spirits were back into one right so now it was divided here the son of man was here he went up into heaven and now it was split up into seven seven spirits and we see it in the seven church ages right the seven spirits before God in the in Revelation one and now they all came back in this last age and now it was the son of man again son of man again in in in all those seven spirits all in one back in this age wonderful time and that was the token now it was the full spirit the Holy Spirit the the same seed that went in and was at the beginning now is in the bride again so when we look at it when we look at it and I think what's getting revealed here I'm only only just going going here just so when when the seals came he came to the first seal the second seal third seal and there was a symbol here so over here you know you had a you know the third seal you see a balance you know you know you see a balance here and it talked about what this was in Burma and explain what that was the balance you know like in in that age and and you see the the different the the beasts here in the in this third seal you know you see the here the horse rider and you see the ox and the man in the in this age and the eagle in the fourth seal right and then you see the beasts coming here you know the horse riders coming through here and it and it gives you something to explain it he was talking about what this meant what this man and give me a revelation but by explaining but when he came to the seventh seal and a seventh seal here's what the it says in Revelation 8 1 that there was silence in heaven for a half an hour right so this is what hears we now here's the symbols for the seventh seal this is it nothing he never gave you anything there's nowhere in there in in the Bible and you know program is a bit worried too you know going into this Seventh Seal what what there's but as we see now you know he it was gonna start like everything manifests itself eventually it wasn't gonna be any hint to it at all because there was gonna be nothing physical anymore there was nothing physical or no ham it's all gonna happen inside a people you know so don't look for this this and this to happen it's all going to happen inside you so so it's revealed that that Christ you know in the seventh seal Christ would not come back he would come back but he would be same as Ezekiel 36 he would come back in a people yeah right and this is the full second master second appearing of Christ in a people so all the people will see here is a is a group of people that we will call the bride and he he changed it from church because he changed his names he changed Saul appalled he changed his from church to bride why did he change it from because they rejected it the church rejected it and he calls the bride which is to mrs. Jesus Christ so what will be manifested in the last age is not Christ coming back see in the first in in the end of the Old Covenant in the Old Testament you know all of these things that were stunning the prophets and the people was shown who who God was like Moses he was delivering and Christ would be the deliverer and it was the Spirit of Christ in Moses to deliver the people and they know that story inside out they know that and it showed all of these things all up to the prophets and then in so in the last time you know the angel comes to Mary and he says you know you're gonna be with child and God does it all himself this the blood cell and the egg and all of it is him is still going to be a man because you know Mary eats and he's gonna just like Kimberly now at the more she eats that baby is forming it was a it was flesh man right was gonna had the blood of God and the Spirit of God with no sin nature it didn't have the flesh that you or I would have that would come through the woman the same way because the woman had nothing to do with it Mary had nothing to do with her it was all gone but it had to be a man and Jesus was a hundred percent God and a hundred cent man how can it be a hundred seven hundred cent it's a paradox you know but he was he was he could he could feel he couldn't sin but he could feel everything you know he had emotions and he could be sad it could cry and all of those things but still he could you know race a dead you know and only God can do that right where Brian never did it he just said there if anyone says they got healing power in Christ he said that's a lie you know it's only there's only one that could do that right so when when he when he grew up and he went to the you know he went to the to be baptized by John the Holy Spirit came down on him right the Spirit of God that started his work there and he and then so he went up to the Pharisees and he said voila you know and they he said I am I'm him I'm his he killed I'm I'm a Isaiah 53 and they said no you're not you know they rejected it they didn't accept it at all the whole thing was rejected you know so and now and now we're in the same point again we're in at the end of the second age and they're all waiting for Christ to come just like that just like he went up to the Pharisees and he stood up and he's gonna go to the church leaders or whatever in saying you know Here I am we were expecting it let's go and it's not going to happen like that he's not going to show at all like that at all when he shows himself in Revelation 19 they will will not want to see him you know it's too late so we so in this age because of the the bride and the bridegroom now it was God's whole plan if we see it in Christ the mystery God revealed you know he just expand it out from the southern seal and said here's the three things that I'm gonna do in this last age and it had to do with the bride and the bridegroom going back to - bringing it all back to the Garden of Eden and the Millennium is the Garden of Eden back again so like I said you get your title deed and you get the earnest and the Holy Ghost then it's all don't it is all done right now except for the body so that we would know the body so you say well you know it's all finished well I'm selling this body but that's just a plan for that you know it's a plan and it's coming very close because you know when you look at the plant when you look at the plant here you know when it comes to if you look at any plant you cannot leave that there forever you know a fruit on the plant it's gonna rot and and it can trot so we're right up past the husk and this you know it's it's now ripening its ripening right now so it has to end soon everything has to end soon because you cannot let that prove rot on the vine you know whatever it is it can't it is it's a natural thing we don't know when it is you know is it it has to do with the the perfection and the sons of God and when they come perfection and maturity because we know we're not babies anymore here now we're at the end now he's marrying a bride it hasn't been mature person you know someone like Christ is not going to marry a bay a young girl you know it's going to marry a mature bride right so it has to be what we're we're that close it we have to be coming to maturity whatever God calls that maturity or adoption of songs you know we where we get the power we get the power you know that the name of the tech is as good as the father's right so we come to that spot and brother Branham came to that spot because he was you know as Christ in him was the wave offering because he could brother Brian could step up and say you know let her squirrel be there right that is that so he his name was just as good on a check he say he'd say I want a squirrel to be created and he rates it out and signs it and God does it here's this world so the maturity is there you know the wave offering is there we know is going to come because we've seen that manifestation of the of the sons of God right there in that man and he said just before he left in communion just a couple of paragraphs his last words on the earth he said I realized I'm not the son of of Charles and ellebra no you know he says I'm not that anymore he says that was this God he said I've moved you know and recognize that now I'm a son of God I'm not gonna have any of that flesh left or anything like that I'm gonna be a true son and daughter gone which was Ezekiel 36 you know was he was going to come into those people and do sanctify them and he was going to bring them and fulfill the plan of redemption and bring all those people back into his family together with him in a new land and that's what we've come to you know and you know we just have to be so close so you know the name of God was restored the name of God I was taught about the seven seals so here is the seventh seal there's nothing so now it's he wouldn't say it you know he wouldn't like he you know the angel said you know you fooled it up you know you first pull second Pole you know you're told how it worked and you know it all up you know if you read in why we're so tossed about when he was fishing and he came to him in the turbine and they told him you know like the first pole in the second pole and you know it's like you you can't go saying how how it works right and he wouldn't do it in this in the seventh seal and when the third pole was being revealed he said he it was happening but he wouldn't say how it was going to be done it was you know and it was the revealing of the word and these these things that were going to happen and what it was it was going to be that that bridegroom in the bride United together and the manifestation of any change and the name was changed and the manifestation of Christ is going to be the bride on the earth and that's what they will see in the last days they will never see Christ because brother Brian says you only see Jesus in the in the first in the first three chapters I need no see until revelation 19 and people say when he comes down with the Saints in Revelation 19 at the end of the Armageddon but well how about Revelation 10 with Revelation 10 no spiritual Baran was referring to physical the physic they saw Jesus physically here and they saw him in 19 they'll see him physically there in the body but in this in this in Revelation 10 he he's there spiritually and bringing in it really is the bride age is the seventh seal it's all of us coming together in the end right so it's all manifesting now now I'll just read it because I think just to finish up here so it so this is this is so this is this is questions and answers in the seals it's just before the Seventh Seal there's really just a few quotes here the show people were so going into the seventh seal eight when one day the first second took six days and this is Sunday morning just before the Seventh Seal and they were worked up and brother brother brother brother knew it and he knew this is you know your tinnitus this is what you're gonna get yeah nothing you know because it's gonna take a little time it took time for brother Branham you know he preached him attraction under a mountain and he was saying I just saw that for the first time and you know so it took a little time you know for all of this to manifest because God was gonna do it and and here's what he told the people before and I think it's what reading because you know we have to take heed of herself because so many people try to figure it out they came up with things and but it was never meant to be like that like and all of your conscious to know that there's something mysterious happening and it's happening and I know what it is and I'm not saying that it's the grace of God that lets me know that what it is it's something that's tremendous and it's gone right right now and there's not a way in the world for you to see it but so help me with the Bible on my hand I know what it is it's been told to you before you don't try to put any interpretation but just believe me as your brother we're living in a great hour and a mint this is a great hour this is the fulfillment verse 14 and well you just be real humble here's what we Israeli told us to do be real humble be a Christian try to live for God and live honest with your fellow man I love those who don't love you and you only make it a mysterious something and mess the whole program of God up and and they messed it up it got messed up they came up with everything you know ever since ever since March March March 24th 1963 they messed it up yesterday afternoon something happened in my room that I'll never be able to leave it you see and about two weeks ago something happened they'll never be able to as long as I live on that's just I'll never be able to get away from it so it's at verse 6 16 I read 60 and so the church you're not supposed to know these things so don't put no interpretation to any anything you just go ahead and just remember what you're told live a Christian life go to your church be a real light wherever you are and just burn for Christ and tell the people that how you love him and just let your testimony he would love all the time with the people because if you don't you twist yourself out into something there and you're off the beaten track every time you try to do it you've done that so just don't try to make no interpretation especially tonight when that when that seal becomes up up in front of you just don't try to interpret it just go ahead and just be humble and go right on with the same plain message and he's saying God is gonna do this there's no one's gonna do this this is all gonna and it's not gonna be in the physical you know it's gonna be in the spiritual it's gonna be in a people and we know that now it's gonna be in abroad so just don't interpret anything if God wants you to know anything he will send it to you that's very important if you want you to when he needs you to know he'll we're usually when it's interpreted right that it will be sent to you and it would be revealed to you but what you need will be sent to you so just be real real solid now whole still something has happened you understand what I mean don't you know they didn't if you can understand it this is the third pole you should have caught that the other day and you remember it there'll be no impersonation like there was of the other two so he's just a just warmin warning them so you know everything and everything was just you know gonna happen but there was nothing we could do to make it happen there's nothing you can do to stop it you're saying do what come here we do to something what could she done no I'm not doing it you know that didn't work didn't work for John the Baptist father right he was struck dumb you know and said you're gonna you're gonna do it so so what some it's it's just whatever we need is gonna be sent to us and all of this will be fulfilled but we know that they've made a mess of it but it still it didn't make no difference to God what what he needed he sent to us and what we're gonna need he's gonna send to us and it's all gonna happen in the end and his people will be redeemed and he will be in his people and sanctified and his and the name of God and as it is in in here and the name of God it shows how important it is and he said they profaned my my holy name my holy name and I will sanctify in verse 23 of Ezekiel 37 I was act upon my great name which was which was profaned among the heathen which he had profaned in the midst of them and the heathen shall know that i am the lord when i shall be sanctified in you before his eyes and this coal i don't have it here but i'll read it it's out of god's when he provide a place of worship and the name is in the word because he is the word and amen to that amen what what is he then this is what is he then he said the word interpreted is the manifestation of the nail of God flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my father which is in heaven has revealed this to you who I am and upon this rock I'll build my place of worship and the gates of Hell can shake it down amen all living Church of God standing firm foundation of Jesus Christ alone he can sing the song but if you're not on the Christ a word you're on teeth teetering faltering sand but upon this rock Christ Christ my word so he says the word interpretation is the manifestation of the name of God the name of God to be honored and the name is very important and this one last one here I actually call the coffee gave me this one and if you're baptized any other way but in the name of Jesus Christ it's an adultery baptism which is not found in the Bible so what what you do in word and deed do do it all in the name of Jesus after that what you do but first you have to come in his name Amen the name is important the name is everything the name is is it's what glorifies glorifies God Amen Lord bless you let's stand and we'll sing that song I think I wrote it down because he sang it my sins are washed away
