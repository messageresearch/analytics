[36:32] Oh heavenly father and oh God,
[36:36] Lord God, we are grateful for tonight
[36:40] for the gathering together for your
[36:41] children Lord God
[36:44] around your table Lord God to feast from

[36:51] Oh God we humble our hearts to you Lord
[36:53] God and we we say thank you Lord God for
[36:56] life. We thank you Lord God for the
[36:59] ability to respond to your word Lord
[37:02] God. And we thank you Lord God for the
[37:05] grace that you have brought upon us
[37:07] Lord.
[37:09] Oh God we recognize ourself in your
[37:11] presence that we are nothing Lord God.
[37:13] That that we can do nothing of oursel
[37:16] Lord God but in total dependence Lord
[37:20] God. We are trusting in your hands, Lord
[37:22] God, that you will come, Lord God, and
[37:25] take our fa frame vessel, Lord God, our
[37:28] feeble effort, Lord, and and that, Lord
[37:30] God, you will bless us, your people,
[37:32] Lord God. And and so God, Lord God, for
[37:35] all the needs that are gathered tonight,
[37:38] Lord, this evening, we ask for your
[37:40] blessing, oh God, upon your children,
[37:42] Lord God. And may God, the experiences
[37:45] that, Lord God, will bring you closer to

[38:16] Lord God, a a healer, Lord God, to the

[38:25] humble our hearts to you. And we say
[38:28] thanks in Jesus Christ's precious name.
[38:32] And we say, "Amen."
[38:34] Praise God.
[38:37] I'm saying, "God, good."
[38:41] Thank you, the Lord. one more time to be
[38:43] here
[38:44] in his presence.
[38:46] Amen. Standing
[38:49] humbly before the bride of Jesus Christ.
[38:53] Amen. And also um you know
[38:59] we are grateful for the prayers that
[39:01] have been met for our brethren there in
[39:05] Jamaica. You know for the needs that are
[39:08] there. You know, I spoke with one of the
[39:10] pastor this morning, this evening
[39:12] rather, and you know, they are in the
[39:15] process of putting things together. You
[39:17] know, they are doing a lot of repairing
[39:19] stuff like that. But we pray God's grace
[39:23] upon their lives. Amen.
[39:25] Tonight, we like to turn our Bibles to
[39:29] the book of 1 Corinthians 2. We like to
[39:34] continue on the thought that we had that
[39:36] we were speaking on the last time, you
[39:40] know, but I like how brother Mark will
[39:41] use the word. He said there's so many
[39:43] layers. So we layer it one and then we
[39:45] layer it. So we we're building
[39:47] something. Amen. So that we would like
[39:50] to do that tonight. So let us read 1
[39:53] Corinthian 2 beginning reading from
[39:55] verse 12.
[39:57] And the topic is the realities of God.
[40:02] We want to look at that really.
[40:06] And it read thus
[40:08] now we have received not the spirit of
[40:11] the world
[40:13] but the spirit which is of God that we
[40:16] might know the things that are freely
[40:19] given to us of God.
[40:21] Which things also we speak, not in the
[40:25] words which man's wisdom teacheth,
[40:28] but which the Holy Ghost teacheth,
[40:31] comparing spiritual things with
[40:33] spiritual.
[40:36] But the natural man receiveth not the
[40:38] things of the spirit of God, for they
[40:41] are foolishness unto him, neither can he
[40:45] know them, because they are spiritually
[40:48] discerned.
[40:50] But he that is spiritual judgeth all
[40:52] things. Yay, he himself is judge of no
[40:56] man. For who knoweth the mind of the
[40:59] Lord, that he may instruct him, but we
[41:03] have the mind of Christ. You may be
[41:07] seated tonight. Amen.
[41:11] You know, I
[41:14] I particular choose this topic because
[41:18] I believe that God is bringing us into
[41:21] real experiences, real Christian
[41:23] experiences really. And you know, um it
[41:28] is taking us just from living a mortal
[41:31] life. You know, we are subjected to this
[41:34] mortal life by reason of birth. But I
[41:38] believe you know the the the the the
[41:40] work of the Holy Spirit is to bring us
[41:42] alive to something real you know and I
[41:46] believe that is what you know we are
[41:48] heading into that's what the Bible the
[41:50] scripture is coming alive it's it's
[41:53] feeling more real than before and you
[41:56] know and as we try to find words to
[41:59] express these things really you know the
[42:02] last time we were here and that we
[42:04] looked on the the the quote brother
[42:07] spoke of the the eternal thoughts of God
[42:10] and I like to speak from that really
[42:13] because you know he speaks of those
[42:16] eternal thoughts you know that they're
[42:17] real and you know and so if we can see
[42:21] the realities of God's eternal thought
[42:24] he said the eternal thoughts of God he
[42:26] said let me ask are the thoughts of God
[42:30] eternal he said if you can see this you
[42:33] will see many things he that God is
[42:37] unchangeable in both essence and
[42:39] behavior. We have studied that and
[42:42] proven that already. God is infinite in
[42:46] his abilities. So therefore he as God
[42:50] must be omnisient. He said if he's
[42:53] omnisient then he is not now learning
[42:58] nor is he taking counsel even with
[43:01] himself nor is he at any time adding any
[43:06] adding to his knowledge. He said if he
[43:09] can add to his knowledge then he's not
[43:11] obnisscent.
[43:13] He said the best we can say is that
[43:16] something he will be. He said but that
[43:21] is not scriptural. He said he is
[43:24] omnisient.
[43:26] He said he has never had a new thought
[43:30] about anything because all his thought
[43:33] that he had always had and always will
[43:37] have and said and know the hand from the
[43:40] beginning because he is God. He said
[43:44] thus the thoughts of God are eternal.
[43:48] They are real. Amen. He said they are
[43:52] not simply like a man with a blueprint.
[43:54] And the blueprint is you know the
[43:56] thought of drafting something really.
[43:59] But he said it's not like a man with a
[44:02] blueprint. He had to draw up and which
[44:05] one day will be translated into
[44:08] substance and form. But he said they are
[44:12] already real and eternal and a part of
[44:15] God. And you know he made reference to
[44:18] Abraham. He said God had God always had
[44:22] his thought of ab of Adam and he said
[44:25] and his thoughts was yet unexpressed.
[44:30] You know church when we see that really
[44:33] you know brother spoke of you know God
[44:36] and and the Bible speak of it really he
[44:38] said and God is a spirit. We speak we
[44:42] see the Bible speaks of it when he said
[44:44] the spirit of God and said that the
[44:47] spirit of God he spoke he said it's like
[44:49] an eternal fountain and you know it's
[44:51] it's like using words to express it
[44:54] really you know but he said like a a a
[44:57] fountain of of and when you think about
[44:58] a fountain you think about a spring that
[45:00] that springs up and and and and it keep
[45:03] on going and going and going where he
[45:06] said it's a fountain of life a fountain
[45:10] of eternal life it it never starts nor
[45:13] does it end it keep on flowing. So it's
[45:16] it's a fountain. It's a is an unending
[45:20] flow of life. God is life. Are you
[45:25] there, church? And hallelujah. And this
[45:28] life, brother Mark, is eternal life.
[45:32] Hal, it's an unending flow. It is an
[45:35] unending ending flow of eternal life.
[45:39] Hallelujah. And so we saw, BROTHER BAM
[45:42] SAID THAT ALL THAT GOD WAS, HE POURED it
[45:46] into Christ. HALLELUJAH. BUT WHAT GOD
[45:49] WAS DOING, CHURCH, HALLELUJAH, HE WAS
[45:52] BRINGING THE LIFE, HALLELUJAH, INTO
[45:54] MANIFESTATION.
[45:56] BECAUSE OUTSIDE OF GOD revealing
[45:59] himself, UH, HALLELUJAH, IN A FORM THAT
[46:02] HE could be understood, THE LIFE OF GOD
[46:05] COULD NOT BE UNDERSTOOD. AND SO WHAT HE
[46:07] DID, HALLELUJAH, AS WE GO OVER THESE
[46:09] THINGS, HALLELUJAH, what he did, HE
[46:12] BROUGHT HIMSELF IN A VISIBLE FORM,
[46:15] HALLELUJAH, CALL the logos of the word
[46:18] of God. THE WORD OF GOD IS AN EXPRESSION
[46:22] OF THE LIFE OF GOD. ARE YOU THERE
[46:25] CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. Praise God. Hal. So
[46:28] we say that Christ is the visible PART
[46:33] CALLED THE SON OF GOD. Now you see that
[46:36] the father that you know in the
[46:38] denominational world when they speak of
[46:41] the SON OF GOD HALLELUJAH THEY BELIEVE
[46:43] THAT GOD HAD A SON BUT THE SUNSHIP OF
[46:46] GOD IS NOT ANOTHER GOD BUT THE SUNSHIP
[46:50] OF GOD SPEAKS OF THE EXPRESSION OF GOD
[46:54] becoming visible. Hallelujah. Are you
[46:56] WITH ME CHURCH? AND SO WE COULD LOOK
[46:58] UPON GOD IN THAT VISIBLE PART CALLED THE
[47:02] SUNSHIP of God. So the sunship uh the
[47:05] son of God is NOT ANOTHER GOD. IT'S GOD
[47:08] in a visible form. But what did he do
[47:11] church? HALLELUJAH. GOD WAS REVEALING
[47:15] THE LIFE. HALLELUJAH. That's where we we
[47:19] are going tonight. We need to see the
[47:21] life BECAUSE HALLELUJAH. THE LIFE IS
[47:25] REALITY.
[47:27] ARE you there church? It's real.
[47:29] Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen.
[47:33] Hallelujah. So the the lifeuh hallelujah
[47:37] this fountain of LIFE WAS POURED was
[47:41] revealed into a body.
[47:44] He was IMMORAL IN A BODILY FORM. HAL IT
[47:47] WAS MADE KNOWN in a bodily form.
[47:50] Hallelujah. Praise God. And so John in 1
[47:54] John 5
[47:56] and verse one
[47:59] hallelujah. Hallelujah. The Bible said,
[48:04] "If we receive the witness of man, THE
[48:08] WITNESS OF GOD IS GREATER. For this is
[48:11] the witness of God which he had a
[48:13] testify of his son." Now, this is GOD'S
[48:17] TESTIMONY OF HIS SON. HALLELUJAH. This
[48:21] is his testimony. He said, "He that
[48:23] believeth on the son of God has the
[48:26] witness in himself that and it said he
[48:30] that believeth not on the son of God,
[48:33] hallelujah, that made him a liar because
[48:35] he believeth not THE RECORD THAT GOD
[48:39] GAVE OF HIS SON." It said, "And this is
[48:42] the record." Oh my. HALLELUJAH. THAT GOD
[48:47] HAS GIVEN US ETERNAL LIFE.
[48:50] And this eternal life is in the sun.
[48:55] HALLELUJAH. POINTING TO THE WORD OF GOD.
[48:58] HALLELUJAH. THAT THERE'S LIFE IN THE
[49:00] WORD. HALLELUJAH. IT'S NOT JUST DEAD
[49:03] LETTERS, BUT LIFE. GOD'S OWN LIFE IS IN
[49:07] THE WORD. And the word IS GOD. ARE YOU
[49:12] BEAR WITH ME, CHURCH? AND SO GOD BEAR
[49:15] RECORD, HALLELUJAH, OF THE WORD THAT THE
[49:18] WORD, HALLELUJAH, HAS ETERNAL LIFE.
[49:22] WHOSE ETERNAL LIFE? GOD'S OWN LIFE IS IN
[49:25] HIS WORD. ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH? AND
[49:29] SO THE WORD WE DO NOT SAY WORDS OF DEAD
[49:32] LETTERS, BROTHER MARK, BUT WORDS OF
[49:35] ETERNAL LIFE. IT'S AN UNENDING FLOW OF
[49:38] LIFE that proceeded out of the word.
[49:41] Hallelu. No wonder Jesus said, "Search
[49:43] [screaming] the scripture, for in THEM
[49:45] YOU THINK YOU HAVE LIFE AND THEY OF
[49:48] WHICH testify of me." Hallelujah. The
[49:53] word of life.
[49:56] The scripture said,
[49:58] "Allelujah."
[50:01] Verse 11. And this is the record that
[50:05] God has given unto us eternal life. And
[50:10] this life is in his son. He that has the
[50:14] son has life.
[50:16] He that has not the son of God has not
[50:20] life.
[50:22] Hallelujah. These things have I written
[50:24] unto you that
[50:28] that believe on the name of the son of
[50:30] God that he may know. Hallelujah. That
[50:35] he have eternal life and that he may
[50:38] believe on the name of the son of God.
[50:43] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[50:46] We go down to to verse 18 there
[50:50] and it said, "For we know that whosoever
[50:54] is born of God sinn it not because that
[50:58] he is begotten of God
[51:02] keepeth himself,
[51:05] and that which and that wicked [snorts]
[51:07] one toucheth him not." Verse 19 he said
[51:10] and we know that we are of God and the
[51:14] whole world light in wickedness
[51:19] and we know and you you watch that
[51:22] scripture you watch that word it is
[51:24] saying that and you know and and you
[51:26] know it hallelujah it is now a CALL TO
[51:30] CONSCIOUSNESS
[51:31] hallelujah that if you are of God if you
[51:34] belong to God HALLELUJAH THEN THE LIFE
[51:37] THAT IS IN GOD HAL IS ALSO in you.
[51:41] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We get there as
[51:44] we go on. It says, "And we know that the
[51:47] son of God is come
[51:50] and has given us an understanding that
[51:53] we may know him." That is true.
[51:57] And that we are in him.
[52:00] That is true. even in his son Jesus
[52:03] Christ. This is the true God and eternal
[52:08] life.
[52:10] Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. And
[52:13] so the Bible said in verse 21, little
[52:16] children, keep yourself from idols.
[52:19] Hallelujah. So Jesus Christ is the true
[52:23] God
[52:25] &gt;&gt; and the true eternal life.
[52:28] But remember, hallelujah, this life is
[52:31] an expression. Hallelujah. It is God
[52:35] pouring that life. Hallelujah. From a
[52:38] thought into a word. Are you there with
[52:41] me, church? And so, Hallelujah. And so,
[52:43] when when it when he became the word,
[52:46] hallelujah, all that God was was poured
[52:49] out into the word. Are you there, the
[52:52] church? And so, the word is the
[52:54] expression of God. Hallelujah. Praise
[52:58] God. You go with me as we travel
[52:59] tonight.
[53:01] Hallelujah.
[53:03] Amen. So, brother said, "So when Adam
[53:05] was form of the dust of the earth and
[53:09] his spirit being created by God, then
[53:12] Adam become a thought expressed and
[53:16] those eternal thoughts were not were not
[53:19] manifested."
[53:20] and said, "And down through the
[53:24] centuries we could go, we find Moses and
[53:27] Jeremiah and John the Baptist, and each
[53:30] one of these were God's eternal thoughts
[53:35] expressed in its season." He said, "Then
[53:38] we come to Jesus the logos."
[53:42] Hallelujah. And that's what brother
[53:44] expressed him. Hallelujah. He said,
[53:47] "Jesus the logos." Hallelujah. He said
[53:51] he was the perfect complete thought
[53:54] expressed
[53:56] and he became known as the word of God
[54:00] and that what he is and forever will be.
[54:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. But all of this
[54:08] church is an expression of God.
[54:12] Hallelujah. God bringing forth that
[54:14] eternal life. Hallelujah. bringing the
[54:17] life into a person into a being. Hal
[54:19] into an expression.
[54:21] Hallelujah. The Bible said in first John
[54:24] 1 of St. John 1.
[54:30] Hallelujah.
[54:31] Actually
[54:33] this is first John one is that that
[54:36] which was from the beginning which we
[54:38] have heard which we have seen with our
[54:41] eyes which we have looked upon and our
[54:44] eyes have handled the word of life.
[54:48] Hallelujah. That's the son of God
[54:49] church. Hallelujah. For the life was
[54:53] made manifested,
[54:55] and we have seen it, and bear witness,
[54:57] and show unto you that eternal life,
[55:00] which was with the father, and was
[55:03] manifested unto us. Hallelujah. You see,
[55:07] I want you to understand what I'm trying
[55:08] to show you, church. HALLELUJAH. THAT
[55:11] WHEN THE LIFE H IS MADE EXPRESSED,
[55:14] HALLELUJAH. It brings forth had
[55:16] substance.
[55:18] It brings forth material. It bring for
[55:21] something that you can look upon. ARE
[55:23] YOU GETTING ME CHURCH? SO IT'S GOD IS
[55:26] NOT JUST UP THERE SOMEWHERE BUT
[55:28] [screaming] GOD CONSTANTLY UNVEILING
[55:30] HIMSELF. HELLO AND becoming substance
[55:33] and and unveiling and unveiling. ARE YOU
[55:35] THERE me church? But how is he doing it?
[55:38] HE'S DOING IT BY HIS WORD.
[55:42] HALLELUJAH. THE WORD OF GOD holds the
[55:44] mystery. The whole of the word of GOD
[55:47] EXPRESSES GOD the life.
[55:50] HALLELUJAH. THE LIFE unveiling God to
[55:53] us. Hallelujah. And so we see that
[55:57] Christ is the word of God.
[56:01] That was the logos that went out of God
[56:03] called the son of God. Hallelujah. The
[56:06] word of God is a person, an eternal
[56:10] being. Hallelujah. That is settled in
[56:12] heaven.
[56:14] Hallelujah. Now church, the Bible said
[56:17] the word is already settled in heaven.
[56:20] Hallelujah. AND SO ALL THAT GOD IS, ALL
[56:24] THAT ETERNAL THOUGHT, HAL, IT'S ALREADY
[56:27] SETTLED. I wish I could show it to you
[56:30] church. It's like, hallelujah. It's like
[56:33] a book and you have ALL THE CHAPTERS
[56:36] BEFORE YOU AND YOU CAN SEE EVERY PIN,
[56:40] everything that needs to happen,
[56:42] EVERYTHING THAT WILL HAPPEN, IT'S
[56:45] ALREADY THERE. There's no new thought.
[56:48] Are you there with me, church? It's
[56:50] already finished. Hallelujah. So in in
[56:54] this dimension, WE'RE WONDERING, WE'RE
[56:56] TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. BUT THERE'S
[56:58] ANOTHER DIMENSION SOMEWHERE. HALLELUJAH.
[57:01] WE ALL IS PERFECT UH BY THE WORD OF GOD.
[57:06] Are you there MY ME CHURCH? THERE'S NOT
[57:08] ONE SICK THERE. THERE'S NOT ONE SIN
[57:11] THERE. THERE'S NOTHING UH BUT THE WORD
[57:13] OF God in its perfect form. ARE YOU
[57:16] THERE MY CHURCH? WHY? BECAUSE IT COMES
[57:19] FROM A perfect source. UH A PERFECT LIFE
[57:22] A PERFECT GOD. HALLELUJAH. Praise God.
[57:27] Amen.
[57:29] Hallelujah.
[57:32] Hallelujah. So the word is already
[57:35] settled.
[57:37] It's already done. Hallelujah. In
[57:40] heaven. But now church, hallelujah. That
[57:44] word that is already settled,
[57:46] HALLELUJAH. GOD IS BRINGING that life,
[57:50] hallelujah, into manifestation.
[57:52] In other words, he's pouring out
[57:54] himself, uh, unveiling more of himself
[57:57] to you and I. Hallelujah. But who holds
[58:01] that mystery? Hallelujah. I'm going
[58:04] somewhere. I want you to go WITH ME
[58:05] TONIGHT. WHERE that mystery holds? It is
[58:09] held in the word. Hallelujah. And the
[58:11] word is not just dead letters, church.
[58:15] But the word is a living reality.
[58:19] Hallelujah. A living reality.
[58:24] Hallelujah. And so brother said,
[58:27] Hallelujah.
[58:29] We are living now as we are. Brother
[58:32] Mark, we're living in the shadows of our
[58:34] reality.
[58:35] Hallelujah. Brother Adam said
[58:38] because everything that got to have
[58:42] darkness in it, he said to make a
[58:45] shadow. See, because the shadow has got
[58:49] to possess so much darkness and so much
[58:52] light to make a shadow and it can't be
[58:56] alltogether dark. And it can't be allto
[58:59] together light. It's a if this dark,
[59:02] it's a it's real dark. It's if this
[59:05] light, there's no shadow. Hallelujah. It
[59:09] said nothing can make a shadow. But if
[59:13] it's mixed with dark and light, it make
[59:16] a shadow.
[59:18] Hallelujah. He said, "So we are really
[59:22] shadows of light." Hallelujah. In
[59:25] reference, hallelujah. TO THE LIFE.
[59:28] HALLELUJAH. The life THAT WE'RE LIVING.
[59:31] HALLELUJAH. IT'S NOT A LIFE that
[59:33] reflects IN TOTALITY OF THE LIFE OF THE
[59:37] WORD, BUT WE ARE LIVING THE SHADOW OF A
[59:40] LIFE. ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH? WHY?
[59:43] BECAUSE IN THIS LIFE, BROTHER MARK,
[59:45] WE'RE STILL SICK. WE'RE STILL HUNGRY. WE
[59:48] STILL ARE SUBJECTED. ARE YOU THERE ME
[59:50] CHURCH? BUT BROTHER BAM SAID,
[59:52] HALLELUJAH. And why? He said when you
[59:55] see a TREE HERE, HALLELUJAH, SUFFERING
[59:57] AND SICK, HE SAID THERE'S ANOTHER TREE
[1:00:00] SOMEWHERE THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
[1:00:04] ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH? SO WE ARE
[1:00:06] LIVING A SHADOW AT ONE TIME BUT SAID
[1:00:08] THIS LIFE IS A SHADOW OF A SHADOW UP A
[1:00:11] SHADOW OF A SHADOW. IT'S WAY BEYOND the
[1:00:15] reality.
[1:00:17] BUT God promised church that he's going
[1:00:20] to take US BACK TO THE REALITY.
[1:00:23] HALLELUJAH. WHAT IS THE REALITY? THE
[1:00:26] REALITY IS LIFE.
[1:00:28] REAL LIFE WITHOUT SHADOW, WITHOUT
[1:00:32] SICKNESS, without subjectivities.
[1:00:35] HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:00:36] HE'S CALLING US BACK TO THE LIFE BY THE
[1:00:39] WORD. SO YOU GOT TO GET TO THE WORD TO
[1:00:42] GET TO THE LIFE BECAUSE THERE'S LIFE IN
[1:00:44] THE WORD, ETERNAL LIFE.
[1:00:48] HALLELUJAH.
[1:00:50] So we are really a shadow of light.
[1:00:53] And we are reflecting life from
[1:00:55] somewhere.
[1:00:57] If you are a Christian that this being a
[1:01:01] shadow,
[1:01:02] it's only prove there's a life
[1:01:05] somewhere. Hallelujah. Where you can't
[1:01:07] die.
[1:01:10] Come on. Because this life has got death
[1:01:14] in it. It's a sea, but it's a shadow.
[1:01:18] Because you are you're a living moving
[1:01:21] creature with abilities to to see to
[1:01:24] think to move to talk and that the five
[1:01:28] senses of the body. BUT YET YOU know
[1:01:33] that there they are dying and there's so
[1:01:36] much trouble.
[1:01:39] You know it can't only be it's a it's a
[1:01:43] reflection.
[1:01:45] that there's a life and death mixed
[1:01:48] together. That's now. Hallelujah. Life
[1:01:53] and death mixed together. But he said
[1:01:56] the physical has to die.
[1:02:00] But if you are reflecting
[1:02:03] but your mortal life, the light of
[1:02:06] heaven, it said then you're reflecting
[1:02:08] THE ETERNAL LIFE IS a is a God. Then
[1:02:13] when you die, you go no more than go to
[1:02:17] that light because what you are
[1:02:20] reflecting.
[1:02:21] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Church, our
[1:02:25] eternal life starts here and now. Are
[1:02:29] you there me church? We when you receive
[1:02:31] that new birth, you receive eternal life
[1:02:34] in your soul. HALLELUJAH. AND EVERY NOW
[1:02:37] AND then you feel that that hunching of
[1:02:40] of another world calling you.
[1:02:43] Hallelujah. What is happening to you? Is
[1:02:46] God want to change your experience? He
[1:02:49] want TO TAKE YOU OUT OF JUST LIVING INTO
[1:02:52] THE THE BONDAGE OF THE SUBJECTIVE LIFE.
[1:02:55] UH BUT HE WANT TO TAKE YOU OUT INTO THE
[1:02:58] REALITY OF A LIFE SOMEWHERE BEYOND THIS
[1:03:02] LIFE. HALLELUJAH. AND SO WHILE WE LIVE
[1:03:05] IN THE SHADOWS, HALLELUJAH. WELL, THESE
[1:03:07] BODIES FEEL THEY ARE FRAIL AND AND
[1:03:10] THEY'RE FAILING. WHILE THE NEEDS arising
[1:03:13] and all of these things, BUT THE REALITY
[1:03:16] IS THAT SOMETHING HAS COME ALIVE IN OUR
[1:03:19] HEARTS BY THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:03:23] HALLELUJAH. WHY? PAUL SAID, HALLELUJAH.
[1:03:26] IN THE DAY WHEN YOU HEARD THE GOSPEL,
[1:03:30] HALLELUJAH, HE EVEN THE GOSPEL OF YOUR
[1:03:32] SALVATION, YOU ARE SEALED AFTER YOU
[1:03:35] BELIEVE. YOU ARE SEALED WITH THE HOLY
[1:03:38] GHOST of promise. Are you there me
[1:03:41] church? AND SO WHEN YOU ARE SEALED,
[1:03:43] [screaming] GOD SEALS ETERNAL LIFE ON
[1:03:46] THE INSIDE. AND SO IN THIS BODIES, WE
[1:03:49] ARE FIGHTING, WE ARE FAIL, WE ARE SICK
[1:03:52] AND ALL OF THESE THINGS. UH BUT IN OUR
[1:03:54] SOUL THERE'S A PEACEUH HALLELUJAH. IN
[1:03:57] KNOWING THAT GOD IS MY HEALER, GOD IS MY
[1:04:01] SAVIOR. GOD IS MY PROVIDER. ARE YOU
[1:04:04] THERE, CHURCH?
[1:04:05] HALLELUJAH. AND SO WE REST assured upon
[1:04:09] the perfect word of God.
[1:04:12] Hallelujah.
[1:04:14] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:04:20] Praise God.
[1:04:22] So we see that the life
[1:04:26] hallelujah God was bringing
[1:04:30] this life his own life to you and I.
[1:04:35] What we need church is not more of
[1:04:37] mortal life is not more of mortal
[1:04:40] experiences.
[1:04:42] What we need is more of God.
[1:04:45] MORE OF THE EXPERIENCES BY HIS WORD. Are
[1:04:49] you there church? We what we need,
[1:04:51] hallelujah, is to come in contact with
[1:04:53] SOMETHING THAT IS BEYOND THE HAL THIS
[1:04:56] MORTAL sense and something that brings
[1:04:59] us into a into INTO AN ENVIRONMENT THAT
[1:05:02] THAT RAISES UPH INTO THE UNTHINKABLE
[1:05:06] into the impossible.
[1:05:08] Hallelujah. But I have news for you
[1:05:10] tonight. UH HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE THAT'S
[1:05:12] EXACTLY WHAT GOD IS DOING. GOD IS
[1:05:15] CHANGING OUR EXPERIENCES.
[1:05:18] GOD IS TAKING US FROM THIS MORTAL AS
[1:05:21] BROTHER MAROS use it is the word the
[1:05:24] eternal part. HALLELUJAH. WHAT'S THIS
[1:05:27] CHURCH? IT'S LIFE. HALLELUJAH. AND THE
[1:05:30] LIFE IS THE WORD. HALLELUJAH. Praise
[1:05:34] God. IN OTHER WORD WHAT GOD IS DOING,
[1:05:36] GOD IS TAKING US back to the word of
[1:05:39] God.

[1:05:43] to you tonight. Hallelujah. I feel like
[1:05:45] I'm doing teaching, not preaching
[1:05:47] tonight, but you hear me. Hallelujah.
[1:05:49] But what God is doing, church, you see,
[1:05:51] when we speak of the word, so we there's
[1:05:54] no there's no there's no thought in our
[1:05:57] mind. There's no question in our thought
[1:05:59] as who the word of God is. Hallelujah.
[1:06:03] The word of God, HALLELUJAH, IS GOD MADE
[1:06:06] EXPRESSED.
[1:06:07] Is the eternal life that is made
[1:06:10] express. And we say THAT THAT WORD IS
[1:06:12] ALREADY settled in heaven. But when we
[1:06:16] SPEAK OF THE WORD, WE SPEAK OF THE WORD
[1:06:18] IN two context. We speak of the word hal
[1:06:22] in its longest form. HALLELUJAH. NOW IN
[1:06:26] THE LONGEST FORM, HALLELUJAH, IT'S
[1:06:29] already settled in heaven. And we speak
[1:06:32] of the word in its remma form. We're
[1:06:35] going to get into that tonight. The
[1:06:37] logus word and the rema word.
[1:06:41] Hallelujah.
[1:06:43] Hallelujah. Brother Bam said in the
[1:06:44] message.
[1:06:47] Hallelujah. The Lamb's book of life. It
[1:06:50] said the Bible, it said your names were
[1:06:53] written in the Lamb's book of life
[1:06:56] before the foundation of the world. Do
[1:06:58] you believe that tonight, church?
[1:07:01] Hallelujah. He said, "Oh my."
[1:07:04] The same time THAT CHRIST THAT GOD SAID
[1:07:08] CHRIST WOULD BE SLAIN, he wrote your
[1:07:12] name with his. He said, "Hallelujah."
[1:07:16] Said, "There you are. Your name was
[1:07:19] written him." He said, "And he
[1:07:23] and he said, and he deceived all, great,
[1:07:27] small,
[1:07:30] so so much were." He said so many were
[1:07:35] church members and pretended Christian.
[1:07:39] He deceived all whose name were not
[1:07:42] written not in the book in the church
[1:07:45] book. He said in the lamb's book of
[1:07:49] life. He said when before the foundation
[1:07:53] of the world, God wrote your name in the
[1:07:57] lamb's book of life by his spoken word.
[1:08:02] And he said, "And he sent Christ the
[1:08:05] sacrifice to buy it to redeem the same
[1:08:09] group that he had wrote their names in
[1:08:12] the lamb's book of life before the
[1:08:15] foundation of the world." Hallelujah.
[1:08:19] Are you there, the church? AND SO YOUR
[1:08:21] NAMES WERE WRITTEN, HALLELUJAH, in
[1:08:24] heaven, IN THE BOOK OF LIFE. UH, IN THE
[1:08:27] LAMB'S BOOK OF LIFE. HAL YOUR LIFE,
[1:08:30] CHURCH. BETTER MARK. YOUR LIFE DIDN'T
[1:08:33] START when you came here, BUT YOUR LIFE
[1:08:36] STARTED SOMEWHERE. YOU JUST HAD TO HAVE
[1:08:39] not come into THE RECOGNITION.
[1:08:41] HALLELUJAH. AS YET, BUT ONE DAY YOU'RE
[1:08:44] GOING TO COME INTO THAT RECOGNITION.
[1:08:46] HALLELUJAH. WHERE YOU STARTED.
[1:08:48] HALLELUJAH. YOU DIDN'T STARTED WHEN YOUR
[1:08:51] MOTHER AND YOUR FATHER CAME TOGETHER,
[1:08:54] BUT YOU STARTED IN THE LOGOS WORD. ARE
[1:08:58] YOU THERE WITH ME, CHURCH? HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:00] IT mean hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:09:03] HALLELUJAH. THAT IF GOD POUR ETERNAL
[1:09:05] LIFE IN THE WORLD AND YOU ARE PART OF
[1:09:08] THAT WORLD, IT MEAN THAT THERE'S SOME
[1:09:10] PART OF YOU THAT ALREADY HAVE eternal
[1:09:13] life. You have representation
[1:09:17] of predestination.
[1:09:20] HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:21] HALLELUJAH. SO IN THE LOGOS SOMEWHERE,
[1:09:25] HALLELUJAH. BEYOND THIS MORTAL LIFE.
[1:09:28] HALLELUJAH. ALL THINGS PERTAINTH TO YOU.
[1:09:32] IT'S ALREADY SETTLED.
[1:09:34] ARE YOU THERE, CHURCH? IT'S ALL OVER.
[1:09:37] It's finished. It's done. HALLELUJAH.
[1:09:41] HALLELUJAH. SO, IN THE LOGOS, IT'S DONE.
[1:09:44] IT'S FINISHED TO THE HIGHEST OF GOD.
[1:09:46] IT'S OVER.
[1:09:49] Oh my.
[1:09:52] Hallelujah.
[1:09:54] Because God wrote your name in the
[1:09:57] Lamb's book of life.
[1:10:00] Hallelujah. And you won't find Garfield
[1:10:03] Grant as in prescribed earthly name. But
[1:10:06] what is there is the revelation
[1:10:09] concerning you. In other word,
[1:10:12] hallelujah. Hallelujah. THE EXPERIENCE
[1:10:16] CONCERNING YOUR LIFE. Just like this
[1:10:19] mortal life. It's a life, but it's
[1:10:22] mortal life. It has a BEGINNING AND IT
[1:10:27] HAS AN END. Are you there, my church?
[1:10:30] BUT THERE'S ANOTHER LIFE. I I must want
[1:10:33] TO TELL YOU THAT THERE'S ANOTHER YOU
[1:10:35] SOMEWHERE.
[1:10:37] ARE YOU THERE, MY CHURCH? HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:40] THAT IS PERFECT. HALLELUJAH. BROTHER M.
[1:10:43] THERE'S THERE'S ANOTHER YOU SOMEWHERE.
[1:10:46] HALLELUJAH. THAT STANDS BEFORE GOD
[1:10:48] BETWEEN 18 AND 21. YOUNG IN YOUR
[1:10:51] YOUTHFUL, BUT THERE'S NO GRAY HAIR
[1:10:53] THERE, THERE'S NOTHING LIKE THAT. It's
[1:10:55] all perfect according to the WORD OF
[1:10:58] GOD.
[1:10:59] ARE you there in THE CHURCH? I'M TRYING
[1:11:01] TO SHOW YOU. HALLELUJAH. THAT THE
[1:11:03] SMARTER LIFE IS A SHADOW, BUT THERE'S
[1:11:06] ETERNAL LIFE. That you, Hallelujah, that
[1:11:09] if you have eternal life, now you always
[1:11:12] had eternal life.
[1:11:15] HALLELUJAH. PRAISE GOD. [screaming] AND
[1:11:17] SO, HALLELUJAH. THE DARKNESS THAT COME
[1:11:21] THAT HOLD YOU CAPTIVE AS PRISON.
[1:11:24] HALLELUJAH. WHEN THE LIGHT COMES HOME,
[1:11:27] IT wakes you up. Hallelujah. It points
[1:11:30] YOU TO WHO YOU are
[1:11:34] and it cannot hold you. It cannot keep
[1:11:37] you in this position.
[1:11:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Remember what
[1:11:42] they did with Jesus? They put a Roman
[1:11:45] seal upon the tomb. Think that will HOLD
[1:11:48] HIM. A CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. WHEN
[1:11:52] LIFE COMES ON THE SCENE, WHAT IT DOES TO
[1:11:56] IT brings forth a resurrection.
[1:11:59] THERE'S [screaming] POWER IN THE WORD OF
[1:12:01] GOD. POWER TO CHANGE CIRCUMSTANCES.
[1:12:05] Are you there, CHURCH? IT CHANGED THE
[1:12:08] HARD of things. HALLELUJAH. THIS POWER
[1:12:11] IN GOD'S WORD. HALLELUJAH. Praise God.
[1:12:16] So in the logos, it's already done.
[1:12:20] It's already finished. It's already
[1:12:23] over.
[1:12:25] Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:12:30] M and so first John 5 and verse 19 it
[1:12:34] says that we may know that we are THE
[1:12:39] SON OF GOD. THAT'S WHAT IT IS CHURCH.
[1:12:43] HALLELUJAH. IT'S A REALIZATION.
[1:12:46] THAT'S what it is. That's all THIS
[1:12:49] PREACHING IS ALL ABOUT IS GETTING YOU TO
[1:12:52] REALIZE
[1:12:53] THAT YOU HAVE ETERNAL LIFE IF YOU HAVE
[1:12:56] THE SON.
[1:12:58] AND ONE DAY IT'S LIKE YOU'RE LOOKING IN
[1:13:00] A MIRROR AND YOU'RE SEEING AN OBJECT and
[1:13:03] and little by little it's getting
[1:13:05] clearer AND CLEARER AND THE VISION IS
[1:13:09] GETTING CLEARER AND YOU'RE SEEING
[1:13:12] HALLELUJAH AND THE MORE YOU SEE THE MORE
[1:13:15] you become. Are you there me church?
[1:13:18] Because when you see IT YOU STEP RIGHT
[1:13:21] INTO IT. HALLELUJAH. And it becomes your
[1:13:24] experience. HALLELUJAH. PRAISE GOD. Oh
[1:13:29] my. Hallelujah.
[1:13:32] Hallelujah. John said that we may know
[1:13:36] that we are of God and the whole world
[1:13:41] light in wickedness.
[1:13:44] Hallelujah.
[1:13:45] Praise God.
[1:13:50] Praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:13:54] that we may know that we are sons of
[1:13:57] God.
[1:13:59] Hallelujah.
[1:14:00] Church, listen. As much as we lived in
[1:14:03] this mortal life, h but there's a
[1:14:06] reality somewhere that is calling us
[1:14:09] back to eternal life.
[1:14:11] Are you there me church? And it's not
[1:14:14] your responsibility. ALL WE WE asked to
[1:14:17] do is just to believe.
[1:14:20] BUT BUT GOD SAID HALLELUJAH THAT HE'S
[1:14:23] GOING TO RESTORE YOU. THAT'S GOD'S
[1:14:25] RESPONSIBILITY.
[1:14:27] If God said I'm going to HEAL YOU,
[1:14:29] THAT'S GOD'S RESPONSIBILITY.
[1:14:32] WHY? BECAUSE GOD SAID WHEN I SAY IT OUT
[1:14:34] OF MY MOUTH, IT WILL NOT RETURN TO ME
[1:14:37] VOID, BUT IT WILL ACCOMPLISH AFTER those
[1:14:41] things that I've said it for.
[1:14:44] Hallelujah. Praise God. Hallelujah. And
[1:14:47] so we see the Bible speaks of A PRODIGAL
[1:14:51] SON, BROTHER MARK. HALLELUJAH. This
[1:14:53] prodigal son, WE KNOW THE STORY QUITE
[1:14:56] WELL. HALLELUJAH. That he was HE HE WAS
[1:14:59] BORN, HALLELUJAH, IN A LINEAGE,
[1:15:02] HALLELUJAH, of of a very wealthy, rich,
[1:15:05] hallelujah, leader. AND SO HOW HE FOUND
[1:15:09] HIMSELF, HALLELUJAH, INTO A POSITION,
[1:15:13] HALLELUJAH, WHERE HE WENT TO HIS FATHER
[1:15:15] AND HE SAID, "FATHER, GIVE ME MY
[1:15:17] INHERITANCE." HALLELUJAH. I WANT THEM, I
[1:15:19] want to receive it now. But let me say
[1:15:22] this to you tonight, church. You see, WE
[1:15:24] KNOW THE STORY AS THE PRODIGAL SON. BUT
[1:15:28] BEFORE HE WAS A PRODIGAL SON, he was a
[1:15:32] son.
[1:15:36] Are you there with me church? Before he
[1:15:39] found himself, hallelujah, eating swine
[1:15:42] food, he was a son.
[1:15:47] Hallelujah. So let's read about his
[1:15:50] story. St. Luke 15 and verse 15. The
[1:15:54] Bible said, "And he went and joined
[1:15:56] himself to a citizen of that country,
[1:16:00] and he sent him into the field to feed
[1:16:02] swine,
[1:16:05] and he would faint.
[1:16:07] He would would faint and filled his
[1:16:10] belly with the but did heat. And no man
[1:16:16] gave unto him, oh my, this is a son."
[1:16:21] And when he came to himself,
[1:16:27] he said, "How many ire servant my father
[1:16:31] have bread enough and to spare and I
[1:16:36] perish with hunger?" He said, "I will
[1:16:40] arise and go to my father and I will say
[1:16:44] to him, Father, I have sinned against
[1:16:48] heaven and before thee, I'm no more I'm
[1:16:53] no more worthy TO BE CALLED THY SON." HE
[1:16:57] SAID, "MAKE me one of thy hired
[1:16:58] servant."
[1:17:00] And he arose and came to his father.
[1:17:04] Hallelujah. And many he was YET A GREAT
[1:17:07] WAY OFF. HIS father saw him and was and
[1:17:10] had compassion and ran and fell on his
[1:17:14] neck and kissed him. Oh my. Hallelujah.
[1:17:18] Just as we are tonight, CHURCH.
[1:17:21] HALLELUJAH. WE ARE NOT IN A true state,
[1:17:25] BUT GOD SAID THAT HE'S GOING TO SEND THE
[1:17:28] WORD. WE ARE LIKE THE PRODIGAL SON.
[1:17:31] HALLELUJAH. BUT THERE GOT TO COME A TIME
[1:17:34] THAT WE GOT TO COME BACK TO OURSELF. UH
[1:17:37] IT'S LIKE WE'RE IN ASLEEP IN AN AMNESIAN
[1:17:40] IN OUR MINDS. WE BELIEVE THAT WE'RE
[1:17:42] DOING THE RIGHT THINGS.
[1:17:44] HALLELUJAH. But there got to COME A TIME
[1:17:48] WHILE WE ARE HERE IN this earthly
[1:17:50] journey. We got to come back TO THE
[1:17:52] THOUGHT AND THE REALIZATION THAT WE ARE
[1:17:55] SONS OF GOD.
[1:17:59] BUT WHAT POSITION DOES THAT PUT put you?
[1:18:02] It puts you right into THE THE COMPLETE
[1:18:05] EXPRESS WORD OF GOD.
[1:18:08] Remember brother said hallelujah if I
[1:18:11] may quoted again. Brother said that that
[1:18:17] he said then Jesus
[1:18:19] which was the logos he said he was the
[1:18:22] perfect complete thought of God and he
[1:18:25] be he was known became known as the word
[1:18:30] hallelujah which he is and forever will
[1:18:33] be HALLELUJAH SO THE WORD IS ALREADY
[1:18:38] done it's finished SO IN OUR POSITION
[1:18:43] SON AS PRODIGALS.
[1:18:45] There got to COME A TIME WHEN YOU HEAR
[1:18:48] SOMETHING SOMETHING GOT TO WAKE YOU UP.
[1:18:52] SOME SOMETHING GOT TO BRING YOU BACK TO
[1:18:54] YOUR RIGHT SENSE INTO YOUR RIGHT MIND.
[1:18:57] HALLELUJAH. IT'S A PRAISE THE LORD. GOD
[1:19:00] PROMISED TO SEND A MESSENGER WITH A WORD
[1:19:05] TO WAKE THE BRIDE UP.
[1:19:08] CAN I TELL YOU CHURCH THAT THE BRIDE WAS
[1:19:11] BROUGHT BACK TO THE WORD OF GOD by
[1:19:14] Malachi 4.
[1:19:17] So the logos, hallelujah, speaks of the
[1:19:20] complete word. It's done.
[1:19:24] But where is it? It's in heaven.
[1:19:28] Hallelujah.
[1:19:29] Hallelujah.
[1:19:31] Amen.
[1:19:32] which comes down to the Rema word,
[1:19:35] brother Mark. Hallelujah. Because you
[1:19:38] see, there's no difference really
[1:19:42] between the logos and the Rema.
[1:19:45] Hallelujah. You see, TO BRING THE WORD
[1:19:48] INTO MANIFESTATION,
[1:19:51] you think when Noah was here,
[1:19:55] Hallelujah. And the Bible said, I think
[1:19:58] there in Genesis 6, hallelujah, when the
[1:20:01] iniquity, hallelujah, of of THE HUMAN
[1:20:04] RACE BECOME SO REJECTFUL THAT GOD SAID,
[1:20:08] I'M GOING TO DESTROY THE WORLD.
[1:20:11] BUT GOD FOUND ONE RIGHTEOUS, WHICH WAS
[1:20:14] NOW, HALLELUJAH. AND WHEN GOD GAVE HIM
[1:20:19] THE WORD, COME ON, CHURCH. WHERE DID
[1:20:22] THAT WORD COMES FROM? IT COMES FROM THE
[1:20:26] LOCUST AND IT BROUGHT HALLELUJAH TO A
[1:20:29] PROPHET TO DO WHAT? TO MAKE THE WORD
[1:20:33] LIVE.
[1:20:35] HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:36] SO THE REMA IS THE LIVING WORD MADE
[1:20:40] EXPRESS.
[1:20:42] HALLELUJAH. Oh my. I wish I could preach
[1:20:45] it by listen. EACH TIME NOW I TAKE THE
[1:20:49] HAMMER AND HE WAS NAILING. IT WAS A PART
[1:20:53] OF THE REVELATION.
[1:20:55] WHY? BECAUSE HE WAS BRINGING INTO
[1:20:57] MATERIALIZATION
[1:20:59] THE perfect thought of God.
[1:21:02] You could look and SEE WHAT WAS IN THE
[1:21:05] LOGOS WHEN THE REM WHEN THE REMA WAS
[1:21:08] MADE EXPRESSED.
[1:21:10] HALLELUJAH. IT BRINGS GOD IN PRESENT
[1:21:14] CONDITION.
[1:21:15] HALLELUJAH. IT TAKE HIM OUT OF HEAVEN
[1:21:18] AND BRING HIM INTO PEAR MANIFESTATION.
[1:21:21] HALLELUJAH. And that is important to the
[1:21:24] bride
[1:21:26] because we realize HALLELUJAH THAT GOD
[1:21:29] CHOSE A CHANNEL TO BRING THE WORD in
[1:21:33] manifestation.
[1:21:35] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And so it's not
[1:21:39] in the heaven church for each
[1:21:41] dispensation,
[1:21:44] each season. What was I'm saying to you
[1:21:47] church? Hallelujah. that which was a
[1:21:50] part of the mind of God came into
[1:21:53] expression.
[1:21:55] There was a time when MOSES WHEN GOD
[1:21:58] TOLD ABRAHAM, I'm going to send a
[1:22:00] deliverer.
[1:22:01] Where was that deliverer? He was in THE
[1:22:04] MIND OF GOD SOMEWHERE.
[1:22:07] BUT THERE COME A SEASON WHEN THE MIND OF
[1:22:10] GOD HAD TO BE MADE MATERIAL,
[1:22:13] A LIVING EXPRESSION. OH my church OF THE
[1:22:18] LIVING GOD. WHERE WERE YOU, BILL? YOU
[1:22:21] WERE PART OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, right
[1:22:23] Bill? You were there. But when it COMES
[1:22:26] TIME TO BRING HAL THE LOGOS H INTO
[1:22:30] MANIFESTATION,
[1:22:32] GOD TOOK THE MARK AND BROUGHT HIM INTO
[1:22:35] MANIFEST. AND HERE HE IS A LIVING
[1:22:37] TESTIMONY THAT THE word of God is living
[1:22:40] and it's real.
[1:22:43] It's real, church. Hallelujah. And so
[1:22:47] the word, every dispensation,
[1:22:51] GOD has hallelujah, an order, a channel
[1:22:56] to bring the logos into expression.
[1:23:01] HALLELUJAH. NO WONDER PAUL WHEN HE
[1:23:03] WRITES ABOUT HIM, Paul said, "God is
[1:23:09] is not a God that I WAS, BUT A GOD THAT
[1:23:14] IS BECAUSE HE CONSTANTLY UNFOLDING
[1:23:18] HIMSELF."
[1:23:19] Unfolding himself. Are you with me,
[1:23:22] church? And so, Brother Brandham looking
[1:23:24] in the Old Testament when he saw Aaron,
[1:23:28] HE SAID AARON WAS A TYPE OF CHRIST. WHY?
[1:23:31] BECAUSE HE CAME FROM THE ETERNAL SOURCE.
[1:23:34] [snorts]
[1:23:35] HALLELUJAH. He just came in a season to
[1:23:39] do what? TO FULFILL THE PORTION OF THE
[1:23:41] WORD CONCERNING HIMSELF.
[1:23:45] OH MY. HALLELUJAH. What about you and I?
[1:23:49] I WAS A PART OF A denominational church.
[1:23:52] I was there. But when it came my time,
[1:23:57] MY SEASON, WHEN THE THOUGHT OF GOD HAD
[1:24:00] TO BE EXPRESSED CONCERNING MYSELF, WHAT
[1:24:04] GOD DID, GOD RECREATE THE CONDITIONS.
[1:24:09] HALLELUJAH. THAT I CAN STEP IN THE
[1:24:11] PERFECT REVELATION of the word.
[1:24:14] HALLELUJAH. OH MY. SO CHURCH, I can
[1:24:18] report TO YOU TONIGHT THAT THE WORD OF
[1:24:21] GOD IS TRULY A LIVING EXPRESSION.
[1:24:25] HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:27] When he said, "I AM THE LORD your
[1:24:30] healer."
[1:24:32] Hallelujah. It's a living expression.
[1:24:36] Hallelujah. WHEN HE SAID, "I AM THE LORD
[1:24:39] YOUR PROVIDER." IT'S A living
[1:24:42] expression.
[1:24:44] Hallelujah.
[1:24:46] And here you are tonight, members of the
[1:24:49] body of Jesus Christ, a part of the
[1:24:52] bride of Christ who had would have told
[1:24:56] you that you would be here. But somehow
[1:25:01] the life that belongs to you SOMEWHERE
[1:25:05] SEARCH YOU out and found you. And when
[1:25:08] it FOUND YOU, IT BROUGHT YOU BACK TO
[1:25:11] CHRIST.
[1:25:12] HALLELUJAH. CHURCH, WE ARE GOING BACK TO
[1:25:15] CHRIST. WE ARE GOING BACK TO THE WORD.
[1:25:19] HALLELUJAH. AND LITTLE BY LITTLE,
[1:25:21] BROTHER MARK, IT'S COMING CLEAR.
[1:25:24] HALLELUJAH. BUT LET CAN I SAY SOMETHING
[1:25:26] TO you tonight? Hallelujah. BECAUSE THIS
[1:25:29] REVELATION ONLY come to the seed.
[1:25:33] Hallelujah. So when you when you read
[1:25:36] Paul's WRITING ABOUT IT, PAUL SAID IN
[1:25:38] HEBREWS 11, BY FAITH MOSES, BY FAITH
[1:25:42] ABRAHAM, BY FAITH SARAH, WHAT WAS HE
[1:25:45] TALKING ABOUT? FAITH IS A REVELATION OF
[1:25:49] THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:25:52] GOD TAKING THE WORD AND BRING IT in
[1:25:55] revelation, in manifestation in its
[1:25:57] season.
[1:25:59] This is your season.
[1:26:01] This is your day.
[1:26:04] This is your message. This is your time
[1:26:07] of the expression of the word of God.
[1:26:10] Hallelujah. And what we need is NOT MORE
[1:26:13] CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. IT'S NOT MORE. OH
[1:26:16] CHURCH, WHAT WE NEED IS MORE OF THE
[1:26:18] revelation of God.
[1:26:21] Hallelujah.
[1:26:23] Amen. that this prodigal son
[1:26:28] have heard
[1:26:30] the word of God.
[1:26:32] Hallelujah.
[1:26:35] Brother Bam said
[1:26:38] God made a promise. God ought to keep
[1:26:40] all that promise.
[1:26:43] If he doesn't keep that promise, then
[1:26:46] he's not God. that if he's keeping that
[1:26:50] promise that only that's the only way he
[1:26:52] can live is by your faith making it
[1:26:56] live. The word of God is a seed.
[1:27:01] Hallelujah.
[1:27:03] And as God gave Abraham the promise and
[1:27:06] we see and we have had thousands of
[1:27:10] years of the experience since Abraham
[1:27:13] but Abraham made
[1:27:16] but Abraham made the promise to or God
[1:27:19] made it to Abraham and to his seed after
[1:27:22] him. He said you understand. I said amen
[1:27:27] to Abraham and conjunction tie the
[1:27:31] sentence together. Abraham and his seed
[1:27:34] after him. It said, "Not his seeds as
[1:27:38] plural, but his seed, the seed of one
[1:27:44] that Abraham believed that was coming by
[1:27:47] faith." Hallelujah. Through that came
[1:27:50] come Isaac. He said, "Through Isaac come
[1:27:53] Christ. Through Christ come you and I."
[1:27:58] Hallelujah. So church, there's really a
[1:28:00] seed and the seed of God. Halle brother.
[1:28:05] So the seed is the word. Hallelujah. Are
[1:28:08] you there with me church? And so if you
[1:28:10] are part of God, you weren't made a seed
[1:28:13] when you receive the NEW BIRTH. YOU ARE
[1:28:16] ALWAYS A PART OF THE LOGOS. HALLELUJAH.
[1:28:19] BUT THERE COME A time when you got to be
[1:28:21] made expressed in your season to do
[1:28:24] what? To bring FORTH THE WORD OF GOD IN
[1:28:26] YOUR DAY. TO BRING FORTH CHRIST IN
[1:28:29] MATERIAL.
[1:28:31] HALLELUJAH. BUT WHAT IS HE DOING CHURCH?
[1:28:33] HE'S TAKING OF THE REALITY OF ANOTHER
[1:28:37] WORLD AND IT'S BRINGING IT INTO A DYING
[1:28:40] WORLD. ARE YOU THERE WITH ME, CHURCH?
[1:28:42] AND WHAT IS HE DOING? HE'S CHANGING YOUR
[1:28:46] EXPERIENCE.
[1:28:47] It's taking YOU BACK TO YOUR ETERNAL
[1:28:50] PATH. HALLELUJAH. WHERE YOU CAN
[1:28:52] RECOGNIZE THAT I AM ALWAYS A SON OF GOD.
[1:28:58] HALLELUJAH.
[1:29:00] Oh my. Hallelujah.
[1:29:04] Hallelujah. So it belongs to the seed
[1:29:07] and the seed is not as many as Abraham
[1:29:11] seeds plural where we could trace his
[1:29:15] physical bloodline.
[1:29:17] Hallelujah. And this is so important if
[1:29:19] we had time enough to get into it
[1:29:21] tonight. But it is important to
[1:29:24] understand that the promise belongs only
[1:29:28] to the seed and it is the seed.
[1:29:32] Hallelujah. Which is Christ which is the
[1:29:35] seed of faith.
[1:29:37] Hallelujah. Listen what I'm saying to
[1:29:39] YOU CHURCH. THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST
[1:29:42] GOT TO HAVE FAITH IN THIS END TIME
[1:29:44] BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT IDENTIFIES her being
[1:29:48] the seed of Christ.
[1:29:50] Hallelujah. Oh my. Hallelujah.
[1:29:54] Hallelujah. My not so much here. I think
[1:29:56] I probably move away from this brother.
[1:29:58] Kind of slowing me down. Hallelujah.
[1:30:01] Hallelujah. But listen what I'm saying
[1:30:02] to you church. Hallelujah. The there
[1:30:05] there's a seed, the seed of God. And
[1:30:08] that seed MUST HAVE FAITH. THAT'S HOW
[1:30:10] YOU ARE IDENTIFIED. HALLELUJAH. WHAT is
[1:30:13] faith? FAITH IS A REVELATION. IT'S A
[1:30:17] REALITY OF THE WORLD. ARE YOU THERE, ME,
[1:30:19] CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. AND SO Jesus asked a
[1:30:23] question. When the son OF MAN COME, WILL
[1:30:26] HE FIND FAITH? WILL HE FIND PEOPLE
[1:30:29] BELIEVING THE WORD OF GOD? BROTHER, LET
[1:30:32] ME explain all of that. BROTHER SAID WE
[1:30:35] ARE WE ARE LIKE A TRIUNAL BEING. WE HAVE
[1:30:38] BODY, SPIRIT AND SOUL. HALLELUJAH. And
[1:30:42] soul in your soul. Hallelujah. Is where
[1:30:46] brother said it's doubt
[1:30:49] or faith belief or unbelief
[1:30:53] where in your soul. HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE
[1:30:57] NOW WHEN YOUR SOUL COMES ALIVE TO THE
[1:31:00] WORD OF GOD, WHAT IT DOES? HALLELUJAH.
[1:31:04] Oh my. Oh my. This is what I'm saying to
[1:31:07] you church. WITH YOUR SOUL COME ALIVE TO
[1:31:09] THE WORD OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. IN YOUR
[1:31:12] SOUL YOU BECOME AWAKEN.
[1:31:14] YOU BEAR ME CHURCH. YOU SEE BROTHER SAID
[1:31:18] YOUR SOUL WAS MADE NOT TO CONTACT the
[1:31:21] earthly. BUT IT WAS MADE TO CONTACT THE
[1:31:24] SUPERNATURAL.
[1:31:26] IT WAS MADE TO HALLELUJAH. TO CONTACT
[1:31:29] HAL THE MIND OF CHRIST.
[1:31:32] ARE YOU THERE CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. AND SO
[1:31:35] WITHIN your soul, WHEN YOUR SOUL COMES
[1:31:38] ALIVE, CAN I USE AN ILLUSTRATION for you
[1:31:41] to understand? Hallelujah. THE BIBLE
[1:31:43] SAID FAITH COMETH BY HEARING AND HEARING
[1:31:48] THE WORD. HALLELUJAH. WHERE IS FAITH?
[1:31:51] HERE IS FAITH. YOUR SOUL IS FAITH. AND
[1:31:56] YOUR SOUL COMES ALIVE WHEN IT HEARS THE
[1:31:59] WORD. ARE YOU THERE MY CHURCH? AND SO
[1:32:02] WITHOUT THE WORD, HALLELUJAH, YOUR SOUL
[1:32:06] WILL NOT BE MADE ALIVE.
[1:32:08] But when faith is hankered, WHAT IT
[1:32:11] DOES, it open up THE TREASURES OF
[1:32:15] HEAVEN. ARE YOU THERE, MY CHURCH? WHAT
[1:32:18] GOD IS DOING, GOD IS WAKING up your
[1:32:21] faith. HALLELUJAH. UNVEILING MORE OF THE
[1:32:25] WORD. AND THE MORE the word unveil, the
[1:32:29] more of the realities of God unveil,
[1:32:33] the more it changes your experience. The
[1:32:36] more in YOUR HEART IT BECOMES so real.
[1:32:39] Oh my, it become so real. Until it
[1:32:43] become real substance.
[1:32:45] Are you me church? BROTHER SAID, PAUL
[1:32:48] SAID, HALLELUJAH, faith is a substance.
[1:32:53] ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH? WHAT TYPE OF
[1:32:55] SUBSTANCE IT IS? HALLELUJAH. It's a real
[1:32:58] substance. Hallelujah. That allows you
[1:33:03] contacting the supernatural things of
[1:33:05] God. And so the seed of God must have
[1:33:09] faith.
[1:33:12] How else will you
[1:33:15] receive the things of God?
[1:33:19] They're already there, brother Mark.
[1:33:21] It's already over.
[1:33:23] It's finished. It's done. But how will
[1:33:27] you get it? You got to have faith.
[1:33:31] So your soul got to be made alive to the
[1:33:33] word.
[1:33:35] Yeah. You see what I'm saying?
[1:33:37] Hallelujah. So there got to come a time
[1:33:41] here. We are hang between a balance. Do
[1:33:43] I believe this? Do I do? Because here in
[1:33:47] this mortal life, we're compounded by
[1:33:50] the real subst circumstances of this
[1:33:52] mortal life. But in our soul, our soul
[1:33:57] is made alive by the word of God. Are
[1:34:00] you there, church? AND SO WHEN THE SOUL
[1:34:03] BECOMES ALIVE BY THE WORD OF GOD, it
[1:34:06] create, IT GIVES YOU THAT REALITY
[1:34:08] EXPERIENCE.
[1:34:09] HALLELUJAH. And so what we need, church,
[1:34:13] is to get out of this worldly atmosphere
[1:34:17] and TO SHUT AWAY WITH GOD AND AND TO
[1:34:20] EXHAUST THE THE THE THE SPLENDERS OF
[1:34:24] HEAVEN. ARE YOU THERE, MY CHURCH? AND
[1:34:26] AND TO PULL ON THE RESOURCES OF God
[1:34:30] because it's already done. It's already
[1:34:31] there.
[1:34:34] Hallelujah.
[1:34:36] But God uses that to identify
[1:34:41] the seed.
[1:34:44] If you are Christ seed, you must have
[1:34:46] faith.
[1:34:49] You see, one of the challenge that we
[1:34:51] are confronted with today is
[1:34:55] there's so much that is before us.
[1:34:59] We have never seen another time like
[1:35:01] this one.
[1:35:04] so many destruction. There's so many
[1:35:07] disturbances.
[1:35:10] There's so many struggles and troubles
[1:35:12] and hallelujah. And brother said, Bible
[1:35:16] said it's one of the darkest time the
[1:35:19] world has ever seen.
[1:35:23] But the Bible said, "But there shall be
[1:35:25] light in the heathen time."
[1:35:29] There got to be a people to bring that
[1:35:31] light to bring a life.
[1:35:35] Hallelujah. That is beyond this mortal
[1:35:37] life.
[1:35:39] That is what identify the seed of God
[1:35:43] their fate.
[1:35:45] And the Bible said and we will overcome
[1:35:48] this world
[1:35:50] by our faith.
[1:35:53] We will overcome it by the our faith.
[1:35:57] And so the seed of God Christ if he's
[1:36:00] there hallelujah he identify himself
[1:36:04] being the seed by faith
[1:36:07] that's what distinguish hallelujah I say
[1:36:10] this in closing quickly you see when
[1:36:13] Jesus came brother Mark
[1:36:17] Hallelujah you know brotherham spoke of
[1:36:19] he said that there were three races of
[1:36:22] people that were here
[1:36:25] the three sons of Nah
[1:36:28] that represents the the Jews, the
[1:36:31] Gentile and the Samaritans.
[1:36:34] And we saw there
[1:36:39] when he came to his own, he went to the
[1:36:43] Jews
[1:36:45] and
[1:36:47] in his experience with the Jews, even
[1:36:50] with his own disciples,
[1:36:54] he constantly saying to them, "Oh, of
[1:36:56] little faith. Oh, he of little faith.
[1:37:01] Right.
[1:37:04] But there was a time
[1:37:08] when a centurion came to him.
[1:37:12] Oh my.
[1:37:15] Which was a gentile.
[1:37:18] You hear what I'm saying to you? I'm I'm
[1:37:19] closing.
[1:37:21] A gentile came to him. a centuran
[1:37:27] and the Bible said in St. uh Matthew 8
[1:37:30] and verse 8, the centurans answered and
[1:37:32] said, "Lord, I'm not worthy
[1:37:36] that thou should have come should come
[1:37:39] under my roof, but speak
[1:37:43] the word, and my servant shall be
[1:37:46] healed.
[1:37:49] For I am a man under authority,
[1:37:53] having soldiers under me." And I say to
[1:37:57] to this man, "Go," and he goeth, and
[1:38:00] another, "Come," and he cometh. And to
[1:38:04] my servant, "Do this," and he doeth it.
[1:38:09] And when Jesus heard it, he marveled
[1:38:17] and said to them that followed, "Verily,
[1:38:21] I say unto you, I have not found so
[1:38:25] great faith
[1:38:28] not in Israel."
[1:38:32] Oh my, I just want to preach.
[1:38:36] This what I'm saying, church.
[1:38:38] Hallelujah.
[1:38:40] When it comes on to the Gentiles,
[1:38:44] Hallelujah.
[1:38:45] There is SOMETHING THAT IS ORDAINED FOR
[1:38:49] YOU.
[1:38:51] HALLELUJAH.
[1:38:53] THAT GOD WILL RECOGNIZE your fate.
[1:38:58] HALLELUJAH. GOD will accept your fate.
[1:39:02] NOT THAT HE DIDN'T ACCEPT the faith that
[1:39:04] was in Israel,
[1:39:06] BUT THERE'S ALWAYS THIS KIND OF wear and
[1:39:09] tear and believing, BUT HERE'S A MAN, a
[1:39:13] gentile,
[1:39:15] oh my, hallelujah,
[1:39:18] WHO SAID, "LORD,
[1:39:20] HALLELUJAH. Speed the word
[1:39:23] and I believe it."
[1:39:26] But what was it? What was happening,
[1:39:28] church? He said, "THE MYSTERY OF THE
[1:39:32] WORD points to a seed that is to come,
[1:39:37] a seed THAT WILL WALK BY FAITH, THAT
[1:39:41] WILL LIVE BY FAITH, THAT WILL TAKE THE
[1:39:44] THINGS OF GOD BY FAITH."
[1:39:47] HALLELUJAH.
[1:39:49] Oh my. Hear the story
[1:39:52] with the woman of Canaan. Hallelujah.
[1:39:55] St. Matthew 15 and verse 22. And behold,
[1:40:00] a woman of Canaan, this was a gentile
[1:40:03] woman, came out of the same course, and
[1:40:07] cried unto him, saying, "Have mercy on
[1:40:11] me, oh Lord, thou son of David." You
[1:40:14] know what brother Benham said? She did
[1:40:16] not have any claims on him, a son of
[1:40:19] David.
[1:40:21] He said, she said, "MY DAUGHTER IS GRIEF
[1:40:24] WITH THE DEVIL.
[1:40:26] But he answered her not a world. Why?
[1:40:29] Because she didn't approach the right
[1:40:31] way.
[1:40:33] But what was happened?
[1:40:36] And his disciples came besought him,
[1:40:38] saying, "Send her away, for she cried
[1:40:42] after us. But he answered and said, I am
[1:40:46] not sent but unto the lost sheep of the
[1:40:49] house of Israel." Then came she and
[1:40:52] worship the worship him saying Lord. Oh
[1:40:57] my.
[1:40:58] Hallelujah. That's it.
[1:41:02] HALLELUJAH. WHEN SHE SAID LORD,
[1:41:05] HALLELUJAH, SHE BRING HIM RIGHT BACK TO
[1:41:07] THE logos
[1:41:09] to the Christ of who he is. He had to
[1:41:12] respond to it.
[1:41:15] Oh my. Hallelujah.
[1:41:19] But he answered and said, "It is not
[1:41:21] made to take the children's bread and to
[1:41:24] cause it to dogs." And she said, "True,
[1:41:27] Lord, yet the dogs eat of the crumbs
[1:41:31] that fall from the master's table." Then
[1:41:34] Jesus answered and said unto her, "Oh
[1:41:36] woman, great is thy fate. Be unto thee,
[1:41:40] even as thou wilt." And her daughter was
[1:41:43] made whole from that very hour. Oh my.
[1:41:47] Are you there with me, CHURCH?
[1:41:49] HALLELUJAH. THERE'S SOMETHING about you
[1:41:51] Gentiles.
[1:41:53] HALLELUJAH. THAT GOD HAVE RESPECT TO
[1:41:56] YOUR FAITH. WHY? BECAUSE YOU SEE,
[1:41:58] BROTHER MARK, THERE GOT TO COME A
[1:42:00] GENTILE CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. THAT DOES
[1:42:04] NOT JUST TAKE THE WORK OF THE WORD, BUT
[1:42:07] THE FAITH OF THE WORD. ARE YOU THERE AT
[1:42:09] THE CHURCH? BUT WHERE WAS SHE?
[1:42:12] HALLELUJAH. So when Jesus was here, HE
[1:42:15] WALKED AMONG THE THE JEWS AND among the
[1:42:17] Samaritans.
[1:42:19] But scriptures got to be fulfilled.
[1:42:23] There got to come a TIME WHEN THE
[1:42:25] GENTILE CHURCH GOT TO APPROACH. OH MY.
[1:42:29] GOT TO COME BACK TO THE WORLD. LISTEN
[1:42:31] WHAT I'm saying to you church.
[1:42:33] Hallelujah. FOR ALL OF THIS WAS
[1:42:35] PREDESTINATED.
[1:42:37] No one KNEW THAT THERE WAS A GENTILE
[1:42:40] CHURCH WHO WAS A PART OF THE BLESSING.
[1:42:43] NO ONE KNEW THAT YOUR NAMES WERE THERE.
[1:42:46] ARE YOU THERE, MY CHURCH? BUT THERE
[1:42:48] COMES A TIME, HALLELUJAH, WHEN YOU COME
[1:42:52] IN THE PRESENCE OF HEARING THE WORD.
[1:42:54] HALLELUJAH. AND THE GENTILE STARTS
[1:42:56] HAVING FAITH.
[1:42:58] Oh my. What it does? It changes the
[1:43:02] hands of God because he had to get to
[1:43:05] that church. He got to get to that
[1:43:08] woman. HE GOT TO GET TO THAT GENTILE. SO
[1:43:12] WHEN THE GENTILE they were coming I'll
[1:43:15] read this and then we close off in St.
[1:43:19] John 12 and verse 20. These are when the
[1:43:22] Greeks went to him and there were
[1:43:26] certain Greek among them that came to
[1:43:29] came up to worship at it at the feast.
[1:43:33] The same came therefore to Philillip
[1:43:35] which was as the seder of Galilee and
[1:43:39] desire him says sir we would see Jesus
[1:43:43] and Philillip came come it and tell it
[1:43:46] and again
[1:43:48] Philillip tell Jesus and Jesus answer
[1:43:51] them saying the hour is come
[1:43:56] OH MY WHY BECAUSE NOW THE GENTILES
[1:44:00] hallelujah is now coming to him. AND
[1:44:04] JESUS NOW DECLARING THE hour is come.
[1:44:08] What is what is he talking ABOUT CHURCH?
[1:44:10] THERE GOT TO BE AN HOUR, A TIME WHEN THE
[1:44:14] THINGS OF GOD IS MADE MANIFESTED. YOU
[1:44:17] SEE, HE CAME AMONG THE JEWS AND HE DID
[1:44:19] ALL THE MIRACLES. HALLELUJAH. BUT
[1:44:22] LISTEN, BUT IT WAS MORE OF WORKS AND AND
[1:44:25] AND other things. But when it come TO
[1:44:28] THE GENTILE, IT was faith. ARE YOU THERE
[1:44:31] ME CHURCH? HALLELUJAH. THAT WOULD
[1:44:33] IDENTIFY THE SEED THAT there's coming a
[1:44:36] church. Hallelujah. That will take the
[1:44:39] word of God by faith. Hallelujah. And so
[1:44:44] in closing, Paul when he was sent to the
[1:44:49] Gentile, he was commissioned by God to
[1:44:54] get that church, that Gentile church.
[1:44:57] Hallelujah. That nobody knew about.
[1:45:01] Hallelujah. But what God was doing,
[1:45:03] church, we're coming down now. What God
[1:45:06] was doing, there got to come a time when
[1:45:09] the people rise. Hallelujah. in faith,
[1:45:12] hallelujah, to take the things of God,
[1:45:15] to live by the things of God, to
[1:45:18] experience the things of God, to know
[1:45:20] the things of God. Hallelujah. But what
[1:45:23] GOD WAS DOING, HAL, GOD WAS NOT
[1:45:26] RECOGNIZING THAT THERE IS A CHURCH,
[1:45:29] HALLELUJAH, THAT HALLELUJAH, THE THINGS
[1:45:31] OF GOD, THE INVISIBLE THINGS, THE
[1:45:33] SUPERNATURAL THING IS COMING AGAIN.
[1:45:37] ARE YOU CHURCH? WHY ARE YOU HERE?
[1:45:41] Why are you here?
[1:45:44] Are you here to warm the benches? No.
[1:45:48] You're specially called to make the word
[1:45:51] of God live.
[1:45:54] And guess what? And you are
[1:45:56] predestinated to do so.
[1:46:00] You're specially designated.
[1:46:03] Hallelujah. So what is it? Hallelujah.
[1:46:06] And so we saw the first thing he did,
[1:46:09] brother Mark,
[1:46:10] to get this GENTILE CHURCH. WHAT HE DID?
[1:46:13] He sent forth a prophet to do what? To
[1:46:16] get the seed.
[1:46:19] Paul was a prophet.
[1:46:21] Hallelujah. AND A PROPHET BROUGHT FORTH
[1:46:23] THE WORD, THE SEED.
[1:46:26] HALLELUJAH. Church of the living God,
[1:46:29] IT'S ALL ABOUT THE SEED.
[1:46:32] THE FIRST PAUL STARTED with seed.
[1:46:36] THE LAST BROTHER HAVE TO GO BACK TO
[1:46:38] SEED.
[1:46:40] HALLELUJAH. IT GOT TO GO BACK TO SEED.
[1:46:42] ARE YOU THERE ME CHURCH? BECAUSE IT IS
[1:46:45] THROUGH THE seed the revelation will
[1:46:47] come.
[1:46:49] THE SEED WILL BRING GOD IN FLESH AGAIN.
[1:46:54] The seed WILL TAKE THE SUPERNATURAL
[1:46:56] THINGS OF GOD AND MADE THEM BECOMES a
[1:46:59] natural.
[1:47:01] Hallelujah.
[1:47:03] So I'm preaching to you tonight that you
[1:47:06] will come to yourself.
[1:47:10] I must come back to myself
[1:47:14] in my conscious state of mind to
[1:47:17] recognize
[1:47:18] who I am.
[1:47:22] And when the bride recognizes who she is
[1:47:24] for the market and that she's called to
[1:47:27] do the greater works,
[1:47:29] the Bible said the gates of hell can't
[1:47:32] prevail because what you're doing,
[1:47:35] you're pulling on the eternal logos, the
[1:47:38] eternal resources of God.
[1:47:41] I said the last time while we were while
[1:47:43] I was here,
[1:47:46] you haven't seen anything yet.
[1:47:50] The bride is coming in position.
[1:47:54] She hears the word.
[1:47:56] Hallelujah.
[1:47:59] The word is not somewhere in heaven to
[1:48:01] be brought down.
[1:48:03] The word is nye
[1:48:06] even in thy mouth.
[1:48:09] Hallelujah. Where's the word tonight,
[1:48:12] church? It's in your heart. It's a
[1:48:15] reality.
[1:48:17] Hallelujah. And she's being awakened to
[1:48:19] this reality. She's seeing and she's
[1:48:22] believing and she's experiencing
[1:48:24] more and more of the supernatural.
[1:48:28] Hallelujah. It's not to raise a dead or
[1:48:30] no, no, no. It's to recognize who you
[1:48:32] are.
[1:48:34] It's about it's a work of faith. is to
[1:48:37] bring your faith to a to to a position
[1:48:39] where it can naturally pull the things
[1:48:41] of God and manifest them
[1:48:44] naturally. Brother Mark to make it live
[1:48:48] live.
[1:48:51] Hallelujah.
[1:48:52] Hallelujah.
[1:48:54] Can I take about two more minutes?
[1:48:57] Hallelujah. We are called TO MAKE THE
[1:49:00] WORLD LIVE. Live how? in a body in the
[1:49:04] MIDST OF THIS DYING WORLD. HALLELUJAH.
