won't be singing amen you know and uh by grace i'll try not to preach we'll try to leave that to our brother jonathan amen and we welcome our our brother and just to let you know that uh concerning brother jonathan let you know that our brother has become as it were here we recognize him as an assistant pastor amen so we appreciate his ministry amen the ministry that the lord has sent among us amen through our brother so be in prayer for brother jonathan comes to minister the word this morning and also uh just to oh yes to welcome as a sister delphine and uh ellen oh and sister allen is there a friend come with her so i'm from tanzania amen truly they're from all over the world amen our brothers here from africa our brother from india my sister from tanzania said the lord bless you say amen so the lord has blessed us here amen by grace and of course again uh we're we're newfoundlanders not necessarily canadians people recognize us first as newfoundlanders and so on that's the truth even you call across canada that the new philanthropies be different from all of the other provinces and of course we're we're about the only problem with its own national anthem and that we can sing god guard the god guard the newfound land and so on so we thank the lord for that amen and we thank the lord that down through the years he's always in all his revivals they'll always come to newfoundland oh yes when it comes to the the old-fashioned method is the old-fashioned salvation army and the old-fashioned pentecostals oh yeah ended up here in newfoundland or started a new plan somewhere amen started somewhere else came newflin went somewhere else so i thank the lord for that hallelujah and of course also i have had an email a while ago where that brethren were asking me if brother branham the problem of god was in nova scotia or was he in prince of wood island or not the rest of london but uh new brunswick and because they were just wondering if there was something that they could get or maybe something that was recorded there and i said no as far as i know he wasn't in new brunswick he wasn't in nova scotia unless maybe a flight had landed there just just go pass over it but i said he did stop in newfoundland that was in gander and i was in the early 1950s and they had to stop here because the plane ran out of fuel and the problem of god said he to the to the ones that were on the plane and i guess some were complaining and he said don't complain because they were going from europe or asia to supposed to go on to new york city somewhere he said don't complain he said if it wasn't for the lord he said we'd be out there in the in the ocean amen because he said we've been going a half hour he said with an empty tank amen that's the truth so so they landed in gander to get more fuel and the problem of god of course did get off the plane as well and go into the airport in gander and as i said i was at the time i was just a young boy maybe maybe five years old living 25 miles east of gander that's where i was born and raised so i i trust that that the presence of a prophet that through through the presence of a prophet lord that the that the lord blessed us by grace amen so we thank the lord of course again the way that i was raised and then i think the lord ordained it predestinated it and i was raised as an old-fashioned salvation army person going to the salvation army sunday morning sunday afternoon for sunday school sunday night for the evening service oh yeah then they had two two more services during the week uh maybe one was called a soldiers meeting where they get together and sing and praise and just christians just the believers so and i thank god for that influence in my life amen and god ordained it no doubt so thank the lord so lord bless us and uh we welcome again of course our brother ellie back with us again so the lord bless you brother it's good to have you amen and of course his brother joshua amen and joshua's here usually most every service our brother joshua's here and we trust we'll see more and more of brother ali amen and of course his family being in central they do come here once in a while and visit us and worship with us so the lord blessed them so just to ask you to keep all the saints of god in prayer and air and across the island and to remember our brother jonathan in prayer and just to let you know again that he will be an assistant pastor and he will be there to of course to help the pastor and with the authority to do you know what what sometimes what the pastor does he can do it now amen because we have also registered him with the government amen as a clergy heir in disassembly by the grace of god so god bless again as i said brother johnson was under the ministry here for i guess maybe 20 years and he was married here and uh our sister salinas yeah that was their first child and i dedicated her that's many many many years ago amen so oh yeah don't mean to emphasize that she's getting older amen yeah but again like i said it's hard for me to believe that i came here and ministered some years ago and some of these brethren here that are white here they they weren't even married then and but then they ended up with children and i dedicated that was those children and now i'm dedicating their grandchildren so it's amazing it's hard for me to believe that i'm i'm an old man amen but again we thank the lord that he he said a few other three score years and ten a few more if by reason of strength amen and they shall be filled as you have pain and sorrow so we're praying god by grace of our lord jesus christ to take us through it amen so the lord blesses and again god bless our sister delphine and sister ellen amen glad to have you there and again uh all the saints of god that have come for the hearing of the word i pray that that you're praying for brother jonathan and praying by grace amen that you will have the the right spirit and the right attitude to receive the word amen to receive what god is going to going to minister for you as an individual oh yeah oh we think he's going to minister just preach to all of us and what all he says is for all of us well there might be something that god will god will anoint him to say amen that'll be for individuals there so let's keep the right attitude and the right spirit and be in prayer again for those across the island and also uh it's been especially since the covet issues has been going on it's been very rare that we've had communion so let's be in prayer because it's been on my heart for a while to have communion again and of course because people didn't want to drink out of the same glass and i'm not sure but maybe last time we we used the small cups here and so we'll see as the lord leads us to have communion and for washing again by grace so the lord bless us amen and keep please i pray in the name of jesus stay sincere we're in the last days and we need to be on our guard because jesus warned us when the son of man comes will he find faith on the earth it's going to be that bad when it comes to just religion not being spiritual religious yes and and just unbelievers and so on but when it comes to absolute true christian believers they're going to get less and less and less amen they said will he find faith and we know faith is the revelation of the word of god in your heart amen what god wants you to have what god wants you to see what god wants you to believe in these last days as we said the the brother of god from it began with faith and the foundation is faith amen with with the with with paul that comes right on up through iranians martin columba luther wesley elijah in these last days what was god doing god giving him the message of the word that would give them the faith that they needed amen they needed the faith of justification they needed the faith of sanctification through luther wesley and of course in pentecost the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit but brother see more and more of god in in in the body more and more of god in the bride and as i said god many are called but they're not all lost but few are chosen for the bride and i trust we are the bride by the grace of god so brother and god gave them their faith for justification sanctification and the pentecostals the baptism of the holy ghost the gifts of the spirit but he's given us a message of the word to give us the faith for the resurrection and the rapture to get out of here by the grace of god so the lord bless us let's be be there to receive the word and that is going to give us more and more faith for the rapture faith for the resurrection faith to look up amen by the grace of god because he said he warned us when you see this this and this and this look up amen why because it's signs of the end grace to us amen so be in prayer for one another by the grace of god so we're going to turn to our brother jonathan and let's stand and we're going to sing all things are possible only believe amen praise the name of the lord amen [Music] oh [Music] yes amen yes even the resurrection in the rapture jesus is here [Music] are possible jesus is here jesus is here jesus is here all things are possible thank you jesus lord i believe [Music] lord believe all things are possible [Music] lord i believe lord i believe [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] lord jesus we just bow our heads this morning lord and we want to confess that we believe lord that we're here to not only hear your word or but we're here to become doers of your word or that we would take it on our lips that we would take it into our lives into our hearts lord that it would not just be a a culture lord or a thought or an ideology lord but that it would be life and life abundant within each one of us lord life so abundant lord that when we go around others would see it and be able to take it and taste it and benefit from it lord that they will be drawn to you through the life of the word that they see in every one of our lives so lord we're here to be changed lord drawn closer to you lord more connected to christ this morning lord we just surrender ourselves to you lord may you take this vessel lord may you lord not only touch me to speak lord but touch lord the congregation to hear lord to hear with years of faith lord to take it into their lives lord that it would have an effect in them we pray lord forgive us forgive me where we fall short lord lord lift us up to the standard of your word we pray in your name we ask it this morning amen and amen amen thank you musicians that'll be it this morning turn if you will to ephesians chapter 4 this morning amen good to have our visitors amongst us amen good to have each one that's here i want to pass on greetings of course uh we traveled out to central and then to the west coast and so we stayed with brother albert and sister freda snow and we'd never met them before as far as i know as in i wasn't old enough to really remember that so we stayed with them they put us up for three different nights complete strangers so praise the lord for that we enjoyed our time and fellowship with them we also got to spend about five hours with brother hank and sister verna and uh we spent about the same amount of time brother gordon's sister eileen and we went out to the west coast and spent uh part of two evenings with brother dog and sister beverly had a good time with them and then joe was able to spend some time with brother and sister colombo and brother ivan as well so each one passed on their greetings their thanks to the church um you know expressed their hope to come in if we have some special meetings sometime soon so definitely remember them in prayer it's a sticky situation out there it's a tough thing being out there more or less alone a lot of them and uh certainly put a burden on my heart to remember them and and the different things that are going on out there amen i mean i just had a testimony this morning you can take your seats if you will just a brief testimony before we uh set out on our trip i uh i bought a new set of tires for the van because we were running on our old winters and they were getting really noisy i didn't want to do a couple thousand kilometers on them so i had them change it over and uh when i did my wife drove the van back and she says there's a sound coming from the front right corner and we kind of heard it before but you know just figured it was the old tires well it was worse with the new tires and so we knew there was a problem so um i know what a bad bearing sounds like and we had a bad bearing on the front right corner as best i could tell and it sounded like we had a small cessna flying next to our van on a regular basis and brother matt knows what a bad bearing sounds like it sounds kind of low and and grumbly a bit and then the worse it gets then it gets a high-pitched wine and these different things and so we were driving we'd come down into manuals and i mean just this one you know just in the in the right corner and i said well we can't fix it we don't have time to fix it you know it was we're leaving we're leaving over the weekend none of the shops are open over the weekend it's not something you change out in just an hour type thing so so i said well we're just going to pray that the lord will keep it until we get back 2000 kilometers on a bad bearing it's not the best idea but it was just kind of making the noises you know so i figured we'd be okay so we drove off and and it was pretty loud for the first little bit and and it got loud and it was staying there and i was just you know turn the music up a little louder and say lord we're trusting you type thing and it was funny we were in uh in bishops falls and we were having some fellowship there with brother gord and sister eileen and and uh and they were talking about you know how brother branham had prayed for a brother's car he had an old studebaker and he had an issue with him brother brown got out and he prayed for it he said brother don't worry about it it's taken care of that brother never had an issue with that with that car in that area again you know so so i told him about the wheel bearing i said i i guess i didn't quite pray the right way i said i just asked for him to take take it all the way back home so i could get it fixed there you know so anyways we're coming in to manuals and and we're coming down the hill and right at that 80 kilometer an hour speed is where that that bearing was really loud and my wife said does it does it sound quieter and i said it does i said it you know i'm not really sure so i i set up an appointment i already set up an appointment on tuesday for for to take it to the shop and and so i called i hadn't heard anything from them all day on tuesday and i'd driven around the previous day trying to get this noise and just trying to make sure you know it's still there but it was a rainy day it was a windy day and you know you just can't can't pin it down you know so i said well it was definitely there you know i had a bad bearing on my acura i know what it sounds like it was definitely there it's you know whatever maybe it's in a perfect storm right there and it's going to fall apart tomorrow type thing so that's what's going on anyways the so i called him i said you know it's john i dropped my van off have you fixed the bearing he says i've taken that van out three times he says and i can't hear anything he says all i can hear is just a little bit of tire noise he said there's no problem with your bearings so so i prayed for him to take care of it to bring it back and as far as i can tell he healed the bearing so brother matt i'll tell you when a bearing goes bad it doesn't come back there's no such thing so that's what i'm going to testify to i'm going to say the wheel bearing's fixed the fan's only got 50 000 kilometers it shouldn't have bad bearings at this point but it was definitely bad it was very annoying and anyways it's not anymore so i say praise the lord amen he can heal our bodies he can heal our vans he can feel our homes he can do all sorts of things for us if we ask him and then all right amen if you'll just stand together and we'll we'll read in ephesians 4. sister amber certainly enjoyed your special always enjoy it every time i've noticed that uh we've had a few more specials of late and you know as different ones get more time and babies grow up older and you know it gives you a little more time to do these things it's really wonderful and i know the church is blessed by it amen amen ephesians 4 sorry for the late start ephesians 4 13 says till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the stat measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the slate of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lay and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplyeth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love amen god that is blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated and then we're going to continue our series as you might have guessed on the overcomers and uh last time we spoke on gracious gifts if you remember and we spoke on the five-fold ministry and the placing of them and the purpose of them and what a what a real one looks like and the effect it has on the people amen and now we want to we want to move into our part of this you know in terms of not just the the fivefold ministry but the laity itself and and these different things so today i want to take a title of growing into effectiveness and and this is pre-gifts this is not about gifts this is getting to the place where god can use your gift amen but we want to grow into the place where we are effective in the kingdom of god amen so let's start right back in verse 13 and this is you remember from the last service maybe if you don't is the long term this is the end effect of the fivefold ministry and it says and it says that he gave prophets and apostles and these different things until we all come we all come right not just one or two but every single one of the members of the bride of christ comes in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man and unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ now let me stop there and say this you can't do this on your own i mean this is not something that the bride can make happen amen this is where eve got into trouble was god said be fruitful and multiply and eve sat there and said god's word said that i'm supposed to be fruitful and multiply and she didn't know how to do it and so what happened was satan came in and he pointed you to the word and he says you don't have a clue how to do it but guess what i know how to do it i'm going to show you how you can bring the word of god to pass in your life and it over time what did he do he seduced her by what pointing her to the word and her inability to bring it to the effect that god said it would have and he said let me help you get there amen we cannot make a rapture happen on our own and if you try and do it you're going to get messed up and you're going to mess up those that are around you amen but eve sat there and over time he seduced her into this idea that she could make it happen on her own and what happened was she brought ruin and destruction to the entire world amen what happened she said god told me to do it and then she took his thought and injected it into her and all of a sudden she's she's brought destruction on all of us amen this is not something that we can do amen we've got to stop striving and we've got to start surrendering amen we've got to be able to get quiet we've got to be able to get still we've got to be able to say lord what would you have for me to do as opposed to i'm going to go out and i see this and this and this and i'm just going to do it do it do it do it do it and all of a sudden it's going to work out amen that is not what we're here to do as mature sons and daughters of god we're here to be led not here to drive the bus if i can put it that way amen i read this quote in the last service but i believe it sets the tone where we're going for the next couple of services so i wanted to read it again and it says this now god said i sent them the word and eve just walked right over the top of it and disbelieved it i made it manifest and crucified it in christ i'm just getting tired he says i'm coming myself so here he come god in you from god above us the pillar of fire god with us in jesus christ now god in us the holy spirit what is it he says the same word the same god amen no more trusting in anything else god come himself this was a man-sized job so he brought it on down and he came down himself he says now they won't have to do nothing about it to do what achieve the purpose and plan of god to be restored back to their eating condition he says they won't have to do nothing about it just let them surrender to me and i'll walk in them i'll talk in them i'll speak in them and i'll work in them oh my that's it i'll do the work just let them humble themselves just let them empty up i'll beat my enemy out there through them that's it you can't do it yourself now you're not a match for him you're not a match for the enemy you're not a match for satan you're not a match for the world if you try and do it on your own but if you'll just let god do it get the word in you then it'll all be taken care of amen they won't have anything to do with it when we stand on the other side in glory it will not be because of anything that i did it will not because of anything you did but it will be the elect grace of god that took us and brought us through all of these things and gave us what we have need of to overcome in the time and season and age that we are in amen let me put it this way we can only hinder god with what we have you cannot help god with what you have you can only hinder god with what you have because what you have is cursed amen it's been cursed since satan caused the fall with eve and until we go back into a rapture everything that we have is cursed that is in our bodies amen the only thing that we take is our soul and brother brown says the only thing you take is what your character because your character is the holy spirit that has been placed inside of you that sealed you to the day of your redemption so all that goes is your soul your body stays here your thoughts stays here your spirit your general spirit your attitude your memories all these things they stay here because they're cursed but yet that's the only thing we can add to god and let me put it this way he thinks so little of it that he leaves it behind when he takes us so we can only hinder him with what we have to offer but what we can bring to him is what a surrendered heart a surrendered soul is surrendered life and then he can work through that to do something for the kingdom of god amen he can help you through you but it's not going to use you it's going to be the holy spirit within you surrender to the word that he is bringing to the age amen paul says it this way he says that we henceforth be no more children toss to and fro amen in other words we're going to be mature and we're not going to be moved around by the things that are happening that are changing around us amen society is changing religion's changing politics are changing the financial system is changing the way they raise kids is changing who works and who doesn't work is changing everything in the world is changing but he says we will be anchored in these times amen we won't be moved to and fro based on situations based on circumstances amen nor will we be carried about by every wind of doctrine or by the slate of men amen so we're going to have discernment that's based on the word and we won't be moved around by the latest and greatest ideas remember we'll take it from genesis to revelation through the word to make sure that it lines up before we step out and start resting our souls on such a thing amen sometimes it's difficult for us because something new comes across the pulp and we say i've never heard that before that's probably wrong it's not true because what god is ever opening and revealing his word to us he's drawing us to a higher plane so there are going to be things come over the pulpit at times that you've never heard before but the holy spirit within you will cause you to draw it from genesis to revelation to say does that line up with the word of god and if it does you should be able to say yea and amen to it and add it to your life and it will draw you to a higher level in your walk in christ amen amen so no more by the slate of men so will we not we will not be influenced by charisma by gifts amen but we will be holding fast to what the simplicity of the word of god and cunning craftiness whereby they lay in wait to deceive so will not be tricked as eve was amen the bride will stand all the way through she'll stand the test of the age and she'll take a rapture because of it but rather speaking the truth and love we may grow up into him amen so there's a growing up process there's a maturing process and a development in this process we do not start as mature but we finish as mature amen that's something to remember when you're failing when you're struggling when you're dealing with things is that you do not get the holy ghost and automatically become an adult amen you are still a child a babe in christ paul talks about it in the different ones he says i tried i want to teach you big things i want to take you to a higher level but you're still babies what babies in christ but still babies nonetheless you've got to mature before we can start getting into certain things brother branham dealt with it you know they said brother branham how when are you going to get into the greater things he says well how can i teach pentecostal babies supernatural things what you don't have the a b's and c's done and you want to do algebra it's not going to happen amen amen but rather for us now we are speaking the truth in love we may grow up into him in all things in all things that's the end the end goal here is that in all things we are in christ amen that is surrendered to christ that it matches the standard of christ which is the word amen paul's saying there's a maturing process and you've got to be able to go through that process before you can get to the end result which is a stature of a perfect man in christ this is a maturing process as brother joe pointed out it always starts with faith faith in the finished work of calvary and then it moves all the way up to there to love which is what the holy spirit itself [Applause] amen especially within the message where we have a restored word where we have an open word where we have the fullness of the truth we believe amen it's easy to say i'm mature because i understand the word of god amen and that's what you'll run into time and time again you'll have people say well i know what this means i know what the seven seals i know serpent seed i know godhead i know that the death to death i'm a mature believer but that couldn't be further from the truth and then if you look at the pharisees they knew everything the sadducees knew everything but yet they weren't mature were they because when the word stood in front of them they missed it this is what paul had to say about this he says in first corinthians 13 2 it says and though i have the gift of prophecy he did and understand all mysteries he did and all knowledge which he had as was needed at least and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing so you can know it all have it all be it all but without charity which is love which is the holy spirit you're nothing that's what paul says you can study it all your life you can be around it all your life you can have all the words all the head knowledge you want but until you have charity which is god's love you are nothing amen amen that's what he's talking about with charity is god's love that's not human love that's god's love amen it's a love that goes far beyond what we could ever do whatever we could imagine or think but the problem is we run it through a filter of our human love and so when god's love is moving we don't recognize it as god's love there's one one great thing that i learned through brother eugene brown and he said this he said god's love is based on spiritual growth what that means is that god's love will act in a way that causes you to grow spiritually it is not in a way that causes you to grow financially it is not in a way that causes you to grow big muscles or become beautiful to look at or have a successful career that is not what god cares about god doesn't give a flip about those things what god cares about is are you being restored into the image that he had of you before the foundation of the world and so what he's going to do is he's going to cause you to grow spiritually and if that means bankrupting you he'll do it if that means laying you flat on the bed in a hospital he'll do it amen but if you will obey the word then often you can go through it a lot easier amen but he's looking to love you in a way that causes you to grow spiritually so that what you can be restored to your eating condition which is what fellowship dominion and eternal life that's what he's looking for he's not looking to give us wealth here he's got he's got a cattle on a thousand hills he's got a city waiting for us he's got a new heaven and a new earth this is so temporal in the eyes of god that it's not even worth focusing on he's trying to get us out of here so that we can enjoy the richness of the blessings that will come with being in him amen so god's love will cause you to grow spiritually not currently and so god's love in action often looks quite different than what we might expect amen remember what brother brahm said about the holocaust he said that was the tender hand of jehovah moving them back to israel i saw something the other yesterday or the day before and it was it was uh two jews and one was a a high rabbi and one was a converted christian that that that used to be jewish and they were talking about the oral tradition the oral torah so in jewish uh if what they believe is they have the original torah which is the books of moses and then they have an oral torah which was passed down only orally it is never written and so you cannot study it you have to learn it by by memory and he was taught you know they were debating whether this oral torah was right or wrong or or whether it was of god and whether it could be relied on and and the converted christian was going through and pointing out all the things that were literally wrong with it that disagree with scripture that with the given law and these different things he says how can this be of god if it has error inside of it you know but um the the the i gave credit to the rabbi that was responding he said you know god works in ways that we don't understand sometimes and he says we saw the the the prophecy that was not only in the written torah but he says it was in the oral torah that would call the jews back to israel he says and that's what the holocaust did he recognized that that was a fulfillment of prophecy it was not just that they were being persecuted but they were being persecuted with purpose and that was to restore them to the place of promise where they could meet their messiah amen i thought that was pretty insightful he was completely blind and everything else to be frank when it comes to the reality of the word and christ in these different things as you'd expect from a rabbi but he recognized that the fulfillment of that prophecy looked a lot like anything but love but yet he says that was a fulfillment of prophecy to bring us back to the land of israel amen amen god's love and action looks quite different from how we think it ought to look brother brown puts it this way he says so get christ in your heart christ in the holy spirit is the same thing the holy spirit christ means the anointed one and the holy spirit is that anointing and you are the one that's anointed amen what does christ mean anointed one and then he says you are that anointed one amen you are little christ amen if you have the life of god inside of you in portion you are a little christ you are a little anointed one that's what he's saying and it's christ in you anointing you he said see what i mean then you've got the right thing remember paul was saying prophecy mysteries knowledge have all faith so i could remove mountains and have charity and have nothing brother brahm says this is what you've got to get here is the holy ghost he says then you've got the right thing then he can use you to anything he wants to use you in because you're in the body and subject to any of those gifts but see to have one of those gifts outside of the body let me put it this way to have one of those gifts outside of the baptism of the holy spirit it would do you no good amen it would do you no good without the holy spirit though i speak with tongues of men and angels and have not charity it profits me nothing though i have faith and can understand all the mysteries of god it profits me nothing do i give my body to be burnt as a sacrifice give all my goods to the poor though i have faith to move a mountain i am nothing see don't depend on those things he says the holy spirit is a being it's god god in you the person god that's lit your whole entire being you're changed you're a new creature any little thing that's wrong he'll tell you that's wrong then quit don't do it father i didn't mean to do that you forgive me see and that's the holy spirit he says the holy spirit will absolutely be in what corrective mode in your life when you get off the word when you get into your carnality when you get into yourself the holy spirit will check you and say whoa whoa this isn't of me this isn't of the word we got to stop this amen and then there's surrender and there's repentance and then there's obedience or else there's what discipline that's the way god works every single time let's take it a little bit further because sometimes we think it's our knowledge that makes us valuable to the body amen you've been citing the message for all these years it could be easy for an elder to think well the reason that i'm valuable now is because i have all this knowledge but we know what paul said about that in first corinthians 80 says now as touching things offered to idols we know that we all have knowledge he says knowledge puffeth up but charity edifier okay so let's go to the amplified it it expands it a bit it says now about food offered to idols of course we all we know that we all possess knowledge concerning these matters because remember he had to tell them you know if things are offered to idols and you don't know about it go ahead and eat it and don't ask doubt you know that's that's a scripture don't ask don't tell is food offered to idols that's the only thing amen he says if you don't know anything about it eat it in confidence who cares but he says the minute you know it's offered to an idol you can't eat it he says we know all this he said of course we know that all of us possess knowledge concerning these matters yet mere knowledge paul diminishes it paul diminishes knowledge like this he says this is mere knowledge when you say something's mere it means it's virtually worthless right you know david was a mere youth to goliath right just a little boy not worthy of anything that's what paul says here this is mere knowledge we're talking about mere knowledge causes people to be puffed up to bear themselves loftily and be proud but love which is affection and good will and benevolence edifies and builds up and encourages one to grow to his full stature amen amen so in other words what knowledge we have is not to raise ourselves above somebody else to prove ourselves to be better than that amen but if it is godly love it is tempered by love and our goal is to raise that person to what the standard of the word not the standard of me not the standard of the pastor not the standard of anybody else but it is to raise them to the standard of the word and that is what edification is is when you raise somebody to the standard of the word amen we all have different thoughts we all have different ideas we all have different preferences i have a lot i have a lot of preferences amen amen but when i come to bring that to somebody else there's no place for that and then when i'm looking to edify somebody my preferences aren't going to do it what i've got to do is bring it subject to the word and say this is what the word says and then it's not a preference but it is a requirement amen it is god's way it is god's thinking rather than mine so i have to be subject to the word when i come behind this pulpit but not only behind this pulpit but every one of us as we're talking to each other as we're encouraging each other as we're even correcting one another we have to bring it to the standard of the word not to the standard of me amen i remember brother chris moritz said something at a couple's fellowship one time uh we went to a camp for for a weekend with the with the couples the married couples and and in answering the question he says when i teach my children he says i point them to the word of god not to me he says that way when i fail they know that i failed not the word of god he says i don't point them to my standard i point them to the word standard because inevitably i'm going to fail so you don't want them to say well that's the word failing but rather he says we point them to the word and then when i fail i can humble myself to the word and i can humble myself to the children because we're all looking to the word rather than looking to dad to be perfect amen amen paul says that we are to be speaking the truth in love that gives us motive amen everything we speak to our fellow believers is supposed to be in love and the objective is to what to edify amen to raise them up to the standard of the word so we are agents of love and what motivates us is the truth that we are to share to bring them back to their position in christ amen paul continues he says and if any man think that he knoweth anything he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know i tell you take this service personally amen take it personally this was very personal to me as i was going through this if any man think he knows anything he knows nothing as yet he ought to know the amplified says this if anyone imagines that he has come to know and understand much of divine things without love he does not yet perceive recognize and understand as strongly and clearly nor has he become as intimately acquainted with anything as he ought or as is necessary when you think you've got it figured out when you go into education when you go into the higher you know halls of learning you go into you know people that are doing the masters and things and they'll say the more i know the less i know because you the further you go the broader it gets the and the thing is they can only end up focusing on such a narrow thing because they don't have the bandwidth they don't have the capacity to try and understand everything so what they do is they get deeper and deeper but it gets sharper and sharper and sharper you can't go deeper and deeper and deeper and understand everything you understand less but you understand more of a very particular area but you lose the you lose the broadness of your of your understanding and you bring it down to a very specific point amen so what's paul is talking about right here is religious arrogance yes amen if we could speak it clearly this is religious arrogance he says that somebody that that is coming across and they're saying i know this and i know this and i know this what they are as a know-it-all amen and that's religious arrogance and i can say that because i have had to deal with this in my own life i mean that's what this looks like is when you think that you know more than somebody that's been serving the lord for 20 or 30 years chances are you don't chances are you know nothing as yet you ought to know amen i can say that i i'm a recovery know-it-all if i can put it that way man so i'm not here i'm not here preaching at anyone like i said this is a personal sermon to me okay but if it applies take it get personal this morning look at yourself this morning amen amen when you think you know it when you think you've got it all when you think you've got it all figured out you don't have a clue you don't have a clue you don't have a clue and you need to get down on your knees and you need to humble yourself and repent and say lord i don't know a thing i need you to help me with this amen amen the problem with people like this is that it's based on what they've heard or what they've read rather than a personal experience this is knowledge without experience and that's what creates religious arrogance is that they can read the bible they can listen to the message they can read the message they can do all these things but until it becomes a reality in their life because what god interprets his word by what bringing it to pass and if it hasn't been brought to pass in your life you actually don't probably have a revelation of what he meant in the first place unfortunately amen what we're talking about remember was what love and that love is the holy spirit brother ellie was talking about it in his prayer this morning he said what that that god is love amen and that god is light amen and that love will bring light amen it's going to bring it every time because what says thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto thy path my path not thy path my path amen so the holy spirit's going to work in me to open up my way not focus on you to open up your ways so much amen the word is working on me to bring me to the place and then the word is working on you to bring your place but the word is not working on me to bring you to your place as a minister i have a part in that but brother bob does not come over and start working on uh sister maureen or or brother joe or brother paul no no no the word is there to show him and then when he has something that god has opened to him when he has experience in life as opposed to just head knowledge then he can share that with somebody in the hopes that they will accept it and move up in their relationship with christ amen but he is not there god's not there giving brother bob the will for brother paul's life that's not the way it's meant amen but paul has the holy ghost himself and that's what's going to show him his will amen generally speaking amen i want to hit this scripture from a few different angles stay tight with me i'm going to use the prophet's words i don't want to preach it i just want to use his words so that it it comes clean okay i don't want to inject myself into this one too much i just want to take this and push it down the way that it came to me amen so how do you recognize religious arrogance the first thing you'll see is that it won't take correction from the word of god brown says this and sometimes something operating has to be called or said something about it called down or something of that order and the person that's got that gif gift rejects it just remember they refuse it remember the gift wasn't right he's saying if there's something comes across if there's something that comes out if there's something that's been spoken if there's something that's been delivered to the people and it's not right and it won't receive correction he says if the person refuses it then the gift wasn't right it wasn't god in the first place the spirit of god is always ready for correction sweet and humble willing see if it stands up and says i'll do it anyhow you know how sometimes just remember he says arrogant spirits are not of god see so why take a substitute when everything the whole earth is filled with the glory of god you see the real power of god why will we take a substitute we're too late in the day now but remember the bible has said he'd come in like just as sly as he could and deceive the very elected if possible amen an arrogant spirit never receives correction from the word amen like i said how do you respond to a situation like this i'm a former inaudible god still has to keep it i have to keep that under the blood i have to keep that under prayer amen i'm an intellectual person i'm relatively intelligent and then that's something that'll flare up smart people tend to be religiously arrogant okay amen amen this is me talking okay intellectual people tend to be religiously arrogant so i'm pointing to myself here okay if you're thinking of somebody think of brother john okay and pray for me okay this is this is down this is rubber meets the road okay all right but look to me look to me and say if there's somebody that reminds me of it's probably brother john and then we'll be all because i'm pointing to myself okay amen but what happened was what god had to humble me god had to break me down big fish little pond god took me into a really big pond right and showed me you're not as smart as you think you are not as gifted as you think you are not as intellectual as you think you are not as hard a worker as you think you are not as great a husband as you think you are not a great father you need you you really ought to be and what do you do he started showing me the weaknesses but that weaknesses came through what the word that weaknesses came by what looking around in the body and seeing those that could do things better than i could and then all it takes is one step into the halls of memorial university and i realized i wasn't the smartest person on the planet i didn't think i was the smartest person on the planet but i thought i was probably smarter than i was you step into mine and all of a sudden people are acing things and you're going through with 70s and 80s right and you say how hard you study for that and not really oh you know now i became a small fish in an ocean amen but then he starts working on what your spiritual life and all of a sudden you know maybe you are taking cracks at this one or that one and i've told this to the different ones and and i remember when i went away and i came back you remember and i apologize to a couple different couples in that and i said i was looking at you through a certain lens and i was critical of the pastor i was critical of the elders in the church and these different things and i had to go and i had to apologize for that sister martin do you remember that okay that was when i came back from dallas and the lord really dealt with me in dallas my wife would remember and i just there there was i was just looking at things through what religious arrogance and when i was there i saw what i was supposed to look like what i was supposed to be i had the holy ghost that had nothing to do with it but rather i was so caught up in what i thought i was that i couldn't get to what i really should be and god broke me down and broke me down and broke me down he's been breaking me down ever since so that the point is when you start to raise up you start to realize that definitely isn't the holy spirit because he took care of that when i was 21 or 22 years old all right you recognize and you say okay lord here it comes again batten down the hatches right and you start to get under into what prayer and you say lord don't let this don't let this come up again amen like i said look at me look at me we're talking about brother john today okay all right but i'm glad people responded the way that they did with maturity with grace probably with some giggles behind closed doors you know when they see the foolishness that comes out of a young man's mouth that think he's more spiritual than he is right but there is a place where that can be taken away and look at where i am today standing behind a pulpit humbly i believe why because he broke me down and then he took the blinders off my eyes that had me looking at everyone except for myself amen but listen to this because this is the response to religious arrogance brother braham says now surely after all these years in the field and around the world and seeing different people i ought to know a little bit about the gate to enter in it and if you want to get somewhere with god never let an arrogant spirit ever come around you don't let no malice come in no matter what anybody does if they are wrong don't you never build up a complex against that person see you be sweet and kind remember god loved you when you were in sin amen and if the spirit of god is in you you love the other person when he's in wrong see just pray for them and love one another what's he saying when arrogance comes your way when you want to respond to arrogance with arrogance he says don't let that happen amen don't let malice come in just taste sweet and humble is what he says arrogance is not the response to arrogance when the holy spirit's in the body amen that is not what we're looking for he says don't you get the spirit on you that's in that person right you hold yourself steady and you hold to the word amen listen to what paul said and i i've i've talked about this recently this is galatian 6 it says brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault ye which are spiritual so the requirement to address a fault is spiritual people restore such a one in the spirit of meekness so the proof of spirituality in this situation is meekness brother joe was talking to me about this some time ago and then the other night what is meekness meekness is the power to do something but the character not to do it right shock and awe thunder and lightning right the sons of thunder remember the sons of thunder that was not meekness that was religious arrogance wasn't it lord let's destroy them off the planet they're doing what you're doing right they're doing what only us are supposed to do i thought was great you know where jesus just kind of laughed at them i think you know just laughed you kidding me you're kidding me we're going to destroy somebody you know and yet we look at our own lives and he could have destroyed us first things that were far worse i think you know he says what do it in a spirit of meekness considering thyself lest thou also be tempted tempted what put in the same situation they are and get the same spirit on you that they have amen or look at it another way tempted to do the wrong thing to do the wrong response amen bear ye one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of christ for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he deceiveth himself paul hits us a number of times when you think you're something you're nothing when you think you know it all you know nothing but look at this he says for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing this is a continual condition for a christian speaking of our humanity we are nothing you are nothing and i am nothing and really what we have to look at is to say our worth is only through what god in us and what god has done with us and what god is doing with us and the parts of us that are surrendered and connected to christ that's the only thing that's worth right we otherwise we are worthless we are the same as the world right because we are of the world in that sense you know our our outer and our and our middle zones are our flesh and our spirit realm they're all world right and that's what we're fighting with day by day by day and we're fighting because they're not of the spirit of god right so the only thing like i said is your soul that's that's sealed by the holy spirit and so everything else about you is nothing and the thing in you that is something isn't even you it's christ so you are nothing you are nothing so don't try and pretend you're something and make that how you're going to respond to somebody amen amen paul hits on this time and time again don't get caught up in who and what you are and use as a as a reason to bash somebody amen men brother gerald i i think the theme of brother gerald's message these days is what grace grace grace that called you grace that saved you grace that opened your eyes grace that gave you the holy ghost grace that gives you faith to please him grace allows you to overcome in this life amen everything we have start to finish is grace amen so why would we be proud of what we have of who we are thankful yes proud no because it's not ours it's not something we did haughty arrogant never can't be because it's not your working it's his working in you amen amen brother brown puts it this way he says and god is so unusual he does things in such an unusual way so contrary to science so contrary to education so contrary to sometimes man's theology just contrary to that god does that just to show he is god and to do that he has to take somebody that knows none of these things so that he can work through that person when jesus came he didn't take caiaphas the priest that was trained and ready for the job he went down and got a man men that couldn't even sign their name ignorant and unlearned the bible said we were they were because god takes nothing to make something out of it see amen and whenever you get to a place that you feel you're nothing then you're just about ready to come to god and when you get to a place that you know nothing but you want to know something then he'll reveal himself to you amen amen can we check our lives to say and say that's where i'm coming from i know nothing my little p brain compared to god's brain is nothing my knowledge my understanding all of it is nothing compared to him lord i want to know your way i want to know what you think i want to know your response i want to know your attitude i want to know your strength i want to know your grace i want to know your forgiveness i want to know your love i want to know your joy amen not what i've what create develop right make up conjure for the situation but lord i want you to be what i get out of this amen amen because the thing is otherwise what's going to happen is if we inject ourselves into it the result will not be of eternal value because what it's denominational the minute you inject a man into it the menu man i say a man man's thoughts men's ideas meant theology whatever it would be the minute you do that it becomes denominational and that means god is out of it right 99 truth is still wrong you got to have 100 amen going back to our place in ephesians paul says this but speaking the truth in love may grow up and into grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ and then catch the word and grow up into him up so you're at a low level and you come to a high level and then says into so you are out of and you grow into so you grow up and you go into him which means you are out and below him if we could put it that way to start amen you are dead in your sins and trespasses that's what paul says amen but what you grow up and you grow into him so that what means what to connect to be raised to a higher level to become a part of to be tied to to be united in christ and not just in any old way but in a way that makes christ the head amen not just half lord because that's not lord at all but lord amen lord means that he is what the ruler over all amen that he is the head nobody has two brains right you only have one brain and so what this is saying is that you will come to this place where what god is in control of all things in your life can you be a believer and god not have control in all places of your life 100 we're still here we're still fighting we're still struggling amen there are places where i'm strong that you're not strong and there's places you're strong that i'm not amen all based on where we're at in our walk and sometimes god works on things in your life a lot sooner than he works on them with mine and vice versa and then so we can't go around taking the christianity out of each other because we're mature because we're connected to christ because we're surrendered to christ in an area and somebody isn't and you say well they can't have the holy ghost they can't be this they can't be that no no no they just aren't at that point in that spot in their life yet and that's all there is to it amen so maturity and the bride means that she is subject and connected to christ in every way she surrendered her thoughts her ideas her preferences and she is subject to the will of god brother brown put it this way he says when you surrender fully he'll come in fully when you surrender fully he'll come in fully now that looks a little different than maybe what we think because we think we just open one door to our lives and we surrender and he comes in he fills everything but the reality is you have 7 322 doors in your life where you let him into the main part of your life and then you've got to go around and you've got to open all those little doors to your finances to your relationships to your job to your career to your education to where you live to who you sit under in ministry to what you do in the local body to where you live right all of these things relationships past hurts disappointments all of those things are doors that are locked and you've got to go in and the holy spirit's throwing through the main chat of your life and you've got to open it up and let him fill it right and then you go the next door and you open it up and you let him fill it what does it do it cleans it out it burns it out it burns it i like what brother ellie said we talked it was what fire amen the love of god is a fire what will it do it'll burn out everything that needs to come out and it'll fill it with what the bomb of gilead the holy spirit in your life amen amen what is it this can't be a culture amen the bride can't be in unity until every single one of us is surrendered to christ in every part of our life so paul said amen let me finish the quote when you surrender fully he'll come in fully but until you surrender he can't come in fully surrender surrender your thoughts surrender your thinking surrender your life surrender your all surrender your prestige surrender everything to him now and he'll come in and fill you with the holy ghost that's what he's here to do amen amen like i said it can't be a culture that's controlling us it can't be a message culture amen that that's going to kill any church is a message culture we're talking about the life of god remember the quote brother brown says it is god in you that's when you've got what you need is god in you the holy spirit it doesn't matter if you are surrounded by people that believe you have to believe and have received the holy ghost for you to be of any part of this body amen by one spirit we are baptized into one body now multiple bodies one body one spirit which is the holy spirit which is christ in you which is love amen that's it that's the peak right here but building you up into the place where the only thing that's working in you and operating in you is the holy spirit amen amen often the source of conflict like i said is when i'm mature and you're not in a certain area or as is more likely you're mature in an area and i'm not right and so what happens is that you're being moved by the holy spirit and i haven't surrendered just yet so if we try and work together that's not going to work is it amen if we're trying to work on the music program and brother gerald's led by the holy spirit and brother bob doesn't have the holy ghost yet at the tender age of 68 then we've got a problem don't we brothers because brother gerald's going to be led by the holy spirit and brother bob's going to be led by what he was watching on youtube on how to have an effective service in the church guess what don't go to youtube for ideas on how to run a church don't go read books on how to run a church brother brown says get the holy ghost forget brother branham paul says get the holy ghost you know we don't have to you don't have to believe in a prophet to believe that you need to get the holy ghost to be a part of the of the bride of christ amen by one spirit like i said we're baptized amen so don't go running to youtube don't go run into this book or that book amen get the holy ghost and then go to the word of god and if you want to move past the word of god go to something that's ordained and vindicated and leave it there amen amen but in the end though just because brother bob doesn't have the holy ghost no i'm not going to go there brother bob cause you do just because brother bob's not surrendered this is what we'll do we're going to pick up brother bob just because brother bob's not surrendered in an area of his life don't let that mean that brother bob's not a christian don't let that mean that brother bob is not a believer right don't take away their christianity because they haven't matured in the area where you're strong amen the scripture says we do what we bear one another's burdens how do you bear the burden of somebody when you're strong where they're weak i mean that's why god gave us spouses so you can bear one another's burdens in a more intimate way amen because your wife is going to talk to you in a way she might not with another sister and then you can talk to your wife i can talk to my wife about things i wouldn't talk to anyone else about what she can bear my burden she can she can she can work with me she can support me in those areas where i struggle amen so what the idea of you being strong and them being weak is for you to help them not to bear them down it's to bear them up to hold them up until such time as they can mature and be connected to christ as we were talking about amen amen being in the body is what exposes those things quite often right you're with somebody and you're like wow they are so far ahead of me that's what happened to me when i went to dallas i realized wow i'm behind right and so what do you do you start going to god and saying look i obviously haven't done a good job of bringing myself up to speed so let's let you do it and so all of a sudden he does and that's what victory is most of the time is you saying i can't do it as soon as you say i can't do it god says okay i'm ready to move right and as soon as he's oh as soon as he moves who stops god who stops god when you surrender and he starts moving ain't nothing going to stop it amen that's what victory is so often that's the day we surrender to god and take him at his word that's when gross starts is when we stop and say this isn't me i can't do it lord i'm going to let you do it amen and what is it i'm going to believe your word above all else and i'm going to hold to that no matter what the symptoms are no matter what the the day looks like no matter what the bank account looks like no matter what the the cue for my business looks like no matter where you call me to go no matter what you call me to do i'm going to trust your work and that's where the growth starts is when you say not me it's you that's doing this because i wouldn't choose it i wouldn't choose i wouldn't choose to be up here you have to be crazy but says this notice let us remember he also created our bodies and won't our bodies have to obey him that's what we're talking about the bodies is the unsafe portion but he says it's got to obey what god amen amen you surrender your thoughts to him surrender your life to him surrender your faith to him and watch that body obey what he says if you're a drunkard and you can't quit drinking surrender that life to him and watch you'll drink no more if you're a habitual smoker and try to give it up and can't do it just surrender that to him and watch what happens he'll make that body come back in subjection to the word yes sir but you've got to surrender it to him you've got to believe him he made our bodies they obey his will also do you believe that he says if you're a christian you have to amen but what's he saying surrender surrender is what causes the connection to christ amen amen so we've got to get what connected to christ in every day of our life and that way i'll focus on me and you can focus on you and i won't focus on you because i'm too busy trying to get connected to christ in every area of my life amen and then when conflict comes what do we do we look at the word and we say lord lift me up and let me stand by faith on heaven's table and a higher plane then i have found lord plant my feet on higher ground not on the shoulders and neck of the brother or sister next to me right amen we're looking to stand on the word and grow in christ not on the backs of somebody else's failures amen so when that process is complete the result looks like this from whom the whole body from whom from whom who is that christ so from christ the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supply according to the effectual working in the measure of every part every part every person maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself and love said before this is the most difficult scripture to understand because it's a lot of big words and it's a run-on sentence so go to the amplified says for because of him because of christ the whole body the church and all its various parts closely joined and firmly knit together by the joints and ligaments with which it is supplied when each part with power adapted to its need is working properly in all its functions grows does not start but grows to full maturity building itself up in love amen amen with power adapted to its need the holy spirit working in the body puts power to where it's needed you can't put your full strength through your pinky and then if you got a pinky in the church don't put your full strength to it because you'll break it amen but you can put your full strength through your legs can't you you can put your full strength to your back because it's built to do it so he says he'll put power to the place where it's needed to achieve the job so guess what if i'm going to pick up something with my pinky i don't need to put all the power i have to do that but if i want to pick this pulpit up i'm going to need everything i've got don't i so the holy spirit applies power to the person to meet the need or the requirement that the body has of that body so guess what you may not need to have a you know look at the scripture it says some brought forth 30 fold and some 60 fold some 90 and 100. guess what we don't all need 100 fold to be effective some of us only need 30 and some of us need 100. and then that's based on what we're doing within the body amen but notice now it says we don't find our place and then connect to christ this is where we get it backwards we say well i know what i'm supposed to be i know what i'm supposed to do and we start to do it but paul says this he says from whom says from christ the whole body is fitly joined together so you've got to get to christ first and then you're joined to the body amen so we don't find our place and then connect to christ but rather get yourself to christ get your life surrendered get yourself out of the way and then from there you surrender to his direction his leadership his will and then he joins you into the body he adds you to the body in the place that he has ordained for you amen amen we don't come with gifts and ideas and thoughts we come with a surrender heart and a surrender mind and then he takes us and places us in the place that he needs you to be where he wants you to be and sometimes it's temporary and sometimes it's permanent i've done just about every role there is in the church i've song led i i've done trustee i've done deacon i've done treasurer i've done audio visual work and then obviously i preached i've done all of it right it wasn't all permanent but he was moving me in different things and guess what i sat many years in the congregation same as everybody else right what he was moving me where i needed to be to learn what i need to learn to bring me to where he ultimately wanted me to be right can you imagine if i knew that i was going to be a minister at the beginning i probably have messed it up that's what you see a lot of people do is they'll mess it up because they see the end but they don't they don't adjust to the process that god wants them to do and then they won't surrender to it brother braham says this you don't have to talk so much about it god does his own talking god testifies of his gifts but all those gifts are wonderful they're dandy and we love them god grant them to every one of us would have every gift but i'd rather have the giver than all the gifts paul said though i could have the gifts without the giver now if we have went to seeking the giver instead of the gifts i believe the church would have been further up the road don't you think so if we'd stay close to god and loved him and just kept living for him and not trying to push things over just live for god and live a pure holy life and live and pray every day keep yourself refreshed in his presence god will take care of the rest of it my wife shared this with us the other day and it was just what i needed for this part of the sermon amen he says he will adopt the people into his own beloved body the church he'll do it he'll do it we don't do it he'll do it amen and when the rapture comes you'll be found without a blemish because you're living in the presence of the king that's the secret friend there it is when you're meeting really face to face with demon powers when you're meeting face-to-face with opposition that's where the testing time comes and it changes only it's strongest at its weakest link that's right and when you're face to face with opposition be sure that you know what you're talking about what be sure that he has called you and placed you where you are and then you can have confidence that you can stand on the ground that you're you're standing on amen if you're not confident that that's your land you're going to get pushed off because the other guy's going to want it more than you are amen you might say well i'm an arm so i'm going to do what arms do don't do that don't do that don't say i know what i'm gonna be so i'm gonna be it no you just surrender to him and let him grow you into whatever he wants to be amen not everybody is meant for leadership okay we look in this church we've got one pastor and we've got 30 odd people here guess what we can't all be pastors right can't all be leaders can all be elders can't all be deacons everybody's got to have their place and we've got a lot of people that want to be leaders that aren't meant to be leaders because it would break them either the stress would break them or they get caught up in the things that that cause leaders to fail if you're a man it's going to be women popularity and money you can't handle it amen what he knows what you can bear but more importantly he knows what you're supposed to do and he'll put you where you can and then when you have confidence in that then it doesn't matter what comes your way you know you're not going to bend you're not going to break you're not going to fail because it's him that's doing the work not you amen amen you can start out a leader in your head and you can end up a janitor in the church and that's exactly where god wanted you to be amen amen and then when i say destroy us i don't mean to send us to hell but it would break our spirit and then to the point where we just have to sit in the church and do nothing because we've what we've been broken we went too fast we got ahead of god and and that that it can cause a breaking in our spirit it can cause mental distress it can cause these different things and all of a sudden something snaps and you can't do anything anymore amen amen so we don't need leaders what the church needs are people that are led by the holy spirit amen not led by a pastor not led by deacons not led by men not led by women but that are led by the holy spirit that's what we're looking for remember is a body that works effectively together that's we're talking about growing into a place of being effective in the body amen what the people need what the church needs is people that are under the influence of the holy spirit not the influence just because you attended the service but under the influence because that's what's inside of you in the first place amen you don't come to church to get leadership you've got leadership in you all the time if you've got the holy spirit and then you've got healing you've got deliverance you've got direction all of these things are with you all the time and you need to be recognizing that and know that you're under the influence of that amen what the church needs is people that are submitted to christ amen in every part of their lives so that god can use them to initiate things if you look at this brother joe let's talk about this a number of times how many things has brother mark initiated in this church he's not the pastor but the holy spirit has used him to do things amen and you'll look in this church and you'll see things happen right and you'll see you know we've got paul and kim and they're doing things with young people who told paul and kim to do that did brother jared tell him but gerald i don't think you told him to go camping this weekend i don't think you told him to go out and have you know fun days outside and these different things what is it the holy spirit working in the body doing what initiating things for the health of the body right pastor didn't have to do that amen and so it's like that all the time you'll see people they'll just have a little initiative because why the holy spirit told him to do it and the proof of it is that what it brings forth fruit according to the word of god and what have we seen we've seen baptisms of young people lately what is it it's an effective youth group that's working to meet the needs mixed in with what a five-fold ministry and families that are raising their kids according to the word of god it's what the body working together to achieve what new births amen amen amen amen what paul's reminding us of in that scripture is that every part every person in the body has to be working effectively in order for us to make a rapture and then we're going to be pulling together scripture talks about remember if you have a couple sticks you can break them easily but you bind a bunch of sticks together and try and break the group you can't do it when we're working together when we're working effectively according to a common purpose according to the one spirit that baptizes into that body then we can achieve things that we could never achieve on our own amen amen like i talked about last time you can have the world's strongest heart but if you don't have the veins if you don't have the arteries to take blood away to bring it back if you don't have the capillaries that take it all the way to the smallest portion of your body what happens is that body rots because it's not getting fresh blood and oxygen and you'll get gangrene set in i mean it doesn't matter big or small it's all necessary as part of the body amen paul continues he says this i say therefore and testify in the lord that ye henceforth walk not as other gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind amen that's how you know that somebody's living outside of the word is that they're going by what they think rather than what god said in the word amen the greatest tell of this is usually phrased as not i think but i feel i feel i don't care what you feel what does the word say right don't feel it don't think it point you to the word point to the word and that's how you know that you're going to be right and then they're governed by the changing thoughts of society they're controlled by their emotions and they're influenced by their own desires amen the way thereof is death amen verse 18 having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of god now notice they're contrasted with us in that they are alienated from the life of god but we are not because why we have the holy spirit within us and they're alienated through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness that sexual or sensual desires and if you look at the the original sin you look at eve what did it lead her to lasheviousness amen and that caused the downfall of the entire earth amen given themselves over onto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness but ye have not so learned christ not a pretty picture paul paints here is it and then he's saying look if god's working in your life you're going to see a couple things and verse 14 he says you won't act as a child and then you won't be self-centered you won't be focused on your own viewpoints amen remember we read last time that you won't be tied to ministries that was what paul said to find them as children was that one said i'm a paul and why i'm of apollos and i'm of this one and i'm of that when he says that is childish and that's the reason why i can't teach you higher things is because you're still stuck on men you're stuck on who brought you in rather than what the one that gave him the word that brought you in in the first place amen and we've seen that in spades in the message whether it's lee vale whether it's joseph branham these different ones you have camps that have developed around men and what happened they've gotten cold starchy formal and generally in most those churches they have no youth in them anymore the church has failed and it's just a dead group now right bunch of old soldiers that's what happens why because they've taken a man's ministry over their own amen now you say brother i'm not tied to a ministry well some of us are tied to old ministries some of us are tied to tied to the one that we used to have rather than the one we have now listen can you imagine if everybody only wanted brother gerald behind this pulpit what's the point of me being here right if we're tied to a man i'm of no use and i might as well sit down i'm wasting my time and i'm wasting yours right i can go get gray hair some other way right why we're tied to what old pastors right you're tied to ministries and other churches in some places right what is it you say well that man's got a greater gift to my pastor so i i really wish i could have him what is it you're not focused on what god has in front of you and god can't bless you because you're where you're supposed to be if you're aware god's if you're where you're supposed to be god's put the man there to take care of you right and if you're around looking at everybody else but that man you'll never get the blessing that you're going to have by being a part of the local body because your body's here but your spirit is someplace else and you're trying to feed on somebody else on a regular basis amen again this isn't about don't listen to other ministries no not at all but if you're tied to that man then it's going to hinder your walk because you're so focused on what he has and what he does and how high he is or what his great gift is to this and the other thing and you'll get nothing out of the local body and you'll actually be of no use to the local body believe it or not because like i said your heart's in another place amen and whether we realize it or not every minister will make a mistake in doctrine sometimes if only by omission right when i'm preaching i may say something and you'll say that's right but it's not quite right but listen if i sat here and went through every point of doctrine as i'm preaching here we'd have some really long services so what is it i'm i'm focusing on a certain area and i'll say something and that's all i'm going to say about it i'm not going to give you the the full truth i'm just going to give you an element of that truth as it relates to what we're preaching on that morning amen but if we sit here with critical spirits we'll say well he's off the word how many times have we heard somebody say that brother's off the word he's not off the word you just listen to one portion of one service rather than sitting under the ministry and seeing what he really thinks but it was enough to justify you in not attending or not listening or not doing anything different than what you're doing right now amen brother branham himself made documented mistakes on doctrine that he had to do what correct later why progressive revelation he's growing in christ amen he's coming out from a baptist church right he's been taught certain things throughout his life and he had to come to a place where he had did what sometimes it was that he didn't go far enough and that's other times it was that he didn't go he went too far and then but he'd say things at certain times and say the greatest weapon is this they say the greatest weapon is that they'd say the proof of the holy ghost is this and they'd say the proof of the holy ghost is that what is it if you treat them all as absolute statements he's wrong but he's growing he's growing in grace he's growing in his understanding amen so the man is going to fail every time he's going to fail every time in that he's not going to have everything he's not going to have the full knowledge of the word of god the minute he becomes a minister right i can tell you that and if that's required then i'm not a minister because i don't know it all feels good to say that they say admission is the is the first step right no but i don't know everything but the jail do you know everything so there you go two failed ministers amen remember brother jim dooley talked about this on wednesday said most disagreements between people are just misunderstandings or miscommunication not actual disagreements on the word of god what i found is that most people say think you're wrong because you didn't say it the way their pastor said it or else they get into a quote battle with you amen and they leave the scripture out of it entirely and it's quotes quotes quotes and they don't pull it through the scripture and then if we can go back to the word of god that's our absolute and then the word of god the message is not our absolute in that the words that brother braham spoke or not are absolute how can they be amen it's documented with mistakes how can it be our absolute himself said it you know moses brought them into the ark seven hundred versus seven thousand all these different things it's not the absolute brother branham said that he says oh brother that still remains the truth that the word that unmovable word of the living god is still the truth it's my absolute what it says is the truth to me that's the foundation word that's where the cornerstone is i don't want to shift with no denomination he says god never did have two heads to his church he never did it's one head he always dealt in every generation as we studied through the scriptures there's always one individual that he deals with because you get two men you get two opinions but it's got to come to one final absolute and my absolute is the word the bible so you can't have quote battles because that's not the absolute and as the pastor here as a pastor here of the church my absolute is the word i know you our brothers you kind of look to me to be your absolute as long as i follow god as paul said in the scripture you follow me as i follow christ amen so if he points us back to the word of god that ought to be our absolute as well amen i remember having late nights of fellowship with brother gerald after he preached something and we go over the next week remember those brother joel and sometimes up until two in the morning and blank and i'd sit there and we'd ask questions and say brother joe did you mean this where did you mean that he'd say no brother what made you think that and we talked to him we get clarity on something that he said that we felt was maybe a little higher a little hard for us you know being young as well a lot of times that the standard is high for a young a young christian you know but just to say brother is this really what you meant or was it you being brief and just hitting the high points and then you know whatever but we could have sat there and got upset got depressed because we couldn't meet the standard or we could go over and we can ask them ourselves amen what is it to take away that miscommunication to take away that that that thought that i put there of what he meant and just ask him say what do you mean and guess what clarity came and we had a wonderful time and then we enjoyed our nights of fellowship with them amen so remember we wouldn't act as children paul says the next thing is that you won't be swayed by the influence of people and then you'll stick with the word of god you'll look to the word for inspiration and you will look to the word for guidance and you will look to the word for your foundation you can't look to the world for any of these things and you can't look to the world and find anything that will help you in your walk with god there is nothing in satan's edom that will ever draw you closer to god nothing nothing nothing nothing like i said before if it's 99 truth and one percent wrong it's a denomination it's man's thought it's not god's thoughts and how are you going to feed on something that's going to bring you eternal value if it is not eternal itself amen you got to take it back to the word of god paul says this in corinth second corinthians he says be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion had light with darkness now unequally yoke means you're seeking to partner up to find common ground to find similarity with someone or something that doesn't have the same absolute why would you try that and then we testify and we witness to people but we're not seeking to become bosom buddies with people or with doctrines or with ministries that are outside the reveal word of the hour why would you do it it says for what concord have christ with belial in other words what what what agreement does god have with the devil or what part have he that believeth with an infidel with somebody that doesn't believe how are you going to get a connection with somebody that doesn't believe there's no connection to be made you witness you testify and then you move on if they reject it you can't have a close relationship with somebody that isn't on the same absolute same foundation you're on and what agreement had the temple of god with idols for ye are the temple of the living god as god has said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you and will be a father unto you and i you shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty amen i'm not saying you can't learn something from a denominational person some of them have dealt pretty deeply into certain topics and you know what they're good you can be corrected by a donkey you know balaam was right god can use anybody to correct you to do things but you're not up there to feed on it we're not out there to take that into our homes we're not out there to take that into our minds because what that means is you got to be really well versed in the word of god to run the run as tight of filters you need to make sure that that one word doesn't get through that takes the truth and twists it into what a denomination in your head because what's going to happen is the more you feed on that then all of a sudden you start to question what is vindicated you start to question what is an absolute because satan's got an avenue that you've opened up to him into your mind into your life into your influences and all of a sudden you're fighting against the word now instead of fighting against what you brought into your life and it'll twist your thinking amen i'm not saying don't read anything else brother gerald's got commentaries in there brother branham had commentaries but guess what brother brown went to preach the seals based on those commentaries and what happened the angel still had to correct him amen because why it wasn't the inspired and anointed word it was just people putting down their thoughts based on what they thought right based on hours of study years of study but it wasn't the truth and the angel had to come in and correct him amen amen it's hard that's hard preaching but it's the truth you're not going to get anything of eternal value out of the world and i say that to include the denominations amen you look in revelations 3 it says he stands on the standing on the outside knocking to get in amen they're not even worshipping him they're not even worshipping him he's on the outside knocking on the individual hearts of people because the church has put him out so if they're not worshiping christ there's only one thing left that's antichrist because outside of christ everything is antichrist it's not him right and it's against him and that'll tell you where the influence is amen third thing that paul pain says he says you'll find your body your place in the body of christ and then that means you'll be integrated with other believers brother paul haley i've mentioned this before he once spoke at our church in bc and he said something that really stuck with me and he said there's only one name one description for a sheep by itself in the scripture and that description is lost and then sheep are not meant to be alone they're a herd animal they're supposed to be in a flock and it's for their protection and it's for the benefit of themselves as well as a shepherd that's that's taking care of them amen so it means you're going to have a post of duty it means you're going to have responsibility you're going to be around people that you shape and you're going to be around people that shape you hey man it's going to be a harder thing than if you're on off by yourself and as i said before if you stay off by yourself you'll get to the point where nobody can correct you not even the word itself and you'll become a shell of what you used to be amen amen what i found is that god gives us a body so that we can see the blind spots that we wouldn't see otherwise amen and sometimes it's through just seeing the life of somebody else that's got that portion of their life it's fully surrendered to christ where you can look at somebody that trusts god completely for their finances you can look at another man say wow he's really got this fatherhood or husbandry thing down or you look at another wife or mother and say wow that's great i can do better amen lord help me to do that i'm not even close to doing that amen that's what happened to me in dallas was i went down and i saw young men serving the lord in a way that i could have only imagined right and it opens it up why because they're all a part of the body of christ not just this body it's the global body amen it's the it's the the entire body of christ amen amen amen it doesn't say that you're not a sheep the bible doesn't say that because you're lost you're not a sheep just says you're a lost sheep you're still a sheep but you're lost so come back to the flock come back to the place where you can be fed amen if you look at sheep and nature you see these are bighorn sheep do you notice how they're all looking in different directions i've hunted sheep you can't get anywhere near a sheep that's why you got to have a long shot with a rifle is because they stay in groups and every one of them will face in different directions and if you look over here you'll see look this one's looking here this one's looking here that one's there that one's there that one's there that one's there that one's there that one's there they're looking in all different directions how are you going to sneak up on on a bunch of sheep that are looking out for each other right what they're doing is they're using their numbers to the benefit to watch out for each other to make sure that one of them doesn't get taken by a predator amen they're going to see you coming every time up there and they will and the thing is they can see from a mile away you can see from a mile away because of what in the body it's because of experience experience allows you to see something in its infancy right before it can grow into something that's a problem that's why we rely on our elders for certain things that we can't rely on our young men for us because they have the experience to see something coming in its infancy and root it out before it has a start amen and then sometimes and this is just my opinion this is just saith jonathan god gives you a pastor so that you can't turn the tape off if you're sitting at home streaming if you're there listening to a tape when it gets uncomfortable what do you do turn it off or you can skip forward or you can just leave it right but when you're here you're a captive audience whether you like it or not you're a captive audience and god will speak to you and he'll give you what you need and you don't get to leave until the service is over unless you're really rude and none of us are really rude so we stay here don't we what is it a captive audience to hear the word of the lord whether you like it or not amen why because he's trying to do what grow us into a rapture grow us into a condition that he can use us grow us into a place where we can be fully effective for his kingdom purpose amen if you aren't getting a little bit uncomfortable in church on a regular basis i'd say there's something wrong amen can we say amen to that if you're not being uncomfortable in church on a regular basis something's wrong because what growth is uncomfortable then i remember when i was young and i get growing planes in my in my shins and my legs it was it hurt a lot what is it i was growing and it was causing my body pain or if you go into the gym right and you're trying to build up your strength guess what it hurts doesn't it for the next two or three days after you work out it hurts why because you're growing because you're going through something there's a change that's happening and change is always painful i mean it causes discomfort every single time and then so if you're coming through your challenges feeling fresh as a daisy chances are it wasn't actually a challenge you think it's a challenge you know if i if i tell jensen to come up here and lift my bible that's not a challenge for jensen but if he says it's a challenge and thinks it's a challenge that doesn't make it a challenge amen he can lift a three-pound bible over his head no problem but if i put 50 pounds down there and he tries to lift it now that's a challenge and he's going to come through on the other side of that if he can lift it feeling tired and he's going to be sore tomorrow god doesn't give us challenges that leave us sitting there fresh as a daisy we come through it and we're like whoo i need a breather yeah right and what it is is lord i need more of you is usually what it is that's when you know that you're reading through your challenges when you say god i need more of you rather than i've got enough and i don't need any more and then let me say that again if you come through it satisfied with what you have rather than saying i need more you didn't go through a challenge at all amen it's a struggle it's a battle it's a fight amen and we can we can be pulled away from that listen to what paul says as we're almost done here he says let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshiping of angels in other words this means don't let men act as a mediator between you and god telling you that you are unworthy or worthy and getting you to focus on so-called supernatural experiences that they have had or getting you to seek the same thing that they have rather than take your place in the body of christ that's a lot of words for that let no man beguile you that's what it means is that they have or they profess to have all these supernatural experiences they say you got to have what i have guess what we don't all get angels in our life we don't all get visions and dreams we don't all have supernatural things and see things flashing here and that and have discernment for this brother or this sister no no no no no brother brown says those gifts are there and he can pull them off and use any one of us at any given time for but we don't sit there and all have that all the time very few people have that and you saw it on brother brown's like because it'll take the it'll drain you mentally and it'll drain you physically if you're in a supernatural experience all the time so normally the people that have that don't actually have it and what they're trying to do is they're trying to put themselves into a higher spiritual plane than you for influence and to make themselves look like they're something that they're not amen that's what paul's saying don't let don't get sucked into trying to be like another man don't get sucked into trying to be like a woman look to the what word look to the standard of the word and say what does that say i'm supposed to be what does that say i'm supposed to do how am i supposed to look how am i supposed to live and then i'll focus on that and the holy spirit will quicken that to me way more than it's going to quite can some man or some woman come to me saying you need to live your life the way i live my life amen we raise them to the word standard not to our own standard amen we must all live by the word but we all live different lives you look around we don't all live the same way we don't have the same marriages we don't have the same jobs we don't have the same finances we don't drive the same cars we don't wear the same clothes in church we don't wear the same clothes out of church we do our hair different way right different glasses right our kids act different ways based on our standard discipline what we all have different ways of raising people but where the word is in absolute we need to be absolute but where it's gray we have to have grace for the person next to us and say lord i'm trusting you to lead them and i'll focus on leading me amen on him leading me not me leading me amen how do you get like this how do you get where somebody uh let me continue it says yeah intruding into those things which he had not seen vainly popped up in his fleshly mind that means they're pretending to have seen and done things and that it was never of god it was sometimes it was supernatural but it wasn't god but they think it was amen they'd have to take it back to the word these men get there this way it says by not holding the head from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered and knit together increases with the increase of god notice that increases with the increase of god then it's going to have word fruits it's going to have new births it's going to have the holy ghost amen not just what legalism not just everybody looking the way the pastor does or his wife does but you're going to have what new burst where the holy spirit is leading and initiating and moving within a body amen each one it says the amplified not holding fast to the head from whom the whole entire body supplied in it together by means of its joints and ligaments grows with a growth that is from god amen you can't argue with growth right long-term growth not short-term growth right you can feed on the things uh you can feed on you know there's feel-good uh ministries and you can feel on you know word of faith and these different things and you'll see some growth and then the pin will touch you and you'll just it's like steroids right you got to keep taking them to look like you're doing anything but the minute you stop taking them your growth goes away and you can never look the way you did before and then we all have to line up with the word remember we want to grow in grace with growth that is from god not try and supercharge ourselves through things that aren't vindicated amen so if they didn't hold fast to the to the head which is christ the question is what are we holding fast to what is it that's driving us day to day what is it that you can say this is what drove me this week this is what led me this week this is what brought me to do the things i did this week it says you have to hold fast to christ because if you don't you're going to start what creating things in your head that make you look spiritual and you're going to try and put that on somebody else and make them do the same thing that you're doing so that you feel good about where you are with god and you're actually going to end up leading them off of the word amen how do you know what you're holding to i just ask you what you're holding to how can you tell how can you go back in your week and say what was i holding to this week what'd you feed on what did you go to when you had a need that'll tell you what you're holding to amen what did you go to when you had a question amen did you go to youtube or did you go to the word of god did you go to some secular book or did you go to the word of god and then did you go into your prayer closet or did you go talk to somebody else what are you holding to amen or were you just tickling your ears if you're holding to christ you're going to feel growing pains if you're tickling your ears you're just going to feel comfortable where you are right so if you're holding the christ you'll feel growth you'll feel the struggle you'll feel the trials if you're holding to something else then all you're going to get is what tickling ears and you're going to feel good about yourself but nothing's actually going to be changing in your life so the other thing is this how do you know then it's christ that's leading you say well i believe christ is leading me how do you know christ is leading you it's a great question we've got a lot of people out there in the world that are professing to be christians and you'd say is christ leading you well the first thing i'll say is this you know it's christ when the focus is on you rather than other people amen because what the word is like to my path amen right it's a lamp to my feet amen amen so i'm focused the word is focusing on my path my feet what i'm doing where i'm falling short amen the word is a mirror for me rather than a scope on somebody else amen when the word is a mirror on me then i know that christ is leading me because if i'm using it as a scope a scope is on a rifle that's been used to destroy or kill other people and then so when it's focused on me rather than somebody else then i know that god is leading me amen see the mirror doesn't lie i can think i'm good looking i can think i've got a great hairstyle that i'm not going gray that my skin isn't becoming wrinkled that i'm not losing you know an eighth of an inch a year because i'm getting older you know that the love handles aren't starting to come in but if i look in the mirror the mirror doesn't line the good the bad and the ugly is still there right the mirror doesn't lie i can think anything i want but when i look in the mirror the mirror tells me the truth doesn't it so when i look in the mirror of the word then what is it going to do it's going to tell me the truth it's going to show me where i fall short and it's also going to show me where i meet what i think right but it's going to be according to the word now the mirror of the word rather than what i had in my head amen if we can use the word as a mirror we can see enough of the carnality that our only focus our only concern is to seek god out and have him change that ugliness into his perfect image amen to get the carnality out of that mirror and put in christ instead amen like i said a scope is used on other people and when i hear people talking and it's always they they they they and never me me me me when it comes to change that's when i know the scope is on somebody else the word has been used as a scope on a rifle to take other people accountable but not hold yourself accountable to the same thing amen when everyone else is off the word the word has been used as a scope not as a mirror because all of us have fallen we've come short of the glory of god amen amen we've got to be raised up into it i'd rather use it as a mirror than as a scope amen let's all stand together if we would amen i want to ask you is the word your mirror or is the word your scope i think if we were a little bit honest we'd say a little bit of both sometimes you know because sometimes what happens is we get a little dry we get a little crusty we get a little formal we don't have a prayer life where it's meant to be we're not reading the word the way we're supposed to and all of a sudden what we do is we start looking at other people because it's so uncomfortable to look in the mirror and see the reality that is looking back at us amen to where we're not where we ought to be so we'd rather focus on somebody else for a while i mean we don't want to use the word as a scope we want to use it as a mirror amen we don't point out weaknesses in each other what we do is we point to the word and say there is a remedy and then there's a place to go there's a person to go to not a place there's a person there's a reality there's a life there that'll take you from where you are to where you need to be and i'm telling you that because i've been there i was that and now i'm not and that's not me that did it that's christ that did it in the amen and then we point people to the shed blood of calvary we point them to a holy ghost that can make you live a life that you never thought you could live that can take the word standard and take it into your life to the point that you cannot only live it but your very desires will call for it as well in your own life amen amen we want the word as a mirror not as a scope let's bow our head heavenly father lord a challenging service this morning lord for me personally and i'm sure for each one listening and lord if i've been too hard lord if i've said it in a way that would lord cause someone to be offended lord i pray you forgive me lord help them to have grace for it to see that my heart lord is to get us all closer to you lord we're not looking to draw anyone to me we're not looking to make anybody line up by brute force lord but we want to encourage each other along this path lord that takes us into a

you'll give us that joy unspeakable lord that will never be taken away from us lord lift your people up lord as we examine ourselves lord may we just look in your word again as a mirror lord not look to the left or the right not to another brother or sister but lord to look at ourselves and say lord do we line up with your word and lord where we don't may we open the door why lord to let that water of the word wash it out lord to let the fire of your holy spirit burn out that carnality lord that humanity lord and fill it with the reality of a living word in our life of a living god that lives and breathes inside of us we pray but touch your people bless us we ask in your name we pray amen let's sing that song make me a servant humble and meek [Music] make a servant [Music] lord let
