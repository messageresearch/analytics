great since my soul a man I'll raid thou art yes thank you Jesus bracelet already man today raise our [Applause] praise the Lord a Mandalore delicious amen and we thank the Lord for the opportunity to gather in spirit amen there very few here when it comes to the physical beans but again we trust that most of them are on line and that their spirit is with us and that they're getting into the spirit of worship and getting into the spirit ready to receive the word as our brother Steven coffee comes to minister of the word and again does understand the importance of hearing the word because the Bible says that faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word he meant so that we want to get the true revelation as God wants us to have it and how God wants us to have it praise the Lord it's amazing right from the beginning right on down to this end the brother God has used the same thing to give us faith and that's the word a man the Satan challenges us challenges our faith a man to try to get us to compromise on the word but we're going to stay with the word stay with the word that our brother Jonathan Khaled preached we're going to stay with the word that our brother Steven copy will minister to us today and we thank the Lord amen again for the technology that that we have so that our brother Steven so so many miles away that he could be with us in worship and in the going forth of the word amen and that we could sit here and listen to our brother in the United States and watch our brother in the United States minister the word so God's grace to be with us brothers and sisters and God's grace be with those online a man to God be the glory and also when it comes to prayer I believe our brother onic is still in need of prayer and understand that he had a problem maybe fell or something in the earth is back and according to the prayer request last night that he was he was lying in bed so because of pain so the grace of God be with our brother onic today and maybe the trust that there's in tuned to the hearing of the word and God I pray by the word will give us the faith a man to believe that that brother Han ik was healed with the stripes that Jesus for a mayor to God be the glory please we've got to believe we've got to believe there's the promise if you can't believe for healing how you going to believe for the rapture so we got to believe it every day keep claiming the promise every day the devil is there to challenge it but it's all right faith is there to challenge the devil a man and we're not going to believe Satan we're gonna believe the promise amen regardless of how you feel what you feel they leave the promise amen and we pray the grace of God to continue with brother Mark and and I know the sister Maureen concerning the COFF and maybe the touch of the flu we just leave that with the Lord amen we got the victory amen we are more than conquerors by the grace of Almighty God Jesus laid down his life for us he picked it up again and shared it with us amen so praise the Lord just saying the devil could the devil challenge Jesus our brother Jonathan was bringing it out he challenged Jesus and now brother because Jesus is in you he's challenging us amen get thee behind me Satan praise the name of the Lord regardless of feelings no doubt Jesus felt hungry any man oh you after what he was a hundred but but he didn't he didn't give in to his weakness amen he stayed with the word will of God and God bless our Stephen coffee as he comes to minister to us the word amen and we certainly welcome our brother and maybe trust us some day the Lord will bring him bring him from the States and literally and physically back to st. John's again and we'll have our brother minister to us again so this being prayer as our brother comes to minister the word and let's believe that it's not our brother Stephen coffee it's the Lord they met you got a the problem of God said with oh my said this is not me he said this is Jesus he said I got to get myself out of the way so he can do this where brother if the father God had to do that when it comes to the signs and the wonders of a prophets ministry brother the ministry got to do it amen to get out of the way that Jesus came come and minister the word through the ministry a man and we got to get out of the way to let Jesus come received the word a man through those that are hearing the word so praise the name of the Lord God's grace be with us during this time and again we're living in a tremendous time when it comes to the pandemic when it comes to the coronavirus and what's going on and just recently he might even last night that I saw the headline on the internet and it says it's the end of the world but to them is the end of the world as it was it's the end of the world that we are used to because they feel that after all this is over he said we're going to live in a new world well by the grace of God were looking for a new heaven and a new earth amen so brother God is allowing this for a reason how God helped us to look up because our Redemption draweth nigh because this is the sign of the end so God's grace to us in the going forth of the word today and I want to express thanks to sister Kimberly for the buns that she made us and and the cards of course that our brother Paul delivered to us and today and the cards were from Oh sister else's cards in the window at the condo he said put it in the window so we left it in the window but we also have a card here from Levi and no not Levi this and once this one is from brother Jeremiah and sister Mary Beth so god bless them and it speaks of rejoice because he has risen amen so god bless Jeremiah and Mary Beth today and to ink them for the card thank sister Elsa for the card that she gave us amen and it was right you could see through it a man you put it in the window you see more of it by the grace of God and this is from brother Levi He is risen indeed amen brother he sir is a testimony of the amazing grace of God amen what God did to save us what God did to deliver us in laying down his life and then come back picked it up and come back to with us and this from brother Levi to brother Gerald sister Betty he is risen indeed a man and the thoughts on the envelope it says to brother Gerald and sister Betty rejoice rejoice o Christian lift up your voice and sing eternal hallelujah to Jesus Christ the King I trust he's the king of our lives he's our Lord our Savior our king and the hope of all is seek Him the help of all who find none other is so loving so good and kind he lives he lives Christ Jesus lives today and they stated happy resurrection and he close he cities oh yeah it was just not sure what it is so solicitors glass curd for the window that's the one I put in the window amen so god bless brother Paul and his family and again sister Kimberly for what she did amen so to God be the glory and thank our sister Priscilla and sister Maureen for singing and worshiping a man to God be the glory we're going to turn to our brother Steven and so thankful that our brother consented to minister to us online amen and again let's let the same spirit that would be with us here and the anointing in this assembly and on the Saints online pray that same anointing and power be with our brother Steven as he comes to Minister the Word of God and I'll leave you with a quote as we turn it to our brother Steven our brother Jonathan was preaching on overcoming and in the message out can I overcome just a short quote here and the puppet of God said the thing you have to overcome is yourself and he says you have to overcome your ideas and your things and surrender yourself to him and that's the truth because the devil is challenging us with our feelings but God wants us to lay aside feelings and go by faith and it says he'll were come for you he knows the way we don't so he said the hour is late very late and you do have good intentions but be cut inside now don't struggle just yield yourself to him and walk on with a perfect satisfied faith that what God has promised he's able to perform amen let's believe it that God will bless our brother Stephen as he comes to minister of the word to us amen and once buddies God's intention what is God's purpose is to increase our faith amen through the word through our brother Stephen coffee so god bless them and of course they're under the same conditions that were under here and they're only so many allowed in a church and I understand that Brian and I witnessed it online that our brother Barry coffee is ministering from his office a man sitting in his office of preaching to the people online so god bless us brother let's make sure that our faiths make our new table is an hour - what is an hour to make your calling and election sure you don't assume this don't assume that now you got to make it sure Amen because things are going to get worse so make sure that you that you have that calling that election of Christ in our hearts and in our souls god bless amen maybe I was going to sing but because of the time is getting well they're our turn to our brother Stephen god bless yes Amen god bless brother Stephen well hello everybody and good morning it's it's nice to be able to do this with you and to be able to meet with you however a long distance it may be so like to say a happy Easter to each one of you and whether or not you're in the sanctuary or you're at home happy Easter it's great to be together and I'd like to thank brother Gerald and the rest of the church for allowing me to speak this morning no matter how many times we do a digital service it seems a bit unusual so god bless the the assembly for making it so that we can all meet together I think I'd like to thank brother Darrell for a round and making the decision to meet digitally and not for everybody to get together it seems like a very contradictory thing for believer because the Bible says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together but we're not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together you can't break one scripture while following another so we are gathering together and we're also abiding by the laws of the land which the scripture tells us to do and we're also being wise and prudent the scripture tells us to do and protecting one another protecting those without the church so it's a hard decision to do that but we are assembling ourselves together I think the the people at the zoom headquarters and the Skype headquarters they had no idea what what they were doing and I believe it was the Lord that put the idea into their heads and they probably didn't have any idea what they were doing and now here we are using it I think brother Branham used conferencing and he had a phone hook-up and if he is if he was here today I think for sure he'd be using zoom or Skype or something and I believe video conferencing was actually developed in like the 1920s and call me crazy but I think it was developed just for the bride for these few months just so that we could keep meeting and yeah it's great in business and it's great for family and to be able to talk and friends and things like that but I'm so thankful that we can all be together digitally and and be able to meet and still assemble ourselves together in however strange away it may be in come together so I'm just thankful for brother Gerald letting me speak here today and it's a challenge following brother Jones sermons that he preached Friday and Saturday was a tremendous topic and tremendous service and it's actually the first time I'd ever heard brother John speak so I can't wait to see him in person and do that but I'm glad to be glad to be able to talk to you this morning I'll be honest I was feeling a little bit unusual in my heart this this week as I was preparing for this and just going over the different things that the Lord was putting on my heart and just considering how unusual a time it is and I think you know I'm just I'm tired of as I'm sure you are I'm tired of seeing all the headlines and I'm tired of talking about the coronavirus everybody you know I've got several friends who are who have it I know several believers who had who have had it and gone through it who are currently dealing with it and it's a it's a challenging time in the world for sure but um let's I'm just tired of hearing of it I think I think we have a greater hope and I would say this as well fear is fear is a valueless element there's there's there's nothing to it fear is something that may or may not happen so it's different than being wise and being prudent it's something that may or may not happen there is great value in faith I mean there's there's great great value in holding to something that's certain something that's true it's faith is the evidence of things that is not seen and the substance of the very things that we hope for so fear is fabulous there's nothing to it and the whole the whole of society is wrapped up in fear and I just think for a believer and for us inside of Christ looking out at the rest of the world in the condition that it's in its Laodicea I mean what else did what else do we expect from a time like this it's almost like it doesn't it doesn't even shock me you know being able to go into the grocery store and seeing everything almost completely off the shelves that's kind of new I guess you know but I guess just just from a believer looking out there's there's so much that we have to look forward to in Christ and faith is of great value you in a tongue like this fear is valueless there's nothing to it so I'm thankful that we have something that we can we can hold to this morning on this Easter morning and we can say Lord we believe in you and we believe in your the promise that you gave us a promise that is beyond anything that this life can throw at us that's what we hold to if you would let's pray so just wherever you are if let's just bow our heads and pray together Heavenly Father we thank you for for this morning we thank you for spring time in order we thank you for most importantly what this day represents to the Christian the resurrection or without it we would be nothing but with it Lord we are heirs of the promise and Lord we love you and we thank you so much and I pray that you would just keep us in your hands today lord I pray that you bless the Assembly wherever they are if they're in their living rooms if they're in the church wherever they may be lord I pray that you you just anoint them with the Holy Ghost this morning and for the rest of this day and as unusual and Easter as the is may it be the best one that we've ever had the Lord we thank you for our families we thank you for our friends and what we thank you for the opportunity to be able to spend time with our families to almost be locked in together with them Lord we want to take advantage of this time and and and we know that you've allowed it for a reason so Lord we love you and we thank you so much less than our time together this morning and bless all those that are assembling together and your name do we pray amen well if you can if you have your Bible I'd like to read two passages of Scripture so if you can turn to Joel chapter 2 in verse 25 very familiar passage of Scripture and almost a scripture that is synonymous with that with Easter morning but I wanted to read this so the book of Joel knew Bible leaders it's the book of Daniel and Hosea and Joel I I wanted to read up just a passage of scripture here in verse 25 so Joel chapter 2 in verse 25 and I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the polymer worm my great army which I sent to you and he shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that help that have dealt wondrously with you my people shall never be ashamed if you would let's go to one other scripture keep your finger there in Joel and let's go to Deuteronomy chapter 31 Deuteronomy chapter 31 and I'd like to read a verse we didn't verse 6 and this is a Moses last really one of the last consultations that Moses has with Joshua and with his is his priests and his Levites and so he's he's he's telling them different things consider on me chapter verse 31 chapter 31 and verse 6 be strong and of a good courage fear not nor be afraid of them for the LORD thy God he it is that doeth that death go with thee and he will not fail thee nor forsake thee I love that scripture you know I was thinking I don't know about you but springtime and Easter weekend is my favorite time of year it's always been it's my favorite time of year the Song of Solomon I believe chapter 2 it says behold the winter has passed and the rain is over and gone and the flowers appeareth on the earth and that the time of the singing of the birds is come and the voice of the dove is heard in our land and I think every new Philander rejoices more on that scripture that behold winter has passed and and the flowers appear on the earth but Easter time to me I I that just personally I'm in a more optimistic type of person this is the way I am and I guess springtime is the upward swing from winter and to me it's an optimistic time and it there's just a lot of potential there in springtime and in the world right now even the bride the church we're experiencing the effects of a fallen world that's wrought with fear it's just covered in fear and and it's covered in disease for that matter and it's it's a trying time for sure and it's an it's I honestly it's an abnormal time no time in history has everybody been told to stay home collectively as a society or globally and but even in the midst of that in this abnormal time and the hardships that this present world presents it's still springtime and we still have that to look forward to and it's gonna be summer and the flowers are gonna come we're going to be able to plant things and do all that and I love that and this may be this may be a little bit overly introspective or cheesy call it what you like but I was thinking of Easter and how unusual and Easter it is and there has if you look back so I calculated it just because I'm a numbers guy there's been approximately 1987 Easter mornings since Christ's death and resurrection so if you account his death in the year in his 33rd year there's been approximately 1987 sermons on Easter morning that's a lot of sermons that's a lot of that's a lot of Easter morning's and I was thinking on on all of that time all that the true church has experienced in that time and it's really just the bat of an eye for the Lord but for us all that that God has brought his church through and all that has happened in that time if you look at Martin Luther and you look over the span of his life if you look at John Wesley in the span of his life you go back in Calamba and Iranian the Apostle Paul even and all of the church messengers and you look at all of their lives in the span of their lives and all of the Easter morning's that have occurred in that time since Christ's resurrection there's there's been a lot of Easter that we've gone through and all the people that have lived and died all of the believers all over the historical events if you just step back almost zoom back and examine that expanse of time and then as it almost naturally for the believer as brother John read and believed Deuteronomy chapter 8 last night remember all the things that the Lord has brought you through to bring you to this point in time and all that has transpired and you know I was thinking just just personally as I was as I was looking over that expanse of history and thinking about all of those eastern warnings I believe just personally as though as I was going through it I believe that I'm in Christ Church I believe I have the Holy Ghost and as a little illegitimate of a child as I may feel as poor a member of his church as I am my faith is in what Christ did for me 1987 morning's ago and that assures me otherwise that I am in his church I am a child of God and I'm here in 2020 and I've been redeemed and I'm one of the few and I I just I think all that time all the things that have occurred and now we're at this present time in history and we're not we know we're not allowed to look into the future we know our future we know our end but we don't know what the next few weeks what the next few months will hold we are looking to his promise we know the very next thing to happen is the rapture and we're just at that point in time where it's the end times where we're experiencing a true restoration of the bride tree as brother Branham preached it in in 1962 and we were at a point in time in 2020 and we really are the Church of the Living God I heard an announcer say the Saturday because of the stock exchange rally that happened this past week and it says that he said something to the effect of the stock exchange at rally that we've had it shows that as a nation we have hope and I was thinking oh man just a hope that song this is just hope will not do I must be firmly decided and I would say to you this morning as a believer a Christian living in Satan's Eden on this day this Easter Day in 2020 you are you are the living proof that someone can do all things through Christ who strengthens strengthens them you you living in today on on April 12th 2020 you personally are the living proof you're a living manifestation of the scripture when it says you can do all things through Christ who strengthens you I genuinely believe that nobody's perfect you have things that are yet to be worked on you you might he might be just as crazy as the next person and have strange ideas strange opinions you might be more impatient than the next one we're all different were all unique we're all just as strange as the next guy or girl we we you know but for what for whatever we are at this point in time God saw fit for you personally to be alive today in this time and you are enduring the hardships of a Christian life you're believing in him you're believing that that his blood is what covers your past sin and some of you may still think to this day having been in the message for I don't know 30 years 20 years you may you may still think how on earth could the blood of Jesus Christ actually cover my sin and that may still a question you and I don't think well ever fully understand that but you believe it anyways you believe it anyways and you're here you're still doing it you're still pressing on in 1987 Easter's later there's still a people who are holding to the truth and the truth that they have been assured of which is what the scripture says they said hold to that which you have been as short of that which you know is the truth and I'll tell you you you believe it essentially and what I'm trying to say by all of that is that you in your of fallen flesh even you in your imperfect state that you are in you who hold to the truth who know where you stand with the Lord you are what true restoration looks like I really believe that and if you just think from a minute now because we really have to shift our thinking to to accept that because we look at ourselves and we look at our rights and our wrongs and we have we almost have a counter of I've done this right I've done that wrong I've got this to work on I've got that to get away the Lord delivered me of this I got to get this we have that mindset and just if you shift your thinking just for a second you essentially in your imperfect state you are what true restoration looks like a brother just passed away in our in our in our church recently a couple weeks ago and he was a good fella good old soul and I was even thinking as we were doing the funeral for this brother back to my grandmother who died at a year about a year and a half ago now and I was thinking of her and of this brother and when they died and I was just I can I was you know just looking at them and their family and I can still picture looking over the congregation and the casket in front as I was preaching funerals of these two individuals you know I'm just thinking in their own estimation when they passed away in their estimation they were probably not where they thought they needed to be with the Lord they probably thought I am NOT near where I need to be with the Lord I don't you know I don't I don't got this to work I've got that to work on I know where I'm going when I die but I don't feel like I'm ready to go just upon upon my actions alone and if you if you think about it according to God's view of what they were they were ready to go so their own estimation of who they were they they didn't feel like they were ready to go ready to go at all but they were in God's eyes and it goes back to it's a scriptural principle if you go back to the tune of Israel when the twelve spies went over and they they came back and they said we look like grasshoppers and Caleb and Joshua they said hey that may be the case but we are more than able to take them so those other 10 spies in their own estimation they were looking at themselves and they were thinking we are not able to take the land we can't do that and we're if we're not it's just it's just too much and Joshua and Caleb they look beyond their own ability and they understood the promise of God and they held to the promise of God regardless of what they were in their present state regardless of their inability and with their own physical ability to to take over and possess the land they knew that they didn't have the physical ability but they were looking beyond to the promise of God they they rested their faith in the promise of God and that's exactly what I think this brother who's a good Christian brother and my grandmother they did in their own lives they they placed their faith beyond their own ability to achieve something which it's an innately in a man to which to want to achieve something and want to achieve their own idea of perfection but they look beyond that to God's promise of a restoration and they had their the earnest of their inheritance was the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost made that promise of reality and I think it behooves all of us this morning and what I wanted to encourage you to think about is is something that you already know but it's God will be working on you until the rapture or your time to go but God's promise of his church his restoration and when I when I think of you and I was I was thinking of everybody in the assembly this morning and for the Gerald and just I wish I could be there in the sanctuary today I know we all feel that way but I was just thinking of each one of you and I'm thinking that's you are the image of what restoration looks like in this day and age and I want to talk about that just for a little bit and it's really hard to wrap our head around that because Satan doesn't want you to know this and as the is the quote that brother John read last night you have when when the church knows who she is that's when the rapture will go when that revelation when everybody's in harmony with the understanding of who they are that's when the rapture will go and that's that's my favorite I think but I think the most referenced quote of all time at least for me and that's so true when you know who you are then you'll go and Satan does not want you to know who you are and he certainly doesn't want you to meditate on who you are and you as a believing professing Holy Ghost filled believer mistakes and all is what true restoration looks like in this day and age if you look now in the scripture in Joel 2:25 then this is a very familiar scripture and this is a scripture that father Brennan read out of in in the restoration of the bride tree and I will restore and the multiple other sermons that he used to preach about this subject and I feel like this morning as I was just reading this as I was listening to the wonderful special and things like that and I wish you guys would just make an album and on to marine and Priscilla and whoever else is there you guys just need to make an album and then do it quick because we all we all want that it was a beautiful special and I was just listening to the singing and Uncle Mark leading the worship there about the scripture and it's almost like this scripture is just I'm coming right through the pages and speaking to you personally as an individual so whether or not you're in the sanctuary or whether or not you're in your living room at home or wherever you may be the scripture is and the promise is I will restore to you and he's singling you out and I think again innately we have a problem because we look at ourselves and we begin think am I am I really what restoration looks like because this is this is really sad and Laura are you sure I mean I I mean I I know you love me and I know that I believe the message and I know that you know I I have the Holy Ghost and things like that but is this it is this what restoration really looks like and I find it interesting as well if you go back in the scripture and you look at the great patriarchs of of the Bible and you look at their individual resumes and their individual histories we wouldn't think if they came off the street we wouldn't let one of them be an officer in our church think about Abraham if you just took his resume now and Abraham was one to be a deacon in the church he wanted to be a you know a pastor of the church and we just looked at his history in his resume we could say well all now you're God's chosen and everything like that but what is this whole thing about just deceiving and and saying that your wife was actually not your wife and actually being willing for another man to marry him marry her what what was that all about or you take Moses and you say okay you're you led God's people through the wilderness what was this thing about murder your younger years and you still have a there was a scene in the wilderness when you hit a rock out of anger when God told you not to you just told you to do something else it was a murderer and if we looked at just his past if we looked at just his resume you would think there's no way in the world I'd let that guy be in our church as a vote him in as a pastor or something like that you look at reixach Rahab the the bear of Christ front bloodline and she was a prostitute and if we looked again just in her resume or David the king of Israel deception in killing a woman allowing a woman's husband to be killed so that he could take her know his own house and then we we give ourselves a hard time and we look at ourselves in and and we think and yes we should be examining ourselves according to the scripture that's not one of them that's not what I'm talking about but if in our own estimation of who we are in this time if we allow ourselves just to look at our past and allow a realization in our identification of who we are in Christ right now to be controlled by who we were or what what Satan did in our past then we're never gonna be able to get any farther with Christ I think as believers as in this this day today April 12 2020 I just felt it on my heart to encourage you to really look at who you are in Christ and to realize you are what restoration looks like it's not because of your if your your past or how perfect you are it's not because of your own estimation of what you think you are or what you what you have yet to work on all of us have things to work on all of us have have difficult situations and many are the afflictions of the righteous many of us have you know some of us may have tempers some of us may be more opinionated than others some of us may have a looser tongue than others that's a given we live in falling bodies we're gonna have that until the rapture but in God's eyes a people who hold to the message of the hour the people who hold to who Christ is and they're allowing the word to be made known in their lives in this day in the midst of Satan's Eden in the midst of the Laodicean Church age and you stand for that you are God's idea of restoration I love that now if you go back just on a just even on a personal level because I believe that God can restore us personally he there's an anointing that is on every age and within that anointing the bride will produce what she is supposed to produce God regulates the the bride to meet the season that she is in so he doesn't regulate the season to meet the bride she regulates the bride to meet the season that you're in because he has everything working according to His perfect will everything that is scripturally determined to happen will happen and he regulates your ability to meet the season that you are in tell me we look at the world when we look at the place at its at we look at just how hard it is to scratch a living from the face of the earth look at all these different things we look at the face of our companies and the economy and all these things God regulates our ability to meet the season that we are in so you don't have to worry about whether or not you can handle it he's already given you what you need to handle it and I realize I'm speaking very simply this morning but that's that's on purpose you you have everything inside of you that you need to meet the season that you are in you have everything that you need to raise your family in in the correct way you don't need to worry about it worrying is valueless it's something that may or may not happen so stop worrying about that and rather focus on faith because there is great value in faith because it's the evidence of the things that you don't see it's that it's the very substance of the things that we hope for but it's not good enough just a hope you have to be firmly decided and I think that's what that's what God is looking for you are the redeemed you are you you've made it this far and if you've made it this far he will he will help you make it the rest of the way if God has brought you this far then don't worry it's valueless have the faith to believe that you'll make it the rest of the way regardless of what the world throws at you regardless of the hardship that you will endure it's a hard life a Christian life is our life you can make it because God as he says in Romans 12 he's given you the measure of faith so abide in the in the measure of faith that God has given you so he's given you the exact amount of faith that you need to overcome that which he has given you to overcome you don't have to agree about that at all I was thinking of just in terms of what restoration actually looks like because we have this idea of God is restoring the the bride tree and you know I think in our own minds and maybe this is just me I don't know but maybe the tendency is to think of oh I've got to be something I've got this image of what I want to be and it's more perfect than within what I am right now and I think that that as God leads through the Christian journey he he helps us overcome the things that we see in our own lives he helps us to realize that his power is real and just the same as it was yesterday is it can be today in helping us overcome the things that we struggle with and I believe that that we need to to allow that to happen but just as in a personal restoration as God has the anointing over his bride in this age to accomplish that which she has been ordained to accomplish you know personal lives he is also restored us as well and if you look at Luke chapter 8 and verse 26 and I think it starts at verse 26 jesus and his disciples they come across the sea and they're there and they land on they land on the on the bank and then they're walking up to the land of the Garcinia which is also known as Ghaderi so they're walking along the path and I love this story Jesus and His disciples are walking along the path and then all of a sudden a naked man jumps out in front of them and I think you know if you're if you you know that may not be very odd at Newfoundland I don't know but in in North Carolina in rural North Carolina and people don't typically do that so I can imagine just the shock that must have happened and the disciples were probably you know thinking what's going on and then Jesus was there and everything like that and this man jumped out at him and the the discourse that begins to take place this man had he ran the hills naked he was in the tombs he was known as the maniac of Ghaderi and he was there and the Devils immediately knew who Jesus was and it's almost like they didn't even talk about anything else they they they immediately said please don't cast us into the deep so they knew their own fate so this man was bound up by Legion himself he was just bound up with with such a a difficult thing and and then he Jesus prays for him the Devils are cast out he heals him and we know that the story that takes place and after he heals him he's sitting at the feet of Jesus and Jesus is talking to him and they you know the story that the castle Legion out he goes into the swimming line and goes down into the to the rocks and things like that and I think I think we passed by that area that they think that that happened and brother Joe was on that trip in Israel that when we did that I don't know if he remembers that and it was it was known as the place of Ghaderi and the garcinia --nz where the were there so that he was healed and he was just a miraculous healing because everyone in that town every one of the garcinia knew that this man was crazy and that nothing could help them they chained him hold him down and he break the chains which back time the change was pretty pretty hefty so he would break the chains and go out and the spirit would drive him out in the wilderness he was a crazy man he ran around naked and it was just a just a horrible thing so all of the people were aware of this man and brother branham said in several quotes he said he he had an old gray-headed mother who was at home praying for him so this man had family that was in Ghaderi and he was not able to be with his family because his spirit would drive him out of the wilderness and they can go crazy and it was Legion so Jesus cast Legion out and he's all gone and then the Garcinia to begin to come out of the city and begin to see what's going on because they began to hear it so they're all gathering around and then after a while they begin to get afraid because they see the guy that this they knew was a crazy man and they knew it was very dangerous so they see the guy and he's sitting at the feet of Jesus clothed like a normal guy and then they see Jesus they're preaching and they don't really know what's going on so it's almost like they couldn't digest it they just couldn't believe it and they saw it in with their very own eyes and they still couldn't accept it and I think that's what that's a a testimony to a believer that they they see it and when the word is made flesh they can still accept it and I you know if you go back in the scripture in in the Old Testament it was the word the law and and you know that that was that was the word and then in John chapter 1 it says the Word was made flesh and so the word was actually made flesh in Jesus Christ and they couldn't accept that transition of the word made flesh they could accept the test of the law they could accept the the word when it was in its former form but when God moved forward that's when they couldn't accept it and then in today's time in after the the resurrection which is a symbol of today after that time the word was made flesh then what did Jesus do he poured it into his bride so we see that the word was made into a the fullness of the Godhead bodily was made into a mini member bride so the word was made flesh again so when people see us at the the bride adhering to the Word of God and they see it even if you just take a simple scripture like first Corinthians 11 and a woman shouldn't cut her hair and they look at that and they see it in the end they know that the scripture says that and they still can't adhere to it they failed to make the transition they know that Jesus was the Word made flesh but then again they're still looking back and they can't look for it and they can't see it in there in the very own eyes and it was exactly like these people today they are in in in Ghaderi they could not they could not accept this so Jesus leaves he goes across the sea and heals gyruss his daughter it says very next thing that happened so he goes across and there's another healing on the other side of Galilee but for right now he's there and the man who was healed he looks at Jesus and he says can I follow you can I come with you so he asks to do the very thing that the rich young ruler refused to do when he was told to do that by Jesus this man actually asks and he said Lord can I follow you can I be a disciple let me come with you I mean my whole life is just Rek let me come with you and brother branham said that he you know maybe he had a drinking problem maybe we can begin to drink and that's what drove him out and eventual out the spirits to get get ahold of him and now he's standing and he's restored so he's healing which was a atoned for on the cross but when Jesus the very word healed him and in polled Legion Al he was standing there fully restored in his restored state and he said now Lord I want to follow you and Jesus said no absolutely not so what I want you to do is use turn around and I want you to go go back home I want you to go back and live among the Garcinia I want you to go back to guard era Ghaderi and I want you to live a normal life and the scripture says I want you to proclaim that which you have seen and that word proclaim in the Greek it means I think it means to prou clear I think my Greek is a little rusty but it's he says in other words that the definition of that word means to preach so he says I want you to go back live a normal life and I want you to preach to the Garcinia that which has happened to you now think about it for a second because Jesus says I don't want you to follow me I want you to go back and live a normal life and then he leaves because the people drive him out they basically said hey we don't want you around get out here so he goes across Galilee and this man then has to go home in other words Jesus he he pulls him out of his current condition he changes him heals him he restores him and then he sends him right back out into the the town that refused him and that it couldn't help him and now he has to live a normal life and go on testifying as to what Jesus Christ did to him so that he has to basically go and live a normal life with the people that just sent Jesus away that's a challenging place to be and if you think about it he says do this he's telling him to live a normal life imagine now after Ghaderi I mean we see that in the maniac of Ghaderi but think about that May life after he was restored he basically had to go to the supermarket he had to go back and go to his home he had to go find a trade or work or go back to his work he had to go back to his family think about the first time that he was walking just a pair of rice if he was walking through the supermarket and he's I mean you know people are looking at him and saying is that the guy that ran naked through the tombs I mean he can imagine how awkward of a life that would be and I mean even if even then in the historical sense in in those times and you know the the the harsh reality of living in those times in those days it would still be extremely awkward to see him at the well or whoever it may have been and to say that's the guy that was a crazy man that was you know going out over all these places that's what restoration looked like he had been transformed he had been renewed as the scripture says behold all things are made new and those who are in Christ old things are passed away and that's exactly what it was like so for him living in Ghaderi he is but he had been restored in a physical sense and that was what restoration looked like was a normal life people looking at him kind of weird and God sent him right Jesus sent him right back into the place of great challenge and great difficulty and said go live a normal life tell people what happened to you in the lively over the last time I was in New Zealand I preached about that how God pulls us out of laodicea he pulls us out of Babylon he says come out of her my people and then he changes you in what in and in and completely renews you and it's that it's his power to transform his brother branham said and then he turns you right around and sends you right back into the world with a commission says now go and preach the gospel every tongue a nation so he changes you brings you into his church and then he turns you right back out and says now go live a normal life go tell people what I've done for you go tell people about Who I am and what it means to live free I love that that's what restoration look like now that's even in a cross since if you go back even further as brother John was talking about last night the children of Israel in in the promised land in possession and what it means to be an overcomer and and the answer that an overcomer has if you explained it if you just expand and look over Israel's time they came out of Egypt they went through the wilderness and then as they go into the Promised Land the Promised Land is not that the is not heaven the Promised Land does not represent heaven because it was the holy ghost working through his people to possess the land so Joshua and his people possessing the land and they were going there was Wars there were famines there were all kinds of different things going on that cannot represent heaven that was a precursor to heaven but they were restored so scripture if you really if you just look at it now the time is very similar to where we are now in history 1987 Easter's later we're standing in 2022 or 2020 and we're seeing that we are the restored we've been brought back to where God wants us to be and I think it now if you look at it in terms of the wheat and the analogy of a wheat plant we are in a time of history where the fruit is is is which is God's very own life his Spirit is on the vine so it's it's not a growing season according to Scripture it's a ripening season so if you take that if you take the analogy of the wheat and we look at this and we see that Israel just to bring that in they went through all the the things that they went through came out of Egypt through the wilderness and then they were in the land and they spent time in the land possessing so they were restored to where they were supposed to be and in that there was a great challenge that was great difficulty they had to possess that that position so they they came back to who they were supposed to be and they had to possess it now if you look at the the analogy the wheat and you expand it across the church ages you see that the the seed goes into the ground and then it comes up and then the stock and in that you see the wheat plant it comes up it comes out of the ground it goes up and then you go into the tassel and you go and I'm not a farmer so I'd know it I've just gone through my knowledge of what this is but you go through this the the husk and then you have the fruit so then you have the seed on the outside of the husk so it goes through a growing season and then you have the seed that is on the vine so you have the fruit that is on the vine which is the original original seed so it's exactly the same life that was on the inside it goes out to the outside can you see that all throughout that time was growing but it wasn't the fruit so the harvest time which is where we are right now is a ripening season because the food is on the vine the stalk in the in the shed the the husk they don't ripen there's no there's nothing to ripen they're not mature they are growing so all throughout the church ages you see God's church is growing and they're growing in the growing they held the life at one time and then all of a sudden they get up to the to the fruit and this the the seed is on the the food is on the bond the fruit is what ripens so it matures so it's it's what it's the original seed it's what God intended so it's restored - it's real - it's real position but it has to lay out in the presence of the Sun in order to ripen the fruit so it's a maturing season as we await the harvest so it is harvest season but the only thing that the the the farmer is waiting for it's like the farm that goes out into the farmer goes out into the field and he puts if he can put a dent in the wheat he knows that it's ready for harvest so he's there and he puts the little dent in the harvest and in the seed and he knows it's us it's it's harvest time it's it is the time for the harvest but there is a season when the fruit is laying on the vine and it matures and it ripens and that's exactly what's happening right now so you look at this this is what this is the time of restoration God has brought you back to a place where you hold to the unadulterated Word of God and he's working in you his spirit is alive in you just as much as he was working in in Luther's time and when he was working on Luther in the different things that he was in the different places that he brought him to in his life to be able to bring to him the revelation of who he was in Christ that I am justified by my faith and then all him and he moves on to Wesley and Luther gets old and he goes off the scene and then Wesley he goes through English to America he helps the Indians and he goes back to England and he does all these different things and he's you know learning all the different things in in in seminary and all these different things he's doing God is leading him in his life and then you come up to the Pentecostal age and Azusa Street starts and all the different things it's happening he beats brother Brandon to where he is and the bird you know brings him up in Kentucky and then brings him all over the world and then brother Branham goes off the scene and then you have different believers popping up everywhere and then some of you were born and during that time or before that time and he's moved each one of you to different spots in your life and maybe he kept you on on the rock but he's led you to certain areas in your life I just think it's amazing that the moving of the Holy Spirit and all of those times although there's an anointing over the age that you are in so we moved from Luther's age to Wesley's age to the Pentecostal age - now the bride age that's when the fruit is on the vine and that is when it's ripening that's what's happening to you right now it's a harvest season and we're ready to be pulled up into the garner I think that's an amazing thing that's what restoration looks like and you are those people that are to be harvested you are those people that are there that God has placed there listen to this 1965 this is a few weeks before brother man would die and he says this and he starts to pray this is a lengthy quote but I want to read it he says this is not the day of Pentecost the Pentecost age is past Pentecost is gone this is the harvest time and the harvest time the grain the waters done been poured out the grains getting right come into the grain my dear brother hear me believe me if you believe me to be a servant of God let each one in your in our own way bow our head and humility and offer the prayer that we should offer God take me as I am and knowing that something has to follow that and he says this nation has been shipped back and forth or through revivals and indications and things like that he said knowing that something has to follow that and if you just skip down further past the quote he says dear God as he begins to pray it says do you God you've healed our sickness and you forgive our sins and Lord of not being the kind of Christian that we ought to be he said professing to be a full gospel man or woman and here we find ourselves slumping often to do not that like a denominational chicken it says help us dear God and take us and shake us with your Holy Spirit and if there be anything in us that's not like you take it out of us Lord and plant our feet on the on God's holy word and let the Holy Ghost burn down in our heart and take all the dross of unbelief and all the drowsiness of this day and all the Lord maybe will rise and shake ourselves granite God cleanse mold us make us God granted and if there's any in here tonight Lord that's holding in their heart that grain that gene of God that's ordained a life from the foundation of the world I know Lord that they're bound to hear it at this hour and so I pray God that you'll fill their soul illuminate them with the fresh baptism of the Holy Ghost and send them on their Road rejoicing and happy it's almost like brother Branham is saying to us the exact same thing that Jesus told the maniac of Ghaderi after something amazing and happened to him go on your way rejoicing and happy live a normal life and I want you to to proclaim that which I have shown you and here brother Branham is saying the exact same thing Lord I pray that you'd fill them and illuminate with them with the fresh baptism of the Holy Ghost and send them on the road rejoicing and happy see the anointing of the Holy Ghost in that age will produce everything that it needs to produce in the believer as Isaiah 55 says my word it shall not return unto me void so if you look at the bride tree itself in the heart of that of that tree is Christ its Christ very own life so in the bride Trina's as the church ages go the the the tree was eaten down by all the different the four stages of the of the kink of woman in the Palmer worm and the caterpillar and it was eaten down to the very core of that tree and Christ was at the core of that tree and what he's promised was I will restore to you again everything that was eaten down there will be a time in history when everything will be back in its place and the fruit will be on the vine and now it's that time 1987 East years later now it's that time and today is that time and you are living in that time I just think it's so awesome that we are sitting wherever you're sitting right now you're living in a time with an anointing over you that the Holy Ghost will produce everything in your life that it was supposed to produce and you're standing there the result of what restoration really looks like but we still all we sit back and we look at ourselves we think am I really what restoration looks like and God he changed you he formed you he his intention of you was formed before the foundation of the world and what you see yourself in as today in the fallen flesh you see all of your mistakes you think see all the things that you need to work on and God is holding to something that he already proclaimed over you before the foundation of the world so God is looking far beyond what would you see him yourself today and in your shortcomings in your issues he's looking at the promise that overrides what you think you need to be he's looking at the the promise of restoration he's looking at what the original seed was which is what it will be when the rapture comes he's looking at what you were before the foundation of the world and you look at yourself just on this day and say oh my I'm not what I need to be well of course you're not this is a time of ripening and maturing God wants to mold in you and mature you because character is a victory it's not a gift in character is the only thing that you're going to take with you on the other side so as we as I mentioned that the brother that passed away when he's laying there in the cast in his own estimation right before he died he said probably I nowhere near where I need to be but in God's eyes he was because God had brought him through all that he needed to be and there was an anointing over the age that that man had yielded himself to and said Lord let the Holy Spirit make in me what you want to see and as he as you go through life you will overcome because that's the anointing of a believer this time is to overcome is to possess as the children of Israel they got into the wilderness and they were possessing the land they were doing hard things that's what restoration looked like that's what it looks like and we have the earnest of our inheritance and God is looking at the promise that overrides us he's not necessarily looking at your faults and your shortcomings he is working on those because the Holy Spirit is is what the fruit that's on the tree is God at God's attributes and you were an attribute in God before the foundation of the world and so ensues because of the result of the fall so ensues the tug-of-war that happens at your mind in your mind and everything that you feel like you need to overcome this and it I feel like I need to do this and we absolutely do need to do that and we die daily on the basis we bring ourselves back because sanctification happens until the the change of our bodies but there isn't a group there is a greater anointing that is on top of you today as a result of being in the bride of Jesus Christ and adhering to the Word of God and placing your faith on that promise that is what eventually will come it's his word shall not return and invite and at the very center of that tree was Christ himself and now you are standing here as a result of the bride of Jesus Christ the grain isn't growing its ripening it's maturing that's what's happening right now it's been 55 years since brother Branham passed away the things like that John 15 and verse 5 it says I am the vine you are the branches and he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing and what is the fruit it's the Spirit of God it's the attributes of in your life so as a result of becoming the word made flesh which is what you are in this day you are the manifestation of the Holy Ghost you are God's expression his only method of expression is through you so that's why he says go along your way and live a happy joyous life go out and proclaim the gospel of who Jesus Christ is is because you are the Word made flesh you at the very center of that tree that has been restored is that which God was in this very core which was Christ himself the word and now you are the Word made flesh you are manifesting the very word of God in 1962 brother Panama he says in the restoration of the bride tree I said God planted his tree to bear spiritual fruit this the fruit of the Spirit is that right he says now what what did man do man always tries to make an artificial form of it he did back there he does now but let's fire hard now quick and and man has always tried to take the spiritual church and make it an artificial form what is God planted that tree what is the tree to do to show forth the fruits of the spirit now I don't think there's any other explanation of this and I mean there's so many but in my mind and what struck my heart and I don't know if I talked about this the last time I was there or not but Shamgar I don't think I I just I love this story and just in my heart and in my mind it all comes together so beautifully if you look at in judges chapter 3 I think it's verse 30 but verse 30 31 it wind sham gar and all it says is that there was this man and he flew 600 Philistines with an ox code and also delivered Israel and I think of that and I think oh my goodness if we if just before I mentioned that if you go if you look in Revelations 8 or 10 8 through 11 it says and I John heard the voice from heaven that spake unto me again and said go take the little book which is open in the hands of the angel which was which standeth upon the scene upon the earth John a representation of the bride he heard the angels say something to him and he had a revelation of what he was to do so he knew he knew what he was to do he goes up and he takes the book out of the hand of the angel and he eats enemy he consumes it it becomes a part of him and then it was in his belly bitter but it was in his mouth sweet as honey and then the angel didn't say stand says to him and go out and prophesy again to all the nations and to all the tongues so the John basically he takes the book now he keeps oh he understands and he catches the vision so he hears the angel say to him you have to take the book go up and take the book and it's exactly what's happened today because as a result of Malachi chapter 4 and revelations 10 7 something has happened to you that your heart something has happened in your heart where your faith is just the same as it was with the Apostolic fathers so if you look at yourself now and ask yourself the question what happened to you that your faith was turned back to the same faith the same just simple faith that the Apostolic fathers had in the resurrection of who Jesus Christ was and the adherence to the Word of God they saw the flesh they saw Jesus being made flesh and they they accepted it and today we see that the the word made flesh in our own lives and we have to accept that as well and something has happened turn my heart to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers something has happened for you to you to do that and it's happened and you cannot take that revelation away from me you cannot take the the fact that the Word of God is true and there's nothing else on this earth that is steady or that is solid or that I can place my faith on except for the basis of the Word of God and when I place my faith on the basis of the Word of God the Holy Spirit that can then come and work on that so when you hold to the scripture and you place your faith on that the Holy Spirit can quicken that in your life and it makes it a manifestation of who God is and so that's exactly what happened to John in in in the book go take the book something happened tell us to say I want the book I gotta go take the book I gotta know who I am in the book was the book of redemption it was it was the the who Christ was and who God made him in this day that's what the seals were is is the redemption story he told you who you were in Christ and if you go back even and just pull it back even simpler the revelation in it says it in crisis mystery of God revealed the new birth is the revelation of who Jesus Christ is to you so this revelation at John and it's the anointing over the age this revelation he said go take the book go you need to know who you are John took in any alien and he understood who it was so he caught the vision and that's exactly what's happened in today something has happened where we have the same faith that we can see in the pentacle and in the Apostolic fathers we have that same faith that adheres to the Word of God and is able to see the manifestation of the Holy Ghost and say that's the truth I want that I have to follow that it's exactly what's happened and that's what restoration looks like is it people not who are perfect because there hasn't been anybody perfect in the 1987 Eastern morning's under has it but anybody that's been perfect in that time but there have been a people who adhere to what they see in the Word of God and I and understand their identification in it and that's what God is looking for who is Jesus Christ to you personally and you adhere to that revelation of who he is it's not a revelation outside of the Bible it's a revelation of who you are in Christ which is the word and it's made flesh in this day because the word as we place our faith on the scripture and the Holy Spirit anoints that we aren't the very manifestation of the Living God in this day it says we are peculiar people so that we might show forth the praises of God I think that's amazing and so John caught the vision he understood who he was and then he he lived it so he ate it he actually took in and it became a part of him and then he proclaimed it now if you go back to Shamgar I love this because he's standing there and this is in the harvest season and he's got fruit on the vine and the 600 Philistines come up in in the in the place Shamgar was not a soldier he was not anybody to be recognized or anything like that he's just a normal Joe farm in his field sorry Joe he was just a normal man farming his field the the guys the Philistines which were a fierce force to be a force to be reckoned with they were standing up there 600 of them and he's got his family back here and so he's looking there and he says um and I I know what's coming so he can see the the situation unfolding and he looks back and he sees his family sitting on the front porch and he said they're gonna kill my family they're gonna take take this they're gonna take everybody else else's food and then they're gonna go and sow Shamgar is standing there and I love this because if you look at it in judges this is the portion of scripture in between the possession of the land and Samuel so this is in between Israel coming into whether where they have a king and the possession of the land so in between Joshua and Samuel you have this period of time called the judges so now Shamgar is in in the land they've possessed the land they're there where they need to be and he's still in the process of possessing land so God that there's a trial that comes and he's standing there and he realizes to himself I can either give this a shot or I can just run so though he understands now he says now listen this is a promise of God for us to be in this land so they keep in mind now there's an overriding promise over you as a believer and it's not just necessarily your your a daily ability to perform well there was an overriding scripture that that a promise that is is over the age and over you and his word God's word shall returning void and you are flesh of of that flesh bone of that bone you are a part of that word because it's inside of you behold all things are made new so you are now in that restoration because of an overriding promise that concerns you and so he said guard is standing there and he says now listen the law says that we are supposed to be here we are supposed to be here and those guys are not supposed to be here so he's in the land he's in a process of possession they have been restored and he's saying they are not supposed to be here and so he looked at his family yeah brother BAM explains the story a couple different ways I just love the paraphrasing of this story and he's got an ox coat with a little brass ball on the end of it and they come down he killed six Philistines they come down he's killed six Philistines in other words he's putting into action the faith that he has in that promise and that's what the fruit on the vine looks like a sickness comes you place your faith on the Word of God that he already healed you we just take into account so many times Wow I can't I can't do this I can't do that I can't overcome this I can't get rid of that I want to overcome this this person is annoying me that person is annoying me Baba Baba and we have all of these things at war in our mind being that Satan's playground but I in our hearts there's something that happened he turned the hearts back to the faith of the fathers so he's turned something back he's turned our our faith and as a result of the anointing in this age of the message of the hour something turned us back to a simple faith and adherence to the Word of God and adherence to what the Word made flesh looks like in our day and so we're standing here and the Holy Spirit coming down in you and your faith being applied to the scripture you have a sickness you have something and you look at description who says I am the lord that heals all our diseases that's something that is true that's a promise and every promise in the book is yours and if you think about it you already have been healed you already have over you don't fight from a position just like Shamgar shame guard they were promised that land so he already had won the victory he already knew that they were supposed to be there he gave Abraham that promise he gave Moses that promise they were already supposed to be there so it was beyond Shamgar estimation of his ability to take care of the situation but he still applied his faith to the Word of God and that allowed the Holy Ghost to work through him and the Holy Ghost consumed him and he killed every single one of those six hundred Philistines you today you as an individual as a restored message believer awaiting the fullness of your Redemption the the change of our bodies in that in the transition from this life to the next awaiting the rapture you as a restored individual in Christ do not fight from a place or do not fight for the victory you fight from a position of victory I heard a brother Barry say this a while back in the church in Hickory you don't fight for the victory you've already got the victory that's what it means to be restored that's why you don't have to worry is because faith is of great value you place your faith in the Word of God the word becomes flesh the word is manifested through your very life that is the expression of who Jesus Christ is in your life that is awesome that is God making himself known to do the rest of the world that is God allowing you to see yourself identified in Scripture you are that which is the fruit on the vine you are that which is the method of expression that God for a name before the foundation in the world you don't fight for victory you've hardly won the victory you fight from a position of victory and so therefore we apply our faith in the daily battles that we have we apply our faith in the daily short companies that we have which for some of us is more than others and we all have them we'll all continue to have them we apply our faith to the scripture and that our overriding anointing that promise that we have vindicates itself in our lives new fight of a position of victory you've already won it man it's exactly like Shamgar shame God placed his faith and he said ah the law says that God said that this is our land it's not theirs he placed his faith in that he fought and now he's proclaimed and all of Israel was delivered because of that one action hi I love that I love that and if you can hold that in your heart and say Lord it's not it's not because of my activation of Who I am it's not because I have achieved the level of perfection that I think I should be at it's because you already said I overcame to me that's what it that's what that's the result you believing that is the result of 1987 Easter mornings in April 12th 2020 and this is not this is not nonsense April 12 2020 all those times all all that history that's ensued you sit there a born-again Holy Ghost filled believer you are what restoration looks like we think oh my goodness I've got so much to work on well yeah if we all do we all will you need to rest your faith in the overriding promise for this age don't don't don't walk by sight it comes back to a very simple application of a very straightforward Scripture don't walk by sight you walk by faith you say well brother Steve I've got this problem in the church and I've got this problem with that church well yeah you you yeah yeah last time I checked the world is full of people and people produce more people so I think I think we'll continue to have a bra until until the the end time that's just the way it's gonna be but you have an overriding promise of who you are in Christ and the word is able to overcome everything that'sthat's thrown that everything that the world and man alone sends it you if you look at the description I was thinking of scripture in John chapter 11 when he told Martha that Martha said I believe that you are I believe that that Lazarus will rise again and jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life and he that believe on me though he were dead yet shall he live Lazarus believed that he was the Christ and and on top of that at Martha believed for him as well and that belief was more powerful than the grave so that belief was he last was dead and yet that belief that he was the Christ when Jesus spoke he came out of the grave because he believed on who he was and that was more powerful than the grave itself and what what what more is there what more evil is there than death itself in the separation and Jesus says I am the way I am the resurrection I am the life and though you were dead if the worst thing that could happen is though you were dead that belief in me overrides anything that that Satan has he's thrown away the keys to death and he'll you are the restoration of the bride tree and that's why I wanted to read that scripture in Deuteronomy 31 be strong and of good courage fear not nor be afraid of them for the Lord thy God is he that do that death go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake thee if the musicians want to get ready to sing and play I want to close it right there and I realized that this is just a very I like simple I like simple services so I'm not going to apologize for it at all I believe I believe that we need to take courage today and not just because of the coronavirus the chronovisor will go away and there'll be another one but you know and we look at the way that this is affecting our companies and our jobs and things like this I know several people even in my family and things like that people who have lost their jobs as a result of this I I think we need to take courage not just because of the current state of the world but because of what Satan is trying to get us to disbelieve or to get us stumbled in upon and that is the fact that I just love this 1987 Easter morning's later you're sitting there you are what restoration looks like this is the harvest time this is the time when the fruit is on the vine this is the time of maturing and ripening and that's what God is doing to me I don't know about you but I can look back over a year I can look back over six months and say man I am not the same guy I was back then I'm not the guy I want to be ain't what I ought to be ain't what I I should be but I sure ain't what I used to be it's brother Branham used to say he brought us he brought you this far if you look out over that expanse of history and dig me maybe you've only been alive for 60 years of that that time or of you know 30 years at that time I don't know but he brought to you this far he'll bring you the rest of the way you really have to believe that he'll bring you the rest of the way continue continue on be strong and be of good courage don't be afraid for the Lord is your God and he goes with you there is an overriding promise over you that no demon out of torment could ever take away from you no none of your personality could ever take away from you none of your own inability to overcome your personality could ever ever take away from you you have an overriding promise of the Holy Ghost of the word itself overriding this time and he regulates you to meet the season that you're in his word shall not return unto Him void you can receive you you can have that if he brought to you this far he'll bring you the rest of the way let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for this Easter morning thank you for the resurrection Lord and I don't think there's one individual who can say you know what I'm exactly what I need to be I am perfect there's nothing that can say that you're always going to be with us he promised that we all we need is the courage to keep going to put one foot in front of the other keep just to hold our feet in midair and say Lord where do you want me to put it down know what I pray just for each one in this assembly each one wherever they may be gathered if they're gathered at home lord help us to take courage help us to be encouraged by this - no it's not what I see in my own eyes it's what he saw before the foundation of the world and it's so true that's what I am that's what I am I'm a result of the restorative act of the Holy Ghost and even in my fallen flesh I am what restoration looks like Lord if there's any way if there's anything in our hearts or our lives or anything that we've neglected to confess or neglected to to put down at your altar Lord may we do it now may we do it now we ask that you'd make us just good simple Christians Lord what what you saw on us I don't know but you loved us and may we realize may we live today like we are loved may we live today like we are the redeemed because that's what you said were and Lord our belief will live far beyond the grave and I believe that you will you will honor that Lord and we wait we await the promises of God to be fulfilled but the ones that we can lay hold off Lord may we as a group of people just normal everyday people reach out and grab those promises and make them alive you are making the word made alive you've done it before Lord you've healed those who need healing Lord you've given those jobs who need jobs you've done you've done it or from from the time that you rose again and you'll continue to do that Lord to make yourself alive in your people we are people of your kingdom Lord and may we just spend the rest of this day with our families realizing that's who we are it's not my own view of myself although we need excel phix Ammon it's what you saw Lord we thank you for this promise today we commit ourselves to the name of the Lord Jesus Christ your name do we pray amen god bless you all and I hope you have a good rest here Easter and god bless you amen thank God for the word thank y'all for the leadership of the Holy Ghost in our brother but thank God for the for the brothers willingness to let go and let God have his way I was surprised when he was said he was gonna close I thought he would go on for another while they read so so he has that Liberty here to want for a couple of hours for sure thank God for the impression of the ministry is left in this assembly and that any preacher would feel at home amen so we thank God for the word that brother Steven brought a man and again maybe I could go on for a couple of hours because with the notes that that the Lord gave me as our brother was preaching so it's tremendous but I won't do that but I was blessed when he

wonderful to know that we're in the ripening bride age to God be the glory they ran and brother Ram violated I lighted the bride a H even in the even in the revelation of the seven seals and he said
