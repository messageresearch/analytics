[43:13] your word would come forth, Lord, it
[43:14] would go into our lives, into our very
[43:16] hearts and souls, Lord, discerning the
[43:18] needs, Lord, speaking where we're at,
[43:20] Lord, speaking life, speaking freedom,
[43:22] speaking healing, Lord, deliverance,
[43:24] whatever it may be this morning, Lord.
[43:26] We're looking to you as the great
[43:27] provider. Lord, bless your people, each
[43:29] one. Lord, bless those that the needs
[43:31] that have been spoken. Lord, may you
[43:33] move in each life. We pray. Lord, be
[43:35] with us now. We ask in Jesus Christ's
[43:37] name we pray it.
[43:39] Amen. Amen. God bless you. Turn if you
[43:41] would to First John chapter 4. 1 John
[43:44] chapter 4. Good to see each one. Good to
[43:45] see the whiffins here. The whole bench
[43:47] there this morning. God bless you. Amen.
[43:49] I see Nadine's back with us. And I'm
[43:51] assuming Cassandra maybe. Yes. Amen.
[43:54] Good to see you back. Glad to have you
[43:56] with us this morning. Amen. First John
[43:59] chapter 4, very familiar scripture.
[44:02] Verse 18, he says, "There is no fear in
[44:05] love, but perfect love casteth out fear,
[44:08] because fear had torment. He that fearth
[44:11] is not made perfect in love." And then
[44:14] he says, "We love him because he first
[44:17] loved us." Amen. God bless you. You can
[44:19] have your seats this morning. We want to
[44:21] continue our thought. We've been
[44:22] preaching on this series on the Holy
[44:24] Ghost life, the token life. And I want
[44:26] to take yet another service on this idea
[44:28] of no room for fear. And last service we
[44:31] spoke about fear. And we spoke about
[44:32] faith and how they are polar opposites.
[44:34] And you can't have faith and fear at the
[44:36] same time. Just like you can't be hot
[44:38] and cold at the same time. You can move
[44:40] from one to the other, but you can't be
[44:41] both at the same time. The scripture
[44:43] shows us you can't be fearful and have
[44:45] faith at the same time. You've got to
[44:47] commit to one or the other. You got to
[44:48] decide which one you're going to lay
[44:50] hold of. And we want to focus on faith.
[44:51] Amen. Faith comes from God. Fear comes
[44:54] from the devil. Remember, we went to
[44:55] Genesis and we saw that fear came from
[44:57] believing a lie of Satan. And faith
[45:00] comes from believing the word of God,
[45:01] the truth that comes from God. Amen. And
[45:03] we'll see that fear is conditional. Fear
[45:06] looks at circumstances. Fear looks at
[45:07] what's going on. Fear looks at at what
[45:09] our our five senses declare and it comes
[45:12] up with something there. But faith is an
[45:14] absolute. Faith doesn't change. See,
[45:16] that's the thing. Fear goes up and down
[45:17] based on the situation. Faith stays flat
[45:19] no matter what. It just is. It's just
[45:21] there because it's not conditional. It's
[45:23] an absolute because it's resting on what
[45:25] God says about the situation. And I'll
[45:27] tell you one thing, I want to live by
[45:28] that absolute every day. Amen. I don't
[45:30] want to have fear in my life. I don't
[45:31] want to have that anxiety, that worry,
[45:33] but I want to have that absolute flat
[45:35] calmness that comes from knowing that
[45:37] God is in control. But if we get into
[45:39] this thought of how do we get rid of
[45:41] fear? How does fear get cast out of our
[45:42] lives? We read in 1 John 4 there where
[45:45] it says perfect love casts out fear. And
[45:47] we spoke about this a little bit last
[45:49] service how that we don't have perfect
[45:51] love in and of ourselves. Humanly
[45:54] speaking, it's not possible to have
[45:56] perfect love. We have emotional love. We
[45:58] have relational love. We have physical
[46:00] and intimate love. We have
[46:01] performance-based love. We have all of
[46:03] these things. But when we look at
[46:04] perfect love, we cannot have that
[46:06] ourselves because perfect love is the
[46:08] love of God. Amen. And you can't have
[46:11] the love of God if you're not God. If I
[46:13] could put it that way. So in our nature,
[46:15] we can't project, we can't produce
[46:17] perfect love in ourselves. Amen. We
[46:19] aren't born with it. We can't create it.
[46:21] We can't aspire to it. Amen. But we can
[46:24] get it. We can get this perfect love.
[46:27] Amen. Because it's of God. And if God
[46:29] gives us to it, gives it to us, then we
[46:31] can have it. But there's only one way
[46:33] that we can do that. And if we go back
[46:35] to 1 John 4, then it says this,
[46:37] "Beloved." He says, "Let us love one
[46:40] another." Now, that word is love is a
[46:43] specific one because you'll look in the
[46:45] in the scriptures and the word love
[46:46] changes based on what it's talking
[46:48] about. But this is a verb. It's an
[46:50] action.
[46:51] In the the Greek there is agapo and it
[46:53] means it's the act of loving
[46:56] perfectly. So he says beloved let us
[46:59] love perfectly or in other words let us
[47:03] love as god loves. Let us love one
[47:05] another as god loves. He says for love.
[47:08] Now we switch from a verb to a noun.
[47:10] It's an object. Agape. He says for agape
[47:13] God's love is of God. And everyone that
[47:16] agapos everyone that loves like God
[47:18] loves is born of God. and knows God. He
[47:22] says, "He that loveth not knoweth not
[47:24] God." You can't love perfectly unless
[47:26] you've met the love of God. He says,
[47:28] "For God is love." The very defining
[47:31] attribute, the very character of God is
[47:34] love. And from that love comes mercy.
[47:37] From that love comes grace. And from
[47:39] that love, we'll see as sons and
[47:41] daughters comes correction. It's all the
[47:44] same love. See, we want the the the
[47:46] feel-good love, the filial love. That is
[47:48] not the love of God. The love of God is
[47:50] perfect because it is always for your
[47:53] benefit. It is not to make God feel good
[47:56] about how you feel towards him, if I
[47:58] could put it that way. So often we make
[48:00] decisions, we we love somebody based on
[48:02] how we want to feel after we've done
[48:05] it. Amen. We give things to our kids. We
[48:08] give into our kids. We give in to our
[48:09] spouse. We give in to our boss, whatever
[48:11] it might be. We give into societal
[48:13] pressure because we want them to like
[48:14] us. We want them to love us. And so we
[48:17] give them what they want rather than
[48:19] what is best for them. But God's love is
[48:22] perfect. It's unconditional. It's not
[48:24] based on if you're going to respond the
[48:26] right way. It's based on is this the
[48:28] right thing for my son or my daughter.
[48:30] That's what perfect love is. Amen. It's
[48:32] a love that's for our best interests
[48:34] always. It's always for our good. And he
[48:37] says in this was manifested the love of
[48:39] God. And this is is manifested the
[48:41] perfect unconditional love because that
[48:44] God sent his only begotten son into the
[48:46] world that we might live through him.
[48:49] And he says herein is love. Herein is
[48:52] perfect love. He says not that we love
[48:55] God. In other words, whether we love him
[48:58] or not does not change his love for us.
[49:03] That's quite a thought
[49:06] because we love each other. But if you
[49:10] stop loving me, then chances are I'm
[49:12] going to stop loving you. If we could
[49:13] put it that way, in our human nature,
[49:15] somebody doesn't like me, guess what?
[49:16] I'm going to say, "Well, I don't like
[49:17] you
[49:19] either." Amen. The Clintar group is
[49:24] here. That's the way we are. We're
[49:27] responsive
[49:28] love. God's love isn't like that. He
[49:31] says, "Herein is real love. Not that we
[49:33] love God." In other words, it's not from
[49:35] us. He says, "But that he loved us." So
[49:38] perfect love is to us, not for not from
[49:40] us. We don't create it. It comes to us.
[49:43] He says, "And he sent his son to be the
[49:45] propitiation for our sins." Abraham says
[49:47] this. He says, "When God saw the sin of
[49:49] this world and saw that men were dying
[49:51] without hope, could not be saved. And
[49:54] yet he knew that men would love him.
[49:56] They didn't love him, but he says he
[49:58] knew they would love him." He said it
[50:00] strained God and it proved his nature.
[50:03] God's nature is love. God is love and it
[50:06] strains God's nature until he had to
[50:09] provide a way of escape for those that
[50:11] wanted to escape. He says, "And he sent
[50:14] his son into the world made in the
[50:16] likeness of sinful flesh to bear our
[50:18] sins and sickness to Calvary." God did
[50:20] it. He says the love of God going out
[50:23] calling for sovereign grace. That's why
[50:25] I'm saying it comes to us. It does not
[50:27] come from us. This is perfect love. He
[50:30] says, "And God never said,"If you'll do
[50:32] it, if you'll do this, then I'll do
[50:34] this." He said, "God, without any
[50:38] conditions, without any conditions, he
[50:40] sent his son to die in your place and
[50:43] settle the sin question." It had nothing
[50:45] to do with what you think about it. God
[50:47] did it anyhow. He says, "Divine love put
[50:50] to a strain, sovereign grace has to take
[50:53] its place." That's all there is. When
[50:56] divine love is set at the right place,
[50:58] this is perfect love. It goes into
[51:00] action independent of whether or not
[51:02] you'll receive it. What you're going to
[51:04] think about it, what you're going to do
[51:06] about it. It goes out because it knows
[51:08] that there is someone that will receive
[51:10] it and respond to it. But it's not based
[51:13] on time. It's based on an absolute.
[51:16] It's based on an absolute. Back to John
[51:19] 4, he says 1 John 4, he says, "Beloved,
[51:21] if God so loved us, we also ought to
[51:24] love one another." In other words, if we
[51:26] freely receive this perfect love, we
[51:28] ought to give this perfect love. Now,
[51:30] this is a challenge because Jesus said,
[51:31] "By this shall all men know that you're
[51:33] my disciples." If you have love one for
[51:35] another, which means it's not based on
[51:38] whether they shake your hand, whether
[51:39] they give you a hug, whether they're
[51:41] your friend or not. You love them
[51:42] because they're a part of the body of
[51:44] Christ. And let me say it this way, you
[51:47] don't know who is a part of the body of
[51:48] Christ. So that means that I just don't
[51:51] share that love with the people that go
[51:52] to my church or sit under my ministry.
[51:55] But it has to be for everyone I come
[51:57] across because perfect love is calling
[52:00] them back to the body. And it's God
[52:02] that's working through us. We'll see
[52:04] this as we go through this service.
[52:05] Amen. What is it? God's love moves from
[52:07] spirit to flesh. And now he's working
[52:09] with your hands, your feet, your mouth,
[52:11] your nature, your life to bring other
[52:13] people to him. He says, "No man has seen
[52:15] God at any time, but they see him
[52:17] through you." That's perfect love
[52:19] expressed. He says, "If we love one
[52:21] another, God dwelleth in us, and his
[52:23] love is perfected in us." This line,
[52:25] "His love is perfected in us." It's a
[52:28] beautiful meaning. It means that his
[52:30] love has reached the apex. His love has
[52:32] reached the pinnacle of its intention
[52:35] and expression in you. You're the
[52:38] perfect expression of the love of God
[52:40] this morning. Amen. were the full and
[52:42] complete expression of the love of God.
[52:44] Amen. Think of it this way. God's love
[52:47] is only truly and perfectly expressed
[52:49] because you
[52:50] exist.
[52:52] Wow. Because it was only in his
[52:54] thoughts, but now it's brought into a
[52:56] reality. And we see the love of God now
[52:59] moving from thought into action and it's
[53:02] producing itself. And so you stand here,
[53:05] you sit here this morning as objects of
[53:08] his love.
[53:09] The word has produced the object of his
[53:11] love. It's produced the bribe without
[53:13] spot or wrinkle. It's produced the
[53:15] people that will receive the love, the
[53:17] word of God this morning. Amen. So it's
[53:19] perfectly expressed in you and I.
[53:22] It's not enough that he thought it. It's
[53:24] it's that he had to bring it into a
[53:26] reality. That's perfect love expressed.
[53:28] He says, "Now hereby we know." This is
[53:31] how we know that we dwell in him and he
[53:33] in us. He says, "It's because he hath
[53:35] given us of his spirit." Amen. So
[53:38] perfect love is expressed in this
[53:40] thought that regardless of our
[53:42] condition, God loved us past, God loves
[53:46] us present, and God will keep loving us
[53:48] future. It is his elective love as we
[53:51] talked about. It is not based on where
[53:53] we're at this morning. It's based on
[53:55] that he decided to love us. Remember we
[53:57] read the scriptures. Jacob have I loved,
[54:00] Esau have I hated, having neither been
[54:02] born nor done right or wrong. God has an
[54:04] elect group that he loves and it's
[54:07] independent of our
[54:08] conduct. That's not why he loves us. But
[54:11] we'll see that we get into closer
[54:13] relationship based on our actions cuz we
[54:17] can get closer to him based on what we
[54:19] do. And he'll come in as we open up the
[54:21] door to him inside of our lives. Amen.
[54:23] So it's but but this love is independent
[54:25] of our faith, of our
[54:28] ignorance, of our fear, of our worries,
[54:31] of our our human abilities or
[54:33] inabilities, of our flaws. It's
[54:35] independent of all of these things.
[54:37] Amen. God loves us. Period. End of
[54:39] story. If you are his child, if you are
[54:43] his child. Amen. We've got to know this
[54:45] morning that God loves us because the
[54:47] antidote to fear is knowing that God
[54:49] loves you. Amen. And we'll dig into that
[54:52] this morning. Amen. Because what?
[54:54] Perfect faith, perfect love rather,
[54:56] brings perfect faith. And that is what
[54:58] takes away the fear. It takes the place
[54:59] of fear. We're not going to get any
[55:01] place over fear this morning if we don't
[55:02] know that God loves us. We've got to
[55:04] know that we are his children this
[55:05] morning. That he loves us. And that
[55:07] everything that's happening in our life
[55:08] is for purpose. How do we know he loves
[55:11] us? John says, "Because he's given us
[55:13] his spirit." That's when you know you're
[55:15] really a child of God is when God gives
[55:16] you his Holy Spirit. Up to then, it's
[55:19] just theory.
[55:20] I think he loves me. But he says when he
[55:23] gives you his spirit, that's how you
[55:25] know that he loves you because what?
[55:27] He's put himself inside of you.
[55:30] He's now he's now living in your body.
[55:33] You are the temple of the Holy Ghost.
[55:35] You're the dwelling place of God. That's
[55:37] how you know that he loves you is that
[55:38] he's come down and he's dwelling with
[55:40] you. And once he dwells with you,
[55:42] church, he never goes away. You're
[55:44] sealed to the day of your full
[55:45] redemption. We know these things. Amen.
[55:47] And so we come to this idea of perfect
[55:49] love, casting out fear. When you know
[55:52] that he loves you because he's given you
[55:53] his spirit, you can walk through life
[55:55] now with confidence because if he's with
[55:58] you, he's going to take you through no
[55:59] matter what. That's the confidence that
[56:02] we have in him. Amen. So as we come into
[56:04] life situations, as we come into
[56:05] struggles and hard times, that's when
[56:07] our faith in the love of God is tested
[56:09] is when things don't look so
[56:11] loving. But yet, we have to come to this
[56:14] idea that God loves us and he's in it
[56:16] for our best interests. Amen. That's
[56:19] when we're challenged on whether he
[56:20] really loves us and whether we love
[56:23] him. Paul would say this in Romans. He
[56:26] says, "Therefore, being justified by
[56:27] faith, we have peace through God through
[56:30] our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also we
[56:32] have access by faith into this grace
[56:35] wherein we stand." Remember, it's it's
[56:37] by faith by grace through faith that we
[56:39] are saved. And that not of yourselves.
[56:41] It's a gift of God. This is a work of
[56:43] his from start to finish. He says, "And
[56:45] we rejoice in hope of the glory of God,
[56:48] and not only so, but we glory in
[56:50] tribulations." And the church
[56:52] said, "A a half-hearted
[56:56] amen."
[56:58] Listen, do we glory in tribulations? My
[57:02] goal this morning is to get you to glory
[57:04] in
[57:05] tribulations. There's a bunch of stone
[57:07] faces and a couple grins.
[57:10] That's a that's a big goal this morning,
[57:12] isn't it? Paul said, John, sorry, Paul
[57:15] said, we glory in tribulations. Now,
[57:18] watch why we glory in
[57:20] tribulations.
[57:22] Knowing, this is a revelation, knowing
[57:25] that tribulation workketh patience. He
[57:27] says, knowing that tribulation, hard
[57:30] times, they produce patience. And
[57:33] patience produces experience. Now, this
[57:37] word experience means proof.
[57:40] In other words, tribulations produce
[57:43] proof of
[57:44] something. He says, "And that proof,
[57:47] that experience produces hope." Now,
[57:49] remember what hope is. Hope is the time
[57:51] element of faith. Faith says God's going
[57:54] to do it. Hope says God's going to do it
[57:57] today. Hope is the expectation of God to
[58:00] move today. Church, why would we believe
[58:02] he's going to move tomorrow? Let's
[58:03] believe for today. Don't put off till
[58:06] tomorrow what God can do for us today.
[58:08] That's what hope is. Hope is an
[58:10] everpresent expectation for God to
[58:12] produce his word in your life. That's
[58:15] where we want to live. Remember, it's
[58:16] faith, hope, and charity. But the
[58:18] greatest of these is charity. But you
[58:20] need faith and you need an expectation.
[58:23] And that expectation will be bring proof
[58:25] of the love of God. He says, "And
[58:29] hope expectation he says it maketh not
[58:32] ashamed." In other words, hope doesn't
[58:34] bring dishonor or disgrace because it
[58:37] didn't happen today. See, we testify and
[58:40] so often we get ashamed because what we
[58:42] testified didn't happen in our time in
[58:46] our timeline in what we believed would
[58:48] happen and we can feel shame. He says
[58:50] don't feel ashamed. Your testimony of
[58:53] the moving of God in your life, it is it
[58:55] has to be a dayby-day experience and he
[58:58] won't leave you hanging. He won't leave
[59:01] you ashamed. Amen. We trust God's
[59:03] timing, but we believe for
[59:05] today. That's the way I want to believe.
[59:07] I want to believe he's going to move
[59:08] today, not
[59:10] tomorrow. But we won't feel betrayed if
[59:13] there's faith behind it. He says, "Hope
[59:15] doesn't make us ashamed because the love
[59:17] of God is shed abroad in our hearts by
[59:20] the Holy Ghost which is given to us."
[59:22] Amen. That's the anchor of our soul.
[59:26] That's the anchor of the Christian
[59:27] experience is that I have received the
[59:29] life of Jesus Christ inside of me.
[59:32] That's the thing that keeps me. It's not
[59:34] how I'm feeling today. Church, as a
[59:37] pastor, there are days where I don't
[59:38] feel very Christian. I don't feel like
[59:40] an overcomer. I don't feel like I've got
[59:43] it all figured
[59:44] out. Now, I never want to express that
[59:48] because that's not a faith. But the
[59:50] feeling of the Christian walk is not
[59:52] always one of victory. When you're in
[59:55] the middle of the battle, all you're
[59:57] thinking about is, "Will I survive this
[59:59] moment? Am I going to make it through
[1:00:01] the day? Can I keep my sanity? Can I
[1:00:03] keep my energy? Can I just make it to my
[1:00:05] bed tonight?" And all the mom said,
[1:00:08] "Amen." We're just trying to get
[1:00:11] through. The feeling of our Christianity
[1:00:13] is not what matters. It's the anchor of
[1:00:15] our soul by the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:18] Ghost. Say, "You have met Jesus Christ.
[1:00:20] He has anchored himself in your life and
[1:00:22] nothing can change it." That is what
[1:00:24] keeps me going day by day. Not whether I
[1:00:26] feel like a believer or not. Amen. He's
[1:00:29] confirmed that you are his and he is
[1:00:31] yours. He says this. There's no fear to
[1:00:34] the sailor how hard the ship is being
[1:00:36] buffeted by the waves as long as that
[1:00:39] anchor is holding in the top of the
[1:00:41] mountain yonder. What happens when you
[1:00:43] get into a situation with the ship is
[1:00:45] you drop the anchor. And you have to
[1:00:47] have an anchor that's rated for the size
[1:00:49] of your ship. You guys that go offgore
[1:00:52] offshore, you see the anchors that they
[1:00:54] use. My dad used to work offshore and
[1:00:56] boy, when they would hit anchors on some
[1:00:58] of these drill ships, absolutely
[1:01:00] massive. You're talking chains that are
[1:01:02] 6 8 in in diameter on the links and when
[1:01:05] they let them go and all they see is
[1:01:07] sparks going there. And you think, why
[1:01:09] is the chain need to be so big? Because
[1:01:11] it's got thousands and thousands of ship
[1:01:14] tons of ship that it's got to hold no
[1:01:16] matter what comes. And so what do they
[1:01:18] do? They have confidence in the
[1:01:21] anchor. The confidence is not in the
[1:01:23] sailor. The confidence is that the
[1:01:26] anchor holds. So you got an anchor and
[1:01:28] if that anchor is secured in one of
[1:01:30] those underwater mountains in good soil
[1:01:33] in good ground and it's grabbed a hold,
[1:01:35] you know that no matter what comes, as
[1:01:37] long as the anchor holds, you're going
[1:01:39] to be okay. Your faith is in the anchor,
[1:01:42] not in how you feel. Your faith is in
[1:01:45] the anchor, not in what it looks like
[1:01:47] outside.
[1:01:48] That's what he says. If you know your
[1:01:50] anchor holds, you're going to be okay.
[1:01:52] He says it isn't going to get in it's
[1:01:55] not going to the ship's going to stay
[1:01:57] up. It isn't going up against some rock
[1:01:59] somewhere. It isn't going to get in some
[1:02:01] shallow water and be turned over because
[1:02:03] it's got the absolute anchor to the top
[1:02:05] of some mountain. Now, he brings it to
[1:02:07] us. He says, "Now when a man can pray
[1:02:09] the prayer of faith and anchor his soul
[1:02:12] yonder in the word of God where all
[1:02:14] heavens and earth will pass away, but my
[1:02:16] that word cannot." He says, "There is no
[1:02:19] fear because what? I've anchored my soul
[1:02:22] to his word. I've anchored my
[1:02:25] circumstances to his word. My rest is
[1:02:27] not in me. My rest is in where I'm
[1:02:30] anchored this morning."
[1:02:32] That's my rest. That's what's holding
[1:02:34] me. It's not do I hold on. It's am I
[1:02:38] anchored to the unmovable? And what is
[1:02:40] it? It's by faith in the word of God
[1:02:42] that we stand this morning. It's not
[1:02:44] that I have stood this time. It's
[1:02:46] because he has held me by the anchor of
[1:02:48] his word and the power of his spirit. He
[1:02:52] says, "Let them come say whatever they
[1:02:54] want to." Our faith is in God and God
[1:02:57] alone. We believe it.
[1:03:00] Can I bring this to a real world
[1:03:02] example? Well, I had some fun doing this
[1:03:05] in in my study yesterday. As you know,
[1:03:07] my my in-laws live in
[1:03:09] California and sometimes we happen to
[1:03:12] have enough money to go to one of the
[1:03:14] big theme parks or the amusement parks.
[1:03:17] And I'll tell you, church, they know how
[1:03:20] to make rides over there. You know, we
[1:03:22] have the these roving uh you know uh
[1:03:25] things that go through with all the
[1:03:26] rides, amusement parks. You know, these
[1:03:28] are not mere little swings and and
[1:03:30] roller coasters that are 20 ft up in the
[1:03:32] air. These are big, huge
[1:03:36] structures meant to scare the living
[1:03:40] daylights out of you. They have rides
[1:03:42] that are so fast and change direction so
[1:03:45] fast it's possible to black out in them.
[1:03:48] It's like being in a fighter jet.
[1:03:51] They've got them that will accelerate
[1:03:52] faster than any car that's out there in
[1:03:54] the world today. They've got them that
[1:03:57] can turn. so quickly going through the
[1:03:59] vertical that you are elevate. You are
[1:04:01] you levitate in your seat. You defeat
[1:04:04] gravity on these
[1:04:06] rides. Okay. Now, Selena and I spent a
[1:04:10] day at Magic Mountain. The favorite ride
[1:04:13] I had, I think probably hers as well,
[1:04:15] was called
[1:04:17] Tatsu. And this is a ride where you're
[1:04:19] in almost a Superman pose.
[1:04:22] So what you do is you're
[1:04:24] hanging from something that is above.
[1:04:29] Hallelujah. There is nothing beneath
[1:04:31] you. Everything is holding you from
[1:04:33] above. So you are strapped in to a
[1:04:36] harness and you hang there and you're in
[1:04:38] a Superman pose. Nothing beneath you.
[1:04:40] Nothing to make you feel good about
[1:04:42] yourself and you're face first into
[1:04:44] whatever's coming. You're dead if
[1:04:46] anything goes
[1:04:48] wrong. But it's the most amazing thing.
[1:04:51] Amen.
[1:04:53] as
[1:04:54] long as you think you're going to make
[1:04:57] it
[1:04:58] through. Now, as we're going through
[1:05:01] this, so you have to make up your mind
[1:05:03] going into these rides. Am I going to
[1:05:05] enjoy it or am I going to scare the
[1:05:07] livers out of myself? And let me tell
[1:05:10] you, it's a decision you
[1:05:13] make because if you think about it, why
[1:05:16] are we scared of the
[1:05:18] ride? We're scared because we think
[1:05:21] something might
[1:05:23] happen. We're scared ultimately because
[1:05:26] we don't think it's
[1:05:28] safe. And if we don't think it's safe,
[1:05:30] it's because we don't trust the guy or
[1:05:32] the woman that designed it. Ultimately,
[1:05:35] we're scared because we don't trust the
[1:05:37] person that puts us in that situation.
[1:05:40] If we really stop and think about it,
[1:05:41] which none of us do when we're in a
[1:05:43] theme park. Only engineers and pastors
[1:05:45] think about these things, right?
[1:05:49] Now, I'm an engineer and I have an
[1:05:52] appreciation. I have an understanding. I
[1:05:54] have a knowledge of the work that goes
[1:05:55] into designing these things. And as
[1:05:57] technologies gotten better, as materials
[1:06:00] have gotten better, then they can do
[1:06:01] more and more with these things. But
[1:06:03] every single ride is overengineered
[1:06:07] massively. Overengineered. You can put
[1:06:09] the biggest loads and stresses through
[1:06:11] that that you could ever do. It could go
[1:06:13] twice the speed and it would still hold
[1:06:14] up. It's engineered to keep you safe.
[1:06:18] So when I'm on these rides, my body is
[1:06:21] screaming, "We're going to die. We're
[1:06:23] going to die. We're going to
[1:06:25] die." But my mind is screaming, "Trust
[1:06:28] the engineer. Trust the engineer. Trust
[1:06:31] the
[1:06:32] engineer." And in the end, I go in, and
[1:06:35] you can laugh at me. This is the way I
[1:06:37] handle these rides. I go in and I say,
[1:06:38] "I'm going to enjoy it because I know
[1:06:40] I'm going to make it through the other
[1:06:42] side." Amen.
[1:06:46] My mind is saying, "This is amazing. I
[1:06:49] would love to do this for a job.
[1:06:53] Woohoo." And and Selena's beside me
[1:06:56] going, "Woo!" the whole
[1:06:59] time.
[1:07:00] Amen. But does that mean I enjoy every
[1:07:03] time my face gets flattened by sudden
[1:07:05] acceleration or deceleration or my
[1:07:08] stomach flip-flops as I go through a a
[1:07:10] crazy car? We went inside, outside,
[1:07:12] upside down on this ride. all
[1:07:17] suspended. Phenomenal. I highly
[1:07:19] recommend
[1:07:21] it. But I'm sitting there, I'm saying,
[1:07:23] "It's amazing that I can put my body
[1:07:26] through this and enjoy
[1:07:30] it. Sister Brenda is not going. There is
[1:07:32] no way that she's going." But here's the
[1:07:35] thing.
[1:07:37] The other thing I love to do after I've
[1:07:40] convinced myself it's safe and I'm going
[1:07:42] to make it and I've had my brief moment
[1:07:43] of enjoyment is I start to look and
[1:07:45] listen around
[1:07:46] me. And you'll notice that there's two
[1:07:49] groups. Amen. There are those that are
[1:07:52] fearful, that are overwhelmed, that
[1:07:54] don't know how to
[1:07:58] react, and so all they can do is scream.
[1:08:02] Maybe not appropriate for church, but
[1:08:04] there was a group of young ladies behind
[1:08:05] Selena and myself and they cursed the
[1:08:07] entire
[1:08:08] time. They were just completely
[1:08:11] overwhelmed. But then you have these
[1:08:13] people and their hands out. They love
[1:08:15] it. It's great. It's beautiful. Now,
[1:08:19] they may think it's great because
[1:08:20] they're
[1:08:21] ignorant. They haven't considered the
[1:08:23] idea that something bad might go wrong
[1:08:25] or it's because they know that it's safe
[1:08:27] and so they're just going to enjoy the
[1:08:28] moment.
[1:08:31] But I'll tell you this, the only reason
[1:08:33] I can enjoy it is because I have faith
[1:08:35] in the designer of my
[1:08:37] situation. Amen. Difference is I chose
[1:08:41] this. We go through life, there are some
[1:08:44] things we do choose. There are some
[1:08:46] things that are chosen for us. And the
[1:08:48] question we come back to is, do we trust
[1:08:51] the designer that put us in the
[1:08:54] situation in the first
[1:08:56] place? Amen. I'm not saying you have to
[1:09:00] enjoy hard situations, Sister
[1:09:02] Brenda, but we have to trust the hard
[1:09:07] situations that the ultimate
[1:09:10] engineer, the author and the finisher of
[1:09:13] our faith has put us there because we
[1:09:17] can go through it. Because we can make
[1:09:20] it through. And not only that, but when
[1:09:22] we come through
[1:09:23] it, we'll have character that's just
[1:09:26] like his. It'll be better on the other
[1:09:29] side regardless of how flip-floppy and
[1:09:32] inside outside upside down the ride
[1:09:34] was than when we started the
[1:09:37] ride. Amen. I'll tell you one thing. I
[1:09:40] believe that those that go the second
[1:09:42] time, they might be scared the first
[1:09:43] time, but having made it through, they
[1:09:46] probably enjoy it a little more the
[1:09:47] second time because they know I'm going
[1:09:49] to make it.
[1:09:51] Sometimes that's all we need to do is
[1:09:53] make it through the first one. And then
[1:09:55] we say, "Okay,
[1:09:57] Lord, I can do
[1:09:59] this. I can do this with you. I can do
[1:10:02] this with faith. I can do this with
[1:10:04] trust." And we can start to relax even
[1:10:06] in the middle of the roller coaster of
[1:10:09] life. When hard times are hitting us,
[1:10:12] amen, knowing that you are in his
[1:10:15] hands. So, we can now go into a
[1:10:17] situation and rather than say, "I don't
[1:10:20] want to be here. I don't see how God can
[1:10:22] work in this. I've got no money. I've
[1:10:24] got no energy. I've got no strength.
[1:10:25] I've got no education. I've got no
[1:10:27] assets. I've got no forward vision as to
[1:10:30] how this working out. We can go in and
[1:10:32] say, "I can't wait to see how God does
[1:10:34] this." We can walk in with an attitude
[1:10:36] of, "I'm going to look for the praise in
[1:10:39] the situation rather than look for the
[1:10:41] fear in the situation." We can walk in
[1:10:44] and say, "Listen, I've got to ride the
[1:10:45] roller coaster no matter what." So, I
[1:10:48] can go into it with an expectation and a
[1:10:50] hope to see the glory of God revealed in
[1:10:53] me, or I can go in there wondering and
[1:10:56] worrying and full of anxiety and
[1:10:58] frustrations and despair and dread day
[1:11:01] in and day out. That's not the way to do
[1:11:03] it, church. That is not the way to go
[1:11:05] through life. That's a fearful way of
[1:11:08] going through life. Amen. Our
[1:11:09] expectation should be, I'm going to come
[1:11:11] out better than I went in. Last service,
[1:11:13] we spoke of absolutes. We talked about
[1:11:15] that word all. And we read in Psalms 103
[1:11:17] where God said to forget not all his
[1:11:19] benefits and that he forgives all of our
[1:11:22] iniquities and that he heals all of our
[1:11:24] diseases. And I want to take that again
[1:11:26] this morning as we go back to Romans 8
[1:11:28] and talk about the absolute that he
[1:11:30] gives us here. He says in Romans 8, he
[1:11:32] says, "And we know that all things work
[1:11:34] together for good to them that love God,
[1:11:37] to them who are the called according to
[1:11:39] his purpose." And we're going to spend
[1:11:40] the rest of this service on this on the
[1:11:42] scripture alone. He says, Paul says,
[1:11:44] "And we
[1:11:46] know." We've got to know. How do we
[1:11:48] know? First of all, we know because he
[1:11:50] said so. That's the only way. You got to
[1:11:53] take him at his word this morning. If he
[1:11:55] says so, you've got to stand there and
[1:11:57] say, "I believe you, Lord." Amen. You
[1:12:00] look in the book of Jeremiah where God
[1:12:02] is talking through Jeremiah to the
[1:12:03] children of Israel and they're in
[1:12:05] captivity in Babylon and he's saying,
[1:12:07] "Listen, this is only for a season. It's
[1:12:09] only for 70 years." Amen. And so in
[1:12:12] other words, the trial that they faced,
[1:12:13] the circumstances they were in were
[1:12:16] timebound. And it was for their good. It
[1:12:19] was for a purpose. Amen. But the
[1:12:21] ultimate purpose of God, even for them
[1:12:23] being in Babylon, was for good and not
[1:12:25] for evil. And he says in Jeremiah 29:11,
[1:12:28] he says, "For I know the thoughts that I
[1:12:30] think towards you, sayeth the Lord,
[1:12:32] thoughts of peace, not of evil, to give
[1:12:35] you an expected end." Church, he tells
[1:12:38] us his thoughts. He shares with us his
[1:12:40] thoughts so that we know what he's
[1:12:42] trying to do while he's doing it. Even
[1:12:45] before he does it, he gives us insight
[1:12:47] into what's coming. So that when it hits
[1:12:50] us, we can have faith. Hey, he told us
[1:12:52] this was coming. We look around this
[1:12:54] world today and we see the absolute fall
[1:12:57] of marriage. We see the fall of
[1:12:59] politics. We see the fall of the
[1:13:00] economics. We see the fall of the
[1:13:02] character of the people. And it doesn't
[1:13:05] cause us to worry. Why? because the
[1:13:07] scripture says as it was in the days of
[1:13:09] Lot, in the days of Sodom and Gomorrah,
[1:13:12] it's got to be the same way today. And
[1:13:14] so we know we're in that time. So we
[1:13:16] don't worry, but we say, "Even so, come
[1:13:18] Lord Jesus. The season is here. The
[1:13:21] signs are here. I'm ready to go." And we
[1:13:23] make ourselves ready. We're not in fear
[1:13:25] or worry, but we're in expectation
[1:13:28] because we see his promises because he
[1:13:30] loves us and he shares his thoughts with
[1:13:32] us.
[1:13:34] Amen. He says, "My thoughts are of peace
[1:13:36] and not of evil to give you an expected
[1:13:38] end." In other words, circumstances are
[1:13:41] just tools in his hands to produce an
[1:13:44] end
[1:13:45] effect. What is the end effect, church?
[1:13:47] It's to bring us into the fullness of
[1:13:49] the promises of God. That's what he's
[1:13:51] trying to do. To make his word live in
[1:13:55] us, to produce his word inside of us.
[1:13:58] Amen. The result is guaranteed. And all
[1:14:00] he's doing is asking us, trust the
[1:14:02] process. Trust the process. Don't fight
[1:14:04] the process. Step into it with a heart
[1:14:06] of faith. He says, "Now we know what
[1:14:09] that all
[1:14:11] things." How many
[1:14:13] things? All things. That means there are
[1:14:17] no exceptions to the things that happen
[1:14:19] in the life of a believer, of a child of
[1:14:22] God. Let me say it that way. Amen. There
[1:14:24] isn't a single event in your life, past,
[1:14:27] present, or future, that doesn't work
[1:14:30] for your good. All things work together.
[1:14:32] Amen. Even your mistakes and your
[1:14:35] failures work for your good. Now see,
[1:14:39] that doesn't work for the children of
[1:14:41] this world. But that works for children
[1:14:43] of God. Amen. Look at Jonah. Jonah
[1:14:45] disobeyed God and God still worked it
[1:14:47] out for his good and the work and and
[1:14:50] for the good of the city of Nineveh.
[1:14:52] Amen. Catch this distinction. the the
[1:14:55] the event the thing may feel
[1:15:02] horrible. I it's not about how you feel
[1:15:05] going through it that makes it good.
[1:15:07] It's never about that. Amen. The the
[1:15:10] circumstances may be extremely
[1:15:11] difficult. And listen, all things
[1:15:14] doesn't mean just the good things in
[1:15:16] life. See, we think good things work
[1:15:18] good things. No, all things work good
[1:15:20] things for a believer, for a child of
[1:15:22] God. Amen. That's what all mean all
[1:15:24] means. And so sometimes we do the wrong
[1:15:27] thing. And instead of destroying our
[1:15:29] lives the way it would somebody in the
[1:15:30] world, God will come behind and what
[1:15:33] will he do? He'll let us reap what we
[1:15:34] sow, but he'll help us to learn the
[1:15:36] lesson in the reaping. Most people go
[1:15:39] through pain and suffering constantly
[1:15:41] because they never learn from their
[1:15:43] mistakes. We see it. We see it in our
[1:15:45] country. We see it in our politics. We
[1:15:47] see it in our fiscal policy. We see it
[1:15:49] in life choices. We see it in
[1:15:50] relationship choices. People get married
[1:15:53] and divorced and then they go and they
[1:15:55] rinse and repeat it over and over again
[1:15:56] because they never learn from what
[1:15:57] caused the first
[1:15:59] one over and over. They never learn. But
[1:16:02] when you're a child of God, God will
[1:16:04] chastise us. He'll let us reap what we
[1:16:06] sow, but he'll show us by correction
[1:16:08] where the problem is. And usually what
[1:16:10] he does is he lets us do it early on so
[1:16:12] that later on we don't have the big
[1:16:13] effects. See, he gives us sometimes we
[1:16:17] say God's overreacting. What I'm doing
[1:16:19] here is such a small thing. He's
[1:16:21] overreacting now because if you get the
[1:16:23] lesson now, you won't have to deal with
[1:16:24] the big consequences later.
[1:16:27] Amen. He'll let us learn from those
[1:16:29] lessons. Sometimes God will use our
[1:16:32] absolute disobedience. We talked about
[1:16:33] Jonah. I know people that left God, you
[1:16:36] know, as a young person, they they
[1:16:38] walked away from from from God. They
[1:16:40] walked away from church. They backslid
[1:16:42] and they went out and they got married
[1:16:45] and then God brought them back and he
[1:16:46] brought their spouse with them.
[1:16:49] Listen, I will never encourage you to do
[1:16:51] that, but I'm not God. God doesn't tell
[1:16:54] you to go out, but what? All things work
[1:16:57] together for good. So, you can go out in
[1:17:00] disobedience, and God will use that
[1:17:02] disobedience to hook somebody else and
[1:17:03] bring them in. That's the kind of God we
[1:17:05] serve this morning. I know multiple
[1:17:07] couples that have had that happen.
[1:17:08] Again, I don't recommend it, but God can
[1:17:11] turn bad things into good
[1:17:13] things. He says, "All things what? work
[1:17:17] together for good. Notice he didn't say
[1:17:20] all things work for good. That's the
[1:17:22] problem we get into so many times. Amen.
[1:17:25] It's not the individual event that works
[1:17:27] for good, but when you take the whole
[1:17:29] sum of everything, it works together for
[1:17:32] good. Some things aren't good in and of
[1:17:35] themselves. We lose a loved one,
[1:17:36] somebody dies. That's not a good thing
[1:17:39] to us. We've lost somebody we love.
[1:17:42] But sometimes that's what it takes to
[1:17:44] shake somebody out of their stuper and
[1:17:46] they realize, hey, there's a heaven,
[1:17:48] there's a hell, there's a life, and then
[1:17:50] there's death and they'll come back to
[1:17:52] God because of the loss of that person.
[1:17:55] We've seen things like that. You know,
[1:17:57] some of you know, I had a little fender
[1:17:59] bender here not too long ago in February
[1:18:01] and backed out of a driveway in the
[1:18:02] middle of a snowstorm and somebody was
[1:18:04] there parked in a black car. Didn't see
[1:18:06] it, couldn't see it, whatever.
[1:18:09] Stupid, right? And I beat myself over
[1:18:12] that. I was like, "How did I how did I
[1:18:13] hit that person?" So, I backed into
[1:18:16] them. It was just a minor dent in and of
[1:18:18] itself. My car really didn't have much
[1:18:19] damage at all. Theirs had a pretty good
[1:18:21] ding on the door. Amen. That's that's
[1:18:23] that's a hit to my car insurance now
[1:18:25] when I renew in in in August. I'm going
[1:18:27] to bear the burden of raised insurance
[1:18:30] costs. And I don't care what you tell
[1:18:32] me. That ain't a good thing. I don't
[1:18:33] need a raise in my cost of living this
[1:18:35] morning. Amen. But what happened? My
[1:18:38] wife was with me. I'd have done the same
[1:18:40] thing whether she was with me or not,
[1:18:41] just for the record. But I took the
[1:18:43] biggest envelope I had, the thickest
[1:18:44] one, because it was snowing. And so
[1:18:46] whatever I gave put on the windshield as
[1:18:48] a note was going to get soaked. So I I I
[1:18:50] wrote on there my my information and
[1:18:52] contact details and whatnot. And then I
[1:18:54] wrapped it up tightly and put it under
[1:18:56] her windshield
[1:18:57] wiper. And so I went
[1:19:00] away and I and and uh I said, "I don't I
[1:19:03] don't know if that's going to hold up,
[1:19:04] but I mean, what can I do?" We waited
[1:19:06] around for a while. Nobody came out. And
[1:19:08] so we said, "Well, we got to go home."
[1:19:09] So we went home. Then we went on our ski
[1:19:11] trip and I came back and I still hadn't
[1:19:12] heard. So what I did is I reached out to
[1:19:14] the police and I said, "Hey, this is
[1:19:17] what happened. Here's what I did. I
[1:19:18] haven't heard from this person. Can you
[1:19:21] here's their plate number. Can you
[1:19:23] contact them and pass on my
[1:19:24] information?" They came back said,
[1:19:26] "Thank you very much. We've had an
[1:19:27] incident reported. We passed on your
[1:19:29] information to this person." So I get a
[1:19:31] phone call a couple hours later from
[1:19:32] this woman that's just gushing and she's
[1:19:34] like, "God love you." No, not many
[1:19:37] people would have done that. And she was
[1:19:39] so thankful because she said I was going
[1:19:41] to have to pay out of pocket to fix my
[1:19:42] door.
[1:19:44] $2,000. And she said, "Now I don't have
[1:19:46] to do that. Thank you for doing that."
[1:19:48] And she said, "Why did you do it?" I
[1:19:49] said, "I'm a Christian. It was the right
[1:19:51] thing to do." And she said, "Well, it's
[1:19:54] good to know there's real Christians
[1:19:55] around." I said, "I'm a pastor." She
[1:19:57] said, "Well, I'd like to come to your
[1:19:58] church sometime." I said, "You come
[1:19:59] anytime you want." Told her where it
[1:20:01] was. Church, if God has to ding my
[1:20:04] insurance to give a witness to somebody
[1:20:06] that Christ is still alive and well with
[1:20:08] a people, ding my insurance. Why? Cuz he
[1:20:11] provides. Jehovah Gyra, listen. Whether
[1:20:14] I have money in the bank or don't have,
[1:20:16] I can't take it with me. I don't know if
[1:20:17] you know this. We can't take it with us.
[1:20:20] I've got to I've got to hold all things
[1:20:22] loosely.
[1:20:24] And if he wants to use my insurance
[1:20:26] premiums to give a witness to somebody
[1:20:28] that Christ still lives in people, then
[1:20:30] let it let it happen to me. He'll
[1:20:32] provide. He'll make a way. Amen. What is
[1:20:35] it? Satan loves to take these bumps in
[1:20:38] the road and that's all they are,
[1:20:39] church. Let's be honest. They're just
[1:20:40] bumps in the road. And what does he do?
[1:20:42] He magnifies them and he turns mo he
[1:20:45] turns mole hills into mountains. And all
[1:20:48] of a sudden, we're worried and we're
[1:20:49] anxious and we're fighting and we're
[1:20:51] frustrated and we're in despair and
[1:20:53] we've worked out 83 possible bad
[1:20:55] situations and not a single one that
[1:20:57] says, "And what if God just works it out
[1:20:58] for me?" Why? Because Satan loves to
[1:21:01] magnify and make you fear. And God says,
[1:21:05] "Be still and know that I am God."
[1:21:08] That's the way that he works. Amen. What
[1:21:11] does Satan focus on? Satan focuses us on
[1:21:14] today, right here, right now. And what
[1:21:17] does God do? God pulls us back. He says,
[1:21:18] "Look at the big picture. Look at
[1:21:21] eternity. Look, I'm in it whether you
[1:21:23] see it or not." That's what we've got to
[1:21:25] do. We've got to step back and say,
[1:21:27] "God, what's really going
[1:21:29] on? God, where are you at in this?"
[1:21:32] Listen, we may be where we are because
[1:21:34] we made some dumb
[1:21:37] choices. And sometimes we're there
[1:21:39] because we made the right choices. And
[1:21:42] regardless, we've got to say, "Lord,
[1:21:43] will you enter the situation?"
[1:21:45] Amen. We've got to look at the big
[1:21:47] picture and trust that God is with us no
[1:21:49] matter what. Listen, sometimes we've got
[1:21:52] to go into a a place where we've got to
[1:21:54] show how committed we are to what we
[1:21:57] believe. And let me tell you, there's no
[1:21:58] greater place to show that than in the
[1:22:00] workplace. That's when you get tested.
[1:22:02] Do you really believe or not?
[1:22:05] Amen. There are things that we don't do
[1:22:08] no matter what. Your employer says this
[1:22:11] what we're doing, then you say, "I'm
[1:22:12] sorry. I'm not going to do that." There
[1:22:13] are affiliations we will not be a part
[1:22:15] of no matter what. And we have to be
[1:22:18] able to stand up and say ain't going to
[1:22:20] do it. You business owners, there are
[1:22:23] things we don't do. There are ways that
[1:22:26] we run a business. Remember what Jesus
[1:22:28] said? He says, "Render unto Caesar that
[1:22:30] which belongs to Caesar." I've been
[1:22:32] around believers that were funding their
[1:22:33] entire private lifestyle out of their
[1:22:35] business and writing things off that had
[1:22:37] nothing to do with their business.
[1:22:39] Church, we don't need to cheat to be
[1:22:40] blessed of God. We don't need to do
[1:22:43] that. We can't be cheating and say, "I'm
[1:22:45] blessed of God." I've gone through
[1:22:46] multiple audits on my taxes because we
[1:22:48] do charitable donations and it's usually
[1:22:50] significant compared to the rest of the
[1:22:52] world. And I have never, as far as I
[1:22:54] remember, ever had to pay into an audit.
[1:22:57] You know why? Because I did it exactly
[1:23:00] by the book. When I moved here, my mom
[1:23:03] said, "John, you are going to get
[1:23:05] audited on your move." She said, "Keep
[1:23:07] receipts for everything." And sure
[1:23:10] enough, I did. I sent them over 70 pages
[1:23:12] of documentation and I didn't I didn't I
[1:23:15] didn't do anything that was a I had
[1:23:18] receipts for things that I went back and
[1:23:20] returned portions of it cuz I didn't
[1:23:21] need it. Boxes and stuff. I showed them
[1:23:24] that I took those receipts back and I
[1:23:26] got money back. I didn't claim the whole
[1:23:27] thing. I could have. They would never
[1:23:29] have known. But I did it exactly to the
[1:23:31] penny. I sent them over 70 pages of
[1:23:34] documentation. They came back and they
[1:23:36] gave me $18 back.
[1:23:39] I have either been had no nothing owed
[1:23:41] or given money back on every single
[1:23:43] audit. You know why, church? Because I
[1:23:45] went in with a clear conscience. And I
[1:23:47] said, "Lord, I've done everything I know
[1:23:49] to do this right. And I didn't put in
[1:23:52] anything that I didn't have. And every
[1:23:54] time it comes back, I'm okay." See, I
[1:23:56] can go in with confidence that he's on
[1:23:58] my side because I've kept him by my side
[1:24:00] when I did the work. Amen. My conscience
[1:24:03] is clear in those sorts of
[1:24:05] things. Amen. There are things we can't
[1:24:08] do no matter what. And when we say, "I'm
[1:24:11] sorry, I can't do that." The world sees,
[1:24:13] hey, they really believe what they
[1:24:14] believe. They don't believe
[1:24:16] until my career's on the line, until my
[1:24:19] promotion's on the line, until my
[1:24:21] employment's on the
[1:24:23] line. No, they believe no matter
[1:24:26] what. And I'll tell you this, the
[1:24:28] pressure is coming more and more and
[1:24:30] more. I envy you that are
[1:24:33] retired because it is getting worse and
[1:24:36] worse every day. It's ratcheting down.
[1:24:37] They're trying to force so much down our
[1:24:39] throats. And we've got to be able to
[1:24:41] stand up and say, "Sorry, that's not for
[1:24:43] me. It's not for
[1:24:46] me." Listen, our ambitions have to be
[1:24:49] subject to the will of God. Always.
[1:24:54] Always. I've seen time and time again
[1:24:56] where God gives favor in my life. And
[1:24:58] I've seen time and time again where God
[1:25:00] withdraws favor. And you say, "What
[1:25:02] happened?" When I was in Edmonton, I
[1:25:04] grew their bottom line
[1:25:06] 25% in an established business. Very
[1:25:09] difficult to do. Completely attribut
[1:25:11] attributable to my team and myself. We
[1:25:13] went into a market they'd never done
[1:25:14] anything in. And we grew their bottom
[1:25:15] line by millions and millions of
[1:25:17] dollars. And what did they do? Six years
[1:25:19] later, they canned me. Just like that,
[1:25:22] right? So what did I do? I had all sorts
[1:25:25] of opportunities. I was given a
[1:25:27] reference by a friend to a law firm that
[1:25:29] would get me more money than they ever
[1:25:30] offered. And I prayed about it and I
[1:25:32] said, "Lord, what do I do?" He says,
[1:25:34] "Let it go. Take what they offer and
[1:25:36] walk away." What was that for? Peace of
[1:25:39] mind. I don't need to fight. The Lord's
[1:25:41] on my side. And guess what? They gave me
[1:25:43] 10 week severance. And on the day after
[1:25:46] the 10 weeks was up, I started my new
[1:25:48] employment. And I got a 10-week paid
[1:25:50] vacation. It was wonderful. Why? Because
[1:25:54] he's on my side. He's working all things
[1:25:56] for my good.
[1:25:58] Amen. But Brad, I was listening to this.
[1:26:01] He said, he was praying. He says, "Take
[1:26:02] our hearts and our will in your own hand
[1:26:05] and let us become prisoners to the word,
[1:26:07] to Christ." He says, "May we live godly
[1:26:10] lives here. May these women, these young
[1:26:12] women, these young men, boys and girls,
[1:26:14] surrender their life, Lord, and may
[1:26:16] their ambition become the ambition to
[1:26:19] serve Jesus Christ." He says, "And let
[1:26:21] us become a prisoner of his divine grace
[1:26:24] and will." Church, we need a change in
[1:26:26] our ambition. Remember what Jesus said,
[1:26:28] "Seek ye first the kingdom of God." We
[1:26:31] need our ambitions changed to seek what
[1:26:33] he wants for us and then he says, "You
[1:26:35] do that and everything else will be
[1:26:37] added unto you as you need and as he
[1:26:40] sees
[1:26:42] fit." Amen. I remember in British
[1:26:44] Columbia, I I've talked about this many
[1:26:46] times. I had the golden handcuffs making
[1:26:48] more money than I ever made in my life.
[1:26:51] And I was miserable. I was stressed. I
[1:26:55] was doing phenomenal work. And yet there
[1:26:57] was one guy that was out for me. And it
[1:26:59] was just raising my blood pressure. I
[1:27:00] was having trouble sleeping. All of
[1:27:02] these different things. And I prayed
[1:27:04] about it and I said, "Lord, what do you
[1:27:05] want me to do?" And he said, "Let it go.
[1:27:08] Let it go." Right? It's just filthy
[1:27:11] mammon. It's money. Who cares? And what
[1:27:14] did he do? He gave me two weeks off and
[1:27:16] then he popped me in another
[1:27:18] job. I was supposed to take off I was
[1:27:20] that was in mid-occtober. I was supposed
[1:27:23] or or end of October I think I was
[1:27:25] supposed to go elk hunting. I was
[1:27:27] supposed to go deer hunting. I'd never
[1:27:28] had a chance in British Columbia. Take
[1:27:30] all this time off. Just detox, relax.
[1:27:32] Blanco was like, "Do it, John. Just take
[1:27:34] a couple months off. We're good." Well,
[1:27:36] guess what? I quit my job. Brother Jonah
[1:27:40] calls me. He says, "I'm going elk
[1:27:41] company hunting. Come take my church
[1:27:42] while I'm gone." So I that week was gone
[1:27:45] and then I went back and I hunted for a
[1:27:47] day and a half and I got a job offer and
[1:27:48] I had to come back and start
[1:27:50] work. Church, God takes care of his
[1:27:53] people.
[1:27:54] We're not meant to sit here and be so
[1:27:56] overwhelmed and overcome by something as
[1:27:59] simple as money and he's taken care of
[1:28:02] me time and time and time again. You
[1:28:05] know, we look at ambition. We want to be
[1:28:07] the biggest. We want to be the best. We
[1:28:09] want to be the greatest. We want to be
[1:28:10] the fastest, the strongest, the
[1:28:11] wealthiest, whatever that might be. And
[1:28:13] I'll tell you, church, if that's in the
[1:28:15] will of God, it will take extreme
[1:28:17] character. And if you have extreme
[1:28:20] character, then that's going to take
[1:28:21] extreme testing. Because remember,
[1:28:23] character is a victory, not a gift. And
[1:28:26] so, if you go through something like
[1:28:28] that and you want to be the absolute
[1:28:29] best in this world in God's will, he's
[1:28:32] going to put you through character
[1:28:33] testing like nobody else. I read
[1:28:35] something and this is this isn't exactly
[1:28:36] what it said because I couldn't find it
[1:28:38] but it said people envy successful
[1:28:40] people but they never envy the path that
[1:28:42] got them
[1:28:43] there. You look at what happens in the
[1:28:46] scriptures to to men and women of God
[1:28:48] that achieve great things. You talk
[1:28:51] about a path of character
[1:28:52] development. Absolutely incredible. You
[1:28:55] want to be the
[1:28:57] greatest? You got to be like the least.
[1:28:59] You got to humble yourselves. You got to
[1:29:01] surrender yourselves. Amen. You got to
[1:29:03] go through the development program for
[1:29:05] extreme character if you want to be the
[1:29:07] greatest in the kingdom. That's the only
[1:29:08] way God can use you. Otherwise, you'll
[1:29:10] be the greatest thing in the world, but
[1:29:11] you'll never be in the kingdom of God.
[1:29:13] It doesn't exist that way. It just
[1:29:14] doesn't work that
[1:29:16] way. Paul said, "All things work
[1:29:18] together for good." He never said, "All
[1:29:20] things feel good." This is not a
[1:29:22] Christian walk of great feelings. Amen.
[1:29:24] It's a walk of faith. Amen. We can't go
[1:29:27] by the feelings of the situation. We
[1:29:28] have to come back to the promise of the
[1:29:30] situation time and time again.
[1:29:33] just to express this because we can feel
[1:29:37] broken. We can feel mashed up sometimes.
[1:29:40] We can feel
[1:29:41] overwhelmed and we say that's not of
[1:29:44] God. Sometimes it is cuz sometimes he's
[1:29:47] got to get us out of our own way so that
[1:29:49] he can start doing the work. And he's
[1:29:51] got to get you to the point where you
[1:29:53] say, "I'm going to give up." And he
[1:29:54] says, "Wonderful. I've been waiting for
[1:29:56] you to give up so I could start doing
[1:29:57] the work." All right, listen to this
[1:30:00] story. He says, "My old shepherd story
[1:30:02] used to be that they said there was a
[1:30:03] man passing down through Palestine once
[1:30:05] and he had a sheep there and he had its
[1:30:07] leg broken." And this man said, "Oh,
[1:30:08] it's too bad, sir. Your sheep broke its
[1:30:10] leg, I guess." He said, "No, I broke
[1:30:12] it." Why? He said, "You cruelhearted
[1:30:15] shepherd. You mean you broke your own
[1:30:16] sheep's leg?" Said, "Yes, I did it for
[1:30:19] this purpose." He said, 'I couldn't make
[1:30:21] her mind me, and so I broke her leg so I
[1:30:25] could show her how much I love her, give
[1:30:27] her some special food, and pat her a
[1:30:29] little bit. Said that makes her love me,
[1:30:32] and when her legs healed up, she'll
[1:30:34] follow me right along. He says it'll
[1:30:36] keep her out of trouble. He says, God
[1:30:39] does that sometimes. He lets something
[1:30:42] strike you so that he can show you a
[1:30:45] little extra mercy. You know, just a
[1:30:47] little of his goodness so that you'll
[1:30:49] walk a little closer to him. He says the
[1:30:53] Bible said that all things work together
[1:30:54] for good to them that love God. So, it
[1:30:56] has to be for the good. God just lets
[1:30:59] that happen so it would be for the good
[1:31:01] because he's a good God. He's wonderful.
[1:31:04] You want the You want a biblical example
[1:31:07] of that? Go look at Moses.
[1:31:10] Moses raised in the Pharaoh's home,
[1:31:12] educated. He was a man of mighty works,
[1:31:14] a mighty general, a man of great
[1:31:16] education. He got all sorts of ideas in
[1:31:18] his head. And God said, "All right, go
[1:31:19] do it." God didn't say, "Go do it." God
[1:31:22] let him do it, I should say. And what
[1:31:23] did he do? He went out and he killed an
[1:31:24] Egyptian. And then he ran for his life
[1:31:26] in the desert. And he spent 40 years in
[1:31:28] the desert of God breaking his
[1:31:29] intellectual leg, of God breaking his
[1:31:32] educational leg, of God breaking his
[1:31:35] that that farce of human ability we
[1:31:37] talked about last time. So he'd say,
[1:31:39] "All right, I don't want anything to do
[1:31:42] with being a deliverer." And then God
[1:31:43] said, "Go down to Egypt. Moses, you're
[1:31:44] my deliverer." God broke him. Look at
[1:31:47] Paul going along. God knocks him off of
[1:31:49] his horse and makes him blind for three
[1:31:52] days. He breaks his vision for three
[1:31:56] days so that Paul will stay in prayer
[1:31:58] and find the mind of God for the
[1:31:59] situation. And then after that, what
[1:32:01] does God do to Paul? God gives him an
[1:32:04] eye
[1:32:05] problem. Why? Paul says, "I went to God
[1:32:08] three times and asked him to take it
[1:32:10] away." And God said, "Paul, my grace is
[1:32:13] sufficient for thee. My strength is made
[1:32:16] perfect in weakness." He said, "Paul,
[1:32:18] this is on you to keep you from getting
[1:32:21] prideful of all the revelation that you
[1:32:24] have." In other words, God broke his
[1:32:27] vision leg so that Paul would stay
[1:32:29] closer to him. He wouldn't get so worked
[1:32:32] up. Why? Because it meant Paul would
[1:32:34] have to rely on somebody else to help
[1:32:35] him through life. now write his letters,
[1:32:38] do those sorts of things. Look, Job lost
[1:32:41] all that he had so that God could give
[1:32:42] him a revelation of what lay beyond the
[1:32:44] grave. And Job in all of that, he says,
[1:32:47] "Though he slay me, yet I'll trust him."
[1:32:49] Says, "In this, Job sinned not
[1:32:51] foolishly, nor charged
[1:32:54] God." Why? He
[1:32:56] trusted. It hurts, but God's in it. It
[1:33:01] hurts, but I'm a child of God, and so
[1:33:03] I've got some faith here.
[1:33:08] Jacob walked with a limp for the rest of
[1:33:10] his life after he wrestled with God. And
[1:33:13] what was that limp a reminder of,
[1:33:15] church? It was a reminder that he had
[1:33:18] found favor with God. That limp every
[1:33:21] day was a constant reminder of the
[1:33:23] calling of God and the grace of God in
[1:33:25] Jacob's life. Israel, he went from the
[1:33:28] shyer to a prince having power of God,
[1:33:30] but yet he walked with a limp.
[1:33:32] God let the children of Israel get
[1:33:34] defeated, enslaved, trampled on time and
[1:33:36] time again. Why? To bring them back to
[1:33:38] him. He was trying to get them back to
[1:33:40] where the blessing was. And he didn't
[1:33:41] mind if a leg or two got broken in it.
[1:33:43] Why? Because it's for our good in the
[1:33:46] big
[1:33:47] picture. He says it works together for
[1:33:49] good to who? To them that love God.
[1:33:54] Notice it doesn't say it works together
[1:33:56] for my
[1:33:57] good or just your good. It's for the
[1:34:01] collective group. So sometimes my
[1:34:04] hardship is for your benefit and
[1:34:07] sometimes your hardship is for my
[1:34:09] benefit. I may personally get nothing
[1:34:12] out of it. It's my burden to bear, but
[1:34:15] you're going to get something good out
[1:34:16] of
[1:34:17] it. Why? Because we're a body and
[1:34:20] sometimes it's hard on one part of the
[1:34:21] body for the benefit of the other.
[1:34:23] Listen, I'm a pastor. I go through
[1:34:25] hardship on a daily basis. not these
[1:34:28] massive loads that maybe some of you
[1:34:30] bear in time, but it's a constant load.
[1:34:32] And so I give up my evenings. I give up
[1:34:35] my weekends. I give up my sunny days for
[1:34:38] your sake. And sometimes I wake up in
[1:34:41] the morning and I've got a pit in my
[1:34:43] stomach because I don't know what I'm
[1:34:44] supposed to preach. And until I find
[1:34:46] that, I've got to deal with that in my
[1:34:48] life. And it is a source of anxiety and
[1:34:50] it is a source of unrest because you're
[1:34:52] seeking and you're waiting and you're
[1:34:53] seeking and you're waiting. That's a
[1:34:55] hardship that I deal with.
[1:34:57] But it's for your benefit. It's for your
[1:35:00] good, not just for mine. Think of
[1:35:01] brother Jonathan Martin that was just
[1:35:03] here last week. God broke his rest on a
[1:35:06] night when he needed it above all else
[1:35:09] to give us a message. Woke him up at 2
[1:35:11] a.m. I talked to brother Jonathan. He
[1:35:13] says, "When I woke up," he says, "I
[1:35:14] wasn't frustrated because I knew that
[1:35:16] God was in it." He says, "And so as soon
[1:35:18] as I" He gave me the thought, he says,
[1:35:19] "I wrote it down, looked up what I need
[1:35:21] to." He says, "And I closed it, and I
[1:35:23] went right back to sleep." Not
[1:35:25] frustrated, not mad. Why? Because all
[1:35:28] things work together for good to them
[1:35:30] that love God. We're servants. Servants.
[1:35:34] Serving is not always comfortable. But
[1:35:37] there's a benefit that's going to work
[1:35:38] for all of us. Amen. There are times
[1:35:40] where your hardship produces a testimony
[1:35:43] that helps somebody else get through
[1:35:44] their walk, get through their day, get
[1:35:46] through their situation. Sometimes our
[1:35:48] interrupted plans are to help somebody
[1:35:50] else who's going through an interruption
[1:35:51] as well. They say, "Listen, if they're
[1:35:53] going through it, I can go through it.
[1:35:55] If they're handling that gracefully,
[1:35:56] then I can do the same thing." Look,
[1:35:58] Jesus, remember, was headed to Galilee
[1:36:01] from Judea, and he says, "I have to go
[1:36:03] through Samaria." Now, the Jews always
[1:36:05] went around to go to Galilee from Judea.
[1:36:10] Jesus said, "I have to go through
[1:36:12] Samaria." And he invited criticism
[1:36:15] because he went to a place where they
[1:36:17] were of mixed religion. They were of
[1:36:19] mixed blood. They were they were not
[1:36:22] people that the Jews had any time with.
[1:36:24] And so Jesus now comes under criticism.
[1:36:26] He goes through a hardship because of
[1:36:28] what? One soul waiting for him at the
[1:36:30] well. And he takes her to salvation
[1:36:34] under his
[1:36:36] hardship. It's for his. It wasn't for
[1:36:38] his benefit. It was for hers. But
[1:36:40] remember what happened after he has gone
[1:36:42] through that hardship. They say, "Are
[1:36:44] you hungry?" He says, "I've had meat
[1:36:45] that you know nothing of." What? He he
[1:36:47] was satisfied in the moment. In his
[1:36:50] hardship, he was satisfied with what he
[1:36:52] went through. Sometimes we go through
[1:36:54] individual life changing hardships or
[1:36:57] situations. And we say, "How was this
[1:37:00] good? How can God be in
[1:37:04] this?" It's a daily grind. It's a daily
[1:37:07] condition. Amen. That burden. And like I
[1:37:10] said, even having this eye condition, it
[1:37:12] gave me a heart for those of you that
[1:37:14] deal with things. And we can sit there
[1:37:17] and we can say, "Why do I have this?"
[1:37:20] We've seen God heal person after person
[1:37:22] and yet I'm sitting here unhealed.
[1:37:25] Why? Let's take it back to the
[1:37:28] word. Says, "And as Jesus passed by, he
[1:37:31] saw a man which was blind from his
[1:37:33] birth. And his disciples asked him,
[1:37:35] saying, Master, who did sin, this man or
[1:37:37] his parents that he was born blind?" And
[1:37:40] the amplified says, "Jesus answered
[1:37:42] said, 'N neither this man nor his
[1:37:44] parents sin, but it was so that the
[1:37:46] works of God might be displayed and
[1:37:49] illustrated in him." This man endured a
[1:37:52] lifetime of blindness, a lifetime of
[1:37:55] seeing nothing, a lifetime of relying on
[1:37:58] people, not being able to work. Maybe he
[1:38:00] never had a wife and kids. I don't know.
[1:38:01] We don't really know. And Jesus said he
[1:38:04] was born this way to show the works of
[1:38:07] God in his life. Amen. It was to give a
[1:38:10] testimony of the healing power of God,
[1:38:13] of the reality to the words that they
[1:38:15] had been hearing for over a thousand
[1:38:16] years. It was to show them that God was
[1:38:19] on the scene. And it was to give this
[1:38:21] man now a testimony of the healing power
[1:38:24] of God. But not only that, God heals
[1:38:26] him, but then he comes around to Jesus
[1:38:28] and he says, "You got to follow, you got
[1:38:30] to worship the the son of God." He says,
[1:38:32] "Lord, who is he?" He says, "It's I that
[1:38:34] speaketh to thee." And what happened is
[1:38:35] God brought him to a place of true
[1:38:37] worship and of real salvation. Took him
[1:38:40] out of his denomination and brought him
[1:38:42] to the feet of Jesus. All of that was to
[1:38:45] bring that man to a place of true
[1:38:46] worship and
[1:38:49] salvation. It was for good even though
[1:38:52] it didn't seem very good for all those
[1:38:54] years. Consider that church. He was born
[1:38:56] with a condition and he never did
[1:38:59] anything to deserve it.
[1:39:02] We've all got them. We have genetic
[1:39:06] issues. We've got personality issues.
[1:39:08] We've got learning disabilities. We've
[1:39:11] got chronic conditions. We've got pains.
[1:39:13] We've got sufferings. We've got
[1:39:15] issues. And we didn't ask for it. We
[1:39:18] didn't deserve it. We didn't make a bad
[1:39:21] decision and get this. We just have
[1:39:24] it. And we say, "Why? Why me? Why do I
[1:39:28] have to deal with it?"
[1:39:30] We're answering the question, it's for
[1:39:32] the
[1:39:33] good. And we have to trust in the
[1:39:36] sovereignty of God. It's for the
[1:39:38] good. You know, we we've read that
[1:39:40] story, remember where brother Brand was
[1:39:42] flying and they brought the plane down
[1:39:44] because of bad weather in Tennessee. And
[1:39:46] so it came down. He had to spend the
[1:39:47] night there and then he gets up and the
[1:39:48] Holy Spirit leads him out and he finds
[1:39:50] that woman whose son is dying and she's
[1:39:52] been praying through the night and she's
[1:39:54] waiting out at the fence and as he goes
[1:39:55] by she says, "Howdy, Parson?" He's like,
[1:39:57] "How do you know him?" And so she tells
[1:39:59] him the story. She said, "I've been
[1:40:00] waiting for Elijah and God told me to
[1:40:02] come out here and wait." So he goes in
[1:40:04] and he prays. But when he prays, he
[1:40:05] says, "God, now I know that you're in
[1:40:08] the situation and all things work
[1:40:11] together for good." God broke his
[1:40:15] itinerary. Listen, we have our
[1:40:17] itineraries busted up all the time from
[1:40:19] here. I have learned to say, "Just trust
[1:40:22] the Lord." It can be an annoyance, it
[1:40:24] can be a frustration, or it can be,
[1:40:27] "It's okay. God's in it." And we don't
[1:40:29] know why. We don't have to know why. God
[1:40:31] doesn't always tell us why, but we can
[1:40:32] trust that God's in it. And just our
[1:40:35] attitude and how we deal with it can
[1:40:36] tell so much to other people that are
[1:40:38] around us. Absolutely, it can. You all
[1:40:41] know of my sister Elena who went through
[1:40:43] stage four cancer. That wasn't any fun.
[1:40:46] I hope you know that. They didn't expect
[1:40:48] her to live. But in nine weeks, she had
[1:40:51] a total deliverance, but those nine
[1:40:53] weeks were hell. She couldn't get up for
[1:40:56] more than an hour or a hour and a half
[1:40:58] total throughout her day. She'd get up
[1:41:01] and she'd work for five or 10 minutes
[1:41:02] and then she'd have to go sit down or
[1:41:04] lay down for nine weeks losing her hair,
[1:41:09] losing weight, and if you know Atlanta,
[1:41:11] a stiff wind blow away. She didn't have
[1:41:12] any weight to
[1:41:14] lose. She went through stage four cancer
[1:41:17] that should have killed
[1:41:18] her. And what did she come out the other
[1:41:20] side with? One, she came out with a
[1:41:23] personal testimony. God still heals. But
[1:41:25] I can't tell you how many people I've
[1:41:27] talked to, dozens and dozens of people
[1:41:29] that said her testimony inspired me to
[1:41:32] believe for my
[1:41:33] situation. So what it was for the good,
[1:41:37] not just for her good. And so many
[1:41:40] people, thousands and thousands of
[1:41:42] people have seen that testimony. People
[1:41:44] that don't believe in God, people whose
[1:41:46] churches don't believe in divine
[1:41:47] healing, now they can go and they can
[1:41:49] see her testimony leaning on the
[1:41:51] everlasting arms. It's for the
[1:41:55] good. Amen. We testify he's a savior.
[1:41:58] That means we need to get in a condition
[1:41:59] that requires saving. We testify that
[1:42:01] he's a healer. That means we need to get
[1:42:02] in situations where we need healing.
[1:42:04] He's a provider. We need to get in
[1:42:06] situations where we need provision. For
[1:42:08] him to display his attributes and his
[1:42:10] word through us, we've got to be in
[1:42:11] conditions that are needful. And so
[1:42:13] God's in it for our
[1:42:16] good. Like I said, Job said, "Though he
[1:42:18] slay me, yet I'll trust him." We've got
[1:42:21] to have that. I found this in the most
[1:42:23] obscure place. What a wonderful
[1:42:25] scripture in Naam. It says, "The Lord is
[1:42:28] good." He says, "A stronghold in the day
[1:42:31] of trouble, and he knoweth them that
[1:42:34] trust in him." Can we say this morning,
[1:42:37] the Lord is good. Amen. The Lord is
[1:42:40] good. He He's a stronghold in the day of
[1:42:42] trouble, and he knows them that trust
[1:42:44] him. Thank you, Lord. Amen. He's good.
[1:42:46] It's always for our good. I think it was
[1:42:49] brother Matt shared this quote just
[1:42:50] earlier this week and I thought it was
[1:42:52] timely for this service. He says, "God
[1:42:54] has counted you worthy when you have a
[1:42:57] test." He says, "Now don't fail to get
[1:43:00] this. When you have a trial or a test,
[1:43:02] it shows the grace of
[1:43:06] God." We don't like that kind of grace,
[1:43:10] do we?
[1:43:12] When God gives you a trial or a test
[1:43:15] that shows the grace of God, he says,
[1:43:17] "You have found favor with God and God
[1:43:20] believes you'll stand the test." This is
[1:43:23] a scriptural principle. Time and time
[1:43:25] again, people walk up to circumstances,
[1:43:27] situation, walls, battles,
[1:43:29] impossibilities, and God puts them right
[1:43:31] in it. And what does he do? Takes them
[1:43:34] through. Takes them through. Takes them
[1:43:36] through. What is it? It's the grace of
[1:43:38] God to show you that he's with you. that
[1:43:40] he takes you
[1:43:42] through. He says, "You remember he did
[1:43:44] the same thing by Job." Satan said, "Oh,
[1:43:46] yeah. I seen Job down there." God said,
[1:43:48] "He's a perfect servant. There's none
[1:43:50] earth like him. There's nobody like Job.
[1:43:52] He's a perfect man now. He's my pride
[1:43:55] and joy." Satan said, "Oh, sure. He gets
[1:43:57] everything he asks for. Let me have him
[1:44:00] once. I'll make him curse you to your
[1:44:02] very face." God said, "He's in your
[1:44:03] hands, but don't you take his life." He
[1:44:05] said, "See, God had confidence in Job."
[1:44:09] Church, how do we treat our pride and
[1:44:11] joy? We give them everything they
[1:44:13] want. Our kids do well. We give them
[1:44:16] whatever we can give them. We want them
[1:44:18] to have a better life than we do. They
[1:44:19] do well then we do well to them. That's
[1:44:21] how we treat our pride and joy. When God
[1:44:24] gives his best to us, what is
[1:44:28] it? Trials and
[1:44:31] tribulations. Because he has confidence
[1:44:33] you're ready for it.
[1:44:35] He says, "When it looks like everything
[1:44:37] has gone wrong, God's giving you a
[1:44:39] trial. He's got confidence in you. He
[1:44:43] doesn't have to baby you around. You're
[1:44:44] not a hotbed plant, a hybrid. You're a
[1:44:47] real Christian. God has given you a test
[1:44:49] to see what you'll do about it." He
[1:44:51] says, "No wonder Peter said, "These
[1:44:53] fiery trials, why? Count it a joy. It's
[1:44:55] more precious to you than
[1:44:59] gold." We face trials. We face hard
[1:45:02] times, heart-wrenching experiences,
[1:45:04] sickness, pain, suffering, and we sit
[1:45:05] there and we say, "Why
[1:45:08] me, wrong
[1:45:11] question, wrong
[1:45:15] question." Question is, wow, he really
[1:45:19] has confidence in
[1:45:22] me. There must be more to me than I
[1:45:24] think.
[1:45:28] See, so often we're on the delusions of
[1:45:30] competency on the things that don't
[1:45:31] matter and then we come up to the things
[1:45:33] that do and we say, "How am I going to
[1:45:34] do this?" That's what God does. He puts
[1:45:36] us in situations where we think we can't
[1:45:37] make it. He says, "Listen, you got
[1:45:38] this." Because greater is he that's in
[1:45:40] you than he that's in the world. Amen.
[1:45:43] That's what he's trying to do. He's
[1:45:45] trying to get you to see, I'm with you.
[1:45:48] There's an expected end. There's a
[1:45:50] purpose. There's a plan behind all of
[1:45:51] these things. It is for
[1:45:54] good. You want the answer? Why? It is
[1:45:57] for your good. It is for the good is
[1:46:00] really what the scripture says. It's for
[1:46:02] good. Listen, if I'm proud of my sons
[1:46:04] for their strength, I've got no problem
[1:46:06] putting them into a situation that
[1:46:07] requires strength. I remember when we
[1:46:09] were in BC and the pastor there was was
[1:46:12] building a home and he had to do a bunch
[1:46:13] of clearing, breaking of concrete and
[1:46:15] moving rocks and stuff. And we went over
[1:46:17] and we worked for hours and hours. I got
[1:46:20] this hilarious picture of of Jensen and
[1:46:22] he's just covered in mud head to toe.
[1:46:24] But guess what? I had confidence that we
[1:46:26] could do the job. So, I don't have any
[1:46:28] limitation on us on going out and doing
[1:46:30] some work for a day. Hard manual labor.
[1:46:33] We've got strength to do it. And we went
[1:46:34] out and they said, "Boy, we can't
[1:46:35] believe you came out and did this all
[1:46:37] day." Well, why not? We're available.
[1:46:39] We'll come out and help
[1:46:41] you. What? We give them tasks
[1:46:44] commensurate with what they've
[1:46:46] got. Listen, if I believe my daughter
[1:46:49] has great character, then I don't have
[1:46:51] any issues putting her in a situation
[1:46:52] that requires great character. Put
[1:46:55] somebody in a place where there's a
[1:46:56] conflict of interest, where they can
[1:46:57] leverage things for their benefit rather
[1:46:59] than somebody else. You need great
[1:47:01] character, but that's what you pick is
[1:47:02] somebody that's got great character. And
[1:47:04] the push and the pull of that situation
[1:47:05] won't get to them because they're
[1:47:06] anchored. They've got what it takes to
[1:47:08] go through those things. Same thing with
[1:47:10] God. Having prepared us, having taught
[1:47:13] us, what does he do now? He tests us. He
[1:47:16] says, "Here, let's put everything you've
[1:47:18] learned, everything you've gone through,
[1:47:20] let's put it into action. Let's let you
[1:47:23] see what you've got after all of
[1:47:25] this." It's always amazing, you know, if
[1:47:27] you work with kids or you coach kids and
[1:47:30] you do a lot of work with them and you
[1:47:32] get them to do something, but then you
[1:47:33] bring them up to something that's
[1:47:34] greater than they've ever tried, but you
[1:47:36] know, you've given them the tools,
[1:47:37] you've given them the strength, you've
[1:47:39] given them the speed, you've given them
[1:47:40] the skills, and then you say, "Here, go
[1:47:42] do this." And they say, "I've never done
[1:47:43] it before." But you say, "But you've
[1:47:44] done every portion of it in bits." Now,
[1:47:47] put it all
[1:47:48] together. You know, when you're lifting
[1:47:50] weights, you never lift your max all the
[1:47:52] time. You lift to a certain percentage
[1:47:54] of that. But then there's a day where we
[1:47:56] say, "Hey, we're going to do a max out
[1:47:57] day. We're going to do a personal record
[1:47:58] day." And what do they do? They always
[1:48:00] lift more than they thought they could
[1:48:01] lift because their strength was being
[1:48:03] built up in smaller ways. And when you
[1:48:05] put it all together, they've got
[1:48:07] strength to go through and lift what
[1:48:08] they're supposed to lift.
[1:48:12] He says it works together for good to
[1:48:14] them that love God. Now we come down to
[1:48:16] some clarity. He says to them who are
[1:48:18] the called according to his purpose.
[1:48:21] Amen. This is the perspective we want.
[1:48:22] This is the eternal perspective. He says
[1:48:25] it all works together for those who are
[1:48:26] called according to his purpose. It does
[1:48:28] not say just to them that love God.
[1:48:32] Because remember the scripture says in
[1:48:33] that day they'll say Lord,
[1:48:34] Lord. How many people are in church this
[1:48:37] morning saying Jesus I love you. and
[1:48:39] they won't receive his
[1:48:41] word. Jesus said, "If you love me,
[1:48:43] you'll you'll do my commandments. You'll
[1:48:44] do what my word says." Lots of people
[1:48:46] are going to say, "I love you, Lord."
[1:48:48] But he's not their Lord. He's not their
[1:48:51] Lord. So the the condition here is not
[1:48:53] just that those that love God, but it's
[1:48:55] those that are the called. It's the
[1:48:56] elected one. Amen. It's for those that
[1:48:58] are called according to his purpose. So
[1:49:00] in other words, everything you're going
[1:49:02] through is based on the fact that God's
[1:49:04] got a purpose for you. He's got a plan
[1:49:06] for you. He's got an end that is waiting
[1:49:09] for you and it's an expected end
[1:49:10] according to the word. What's his plan?
[1:49:13] What's God's plan? What's this whole
[1:49:15] book about, church? There's one theme to
[1:49:17] this
[1:49:18] book. What is
[1:49:21] it, brother Mark? What is
[1:49:23] it? Amen. The love of God
[1:49:27] through redemption. It's redemption.
[1:49:30] This is a redemption book. The whole
[1:49:31] thing is about redemption. It's all
[1:49:33] types and shadows up to the New
[1:49:34] Testament and then it's all redemption
[1:49:36] after that. It's God coming back to us.
[1:49:38] Amen. It's a walk of faith. It's the
[1:49:40] love of God though. It is a book of
[1:49:42] love. It is a love letter. But what is
[1:49:44] its purpose? To bring us back to him. So
[1:49:47] everything he does, listen, if he's got
[1:49:49] to cut some things out of our life that
[1:49:51] hurt, he'll do it because he's redeeming
[1:49:53] us back to him. He's not redeeming us
[1:49:54] back to the world.
[1:49:56] Everything he does is to draw us back to
[1:49:58] him, to our relation, to our position,
[1:50:01] to our authority, to our word benefits.
[1:50:04] Everything is that I've said this
[1:50:06] before. One of my prior pastors, he
[1:50:08] says, "Agape love, God's love is based
[1:50:10] on spiritual growth." And I think that's
[1:50:12] the the perfect statement. God is
[1:50:14] looking to grow us into sons and
[1:50:16] daughters of God. Not wealthy, not
[1:50:20] healthy, not affluent, not successful.
[1:50:23] That's all. These things will be added
[1:50:25] to you. Seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:50:27] God. He's turning us. He's returning us
[1:50:29] back to our position as sons and
[1:50:31] daughters of God. And it's elective love
[1:50:33] that does it. It's elective love that we
[1:50:36] preached on just a few services ago.
[1:50:38] Amen. It's got to work out for good
[1:50:39] because he's elected us for good. And in
[1:50:43] the meantime, what's going on, church?
[1:50:45] What do we do between now and full
[1:50:47] redemption? It's the works of Christ.
[1:50:49] And what are the works of Christ? To
[1:50:51] destroy the works of the devil.
[1:50:53] to destroy the works of the devil in
[1:50:55] this flesh, in our mind, in our hearts,
[1:50:58] wherever it might be, the Holy Spirit's
[1:51:00] there to take us through those purifying
[1:51:02] elements so that what comes out is the
[1:51:05] same character that Christ had. And
[1:51:08] that's one thing. I'll stay with the
[1:51:09] word. Why? Because it's become me and
[1:51:12] I've become it. That's what's going
[1:51:15] on. Everything that expected end is a
[1:51:18] complete and total redemption. body,
[1:51:20] soul, and spirit back to God. That's the
[1:51:23] end of it all. So, the manifestation of
[1:51:26] Christ in you is to destroy the works of
[1:51:28] the devil always. It's to take us from
[1:51:31] that broken slavery that we were born
[1:51:33] into and turn us into the liberty of
[1:51:35] sons and daughters of God. Amen. One
[1:51:38] quote and we'll close. He says,
[1:51:39] "Whatever it
[1:51:41] is, all things work together for good."
[1:51:45] He says, "You just can't lose when you
[1:51:47] become a Christian. you just can't lose.
[1:51:50] He says just trust in him and whatever
[1:51:52] the way goes, just keep your sail set to
[1:51:54] his spirit. He will guide you into the
[1:51:56] harbor. He says it'll be all right.
[1:52:00] Amen. God bless you. Let's stand if we
[1:52:05] would. You know, I've lost my health,
[1:52:08] dealt with serious issues for a long
[1:52:10] time. Throughout my life, I went through
[1:52:12] almost a year of insomnia, chronic pain
[1:52:15] after a bad car accident. I felt so sick
[1:52:18] that I thought I was dying. I had no
[1:52:20] strength. I was literally laying on the
[1:52:23] cold, cooling tiles of my bedroom, of my
[1:52:26] bathroom in Edmonton. And all I could do
[1:52:29] was tell Blanc, I said, "Pray for me.
[1:52:31] Pray for me. I feel like I'm
[1:52:34] dying. I've lost jobs. I've lost
[1:52:38] favor. I've lost ministry opportunities.
[1:52:41] I've lost fellowship. I've lost pastors.
[1:52:43] I've lost friends.
[1:52:46] I'll tell you some of those things I
[1:52:47] still don't know why they happened, but
[1:52:50] I'll tell you there's a lot of them I
[1:52:51] do, but in the moment they felt
[1:52:54] absolutely horrible. Many of you know
[1:52:57] the things that went on in Texas when we
[1:52:59] lost our pastor and these different
[1:53:01] things, lost a close friend,
[1:53:05] deceived. We go through these things and
[1:53:07] we sit there and we say,
[1:53:09] "Woof, Lord, save me. Lord, don't make
[1:53:12] me go through this. Lord, why am I going
[1:53:14] through this? But I'll tell you this,
[1:53:16] that the ones that he showed me it's for
[1:53:18] my good, it's been wonderfully for my
[1:53:20] good. Not just kind of sort of good, but
[1:53:23] it's truly been for my good because it
[1:53:26] keeps pointing me back to him. It keeps
[1:53:28] tying me back to him. Gets me off
[1:53:31] myself. Gets me off my abilities. Gets
[1:53:33] me off relying on anything except him
[1:53:35] and him alone. Because I don't care how
[1:53:38] much you appreciate or admire me or
[1:53:40] respect me or the people in this church,
[1:53:42] we're going to fail you. We fail each
[1:53:44] other day in and day out. But there's a
[1:53:47] friend that sticks closer than a
[1:53:48] brother. Thank
[1:53:49] God. There's a friend that sticks closer
[1:53:52] than a brother. And I've learned in life
[1:53:54] when he's asked me to let stuff go, he's
[1:53:57] got something better waiting for me.
[1:54:00] When he's asked me to give things up,
[1:54:02] it's because he's got something he's
[1:54:03] ready to hand over. And sometimes he's
[1:54:06] got to rip things out.
[1:54:07] And that's his work. And sometimes he's
[1:54:10] got to place things in because those
[1:54:12] things will refine us in a way that
[1:54:14] nothing else will. And we've got to be
[1:54:15] able to sit there and say, "Lord, be it
[1:54:17] unto
[1:54:17] me. We're just clay in the potter's
[1:54:22] hands." But Romans 8 says, "All things
[1:54:25] all things work together for good."
[1:54:29] Amen. I don't know what you're going
[1:54:31] through this morning. I know what some
[1:54:32] of you are going through. It's for your
[1:54:34] good. It's for our good.
[1:54:37] We've got to be unselfish enough to let
[1:54:39] it be for somebody else's good
[1:54:41] sometimes. Amen. That we can stand there
[1:54:43] and with grace and with patience stand
[1:54:45] the trials and run the race that
[1:54:48] somebody else could get the benefit.
[1:54:50] Amen. Let's bow our heads if we
[1:54:53] would. Lord
[1:54:55] Jesus, Lord, if there's one thing I know
[1:54:58] this morning, Lord, is that you've never
[1:55:01] forsaken us. Lord, you've always been
[1:55:04] there, Lord. But even when we can't seem
[1:55:06] to see or hear or feel, Lord, it doesn't
[1:55:09] mean you're not there, Lord. But you
[1:55:11] said you'd be with us, even in us to the
[1:55:13] end of the
[1:55:14] age, Lord. It's your promise that Lord,
[1:55:18] what you've started, you'll be faithful
[1:55:19] to complete it in our lives. And so,
[1:55:22] Lord, we're standing here this morning,
[1:55:23] Lord, and we want to worship you and
[1:55:25] praise you, Lord. We want to confess
[1:55:27] that we know everything we're going
[1:55:28] through is for our good, Lord. Lord that
[1:55:31] when hardships arise, when scarcity
[1:55:33] comes, when sickness hits our door,
[1:55:35] Lord, the promise is still for us, but
[1:55:37] there's a purging, there's a cleansing,
[1:55:39] Lord, there's a creation of character
[1:55:41] that happens in those moments, Lord, and
[1:55:43] we've got to be willing to go through
[1:55:45] it. Lord, I pray you give us patience
[1:55:47] for the trials. I pray you give us
[1:55:48] confidence, Lord. Give us the right
[1:55:50] attitude, Heavenly Father. Lord, that as
[1:55:52] we come up against situations, Lord, may
[1:55:54] we say, "Lord, I'm looking with
[1:55:57] expectation for you in this situation,
[1:56:00] Lord, rather than holding back in dread,
[1:56:02] fear, wonder, anxiety, Lord, let us be
[1:56:06] able to walk through it with faith and
[1:56:07] confidence, Lord, knowing that you're in
[1:56:09] all these
[1:56:10] things. Lord, I pray your grace on this
[1:56:13] people. Lord, you strengthen us,
[1:56:15] encourage us day by day. Lord, help us
[1:56:16] to feed on the right things. Lord, help
[1:56:18] us to experience and dwell in your
[1:56:20] presence day by day. Lord, let us not
[1:56:23] take for granted this wonderful gift
[1:56:25] we've been given. Lord, of a word that
[1:56:27] we can see and hear that lives through
[1:56:29] us day by day. Lord, help us not to live
[1:56:31] below our privileges this morning. We
[1:56:33] pray, Lord, we're looking to you. In
[1:56:36] Jesus Christ's name we ask it.
[1:56:41] Amen. Psalm 34, I sought the Lord.
[1:56:51] 1274 I sought the
[1:56:56] Lord and he answered me. Thank you,
[1:56:59] Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:57:01] And deliver
[1:57:05] me from every
[1:57:09] fear. Those who look on
[1:57:13] him are
[1:57:17] radant. They'll never be
[1:57:22] ashamed. They'll never be
[1:57:26] ashamed. This poor man
[1:57:31] cried. And the Lord heard
[1:57:35] me and save me
[1:57:39] from my
[1:57:44] eneies. The son of God, hallelujah,
[1:57:49] surrounds his
[1:57:52] saint. He will deliver them.
[1:57:58] He will deliver there.
[1:58:02] Oh,

[1:58:06] Lord with me.

[1:58:52] fear. Those who look are
[1:58:58] li are
[1:59:01] radant. They'll never be
[1:59:06] ashamed. They'll never be
[1:59:10] ashamed. And this poor man cried,
[1:59:15] hallelujah. And the Lord heard me.
[1:59:19] Hallelujah. and save me

[1:59:27] eneies. The son of
[1:59:32] God surround his

[2:02:20] me. Come
[2:02:23] exalt his
[2:02:25] name forever. ever.
[2:02:30] Amen. Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[2:02:34] I will praise the mighty name of Jesus.
[2:02:40] 12:36. My trled soul,
[2:02:45] [Music]
[2:02:46] why so weigh down?
[2:02:50] And you were not
[2:02:52] made to bear this heavy
[2:02:58] load. Cast all your
[2:03:02] burdens upon the
[2:03:07] Lord. Jesus
[2:03:10] cares. He cares for
[2:03:15] you. And Jesus cares.
[2:03:20] He cares for you
[2:03:24] and all your
[2:03:26] woring won't help you make it
[2:03:31] through. Cast all your
[2:03:34] [Music]
[2:03:36] burdens upon the
[2:03:40] Lord. Trust
[2:03:43] again in the promise of his love.
[2:03:49] And I will
[2:03:51] praise the
[2:03:54] mighty
[2:03:55] name of
[2:03:58] Jesus. Praise the Lord, the lifter of my
