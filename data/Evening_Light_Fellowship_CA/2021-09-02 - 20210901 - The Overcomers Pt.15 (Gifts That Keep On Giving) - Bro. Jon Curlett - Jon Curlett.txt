tonight amen and lord we're thankful that we can lift our hands lord that we can lift our voices lord that we can worship you here tonight yes but lord we're coming with needs as well or we're coming with lives that need to be changed or we're coming with issues lord we're coming with lord a desire to be drawn closer to you heavenly father and that's a work that only you can do in our lives the lord your prophet told us that if we could have a desire for it lord it meant that there is a way to meet the need or that there is a great jehovah lord the the jehovah gyra that sees the need and meets it lord that even puts the desire in us to call for it in the first place and lord we pray that you take this simple message tonight lord lord as i've studied and prepared lord all we ask is that you would anoint the lord take away what doesn't need to be there add in what needs lord to meet the need of your bride and feeder tonight we pray lord touch each one we ask lord the many needs that have been brought forth lord we ask your grace to them and thank you for answering prayer lord for the many things that you've done in this last few days lord we pray you'll be with us now in jesus christ's name right amen amen thank you musicians that'll be it if you can turn your scriptures this morning to ephesians chapter four ephesians chapter four just uh by way of uh praise reports we prayed if you remember for brother tim pruitt's church in the hurricane ida that was hitting it ended up being i think the second or third worst uh hurricane to hit and it missed them completely he said they were going to get a bit of rain and 13 mile an hour winds the following day so we had worse weather than they did so we say praise the lord for that and uh brother brother jean has a church there as well and he said they have minimal damage and most of the folks in the church were okay a few lost power but other than that uh they were all good so we absolutely thank the lord for that that's an answer to prayer because they're saying a place that got hit directly there four to five weeks before they'll have power restored so amen we praise the lord for that i mean that's a real answer to prayer i also want to thank brother paul and sister kim he stepped out here but thank them for all the hard work and taking the children away for a few days everyone came back with all their fingers toes limbs had a good time by all accounts so certainly want to thank them for taking the time and effort to do that that's a big job it's a thankless job many times but we want to make sure we give them our thanks and appreciation for the hard work that they put in a minute it's wonderful to have people with a burden you don't have to tell them anything you just have to let them go amen and that's what they did they just took off and went and took the kids with them so amen and some good things certainly came out from it spiritually even in our own home so we're thankful for that as well this wasn't just a trip for fun it was for spiritual edification it was to help the children grow in the lord and that's absolutely what we can testify happened in our family amen so we praise the lord for that ephesians 4 a very familiar verse by this point ephesians 4 15 says but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplyeth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself and love amen may the lord have his blessing to the word you may be seated this morning as you can imagine we're going to continue on our series on the overcomers and we're going to speak on a title of gifts that keep on giving amen and this will be a multi-part series i think a partial series here certainly and if you think we've been stuck on this verse for a while we have this will be the third or fourth service i think that we've preached on this amen but there's a lot here to talk about amen this is not just a simple verse but there's so many things that tie into this idea of the body of christ and that's really the theme that we're going to be spending a little bit of time on in in the series on the overcomers is really that body of christ and we preached on how do you get into it and what does that look like and even the last service and many many services before we covered how do you get into it it's by one body by one spirit you're baptized into that body amen you can't be a part of the body of christ without the holy spirit you can be around it you can be in the anointing of the holy spirit in the services and around anointed people that but that's not what makes you a part of the body of christ amen you've got to have the anointing in you you've got a holy have the holy spirit god's own life god's own love inside of you and that's the thing that connects you to christ and that's the thing that allows him to now build you and set you into the body into your place amen and this is not a temporary thing we don't get to join the body and then leave on vacation for a little bit and then come back and join and back and forth this is a 24 hours a day seven days a week 365 days a year until the day that god takes us home by death or by rapture amen we don't get to take a break from being a believer we don't get to take a break from being a part of a body of believers amen but we're there to do a a purpose and he's got a plan for us and that's the thing that we're supposed to be focused on our entire time here even when we're on vacation and then even when we go out as brother joel said when we go out you know try and find people that you can encourage you know make sure that you're staying connected to the body try and take in a service if you're away in these different things and then we want to be surrendered and connected not only to him in terms of the spiritual side but also to each other and then we've got a duty a post of duty here as well amen and there's a process we know getting the holy ghost is a process it's repent and then be baptized and then after that you'll receive the holy ghost and it may be one minute from the minute you repent to the time that you're baptized and get the holy ghost and it could be 10 years for some people amen not everybody gets it immediately and you'll look in the scriptures you'll see that there were some that didn't even know there was a holy ghost they'd been baptized but they didn't even know there was a holy ghost to be had you know and i think it comes down to when we look in the scripture it says repent a lot of times we don't repent and then we we desire christ and we give our lives to christ but we don't repent and then when we get a true repentance now that gives us something to respond to if you're not baptized in the right name how can he come in you haven't done it the right way you've got to follow the word to get in there amen but then once you get the holy ghost then we start another process and that's the process of maturing and we covered that in depth with the last series i did amen but one thing we know is that when you get the holy ghost it will never disagree with the word of god amen when you are led by the holy spirit it will always align itself with the word of god if you say the holy spirit has called me to be a minister and you happen to be a sister then it wasn't the holy spirit that said that isn't that true amen if we look in ii timothy 2 it says let the women learn in silence with all subjection and i suffer not a woman to teach nor to usurp authority over the man but to be in silence amen and the feminists jump all over this and say well men can speak as well as women or women can speak as well as men and they're absolutely right this isn't about competence i mean this is about a divine order that god put in place because of the original sin and because of the fall in the garden of eden it was a reflection of what the orig the first woman did not a reflection of all women but yet there is a divine order for how this is going to happen so a sister that gets up and says well i'm going to teach i'm going to preach then she's going against the word amen so you can say all day long that i had a dream i had a vision i was anointed to do this and do that but if you're going against the we go to the word as an absolute to check our leadership amen we want to always be found doing that we talked in the last service how we have to get to christ first to get into that body we don't come in with a gift we don't come in with a talent we don't come in with something to offer but rather we come in and we surrender amen and in that surrender now he decides what he wants to use and what he wants to discard amen and sometimes we have to give up something of great value in order for us to use for him to use us in something of eternal value amen the world will look at something and say well you're a great leader you're a great speaker you make money well you know and they'll say and you come and say god i'm going to give you that. he says no no just come to me come to me and then i'll tell you what i want you to bring and what you want to give up amen it's for him to decide not for us and rather we come and surrender yielding ourselves to him and then he places us where he wants to be amen glory amen i read this quote last service and i believe it's worth repeating what brother brown said not working here brother rachel he says when you surrender fully he'll come in fully but until you surrender he can't come in fully surrender surrender your thoughts surrender your thinking surrender your life surrender your all right surrender your prestige surrender everything to him now and he'll come in and fill you with the holy ghost that's here that's what he's here to do amen now you look at that and you say well what if i surrender just a little well he'll come in just a little he'll come in as much as you'll allow him to amen but the problem with that is that when you have a gift and you allow him in just a little often what that means is the gift is anointed but your life isn't in line with the word and that can lead you into a very dangerous situation amen where you think that you're something that you're not because you have an anointed gift and the rest of your life is in shambles remember brother uh brother branham he saw those two brothers and one stood up and spoke in tongues and the other one interpreted they were both anointed they both had the holy spirit activating their gifts but what happened when he looked was by vision he saw that one of them was a true blue believer and the other one was cheating on his wife and he said how can this be and it's the fact that the holy spirit can anoint a gift without you having on the inside amen the gift doesn't prove anything amen but we also know for a part of the body of christ that each one of us has a gift and that means each one of us has a purpose we have a benefit that we bring to the local body and then just as our natural bodies have no extra parts so the body of christ doesn't have any extra parts no matter how small or little you might be god has a purpose and a plan for you being where you are and if we can surrender to him then we can be used in that manner amen the challenge for us is to do what is to sit still be quiet and wait on him amen the hardest thing for a human to do i think is to sit still to just wait and believe and trust that god is moving when nothing seems to be changing amen i can say that specifically in my life certainly in the recent past where it seemed like nothing was happening and nothing was happening but there was stuff happening internally and god was moving and making changes in certain things and all of a sudden god moves and now i'm here right and all of a sudden i've got purpose and i've got things to do and he's using me but for a long time there he wasn't using me and it's real easy to think well something's wrong no you've got to sit you've got to be quiet you got to learn you got to be trained you got to be humble you got to be broken down you got to let god open the door so that when you move you can move with confidence amen amen i mean paul says this in first corinthians 7 7 he says for i would that all men were even as i myself but every man every person this does this includes the sisters every man had his proper gift of god one after this manner and another after that so we're not all the same we're not all built the same we don't all have the same gift and even with the same gift it can operate differently depending on who you are right god works with you according to the way you are and it may be different for one that's singing this way versus one that sings that way look at the preaching gifts we have look at the variety of preachers we have my goodness and each one of them has a has a way of delivering in a way that the people can receive it and there's grace for them for the hearers that are there amen but so many different ones you know i remember looking back and if you were to ask me john did you ever think you would be a preacher i'd say no there was never really an inkling of it and the few little things that were there i didn't recognize as being something that was calling me to preach and it's only now looking back in hindsight that i can see ah there was something there i just didn't know what it was i remember talking to david butts one time my brother-in-law i said do you ever feel like you have something you're supposed to share with the church and i mean david's a a fine christian he's a deacon he's an upstanding husband a father he's a fantastic christian and he looked at me like i had 10 heads and said no right because why it's not that he never had something worth sharing but he never felt an unction to share it right to stand up in front of people to feel that he was supposed to bring that to the people but i did even back then occasionally and it was weird and i just thought well whatever that's weird obviously if he doesn't do it then why would you know it shouldn't mean anything to me amen but that was a foreshadow what of something that god was going to do later in my life there was a burden there that i couldn't respond to because the call hadn't been activated yet but i could see in in hindsight that burden was there to share that and it was god preparing me for ministry and then preparing me putting something putting a burden putting an unction on my heart now that doesn't mean a burden defines your calling amen there's lots of people get burdens for things and for different reasons but it can certainly show you what's coming your way and if you'll surrender god may turn that into a calling within your life amen amen but that burden is so great because when you have a burden you don't need anyone to tell you what to do like i said even talk about paul and kim and then they didn't need somebody to tell them to go out and take the young people out they did it on their own and we just get behind them and we support them and all of a sudden good things happen amen that's what we're looking for is those burdens those unctions of the holy spirit that are for the benefit of others and that's when you can trust that the holy spirit's working amen and they'll do it people with a burden they don't sit there and trumpet it that's what i found people with a real godly burden they don't sit there and tell everyone what they're gonna do and how they're going to do it or after they've done it they don't come back and tell us all what they did they just do it and oftentimes you don't find out till days or months or weeks later sometimes even years later and you'll find out wow you've been doing that for two years and we're seeing the fruit of it now and we have no clue how it got there because you were so quietly working brother jim dooley did that for two years he was working down in washington just going around talking to believers that had left church and disillusioned or disappointed or kicked out as a case where and and he go around he just fellowship with all him and eventually he got enough together to where we could have house meetings so i go down and and some of the other brothers and we preach to them and he's done the work for two years just to get us in the door right he didn't tell anybody about it except the pastor right but he didn't go around telling everybody hey you don't pray no no he just went out and did it and the lord blessed it and then and he's brought fruit out of it amen amen so we want to talk about gifts today we want to talk about what it is what its purpose is and what it's look what it looks like in action so the first thing that we ask ourselves is what is a gift most of us we look at a gift and we'd say well it's a talent or an ability that's what we think certainly from a worldly standpoint when you say somebody's gifted it means they're really good at doing something sidney crosby is gifted in hockey you know you can look at your athletes and these different ones great singers and you say well they have a gift to singer they have a gift for entertainment or comedy or sports or these different things but if we take it back to the scripture we'll see what a spiritual gift is because we're only interested in the spiritual gifts amen we're talking about a spiritual body we're talking about a spiritual heritage so spiritual gifts are the ones that we're going to be most interested in so first corinthians 12 if your turn here because we're going to stay here for a while today i have it up on the screen if you want but it'll help because i'm going to be going back and forth in different places so paul says in first corinthians 12 1 now concerning spiritual gifts brethren i would not have you ignorant amen he says spiritual gifts not gifts but spiritual gifts amen just because you have a gift it doesn't make it spiritual and he's going to show you the criteria for it to be a spiritual gift in the in the following verses he says you know that you were gentiles carried away unto these dumb idols even as ye were led in other words your past is nothing to brag about right nothing special looking back in the past you're not some amazing person but rather you were leading down the path of death right serving what idols you weren't serving the true god you had no idea of god you had no no concept of what it meant to serve god until he brought you out of that he says wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of god call it jesus accursed and that no man can say that jesus is the lord but by the holy ghost we covered this before the proof of the holy ghost is that you can what say that jesus is right that he is he is the present day man he's not just in the past he's not just in the future but he is the present christ amen amen so the word you're listening to is is what's going to determine whether you recognize christ because he is the word before he ever was jesus christ he was christ the word amen before the foundation of the world before time even began that's where the word was and so we're looking not for christ as we saw him 2000 years ago but we're looking for the word amen for our age and for our day and when you recognize that then you know you're on the right track amen it's not some man it's not some headquarters or some overseer that we're looking to but we're looking to the word which is christ for our day then paul gets into these spiritual gifts he says now there are diversities of gifts there's different gifts but the same spirit so the criteria for a spiritual gift is that there's a spirit operating it yes amen so when you have a gift it is something that can be anointed by the holy spirit and used by god so that opens us up to a whole lot of things besides just the nine things that are listed in the rest of this of this chapter doesn't it because anything that you have that can be anointed by the holy spirit and used by god is a spiritual gift amen so that can literally be the two hands that you have to do just about anything for the service of god it can be your mouth speaking what he would have you to speak amen going this place fellowshipping with that one it can be taking a meal to someone it is anything that god can anoint you to use for his purpose is a spiritual gift that paul says amen amen but it's only spiritual if it's the holy spirit that's anointing it and guess what you can have a spiritual gift that you use every day and it's not spiritual and then the holy spirit anoints it and it becomes spiritual for that moment and then it goes back to something else you can have brother bam talks about men that have a gift to make money guess what it can be anointed for the for the use of the kingdom of god and then he can go right back to making money and it has nothing to do with god but then god will put something on his heart and he'll go out and he'll make money and he'll give it to the church and say that one was from god and then he'll go back and keep making money and back and forth back and forth amen it's not that it can't be used for your benefit but when it's a spiritual gift when it's being used spiritually it is for the benefit of the body of christ and it's used for the benefit of others amen brother braham says this he's speaking of himself he says what is it it's a gift that i have that god gave me not that somebody laid hands on me that doesn't work gifts and callings are without repentance you're born with them in all your life this is what we call a creation gift the bible said so see moses was born a prophet john the baptist 712 years before he was born was a voice of one crying in the wilderness god told jeremiah before you was even conceived in your mother's womb i knew you i sanctified you and ordained you a prophet to the nations so the fivefold ministry is a gift that's ordained before the foundation of the world and then you don't choose it it's in you beforehand god god foreordained it he predestinated it and you can't do anything to take it away and you definitely can't add it into your life he says see it's god's election and calling not that you're any better than anybody else he says we're all the same we're just children but god has chose some to be one thing and some another he says and if you pick where god chose you then you can yield yourself and that spirit will work through your through you so what he's meaning there is that if you pick by your free will now your free will is to surrender that's what this looks like it is not like i choose to be a preacher it's lord i surrender to your will he quickens to your heart what you're supposed to be and then you say i will be it that's what brother brahm saying here if you choose by your free will to be what god wants you to be then you can yield yourself because god's already prepared you he's given you a gift he's given you a nature he's given you a makeup to yield in a way that will allow that gift to operate and brother branham remember when he talks about his gift he says i i work i i live a lot closer to the supernatural dimension he says i can slip in and out of it very easily and that was the gift that was required for him to operate under the anointing that he was under and he says my gift was what to yield myself right to surrender myself so he had a great ability to yield and to slip into the supernatural to slip into the spiritual and god made him that way and once he accepted that you saw his ministry start to take off as long as he was questioning it as long as he was fighting it he didn't get very far with it it was still wonderful but as soon as he recognized his place in the word as soon as he recognized the call then all of a sudden he starts to surrender to it and all of a sudden god can do things in him that he couldn't do earlier on in his ministry why he chooses now to embrace what god has called him to do and now he can yield the way god wants him to and the holy spirit can flow through him in a supernatural way that it couldn't before amen so a gift is something that the holy spirit can operate what it is not is a vindication that you are a child of god because so often what we find is people are saying i want a gift i want a ministry i want a place in the body so i can prove to myself that i am a son or a daughter of god amen what happens usually is that they don't think they have the holy ghost and so they say well if i can have a gift then that'll make me feel like i'm important it'll make me feel like i'm a part and that'll confirm to me that the holy spirit is in my life but that has nothing to do with it we covered that before whether you look at judas whether you look at balaam whether you look at the different ones that paul talks about he says they left having loved this present world and this and that and the other thing what was it they had gifts they had ministries but yet they didn't truly have the holy spirit inside of them and so what we do is often it's really an inferiority complex right is it satan that has put doubt in our mind as to our position in christ and so we say well if i have a gift it's going to make me feel like i'm a i'm an important part and that's the last thing you need to seek gifts for him and a gift is for the benefit of others not for the benefit of yourself amen so when you start doing that now you're going to get yourself in a real tangle real quick because guess what satan will anoint you in lots of ways and then he'll mimic all of those gifts and we'll touch on that a little bit what brother branham says about it but he'll mimic those things and pretty soon you think you're pretty spiritual and you'll end up falling off of a cliff and failing badly amen amen if you aren't carl to be a preacher i don't care how much you surrender to the holy spirit you will never be an ordained minister by ordained i mean by god amen you can't do it you can't do it if you think that you're going to be the world's best singer and you say i'm anointed to be a singer and god hasn't called you to be a singer it doesn't matter if you can sing like the the greatest singer in the history of the world god won't anoint it amen you've got to find your place and if you don't do that you can't be blessed i mean you can't be a blessing is more to the point right we want to find a place where we can be a blessing to others amen now that word gift that that is used here is is charisma and brother mark shared some things from brother jason watkins with you know i'm going to borrow from them for the next little bit here but that word gift is charisma in the greek so he gave charisma to different people now in in the english language charisma means compelling attractiveness or charm that can inspire devotions in others devotion and others not devotions that's for sure and then so you see actors and actresses that have great charisma comedians you see politicians and what is it it's people that draw others to them very easily they have a great personality they usually have a good smile they're great speakers they're very personable they remember things about you they flatter you easily right and what do they do they draw people to themselves and that's what charisma does when we speak of it from an english standpoint but most of those people today are demonic and the re the way you know that is you look at where they lead people and it is rarely to christ and it's usually to themselves and to do what they want them to do which makes it what demonic amen because we always lead to christ if you're under uh the holy spirit anointing then you're going to lead them to christ and you're going to point to christ every single time but charisma in the greek has a completely different meaning it is a free gift a favor which one receives without any merit of his own that's grace that's that's the definition of grace so charisma is literally a gracious gift it is a gift given without any merit on the part of the person that has it the gift of divine grace the gift of faith knowledge holiness and virtue grace or gifts denoting extraordinary powers distinguishing certain christians and enabling them to serve the church of christ not serve themselves but serve the church of christ the reception of which so the gifts are given due to the power of divine grace operating on their souls by the holy spirit so there's nothing of their their worth here there's nothing that they've done to deserve this and there's nothing that they can do to operate it in a spiritual way but it is all grace that it is given given to them it is grace that they can be used and it is grace that it can be received from start to finish amen amen so the gifts are grace to us and it's only the holy spirit working them that makes them worthwhile to us in terms of spiritual worth amen but catch that definition it says extraordinary powers given freely to us not based on our worthiness but rather ordained by god to serve the church of christ so when you see somebody take a gift and they leverage it to fame fortune popularity and these different things then you don't even need discernment to say that's not christ because when you see the greatest elements of these gifts in scripture how many of those turned out to be popular moses the greatest prophet aside from john the baptist right wasn't particularly popular was he they killed jesus they killed paul they killed all of the apostles that had the greatest power and authority in the early church right none of these men came to great popularity none of them came to a great end most of them died right so if you see somebody and they're coming into all of those things then i can guarantee you it's not the holy spirit that's leading them because the world will never accept it because the world never has accepted it so all that's left is is the true church and guess what the true church is not that big it's never been big it'll never be big and so the acceptance is going to be a very small group of people and the rest are going to deny it because it's too strict it doesn't line up with their way of thinking it doesn't give them an excuse and it doesn't allow them out from under the thumb of the word of god amen amen it will never be accepted in a way that makes people popular amen that's why this prosperity gospel and these different things word of faith and all that all it is is what a gross distortion of the scripture and men trying to draw people to themselves and they turn themselves into multi multi multi-millionaires what's the what's the the big one uh ken kenneth copeland uh 250 300 million dollar net worth now i think third of a billion dollars preaching the gospel amen right and jesus had one cloak right it's a problem there amen because why in our opening scripture we read this it said ephesians 4 16 it says the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself and love it's edifying everyone else around you it's not focused on producing something for yourself amen so if all of us benefit it's god and if only i benefit and i'm the one with the gift it's antichrist that's simple you don't need discernment you don't need discernment for that you just say who's benefiting from their gift is it them or is it everybody else and if it's everybody else you're good to go and if it's just them then you say there's a problem here doesn't mean it couldn't be a real gift but it means that right now it's operating under something else amen brother adam couldn't use his gift to heal himself how long did he go on with with stomach problems right and and he could he could heal anybody else if the lord showed him to do it but he could never take his hand and lay it on himself and say get out yeah why jesus never healed himself jesus laid down in the boat he had headaches he was he was in agony he was tired and all these things and he could not take that power and use it on himself because why a true gift is given for the benefit of others and even you look at jesus he would become exhausted we saw it in brother bannon's ministry the same thing he would become exhausted by the use of the gift and then that gift was not able to restore him and then he would they said jesus you're not a man over 50 years old and he was only 33 when he died right he aged so heavily because of the use of that gift because of the pressure the burden that was on him and the strength that people drew out of him amen so what a gift is for others and it is a gift for service not for selfishness first corinthians 14 12 says even so ye for as much as you are zealous of spiritual gifts we want gifts in the body amen do we want christ moving in our midst do we want the holy spirit moving paul says seek that ye may excel seek that you may do really really well that you would be above and beyond what's normal but to what purpose he says to the edifying of the church right so we say lord i want a great ministry i want to be a great minister i want to be a great minister i want to be a great singer i want to be a great musician i want to be a great song leader right and god says why right and then he gives us the truth pill so we can't lie and what do we say so that i can be identified with a group of other great ministers so that when i walk into the service then they announce my name over the pulpit so that i'm the one that's always asked to go up and sing the specials so that everybody knows who i am so that when they're in their little humble church and they're sick and tired of what they've got they'll stream me what is it it has nothing to do with the benefit of the body oft times if we were honest with ourselves there's a lot of selfishness that's built into those sorts of things we want to be careful that our we're looking for the benefit of others and not for the growth of ourselves that sounds silly those things i just said and i made them extreme for you know to make an extreme point and that's that sometimes if you take what you really want and take it all the way that's where you'd end up i want to be popular i want to be known right i want to be recognized that has nothing to do with it that has nothing to do with it i'm going to pick on sister maureen when she went to louisiana and brother phillip saw her come up on the platform and he said what's that old lady doing up there right why because he's used to someone younger coming up lots of power you know humble but usually a little younger you know maybe going to really bellow it out and he played her song for the next month after he got off after she got down from there why because he was expecting something different than what came up amen the holy spirit is humble and then it walks up and it's clothed in a way that we don't often expect but then when that spread in that presence comes down and anoints that gift look out and guess what if you got the holy ghost you'll catch that and you'll say that sure looks simple it sure looks simple there today but that touched me no way i haven't been touched in a long time with all the power with all the yelling all the shouting all the dancing all the great things that came our way and yet that little one came by and touched me in a way that i haven't been touched in a long time and you recognize that's the holy spirit that was moving and maybe some of the other stuff you've been dwelling on hasn't been quite so anointed as you thought amen i know sister maureen doesn't like to be lifted up like that but it was to make a point that our expectation should be that god will use whoever he wants to use amen and that if they're led to be up there then it's going to be a blessing to every one of us whether it's preaching whether it's singing whether it's going to help somebody move whether it's bringing a meal whether it's bringing blueberries over whatever it might be when god leads you to do it trust that it is a blessing and trust that he's leading you to do something for the benefit of somebody else amen amen but we watch out those people they get a little bit of success and that'll take their brain a lot of places if they don't have the character to match what god's putting their life in man so you'll find that if it's a godly gift as they grow their character grows with it to keep them lockstep so that they don't get a swelled head that's why you can't have a pastor that is a young man because the scripture says lest he get what caught up in himself right and he thinks he thinks of himself more than he ought to right it'll take him down and he'll take the whole church with them and you'll make a big mess out of it brother brown says this he says but see there's no bird can follow an eagle oh you say well hawkeye that hawk tried to follow an eagle he'd disintegrate in the air he couldn't follow that eagle if he had to see because that eagle can go so far that the hawk can't even get to it and before he can go there he has to be built so he can stand it but the higher you go the further away you can see like the astronauts and so forth now see the higher you go the further you can see if you're equipped to see now what good would it do the eagle to go way up there if he couldn't see after he got up there what's he saying you're looking for something you're looking for an expansion of your gift and you're not even equipped to use it if he was to if he was to give you what you're asking him for he's saying don't go any further than the gift will take you don't get ahead of it don't presume but rather wait till god equips you and then you've got some place that you can go with confidence he says i think that's the way really struggling here today brother weisha so i think that's the way many of us trying today to lift up into something when we're not first equipped oh god give me the gift of this and do this and that there you don't get it why you're not equipped for it you wouldn't do no good after you got up there and when you do and if you did try to lift yourself up you'd only bring what i call today what's hurt our church more than anything else a kernel comparison what is it you're making up something to replace the original that's supposed to be in your life amen you get there and realize you don't have what you thought you had and so you put something on to try and convince everybody else that you still have it and then we talked about those men that try and lead you down this place of you need to see visions and dreams and you've got to do this and you've got to have a supernatural angel and blah blah blah blah blah like they do and they're doing it just to try and get you to feel below them and to pay attention to them and they don't have a supernatural experience at all and then you watch people respond to a to a god anointed gift sometime and go give feedback to that person and now watch how that person responds when they say that was for me that was the holy spirit does that person get puffed up does that person start strutting around this is the real key how do they look at other people that have a gift like them do they start looking down you know there's a singer a great singer then the holy they sing and the holy spirit drops in the room you go say brother sister that was amazing that was so timely do they now go and when the next person gets up do they just kind of sit back and cross their arms do they look down their nose at that person because they may not have the same level of gift or do they enter in do they support do they put their shoulder to the wheel do they encourage those people do they use what they what that person's giving to the full effect right because we're going to have variations of gifts in this body whether it's singing whether it's preaching whether it's the different helps in the church deacons whatever it might be you're going to have variances and you've got to be able to handle those differences without getting snooty about it amen you take a great service with a minister and i've been in some tremendous services with some tremendous miracles in them and you go talk to that minister and you tell them and they talk about what happened and do they get arrogant do they start talking about themselves or do they keep pointing back to christ back to christ back to christ because that's what brother branham did right he said i can't do a thing and if i could i would but i can't and if those men start pointing to themselves and if they start putting down those that don't do the things they do you got a problem because it's an arrogant spirit and it's drawing to yourself amen remember moses went out he was kept out of the out of the land of kane and why because he put himself in the place of god when god didn't tell him to do it he said must die must i give you water and that's not what god told him to do right and god and brother brahm says i just heard it today he says he presumed and he put himself he took he took the credit to himself and he says that's what kept him out of the land of canaan one of the greatest prophets ever looking back that's the only one that the the the the the priests the the jewish priests look to moses he was the great prophet right there was a prophet like unto him that's who jesus is compared to that's how great he was and yet when he lifted himself up what happened god said you can't go into the promised land for that one time all the great things he did standing in the gap surrendered himself humbled himself gave himself up sacrificed himself for the children of israel and god kept him out because he put himself in the place of god and took credit for something that wasn't his amen i was listening to to how can i overcome today i've been listening to it for a while and i heard this next one and i i felt i had to put it in and he's talking about satan's temptation of jesus and he says no now we're fighting each other so he's talking about the the first uh way that satan attacked and the second one he said was that he made upon him that he would be a show-off and how that he how that does hit god's servants to be a show-off to show what you can do glory to god hallelujah i'm a deliverer i'm so he says see see come up here on top of the mountain and set down here he tempted him to do it now remember he was tempted to do it hard now if you want to be something before the people stand up here on this temple and jump off see i'll give you a scripture for it because it's written he'd give the angels charge over thee lest at any time dash a foot against the stone he barely up to make him a show-off to show his authority and he says no true servant of god ever does that you see a man showing off his chest out and all like that just remember there is something wrong there remember we talked about that arrogant spirit right anything that happens behind this pulpit that is supernatural is only by his grace and it has nothing to do with the man behind the pulpit ever ever ever it is god from start to finish no god don't want that jesus set the example he could have done it he certainly could have done it but he didn't do it no servant of god is a show-off of himself to try to take god's power and show himself above somebody else what is it you're there to do what edify the body and that's your constant thing howard how do i edify the body how do i build somebody up how do i encourage somebody how do i correct somebody with love today lord how do i add to the body rather than take away what can i do to benefit your body today now lord what can they do for me what can i do for them who was it that said i don't know if it was jfk that's not what you can do that's not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country that's how gifts operate that's not what the body can do for you ask what you can do for the body amen amen if you see a need ask god say lord use me listen when we're asking for revival we don't say lord send a revival on brother paul what do we say lord send a revival of me let it happen in me so you see a need you see a situation you go to praying and say lord help that person if you can use me to do it then do it but that don't but don't presume then that he's going to do it let him use whoever he's going to do it through and you can sit back and wait as well amen but if he moves on you to do it then move amen look to be an answer look to be a solution look to be a help look to be an encouragement in these things and we don't want to just sit back and pray all the time either sometimes that's we we we we're so spiritual that all we do is pray and we never move our feet our hands can i say that and then sometimes we sit there and we're in our prayer closet and we're being all so spiritual my wife and i were talking about a situation a while back and i said let's not just pray about it but let's look for a way to enter into this situation and then let's not just be somebody that's talking to god about it but let's be quick to act if he puts something let's look for ways that we can support people and encourage people along their path amen and if god wants to you to help he'll anoint your gift he'll put a burden there he'll put an unction there and we don't move until that action comes amen we're able to sit and wait romans 8 13 says for if you live after the flesh ye shall die we're talking about gifts now if you do it your way it brings death brings death to you and it brings debt to the one that you're trying to work on he says but if you through the spirit to mortify the deeds of the body you shall live so when the holy spirit's working in you that's when life is generated and if it's you that's working in you that's when death is generated and then that way the it says it talks about the way that a man thinks and it is what death he thinks it's life but it's death every single time but he says now if you mortify the deeds of the body if you get yourself out of the way and you let the spirit roll through you you shall live life flows out of you you'll be a living fountain amen that's what we're looking to do be a living fountain that we can benefit somebody else amen so again we're looking for the holy spirit to flip the switch if i can put it that way if i flip the switch bad things happen if god flips the switch supernatural things happen above and beyond what we could ever ask or think amen i'd much rather that amen than if i flip the switch and try and make a mess of things because that's what's absolutely going to happen amen let's go back to first corinthians 12 here verse 5. so we talked about gifts and it says and there are differences of administrations but the same lord now the first thing said that gifts it says it was we have diversities of gifts but the same spirit but now it says now we have administrations but the same lord so we've got a we've got a changing now of the order of this now this administration's means ministries and that's talking about the fivefold ministry apostles prophets evangelist pastors and teachers but it's also talking about the office of deacons and those that do charitable work in the church including the distribution of money goods food and taking care of the sick so this is people that have an active daily ministry if i could put it that way this is not people that have a an occasional thing but these are people that are constantly in a ministry of sorts if i could put it that way and paul says that these are under the same lord gifts are under the same spirit but he says these ministries these administrations are under the same lord what's the difference holy spirit's an anointing but lord is a whole different animal isn't it when we start talking about lord it means master the possessor and disposer of things the owner the one who has control of the person or the sovereign so again an anointing on a gift can come and go if we were to talk about a singing gift you're not sitting all day long singing under the anointing are you but you're sitting there and you're reading your book and then all of a sudden you jump up and next thing you're at the piano or you're at your guitar or whatever it is and you're playing a song and practicing it because the holy spirit has anointed you to sing it and then you'll go to church and you'll sing it and then you'll go back to reading your book right so it's an anointing that comes flips a switch and then steps back and now you can go back to regular life but when we start talking about ministries now this is a continuous thing where you don't get to back away like that this is something where you have to be open to the moving of the holy spirit on a regular basis now as believers we should be open to that anyways but your ministry your portion in the body now is much tighter because you have to be constantly under that leadership because if you don't people get hurt right when you talk about five full ministry if we presume if we get under a man anointing if we start doing things the way we want to do it then everything's gonna fall apart we'll get into a denomination is what we'll do right so you have to be under that anointing you have to you have to be seeing him now as lord over your life in a way that it isn't required if you're going to be a singer or or these different things it's a different type of ministry if i can put it that way amen so the the element here is of continuous direction and leadership because now that gift has to be subject to lordship all the time you have to be always moving as god wants you to move and it's always happening in your life brother jail doesn't get to leave the church and then turn off his pastorship he goes home and he's still a pastor whether we need him at two o'clock in the morning or whether we need him at seven a.m the next day or whether we need him in the afternoon he's going to be studying he's going to be praying he's going to be open to the needs of the body and if there's issues going on then guess what he doesn't go to work he's in there and he's praying isn't he and he's studying he's looking for answers in the word and he's seeking god's purpose and leadership in these different things right so he doesn't get to turn it off deacons they get pulled into situations and guess what they don't get to turn it off they've always got to be ready that's why there's a spiritual requirement for a deacon they have to have the holy ghost in their life because they're going to get into situations where if men get involved and try and do things their way we're going to make a mess of it but they have to be led in the same way that the five full ministry is and then now we come down and you say well what about the people helping those charitable work going to the to be with the sick and that again you've got to be led you can go into a hospital room and leave that person worse than when you came in if you say the wrong things sometimes you've got to be a little harder than you would imagine right sometimes god's put them on their back and you got to let them know other times you're there purely as an encouragement and to keep them from getting what depressed down in the dumps worried are they going to die what sometimes it's just to go home and take care of the cat or the dog whatever it is you've got to be led on how you go and what you say and who you go with all these things you're ministering to people on a regular basis and not just over a pulpit or through that but now you're coming into their very lives you're getting real personal in these things and that's where you don't want man's finger going around and stirring up the spaghetti amen we want the holy spirit to be there and lead us and guide us so that we're not talking out of order so that we're not moving out of order and god can do what he wants in those different lives amen the most common greek word for minister is diaconos and it means a servant or one who executes a command of another and that's the root word that we're going back to when it comes to this these administrations is that we talk about ministers we talk about servants so a minister is one that gives not gets right a servant does not go around and do everything that the master says and then expect big accolades and rewards and clothes and nice cars and no a servant's duty is to do what what the master says when the master says it how the master says it and then in return he just gets taken care of he gets a a roof over his head he gets close on his back and he gets three square meals a day that's what a servant does they give and they give and they give and they get no more than anybody else in life even though they work harder than most why they're under a lord they're under a master and their constant duty is serve serve serve so if you want to get into this type of ministry get ready to serve because they're going to take way more than you're going to get right the pastor still gets to feed off the flock doesn't he we still pay him our ties we still support him in these different ways but i guarantee you brother gerald has given way more than he's gotten from us if i could put it that way why a minister serves they serve they serve they serve every day amen amen so their gift here is not so much that they're an amazing speaker an amazing helper but the gift is that they can be led on a continuous basis by the holy spirit they can be led by the holy spirit in ways that most people can't and that that means that requires a sanctified life and it requires focus of purpose you've got to remember we talked about for the working of the ministry that's what they were given for the working of the ministry a minister is there for the ministering purpose alone that his that that's his primary focus in life is to minister to the body of christ amen amen amen equally important so it says that they can be led by god on a consistent basis but until they're led they won't move these are men and women that can sit still until they are firmly led by the holy spirit and even they can look at a situation they can see chaos they can see pain they can see suffering and yet they won't move until god tells them to move when you think about a chicken you get a chicken that's been born and it's sitting there in that egg and it's pipping its way out and it's got the little hook on the top of the beak to knock its way out remember what do they say if you see a chicken trying to break out do you help it no why because the strength that it is building up is what allows it to survive the first few hours after it breaks out of that egg so if you help that chicken break out of the egg then it's going to die immediately and sometimes what it is is we look at situations as ministers or people that are in these ministries and you want to help and you want to help and you want to help and the holy spirit has put a wall there and says do not touch this leave it alone i'm working here they have to develop strength they have to be able to stand on their own two feet they've got to have their own personal walk they've got to get their own leadership and until they do they're not going to be of any use so don't go in and touch this one i've got to work with them one-on-one and god's got to come into a life and he's got to work with a father he's got to work with a husband he's got to work out these situations himself and you can't get in there and try and fix it because there's no fixing it god's got to bring that person back to the word themselves amen of times usually the way that is is you've helped and helped and helped and nothing's happened and then god says step away i've got to do this one on one now and it's usually not very pretty you've got to be able to step back even when you see things going going south when you see things going bad and say i don't move until i'm told to move amen continuing on here verse 6. it says there are diversities of operations but it is the same god which worketh all in all so again we have another you know the first one it was by by the holy spirit the second one is by lord but now with operations it comes to god now we don't believe in a trinity and this is not a trinity but there are attributes and descriptions of god and they matter paul didn't put three different words here just to have fun or because he had a really good uh you know dictionary in his head right he put this here by the holy spirit there's a reason why he says spirit and then he says lord and then he says god now the thing with operations is that he's saying here that's the same god that works in each one and achieves what is achieved it's god that's doing it men are doing it women are doing it but it is god that actually does the work amen so we have operations in there in a different category and it's only used twice in scripture and both of these verses are are in first corinthians 12 the second one is listed there it says to another the working of miracles the operation of miracles and then so an operation here is a thing wrought a working or an effect now you think of something rot like wrought iron it's usually metal work and then so you take something that is not a finished material and you turn it into something that is a finished good you take a raw material and you turn it into something that is eminently useful that word rot means worked into shape by artistry or effort elaborately embellished or processed for use beaten into shape or deeply stirred so we're talking about rot things that are rot so you may be heard of a wrought iron fence i guarantee you when they took that that rod that iron rod and they forged it in their in their manufacturing facilities it didn't look like this but now that takes a craftsman that takes a welder that takes somebody that knows how to rot iron and they'll take that and they'll build that right on site there's a brother down ex-brother i guess at this point down in louisiana that does this sort of thing and he'll take it and he's a welder by trade and he'll take all those pieces of metal and it's just flat bar and tubes or or whatever it might be bars and he'll turn it into these fancy gates like this it costs thousands and thousands of dollars because it requires incredible precision and incredible workmanship and repeatability it takes a lot of work this is artistry here nobody you don't just walk up and do this one day it takes a lot of training you've got to really know what you're doing with your materials with your heat and these different things amen so we blend all that together and we see that enough that operations are things that are worked into shape by artistry or effort so that scripture said to another what the the working of miracles and before that said the diversities of operations it's a it's the same god working so it's god that's doing the working here it's god that's doing the embellishing it's god that's doing the artistry we're talking about putting the finishing touches on something taking it from a raw state into a beautifully finished state turning what looks like just a bunch of raw steel into something that looks like this that takes an artist that takes an author that takes a creator if we can put it that way and that's why he talks about god here is because he's what the author and the creator of the body of christ amen he's the one that's going to bring us to that finished state amen these are things that are ordained to be what we're looking at here is what the image that was in his mind before the world began and he says there are people that are here to do that to bring you into that image that he had of you before the world began but the one that's doing it in them now is god and he is the author and he's the finisher and he's the cre he's the great creator of all these things and then he's the alpha and omega if i could put it that way and he's the one that's working through these different gifts to bring out the beautiful product that we see at the end amen so now we've got a different group of gifts and this is a very special group and he jumps down and we'll get into it in a little bit but just to hammer this down in the scripture ecclesiastes 3 11 says he hath made everything beautiful in his tongue amen we don't get to choose it and again these men these people that are in these ministries they can't choose to do these things but these are supernatural events usually that cause a great change from something that's very common into something that is amazing and beautiful amen and you'll see that with people that that get saved they get delivered in these different things and in a split second something happens in their life and it's a supernatural effect and it's through men and women with great gifts that these things tend to happen amen so he had made everything beautiful in his time also he has set the world in their hearts so that no man can find out the work that god maketh from the beginning to end i put the amplified there because it explains this a little more easily it says he has made everything beautiful in his time he has also planted eternity in men's hearts that's the seed word of god amen he's planted it in their hearts and minds it says a divinely implanted sense of a purpose working through the age which nothing under the sun but god alone can satisfy and that's what happens is when that light crosses your path and it quickens that seed inside of you you knew there is something something jumps out and you're like why am i thinking these thoughts why am i desiring these things why am i going in this direction towards god when i've never even thought about it before and he says it's something that was planted in there and you'll never understand it and you never could understand it but it's there and it's god that did it and then it's god that's going to bring out the very thing that he placed inside of you into that finished thing we talked about it's the original seed that we talked about so long ago amen he says what it's done in a way so that men cannot find out what god has done from the beginning to end and then his ways are higher than our ways we're never going to figure this out intellectually we're never going to understand it all intellectually we're never going to be able to figure it out by by education or theology and these different things amen but it is something that he alone can work and he understands what it's supposed to look like and now he can move in men and women and help bring this out and all they see is a portion of it each one of them only sees a portion but if they can be anointed for to do that little portion god will use them and then it'll go to the next one the next one the next one until we all end up what in the unity that we talked about we're all in a rapture we're a perfect spotless bride and everybody's had a little bit of a part to play in it but it was god through the whole thing amen the author and the finisher of our faith amen so we when we get into people that are working in the operation side it's kind of like a surgeon that's doing reconstructive work right if you really all of us are like we're in a hospital and we're all broken up we're in a bad accident and god's trying to put us back together he's trying to put us back into our original condition and nobody knows what we're supposed to look like because we're all broken so what he does is he he comes in as what a great surgeon he restores our body to the way it was supposed to look before we were ever in the accident but we don't know because we're all broken up so he's turning us into what we were and all we've ever seen is broken and he's turning us into beautiful amen and so he's got people that do that so now you're in these operations now as i mentioned there you get into miracles of healing what's a miracle of healing it's restoring you back to the health that you were supposed to have from the very beginning you'll get miracles of deliverance what is it restoring your mind or your nature or your body to its intended place taking away things like addictions and bad habits and those sorts of things you'll get into what the miracles of safe keeping paul on the remember when he he was shipwrecked and he goes in and he works a miracle when he puts his hand in the wood and he gets bitten that's a miracle that he worked there and it was for his safe keeping it but it was also a proof to them that a man of god walked amongst them you have miracles of childbirth right elisha and the shunammite woman what is it he speaks to her what she desired and she says you know don't tease me you know i i don't want to be disappointed death to that to death he says no no no let's say it the lord you're going to have a child and she gets the child and then she goes back to that man when she loses the child he restores him back yet again and then what is it it is operations it is doing supernatural things for people that they can't do themselves that's what operations are now that is not always a gift as in it doesn't have to be working all the time but it can be the lord dropping something in on your heart and we get into a thus say at the lord moment in our in our lives where we speak the word and what happens is exactly what we said what is it that's a gift of operations that's god moving in you supernaturally to do something for your for somebody else that they can't do for themselves that's a gift of operations amen [Applause] amen so we have the holy spirit controlling gifts then in administrations you've got to recognize him as full lord and now then we get into operations that is god is the author and finisher of our lives amen it's all one and the same god like i said it's not a trinity but you look at the timing and the impact of each attribute or expression of god and those gifts and you can see how they differ switching on and off in some cases always on and then you have people that literally just supernaturally they'll drop into your life and do something then they walk away and you may never see them again what is it they're going around just doing supernatural things in people's lives that's not that's our ministry it's just and sometimes it's only once you can look in the scripture and see people that did great things only once but they were anointed to do it amen shamgar what he did that was an operation right he destroyed an enemy by himself that they couldn't destroy with all of their men before that what is it the holy spirit dropping down on him and anointing him for victory amen and it's the same thing amen all of these people in these roles have to be under a supernatural influence and it's always through yielding to the holy spirit it is not something that they operate in and of themselves james 1 17 says every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the father of lights with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning what that means is that if he did it one time you'll always do it the same way and then brother branham focused on that time and time again of his ministry if you can point to the word where god did something one way one time you can go back on the same ground and do get the exact same results amen those gifts will operate in the same way jesus christ the same yesterday today forever it wasn't only for the apostles it wasn't only for a book of acts church amen but it was for every son and daughter of god that can believe the word amen amen the thing that we see here is that their gift is always in how they yield and the and how much they can yield and how often they can yield it's difficult to do that on a regular basis you'll see it in jesus life i don't have to look to myself or any other minister just look to jesus how weak and weary he got under the operation of his gift brother branham we saw that thing in a modern day right it absolutely destroyed their body but they were able to yield in a way and it destroyed their body but they were able to help so many people because they had such an ability to get themselves out of the way and let god move through them so when you start with the the original gifts that's actually the lowest level of yielding it's a temporary yielding it's a it's an occasional thing then you get into the administrations and that's a constant one but it's not as deep and then you get into operations and that's a heavy impact that's really the supernatural coming through a person and that's again occasional but it's a very significant moment i remember when when blanca and selena in in dallas and we had brother joe adams come from louisiana and he prayed for blanca she didn't ask he found out she had gallbladder attacks and he called her up in the service he prayed for her and he cast it out and she's been the be she's been fine ever since you don't get healed from gold attack gallbladder attacks doesn't happen once they once they start you can't get away from it and he laid hands on her she said i didn't have faith for nothing i wouldn't go up expecting anything i didn't have some great anything she just said i went up bowed my head he prayed and it was gone that's an operation that's a gift of supernatural capacity where a man says this isn't supposed to be he gets anointed to do it he calls that person up out of the congregation and he cast that thing right out of her that place and at the same time he prayed for selena and she had lactose intolerance and she's never had it you can't keep her off the milk now right we went out and had we left that service and we went and had ice cream immediately after that and that would normally have given selena that she would have been up all night screaming because of gas and blanco had a gallbladder attack and we went out and had big ice cream after that service amen that's an operation amen but that's just one thing and guess what joe's preached many wonderful services but he's never done that again in our life and there's been opportunities to do but he never has but just at that one time that was him yielding following the leadership of the holy spirit and that's what happened amen an operation a supernatural event where somebody's anointed to speak a word to give to to do something and step out in faith and god meets them there and does something tremendous in the body of christ amen philippians 4 13 says i can do all things through christ which strengthens me and then our only limit is how much of christ will allow in and he matches that gift to how much you'll allow in you want a great gift great yielding great surrender is what's going to be the requirement amen you got to get a whole lot of yourself out in order to allow him to work amen so how much of christ will you allow in your life look at the the parable of the sower amen you had some that produced 30 fold you had some that produced 60 fold and some that produced a hundredfold what was the difference i'd like to know i'd like to do the hundredfold thing if i could amen brother branham takes us back to the scripture to answer this he takes us to psalm 1. he says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night amen you bring forth the lot of god when you don't take advice from people that aren't a part of the body of christ when you don't even associate much less do the lifestyle of a sinner when you're not a critic and when your great pleasure and enjoyment is the word of god you want to produce 100 fold brother brown takes us back here and says this is the way to do it then he continues in verse three and he says this is the end result and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit that's your fruit that's your gift it's what you bring to christ we all have a crown delay at his feet and the jewels in it are the work that you do on here that are that's of eternal value that's the souls you bring with you right so you have fruit in his season you have a season you have a time and not all of us are in the same time and season but we know before we get out of here we'll all have fruit amen we'll have all brought forth something of eternal value his leaf shall not wither that's your way of supernatural living i mean that's the way you absorb the word that's the way you absorb eternal life he says that doesn't go away when you're planted here this way you'll never lose that ability to have super supernatural life coming out of you the life of god's going to be in you for the rest of your time amen and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper everything you do is going to prosper in the eyes of god amen brother brown says this right after he's read this he says rivers what is that he says the nine spiritual gifts rivers of one water one spirit one water but coming from nine different resources rivers of water see he's saying what you need to have nine those nine spiritual gifts in the body because they're there to benefit it's going to help you grow he says it the tree wasn't set out he shall be like a tree that set out transposed from this to that he was planted what's that predestinated the thought of god before the foundation of the world placed him there see not stuck out not by chant chants but was planted or predestinated what to the rivers of water his root shall not wither he says oh hallelujah though he dies i'll raise him up again at the last day what the life goes down into the roots but it rises again in the in the spring he says that's right he is predestinated to be there just not just by chance he was predestinated to catch that word when it what was sowed catching are you catching the word that's being sold he says you're predestinated to do it he says and she'll be right there when it sticks she is there he's planted not just stuck down he says he's actually planted that's right it's a lot different between sticking a stick in the ground and planting something this is done with purpose and intent he says people that have a life like this have been planted they've been purposefully placed in a way that they can grow spiritually he says it's different the seed was planted it found its own root holes he says there was a place prepared for it to get in there and start growing and when the water began to come in and bring forth its life the spirit it began to say you say there are nine spiritual gifts and he says amen jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen he still heals the way he always did amen amen amen he says what that man that's planted by the rivers of life is going to say amen to every word of god he says he's planted by the rivers rivers coming from every side rivers of water no wonder he can't winter wither no wonder he's planted some of them seeds fell over there he can't die it's right in the stream of life it keeps producing that's right it's drawing its life out of them rivers rivers the new testament and the old testament amen just being fed right on through what is it genesis to revelation that's how we keep living that's how we keep growing as we keep that alignment between the first and the last amen from the beginning and the end it has to line up and that's how we know that we're on the right path amen that it's life that's coming through us and then i've talked to believers that i luck up to i fellowship with believers that i i see a great consistency in and every single one of them tells me if you want to get close to god do what brother brahm said read your bible and pray every single day don't take saturdays off right don't take sundays off just because you're going to church every day read your bible and pray and guess what the world will take up every time that you set aside so you've got to set aside and say this is my time for the lord no matter what no matter what and sometimes what i'm finding is that means you get up earlier and earlier amen but you still got to get that time otherwise you're going to come to the end of the day and you're going to wonder why you're so beat out and it's because you haven't taken the time to do what rivers of life and then start drinking from the rivers of life you can't be much help if you're destroyed yourself if you're withered up if you're dried out if you're you're scaly and hard what if you can start your morning like that you're going to do a whole lot better to those you run into i think amen otherwise what the holy spirit's not there to quicken what you if you don't bring anything in then how can the holy spirit quicken it right you've got the holy spirit i'm not taking away your christianity but if he's got nothing to quicken then you've got nothing to offer and now you're feeding on yesterday's manna and guess what that's maggoty right it's lost it's savor it's lost it's the good flavor it's it's it's dead that was for yesterday you've got to have something new each and every day almost done paul says first corinthians 12 we're back here again he says he's talking about gifts and why they're given he says but the manifestation of the spirit that's what these gifts are the true gifts or manifestations of the spirit is given to every man to profit with all amen it's the prophet and benefit the body of christ for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom to another the word of knowledge by the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another gifts of healing by the same spirit you look at that wisdom that can look at it that can look like a lot of different things can't it it can be words it can be actions it can be your presence presence meaning you being you know there with somebody it can be fellowship and then these are not all things that are just you know ethereal something out there but these are real tangible things that can that can really be shown to people amen a word of knowledge word of knowledge just say the right thing at the right time to the right person amen amen and it's god speaking it's not you speaking amen faith how do we cover faith what does faith look like faith is a revelation of the will of god but you've got to have faith in so many different things that to have a gift of faith you got to go if you're going to go pray for somebody if you're going to intercede in a situation you've got to know that god wants you to do it and so that faith comes after what you seeking out the will of god and getting that direction that can look like a lot of different things whether you can be financially helping somebody you can go to talk to somebody you can have a dream of somebody and say hey i had a dream about this i wanted to run it by you what sometimes there's an issue there sometimes there's an issue and you say brother i dream this about you i have no idea if it means something but i felt that i should come tell you about it right and sometimes you don't need to give any you don't need to give them what it means they know exactly what it means and the fact that you told them no is letting them know what the lord has an eye on this situation and either you better watch out or you're on the right path or you need to be careful or you better look out because something's headed your way right it can be in so many different ways that these things come a gift of healing what's healing physical mental emotional spiritual all these different things right healing takes on so many different facets you can heal through music right you can heal through the preaching of the word you can heal through fellowship right you can heal through good food you can heal through helping somebody out in a time of need so many things that we can do to heal somebody amen he says what to another the working of miracles this was the operations we were talking about to another prophecy to another discerning of spirits to another diverse kinds of tongues to another the interpretation of tongues but he finishes and says but all these worketh that but all of these worketh that one and selfsame spirit dividing to every man severally as he will what that means is that the holy spirit is always the one that's operating those gifts amen brother branham says these gifts are not necessarily creation gifts meaning that you're born with them he says these can be operated in most people at any time based on what the need of the body is so one day brother bob could come up and lay hands on somebody and they could get healed and then the next day brother mark could do the same thing and then the next day brother joe could do it and then the next day brother josh and then the next day brother gerald it can move around in the body based on the need and based on what the surrender and the yielding of that vessel to be open to that sort of thing lots of people wouldn't have the courage to do something like that but they can always go and they can help in other different ways right but these things are available to all but then you have others that have actual ministries based on this and that's maybe a slightly different thing amen but all of them he says in the end it's dividing to every man as he will it's not our choosing amen it's god's choosing this is a long quote i'm going to read but stick with me here if you will he says and the power that will raise us up is right in us now we're talking about a body of christ now we are now in heavenly places and we are now in the power of the resurrection if there wasn't a law to that sons and daughters of god would create them a world out here and go live a private life on it you have the power in you to do it if you've got a shadow of the power of god in you you've got power to do it god is omnipotent he says see what i mean the power that's in you will make create you could speak a world into existence and go live on it he says hallelujah there you are but he says there's a law that says you can't do it that's the reason you don't do this because he doesn't he hasn't allowed us to do it but he says if you realize who you are and that law wasn't there we could go create a world and live on it we could get out of all of this he says that's what power is in the church now but it is controlled by a law that's in the body of believers that's in us right now is what he's saying he said this in 1961 and it's still here he says and that law he says it's controlled by a law so this is collectively he says there's power in the church now you say john we're talking about the overcomers why are we talking about gifts and body unification these different things because what there's a power when we are together that is greater than when we are individuals and then we've got to be able to work together on some of these things we aren't going to achieve it on our own so if you want to be an overcomer and do about without your neighbor next to you it's not going to happen you look at the natural when the children of israel did they didn't do it all alone they had help right they had their neighbors helping them they had they had the neighboring tribes there what keeping the place clean keeping enemies out we've got to work together on this and that's why i'm focused so much i believe on this is because there's some things we're going to overcome as a group and there's some things we're going to overcome as an individual amen he says that's what power is in the church now but it is controlled by a law and that law is not keeping a bunch of commandments it's a law of faith jesus said all things are possible to them that believe and if you can believe it listen what he says and if you can believe it whatever god will lead your soul to believe that is yours you say that's crazy what that brother's believing if the lord led him to believe it hallelujah it's going to happen that sister is nuts what is she thinking that's going to happen for the holy spirit has led her to believe it and so it's going to happen if you can believe it and it's the holy spirit quickening it to you he says what that is yours not you might have it or you should get it he says that is yours personal possession amen so when he drops down into our hearts and he leads us to believe for the supernatural why would we think that anything other than a supernatural god is going to fulfill it why would we believe in the supernatural if there wasn't a god that was going to fulfill it he dropped supernatural thoughts into our human hearts so that he can show himself to be god amen every place the souls of your foot can sit upon by faith god gives it to you amen it's yours you possess it if you can find the key to this law of faith that opens it to you he says you see what i mean that power is controlled by if you are a son of god you are a daughter of god that never leaves you it's with you all the time but your faith gets away from it but it's still there he says hallelujah what you may step away from it but it doesn't step away from you it's always available he says when you are saved god gives you faith to rise from the muck of the earth amen he says your faith overcomes the things of the world what is your faith your faith in that act that god has done in you to make you a son of god you quit your line you quit your stealing you quit your drinking because your faith rises above it amen if you don't do it you don't have any faith he says what and by faith are you saved and that through grace as much as your faith will be released that's how much power you can have so the only limit here is our faith which means that the only limit then is what god will reveal to be his will because if you see that as god's will then your faith will rise to the occasion and you can have what you will because it's not what you will now but it's him that put the will inside of you in the first place he says as much as your faith will be released that's how much power you can have because in you dwells the power to make heavens and earth god dwells in you and you are sons and daughters of god amen there you are but it's your faith jesus said according to your faith be it unto you if thou canst believe all things are possible verily i say unto you if you say unto this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe what you have said [Music] he says then what kind of people are we to be having faith in this great redeeming christ that lives in us this smitten rock that never leaves the church amen the never failing presence of jesus christ not in our midst only but in our lives in your life because he says what you have the holy spirit inside of you he is ever present inside of you he says what kind of people are we to be he says that smitten rock never leaves the church i am with you always even to the end of the world the ever presence of the great gusher gusher what's a gusher look like when they have a gusher in the oil field do you know what it looks like uncontrollable pressure uncontrollable power they can put the biggest valve they want on it and it blows through the valve and it shoots at 150 feet up in the air and covers their equipment in oil it's a gusher it's a pressure that cannot be contained that's what's inside of you he says the ever presence it never relieves that's what he's saying it never dies down it never loses its power the ever presence of the great gusher of salvation and power that poured forth from calvary into the church the ever presence of the living god the great flowing smitten rock that goes with us in our journey you read that call and you say what could ever hold us back why aren't we in a rapture why aren't every one of us healed why aren't all of us lovable now slipped that one in didn't i amen what's holding us back let me add fuel to the fire and then we'll close we'll set you on fire till the next service amen brother says this now let me tell you something each man and woman that's born again with the spirit of god in him is a miniature creator now that might shake you a little bit but that's the truth do you know you're a creator brother david do you know you're a creator [Music] he says you are he says you're a creator every man and every woman that's born again with the spirit of god in him is a miniature creator amen that means we've got power and he doesn't give power without a way to use it doesn't give power for no reason right god doesn't give it to us to show off he does it for what to allow us to achieve the purpose that he has for our lives he says now that might shake you a little bit but that's the truth we're in the image of god and god is a creator that's the reason that you can believe that god could heal a person is because god is in you and god made this world he just spoke it and his word became material the very ground that you're sitting on is the word of god made manifest that that that shook me when i read that amen that shakes me when we say the very thing we're standing on here literally is the word of god he's not talking about this in this way he says the very thing you're standing on is the word of god made manifest what's he saying is that the word of god always becomes a reality amen it doesn't leave his word his mouth and come back void but it goes out and it accomplishes that which he has sent it forth to do it becomes a reality it comes into existence where something before was chaos and confusion amen where it was in a fallen state whatever it might be the word of god comes forth into something that we can stand on amen he says he just spoke it and his word became material the very ground you're setting on is the word of god may manifest if he didn't where does he get it see he just spoke it and it turned into existence it turned into existence from nothing became something he believed in his own word and if a man last one brother visual and if a man's born of the spirit of god he's an offspring of god and that part of god is in him and he believes every word that god says will materialize see and so that makes him part of god that makes you part of god if you have the holy spirit he says the holy spirit in the man makes him a part of god amen let's stand to our feet if we will the holy spirit in the man the holy spirit in the woman makes her a part of god amen what a powerful thing to believe amen not just affiliated with him you know not just some sort of a relationship but this makes you a part of god that you can identify yourself with the great jehovah god amen what a place he's put us in this is what we're talking about now miniature creators that's what these gifts are doing is what you're doing is you're bringing forth what the word you're manifesting the word you're manifesting the will of god and what brother brown is pointing us back and saying is look if he puts the holy spirit in you he's got you here for a purpose he's got you here to do something and it's going to be to manifest the word and sometimes it's to manifest it in somebody else and sometimes it's to manifest it in you but you're there to help every single one of us bring out what god has placed inside of our lives amen amen let's just bow our heads together heavenly father lord what an encouragement lord to know that we are not just lord distant relatives but lord we are a part of you we are your body lord we are your wife though we are a very part of the life and eternal nature of god heavenly father and it's not by anything we've done lord not by anything we will do lord but it's by your own foreknowledge lord because you knew us and thought of us and and brought us into existence lord according to your own will and desire lord we're so thankful that we can say that and see it tonight lord but we need a greater revelation of it we know lord for brother branham said we live so far below our condition our our rights lord lord we live so so far below our privileges but lord we know we're being quickened lord we know our faith is being challenged lord and we want to rise to the test heavenly father as you place lord these desires for your word to be made manifest in our lives though may you give us the humility may you give us the character lord to take that great authority and power and to do your will with it heavenly father lord we want to see each other grow we want to see each other benefit lord we want to be bound stronger in those chains of love heavenly father to where each one is looking into the other and seeing where they can help lord lord would you just strengthen us together lord may you bind us together lord under the great leadership of your holy spirit lord to the point that we are in perfect unity working one with the other lord under your headship lord we pray your grace to each one quicken us lord to your word lord may it be personal and direct to each and every one of us we pray now in your name we ask it amen amen amen i love you lord and i lift my voice to worship you i think it's 7 48. you know that one i love you lord and i lift my voice [Music] rejoice joy my king in him what you hear and it be a sweet sweet sound in your ear i love you lord and i live my voice to
