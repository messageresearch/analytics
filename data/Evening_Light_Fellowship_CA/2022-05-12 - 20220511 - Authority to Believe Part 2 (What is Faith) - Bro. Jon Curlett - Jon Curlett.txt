praying that as the river flows tonight that we would drink and we would drink deeply lord your prophet said how does a tree grow it drinks more than it needs and it pushes out plant it pushes out fruit it pushes out branches it pushes out leaves lord god and lord we want to bear the fruit of your holy spirit in our lives day in and day out so lord as we've gathered may we just drink tonight of your word lord may not just fill us but may it cleanse us lord may it wash us may it just prepare us lord for your presence lord may it draw us into closer relationship with you we pray amen lord minister to your people here now we pray lord many not here tonight lord we pray your grace to them each one in jesus christ's name we ask it amen amen thank you musicians that'll be it you'll turn your scriptures to hebrews chapter 11. and then hebrews chapter 11 it's good to have sister maureen back and then good to have sister justine back amen good to be here this evening i uh i still am not a hundred percent well and i was down and just after supper just kind of going through my notes and preparing and i i said lord i've got a headache i said would you just take it away so i can preach fully here tonight and something just went over me and it went completely away right then and there amen he still moves and then he's moved by the request of his sons and daughters he's moved by the by people that want to serve him amen he's moved by people that desire to do something for him and brother branham has always said if you're in the line of duty then you can ask what you will to get it done amen now i had to preach whether or not i had a headache but it's his grace that takes away the headache amen and makes it a little easier tonight and then so i'm thankful for that also had a we had a request come through the website recently and brother matt ford to me of a young man or a man i don't know how old he is he wanted to know more about the message so he's in nova scotia and he was asking if there was a church or believers there or something so i put him in contact with brother alex cater brother alec volunteered very quickly he said yes i'd love to to talk to him he just wanted to had some questions wanted to know about water baptism and these things he reached out to me again today and said that he's got the the message app and he listens to the message every day so i don't know how he he got a hold of this i don't know where it's coming from amen but isn't that just like god to just reach in and just one person here and one person there and all of a sudden they're they've got they've got the the word of the hour and they're they're walking towards the rapture the same as if they're always doing today manny just touches them and brings them up to a place so we want to remember bradley in our prayers and of course brother alec as he he talks with him and fellowships with them may it be just a benefit to both of them amen and may draw them closer to god amen hebrews chapter 11 very familiar verse verse 1 says now faith is the substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen and then god bless you you can have your seats this evening man we want to continue our little series that we started on authority to believe and i want to take a very simple thought tonight of what is faith and then what is faith and we've been hearing a lot about faith and wisdom versus faith in these different things and i think for many of us we could take that one scripture and we could take the quote where brother braham said faith is a revelation of the will of god and we'd say brother jonathan how are you going to take a full service on that amen but we'll find there's more to it as we get into the word that there you know we want to expand on it we want to dig deeper into it so i'm going to teach a little bit tonight amen so just settle in we won't be too long but we men what do we do teaching for preaching is great we love the preaching because it's it's energetic and it you know it's dynamic and it can excite us in these different things but brother braham says teaching is to do what is to positionally place the believer amen he talks about the the he says i find there's two types of people he says there's the pentecostals and there's the fundamentalists he says the pentecostals they he says they they write checks but there's no money in the bank he said the fundamentalist he says they don't know how to write a check but they got tons of money in the bank he says if you could ever get two of them together then you'd have it and what was he saying he said one of them has faith but doesn't know how to use it and the other one has no faith but they keep saying that they're going to be doing something with it he meant he says you got to bring those two things together and so teaching is what gives us the structure it puts us on a sure foundation so that way when we do step out by faith and then when we do walk through life then we know that we're walking on a path that god has set and not one of our own making so i want to go back to that that verse in hebrews 11 verse 1 it says now faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen now in the amplified it says now faith is the assurance that is the confirmation the title deed something you can hold if we can put it that way the title deed of the things we hope for being the proof of things we do not see and the conviction of their reality in other words faith is perceiving as real fact what is not revealed to the senses so faith is not something that will show you something that your five senses can contact amen but it's something brother brown would even call faith the sixth sense that it is something outside of our natural senses and it is something that declares it to be real that word substance in the original language it means the substructure the foundation it says that which has actual existence a substance a real being brother branham would say faith what faith declares is more real than the very desk that i'm standing behind tonight amen he says that's how real faith is is that it it overrides anything you can see feel taste touch hear these different things amen so what the scripture says that faith is the foundation the structure the reality upon which you rest those things which you desire and hope for amen you can't touch it you can you can't put faith in your pocket and yet and let yet you know it is something real you know it's something that you have and so when you combine faith which is the foundation which hope with hope which is the desire you have that's when you get real belief amen faith is an expectation faith is forward-looking hope is really just a desire hope is you know we would say well i i hope i get a good job or i hope i meet a great guy in maryam or i hope i meet a great girl and marry her or i hope i win the lottery as many people in the world would say today it's all hope but there's no substance behind it and let's face it you have no more chance of winning the lottery than you do of walking off this earth without having a relationship with god it's not going to happen it'll happen for one but it'll have nothing to do with their faith amen it's going to be pure luck for them amen amen hope is something you want but you have no assurance that you're going to get it amen now it's not that hope is wrong paul said that we have what hope faith and love he says those abide with the believer we have a hope amen we have a blessed hope though not just a hope we have something that that god has told us to look towards and so we have a hope in our hearts that says i want what god has offered for me that god has promised to me amen but of those he said you have hope faith and charity or love he says of all those three love is the greatest not even faith was a grace he said love was the greatest thing of all of those amen so it's not wrong to have hope humanity is mostly hopeful i think hope springs eternal in the human nature i think but there is no rest in hope there's no joy in hope but it is just something that you have a dream about or an idea about and you start to think that maybe you could get it and it's a hope there's no there's no reality to it but faith is different faith is hope with substance amen faith is hope with purpose faith is hope with direction faith is hope with action it's hope with understanding and it's hope with expectation amen it takes the the ethereal part of hope and it brings it to something that you can now start to feel as solid and real now you can have human faith and i think sometimes that's what hope really is is it's human faith you have this idea you have this desire and so you have this hope and you start to think that maybe it's going to happen for some reason amen humanity has faith and brother brown talks about him we'll read some quotes and you'll you'll you can read about people and you hear about people that say i just knew it was going to happen and it happened and that comes down to human faith brother brown says there is a human faith and there is a power behind that human faith but that's not where we want to rest as believers amen we want to have the faith of god not the faith of humanity brother branham puts it this way he says so there is genuine faith but you must come into the real channel of god to have that genuine faith you say brother jonathan how do i get faith come into the real channel of god that's what we're looking for there's human faith then there's faith of god and you must have a godly faith to believe now brother brown's preaching to christians and he's saying to believe the word of god you've got to move past the human faith and into the faith of god not just faith in god but he says you've got to move into the faith of god he says i believe he's speaking here just before a prayer line he says if you will just be reverent and just take all the faith that you've got as human faith and turn it over into the hands of god and say now lord take my little that i got to give you and let your faith come to me so he says don't hold on to the human side don't hold on to the human faith he says take that and give it to god and say god let your faith now come to me i'm going to give up what i've got the thing i'm clinging to the little hope the little idea and i'm giving it to you and i'm letting you come now and give me your faith into my life he says i believe he'll heal you and let me call you right out from this platform without you even coming up here at all he says could you believe it he's challenging the faith of the people this is faith is our victory is the message he says there's only one faith and that's the faith of god that's right god's faith your human faith don't go very far it'll go somewhere but it won't go very far for the believer but god's faith in you makes you love everybody makes me love everybody that's right that's what god's faith does to you it makes you have the same feeling that jesus did because what the spirit of christ is in you i love how he says it makes me have that you have the same feeling not necessarily in human emotion amen but it makes you love everyone in a godly way or it makes you have a godly love it's an interesting concept because we tend to put faith in this box and say well faith is for healing or faith is for deliverance or faith is for provision and things like that but brother brahm says no no it's not quite that simple he says and faith and love is a relation because you can't have faith unless you've got love because your faith is in a god who is the very essence of love faith and love works together right if we look at first john 4 it says and we have known and believed the love that god had to us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him hearing is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world amen not in the world to come but he says in this world now we're the same as christ there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear not just love but he says perfect love casts out fear because fear had torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love now remember brother brahms talking now on a faith that will rapture you amen we're not just talking about faith that will deliver you or faith that will heal you we're talking about a faith that goes beyond that now we'll see as we go that there is no difference in the faith that heals you than the faith that raptures you it's the exact same faith there is no difference in it the question is how much you'll allow it to have an effect in your life really amen amen and we'll see as we go into it what that really is but he's talking about perfect faith which is the highest expression of faith that you can have and brother branham when he's talking about perfect faith what does he say he's talking about the other side and he says not but perfect faith can go there he says not but perfect love can enter there so we're talking about faith but he says it's going to take perfect love to get you over there not perfect faith you've got to have perfect love before you have perfect faith amen so what is it the faith of god must align with the love of god because god is love that's what he's saying if you're going to dwell in god then it's going to be in love so your faith is going to align with the way that god's love works now we know that god's love is not all cuddles and kisses and hugs if you're a child you've been spanked by god amen if you're a child of god you've been disciplined by god so his love is not always the one that makes you feel warm and fuzzy amen but it has so many aspects to it it's corrective it's supportive it's encouraging it's guiding and yes it's comforting and all those things we associate with love but it's not just a good feeling it's not just a good feeling god's love it's it's multifaceted amen brother brown will put it this way it says we don't take emotion now it takes faith and love he says lord i love you you couldn't lie because you're god i love you love settles the thing when you love your wife with all your heart with all your soul you just love her there ain't nobody in the town could make you believe she wasn't a good woman that's right see the same thing the old tattletails will come tell you your husband isn't true to you when you really love him and they've got confidence in him is that right love just covers it over that's all and when you love god all the fears just scatter everywhere and you just say god you're right god you're right doesn't matter what the skeptics are saying doesn't matter what the tattletails are saying it doesn't matter what the symptoms are saying it says love knowing that you love god and he's a god of love it will say god you're right and i love you and i'm healed and i just go on and take it he says that's it everything can happen spontaneously if you just believe it so often what happens is we're believing for healing we're believing for deliverance we're here we're believing for provision and what we're doing is we're believing we're believing we're believing and then we hit the point where faith comes into reality and that's when the work is done god was working all along but there's a moment where things change and you know it's a finished work i'll take you back to my sister elena she was believing for healing she was praying for healing everyone's believing and what happens is in a in a twinkling of an eye in a moment in a service she realizes i'm healed amen did she have faith prior to that of course she did but there's a moment where that reality comes in and that's what he's saying he's saying spontaneously you believe and it can happen right then and there it doesn't have to and it doesn't mean it will but he says when you believe it then it can happen right then and there there's nothing to hold it back amen so he's saying your love of god your trust that he is a loving god will bring you to faith that he will do what he was promised in his word that he will do he says why because you love me god and i love you love brings you to trust and that trust is where your faith starts amen you've got to trust that he's doing going to do what he said he would he says you take him at his word because you trust him and because you trust him you believe him and that's always got to be that first step there's always a first step and then after that once he proves himself then you just move further and further in your trust in your relationship with him brother brown would say this he says he caught me when i was nothing i'm still nothing but i'm in his hand and he loved me when i was unlovable he loved you when he was unlovable but he changed you can you say he's changed you just like the colored sister that time and her testimony she said i'm not what i ought to be i'm not what i want to be but then i'm not what i used to be she knew she had come somewhere something happened and that's the way it is if god when i was an alien from him so love me till he stooped down to get me and pick me up that gives me confidence that he wants to use me he doesn't pick somebody up if he doesn't want to use them so this is how simple faith is we're talking on what is faith and brother brown is bringing it back to the very choice of god and choosing you you didn't choose him he chose you he says because he chose you that means he's going to use you and that means you're going to have faith to bring the word to reality in your life it's as simple as he chose you therefore you will have faith and you do have faith to do what god has expected of you amen he stooped down to get me and pick me up that gives me confidence that he wants to use me he's got a purpose in doing it he's seen something in me he's seen something in you amen why because he picked you the same way he picked the prophet he says he had a reason to save you look at the people that's unsafe today and we look around we've got 35 40 people here and we've got 750 000 in newfoundland why us plus the folks in central maybe 60 or 70 people across the island out of 700 000 or 500 000 whatever it is why us because he's going to use you because he has a purpose for you he says look at the millions he could have took beside you but he took you amen no one can take your place amen you're in god's economy no one can do it that's his love to you then won't your love reach right back to him and there's a love affair no matter what the situation is its circumstances is governed by this love that creates faith that god loves you and you love god and you love one another and that brings the faith all right he says then it can't keep from bringing out just exactly what god promised it would do amen brother ron spencer any time he he he speaks to you know he he works with young men and young ministers and whatnot and you know what he always says to them brother ron how do i grow in ministry you know what he says fall in love with jesus fall in love with jesus oh should i study yeah you should study but you better love him before you start studying man because otherwise you're not going to do anybody to look a good amen so we tend to look at ourselves and we say do i have faith but brother brahm takes us deeper and he says do you have love and when we say do you have love what he means is have you experienced love because if you've experienced love then faith will always follow with it is what he's saying and if you've experienced love that love will be reprojected back to god and it'll be reprojected to the people that you come in contact with every single day amen sometimes we have plenty of faith in the general sense but the question is then do you have love to make that faith work the way it ought to amen look it you want you want to see the perfect expression of faith for this hour look at brother branham and he's going to pray for somebody remember and he walks into the field where that bull is laying under the tree and what does he do he startles the bull out of its sleep and it gets up and it starts to paw on the ground it's going to charge him brother bram says he was going to kill me now most people today would stand up and they would say i am the prophet of the lord thus saith the lord get back under that tree don't you come near me why i've got faith what if brother branham said he projected there what did he say he said i'm sorry i disturbed you i didn't realize you were there he says but i'm on a mission for the king. he says so you're going to have to just go and lay down because i'm on his business he says and that bull just basically blank turned around walked and didn't even look at him another time what was it love projected amen and faith was operational in it the love made the faith do the right thing because what he was on the king's mission but he wasn't there to rule with a rod of iron he was there to rule with love because what christ rules us with love so the expression of christ to us is always going to be god's love and so the perfect expression of faith will be through god's perfect love you've got to have them in alignment amen so faith we see is what faith to believe for something that god has promised each and every one of us amen if we can find it in his word he says perfect love is the only thing can enter there amen but what we've got to miss we've got to find the intention of the holy spirit that's when you can have true faith is when you can find the will of god and we'll get into that maybe in the next service lord willing amen we have faith often to believe for something but because it's personal or selfish then god can't honor it we've got a personal intent rather than a love of god or a kingdom of god effect that we're looking for amen but when we look at faith he says it's substance it's real it's tangible that you have it and then paul takes us further and he says it's not just substance real but he says it's evidence it's proof that word evidence means that by which a thing is proved or tested a conviction an assurance of reality and truth so when you have faith that faith itself is the evidence that something is coming your way amen so it's something that's real but the fact that you have faith in the first place as a believer is proof that god is going to answer your prayer because that faith comes from him it's something that he gives amen and we'll see why that is in a little bit but if you don't have faith then there's nothing coming but if you have faith then it shows that god's given you faith because there's something coming down the road amen faith gives you insight into what god's doing so you know what to expect and you're looking for it and you're an expectation amen it's kind of like when you go to costco now i don't know if anybody's bought any high-end electronics at costco but when you go to costco if you want to buy an ipad you can't just walk up and take an ipad have you ever noticed that they've got the ones out there that show you what it looks like and you can play around with it but if you want to buy an ipad what do you do you go and you take that cardboard tag off of the wall and you take it up to the desk and you say i want an ipad that's what faith is like i've got the ipad tag in my hand that means as long as i paid for that ipad i'm going to get an ipad faith is the evidence that one there's an ipad available that two there's a price on it if you pay the price you can get an ipad now i might go up there and i hand that to them and i pay for it now i might get an ipad in 30 seconds or i might get an ipad in 10 minutes depending on how busy they are maybe it's way back in the corner and they've got to go up and and get a forklift or something to get them down or something like that but i know that if the price has been paid and that i've got the tag there that says that an ipad's in the warehouse i'm getting an ipad at one moment or another aren't they so it's the beautiful thing is that with that merchandise take it's the same as the word of god amen you have a promise that's written on the tag faith takes it and you take it up and you go to the register and you say i want what's on this tag but here's the difference you don't have to pay for it it's already been paid for remember brother brown says he says just walk in the store and start taking what you want off the shelves because it's all open for you you just have to take it and then i think sometimes that's the biggest problem is we think that we've got to go pay a price to get what god has already freely offered to us and what happens is we get in our own way and we start tripping over our own humanity and our own flaws and failures and these different things and it bogs us down when god says look the price is paid just bring the tag up let your faith be the evidence that there's something there and go up and redeem it from the from the front desk that's all he's asking us to do amen amen aside from having to be obedient so in obedience to the word there's nothing you can do to add to or make you more worthy to get a redemptive blessing from god it's a redemptive blessing it's given to you it's part of your redemption so you don't add to it you can't add anything to it all that god has ever required is that you be in obedience to his word when you come believing brother rahm says if you can meet the requirements of the of the first person that got it then you'll get it every single time he says here he says it's like this if i told you with all my heart if you were hungry and starving to death and you had supreme confidence in me as a truthful person and i told you where there was a thousand dollars lane how you'd get to it what road you go exactly where to go to and you understand exactly where the money is laying see then you would start rejoicing right then just the same as if you had the money if you believe me so you see before you're ever feeling any different or anything else you can be just as happy over your healing and saying you got it because you are positive sure you've got it because you got confidence in the one that promised it to you we're talking about what is faith now he says your c your confidence is that he cannot lie and he's told you exactly where it was laying at and then you got confidence that you're going you got it already because that is your faith which is the earnest of your redemption in other words you're trying to be redeemed from sickness and your faith is the earnest of your healing as long as something says in your heart i'm the lord that heals you that's just as good that's all you need or you can start just as happy no matter what happens if you don't get it if you get worse you're still just as happy as you was you was perfectly well because you've got the assurance that it's over how many understands that now let's see your hand he says there you are it's the evidence of things not not seen so faith is something that is real to you and then he says faith is something that holds you because it's the evidence that something is coming your way faith is your proof that god is moving on your behalf and you're going to get your answer back with results amen now that sounds great and we all want to have it but let's tie it down specifically to what faith is what is real faith for a believer this is anointed ones at the end time five months to the day before brother branham died he says what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of god very simple very simple but yet it gets so complicated sometimes because the thing is it's like we talked about the beginning you got people writing checks and there's no money in the bank why because they're not in alignment with the will of god you've got to find the will of god to have faith you don't just have faith for anything this is not a prosperity doctrine or anything else this is not a career prosperity or a marriage prosperity doctrine or anything like that you've got to find the will of god because faith is a revelation of the will of god amen so if we know there's one thing when it comes to faith it's that it cannot be contrary to the will of god you can't have the faith of god and be contrary to the will of god and what is the will of god it's his word it's always his word you can't have faith in something that is contrary to the word of god amen i know this is basic and i'm teaching but we want it to be basic amen if you're building on a foundation it better be simple and it better be solid amen we don't want to turn this into anything complicated he says a man and a woman is one and christ is one body the word the bride will have to be the rest of that body and the two together makes the one body again like adam was at the beginning man and his wife are one now she the true bride is so sold out to him that she uses no mind of her own his mind of course is his will and his will is his word his will is his word that makes it so simple amen remember in our first service where we read that quote where the of the woman at the well and brother branham says she had scriptural authority to believe why because she could take her experience back to the word of god that's how she knew that she could believe that that was the messiah was because her experience matched what the word said that he was going to do amen and that's where the believer rests is when you can read in the word what is supposed to happen and your faith lines up with that then you said then it's got to happen that's the only way it's going to go is if it lines up with the word of god amen there might be situations we get into and maybe we can't find a scripture we don't have one necessarily at that moment but when you do find that scripture when you do find that word and it's solid from genesis to revelation because let's face it we got lots of people will post one scripture from one place and say that's the will of god and they don't run it through from the start to the end and they get out of balance that's how you get prosperity doctrine right it's because they say that god wants to bless you and all these different things but no no no it says you've got to be in obedience to god and you've got to worship him with all your heart soul and mind and these different things and they say no no god just wants to bless me and that's what i'm going to focus on right you got to pull it from genesis to revelation but when you've run that scriptural promise through from start to end then now you can rest on it amen we can have confidence in that we're in the will of his god we're in the will of god rather so when we take on this concept of his will as his word everything else falls into place because you can't be selfish and be in god's will right you can't be prideful in being god's will you can't be image conscious and be in god's will because love works with faith and so the things you ask of god will reflect that love and that love of god is always for one purpose and that is for the benefit of the kingdom of heaven always it's not for the benefit of you personally it's for the benefit of the kingdom of god and that's how it works and operates amen we had a uh an interesting time a week or two ago we had a hispanic immigrant family over to our house and jonathan met him at a camp there and said he was really nice and of course my wife being hispanic she wants to you know connect with anybody like that so we had the mower to the house and and and blanca took them over to the lottery home that's that's up for the lottery now i don't play the lottery i don't play those lotteries either and and as they were walking over there this family has nothing they left everything behind in in mexico they had good jobs and and whatnot and they came here she barely speaks any english he speaks a little bit the boys are are doing quite well but they left everything behind to come here and they're in this little tiny apartment and they have no vehicles and they don't have anything and as they were walking there i thought how neat it would be if they won the lottery home now they don't play the lottery either because they're professing christians but i thought if they did play the lottery how neat it would be if they won the home because you know what most of us would say well we'd say well i've got faith that i'm going to win the lottery home but guess what we all have houses that serve our needs but yet we would apply that faith selfishly to say well it's for me and in the meantime god's already given you everything you have need of and yet we sit there and we want to have faith for something that would help us know that faith should be for the benefit of somebody that actually has a need rather than to give you more than you actually have need of i mean what is it it's a faith that's looking out not just for yourself but it's for somebody else it's for the benefit of others amen amen we don't want to get caught up in getting ahead we want to get caught up into getting into heavenly places amen that's what we're looking for that's the reason that brother branham i believe in that i'm tying love and faith together here has become we come to the place where jesus himself the greatest faith worker the greatest healer that ever walked on the earth he had a great purpose here and it was not to lift himself up it wasn't to lift himself up what was it what was his purpose we go in john 4. this is right after he spoken to the woman at the well and remember they come back and they say you know do you want meat and he says i have meat of which you know nothing and they said what are you talking about and he says jesus said unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work so the faith that jesus had was to do one thing and that was to do the will of the father and to finish the work that the father had given him to do on this earth and that's only what that faith was applied for he wasn't going out trying to establish a kingdom trying to establish a ministry trying to get a a great home or a great temple or take over build up a big apostolic army but it was to do the will of his father and to finish the work that he'd been sent to do so he's saying my meat my satisfaction what fulfills me is to do the will of the father so that's where his faith came from was because he was doing the will of the father in every aspect of his life he was looking always for the will we look for the faith and that's our problem we're not supposed to look for the faith we look for the will and then the faith will follow amen that's how you get that's how you get faith as you look for the will of god when you find the will of god then you can have the faith to claim it amen so jesus he had no thought of his own he had no ego he had no image concerns no hang-ups with how people perceived him amen why because they had nothing to do with what fulfilled him that's why we care about what other people say and think it's because it has an impact on us for jesus he didn't care he didn't give a flip right why because he was looking to do the will of the father and as long as his father said this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell that was fine with jesus that's all he was looking for was what that point of adoption where god said hey that's my son hear him that's what we're looking for isn't it we talk about speaking the word but can you come to the place where you say the only thing that i'm that i'm satisfied with and the only thing i'm seeking is the will of god in my life so often i appreciated brother david's prayer he says the fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much and so often we think that's prayer to change the situation it's not it's prayer to catch the will of god so we'll know how to approach the situation amen amen that's what we're looking for is our prayer is not to change god or or anything like that but it's to catch the mind of god so we know how to go into life and how we walk through these different things let's bring it down on on on our personal level amen romans 12 verse 1 says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service he's saying do the same thing jesus did and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god had dealt to every man the measure of faith so paul says listen you've got one job to do and that is to prove the will of god that is the purpose of the believer is to do and prove the will of god in your lives amen now listen that takes a renewing of your mind because you've got to now think like god we've got to take on the mind of christ and we don't have that right now we used to have it when we were back in the beginning before time began before we fell into sin we had the mind of christ but we dropped out of it we have no recollection and now through our redemptive process we have a renewing of your mind paul says and that renewing means that we've got work to do that we don't just get baptized with the holy spirit and we immediately have the mind of christ in all things it's a renewing it's something that's constantly working in us to bring us back to the fullness of the mind of christ in our lives each and every one we were part and parcel with him we're going to be part and parcel with him again but there's a renewing that has to happen in between amen as we drop down into time we lost that mind of christ and we've got to come by the holy spirit now and bring that back into us amen because what he's making us new he's making us back into what we used to be renewing he's making us new again that's what he's doing in our lives amen but as we mature paul says as we get closer he says he says don't think more highly of yourself he says don't get proud as you start to catch the mind of christ as you start to get mature as your prayer life starts to grow and god starts to show you what's supposed to be going on in life and you willingly step into it and things start to happen and god starts to move in your life he says don't get proud no because why he says what every man has been given a measure of faith remember the parable he says that when that when the fruit comes when the wheat grows some are 30 fold some are 60 fold some are a hundred fold who determined that it wasn't the wheat it's a measure that god gives each and every one of us so brother mark might have a great measure of faith and i might have a small measure of faith sister maurins might be public and josh's might be private as the case may be but regardless of what you have he says don't get prideful because it's still the grace of god to you in the first place because it's god that gives you those things it's god that puts these things into your life amen i've said it so many times recently that humility is power with god amen and when we talk about ourselves when we lift ourselves up when we put ourselves into the image then guess what the mirror breaks because we can't be in there jonathan corlett must decrease so that christ can increase in my life amen it's god that's working in us and sometimes it's so easy where you just say boy i knew that was going to happen and i looked for it and it happened yeah yeah yeah no no stay humble stay sober keep looking to christ give the glory to god and let him continue working in your life amen and when you do that paul says now you can tap into the very faith of jesus christ sometimes we only have the mind of christ in a certain area we have doors that are locked in our lives if we were to be honest in many times but when we open it and we give him the opportunity when we we come to a crossroads when we come to a decision when we when we're dealing with a certain thing and we come and we say lord i want your will i want to know your mind i want to know your thoughts i want to know what you think about this that gives him the opportunity to give us the mind of christ for that moment and really that's what matters most is in that moment doesn't it when you've got to make a decision when you've got to take a step when you've got to go forward you want to do it with the mind of christ in that area and then as you grow and mature and those things start to open more and more and more now it gets easier and easier and easier because there's less and less to get there to hinder your faith amen listen to what paul says here in galatians 2 20 says i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh don't look ahead the flesh is now he says the life i live now in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me he didn't say i live by faith of the son of god he says i live by the faith that is specific in particular he says that we live by the faith of the son of god which is jesus christ the prophet of god puts us this way he says in acts 3 16 when peter was asked how the mighty miracle had taken place upon the crippled one at the gate beautiful he explained it in this wise he said and his name jesus name through faith in his name jesus name has made this man this former strong yea the faith which is by and from jesus had given him this man this perfect soundness in the presence of you all see there it is jesus name and jesus faith brought about the miracle peter did not claim it was his own human faith any more than he claimed it was with his it was his own name he said that jesus name used in the faith which is from jesus perform that great work this faith is what the lord was speaking about in revelations 2 13 it was his faith it was not faith in him but it was his own faith that he had given to the believers romans 12 3 says according as god had dealt to every man and according to verse one the men are brethren so he's talking to believers the measure of faith ephesians 2 8 says by grace are you saved through faith and that faith is not of yourself it is a gift of god it also says in james 2 1 my brethren again talking to brethren have not the faith of our lord jesus christ with respect to persons in this pergamy and age where men were humanizing salvation having turned from the truth that salvation is of the lord and having cast aside the doctrine of election and opened wide the church door and their fellowship to any and all who dis who subscribed to their tenants never mind the word in this age of rapid degradation there were still the few who had the measure of that faith of our lord jesus christ and not only used that faith in acts of power but withstood those who dared to say that they were saved simply on the grounds of joining a church they knew no man could truly believe unto eternal life and the righteousness of god apart from the measure of faith of the lord jesus himself casa where he says what they open why the church doors and their fellowships to any and all who subscribe to their tenants guess what that can happen in the message i believe what brother branham said you're saved you're going in the rapture and it's furthest from the truth because that's the same thing that the the scribes and the pharisees had i believe what the word says great you're going in it no no no no no you've got to step way beyond that my friend way beyond that that's a starting place it's not a finishing place he says as today's church is filled with mental believers who endorse the virgin birth the shed blood going to church and taking communion and are not reborn at all even so in that third age was the same problem human faith wasn't enough then and it is not enough now it takes the very faith of the son of god to drop into a man's heart so that he can receive the lord of glory into the temple not made with hands this was a living faith i live by the faith of the son of god paul did not say he lived by faith in the son of god it was the faith of the son of god that had given him life and kept him living in christian victory amen you know what i love about this faith it's not mine not mine has nothing to do with me i can add to it and i can't take away from it everything that i need is in the faith of jesus christ because guess what he laid down his life he took it up again he healed the sick he raised the dead he delivered everything that we would ever want we saw in the life of jesus christ and he says this is no different than the faith that you receive it is the same faith that the believer receives today when they get the holy ghost it is the faith of the lord jesus christ himself in your life that keeps that that he says what that gives you life and keeps you living in christian victory amen it's not by your faith we sing that song something keeps holding me right is it me what they say brother branham did you keep your religion that said no what my religion kept me what is it it's the life it's the faith of christ inside of him amen so it's not mine to give it's not mine to grow it's not the mind to make it happen but all it is is accepting the very faith of jesus christ into my life how can i grow that faith i can't grow that faith it is it's the all-encompassing faith like i said that faith did everything we'd ever look for including a resurrection and a rapture amen so if it'll do that then i can't add to it i certainly can't diminish it but what i can do is i can affect how much i allow into my life as in how much i allow it into my life brother brown we talk about things that hinder our faith that's what i can do is get the hindrances out of the way that's that's something that i can look for that's something that i can work on is take away brother brown what color as paul did the sins that so easily beset us he says that's unbelief i can get the unbelief out so that faith can take its place that's all we're looking to do is that faith would overwhelm unbelief if we were to have a see-saw we've got unbelief here and we've got faith here all i'm looking to do is get enough faith off there so that faith can hit the ground unbelief get that off light enough that faith can hit the ground and finish the work it's all we're looking i mean i can adjust the effect because i can adjust what i allow into my life and i can take out things in my life but it's all about surrender in this case then right i can't make myself faith but i can take what i have and let it take an effect in my life so the key to the believer when they have faith that very faith of jesus christ is down to one thing and that's accept it and allow it to work in you don't hinder it don't hinder it don't do things that would hinder it don't hang around with people that would hinder it right don't fill your life with things that would hinder it from and this is me speaking from experience usually what that means is getting something out of the way and there's three things i have mark down here unbelief fear self-preservation that's it scared don't think it's real in the first place or you're trying to protect something and a lot of times it's ego and that facade that you have on the outside amen brother braham says this he says the super sense is the holy spirit what is the holy spirit it's the faith of god that dwells in you that's what he calls the holy spirit the faith of god that dwells in you and if you'll let the five senses be yielded to the sixth sense it'll guide you and bring all the other five senses under control of that super sense for it's so far above the natural sense as the spiritual man is above the natural it's as far as high as the heavens is above the natural man and his five senses it makes you believe things you cannot see it makes you act where you do not think the five senses would ever think about it the devil can get into these five senses and lie to you but he cannot touch that super sense that's far beyond his reach that come from god it's called faith and faith is that great thing he says the five senses do not control the sixth sense but the sixth sense controls the five senses the super sense controls the natural senses and the five senses is see taste feel smell here and the super sense is something that will make you believe god's word for that's the only thing it'll speak about it'll make you believe for things you can't see taste feel smell or hear because it'll take god's word and it will deliver that word to you and make you walk contrary to any other thing there is but god's word by faith he says faith does it amen so what the faith of god lines us up with the word of god and it makes us faithful what does faithful mean full of faith amen when you're when a person's faithful to something then what would we say if you are faithful at work what does it mean you show up every day you show on time you show up on time you put in a full day's effort and then you go home but every day if you show up and you do that they'd say that's a faithful employee so he's saying you're supposed to be faithful to the word of god full of faith you're supposed to be committed to the word of god you're supposed to be focused on the word of god and that's what shows your faithfulness shows that you're full of faith he says faith is a gift of itself how do i get a gift every gift we get from god is grace it starts with grace we'll get into it maybe a little bit later but faith is a gift of itself he says you may have a portion of it but there is a gift of faith just like some of you people anoint the sick and pray for them and you have a result that isn't a gift of healing he says that's a portion of faith there isn't a direct gift of healing for there's only one direct gift of healing there's only one direct gift of faith there's only one direct gift of miracles and so forth there was in the scriptures the apostles had it and they did mighty works philip and all of them but that was one gift of healing he's pointing to a single gift that does miracles that heals that delivers that does all of these things what is it he's pointing to one gift and that's acts 2 38 repent be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift amen of the holy spirit and as soon as they had that gift they did everything that jesus did he says there's only one gift and it's only the holy spirit there's only one gift of faith and it's the holy spirit there's only one gift of healing and it's the holy spirit so when he gives you the holy spirit he's given you faith he's giving you healing he's given you deliverance he's given you miracles he's given you every gift potentially that you could ever have need of what is it faith is the expression of the holy spirit in your life quickening the word to reality in you that's what faith is is the holy spirit working to quicken the word of god to you amen we read and we saw that the bride of jesus christ has the faith of jesus christ and what is that hebrews 16 13 this is the promise it says how bear when he the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come we've covered this before but i want to cover it again we read that part show you things to come and we think well he's talking about prophecy and future events and he is but that's not all there is to it because it's speaking of the expression of faith by the holy spirit bringing to reality the word of god in the life of the believer amen it's speaking of the point where we speak the word of god and it comes to pass because it says what whatever he hears he'll speak so you've got to hear the holy spirit and you've got to speak what the holy spirit says to you and he says in doing so he'll show you things to come now faith is a revelation of the will of god we speak because we have faith we speak because we have a revelation and then what is it what is the point of him telling us things to come if it never comes to pass that's only half of showing us things to come it's telling us it's coming the second half is that it comes that's the showing things that come part that we want that's what faith does is it doesn't just tell you it's coming but it holds you there and then it brings it amen what do we have we have revelation we have faith and then we have the event this event is as much showing us things to come as the revelation at the beginning it's revealing it to bring you to the place where it is revealed in reality not just in something that's in your head or in your heart and then it's a two-phase showing it's giving you faith to believe followed by receiving or seeing what you believed in in the first place amen like i said before your faith is insight into what god has come in your way if it's the faith of god then you've got a belief in it and that means it's coming your way brother brahm's in the prayer line here and he says lord jesus you said when he the holy ghost is come he'll show you things to come he says i pray you'll heal this woman as i your servant lay hands upon her in the name of your son jesus christ for her healing he says god bless you now go don't doubt have faith and believe with all your heart he's told her what her problem is and that was the sign that god was there and he says that's the holy spirit showing you what's going to happen that you're going to be healed then he prays and now he says no go get your healing the holy spirit has told you what's going to happen now go get it amen he says god has a provided way here tonight not through church not through theology but through the holy spirit will lead you to god's provided way of your sanctification the healing of your body the baptism of the holy spirit to joy peace and everything you have need of jesus christ is god's provided sacrifice and i say that he rose from the dead ascended on high sent back the holy ghost as god's provided way to lead the church he said he will not speak of himself but he'll testify of me jesus said and when he comes he'll bring these things to your memory and will show you things to come for the things that i do shall you do also the world won't see it but you'll see it i'll be with you even in you to the end of the age he says here at louisville my last message to you god's provided sacrifices jesus christ the resurrected one here empowering the church by the holy ghost this is the light walk ye in it find rest to your soul and healing of your diseases amen he says look the holy spirit when he has come he will lead and guide you into all truth and will show you things to come that's the sign of the church today watch where the holy spirits are moving where the holy spirit's moving you'll find love joy peace signs and wonders and the associated god the power of god amongst his people like this will be showing signs and wonders of the resurrection of jesus christ jesus said the things that i do shall you do also and greater than all this will you do for i go to my father and you'll see the things that jesus did will be accompanying that group of people amen the holy spirit's not just here to tell us what's coming he's there to bring it to a reality and that's when we really see it in our eyes with our five senses these different things amen he'll tell us of it we catch a revelation we believe it we act on it and then it happens amen we see it by faith and then we see it by sight because remember he says there's going to be a day where your faith becomes sight why because the holy spirit is leading you into it every single time now i just want to use a couple minutes here before we close i want to talk about the attributes of faith because we're preaching on what is faith so you've got to know what the attributes look like it'll help you know if you've got faith it'll help you know because it has a certain impact on your life amen we know it's a revelation of the will of god we know it can't disagree with the word of god we know that true faith will glorify god and not ourselves amen but we know there's more to it but if you don't get those three things right then the rest of it doesn't make any difference it's got to be in those three channels first brother brahm says we speak of faith we talk of faith but i wonder sometime if we know what we're talking about i wonder if if it isn't hope instead of faith why faith doesn't move no matter how contrary it looks faith stays right there it never moves amen faith is unwavering it stands solidly it holds fast it grips the promise and does not move it has eyes for only one thing and that's the word of god he says now some people can take the word and cut away enough to join the church that's about as far as they get others can cut in cut out every promise of god cut down the promise of the holy ghost cut out divine healing it depends on how strong that hand of faith that's holding that sword you notice he says they can take that sword of faith and cut out the promises of god what is it it's an anti-faith right it's it's an arm of unbelief is what he's talking about a sword of unbelief that'll take all those promises out and say it's not for me or it's not for this age he says every promise is yours it's sharp enough to cut everything that there is around you away and make you a son and a daughter of god free from all but it depends on what kind of a hand that's holding that source sword it must be a hand of faith he said this poor woman might have had many hindrances but our faith didn't have any he's talking about a woman that was healed he says no you may have a lot of hindrances can you say you have a lot of hindrances many times he says maybe your doctor says it can't happen maybe but if you've got faith it don't make any difference what anybody else says your faith doesn't have no hindrance your faith sees it it's the substance of things they've hoped for the evidence of things not seen abraham called the things which were not as though they were because god said so amen that's an amazing thing because god said so he went 24 years and three months before he ever had any idea that it was going to come to pass amen amen faith is not mixed with anything else faith is a unity seed it has only one component and that's a revelation of the will of god that is in alignment with the will of god brother brown puts it this way he says now i've wondered often why he said mustard seed i might drop this thought mustard seed is the smallest among all seeds that's right but there isn't nothing we'll mix with mustard seed it's all mustard you can't mix it with kale or nothing to make it grow it's all mustard now he says if you've got that much faith all faith not mixed up with something else ask what you will it'll be given to you but it can't be wavering it's got to be genuine mustard seed if you know what i'm speaking of so faith is not hybrid is what he's saying you can't hybrid it with everything else let me put it this way faith is not a mixture of practicality and spirituality okay now let me explain that faith is not a mixture of practicality and spirituality because why it's a sovereign revelation of the will of god and that has nothing to do with practicality go look at abraham and see where the practicality was in that there was no practicality in that solution but it had to come by god but let me tell you this the answer may be a combination of practicality and spirituality let me explain that amen you take it at somebody that that has a gallbladder problem amen the problem the thing is that our faith is always in god so the way god answers is up to him that's his sovereignty that does it now god can heal gallbladder disease by a single spontaneous moment like he did for blanca or he can heal it by way of a surgery either way your faith is in god your faith is not in the doctor your faith is not in the preacher your faith is in god so if god uses medicine to heal you or god uses a sovereign act of a medical miracle to heal you that's up to god but your faith is in god you say my finances are in trouble so i'm going to believe god is going to fix my finances and then i'm going to get into what financial planning god might solve your problems with financial planning or he might just give you a promotion and you make more money and you don't have to do any promote any financial planning god chooses the way he's going to answer the answer can be practical the answer can be be emotional it can be all sorts of many things it's up to god to give the answer but your faith has to be in god and god alone and then a psychiatrist is not going to fix you god might use a psychiatrist but the psychiatrist is not where your face should be amen these different things we get into whether it's finances marriages relationships careers these different things it's not the method we have faith in it's the god that we have faith in and he chooses the method to bring the results amen so faith cannot be hybrid with your actions and god's sovereignty amen me plus god does not equal a good result god equals a good result amen god through faith in his word gives us the result that we want i can't add to them and i can't take away from them so why do i try and get myself involved in this situation why i just get tangled up in my own humanity i get in his way and i cause all sorts of problems amen look at the great answers to prayer in the faith and you'll see that most people just believed and acted and walked on they didn't get involved let me tell you about someone who got involved abraham and guess what we're still praying paying the price for abraham's involvement trying to bring the promise of god to pass in his life that said abraham had faith in the promise he believed he was going to get a child and guess what he believed enough to try and get involved sometimes we put him down because he got himself involved but he believed enough to try and get involved he believed that it was going to come one way or the other the problem was he thought it was going to come through him not through the working of god in his and sarah's life amen but he believed god enough to do it so faith has nothing to do with your capability and everything to do with god's power so don't try and add your power to god's amen that's really what we're talking about here it's him and him alone that's going to make these things happen last thing brother brahm says perfect faith is a master of all circumstances perfect faith masters all circumstances no matter what it is it masters it now you just watch when you believe anything do anything and you got faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstance is that doesn't have one thing to do with it see it matters that circum it masters that circumstance if it's in a room of sickness and the lord's revealed that certain thing's going to happen you just speak it and go on show you things to come remember but the ron spencer tells a story how he's it's a saturday night and he's preparing for a sermon on sunday morning and there's a certain uh woman that's in the hospital and she's got her her kidneys are failing and they've given up all hope he says it was about 10 30 in the evening he says and i was just praying he says i just kind of committed her to the lord he says and the holy spirit dropped down and he said go in pray over her and she will walk out of the hospital the next morning okay so he wasn't inclined to go pray for her he committed her to the lord and then he was going to go to sleep but the holy spirit said no you go in there and you tell her you pray over her and say you'll walk out of this hospital a well woman tomorrow morning he walked in he prayed for her he told her that she started rejoicing he walked out and a nurse grabbed him and said what do you think you're doing he said she's green she's got six to 12 hours to live at best he said she said she's dying and you just went and you told her he's gonna live she's gonna live he says i didn't say it he said it thus saith the lord and he walked out she walked out of that hospital the next morning a well woman why because he didn't dwell on what the sickness was he didn't dwell on what the symptoms were but he had the holy spirit telling him to go do it too he would not have presumed unless the holy spirit told him to do it but he said it was clear as day what he was supposed to do and he went and did it and so he could stand in a room of sickness in a room of death itself and say you'll walk out tomorrow well woman and she walked out the next morning completely healed of her kidney problems he says oh does it don't just ask any questions it's already over just keep going see it masters all circumstances well if you do this so and so is going to do that you see it's already got it mastered see faith believes that god will work it out i don't know how he's going to do it but he'll do it anyhow see it masters all circumstances and faith and love is in relation because you can't have faith unless you got love because your faith is in a god who is the very essence of love faith and love works together we read that earlier amen this is such a beautiful thought because it allows us a simple ruler for faith it doesn't ask questions it doesn't dig into the impossibility of it it doesn't apply logic or science to the situation but it simply believes brother branham said that god will work it out you don't have to wonder then you'll have to worry i was on a business call today and and we were supposed to have a bunch of us on the call and in the end only three of us did and one of them is a man that that basically believes that that our country is going to hell in a handbasket and he was saying he was cursing everything i've lost so much money and this and that and the other i'm not even making enough money to pay my bills and i don't even look at my investment statements anymore because i'm losing money hand over fist and he's going on and on and i said i said i won't say his name i said worry kills i said you're going to kill yourself you keep on going like this he's so caught up and he's so worried about what's going on and the market's dropping in the direction the country's going in this cancel culture and woke this and blah blah blah and he's practically killing himself because he's worried about it i don't care i don't really look at my investment statements because i'm trusting i won't ever need them of course we've got a few people here that probably thought the same thing so i'll keep planting the potatoes but in the end i'm not looking to my investments to keep me going through i'm looking to the one who provides every day to keep me going through it man i can't worrying doesn't add to the situation it doesn't help me in any way all it does is make me sicker brother brown how often he'd say you have a nervous problem i was listening to a serious day says how many people have nervous trouble and almost every hand in the building went up why we get sick half the time is because we're nervous we're worrying we're not looking to the promise we're looking to the situation we're looking to the circumstances we're looking to the symptoms brother bram says this and this is our closing our closing quote he says it's just the simplicity of it it's he's talking about faith now faith is the substance he says it's nothing you can work yourself up to so don't work yourself up it's no excitement i notice people come in the line just get to shaking themselves and saying oh god hallelujah amen glory to god he says don't do that you interfere with faith there you interfere with god come up reverently just lay your hand up and believe that's all faith you don't work up yourself up to it he says faith is something that's already in your heart you just come and believe you see what i mean amen even on the flip side i'm reminded i marvel when i listen to a message service and and brother brahm's going and at the end he's going through the prayer line and does he yell to get those demons or sicknesses off of people is he scream and shout does he pound the ground does he run around no what does he do he lays his hand on them and he says satan in the name of jesus christ come out of my brother come out of my sister and he says god bless you brother you're healed god says god bless you your sister you're healed but it wasn't some big show brother brown says we need to get away from this hollywood evangelism he just said you just do it there's a quote i'll bring later where he says faith doesn't try faith just does that's what he's talking about he says you've already got it you're coming up and you're just expressing what you already have you don't come up to get faith you come up because you have faith and all you're doing is in obedience to the word where it says if if you if you have any sick among you come up and the the elders will lay hands on them and the prayer of faith shall save them right all you're doing is coming simply and saying i believe enough to come up and act on it and that's how you know you've got faith as if you'll act on it we'll get into that in the next service lord willing amen but i hope this gives you some clarity on what faith is amen that it's not just about working yourself up into it or you're trying to add something to you or you're trying to do this or that or other but it's simply taking what god has given you and let it letting it have an effect in your life that's all it is it's simple so all you need to do is get the hindrances away and that faith will automatically rise up i i've got a quote in my notes for the next service what brother brahm says you can't you do that he says you can't even stop it from coming forth it'll just come out because there's no hindrance there so that's all we're looking to do amen god bless you let's just stand here the question after this is we know what faith is so it's how do you get faith how do you get your faith to have a greater effect how do you get it to grow in your life and that's what we'll talk a little bit about on sunday amen lord willing amen amen let's just bow our heads heavenly father lord it's a simple sermon a simple service tonight heavenly father lord i think that's the way we need it so many times is we just need to see it in simple clarity of what you've given us lord what you've offered to us and all we have to do is accept it lord and move with it and then just sit back and watch your work heavenly father and lord i pray as we move through this little series on faith lord that we would just simply accept it in our hearts lord that your holy spirit will quicken it in our lives lord that we move aside every sin lord every thought of unbelief lord every skeptical attitude that we might
