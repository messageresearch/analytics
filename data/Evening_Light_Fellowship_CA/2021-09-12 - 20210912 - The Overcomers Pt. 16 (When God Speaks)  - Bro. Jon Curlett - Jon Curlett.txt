he was in he was in ontario and he told me one time he was his wife was talking she's a christian and his wife had run into somebody who was not a christian and uh they got talking about religion and he said he said that the the the unbeliever i guess you'd call him he said that religion was nothing but a crutch and her response to him was uh well look when i break my ankle or break a bone i need a crutch to keep me up and he said that's what my religion does for me it keeps me up it keeps me from falling and i thought that was a pretty good answer amen that's what christ does for us he keeps

will work it out god will work it out one thing i know one thing i found god will work it out god will work it out god will work it out one thing i know one thing i found god will work it out [Music] pushing past the fear fighting to believe he is making ways for me he won't let me down never ever leave he still making ways for me when my heart wavers with doubt feels like faith is running out i've come too far to turn back now i know god will work it out god will work it out one thing i know one thing i found god will work it out and god will work it out god will work it out one thing i know one thing i found god will work it out after a while it looked like martha had a right to upgrade him and say why didn't you come when i called but see that's not the way to approach god don't question know the sound is certain walk right up and say yes lord lord if they lay hands on me how do i know i'm going to get well it's none of your business the only thing for you to do is just know that certain sound that's right that god said so believe it and go on god said so yes sir it's god's word now then first thing you know well little martha come running up there and she said lord oh i like that she toddled and what he was he was her lord lord if thou would have been here my brother would not have died he said even now whatever you ask god god will give it to you nothing uncertain about that no that's when two positives meet when two omnipotents meet she had perfect omnipotent faith in christ and christ was omnipotent she had perfect infinite faith in christ that he was the lord and knowed whatever he asked god god would give it to him amen in other words she said you just speak the word that's all you have to do whatever you ask god god will give it to you that's omnipotent all-powerful because he had just said so see all right and he was all powerful that's when two omnipotent powers meets together it's a contact then when a line here has got 150 volts and this one's got 150 volts when they come together you've got 150 volts both ways see and when you got supreme faith when jesus said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and you got supreme faith in that being the truth you have a supreme god that made a supreme promise and a supreme result will come amen that's it don't question know the sound is certain be still [Music] my soul be still and no leaning take hold in god alone be still my soul be still [Music] in take hold in god alone be still my soul be still and no lean in take hold in god alone god will work it out [Music] god will work it out one thing i know one thing i found god will work it out god will work it out god will work it out one thing i know one thing i found my god will work it out and my god is working now [Music] god is working now one thing i know one thing i found is working now yes my god is working now god is working now one thing i know one thing i found god is working now one thing i know one thing i found one thing i know one thing i found one thing i know one thing i found god is working now amen praise the lord amen trusting that we have that faith that god is not he will he did or will but he is working out amen the prophet god said god works out what he has worked in what he's worked into your life he's now working it out amen by the grace of god so the lord bless us and uh we want to welcome of course the sister rebecca and uh and the children brother onik of course is still in labrador city we pray the grace of god to him there and again also to uh welcome our sister susan power amen it's been uh oh i said i know where she's going to sit i i knew where she was going to be because in the past he said well i've always seen it right here amen so the lord bless our sister susan and we look forward to fellowship with her and she'll be here and i think flying back on the 19th of this 18th of this month so and uh of course philip will remain here for a while amen he's looking after things where he lives so god's grace to brother philip amen and god bless our sister susan amen and again also of course we will welcome our sister uh delfina and her friend ellen so god bless us good to see you again praise the name of the lord the bible says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together and much more as you see the day approaching that's right amen and he put that scripture there highlighting the fact that we would need it more and more in the last days oh yes definitely the world is getting together for this get together for that the assemble for that symbol for that but what about him amen how many are really making the sacrifices to sacrifice together together for him and in his presence amen is giving him the glory is giving him the honors giving him the praise giving him the preeminence amen in our lives morning noon and night consider brothers brothers what he did for you amen he gave he gave us preeminence amen and look what he did to lay down his life for you he suffered for you amen and he picked up that life again and come back just think come back to share it with us amen just thinking he was god he could do anything he wanted to do he could have wiped the whole thing off and as i said it started again which he which he already did he could have done it again because in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth and period amen and there and again like i said jeremiah referred to it and another another reference to it in the bible where god did create this create that but he destroyed it amen because everything was so turned over and given over to the devil he destroyed it all amen and that's why in the end those spirits are loosed out of the out of the river euphrates amen upon the world and brother maybe we're experiencing those things now because i tell you brother sister there's there's you know we don't see or experience much of the moving of the spirit of god over the world oh no but satan is in control as the prophet preached he is the god of this world that's right amen they're not worshiping jesus they're worshiping the devil oh yeah or they're giving free image to the devil sometimes they think they're giving preemies to god but it's the devil oh my lord keep our spirit right our attitude right amen and and check everything with the word amen are we lining up with the word are we doing this according to the word it's just your leadership jesus or is it mine amen or is it the devil amen so i pray the grace of god as christ in our hearts working out amen what he's worked in through his word amen so again again let me remind you that that where is the devil's watchtower is it in our brain in our brains and our knowledge and our reasoning in our feelings and so on but god is in the heart amen and brother we're going by faith the revelation spiritual revelation of the will of god according to the word of god and it's in our hearts amen when i go according to our flesh we're not going according to our just human spirit but the holy spirit and i trust he's in trouble control of you today amen amen that you're you're allowing him to govern your life by the holy ghost amen to the lord bless us and again as i said we welcome my sister delfina and and sister ellen amen and it's australian from tanzania i believe amen so but again according to the grace of god to us that we've been ministering to maybe over 62 countries around the world over many many many years and as i've said when i went to that convention somewhere in the in tucson i think and we met that that uh colored brother and and he tapping on my shoulder and so on oh he said and he knew by the tay where we were from and so on thank you thank you for what you did amen and we we thank god for brother mark's burden to do what he did when it comes to typing typing out three messages in swahili i believe language yeah and that's what that brother tapped me on the shoulder for to thank me for for what the believers in newfoundland did in providing those messages he said that was the first message material we ever had in our language oh i said well praise the lord amen well i believe the lord laid it on our brother mark's heart to do it amen because they they were hungry and thirsting for it and maybe it's through that and other things we've done as they said he said you started over brother in edmonton told me you start you brother and have started over 300 churches in africa alone amen and he said they're still growing well to god be the glory we believe we're nearing the end we believe it'll it'll all soon be over am i trust by grace that we have done what god wants us to do amen in the last days praise the lord so i pray the grace of god to continue blessing what we've done but you let it be for his glory not us but for the glory of god so we'll give the glory to god for what he's done and what he's doing amen pray it's amazing but let it continue on to eternity amen and maybe is like the father of god beyond the curtain of time and the angel pointed that sister to him and she only young but the angel said brother random he said she was 95 years old when you let her to the lord 95 and you couldn't believe it because now she was only about 20 years old or look maybe 20 or 21 years old so like i said our young people is going to be 20 or 21 years old our older folks are going to be 20 or 21. amen as i said the old will be young there forever amen transformed in a moment of time amen by the grace of god and again like i said there's not going to be no no infant of days no no man that did not fulfill these days no no because we're going back to what god wants us to be sons and daughters just young men and women worshipping the lord praise the lord why because old age is a result of sin old ladies is what brought us to that amen it put us down now we grow up into old age but god has god has given us the word to give us the faith amen to go from time to eternity amen to focus not on the old age but on on a new body amen by the grace of god amen so god's blessings upon us and here and again those who are gathered with us online and as i have i was surprised uh to know that our brother ed cater was listening to us online amen i i was actually surprised because again our brother called us there a couple of days ago to let me know that yes he has come back to the lord amen because back years and years ago i've had fellowship with brother ed and of course he is that his brother alan cater you know he was in brother danny's church and of course our brother alex keator and i think he's in nova scotia right now so i'm with a fellowship and of course brother cater and brother catery's father used to have a message broadcast on on the radio oh yeah many years ago and i remember a couple of times once i think it's a couple of times that that he recorded sermons that i made and that was put on the radio and sermons by the manual bridge that was put on the radio so we thank brother brother cater for what he's did amen and being a witness for the message around different land amen to god be the glory amen but we welcome our brother ed cater back to the word back to the message amen and we trust that we'll experience more fellowship with our brother head amen it was a blessing when he called me on the phone but again i've it's only just recently that i've i've been praying for him and uh praying the grace of god in his heart and his soul amen knowing what god has done through him knowing what god did do and so on in newfoundland and the witness that he's given i pray grace to continue with him amen and we didn't know that he did leave the message and went on his own way and so on but again god got a hold of him and brought him back i'm surprised when i when he let me know that he was he was tuned in and listening to us online i said go god bless you brother amen so we don't know really who the lord is dealing with amen well and like i said it was it was surprised when he called to confirm that he was come back to the lord back to the word back to the message amen and of course he's uh he's told me he said well brother i'm not young anymore and he said i'm 72 years old amen so we're about the same age so god bless brother ed cater amen it is absolutely tremendous i i can remember even now when our brother basically first come to the word to the message and i remember sitting in that large church in bishop falls and up there in the middle somewhere with our brother ed cater oh yeah and he was sitting there and he was worshiping the lord amen praise the lord and it came a time as i said when he did walk away from it and but now god has brought him back to god be the glory and also to remember uh of course his wife rosalie and he left me with the understanding that his son timothy wanted to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ so we pray the lord open the way for timothy to be baptized amen so the grace of god be with us and of course to also welcome our brother philip and sister susan back to newfoundland from all the way from the yukon amen from the extreme west to the extreme east amen so god bless her and like i said we remember our fellowship with her for quite a while amen here in the assembly so god and i think the 19th as i said should be flying back so we pray the grace of god be with her amen and again uh i was highlighted by the fact that oh that they're that even there that they were getting us back there years ago they were getting us on online and so on so again we don't know who else is listening to us online i was advised that there's brethren and even in africa and he said right and he said they'll go into a certain place where they have those things where they can view things online and they go in and listen to us online so god bless them amen in africa maybe in india maybe in other parts of the world as well by the grace of god to god be the glory and thinking again of hearing from brother ed and his recommitment to the word to the lord as the lord as what else have we done and what else are we doing i said we'll leave that with you amen eternity will tell it'll be revealed in eternity because our brother ed when the lord was dealing with him he did call his brother alec as i said alec was here for a few months and so brother alex told him to call brother the journal so so we had wonderful fellowship on the on the phone so i pray grace to continue with brother ed sister rosalie and the family amen and the grace of god with our brother again our brother alec in in nova scotia amen the grace of god please let's line up with with the word of god much more much more as you see the day approaching we're going to be there we're going to be more and more interested in fellowship now than we were back then oh yes definitely because we're getting closer and closer to the end of all things so god be with us and god help us and god help us to stay true to the word amen and uh so be in prayer again for those maybe that would be i understand that maybe your brother strides online just destroyed sister linda rather peckford and they're they're online with us so god bless them and also the ellsworths in carmenville and other believers in central newfoundland so god be with us and again our brother doug and sister beverly amen in western newfoundland so the lord god god's grace to us let's keep pressing on please let's stay with the word there's ongoing thirst after righteousness anger when you want the rapture you want the resurrection the song and thirst for it amen you'll get what you want amen and again to remind you that god is waiting on us and they are waiting on us they're just right there waiting on us to come to that faith of the resurrection that faith the rapture and brother they'll come forth into into glorified bodies and and meet with us and we're gonna be changed and meet with the lord jesus praise the lord so god's grace be with us amen as we go into the word we're going to turn it over to our brother uh brother jonathan amen and we thank god for their presence with us amen and our brothers help praise the lord acknowledging him and as an assistant pastor here in the assembly so god bless brother jonathan be in prayer for the going forth of the word and praying the grace of god that it will give to you and to me what it's ordained to do and that is faith faith comes by hearing the word so i trust you're going to hear it in your soul not just your head amen if you've got it in your head you can talk it but not walk it you got it in your soul you can walk it may not be able to talk it that's right amen so i pray grace that we're going to walk it amen not put the emphasis on talking it but for the emphasis on walking it as individuals praise god so we pray the grace of god our brother jonathan comes forth to put the emphasis on talking it amen but god will be there to put it in your heart to walk it amen let's stand and sing only billy all things are possible yes god bless the the other colombo family i don't know if they're still here they might be online but uh welcome my brother joshua pray grace to our brother ellie and maybe uh our sisters maybe come back she's gone back to central okay so god's grace to us all and to all those who are online god bless you sister susan amen glad to have you amen this and of course sister delfina god bless you and sister ellen give the glory please in the name of jesus let's keep focusing on the word and on jesus on god and on the promise of the word amen and the promise that we are looking for now god as i said god has fulfilled all the word for the gentiles and the only thing left now is the resurrection and the rapture so brother let's focus on it and billy only [Music] all things are possible all [Music] all things are possible only jesus is here jesus [Music] all things are possible jesus is here jesus is here jesus is here all things are possible the lord i believe is here lord i believe lord i [Music] believe lord i believe all things [Music] [Applause] [Music] lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible lord or because we are believers amen and lord it's because you called us lord you ordained us to be believers lord it's nothing we've worked up nothing we've called down lord but from the very roots of our lives lord from the very sea that's within us lord we believe because you've called us to believe heavenly father and lord we're standing in your presence this morning lord saying we believe lord we're here to take your word into our lives lord to take it on our lips lord to speak you into our lives lord that you would just have full preeminence lord that your purpose and your will will be achieved in our lives lord god that we'd set aside everything that would easily beset us lord that we would separate ourselves from this word lord and we'd set lord just set ourselves on that absolute on that rock lord lord that our foundation will be your word in all things lord and because of that foundation lord we can stand when everything else is crumbling and failing lord we can stand and trust assuredly lord that we'll make it through to the end so lord we pray your grace to this service this morning lord to the ministry of the word may you touch each one we pray now in jesus christ's name we ask it amen amen thank you musicians that'll be it if you'll turn in the scriptures this morning to ephesians chapter four ephesians chapter four again to echo the welcoming to the different ones that are here or back and then it's good to have each one here including those that are online amen ephesians chapter four familiar verse we've covered it before in one other service but we're going to take it from a different angle this morning ephesians 4 verse 29 says let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace unto the hearers and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake hath forgiven you amen you can have your seats this morning god bless the reading of his word and then we spoke last time on the gifts within the body we covered what a spiritual gift was it was something that could be anointed and used by god for god's purpose and then we cover the goal and the the the effect of those gifts when they're in operation when it's a spiritual gift in operation we know that when it's a carnal gift in operation all it brings is death but when it's a spiritual gift all it brings is life amen the separation is easily seen if it's bringing destruction if it's bringing death that's not god that's satan working but when it's bringing forth life according to the word you know that a spiritual gift is in operation amen and paul said that the the gifts were given to edify that was to build to strengthen up to encourage to bring other people to their place in christ amen and today we want to cover a little bit more on gifts but we want to take it from a different angle and i want to take a title of when god speaks amen when god speaks and last service we close with a very powerful quote that brother branham made and i want to read it again to set the tone for this service and he says now let me tell you something each man that's born again with the spirit of god in him is a miniature creator now that might shake you a little but that's the truth we're in the image of god and god is a creator that's the reason you can believe that god could heal a person is because god is in you and god made this world he just spoke it and his word became material the very ground that you're sitting on is the word of god made manifest if he didn't where does he get it see he just spoke it and it turned into existence he believed in his own word he says now and if a man is born of the spirit of god he is an offspring of god and that part of god is in him and he believes every word that god says will materialize see and so that makes him part of god the holy spirit in the man makes him a part of god amen brother branham takes us right back to genesis 1 and he says look you're standing today literally on the manifested word of god the earth that you're standing on the dirt that you're standing on it wasn't always here in that way but what you're standing on is because he spoke it and out of that speaking there came forth what a reality a manifestation of what he was speaking amen so let's take it back to the scriptures this morning of where brother branham gets us from in genesis 1 1 says in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth he created it amen doesn't mean it was formed from something else but he created it he brought it out of nothing and the earth now after he created it there's a separation of time here between creating the heaven and the earth and verse 2 says and the earth was without form and void that means it was there was something there but it wasn't in order it was in chaos and it lacked those defined features and characteristics that we see today in other words it was a mess the earth was a mess the scripture says and darkness was upon the face of the deep and then it says and the spirit of god moved upon the face of the waters now i want you to catch something here the spirit is moving but it has no effect the spirit is moving but there's nothing happening it's moving over the face of the waters because all of the earth is covered in water but there's nothing happening yet why because the spirit of god has not been given direction on what to move it hasn't been given direction on what to change it hasn't been given direction on how things are supposed to look here so it's moving it's it's hovering over that earth and it's waiting for direction but it can't do anything it can't do anything but then we see in verse three it says and god said let there be light and there was light now you'll notice here we've got the what we've got a full set of colons here don't we god said let there be light and then there's a gap there's a period of time there and we don't know if that was one minute we don't know if that was one second we don't know if that was a million years between the time that he said let there be light and there was light but that is given there because it meant there's a period of time between what he said and what happened but the point is he said it and it happened amen but we don't look at the period of time we look at what he said and then we trust that what he said is going to happen and the scripture follows on it says and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness and then the spirit was hovering and now the spirit is put into action because what god spoke right it gave it direction it gave it purpose and now all of a sudden it says all right now i've got a job to do and it does what it brings forth light amen and darkness was or sorry and god saw the light that it was good and god divided the light from the darkness and god called the light day and the darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day verse 6 says and god said and god said let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters and let it divide the waters from the waters and god made the firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament and it was so so we have and god said and then we have a period of time where it happens and then it says and it was so so while it's happening it wasn't so but it was in the fruits right it was in the par it was in the process of manifesting but it wasn't done until it was so so we have god said then we have it happening and then we have and it was so right god puts the emphasis behind it says all right we've got to finish work here amen and god called the firmament heaven and the evening and the morning were the second day now there is no creative work that's happened here yet aside from light all he's doing is he's separating there's things there that need to be moved into place there's things that have to be put into order in order for him to now put life in there amen but the spirit's just moving and separating things amen so that firmament's there right the water's there but he's now taking it and he's putting the separation between the two so that you've got a land and you've got a water and a place for people to live he says and god said let the waters under the heaven be gathered together into one place and let the dry land appear and it was so so he's moving things into position now he's not creating he's just moving things into position for what he's going to create next right god isn't always creating sometimes he's moving things into position everything he needs is there to support life but he's got to get it in its order in order for that life to be able to sustain once he brings it forth amen god's orchestrating what a place for his creation to exist it says and god called the dry land earth and the gathering together of the waters called he sees and god saw that it was good now brother brown says this he says now it's been in all ages when god first made creation in the phenomenal way when he spoke the world into existence and said and blow the stars and moon off his hands as they say he expressed the word and it came into existence the very earth that you're sitting on today was the created word of god if he didn't speak the word into existence where did he get the material to make it out of where did it come from sure he did he spoke it into existence it's the word of god he says the very dirt and things you're setting on today is the creative word of god amen now that sounds great but watch how he flips this now and he says you're here because you come into creation by the speaking of the word of god every one of you amen he doesn't say don't just look to this earth and say that was created by him it was spoken into existence it was brought in by a supernatural event but he says you're here by the very same process that this world is here today and it is what by the spoken word of god amen but if we look at these first couple of days that are here in genesis where god's working he's doing what he's separating things he's separating light from darkness he's separating land from sea and these different things and he's creating something right he's not a he's not a haphazard god he doesn't just do things to show he's god but he's got a purpose behind it amen and he's starting to show that purpose as he moves in now watch in verse 11. he says and god said let the earth bring forth grass and the herb yielding seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself upon the earth and it was so god said there's a process and then it was so amen if you're stuck in the process thing don't worry right god's moving just trust that if he said it the process will work out to bring it to and it was so it says and the earth brought forth grass god didn't create this everything that he needed was already in there amen the scripture brother jail talked about this before the service in jeremiah in these different places it talks about what a fallen civilization these things were already in the earth to bring forth what was needed to support life and he said let it bring forth he didn't say let there be apple seeds and orange seeds and grass and everything he said no no no let's what's in there come forth and it'll support life it says and the earth brought forth the earth obeyed the spoken word and her building seed after his kind and the tree yielding free fruit who see was in itself after his kind and god saw that it was good and the evening and the morning were in the third day amen he doesn't create anything here he says just let's what's have what's inside of it come out amen amen but this is a part of creation is bringing out what's in something already amen those seeds were there and they were waiting to come forth and they couldn't come forth until the spoken word of god what set a stage where they could survive because they were all under water and then he had to call him forth when he chose to now after he separated the sea in the land they could have come forth at any time the light was there to do it but it wasn't until he spoke and said let him come forth that's when they came forth amen what is it the word seed of god coming forth in its time amen there's a time and a season for it until god comes forth we can't bring a child of god out that's right amen but when god speaks they'll come forth and they'll bring forth fruit amen and then sometimes we look at ourselves and we think i failed yesterday i failed today have i crossed the line between mercy and judgment you know have i spurned the word of god one last time what he's showing here is what's in you has got to come out and it doesn't matter what you do it doesn't matter what you say it's never going to change you from a child of hell into a child of god or a child of god back into a child of hell i mean that's a that's a it's a mental concept it's a world concept that we were one thing and we became another no in god's word it shows us that we always were one thing and if you are a child of hell you will always be a child of hell and if you are a child of god you will always be a child of god i was listening to anointed ones at the end time this morning brother brahms quotes a scripture where he says it will become so close at the end that it will deceive the very elect if it was possible and he says you can't deceive the elect because it's in the roots it's in them to be what they are going to be and so you cannot deceive someone out of being what they are going to be if you're an eagle it doesn't matter how long they tell you you're a chicken or a duck if you keep feeding it then guess what an eagle's going to come out whether they want you to or not and he says it's the same thing you can't be deceived from being a child of god because you are a child of god and all you can produce is what a child of god produces which is what the word right so he says don't be worried about where you're going to end up if you are a child of god you'll always be a child of god amen don't worry about what's going on don't worry about where you fall but rather rest in what that he has called you he has placed you he always meant for you to be a part of him and therefore he'll never lose you he can't lose you amen so what is it you you you can't change yourself from a sinner into a saint amen that's just what that's just us looking at the exterior amen we don't become magically something else but what we have a new birth when that's when the holy ghost comes in that's what the new birth is it's not being baptized it's not repenting the new birth is when you get a new life amen the old life dies a new one comes in and it's only through the holy spirit so it's not sin that's going to separate us from god amen you can't be we're sealed to the day of our redemption but what does sin do then all sin does is it puts a barrier up in your life to break communion with you and god amen so what you you don't lose your salvation but you lose the joy of your salvation right what happens is you lose your peace and something else comes in because what the holy spirit the presence of the holy spirit the feeling of the holy spirit that that anointing that we have on our lives it gets what pulled away from us our soul is sealed but the rest of our body now is left to fight with its own things because what the holy spirit's pulled away right your soul's in no danger but the rest of you has got to fight with what it has and guess what that's never going to be a match for satan so what do you have to do you have to make things right with god in order to let the holy spirit come in and now take preeminence over what your spirit and your outward man amen isaiah 59 and this is speaking to when you have situations in your life and and this was speaking to israel of course and you know they got into situations where they were under slavery and they were conquered and they couldn't worship the same way and these different things and isaiah says this he says behold the lord's hand is not shortened that it cannot save neither his ears heavy that it cannot hear he says don't blame god for when things aren't going well right why he says but your iniquities have separated between you and your god and your sins have hit his face from you that he will not hear amen when things aren't going well take a look at your own life don't say lord what's wrong with you say lord what's wrong with me that something's going on in my life that doesn't seem to belong in the life of a believer amen the new birth closes the gap that we have between god but we still have two-thirds of our body that is unredeemed amen and so you've got that fight day in and day out day out and you notice when jesus said he said you know he went to peter and he wanted to wash his feet and peter said lord don't wash my feet you know don't touch anything i'm not worthy and he said look unless i wash your feet you have no part of me and they said well wash everything then he said no no you don't need that he says you just need to wash your feet why because it's your daily walk when you're out and you're interacting with the world in these different things what happens is you're getting what attacked and satan's throwing dirt and satan's throwing dirt at you to try and see if it'll hold on for a little bit and what did jesus say you got to wash that off on a regular basis say man you got to make sure there's no little clingers on your robe if we can put it that way what is it satan trying to get something on you to cause a separation between you and the holy spirit working in your life amen going back to genesis and god said let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth and it was so this is spoken word this is spoken word god says it now and it comes into that it says and god made two great lights the greater light to rule the day and the lesser light to ruin the night rule the night he made the stars also and god set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness and god saw that it was good and the evening and the morning were the fourth day now i want you to notice something here is that god has just set a calendar in the earth in a time when they are in eternity why because he's looking down through time and he's seeing that we're going to need a time of seasons we're going to need a way to have a calendar because he's going to put things according to that calendar with the jews god is very specific with time they can literally count down to the day to the year certainly when god's going to do something because he deals with him on a very strict calendar so he puts in his creation a way for them to track what he's told them he's going to do before there was ever a need for it what is it he's looking down he's seeing the need he's jehovah jiren amen and he puts here a place and a time for seasons and signs and these different things he's got his whole order there because remember he says what i'll do nothing except i show it to my servants the prophets first but he says he always shows it in the heavens as well so we've got a whole calendar built in from eternity to show us what time and season we're in amen before it was ever needed what is it god said and it was so so that we'd have something to fall back on amen but i want you to catch something here as we've worked through these these first few days so we worked through the first four days and all we have here is god speaking and the spirit moves and it happens right this is spoken word if i could say it this way god was sitting up on his great throne and he's speaking these tremendous words of power and authority and what happens is the holy spirit moves out and it makes it happen but as we step into the fifth day which is grace we start to see something and that's we see god step out of his throne he starts to actually work inside of his creation he starts to come down and the words change even though the english sounds the same if you look in the greek the words change and it starts to talk about god now getting his hands dirty where he starts to take what he's made already and he starts to recombine it and he starts to use the elements of what he's built to make something else and we see this here now in verse 20 it says and god said let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that had life and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven he says let the water bring forth fish in the and and the other the you know the the skies and these different things to bring forth birds but this is not spoken word he says and god created now and you go in the greek and this is a different word this is not just to bring about but this is to form he makes something and if you look at animals they say you can look down and you can see the path of what the cellular structure and how it goes from one to the other to the other there's a whole there's a whole order to all of it and if you consider that it was a divine creator it would make sense that he built things up from things that were amen right and god created great whales and every living creature that moveth which the waters brought forth abundantly after their kind and every wing foul after his kind and god saw that it was good and god blessed them saying be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas and let vowel multiply in the earth and the evening in the morning were the fifth day now notice here he didn't say and god said and it was so it says and god said and then god moves to fulfill his own word now he's got something to work with that he's created by the spoken word and now he comes in he says now i'm going to work with what i have and i'm going to produce what my word said what this is grace this is grace where he takes what he's got and he turns it into something bigger and better amen verse 24 and god said let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thing and beasts of the earth after his kind it says now and it was so but the next one says and god made he's stepping down again he says and god made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and everything that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and god saw that it was good and god said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea to foul the air over the cattle over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and so god created a man in his own image and the image of god created he him male and female created he them and god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth now the word replenish means what repopulate so it means it was populated before amen so what this is the big restart this is the big restart and now it's driven by what now the spoken word if i were to offer an opinion it was only mine that first one he let them go the way they wanted and all it ended up was in destruction he said this isn't going to work i'm going to have to give them a word to hold them i'm going to have to put a part of me in there that's going to hold them to something because otherwise it's just going to continue to go back to destruction time and time again that's just me it's not even thus saith john it's just my idea take it or leave it amen but he says what and god created so he created a man in his own image it says and god bless them and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moved upon the earth amen so god has now personally finished off creation and now he's having a conversation with his creation and we went from what and god said and it was so to and god said and god created and then it was so amen so we have god now working in and amongst his con his creation it says and god said behold i have given you every herb bearing seed which is upon the face of all the earth and every tree in which the fruit of a tree yielding seed to you it shall be for me and to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air into everything that creepeth upon the earth wherein there is life i have given green herbs for meat and it was so amen the original diet was vegan everything ate vegetables and and grasses and whatnot amen but we're in a fallen condition now which is why we must have meat amen praise the lord amen but it says here and god said and then he says i've given you dominion over everything and it was so and he placed man as what ruler over all of the earth and then he puts him in a position of rulership he puts him in a position of power he puts him in a position of authority and he says and god said and he gives it to him and then he says and it was so and that's why we can say adam was what a mini god because god said that that was his position and he steps into it and now he becomes what god on earth right amen amen matt ruled earth as a god now that's a long ways for me to prove to you that the earth you're standing on is the spoken word of god amen but i want you to catch that it comes when when god speaks amen amen that the things that happen that are of spiritual value that are of eternal value that the things that are related to the word of god have to be spoken by god amen when he speaks it is so and that gap of time is where our test of faith is but if god has said it then it will be so and if god didn't say it then it will never be so in the way that it's supposed to be so amen so what was it that brought us from god said and it was so it's always the moving of the spirit it's the holy spirit that is released when god speaks to bring about that which is supposed to be amen so when we speak then what we're going to release some sort of spirit to go and do what we're going to ask amen and let me ask you is there only one spirit in all of this world or is there more than one because when you speak there's a spirit that's going to be released and you've got to make sure that you're speaking to release the holy spirit rather than speaking to allow satan into your life amen we'll get into that a little bit better amen what is it the word spoken releases the holy spirit to bring it to reality amen having set a foundation let's move on back to ephesians 4 now it says let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to the use of edifying amen everything we talk about when it comes to being in a body is that you must be edifying you have to be building up you have to be strengthening you have to be encouraging it is not a tearing down process god does the tearing down we do the building up if i could put it that way it's not that god doesn't build up but our purpose is to what is to grow it's to help other people to achieve what they're supposed to be in the body of christ it says but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may minister grace unto the hearers and the amplified says let no foul or polluting language nor evil word nor unwholesome or worthless talk ever come out of your mouth but only such speech as is good and beneficial to the spiritual progress of others as is fitting to the need and the occasion let me put it this way you can say something that you think is good and beneficial but if it is not actually to the time and season it's supposed to be spoken it's not going to have the right effect you've got to say the right thing at the right time scripture says a word fitly spoken is like apples of gold and pitchers of silver it's a beautiful thing amen but it is fitting to the need and occasion that it may be a blessing and give grace which is god's favor to those who hear it amen that's a mouthful pardon the pun amen paul says you don't let anything cross your mouth that contains this sort of thing nothing it says ever don't let it ever cross your mouth amen paul's just talked about setting the gifts in position he's talked about finding your place in the body and then he comes down and he finishes this this chapter with what words come out of your mouth amen because what we've just read what happens when god speaks but we've already recognized our position and we know that we are a part of god we are an attribute of god we are a piece of god if we have the holy spirit in us so when we speak what can we expect to happen if god said and it was so then when you speak it's going to be so as well but you got to make sure that you're speaking the right thing when you do it amen why because we see from the very beginning that the word spoken has created power and then so when you speak then expect something to go forth and happen amen and if you speak through the holy spirit then it will be creative because only god can create but if you speak and you're under another influence then it's going to be destructive because satan can only warp and manipulate and kill what god has already done amen satan tries to twist it and god tries to what grow it into what it's supposed to be amen brother bram says this he says i'm talking about an absolute remember we spoke about you have to get connected to christ and then he'll fit you into a body right and sometimes what we have is we have people trying to connect to the body and they're not connected to christ and that won't work i mean that's just somebody trying to put something on you know we don't and the thing is the world does that these days you can have just about anything you want added to your body you know and and it's a freaky thing but this is where we're getting at is people say well i just want to be a part of the body and they latch on and guess what they're not what they're supposed to be and the body rejects it and they rot and fall away the brother baby says this i'm talking about an absolute connected with christ he says then it makes you an odd person if you're an odd person you're not connected to christ you're odd because you're odd not because you're connected to christ okay but we laugh but how many people and we've all run across them where they're weird because they're weird and they've taken the message that god has given us and they've turned it into something that's so weird that they're of no value to anybody else you don't have to be that weird amen he says what get connected to christ and then you'll be odd and that means you'll be different you won't be common at all you'll do odd things now let me stop again you'll be odd and you'll do odd things even if you're not connected to christ but you take the word and you try and act on it because the world is what it is and it's never going to line up with the word of god but again the problem is not to do things that are odd the problem is to do things that are odd because you're connected to christ amen he says your thinking is all together different than the thinking you once did if your thinking has always been the same you haven't had the new birth because you have found something that you've anchored a faith in someone that created the heavens and the earth that his very word itself is creative a god who spoke the world into existence and there's nothing too hard for him you look at this world and then you say but he can't do what i want him to do you're standing on a living breathing organism if you want to put it that way that has sustained life for thousands and thousands of years and then you say but he can't do the little thing that i'm asking him to do in my life what's he saying he's saying there's nothing god can't do look at what it did the first time and how great that was and then look at your own life and say is that really compared to the creation of the worlds by spoken word amen he says there's nothing too hard for him so it makes you creative yourself because you take his word and a word is a thought expressed he says and people act funny they seem to just forget about the negative side because they have found an absolute because it's the word of god jesus said heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall never fail so if we've got the word of promise then there's no failing it to it it cannot fail and then you speak from the absolute in your position and in your in your your your situation and if that absolute can get focused on something other than the word of god then you're going to start to have problems but if you can hold your absolute to what the word says then you can trust that god said and it was so is going to happen in your life amen but he says here remember they seem to just forget about the negative side what when they've taken on a new way of thinking why because they've got the mind of christ now that's pointing them to the word rather than looking at the situation and when you start looking at the negative what happens is you start looking at the symptoms rather than the healing amen you start looking at the conflict rather than the resolution and the restoration and all of a sudden satan's got something to step into your life with and all of a sudden the holy spirit is nowhere to be found because you open the door for satan to do whatever he wants in your life amen and all of a sudden you're looking at where you failed last rather than what god has said you're going to be victorious over amen but catch the mind of god here and watch what happens brother braham says now if the blood of bulls and goats could give a power to moses to go out there by the commission of god and stretch forth that rod and say let there come flies he had the word of god and he spoke that word and when he did it become from god's thought amen he says a word is a thought expressed so when god thought it and put it in moses mind and he spoke it it became a word capital w now moses didn't think it god thought it god sends it to his prophet puts it in his mind to say it and then he speaks it and that becomes the word of god and moses turned around and went back maybe not a fly in the country in an hour from them maybe one old green fly began to buzz around in half an hour there was 10 pounds per square yard what was it the creative word of god that was spoken by the lips of a mortal man why because it was not spoken by his stuff but he caught the thought of god and it became what a word on his lip and a word is a thought expressed and when the word goes forth god said it and it was so amen when god says it into you and you speak it through your lips it will be so it has to be so amen now you've got to be careful with this because look at elisha elisha comes from his experience with getting what the road from elijah he's got a double portion he strikes the water he walks back across the river on dry land goes and performs a miracle and then he's walking and a bunch of kids come out and they start making fun of him and they say go up now bald head they're making fun of hud what he had just witnessed he just saw elijah take a rapture and these kids come out and they start making fun of him and he's got a double portion of the anointing and look at what he does he says and he turned back and looked on them and cursed them in the name of the lord and there came forth two she-bears out of the wood and tore 42 children of them what happened was he used his prophetic authority to bring judgment amen and that was not god as best i can tell right what is it you just move on you just move on and we see that with christ at the end he says what forgive them for they know what not what they do those kids had no idea who they were messing with they probably had parents that had talked funny about him in all probability you know and it had come down on them and they decided to go out and tease the man amen and what happened is what elisha overreacted before the sons of thunder were elisha was right and what oh lord we're going to call down and he called down the thunder didn't he and two bears came out and destroyed 42 children because he overreacted why because god backs up his prophets whether you like it or not moses had the same thing and it kept him out of the promised land didn't it he what he would not refuse his prophet's word now you and i aren't prophets amen we have a different position to take and god won't honor us the same way amen but you are the bride of christ right and the bride of christ has what she has the name of jesus attached to her she is a part of him she is a she is attached to him amen and when you speak negative things guess what there's authority behind the words that you speak that's why paul's saying don't do it is because there's authority when you speak and when you do somebody's going to obey somebody's going to come forward and they're going to live in those words amen if you don't speak the word the word can't go into action and if the word isn't going to get into action then what is there's only one other influence that can go into action that's satanic power every single time amen the minute you do that the minute you speak something negative into the situation you give satan an open door to come in and rob you of everything that you've worked so hard to build up to this point amen this is in the the church ages here he says i wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst let me give you a thought here how do we pray we pray in jesus name don't we every prayer is in his name or there isn't any answer yet in first john 5 14 we are told this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us and if we know that he hears us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions we desired of him now we ask he says what is the will of god there is only one way to know his will and that is by the word of god lamentations 3 37 says who is he that sayeth and it cometh to pass when the lord commandeth it not he says there it is if it isn't in the word you can't have it you can't have it from god amen but the scripture talks to us that what we ask and miss and what we receive what we've asked for and it isn't god that's giving it to you it's satan that's giving it to you because you haven't gone with the word you've gone with your own desires you've gone with your own thoughts and what you've done is you've actually anointed satan to work in your life now because you're not speaking according to the word of god satan is more than happy to give you anything you want from his kingdom and if you if you speak it you'll get it and you'll see it in all of these you know uh the the prosperity gospel people and everything satan's more than happy to give you all the money in the world if he can keep you from from expressing the word of god right he'll give you wealth he'll give you fame he'll give you a fortune he'll give you influence he'll give you all of these things and it has nothing to do with god all it is is you're worshiping satan in the in the temple of god and you don't realize it you've opened it up because you don't go according to the word you've gone according to your own flesh he says here so we can't ask unless it's in the word and we can't petition or ask unless it is in his name there it is jesus the name is the word the will you can't separate god in the word they are one listen if my wife goes to the bank and says give me all the money in the accounts what are they going to say do you want it in 50s or 100s they're not going to say no who are you what right do you have to this why because she is mrs jonathan corlett and she has a card that identifies it and she has an access pin that gives her a right to empty those bank accounts any time she wants she has full authority to use the money in our bank accounts anytime she wants including withdrawing every single penny of it amen why she speaks in my name i have added her as a joint account holder on all of my accounts and so when she comes in there and she wants something from them they have to do it as if it was me speaking there amen but the word of god remember we read that quote the other day where brother brahms said if the sons of god could speak a world into existence and go live on it if there wasn't a law controlling those things why because we're not allowed to go we've got to stay here god's got a purpose and a plan for us amen so i trust my wife not to go in and empty our bank accounts and do what she wants with it but why is that because she has the mind of john right she has a vision she has a purpose she knows what she's supposed to do with it and that's what she does with it and it's no different with god what he's given us the word of god that gives us access to what every divine right that he's given us as a child of god as a bride of jesus christ and so we have the availability for that but we have to go in and our access point is what a pin which is the word right the word is the pin that we enter every time we don't just go in and claim all of these different things but we go in with the word and that unlocks the promise in our life for every one of us amen so what paul is warning us is he's saying look you've got gifts and you're supposed to be edifying to the body and your words are going to have authority and power if you're a child of god so be careful of what you say here brother braham says this he says what happens when two omnipotents meet when god and man comes together two omnipotents something's got to shake now an omnipotent is anything something that's able to do anything now i understand omnipotent when we speak of god but he says two omnipotents and then he says man when god and man meet something has got to shake and where's he coming from he's taking us back to genesis 1 where it says what that dominion was given us to rule over the earth right and so he's saying he's what when you step back into that position that restored position that eating condition now you're omnipotent on this earth you have the power by the word to do whatever needs to happen in the situation amen he says something's got to shake whatsoever you'd say with that creative power of the omnipotence of god knowing that he's promised it and he said it in his word catch that he's promised it and he said it in his word you didn't make it up it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that is not not just brings things into subjection but it will literally go out and create what you need for the situation it'll go out and create the solution to what you have going on in your life it'll what take out of nothing and bring the something that's going to make all the difference in your life amen he says it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that it is not it makes them as though they are because two omnipotents have met he says there he stands isn't he wonderful two omnipotents met but we are a part of him he is not a part of us and if i can put it that way what all the glory all the praise all of all of the deserving goes to him amen we don't lift up ourselves but we give it to him amen but watch it when we get under another influence amen if we get out from under the influence of the word if we start to selectively pick and choose the word because that says satanic is not not sticking with it at all is when you pick and choose to suit your idea and suit your life and suit what you want to happen that's when the demons get in amen it's that so that's what satan did in the first thing he just got her off of one word didn't he he got her off the one word that made all the difference and it brought us into this place of destruction that we're in why because as much as faith is created doubt and fear are destructive amen so the minute you start to speak negatively then what happens is you allow satan in to do what start tearing down what god has spent so much time building up amen what you say is what will be what you say is what will be but remember you've got two powers waiting there and you're either anointing one to go or you're anointing the other one to go and so that's why he says when two omnipotents meet if you said if he said it in his word and he promised it in his word that's what you want to speak don't make up things on your own and don't speak into the situation in a way that the word doesn't give you authority to do it amen amen if what you're saying is that your brother or sister is going to keep failing where they're failing guess what that brother sister is going to keep failing if only in your eyes amen if your spouse is a disappointment and all you can do is dwell on the disappointment of your spouse guess what in your eyes they will continue to disappoint and sometimes what god's waiting on is your attitude to shift and your prayer to shift to where instead of speaking the way you are you start to speak what the word says that they are supposed to be and it opens up access now to what get your attitude out of the way so that god can move completely on their their end of things amen sometimes it's our attitude that's blocking somebody else from getting the very thing that we need amen job three says for the thing which i greatly feared has come upon me and that which i was afraid of is come unto me i was not in safety neither had i rest neither was i quiet yet trouble came what the thing that he was dwelling on came to pass why because what did you do you opened up a door hey man we dwell on calamity we dwell on problems we see something coming down the road and we say oh boy this is going to be bad this is not going to be good we're going to have a big situation oh my goodness and what are we doing we're opening the door to satan and his demons and we're saying come on in boys here's the door to my rest here's the door to my piece here's the door to my joy here's the joy here's a door to my victory go in there and destroy whatever you think you can destroy today because i'm going to sit here and worry about what's going to happen down the road all we're doing is giving satan an open door when we start confessing what it's going to be rather than looking to the word and saying victory is mine amen victory is mine joy is mine love is mine is that song we sing so often is amen what is it when we look at the situation then what happens is we're opening the door for satan to keep working in that situation remember when we look to the word and we say lord we're trusting you now then all of a sudden the holy spirit is what released to do exactly what the word says is going to happen amen so watch who you're listening to right watch what you're feeding on because that's going to determine how you respond your absolute is what you're feeding on day by day so if you're in an unvindicated source then get out of it because an unvindicated source is going to have unvindicated results amen you've only got to sit under the word to get word results you don't have to add anything and you definitely can't take anything away from it amen the world doesn't have answers for us if i can put it that way if you want world results do things the world way amen if you want world results do things the world does it and you'll get world results and you the thing is you don't even have to have discernment about what's going to happen because you just look at the world and see how it's gone for them and that's what you can expect in your life and then whether it's our finances whether it's our families whether it's our relationships whether it's how we run a church it doesn't matter go look at the world and if you want to take anything from the world you'll get world results every time but if you can go to the word and do the harder work because the world is all about quick and easy and mental this and and this and that and the other thing the word is the longing it's a long game it's not immediate results necessarily but if you stick with it it holds amen it'll come to its fruit in its time and season but the world is all about getting you there quickly and it never lasts amen listen brother brahm says satan never received the holy ghost he ain't got nothing then to give you faith so if you're repeating words from satan's eden it's not going to be full of faith amen amen in other words it won't be faithful to the word of god and it can only produce one thing and that's doubt which leads to destruction and death okay satan never received the holy ghost so he ain't got nothing then to give you faith it's god that's got the faith and just as if you're filled with god you're filled with faith if you're the son of god you're like god he just speaks the word and it creates itself amen like i said if we can take on that mind of christ who thought it not robbery what being in the form of god to be equal with god right that's the mind of christ is to say lord you have put me into this position and so i'm going to speak in that position right i'm going to say you put me here i didn't put myself but on the basis that you put me here now i'm going to speak into the situation we saw it with joshua amen we preached on this many months ago where what he's standing there and he's got a work to do and the enemy's getting away and they've had a great victory but it's not a final victory and he says moon stay here son stay here why because he's in the line of duty he's doing what god asked him to do and so he pulls all that he needs from god and god obeys it right then and there it'll never happen again in that way the scripture says but for one day god gave him exactly what he needed to finish the job and he finished the job why and god said and it was so and anything you needed in the middle of that he give you amen anything you need according to the word he'll give it to you to resolve the situations that are in your life amen verse 28 and ephesians 4 says and grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby you are sealed into the day of redemption i love this here where paul says don't grieve it but you can't get rid of it right you're sealed to the day of your redemption but he says don't grieve it don't let something get between you and that holy spirit to the point that satan has a an opening in your armor that there's a there that's opened up because you grieved him out of your life what you didn't lose your salvation but what you lost was what the effect of that holy spirit that's moving in your life and how do you grieve it what do you do is you deny the word of god and that is reflected in your words and your actions right and when you put something else ahead of the word of god now the holy spirit has nothing to work on and all of a sudden satan's got the opening that he needs so the question then is whose thought are you speaking who's thought are we speaking in our conversations whose thought are we speaking even in our thoughts if i can put it that way because guess what they'll drop a thought in and sometimes it's the holy spirit and you want to do what meditate on it that means think on it dwell on it but don't let it be a thought from satan because if you dwell on it and meditate on it it's going to bear a fruit as well and it'll be destructive in your life amen what you've got to be careful that what you say doesn't grieve the holy spirit out of your life and it doesn't have an effect on those that are around you it's supposed to be edifying amen he says let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice now the amplified says lit all bitterness and indignation indignation's a big one can you believe what they said to me can you believe what they did to me do you believe the gall that they had wrath passion rage bad temper and resentment anger animosity and quarreling brawling clamor contention and slander evil speaking abusive or blasphemous language be banished from you and with all malice and spite ill will or baseness of any kind we can speak the truth without bitterness we've all got a reason to be bitter if we want to choose a reason you know we've all been wronged we've all literally done things where we did nothing and somebody just absolutely came in and destroyed us in some way and we have a right to be bitter what we got something we didn't deserve and that's usually what bitterness is surrounded by amen but we should be able to speak of a difficult situation without being slanderous towards the other person amen i've said it before we ought to be able to speak the truth without taking somebody's christianity away from them and then we ought to be able to go into a situation amen as christ did in his dying breath said father forgive them for they know not what they do if he can do that based on what he had just went through right his body was completely wrecked and he's sitting up there as the last drops of blood drain out from his body and says father forgive them for they know not what they do why are we talking the way we talk sometimes what did have we suffered as badly as christ that we would somehow not have to have the attitude that he had did we get so far beaten up did we get so far destroyed did our character get so besmirched by what somebody said that we can't say father forgive them the way he did right paul said you've not been you haven't been you know you haven't even been killed you haven't been killed with what they did so what are you talking about guess what christ was killed he was killed that's how bad it was for him we don't get killed we just get our feelings hurt and we treat it as if we're getting killed what is it you to let what the words that come out in those situations be what to the edifying of the hearer and not to destroy them even further amen because why what happens is we go from stating the facts if we let satan's get in there then we go from facts to what assigning intent to the person when sometimes there was nothing there and how many times do you have a situation with someone where you go in the situation happens and you come out of that and you say they did that because of this this and this and then you come around and you finally make it make up and you you say i'm sorry and hey sometimes it's with your spouse let's make it easy sometimes with your spells you have a fight with your spouse and you're back in your room and you're stewing and she said this because and you go back and you talk to her and and you apologize you say honey you know i'm sorry i shouldn't have snapped at you and she says i'm so sorry and then she says i just had this on my mind and when you said that it it caused me to react that way and you're sitting there and you've assigned 43 different demons to your wife because she spoke to you the wrong way and all she had was one little thing and you triggered it right what and you've just completely destroyed your wife's christianity while you're in your room stewing and it had nothing to do with anything with you you just stepped on a land mine that you didn't know existed right and it's not your fault and it's not her fault it was just there right what we need to be careful how we respond and not to assign intent to somebody's mistakes sometimes we're ignorant because we're ignorant you don't know what you don't know right you can't be bigger than you are you can't say you know the scripture says what man by taking thought of it can add a cubit to a stature you can't grow a foot by thinking about it right you got to have an experience to back up what you're talking about and sometimes what happens is people hurt you because they're speaking without experience right and you've got to give grace to that person to grow and you back away and what you do you go into your prayer closet brother bram says you go in and pray until god gives you an understanding of why they did it and then you can come out and you can pray for them because you see an issue there that needs to be resolved rather than the oh they did this to me it's like oh satan's got a foothold there there's some growth that needs to happen and now you can take them to the throne of god in prayer rather than sit there and say god smite them amen has anybody ever prayed the god smite them prayer no okay not after this service sorry 32. i missed it i didn't put in my notes i'm sorry it says and be kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as god for christ's sake hath forgiven you amen can you say your words are dosed with these things rather than poison and malice can you say that it's tenderhearted and forgiving one to another god help us amen why he says it why why do we do that he says why do you have to do it he says why because even as god for christ's sake have forgiven you what freely you have received freely give amen let it be a reflection of his grace to you that the words you say are the same as the ones he would say and has said and has said to each and every one of us time and time and time again amen his mercies are new every morning right he doesn't hold us again hold it against us he doesn't come up and wake us up with thunder and lightning every morning you know based on what we've done or what we didn't do what is it his mercies are new every morning it should be the same for us one to the other brother brown says and i've noticed that a lot of times i'd say things that i couldn't hardly think myself but i'd say it anyhow he's speaking about the supernatural now and i come to find out it did happen just that way i'd say things i didn't hardly didn't mean for it to happen that way but it did anyhow because i had said it catch that he says i didn't even hardly mean it that way what it was was he had something inside of him that was wanting to come out and until he spoke it he didn't even realize what it was that was lurking in there to come out but what was it it was the word of god sitting there he says but i did anyhow because i said it and i thought wait a minute so i said you see when we speak anything if something is anchored to us we shouldn't never speak it till we believe it then when we believe it we speak it and that creative word goes out it's a part of god see and it created brother branson branham's pointing us back to the original creative work of god and he says look you've got the same thing because you're the word and you're believing the word and that leads to speaking the word and therefore as god spoke the word that came to pass so you should speak and expect it to pass amen brother gerald read this the last service i have my notes completely done and i went back and i added this in because it was a tremendous scripture this was in second corinthians it says we having what the same spirit of faith according as it is written i believed and therefore have i spoken he's pointing back to genesis amen what what was it god believed his word and he spoke it it says we also believe and therefore speak what the spirit that drives our confession is what one of faith faith in what the word of god faith in the word of god will what bring it to pass every time amen but faith is what drives us to speak it is not doubt it is not fear it is not disappointment what is it faith faith faith what i believe and therefore i speak amen amen the same life the same word the same situation the same results will follow it what out of nothing comes something that's what the word does out of nothing comes something out of a completely hopeless situation comes what life resolution appreciation acceptance right when you think it can look look at brother ed cater brother ed sorry to pick on you 72 years old and you come back to the lord is anything too hard for the lord right what i told brother gerald after that i said what a what a faith it ought to give to those of us that are looking to people that are serving anything other than the lord these days and then if he can bring someone back at 72 he can bring him back at 32 42 52 62 72 all the way at least up to 95. after 96 there's no hope amen what is it the spirit of faith the holy spirit moving to perform that which was spoken so when we speak what are we speaking what do we speak about our spouses and then do we build them up listen you have to have hard conversations with your spouses sometimes but if you're constantly tearing them down either to them or to others guess what they'll always be down in your eyes it doesn't matter if they grow in the lord you're still not going to see it because you're speaking what a negative thought into your mind and that gives satan the the right the right to operate and keep that in front of you and blind your eyes to what god's actually doing in that person's life amen when we speak to our children how do we speak is it constantly what correction because we're supposed to correct but are we correcting with them with with an intent of what building up and then with growing them and confirming to them that they're doing well in these different things and then if all we if all that comes out is correction correction correction and there's no love with that correction then what are we going to do we're going to destroy them amen when we look at our jobs when we look at our finances when we look at our health what does our conversation look like is it negative meaning not according to the word of god or is it positive meaning that it is what based on the promises of god rather than the symptoms of the situation amen when we look at brothers and sisters in this church listen we've all got flesh attached to us amen and i can sit here and brother josh can focus on all the flesh that's on me all day long and guess what he'll never get a thing out of my preaching if he's focused on that but he doesn't do that why because he's got in him that's looking to the god of me and he's focused on that and that's what we've got to do with each and every one of us is we've got to pray for the parts that aren't of god and we've got to what look to it connect the things that are of god in that person he meant because each one of us only has a part of god and each one of us only has a portion in this body nobody is all things to all men right paul paul said i try to be all things dull men but we can't do that and then we got to be what we are we've got to try and attach in the way that we do and if i expect a brother or sister to be something that they're not i'm going to be severely disappointed but if i can look to the god that is within them to the portion the expression the attribute of god that's in them now all of a sudden we've got something to fellowship on don't we amen if we're writing people off if we're writing situations off then it means that we're not looking at the word we're not looking at the god that changed us and that can change them in the exact same way amen amen god help us to speak by what inspiration of the holy spirit rather than the unholy spirit if i could put it that way amen but we talked initially there about that that creation process and god speaking and the holy spirit was sitting there and it was just resting on the earth and it was just moving over there but nothing was happening but as soon as god spoke that holy spirit moved and we saw that it was not creative initially aside from that light amen it was not created but rather it was moving to cause separation it was what a refining process of what was already there it was this holy spirit moving to draw out the things that were already in existence but to put them in their place and put them in their position and set them up to support life amen and that's the very same way that we were we were born chaotic we were born out of alignment with the word of god we were born unconnected to the word and then what happened was god released the holy spirit to do what move over us and draw us out and separate us and then after separation what comes out is the life that's within us amen and what's he doing is he's pulling out the portion of him that he had planted in the beginning amen he's drawing out an original word that was there from before the foundation of the world and then he's drawing it back from eternity and he's taking those things and he's pulling it and bringing it into life now and he's saying now is your time and now is your season and then we had a time and a season it was in the the seventh church age other people were born the first second third why that was their place and their time to do it but the holy spirit moving on us now has brought us to life we are not here by chance we were not born by chance we're not born in the families we were born by chance amen but it was god orchestrating it to bring us out in the land that we needed to be born in and the place where you need to be born in and the situations we needed to be born in to what caused the life that was within us to come forth amen and with those things come gifts and then you you know we talked about the apple seed did not magically become a pear tree when it grew up no an apple seed grew into an apple tree and bore apples and so within us we have the same thing we have the word within us and we have a portion and an attribute of god and that's a gift inside of us and that gift has to be expressed and it's a creation gift it's something that we have whether or not we ever realize it whether or not we're serving the lord right now or not serving the lord that gift is always there but if we can submit it to him now it becomes a spiritual gift amen but it's a creation gift you have it no matter what and brother brown says this now here's the last quotation video he says listen friends listen all look this way you have those gifts you didn't deserve them god gave them to you before the foundation of the world they are yours when you was born in this world you were born with them he quotes the scripture to timothy he says stir up that gift that is within you see you're born with these things you can't make yourself do some things i couldn't make my eyes brown because they're blue who taking thought can add one cubit to his stature it's all in god's divine program if i tried to be a sankey or a finney what good would it do me see god had a sankey and a finney i'm william branham you're whoever you are she says don't try and mimic somebody else don't try and be somebody else don't try and have their gift or say that's what i want to be he says no it doesn't matter he says i would like to be like finney or sankey maybe but god already made them so he doesn't need me to be them because he's got them so he said i'm going to be me and you be you and let god work in you the way that he's created you to be amen elvis never got the holy ghost and so his singing though it was a creation gift never had a spiritual effect because why he never surrendered it to god amen it doesn't matter you know with elvis it's it doesn't mean that he missed his calling but rather he missed an opportunity when you look at elvis life you see this man was not a child of god he wasn't a child of god his choices reflect that clearly he never got the holy ghost right every child of god's got to have the holy ghost before they go amen we believe that in terms of a member of the bride of christ if we could do that his choices showed a clear deviation from the word so what he missed though was an opportunity because remember salvation is to whosoever will right and if he surrendered his gift and he could dedicate his life to christ then what he'd have an opportunity at salvation even if he never got the holy ghost but he chose not to even do that and so i have no doubt and brother ram says he he knows where elvis is today and he's in the flames of hell right if we want to put it that way he's in isolation right he's he's in nothingness as we know these different things but what happens is he had a gift he had a creation gift inside of him and those that was his regardless of whether he gave it to god he has it in his life and each one of us has a gift inside of us at least one gift inside of us that can be used for god in this world amen so elvis was potentially an asset and he never gave it over he did a few gospel songs of course but his life's work was not to do what god wanted him to do or what god could have used him for rather he gave it over to himself and he died overweight drugged out on a toilet you know what an end what an end you see you know if god never comes out of your life if i can put it this way god never comes out of your life god was never in your life that's what we're talking about we're talking about a seed amen you can't change what you are amen but what he's done is he's given the opportunity to people to do what surrender amen surrender as best they can they were never a child of god but he says that you get the opportunity for eternal life and it's through service and through dedication that's the only thing that's going to get you there amen brother bram says this i saw visions for 40-something years and never has it failed i saw visions when i was a sinner why it was a gift the first vision i ever remember my mama told of me speaking it to her when i wasn't quite two years old why gifts and callings are without repentance you're born that way the traits in you just like you're born with blue eyes or black eyes or brown eyes or whatever it's something god has done and that's the only way it can correctly be it has to come from god not something you made it's what god has ordained to be then it's of god if you're just bluffing to make it up your hand it'll be wrong see amen just as the earth brought forth seeds and each seed brought forth of its kind so does god within our lives amen our life has to bring out what god has placed within us john 6 39 says and this is the father's will which has sent me that of all which he had given me i should lose nothing but should raise it up again in the last day now we look at that scripture and we think he's talking about souls right and he is talking about souls he's talking about people here amen but remember we're not just children of god we are attributes of god and we've got a gift and we've got an expression a manifestation of god that's unique to each and every one of us and jesus doesn't say here that i will lose nobody he says i will lose nothing no thing what he's saying every gift every attribute not just your soul he's not going to lose but every expression of him is going to be manifested on this earth before we go in that rapture amen there is nothing that he has planted that won't come to life before he takes us off of this earth amen he won't lose a single thing that he planted because why it was the word and god said and it is so amen the principle then is that god created and then he sends his spirit to refine it's the same god and the same spirit and that spirit is refining the elements that god built into your life amen amen so what happened when malachi 4 came to restore all things because what remember something's got to be spoken before things can come out right so malachi comes and it's not just doctrines and truths and faiths but what it was opening up the seals to read to us out of the title deed i mean it was opening that word back to us and inside that title deep was every promise every attribute every manifestation of god that he had ordained for his children on this earth amen so what happens when malachi 4 comes names start getting called out gifts start getting called out ministries start getting called out people start getting placed into their positions because why the word has spoken god has spoken and it has to come to the place where it is so amen so that's what happened here is we have a restoration and because god won't show anything unless he shows it to his servants the prophets that prophet comes and he speaks to us and he says you are the bride of christ and we're like say what me i'm the bride of christ yeah you're the bride of christ and he's what he's preaching a message that draws people out of the denominations which is what he never judges the denominations in that sense he says the people in him but rather they'd gone back to what sitting under men and it was men's ideas and a headquarters and all these different things and there was no there was no freedom there was no sovereignty to the local churches and they tied themselves to a man's idea men's doctrines and they couldn't move and he had to call them out of there so that what the holy spirit could start moving again because when they got into the denominations they kicked him out of the church right when you read in revelation 3 it says yeah i stand at the door and knock he's outside he wasn't in there so he had to call them out so he could start working with them and sit down and fellowship with them amen and so he started calling those names out and when god speaks it has to be so so those people started coming out those attributes started calling out amen and they start to come out and they start to grow and all of a sudden you've got a separate bride a group that's been called out right the church is what the called out ones right they're separated they're called out and now what what god spoke to a prophet is coming to manifestation in its fullness in this age amen like i said before manifestation happens god always speaks and we had a prophet come and say that all that god was he poured into christ and that's where everybody stops if they can even get that far but he says all that christ was he poured into the church and so what you've got a manifestation of the fullness of god in a multi-member body which is the bride of jesus christ amen and then malachi 4 like i said he came and started talking to a bride that didn't even know who she was didn't even know she was a bride right didn't even know she was she was a supernatural uh embodiment of christ in this age had no idea was just what dead in doctrines and dogmas and they started speaking and out of it came what a life amen amen the thing is this my boss doesn't hold me accountable for what he thinks he holds me accountable for what he says right and if he doesn't say it then i'm not expected to bring it forth right i'm not expected to do something that he thinks i'm expected to do what he says or what he writes down and god's no different with us amen we don't have to sit here and and worry about what god's thinking but not telling us but it's what he tells us and what he has told us that we need to worry about amen and so the word is what a thought written right that's what he put down for us to read to live by to understand by these different things and that's what he's going to hold us accountable to do amen and god expects us to ask to act based on the words which is this thought expressed that says thought expressed that's what we have and that is our absolute is the word of god it is not 1200 messages from a prophet that is not our absolute he pointed us back to a restoration of the word of god amen and if he said something that i don't understand or that i can't line up with the word of god what do i do i lay it aside it may be me that's off could have been him that's off it doesn't really matter to me but until i can understand and see it through the word i leave it alone why because the word is the absolute not what the prophet said in 1200 messages amen amen so what are we asked to do we're asked to act and speak on the word of god amen act based on the holy spirit quickening that word i mean there's a quickening power that comes with the holy spirit when it moves on us and we can respond to it amen and that's great that's great when we all are in our place isn't it when we're all in our place and doing things exactly and we're not stepping on each other's toes and running around and bumping into people that are you know in a fine balancing act with what they're doing amen but what happens is we get out of place sometimes we get ahead of ourselves or we start dragging behind right and then if you're not feeding yourself at home during the week and you come into the service and you're trusting the song leader trusting the minister to come here and get you all the way up to speed right what are you doing you're holding back the church aren't you because if everybody comes in ready to go but you're not ready to go then guess what the the weakest link is you and that's what's going to break the chain you're the one that's going to get frustrated because the preacher's taking too long because the song leader didn't sing the songs you said because one of the musicians made a mistake and they ought to know better and why aren't they practicing and adapted that to death all of a sudden you've ruined the spirit in the entire service because 99 of us are where we need to be and one percent is not what you can hold back an entire service based on what you're feeding on throughout the week amen but the other thing is when we all come in and every one of us wants to be something and paul addresses us he says in first corinthians how is it then brethren remember we're talking about gifts and we're talking about being in your place and being moved by the spirit he says how is it then brethren when you come together every one of you has a psalm has a doctrine has a tongue has a revelation has an interpretation let all things be done undead defined so paul's saying them in order here and he says everyone coming into the service wanting to do something is not the holy spirit right that's people seeking attention amen verse 33 says for god is not the author of confusion but a peace as in all churches of the saints let all things be done decently and in order have you ever noticed we never have all of the sisters and brothers that sing specials come in on one service and say i've got a special because why we take up the en we'd be here an hour wouldn't we why because the holy spirit's moving on them individually at different times to bring something to the church and what it would do is by the time the minister got up we'd be tired out from singing what it's not the holy spirit moving to cause everyone that can sing to come in and sing a special in one service right so and and he said the same thing everyone has a psalm everyone has a doctrine a tongue a revelation interpretation everybody in the church was saying i've got this gift and i'm going to come into church and i'm going to share it and everybody needs to hear my gift and paul says no no no that's chaos and confusion and that he says god is not the author of that there shouldn't be a clash of gifts in the church right because you're sitting there and you're so busy and we don't have it in this church by god's grace so i'm pointing generically you're sitting there and you're saying i wish she'd shut up so i can get up and sing my song i wish that brother would stop his testimony because he's taken too long and i'm sitting here and i need to get up there and sing my song right or this or that or the other thing or maybe the preacher's saying i wish they'd stop singing so i could get out there and preach it's full circle nobody gets out from under this right what is it if you go there if we ever get to the point where we're clamoring to be the one up here in whatever form or fashion that's where the problem comes in and if you want to look at the manifestation of this scripture in our lives it is that if every time i show up to church it's so that i can publicly operate my gift it isn't the holy spirit let me put it this way don't just show up to church to operate your gift amen it has to be done to edify and guess what if somebody's singing i can't be preaching and if i'm preaching somebody can't be speaking in tongues why because it causes a conflict each has to be in their order in their time and in their season even within the body even within the service amen why because we are a body and a body that only operates one thing all the time is weak right if i went to the gym and all i did was strengthen my right arm doing bicep curls all day long what would happen i'd get this huge massive right arm and the rest of me would look like a wimp wouldn't it and that's what happens when you get into a church where you only have one or two or three people doing all the heavy lifting is you get a deformed body because you're only using those gifts in those particular areas and so you're very strong in that area and when you need somebody that's in those areas that's a great church to be but in the rest of the ways they fall down because why you're only operating a few of the gifts you're only letting a few of the people express the word in their life for the edification of the body amen now somebody would say to me or brother joe and say well you're a minister you're supposed to operate your gift every service am i scripture says there's a five-fold ministry and if we've only got two of us here we need another two or three for sure right so if i'm saying no i've got to be up here all the time brother jail can't get up here brother joe's saying brother jonathan can't get up here we never have a visiting minister or anything what is it what we're doing is we're saying i'm insisting on using my gift all the time and that's not the holy spirit amen why because he's ordained a different he's ordained a multi-member ministry to handle those situations amen so every one of these things it can't always be me me me i i i right amen usually what happens when we get into those situations is a presumption of a gift rather than a true gift or more importantly it's not yielded to the holy spirit because it's what it's self-seeking and it's self-elevating rather than to the edification of others amen and the minute we start doing that or we start focusing on just a select few we get out of balance balance is a multi-member body all actively working that's when we're all doing it you talk to anybody that likes to to strengthen themselves go to the gym and that and they say you've got to work every part of your body you know there's the joke about the guys that skipped leg days and what they have is this massive upper body and these tiny little legs underneath it's because all they focus on is their upper body they're not a balanced person their body isn't balanced amen amen we've gotta what don't try and be something you're not i think more importantly don't try and be something at all and then just relax let god move let god work in your life and then let him draw it out and then let him speak into your life let him be the one that pulls these things out that tells you all right now's the time to come to life and sometimes it's going to be something you never had an idea of in the first place sometimes gonna be something that you had no clue about like i said i would never have thought i'd be ministering behind a pulpit right would never have chosen it but yet here i stand amen i guarantee you there's plenty of people in the christian walk have ended up in places that they never thought they'd do they they'd end up because why god pulled something out of them that they didn't realize was there and sometimes he hides that gift because it's such a tremendous gift that if he were to have it out in the open the whole time satan would have too much opportunity to go in there and destroy it right he keeps it hidden then he pulls it out at that last second you kind of have this quick short work if you will where it just comes comes to life in a few quick months and all of a sudden boom that that man's out there preaching or you know that that sister starts singing and it just hits the mark at the right point in these different things amen and if you aren't sure what you're supposed to be doing help somebody that does get your shoulder to the wheel behind somebody else man if you don't know where your place is if you don't know where your gift is help somebody else do it and then make sure that their life is a little bit easier amen brother as we start to close here he says oh how that we need in this journey that we're in now to find a place of rest and to feast on the word of god so that it'll give us strength night after night go to the room and rest and come back the next morning fresh and eat more for there's a great journey and a great battle ahead for the church he says i believe we have been children long enough god's going to turn his church into manhood now and we played and frolicked as children fun and games always fun no responsibility he says no no no we played and frolicked his children but now we're going to have to put away childish things and take on manhood maturity i believe it was paul who said when i was a child i spake as a child because he thought as a child but it's time we begin to think like men and women now for we've got to get down to business amen god bless you if the musicians would come this morning amen we've been preaching on and god said i want you to think about what you've been saying in the last little while and say has god been speaking when i've been looking at situations when i've been looking at my family when i've been looking at my job when i've been looking at my health when i've been looking at the future when i've been looking at the past what is it that i've been speaking what is it that i've been thinking because what you've been thinking about what you've been dwelling on whatever you've been meditating on that's what's going to start coming out of your mouth eventually amen but i want you to think about that and say lord have you been speaking into my life or have i been letting something else speak into it and then i don't want you to look at anyone else just stop and think about that as we stand together and we're going to pray i want you to think about the words that you've been saying have they been edified have they been growing other people up into christ or have they been tearing down and then have we been destroying people's character we've been destroying our spouses have we been destroying our children have we been looking at a negative through a negative lens in the things that are going on in our life or has god been speaking and are we giving it an opportunity to be so amen because whatever you speak is what's going to be amen god's looking for a word of faith he's not looking for a word of doubt amen perfect love casts out all fear amen so if there's fear there then i guarantee you there's an influence that hasn't been the holy spirit amen and then let's just stand together if we would and then we want to let the holy spirit come in and start speaking through our lips amen and it's going to start in your mind before it ever starts in your mouth and then if i can put it that way and what's in your mind is what you're feeding on it's what you're dwelling on what you take in is what's going to come out of him and we want to feed the holy spirit inside of us let's bow our heads lord jesus lord yet another day and your word challenges us to come a little higher lord to take on that very mind of christ lord that surrenders itself first and foremost and lord and in surrendering finds itself in the position that you placed it lord in a place of authority in a place of power lord but not just to do what we would want but to do it according to your word heavenly father and lord you see each life here you see each family lord you see each person that's dealing with things in their lives lord god and lord so often what happens is we start to dwell on the negative lord as your prophet said but lord we want to dwell on what your word says we want to look to the promise lord we want to speak what you have spoken lord so that we can have the same results that it was so lord we pray that you would just touch each heart and soul here lord lord as they will reflect lord help them to reflect on themselves lord let us each be honest on where we've been speaking from in our lives lord where we've spoken in faith or may our faith just grow and continue that it will be lord and where we've spoken in doubt or fear or disappointment lord may your love just come in and wash it out lord may forgiveness rise up lord mercy and grace take its place we pray heavenly father lord touch your people we ask now in jesus christ's name amen amen it is no secret what god can do 175 i believe just
