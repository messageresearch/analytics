[36:58] amen good to be here again this evening
[37:01] I have quite a few announcements to make
[37:02] here so just bear with me so uh as it
[37:06] being the new year you end up having
[37:08] lots of contact with different people
[37:10] from around the country and around the
[37:12] globe and so I have greetings to bring
[37:14] from Brother Steve Fulkerson brother
[37:16] John Andes brother Dwayne Fair brother
[37:20] Ed hammermeister brother Steve clar
[37:22] Brother David Nash so they all send
[37:24] special greetings and most of you don't
[37:26] know brother Vitali but Joe he said to
[37:29] say hello to you and God bless you he he
[37:32] remembered you and I said he's my best
[37:34] friend I think and and he goes to goes
[37:36] to this church now so he said oh I never
[37:38] knew where he was from so he I talked to
[37:41] him for for about 45 minutes earlier
[37:44] this week so he said to say that to you
[37:45] and greet the church as well he like me
[37:47] he uh he uh he's just a relatively young
[37:50] Pastor he's got a church of about 50
[37:52] people over there in Lithuania I believe
[37:55] so he asked me to to pass on greetings
[37:57] there as well so God bless you from each
[37:59] of them and then I had a complete
[38:01] stranger reach out to me that brother
[38:02] Dwayne far had given me giving my
[38:05] contact information to him and this is
[38:06] Brother Edmund um Hagman from Pei so
[38:09] he's a missionary and uh focuses on
[38:12] India mostly but they moved him and uh
[38:15] his his son and a few other families
[38:17] moved to Pi to do grain farming and
[38:19] sheep farming so he's got a thousand
[38:21] acres there and he's got a little church
[38:22] there of looked like maybe 15 people and
[38:25] the Lord brought some East Indian people
[38:27] over to Pei to to talk or to to to stay
[38:30] there and so he's got just a little
[38:32] Church of mature people he said we just
[38:34] baptized two new converts uh last week
[38:36] and whatnot so he wants to have some
[38:38] fellowship so we may bring him over here
[38:41] he invited me to come over and speak for
[38:42] them at some point if we could work it
[38:44] out so I just say praise the Lord we've
[38:46] got another another Minister here in the
[38:48] local area and uh well spoken of and has
[38:51] a heart for the Lord just a simple
[38:53] brother seems like very sincere so you
[38:55] never know what we might have coming our
[38:57] way so praise the Lord for that amen and
[38:59] then I spoke with brother Andrew Dodd
[39:01] who's uh one of the associate ministers
[39:02] with brother Ed hammermeister there in
[39:04] Edmonton and he's confirmed meetings
[39:06] with us on February 23rd through the
[39:08] 25th so it'll be typical Friday night
[39:11] Saturday night Sunday morning but he's
[39:13] uh he's booking his ticket shortly for
[39:15] that and the deacons will send out the
[39:16] announcement for that so we want to
[39:18] certainly remember um remember that in
[39:20] prayer and trust the Lord to lead him in
[39:23] those things I also want to thank the
[39:25] officers of the church we'll have a vot
[39:26] obviously on Sunday and uh for those of
[39:29] you that don't make it thank you for for
[39:31] for helping all this while and for those
[39:32] that do get voted in then God bless you
[39:35] and we'll continue to serve I'm sure
[39:36] we'll all get in but I do sincerely
[39:38] appreciate the work that each one of you
[39:40] has done and and your sincerity and your
[39:42] your commitment and um you know I think
[39:45] it was brother Dale said he didn't know
[39:46] how much work went into managing and
[39:48] helping out a church until he became a
[39:49] trustee and you don't understand until
[39:51] you do it whether it's in the music
[39:54] whether it's in the trustees the
[39:55] finances the deacons whatever it is
[39:57] until you do it you don't understand the
[39:59] the stress that can come with it and the
[40:01] time commitment and the energy that it
[40:02] can drain from you and it's a blessing
[40:05] it's a blessing to do it but it's work I
[40:07] think anything that's a blessing is is
[40:08] work as well so thank you each one and
[40:10] brother Dale is not going to be serving
[40:12] us officially he'll still be working
[40:14] just as hard I think just in a little
[40:15] bit different capacity but God bless you
[40:17] brother Dale for that especially and uh
[40:20] and each one amen and then a prayer
[40:22] request so Blanca's mother has been
[40:24] diagnosed with lupus and so we just want
[40:26] to put that as a prayer request before
[40:28] the church she's just had a few small
[40:30] symptoms so far and and uh we're
[40:33] trusting God Amen we're trusting God to
[40:35] just touch her and and uh he can heal it
[40:38] he can make it go away he can make it
[40:40] something she can live with he can do
[40:42] all these things amen but we believe
[40:43] that he's a Healer there's no scripture
[40:45] that says that uh it'll stay the same
[40:48] there's no scripture that says that you
[40:50] know you just have to live with things
[40:51] amen but we've got an overcoming God
[40:53] we've got a healing God we've got a
[40:54] great physici and so we we want to
[40:56] remember her in prayer as well amen God
[40:59] bless you this is uh this is my New
[41:01] Year's service or my New Year's sermon
[41:03] if we wanted to put it that way it it
[41:05] fits in line with what we've been
[41:06] studying but just to give you a fair
[41:08] warning that you know we're we're going
[41:10] to be talking about potential and the
[41:11] thing about potential is you can't talk
[41:13] about potential unless you you get the
[41:16] people to recognize that there's room
[41:17] for growth and there's growth to be had
[41:20] amen you don't want to dwell on the what
[41:21] you don't have but you don't want to
[41:22] dwell also on only on what's coming up
[41:24] you got to put the two together so
[41:26] that's a bit of what we're going to do a
[41:27] bit this evening but I want to start in
[41:29] Daniel
[41:30] 11:32 and this is a wonderful scripture
[41:32] for the believer it says and such as do
[41:34] wickedly against the Covenant shall he
[41:36] corrupt by flatteries but the people
[41:38] that do know their God shall be strong
[41:41] and do exploits amen let's turn to
[41:43] Ephesians chapter 3 as well Ephesians 3
[41:46] and verse
[41:49] 16 and it says that he would Grant you
[41:52] according to the riches of his glory to
[41:55] be strengthened with with might by his
[41:57] spirit in the Inner Man amen it'll be
[42:00] expressed outwardly but it won't be
[42:02] visible what happens is an internal work
[42:05] not an external work it says that Christ
[42:07] May dwell in your hearts by faith and
[42:10] they that ye being rooted and grounded
[42:12] in love may be able to comprehend now we
[42:16] think of that word comprehend as
[42:18] understand when you comprehend something
[42:19] you understand it but that word
[42:21] comprehend means to lay hold of to
[42:23] attain to obtain to make one own so that
[42:27] you may be able to lay hold of that you
[42:29] may be able to attain that you may be
[42:31] able to make your own with all the
[42:33] saints it's not just for you and it's
[42:35] not just for me but it's for all of us
[42:37] what is the breadth what is the length
[42:39] what is the depth and what is the height
[42:42] and to know the love of Christ which
[42:44] passeth knowledge that ye might be
[42:46] filled with all the fullness of God Amen
[42:49] God bless you you can have your seats
[42:51] this evening and as I mentioned we're
[42:53] this is my New Year service if we want
[42:55] to put it that way but it is in the
[42:56] channel of this this uh this S Series
[42:59] we've been doing on manifesting time and
[43:00] I want to speak tonight on a glimpse of
[43:03] potential and there's a lot in here that
[43:04] I've kind of just had sitting in the
[43:06] background for a while and and just
[43:08] wanting to to kind of bring it into one
[43:10] one simple message here like we have
[43:12] this evening and you know it's it's the
[43:14] new year and before uh the New Year's
[43:17] kind of came up I spent a lot of time
[43:18] thinking about what's happened in this
[43:20] past year and certainly a lot has
[43:22] happened for me personally and and
[43:24] spiritually and also what's been
[43:25] happening in the local body here and you
[43:28] know as I was writing out the Christmas
[43:29] cards for each of you it it was a
[43:31] wonderful time because I really got to
[43:32] sit and think about what each of you
[43:34] brings to the church you know it's a
[43:37] funny thing when we speak about the body
[43:39] you'll never see Christ talking about
[43:41] what you don't have but you he'll talk
[43:43] about what you do have because every one
[43:45] of us has a place in the local body and
[43:47] we bring something to the local body so
[43:50] what brother Mark has that I don't have
[43:52] that's not a that's not something that's
[43:53] wrong about me but that's why brother
[43:55] Mark is needed is because he has
[43:57] something I don't have and sister Amber
[43:59] might have something that sister Blanca
[44:00] doesn't have and vice versa but we don't
[44:02] focus on the fact that Blanca doesn't
[44:04] have this or sister Amber doesn't have
[44:05] that but we focus on what each one
[44:07] brings because that's the need for the
[44:08] body as we bring together what each one
[44:10] has and we compensate for what the other
[44:12] one doesn't have so as I was dwelling on
[44:15] those things you know it was a wonderful
[44:16] thing and it really you know just
[44:18] reinforced to me how much I appreciate
[44:20] this congregation and the the people we
[44:22] have and the gifts that we have and it's
[44:24] it's not just enough to have people in
[44:25] the seat it's not just have enough to
[44:27] have gifts but it takes people that are
[44:28] willing to put those gifts to work and
[44:31] to put their energy and their their
[44:32] shoulder to the wheel in these different
[44:34] things you know and and I was thinking
[44:36] on that the world twists up so many good
[44:38] things and I think diversity is one of
[44:40] the things they've twisted up most in
[44:42] recent times because I look around the
[44:43] church and I see so much diversity and
[44:46] it's not just the color of our skin and
[44:48] it's not just you know where we come
[44:49] from or the difference in families or
[44:51] jobs or education or these things but
[44:53] the world focuses on diversity for the
[44:55] sake of just bringing those things in
[44:57] and not recognizing why the need is
[44:59] actually there and so they force
[45:01] something that ought to be happening
[45:02] naturally because you understand the
[45:03] strengths of what are there rather than
[45:05] anything else you know but I look around
[45:08] this church and we're not supposed to be
[45:10] carbon copies of one another and as a
[45:12] pastor I'll never force you to be the
[45:13] way I am amen there's supposed to be a
[45:16] Unity of the spirit under the word and
[45:18] we'll get into that in a little bit amen
[45:20] but we have different ways of worshiping
[45:22] we have different ways of responding to
[45:24] the word of God we have different ways
[45:26] of of dealing with each other and
[45:28] expressing ourselves and some of us are
[45:30] great talkers and some of us are great
[45:31] listeners and some of us have a balance
[45:34] there and you know some of us bring
[45:35] constant enthusiasm and energy and as I
[45:37] say these things names are going to and
[45:39] faces are going to come to your mind
[45:41] because we know who those people are and
[45:43] we got people that are that are great at
[45:45] talking and we know that when we have
[45:46] newcomers come in that's the person
[45:48] that's going to go make them feel
[45:50] welcome and then we got ones that'll sit
[45:52] there quietly but in a in in a time when
[45:54] there's a need that not a person often
[45:56] times that'll come in and they'll
[45:57] empathize with you and they know the
[45:59] right words to say and they don't talk
[46:01] much but when they talk it's really
[46:02] worth listening to and neither one is
[46:04] better than the other but they're needed
[46:06] at different times and for different
[46:07] situations and these things you know
[46:10] some say a lot and some some don't some
[46:13] are very very responsive in the service
[46:15] and some aren't that doesn't matter amen
[46:18] what matters is that you're here with
[46:19] purpose and intention you know and we've
[46:22] got musicians and we've got singers and
[46:23] song leaders and teachers and cleaners
[46:26] helps and it's a wonderful thing because
[46:28] this is the holy spirit adding to the
[46:29] church such as are needed and we've only
[46:32] got a small church here you know but
[46:33] we've got every need supplied anden we
[46:36] may not have every want supplied but we
[46:38] have every need supplied we have a
[46:40] Ministry we have song leaders two of
[46:43] them we have we have a musician that
[46:45] plays a piano we've got two guitar
[46:47] players we've got multiple deacons we've
[46:49] got multiple trustees we've got people
[46:51] that have a heart to serve and our bases
[46:54] are covered and I praise the Lord for
[46:56] that I think it's a wonderful thing that
[46:57] after all these years after 43 years
[46:59] we've still got people here and we're
[47:01] not just fading away but we're growing
[47:03] and and the spirit of the Lord is there
[47:05] to to bring forward a Next Generation to
[47:08] help fill these gaps in in these
[47:09] different things so I don't worry about
[47:11] the small size you know we're less than
[47:13] 50 maybe 55 that support this ministry
[47:15] around the island but it's only going to
[47:17] be a small group that goes anyways and
[47:19] I'm not talking about church size I'm
[47:21] talking about the bride globally brother
[47:23] B talked about one in a million and if
[47:25] you do one in a million then 8,000 of us
[47:27] are going to go and that's it if we look
[47:28] at the world population today amen but I
[47:31] said it before and I don't know if you
[47:33] remember I was here for special meetings
[47:34] one time and I said there's more power
[47:36] in this little group than we realize and
[47:39] I'm going to talk to you a bit about
[47:41] that this evening because the potential
[47:43] for a group of any believers of any size
[47:47] in the unity of the spirit is greater
[47:48] than anything we've ever understood and
[47:51] you get glimpses of it and we're going
[47:53] to talk a bit about a glimpse into the
[47:54] potential of a a body of Believers amen
[47:56] but it's not just Unity of people
[47:58] because they had that at the Tower of
[48:00] Babel amen it's not just Unity of people
[48:02] but it's Unity of people under the
[48:04] unction of the Holy Spirit under the
[48:06] word of God that makes us a powerful
[48:09] group Amen brother we put it this way he
[48:12] says but we get so sour down on theology
[48:14] till we don't know nothing about the
[48:17] spirit that's a cold formal
[48:20] church amen we need solid teaching we
[48:22] need foundational understanding but
[48:24] that's not all there is to the Christian
[48:26] walk and that's not all there is to
[48:27] church services he says now I hope you
[48:29] love me after this we're talking about
[48:31] potential and that means you got to
[48:33] understand there's room to grow he says
[48:35] but that's what it is I mean Pentecost
[48:37] too that's right just shouting and
[48:38] dancing around doesn't mean you know
[48:41] anything about the spirit he says it's
[48:43] personal contact face to face that's
[48:46] what you need that's the kind of church
[48:49] that God's fixing to raise up that's
[48:51] right when they come together and in
[48:53] unity and Power in the spirit amen so
[48:57] he's not just talking about us coming
[48:59] together to church amen but we need that
[49:01] and I know I've said it many times and
[49:03] maybe you're getting sick of it now
[49:05] because you're sitting here and it
[49:06] doesn't apply to you but the scripture
[49:08] warns us not to forsake the assembling
[49:10] of ourselves together all the more as
[49:13] you see the day approaching you know why
[49:14] it said that because people will stop
[49:17] because people aren't going to think
[49:18] it's important amen and there's no
[49:21] substitute for being in a church service
[49:23] I don't care if you've got you know I
[49:25] think the best live stream we've got in
[49:27] the message is brother Chad lambs and
[49:28] they've got the lighting right they've
[49:30] got the audio right and they've got the
[49:31] cameras right but there is nothing to
[49:33] replace being in a church service and me
[49:36] there's nothing to replace the
[49:38] face-to-face contact that he's talking
[49:40] about you know and I was talking to some
[49:42] brothers after service on Sunday and I
[49:44] didn't tell anybody about this but I
[49:46] hadn't been feeling well before the
[49:48] service and I was stuck in the bathroom
[49:49] from quite some time that's why I got to
[49:51] the pulpit late and by the end I just
[49:53] said Lord I'm here to preach
[49:56] I'm here at my post of Duty and I'm not
[49:59] feeling like it but I'm here to preach
[50:01] so I said Lord help me to preach and I
[50:03] walked out of there and I came up on
[50:05] this pulpit and it didn't bother me at
[50:06] all and it hasn't bothered me since now
[50:09] the way I started and the way I finished
[50:11] were two very different things but in
[50:12] the midst of that was me committing to
[50:14] my post of Duty they're depending on me
[50:18] and I'm depending on the Lord so he's
[50:20] got to move amen there's something
[50:22] that's supposed to happen in these
[50:23] things amen but you've got a post of
[50:26] Duty too and your post of Duty in some
[50:29] of you it's to to lead songs and some of
[50:31] you of you it's to play but it's no less
[50:33] a post of Duty to come here and hear the
[50:35] preaching of the word to pull on the
[50:37] word of God to worship God to be in
[50:41] service to show whose side you're on
[50:44] Amen I was listening to to the I've been
[50:46] listening to the message why are people
[50:47] so tossed
[50:49] about and I I want to say this and and I
[50:51] hope you'll understand this in the way
[50:53] that I mean it because if you look
[50:55] around so often we're having less and
[50:57] less people make it to service in this
[50:58] own building we've had more people miss
[51:01] church in the last year I think than
[51:02] we've had since Co now that hasn't been
[51:04] a lot of time but I I notice it because
[51:06] I'm up here and so I want to read you a
[51:09] quote here but before I do that have you
[51:11] ever noticed how brother Bob is always
[51:13] here sister Morin is always here brother
[51:16] Matt is always here brother Vel is
[51:20] always here why is it because they know
[51:23] they've got a post of Duty
[51:26] they know they have to be here because
[51:28] people are depending on them but see
[51:30] what happens is as a congregation we can
[51:32] forget that we have a post of Duty that
[51:35] is no less important than those people
[51:37] that are here amen you think that sister
[51:40] Morin doesn't feel sick occasionally
[51:42] brother Bob that your voice isn't the
[51:44] greatest you wake up and maybe it's a
[51:45] bit HSE but he still comes and he leads
[51:47] songs amen listen to what brother
[51:50] Branham said this is him why are people
[51:53] so tossed about now so this is is going
[51:55] to help us not be tossed about he says
[51:57] and it's not just me out there in the
[52:00] service the prophet of the hour the
[52:02] seventh Church age messenger the star
[52:04] for the leoan church he says and it's
[52:06] not just me out there he said I have
[52:09] such a little part to do with
[52:13] it well who plays the big part he says
[52:17] it's you back there the congregation he
[52:21] says plays the biggest part to what
[52:23] happens in a service
[52:27] amen so I'm not here to to break you
[52:31] down this
[52:32] evening but you know one of the brothers
[52:34] said he said when we were talking after
[52:37] service on Sunday he said I've come to
[52:38] the church sick many times and as soon
[52:41] as my hand touches that door to go into
[52:43] the sanctuary or I go into the sanctuary
[52:45] I don't feel sick anymore I feel good
[52:48] enough to get up and do what I came here
[52:49] to do and so I'm not saying that I'm not
[52:52] trying to beat you down I'm saying we're
[52:54] talking about potential and the
[52:56] potential is that this is not just a
[52:59] house of hearing the word of God but
[53:00] this is a house of healing this is a
[53:02] House of Deliverance this is a house
[53:04] where you can get a testimony that isn't
[53:06] God took care of the sickness after 3
[53:08] days but God took care of the sickness
[53:10] when I went and I went to my post of
[53:12] Duty
[53:14] amen I'm saying that Satan's maybe been
[53:17] bluffing us out of a blessing and
[53:19] there's potential now for us to come
[53:21] back to that amen the scripture says if
[53:23] any is sick let him all the elders and
[53:27] let them anoint them with oil and the
[53:29] prayer of faith shall save the sick
[53:31] that's available here that's available
[53:33] at your home that's available wherever
[53:36] amen but don't let being sick always
[53:38] keep us out sometimes we are so sick we
[53:40] ought not to go I get it but sometimes
[53:43] it can be the smallest thing and we say
[53:46] I'm just not feeling it and we stay home
[53:48] amen I'm reminded in of sister Justine
[53:50] you know a few weeks ago and she came
[53:53] back with her father and she was prayed
[53:55] for because she had a migraine before
[53:57] service and she was in so much pain that
[54:00] tears were streaming down her face with
[54:02] her eyes fully shut she was in so much
[54:05] pain she couldn't even look at anything
[54:06] and she sat there for almost 2 hours
[54:10] with her eyes screwed shot tears
[54:12] streaming down her
[54:14] face she didn't need to be here in that
[54:17] condition anybody would have said sister
[54:19] Justine you can go home it's too much
[54:22] but you know what sister Justine did she
[54:25] drew a line in the
[54:26] sand and she said I'm here to tell Satan
[54:30] whose side I'm
[54:33] on I'm here to say I'm reading my name
[54:37] out of the scripture that says by his
[54:38] stripes I am healed I'm here to take my
[54:42] benefit from the time that he took at
[54:44] that whipping post and after 2 hours she
[54:47] was completely delivered from migraines
[54:49] that she'd been suffering for for 11
[54:52] years sometimes we let him walk all over
[54:54] our Terr territory and all we need to do
[54:57] isay draw a line in the sand and say no
[54:59] more you have to leave
[55:03] amen if God's A Healer let him be a
[55:05] Healer if God is greater than Satan let
[55:07] him be let him be that amen if we want a
[55:10] testimony we've got to go through the
[55:11] test amen if we just want to be like
[55:14] everyone else then we'll be like
[55:15] everyone else but if we want God to do
[55:17] something greater we've got to give him
[55:18] the opportunity to do something greater
[55:20] in our lives now I looked up that word
[55:22] potential it means what is possible or
[55:25] achievable having or showing the
[55:28] capacity to become or to develop into
[55:30] something in the future now brother
[55:32] brandham at the end of his ministry it's
[55:34] on December 5th in in
[55:36] 1965 and at the end of it he preached a
[55:39] message called things that are to be and
[55:42] after all the signs and wonders after
[55:44] all the theology after all of the
[55:46] preaching he would say this simple
[55:48] phrase he would say these things that
[55:51] are now are only potential calling for
[55:54] things that are to
[55:57] be everything that he'd seen and what
[56:00] would happen is he would talk about what
[56:02] is preparing us to go over because what
[56:05] we have here is only a taste it's only a
[56:07] portion it's only a little bit of what
[56:09] we're going to have but he says
[56:11] everything here is to prepare you for
[56:13] what's coming and that means that we
[56:14] can't stay where we are today there's
[56:17] supposed to be gradual growth there's
[56:19] supposed to be maturing they're supposed
[56:20] to be changing he's saying there's more
[56:22] to be had than what we've had doesn't
[56:25] matter how long we've been serving the
[56:27] lord doesn't matter how long we believe
[56:28] this message doesn't matter how great
[56:30] the Ministries we've been under it
[56:32] doesn't matter there's always more
[56:34] that's supposed to be out there amen and
[56:36] it's to prepare us for eternity because
[56:38] we're going to be very naturally
[56:40] inclined towards eternity when we get
[56:42] there this world is not our home we're
[56:44] pilgrims and strangers and everything
[56:46] that God's doing is preparing us to get
[56:48] out of here not to stay here and so
[56:51] often we focus on the blessings of God
[56:53] that make life comfortable here rather
[56:55] than the ones that make us ready to go
[56:57] over there amen you know there's a
[56:59] multi-billion dollar industry that's
[57:01] focused on bringing people to their
[57:03] potential and you know you think about
[57:05] these things and we have educational
[57:07] institutions we have government programs
[57:09] we've got commercial products we've got
[57:11] trainers and teachers and mentors and
[57:13] all of these things and they're all
[57:14] focused on telling us how to get to our
[57:17] potential they're trying to make us the
[57:19] best that that we can be and Everywhere
[57:20] You Go someone's trying to sell you a
[57:22] product or a service to make you
[57:24] skinnier to make you stronger to get
[57:25] make you smarter to make you more
[57:27] employable to make you look better to
[57:29] make you feel better
[57:31] whatever now they're not in it for you
[57:34] they're in it for themselves they're in
[57:35] it to make money they're in it to gain
[57:37] for themselves but the lie that every
[57:39] one of them will tell is that you can
[57:41] have what they have or you can be what
[57:43] they are you know I like to work out and
[57:45] so you see this you'll see this Ultra
[57:47] lean ripped guy and he'll say buy my
[57:51] program and you can be just like
[57:53] me but that's a lot
[57:56] because that man lives and breathes what
[57:58] he
[57:59] does and it's his only job he spends
[58:02] hours and hours all day every day in the
[58:04] gym he takes all the perfect supplements
[58:07] he eats all the food that is perfect for
[58:09] what he's doing everything he's doing is
[58:11] focused on that and then he'll tell me
[58:13] if you do what I tell you to do for 30
[58:15] minutes a day you can look like me no
[58:16] you can't for one thing his genetics are
[58:19] probably the best of anybody in the
[58:21] world and there's only a couple in the
[58:22] world that could match him you can't put
[58:24] in what left out but he'll tell me I can
[58:27] make you just like me knowing full well
[58:29] that he can't do it knowing full well
[58:31] that I can't do it amen you know it
[58:34] doesn't matter how many lessons I take
[58:37] and how much I pay and how much time I
[58:38] put into it I will never sing like
[58:40] brother Joshua Columbo ever I can get
[58:44] better than I
[58:46] am but I'll Never sing like him because
[58:50] he's starting at a higher level because
[58:52] he's got something I don't have in the
[58:53] first place
[58:55] but I could go to a music teacher or a
[58:57] voice coach and they'd sayure I can make
[58:59] you do it but they can't because I don't
[59:00] have what he has and I never will I
[59:03] can't change my physical voice like that
[59:05] he has what I don't have but here's the
[59:08] thing as
[59:09] Believers we've all got the same
[59:11] potential if we're true children of God
[59:14] because our potential is to make it in a
[59:16] resurrection and a Rapture our potential
[59:18] is eternal life amen our potential is to
[59:21] manifest the word of God in this age and
[59:23] every single one of us has has been
[59:24] given the same potential to make it amen
[59:28] to go over there we're going to show it
[59:29] in different ways and we're going to
[59:30] have different roles and different
[59:32] things to do in this world but each and
[59:33] every one of us is going to make it if
[59:35] we're children of God Amen and it's not
[59:37] a lie and it's not a it's not something
[59:38] that God's in it for himself but he's in
[59:40] it for us to bring us to an expected end
[59:43] amen and we we're here to produce the
[59:44] word of God we're here to do what he has
[59:46] called us to do by the word of God and
[59:48] we're built and we're ordained to do it
[59:51] and there's something inside of us that
[59:52] is there to be drawn out and it's drawn
[59:54] out by the Holy Spirit now brother bran
[59:56] would say this in the unveiling of God
[59:58] he says the word is God and the word
[1:00:01] made manifest is God himself taking his
[1:00:05] own word and manifesting it among
[1:00:07] Believers he says nothing can make it
[1:00:10] live but Believers just Believers and
[1:00:14] we've seen a lot of waves go through
[1:00:15] message ranks over the last 10 or 15
[1:00:17] years and we realize that not everyone
[1:00:19] that says Lord Lord not everyone that
[1:00:21] says William brandom William Bram not
[1:00:23] everyone that says message message is a
[1:00:25] Believer amen but those there are those
[1:00:28] that can't help it because they're
[1:00:29] ordained to believe and there's
[1:00:31] something inside of them and brother
[1:00:32] Braham says only Believers can manifest
[1:00:35] the word because it was in them from the
[1:00:37] beginning amen we have it because God
[1:00:39] placed it in us we're not grafted into
[1:00:41] God we're not transformed from pigs into
[1:00:45] sheep we always were what we are but it
[1:00:48] takes a an experience it takes a
[1:00:50] relationship it takes a a face-to-face
[1:00:53] contact with God God that causes us to
[1:00:55] Humble ourselves to the word to yield
[1:00:57] ourselves to the word to bring out that
[1:00:59] life that's within us amen that's why we
[1:01:01] can humble ourselves is because there's
[1:01:03] something in us that responds to the
[1:01:05] word when it comes forth
[1:01:07] amen but it takes that personal
[1:01:09] experience with God and we see it with
[1:01:11] Moses we see it with David we see it
[1:01:13] with Samuel we see it with Jacob and
[1:01:14] they were always a Believer they were
[1:01:16] always a son or daughter of God but it
[1:01:19] took a personal face-to-face experience
[1:01:21] for them to realize who and what they
[1:01:23] were and who and what God was as well
[1:01:25] amen and that's what each one of us is
[1:01:27] looking for brother B would say this in
[1:01:29] the Easter seal he says it's the earnest
[1:01:31] or the potential we're talking about a
[1:01:33] glimpse of potential this evening he
[1:01:34] says the quickening power of your
[1:01:37] Resurrection when you receive the holy
[1:01:39] spirit is then dwelling in you the
[1:01:41] potential of it this is the potential
[1:01:43] we're talking about we're talking about
[1:01:45] Resurrection potential we're talking
[1:01:46] about Rapture potential but that's the
[1:01:49] end of the whole thing and there's a
[1:01:52] whole process that we're going through
[1:01:53] to get us to that point anden I believe
[1:01:56] that last step will be quick and it'll
[1:01:58] be Qui it'll be short and it'll be easy
[1:02:01] it's all of this going through time and
[1:02:03] the waiting that's difficult but in the
[1:02:05] end when that call happens when that
[1:02:07] knock comes on the door and you realize
[1:02:08] that a resurrected Saint is standing
[1:02:10] there and it's going to be soon time to
[1:02:12] go everything's going to fall away real
[1:02:14] fast and easy at that point amen but
[1:02:16] getting there is what takes us that's
[1:02:18] the hard part that's the journey that's
[1:02:19] the battle amen but brother I I'm saying
[1:02:22] here this is not of your doing the
[1:02:24] potential you have is not because you
[1:02:26] you sat down and you went to church and
[1:02:28] you read your Bible or these things but
[1:02:30] it's because God put something inside of
[1:02:32] you and then he quickens it by the Holy
[1:02:34] Spirit and that's what makes the
[1:02:36] potential come to life and as soon as
[1:02:38] you get that Holy Spirit that's really
[1:02:40] when the clock starts ticking that's
[1:02:42] really when you start living for the
[1:02:43] first time because now you are in a
[1:02:46] you're a new creature in Christ you've
[1:02:48] been born again you're a child of God
[1:02:50] and you recognize it and that's when
[1:02:52] things really start to happen amen and
[1:02:54] we've talked about this before in a full
[1:02:56] series on restoration but God gives us
[1:02:58] his spirit for one purpose and one
[1:03:00] purpose alone to restore us back because
[1:03:03] it's the earnest of our Redemption it's
[1:03:05] the earnest of our Salvation it's the
[1:03:07] down payment of what's going to happen
[1:03:09] at the very end that's why he gives it
[1:03:11] to us is to take us all the way through
[1:03:13] to the end into full Fellowship into
[1:03:15] full relationship and to be the way that
[1:03:17] he intended us to be to rule and reign
[1:03:20] with him now brother Brown would say
[1:03:22] this in the invisible Union and we're
[1:03:23] doing a lot out
[1:03:24] 1965 tonight he says if you're a born
[1:03:27] again Christian that little germ that
[1:03:29] was predestinated to you it's word
[1:03:32] coming on word on word on word and word
[1:03:36] and come into the full statue of Christ
[1:03:38] that's right so he can come get his
[1:03:41] bride word on top of word on top of word
[1:03:44] on top of word brother John I've been
[1:03:46] serving the lord for 40 years 40 years
[1:03:49] plus more word plus more word plus more
[1:03:51] word church we're growing till we get
[1:03:53] out of here there there is no rest there
[1:03:55] is no end to the battle we're going to
[1:03:56] be fighting all the way through and
[1:03:58] we're going to be growing all the way to
[1:03:59] the end
[1:04:01] amen he says we're just ready for one
[1:04:04] thing that's the coming of the Lord now
[1:04:08] we've still got to work we still got to
[1:04:10] make a living we still got to raise
[1:04:12] families and we got to go on vacation
[1:04:14] and buy houses and fix things and make
[1:04:16] things and do all of these things amen
[1:04:18] but in it all we have to understand one
[1:04:20] thing it's there to help us get through
[1:04:24] God will use our jobs God will use our
[1:04:26] families our marriages our life
[1:04:28] situations to help us come into
[1:04:30] resurrecting and rapturing
[1:04:32] Faith so that means it's not always
[1:04:34] going to be
[1:04:35] easy but he's going to use it and I've
[1:04:38] seen it in my own life where you start
[1:04:40] out with a great job and it ends up with
[1:04:42] a horrible job but through it you learn
[1:04:44] something and you learn to die out and
[1:04:46] you learn to give up things and you
[1:04:48] learn to trust and you learn to lay down
[1:04:50] you learn to walk away you learn to be
[1:04:52] quiet you learn to speak up sometimes
[1:04:55] and he uses all of these things to
[1:04:57] develop us amen and it's not just me but
[1:05:00] it's you and I can't get you to heaven
[1:05:01] and you can't get me to heaven but as a
[1:05:03] body he'll work things in our midst Amen
[1:05:06] to draw us into that character that's
[1:05:08] required for a bride that's going into
[1:05:09] resurrection and a Rapture but the big
[1:05:12] question is how do we do it how do we
[1:05:15] come to our potential how do we come to
[1:05:18] what Paul was talking about in Ephesians
[1:05:19] 3 there where we come to know the
[1:05:21] breadth and the depth and the height and
[1:05:24] the length and all the blessings that
[1:05:26] God has to be revealed in US Paul said
[1:05:29] this in Philippians 3 he says but what
[1:05:31] things were going were gained to me
[1:05:34] those I counted lost for Christ yay
[1:05:37] doubtless and I count all things but
[1:05:39] loss for the Excellency of the knowledge
[1:05:41] of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have
[1:05:44] suffered the loss of all things and do
[1:05:47] count them but dong that I may win
[1:05:49] Christ our potential is Christ it's full
[1:05:53] restoration it's full relationship it's
[1:05:55] face-to-face contact but he says to get
[1:05:58] there I had to suffer the loss of all
[1:06:01] things and he didn't say that they were
[1:06:04] not valuable but he says I count them as
[1:06:07] not valuable I count them as
[1:06:10] worthless he says and be found in him
[1:06:12] not having mine own righteousness which
[1:06:14] is of the law but that which is through
[1:06:16] the Faith of Christ the righteousness
[1:06:18] which is of god by faith that I may know
[1:06:22] him one and the power of his
[1:06:26] resurrection we want that don't
[1:06:28] we and the fellowship of his
[1:06:32] sufferings no no I don't want that Lord
[1:06:35] no no no this is part of the scripture
[1:06:37] now he says being made conformable unto
[1:06:40] his death he says if by any means Church
[1:06:45] what are we willing to give
[1:06:47] up what aren't we willing to give up
[1:06:51] Paul said by any means I
[1:06:54] could attain unto the resurrection of
[1:06:57] the Dead Paul says I'll do anything to
[1:06:59] be raised at the
[1:07:00] end he says not as though I'd already
[1:07:03] attained it either were already perfect
[1:07:05] but I follow after if that I may
[1:07:08] apprehend that for which I am also
[1:07:10] apprehended of Christ Jesus he said that
[1:07:12] I could be what he says I am the way he
[1:07:15] looks at me the way he sees me the way
[1:07:17] he knows me I want to be that what he
[1:07:20] said about me what he's declared about
[1:07:21] me in the word I want to be that in the
[1:07:24] end that's where I want to rest is that
[1:07:26] I would come on the other side and he
[1:07:28] would say Well done thou good and
[1:07:29] faithful servant you became the image
[1:07:31] that I had for you amen he say because
[1:07:35] of that he says Brethren I count not
[1:07:37] myself to is apprehended but this one
[1:07:40] thing I do how do I get to my potential
[1:07:42] brother John this one thing I do
[1:07:45] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:07:48] and reaching forth under those things
[1:07:50] which are before I
[1:07:52] press
[1:07:54] I
[1:07:55] press well I pressed yesterday Press
[1:08:00] today I'm tired you got to keep
[1:08:03] pressing I press toward the mark for the
[1:08:06] prize of the High Calling of God in
[1:08:09] Christ Jesus we tend to think of press
[1:08:11] as big moments but the greatest press is
[1:08:15] the day byday
[1:08:17] pressure One Step a day is better than
[1:08:21] 10 steps every year in one moment
[1:08:24] the everyday step see we look for the
[1:08:27] big moments and I've talked about this
[1:08:30] before we look for the big moments but
[1:08:32] the greatest thing you can do is just do
[1:08:34] one step every day one step every day
[1:08:38] and you know what before long you've
[1:08:39] gone a mile and if you try to do the
[1:08:42] mile in that hard Terrain in one day you
[1:08:44] get worn out maybe CU it's it's tough
[1:08:47] and there's no path and there's lots of
[1:08:48] things in your way but if you can do one
[1:08:50] step a day you'll get there it's the
[1:08:54] people that leave it till the last
[1:08:55] minute that don't make it you can't do
[1:08:58] that you got to press every single day
[1:09:01] amen don't wait for special meetings
[1:09:04] don't wait for special speakers every
[1:09:06] day say I'm going to take one foot more
[1:09:08] into my property I'm going to kick Satan
[1:09:10] out one more bit today just push a
[1:09:13] little bit every single day we'll talk
[1:09:16] about that what it looks like even
[1:09:18] victory in the believer's Life as we go
[1:09:19] a little further and but he says this is
[1:09:22] Paul's thing he says I
[1:09:26] press but then he says in verse 15 let
[1:09:29] us
[1:09:30] therefore as many as be perfect as many
[1:09:33] as be mature be thus minded so in other
[1:09:35] words don't let just that just be Paul's
[1:09:38] way of life but let that be our way of
[1:09:40] life don't say well that was good for
[1:09:42] Paul he's the prophet of the age he's
[1:09:44] got the greatest anoint no no no you're
[1:09:46] Anointed with the same thing if you got
[1:09:48] the same mind he said and if anything ye
[1:09:51] be otherwise minded God shall shall
[1:09:53] reveal even this to you that's the grace
[1:09:55] of God he's saying if you don't have
[1:09:57] this attitude if you're not inclined
[1:09:59] towards this then God's going to come
[1:10:00] out and he's going to grab a hold of you
[1:10:02] and he's going to bring you to this
[1:10:03] place because that's what's needful to
[1:10:05] overcome to press the mark amen he said
[1:10:08] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:10:10] that word forgetting means neglecting no
[1:10:13] longer caring for so in other words Paul
[1:10:16] said I'm letting go of
[1:10:18] everything I'm not going to rest on
[1:10:20] what's behind me I'm not going to hold
[1:10:22] on to what's behind me but I'm going to
[1:10:24] press forward to what's ahead and that's
[1:10:26] a resurrection and that's a Rapture
[1:10:28] that's eternal life that's awaiting for
[1:10:30] me at the very end of it he says I'm not
[1:10:31] going to let any of it hold
[1:10:33] value we can't rest on yesterday's
[1:10:36] Miracles we can't rest on yesterday's
[1:10:38] testimony it's good don't forget it use
[1:10:41] it to cheer yourself up Moses talked
[1:10:44] about a book of remembrance I was going
[1:10:46] through my my devotions book and I have
[1:10:48] a a a list of prayer requests and then I
[1:10:51] have a list of answered prayers I had 60
[1:10:53] 1 major prayer requests answered last
[1:10:55] year in this church some you knew I was
[1:10:58] praying about and some you didn't know I
[1:10:59] was praying about 61 in this little
[1:11:02] congregation major things that we've
[1:11:03] been praying for that
[1:11:05] happened that's a wonderful
[1:11:07] testimony we're not talking little
[1:11:09] things we're talking some very big very
[1:11:12] serious things people on death door
[1:11:16] people where the doctors don't know
[1:11:18] what's wrong with them people changing
[1:11:20] jobs people with relationship issues
[1:11:24] people unsure of where they're at in
[1:11:26] Christ people with addictions and
[1:11:28] deliverance and provision and Leadership
[1:11:31] and all these different things it's a
[1:11:33] wonderful thing but don't rest on that
[1:11:37] rest that he's calling you forward rest
[1:11:39] that there's more to be had
[1:11:41] amen Paul said I'm just laying that
[1:11:44] aside praise the Lord for it but I'm
[1:11:46] moving on because he's got more for me
[1:11:49] but listen to this we're talking about
[1:11:51] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:11:53] brother Abraham says this you see we
[1:11:55] want to hold on to everything that we
[1:11:57] can and then follow
[1:12:02] Jesus he says but sometimes Jesus wants
[1:12:04] us to turn loose of everything so we can
[1:12:07] get both hands on
[1:12:11] him isn't that just like us as humans
[1:12:14] I'll take as much as I can plus Christ
[1:12:19] that's our human nature that's our human
[1:12:21] nature but he says no no no you got to
[1:12:23] like go of everything and only to his
[1:12:26] cross cling hold to him trust in him
[1:12:30] don't have backup plans say Lord I'm
[1:12:33] trusting you Lord I'm trusting you
[1:12:36] completely he says sometimes we think
[1:12:38] that just because we've got a hold he
[1:12:40] says we want him to have all of us so
[1:12:43] therefore in all to do it we just have
[1:12:44] to walk out there by faith and believe
[1:12:47] him that's all and just trust we can't
[1:12:50] explain it there's no way to explain it
[1:12:53] we just believe it and take it like that
[1:12:57] you know what that means Church we're
[1:12:58] going to face decisions and we're going
[1:13:00] to face choices where we can say I'm
[1:13:02] going to take Jesus I'm going to take
[1:13:05] Jesus
[1:13:06] plus he says the way you're going to get
[1:13:08] ahead is choose him and him alone that's
[1:13:11] the greatest testimony when you give him
[1:13:14] full trust and he proves it right by his
[1:13:17] word that's the testimony of a Believer
[1:13:20] is I laid my life I laid my decision I
[1:13:22] laid my faith family I laid my finances
[1:13:24] I laid my job I laid my education in his
[1:13:27] hands I gave him priority and he backed
[1:13:30] it up every single time amen we're
[1:13:34] talking about a glimpse of potential a
[1:13:36] glimpse of potential is when we say Lord
[1:13:38] I'm Letting Go and I'm going to trust
[1:13:41] you and I'm going to trust you and every
[1:13:43] day we make a choice do I trust or do I
[1:13:46] try and do it myself and that choice is
[1:13:49] either going to lift us higher or it's
[1:13:50] going to drag us down because the more
[1:13:52] we hold on to the more or we get dragged
[1:13:54] down cuz we can't do it in the end
[1:13:56] anyways it's not going to be us that
[1:13:57] does any of these things Paul said I'm
[1:13:59] leaving it all behind the consequences
[1:14:01] of not pressing are worse than if I
[1:14:04] compromise or slack
[1:14:05] off I've got to keep pressing I've got
[1:14:07] to keep
[1:14:08] pushing Paul said this you know we we've
[1:14:12] got to accept that our present
[1:14:15] condition is far worse than what awaits
[1:14:18] Us in other words it can only get better
[1:14:21] the further we go Paul said this in
[1:14:24] Romans he
[1:14:26] said for I reckon that the sufferings of
[1:14:28] this present time are not worthy to be
[1:14:31] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:14:34] revealed in Us in other words it's not
[1:14:36] even able to be spoken of in the same
[1:14:37] breath shouldn't even cross your lips
[1:14:40] what you're going to be what you're
[1:14:41] going to have versus what you're going
[1:14:43] through now you know when I spoke at
[1:14:45] sister Edna's funeral you know a couple
[1:14:46] weeks ago I said I don't think she's
[1:14:49] over there in a Celestial body saying I
[1:14:53] wish I'd done something different but
[1:14:55] you know who is people that didn't make
[1:14:57] it to
[1:14:59] heaven we don't want to go over there
[1:15:01] and say I wish I'd done something
[1:15:02] different we want to go over saying I'm
[1:15:04] so glad I didn't do anything different
[1:15:07] amen trusting holy to him in these
[1:15:09] things you know we talked last service
[1:15:11] about how our attitude would change if
[1:15:13] we truly understood that we cannot be
[1:15:15] defeated defeated ultimately we may lose
[1:15:18] battles it seems and you know it's not
[1:15:21] that we lose battles it's that we think
[1:15:23] lose
[1:15:24] battles cuz remember God's got a plan
[1:15:26] and a purpose for
[1:15:28] everything right remember when Moses
[1:15:31] when the children of Israel were
[1:15:32] fighting and and Moses as long as his
[1:15:34] hands were up they won and when they
[1:15:35] dropped down then they lost what was it
[1:15:38] showing it showing we need each other
[1:15:41] cuz as soon as he had a couple people to
[1:15:42] hold his hands up then they won the
[1:15:44] victory
[1:15:45] completely God was just showing them a a
[1:15:47] type in the shadow in the scripture for
[1:15:49] our admonition but God will allow things
[1:15:51] to e and Flow
[1:15:53] you don't see every scripture showing
[1:15:56] that the victory comes immediately or
[1:15:58] that there aren't es and tides to the to
[1:16:00] the battle there's highs and lows
[1:16:02] there's valleys and mountains there's
[1:16:04] time where it looks like he's not even
[1:16:05] there and there's time where we're so
[1:16:07] sure of it we don't even it's it's not a
[1:16:09] worry it's a Flawless
[1:16:11] Victory but through it all he's still
[1:16:13] there through it all he's still there
[1:16:15] amen you know when you look at
[1:16:18] professional athletes the biggest game
[1:16:20] that they're playing is mind games and
[1:16:23] they say the greatest athletes are those
[1:16:25] that believe they cannot
[1:16:26] lose they cannot lose they believe in
[1:16:29] every situation no matter how bad it is
[1:16:31] how far down they are that they can
[1:16:33] always come back and win and they have
[1:16:36] people and they spend hundreds and
[1:16:37] thousands and millions of dollars
[1:16:39] working with the mindset of these
[1:16:42] professional athletes to try and get
[1:16:43] them to a place where they have
[1:16:45] confidence in
[1:16:46] themselves all Christ is trying to do is
[1:16:49] get us to have confidence in him and
[1:16:52] when we have confidence in him he puts
[1:16:53] that confidence back towards us that we
[1:16:55] can trust because he's our Warrior he's
[1:16:58] the he's the the great Champion that
[1:16:59] we're looking for we're not trusting in
[1:17:01] flesh we're not trusting in ourselves
[1:17:03] we're not trusting in our testimony to
[1:17:05] make us through amen but we're trusting
[1:17:07] in the Holy Ghost quickening the word
[1:17:09] inside of us to get us through all of
[1:17:10] these things but what if we start
[1:17:12] thinking as Paul said about what lies
[1:17:14] before us CU he didn't just say it's a
[1:17:17] glory that'll be revealed to us he said
[1:17:19] it'll be a glory revealed in us that
[1:17:21] means there's something that's going to
[1:17:23] come through Us in this time not just in
[1:17:25] the future not just at the end that's
[1:17:28] going to be glorified amen and it's
[1:17:30] through us and it's God wanting to
[1:17:32] express himself through the children
[1:17:34] that he's put on this Earth brother B
[1:17:37] puts it this way he says the head of
[1:17:39] every one of the attributes of Sin is
[1:17:42] Sin he says and when Jesus come dealing
[1:17:45] with sin at Calvary he killed sin and he
[1:17:48] killed every attribute that goes with it
[1:17:51] and completely redeemed us back back to
[1:17:53] God the Redemption Part is perfect and
[1:17:55] complete but there's a process that's
[1:17:57] happening now in these fleshly bodies he
[1:18:00] says and today today we are Sons and
[1:18:03] Daughters of God perfectly Redeemed by A
[1:18:06] Perfect Redeemer the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:18:09] amen he says oh that makes me glad to
[1:18:10] think about that but he says now we have
[1:18:13] not got it in full that's true but we
[1:18:16] have the earnest of our Salvation so
[1:18:19] listen up now because he's going to tell
[1:18:21] us the consequences of not having
[1:18:23] the fullness he says we've got the
[1:18:25] earnest we've got the down payment but
[1:18:27] we're in a body that's not redeemed and
[1:18:29] so he says there's consequences to that
[1:18:31] our Soul's converted but our flesh is
[1:18:33] not so listen to this we're talking
[1:18:35] about a glimpse into potential he says
[1:18:37] now we are not past Temptation neither
[1:18:41] are we above sin one of the biggest
[1:18:44] Hang-Ups I see especially in in young
[1:18:46] young believers is that they're tempted
[1:18:49] and they think that means they're not a
[1:18:50] Believer or they don't have the Holy
[1:18:52] Ghost
[1:18:54] the scripture says Jesus was tempted
[1:18:57] without sin but he was tempted because
[1:19:00] you got to understand that temptation is
[1:19:02] not a desire temptation is a
[1:19:05] choice something is placed before you
[1:19:07] and you decide yay or nay you decide
[1:19:11] speak or be quiet you decide stay or
[1:19:15] go you decide stand and be counted or
[1:19:17] sit and not it's just a choice
[1:19:20] temptation is just a choice it's not
[1:19:23] wrong brother Bram says you can't stop
[1:19:25] birds from flying over your head but you
[1:19:26] can stop them from making a nest and he
[1:19:28] says Satan's going to be there on one
[1:19:30] shoulder and the holy ghost's going to
[1:19:32] be on the other and they're both going
[1:19:34] to be chirping at you and you've got to
[1:19:36] make a decision and temptation is a
[1:19:38] decision and that's all it is it's not
[1:19:41] wrong to have
[1:19:43] Temptation he says but Jesus will help
[1:19:46] us in every Temptation so he says the
[1:19:48] consequence of only having a portion is
[1:19:50] that we can be tempted he says say and
[1:19:53] he says neither are we above sin but
[1:19:55] Jesus will help us in every
[1:19:58] temptation but then he says and now when
[1:20:00] I do wrong I'm ready to repent if the
[1:20:03] prophet knows he's going to do wrong
[1:20:04] what about you and I failure is going to
[1:20:06] happen at some point we're human we're
[1:20:09] living in flawed flesh don't let that
[1:20:11] beat you
[1:20:13] down he says anyone he says as now when
[1:20:16] I do wrong I'm ready to repent anyone
[1:20:19] else is that wants to live right with
[1:20:21] God you don't desire to do wrong but
[1:20:23] when Satan upsets you somewhere he says
[1:20:26] because there's an atonement waiting for
[1:20:28] me that's why he's quick to repent he
[1:20:30] says if I confess my wrong God's just to
[1:20:32] forgive it and the same thing is when
[1:20:35] you've got sick he says it's no sign
[1:20:37] that you're immune from sickness
[1:20:39] Believers are not immune from getting
[1:20:41] sick clearly
[1:20:44] clearly he says but in every time God is
[1:20:48] willing you to deliver to deliver you
[1:20:50] from that sickness see your sin is no
[1:20:53] different from sickness cuz sickness is
[1:20:54] an attribute of sin and he said Christ
[1:20:56] defeated all of those and the atonement
[1:20:58] is there for everything see we look at
[1:21:01] atonement as I did wrong and the blood
[1:21:03] covers it no no no every attribute of
[1:21:05] sin is given to you under that atonement
[1:21:08] of the blood Deliverance healing
[1:21:10] provision whatever it is whatever you
[1:21:12] have need of that's found under the
[1:21:14] atonement of
[1:21:15] Christ he says every time you go to you
[1:21:19] get sick you go to God and ask him and
[1:21:21] then he's willing to Del deliver you
[1:21:23] because there is an atonement he says
[1:21:26] it's based upon your faith in that
[1:21:27] atonement which is your Redemption and
[1:21:30] if we know that this joy that we have
[1:21:32] just being the earnest money on what
[1:21:34] lays ahead what will it be when we draw
[1:21:37] the full benefit of the policy he says
[1:21:40] what will it be he says my some people
[1:21:42] say how people scream and shout and act
[1:21:44] when the Holy Spirit gets on them I
[1:21:46] wonder really what it will be when we
[1:21:48] get to Glory no wonder they said they
[1:21:50] sang the song with Palms in their hands
[1:21:52] hosan glory to him that sits upon the
[1:21:55] throne hosana singing waving Palms he
[1:21:57] says that'll be a marvelous time and if
[1:22:01] just the attributes makes me feel like I
[1:22:03] do sometime what will it
[1:22:07] be just having a Taste Of Glory makes us
[1:22:09] feel like we do sometimes what will it
[1:22:11] be when we get the whole thing amen what
[1:22:14] will it be like when we experience the
[1:22:16] full Victory where we say death where is
[1:22:20] iy Sting grave where is thy Tre is we're
[1:22:23] soaring through the air what's that
[1:22:24] going to be
[1:22:25] like I don't even
[1:22:27] know how to express what I think that's
[1:22:30] going to be like can you imagine brother
[1:22:33] Mark we're going through the air Nan is
[1:22:36] next to us sister golding's on the other
[1:22:39] side brother Manuel brother Nelson guy
[1:22:42] whoever it might be and we're going
[1:22:44] through the air and we know it's done
[1:22:46] it's finished completely and the
[1:22:49] fullness is
[1:22:51] there what is that going to be
[1:22:54] worth what is that going to be worth to
[1:22:57] see this disappear like a thought just
[1:23:00] boom one minute we're there and the next
[1:23:01] we're
[1:23:03] not I don't think we'll shut up for a
[1:23:05] long
[1:23:12] time he says I'll have a different body
[1:23:14] to
[1:23:15] stand he says it's a one sure thing when
[1:23:19] I know a Temptation comes up and I'd
[1:23:21] flee to him my refuge
[1:23:23] and then God delivers me from that
[1:23:25] Temptation and sets me free my heart
[1:23:27] rejoices and the glory bells ring I look
[1:23:30] back and think oh God how did you do it
[1:23:33] not how did I do it how did you do it he
[1:23:37] says how happy I am he says you know
[1:23:40] when you're really badly tempted on
[1:23:42] something if you'll just make Jesus your
[1:23:46] Refuge shut your eyes and pass right by
[1:23:49] it it'll be the sweetest experience you
[1:23:53] ever went through we're talking about a
[1:23:55] glimpse into potential what is the
[1:23:57] potential here to face every Temptation
[1:24:00] and turn it into the sweetest experience
[1:24:03] you've ever had to take your trials to
[1:24:05] take your Temptations your hard times
[1:24:07] your difficult decisions and turn them
[1:24:09] into a place where you get closer to God
[1:24:12] rather than get frustrated or depressed
[1:24:14] or angry with God where you look at as
[1:24:16] an opportunity to be closer to him to
[1:24:19] get a victory you've never had before
[1:24:21] rather than down in the mouth in the Y
[1:24:23] me this
[1:24:24] time the greatest the sweetest
[1:24:27] experience you'll ever have there's
[1:24:29] potential to have it he's saying but
[1:24:31] you've got to decide are you going to
[1:24:33] close your eyes and walk on past that
[1:24:36] Temptation and experience something
[1:24:38] you've never had before or are you going
[1:24:40] to give in and get that thing that just
[1:24:41] hinders you every time and doesn't
[1:24:44] really feed you like you want to
[1:24:46] anyways I've been there church I know
[1:24:49] what it's like to give into temptation
[1:24:51] and you never walk away
[1:24:53] satisfied you always walk away feeling
[1:24:55] worse than when you started he says skip
[1:24:58] it and go into Christ your refuge and
[1:25:00] you'll have the sweetest experience
[1:25:01] you've ever had cuz what happens is you
[1:25:04] make that decision once he knows you're
[1:25:07] serious you keep making it and that
[1:25:10] desire just goes away it just leaves I
[1:25:13] can testify of it I can testify of it
[1:25:16] where it ain't there anymore you don't
[1:25:18] deal with it why because sometimes you
[1:25:20] literally close your eyes and walk away
[1:25:23] but you say not again not here that's
[1:25:26] not who I am and you walk away and you
[1:25:28] go back to his presence amen don't worry
[1:25:30] about whether or not you're tempted
[1:25:32] you're going to be tempted we're tempted
[1:25:34] every single day Satan's very good at
[1:25:36] that but worry about what you do when
[1:25:38] you're tempted and say I want to be in
[1:25:40] his presence more than I want to do this
[1:25:42] thing or have this thing
[1:25:44] amen think about it you've got an
[1:25:46] opportunity to slam the door in Satan's
[1:25:48] face and they'll go have a nice little
[1:25:50] chat with Jesus to sit down cuddle up
[1:25:53] and Satan can be outside and he can be
[1:25:55] raging and screaming and pounding on the
[1:25:56] door and you don't care you don't hear
[1:25:58] because you're safe in a place where you
[1:26:00] know that you can have everything you
[1:26:01] have need of and you're satisfied to be
[1:26:03] there that's what the whole world is
[1:26:05] looking for is
[1:26:07] satisfaction and we can find it without
[1:26:09] having anything that they have amen
[1:26:13] don't feed your Temptations for Pete's
[1:26:15] sake don't feed your weaknesses don't
[1:26:17] feed those things that tend to hold you
[1:26:19] back and distract you you know just in
[1:26:21] thinking on the
[1:26:23] service is not so much the good and bad
[1:26:25] that we're dealing with anymore it's
[1:26:28] distractions that's where we're at we
[1:26:31] live Sanctified life Satan has to come
[1:26:34] to us in a in a subtle way see we're
[1:26:36] looking for the big frontal attack and
[1:26:38] he doesn't he comes in subtly
[1:26:41] subtly and you don't realize how much
[1:26:43] he's gotten in until you start realizing
[1:26:45] where your time's
[1:26:46] going and all of a sudden you're like oh
[1:26:49] how did he get in you know what they
[1:26:51] call call today day when you get on your
[1:26:53] phone and you go go go they call it Doom
[1:26:56] scrolling cuz you'll go from app to app
[1:26:59] from screen to screen from thought to
[1:27:01] thought from video to video for hours on
[1:27:05] end and you won't realize how long
[1:27:07] you've gone till you look at it and it's
[1:27:09] 1:30 a.m. and you realize I did it again
[1:27:13] it's distractions you know it was funny
[1:27:16] today I was I was at Costco with Jensen
[1:27:19] and there were some things going on and
[1:27:21] I was texting people then I got a call
[1:27:22] from Joe and I couldn't pick it up I was
[1:27:24] in the middle of something and I was all
[1:27:26] stressed out cuz I couldn't answer his
[1:27:28] call right away you know how silly that
[1:27:30] is it's a
[1:27:32] distraction I'll be down having my
[1:27:34] devotions and people are texting and
[1:27:36] what do I think well I should answer
[1:27:38] them no don't we don't need to if they
[1:27:41] really need it they'll call my wife or
[1:27:43] they'll call me and they'll come through
[1:27:44] and say I've got a need but otherwise we
[1:27:47] can put the distractions
[1:27:49] aside there's potential to be in his
[1:27:51] presence but the problem is is we have
[1:27:53] these things on our wrists and these
[1:27:54] things in our hands that are constantly
[1:27:56] interrupting
[1:27:58] us amen Satan's got us so wrapped up you
[1:28:02] know I was I I really messed up my back
[1:28:05] and I had to go in for massage therapy
[1:28:06] today and everybody's on their phones
[1:28:09] you're in Costco and everybody's on
[1:28:11] their phones they might have their
[1:28:12] spouse or their boyfriend or their
[1:28:14] girlfriend or whatever their kid there
[1:28:15] and everybody's on their phones they
[1:28:17] have to be entertained he's got them so
[1:28:19] wrapped up around that idea of never
[1:28:22] having a quiet moment that people can't
[1:28:24] just be quiet you know when I went moose
[1:28:26] hunting I I I don't get a chance to
[1:28:28] listen to other ministers very often but
[1:28:30] as I was driving out brother John Andy
[1:28:32] service was firing up so I decided I was
[1:28:34] going to listen to him
[1:28:35] and I picked up a hitchhiker and I said
[1:28:38] now it's my vehicle so I'm just letting
[1:28:40] you know I'm going to be listening to a
[1:28:42] service that a friend of mine's
[1:28:43] preaching in Washington so you know you
[1:28:45] can choose to stay or go he said no
[1:28:47] that's fine I need it more than you and
[1:28:48] then he promptly fell asleep but he
[1:28:50] preached a service called Stand still
[1:28:53] and it was rubber meets the road down
[1:28:55] home preaching about how Satan has got
[1:28:57] us so busy so busy that we can't take
[1:29:00] time to actually sit down and talk to
[1:29:03] God I highly recommend it if You' got
[1:29:05] time go back I put it in the in the in
[1:29:07] the group chat on WhatsApp but if you're
[1:29:09] looking for it just look up the service
[1:29:11] John Andy stand still and you'll find it
[1:29:14] it was it was just such a nice message
[1:29:16] for us to be able to sit back and get
[1:29:20] quiet sometimes that's we need just sit
[1:29:23] back and get quiet start dwelling on the
[1:29:26] things of God Amen so don't feed your
[1:29:29] Temptations don't feed your weaknesses
[1:29:31] don't feed your discontentment feed your
[1:29:33] faith feed your faith read and hear what
[1:29:36] God says about you that's what's going
[1:29:38] to bring you to your potential you know
[1:29:40] they they have those Veggie Tales and
[1:29:43] they've got that little worm that's
[1:29:44] listening to those motivational tapes
[1:29:46] and he's listening to the motivational
[1:29:48] tape and the motiv the guy the
[1:29:49] motivational speaker says you are a
[1:29:51] skilled metal worker and he says I did
[1:29:53] not know that about
[1:29:57] myself well sometimes God's telling us
[1:29:59] things and we didn't know that about
[1:30:01] ourselves that's why we need to read it
[1:30:05] remember scripture says stir up your
[1:30:06] pure Minds by way of
[1:30:08] rembrance keep reminding yourself
[1:30:11] because I'll tell you what Satan's doing
[1:30:12] a great job at reminding us of a lot of
[1:30:14] other things we've got to keep pushing
[1:30:16] back and feeding ourselves with the
[1:30:18] thing that pushes back his thoughts so
[1:30:20] we can take on the mind of Christ
[1:30:22] brother Braham says this he says this is
[1:30:24] where Satan got in to make it all
[1:30:26] mechanics and no
[1:30:28] Dynamics back he says all Dynamics and
[1:30:31] no mechanics so he's talking about isza
[1:30:33] Street Pentecost he says back there was
[1:30:36] all Dynamics and no mechanics now we've
[1:30:37] got all mechanics and no Dynamics he
[1:30:40] says see we've got to put it together
[1:30:42] we've got the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:30:44] but we've got to come back with the word
[1:30:47] to feed this machine we can't feed it on
[1:30:50] Creed it won't burn it jokes up chokes
[1:30:53] up the flu and it will not burn it it
[1:30:55] was made for the word of God man shall
[1:30:57] not live by bread alone but by every
[1:30:59] word not just part of it every word that
[1:31:02] proceeds out of the mouth of God so
[1:31:04] we're supposed to live by the word of
[1:31:06] God and he's saying it's not by the
[1:31:07] letter or not just by the letter amen
[1:31:11] because it's got to be by the life it's
[1:31:12] got to be by the word the spirit of the
[1:31:15] word of God because that's what's got
[1:31:16] life in it it's got Direction and
[1:31:18] discernment and provision and all sorts
[1:31:20] of things baked into it to keep us
[1:31:22] operating the way we ought to be he says
[1:31:24] this machine needs to be fed the word of
[1:31:26] God to make it give it to make it do its
[1:31:28] thing amen it gives us strength it give
[1:31:30] us gives us purpose it gives us Faith to
[1:31:33] say God you said that's what faith says
[1:31:36] God you said and when something else
[1:31:39] comes up God you said the word says it
[1:31:41] is written it is written you know as I
[1:31:44] was dwelling on these things I was
[1:31:45] reminded of a a crushing machine now I'm
[1:31:47] sure many of you haven't seen a crushing
[1:31:49] machine but you see they've got those uh
[1:31:51] on the outer edges they've got just kind
[1:31:53] of H teeth there but in the middle you
[1:31:55] have these rotating drums that have
[1:31:57] teeth on them and what they do is
[1:31:59] they'll take anything and they'll put it
[1:32:01] inside these and they got them of
[1:32:02] different sizes and ranges and power and
[1:32:05] these different things and small ones
[1:32:07] are used for just doing basic recycling
[1:32:09] where you're doing cardboard or or
[1:32:12] aluminum cans or these different things
[1:32:15] and then they've got them big enough to
[1:32:16] where you can take a car and put it in
[1:32:17] and it'll just turn over and it'll just
[1:32:19] completely destroy the car just turn it
[1:32:21] into into tiny little bits you know and
[1:32:23] you can put just about anything into
[1:32:25] them you can put anything of any shape
[1:32:26] or size or material and it doesn't
[1:32:29] matter what it is in time those crushing
[1:32:32] machines will rip it apart you know you
[1:32:35] can you can put something in there
[1:32:36] that's a weaker material you put a
[1:32:38] cardboard box like that and it's easy
[1:32:41] you can put something in there like a
[1:32:43] propane cylinder now propane cylinder is
[1:32:45] made out of metal it's very structurally
[1:32:47] rigid and it's smooth so it's not easy
[1:32:50] to grab onto and you put them in there
[1:32:52] and you'll see what happens now watch
[1:32:54] these two cuz this guy puts them in this
[1:32:55] way and it sucks them in right away boom
[1:32:58] crushes them flattens them out doesn't
[1:33:00] even slow down but you look at that one
[1:33:02] on the right there and it sits up there
[1:33:05] and what happens is those wheels keep
[1:33:07] turning and they're trying to grab and
[1:33:09] that thing just bumps up and just and so
[1:33:12] it keeps going it keeps going look at
[1:33:13] those other ones they're flattened there
[1:33:15] completely and that one's just riding on
[1:33:18] top sometimes we're going through things
[1:33:20] in life and you see something happen
[1:33:22] immediately and you're like praise the
[1:33:23] Lord then sometimes you have something
[1:33:25] that just seems to not you can't get a
[1:33:27] hold of it look at this that's what it's
[1:33:29] like but do we give
[1:33:31] up do we give up this thing floated for
[1:33:34] a
[1:33:35] while and then it
[1:33:37] grabbed and it was made the same as the
[1:33:40] rest of them flat as a pancake and you'd
[1:33:42] never know what it was by the time it
[1:33:43] was done amen you can't beat a crushing
[1:33:47] machine because it's got power all the
[1:33:50] time and it'll rip R anything apart look
[1:33:52] at this this is a
[1:33:54] motorcycle a complete motorcycle an old
[1:33:57] motorcycle granted but this is a
[1:33:59] complete motorcycle and they're feeding
[1:34:00] it in front tire first okay this took
[1:34:04] less than 15
[1:34:06] seconds that's the tire and the rear
[1:34:08] brake going through 15 seconds it
[1:34:11] reduced that thing to little chunky
[1:34:13] pieces you can't beat a crushing machine
[1:34:17] that's the way Believers are supposed to
[1:34:19] be when it comes to Faith in the word of
[1:34:21] God is you just keep feeding it and you
[1:34:25] keep feeding it and you just keep
[1:34:26] turning and turning and turning I watch
[1:34:29] one where they put a full car through
[1:34:31] you know what even the biggest machines
[1:34:33] will choke up one of those with a car
[1:34:36] but you know what they do back it off a
[1:34:38] bit and then they go at it again back it
[1:34:41] off a bit it gets chugged up clogged up
[1:34:43] a bit they just back it off a bit and
[1:34:45] then they rotate it in they'll put a
[1:34:46] complete car through there no problem
[1:34:49] and just little pieces coming out the
[1:34:50] end we're talking about
[1:34:53] potential but it takes faith brother
[1:34:55] Bram says you got to feed the machine
[1:34:57] you got to feed this machine with the
[1:34:59] word of God you got to keep it strong
[1:35:01] you got to keep it powered up you got to
[1:35:02] keep fueling it can't wait just for
[1:35:04] church services and then it's got to be
[1:35:06] a day by day it's got a step by step
[1:35:09] just a constant constant churning they
[1:35:12] say about the Roman Legions that's what
[1:35:13] made them so difficult was they would
[1:35:15] stand there the charge would hit them
[1:35:18] and they'd get pushed back a little bit
[1:35:20] and then they'd get anchored
[1:35:22] and then they just start stabbing and
[1:35:23] walking and it was just one step at a
[1:35:25] time they'd step hold stab kill everyone
[1:35:28] there one step step and that's all they
[1:35:30] did one step at a time and they destroy
[1:35:32] armies that were 2 three four five 10
[1:35:35] times their size just because they were
[1:35:37] an inevitable crushing machine you
[1:35:40] couldn't get them couldn't get through
[1:35:42] their ranks you couldn't get them off
[1:35:44] their position couldn't get them away
[1:35:46] from each other they just stayed there
[1:35:48] and time and time again just simple
[1:35:50] steps stay in information do the same
[1:35:52] thing do the same thing do the same
[1:35:55] thing and nothing could beat
[1:35:56] them that's the way we're supposed to be
[1:35:59] feed every day defeat every day have
[1:36:03] Victory every day
[1:36:06] amen we're supposed to destroy anything
[1:36:09] that comes in our
[1:36:11] path that's the way it's supposed to be
[1:36:14] amen remember Daniel saw a stone that
[1:36:17] once it started rolling nothing could
[1:36:19] stand before it that's Stone was Christ
[1:36:22] and we're a part of him we're a part of
[1:36:25] an inevitable stone that destroys
[1:36:26] everything in its past in its in its
[1:36:29] path Amen brother Bram says so here we
[1:36:32] stand a church commissioned on the last
[1:36:34] commission the last thing that Jesus
[1:36:36] said to his church the last commission
[1:36:38] given go ye into all the world and Make
[1:36:40] Disciples of all Nations he that
[1:36:42] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[1:36:44] and he that believeth not shall be
[1:36:46] damned he says and and is a conjunction
[1:36:49] to tie your sentence together and these
[1:36:51] sign shall follow them that believe in
[1:36:53] my name they shall cast out Devils they
[1:36:55] shall speak with new tongues if they
[1:36:57] take up serpents or drink deadly things
[1:36:58] it will not harm them and if they lay
[1:37:01] their hands on the sick they shall
[1:37:02] recover he says so why should we have to
[1:37:05] stand in the presence of some Heathen
[1:37:07] God and take a
[1:37:10] defeat brother Ram made no exceptions
[1:37:13] the word makes no exceptions Jesus never
[1:37:16] said there are some devils you will not
[1:37:18] defeat there are some diseases that will
[1:37:21] will not be healed there are some
[1:37:22] situations that cannot be Revol resolved
[1:37:25] he said
[1:37:28] everyone
[1:37:29] all no
[1:37:32] exceptions some go through
[1:37:34] easy some aren't so
[1:37:37] easy some take a lot of faith some take
[1:37:40] a little
[1:37:41] faith but the inevitableness of the word
[1:37:44] of God is what we're trusting in Amen
[1:37:47] brother man puts it this way he says now
[1:37:49] we must remember it's God but when God
[1:37:52] has said anything it's the truth hold
[1:37:54] right on to it it's got to happen he
[1:37:58] says if you weaken then unbelief will
[1:38:01] take over he says but you stay with the
[1:38:04] word what you got to feed your faith
[1:38:07] faith comes by hearing and hearing by
[1:38:10] the word of God faith comes by
[1:38:11] understanding and understanding by the
[1:38:12] word of God what causes us to weaken
[1:38:14] when we stop feeding on the full word of
[1:38:16] God Amen when we stop fellowshipping
[1:38:19] with the saints Saints when we stop
[1:38:21] prioritizing God in our life when we
[1:38:23] give other things access when we put God
[1:38:25] in second place what's he going to do
[1:38:29] then we placed something else ahead of
[1:38:31] him how can we defeat something that
[1:38:33] we've elevated above God we can't cuz we
[1:38:37] put it there we've got to put it back
[1:38:40] and let him have the preeminence amen
[1:38:43] what causes us to weaken is when we stop
[1:38:44] looking at the word and start looking at
[1:38:46] symptoms and
[1:38:48] circumstances and that's the thing
[1:38:49] that's so easy to see because we've got
[1:38:51] five senses that are really good with
[1:38:52] circumstances and
[1:38:54] symptoms amen that's why we need that
[1:38:56] super sense that brother Braham talked
[1:38:57] about amen but the hardest time to feed
[1:39:01] and it's ironic the hardest time to feed
[1:39:03] is when things are good because you say
[1:39:06] well what do I need God for I'm talking
[1:39:07] humanly speaking now carnally speaking
[1:39:09] we don't feel the urge to have devotions
[1:39:11] we don't have the the urge to pray so
[1:39:13] much often when things are going good
[1:39:15] when money's in the bank when when our
[1:39:17] health is great when the family is doing
[1:39:19] well when the jobs are going great
[1:39:20] there's no problems in the church
[1:39:21] everything's hunky dory that's when we
[1:39:23] need to be feeding because that's the
[1:39:26] rest that's the time when we we have the
[1:39:28] opportunity to get strong because when
[1:39:30] the battle hits we're going to be
[1:39:32] scrambling we're going to be fighting
[1:39:34] someone's going to be in the hospital
[1:39:35] and we're not going to have all that
[1:39:37] time we're going to be dealing with
[1:39:38] family situations and stress is going to
[1:39:40] be there and we're going to have to be
[1:39:41] battling the symptoms and the way to do
[1:39:44] that is to get yourself healthy before
[1:39:45] those hit and man you want to be healthy
[1:39:47] before the battle hits you want to be
[1:39:48] fit before the battle hits you don't
[1:39:50] want to be using the battle to get fit
[1:39:51] cuz that doesn't tend to work out very
[1:39:53] well amen the calm times are when we
[1:39:56] need to be feeding you know brother
[1:39:58] Braham said David was prayed up before
[1:40:00] Goliath came so that when Goliath came
[1:40:03] he didn't have to go make things right
[1:40:04] he didn't have to go straighten things
[1:40:05] out he didn't have to go down and find
[1:40:07] out what God wanted him to do amen he
[1:40:09] knew what he was supposed to do brother
[1:40:12] says he never prayed a prayer he never
[1:40:14] offered nothing he knew he was anointed
[1:40:17] amen he was anointed and that slingshot
[1:40:19] had proved the right kind of thing he
[1:40:22] had faith in his anointing he had faith
[1:40:24] that God could direct that rock straight
[1:40:26] in the middle of that helmet there where
[1:40:28] the only place could be hit he was
[1:40:31] standing there he knew he was a good
[1:40:33] shot he knew God had made him that catch
[1:40:36] that he knew God had made him capable of
[1:40:39] defeating Goliath God had given him
[1:40:41] confidence in his calling confidence in
[1:40:43] his anointing confidence in his position
[1:40:46] it says amen he knew he had killed a
[1:40:48] lion he knew he had killed a bear but
[1:40:50] that was his father's Earthly father's
[1:40:52] possession here is his Heavenly father's
[1:40:54] possession amen he didn't get down what
[1:40:57] must I do now Lord he spoke and said
[1:40:59] you'll be like The Lion and the bear and
[1:41:01] here I come amen glory to God yes sir he
[1:41:04] spoke and went forward to meet this
[1:41:06] Goliath when God gives you a testimony
[1:41:09] that's to prepare you for the next
[1:41:11] battle that will give you your next
[1:41:12] testimony and you're supposed to say as
[1:41:14] he defeated you last time he'll defeat
[1:41:17] you this time as I won the victory last
[1:41:19] time I'll defeat I'll defeat you this
[1:41:21] time I'll win the victory this time
[1:41:23] God's victory in the last circumstance
[1:41:25] is to prepare you to believe for victory
[1:41:27] in the next circumstance God's Building
[1:41:29] us up in our faith and in our
[1:41:31] experience but it's always potential
[1:41:33] it's always taking us a little bit
[1:41:34] higher a little bit deeper a little bit
[1:41:36] closer so that we can trust him
[1:41:38] completely amen now catch this he spoke
[1:41:41] and went forward to meet this Goliath
[1:41:44] regardless of his
[1:41:47] size who am
[1:41:49] I
[1:41:51] we need a preacher to handle that we
[1:41:53] need a a super Ministry to handle that
[1:41:56] we need a prophet on the scene to handle
[1:41:58] that no if you're there then God has
[1:42:00] said you're there to handle it
[1:42:02] regardless of his size he
[1:42:05] says he says he was a little Ruddy
[1:42:07] looking fellow you know he wasn't very
[1:42:09] big we're talking about a glimpse of our
[1:42:11] potential it is not by what we see in
[1:42:13] the
[1:42:15] mirror that's not it he says he wasn't
[1:42:18] very big now regardless of his size and
[1:42:20] his so-called ability to do
[1:42:22] so we have natural gifts but that's not
[1:42:25] going to cut it he says you know the
[1:42:27] bishop told him said now look here son
[1:42:29] that man's a theologian he's a fighter
[1:42:31] he was born a fighter he's been a
[1:42:32] fighter from his Youth and you're no
[1:42:34] match for him and his brother said oh
[1:42:36] you naughty thing come out here and do
[1:42:37] such a thing as that get on back home
[1:42:40] you got people telling you you can't do
[1:42:41] it cuz you're not special enough and
[1:42:43] then you got people saying you're doing
[1:42:44] it for your own good and for your own
[1:42:45] influence and and your own agenda and
[1:42:47] all these different things David didn't
[1:42:49] listen to any of it
[1:42:51] he says that didn't bother him why he
[1:42:54] knew he was anointed Why by
[1:42:58] experience he knew he was anointed
[1:43:00] because he had the effects of that
[1:43:02] anointing and the victories in his life
[1:43:04] you say brother John I don't know if I'm
[1:43:06] anointed what has he done for you if you
[1:43:09] got a victory if you got a testimony
[1:43:11] guess what you're anointed cuz there
[1:43:12] ain't anybody else doing it that's not
[1:43:14] anointed you're anointed to overcome
[1:43:17] you're anointed to have the Victory and
[1:43:19] whatever he places in front of you
[1:43:21] regardless of your size regardless of
[1:43:23] your so-called skill gift or experience
[1:43:26] you are ordained to deal with it by the
[1:43:28] Holy
[1:43:29] Ghost by the spirit of God according to
[1:43:31] the word of God he knew he was anointed
[1:43:34] the god that delivered me see it's not
[1:43:35] about him the god that delivered me from
[1:43:40] that lion the god that delivered me from
[1:43:42] the paws of that bear heill more than
[1:43:44] that deliver me from that Philistine
[1:43:46] here I come I meet you in the name of
[1:43:48] the Lord God of Israel amen he didn't
[1:43:50] pray through he was already prayed
[1:43:53] through now catch this there's a dual
[1:43:55] meaning here David's done his part but
[1:43:57] catch this he says he was already prayed
[1:43:59] through why cuz God prayed him through
[1:44:01] before the foundation of the world and
[1:44:03] what's the proof the proof is that he
[1:44:06] was anointed the proof that God had
[1:44:08] prayed for him the proof that God had
[1:44:10] ordained him was in the anointing on him
[1:44:12] that was calling him to go forward and
[1:44:14] meet that challenge it wasn't just words
[1:44:16] it wasn't just a thought it wasn't just
[1:44:18] a feeling there was something in him
[1:44:20] that was pulling him to the
[1:44:22] battle amen it says his he was anointed
[1:44:26] for the job he had to speak and go
[1:44:28] forward that's all there is to do about
[1:44:30] it just speak and go forward oh that's
[1:44:33] all there was to it God had prepared
[1:44:35] David God had anointed David God had
[1:44:37] given David experiences to prepare him
[1:44:40] to have faith for this great moment he
[1:44:42] was anointed with a king and he did a
[1:44:44] king's job here amen David's confidence
[1:44:47] was not in himself his confidence was
[1:44:49] that God always always delivered
[1:44:52] him we think of third pole and we think
[1:44:56] of adopted Sons me me me no it is Christ
[1:44:59] in me the hope of glory it is the Mighty
[1:45:01] Warrior inside of us the all-conquering
[1:45:03] Christ in me that gives me the victory
[1:45:06] it's not about me I trust him and he
[1:45:08] does the work I have faith he does the
[1:45:11] performance amen David believed he was
[1:45:14] facing Goliath because God wanted him to
[1:45:16] chop Goliath's head
[1:45:18] off that's why he move forward amen
[1:45:21] that's a that's a change of attitude I
[1:45:23] believe we need is that we're facing
[1:45:25] something because God wants us to cut
[1:45:27] its head off not to bow before it not to
[1:45:30] back away listen a woman is supposed to
[1:45:32] be meek and surrendered to her husband
[1:45:36] to her husband not to other men we had a
[1:45:39] situation way back when where a man
[1:45:41] tried to tell my a brother tried to tell
[1:45:43] my wife what to do and he said I'm a
[1:45:45] brother you have to listen to me she
[1:45:46] said no I listen to my
[1:45:48] husband amen
[1:45:51] women don't have to be pushed around by
[1:45:52] other men they run to their
[1:45:55] refuge and my wife speaks in my name
[1:45:58] just as the wives of the men here speak
[1:46:00] in their name and they have the full
[1:46:01] authority of their husbands behind them
[1:46:03] to protect to provide to care for all
[1:46:07] these different things
[1:46:10] amen don't face the trial with a Grimace
[1:46:12] and a
[1:46:13] frown face it with the idea of this is
[1:46:16] going to be really
[1:46:19] awesome when I have a
[1:46:22] testimony now that's something you got
[1:46:24] to
[1:46:25] feed that's something you got to feed
[1:46:27] attitude you've got to
[1:46:30] feed oh my do I say
[1:46:33] it you ever run into somebody who's got
[1:46:35] a great attitude about themselves
[1:46:38] overinflated you know why they feed
[1:46:42] it but you need to feed it as the word
[1:46:45] would feed you not hype faith based on
[1:46:51] solid evidence of the word of God Amen
[1:46:55] brother Braham
[1:46:56] says the angel love that song only
[1:47:00] believe remember what the angel told him
[1:47:02] at the beginning he says if you can get
[1:47:05] the people to believe nothing will stand
[1:47:08] before your prayer not even cancer the
[1:47:11] goal is to get us to believe that takes
[1:47:13] faith and Faith only comes one way and
[1:47:15] that is by the hearing and reading of
[1:47:17] the word of God that's the only way it
[1:47:20] comes
[1:47:21] it's the only way it comes it won't come
[1:47:22] through podcast it won't come through
[1:47:24] YouTube it comes by the word of God and
[1:47:27] it's a person to person contact between
[1:47:29] you and him amen David was so
[1:47:32] anticipating this victory that he ran
[1:47:35] towards Goliath I don't know about
[1:47:38] you I'd walk real carefully to a trained
[1:47:43] warrior in thick armor with only one
[1:47:46] little spot where I can kill him I'd
[1:47:48] walk real close he's got a spear that's
[1:47:50] massive he's got a sword that I can
[1:47:51] barely lift he's got armor he's got a
[1:47:53] shield
[1:47:55] Bearer he's got all these things I would
[1:47:57] walk very carefully expecting him to
[1:47:59] make a move David ran to Goliath that's
[1:48:03] how confident he was in the outcome he
[1:48:05] ran cuz he wanted to get it
[1:48:08] done this wasn't going to be long he
[1:48:11] knew the end before it happened and his
[1:48:15] actions proved it
[1:48:17] amen he knew he was in the will of God
[1:48:19] why because God had prepared him to move
[1:48:21] forward in this situation he knew he was
[1:48:24] there for it and so he didn't hesitate
[1:48:26] he walked into
[1:48:27] it brother says this now on Easter
[1:48:30] morning there was another light that
[1:48:32] struck the Earth he says when the Holy
[1:48:35] Spirit was given this is the power of
[1:48:36] our potential that's what brings the
[1:48:38] word to life in us the word's there but
[1:48:40] it's the holy ghost that brings it to
[1:48:41] life he says and it's given to bring
[1:48:43] light to those seeds that God by his
[1:48:45] forn knowledge knew would be here on the
[1:48:47] earth and he knew the first natural seed
[1:48:49] he knows where the spiritual seed is
[1:48:52] your body was laying right here on the
[1:48:53] earth when God brought forth the earth
[1:48:55] into existence we're part of the earth
[1:48:57] we were laying there and by his forn
[1:48:59] knowledge he knew exactly who would love
[1:49:00] him and who would serve him and who
[1:49:02] would not his forn knowledge tells us
[1:49:04] that he says so you see people making
[1:49:06] their
[1:49:08] blunders they stumble at it they run at
[1:49:11] it and they think this and that we're
[1:49:14] talking about knowing your place here he
[1:49:16] says but it doesn't work right we see
[1:49:18] that have you ever seen somebody try and
[1:49:21] be something in a church when they
[1:49:23] weren't called what did they do they
[1:49:25] stumble at it they run at it they push
[1:49:28] and they pull and they influence and
[1:49:30] they do this and that and it never works
[1:49:31] out why they weren't meant to be there
[1:49:34] but he says but there is a working right
[1:49:37] he says and yet that's to find God's
[1:49:39] perfect will and stand in it what God
[1:49:43] called you
[1:49:45] for you say brother John how do I know
[1:49:47] that one do you have the Holy Ghost
[1:49:50] if you do sons of God are led by the
[1:49:53] spirit of God and if you are following
[1:49:55] his will and his word then you are where
[1:49:57] he wants you to be you're in his will
[1:50:00] that's your adoption position and we'll
[1:50:01] get into that in many services in the
[1:50:03] future where brother BR would say you
[1:50:04] might be a farmer you might be a wife
[1:50:06] you might be a mechanic it doesn't
[1:50:07] matter you're there as an adopted child
[1:50:09] of God and whatever crosses your path
[1:50:13] you have the authority to
[1:50:16] defeat it doesn't have to be a dad
[1:50:18] praise for the child mama has got just
[1:50:21] as much Authority amen doesn't not be a
[1:50:24] preacher that comes and lay hands it can
[1:50:26] be a husband any brother any sister has
[1:50:29] Authority in the Kingdom of Heaven to
[1:50:32] push Satan back if thou can't believe
[1:50:35] you just can't fool around with it
[1:50:37] that's all you know we've got an
[1:50:40] identity crisis that needs to be
[1:50:41] resolved brother Brown says when the
[1:50:43] bride recognizes who she is the rapture
[1:50:46] will go that means we've got a ways to
[1:50:49] go
[1:50:51] that means there's more to be revealed
[1:50:53] that means there's more to be understood
[1:50:54] there's there there's more to experience
[1:50:56] scripture says we're Kings and Priests
[1:50:59] we're
[1:51:01] intercessors that means that we can go
[1:51:03] on behalf of somebody else and it has an
[1:51:06] effect not everyone gets to do that only
[1:51:09] sons and daughters get to do those
[1:51:11] things we're lights in the world Jesus
[1:51:13] said we're here to help those that can't
[1:51:14] help themselves but we've got to resolve
[1:51:17] our identity first before we can help
[1:51:18] somebody find theirs we've got to know
[1:51:21] who we are we've got to understand where
[1:51:23] we're positioned we've got to understand
[1:51:24] what God's trying to do in our lives
[1:51:26] amen and the only way we can get it is
[1:51:29] by the reading and hearing of the word
[1:51:30] of God it's simple it's simple and
[1:51:34] people that read the word and listen to
[1:51:35] the word regularly you'll find they've
[1:51:37] got faith when the moment comes CU
[1:51:40] that's the way it works it's so simple
[1:51:43] it's so simple it's not super Ministries
[1:51:46] I was talking to a brother the other day
[1:51:48] he says I think we've entered the age
[1:51:49] where the super min Ministries are going
[1:51:50] away because it distracts Too Much from
[1:51:54] the Simplicity of the gospel and we rest
[1:51:56] too much on gifts instead of coming into
[1:51:58] that personal face-to-face contact with
[1:52:00] Christ where we know that our prayers as
[1:52:02] good as any other ministers and any
[1:52:04] other man or any other woman that a
[1:52:06] child can have the same Authority on
[1:52:08] their knees Before the Throne of God
[1:52:10] that the greatest Minister on this Earth
[1:52:12] could have at the same time there's no
[1:52:14] difference you're both children of God
[1:52:16] you both have access amen the more I
[1:52:19] read it the more I realize who I am who
[1:52:22] he is you know whenever you start with a
[1:52:26] new company they give you a benefits
[1:52:27] booklet don't they and you know what you
[1:52:29] do you read through that because you
[1:52:31] want to know what's available because
[1:52:33] you don't want to leave any stone
[1:52:35] unturned any dollar unspent when I the
[1:52:37] last company I worked for in BC every
[1:52:39] year they give me $2,000 for what they
[1:52:42] call the health spending account and I
[1:52:44] could spend that on sports equipment I
[1:52:46] could spend that on gym equipment I
[1:52:47] could do that on on on all sorts of
[1:52:49] things it was wasn't just going to
[1:52:50] practitioners and doctors and that and I
[1:52:52] use that to the max we bought salmon
[1:52:54] fishing rods for that why cuz I went in
[1:52:57] and I found out the little details of
[1:53:00] what I was allowed and not allowed to do
[1:53:01] and I used it to my best advantage
[1:53:04] that's what reading the word does now
[1:53:06] it's not about using it to your best
[1:53:08] Advantage you got to find God's will but
[1:53:09] this will tell you what you're supposed
[1:53:11] to be doing and that what you're allowed
[1:53:12] to be doing and it'll give you your
[1:53:14] Authority it'll give you your marching
[1:53:16] orders and it'll give you Faith to do
[1:53:18] what he asks you to do
[1:53:20] amen it's a funny thing how the more you
[1:53:22] read it the more you'll get out of it
[1:53:25] the more it'll Quicken to you and I've
[1:53:26] said that before you know we we tend to
[1:53:28] say well well I'm not having devotion so
[1:53:30] I'm going to do an hour a day no do 10
[1:53:32] minutes get used to it build it up
[1:53:36] you'll get used to it and guess what
[1:53:38] it'll it'll it'll Quicken that thirst
[1:53:40] it'll Quicken that hunger inside of you
[1:53:42] and you'll start to want it more and
[1:53:43] more and that'll keep you going rather
[1:53:45] than trying to cram it down your throat
[1:53:46] at the beginning man give them time to
[1:53:49] work brother Bram says but if there is a
[1:53:51] hunger in your heart to see God there
[1:53:54] isn't enough devils in all torment to
[1:53:56] keep you from seeing him he will make a
[1:53:58] way where there's no way if you really
[1:54:00] want to see him and you're honest in
[1:54:02] your heart she he's talking about the
[1:54:03] Queen of Sheba the Queen of Sheba had to
[1:54:05] think of those things but when Faith
[1:54:07] takes the
[1:54:19] to satisfy your hunger amen blessed are
[1:54:22] those that hunger and thirst after
[1:54:24] righteousness for they shall be filled
[1:54:26] amen if you got a hunger then he's got
[1:54:29] something to satisfy it we're in the
[1:54:31] season of knowing who God is and who we
[1:54:33] are that's really what the final
[1:54:35] Revelation is remember brother BR would
[1:54:36] preach uh on Christ as the mystery of
[1:54:38] God revealed and it was God above us God
[1:54:40] With Us and God in us the last bit is
[1:54:42] God in us amen that's Revelation
[1:54:45] 108 that's God coming down and unveiling
[1:54:48] himself in flesh
[1:54:50] and that's what's supposed to be going
[1:54:51] on Amen and we're in the same season of
[1:54:53] knowing that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:54:55] yesterday today and forever as brother
[1:54:56] brandham did just listening to that
[1:54:58] message why are people so tossed about
[1:55:00] and he's talking about the third poll
[1:55:02] remember and he talks about that little
[1:55:03] room and the angel said I'll meet you
[1:55:06] there but it wasn't only brother
[1:55:08] brandham going into that little room
[1:55:09] there was only room for
[1:55:11] one and it was individuals going into
[1:55:14] that little room meeting with God
[1:55:16] oneon-one and they come out and they
[1:55:19] were completely healed and they said
[1:55:21] what happened we don't know all we know
[1:55:24] is what happened we don't know how it
[1:55:25] happened we don't know what made it
[1:55:27] possible but we walked in one way and we
[1:55:30] came out another and what was it it was
[1:55:31] in the personal presence of Christ
[1:55:33] revealing himself to them doing the work
[1:55:36] and brother brandham had his own
[1:55:37] experience with his stomach being healed
[1:55:39] and these different things but it's a
[1:55:40] one-on-one brother brandham was a sign
[1:55:44] and he talked about my message is to
[1:55:45] declare him that he's here Jesus Christ
[1:55:47] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:55:49] Hebrews 138 but that wasn't just in his
[1:55:51] ministry that's for your life that's for
[1:55:53] my life that's what we're looking at is
[1:55:56] Christ alive in our
[1:55:58] situations where we don't have to go to
[1:56:00] a prophet but where we know that he's
[1:56:03] alive and well in me that he cares about
[1:56:05] me he's filled me with the spirit he's
[1:56:07] leading me he's guiding me
[1:56:10] amen like Joshua and Caleb said we're
[1:56:12] more than able why cuz he's with us the
[1:56:15] captain of the host is with us amen and
[1:56:17] he's the one that's leading us amen
[1:56:20] he's saying if there's a hunger you say
[1:56:22] Lord I want more I need more I see more
[1:56:25] that means there's more to be had
[1:56:27] there's potential amen but that takes
[1:56:30] submission that takes surrender that
[1:56:32] takes yielding that takes humbling
[1:56:34] ourselves to the word of God brother
[1:56:35] Bram says the Way Up Is
[1:56:37] Down Paul said let go let
[1:56:42] go
[1:56:44] release and let him take hold and start
[1:56:46] moving amen what is it yield to the word
[1:56:49] by the Holy Spirit and what that does is
[1:56:51] that puts the control in his hands
[1:56:53] instead of
[1:56:55] mine there's that song that says Jesus
[1:56:57] Take the Wheel that's literally what
[1:56:59] we're doing is we're saying I'm going to
[1:57:00] just back off and I'm going to let you
[1:57:03] lead lead and guide doesn't mean I'm
[1:57:04] never going to do anything we're not
[1:57:07] just sitting like a lump but we're to be
[1:57:09] moved by him and then it's him that's
[1:57:11] doing it not us that's doing it cuz
[1:57:13] we're walking with him as he leads us
[1:57:14] along amen then we don't have to try we
[1:57:17] just have to yield and then it's him
[1:57:19] that's doing the work brother R's
[1:57:22] talking here of Georgie Carter you
[1:57:24] remember her she was one of the the
[1:57:25] great miracles of his of of his ministry
[1:57:28] and she had tuberculosis for 9 years and
[1:57:30] 6 months in a bed I think he said she
[1:57:32] was down to 47 lbs which I don't even
[1:57:34] know how that's possible because that's
[1:57:36] basically bones and skin and organs I
[1:57:38] don't know how somebody was alive but he
[1:57:39] said she could barely even move her head
[1:57:41] and go oh she couldn't even
[1:57:44] spit that's how sick she was he said
[1:57:48] some of them said how did she she walked
[1:57:49] brother brandham I said the power of the
[1:57:52] Living God held her up remember she got
[1:57:55] up out of that bed and walked she didn't
[1:57:58] have any muscles there's nothing there
[1:58:00] to move
[1:58:02] her he said the power of the Living God
[1:58:05] held her up she just became submitted to
[1:58:08] the power of God that's what's the
[1:58:10] trouble friends at night when you see me
[1:58:12] your brother under Vision there's
[1:58:13] nothing else in the world that's nothing
[1:58:15] else in the world but submitting myself
[1:58:17] to the Holy Spirit he said you that sick
[1:58:20] can submit yourself to the holy spirit
[1:58:22] so completely that you'll forget your
[1:58:25] sickness we're talking about potential
[1:58:27] you say brother Jonathan how's that
[1:58:29] possible all I know is he said it and I
[1:58:31] believe it that you can be what so
[1:58:34] submitted to the Holy Spirit you can
[1:58:36] forget your sickness you can completely
[1:58:39] submit yourself to the Holy Ghost and no
[1:58:41] Affliction can hold you you walk by the
[1:58:43] power of the Holy Ghost you are well you
[1:58:46] give your testimony and everything else
[1:58:48] he says you're healed by the power power
[1:58:49] of the Holy Ghost you that's sinful
[1:58:52] maybe drink and smoke and gamble put
[1:58:54] your poison in here whatever your if
[1:58:56] there's a besetting sin or a habit and
[1:58:58] do things like that you say I can't give
[1:59:00] them up brother Bram yes you can you
[1:59:02] just submit yourself to God one time
[1:59:05] remember I was talking about Temptation
[1:59:06] you close your eyes and walk by one time
[1:59:08] and watch what God does to honor that he
[1:59:10] says and just yield your whole self to
[1:59:13] God and watch what takes place that's
[1:59:16] the whole thing there's no secret in it
[1:59:18] it's not a hocus Pocus the only thing is
[1:59:20] to submit yourself to God Amen there it
[1:59:23] is and then it's not you any longer see
[1:59:26] see that takes the pressure
[1:59:28] off that takes the pressure off when you
[1:59:30] say Lord I've tried and I can't do it so
[1:59:34] stop trying and just say Lord I'm here
[1:59:37] for victory Lord I'm here for
[1:59:39] deliverance I'm surrendering myself to
[1:59:42] what your word
[1:59:43] says now you do
[1:59:47] it if you're sick of the results you've
[1:59:50] been getting how about you give it to
[1:59:52] him that's what he's saying here he says
[1:59:55] then it there it is it's not you any
[1:59:57] longer it's the Lord the Lord does it
[1:59:59] after that he said God will
[2:00:03] move you just sit still and let God do
[2:00:06] it see that's right have faith in him
[2:00:09] he'll work it out all right he said the
[2:00:12] power of God is here to transform you
[2:00:14] from sickness to health now watch this
[2:00:17] he says God moving on in The Exodus of
[2:00:20] his church this is why I say things like
[2:00:23] I don't believe there'll be any sick
[2:00:24] people going to Resurrection and Rapture
[2:00:26] obviously not a
[2:00:27] resurrection but a Rapture because if
[2:00:30] God's moving on if he's bringing you to
[2:00:32] a place where every aspect of Satan's
[2:00:34] influence is being removed from your
[2:00:36] life then how can you be sick how can
[2:00:38] you be sick there's no exception given
[2:00:41] in scripture for sickness that can't be
[2:00:43] healed so he says what is it it's God
[2:00:45] moving on in The Exodus of his church
[2:00:47] he's preparing us to go he said she's
[2:00:49] coming into the blossom where God will
[2:00:52] gather after a while his grain he says
[2:00:54] it's wonderful coming out of the
[2:00:56] darkness Into The Marvelous Light how we
[2:00:58] love that it's not about Comfort or
[2:01:01] riches or ease amen it's about moving
[2:01:05] on that's what this potential is about
[2:01:07] potential is about moving on it's about
[2:01:09] stepping up we don't go to people so
[2:01:11] that they'll make us worse and we don't
[2:01:14] go to people we ought not to go to
[2:01:15] people so they can tell us we're doing
[2:01:16] great where we're at but we go to people
[2:01:19] for help to bring us to a higher level
[2:01:22] that's what potential is doesn't matter
[2:01:24] how good or how bad you are there's
[2:01:26] always a higher level there's always a
[2:01:28] higher plane of Faith amen there's a
[2:01:29] higher level of Fellowship there's a
[2:01:31] higher level of believing there's a
[2:01:33] higher level of surrender there's a
[2:01:36] greater humbling that we can have amen
[2:01:38] and I want to finish on this one quote
[2:01:40] and the musicians can come if they want
[2:01:42] I found it so inspiring when I read it
[2:01:43] and I've held it and I've held it and
[2:01:45] I've held it and I just want to share it
[2:01:46] with us tonight as we finish on this
[2:01:48] thought of a glimpse into potential cuz
[2:01:50] I want you to see what God sees in you
[2:01:53] that's how you know your potential is
[2:01:54] what he tells you about
[2:01:56] yourself cuz his is the only truth his
[2:01:59] is the right whether you see it or not
[2:02:01] whether you agree with it or not what he
[2:02:02] says is right now he says this he says
[2:02:05] there are devils but Jesus cast them out
[2:02:09] and he gave his church authority to do
[2:02:10] so to cast out devils in my name he cast
[2:02:13] Seven Devils out of a pretty woman one
[2:02:15] day and he said when the unclean Spirit
[2:02:17] has gone out of a man walks in dry
[2:02:19] places returning back then bringing
[2:02:22] seven other Devils with him he says now
[2:02:24] that goes to show that if the man was
[2:02:26] cleaned of devils there was something in
[2:02:28] him had gone out a devil had gone out
[2:02:31] now when the devil moved out that gives
[2:02:34] God an opportunity to move in so when he
[2:02:37] goes out let the Holy Spirit come in
[2:02:40] don't just leave it there if you do just
[2:02:43] repent of your sins and go on then
[2:02:44] you're going to be worse off than ever
[2:02:46] but get that place where Satan want once
[2:02:49] lived and occupied and get it filled
[2:02:50] with the holy spirit of God and then
[2:02:53] you'll have the strength of God's word
[2:02:54] in you manifested to cast out Devils he
[2:02:58] said the contest is on the evening
[2:02:59] lights are shining God's holy spirit is
[2:03:02] present let's stand together if we would
[2:03:05] he says then as we leave this building
[2:03:08] to go to our different places and our
[2:03:10] homes to meet outside and to meet the
[2:03:12] world let's not go as we have in former
[2:03:15] times this is our New Year's message
[2:03:18] don't go out the way we came
[2:03:20] in not that what you came in as was bad
[2:03:24] but don't stay
[2:03:25] there he says let's not go as we have in
[2:03:29] former times let's go in the power of
[2:03:31] his resurrection let's go in the name of
[2:03:34] Jesus Christ with a banner lifted high
[2:03:36] and have faith in his word to handle the
[2:03:38] two-edged sword with the shield and the
[2:03:40] full armor of God on to meet the enemy
[2:03:43] why because he's getting stronger and
[2:03:46] more powerful every day if you stay the
[2:03:48] same he'll defeat you you've got to grow
[2:03:52] you've got to strengthen you've got to
[2:03:53] mature he said as the enemy comes in
[2:03:56] like a flood the spirit of God raises up
[2:03:58] a standard against him if we have come
[2:04:02] to the end of these things that the
[2:04:04] mysteries of God have been completed
[2:04:05] with us have
[2:04:09] we are we at the
[2:04:12] end mysteries of God should be finished
[2:04:14] Revelation 10:7
[2:04:16] says if they're finishing he says then
[2:04:20] we are looking for more strength a
[2:04:23] rapturing strength to meet a worse Force
[2:04:27] don't look for things to get better but
[2:04:29] look for a greater strength a rapturing
[2:04:32] strength that'll Rapture the church and
[2:04:34] take it into Glory he says we must have
[2:04:39] it butat this he says let's meet this
[2:04:42] coming year with a challenge we are the
[2:04:45] Servants of the Living
[2:04:47] God that's not potential that's
[2:04:51] position we are not just servants we are
[2:04:54] children we are Sons and Daughters of
[2:04:57] the Living God he says let's go act like
[2:04:59] it let's go out knowing who we are he
[2:05:03] says and like Shadrach mhach and
[2:05:04] Abednego of old will not bow to the
[2:05:07] Devils of this world and take back this
[2:05:09] thing that we've talked about he said
[2:05:11] but let's press the
[2:05:13] battle amen that's my heart's cry it's a
[2:05:18] new year and I'm not one for for New
[2:05:20] Year's resolutions you know like
[2:05:22] somebody said that's the things that
[2:05:23] people make so they can break them and
[2:05:26] that's all it is is resolutions and
[2:05:27] resolutions won't get us anywhere but a
[2:05:30] sincere heart a humble heart a Hungry
[2:05:33] Heart that's what God responds to a
[2:05:36] broken and a contrite spirit somebody
[2:05:38] that says Lord I want to come up
[2:05:40] higher Lord I want to make less of
[2:05:43] myself and More Of You Lord I want a
[2:05:45] testimony that I've never been able to

[2:06:13] matters how you look at things what you

[2:06:20] what matters most is there's a cry in
[2:06:22] your heart there's a cry in your heart
[2:06:25] cuz that's what he's looking at is the
[2:06:27] cry in your heart and that's the
[2:06:29] response that we'll get is when we have
[2:06:30] the right cry in our heart
