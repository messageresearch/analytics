the lord god bless us and we thank the lord again for the privilege of getting you back to fellowship amen by the grace of god and understand it just recently within the last three or four days that there's been a number of churches in certain areas i'm not sure whether it's the united states or canada i think some is canada and where they have been taking a tremendous stand against government regulations which were forbidding groups to meet at so many uh to meet together i i'm not sure i don't think that their emphasis of putting your emphasis on a church but just general gatherings you know for here for there for somewhere else and of course that includes church gatherings and so there's been a tremendous challenge i think by certain preachers to the to the to the authority to legal authorities like policemen and so on so i if you saw it online in the internet where you saw you saw the the religious people challenging the police amen amen and of course some were arrested and there was a pastor also that ended up in prison and he's in jail because of his his movements and what he's done and what he said and so on but again there is i believe that there is a limit to it but the bible does say you know you render the caesar the things that are caesar's and to god the things that are gods and so on and but again they had to consider fully consider you know why the government would would say that you're not allowed to gather and and again it's not just churches but it's the number of people in the church and so that's that's what they were facing and that's what they were challenging the police on and i understand that some of it is still going on right now and of course there was uh okay that's a message from brother matthew i guess it's amazing the world we live in america amen but if we can get that but i'll tell you where we can get a message from god even better amen oh yeah and as he's conveying that god's conveying his message to us amen you look at it and read it there we can look at it and read it here amen or we can look at each other and read it amen read the word in your life amen amen so i pray the grace of god amen that brother sister that we are we are reflecting the correct revelation of the word the correct revelation of god and what god has done what god is doing right on through amen so we're not going to lead him astray we're going to lead them in the straight and narrow way amen by the grace of god and we pray the grace of god that uh what those individuals and religions and and as far as i know that most of them are not not denominational they're non-denominational i trust by the grace of god that they're going to give the right revelation in their lives amen they're going to act and react the right way as jesus would act or react amen oh we got to do this we got to do that oh yeah and oh yeah but and we feel that it's it's the law challenging us and stopping us well that's just to a certain point you know when the prophet didn't warn us that the hour's coming when we wouldn't be allowed to get together but i don't but that won't be because of colby 19 that won't be because of this issue or that issue no no it'll be because of our faith and i believe the the the power and the anointing behind it will be a religious power oh yeah not political it'll be religious so and and we know where it's coming from but that hour will come someday but basically we they'll try what they'll try to do is they'll try to get us to to move in fellowship with with the churches out there you know not not down non-denominational groups but they want you to want you to identify with a denominational group you know because there's so many thousands nonprofit organizations that are registered with the government and no doubt the government is trying to reduce those things for a reason they got a reason and so the hours coming when they're going to try to force us to unite with regular denominations not not not just ourselves and they'll feel that that our spirit is wrong our spirit is not right because we want to associate with this church or that church but again let's understand that by the grace of god that we are we're not denying what's going on out there in the church world as i said don't look down at them because some of the many of them are going to be outside the city but the bride is in the in the city with the bridegroom amen that's where that's where she's going to reign with him sit with him in his throne and so on so but again the rest of them would be outside the city so thank god for that revelation amen and his god giving us the understanding to keep our attitude and our spirit right toward those out there amen and i'll tell you i've met some of them that have that have been very tremendous in their faith oh yes very good real good and that they would even put some professing believers to shame when it comes to faith so god help us brother to understand what god has done and what god is doing amen and so he's calling out the bride and as i said my first sermon that i preached when i was just in my late teens and i i preached against it i said stop it i said you can't do that and i and i like i said i chose the scripture in matthew chapter 5 there the last few verses and to highlight where you love them that love you what reward have you and so on you've got to have a right attitude right spirit toward everybody amen by the grace of god and and to keep to keep that spirit right and so as i said and when i finished that sermon the lord did confirm it when our when our brother bill our brother burns spoke in tongues which is unusual for him that's very rare and uh in in his life and uh and then brother bill again interpreted it and confirmed that what i said was the truth confirmed that what i said wasn't me was god amen and because i was noticing a lot of people looking down their noses at those denominational people don't do that amen no siree don't don't do it and just keep your attitude right your spirit right thank god for what you got amen but again you gotta see i've repeated it a number of times where the angel rebuked brother branham oh yeah he did what for because he would see these women out there with slacks on and with this and dressed this way in that way and so on and and he was condemning them and you can condemn what they do but not don't condemn them and the angel told them don't do that don't call them rickies and requests he said some of them are my children oh they are yes some of them are my children again it's those outside the city by the grace of god amen but when it comes to the the what god has done especially in this hour it's the it's the climax of his ministry and his message and it's the calling out of the bride that's why he said that now he said the bright word not everyone is going to hear the message not everyone's going to believe the message but the bride because that's the ones that ordained to be a part of the break room amen but again the others they're there and and the prophet did highlight that he said the whole world is going to hear the hear the the witness of jesus the testimony of jesus amen right and amen and and they're those that are going to be outside the city again we can refer to them as foolish virgins because again uh certain of the brethren have emailed me from a different part of the world wanting to know you know concerning who the foolish virgins are and versus the wise virgins and the prophet has highlighted the wise virgin sir is the bride amen but the foolish virgin they're not bright but he said they're going to be they're going to be in in glory they're going to be in heaven amen he said they're going to be outside the city the bride's in the city so i trust by the grace of god we have that revelation of what god is doing amen and that and the reason that god has separated us unto himself amen separating a bride unto yourself by the grace of god so just just keep keep our attitude right keep our spirits right amen toward everybody and brother if our attitude or spiritual is is right toward them how much more is it right toward the bride of christ amen our brothers and sisters in the faith and also the proud of god was sitting in a restaurant and we remember that i hope and that in a table across from him there was this woman and this man and the woman was very worldly and so i want to come she had her hair cut and she had to watch the clothes shed on and again the prophet was was looking at her with with uh criticism and putting her down as it were and the angel said come here move aside and he an angel took him over to the corner there somewhere by the door and showed him you know he said see he said this is you he said you'd be lost but for the grace of god amen surely and he said don't you don't you have that spirit toward her amen and so the angel rebuked him rebuked and rebuked him and he humbled himself he repented and he came back and witnessed to the lady amen and she came and gave her heart to the lord that's right she did during during the service maybe that it was that he was having in that area amen see you don't know but god knows that's why he's telling us keep your spirit right keep your attitude right because there goes you but for the grace of god amen so god's grace to us brother keep your attitude and spirit right and and uh toward all the brethren to know toward those that are around us with us and so on and again and again toward those out there as i said i met that gentleman uh and fellowship with him in uh uh in he was in anakin church and he was anakin but he was really enthused just to have fellowship with me and just to talk about the word and praise the lord and oh yeah he threw him it was wonderful and he said thank you brother and as i said when when he was nearing the end of his journey he called for me amen so god rest his soul amen and he he did end up in in palpa care in one of the hospitals a man and the lord called him home amen took him i believe all right and he was the one that came in and just give me tithes uh checking the envelope brother he said god bless you he said you've been a you've been a blessing to me and he said it's good you've helped me with with what you've talked about in the word and so on amen and so again this just before the lord called gnome there was a couple of times that i i visited with him and had fellowship with him and prayer with him and as i said oh yeah he had a bible and he had pieces there underlined this underlined that underline and he like he said he says his family didn't like it he said when they come to visit him because they knew his bible was going to be open on the table yeah and he said all conversations go back to the word amen sure that was good praise the lord so god bless him so again if he's not bride he's going to be outside the city and as i said i'll find the scripture someday where he when he was in his house in in his bed rather for the last time and and he had this scripture there his bible there and he said oh yeah he said go here go there and he said you read that yeah i said that's me he says where i am amen i said i believe it amen amen i believe it brother if you could see yourself in the word in glory in glory not just here on the earth but in glory amen he said well yeah i'm going to be with that group and it was it was one of the groups and wrote in the book of revelation i said that's you i said brother now it wasn't bride but it was those outside the city they're going to be there thank god amen show grace of god because if we don't have the right attitude here toward them we won't we won't be there to have a right attitude so maybe they'll go in and and and we should be shut out and i'll tell you there's a lot of believers won't make it because of their attitude and their spirit god help us by the grace of god amen so the lord bless us and i just wanted to say tonight that the lord willing will be playing a tape by brother branham on faith and it is faith without works is dead and the prophet has highlighted this a number of times in his ministry but i think there's about 20 odd sermons that he preached on faith so we trusted good tonight we'll hear what what what we need to hear regarding faith come on check your own faith do you have the faith that pleases god there's many with this faith this faith but it doesn't please god it's not what god's looking for so i pray grace that we have the faith that pleases god amen and i tell you one of the attributes or the attributes of of the faith that pleases god is the faith that's got a right attitude and a right spirit amen bear with me amen let me read you the scriptures that i read when i preached that first sermon i guess over 50 years ago amen and he said ye have heard that it had been said that thou should love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but i say unto you love your enemies amen love your enemies if you love them you got a right attitude toward them amen love your enemies bless them that curse you amen do good to them that ate you oh brother god help us god's judging you by this word tonight amen so do you love your enemies do you bless them that curse you do you do good to them that ate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you amen praise the lord that ye may be the children of your father amen your heavenly father that ye may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust amen the rain we need to bring forth the fruit for if ye love them which love you what reward have you and this is jesus talking he said do not even the publicans the same and he said if you salute your brethren only what do ye more than others do not even the public consult amen and he said be there for perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect and brother we're not we're not referring to the perfection when it comes to the physical all everything we're doing or not doing whatever no brother it is not a sinless perfection but it is the perfection of your attitude and your spirit and your motives and your objectives amen oh yes the brother is highlighting the fact that that is not not sinless maturity no no it's the maturity of your brain maturity of of your your of you being a son of god amen amen you're mature so that you're not going to believe the and treat the word like like a baby no you're you're a mature son and daughter of god amen you're going to have a right attitude and a right spirit you're gonna have a right motor right objective amen you're not there to go and condemn this one and condemn that one kick this one out kick that one out no you leave it all with the lord amen and you put yourself under god's control and he said it's not sinless perfection he said in the in this passage the father's kindness not sinlessness is the point in the question not that he said it's your attitude having a right attitude and the right spirit by the grace of god amen so i pray that we by the power of the holy ghost that we got that perfection of jesus in us amen and i'll tell you this brother if you got it they will out there recognize it oh yeah they'll they'll still know oh yeah and i know that that that oys unbelievers so to speak they they've they have seen the difference in in believers they've seen oh this one is oh i know that person he got he's different you know he's nice she got a nice attitude and so on or she's got a nice attitude and so on you know we don't believe like they believe but but they still treat us good oh yeah they recognize that and and yet it's like all due respect it's like one time a a gentleman was in a bank and and the teller was talking to him and eventually came out that he was a believer and that he attended a certain church and now like i said i've been in a bank and dealt with a bank and developed with the tellers to the point where they sometimes when i would go in they would approach and say excuse me would you please pray for my granddaughter would you please pray for this one and pray for that one yeah tellers in the bank have requested me to pray for because they said this one is sick or this one needs this and that one needs i said okay i said i'll pray for oh yes we know so we thank you yeah tellers in the bank so yeah and yet there's a yeah and all due respect one of the tellers one time was ministering to a believer doing something to a believer and they said oh what church you go to and he said oh i go to a certain church what no you don't go to that church do you yes he said she said and she named the pastor she said he's not your pastor is it yes he said oh she said he's not he is not a christian his attitude and his spirit she says not right no and she knows that and she she was telling this gentleman this brother to be a brother to us you know about it so brother sister see that that sister that that lady that teller will rise in judgment against that brother oh yeah so i pray grace brother that we're not leaving the wrong impressions in the eyes of the of those people oh yeah so i pray grace that your life is going to rise in judgment against theirs they're at your attitude your spirit amen grace don't show off humble yourself i'll tell you this if there's any anything that that the seed of god is they're humble amen they're not they're not elevating and pushing themselves up not by any means but by the grace of god you want to give the glory to jesus amen turn with me if you would before we go into the tape and the tape will be about an hour and that's all about an hour or a little less so the lord bless us determine me to the book of jude and it's the last book there before read the book of revelation jude amen in verse 20 but ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost amen keep yourselves in the love of god amen looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life and of some have compassion making a difference and others save with fear pulling them out of the fire aiding even the garments spotted by the flesh now unto him that is able to keep you from falling and to present you thoughtless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy to the only wise god our savior amen be glory and majesty dominion and power both now and forever and ever amen god bless his word keep our attitude right our spirit right amen toward all that we will truly be a witness in the judgment for them for the glory of god amen and also to ask you to continued to remember brother tom snow in prayer and his daughter called us again and we contacted them and they've contacted us expressing their appreciation for our prayers they said and his daughter judy she said brother gerald she said thank you for praying thank you for your prayers she said and she was telling me the what what her father was like in his condition and it it shocked even me it shocked the family because yeah it was yesterday sometime now the family did have him home but they didn't the doctor didn't want that and uh and he went home he lay home for a few hours and and then they had to get him um an ambulance to take him back to the hospital and he was in the emergency for quite a while but yesterday or the day before they have taken him uh to uh to a ward he's on a ward now where there's another two or three patients so we give god the glory she said he's been eating and he's been helped and he'd been walking and so on she said he's doing very good so thank thank you thank you all for your prayers amen it's his daughter judy so we'll keep keep brother tom in prayer and knowing brother tom over the years he's been he's been very he's been very very very determined to stand to stay with the word very determined to share the word amen to be a witness to the word praise the name of the lord and of course since he's been supporting the assembly here we have visited him a number of times when we go out that way and go in and the last time that he wasn't well you know it like it seemed like he wasn't well mentally to know basically who we were but his daughter told me today or a couple days ago or yesterday that uh his attitude is different and he knows his wife he knows his children and so on and he can talk to them but at the same time one of his sons ed snow i think is he when he goes in he always goes in and prays for him and of course when you pray for brother tom amen brother he's not that far gone and he's got his hands up and praising the lord amen he got his hands up and pray praying himself amen so god bless our brother tom snow and god bless sister shirley his wife amen and god bless the family so his daughter judy has expressed appreciation for our prayers she said thank you thank you she said we appreciate that amen so god bless them as we continue with our brother praise the lord amen let's go to the tape again faith without works is dead and brother god's looking for works in your life amen by grace god bless you [Music] happy to be back again tonight to be here in the service and trust that it'll mean much to every one of us someone denies we might receive glory to himself or his goodness i'm sure if we're just all believing with one heart and one of hearts god will drain don't you believe that [Music] as far as being physically tired no it's uh i guess you would call it mentally tired or just you might just this thing just goes away you don't know where it's gone but it goes our god is our strength who we trust in today has been quite a day i've been praying much today concerning the meeting so many people sending telegrams and calling in knowing that i'm to be home friday and they they want to know who could be the first one to go to you understand outline is it's just constantly on the move and you don't get any time of rest only way i get dressed is when i don't go home and just go somewhere else i wait a little while then when you do one makes you feel bad just making the meetings and then you could get the praise for a little children you just seem like you can hear them at night calling for prayer mothers and crippled people and what that is that's the cry of their prayer awning down okay they're saying i just sometimes want to go up in the mountains i have a picture of the audience i set it down maybe but i have a tree just kneel down and just pray god will heal them as well no one can enjoy [Music] [Music] maybe start out walking nothing can help you they give me medicines and everything but just it couldn't stop me about seven or eight years and i was just eating i was just trying to look at the table and see the people's deep [Music] occasionally [Music] and work all day long and go over to eat [Music] once walked around graves big glasses on just sometimes it gets smells but it's just not too neat he has he's so blind way about 118 20 pounds and the snakes down that's all [Music] god be praised i eat anything i want to just enjoy it and i'm so thankful for it and feel good 153 pounds i just very thankful when i was a little boy i was irish of course my conversion didn't change that human election someone said you think there's any change for an irishman [Music] the box right here we had a just a fall city championship there i bounced a whole lot from that and i got to uh getting up to work and fighting around five things i want fifteen straight professional fights and i lost my 16 billion money from west virginia davis going down to arena i bought it i want to give a draw and then give him to sleep because really right he did it first time in my life i ever looked up to god to make a promise i wasn't sure of myself when i went and i just said well if you just let me come to this sister i won't have no more and i'm so happy tonight that there's so much flaw in boston we have a great master and we can just preach the gospel full and free and let it go when chips fall wherever they wish god takes care of the rest now i want to make this statement i've been just a little larry about saying it but tonight i feel just a little bit dressed up i don't know where you noticed or not but that's what the sister gave me i appreciate it very much thank you very much god bless that sister thank you all people sending me nice ties shirts stop i was a little afraid to say anything about the platform maybe somebody thought that i would get the wrong impression i was just saying it's just because maybe oh no i don't don't think that but if it's so appreciated i just couldn't let the people do things like that then let me not mention something you know some of them her address or i couldn't from the depths of my heart and i'll say this my dear sister and to all you others you'll never give anything to anyone in your life to appreciate it anymore i do that's right i do and the bible said in so much as you have done unto the least that's me of my little one you have done it unto me he who received the righteous man in the name of a righteousness and received the righteous man's reward whichever receive the prophet in the name of the prophet to receive the prophets reward and i trust that god will return it to you [Music] i'm sure if god lets you keep my right mind [Music] [Music] that's where i go i trust that god while preaching his institute will let me win thousands of people and i pray that the holy spirit was so annoying that those people who even come by and they haven't judged arkansas to touch the eel like glorious power in glory when life is all finished our earthly journey is over i hope i'm standing near when i see him put a great white robe on you i'll bow my head thankful for loving you and his rights [Music] my friend [Music] one time i thought it was right to receive a present someone give you brother sharon man corrected me on that he said brother i hate to correct you on anything but you're mistaken there that you've called those people but not receiving their friends you call them to lose their reward he said it's more blessed to give than it is to receive and he told me in his story i hear it i just believe i tell this right now just come to my mind for a moment john d sheriff meeting arizona one of the business managers of the campaign many of his media no doubt did anybody hear what happened over this year the dean of the college was just talking to me a long distance and he wanted to go very fine man brother stanley managed her brother's family from the gods revivalist he's at my house waiting for me now and he and brother raymond t ritchie during him having him from houston texas like belongs to the church members of god they had this table there and so brother cher he was born of a fellow that just had very much of the world's goods his father was a very poor man and he was very rowdy and he left his mother and john should about 15 years ago was selling apples at a nickel piece out in front of him like this in plain bush missouri apple a little this could have a heart to take care of his mother and he had an impediment of speech he couldn't talk at all you go to talk and just stand good well but he began to seek the lord when he was born and all the boys was running out to different places with young ladies he said lord i i'm going to trust you i i i'd be awful out trying to talk to a young lady but i want to be married to have children and i'm going to serve you and you give me your wife and he committed to the lord the age of about 25 if he could have passed every woman buying in the world he couldn't have got a better one than what he does god's history lovely little companion but one great thing he loved children as well she was barren is married for many many years six seven eight ten years no children he cut concrete on the street twenty five cents an hour make a living and they'd save their money and they bought a little three-room house i think it cost about fifteen hundred dollars back in time of the depression and they've paid and paid and paid drive to pay so they paid all of it all but just about time they got all paid off it had a revival in me and there was a man by the name of dr sutton don't know whether you know him or not the bertha canadian a gospel gospel preacher he came down there to see him and he was staying in the tourist game and the lord appeared to brother's shirt one night in a dream he said julian take your silverware and your clothes and your wife and leave your home and turn that over to the brother stuff thank god after about 10 years of hard labor in the depression save and describe it and the lord told him to turn that place over that dr sutton which was a well-known minister a shirt all right laura went for his little companion said honey the lord has spoken to me and told me to turn our house or just take our silverware on our clothes and turn the house over to doctor sutton when he went home he said all right here she believed in her husband that the lord said you do that god's got something else for us to do so she he turned all he had now and he didn't have no place to take his wife that night and they found a tourist camp it cost 75 cents and his state of truth came that night he's making 25 cents hours cutting concrete on the street that's right working daily work great big man weighs about 225 and about a week later some rich lady told me if she would move some of the things back in her garage if he wanted to live in her garage up towards campbell's back mountain you know where this place is have a real aristocratic country that you if you'll keep my yard trend of it when you come in get the grass watered and so forth that you can live in my garage free he moved up there without one thing got some boxes got him a spring laid on the floor got him a mattress put on him and his wife left there the brother said brother sherry i don't he said the lord has blessed me to do that that's all right and he went on and he was that way about a year lived a good christian life and finally the lady that he lived with was the vaulted millionaire woman and she seen his honesty he was a christian just like daniel down in fashion she swears to him one day she said john said you know what the lord spoke to me last night in a dream and told me that i have to loan you ten thousand dollars to go in business watch this i couldn't talk said ladies i i can't even talk i'll never make a business man she said but the lord told me to do this and here's the check he said well i i i i i want ten thousand dollars laying on my no line so she says but the lord said for me to give it to you i've noticed you've been a good honest man then you read the bible and i got me a bible it was written and the lord told me to give you a check loyal to you for ten thousand dollars to go and listen well he took the check he didn't know what to do and he went on and one evening he's walking up you see a little five room house for sale for two thousand dollars or he went down there and passed the check and bought it for two thousand dollars and went out there him and his wife began to knock the classroom off of that place and replanted it at night him and his wife working together he plastered up the house mixed it around and further sales sign up on it if he got three thousand made money and he sold it for six thousand the day john's shirts worth a half a million dollars has been about six seven years ago since it started worth a half a million dollars he's the father of three fine little children all right he said brother what what have doctors wouldn't take us what god told me he wanted to be and now he said that said lord whenever i actually do a program he said i don't owe the old armed roads range houses the ultimate thunderbird ranks there one of the greatest careers in he said all these things and he said well i've got more money and i know what to do with and god's getting the five little girls then a little part that a little girl that's reason tonight a little baby just recently born his wife had been there for all these years and now is that any children just doing all the happy family and he said when i come to phoenix he said went up the meeting on that you said lord is that what you're talking about and then he said come to me says you every word gives her time to the lord of everything he makes i'll follow by just bless so it is more now if you want to write just right john these sheriffs people there's only look at you and actually the testimony of yourself not explaining tracks and everything scattered the gospel everywhere will probably be with us shortly again in this campaign it's more blessed he is than it is uh that isn't saying if you let god tell you what to do when god tells you if mrs jones over there is a weird woman and needs some some clothes and he speaks to you to go help that with a woman you go to help [Music] is that right we came into the world naked we go out of the world naked as jokes said the lord gave the lord taken away blessed be the name of the lord hi everybody be reverend be prayerful and god will bless us i'm sure i'm going to ask you something tonight if you will for me while i reach you maybe i'll wait till i reach [Applause] there is a certain man in this city i just heard the news just now that if i would return back be here to sunday afternoon and sunday he would send some big auditorium somewhere to have a sunday afternoon god bless you if you've got that much heart for the sick people your blessing will come to you just the same thing the season means now in saint james the third the second chapter and the 21st first this would almost look like a contradiction in this picture but there is no contradictions in this picture you know the you've heard people say that scripture contradicts itself it does not for 10 years there was a challenge placed on my platform i pulled it that any person who could show a contradiction in god's word and should not be straightened by the word of all the god is mingled up that's right it's all broke up and placed in here that's reason seminary theological schools will never be able to anoint its hit from the eyes of the wise ingredient and will be revealed debate such as will learn you have to it tells me how much doing you got a certain little boy down in kentucky holds the country where i came from someone senator they said brother bennett what florida kentucky you're from oh my way down in kentucky where they way down don't even have roads in there [Applause] a little boring about the second grade he got up there one day he's the teacher the lord called me to preach [Applause] the lord called me to preach i guess the boy was 15 16 years old and said while the teacher said the very eyes forget about it well he went to the principle of school oh they couldn't let him preach but the few months after that some great minister came through with some great deed to his name so they permitted him to have the school so he preached at a two-week meeting never had one conversion so the boy father thought the boy really was all the greeks he went to the principal said well if you let him have it why don't you let my boy have a try so they went down there and he they didn't have it they all everybody came out to hear this boy that night he got up there he couldn't read the bible they had to get somebody to read the bible for him and he got the preaching but when he got to preaching that little cell style teacher along with about 50 others found herself in the order weeping their way through the cries okay that's right and there was a real revival broke out in that part of the country and literally hundreds came to christ why it doesn't take the great education it takes a full surrendered heart to jesus christ no matter how illiterate you are so food will not air in the way is that right so listen closely now as we read the word why not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar this townhouse faith with his work and by work or faith made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed god and it was refuted unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god you see then how that by work a man is justified and not by faith only likewise also was hard justified justifiable work when she received the messages and sent them out another way far as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without work is dead also now the first thing it looks like paul was speaking in romans the fourth chapter justifying abraham by faith and james is justified him by work but it does not contradict paul was speaking of what god saw in abraham and james was speaking what man saw in abraham paul was speaking of what god saw in abraham in genesis 6 20 told him that he was going to have this child by sarah and abraham believed god it was imputed into him he believed the promise that's what god saw and then james speaking was speaking of what man saw and genesis 22 or abraham offered up isaac see what faith is what faith you have that's what god sees but what your works is that's what your neighbors see see show me your work by your faith without your faith and i'll show you my words by my faith see notice i believe that this audience here has faith i believe that but i believe you're afraid to turn it loose on work or i i believe that you would just let your faith loose now as far as i know got two more knots and last night even tonight i'm trying my best to hold back just to close the candle and keep from straining too hard then the last two nights if god be my helper i'm going to throw my whole heart everything i got to deserve but i like to get this to you while i'm speaking because probably tomorrow night and next night i don't even want to say nothing just had prayer line get ready and come on the platforms we'll pray for the sake but if you would do this dear friend if you would give god a chance now you believe i'll ask you if you believe you say yes is that right if you believe you say yes then if you believe you've got to act like you believe isn't that right you've got to act like you believe now notice if you could believe say for instance i was at the altar as the sinner now the only way that you will ever be able to obtain anything from god is by faith you all understand that for the whole christian armor is faith love joy peace long suffering goodness weakness gentleness patience all the unseen and we as christians we do not look at what we see we look at what we believe see what i mean we believe it before there's any natural evidence the virgin mary when the angel of god met her instead of hail mary blessed art thou among women and began to tell her that she was going to give birth to a child without knowing any man being a virgin she accepted the angel's word and she began to testify and tell people that she was going to have a baby without knowing a man before there was any natural evidence at all she just believed it and she acted upon what she believed now that's what you have to do to get well now once there was no one to tell me what to do by gift when i was at mayo brothers rochester when they looked at me the best doctor in the world and said you haven't even got any kind of a chance but one scripture that is hebrews 3 1 i've seen that that he is the high priest of our confession he's sitting at the right hand of the father to make good anything that we confess that he has done but he cannot do nothing for us until first we confess that he has done it and act upon it see when you whatsoever things you desire jesus sees whatsoever things you desire when you pray believe you receive it that's the order see you believe now you receive it and it shall be given to you that's the future or he's the high priest to make the intercession for your confession and he cannot give you until first you confess he has nick can he save you no matter how much you cried you could come to the altar and cry and pull your hair and scream and say god god have mercy i believe in old-fashioned repentance but you can say that and repent until year after year and you have never been saved until you believe in your heart that he had saved it and raised up and confessed it if you confess me before man i'll confess you before my father and the holy angels is that true i see you cannot be saved only by faith and confession is that right now he will make good anything that he died for and here you said did he die for my healing as god he was wounded for our transgression bruised for our iniquity the chapter of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed the 80 percent of his ministry was divine healing 80 of his ministry was on the miraculous side showing the people that the supernatural god was working in human flesh and my brother's sister may i say this is reverend that's exactly what he's doing in this tent now trying to get to the people but if he was standing here tonight dressed in these clothes he could not do any more for you than what he's doing here night after night is that right or he could not he could tell you what you were what you'd done what was wrong with you but you could not eat it until you believed it and when you would believe it the father would receive it to him and he'd tell you go your way your sins are forgiven and so forth is that where he acted in his ministry and listen to his own sacred words coming from his sacred lips he said very very i say to you the son can do nothing in himself but what he sees the father doing the father makes known to the son and the son speaks what the father said well that is he was standing here and you'd accept god as your healer and you'd be healed then the sun would reveal of you your sins are gone you're leading his right now isn't that just exactly what the son of god is still doing working through mankind his instrument oh are you i wish i could have words that i could just give this to you to think of a people's time where people do anything in the world for you and you don't know exactly what you need and know what you want and how can i get it to you see and if i could oh my i would stand here and say right now if i had some little capsules that i could give everyone it would all be healed and i know it can work hit those capsules then i would have to take one of them with my nose and start pushing it from here the plum is so high down the road going down through the street pushing the mind over knowing that that would any of you people when i got the columbus that i had no knowledge i would start tonight that's right uh god knows where i'm telling the truth or not i would start down the street you know i want my father glorified and how i want him to be magnified i want all the think of that now how do we get healed in brother bran the first thing you cannot be healed you're just making yourself life in air until in your heart you believe the dream or if i remember you can't play with satan he knows whether you believe or not don't you try just to make out you really believe and i think friends if you would get down to business with god he'd come to business with you oh how you could just get that thing look then by faith you look to the high priest of your potential you are healed just by the same merits that you're saved by you're saved by the merits of christ is that right not not what's your own merit there's nothing you can do to be states only believe on him i could go to heaven in my righteousness could you go to heaven in your righteousness god would receive it but he will receive the righteousness of his son and if we believe on him as the scripture says believe that he is and will confront him he will work the righteousness [Applause] you'll go right straight back to your sin again like a hall to a squalor and a dog food sign that's fine but as long as you're willing to could you imagine taking a hulk from a swallow you could take a whole guy and bring this hog in and rub it up with style sodium whatever you want to do uh do that painting on their toenails like women do on their fingers and mix it up with with holes on and put it on a hardwood floor and give it great nuts for breakfast and that hulk would die you take him and turn [Music] but you put a lamb out there and that water it'll bleed and grind somebody gets you now if you want to keep the hog out of the water [Music] that's best way to keep the center out of the things of the world change the nature from a sinner to a christian and that can only be done through that great powerful work i see prostitutes sometimes this is the first time we ever had the big auditorium for the maniacs i'll tell you a little story i walk into a room not long ago i looked at her i couldn't detect anything just right so i thought i'd sit down talk to her she said are you connie startled i said yes ma'am people here she said well brother and i will give you my story i said all right and she begins to talk she said when i was a little child i was rearing the catholic home she said but i got out with a bunch of girls one time they got me and i got the drink around the lunch boys i become a professional drunk by the children and said when i begin to drink both and i begin to be a prostitute on the street selling the morals of her wife and she said they taking me up and put me in a good shepherd's home and said when i served the term in there so of course while i was in there i had to do that said when i got out i went right back to it again and so then the law picked me up and gave me a two years and a woman's prison and said then i'd come out again and said that he advised me that some people said hours to go to church a different church a protestant people and told me to come to the protestant church and and said i did and i went and joined the protestant church she called the name of the church and she said i go right back out and have the same desires that i ever had and she said i've tried i prayed i've tried brother grantham she said i've done everything and i know how and tried everything that anybody ever told me but she said i just can't keep from good i said look sister and i began to feel what was wrong i said you don't want to do that as a tree or a woman as you are you expect someday to be married and have a husband and babies like all real women she said yes sir i said you could be like that you know you'd be invisible to yourself uh this race to your children and why uh what all you believe and she said that's right i said you don't want to do that do you she said no sir i said there's something that makes you do that isn't it she said yes sir i said as old nation as it may seem it's the devil on your sister i said now your doctor might not want to believe that and so forth but it's a devil let's make you it forces you to do that against your will she said that is right she said i always thought that was right i said now look if you will believe in the lord and will pray god she said i've done that brother i said i'm not talking about what you have done i mean now and you just do as i tell you to do and you'll be free from that she said well can you free me i said no man only jesus christ she said well i've already come to him and give my life i said this to just a moment when you you just do as i tell you will you she said i said let us pray and we got out and prayed and she was crying and she raised up you know she said to brother branham i'm i'm going to go out tonight and she said i'm going to try my best i'm saying you'll go right straight back again i said it's not over she said but i have con i've done all that i know what to do i said but it's not yet there's got to be something to pull that nature from you and she said she said well i'm afraid of christ you're going to cry she got out and i got out of playing with her ask god to make that demon turn her loose and why i did that laid hands upon her laid right there with her head down like this for a few moments exactly she turned around she looked at me in those great sick velvet eyes she said brother random something's happened to me i said now it's over that's right now it's over she said i just feel well i don't know i said there isn't enough devils in the world could upset you right now if you're squatting like you're going down that's been a little over a year ago the woman is married tonight with a lovely home never drink from that time or had no desire to drink or to smoke or anything what was it there was no medicine she touched but by the supernatural divine power of the transformation that was over the power of jesus christ struck her and ugly all the desire and the iniquity and as she would die tonight her soul's as flat as anybody else that's right or she comes out in her marriage but in the merits of the lord jesus three danger and the god listen she was a character all the police courts records and everything gun mall no notice but tonight she's a lovely woman to be a mother peddle down to a good god paid christians what a difference what did that were everything was the law failed were the houses of the corrections sale where medical science failed the blood of jesus christ tucked up and can't fail why by faith while the power of god that would change a prostitute to a saint a drunkard to a righteous woman while that by the same power will take any cancer death dumb blind cripples for the same blood from the same man on the same day a tone for your healing that atoned for your salvation is that the truth he was wounded for your transaction with inside your heel the blood run exactly off of the same man at the same day is that right how did that how do you get it not because you think but because you something strikes you that you know you got it look at your friends let me give this illustration i might have done it before what color is that shirt it's why anyone who's got side knows that church one you had five sentences about it these days field mail here now none of those senses will declare god when god made many nations in his image his spirit man and he's putting in five senses to contact his earthly home not to contact god with those senses don't declare god they declare the earthly home where the man had to contact his earthly home he had to see faith deal smell here but faith is the substance that things hope for the evidence that they not seen you do not see it patient see it smell it or you're what you believe it see what i mean now if every person in here is this boy sitting here the lady sitting here who are the young ladies saying here i'm talking to crippled people and here and there and the people's got diseases if you believe that you're free right now and so you were so sure that you were healed just as sure as you say that's why it's over i'll assure you if you'll get that type of faith god almighty will stick to me and tell you your heels will reveal it see friends therefore you see i'm sorry away for myself it's not me i'm just if only i couldn't breathe you could breathe without god could you let your spirit lead you you're gone is that right god holds your life in his hands is that true you can't make yourself live you live by god just the same as i can't stand until god says something i have no control of it he says it when he says it then it's true then it's true god confirms it with signs and wonders have faith place your faith in christ now it doesn't matter if i recall a reverend markham or one of these ministers up to the platform to pray for you if you adjust according to your faith be it unto you that minister has just as much right to pray or any other minister or not only a minister but any christian who's the believer to pray with faith that our faith anybody who believes is praying for the that's right you said daddy look at that little girl i said pray for honey and the weaker two from that the child as well the child god hears anybody the first sin that was ever committed was doubting god's word is that right god said the day that every day you die they said surely you'll not die and he got eve to doubt god's word and go to seeking knowledge is that right today the whole world i have nothing against education but the world has got an educational program and they've got it down into the church and from the platform the minister has to be a certain degree or something or he has to have so many uh degrees or anything or you can be a welcome in a platform you let me give them some of these aristocratic churches and use my kentucky words to use from scary investors just kick me out but look brother the kingdom of god don't come by education that's right it comes by a surrendered heart to god and i'm not trying to support my injuries but i'm saying this my dear friend that is simple child faith don't speak for knowledge now you're thinking i'm throwing it out to doctors i believe that doctors i believe in hospitals institutions whatever can help anybody god and more but there's not one of them that ever did heal anybody and they don't confess their best to heal somebody they claim to assist nature god is the healer if i cut a plate in my hand as i go just unite the gold all the medicine in the world would heal at him if i die and it involved me throw that hand up put all kind of messages on it 50 years but they would still be there medicine doesn't heal you take the life out of there there's no healing life is a healer and life is god jesus came that you might have abundance of life more life than what your normal life is to believe on i'm him excited but i know what i'm speaking of that the right mental attitude towards any promise of god will bring it to pass there it is you say why are you talking about it are you anybody you're an addition here is the first and only foundation for divine healing or anything from god is the bible if you get over that you're out of god's will and divine healing is a hopeless purpose affair it isn't a few mystery words over somebody's hypnotizing it's the truth revealed through jesus christ that's right gifts of the spirit are brought down to anybody or other work it's the flag of flying over top of the building it's the appearance of the outside to attract the people in out of the rain see what i mean now if come from god if they are from god they'll testify of god and god will testify them is that true if you are sick free until you believe with all your you never get paid for something you just know you're gonna get it that's faith now if you believe that with all your heart expresses and passed on now you can believe it just as much as you wanted to if you didn't act on it you're set right there like a sinner would let the altar if you got all that praise great you said lord i know you're saying even i know you said he'll never get through until he rises and confesses and he stays with it and shows works with it james says justice and body is dead without the spirit soul is faith without work to say it no matter how much you believe and that's what i'm telling you friends these kids are brought in to make the presence of god real to you i guess i'm really happy the kids are brought to make the presence of god real to you then your faith will god and accept divine healing or salvation or whatever you have needed from god it is only through one thing or other anything that you have need of this earth journey god will supply if you have need of it he promised to supply your needs not your wants your needs and he's god and he can only get it to you as you believe him and gifts are to make you see that he shared in his attitude towards one is towards all amen oh my friends uh you may think that i'm an awful secure sort of a person but i wish i could just take the faith that's in my heart and spread it out to you right now you see what i mean there'll be a spontaneous something happening here that every person in the building you say [Music] the next day i'm moving a little farther the next day i'll move a little farther they said that foreign keep on with it stay with us great faith will bring you right now a little faith will bring out any house you'll stay with us before you see the ray of light follow it stay with it he'll bring you out oh my now jesus to identify himself he identifies not himself but his father the father that does the word now when philip comes he showed philip the family the people where the mules were tied where the money was the features now is that right now he said these things that i do greater initial unions you do the things that i do and steal more of them or i'm going to the father but i'll come again and be with you even if the spirit of an artist is in it we could paint a picture like an artist if the spirit of the danger was in us we'd have guns if the spirit of christ is in us we'll put our meetings do like christ we'll act like and then if that spirit's in there we'll have the things that i've had we'll have also see what i mean but you can't make yourself you've got to believe that's what i think you're doing that's where the mistake is [Applause] [Applause] wonder bring god's presence now you believe tonight with all your [Applause] heart [Applause] [Music] [Applause] how you have died [Applause] somebody has faith afraid to work with us let their faith eternally tonight unless we go home and go home rejoice happy be healed through jesus we'll follow down slow line down as you can see with the garter she had her umbrella walking up down the street screaming and going home so far i said god bless you my brother you believe because of all my heart i said go home now unless your face will make the hole well i do believe it i said why are you something like telling you what's in here see how easy it is he said well brother branson am i healed then i said yes i said you believe you are did you believe he heard my prayer he told me about these sins here when afraid of people bleeding and that's what we stand before the prayer do you believe that said yes sir i believe it's all my heart i said go on he said okay you started waiting you make sure you come back to your life and stop accepting it and i said well look i'm not talking about when you stop now you might have stopped for a week or ten days or three months or four months or two years i said abraham waited 25 years is that right you stripped your readers on i said you believe what i've told you that well i don't get it brother i said brother the angel of god who is declaring that i have told the truth told me this if i could get the people to believe me and be sincere when i pray oh [Music] about a month after that or two maybe about i'd say six weeks to be safely i was in another meeting you come out of the broadcast out of the studio which is in the auditorium and i just walked out there a son that goes down and says my sister each year down in houston or his vacation said he's had the paul said he dropped when he was a baby a few weeks ago and saying some divine dealer healed him and said he'd just be going around here and praise the lord he's healed and everything else like that but he's had the whole neighborhood tore up and said father was no different from the boy and said he said we told him now we're christian people he said but brother i i saw blind people see and dead people here these cripples walk away and says pastor he told me to believe it i was here he said he said the angel told him that and walking angel told him all the other things is right and that's right and i'm healed nobody's gonna make me see any different i'm just gonna stay right with him he just stepped on and he said he did that for several weeks and said he would come down and sit down in the church well thank god for humanity just shake it as hard as he could and said that people what he's got to reproach that the neighbors would lie at that they said it all was saying well i guess he's healed there he goes look at him shaking now isn't that a shame that somebody just sees somebody like that but isn't that a shame that neighbors say well that's all i ought to be arrested or to be run out of the country for telling that boy if i wasn't telling the truth i should it's the be both went on and she said when he come back the second time i forgot the case he said brother graham if you heal me i'll give you a hundred dollars right now i said brother you offered me a millionaire and he said what about that woman with the gardener i said her face and cry for healers and so she said well now he was doing that he said last saturday like friday afternoon he came in except one of our friends from out of the country with business and he come in shake it shut down the church that praised the lord for healing me and said my relative from the country said what's the matter with him because he got down there and some preacher got him all worked up slowly he was healed don't testify but watch five sides for calvary no sir he healed every person when he died a towel he did drive he had to accept it and when this um he sat down there he was shaking like god down to our church a very noted baptist church broadcast right here i said if he's a rich man he got so much money don't know what to do tell him to go down the street the first little rag is he goes you stay right with it if you believe it stay right there and don't choose fail that they stay right there and god will make it back all right i remember our promises tomorrow night i'm going to try as hard as they can we're going to have a prayer line we'll align the people up here all these people there that's got your prayers are you a great one just as long as i come and if any of you would think that god is already out there in the audience thank you all right a heavenly father you know my heart and you know what i have neither and don't know that i'm not here to make a show i'm only here to try to claim the promises that christ has given to the people and trying to explore salt cry to them that they might believe on him now you will grant me a record father that i have told the truth that in your word in the testimonies and so forth that's your year and i know that you're going to heal the people and please heavenly father help them to believe on and to be healed tonight granted their father and now to if there are these strangers in our gates and they might be here sick and maybe for the last time and this is why i asked this if you just show me something with somebody out there something that's wrong and will heal that person just as moses put his hand in his book and return it out will you do that for us tonight i'm waiting on you going forward now by faith believe that you are going to do this part in the name of that son we believe for salvation do we believe for healing god help us amen that you're not going to see brother gerald shaking our arm or hand let's believe the promise claim the promise amen as that from that first time that it it struck me that our brother chad when he met me out there in the in the in the vestibule he just came over laid his hands on me and prayed for me and believing for the healing i'll brother gerald's heart let's focus on healing not on what we're seeing what we're feeling focus on healing so brother if we don't oh my what a challenge it is now that if we don't believe for that how can we believe for salvation this is amazing we're we can't believe for the healing of the body here or there committing it to the lord and moving on believing claiming the promise then brother what about salvation because we're because there was we have been redeemed and we are being redeemed we've been redeemed at calvary amen spiritually we've become new creatures in christ jesus spiritually but now god has been working on another redemption coming to the climax of our bodies amen oh yeah so he he's redeemed me spiritually i'm a new creature in christ well praise the lord he's been working on me all done and on and through through his children all down through the ages and two thousand years as it were amen to bring us to a glorified body a new body we're new creatures in christ from the inside working out he's working out what he worked in amen and when he when he comes brings it to a complete to a climax where we enter into a resurrection and rapture amen we receive a new body like onto his glorious body praise the name of the lord praise the lord so we're looking for and believing for the physical redemption amen a new body amen and it's going to be real oh yes so we can touch this body touch this touch that touch something else but what he promised in the word the dead in christ shall rise first and then we which are light remain shall be cut up together with them to meet the lord in the air the prophet of god did say he said at the time of the resurrection of the rapture he said the dead in christ he said who are waiting on us he said they're going to appear to us oh yeah and that we're going to be changed into into our go back into our really glorified body and he said we'll go we'll go with them into the dimension they're in and he said we'll be there you know fellowshipping and fellowshipping and then he said after he used after time but we're going to be in eternity but it's going to be a space there that we're going to be there fellowshipping with one another and then he said oh they will live up and there's jesus. and he said why because brother he was in that body of flesh he came back in the pillar of fire the cloud of angels and there he said in his second coming oh he said there he is he said look at that at us all right sure that not that he will come he has come amen and the bride knows he's come when we look at what he's done in the in in a ministry of william branham we know well that was jesus because the prophet said see he said you don't recognize the other angel you don't know he said he's there and not only that he said i'm not the son of man he said he's the son of man and he said i'm only a son of man revealing the son of man by the grace of god amen so god help us brother really truly sincerely believe do we believe for our salvation well brother salvation is is not just spiritual it's it's it's come coming into a physical realm we've been redeemed physics spiritually and we're believing for the redemptions physically amen we're new creatures on in our nature in our soul and praise the lord he's working it all out so we're going to get into a glorified body we're going to be redeemed physically and brother that's the challenge for our faith now oh my god have mercy on us help us lord i really believe really truly believe lord for the new body a glorified body and again god's waiting on us that's what the prophet said god or the dead in christ are waiting on us to come to that place and god is waiting on us to come to that place where as the prophet said we could lift up our hands say lord i'm coming home amen so what so that heaven and glory and eternity is more real to us than time more real to us than the world we're living in now more real to us than the seats we're sitting in oh my god have mercy on us amen oh lord oh yes the lord that heaven means more to us than than this old earth right here amen that eternity is more real to us than time nor more precious to us we're hungry for it we're thirsting for it because that's where we come from and that's where we're going by the grace of god hallelujah to god be the glory so i pray lord in the name of jesus lord that we'll yield and yield and yield to that nature that eternal nature will yield and yield to that nature of new creatures in christ amen not just keep on living with the old nature no no keep on living with the new nature in control amen amen and oh yeah but brother we're still here yes i know but the closer we get to the change the more and more and more you're going to have control over that old nature and the more sensitive we're coming to the new we got to we got to see that's the trouble with the jews when when they came out of egypt and going into the promised land and look considering all that god did in egypt considering all that god did in delivering the the jews then bringing them from egypt right on up to the border of the promised land tree took them through the red sea he took them through this and that oh my he defended them here he delivered them here and so on and yet when they got to the border the red of the promised land went into the promised land come back out with the whoa what with their shorts oh yeah it's exactly like god said it was yeah they believed that but they let they allowed those that were living there to to to cause them to doubt oh yeah there's oh we can't go in and get it oh no we we're not able to do this and uh but joshua caleb and there they were all they said listen if god be with us who can be against us amen they believed the word by the grace of god come on this let's go in no couldn't go because those seed that came out the jews that came out no they they didn't believe they wouldn't trust god for that or got to the place even where they wanted to stone joshua and caleb there and just get rid of them get rid of them you know because why because they were focusing on this revelation this revelation get in get in get in and brother if we are we are the true servants of god the true servants of god the true ministry of god amen is full is going to focus on going in to possess eternity to get out of this body and into a glorified body amen oh yeah but again i i like i was on my thought on my heart and i'll share with you more detail concerning what is the ministry preaching what are they putting the answers on around the message god help us see as the problem of god moved from one phase to another and and the emphasis he was putting on this was going down he put the emphasis on this then he put the emphasis on this he put the emphasis on the resurrection on the rapture amen and again go to that message again on the rapture 1965 amen brother all that god was doing and all that god did amen was focusing on the rapture and to give us rapturing faith oh yeah prophet said that all that god has done they owe me the seven seals this revelation that revelation he says what is it all of it he says is to give us rapturing faith and he said the rapture has been going on all along it is coming now to perfection amen our brother sister we need to get out of here we need to get into eternity brother do you really want for me if you come from there you want to go back yeah because all that god has done and is doing in your life amen is giving preeminence to that nature that sin took away from us but god through the holy ghost get back to us amen because why because that's where we that's where we were in the mind of god before the foundation of the world our names were put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world amen amen and through the through the preaching of the gospel and the new become new creatures in christ salvation redemption so on oh it changes us we were sinful just more conscious of this whole world this this do this we like this we like that but when we were born again we were put in contact with eternity hallelujah eternal sons and daughters of god knew amen we will become as it were new creatures in this whole world amen but we're going back to what we were amen by the grace of god hallelujah hallelujah oh there's a deep calling to the deep amen we're here in time but this is it god has given us the baptism of the holy ghost it made us new creatures in christ amen with a deep hunger and thirst for glory a deep anger and threat oh yeah the thing of it is that we because we were born and seen we forgot like i preached it some years ago over and uh oh yes on top of the road there you know at the college building and so on and i don't know what that what what the word was some of the brothers told me what it was after i said what happened to us we always just got into this this place where oh we we didn't know who we were didn't know what we were but all this i said but then god came to bring it back to our remembrance oh what's going on uh i'm not satisfied in this world no more i i don't like all this stuff that's going on now oh my oh i'm hungry i'm thirsty for eternity or a glorified body yes my son because that's where you come from that's where you're going by the grace of god and god god did it for a reason as the prophet said god allowed it to happen so that he could reveal to us is divine love and he said that we in hearing that word hearing the revelation would love him for himself not loving because we got to he said oh we gotta love god you know we should love god oh no he said there's a relationship that he that he brings between him and to his sons and daughters and it's the relationship where they see who he really is his nature seeing what he did to redeem us to bring us back he loved us he didn't want to love us because he didn't want he didn't want us to love him just because we were we were made to love him we were created to love him no no we that he wanted yes he wanted us to love him for himself for who he was because we liked his nature we loved his nature considering what he did and he allowed this to happen but look what he did to get us back because he loved us because he loved us god help us that we love him amen and that love is creating a greater and greater and greater hunger amen for the resurrection the rapture to get back with him in glory to god be the glory amen the lord bless you this stand do god be the glory amen amen that's saying 499. amen god bless us there's a number of other things that i want to share with you regarding faith but we'll see as the lord leads us amen and and we might we might get our brother jonathan
