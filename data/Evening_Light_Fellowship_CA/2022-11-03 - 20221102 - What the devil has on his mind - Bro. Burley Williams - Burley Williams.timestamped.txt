[47:53] hour
[47:54] and what is God doing in this hour amen
[47:57] let's not go back oh he did this he did

[48:20] the others did he didn't ask them to
[48:22] believe
[48:23] they believe in a resurrection and they
[48:27] believe some of them believe that
[48:28] there's going to be a Rapture but that
[48:31] to them it was up there
[48:33] but now for us it's here
[48:35] Abraham praise the Lord for God because

[48:40] future it's in the present
[48:42] amen God God brings us his word into the
[48:45] present tense
[48:47] brother it was in the present tense for
[48:49] for our other ages what God gave them

[48:54] what is the Revelation for this age
[48:56] brother what God requires of us Brothers
[48:59] what he gave them Plus
[49:01] amen it's not just the same well I I
[49:05] believe this God did this God's going to
[49:07] do this yeah brother well we got to go
[49:09] right on back in the beginning God
[49:11] created the Heaven and the Earth amen
[49:14] and God did this and God did that
[49:16] brother we believe God had a plan a
[49:19] purpose and per an a reason to do it God
[49:24] is by the grace of God help us to get
[49:26] more and more into the revelation of his
[49:28] plan and his purpose yes in God's
[49:31] pattern
[49:32] the way the way he he does it the way he
[49:35] was going to do it amen oh brother
[49:38] sister help us God may the Lord help us
[49:40] amen so the Lord bless you
[49:43] and again I could go on I guess if we
[49:45] could go on and Minister but the Lord
[49:47] really I I was going to have the another
[49:50] brother minister
[49:52] and uh online tonight and uh so uh
[49:56] hopefully he won't be too long uh
[49:59] because if he preaches then I preach and
[50:02] so on
[50:03] but so it's difficult to get up and do
[50:06] behind the ball but as a clergy and not
[50:09] breach amen if you just got to get up
[50:12] and greet the people you're gonna you're
[50:13] gonna greet to greet them with a sermon
[50:16] amen so we just pray the grace of God be
[50:19] with us as we will tonight go into hear
[50:21] another brother Minister on the word but
[50:23] I want to share with you a scripture we
[50:26] have to ask you to keep keep one another
[50:27] in prayer and uh but uh if it was ever
[50:31] an hour that we need to pray for one
[50:33] another's now
[50:35] but when we consider the hour the age
[50:37] that we're living brother brother uh
[50:40] there's going to be well the Bible says
[50:43] concerning this age the Bible says when
[50:45] he comes will he find faith
[50:47] amen they had a reason for for putting
[50:50] that in the word
[50:51] amen because they knew when it went all
[50:53] down Through the Ages that this was
[50:55] going to happen this was going to happen
[50:57] that was going to happen until finally
[50:59] it was Faith was going to get less and
[51:01] less and less yeah fewer and fewer and
[51:05] fewer amen because when he comes he's
[51:08] there's going to be so few here for the
[51:11] resurrection
[51:12] so a few going in the Rapture oh yes
[51:16] the bubble of God someone asked the
[51:18] prophet of God he said well brother
[51:20] Branham he said what would you do if God
[51:22] asked you to pick out you know so many
[51:24] for the bride in this hour this age and
[51:26] he said uh you know but how many would
[51:28] he get he said I might get a dozen
[51:30] a dozen
[51:32] that's 50 or 60 years ago when the
[51:35] prophet was there now gone
[51:37] how many will you find now
[51:39] how many were can we go out there and
[51:41] find now I'll tell you brother sister
[51:43] straight is the gate Narrows the way and
[51:46] few there be that binding
[51:49] considering and compared to all all that
[51:53] are religious out there the spiritual is
[51:55] going to give so small so few
[51:58] so I pray God that we Are Spiritual not
[52:01] religious we're spiritual amen
[52:05] because brother it's in spiritual are
[52:07] going into Resurrection the spiritual
[52:09] are going into Rapture not to religious
[52:12] so the grace of God to help us to get
[52:15] out of away from religion and into the
[52:18] spiritual revelation of the word the
[52:20] Holy Ghost revelation of the word we're
[52:23] not following man and I trust by Grace
[52:25] we're here we're not following William
[52:26] Branham we're following the word
[52:29] amen because he was sent to point us to
[52:33] the word and then God took him off the
[52:35] scene and he knew that he knew he knew
[52:38] that they were coming to see him he knew
[52:40] what they want they want him to do this
[52:41] they wanted him to do that no So
[52:43] eventually oh yeah that's why eventually
[52:45] you know he stopped stopped using the
[52:47] gift
[52:48] and they oh yeah the world the world was
[52:51] amazed that William Brown he had this
[52:54] gift then all of a sudden oh you just
[52:56] get up and just talk and preach and that
[52:58] was it
[52:59] yeah why because now he was he was he
[53:03] what was the gift for
[53:06] why did why did God give him these gifts
[53:08] to do this to do that discern the
[53:10] thoughts and intention of the heart amen
[53:12] the sign in the hand it was to get our
[53:14] attention
[53:15] and the prophet of God and he was
[53:17] instructed by the angel get the people
[53:20] to believe
[53:22] amen believe what to believe the word
[53:25] amen and to believe the word that would
[53:28] give us rapturing faith
[53:30] not just to believe them for down in the
[53:33] previous ages but to believe what God
[53:35] was doing in this hour and what God was
[53:37] revealing this hour and it would give us
[53:39] the faith we need
[53:41] because brother the faith that they need
[53:43] they did what what what what God
[53:45] ordained him to do in that age and like
[53:47] Luther with his justification
[53:49] sanctification Pentecostal baptism of
[53:51] the Holy Ghost the gifts of the Spirit
[53:53] but where was the resurrection and the
[53:56] rapture
[53:57] amen it was all pointing to the
[54:00] resurrection and Rapture and then God
[54:02] would raise up a generation that he
[54:04] would give that faith of Resurrection to
[54:06] and the rapture
[54:08] brother the other age just didn't do it
[54:10] oh they had the faith to move on and oh
[54:13] they believed the resurrection was up
[54:15] the road the Rapture was up there
[54:17] somewhere well that it's coming
[54:19] but for us we believe it's here
[54:22] amen what God did is to show us that
[54:25] it's here amen it's revealed to us the
[54:29] faith we need look up
[54:31] that's what the Bible says when you oh
[54:34] see this see this all to finally it says
[54:37] look up
[54:39] amen well they were they were asked to
[54:41] believe this that's to believe that now
[54:43] there was a generation that would come
[54:45] on the scene and he's asking us to look
[54:47] up what poor Resurrection what
[54:50] it's going to be that real yes and the
[54:53] Rapture we're going to be caught up yes
[54:55] there's going to be a generation that's
[54:56] going to be cut up
[54:58] Grace
[55:00] please in the name of Jesus I pray Grace
[55:03] that we are not
[55:04] not get religious but get spiritual
[55:07] amen God bless you before we go into the
[55:11] hear another brother minister of the
[55:13] word tonight this turning our Bibles to
[55:15] Galatians chapter 2.
[55:19] the book of Galatians chapter 2.
[55:23] amen
[55:25] praise the Lord
[55:27] oh we should go on all you're going to
[55:28] do is read the scripture and then you
[55:30] can minister
[55:31] amen but we're going to get another
[55:34] brother to minister to us tonight
[55:42] and uh just to bear in mind too that I
[55:46] mentioned about
[55:48] what we're going to deal with
[55:50] in when it comes to the word
[55:52] because right near right getting that
[55:54] getting here the end of the the ministry
[55:57] as it were getting near the end of the
[55:59] of the revealed word
[56:01] and getting near the end of the word of
[56:03] the revelation of Grace brother I said
[56:06] oh yes there's going to be judicarians
[56:09] yes
[56:10] Jesus dealt with it and really I don't
[56:13] trip the ages they had to dealt with
[56:14] judaistarian spirits that's right
[56:17] they didn't all stay with the word some
[56:19] were there just to betray it some were
[56:22] there to just to
[56:23] just to find fault with it
[56:27] amen and the father of God did warn us
[56:30] concerning that judaistarian spirit that
[56:33] was coming upon the Earth
[56:35] that judaistarian spirit that we would
[56:38] have to deal with in these last days
[56:40] amen oh yes
[56:43] he said now he said do you get what I'm
[56:45] meaning he said when the goal sign comes
[56:48] on all right he said when the thing is
[56:51] inspired to you and God makes it known
[56:53] like he did back there all right he said
[56:56] but until he does it we got a bunch of
[57:00] judaistarians impersonating
[57:03] amen so we're going to be dealing with
[57:06] judaistarian spirits brother so
[57:09] they're they're preaching the what what
[57:12] we think are what are preaching the
[57:13] message they're preaching this they're
[57:15] preaching that amen but is it giving us
[57:17] the faith that we need
[57:19] amen you can have the revelation of this
[57:22] you can have the the understanding of
[57:24] this but what about faith
[57:26] faith comes by hearing the word
[57:30] amen and brother what God has done in
[57:33] every age was the word he revealed this
[57:36] part of the word that part of the word
[57:37] to give them the faith they needed now
[57:40] he's revealed that portion of the word
[57:41] to give us the faith we need amen
[57:44] oh yes thank God for justification thank
[57:48] God for sanctification the baptism of
[57:51] the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the
[57:53] Spirit oh brother but where where are
[57:55] they the Bible God said the gifts are
[57:56] right there he said he said if we need
[57:58] them
[57:59] if we need them now Pentecost they just
[58:02] add them that's it that's all they
[58:04] focused on was was the baptism and the
[58:06] gift the baptism the gift the gifts the
[58:08] gifts but now brother God want us to
[58:11] focus now on the resurrection and the
[58:13] rapture thank God for the baptism thank
[58:16] God for the gifts amen sure if we got
[58:19] faith for the baptism faith for the
[58:21] gifts of the Spirit surely we're moving
[58:23] into a faith for the resurrection and
[58:26] the faith for the rapture we're moving
[58:28] on and that's what God's requiring of us
[58:30] believe us thou this
[58:33] amen again do I light you amen that when
[58:38] he came in his first coming
[58:40] to reveal himself as the resurrection
[58:43] and the rapture
[58:44] and Jesus was laid down his life but he
[58:48] picked it up again
[58:49] resurrection and then he went up in a
[58:53] rapture
[58:54] now he's revealing the same in Mrs Jesus
[58:57] Christ is bright Hallelujah
[59:01] that he is the resurrection and he is
[59:03] the rapture they preached on it for 2
[59:06] 000 years but now there's a generation
[59:08] believing the resurrection deleting the
[59:11] Rapture praise the name of the Lord amen
[59:14] not just a Doctrine but an experience
[59:17] praise the Lord
[59:19] father thank God so I trust thank God

[59:40] resurrection

[59:43] those that are believing for God to do
[59:45] this God to do that brother God's God's
[59:48] waiting for you to believe for the
[59:50] resurrection let me say it again the
[59:52] prophet of God said that that the Lord
[59:55] is waiting on you
[59:57] yeah
[59:59] we think oh we're waiting on the Lord
[1:00:00] for this waiting on the Lord no no no
[1:00:02] God has given us the word to give us the
[1:00:04] faith for the resurrection now he's
[1:00:06] waiting on you to believe it and to
[1:00:09] claim it God help us
[1:00:12] amen
[1:00:13] brother Luther claimed the faith that
[1:00:16] God gave him Wesley claimed the faith
[1:00:18] that God gave him the Pentecostals and
[1:00:21] the other claimed the faith that God
[1:00:22] gave them amen now
[1:00:25] I trust proclaiming the faith that God
[1:00:27] has given us
[1:00:29] through the ministry of a prophet
[1:00:31] praise the Lord and brothers not just to
[1:00:34] say oh thank God he sent the prophet and
[1:00:37] he revealed the mysteries of the word
[1:00:39] this mystery that mystery you know my
[1:00:41] brother it was to give us the faith
[1:00:43] amen
[1:00:45] so that as you could go from the mystery
[1:00:47] as it were to the reality of the
[1:00:49] Resurrection
[1:00:50] how many believe
[1:00:52] really believe
[1:00:54] we're in the hour of the Resurrection
[1:00:56] really believe we're in the hour of the
[1:00:58] Rapture I tell you brother sister it's
[1:01:00] time to go
[1:01:03] it's time to go
[1:01:04] God help us
[1:01:07] and in the book of Galatians chapter 2
[1:01:10] .
[1:01:15] in verse 19 he said for I through the
[1:01:18] law am dead to the law that I might live
[1:01:21] unto God
[1:01:23] I am crucified with Christ
[1:01:27] I trust
[1:01:29] that's your faith
[1:01:31] I am crucified with Christ nevertheless
[1:01:35] I live
[1:01:37] yet not I but Christ liveth in me
[1:01:43] and the life which I now live in the
[1:01:45] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:01:49] God if it's Christ in you it's his faith
[1:01:53] let go and let Jesus at his way
[1:01:56] let go and let Jesus have control
[1:01:59] you have your thoughts your words and
[1:02:02] your Deeds amen
[1:02:06] and he said in the Life which I now live
[1:02:08] in the flesh I live by the faith of the
[1:02:11] Son of God who loved me and gave himself
[1:02:14] for me
[1:02:16] I do not frustrate the grace of God
[1:02:20] for if righteousness come by the law
[1:02:22] then Christ is dead in vain amen the
[1:02:28] righteousness didn't come by the law no
[1:02:31] no it was in the flesh
[1:02:32] but not in the soul
[1:02:34] in your flesh but not in your heart
[1:02:37] amen but through Christ Hallelujah
[1:02:39] Christ did what he did he laid down his
[1:02:42] leg picked it up again came back to
[1:02:44] share it with you and me
[1:02:46] not in our flesh but in our hearts
[1:02:49] amen from the inside out
[1:02:52] there's too many they got it outside but
[1:02:55] they don't have it from the inside amen
[1:02:57] by the grace of God let's make sure that
[1:03:01] the life that we live is from the inside
[1:03:03] of it it's the anointing on the inside
[1:03:06] of the inside we're not going by the
[1:03:07] intellectual knowledge of the word
[1:03:09] intellectual letter of the word we're
[1:03:12] going by the spiritual revelation of the
[1:03:15] word amen that is God and Christ in us
[1:03:19] the horrible glory amen
[1:03:23] so brother let's let's make our calling
[1:03:25] and our election sure stay with the word
[1:03:30] and we're going to go into air oh a
[1:03:33] ministering brother of minister
[1:03:35] uh
[1:03:36] in the
[1:03:38] States
[1:03:42] never
[1:03:45] Burley oh
[1:03:48] Brody Williams Oh okay the Lord blesses
[1:03:51] the ministry of the word to our hearts
[1:03:53] amen so let's let's be in the spirit and
[1:03:57] pray the grace of God by the spirit to
[1:03:59] minister to us please in the name of
[1:04:01] Jesus hear the word
[1:04:03] amen it's not going to say well I'm
[1:04:06] going to see what the brother is going
[1:04:07] to say listen to the word
[1:04:09] faith comes by hearing the word
[1:04:12] amen so brother oh well it's by the
[1:04:15] prophet yes but the prophet of God said
[1:04:18] that the bride has got a fight full
[1:04:20] ministry
[1:04:21] someone asked the prophet that and they
[1:04:24] said brother round does the bride have a
[1:04:26] Ministry he says sure and he said it's
[1:04:27] in the bride now and I believe it's in
[1:04:29] the in the in the revelation of the
[1:04:30] seals somewhere that questions and
[1:04:32] answers said they asked the prophet that
[1:04:34] he said yes and he had he identified the
[1:04:37] five-fold ministry so please let's not
[1:04:40] just think oh yes we just got to hear
[1:04:42] Brother Branham no no there's a
[1:04:44] five-fold Ministry God has said in the
[1:04:46] church
[1:04:48] for this purpose for this reason amen
[1:04:50] and for the perfecting of the Saints by
[1:04:54] the revealed word of God
[1:04:56] so make sure
[1:04:58] there's too many brothers too many
[1:05:00] around the world too many around the
[1:05:02] message that by dirt but they won't
[1:05:04] don't recognize the ministry
[1:05:08] I'll tell you
[1:05:09] they won't be in the resurrection
[1:05:12] they won't be in the rapture
[1:05:14] not by any means
[1:05:16] because God has a plan God's got a
[1:05:19] purpose and God's got a pattern
[1:05:21] and brother it includes the fightful
[1:05:23] ministry oh well it's just the prophet
[1:05:26] no yes it does
[1:05:27] but he came and gave the word to the
[1:05:29] Prophet The Prophet came and shared it
[1:05:31] with the fivefold ministry amen so God
[1:05:34] help us to stay with the word
[1:05:38] because God has set in the church
[1:05:41] for the perfecting of the Saints God
[1:05:44] help us
[1:05:46] again in Galatians Chapter 2 and verse
[1:05:49] 19 for I through the law am dead to the
[1:05:52] law that I might live unto God I am
[1:05:56] crucified with Christ
[1:05:58] nevertheless I live
[1:06:00] yet not I but Christ liveth in me I
[1:06:04] trust that Christ is living in US
[1:06:07] and the life which I now live in the
[1:06:09] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:06:11] God who loved me and gave himself for me
[1:06:15] Grace that we'll love one another
[1:06:18] and give us gift give ourselves to or
[1:06:21] for one another
[1:06:22] amen oh yes
[1:06:25] they did it down Through the Ages I pray
[1:06:27] that we're willing to do it now
[1:06:31] I do not frustrate the grace of God for
[1:06:33] it is righteousness come by if
[1:06:36] righteousness come by the law then
[1:06:38] Christ is dead in vain
[1:06:40] but thank God Is by grace
[1:06:43] not by the law
[1:06:45] amen so I pray the grace of God to be
[1:06:48] with us as we go in and hear our brother
[1:06:49] Minister the word this evening amen God
[1:06:53] increase our faith
[1:06:55] for his glory
[1:06:58] and make sure that we've got the right
[1:06:59] Spirit and the right attitude amen
[1:07:04] because there's anything that God's
[1:07:06] looking for is a right spirit and a
[1:07:08] right attitude
[1:07:09] amen
[1:07:12] and I've met many over the years through
[1:07:15] this word through this afterwards
[1:07:16] Obama's 50 years for me
[1:07:19] for about 50 years
[1:07:21] that I've been
[1:07:24] into the word into the message
[1:07:26] and I've had to deal with many spirits
[1:07:28] oh yes
[1:07:31] as I've said one time I was in a messy
[1:07:34] church and had an altar call people were
[1:07:36] coming up around the Altar and
[1:07:37] worshiping and praying and and there was
[1:07:40] two that came up and they were on my
[1:07:44] left side there and uh and I said oh
[1:07:48] they came up and they were worshiping
[1:07:50] and they were stood around the altar
[1:07:51] with a lot of the other believers and I
[1:07:54] looked down and I said oh Lord I said
[1:07:57] they don't believe
[1:08:00] people were shocked when I re mention it
[1:08:03] to them oh yeah I said no I said we
[1:08:05] don't believe I said they got a
[1:08:07] religious spirit but they don't have the
[1:08:09] Holy Spirit
[1:08:10] in them so make sure you got the holy
[1:08:13] spirit in you and in your heart
[1:08:15] don't just come with don't come with a
[1:08:17] religious spirit come with the Holy
[1:08:19] Spirit
[1:08:20] and the Holy Spirit is going to teach
[1:08:22] you the holy spirit is going to give you
[1:08:24] the word amen the holy spirit is going
[1:08:27] to increase your faith by the grace of
[1:08:29] God
[1:08:31] he said the prophet said again
[1:08:35] the hours coming when right and wrong is
[1:08:37] made manifest
[1:08:39] right
[1:08:41] he said it shows in the Christian today
[1:08:43] it shows in the churches today it shows
[1:08:47] in the people today he said I'm he said
[1:08:50] I know it's that I'm all in you long but
[1:08:52] he said I want to get this to you amen
[1:08:57] if you're going to hear the word
[1:08:58] recognize the word act on the word but
[1:09:01] make sure it's the Holy Ghost In You
[1:09:03] from your heart
[1:09:05] not in your flesh
[1:09:08] the prophet of God said you can you can
[1:09:10] experience God in your flesh 24 hours a
[1:09:12] day and go to hell
[1:09:14] why because you got to have it in your
[1:09:16] heart amen so make sure that what God
[1:09:19] has given you what God is is giving you
[1:09:22] and what amen what you're believing is
[1:09:24] out of the heart not out of not by the
[1:09:27] letter of the word
[1:09:28] but by the spiritual revelation of the
[1:09:32] word amen
[1:09:35] and again he said
[1:09:38] we are in the end time now the Lord
[1:09:41] bless you richly I get started on that
[1:09:44] and forget about time and we're going to
[1:09:46] fade pretty quickly into eternity amen
[1:09:51] brother I trust that we're
[1:09:54] sensing now that we're fading more and
[1:09:56] more and more into eternity
[1:10:00] he said because he said God is sovereign
[1:10:03] and we see here what David done in the
[1:10:05] scriptures he said reading he said verse
[1:10:08] Chronicles 13 and he says but God does
[1:10:12] not give us merits on good intentions
[1:10:16] no no
[1:10:18] he said there's only one way to serve
[1:10:20] God and that's by doing his will at his
[1:10:24] command
[1:10:25] and he said and God being Sovereign
[1:10:28] there's no one to tell him what to do or
[1:10:30] how to do it he does it he said the way
[1:10:34] to do it
[1:10:35] that does it the way that he knows the
[1:10:37] right way to do it and he said that
[1:10:39] makes me feel good
[1:10:41] but he said one great thing again about
[1:10:44] God he has not left us without knowing
[1:10:48] what's the truth
[1:10:50] out of
[1:10:51] it and how to do it
[1:10:53] God knows what's best
[1:10:56] God knows when to do it and how to do it
[1:10:59] amen we have our ideas but God knows
[1:11:04] amen so I trust by the grace of God that
[1:11:07] you're influenced by God
[1:11:10] you're not influenced by a religious
[1:11:11] spirit which is the devil put your
[1:11:14] influenced by God Amen
[1:11:16] so the grace of God be with us as we go
[1:11:19] into
[1:11:20] hear the word amen for the glory of God
[1:11:24] amen
[1:11:27] they say the hour is coming when right
[1:11:30] and wrong is made manifest
[1:11:32] it shows in Christian the Christian
[1:11:35] today
[1:11:36] it shows in the churches today it shows
[1:11:39] in the people today I'm holding you long
[1:11:41] but if I want to to get this to you
[1:11:45] amen
[1:11:47] so as God get into you the word
[1:11:50] personally
[1:11:51] amen so he's got us dealing with you in
[1:11:54] a very personal way and you are dealing
[1:11:57] with God in a personal way amen not just
[1:12:00] religion oh yeah he's God
[1:12:03] so I you know but I'm on this and I'm
[1:12:06] that yeah
[1:12:07] well you got to recognize him as your
[1:12:09] father
[1:12:10] and your yourself as the Son of God as
[1:12:13] the daughter of God Amen you have a
[1:12:16] relationship with God Amen to God be the
[1:12:20] glory
[1:12:21] remember he said
[1:12:24] he said we are at the end of all things
[1:12:27] now

[1:20:39] so much discouragement is around

[1:21:02] praise the Lord it certainly it's good

[1:21:07] appreciate better Chad giving us the
[1:21:09] opportunity
[1:21:10] to come to share the words of life with
[1:21:12] you thank you musicians amen uh so uh we
[1:21:16] just like to just go ahead and get into
[1:21:18] the scriptures and uh
[1:21:22] see what the Lord will do for us this
[1:21:23] evening
[1:21:25] I was up in uh
[1:21:28] Toledo working this week and
[1:21:31] I was just thinking yesterday as I was
[1:21:34] working at want to go to Paul's house at
[1:21:37] his house and uh a little thought come
[1:21:40] on my mind it sounds a little strange
[1:21:42] but
[1:21:44] it just won't leave so I I guess I'll
[1:21:48] preach it y'all my title
[1:21:50] is what the devil has in his mind
[1:21:54] what the devil has in his mind
[1:21:58] I was just it just come out of nowhere
[1:22:00] where I ain't gonna say it come out of
[1:22:01] nowhere
[1:22:02] I don't believe God just give us stuff
[1:22:04] out of nowhere
[1:22:06] but I just uh I said well I just been
[1:22:09] studying on it and looking at some
[1:22:11] things
[1:22:12] that's what we're just Minister on by
[1:22:14] God's grace
[1:22:15] what the devil has in his mind
[1:22:18] you know many times we talk about what
[1:22:22] God has in his mind
[1:22:24] and uh
[1:22:26] but sometimes I guess it's going to do
[1:22:28] us good to look to see what the devil
[1:22:30] got in his mind
[1:22:31] I believe we already know what the devil
[1:22:33] has in this mind
[1:22:35] I do believe that
[1:22:37] so I don't think we'll be ministering
[1:22:39] nothing new
[1:22:40] uh that you haven't heard already
[1:22:43] but we'll just see what the Lord will do
[1:22:45] amen let's go to Isaiah chapter 14.
[1:22:59] Isaiah chapter 14.
[1:23:09] this is a very familiar scripture let's
[1:23:10] go to verse 12.
[1:23:16] he said how thou falling from heaven
[1:23:18] oh Lucifer son of the morning
[1:23:21] how are thou cut down to the ground
[1:23:23] which deadest weaken the Nations
[1:23:27] for thou have said and thine heart I
[1:23:29] will Ascend into heaven
[1:23:31] I will exalt my throne above the stars
[1:23:33] of God
[1:23:34] I will sit also upon the Mount of the
[1:23:36] congregation
[1:23:38] in the sides of the North
[1:23:40] I will Ascend above the heights of the
[1:23:42] clouds I will be like the most high yet
[1:23:46] Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to
[1:23:49] the sides of the pit amen
[1:23:52] you may be seated
[1:23:58] amen
[1:24:00] what the devil has in his mind
[1:24:04] you know uh we thank God for his grace
[1:24:07] of the mercy allowing us to be here this
[1:24:09] evening
[1:24:10] and uh we just want to share a few
[1:24:12] things with you
[1:24:13] because we certainly is in the present
[1:24:15] time
[1:24:16] amen it's a lot of negative things you
[1:24:20] could talk about
[1:24:21] but you have asked yourself what does
[1:24:24] good does it does talking about negative
[1:24:27] it's no faith in it there's no virtue in
[1:24:30] it there's no help in it amen so we want
[1:24:33] to talk about deposited things because I
[1:24:35] believe sometimes if you talk about
[1:24:38] negative stuff too much it's like you're
[1:24:40] giving the devil Glory
[1:24:41] giving him some Victory and we don't
[1:24:44] want to do that I remember
[1:24:46] um
[1:24:47] I can't I hope I got this story right I
[1:24:49] can't remember what war it was um uh my
[1:24:53] pastor was telling me about it one time
[1:24:54] how many of you ever heard I think this
[1:24:56] lady
[1:24:57] I think it's called Tokyo Rose anybody
[1:25:00] ever heard of that
[1:25:01] Tokyo Rose
[1:25:03] from understanding uh when the war was
[1:25:06] going on I think with the Japanese and
[1:25:08] so forth
[1:25:09] Tokyo Tokyo Rose was a woman on a radio
[1:25:13] announcer
[1:25:15] and on the radio broadcast
[1:25:17] whenever something goes bad American
[1:25:20] dies something like that they just
[1:25:22] broadcast it on the radio another
[1:25:24] American down this wasn't going to
[1:25:26] happen this way don't happen
[1:25:28] but that was a design to keep for her to
[1:25:30] keep talking making statements like that
[1:25:33] so people could hear it to discourage
[1:25:36] them
[1:25:38] amen it just kind of reminded me just
[1:25:41] recently when uh this war was going on
[1:25:44] but I was still going on with Ukraine
[1:25:47] you hear all kind of stuff on the news
[1:25:50] and and this and Russia is doing this
[1:25:53] and so while it looks pretty bad for
[1:25:55] Ukraine and then I got friends in
[1:25:58] Ukraine and uh you know when you hear
[1:26:00] what the news saying you say you shake
[1:26:02] your head for Ukraine this and that and
[1:26:04] the other but I called one of my friends
[1:26:06] he said brother don't listen to that
[1:26:08] nonsense on y'all uh uh broadcast he
[1:26:12] said we fighting
[1:26:13] amen he said we were doing what we got
[1:26:16] to do I said well praise the Lord so
[1:26:19] sometimes when you can hear certain
[1:26:21] things you really need to dig in and see
[1:26:23] what is truth and what is not truth
[1:26:25] because the things that you listen to it
[1:26:27] actually influences you can we say man
[1:26:30] so but we want to hear about positive
[1:26:33] things it also reminds me I remember I
[1:26:37] went to a museum one time and they had a
[1:26:40] display in the museum and it's called Uh
[1:26:43] psyops and uh and it was kind of
[1:26:46] interesting to me and I began to read
[1:26:48] some of the uh
[1:26:50] the statements that they had upon there
[1:26:52] and it was kind of amazing and this is
[1:26:56] uh it's been many many years ago so I
[1:26:58] probably can't remember all of it but
[1:27:00] they had a plane that America has it is
[1:27:04] designed for psyops which psyops means
[1:27:08] psychological it means psychological
[1:27:10] warfare and in this plane I was reading
[1:27:13] the listings they had everything in
[1:27:16] there that they could tap into wherever
[1:27:19] they whoever they're fighting they could
[1:27:21] tap into their radio communications and
[1:27:23] they can their radio waves and it's just
[1:27:26] a plane just totally designed for psyops
[1:27:30] I said that's interesting and then uh so
[1:27:33] when they can break in somebody else's
[1:27:35] uh radio thing and start talking to the
[1:27:37] people and trying to tell them you need
[1:27:40] to surrender you need to do this and
[1:27:41] we're going to kill you and then it can
[1:27:43] mess with people mind
[1:27:45] and then they had a display on there
[1:27:48] where uh This Plane would drop leaflets
[1:27:52] and uh when the soldiers that they was
[1:27:54] fighting against this plane would drop
[1:27:57] leaflets down there and tell them we're
[1:27:59] gonna drop this bomb on you
[1:28:01] and the Folger that walking would pick
[1:28:03] it up and they would read it and then
[1:28:06] they keep on walking
[1:28:09] then they'll drop another flyer then
[1:28:11] after we drop this bomb we're gonna drop
[1:28:13] this one
[1:28:15] and then they will pick it up and they
[1:28:16] would read it and then they would
[1:28:19] literally drop another flyer and said
[1:28:20] don't try to dig into the ground
[1:28:23] because the bomb that's going to come
[1:28:24] out with that it's called The Bunker
[1:28:26] Buster and they begin to describe how
[1:28:28] far it could go down in the ground say
[1:28:30] if you go down in the ground we're going
[1:28:32] to drop this one on you and then all of
[1:28:34] a sudden they just start dropping their
[1:28:35] weapons and they start raising their
[1:28:37] hand
[1:28:39] just from leaflets
[1:28:41] they didn't even have to shoot a weapon
[1:28:43] they were defeated in their mind so it
[1:28:46] was over with
[1:28:47] that's why God sent us a message today
[1:28:49] to explain to us the greatest battles
[1:28:52] that his fault is in the mind
[1:28:54] because once you lose in the mind
[1:28:56] everything else Falls right into place
[1:28:59] can we say man you see that was the
[1:29:01] tactic that the Philistines used on the
[1:29:04] children of Israel and he saw and uh
[1:29:08] Saul was afraid soldiers was afraid but
[1:29:12] if you really look at that story uh God
[1:29:15] had all of that laid out perfectly
[1:29:18] because you remember when they wanted a
[1:29:20] king they wanted somebody to fight for
[1:29:22] them
[1:29:23] stand for them so God let a war come to
[1:29:27] let them show this is the man you choose
[1:29:29] to fight for you but he just as scared
[1:29:31] as you are
[1:29:33] so God allowed that to happen so he
[1:29:35] could bring David on the scene
[1:29:37] can we say praise the Lord but you
[1:29:39] remember Goliath he defeated them not
[1:29:42] through in the spirit
[1:29:44] amen not shooting the arrow
[1:29:46] nothing he defeated them with words
[1:29:50] if you say Amen they lost the battle in
[1:29:53] their mind and they was totally defeated
[1:29:55] but when David came the words that
[1:29:58] Goliath was speaking couldn't penetrate
[1:30:00] David's mind
[1:30:02] to David had an experience he just
[1:30:04] pushed it all out so when David looked
[1:30:07] at Goliath he already seen Goliath
[1:30:09] defeated
[1:30:10] so that's what we ought to do amen by
[1:30:12] God's grace because he said that we are
[1:30:14] more than conquerors our interview been
[1:30:17] defeated a long time ago at Calvary he
[1:30:20] done it all but we have to believe that
[1:30:23] can we say praise the Lord but you know
[1:30:25] Satan uh he he is a bluffer right yeah
[1:30:29] and he's very good at extremely good at
[1:30:32] it so we have to understand what Satan
[1:30:35] tactic is so now I'm going to talk about
[1:30:38] some things and uh this uh uh but then
[1:30:41] we'll flip it back around because
[1:30:43] sometimes I know you can preach
[1:30:45] sometimes about something on one side
[1:30:48] too much and you'll be like hmm come on
[1:30:50] bring it back Branch it out so I believe
[1:30:53] in the balance amen and I remember years
[1:30:55] ago I used to hear people talk on
[1:30:57] Prophecy Brothers preach on prophecy
[1:31:00] about what's going to happen to America
[1:31:01] and all these things and they taught me
[1:31:04] everything that was going to happen to
[1:31:06] America and you can leave a service
[1:31:08] depressed
[1:31:11] you're telling me everything that's
[1:31:12] going to happen but then but you gotta
[1:31:15] you gotta remember you got to bring it
[1:31:16] in what the prophet said before it
[1:31:18] wasn't born could fall he's going to
[1:31:20] take his bride away so that balances it
[1:31:22] out yeah she got it coming but let me
[1:31:24] know what's going to happen to me I'm
[1:31:25] gonna give it up I'm coming up out of
[1:31:27] here amen so I don't want to be
[1:31:29] depressed
[1:31:30] say man that's the same as correcting
[1:31:32] your children
[1:31:33] you correct them not to depress them
[1:31:36] is that right when you correct them then
[1:31:39] you got to give them a ray of Hope yeah
[1:31:41] you did wrong all right you got to
[1:31:43] acknowledge you did wrong you shouldn't
[1:31:45] have done this but then you know after
[1:31:48] you well sometimes you gotta sprinkle
[1:31:52] after you do your business then
[1:31:53] encourage it
[1:31:55] just tell them you're better than that
[1:31:57] you know I expect more to you than that
[1:31:59] I'll listen to it brother I can't
[1:32:00] remember who just told me recently he
[1:32:03] said man sometimes when his parents used
[1:32:05] to tell him I'm disappointed in you he
[1:32:07] said definitely worse than the weapon
[1:32:10] yeah see I'm disappointed in you those
[1:32:13] things cut and they hurt but yet leave
[1:32:15] encouragement so I believe God had left
[1:32:18] us with a message of encouragement this
[1:32:20] message comes to encourage us not to
[1:32:23] depress us so when people around the
[1:32:25] message I'm not trying to be funny when
[1:32:27] they're living in a realm of depression
[1:32:29] something is wrong
[1:32:30] they need to check their Revelation amen
[1:32:33] they need to check and see what they
[1:32:34] believe because God did not call us
[1:32:37] haven't given us a spirit of fear
[1:32:40] can we say man but power in love in the
[1:32:42] sound mind that's what God gives it so
[1:32:44] anything opposite of that is what the
[1:32:46] devil gives can we say praise the Lord
[1:32:48] now what's interesting about this
[1:32:51] scripture here we talking about what the
[1:32:53] devil has in his mind which we know uh
[1:32:57] we know the words our thoughts expressed
[1:32:59] before we become worried is actually a
[1:33:01] thought but then when you speak it and
[1:33:04] it comes word then it manifests whatever
[1:33:06] your thoughts was we understand that how
[1:33:08] the prophet went over this million times
[1:33:10] God said let there be light and there
[1:33:12] was light and it come to pass but you
[1:33:14] remember before Earth and all of this
[1:33:16] coming to existence it was all in God's
[1:33:18] mind but now it's just being played out
[1:33:20] and it being manifested amen so Satan
[1:33:24] had thoughts also in his mind what he
[1:33:27] wants to do amen Satan thought did not
[1:33:30] start here on Earth
[1:33:32] Satan thoughts started when he was in
[1:33:34] heaven
[1:33:35] is that right and that's what we
[1:33:37] actually just read Satan telling what
[1:33:41] I'm going to do but what's so interested
[1:33:43] when when you look at the scripture and
[1:33:46] you go to the message Satan the prophet
[1:33:48] said God Eden was established in
[1:33:51] righteousness Satan Eden is established
[1:33:55] in sin because Satan is sin God is
[1:34:00] righteous and God's kingdom was
[1:34:02] established in righteousness and peace
[1:34:05] and life and Satan establishment is in
[1:34:09] sin and religious sin I like how he just
[1:34:12] adding it in in sin religious sin he
[1:34:16] said now notice how he deceived his
[1:34:20] deception as he said he would then he
[1:34:23] said he promised
[1:34:26] to do this
[1:34:29] then he refers to Isaiah so what Satan
[1:34:33] was saying in Isaiah I'm going to be
[1:34:34] like the MOHAI Satan was making a
[1:34:36] promise
[1:34:37] otherwise I promise you
[1:34:39] this is what I'm gonna do
[1:34:42] God got promises and the devil got
[1:34:44] promises but the only difference is is
[1:34:46] God promises is to bless you Satan
[1:34:49] promises to bless himself
[1:34:52] that's the only difference can we say
[1:34:54] Amen even when you look in the scripture
[1:34:56] Satan saying I will be like the most
[1:34:58] high I will Ascend it to Heaven I will
[1:35:01] exalt my Throne I will sit upon the
[1:35:03] mouth all of those are Satan's eyes
[1:35:07] but then when you go to the Book of
[1:35:08] Ezekiel God got eyes
[1:35:11] God said I will take away your stoning
[1:35:14] heart I I'll give you a new spirit God
[1:35:17] said I would do this I will call you
[1:35:18] from the nation but the only difference
[1:35:20] Satan's eyes is for himself
[1:35:23] but God's eyes is for you
[1:35:26] God said I'm going to do this for you
[1:35:28] I'm going to take care of you I'm Gonna
[1:35:30] Change you but Sadie said all of my eyes
[1:35:33] is for me
[1:35:35] so that's the difference then he says
[1:35:37] here he said now he said
[1:35:41] now
[1:35:42] now what I'm looking at here I listened
[1:35:45] to ask the prophet ministers and speak
[1:35:47] he's actually telling us what's in
[1:35:51] Satan's mind
[1:35:52] he's telling us amen now now how many of
[1:35:56] you here got Facebook
[1:35:59] oh come on I ain't gonna preach against
[1:36:01] you you got Facebook raise your hand
[1:36:05] on your Facebook when you hit the home
[1:36:08] button
[1:36:09] what comes up
[1:36:14] what's on your mind
[1:36:18] right
[1:36:20] yeah just well I promise you after the
[1:36:23] service over You're Gonna Go
[1:36:25] before you post something on Facebook
[1:36:27] that's what the title is on the top
[1:36:29] what's on your mind
[1:36:32] then you start posting stuff
[1:36:34] and everything you're posting is what's
[1:36:36] on your mind
[1:36:38] right praise the Lord so when people put
[1:36:41] things on Facebook they're just telling
[1:36:43] what's on their mind
[1:36:45] whether it's good or bad they're telling
[1:36:48] what's on their mind
[1:36:51] and it's so sad how bad Facebook don't
[1:36:53] ask you to God people like to post their
[1:36:56] problems
[1:36:57] on Facebook
[1:36:59] I'm going through this y'all pray for me
[1:37:01] and this and I'm going I'm going through
[1:37:03] this and then all of a sudden they might
[1:37:05] go to a meeting one day they don't kind
[1:37:08] of in a in a good mood then they go to a
[1:37:11] meeting somebody just walk up to him
[1:37:13] praying for you let's say ain't nothing
[1:37:16] wrong with me no that post that you put
[1:37:17] on them I'm praying for you are you okay
[1:37:20] then you get offended I'm a strong
[1:37:22] Christian not me don't be no you put it
[1:37:24] there
[1:37:26] they're just responding back what was on
[1:37:28] your mind what you posted that's the
[1:37:30] only thing they do people put so much of
[1:37:32] their information on Facebook to it's
[1:37:34] really sad to people know you that don't
[1:37:37] actually know you
[1:37:41] Facebook I guess I'm Gonna Leave
[1:37:44] Facebook alone because that's some
[1:37:45] people's Church
[1:37:48] and they get offended when you talk
[1:37:50] about it but let me tell you something
[1:37:51] friends them things could be used right
[1:37:54] those things could be used wrong it's
[1:37:56] just the bottom line of the whole matter
[1:37:57] but anyway back to the scripture here
[1:38:00] now I want you to notice is this also
[1:38:03] the prophet says in Satan's Eden he said
[1:38:05] now he said he would exalt himself above
[1:38:09] the most high
[1:38:11] he will Ascend above the clouds and the
[1:38:14] stars and he would sit there like God
[1:38:17] and be above the most high then he says
[1:38:21] and he has succeeded
[1:38:24] in carrying out his threats so with
[1:38:27] Satan had in his heart in his mind when
[1:38:29] he was in heaven when he promised
[1:38:31] because the prophet said there he
[1:38:33] promised what he was going to do but now
[1:38:35] he has succeeded
[1:38:37] he said he has certainly had a marvelous
[1:38:41] success
[1:38:42] and carrying out his threats but now
[1:38:46] he's going to explain how he did it he
[1:38:48] said by the people letting him explain
[1:38:52] away in every age the value of God's
[1:38:57] promised word to that age so for Satan
[1:39:01] to fulfill his promise he has to attack
[1:39:04] God's promise
[1:39:06] and that's what he done and that's what
[1:39:08] he said the value he said he had
[1:39:11] explained away in every age the value of
[1:39:14] God's promised were to that Aid so
[1:39:17] whatever God promises in the age That's
[1:39:19] what Satan is going to attack to get the
[1:39:21] people to disbelieve what God has
[1:39:24] promised in that age can we say Amen say
[1:39:27] they gonna attack you today and tell you
[1:39:29] and argue with you about Noah build art
[1:39:32] right
[1:39:33] why do you want to do that for
[1:39:36] give me some amen then he ain't
[1:39:38] interested in that cause that don't pass
[1:39:40] so he ain't worried about that but what
[1:39:42] Satan is going to attack now he's going
[1:39:44] to try to show you that God is building
[1:39:45] the bride
[1:39:47] can we say Amen how many of you believe
[1:39:49] God is building the bribe God has him
[1:39:51] right God is creating his own bride how
[1:39:54] do God create his own bride by the word
[1:39:57] that's why when you go to the book of
[1:39:59] Ephesians he said he's going to have a
[1:40:01] church without spottarenka he cleansing
[1:40:03] her by the washing of the water of the
[1:40:05] word but what is the purpose to present
[1:40:07] her to himself
[1:40:09] so the bride that God wants he's created
[1:40:11] her for himself to present her to
[1:40:14] himself
[1:40:15] can we say Amen but Satan want to
[1:40:17] explain away every promise that God has
[1:40:20] done in the age he want to try to
[1:40:22] explain it away from the people that's
[1:40:23] why he get people to say ain't no such
[1:40:25] thing God's gonna send a gentile Prophet
[1:40:28] that's not really true that's God didn't
[1:40:30] really promise that but God did promise
[1:40:32] this it depends on where you're looking
[1:40:33] at so Satan want to explain all presence
[1:40:36] day promises that God has given us today
[1:40:39] he want to explain it away from the
[1:40:41] people like he said and he want to
[1:40:43] explain the value of it
[1:40:45] can we say Amen see people don't
[1:40:47] understand the value of the word of God
[1:40:50] the value why God's son the prophet is a
[1:40:53] value in that
[1:40:55] commission is that right it's wealth in
[1:40:58] there it's a pro it's a purpose for that
[1:41:00] so when we catch those Revelations even
[1:41:02] like uh uh you know me myself you got
[1:41:06] all kind of different attacks on the
[1:41:08] message and all of these sort of things
[1:41:10] it don't bother me
[1:41:12] people get offended when people say
[1:41:15] things against the message and stuff it
[1:41:16] don't bother me what people say
[1:41:19] because they can't take it from me
[1:41:21] there's not a devil out of hell can take
[1:41:23] this message from Burley Williams you
[1:41:26] can't explain it out of me because then
[1:41:27] nobody explained it in me
[1:41:29] can we say Amen I've been born again I
[1:41:32] don't care what I can't explain it don't
[1:41:35] matter to me I know what I believe so
[1:41:38] the devil can't shake me from none of
[1:41:40] those things the people say I just don't
[1:41:41] believe the message I said well you're
[1:41:43] unbelievable
[1:41:44] didn't they get mad how can you tell me
[1:41:46] I'm a Believer I said well God promise
[1:41:48] you you'll send a message in this day
[1:41:50] God promised that the Bible you said you
[1:41:52] read and God promised it so if you don't
[1:41:54] believe that that makes you an
[1:41:55] unbeliever
[1:41:58] [Applause]
[1:42:02] of maturing
[1:42:04] this is maturing time but you got to
[1:42:07] remember we have to go through things in
[1:42:09] life to help us to mature now let me
[1:42:12] just keep reading this he said he
[1:42:14] succeeded he has success in carrying out
[1:42:17] his stretch he has certainly had a
[1:42:19] marvelous success in carrying out his
[1:42:23] threat now let me go on down it says
[1:42:24] also in God's power transformation he
[1:42:28] says Satan's purpose
[1:42:29] from eating was to make his own self an
[1:42:33] Eden exalt himself above the stars of
[1:42:36] God
[1:42:37] God would worship Him Sons would worship
[1:42:40] him he said and he has absolutely
[1:42:43] carried it out now and when he's done
[1:42:46] this brought it into the church he's
[1:42:49] which I won't go in details he said any
[1:42:51] of you listen to these texts know about
[1:42:53] it that's exactly that I will living in
[1:42:56] and you remember in God at this evil age
[1:42:59] he said there's never been another age
[1:43:01] until this age where Satan is called the
[1:43:04] god
[1:43:05] of this evil age the reason why he's
[1:43:08] called to God because all the way from
[1:43:10] Genesis he doesn't succeed into this age
[1:43:12] that he has actually become God of this
[1:43:15] evil Aid so he has fulfilled what was in
[1:43:18] his mind way back up there in Heavens he
[1:43:21] has successfully fulfilled it today but
[1:43:24] we see how the prophet going into
[1:43:26] details how he did it
[1:43:28] can we say man he says Satan has done it
[1:43:31] through educational programs now normal
[1:43:35] preaching ain't nobody gonna say oh come
[1:43:37] on that's nonsense educational program
[1:43:40] yeah that's exactly what he has done
[1:43:42] through school through education amen
[1:43:45] through seminaries through preachers
[1:43:47] Satan has actually have been able to do
[1:43:50] these things so the prophet just really
[1:43:52] just breaking it down what was in
[1:43:54] Satan's mind and how he done these
[1:43:57] things then he says
[1:43:59] he said a better fit a better this a
[1:44:03] better debt he said not knowing all the
[1:44:05] time they're walking straight into death
[1:44:08] blinded leading the blind blind leaders
[1:44:11] of the Nations blind leaders of science
[1:44:13] blind leaders of the church blind
[1:44:17] leading the blind Jesus said let them
[1:44:18] alone they'll both fall in the ditch he
[1:44:21] began to break down everything house
[1:44:24] Satan see you and I we just know and
[1:44:27] Isaiah he said how I'm going to exalt
[1:44:29] myself above God how I'm going to do all
[1:44:31] these things but God sent us to
[1:44:33] mentioned this in time to break it down
[1:44:35] how he's able to succeed to get his
[1:44:38] desire fulfilled
[1:44:39] now you and I would never how many you
[1:44:43] don't find many places preaching against
[1:44:44] education like the bride does
[1:44:48] can we say man but we know there's a
[1:44:50] balance education is all right as long
[1:44:53] as you don't get in the way of God
[1:44:56] because you got some smart people and
[1:44:57] they don't let that intellect get in
[1:44:59] their way with God Paul was a smart man
[1:45:02] extremely smart man then the disciples
[1:45:05] weren't a smart man so God could use
[1:45:08] both smart people
[1:45:10] and not so smart people
[1:45:12] as long as they got the Holy Ghost amen
[1:45:15] he's their teacher to teach them and
[1:45:17] guide them what to say and what to do so
[1:45:19] these things are okay now you know Satan
[1:45:24] Satan don't brag so much how he had
[1:45:27] succeeded because one one deceit that
[1:45:31] the world normal nominal don't look at
[1:45:34] that the biggest deceit actually today
[1:45:37] it is through religion
[1:45:40] see many talk about uh seeing on the
[1:45:43] streets and seeing out here in
[1:45:44] prostitution and all this stuff but they
[1:45:47] don't understand what religious sin is
[1:45:49] Satan is here behind that so deep that's
[1:45:52] what people don't catch I was talking to
[1:45:54] an end well I was talking to my my niece
[1:45:57] and I made a statement to her I said
[1:45:59] you're looking for the devil in the
[1:46:01] wrong place I said you always looking
[1:46:02] out on the streets and stuff you don't
[1:46:04] know he stands behind pulpits
[1:46:08] foreign
[1:46:13] something just dropped in my heart but I
[1:46:15] want to read this first
[1:46:19] you know
[1:46:21] Satan unbrack so much and he's so
[1:46:23] thankful of his eating
[1:46:26] in the world when they have their little
[1:46:28] gathering and somebody don't make some
[1:46:30] kind of achievement
[1:46:32] uh some accomplishment you know they
[1:46:35] give a toast
[1:46:36] [Music]
[1:46:37] you know what I'm talking about they say
[1:46:39] we would like to give a toast to our
[1:46:41] brother here accomplishment
[1:46:44] hit the glasses together
[1:46:47] what a great accomplishment
[1:46:49] when Satan brought forth his great
[1:46:51] accomplishment he said I got to give a
[1:46:54] toast
[1:46:55] and he did
[1:46:57] the prophet says right here in Christ
[1:46:58] and mystery God revealed
[1:47:01] he said the Bible in Revelation said
[1:47:03] this great City ring over all the kings
[1:47:05] of the Earth
[1:47:06] said she was a what is that he
[1:47:10] said a woman that claims to be a lady
[1:47:11] and commits fornication she had a cup in
[1:47:15] her hand of toast
[1:47:17] [Applause]
[1:47:19] to the world
[1:47:21] so that cup in her hand
[1:47:23] come and drink up this cup of my great
[1:47:26] achievement that I have accomplished to
[1:47:29] deceive you
[1:47:33] a toast to the world when I read that I
[1:47:36] said that ain't nothing but the truth
[1:47:38] filled with the filthiness of the
[1:47:39] Abominations of a fornication and she
[1:47:42] had daughters the Protestant churches to
[1:47:45] everyone come out of her with her same
[1:47:48] false doctrines baptism he just began to
[1:47:51] break all these things down all of these
[1:47:53] things that was in Satan's mind he's
[1:47:56] actually displaying it through false
[1:47:58] Ministries through false religion all of
[1:48:00] it is coming out now
[1:48:02] and we seed it right now let me just
[1:48:05] backtrack a minute because I'm not
[1:48:06] finished but I want to explain something
[1:48:08] that just fell in my heart
[1:48:12] and this is going to be to young people
[1:48:16] I had something to just recently happen
[1:48:20] and uh
[1:48:22] it just very disturbing
[1:48:25] when you
[1:48:27] many take it lightly
[1:48:30] when the prophet talk about comic books
[1:48:34] many people take that very very lightly
[1:48:40] he said comic books
[1:48:42] setting children's mind up for a blast
[1:48:46] that's what he said
[1:48:49] you know
[1:48:51] everybody don't read comic books
[1:48:55] so the devil
[1:48:56] devil has done in this day
[1:48:59] they have taken see now I come from them
[1:49:02] times I was a cartoonist I lived and
[1:49:05] breathed comic books
[1:49:08] I actually used to draw out of the comic
[1:49:10] books better than the man that drawed it
[1:49:12] himself
[1:49:13] but being an artist this is what I know
[1:49:17] when you draw something you come under
[1:49:20] inspiration
[1:49:22] why you drawing that
[1:49:24] so I had to
[1:49:25] get real inspired to draw these gruesome
[1:49:29] looking pictures and stuff but I called
[1:49:31] it art and it was beautiful but I had
[1:49:33] actually entered into a realm of
[1:49:35] inspiration to be able to draw that so
[1:49:38] his spirits behind it
[1:49:40] right now everybody don't read comic
[1:49:43] books
[1:49:44] so what the devil has done
[1:49:47] I guess in the last couple of years he
[1:49:49] took what was in comic books and made
[1:49:51] him live people
[1:49:54] Spider-Man movies Superman Adventures
[1:50:00] she said they no food he knows you know
[1:50:04] people ain't gonna read comic books
[1:50:06] because it ain't no interest in many
[1:50:07] people but then he thought putting
[1:50:09] Billboards up coming soon Thor coming to
[1:50:12] get some people mind
[1:50:15] can we say Amen now to some people it
[1:50:18] don't affect to some people it do
[1:50:20] but I'm here to tell you the spirits
[1:50:22] behind those things are actually real
[1:50:26] they are real now uh I know myself I
[1:50:31] preach a lot about what you watch what
[1:50:33] you see what you hear affects you I
[1:50:35] preach all those things like that a lot
[1:50:37] and I know sometimes people get tired of
[1:50:39] me saying it but I'm not gonna get tired
[1:50:41] of saying it because I know the
[1:50:43] importance of it amen because people
[1:50:45] just don't really understand how Spirits
[1:50:47] work sometimes
[1:50:50] let me explain something friends
[1:50:53] is very crucial
[1:50:56] to know
[1:50:57] without a shadow of a doubt
[1:51:00] you were born again
[1:51:04] you're full of the Holy Ghost
[1:51:09] because I'm gonna show you a big
[1:51:13] that the devil has done and I'ma read to
[1:51:15] you what the prophet said and he's
[1:51:17] expressing what's in his mind Satan is
[1:51:20] so all of this music
[1:51:22] and all this garbage they got out here
[1:51:25] on the internet what you think
[1:51:27] commercials are for
[1:51:30] they just pop up out of nowhere and all
[1:51:32] of them got music behind them what you
[1:51:35] think that is fun to get in your
[1:51:37] subconsciousness
[1:51:40] do you ever think it's just so amazing
[1:51:42] you can walk into a restaurant
[1:51:45] and they play the music you used to
[1:51:46] listen to
[1:51:48] yeah
[1:51:49] Satan ain't no fool he knew exactly what
[1:51:52] he's doing
[1:51:54] I have been with Brothers before just
[1:51:57] recently we went to a restaurant the
[1:51:59] music was playing he started going
[1:52:01] and then he called himself
[1:52:05] yeah oh yeah
[1:52:09] you remember this sign says
[1:52:12] music is the only thing can enter your
[1:52:14] subconscious without your permission
[1:52:17] science says that
[1:52:20] but look at the deceit Satan is
[1:52:22] expressing everything wanting people to
[1:52:24] worship him I want to be like the most
[1:52:27] high he's doing it today
[1:52:29] let me read this to you
[1:52:32] I know I changed the service a little
[1:52:34] bit but that's okay because this just
[1:52:35] dropped in my heart to tell your young
[1:52:37] people
[1:52:38] don't play with the wrong stuff if it's
[1:52:41] questionable leave it alone
[1:52:44] so is the question come up you see I'll
[1:52:46] just leave it on because who's throwing
[1:52:48] that question to you that's God warning
[1:52:49] you right there just leave it alone walk
[1:52:52] away don't experiment don't explore just
[1:52:54] leave it alone
[1:52:56] man right
[1:53:00] this isn't questions and answers
[1:53:04] they asked a question about uh where did
[1:53:08] the spirits go that was in that man that
[1:53:11] the maniac of gallery
[1:53:14] now he said and that man well you know
[1:53:17] he's talking about
[1:53:19] how the man hung around twos making
[1:53:21] scriptures clothes off he said them
[1:53:23] Spirits are still here
[1:53:26] he said now and that man with some of
[1:53:28] these spirits
[1:53:30] that was cast out in the swine at
[1:53:31] Galleria now he's talking about the man
[1:53:34] that was uh gonna kill him he referring
[1:53:37] to him first and he's now he's
[1:53:39] identifying some of them Spirits was in
[1:53:41] that man because you remember he told
[1:53:42] but a man said he could have kept me
[1:53:44] just as real easy as he wanted to he's
[1:53:45] strong he could have kept me but the
[1:53:48] thing that I love about this so much
[1:53:50] when he came up to the prophet you
[1:53:51] remember God told him not to move then
[1:53:53] he said he said since you challenged us
[1:53:55] uh challenged God you're the one gonna
[1:53:57] bow down but you as a preacher before
[1:53:59] that he beat him up
[1:54:01] [Music]
[1:54:03] can you say Amen but you remember
[1:54:06] before this man in the Bible for they
[1:54:10] got through a mini tried to bind him
[1:54:12] many tried to change him but when he met
[1:54:14] Jesus that's when he spoke
[1:54:17] so now when that spirit that man came to
[1:54:19] brother he knew there's a representative
[1:54:22] of Jesus Christ was on the earth can we
[1:54:24] say Amen so it's the same parallel
[1:54:27] but he says here
[1:54:30] is some of those poor people out here in
[1:54:32] these insane institutions beating their
[1:54:35] heads against paddled by ourselves
[1:54:37] remember
[1:54:38] Devils never die
[1:54:42] Devils always live but there will be a
[1:54:45] time where Devils will have to die
[1:54:49] they will become totally annihilated but
[1:54:51] now they are alive
[1:54:55] he said and they work
[1:54:57] from generation
[1:54:59] two generation
[1:55:01] upon human beings
[1:55:04] some of them in the form of cancer
[1:55:06] some is in the form of epilepsy
[1:55:09] Psalm is in the form of tuberculosis
[1:55:11] they get into the flesh but seemingly
[1:55:14] they are powerfulness until they can get
[1:55:17] into a person
[1:55:18] they have to operate through a person
[1:55:20] which brings to another thought he said
[1:55:23] that the Holy Spirit covers the earth
[1:55:25] but it is almost helpless until it gets
[1:55:29] into you and to me
[1:55:33] and this is what he said God is
[1:55:36] depending on you and I depending on what
[1:55:41] Tabernacles
[1:55:43] he can get in so he can also display
[1:55:47] himself
[1:55:48] [Applause]
[1:55:50] depending on us
[1:55:53] did he say
[1:56:00] s the Earth he said it cannot operate
[1:56:04] until it comes into us we human beings
[1:56:07] to operate now here's what I want to get
[1:56:10] to he said the devil wants to take us
[1:56:13] over to operate unto him
[1:56:17] so when he gets the mild form
[1:56:22] he starts in sin
[1:56:24] he's going to talk about how Satan
[1:56:26] maneuvers
[1:56:28] to try to do something small in
[1:56:30] somebody's life and keep them there
[1:56:33] he says this if he can hold them
[1:56:37] just in a righteous man he ain't talking
[1:56:39] about a righteous man
[1:56:41] if the devil can just put something in
[1:56:43] their life they could even be a
[1:56:44] righteous man
[1:56:46] he said a good man
[1:56:50] and just let him go ahead try to be a
[1:56:53] try to be good like that if he could
[1:56:57] hold him like that until he's dead
[1:57:01] that's just just what he wants to do he
[1:57:06] got it
[1:57:08] because no matter how righteous you are
[1:57:11] how good you are how moral you are how
[1:57:16] clean you are how Earnest you are
[1:57:21] you'll never get to Heaven until you're
[1:57:24] born again
[1:57:25] [Applause]
[1:57:28] so the devil can have somebody living
[1:57:30] righteous
[1:57:31] clean
[1:57:32] pure but it could be a sin that's stuck
[1:57:35] there in their life where they couldn't
[1:57:37] go no further than that to get the
[1:57:38] baptism of the Holy Ghost and say if I
[1:57:41] could just keep them there
[1:57:42] until they die they still comes to me
[1:57:48] that's why I make the statement make
[1:57:50] sure
[1:57:51] you know you were born again
[1:57:55] because when God is sealed in the devil
[1:57:57] is sealed out but Temptation still come
[1:58:00] but you got something inside of you to
[1:58:02] help you fight those Temptations
[1:58:05] amen
[1:58:06] people want to say you don't know what
[1:58:08] I'm going through it's hard
[1:58:11] you can be born again full of the Holy
[1:58:13] Spirit still you go through things
[1:58:15] still you got trial still you got bad
[1:58:18] but you've got something inside of you
[1:58:20] to take you through them
[1:58:23] can we say man go back to the parable
[1:58:25] when they talk about two houses the rain
[1:58:28] descended the floods came give me a
[1:58:31] second man and beat upon the house did
[1:58:33] it then that one was built on Sand then
[1:58:36] they talked about the other one built on
[1:58:37] the Rock but they got the same problems
[1:58:39] rain descended floods came beat on both
[1:58:42] houses but the only difference wouldn't
[1:58:45] fail one did
[1:58:47] so Christians we go through same
[1:58:50] problems in similar fashions that the
[1:58:53] world go through but it's just the only
[1:58:55] difference we stand
[1:58:58] and falling
[1:59:00] I don't say they fall they keep falling
[1:59:02] because we already falling
[1:59:05] these things are important
[1:59:09] praise the Lord
[1:59:11] the devil can just keep you there
[1:59:15] hold him like that until he's dead
[1:59:19] that's why so many people are so
[1:59:21] religious now the devil makes them so
[1:59:23] religious he know they ain't got no Holy
[1:59:26] Ghost but he keeps them so religious and
[1:59:28] they'll say well I don't do this and I
[1:59:29] don't do that I don't do this so I'm
[1:59:30] okay
[1:59:31] none of us okay until you feel with the
[1:59:33] Holy Ghost
[1:59:35] then you're okay
[1:59:37] until then we just religion
[1:59:41] I know that sounds a little blunt but
[1:59:43] it's time to be blunt
[1:59:44] [Applause]
[1:59:45] cause many get discouraged because they
[1:59:47] see people falling why are they falling
[1:59:50] because the house wasn't built right
[1:59:53] when God builds a house it won't fall
[1:59:57] it might need remodeling
[1:59:59] and some repairs on it but it won't fall
[2:00:03] can we say praise the Lord
[2:00:07] amen
[2:00:09] that one dropped in my heart I had to
[2:00:10] share that with your friends
[2:00:14] Satan
[2:00:16] is up to no good
[2:00:20] when I say no good
[2:00:23] no good
[2:00:24] how many you know what no good is
[2:00:27] no good
[2:00:29] his whole thinking his whole makeup his
[2:00:32] whole desire is no good
[2:00:36] and people underestimate
[2:00:39] in John 10
[2:00:42] even though it talks about a thief but
[2:00:43] we know it refers to Satan also
[2:00:46] it says Jesus said I'm the door by me if
[2:00:50] any man enter in he shall be saved shall
[2:00:52] go in and out and find Pastor he said
[2:00:54] but the thief
[2:00:56] come is not
[2:00:58] I just like the way Jesus worded it
[2:01:00] otherwise he telling you the things
[2:01:02] cometh not in other words he got nothing
[2:01:04] that's on his mind but this
[2:01:07] the still
[2:01:09] to kill and destroy other words he got
[2:01:12] no other motive interjected but kill
[2:01:14] still and Destroy now you say how could
[2:01:17] you apply that to Satan being the thief
[2:01:19] you know what the the what it says he
[2:01:21] come to do kill still destroy all you
[2:01:24] got to do is compare that to Peter when
[2:01:26] he said that the devil going around like
[2:01:28] a roaring lion seeking who he may devour
[2:01:32] that word devour means destroy so we
[2:01:35] still talking about the same person
[2:01:36] that's the only thing the devil got in
[2:01:39] his mind kill still destroyed
[2:01:42] want to steal your joy destroy your life
[2:01:45] and kill you
[2:01:49] now I'm gonna say something friends
[2:01:54] when it comes to this message
[2:02:00] when a person been in this don't come in
[2:02:03] contact with the word of Life the
[2:02:05] trueness of this message
[2:02:08] and the devil knows that
[2:02:12] the devil loves it
[2:02:14] when he can get somebody
[2:02:17] to fall
[2:02:19] in this message
[2:02:21] he loves it more for somebody to fall in
[2:02:24] the message than out there in the number
[2:02:26] of the churches
[2:02:27] [Applause]
[2:02:29] he loves it more
[2:02:30] he said why you say that brother birdie
[2:02:32] I said it to say this
[2:02:35] the devil we'll get more Glory
[2:02:39] for himself
[2:02:41] and a backslider
[2:02:43] than just killing somebody
[2:02:48] oh I know you're thinking
[2:02:52] out of all of the problems
[2:02:54] Samson caused those Philistines
[2:02:58] why didn't they just immediately kill
[2:02:59] him
[2:03:01] so we got him now to kill him
[2:03:04] no they want to kill him
[2:03:07] they wanted to make sport
[2:03:10] mockery
[2:03:13] to be able to display him
[2:03:15] where's your power now
[2:03:18] oh look at you weak you're nothing now
[2:03:20] that was more glory for the devil than
[2:03:23] having Sampson in that situation
[2:03:25] the same thing today if you can have
[2:03:27] somebody backslitting
[2:03:29] and the devil can get people the point
[2:03:31] and they went to church all those years
[2:03:33] look at them now
[2:03:35] I guess God ain't real
[2:03:37] I guess this message ain't real I guess
[2:03:39] the Holy Ghost can't keep you I might as
[2:03:42] well go ahead and live any kind of way
[2:03:43] too they fail they fail Satan like yes
[2:03:46] yes
[2:03:50] those are facts
[2:03:53] that's why I preach on now more than
[2:03:56] ever you must be born again
[2:03:59] which you don't become teachings people
[2:04:01] don't really want to hear no more
[2:04:04] yeah come on give me some seals brother
[2:04:07] break some seals down to him all of that
[2:04:09] comes with it
[2:04:11] but where's your foundation
[2:04:14] when you can have all of this knowledge
[2:04:16] I know many know how to clear revelation
[2:04:19] on the Deep mysteries of God
[2:04:22] and therefore
[2:04:25] not singing it friends
[2:04:27] that's why I got to be here first
[2:04:30] must be born again
[2:04:32] [Applause]
[2:04:36] the devil
[2:04:38] what's in his mind
[2:04:39] Jesus said when he speaks in Luke 8
[2:04:42] about the seeds he said those by the
[2:04:44] wayside uh they that here
[2:04:47] you should then cometh the devil
[2:04:51] and taking away the word out of their
[2:04:54] hearts I like the way he put it they
[2:04:56] hear the word he said but then come the
[2:04:58] devil and take the word out of their
[2:05:01] hearts
[2:05:02] because the devil knows if he can get
[2:05:04] the word out of a person's heart he got
[2:05:06] him
[2:05:07] you can have the word in your heart and
[2:05:09] not be born again but on your way
[2:05:13] can we say amen and because you're
[2:05:15] keeping the word before you're in loving
[2:05:16] the word you're on your way there to get
[2:05:18] the Holy Ghost but if the devil start
[2:05:20] getting you to doubt the word snatch
[2:05:22] that out of your heart he said I got you
[2:05:27] can we say praise the Lord
[2:05:30] if Peter 5 and 8 be so will be villager
[2:05:33] because your adversary the devil
[2:05:35] as a roaring lion walketh about seeking
[2:05:39] whom he may devour to me that's from
[2:05:41] strong reading
[2:05:43] it telling you what's in his mind his
[2:05:45] very purpose he ain't looking for nobody
[2:05:47] to love
[2:05:49] Satan ain't looking for nobody to love
[2:05:52] he looking for somebody to devour
[2:05:54] that's what's in his mind
[2:05:57] can we say Amen then when it come to job
[2:06:00] God went right to the point when Satan
[2:06:02] came he says now there was a day when
[2:06:05] the sons of God came to present
[2:06:06] themselves before the Lord Satan came
[2:06:08] also among them
[2:06:11] and the Lord said it to say once come
[2:06:15] has died God already know where he come
[2:06:17] from God already
[2:06:19] what his purpose was I'm glad God
[2:06:21] actually so Satan can reply so you and I
[2:06:23] know what's in Satan's mind
[2:06:27] then Satan answered the Lord and said
[2:06:29] from going to
[2:06:31] and fro in the earth walking from
[2:06:35] walking up and down in it
[2:06:38] but what is his purpose
[2:06:40] now God's going to bring God exactly
[2:06:42] what's in his mind Satan just told God
[2:06:45] oh
[2:06:46] minding my business going up and down to
[2:06:48] and from you know just enjoying the
[2:06:50] scenery that God will go right through
[2:06:52] what's in his mind this is what God Said
[2:06:54] God said and say how do I considered him
[2:06:57] I servant job
[2:06:58] he went right what was the Satan man
[2:07:01] [Applause]
[2:07:03] look how Satan put it you know just
[2:07:05] walking around
[2:07:07] uh God said no I know you're naughtiness
[2:07:10] I know what's in your mind and I'm gonna
[2:07:13] call it out you considered a joke
[2:07:18] hello
[2:07:19] you remind me of some of these slick
[2:07:20] Mars when you actually what are you
[2:07:21] doing oh are you doing that
[2:07:23] oh I'm just you know standing over here
[2:07:26] no you're not you're scoping
[2:07:28] foreign
[2:07:40] looking for a girl
[2:07:43] looking at her conscience
[2:07:45] let's see is she going through something
[2:07:47] so they can spread their nice little
[2:07:50] words
[2:07:54] I call them predators
[2:07:56] [Applause]
[2:07:59] he said brother birdy that is pretty
[2:08:00] cold no that's what a predator does a
[2:08:03] lion might be the strongest they say of
[2:08:04] the Jungle but he's smart too he looked
[2:08:07] for a weak wildebeest
[2:08:09] [Applause]
[2:08:16] [Applause]
[2:08:18] and that's what predators do
[2:08:23] I went straight to Satan's mind you can
[2:08:26] you considered my servant job
[2:08:29] there is nothing like him in the Earth
[2:08:32] [Music]
[2:08:34] perfect
[2:08:35] outright man wasn't that feared God and
[2:08:39] it sewage evil I wish I could be
[2:08:41] building that congregation conversation
[2:08:43] God is telling Satan that say I say wait
[2:08:45] I can just see Satan when God telling
[2:08:48] him that God lock him in the earth safe
[2:08:51] yeah right
[2:08:53] I can change that God just bragging on
[2:08:56] Joe
[2:08:57] and like the prophet said could he do
[2:08:58] that about you
[2:08:59] I'll say yes God can't brag on this
[2:09:02] bride why can God brag on his bride
[2:09:04] because the prophecy went forth she will
[2:09:07] not fall like Eve had fallen so God can
[2:09:10] brag on his bride so she ain't gonna
[2:09:12] fall do whatever you want to do to us
[2:09:14] say she ain't gonna fall
[2:09:18] I just love it
[2:09:21] Satan says here
[2:09:24] Satan answered the Lord and said the job
[2:09:26] feel God for not this is picture here
[2:09:29] friend job is minding his business
[2:09:32] enjoying his wife just just having a
[2:09:34] good time and he don't even know God and
[2:09:36] Satan talking about it
[2:09:42] you and I don't understand what we're
[2:09:43] going on in the other realms them
[2:09:45] conversation still goes on
[2:09:47] they still go on saying I can make
[2:09:50] nothing fall guards no you can't
[2:09:52] all right can't do it so you say all
[2:09:54] right move the head you go move it
[2:09:57] I'll move go ahead
[2:09:59] I preached on his years ago and I
[2:10:01] remember preaching on removing the Hedge
[2:10:02] that wasn't the title but I used that
[2:10:04] statement because you got to catch the
[2:10:06] impact of how much courage
[2:10:09] and faith God had in job he had so much
[2:10:12] faith in job till he was willing to move
[2:10:15] his protection from job and prove to the
[2:10:17] devil job can beat you without me
[2:10:19] helping you helping you
[2:10:21] [Applause]
[2:10:24] that's why that's why everything's going
[2:10:26] wrong with pressure now got to move the
[2:10:29] hedges from the bride and telling Satan
[2:10:32] she ain't gonna fall
[2:10:34] she don't need me to help cause I'm in
[2:10:37] her she got what's inside of her that's
[2:10:40] going to whip you safe so I'm just gonna
[2:10:41] stand back I'm just gonna watch
[2:10:47] that's the confidence God has in his
[2:10:49] bride friends
[2:10:52] have not made it hey he said hath not
[2:10:55] Thou made an edge about it
[2:10:57] see how Satan understood this brother
[2:11:00] yeah he already know the boundaries but
[2:11:03] God done he do the same thing to you and
[2:11:06] me he know he know all about you
[2:11:08] [Applause]
[2:11:10] and about his house
[2:11:12] and about all that he hath on every side
[2:11:14] Satan knew your family Satan knew he
[2:11:18] renewed I can't even touch the children
[2:11:21] Casa Joe
[2:11:23] he didn't touch his house because of job
[2:11:25] that's why it's so important for us
[2:11:27] parents that make sure we're in favor
[2:11:29] with God doing what we're supposed to do
[2:11:31] in our whole got to take care of your
[2:11:33] children God will take care of your
[2:11:34] house you just stay right with God he
[2:11:36] does it that's your proof right there
[2:11:41] even when Satan children went out and
[2:11:43] party I mean children wouldn't party Joe
[2:11:46] prayed for
[2:11:47] he said pre-advisor they might sin and
[2:11:50] the prophet said that's what a good
[2:11:52] parents should do you never know what
[2:11:54] your children are going to be getting to
[2:11:55] involved but you can always pray and
[2:11:57] keep them before God say God I commit
[2:11:59] them to you
[2:12:02] I've never seen a time like it is now
[2:12:06] where marriages is being destroyed
[2:12:12] never seen a time like this
[2:12:15] but it's happening
[2:12:17] because of pressure
[2:12:21] let me tell you
[2:12:23] I don't understand why people think
[2:12:24] their marriage can survive
[2:12:27] without communication
[2:12:32] your relationship with God can't survive
[2:12:34] without communication
[2:12:38] he wants to fellow shoot with you he
[2:12:40] wants to talk to you he wants to
[2:12:41] communicate with you
[2:12:43] and if that be so that God that also is
[2:12:45] in the natural
[2:12:48] and I'm talking about communication not
[2:12:49] complaints communication
[2:12:52] I'm talking about communicating
[2:12:54] talking to one another
[2:12:57] it makes marriage healthy
[2:12:59] what are you talking to one another
[2:13:01] [Applause]
[2:13:03] long time people don't understand
[2:13:07] why would I say something
[2:13:08] it hurts my wife feeling when I say
[2:13:10] something to hurt my husband feeling
[2:13:12] it just really tears them up
[2:13:14] and I said that's good hey
[2:13:17] what you mean that's good that's good
[2:13:21] what's bad when there's no feelings
[2:13:25] then you'll become indifferent
[2:13:28] when she say something to you whatever
[2:13:32] you say something here whatever just
[2:13:33] rolls right off that's bad
[2:13:37] but when it can hurt at least know that
[2:13:41] there's feelings still there
[2:13:44] [Applause]
[2:13:46] you see what you said hurt me and if you
[2:13:49] got finished I didn't mean to what was
[2:13:51] now you can communicate about it
[2:13:55] foreign
[2:13:55] [Applause]
[2:14:00] gotta communicate
[2:14:03] but Chad I might say I'm I would close
[2:14:05] the note because it ain't working
[2:14:09] let's just give some stories
[2:14:11] I just give some stories
[2:14:19] how many you ever read this quote
[2:14:22] I probably don't preached it here but I
[2:14:24] say it again it's one of my favorites
[2:14:29] when that little girl
[2:14:31] boy left her
[2:14:33] and she kept screaming Johnny I know
[2:14:35] Johnny loves me anybody ever read that
[2:14:37] quote
[2:14:39] I know Johnny loves me I know Johnny
[2:14:41] loves me
[2:14:45] you gotta remember what the prophet said
[2:14:48] he heard her he broke her heart
[2:14:51] he said but then she formed herself
[2:14:55] in that world
[2:14:59] she made that she was he was married to
[2:15:01] another girl but still she said I know
[2:15:03] Johnny loves him I know Johnny left she
[2:15:06] created that world
[2:15:08] I think president stage of my Ministry
[2:15:10] or ever present from
[2:15:12] the president ever present water from
[2:15:14] The Rock
[2:15:15] the prophet said
[2:15:17] there's enough power in you
[2:15:20] in me you can go create your own private
[2:15:23] world
[2:15:24] and live in it
[2:15:25] he said but there's if it wasn't a law
[2:15:27] to it you could do it
[2:15:30] that power is in you now
[2:15:34] I'm here to tell you
[2:15:36] you also have the power in you
[2:15:39] to create the wrong world
[2:15:41] [Applause]
[2:15:45] create the wrong world
[2:15:48] as a pastor
[2:15:51] I see Time After Time After Time
[2:15:54] dealing with people
[2:15:56] I just begin to realize they created a
[2:16:00] wrong world that they live in it
[2:16:03] and as far as they are concerned
[2:16:05] everybody else is wrong because they are
[2:16:08] not in their world
[2:16:09] [Applause]
[2:16:10] them things that get you keep and grip
[2:16:13] you
[2:16:17] a man can do it a woman can do it you
[2:16:20] can create those wrong worlds
[2:16:23] but I like what he said when he was
[2:16:25] talking to this girl
[2:16:27] God showed him a vision
[2:16:29] he said some transaction happened
[2:16:31] between her and that boy
[2:16:33] and when he told her she snapped out of
[2:16:35] that world
[2:16:37] and then he said now that you're out of
[2:16:39] that world look towards Calvary
[2:16:42] so it took a supernatural element of
[2:16:45] vision to make a snap out of that world
[2:16:48] and I find that's the same thing it
[2:16:50] takes something to strike a person's
[2:16:52] heart to pull them out of the world that
[2:16:55] they don't form themselves in it because
[2:16:57] when you get yourself in Worlds you
[2:17:00] actually become right in your own world
[2:17:02] and it's right to you
[2:17:04] [Applause]
[2:17:10] all right
[2:17:13] back in April
[2:17:16] my wife
[2:17:18] it was a birthday
[2:17:23] but in February
[2:17:25] my daughter called me she said Daddy

[2:17:37] hall at the church and you got to get
[2:17:40] her there without knowing it's a party
[2:17:42] actually okay

[2:17:48] that was in February then Here Comes
[2:17:50] April get close to her birthday but no I
[2:17:53] see what I did as soon as my daughter
[2:17:55] told me that I think it was the next day

[2:17:59] this year for your birthday

[2:29:43] to happen
[2:29:45] you're gonna start walking around your
[2:29:47] house
[2:29:48] I call it zombie mode
[2:29:51] I'm not saying it to be funny
[2:29:52] you'll be in your house
[2:29:55] functioning without an anointing
[2:30:00] you just go through motions cook he
[2:30:02] likes doing something they like
[2:30:04] because you're in your own world nobody
[2:30:07] appreciates me now
[2:30:09] because when you feel appreciated you
[2:30:12] just
[2:30:13] cook
[2:30:14] I mean you excited
[2:30:17] because you you feel appreciated but
[2:30:19] when you get in that wrong world
[2:30:22] everything come down
[2:30:26] same as a man
[2:30:29] when you don't feel appreciated
[2:30:31] look at the children look at that they
[2:30:34] always wanting something buy me this and
[2:30:36] buy me that but they don't see where it
[2:30:38] comes from when I have to go through to
[2:30:40] get it and stuff
[2:30:42] you're creating the world
[2:30:45] and when you create another word it
[2:30:46] cause you to respond wrong
[2:30:50] you start being negative
[2:30:52] and bitter yeah
[2:30:54] because it's your world you created and
[2:30:57] you think everybody got to come in it
[2:31:00] all right it ain't right that's not
[2:31:03] right
[2:31:04] we ought to live in a world of faith
[2:31:08] believing the promises of God knowing
[2:31:11] who we are that we are the Bride of
[2:31:14] Jesus Christ
[2:31:15] that's where we ought to be living amen
[2:31:17] amen not in the Doom of Gloom she's all
[2:31:19] kind of Worlds I can name all different
[2:31:22] ones I know it's getting a little late
[2:31:23] there's a different world we create and
[2:31:26] they be wrong
[2:31:28] a lot of people create worlds just by
[2:31:31] looking at services on the internet
[2:31:33] then they create a world against their
[2:31:34] own church
[2:31:38] well our church don't do that
[2:31:40] look what they do in their Church
[2:31:42] we don't do that then they come in
[2:31:44] nature
[2:31:50] own little world
[2:31:52] only thing in church is their body
[2:31:55] not the spirit
[2:31:56] [Applause]
[2:32:00] children do that stuff
[2:32:02] boys do that girls do that create worlds
[2:32:05] and they be the wrong ones everybody
[2:32:08] that she got a girlfriend she don't got
[2:32:10] well she got a boyfriend well that's
[2:32:12] around the message too
[2:32:19] I don't know who thought that
[2:32:21] that homosexual Spirit won't come around
[2:32:23] message Believers I don't know who
[2:32:24] thought it won't but
[2:32:26] that's the main place you to try to come
[2:32:29] because we got to remember
[2:32:32] it was so bad they wanted angels
[2:32:36] as close as you can get their own Angels
[2:32:38] around the pride of Jesus Christ
[2:32:40] they wanted them
[2:32:42] that's how bad it's getting
[2:32:44] and people don't realize this stuff
[2:32:46] talk to your children talk to your
[2:32:49] daughters talk to your son
[2:32:51] if you got to talk about question they
[2:32:54] might get tired of hearing but still
[2:32:55] keep planting them seeds and let them
[2:32:58] know the program of God your son your
[2:33:00] daughter God you can you can live a half
[2:33:02] to have a happy life happy healthy
[2:33:05] marriage you can have it just just put
[2:33:07] God before everything yeah
[2:33:11] sometimes you might seem like it ain't
[2:33:13] doing it I promise you the scripture
[2:33:15] said train them on the way they should
[2:33:16] go
[2:33:19] praise the Lord
[2:33:20] the worlds
[2:33:23] I'm a pastor
[2:33:25] I've been guilty of creating my own
[2:33:28] world
[2:33:30] oh yeah I've done it
[2:33:32] so I'm not just putting the fingers I
[2:33:34] can preach from experience
[2:33:37] Church don't really appreciate me
[2:33:41] I don't know well
[2:33:45] they don't want me I just leave I can
[2:33:47] leave I got no problem either
[2:33:50] shall create the world
[2:33:53] creating but then all of a sudden
[2:33:55] somebody say but apparently oh that
[2:33:59] service
[2:34:01] right on the money thank you do you come
[2:34:04] out of that world
[2:34:06] I appreciate that
[2:34:08] you create these worlds man
[2:34:11] is that correct that's why it's good to
[2:34:14] appreciate one another tell one another
[2:34:16] I appreciate you
[2:34:18] I was just reading the text my wife had
[2:34:20] sent me she said brother thank God for
[2:34:24] you being my husband
[2:34:26] and my pastor
[2:34:29] that made me feel pretty good
[2:34:32] you're my husband
[2:34:34] you're my pastor
[2:34:36] but these words we create friends
[2:34:39] they are real
[2:34:41] may God bless you my everything changed
[2:34:43] but this is what's in my heart
[2:34:46] praise the Lord if you got problems I
[2:34:49] like to tell the young people
[2:34:51] if you're struggling you got problems
[2:34:53] don't keep it to yourself
[2:34:56] talk to your parents be honest with your
[2:34:58] parents even if it hurt them just just
[2:35:01] say mama I need to talk
[2:35:03] let it out don't try to handle it by
[2:35:06] yourself
[2:35:06] let it out
[2:35:08] praise the Lord my son
[2:35:11] he tell me some things what he used to
[2:35:13] do when he was a child well I couldn't
[2:35:16] believe you've done stuff like that he
[2:35:17] we didn't laugh about it wasn't bad
[2:35:18] stuff
[2:35:20] that he did some of this stuff in his
[2:35:22] imagination
[2:35:24] he's a daddy
[2:35:27] he said man
[2:35:30] he said I know I had got in trouble
[2:35:34] he said you came home that particular
[2:35:36] day
[2:35:38] he said he was eating your dinner see my
[2:35:41] son my youngest one I always knew when
[2:35:43] he was in trouble
[2:35:46] he won't eat
[2:35:48] and that boy loves to eat whenever he
[2:35:50] won't come to the dinner table and eat
[2:35:52] I know he don't got in trouble in school
[2:35:55] it never fail
[2:35:58] he loses his appetite
[2:36:02] because he did
[2:36:03] when I
[2:36:05] seen you eat your food when you put that
[2:36:07] spoon to your mouth you try to send your
[2:36:09] muscles on your arm
[2:36:11] [Applause]
[2:36:13] he's like oh this man gonna kill me
[2:36:15] [Applause]
[2:36:17] this is why you crazy
[2:36:19] he's about daddy
[2:36:21] he's a one-day user security to give me
[2:36:23] a whiffing
[2:36:24] and then one of your friends popped up
[2:36:27] I said hey you want to go fishing
[2:36:30] he said then you say
[2:36:32] yeah let's go
[2:36:34] he said then you looked at me and said
[2:36:36] I'm gonna get you when I come back
[2:36:40] he said that I went in my room and I
[2:36:42] prayed to God
[2:36:44] you'll forget
[2:36:48] pray
[2:36:50] he I guess God answered his prayer
[2:36:53] so God got ways to make children pray
[2:36:58] so God answered his prayer I think I
[2:37:00] forgot
[2:37:01] but he could tell me those things
[2:37:04] but I had to ask myself
[2:37:07] what did I project
[2:37:10] to make him feel that way though then
[2:37:12] I'm some kind of brief father
[2:37:15] what did I do so I don't want to project
[2:37:17] nothing like that I want to know yes I'm
[2:37:20] your father but when I have to correct
[2:37:21] you I will because that's my job that's
[2:37:24] my duty and the correction is not to
[2:37:26] kill you it's to help you
[2:37:28] could disappearance Duty
[2:37:31] choose and be like ah yeah no the Bible
[2:37:33] said let them jump it won't kill them
[2:37:38] yeah but it won't kill children into
[2:37:42] nothing but this day is about the
[2:37:43] psychologist
[2:37:45] they can play with your emotions
[2:37:48] huh they they can say some stuff that
[2:37:51] throw you off track
[2:37:53] they can do it I just never forget even
[2:37:55] my son one day he just messed up
[2:37:58] my son I'm gonna have to I'm not
[2:38:00] discipline
[2:38:01] I have to discipline he really did
[2:38:03] something bad
[2:38:05] he pleaded so bad Daddy no Daddy Daddy
[2:38:09] please he starts saying Mercy Mercy
[2:38:14] he said that Mercy with so much
[2:38:16] compassion to start bothering my mind
[2:38:19] [Applause]
[2:38:21] the scripture come in my mind
[2:38:23] show no mercy receive no mercy
[2:38:26] that's our passion that he was it really
[2:38:28] messed me up but I had to push all that
[2:38:30] reason aside the son you stepped over
[2:38:32] Grace
[2:38:34] but with Grace I have to be a
[2:38:36] disciplined parent I have to I have to
[2:38:38] do it can we get the Lord a hand I'm
[2:38:41] gonna stop for the Chad
[2:38:43] oh
[2:38:45] no more coming up so I'm gonna stop may
[2:38:49] the Lord bless you it's a little late
[2:38:51] but I got a lot in my heart but trust me
[2:38:55] God changed the service
[2:38:57] and I just prayed something was said to
[2:39:00] help you
[2:39:01] because that's my I'm telling your
[2:39:03] pastor that's my only interest if I
[2:39:05] can't help nobody I won't I won't do I'd
[2:39:06] rather not do nothing I can't help say
[2:39:09] something to help
[2:39:10] that's my whole motor energy always has
[2:39:13] been to try to help people
[2:39:16] see them watch them grow in the Lord
[2:39:18] this will have been my motive and
[2:39:20] ejected since I've been in this message
[2:39:22] yeah you get you misinterpret it
[2:39:24] sometimes that you're a legalist or hard
[2:39:26] I'm over all that kind of stuff because
[2:39:28] I know what's in my heart
[2:39:30] this is what I know you can't play with
[2:39:33] spirits
[2:39:35] don't play with the Devil
[2:39:38] this is my own Hearts musicianship huh
[2:39:55] maybe we could uh
[2:39:56] you played it song Draw Me nearer
[2:40:00] you know that song brother
[2:40:02] dropped me nearer I think that's a
[2:40:04] wonderful song
[2:40:06] for us that we want to be drawn nearer
[2:40:08] to him
[2:40:09] I know I do
[2:40:12] and he's the one that does the joy
[2:40:14] he pulls on us
[2:40:16] and I'm so thankful that he does
[2:40:19] if I'm asked the question how do you
[2:40:20] know God loves you
[2:40:22] I said man the way he beats me
[2:40:24] the way he corrects me I know he loves
[2:40:27] me
[2:40:28] he's a true father let's pray father
[2:40:34] we shall thank you for your word
[2:40:37] things just change Lord but that's okay
[2:40:41] I think about what the prophet said that
[2:40:43] any Minister knows
[2:40:45] when you want to change the direction
[2:40:46] they know to leave the notes alone
[2:40:49] and that's what we did Lord because some
[2:40:52] things I just really felt need to be fed
[2:40:54] and I know it's not going to return void
[2:40:57] gotta go exactly what you where your
[2:41:00] purpose is to go
[2:41:01] my father I just pulled out my heart
[2:41:03] this evening
[2:41:04] trying to show
[2:41:05] even what's in Satan's mind
[2:41:08] is up to no good it's deceiving to get
[2:41:12] people to feel
[2:41:14] religious but not born again
[2:41:17] Sanctified but not filled with the Holy
[2:41:19] Spirit
[2:41:20] Satan is such a deceptive deceiver in
[2:41:22] these things but I'm so thankful oh God
[2:41:25] for predestination
[2:41:27] that everything is into your hands or
[2:41:29] God is Not Me choosing you you chose me
[2:41:32] and I'm also thank you for the scripture
[2:41:34] that whenever you start a good work Lord
[2:41:36] you're also going to finish it
[2:41:38] and we're going to be just like Paul
[2:41:40] we're fully persuaded that we commit to
[2:41:43] you Lord that you'll carry it through
[2:41:45] so father we thank you this evening and
[2:41:47] I pray that you just really dealt with
[2:41:49] the heart of a young person
[2:41:51] to let them just be careful of the
[2:41:53] things
[2:41:54] that's the surrounding them because we
[2:41:57] got choices
[2:41:58] nobody can force us to do nothing we
[2:42:00] also could say no we have choices
[2:42:02] and may we just recognize hey I'm a Son
[2:42:05] of God I might be in this little to see
[2:42:08] an age but I'm not a little sin
[2:42:10] I am a son and daughter of the Lord
[2:42:12] Jesus Christ so father I just commit
[2:42:14] everything to you and into your hands in
[2:42:17] the name of Jesus Christ we pray
