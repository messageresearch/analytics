the preeminence this morning amen so you pray for me amen you pray for me amen well let's take a bies this morning amen and let's open to the book of Samuel 1 Samuel amen 1st Samuel chapter 30 amen the book of Samuel I have a little bit of a little bit of a lenty reading but amen 1 Samuel chapter chapter 30 verse verse 1 to verse 8 and then we'll jump to chapter chapter um yeah we're contining in chapter 20 we just jump to verse 18 and 19 so first pel 20 verse 1 to8 and then Verse 18 18 to 19 amen the scripture says that says and it came to pass when David and his men were come to zag on the third day that the am malachit had invaded the site and zlac and smitten zlac and burned it with fire and had taken the women captive that were therein they slew not any e gr or small but carried them away and went on the way so David and his men came to the city and behold it was burned with fire and the wives and the sons and your daughters were taken captive then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no no more power to weep and David's two wies were taken captive aoam the jezreelite and abigael the wife of nabal the carite and David was greatly distressed for the people spake of stoning him because the soul of of because the soul of the people was graved and every man for his son and for his daughter but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God and David said toat the priest the him like son I pray thee bring me here to the airort and abat brought T the airort to David and David inquired at the Lord saying Shalo pursue after the tro Shalo overtake them and he answered them and he answered him pursue for thou shall surely overtake them and with they fell recover all amen let's just jump to verse 18 and 19 and David recovered all the all that the am malachite had carried away and David rescued the two wives and there was not in lack unto them neither small nor great neither Sons nor daughter neither spoil nor anything that they had taken to them David recovered all amen may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word you may have you seed amen if you want to take a title this morning amen we we we want to speak on without fail recover all amen with day fail recover all amen we we know that we're living in an age amen we're living in an age of the greatest battle that has ever been fought amen as an age of the greatest battle that's s been fought and we know that this battle is not it's not a caral battle amen the battle ATT that we're facing is not a caral battle but it's a spiritual battle amen and if we look in the book of Ephesians Ephesians chapter 6 verse verse 10 to 15 will say finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against the voids of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spir spiritual Wicked winess in holy places amen so Paul is showing us that a battle that we're facing is not a caral battle amen we're facing enemies that are operating in a spiritual Dimension amen no matter what we we we do no matter what we face no matter what comes away it is a power it is something that is fighting against us it's the enemy that that is encroaching us now I just want to read a quote here from brother Brandon in the service a blushing Prophet you know brother brandom is coming to the end of the service and and as he come to the end of the service there are people at the altar and they praying and they calling on the Lord and brother brandham will begin to make the statement and you say to see these young women coming weeping Lo before them he said they are at a crossroad he said they are a victim of circumstances and then brother brand began to say Do You Realize old man when we were boys our boys has got 10 times the Temptation that we had it says sister do you realize that your daughter has 10 times The Temptations you had when you was a girl is said that will that will her daughter have is said what will her daughter have look at the T the pictures the devil's paint amen so brother Brandon is saying listen you know and this is 1956 and was telling the the older man there to say listen your children are going to have 10 times the Temptation that you had amen now if we were to do the calculation you can only imagine what the Temptation is today that we are faced as parents as young people whatever age you are the Temptation has increased amen and this temptation that we are facing it is not just the natural temptation but it's a spiritual Temptation it's a battle that is going on in our minds amen it's not a physical battle but it's a battle that is going on in our mind amen if we were if we were to trace you know any any Temptation that we face if we were to trace you know any lukewarm Spirit or we were to trace any trouble in the home or any trouble in the church if we were to trace it back we will always find out or most of the time we will find that that the root course of it began with a thought that was contrary to the word amen amen if you trace back any issue whether it be in the home whether it be in the church whether it be in your own personal life if you trace it all the way back you will find out that somewhere you receive the thought somewhere you accepted the thought somewhere you accepted something that was contrary to the word of God Amen and when you were accepted that what did you do it was like you took in you a seed amen and when you took that seed into your mind it begin to mature amen it begin to mature and as it began to mature every seed when you take it and you plant it and it begins to mature it'll begin to bring forth fruits amen so if you take an evil seed and you keep feeding on it and allowing it to mature it'll begin to bring forth negativity amen and so it'll begin to bring forth trouble in a home or or trouble in your life or whatever it is why because you took a seed that was contrary to the word of God but if you were to take the word of God in your mind the word of God in your mind will begin to bring forth the fruit of the word it'll begin to bring forth peace it'll begin to bring forth Joy it'll begin to bring forth unity in the home why because it is the word of God Amen so whatever seed you take in your mind and you allow it to mature it will bring forth the fruit and you know brother brand would say there is where we are facing our greatest battle amen it is in our mind amen because we have being bombarded by the enemy from every front amen you walk down the street the enem is bombarding you in your mind wherever you go you have a bombarding of the enemy but on the other hand there is a God of destroying to get a hold of you there is a God of a try to fulfill a second fold purpose which is to have the preeminence in his Bri amen and if we allow him to have that preeminence and so it of it will bring forth the fruits amen it'll bring forth the fruit that the word speaks about amen but if we accept amen the the the thought of the enemy it will yield an evil fruit amen I believe that the church amen has come to a place where we need to recognize the two spirits that are operating in the framework of the church amen we've come to a place where we need to recognize the two spirits that are operating in the framework and in the of the church and resist the Antichrist Spirit now now brother Brandon will speak again in Revelation in the in the church age book Amen in the introduction portion of it brother brand will say now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts is said but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist spirit will come into the church and defoil it making it look warm formal and Powerless is that it exposes Satan revealing his work attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word is that right down to the time he is cast into the Lake of Fire he forced that he cannot standard he said he knows that if the people can get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible Army it said if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and boy God spirit deser and withstand the Antichrist Spirit it that Satan will be powerless beforee it said he will be as definitely toward today as when Christ with stod his every effort to gain power over him in the the do he said yeah Satan hates Revelation but we love it he said with through Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them amen now we we read this quote and we know it very well but you see we can leave it as a quote sitting on a on a page of a book amen we can leave it as a quote sitting on a page of the book but we can take this code amen if we were to take this code and begin to meditate upon it allow this Cod to be a seed on the inside of us because brother Bram is saying that there are two spirits in the framework of the church that is working an antichrist Spirit and the spirit of God but brother brand is saying if we will withstand the Antichrist spirit amen and how are we going to withand it brother bam said that that if we withand it just the way Jesus did I think you Matthew chapter 4 where he Resto with the word he said that the enemy will be just ased as it was when Jesus Resto him that day in Matthew chapter 4 when he came down off the mountain amen he said if we would and then and if we do that it says that the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us amen it can Prevail against the church amen because you see if we don't discern the spirit these two spirits in the framework of the church and listen as I'm talking about the church I'm not just talking about the church as a body now you ought to remember that you are a church amen you are the church yourself you individually you are the church amen so when I'm talking about the church it's not just the group amen but put yourself in the picture amen because within you is a battle amen the true battle is within you brother brand was saying my greatest enemy is not is not anyone else but my greatest enemy is William iron brandham amen and our greatest enemy is our own selves amen there is where the battle is taking place amen there is where the enemy is fighting us amen because these two spirits the church the Antichrist Spirit if we don't withstand it amen it will bring the church to a powerless condition listen if we don't withstand the Antichrist Spirit it'll bring you and me to a powerless situation amen it'll bring us to a place amen where Satan will continually Rob us amen Satan will continually Rob us and Rob us and Rob us why because we are not recogniz them and withand them that Spirit are destroying to rob the seed of God has been predestinated and placed on the inside of us amen amen but what we want is that true Revelation boy the spirit in our lives that will prevail against amen against the Gates of Hell amen see Satan's tactic of infiltrating into our lives amen is boy invad in our minds amen listen he hasn't changed the way he infiltrates himself into our lives is boy invading our minds amen what does he do he invades our minds and he create camps amen now now we can go back in the Old Testament and and we can we can see the strategy of the enemy you see when the enemy in the Old Testament when he wanted to take a city when the enemy came against the city and wanted to take it you know what they will do there is an instance in the Bible in the Old Testament what the enemy will do is that they will besiege the city amen they will besiege that City amen and when they besiege the city they won't attack it right away but they just sit there they just sit there around the city what are they doing they're not allowing anyone to go out of the city and they not allowing anyone to come into the City and they just leave them just left alone in the city why because they know that there's going to come a time where they're going to run out of resources there's going to come a time they're going to run out of of all the food that they have and so and so they'll just Bes and just sit there and wait until the the city is completely weak amen they'll just sit there and watch and wait until amen they've run out of all their substances if the people don't want to give up right away they'll sit there and wait until the people are weak until the enemy is weak and once everyone is weak what does the enemy do he just walks in and takes it off over amen that's what that that's the way that was one of the strategies by which the enemy would take a city in the Old Testament but you know the enem is doing the same thing to us but in a spiritual in a spiritual way amen listen he will come and he will sit in your mind amen he'll just sit in your mind he'll just give you a thought and just sit there in your mind amen he he's not really doing much but he's just allowing you to just take that thought and just begin to mature that thought are you with me and you just sit there and allow you just to mature it and mature it and very soon you just find yourself being discouraged very soon you just find yourself having trouble with your brother very soon you start finding yourself you know having trouble at home with your wife or with your children what did he do he just sat in your mind he just gave you a thought that was not true amen and you just accepted that thought and when you accepted that thought it begin to mature amen and then he will stay there until you come to a place where you begin to lose your faith in the word of God where you begin to lose your confidence in approaching God now you begin to see the temple starts to rise and different things of your old nature start to rise up again why because he came and he just encamped besiege your city amen he just besieged the seed of God that is on the inside of you what was he doing he was trying to block by reasoning he was trying to block the inflow of the word are you with me he was trying to block the inflow of the word he will get you because once he gets into your mind listen you will sit in a service and the preaching of the word will go forward but you can't receive it amen you can't receive it because there is a thought there is something that Satan has put in you that the word is just passing you boy and you're reasoning every word listen he can bring you to a place where you in the service and the preacher will be preaching and you would think oh he's against me your pastor will be preaching you be thinking he's against me but he's not against you it is the holy ghost that is speaking to the church but because you've allowed a certain thought are you with me this morning because you've allowed a certain thought to take root now you're not being able to receive the word and the word is what you need to fight your battles amen but now you can't receive it because you allow a thought to command and when that thought begins to mature now you can't receive the word there is no inflow of the word and if there is no inflow of the word then there is no outflow of the manifestation of the same word and you know what you've what the enemy has done he has just made you powerless he has just made you powerless that is the Antichrist spirit that is trying to operate and destroy the Church of the Living God well let me say to you this morning I believe that it's time for the bride of Christ to rise above amen it's time for the bride of Christ to rise above the Antichrist Spirit listen brother Brandon will tell us a story above an eagle he said it was an eagle and there was a storm that came and he said that the storm brought down the eagle amen it said the storm brought down the eagle and when the storm brought down the eagle it said now the eagle was sitting down there and there was this squirrel you remember Brandon was watching the scene and it said there was this squirrel that was just going chatter chatter chatter and chatter chatter chatter and brother brand said he thought that the squirrel was speaking was concerned of him but he said when he looked the squirel wasn't really concerned of him but the squirel was concerned of the eagle amen and the eagle was sitting there and it was just L into the chatter chatter of the squirrel amen but it came a point where the eagle got s and tired of the chatter chatter of the squirel are you with me listen it's time for the Brio to begin to get sick and tired of the chatter chatter of the enemy of the many voices that we're hearing it is time for the BR to get to a place where we say I am sick and tired of hearing that this enemy completely you know with a voices that is completely bombarding over and over again my mind and brother Bram said you know what the eagle did he said the eagle just begin to set us when Wings amen it said the eagle began to set his swing brother Bram said I pulled out my rifle and I could have shot that eagle but he said the eagle wasn't worried about me and my rifle amen it said it wasn't worried about me and my rifle because the eagle was trusting in his wings it's time for the church to trust in the word that has been given to us and brother BR said he had two wings and it said it was the old and the New Testament listen when you take the full word when you take the full word the enemy has no power or no authority over you amen it's not just about taking the full word but when you cast the Revelation when you cast the revelation of the word the enemy has no power or authority over you oh hallelujah oh hallelujah it's time to rise up amen it's time to rise up amen oh hallelujah hallelujah he's using the same strategy amen try to block the inflow amen of the word of God remember as we said that the enemy will always start with a thought he will always start with a thought that is slightly contrary to the word of God listen that's exactly what he did to Eve amen he came to Eve with a thought that was slightly contrary to the word of God listen it was 99.999% right amen but that that .1% that was wrong was enough to destroy amen was enough to bring chaos in the order that God has placed amen listen we need to take the full word not just a part of the word amen not just a part of the message that we've received but we need to take it all amen you see the moment Eve the moment Eve begin to listen to listen to that Serpent and what he was saying amen it start to bring Eve to a place where he start to get out of Fellowship amen start to get out of Fellowship amen out of fellowship with the word of God Amen to bring a chm between him and the word but listen I believe that this evening I am not speaking to the first Eve but I believe that this morning I'm speaking to the second Eve and the prophecy that is gone about concerning the second Eve is that the second Eve cannnot be deceived amen there's a prophecy that has gone up over you as the Bry that you can't be deceived now I want you to know that the prophecy wasn't just you know a thought of a man but was God's declaration over you that you cannot are you with me he said that you cannot be deceived amen why because listen you are not just the boy product amen but you are made off of the same seed amen you are a part you are an attribute of god listen right now that you were sitting there it might be hard for you to believe it but right now you were sitting there there is a portion of God on the inside of you are you with me there is a portion of God on the inside of you though it's been covered and wrapped around with your body but in you is God in you is dy amen and if you are being deceived then that means that God can be deceived are you with me if you can be deceived then God can be deceived because you have a portion of God in you that's why he said that you cannot be deceived amen why because you have God in you and God cannot be deceived so you also cannot be deceived amen that is the second Eve that I believe I'm talking to this eve this morning amen I believe that not only am I talking to the second Eve but I'm also talking to a Shar outfit amen now now how many know Shar in the boy you know Samar in the Bible listen I believe that I'm talking to a Samar outfit you know a Samar outfit is the kind of outfit that they get to a place where they begin to come to a revelation of who they are amen that's the sh guy right listen you might have been sitting there and watching the enemy rob you year after year you might have been sitting there watching the enemy rob you service after service listen you might be sitting there watching the enemy destroying your home destroying your family tearing your home apart listen you might be sitting there watching that year after year but listen the shamba outfit comes to a point where they say I am sick and tired of watching this enemy coming year after year Time After Time robbing my crop amen amen sha just had to come to a revelation of who he was and this Bri only has to come to a revelation of who she is amen because when you begin to realize that this whole program is not about you are you with me this whole program is not about you this whole program is not about your flesh this whole program is not about a battle of your face and in your mind but this program is God's program this program is about to predestinate a seed of God that is on the inside of you amen and when you realize that when that seed comes under the Lord amen when it comes under the light of the word it will bring forth its fruit amen and you can go back in the Bible and look at the fruit that it brought forth listen there was no sickness that could stand in the face of Jesus Christ that would not be healed listen the dead was raised amen now you may look at that and say well but that was Miracles and that was in the natural well bring it down to the spiritual what are the dead conditions in your life amen what are the dead conditions in your home what are the dead conditions that you are facing amen listen that same Jesus that walked on Earth amen that the raised up every dead is that same Jesus that is in you boy the Holy Ghost amen he's the same one that is in you boy the Holy Ghost to do what to turn every dead condition into life amen listen the scripture said that he came to B the Brokenhearted Amen to set the Liberty the captive uh to open the prison doors to those that are in prison amen listen that same spirit is still here to operate in you and in me amen that same Jesus is here to open every prison door he's here to set every captive free he's here to do the same thing that he did at the beginning but we are going to have to allow him to do it we are going to have to come to a realization that it's not about your mistakes listen Church the enemy will try to condemn you he man he'll condemn you over and over again well I want to say to you this morning you have been released from condemnation you have been released from any condemnation listen you you may bring to God and say you know I did this and I did that amen you may be sitting here this morning and say you know I'm not worthy to be here I'm not worthy because of what I said or because of what I did or because of what I watched but let me say this the moment you confess it it is gone amen listen forget about your condemnation Satan has used that tactic to rob the church for too long where the people will sit in the church and with condemnation that is not actually the truth because God is not looking at you in the natural God is looking at you through the blood amen and listen when he looks through the blood he sees a perfect picture amen listen God is looking at you as at the seed that is on the inside of you that seed is perfect amen that seed is perfect listen whatever happens on the outside that is not you that is the unredeemed flesh that you are carrying with you don't allow Satan to take that and Rob you because that is not you that is not you listen brother brandham had mistakes but the same brother brandham would speak squir into existence are you with me he was a man amen he was a man he was under a prophetic Ministry indeed he was but he was a man he made mistake and he was he he he he was a Hest man enough to talk about his mistakes to show to us that we are humans and we can make mistakes but the moment we make the mistake and we confess it it is gone amen it is gone like brother Bram talks about the bleach it is gone it's been wiped away he doesn't remember it anymore listen you can go to you can sit in a church and Satan will telling you listen you can't approach God because of this or because of that or because of this or because of that and God is sitting in heaven saying what are you talking about what are you talking about I don't remember any of these things it's been erised it's been put on the sea of God's forgetfulness oh hallelujah it's been put in the sea of God's forgetfulness it is time for us to come to a revelation of who we truly are that we are Sons and Daughters of God and come to a place where you know brother brand said that sham girl's righteous indignation rose up to say I'm sick and tired of this you know we need to come to a place where we I'm sick and tired of watching the enemy over and over again battling me in my mind and rob a me of the promises that God has given me because you know the reason why we we we not seeing the Bible coming to effect in our life the way it's supposed to be is because of Fe it's because the battle in the m that's the reason why is because we we feel like we are unworthy but God has counted you worthy he's already counted you worthy amen so it's time to begin to look at past the mistakes and we're going to make mistakes of course we make mistakes we are always going to make mistakes because of the flesh we are in but God is not looking at your mistake the moment you confess it amen there's a reason why he said confess your sins one to another amen because once it's confessed it's gone amen you are just as perfect as you've never done it in the first place you were Justified amen you were Justified but we need to come to that realization because you see once condemnation begins to hurt then we lose the confidence amen we lose the confidence because you know if your heart condemns you not then have you confidence towards God but when your heart condemns you oh then you have no confidence you're going before God and you're praying but in reality you you have a date in your mind because why you feel like you know I'm not worthy to receive what I'm asking offer but God is saying if you can just have faith if you could just break it past this dat and whatever you you think because God doesn't doesn't doesn't remember it it is the enemy that is trying to remind you of things that have been forgotten and he's using that to rob the church and he's using that to to to take us to a place where we don't have the confidence to go before the Lord in faith and claim what has been given to us amen and the Shamar outfit is those kind of people who come to a place that says you know what I am sick and tired of this I am sick and tired of watching the enemy robing me this way and come to place and say you know what I'm going to take the word I'm going to take the word I'm going to take God out his word and I'm going to believe it and watch God bring his word to pass listen brother Brown talk about God proving his word God is ready to prove his word he's ready to prove his word amen but we have to come to a place where we believe that he can prove his word because he's ready to prove it amen that's where shra had to come to to a place where amen he got to know who he was and when he got to know who he was amen was about I think 6 600 or 6,000 Philistines and he told them all apart amen he told them all apart Bo because he came to know who he is amen listen our mind wasn't given to us to be the playground of the enemy are you with me that's not what our mind was given us to be it's not given to us to be the playgr of the enemy amen but our mind the scripture will tell us he said have the mind of God or have the mind of Christ he said let the mind that is in Christ be in you he said love the Lord with all your mind and your your heart and your mind he will say you know we talk about you know be the same be likeminded one towards the order amen so we can see that the mo is a place where God wants you to operate because listen there is where you begin to meditate upon the word of God Amen listen brother brandom that day when he was sitting there be under that tree do you know what he was doing he was meditating upon the word of God Amen he was creating an atmosphere and then the presence of the Lord through now amen and the scri was spoken into existence but you see we have to come to realization that we are facing two Powers we are facing two Powers there are two powers that are wanting to gain preeminence in our mind amen only two powers and that's the power of Satan and the power of God Amen and I want you to realize that that this power the Battle of these two Powers didn't begin when you were born but the Battle of these two Powers began Ro In Heaven There is where the battle began when Lucifer PR Pride was found in the heart of Lucifer there is where the battle began Isaiah chapter 14: 13-4 will say is that for thou has said in D heart I will Ascend into Heavens is that I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will say is that oil will sit also upon the mate of the congregation in the so of the north is that oil will Ascend above of the he of the CL clouds and it said I will be like the most high who was that that was Lucifer speaking amen Pride Rose upon his heart amen and Lucifer in his attempt in his attempt to overthrow the kingdom of God you with me Lucifer in his attempt to overthrow the kingdom of God you know what he begin to do he begin to get into the mind of some of the angels in heaven amen he begin to get into the mind of some of the Angels in heaven and letting those angels think that he had a better idea than dear Creator had amen it begin to let them think amen that he had a better plan than what the Creator had amen he begin to get them to a place that they begin to doubt dear Creator amen are you with me isn't not exactly what the enemy is doing to us he's trying to get us to a place to dat our creator he's trying to get us to a place to think that he has a better idea than what the creator has he tried to get us to think that we have a better idea than what the bible say that we have a better idea than what the message says that's exactly what he began to do in in heaven try to get into the mind of these angels and the scripture will say that he drew oneir of the angels of heaven with what with his tail in other words with his Lo amen with his Lo he drew oneir of the Angels the were in heaven because he Loy to them and he drew oneir of those angels and these oneir of angels gather themselves together to do what to fight against Michael amen Michael and his angels now we know that Michael is the figurative part or type of Christ amen we know that's what Michael is amen just like you know Jesus was was was was Christ made flesh in the Angelic realm Michael is like the representation of Christ amen and so Lucifer he gathered these angels to fight against Michael and his angels but the scripture will tell us the end of the battle amen the scripture will tell us the end of the battle in Revelation 12 verse 7-9 and it said and there was war in heaven and said Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought against his angels and the scripture says that and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven and it said the Great Dragon was cast out the old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceived the whole world he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him so that is when the battle moved from a Heavenly realm to an Earthly realm and the mo became the battle gra amen the mo became the battle gra but I want you to notice something we believe that we are the predestinated seed of God we came from God and we're going back to God Amen how many believe that this morning that we came from God and we're going back to God so if we reading the scriptures and Revelation is telling us that the battle that took place in heaven between Michel and the devil and his angels amen if we are reading in the scripture that the devil did not Prevail now now if you look back if we came from God then when this battle was taking place in heaven you were there amen when this battle was taking place in heaven you were there your predestinated seed was there fighting this battle amen and the end result of this battle was that the enemy did not Prevail amen the end of this battle was that the enemy was cast out the end of this battle was that the enemy Was Defeated amen so if we were in the battle in heaven and the enemy was cast out and now we've come to the Earth and we are facing the same battle in our mind and we we have the exact same predestinated seed that we had when we were in heaven then you tell me what is going to be the end result of the battle that we are facing now in our mind listen if Satan did not Prevail in heaven then Satan cannot Prevail here on Earth are you with me this morning if it did not Prevail there it can't Prevail here listen no matter what you will face you are greater than the enemy that is battling you in your mind because you see it it in you has already won the battle you see it in you has already overcome the see in you has already cast out the enemy listen that day on the cross when he said that it is finished it was finished every enemy Was Defeated every sickness Was Defeated every battle in the mind was destroyed amen but the BR has to come to a realization the BR has to come to a realiz ation to know that you are a Victor to know that you are a winner you are on The Winning Side you've already overcome you've already won the battle amen all you have to do is stand your grounds stand your grounds listen when they got into Jericho before they got into Jericho the captain of the host of the Lord had already gone forth brother Brandon said you know what the captain did the captain went and weaken the GRS of the walls amen listen there might be walls that have been built in your mind there might be walls that the enemy has placed there that is hindering you from fully producing the power of the word but let me say this to you this morning those walls the foundation of those walls has already been weakened by the captain of the host of the Lord listen brother brandham said that captain of the host of the Lord he said you know you know who he was he said it was the same pill of fire he said the same Pillar of Fire that follow the children of Israel he said that Pillar of Fire had become a man amen he said that Pillar of Fire had become a man and he stood there as the captain of the host of the Lord and he said that same Captain is the same one that stepped down in the form of Jesus Amen are you looking at a trace of him it is the same God as a pillar of fire came down as a captain of the host of the Lord came down in the form of Jesus and what is the holy ghost in you what is the holy ghost in you it is the same Jesus in the form of a spirit in you so if you trace it all the way back it is the same Pillar of Fire that is on the inside of you if you trace it all back it is the same captain that is on the inside of you so no matter what the walls are in your mind those foundations have already been weakened and all they had to do was just March around March around just obey the word because that's what Joshua told them just March around and they March around oh glory be to God listen they March around those walls seven times are you with me this morning they March around those walls seven times what was it it was the seventh age amen at the seventh age they had to March around and a not seven times what was it it was the opening of the seals are you with me this morning it was the opening of the seal in the seventh age at the opening of the seventh seal what did they have to do they had a sh they had a shout you go back in the book of Thessalonians what does it say that the Lord will descend with what with a shout with a voice and with a trump so what was the shout brother brandham said the shout is the message of the hour the shout is the message of the hour you know how you're going to bring down your walls it's boy the the word what was the seven seal it was the third pool what was the third pool it was the opening of the word and other words the speaking of the word you Sav today is when you can speak the word when you begin to speak the word the walls begin to crumble that's the age that you were living in you are living in the age of the S don't allow the enemy to rob you don't allow the enemy to rob you your walls have already been been weakened your walls have already been weaken amen listen the enemy is going to attack you amen he is going to come amen he said he'll come and as a flood amen he'll come and ask a flood but that is not the end of the scripture the scripture says that he'll raise a standard amen so the enemy is going to attack you when you Mo but there will be a standard raised what is the standard is the word and where is the word the word is in the bride you are the standard that has been raised to destroy the works of the enemy but many time we are so afraid we are so afraid to speak the word we are so afraid what if it doesn't happen that is where the enemy gets you right there what is it is a thought that is contrary to the word because he said you say to the mountain and the mountain will move he didn't say if if it will move or maybe it'll move or or what if it doesn't move that's not what the word says but the enemy will come and he'll tell you what if it doesn't you say what if it doesn't happen and right away we listen to that we listen to that and once we start to listen to that what is it is it Tau is a seed it begins to grow and the next thing we know well you know what I might as well not say it because it won't happen you with me this morning I might as well not say because it won't happen I'm going to make it full off myself that is the Loy of the enemy the scripture said you confess the word and it will come to pass listen church it's time to move past the reasoning of the enemy God is ready to fulfill his word he's never going to back off off his word he will bring it to pass but someone is going to have to confess it someone is going to have to speak it someone is going to have to have the faith to say or am standing on it even in the midst of the darkness or am still going to stand on it are you with me listen we had a Seed of Abraham Abraham didn't waver did he make mistakes yes he made mistakes are you with me he made mistakes amen but the scripture in Hebrew says that he did not waver amen why because deep within his soul he believed that he was going to receive that child brother Brenham will tell us the morning day after day he'll ask Sarah listen Sarah how are you feeling Sarah said I feeling no different but BR say and Abraham said well praise the Lord we're going to have to tell that anyhow listen that is the attitude of Abraham's seed that regardless of condition need to praising the Lord to say I will receive my blessing they keep praising the Lord to say my children are coming home listen you might be looking at them in the darkness of hell but God but God God is working on the scene listen God is working on your testimony and you don't even know it God is moving and you don't even see him but one day one day Abraham received a visitation one day he received the visitation listen Church you keep confessing now word and God will bring it to pass listen I was a prodical son I was a prodical son in the world Amen born in a Christian Home born in a believer's home when d a preacher of this message amen but I'm my teenage years being caught away into rock and roll and caught away completely out and doing all the stuff of the world but there was a mom that said wouldn't stop confess my mom will look at me right in my face while I'm playing my rock and roll music and she would tell me you better stop that because one day you were going to be a preacher are you with me she was confessing the word she knew God had made it real to where to say I've given you a boy that is going to carry this message and she kept on telling me you are going to be a preacher one day be careful the way that you were going amen she never wavered she stood there for about 10 years or about seven years caught up in the word world but she never gave up until one day one day listen church I don't care where your son is I don't care where your daughter is God is more than aable to bring them back home if you brought one prodical home he'll bring the other one home and he bring the other one home and he bring the other one home there is nothing too hard for our God there is nothing too hard for our god oh hallelujah oh Hallelujah the fate of a mother the fate of a mother turn a rock star into a star that is standing on the Rock are you with me that's what the fate of a m can do that is what your fate can do are you with me this morning you've got power in you that you don't even realize it is time to release the fate of God that is on the inside of you listen we've been on the back of the fence on the back of the of the of the of the ring for too long it is time to begin to face the enemy we've been taking the punches of the enemy taking the punches of the enemy but it's time to punch back it's time to punch back with the word God is more than able God is more than able oh hallelujah our god is more than able we fighting a battle where these two powers are trying to gain preeminence Satan is trying to gain control to destroy you but God is trying to gain the preeminence to restore amen God is trying to gain the preeminence to do a restoration because you were living in the season of restoration amen yes you living in the season where the trumpet of Jubilee has already done sounded amen the trumpet of Jubilee has already done sounded listen it's time for you to lay down the slave bells that you've been receiving it's time for you to tell your slave master listen I have had a trumpet of Jubilee oh you had a trumpet of Jubilee do you know what the in the Jubilee season you know when last season if you w't able if you haven't stroken and you had a debt that you couldn't pay amen you know they will come over and they'll take your children you with me they'll take your children because you couldn't pay them and you had no way to pay him but listen at at the time that that trumpet of Jubilee sounded your children had to go free are you with me your children had to go free listen we are living in that season now we are living in the season of The Jubilee trumpet that areound with the message of the hour your children wherever they are they are in a season that they can go free they must go free why because he said he won't lose one listen you can look around oh glory be to God listen you can look around and you can see the time that the coming of the Lord is very Noy the second coming of the Lord is very anoy listen if I was you and me listen I I know people I have cousins that are in the world but you know what I am not worried I am praising the Lord because as I am seeing the time drawing I I am seeing the promise drawing even closer because as if is coming and he said he won't lose one then that means that as the time is drawing night they are about to come home are you with me they are about to come home because he said he won't lose them it doesn't matter what pet they are in he will bring them home oh glory be to God he will bring them home but these two powers are fided brother brandham said there is only two powers and there's only two kingdoms two powers and two kingdoms is that all the rest of of the little Minot tens are connected to either one of those Powers is that in those Powers is God's power and Satan's power and it said that's what every war every disorder everything that comes along it's either controlled by God's power or Satan's power he said because that's the only two Powers there is and that is the power of life and the power of De he said now that's the only two Powers he say Satan can only he said he's he his power he's God he said he's God is is a perverted power of God that's Satan's power he that Satan is God a perverted power of God he said it isn't no real power is that it's a it's a it's a per it's a perversion of God's power power is that everything that Satan has that is only perverted life is that aoy is only the truth mow is that see adultery act misused a righteous act misused it says see everything that Satan's God is something that was perverted but it's a power and I want you to notice that is that everything that Satan's got is something perverted but it's a power listen the thought that Satan sends into your mind is God power to bring you doubt and to bring you down even though it's a perverted power it's still God power amen but Brown said it's a perverted power but it's still God power he said and we are today sitting here and one of the other power is going to control us it say so let us cast out the evil one it said let's take our position like the stars of the heavens is that as we sitting here one of these two powers are going to control you is that we're sitting in the church listen go back in the Book of Job in the Book of Job they got it the sons of God gathered and who showed up Satan showed up Satan showed up right where the children of God we gaed listen while you're sitting here there are two forces there's an enemy that is telling you I have had up before there's an enemy that is telling you listen it's just another service there is an enemy that is telling you Hey listen you you've been in services like this before you've had all of this before and you've seen no result and today is just going to be just as the same as it has always been now you've got a you've got a choice to make you can either listen to him and take his ideas and take his thoughts or you can say listen Satan you get behind me because this day is a different day because this day are am moving up into another dimension are you moving up into another Realm of the Supernatural are you with me are you with me there are two powers in here there are two that are trying to gain the preeminence right now as the word is being preached amen one is stry to pull you away and tell you listen you you're going to get no tonight to the service but there is another Power here that is saying I'm ready I am ready to prove my word to you if you can only believe it are you with me I am ready to prove my word to you if you can only believe it amen brother brandham said it's time for us to take our position amen like the stars of Heaven I believe it's time for the bride to take her position as sons of God and Daughters of God Amen listen the stars of Heaven since they were put there they've stayed there are you with me they are doing exactly what they were told to do from do from the foundation of the world they just doing the what they they were told to do they there to doing the AAR amen because God put them there amen listen you can look at the Moon you see the moon when the moon was created the moon was said you know you're going to give light in the absence of the sun amen and the moon the Lord told the moon list the moon you you are going to be the one that is going to control the toy amen you're going to be the one that will control the toy of the waters amen when the water is coming coming too much Moon you can rise up and tell the water you go back you've come too far are you with me that was the authority that God Gave To The Moon And since God gave the Moon that Authority the Moon is constantly doing that he will never allow the water to rise above where is supposed to come now I want you to come to realization of something that brother Brandon said that the church is a type of the Moon amen that is Shinning the Lord in the darkness of our in the absence of the s o n are you with me this this morning the church is the type of the moon so if the moon in the natural was given the authority to push back the toy are you with me this morning if the moon was given the authority to push back the toy whenever the Toy Rose up and you are the moon today then you also have the same Authority are you with me this morning you also have the same authority to push back any toy that the enemy will try to bring against your home to push back any toy that the enemy will try to bring against your your life to bring against your family you have a right to push back that toy amen because you are the representation in the spiritual of the Moon in this day amen we're going to have to come in harmony because the mo is in harmony with God and the only way we're going to push back the toy is for us to come back in harmony with God Amen to come back in harmony with God now listen to this quote brother brandham says in the greatest battle ever fought he said and I W to God this morning that we will bring this to a real healing service now you say it's almost well they told me take so he blame the go standing back there but it said and I W to God this morning that we would bring the service to a real healing service is that that we could keep this part this part of the group that we are gaed under the roof this morning in such a Harmony that the holy spirit will place every member of the body that's here this morning in in such Harmony till there will be such a spontaneous healing of soul and body and I said if we'll just hold our possession listen I believe that that quote is not just the quot but I believe that that was the desire of God and I believe that that desire hasn't changed that if this church this morning this group that is gathered here this morning if we can come into that Harmony such Harmony amen such Harmony that that would be a spontaneous not someone working it up not someone forcings into us but a spontaneous a spontaneous healing of body and soul amen if we will hold our position and what is our position as Sons and Daughters of God knowing who we are to know that the authority has been given to us listen God is ready to back up your word he's ready to do it Amen brother Bram said we have to believe and he will perform it amen we have to believe and he will perform it now we believe that we're living in an age where we've been predestinated to come to that Harmony Amen to come to that Unity to that Oneness with God where there can be a spontaneous healing of body and soul amen and not only body and soul but there can be a spontaneous healing of scars a spontaneous healing of the broken homes a spontaneous healing of the broken heart a spontaneous healing amen of any Brokenness in our life amen I believe that there is where God is wanting to move Amen to bring a spontaneous healing listen there came a day amen that God told his disciples he said to us disciples going up to the open room amen going up to the open room and is that when you go up in there I am going to mess with you in there amen listen when they got into that that open room from what the scripture says in those 10 days they had not come into harmony are you with me in those 10 days they hadn't come into harmony but in those 10 days they were figuring 10 days in those 10 days I don't know because listen up there were Pharisees up there were Sadducees up there were were the disciples all kind of peoples were in there can you imagine Peter sitting in there with all these Pharisees you think they're just going to get along in the next five minutes they sure won't but there were some Pharisees that believed that Jesus was the Christ that Jesus was the Messiah there were 120 people got it up there amen so there were more than the 12 disciples amen they were GA it up there waiting for the promise but before the promise could come the scripture said that they they came into what into one Accord are you with me they came into one Accord amen they came to a place where they began to say to themselves listen folks why are we here listen we forced for these last KN days we've done nothing but forcing and fighting and arguing about this and the other but listen what is the reason why we are here are we here to force or are we here to receive the promise and I believe that the people the 120 people in there as they begin to hear right on don't know who was the spokesman but as they begin to hear one of these disciples or whoever was that stood up and said it's time to come into the reason why we are here it is time for us to come into Unity of Mind in receiving the the what we have been promised listen and I believe there is where the bride is to come to amen where we GA it together in a service listen we don't just come together to say well it's a Sunday morning and I ought to go to church amen or it's a Sunday morning and we ought to be here and but if we can come into that Accord into that Unity into that Harmony Amen to say you know what we've come here to receive the promise to say I've come into the service not to leave the same I've come into the the service to claim what God has promised to me amen listen that is how those people in the upper room there is where they had to come to to a place where the promise became a reality to a place where the promise became the most important thing nothing else mattered anymore amen nothing else mattered anymore it didn't matter what they were going to do tomorrow nothing else mattered all that mattered is that in this moment we are here to receive the promise amen we are here to receive the promise let me say this church if this PE if this group of people that we are gued here this morning if we can come into that that same Unity into that same one Accord brother Bram said there are two Powers right now that are trying to gain the preeminence there are two powers that are trying to get a hold of your mind one power that is trying to get you to doubt another power that is trying to get you to believe and if this morning we can come to a place where we get a hold of the power of God that is trying to get us to believe amen if we get a hold of that faith that God has Desiring to use to bring us to receive the promise listen we will see a spontaneous healing listen I believe the words of the message I believe the words of God listen and if the prophet said it I believe it wasn't just the prophet but I believe it was God that was speaking it amen and if he was speaking it and if he was saying that if we come into unity and one Accord that there can be a spontaneous healing I believe it can happen or you believe it can happen listen it is not impossible God is willing to do it God is willing to do it but we are the ones that needs to come into that Harmon we are the ones that needs to come into thy own accord and into thy Unity to say listen we are here to receive the promise no matter what you were going through no matter what the battle is no matter how the home is looking at looking like you can sit here this morning and say I am living here believing that something is going to change because listen when you come to the H of God you never going to live the same you're going to either live better than you can man or you're going to live worse than you care man and that is going to depend which spirit that is going to depend which anointing which that is going to depend which power you're going to allow you to control you this morning you with me morning listen I believe that God is ready to do it listen I don't know why God changed my service last night but I believe he's got a purpose for it are you with me this morning I believe he's got a purpose for it because this was absolutely not the direction we were going to go this morning but last night the Lord said no we changing that we're changing gears because he had you on his mind he had you on his mind and what he had to say to you this morning is that if you will come into thy Unity if you will come into thy one Accord if you allow to that power of God to get a hold of you he's ready to perform his word he's ready to perform the miraculous listen we were in a meeting bab three weeks ago we were in a meeting in in in Toronto we were taking a youth service amen and and it was I think it was the second service we were taken and and and and and there was a motor in the in the service amen there was a motor in the service and we were speaking along these lines amen of God being ready to perform his word of we that the same thought that if we were to come to a place where we receive the power of God and we we allow the power of God to control us that God is ready to perform his word and there was a motor that was sitting in the meeting amen now this m has had her daughter her daughter has been Wayward for 15 years for 15 years her daughter has been living in the world listen I saw her daughter later on we contining in the story but listen her daughter was cared her daughter had all sort of things on her body she had all sort of piercing in her body she had everything she could have for 15 years she was living outside of the world indeed God started to deal with her but she still didn't want to have anything to do with church but in that service as this same quote was being read as the spirit of God began to move in that service that woman begin to take God at his word she wasn't taking me at my word she was taking God at his word to say if God said then I want to step in it I want to step in it and I want to declare my claim and in that service that woman made a claim and said God I want my daughter back you said God I want my daughter back listen we ended that service she sat in a car driven home and she began to praise the Lord with tears flowing down her eyes saying my daughter is is coming home say my daughter is coming home she didn't know how she didn't know when when she begin to claim it you know what happened the next morning Sunday morning her phone begin to ring she picks up her phone it is her daughter calling on the other line saying mama I am ready to come back to church listen church God is more than ready to perform his word there are two power here this morning that destroying to get a hold of you to perform the promise that is given to you brother brother says cast out the evil one cast out the D cast out the fear and allow God allow God to perform his word he has laid it on my heart for this morning because he's ready to prove his word to you he's ready to perform the miraculous he's ready to form the impossible if only you can believe if only we can come into that Harmony if only we can come into that Unity listen if he can do it for that woman he can do it for you no matter what the circumstance no matter what the situation he is more than able to do it again and he will do it again and again and again why because he is God and he's the same yesterday today and forever he hasn't changed he hasn't changed brother pram continuing to say if this church right now could be put together and knitted together with such that every person would be in one Accord with not one Shadow of Doubt anywhere are you with me this morning if we can come to a place in one Accord with not one shadow of death anywhere brother Bram says there would be there would not be a feeble person in our m in another five minutes listen we can read that quote and we can say well maybe one day maybe one day maybe one day one day it will happen but what about right now what about right now what about this service what about this moment is there anything too hard for the Lord is there anything too hard for the Lord what about this hour what about this moment we've always put it off we've always put it off but what to be now he said there wouldn't be one Fe person in the next 4 minutes is that if there there would be nobody here Desiring the Holy Ghost but what would receive it if you could just get the if you just if you could just get that certain T fixed and B began to talk about it is that now there is where the battle begins right in your mind point there is where the battle begins amen there is where the battle begins the Battle of trying to break the unity the Battle of doubt the Battle of fear well listen always believe that God is more than able this morning God is more than able this morning amen God is more than able this morning brother brandom continuing to say here he said you can have little consciences and little feelings and little sensation all these things that has nothing to do with it listen you can be sitting here having some Sensations some feelings and thinking but what about that and what about this and can this really be could it really be this morning moment but brandham says that has nothing to do with it he said that's just little Sensations and tense is said but when it comes to reality is that your mind opens it up is that your mind either accepts it or rejects it he said that's it friends is said God let none he said God let none of them mes it's your mind that opens up the door or closes the door and listens to your consent listens to your memory listens to your affection he said but when your mind closes itself to these things and what are these things the little feelings and the doubt and the fears is that when your mind closes itself to these things and let God the spirit of his word come in is that it blows the rest of the stove out he said every doubt is gone he said every fear is gone is that every sensation of Doubt is gone is that every feeling is gone is that there is nothing standing there but the word of God and it say Satan cannot battle against that when you push everything eight when your mind rejects everything every day rejects every fear and puts the word there to say I am believ in the word of God he says Satan cannot battle that Satan cannot battle that listen Church God's confidence is not in your fresh God's confidence is not in your sensation God's confidence is not in your feelings God's confidence is in the seed that is put on the inside of you that is what is coming to Rapture and that seed is going to get a new body amen that seed is going to get a new body so God's confidence is not in your body God's confidence is not in the mistakes that you're going to make but God's confidence is in the seed that is on the inside of you he's got confidence that that seed has the power to produce what the word says that's where his confidence is at but many times we put our confidence in our flesh we put our confidence in our feelings and and our doubts and and the wrong things we made and the wrong things we did that's where our confidence always go to but there's not where God's confidence is at his confidence is in the seed amen his confidence is in the seed and see the reason why Satan is trying to get into our mind is because Satan wants us to look at the circumstance Satan wants us to look at the situation you know that's what gazi that's what gazi began to look at how many you know the story of it amen gassi he began to look at the circumstance listen they woke up one morning are you with me this morning they woke up one morning Gaz and eloa have been tented away and they've been tting away and you know Gaz is the servant of ela amen and they've been tting away and and you know of of course the Assyrians in those days were against the prophet and they didn't like the prophet amen and so they've been hearing some stories going B you know this Prophet you know you know being able to discern things and different things going on and so the Assyrians came to a place where they said you know what it's time to go and take this prophet and destroy him and so all the Assyrians came around and they gathered themselves around the tent of eloa and gazi are you with me this morning and you know the morning came the day broke and Gaz went per just stretching himself out just just getting himself ready for the day Oh What a Beautiful Morning the sun has raisen open you know Gaz just like you Rose up this morning you woke up this morning man you guys have got a beautiful scene you may have look out of your window wow that's such a beautiful day and a good day to go to church a good day to be in the presence of the Lord I can't wait to be in the house of the Lord and you know just ready to come to church and just ask Gaz he is looking around he just happens to look up on the mountain and when Gaz looked on the mountain he got a shock he looked on the mountain and he saw the mountain full of Assyrians amen he saw the mountain full of Assyrians Assyrians that had come to take them Assyrians that had come to battle against them amen are you with me this morning listen you might have wake up this morning feeling great to come to the service but you sitting here this morning and listen there are Assyrians that are trying to to take the f that God is trying to bring to you amen there are Assyrians that are gathered around you this morning that are trying to block the word of faith the destroying to come to you amen and you see Gaz he was looking at the Assyrians listen when he saw those Assyrian he got scared Fear Rose upon his head and he run into the tent and said Elo Elo you can't believe what I saw this morning this place is is surrounded we are in trouble eloa there's no way we coming out of this we are surrounded by the Assyrians but you know what Elijah said to him is that all G gassi gassi when are you going to learn when are you going to learn gassi listen Church many time God is looking at and say bride of Christ when are you going to rise up when are you going to come to the place where you realize now listen it's not about what is surrounding you this morning it's not about the circumstance it's not about the situation it's not about the darkness that you looking at are you with me this morning he said to him listen gazi there is not a trouble here because there is more wi us than there is with them amen gazim you are looking in the natural amen you are looking in the natural but listen we are not looking in the natural anymore listen gazi was under a man anointing amen he was under a man anointing he was looking at it in the natural but there was a prophet in the land that was under an eagle anointing amen he was under an legal anointing and he was looking at the same thing that gazi was looking at but when he looked at it he didn't see it only an army but he saw the angels are you with me this morning he saw the angels that were around the Assyrians that were ready to F the battle for them listen let me say this to your church this morning look past your circumstance look past the situation amen it may feel like you are surrounded it may feel like the that the odds are against you but let me say this this morning there is more there is more with you than there is with the Enemy that has been troubling you in your home there is more with you than there is with the Enemy that has taken your child that has taken your husband or taken your wife there is more with you are you with me this morning there is more with you listen the scripture say say that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world there is a greater force that is on the inside of you we are under the eagle anointing amen we don't see the trouble but we see the solution that's what that's what Elijah saw he wasn't looking at of trouble he wasn't looking at the Assan he looked at the Assyrians but he saw the Angels listen this morning no matter what it is if you look you will see more than just the trouble but you will see that there's a greater one that is on the inside of you that there is in the world Amen listen the scripture Will Tell Us in Romans amen the scripture Will Tell Us in Romans in Romans 8:31 told1 it says what shall we say to these things what shall we say to all the trouble what shall we say to all the circumstance around us what shall we say to the trouble in the home and the battles that we're facing Paul tell us if God be for us if God be for us who can be against this I'm here to tell you this morning God is for you God is for you no matter what is Surin in you he said if God be for us who can be against us amen listen I believe that was what Elijah was trying to tell gasi to say listen gasi God is for us these Assyrians that against us they have no power to overcome us Psalm chapter 27 verse 1 to3 will say is said the Lord is my Lo to my salvation he said Whom Shall I Fear is said the Lord is the strength of my life is said of whom shall I be afraid he said when the wicked and even my enemies and morning FS came up Came Upon me to eat of morning flesh he said they stumbled and fell is that though and H should encamp against me is that my house shall not fear the wall should Rise Against Me in this will I be confident and what are we confident in the word the God will perform it it doesn't matter what is surrounding you this morning George God is ready to perform his word God is ready to perform his word God is ready to perform his word listen David came to his Camp David came to his camp and I'm going to start winding down but David came to his camp and he came to the camp when he came to the camp I wanted to realize that this Camp was the place where David had trust in David was confident that in this Camp there was safety amen he knew that in this Camp you know there is a place where I can leave my wife there's a place where I can leave my children and I can go to the battle and I can come back and I find them here are you with me David had confidence in the camp he knew that in this Camp there is safety listen we have confidence in this message amen we have confidence in this message we raised our children in the message because we have confidence that in here God is going to keep them in this year in here they're going to make a rapture we had confidence that's what David had he had confidence in the place where he had brought his army and his people but right in the place where David had his confidence was right there the enemy came and attacked are you with me this morning listen it was right here where you raised up your children now we don't know if there was any way what but was raise here the you sat and believe in this message but it is right here that the enemy is coming and trying to rob you in your mind it is right here that the enemy is coming and try to take your children out it is right here that the enemy is coming are you with me the place where David had confidence the place where we have confidence was right there right there and he came back and when he came back they were all taken away but I want to notice something in the scripture the scripture said that he took them away but none of them it says here and he had taken the women captives that were there in but listen to this he said they SLE not any the enemy couldn't killed them the enemy couldn't destroy them listen the enemy might have come might Tak your children but he can't destroy them are you with me this morning the enemy might have come build walls in your mind but he can't destroy you he took them but he couldn't destroy them listen he came and he told he you know job you know the story of Job God said go ahead go on ahead go on ahead and afflict job but he said job he he told the devil you you can't touch his life is that you have no right to touch his life amen you can do whatever you want to deal with him but you can't touch his life let me say to you this morning the enemy is limited the enemy is limited the enemy is on a leech amen he can go so far but no more are you with me this morning he can go so far and no more he is limited but there is a group of people here this morning that have no limit limitation amen you are the group of person that have no limitation you have no limitation of what you can take in the word and and and claim what God has promised you you have no limitation in what you can believe you have no limitation of the impossibility of what God can do you have no limitation but Satan has a limitation amen has a limitation he can come and draw your children or do whatever he wants but he can't say play them right in that camp he came and he took them and he moved them away amen he came and took them and he burned the camp with fire he destroyed the camp you know sometimes that's what he try to do destroy your confidence destroy your confidence bur it all down to where you say it's almost impossible it's impossible this situation cannot turn around it looks impossible but remember the scripture said that With God all things are possible and the scripture also says that with you all things are possible you with me this morning with you all things are possible why because the same God that said that nothing shall be impossible unto you is the same God that is in you amen so if T are impossible with God then T are impossible with you too and they came and the born down and it looked it looked hopeless it looked like there was no way that they were coming eight of it listen to may look hopeless this morning it may look hopeless this morning amen but it was right there when the people begin to weep and the people begin to cry and the people begin to say oh oh David oh David don't we guess that that way sometimes that we begin to weep say God I didn't sign up for this I didn't sign up for this I wasn't expecting this when I believed I wasn't expecting this to come in my home I wasn't expecting this and say oh God oh God what is going on why me Lord why me why me among God why is it that I am under this attack that was the attitude of the people that was saying what's going on David what's going on you brought us here we had confidence in you we've been here fighting for you we've been here risking Our Lives we've been here doing everything and now you brought us to this camp and now look at what has happened look at what has happened David our wives are gone our children are gone everything is gone but you know what David did David began to silence the voices David began to silence the voices listen it's time for us to silence the voices he begin to silence the voices and you know what it did he begin to walk away from the presence of those people and he begin to get himself in another atmosphere amen are you with me he begin to get himself in another atmosphere in an atmosphere where he begin to call the priest to come in amen it begin to say call abat call the priest to come in and as he's coming in tell him to bring the word tell him to bring the effort amen he begin to say the atmosphere here is just an atmosphere of discouragement it's just an atmosphere of War it's just an atmosphere of of just destroying of a common down of of a Brokenness but it said I want to walk out of this I want to get into the presence I want to get into a place where faith can begin to build I want to get into a place where I can hear God speaking to me are you with me this morning listen and right now as you're sitting here there are two voices as we said this morning there is a voice of war that is speaking to you saying why me why the circumstance why am I in this but there's another place that you can go this morning are you with me this morning there is another place where you can go there there is another presence there is another anointing there is another atmosphere amen there is another atmosphere that destroy and you say come on in here come in here amen you look in the Book of Solomon and you say Come Away my bride Come Away amen come away come to a secret place come into a secret chamber amen come into a place where I can talk to you let's go into the holiest of holies let's go into the place where the a coin of Glory yes let's go into the place where where the man never runs out it said let's get into that atmosphere let's get into that atmosphere there is where David said we have to get to and when David got there he said give me the effort he said give me the word give me the word give me the word because I want to inquire of the Lord concerning my situation I want to inquire of the Lord concerning my circumstance listen I don't know what you are going through this morning I don't know what it looks like this morning but listen you can get into a channel this morning you can get to a place where you get into Unity you get into that one Accord you get into that one Accord with the word of God with what is being spoken this morning with the anointing that is Flowing this morning with the presence of God that is Flowing this morning you can get into that channel and when David God into that channel and he begin to read that scripture it begin to read and the atmosphere begin to change amen the atmosphere begin to change listen brother brandom said you have the power to create a world and go live on it but listen right now we don't need a world to go live on because we know that we're going to a world Amen a place where there is peace the place where there is everything that we have need of but right now what we need to create it an atmosphere it has it's an at atmosphere for the possible the impossible to become possible that's what we need right now listen if we can create a world to go live on we can create an atmosphere this morning and you know how you begin to create an atmosphere you begin to create it by taking the word and putting it on your mind listen that's what brother brandham did when he was sitting under that tree what did he do he took Mark 11 and he said I'm going to meditate upon the scripture and he said as we begin to meditate upon that scripture you know what he said it begin to happen he said presence of the Lord draw an ey and he said I had a voice speaking to me amen he said I had a voice speaking to me and he said you know he was contemplating about this whether it's in the atonement or it's not in the atonement and a voice started to say to him you know who do you think it is on the platform that sees all the vision who you think do you think it is that does all these things that is happening in your ministry and he begins to reason with him and and begin to reason with him about the word and it began to come to a place that he begin to see him he begin to see him he begin to see that yes that is right this scripture is talking about me he said this scripture I am the one that can speak this scripture is true and now as he begin to meditate listen God doesn't just come to speak his word to you and you receive it and he said good you got it fantastic I am going that's not God but when God begin to speak to you and you begin to receive it and you say this is the truth then God says okay now I'm going to perform it to you that's what he did with the prophet when he received it and he said yes so believeth this is the truth then the voice said to him what do you need the voice said to him are you know hunting you need squirrels right and you believe that the scripture is true you believe that you can say to the mountain and the mountain can move if you can't if you don't date it and I said You' believed brother Brandon now put it into action go ahead and put it into action or I'm here to perform it amen amen Ander brandham spoke and we know what happened the squirrel appeared and he shot them and he said I at them it was real he said there was no squirrels there he knew there weren't any there weren't any but it said the God Amen the god that is a Creator is more than able to create squirrels where there's no squirrels amen and that's the same thing that is happening here this morning if you can receive the word God is ready to perform it amen because when when when David got into that atmosphere when he got into that atmosphere and he begin to read and and begin to to to to believe or whatever portion of the scripture that he was reading and he came to a place and he said okay Lord I've got a question for you this armmy has come it's taking no children it's taking no Wes so I pursue after them so I pursue after them shall I overtake them he got into presence begin to commune with the Lord and the Lord answered back to him but I want you to know there something very interesting over here David asked two questions David asked two questions David asked the Lord so I pursue and shall overtake them and the Lord responded back and gave him three answers and he told him pursue and you'll surely overtake them he answered the two questions of David but he said this is not the end of it with day fell recover all with day fell recover all with d fell recover all listen church this morning that is what he's speaking to you you've pursued you've been pursuing you've been pursuing for your children you've been pursuing for whatever you going through you've been praying you've been believing and while you're doing that you're overtaking the DAT you've been overtaking the DAT in this maing you've been overtaking the fear you've been overtaking it as you listening to the word faith has been building you've been hearing of the wondrous works of God you've been hearing that God is more than able to do the impossible you've been hearing that God is more than able to answer your prayers and then God is saying if you've believed it just like he said to the prophet if you've believed it the name with they fell with they fell go and recover all now listen church he didn't say maybe you're going to recover all he didn't say maybe you will get some kids back maybe you're going to get some wives back he didn't say maybe but he said with date fell in other words he's saying listen this is a total Victory he said David as you were going to face your enemy as you are going out of this place as you walking out of this meeting as you walking out of this service the Lord is saying to you without fail without fail you are going to recover all that the enemy has taken away from you listen church I believe it is time Amen to begin to make our way to the enemy camp it believe it's time to begin to go byy fate to claim and take back what the enemy has robbed from us listen brother brandom said you

yours the Holy Ghost is yours are you with me this morning that's what the Abra deed says every 10 every Redemptive promise in the word of God is yours that's what the title deed says no matter what the enemy have taken brother brandham said do you know what he said that the Holy Ghost is an agent amen he said the Holy Ghost is an agent he said when you go into the law and and do all those things he said you've got an agent and he said that agent he knows the law amen when you've got a case you get a lawyer and that lawyer he knows the law and he goes into the courtroom and he's the one that stands for you amen he's the one that stands for you and he takes the law and and he begins to use the law to claim your rights Amen brother brandham says that that lawyer is the Holy Ghost is that that Holy Ghost it knows the word of God because it is the word of God and it said that Holy Ghost if you have received you say this morning I don't know if I have the Holy Ghost listen the Holy Ghost is here to fill you and you with me this morning listen it was in the house of Cornelius as the word of God was being preached it said every one of them was filled with the power of the Holy Ghost

next day maybe they were going to be executed but listen they they were sitting in the prison if there were a group of people that needed to be sad it was Paul and Silas if there was a group of people that needed to be crying and being be woing and and doing all sort of things it was Paul and soilers listen those was a group of people that had believed the message of their day are you with me this morning they believed the message of the day but they could have acted like the man of David who would have sat there and cry and cry and cry and cry amen they could have acted that way Paul and silus but you know what Paul and soas said we're not going to act that way but you know what we're going to do we're going to begin to praise the Lord is that we're going to begin to praise the Lord even though we abandon change it doesn't matter our God is still god listen if we live we will still serve him if we die we are going to go up to a to go up in glory we are not losing here let me say this church you can't lose no matter what happens are you with me this morning now the attitude the PA and soilers out is said no matter what happens it doesn't matter there's no point of us sitting here and crying and weeping let me go ahead and praise the Lord and they went ahead and began to praise the Lord and Worship the Lord and listen in the midst of their Worship in the midst of their worship their chains begin to belose amen the chains begin to lose listen only two people only two people people got into Unity only two people got into one Accord and when two people got into one Accord they not only the chains were loose but the chains of everyone that was bound was loosed listen to me Church you may be the only one that feel like you're getting under the anointing or under the the inspiration but listen you begin to praise him you begin to rejoice in your house you begin to push away the de and the fear and you begin to say praise the Lord you begin to say Thank You Lord you say even though I don't feel it you don't have to feel it you begin to confess him you just believe to begin to confess it and believe that that's what the the Lord said that's what the word says amen that's what they did they begin to praise the Lord and their chains were lose and their chains were broken and everyone could go free everyone could could go free so we got talking about Paul and soers talking about Paul and soilers but you know what happened once they went free there was a there was a man in there the guard when he saw that all the chains were loose and the prison doors were open he took a sword and he was ready to kill himself amen he was ready to kill himself and as we got to speak and and got to that point I don't know but the presence of the Lord came down and the presence of the Lord says stay there just stay there and we begin to say listen do thyself no harm do thyself no harm because we are all here amen listen do you know what they werey to do they werey to Stone David amen they werey to Stone David they werey to kill David that's what the scripture said the re to killed David amen and as I was speaking on these and saying do thyself no harm do

life because the enemy had got an into her mind and I told her you are the reason why your family is not happy you are the reason why your parents are not happy so you know the best thing for you to do is kill yourself and your parents will be happy as a lawy of the enemy listen when you start to entertain you start to entertain that that Loy of the enemy because he start to let that mature and
