[39:42] [Music]
[39:55] hey Matt praise the Lord
[39:58] oh we walk her brother Matthew I thought
[40:01] he was working man grace he had to give
[40:05] him a break I was thinking I said Lord I
[40:09] said if he doesn't stop working sister
[40:11] and brother go and help him so the grace
[40:15] of God so we pray grant God's grace to
[40:18] us in this service a man and also to
[40:22] just remind us concerning something
[40:28] that's going on in the world something
[40:31] that the prophet of God put a lot of
[40:34] emphasis on and it's it's taking place
[40:37] now and of course one of the things was
[40:41] something that brother Alec sent me an
[40:46] article on and it's on the internet
[40:49] somewhere and has to do with
[40:53] intimidating Christians and tried to
[40:58] prevent Christians from moving forward
[41:00] they met is make no mistake it says
[41:04] though the world is trying to intimidate
[41:07] and marginalize Christians they met and
[41:10] some nations use overt persecution to
[41:13] browbeat believers and that's the truth
[41:17] the more we stand for the gospel the
[41:19] greater the opposition a man they just
[41:23] want Christianity to be just like any
[41:25] other religion a man and again they put
[41:29] the emphasis on in America now that
[41:31] you're not allowed to go out and
[41:32] publicly witness to this one publicly
[41:34] witness to that one regarding your
[41:37] Christian walk and your Christian talk
[41:39] and so on that's the truth and I did as
[41:42] I said I did get in contact with the
[41:45] American Civil Rights and so on and I
[41:48] told him I said that I said that's not
[41:50] right
[41:50] you shouldn't you shouldn't bring that
[41:53] law and you shouldn't enforce that law
[41:55] I says preventing Christians from
[41:57] witnessing I said we can't even obey the
[42:00] first commandment that Jesus gave us
[42:03] to go forth and be witnesses to this one
[42:05] witness to that one and so on and I said
[42:08] I said you want to allow one let one let
[42:10] us do it so and they said well pastor
[42:15] that's the law and we do have clergy on
[42:19] our board and they're enforcing it I
[42:23] said well I said Jesus I wanted a Hmong
[42:26] the disciples I said he was called Judas
[42:28] so I guess you got the newest Judas
[42:31] Tyrians on your board and so they never
[42:34] come back they wouldn't they wouldn't
[42:36] come in a man but it is to Judas tereus
[42:40] a man that's betraying the Christian
[42:43] life the Christian testimony and witness
[42:45] in these days this is her brother citrus
[42:49] is getting more serious please I pray
[42:52] God by grace as we get into the message
[42:55] on again on what our brother LaFontaine
[42:58] was ministering on concerning true or
[43:00] false expectations what are you
[43:02] expecting a man when a cop we were
[43:05] expecting this expecting that yes but
[43:08] there's something else that God wants us
[43:10] to expect a man that goes beyond what
[43:14] they're doing what about what God is
[43:16] doing amen sir are we expecting the
[43:19] promise of God so I pray the grace of
[43:21] God be with us when we get in to some
[43:24] more thoughts and that's just not my
[43:26] thoughts but the thoughts of the Prophet
[43:28] and what he has highlighted concerning
[43:30] expectation a man and what we should be
[43:33] expecting always should be expecting and
[43:36] he said there's no expectation is you're
[43:38] not going to get anything he said be if
[43:41] you want it you got to expect it they
[43:43] met so the grace of God that in the
[43:46] light of what's going on in the world
[43:47] and the pressure that's coming down on
[43:49] Christianity brothers sisters that were
[43:51] good we're going to hunger and thirst
[43:53] more and more for what God has given us
[43:56] to expect in this hour and in this age a
[43:59] man and also there's another issue
[44:03] regarding whether the problem of God did
[44:06] say is coming to a place with
[44:08] Christianity he said you won't be
[44:10] allowed to pray for the sick he said if
[44:13] you're if they catch you pray for the
[44:14] sick he said they'll shoot you
[44:16] yeah so I believe that because the world
[44:20] we're living in
[44:21] as I said it's not the world we lived in
[44:23] a few years ago or a year ago we're
[44:25] living in an insane world that's the
[44:28] truth so brother there's things happen
[44:30] people do things that you knew wouldn't
[44:32] be dreamed up years ago
[44:34] but now the world is insane so you can
[44:37] expect anything to happen so the grace
[44:40] of God be with us in our expectation
[44:43] that it'll be a holy ghost expectation
[44:46] and also this past a few days there have
[44:51] been a number of earthquakes in
[44:54] California a man and the earlier this
[45:00] week when it happened in California and
[45:02] I believe it was something like 6.4
[45:05] magnitude and and it not only affected
[45:08] California but also affected British
[45:10] Columbia and they were experiencing
[45:13] things in British Columbia that was the
[45:14] result of the earthquake in California
[45:17] they may and again on Friday there was
[45:21] another earthquake in California this
[45:23] time not 6 point something but it was
[45:25] seven point one a man was the magnitude
[45:29] and where was it in California amazing
[45:32] it was near death valley park you know
[45:38] brother it's coming and months after but
[45:47] rather rather months after this
[45:48] earthquake aftershocks could follow the
[45:51] California's magnitude of 7.1 amen so
[45:55] it's going to get worse until we know as
[45:57] the power of God said that California is
[45:59] going under that's right
[46:02] and he said he said he's going to be so
[46:04] salt so many hundred miles this into
[46:06] into inland and he said it'll go he said
[46:09] fifteen hundred miles I and so on so
[46:12] it's going it's going to include British
[46:13] Columbia as well so we pray the grace of
[46:16] God because now these things are just
[46:18] signs for us to look up they may not to
[46:23] continue with this life without without
[46:25] putting the focus on the spiritual part
[46:28] of the emphasis on spirit
[46:30] but in the emphases on what God has
[46:31] promised in this hour by the grace of
[46:33] God so he said the prophet of God did
[46:36] say California is going under and he
[46:38] said he saw he said he said there's 400
[46:40] water went 400 miles the it comes to
[46:43] California and 1,500 miles and he said
[46:46] it's going to go right around he said
[46:49] the world and he said it's going to come
[46:51] up even in the Atlantic and he said it's
[46:53] going to go 400 miles inland he said
[46:56] even to Kentucky amazing yeah I believe
[47:00] it so brother grace of God to us that
[47:04] we're going to not be forwarding
[47:07] ourselves when it comes to expecting
[47:09] this expecting that but yes those things
[47:12] are coming but what does God want us to
[47:14] expect more than that what does God want
[47:17] us to focus on more than that it is the
[47:20] resurrection and the rapture and if
[47:23] you're not expecting it you're not going
[47:24] to experience it that's right
[47:26] probably God says you've got to expect
[47:28] it if you want to be a part of it you've
[47:31] got to be expecting it amen and and if
[47:34] you're expecting it then you're going to
[47:36] be on your guard you're gonna be
[47:37] watching you're gonna be by the grace of
[47:41] God lining up with this making sure
[47:42] everything is in line with the Word of
[47:44] God amen to get into the resurrection
[47:47] and the rapture amen so I pray grace
[47:51] that we're not here for that for that
[47:54] great earthquake
[47:55] I pray grace brother if that goes down I
[47:57] pray grace God's gonna take us off amen
[48:01] and also greetings from our brother
[48:06] George Smith presently our brother is in
[48:09] Africa and I'm just waiting to hear back
[48:13] from him to see how long that he will be
[48:15] in Africa and of course he's been there
[48:18] a number of times so we pray god bless
[48:21] his ministry there as he ministers to
[48:23] the Saints in Africa and mine my
[48:26] encouragement is to head that the Lord
[48:28] will help our brother George to get the
[48:30] Africans to look up they met because oh
[48:35] when it comes to endtime evangelism what
[48:38] is the focusing on he's focusing on the
[48:40] bride get her ready for the rapture a
[48:42] man that's the endtime evangelism for
[48:45] the bride when it comes to the rest of
[48:47] the world as I've told it recently the
[48:49] prophet of God said we won't reach
[48:51] everyone with this message
[48:53] no just the bride the message is for the
[48:56] bride to give the bride rapturing faith
[48:59] to get out of here amen
[49:01] so that that's what the message is for
[49:03] when it comes to evangelism you can take
[49:07] that out to other parts of the world but
[49:09] it's testifying of Jesus testifying of
[49:11] the Lord Jesus Christ trying to get
[49:13] people to acknowledge Christ and so on
[49:15] by the grace of God but not the message
[49:18] that's only for the right amen so many
[49:21] are called few are chosen
[49:23] by the grace of God amen the Lord bless
[49:27] you this day in this thing only believe
[49:29] all things are possible only believe as
[49:31] we go to the word

[57:44] [Music]
[58:33] a man praise the Lord turn with me to
[58:36] the Book of Psalms chapter 62 Psalms 62
[58:44] a man and beginning to read that verse 1
[58:57] and again I want to continue with some
[59:00] thoughts on the true or the false
[59:03] expectation we want to make sure that we
[59:07] have a true expectation that it is based
[59:10] on the word it is absolutely proven by
[59:14] the Scriptures Amen remembering again
[59:18] that what God has done and what God is
[59:21] doing what God will do is all in the
[59:23] word and again man shall not live by
[59:26] bread alone but by every word that
[59:28] proceeds out of the mouth of God so I
[59:31] pray the grace of God that we're going
[59:33] to be in the word that we're going to be
[59:35] studying the word we're going to be
[59:38] watching the word and brother whatever
[59:40] we're seen out there in the world we
[59:41] want to bring it back to the scriptures
[59:43] and say it is written or it is us saith
[59:46] the Lord that this was going to happen
[59:48] or that's going to happen a man and all
[59:51] of it is plane to the resurrection and
[59:53] the rapture so that when we see these
[59:55] things out there then we got to do what
[59:57] the Bible tells us to do and that is to
[1:00:00] look up a man and the only way that we
[1:00:03] can look up is that we got to have an
[1:00:05] expectation to look up what are we
[1:00:07] expecting a man what are we looking for
[1:00:09] that when we see these things cover the
[1:00:12] pass in California when we see these
[1:00:14] things come to pass in other other
[1:00:16] countries concerning anti-christian
[1:00:19] teachings and so on brothers sisters
[1:00:21] whatever we got to do the Bible says
[1:00:23] look up when you see these things for
[1:00:25] the day of your redemption is drawing
[1:00:27] near
[1:00:27] amen it is the resurrection it is the
[1:00:31] rapture so what we got to be expecting
[1:00:33] is the change we're going to be
[1:00:35] expecting the resurrection we got to be
[1:00:37] expecting the rapture amen
[1:00:39] constantly a man on our hearts and in
[1:00:43] our hearts the revelation of what God
[1:00:46] is doing and in the Book of Psalms and
[1:00:50] in chapter 62 and verse 1 truly my soul
[1:00:54] waited upon God and from em cometh my
[1:00:59] salvation a man he only is my rock and
[1:01:03] my salvation he is my defense i shall
[1:01:08] not be greatly moved a man I trust that
[1:01:12] what's going on in the world is not
[1:01:14] going to move us or to change our faith
[1:01:16] or the weaken our faith it's going to
[1:01:18] increase our faith a man so he said how
[1:01:22] long will he imagine mischief against a
[1:01:25] man he shall be slain all of you as a
[1:01:29] bowing wall shall DB and as a doddering
[1:01:33] fence
[1:01:34] they only consult to cast him down from
[1:01:38] his Excellency and they delight in lies
[1:01:41] they bless with their mouth and they
[1:01:44] curse inwardly Selah but he said my soul
[1:01:51] waited only upon God a man our faith is
[1:01:56] in God our faith is in the Word of God a
[1:02:00] man and we're going as her brother just
[1:02:03] refrain from faith to faith a man and it
[1:02:07] says my expectation is from him a man
[1:02:13] through the word praise the Lord God
[1:02:17] always gives us the word to create in us
[1:02:20] the expectation of what he's going to do
[1:02:22] so I pray the grace of God that we got
[1:02:25] the revelation in this day and in this
[1:02:27] hour of the word and it as and it is
[1:02:31] creating in us the revelation of what
[1:02:33] God is doing and what God is going to do
[1:02:36] amen so we are expecting the
[1:02:39] resurrection we're expecting the rapture
[1:02:41] there is nothing else in the scripture
[1:02:43] for the Christian believer to look for
[1:02:46] any man for the Bride of Christ to look
[1:02:48] for is the resurrection and the rapture
[1:02:50] well some say I'm looking for this to
[1:02:53] happen for that to happen
[1:02:54] brother brother concerning the
[1:02:55] resurrection
[1:02:56] rapture everything that God promised to
[1:02:59] point to the resurrection God has done
[1:03:01] everything that God promised to give us
[1:03:03] the resurrection right through faith God
[1:03:06] has done a man he has vindicated it
[1:03:09] through the Ministry of the Prophet
[1:03:11] praise the name of the Lord and it was
[1:03:13] ordained they made in the opening of the
[1:03:15] word to give us resurrection at Rajshri
[1:03:17] faith amen
[1:03:19] that is the third pole that is the
[1:03:21] conclusion of what God began in the
[1:03:24] Ministry of Malachi for that is the
[1:03:26] conclusion of what God started in
[1:03:28] William branham's ministry in doing what
[1:03:31] he did a man and I want to share with
[1:03:34] you some of the thoughts that he
[1:03:35] expressed on expectation a man I was
[1:03:38] surprised at the number of times that he
[1:03:41] preached on it a man just in ten years
[1:03:44] he preached on it pointing to it and
[1:03:46] then he did it a man by the grace of
[1:03:49] Almighty God to a place is you got to
[1:03:52] expect you got to expect and then
[1:03:54] brother then you then don't praise the
[1:03:56] Lord to to to to fulfill it

[1:04:02] with the OB of the seven seals with the
[1:04:05] third pole of his ministry any man to
[1:04:07] give us wrap three faiths praise the
[1:04:10] Lord
[1:04:10] any man so brother to create in us the
[1:04:13] expectation for the rapture
[1:04:15] Amen so that we'll know what to expect
[1:04:18] we're not expecting this when I expected
[1:04:20] a we're expecting the resurrection of
[1:04:22] the rapture others maybe their word the
[1:04:24] world's looking for a Greg the Great
[1:04:26] Tribulation they're looking for this to
[1:04:28] happen the Antichrist and all these
[1:04:29] things
[1:04:30] brother listen God is not pointing us to
[1:04:32] the Antichrist God as funny as to the
[1:04:34] road through the word to Christ praise
[1:04:36] the Lord but so many are focusing on the
[1:04:39] Antichrist but not Christ if we focus on
[1:04:42] Christ we're going to get the revelation
[1:04:45] and the faith for the resurrection and
[1:04:47] the rapture your focus on the Antichrist
[1:04:49] you're just going to get faith for the
[1:04:51] root for the Great Tribulation amen
[1:04:53] but brother we're not going into the
[1:04:55] Great Tribulation we are the wise
[1:04:57] virgins that are going into hurry to the

[1:05:45] God is a refuge for us Selah
[1:05:49] god bless his words you may be seated
[1:05:52] amen
[1:05:53] turn with me to proverbs chapter 23
[1:06:01] proverbs 23 amen and the gain to read at
[1:06:15] verse 15
[1:06:25] let's go to verse 12 apply thine art on
[1:06:29] to instruction a man to get the problem
[1:06:35] expectation you've got to take the
[1:06:37] instructions of God
[1:06:39] apply the hard on to instruction and I
[1:06:42] nears to the words of knowledge withhold
[1:06:46] not correction from the child for if
[1:06:49] thou beatest him with the rod he shall
[1:06:51] not die thou shalt beat him with the rod
[1:06:55] and shall deliver his soul from hell
[1:06:57] a man train up a child in the way he
[1:07:00] should go according to the will of God
[1:07:03] my son if I heart be wise my heart shall
[1:07:08] rejoice even mine
[1:07:09] yay my reign shall rejoice when thy lips
[1:07:14] speak right things a man that our
[1:07:17] conversation be in the word and
[1:07:19] according to the word that our
[1:07:21] conversation be in the revelation and
[1:07:23] according to the revelation that God has
[1:07:25] given us in this hour encouraging one
[1:07:27] another
[1:07:27] concerning the the promise of God
[1:07:29] concerning the policy of God because
[1:07:32] only what God has done we're encouraging
[1:07:34] one another a man pointing to the
[1:07:36] resurrection of the rapture a man so not
[1:07:39] to discourage us to say we're in the end
[1:07:41] time and this is happening and this is
[1:07:43] happening a man yes it is when it comes
[1:07:47] to when it comes to the negative things
[1:07:49] there are many negative things happening
[1:07:50] but God has given to us the revelation
[1:07:53] of the positive a man to encourage us
[1:07:56] for the resurrection and the rapture but
[1:07:58] still many are focusing on the negative
[1:08:01] things but not the positive things and I
[1:08:04] believe this is where our brother Paula
[1:08:06] Fontaine was planning the emphasis to
[1:08:09] get us to focus on the true expectations
[1:08:11] or not the false expectations does get a
[1:08:13] focus on what God has given us in this
[1:08:16] hour and in this age to expect a man so
[1:08:20] brother is not is not what they're
[1:08:22] teaching out there is what God ordained
[1:08:24] for the bride in this hour and in this
[1:08:26] age so there is a true expectation and
[1:08:29] there is a false expectation that the
[1:08:31] enemy is putting the the the fall six of
[1:08:34] the
[1:08:35] emphasis on those expectations and he's
[1:08:38] going to try to interpret it or
[1:08:39] misinterpret it for you concerning the
[1:08:42] resurrection and rapture a man
[1:08:44] concerning the message of the our old
[1:08:47] brothers and sisters we got we got a
[1:08:50] focus on the message not the messenger
[1:08:52] as I preach the many years ago I
[1:08:55] preached on the thought concerning maybe
[1:08:57] somebody come into your home with a
[1:08:59] message and maybe that a according to
[1:09:02] the message if you do did what the
[1:09:03] message told you to do that you become a
[1:09:05] millionaire if you did what the message
[1:09:07] so need to do you're going to have a lot
[1:09:09] of friends and so on but if you focused
[1:09:12] on the messenger and not the message
[1:09:14] then you're you're not going to inherit
[1:09:16] what the message tells you to do any man
[1:09:19] so you've got to focus on the message
[1:09:21] because there was a time when people
[1:09:23] would come to the door knock on your
[1:09:25] door and you go ahead and answer the
[1:09:26] door and there's a message and they
[1:09:29] would take the message but they talk to
[1:09:30] the messenger no no to say thank you sir
[1:09:34] I gotta go read the message but there
[1:09:36] are those that I play in the ambulance
[1:09:38] on the messenger the message you're the
[1:09:40] messenger how you doing today sir and
[1:09:42] what about this and what about that who
[1:09:44] are you where you come from and so on
[1:09:46] would you leave and let me go back to
[1:09:47] work
[1:09:48] a man but you got to go to the message a
[1:09:51] man you got to get into the message you
[1:09:53] got to focus on the message because the
[1:09:55] message is for you
[1:09:56] amen and that's the significance of it
[1:09:59] that well the whoever sent the message
[1:10:02] sent a messenger with it to your door
[1:10:04] you know maybe they could they would do
[1:10:08] it this way or do it that way in a more
[1:10:10] simple way but they paid for the
[1:10:12] messenger to deliver to you such was the
[1:10:15] importance of it
[1:10:16] amen and such was the importance of the
[1:10:18] message today Amen that God send a
[1:10:22] messenger
[1:10:23] amen he wasn't just going to leave it to
[1:10:25] us to go on and do this to go on and do
[1:10:28] the head you know when it comes to the
[1:10:29] letter of the word when it comes to the
[1:10:31] the mechanics of the word no no no he
[1:10:35] was going to send somebody that would
[1:10:36] read that would expect offense to make
[1:10:39] dynamics of the word amen praise the
[1:10:43] name of the Lord so that we would really
[1:10:45] would
[1:10:46] nice oh this is God there's something to
[1:10:48] this there's there's something important
[1:10:50] here a man or God would just God would
[1:10:53] just give me the the mechanics of it no
[1:10:55] God has said the dynamics of it a man to
[1:10:59] show us what he is and what he's going
[1:11:02] to do and what he wants you to expect a
[1:11:04] man all my brother's sister when God's
[1:11:08] first said the prophet of God in the
[1:11:10] Czar and in this age and he had those
[1:11:12] two signs they were expecting eeling
[1:11:15] they were expecting signs and wonders
[1:11:17] and more signs of wonders and for signs
[1:11:18] and wonders but the part of the God was
[1:11:21] ordained to get the people to believe
[1:11:23] and it's not just a belief signs and
[1:11:25] wonders but any man it was to get him to
[1:11:28] believe the word a man because the signs
[1:11:31] and the waters are pointing to the word
[1:11:32] by the grace of God no matter what when
[1:11:35] no matter what God has done down through
[1:11:37] the ages brother when God would do this
[1:11:39] God would do that it was to get your
[1:11:41] attention
[1:11:41] trusted to the to the word he was going
[1:11:44] to reveal a man so brothers with any
[1:11:47] whether it's in the Old Testament
[1:11:48] whether it's in the New Testament God
[1:11:50] always does this to get your attention
[1:11:55] any man why oh my god oh we we should be
[1:11:59] looking for this looking for that yes
[1:12:00] but God got to get our attention
[1:12:02] and then God gives us the word and the
[1:12:06] word think that the results of the word
[1:12:08] in our in our lives it's to get us to
[1:12:10] expect this and expect that amen it's a
[1:12:13] revelation of what God wants you to be
[1:12:15] looking for and expecting any may I did
[1:12:19] this but now I'm going to do this amen
[1:12:22] so your thoughts your focus your faith
[1:12:24] is what God is going to do a man is what
[1:12:28] it's got to be according to the prophecy
[1:12:31] a man and it's just not God doing it
[1:12:34] just just to show off but God is doing
[1:12:36] it for a reason God is doing it for a
[1:12:39] reason for our redemption for our
[1:12:40] salvation Amen hallelujah brother what
[1:12:44] God did in Luther's day was for a reason
[1:12:46] a man and he had he had to get their
[1:12:48] attention
[1:12:49] oh my look at look at what God did drug
[1:12:51] into
[1:12:52] oh my god allowed Luthor to do and God
[1:12:55] let him this way God let him that way
[1:12:57] creating it Luther a hunger and a thirst
[1:12:59] for justification a man and any any o
[1:13:05] God let him go his way on to finally God
[1:13:08] brought him back to the word anybody see
[1:13:11] his God bringing us back to the word
[1:13:12] again because why what knew that were
[1:13:16] looking for what Wesley was looking for
[1:13:18] well the Pentecostals were looking for
[1:13:20] what the bride is looking for is in the
[1:13:21] word a man brother if we got it we got
[1:13:24] to get back to the word to know what to
[1:13:26] expect a main the gotta to bring Luther
[1:13:29] back to the word to know what to expect
[1:13:32] concerning justification Wesley to know
[1:13:35] what to expect a certain extinct a
[1:13:37] vacation a man and the Pentecostals to
[1:13:40] know what to expect
[1:13:41] concerning the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:44] and the gifts of the Spirit a man and
[1:13:47] brother again that the enemy was always
[1:13:49] there to create a false expectation and
[1:13:52] I say that's where all the denominations
[1:13:54] come from a man they they they they
[1:13:56] laughter the revelation of the word and
[1:13:58] instead of walking in the light well
[1:14:00] will live in this Amen no you got to
[1:14:02] walk in it amen
[1:14:04] it's gotta read your life it's got to
[1:14:06] reflect it but what do they do they got
[1:14:08] away from the revelation amen the
[1:14:11] spiritual revelation in their heart
[1:14:12] amen they got away from that and they
[1:14:14] begin to oh yeah and make it a doctrine
[1:14:17] and they made a denomination out of
[1:14:19] justification they made a denomination
[1:14:22] out of sanctification they made a
[1:14:24] denomination out of the gifts of the
[1:14:26] Spirit and the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:14:28] and brother when they when they went
[1:14:30] into a denominational spirit then the
[1:14:32] Holy Spirit laughed and moved on
[1:14:35] amen because they saw the way this is
[1:14:37] what God's going to do and this is all
[1:14:39] that we need no you need to keep walking
[1:14:41] in the light a man and the truth the
[1:14:44] truth Lutheran's say they walk in the
[1:14:48] light and they went on he went over I
[1:14:49] Wesley and the wind
[1:14:51] Methodist's they went on into the night
[1:14:54] on into the actually the Papa said they
[1:14:57] went on there because the med that has
[1:14:58] organized so quickly he said he said
[1:15:01] guarded the race on William Booth with
[1:15:03] Radar salvation a man so what he what
[1:15:06] did we love do booth do and he went on
[1:15:08] the Salvation Army went on with the
[1:15:10] revelation of justification and
[1:15:12] sanctification amen to take it on unto
[1:15:16] the time for the Pentecostal revival and
[1:15:18] brother game we know that the Salvation
[1:15:20] Army in nearing the end of their
[1:15:22] ministries they were calling for the
[1:15:24] Pentecostal revival they were hungry no
[1:15:26] thirsting for what they what they said
[1:15:29] that what Peter had on the day of
[1:15:30] Pentecost a man say again proving
[1:15:33] whether father God said in a message he
[1:15:37] said when God is going to do something
[1:15:39] he said before he does it he'll send the
[1:15:42] anointing ahead he'll send the Holy
[1:15:44] Ghost ahead and he said to create in the
[1:15:47] hearts of the people ie should a hunger
[1:15:50] and a search for what God's gonna do and
[1:15:52] he said then they then he said they'll
[1:15:54] start to cry for it and they'll start to
[1:15:56] pray for it amen
[1:15:57] hungry thirsty and well Luther who was
[1:16:00] hungry and thirsty for justification but
[1:16:02] and the method is wrong on Thursday for
[1:16:04] sanctification amen and on into the
[1:16:07] Salvation Army they began to hunger and
[1:16:09] thirst for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:11] amen
[1:16:12] because they said and as I say it I've
[1:16:15] got the books at home were they were
[1:16:16] they said their servants and they said
[1:16:18] what we need is what they had on the day
[1:16:21] of Pentecost amen
[1:16:23] so God was creating them a hunger and
[1:16:25] thirst for the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:28] amen and then a number of years after
[1:16:31] God fulfilled a man in California they
[1:16:35] made God sent down the anointing of the
[1:16:38] Holy Ghost in Brooklyn again as a dry
[1:16:40] light the fact that well why is God
[1:16:43] brought the black brothers into the
[1:16:44] assembly here because brother that was
[1:16:47] that was the ones that God used for the
[1:16:49] Pentecostal revival it was the black
[1:16:51] brothers that were that were there
[1:16:53] in California Azusa Street and as I said
[1:16:57] they was standing here in the pulpit and
[1:16:58] pray and pray and pray and pray amen
[1:17:02] that was before the Pentecostal revival
[1:17:04] came and you think they get up there
[1:17:06] singing and preach no they get up there
[1:17:08] and pray amen
[1:17:10] and prayed why because there was God in
[1:17:12] them angry and thirsty for the baptism
[1:17:15] their hunger and thirst not just with a
[1:17:17] revelation of it now hung in a nursing
[1:17:20] for the experience a may as God wants us
[1:17:23] to hunger in search for the experience
[1:17:25] of the Resurrection and the experience
[1:17:27] of the rapture not just a revelation of
[1:17:29] it too often the individuals are cut out
[1:17:32] with a revelation I believe this I
[1:17:34] believe that I believe that are you
[1:17:35] experiencing it amen is God confirming
[1:17:39] your faith amen
[1:17:41] and coming to Africa to justify it in
[1:17:44] you a man by the by the power of the
[1:17:47] Holy Ghost amen
[1:17:49] Luther Luther and the revelation to
[1:17:51] finally God Prakriti that revelation in
[1:17:54] Luther he made it a reality in Luther
[1:17:56] anyway and experiencing Luther he was
[1:18:00] expecting it he got it and the father
[1:18:03] you got expected to get it a man and
[1:18:06] then Luther lived in a constant
[1:18:08] expectation of it to God amen MIT is
[1:18:11] anger and thirst amen and fulfill his
[1:18:15] expectation when he as I said when he
[1:18:17] went into the church and he opened the
[1:18:19] Bible said the just shall live by faith
[1:18:21] amen and he thought it was works he
[1:18:25] thought he had to do this into that and
[1:18:26] all the other do was accepted through
[1:18:28] Jesus hey my same whether the same ways
[1:18:31] that was sanctification same with the
[1:18:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost it is Christ
[1:18:35] in us the hope of glory and it's the
[1:18:37] same with the resurrection rapture it is
[1:18:40] Christ in us
[1:18:41] amen he said I am the resurrection and
[1:18:44] there any was their answer
[1:18:45] amen so if he's in you then the
[1:18:48] resurrection is in you if it's in you
[1:18:50] the rapture is in you hey man
[1:18:52] father brought grace to us through our
[1:18:54] blood brothers sister we're not looking
[1:18:55] to that I gotta do this I gotta do this
[1:18:57] I got to accept what God has done
[1:19:00] amen oh my god do this now
[1:19:03] praise the Lord that's good what what
[1:19:05] did he do it in you hey man he did this
[1:19:09] in Luger eating Wesley a man but Wesley
[1:19:12] discovered that what he did in delivery
[1:19:13] dude no he was also in him
[1:19:15] a man was the faith for justification
[1:19:18] then he went on to the faith for
[1:19:20] sanctification amen and we go on to the
[1:19:23] faith for the baptism of the holy God we
[1:19:25] accept the faith we accept the
[1:19:27] revelation of what God has shame a mayor
[1:19:30] and that's where that's where the
[1:19:32] Pentecostal revival started and brother
[1:19:34] I tell you this I went around the world
[1:19:36] hey man if one of the greatest revivals
[1:19:39] beyond losers revival be on Wesley's
[1:19:41] revival the Pentecostal revival amen it
[1:19:45] was it was Austrian the the end of all
[1:19:48] things a man and as a part of God city's
[1:19:51] ministry and his message was the climax
[1:19:53] of the Pentecostal message a man praise
[1:19:57] the name of the Lord brother they were
[1:19:59] looking for the coming of the Lord the
[1:20:00] Pentecostals but brother they failed to
[1:20:03] recognize the way he was coming how he
[1:20:05] was coming a man and the ministry that
[1:20:08] would for run is coming a May a ministry
[1:20:11] for Randy's first coming and why the
[1:20:13] first coming was to turn the hearts of
[1:20:15] the other the Jewish fathers to the
[1:20:17] Pentecostal children a night and then he
[1:20:20] saw I'm going to turn the hearts of the
[1:20:22] children back to the father's amen
[1:20:24] because within there they had
[1:20:26] Pentecostal fathers now because they
[1:20:28] they also have left the revelation left
[1:20:31] what God had started a man now he now is
[1:20:34] the children down here the Pentecostal
[1:20:36] children he got to turn their hearts
[1:20:38] back to the Pentecostal father's a man
[1:20:40] so that what God did back there God is
[1:20:43] doing now in a in a personal
[1:20:46] relationship with a bride in these last
[1:20:48] days
[1:20:49] Amen this is tremendous brother of what
[1:20:51] God does and what he does it a man and
[1:20:54] it's to create in us the expectation a
[1:20:57] man of whether whether Pentecostal said
[1:21:00] Amen right but what about something else
[1:21:02] they were experiencing what was it it
[1:21:04] was the resurrection amen and looking
[1:21:07] for the rapture because the baptism of
[1:21:10] the Holy Ghost is the resurrection of
[1:21:12] Christ in us amen
[1:21:14] obviously for the physical resurrection
[1:21:17] of the body he resurrects our soul he
[1:21:20] resurrects our spirit and we rapture
[1:21:22] today into heavenly places in Christ and
[1:21:24] as I said you had the quicken you as
[1:21:26] they made alive who were dead in sins
[1:21:27] and trespasses any bad
[1:21:30] we were resurrected a man and then we
[1:21:32] were caught up into a heavenly place to
[1:21:34] work for to hear the word the promise of
[1:21:37] what's going on in heavenly places
[1:21:39] Easter the word has been revealed a man
[1:21:42] to give us faith for this age faith for
[1:21:44] that age mate for the hour that we're
[1:21:46] living now and decreed in us the
[1:21:48] expectation what God wants in us amen
[1:21:52] okay whatever you want from God you got
[1:21:55] to expect it a man right on down through
[1:21:58] the Pentecostal right on into this age
[1:22:00] of the rest of the resurrection of
[1:22:02] rapturing faith brother are we expecting
[1:22:05] the rapture or just believing what God
[1:22:07] has done as our brother the fontaine
[1:22:09] bringing out is not not the message or
[1:22:12] it's the message amen
[1:22:14] we've got to move from what one God dude
[1:22:16] the person that God was using and come
[1:22:18] into what God is doing in the bride

[1:22:23] brother amen because there are so many
[1:22:25] yet today even around the message that
[1:22:28] are focusing on the messenger the
[1:22:29] messenger the messenger God did this God
[1:22:31] did this yeah but what's God doing a man
[1:22:34] sure God did this we can we can put the
[1:22:36] emphasis on on the sign in the hand we
[1:22:39] can put the emphasis on the discernment
[1:22:40] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:22:42] a man but brother sister we got the
[1:22:45] revelation of regarding the witness of
[1:22:47] it amen and what is it doing to us it's
[1:22:50] revealing Christ in us a man not just
[1:22:53] God him William Branham not just God
[1:22:55] with and round but now it is Christ in
[1:22:58] the bride and with the right a man the
[1:23:00] public God said I am the the best man he
[1:23:03] said unlike any in a wedding and what is
[1:23:07] the best man do in a natural way
[1:23:10] well he's to take the bride to take the
[1:23:11] Brier and put her hands in a in the end

[1:29:38] then remind me that I should have read
[1:29:40] on down little further he said in and
[1:29:43] get another verse there to confirm those
[1:29:47] that are in the spirit and in Romans
[1:29:50] chapter 8 the said in verse 1 there is
[1:29:58] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:30:00] which are in Christ Jesus

[1:30:23] it says who walk not after the flesh but
[1:30:26] after the spirit amen for the law of the

[1:31:03] sin and death
[1:31:05] thank God for what the law could not do
[1:31:10] in that it was weak through the flesh

[1:42:07] referred they knew from that has been
[1:42:09] known for years to be the rock amen
[1:42:14] symbolizing the rock of ages' amen by
[1:42:17] the grace of God oh this is tremendous
[1:42:21] god of her blushes amen brother
[1:42:24] I pray God through the preaching of the
[1:42:26] word that God is creating enough
[1:42:29] expectation to get out of here
[1:42:32] God is creating us the expectation for
[1:42:35] the resurrection the expectation for the
[1:42:37] rapture because brother it can't go on
[1:42:40] much longer
[1:42:41] hey man grace to us you gain enrollments
[1:42:49] bursaries for what the law could not do
[1:42:52] in that it was weak through the flesh
[1:42:53] God sending his own son in the likeness
[1:42:56] of sinful flesh and for sin condemned
[1:42:59] sin in the flesh that the righteousness
[1:43:02] of the law might be fulfilled in us who
[1:43:05] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:43:08] spirit see how important it is to walk
[1:43:10] in the spirit live in the spirit a man
[1:43:13] does not go by the letter of the word
[1:43:15] let's not go by the mechanics of the
[1:43:17] word by dieded by the dynamics a man by
[1:43:20] the grace of God as the prophet of God
[1:43:23] said if you're walking by the mechanic
[1:43:25] and dynamics of the word he said it
[1:43:28] would just take a man a woman a boy or a
[1:43:30] girl he said just lift up their hands
[1:43:33] and say Lord were coming home and he
[1:43:35] said Oh trigger the rapture what kind of
[1:43:40] faith would they have to have to say
[1:43:42] Lord I'm coming home oh my god or not
[1:43:45] defeat what is the mission this is
[1:43:49] tremendous do not focus you know what's
[1:43:52] going on it there then I concentrate on
[1:43:54] what's going on in California in that
[1:43:56] country and what's going on somewhere
[1:43:57] else no no no what something struck them
[1:44:01] the rapture what what do you mean oh the
[1:44:09] rapture is coming on what yes I feel the
[1:44:12] pole you feel the pole yeah praise the
[1:44:16] Lord hallelu
[1:44:17] and he by the prophet or Garcia teach
[1:44:18] you to look up and say oh I'm coming up
[1:44:22] Lord and his triggers the rapture and he
[1:44:26] starts and there go and he said what is
[1:44:31] it what's wrong now
[1:44:33] he said the trouble now in this hour he
[1:44:35] said they're putting too much emphasis
[1:44:36] on the mechanics and not enough on the
[1:44:38] dynamics amen
[1:44:41] they're putting so much emphasis on yeah
[1:44:43] and the messenger yes and even the Macan
[1:44:45] the message what about the dynamics of
[1:44:48] the message anyway that is ordained and
[1:44:51] predestinated to creating us a true
[1:44:53] expectation of the revealed word for
[1:44:57] this hour and brother we got nothing
[1:44:59] else to look for only the resurrection
[1:45:02] and the rapture for the bride there's
[1:45:06] nothing else left grace to us he said in
[1:45:13] verse 5 for they that are after the
[1:45:15] flesh do mind the things of the flesh
[1:45:17] and a lot of believers were caught up
[1:45:18] not with the rapture not with the spirit
[1:45:21] they're caught up with the natural
[1:45:23] things - fleshly things of this world
[1:45:25] they love it they're focusing on the
[1:45:28] natural the natural the natural I'm
[1:45:30] gonna do this I'm gonna do this I oh
[1:45:31] yeah I'm going to get this job and I'll
[1:45:34] get this much money and so on the
[1:45:38] content with such things as you have not
[1:45:42] many like that no no they come up with
[1:45:46] this world and the things of this world
[1:45:48] yes they that are after the flesh do
[1:45:53] mind the things of the flesh oh yeah
[1:45:55] your focus is not fleshly things natural
[1:45:58] things you want this you want that you
[1:46:01] want this oh yeah and after the rapture
[1:46:04] they were still here focusing on it till
[1:46:08] something happens and they realize they
[1:46:10] missed the rapture and it says they did
[1:46:14] they do mind the things of the flesh but
[1:46:16] they that are after the spirit the
[1:46:18] things of the Spirit and what is the
[1:46:21] things of the Spirit it's the word the
[1:46:25] Spirit focuses on the word amen for to
[1:46:29] be carnally minded or physically minded
[1:46:31] yeah - they currently mind are
[1:46:35] physically minded is death that's right
[1:46:40] but to be spiritually minded is life and
[1:46:44] peace amen
[1:46:46] it's eternal life and it says because
[1:46:50] the carnal mind is enmity against God
[1:46:54] God wants you to have a spiritual mind
[1:46:57] so God can speak to you God can talk to
[1:47:00] you God can reveal his word to you God
[1:47:02] can create in you the faith he wants the
[1:47:05] expectation he wants a man short of ink
[1:47:10] the carnal mind is enmity against God
[1:47:14] does make sure you got a spiritual line
[1:47:16] a Holy Ghost mine not a karma any for it
[1:47:22] is not subject to the law of God neither
[1:47:24] indeed can be so then they that are in
[1:47:27] the flesh cannot please God God helps
[1:47:33] that will be in the spirit but ye are
[1:47:39] not in the flesh but in the spirit if if
[1:47:43] so be that the Spirit of God dwelleth in
[1:47:46] you now then he may have not the Spirit
[1:47:50] of Christ he is none of these now
[1:47:52] brother we better make sure we got the
[1:47:54] Holy Ghost okay if you don't have the
[1:47:57] Spirit of Christ in you the life of his
[1:47:58] blood you're none of his God have mercy
[1:48:03] on us and in Christ be in you the body
[1:48:08] is dead because of sin but the Spirit is
[1:48:11] life because of righteousness amen
[1:48:15] see the importance make your calling and
[1:48:18] election sure that you got the baptism
[1:48:21] of the Holy Ghost creating it yeah
[1:48:23] that's true expectation if the spirit of
[1:48:27] him that raised up Jesus from the dead
[1:48:29] dwell in you he that raised up Christ
[1:48:31] from the dead shall also quicken your
[1:48:34] mortal bodies by his Spirit that
[1:48:36] dwelleth in you therefore brethren we
[1:48:39] are debtors not to the flesh to live
[1:48:42] after the flesh for if you live after
[1:48:44] the flesh he shall die but if each for
[1:48:48] the spirit to mortify or kill the deeds
[1:48:51] of the body ye shall live brother that's
[1:48:54] what we need to do is to kill the
[1:48:57] influence of the physical nature in this
[1:49:01] body a man and give preeminence to the
[1:49:05] spiritual nature the Holy Ghost nature
[1:49:08] amen
[1:49:10] by the grace of God
[1:49:12] amen oh my you don't have to turn I'll
[1:49:19] read it
[1:49:22] if you want to send Philippians 1 in
[1:49:31] Philippians 1
[1:49:41] Paul was encouraging the believers to
[1:49:50] rejoice in spite of suffering regardless
[1:49:55] of what you go through praise the Lord
[1:49:57] if you do it for the Gospels sake give
[1:49:59] God the glory he said I pray that your
[1:50:07] love may abound yet more and more in
[1:50:10] knowledge and in all judgment that she
[1:50:13] may approve things that are excellent
[1:50:15] that she may be sincere and without
[1:50:18] offence till the day of Christ this is
[1:50:22] being filled with the fruits of
[1:50:24] righteousness which are by Jesus Christ
[1:50:26] unto the glory and praise of God but I
[1:50:29] would ye should understand brethren that
[1:50:32] the things which happen unto me have
[1:50:35] fallen out rather on to the furtherance
[1:50:38] of the gospel amen
[1:50:40] so that my bonds in Christ are manifest
[1:50:44] in all the palace and in all other
[1:50:46] places amen and many of the Brethren in
[1:50:51] the Lord woxing confident by my bonds
[1:50:54] are much more bold to speak the word
[1:50:57] without fear brother sister what about
[1:51:00] the life you're living well your
[1:51:08] testimony continued that your Christian
[1:51:16] amen what what do other people see in
[1:51:20] you what does others think about you
[1:51:26] amen do they do they see the reflection
[1:51:31] of the Holy Ghost in you or to them it
[1:51:34] would not be the Holy Ghost or to them
[1:51:36] but just over there they're religious
[1:51:38] people they're they're good they got a
[1:51:41] good nature and so on they got a good
[1:51:43] attitude what do they see in you amen I
[1:51:50] trust we got Christ in you
[1:51:52] if you got Christ in you what they're
[1:51:53] gonna see they're gonna see a positive
[1:51:55] spirit a positive attitude most
[1:51:58] definitely
[1:52:00] and it's a even even those that you work
[1:52:02] with or you go to school with they'll
[1:52:05] know that it's Christ in you they know
[1:52:08] that you're different

[1:52:48] him to say you're you're gonna be a
[1:52:50] pastor why I said Lord why did he think
[1:52:55] that yeah just I guess they just they
[1:53:02] just knew I was Christian and so on and
[1:53:05] that I didn't get involved with this I
[1:53:07] didn't get involved with that and so on

[1:54:00] that was sick I prayed for her a
[1:54:03] teachers wife

[1:57:55] we are bear with me for a few moments
[1:58:00] here I don't have the time to go into
[1:58:06] all the notes but brother sister what
[1:58:11] God has done in this hour he's done to
[1:58:14] create in us a true expectation for the
[1:58:16] resurrection in the rapture there's not
[1:58:22] we caught up with a false expectation
[1:58:27] but the true revelation of the real
[1:58:29] resurrection and the real rapture when
[1:58:32] it comes to expectations the public God
[1:58:37] preached expectations
[1:58:41] 17 times from 1950 to 1961 just over it
[1:58:49] was 11 years and he preached 17 sermons
[1:58:52] on the title of expectations Noah was
[1:59:00] expecting the flood of water to cover
[1:59:02] all the earth and his works reflected
[1:59:07] his expectations he built an ark what
[1:59:13] was he expecting he was expecting a
[1:59:15] flood a man a God told him he believed
[1:59:20] God and he went out and he manifested
[1:59:24] the faith he did when Milner and he
[1:59:31] drilled it exactly the way that God want
[1:59:32] to build you do it the way God wants you
[1:59:35] to do it so Noah was expecting the flood
[1:59:39] what are you expecting
[1:59:41] in every age God has given his sons and
[1:59:46] daughters expectation something to look
[1:59:49] for something to press onto Abraham was
[1:59:53] expecting to have a son by Sarah even
[1:59:56] though she was barren and unfruitful for
[1:59:58] many years and even when they got to the
[2:00:03] age where it seemed impossible
[2:00:04] of all for him and her he still believed
[2:00:08] he was going to have a son by Sarah a
[2:00:13] man his words his deeds his attitude and
[2:00:17] spirit reflected is expectation and so
[2:00:21] brother our words and deeds and attitude
[2:00:24] of spirit reflect our expectation what
[2:00:27] expected if you're expecting the rapture
[2:00:31] you're going to reflect it
[2:00:34] Moses was expecting God through his
[2:00:39] ministry to take control of the Egypt
[2:00:42] and bring Israel out of Egypt to go into
[2:00:45] the Promised Land
[2:00:46] his works reflected is expectation
[2:00:51] probably God brings these things out
[2:00:54] your works prove your expectation yeah
[2:01:00] what you're expecting
[2:01:02] it's not just saying I believe it and go
[2:01:04] on no no you got to go and do what that
[2:01:09] faith requires amen if Noah had the
[2:01:15] faith there's gonna be a gonna be a
[2:01:16] flood well Lord how are we going to
[2:01:18] escape well he said oh just for you and
[2:01:22] your family I want you to build an ark
[2:01:24] what build an ark Lord if I go building
[2:01:28] an ark on dry land they'll think I'm
[2:01:32] crazy but he didn't he didn't he didn't
[2:01:38] consider those things he considered God
[2:01:41] he considered the word a man brother you
[2:01:46] don't consider the foolishness of the
[2:01:48] world and what the world's gonna think
[2:01:49] about you know you're not worried about
[2:01:51] that what does God think about you yeah
[2:01:56] so brother
[2:01:59] Noah's works
[2:02:01] Abraham's works and Moses works
[2:02:03] reflected what they were expecting God
[2:02:06] to do and to them it was positive hey
[2:02:11] man not maybe they were positive
[2:02:15] and David expected victory over the lion
[2:02:20] David expected victory over the bear and

[2:08:28] expecting to see the Messiah and
[2:08:30] introduced him to Israel and seeing
[2:08:33] Jesus coming to be baptized John cried
[2:08:36] out behold the lamb of God which taketh
[2:08:39] away the sin of the world what was John
[2:08:42] expecting a man he was expecting the
[2:08:46] Messiah in flesh and he believed he was
[2:08:51] the Messiah he didn't wait to see what
[2:08:54] Jesus would do it
[2:08:55] revealed to John a man he was ordained
[2:08:59] to forerun the first coming of the Lord
[2:09:01] the prophet of God in this hour was
[2:09:03] ordained to forerun the second coming a
[2:09:05] man and to turn our hearts back by the
[2:09:09] grace of God God Elvis and it says Simon
[2:09:16] the Prophet was fully expecting to see
[2:09:19] the Messiah before he was taken off the
[2:09:21] earth he was revealed to him by the Holy
[2:09:26] Ghost he fully recognized the Messiah in
[2:09:30] the arms of Mary when she brought him to
[2:09:32] the synagogue to be circumcised oh yeah
[2:09:36] now what kind of anointing was on him
[2:09:40] what was his life for him to be there in
[2:09:45] the temple for so many years and he's
[2:09:48] over 80 years old and then he sees a
[2:09:51] number of women coming in with their
[2:09:52] children their boys yeah babies and then
[2:09:57] then this woman comes in there Mary
[2:09:59] she would have baby in her arms and the
[2:10:04] spirit led him to her yeah he took that
[2:10:09] baby and he prophesied it was the
[2:10:13] Messiah he said now Lord he said let
[2:10:17] your servant depart in peace oh my
[2:10:22] brother's sister what was the expecting
[2:10:25] what he was expecting he recognized oh
[2:10:29] this is him here because God told him by
[2:10:33] the Holy Ghost that he wouldn't see
[2:10:34] death till he had he had blessed the
[2:10:38] Messiah
[2:10:39] amen how many children did he did he
[2:10:42] bless how many children did he see over
[2:10:44] the years until finally this one comes
[2:10:46] Mary comes in with this one oh the Lord
[2:10:51] revealed to him now he said Lord let
[2:10:53] your servant depart in peace are we
[2:10:58] expecting God to move in our hearts in
[2:11:01] our souls in our lives like he moved in
[2:11:03] Simon's Lane brother sister god help us
[2:11:08] it was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost
[2:11:11] and he fully recognized a messiah in the
[2:11:13] arms of Mary when she brought him to the
[2:11:16] synagogue to be circumcised the
[2:11:19] disciples in the upper room continued
[2:11:21] with one of one another in prayer and
[2:11:23] supplications expecting the power and
[2:11:26] the anointing of the Holy Ghost as jesus
[2:11:28] promised them their expectation was
[2:11:31] fulfilled on the day of pentecost amen
[2:11:35] grace in the bible we have many examples
[2:11:39] of faithful expectations revealed and
[2:11:43] brought to pass in the lives of the sons
[2:11:45] and daughters of god what they expected
[2:11:48] they received a man and what the Lord
[2:11:53] has done in this age has revealed the
[2:11:54] mystery of God to give us the
[2:11:56] expectation of the climax of the
[2:11:59] resurrection and the rapture by the
[2:12:02] grace of God amen
[2:12:05] so are we expecting the resurrection and
[2:12:08] rapture as Noah was expecting the flood
[2:12:12] are we expecting the resurrection and
[2:12:15] rapture as Abram was expecting his
[2:12:17] promised son as Moses was the victory of
[2:12:21] bringing Israel out of Egypt do we have
[2:12:24] that expectation the last message that
[2:12:28] the Prophet preached on expectation was
[2:12:32] in 1961 in Virginia and he said I wish
[2:12:40] he said to read from Saint Luke the
[2:12:43] second chapter and Bo there was a man in
[2:12:46] Jerusalem whose name was Simeon the same
[2:12:49] was just a devout waiting for the
[2:12:51] consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost
[2:12:54] was upon him we need the Holy Ghost on
[2:12:57] us and it was revealed on to him by the
[2:13:00] Holy Ghost that he would not see death
[2:13:02] before he had seen the Lord's Christ now
[2:13:06] is it for a text to build the context
[2:13:09] expectations such meetings isa draws
[2:13:13] expectations and he said there's always
[2:13:15] three classes of people and he said the
[2:13:18] unbeliever the make believer and the
[2:13:21] it just attracts those attentions it's
[2:13:23] always has been but expectancy and he
[2:13:27] said that's a great thing to expect
[2:13:29] something and he should usually get what
[2:13:32] you expect a man and he said by those
[2:13:36] who are expected to get something God
[2:13:38] will give them their expectations and if
[2:13:40] they're doing it reverently and in the
[2:13:43] fear of God any man now he should always
[2:13:47] to find out something first is to find
[2:13:50] out whether it's the will of God or not
[2:13:52] then you can sincerely in your heart
[2:13:55] expect it and he said and many said in
[2:13:59] all ages when they have heard the voice
[2:14:02] of God speaking to them and he said they
[2:14:04] haven't seen the supernatural and they
[2:14:07] had they have expected and live their
[2:14:10] life expecting this to happen and
[2:14:14] brother/sister because they lived their
[2:14:16] life expecting it it never did fail and
[2:14:22] he said Abraham he said expected the
[2:14:24] baby even down til 25 years after it was
[2:14:28] promised him he was still expecting it
[2:14:31] and he believed God yes amen he believed
[2:14:37] God how many believers really believe
[2:14:40] God oh we believe God sent a prophet
[2:14:44] yes but Prabhas gone where's your faith
[2:14:50] now amen
[2:14:53] I wrote the message it's not many got
[2:14:56] faith in the message or the faith of the
[2:15:00] message no no God had mercy on us
[2:15:04] he said it makes you act funny when you
[2:15:07] really take God at His Word and when
[2:15:10] you're acting like you expected amen are
[2:15:15] we acting and living like we expect God
[2:15:19] to fulfill the scripture the
[2:15:22] resurrection the rapture
[2:15:29] he said old church he said we ought to
[2:15:34] be expecting to see God do something
[2:15:38] ought to expect to see a shaking amongst
[2:15:43] the people certainly it's promised to us
[2:15:46] we believe it you believe with me it
[2:15:49] will put our hearts together a man and
[2:15:53] believe something is going to happen but
[2:15:57] we got to put our hearts together we got
[2:16:00] to have the same expectation that you're
[2:16:04] here because you're looking for the
[2:16:06] resurrection and rapture in faith amen
[2:16:09] you're coming to church to hear the word
[2:16:12] to increase our faith in the
[2:16:13] resurrection in the rapture taught at
[2:16:16] mercy
[2:16:17] he said it's got to happen he said if
[2:16:21] you're expecting it and your expectation
[2:16:25] is according to your faith it's got to
[2:16:28] happen and he said certainly amen
[2:16:33] and he goes on to talk about Simon again
[2:16:35] and what Simon saw but God had revealed
[2:16:38] to him he said the Holy Ghost told me
[2:16:41] the Holy Ghost reveal it to me that I
[2:16:43] wasn't going to see death until I seen
[2:16:46] the Lord's Christ I believe it he said
[2:16:49] that's all I believe it amen
[2:16:52] so we do we believe considering what the
[2:16:55] Providence said about the rapture and
[2:16:57] the resurrection in this hour by the
[2:17:00] grace of God amen
[2:17:04] trusts were not currently minded
[2:17:06] physically minded but we are spiritually
[2:17:08] minded caught up with the spirit Holy
[2:17:12] Ghost life of Christ in us the dynamics
[2:17:16] of the word are we not thirsting for the
[2:17:19] resurrection and the rapture God have
[2:17:24] mercy on us
[2:17:28] listen brother the fontain brought out
[2:17:31] this this tremendous
[2:17:35] he said we are not as good if we're I
[2:17:42] wonder who took notes for brother la
[2:17:46] Fontaine did you close this in your
[2:17:48] notes our brother brought out the
[2:17:53] revelation he said we are not dating
[2:17:56] Jesus
[2:17:58] he said we're married to Jesus amen oh I
[2:18:05] thought that was tremendous
