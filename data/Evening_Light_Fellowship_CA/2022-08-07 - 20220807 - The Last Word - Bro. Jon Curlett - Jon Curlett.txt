we're so thankful lord that we have lord a guaranteed end in our lives lord jesus the lord we know there's a a time there's a road between now and then that we have to walk so lord we pray you give us strength for the journey this morning lord that lord if we've wandered off to the left or right that you bring us back to the center of the road heavenly father to that highway of holiness lord jesus may you just draw us closer to you in this service lord lift us up to a higher plane lord take us into deeper depths of your love lord of greater revelation lord in our lives that would hold us against the enemy we pray lord touch your people once again we ask in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen thank you musicians that will be it this morning if you'll turn the scriptures to isaiah 55 and then isaiah 55 and certainly good to have delfina back she's not here this this morning but she's back we want to remember to pray for her as she starts to think about where she's going to live when she's done her school she'll be here for one semester i believe and then after that she's got to decide does she stay here does she go somewhere else does she go back home does she go to bc or these different places so we want the lord to lead her amen i remember when i left newfoundland and i met with brother gerald and we talked for two hours and we got down and we prayed together and we believed the lord led us didn't we brother gerald even when he led us away we believed he let us amen and we know that he brought me back but we always want the lord's will we don't want to hold things too tightly and then we want him to have his way in to take her to where she can grow where she can mature where she can be best fit into a body where she can have a real effect amen i see we've got a new family here i think it's brother joe and sister priscilla amen good to have them back amen they've been gone so long i'm not sure if it's them but by their fruits we'll know them amen that it was brother joe and sister priscilla that returned to us amen brother chad and sister lee also back from vacation and then good to have them back as well amen yes brother joe says remember the saints in central with the fires they've got a state of emergency there and beta spare highway's been opened and closed a number of times but things are very dry there it's been very hot so we definitely want to remember not only the saints there but everyone there amen amen but certainly remember the saints that god would preserve their lives preserve their property amen that he bring rain and bring those fires under control amen isaiah 55 and verse 9 says for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but watereth the earth and make it it to bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void amen but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in a thing where unto or where to i sent it amen god bless you can have your seats this morning what a beautiful scripture to start with this morning amen amen not just promise but it's prophecy amen amen i can think of no greater promise in the word of god where when he says when god speaks it's going to happen amen that once it leaves his lips that when the thoughts of god are expressed then it cannot return to him without achieving that which he sent it out amen isaiah 55 in a nutshell says when god says it it's going to happen and you can take it to the bank amen i'm taking a bit of a different direction this morning we're going to leave our regularly scheduled program and i want to speak this morning on the last word amen now today when we think of you know somebody getting the last word when you're in a discussion with somebody so often the goal if we were to be honest is to get the last word isn't it if you're in an argument with somebody if you're having a disagreement the idea is that whoever gets the last word is going to win amen amen and that's not what we want to do as believers amen but that's often what our carnal minds would want to say is if i can get the last word then i'm going to show them who won and who really knows most and this and that the other thing and you know when it comes to the last word there was an infamous incident that happened at philly and gardens about 25 years ago on the soccer field if you remember where the brothers of bible believers association took on the young men of bible believers association and this incident was caught on video if you remember and what happened was there was a young slugger named jonathan corletta at the home plate and he hit a pitch and it went about just over second base and he was a fast runner but there was a fast thrower there around second and when that man threw that ball to first it was a very close call that was made there and of course all of those behind jonathan curlett's slugging team said he's safe and all of the older brothers said he's out and the question was who was going to get the last word amen and this went down in infamy in newfoundland history we know because they called me out and we disagreed heavily with that but the truth is in those games there's only one umpire and it's the adults isn't it the adults were the ones that got the last word now we've we've held long that that i was safe there but i will have to admit that i did review the footage last year sometime and i was indeed out amen they had the last word and were lucky that they were right but for many years we held a grudge against them because they were the ones that had the last word and they called us out in that game and i believe we lost that game on account of that call so no doubt there was much judgment called down on them in our prayers that night amen but the thing is whoever gets the last word that's the one that holds the power and that's the one that holds the authority so often amen many times we're in a situation perhaps you get into one and and perhaps i've been on the bad side of this where somebody's doing all the talking and you've got something you want to say and it's one thing if you agree with them but if you disagree with them and they're dominating the conversation it's really hard to sit there because you can't get any word in i mean they're dominating it they've got so much that they've got to say and really what's happening is if somebody else is speaking they're sitting there waiting for that person to take a breath so they can get right back in and either interrupt them or start speaking yet again and then they always want the last word and there's nothing so satisfying again in our carnality as when that person takes a pause to maybe hydrate their parts throat from talking so much and you jump in and you expound on everything that you have that that that refutes their argument and then you say i've got to go now. and you walk away having gotten the last word having destroyed their argument at least in your own mind and you walk away and you've got the last word and there's a deep sense of satisfaction that comes from that if you've ever been in a debate you know the satisfaction that comes from dismantling somebody's argument and then being able to walk away with them being able to offer a rebuttal kind of as you you know you're getting in your car and you just as you're about to close the door you say one last thing that seals it and then you drive away and they can't ever come back and talk to you anymore and that's when we're the speaker but so often we're in the audience and if you look at a debate so many times if you look at a court case if you've noticed the defense always gets to go last if they want because it's the last opportunity to influence the jury it's the last opportunity to influence the judge with their case and so what happens so often is they'll jockey to try and get that last that last word in especially again in debates because the person that speaks last gets to leave the greatest impression usually they get to override the evidence that has been brought forth perhaps they get to leave in your mind the points that highlight the strengths of their case while dismissing the things that would take away from their case they get to highlight from a position of strength having put aside all of the weaknesses that the other person has tried to put in them amen but the thing is when it comes to the audience listening because we are an audience listening amen as the bride of christ and then regardless of who goes last the audience the jury has to decide who they're going to believe which voice they're going to heed which one makes the most sense which one brought the most truth which one held closest to the facts that would approach the story that they've tried to present amen and they've listened and they've regarded each argument and point and when it's all said and done they've got to make a decision on which word they're going to believe amen and as believers we're listening to voices that have been speaking for over 6 000 years amen and there's only two sets of voices there's god's voice and then there's everybody else there's god's voice and then there's everybody else amen you only have one side to pick but one side has many voices and one side has one voice amen because satan will come at you from so many different angles with so many approaches there's so many people with so many temptations with so many points of logic and education and experience and god only comes at you with one voice and that is the word of god amen he only comes to you with one thing but satan will come at you with many things and as they say in in law they say they're trying to prove by a preponderance of evidence by an overwhelming weight of evidence which one is right and god's sitting there and he just reads from the same playbook over and over and over again and satan's trying to keep bringing things over and over again from as many places as he can draw from to try and get us to believe his word amen now my title this morning is the last word and the question i want to ask is who is getting the last word in your life amen i want to go back to our opening scripture and take it from the beginning of isaiah 55 this morning and just stay here for a little bit if you would and it says ho everyone that thirsteth come ye to the waters and he that had no money come ye buy and eat ye come buy wine and milk without money and without price so what he's saying here is what's your excuse for being thirsty and what's your excuse for being hungry because he says if you're hungry there's food to eat and if you're thirsty there's something to drink so if you're thirsty it's not because that there's nothing to drink it's because you're not drinking and if you're hungry it's not because there's nothing to eat but because you haven't taken that which is available to you verse 2 says wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfieth not hearken diligently unto me and eat ye that which is good and let your soul delight itself in fatness he's saying why are you spending so much time and money and effort for something that won't feed you why are you working so hard for something that won't truly satisfy he says listen up focus on things that will feed your soul that will make your soul fat in this day and age fatness is not considered a sign of health or or anything like that but in the old days fatness meant wealth because only wealthy people could eat so much that they could get fat they didn't work so hard but they made more than everybody else so they could eat and get fat but people that were just scrounging to get by they were always lean and mean why because they had to work so hard and they never had enough he's saying eat so that you're fat show that you've got an abundance of what it takes to make your soul prosper verse three says incline your ear and come unto me here and your soul shall live and i will make an everlasting covenant with you even the sure mercies of david we're listening to voices and god says hear my voice and you'll live and he says look to david as an example as to what that looks like amen it's easy to jump back this morning as i'm thinking on you know in his form and with his mind and i don't want to do that this morning i want to stick tight to my inspiration but this this scripture i had actually in the in the next service but i wanted to bring it back into this one and brother branham says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches this is all through revelation two and three in the church ages and then he says how tragic it is that this first age did not listen to the spirit instead it listened to man but thank god in the last stage there will be a group rise up the true bride of the last day and she will listen to the spirit and in that day of gross darkness the light will return by the pure word and we will return to the power of pentecost to welcome back the lord jesus christ amen you want to be able to hear the right voice not just hear a voice but you've got to make sure it's the right voice that it's the voice of god that you're hearing what the spirit is saying to the churches amen and what he's saying here in isaiah 55 is that it pays to heed the voice of god recognize it believe it heed it and then wait on it or trust on it to come to pass amen amen i hear people talking sometimes and and the language that they're using doesn't come from the scriptures i'm listening to the things they say and the way they say it and i'm sitting there i'm saying that doesn't sound like a bible reading christian i'm talking about believers now i'm talking about professing christians and the things that they're saying sounds like somebody that's feeding on something other than their bible it comes from feeding on the news and it comes from feeding on social media and it comes from feeding on on things that popular people are saying but it doesn't come back and align with the word and i'm sitting there and i'm saying that's not going to take me in a rapture that's not going to get me out of here furthermore it's not going to give me peace and it's not going to give me rest it's not going to give me joy and it's definitely not going to give me patience because all it's doing is riling us up rather than settling us down into resting on the foundation the sure foundation of the word of god amen it's taking them to a different kingdom and it's not the heavenly kingdom and it's not for the heavenly kingdom's purpose amen our language ought to reflect what we're it does reflect what we're reading it reflects what we're listening to what we're watching every day and i want to make sure that what we're speaking sounds like we've been reading our bibles in man we ought to be saying what the word says now in isaiah 55 continuing it says behold i have given him who david for a witness to the people a leader and commander to the people he's saying watch david's life and if you do what david did you're going to come out okay in the end and you look at it because david's life is a witness of the grace of god and the election and calling of god david is not perfect but he's probably my favorite person in the scriptures because he is what he is because god called him and he heeded it and he followed it and he didn't push it but he sat back and he let god do what he needed to do but as god moved on him he moved into situations and he took care of business so to speak we heard it when uh brother gerald played the the three kinds of believers where david said as he ran up to goliath he says what the god that made me is greater than you he wasn't saying i'm greater than you he didn't say i have more skill i have more experience or anything like that none of that would be true but he says the god that made me the god that called me is greater than you goliath and that's the basis on which i'm going to defeat you is that i'm coming because he's greater than you not because i'm greater than you but david got himself into problems he numbered the people didn't he and you weren't supposed to number the people because it was going back to the arm of flesh and he did what he went to the philistines because he got so tired of running around that he said i'll go to my enemies because the enemy of my enemy is my friend and i'll go spend some time with them to get the break i need and god still delivered him out of that but he paid a price didn't he he paid a price but every time god was able to bring him all the way back around to where david needed to be so he could come and take the throne of israel again amen he paid prices for his mistakes but god was always there to bring his word to pass and that's what david you're going to be a king amen and nothing david did could stop that verse 5 says behold thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not that's us he says and nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the lord thy god and for the holy one of israel for he hath glorified thee seek ye the lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near we spoke on the mercy seat last time and there's mercy now so take advantage of it amen don't look for judgment look for mercy now take advantage of all it's here because when it's gone it's gone for good right and you've got to go all the way then to the white throne judgment verse 7 says let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the lord and he will have mercy upon him and to our god for he will abundantly pardon him and his mercies are new every morning and then to those that are asking for it there's always mercy available amen and if there's a call for it then there's going to be something waiting for the believer when he does it now we come to where we start it says for thy my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord so if you have given your heart to god and your thoughts haven't changed then there's a problem with your conversion if you're saying that i am a child of god now and your thoughts and mannerisms and and the way of life hasn't changed then there's going to be a problem because he says what my thoughts are not your thoughts and my ways are not your ways so if you've changed from an old creature to a new then you've got new thoughts and you've got new ways because now you're walking with him amen you can't walk with god and not change it's impossible even if you're raised in a message home especially if you're raised in a message home i would say because you've got to come up to a higher level of thinking you've got to come to a new way of living and it's through the holy spirit it's not through you know isms and legalism and you must do this and you must do that it's not dead doctrine now but it's life living within you verse 9 says for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts and your thoughts so which way will you choose his way or your way and his thoughts are your thoughts his thoughts are going to be way up here and his way is going to be way up here but through the holy spirit you can get there amen you can catch the thoughts of god jesus said i call you friends i share things with you i don't share with anybody else because why you're close to me we're allowed to catch the thoughts of god and those thoughts of us god show us the way of god in our lives for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but watereth the earth and maketh that bring forth and bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater now i want to stop here this is where we finish because god's setting a type for us to understand how his word works and he says my word is like the rain and snow that fall now rain and snow come down and when they come down they stay down now we know the water cycle we know that water can't evaporate and it goes up as a vapor but it doesn't go back up as rain and it doesn't go back up as snow does it when it comes down it stays down now some of it leeches into the ground and plants and whatnot take it some of it goes even further down and it feeds the underground rivers and streams and then some of it stays on the surface and it flows to other areas where it can help water the plants and the earth and these different things but in the end there's a cycle that's happening and it's unchanging and it works it works once the water cycle was set in motion it's been going ever since and guess what man doesn't have to start it man doesn't have to stop it men doesn't have to do anything it just goes and goes and goes it's unrelenting you can't stop the water cycle it's going to happen when rain comes down then something's going to happen there's going to be an effect of it amen and so as long as there's something on earth to receive that rain and put it to use then it will always bring forth food amen it'll always bring forth something it's going to bring forth fruit amen as long as seeds are there the water will bring it out listen you can put a seed in a napkin a dead seed a dry seed you put it in a napkin you dip that napkin in water and just lay it out on your on your windowsill and that seed will come to life just with water and warmth eventually it's going to need some dirt but just the water alone will bring that seed out and it'll get it started amen now the the scripture says that just as that is just as the rain is and how it works it says so shall my word be that goeth forth of my forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto i sent it so you say my words just like rain and when it comes when it falls out it can't come back the way it went and then it drops and it's given by what his pleasure amen so if it speaks it's uh if he speaks it's always going to produce is what he's saying here god speaks his word with two things intention and pleasure amen now pleasure not meaning that it's fun but pleasure meaning that it pleases him that it is right in his saw in his eyes that doesn't mean it's always good for the receiver but it means it's right in god's eyes amen god speaks things that what are good in his sight and right in his sight and so when he speaks he cannot take it back as we started with it has to happen if god speaks judgment judgment happens if god speaks peace peace happens if god speaks healing then healing happens if god speaks joy then joy happens god speaks sadness and sadness happens and if god speaks restoration the restoration happens as well amen i want to be on the side of the good things that god speaks that's for sure amen but i love how the scripture says it shall accomplish that which that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing where to ascend it so his will drives his word and his word ensures that prosperity follows now i'm not preaching a prosperity gospel this morning because the prosperity that it's talking about here is not financial prosperity necessarily it is not the blessings of god necessarily but this word prosper means to advance to make progress to succeed to bring to successful issue so what it's saying here is that when it says god's word will prosper it means that it's going to keep moving forward it will not cease until that word has been fulfilled what it means is that the word of god when it says it's prosperous it means it is relentless it is going and going and going and going until it achieves that which it was meant to achieve now if you've ever played sports you'll always find eventually you run up against somebody that's relentless right if you're in hockey and you've got a relentless guy that's for checking you and no matter what you do as soon as you get that puck he's on you and he's whacking your stick and he's whacking your shin pads and he's shoving you away from the puck and everywhere you go he's on you i played against guys like that i hate them because you can't do anything it's so they're so relentless they're like a dog on a bone that's the way my brother nathan is when he plays hockey right he's just always on you and it's brutal to play against them there's a couple guys i've played against in my life amen and it makes life difficult on the ice because you can't do anything they're always on you they're stuck to you like glue and that's what he's saying here is the word of god is relentless that it is always pressing towards what it's supposed to achieve it doesn't slow down it doesn't take naps it doesn't go to sleep it doesn't take a break doesn't have to rehydrate it doesn't have to recharge itself once it goes it goes and it doesn't stop until it's achieved today man the relentless word of god is going to achieve what god has promised that it would achieve brother brown puts it this way he says just think the earth that we're setting on tonight is the word of god made manifest the world was framed together by things which does not even appear that's the way the word works you don't have to see what's creating what needs to come to place as long as it comes out eventually amen he says he just said let there be and it was how easy is it for that god to heal a sick body then if he can build a creation by just speaking it see his word if we could only get faith to see what his word is we are so earthbound and so conglomerated in our mind he says oh i don't know we've had so many and i took out what he said here because it was a nonsensical word but he blended two words together and i think what he meant was we've had so many inoculations and indoctrinations a shot from this one and a shot from that one and it's just got us to a place where she's all twisted up he says but if you could ever shake the whole thing loose come back to know that he is god and his words can no more fail than he can fail amen we need a shaking in our lives i believe i believe i need a shaking in my life amen i want it i need it every day i'm saying lord i remember when brother aaron oglesby was here and he he asked that question at the beginning of service he says what hinders you what is it that hinders you whatever hinders me i want to have shaken out of my life amen i want god to knock those things off to cut them off to beat them up whatever it takes to get them off amen it needs to be pulled away so that we can be what creatures that are maturing in christ how do you shake those things off heed the voice that's what paul says he says see that you refuse not him that speaketh for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he had promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signified the removing of those things that are shaken as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain i say god shake my life shake my habit shake my friendships shake my desires shake all of it amen get rid of anything that won't stand before your word what's he saying here everything that can be shaken will be shaken and in the believer's life it's going to be replaced with something that cannot ever be shaken i want to stand on a more sure foundation this morning amen he says what wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved are you being moved this morning are you unstable are you unsure are you in doubt if you are then i've got to say that you're not receiving a kingdom the way you ought to receive it because that kingdom can't be moved and when you're in that kingdom when you're a part of that kingdom when you're on that foundation then you'll be as stable as the kingdom that you're in he says receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved what happens let us have grace let us have grace whereby we may do what serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear why for our god is a consuming fire amen a believer is going to have everything taken out of their life that gets in god's way he'll burn it out shake it out beat it out and then like the gold that has to go through the refining process he beats it until all the dross is out and he sees his perfect reflection amen brother brown says and if that word fails then god fails and if god fails there he isn't god see and you remember he can't say one thing here and something else over here he's got to stay with his first decision in order to be god and he's only asked us one thing to believe that what he said is the truth and he'll bring it to pass oh how beautiful he says you expected a spontaneous thing to happen we do sometimes we believe we say we believe and we say that's it it's going to happen boom he says that's what you believe he says sometimes it just takes a little bit of faith it won't make a miracle but if you'll hold on to it it'll bring you out just stay right with it i've read this quote before now brother ram takes this whole thing and he's saying once the word goes forth if you can tie into that word if you can anchor yourself to that word it'll carry you through and then he gives us the example of the the children of israel to show what it looks like when god sends his word out and it prospers when it is relentless and he says israel was in their journey going to palestine coming from egypt and the lord was with them that's the key here the lord was with them he says every enemy that had raised up before israel was moved out of the way for god said he would send hornets before them and would drive out the enemy as long as they walked in obedience to his command watch this the job was never too big the job was never too big moses or joshua take two million men women and children across a raging river and destroy a land that has walled cities that has giants that has people that are dedicated to destroying you that has trained people with weapons and chariots that you can't even hope to match go in there and do it he says the job was never too big the amalekites the giants of the day meant nothing to israel though they were small men in stature but they were walking in what thus saith the lord so no matter what the opposition was god has always seen that his words of promise never failed israel now catch this he says and the old testament the israel of the old testament is a type of the bride of the new testament coming up where out of this world marching on the road to canaan or the canaan that we go to the millennium so what's he saying no job is too big whatever faces you as long as you're on the road to canaan no job is too big what battle lies before you this morning is it a battle of your poor choices and decisions so many times we're in battles and it ain't because we're in god's will it's because we're in our will and what we do is we sit back and we say well i'm in a battle that means that i'm in god's will no no no no in a battle does not mean you're in god's will listen if you're in a battle with the world if you're in the battle with other people that doesn't mean a thing because the world's fighting with everybody these days right so if you're in a battle with the world if you're in a battle with with the way things are going that's not necessarily meaning that it's god amen you can't win a battle you started by listening to the wrong voice and we can take that right back to the scriptures because we see jehoshaphat remember he was there with ahab and ab says will you come and fight with me at rammeth gilead and he says well let's talk to god about this do you have any prophets and ahab says yeah i've got 450 of them 450 prophets come out and they say go up the lord is with you one man even makes the horns and says with these horns you're going to destroy the enemy now what happens is he says but is there one more and that one man comes out and he says don't do it for i saw israel scattered as sheep and guess what jehoshaphat ignored the one man that was anointed by the spirit of god and he went out and he aligned himself with a man that was under god's judgment but i want you to see how he got there because they never did win that battle but joshua jehoshaphat was in the battle and he gets out alive and it's only god's grace but watch how he gets there in second chronicles 18 verse 1 it says now jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance you know what that tells me jehoshaphat was blessed before he ever met ahab god was with him it says and then he joined affinity with ahab so jehoshaphat was doing great because god didn't bless israel unless you were in god's will if you were following god's word then he blessed you and if you weren't then he brought judgment so now ahab's facing judgment and jehoshaphat has nothing to do with it joseph's blessed but it says in verse two and after certain years he went down to ahab to samaria and ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance and for the people that he had with them and persuaded him to go up with him to rhamath gilead and ahab king of israel said to jehoshaphat king of judah will thou go with me to ramoth gilead and watch his answer he said and he answered him i am as thou art and my people as thy people and we will be with them war joseph wasn't like ahab but he says i'm just like you and my people are just like yours as well he's confessing that i'm the same as an unbeliever not a make-believer ahab's an idolatry he's not a make-believer anymore he is an unbeliever yet he has prophets that report to him that's a messed up man he's got a murdering idolatrous wife joshua doesn't have that but jehoshaphat says listen i'm just like you and ahab wined him and he dined him and he made him feel special until jehoshaphat started to feel that he was special joshua was special before he ever came to ahab god was with him god bless them but he comes and this man this king starts to whine and dine him starts to make him feel like a big shot and all of a sudden he says i'm just like you when you start saying things like that to unbelievers you're on the path to pain when you start linking up with people that are not believers you're on the path to pain and he's aligning himself with a man that has had judgment already pronounced on him by the prophet ahab's been judged he's already been said the dogs are jezebel the dogs are going to lick your blood and ahab you're going to die in battle it's already been told that prophet's long gone but the prophecy is still there ahab you're going to die in battle and now he's about to go into battle and he's scared and he gets another believer he gets a believer to come in and say can you join up with me and keep me safe that's hard preaching when we say don't line up with unbelievers but guess what we can get into it in business we can get into it in social media we can get into it with friendships we can get into it with acquaintances listen our hobbies like i said so many times i like cars guess what if i started hanging out with car people there's a lot of bad people out there when i say bad meaning people that have none of the values and morals of a believer and you see it because fast cars attract fast money and fast women and guess what that's what you'll find if you hang around a lot with it that's why i don't hang around with car people because there's nothing good in it my part might be clean but what it comes with it is nothing good amen it's the same thing for anyone else you can't align yourself with people that aren't under the word of god for this day in this age amen it'll never profit the kingdom of god and if it won't profit the kingdom of god it won't profit you because that's the only prophet we're concerned about isn't it amen the thing i'm saying is if you're in a battle check and make sure you're on spiritual ground before you get hurt because if you're not you need to repent and back off and say lord help me get me out of this i got in it but lord i'm asking you to get me out i'm your child i'm sorry but will you help me to get out of it amen amen we're not spiritual because we're in a battle and then we're all going to be in battles but you got to make sure you're in a real battle amen listen to what ahab says verse 29 he says in the king of israel that's ahab said to jehoshaphat i will disguise myself and i will go to the battle but put thou on thy robes in other words he says yeah i'm the king but i'm just going to dress like a regular soldier in this one but you you dress like the king why he wants him to be the target he wants him to take the pain of ahab's judgment he wants him to pay the price that ahab's rightly supposed to pay and jehoshaphat the king of israel disguised himself and they went to the battle so we've got a make-believer we've got an unbeliever that take asks the believer that he knows is blessed of god to take his judgment now puts him under pressure to try and take what the pressure off of ahab the probability of ahab dying in that battle you know what that looks like today sometimes when i make a mistake and i go and i ask a deacon to come with me to sort it out because what i'm asking somebody to come and support me in my pain that's not what we're supposed to do i'm supposed to take my own lumps aren't they and whether it's a retraction from a pulpit or going to talk to a brother and sister and saying i'm sorry i did something wrong we don't gain we don't set up alliances to help us make things right we got to take our own lumps we got to take our own pain we got to go and humble ourselves to that person or to that situation say i was wrong forgive me because otherwise if i go in and i got brother matt or brother joe with me what's that brother or sister going to think i'm under attack and my goal shouldn't be to go to attack it should be to go there and make things right and i do that humbly and sincerely by myself and the only time i'd ever go back with another person is if it wasn't received that they wouldn't do anything for it amen and then we're not here to build each other up in our mistakes right so when you see somebody sliding you don't go and help them get out of their sliding you let god get them out because they've got to pay a price sometimes they've got to learn the lesson for themselves if we keep doing what getting them out of pain they'll never learn we learn that with our children eventually right there comes a point where you have to hand them over to god and you say god they're in your hands now i've taught them i've helped them i've done everything i can but at this point they know better and so they've got to pay the price there is uh hopefully it's okay to say this um i will say that i won't say names but one of the kids that that came with my family to visit left something here and uh they said if you find it send it to us and we'll pay well what we found out and my wife told me is that samuel had taken it from this person and so my wife just kind of stuck it on the counter and it got left there so i told my sister i said yep we found it i'll send it back and she says well we'll pay for i said no no samuel took it so we'll pay for it and she said well no because we've been trying to teach him a lesson not to forget that everywhere he goes so she said we'll pay for it she said it wasn't that much anyways it was 35 or something to ship it really quickly but she said he's got to learn the lesson and the only lesson he's going to learn now we've told him too many times the only lesson he's got to learn now is through the pain of his wallet right she didn't say we'll pay for it she said he'll pay for it he should have checked he should have made sure that he had that before he left your house this morning amen make sure you're under the right kind of protection make sure you're under protection of the word not under the protection of your own rightness or your own thoughts amen we don't want to take the heat off of each other because god's using the heat we're all under heat we're all under pressure we're all under under the working hand of the of the master craftsman aren't we and he's beating things out of us and guess what at the end it's maybe not too difficult but at the beginning there's a lot of beating that goes on what he's knocking off the big chunks he's taking out the big things in our lives that we need to get rid of says now the chit now the king of assyria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him saying fight ye not with smaller greats save only with the king of israel now he knows the king of judah is there but he says focus on the king of israel that's ahab he says the king of israel says the only person i care about in this battle is ahab kill ahab and guess who looks like ahab joseph he's the face of the business he's the face of the kingdom now he's the only one dressed in the king's robes and the king of syria says kill that guy and it came to pass when the captains of the chariot saw jehoshaphat that they said it is the king of israel therefore they can pass about him to fight but jehoshaphat cried out and the lord helped him and god move them to depart from him now listen he's listened to lying prophets he's aligned himself with an unbelieving idolater and he's entered a battle that the spirit of god has said don't enter okay he ain't where he's supposed to be he's not fighting god's battle and yet what god takes him out i guarantee you there were some some close moments i guarantee you he didn't get out there without of a scratch i guarantee you a spear and arrow nicked him or cut him open a little bit or whatnot made him fear for his life but in the end he cried out to god and god was the one that had the last word why because jehoshaphat was his child joshua was a good man joshua was a king that god approved of and so when he cried out god says i'll pull you out of this amen i'll take care of you amen it's no different with us how many times can we say we've gotten ourselves into a mess i've got myself and many and what do you do you come to your senses like the prodigal son you say i really ought not to be here and i can't get myself out anymore i'm addicted i'm in too tight i'm too close i'm in this job i've moved whatever the case may be lord what can i do here and he says it's okay son your names are engraved in the palm of my hands your names are written in a lamb's book of life that cannot be erased it can't be blotted out have you ever thought about that it talks that it can't be erased which means it can't be taken out but guess what it can't be covered with something so your name is unreadable either it can't be blotted out by your mistakes can't be blotted out by your failures by by by your unwillingness to do what god asks you to do you can't be blotted out or erased in that in that lamb's book of life amen so what he comes behind and he says i'll get you out of this now they never won the battle and ahab lost his life but your husband got away with his skin but guess what i guarantee he lost some soldiers he lost some friends he lost some loved ones why because he got out of the will of god there's always a price to pay when you listen to the wrong word but the prophet of god who's pointing us in the quote we read earlier to the children of israel and what the word of god gave them and he's telling us there's a path that we want to be on amen and that's a path where the last word we hear is the word of god for our lives that when we hear the word of god that's where we stop and say i'm going to go now that's what i'm going to accept that's what i'm going to believe is true and i'm going to move on based on the last word i had and we don't let satan get in we don't let friends get in we don't get influence in we don't let our jobs get in but we say the word of god is yay amen and that's good enough for me and we just keep moving forward in it he says what giant stood up what happened to the giants annihilated he says they were small men in stature up against giants all of them were annihilated walled cities how do you knock down a walled city he took down jericho by by a miracle and now they got to knock down wild cities by what their own might little men with no tools and yet they did it three months six months to take them down sometimes but in the end they always got their city right it wasn't always miraculous remember brother brown says just a little bit of faith it'll take it down they just had to keep walking walking walking footsteps is possession the prophet of god said keep moving forward be relentless if the word is relentless be relentless to stick with it and then don't let it get ahead of you don't fall behind it and then stay really close to it why because god called them and god gave them a thus saith the lord that's what they were doing he said thus saith the lord go in and take the land i'll be with you i'll send hornets to drive them out it's the prophet what god was saying he says just follow me in just follow me in he says and i'll take care of you in there that's no different with us he says what it's the same thing for the bride you're called out the same way he says you're going to a millennium now he says and so everything that stands before you has to fall the exact same way as long as you're relentless to stick with that last word that he gives us prophet god puts it this way he says when god speaks to a man he has faith and he has ambition and he has a purpose when god speaks to a man he gives him a purpose so you don't come with a purpose you go away with a purpose when god speaks to a man he gives him ambition so you don't come with ambition you leave with ambition because so often i can say for myself you come with ambition and it doesn't go well because what you're not surrendered to his will you're coming in with your own thoughts you're coming in with your own ideas and so he can't work with that but if he can give you his ambition if he can give you his thoughts if he can give you his purpose then now you've got something to do he said when god speaks to a man he gives him faith to do it to accomplish or achieve what his purpose in life is and what god called him to do he's called us to be in the church of god and he says amen so what you're doing not to be by his faith by his ambition and by his purpose so whether you're a wife and a mother at home when you're a father and a husband that's out of work every day whether it's a young person at school whether it's a young person in the workforce each and everything that we're doing we're supposed to have a faith and ambition and a purpose behind it that god has led us there and we're there for a purpose because it's not always going to be you're going to get into battles but if you're there by his faith ambition and purpose then you know that it's got to fall before you that you'll make it through and it's going to do something for your good and not to your hurt amen brother bam saying that he wants you to live according to the word of god completely completely by faith ambition and purpose let's go back to isaiah again as we start to close this out he says so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth it shall not return to me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing where to i sent it now watch its effect it says for ye shall go out with joy so there's two things there's a leaving there's a going out and there's a joy that comes with the going out if we're sitting here and we're mourning what we've left behind something's wrong because we haven't caught a revelation we haven't caught a vision of what lays before us when israel left egypt there was no mourning when they left now later when they backslid they were they were mourning for the garlics and the leeks and the delicious food that they had while they were working the the pits and making bricks and building feral cities but when you're leaving there's joy he says and you'll be led forth with peace so there's a leading someplace else and peace goes with it it says and the mountains and the hills shall break forth with you before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree and instead of the briar shall come up the myrtle tree and it shall be to the lord for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off what's he saying are you saying you looked at this situation that you were in and you thought that out of this would come thorns and briars that the the horribleness the nastiness the difficulty of this situation was going to turn you into something that nobody could approach then it would be a person that was prickly standoffish grumpy mad angry disillusioned disappointed nobody wants to be around somebody like that he says what would have come out of this situation typically would be thorns and briars but he says out of it is going to come a fir tree and fur is prized for its strength and durability and construction solomon used it to overlay the temple fir trees it's a part of the building of god and this is what it looks like the biggest tree in the world is a fir tree he says so out of this situation that should have brought forth prickly people that are hurt and offended and want nothing to do with anything he says out of it comes the greatest tree on the living earth biggest tree in the world is the nook sack giant 465 feet tall can you imagine 46 and a half stories i think scotiabank is like 10 stories four times taller than scotiabank building downtown that's a tree out of the situation that looked completely hopeless comes a tree that was 465 feet tall why because there's a seed of god in there amen and a seed of god can't change it's got to come forth out of a situation that would normally destroy everyone else if there's a seed of god in there it's going to bring forth a child of god every single time and it's going to bring forth something that looks like a fir tree now i looked it up because of fir tree i was like why a fir tree why not something else there's lots of trees in the bible why a fir tree and i looked it up it says and these are the the attributes of a fir tree it says wood grain denotes stability if grain lines are straight and close together wood is strong and stable fur has tight close grain lines the software between the grain lines shrinks and expands making the wood cup or twist but it says fur has little soft green for stability and strength fur is much less prone to warping or twisting and much stronger in other words it's built word upon word line upon line here little there little it grows the grains are very tight together so there's not much in between that can warp and twist it says fur offers stability when used for decking or other exterior applications guess what god used it for in the temple exterior applications it was a cladding it says even though fur will shrink and expand as it absorbs moisture anybody that's built anything knows what happens with wood when it absorbs moisture not good right it says it always returns to the same shape so in a rugged environment in our newfoundland weather you put a piece of fur out there and you put it in a bunch of soaking hot rain we don't get hot rain soaking rain right what's going to happen is it's going to expand a little bit but as soon as that rain's done what happens it dries out and it goes right back to its original shape it doesn't warp and twist it doesn't let its environment define what it is it says this is a prized quality for builders and fur is so reliable that is it is even shipped cut and installed on homes while it is still green everything else you have to put it through a lumber kiln to dry it out or you have to let it sit out and age for a couple of years so it will dry out so that it's what it's in the shape that you can trust but they say fur you can put it in as soon as it's cut you can put it into a home and it won't warp or twist you can what rely on it it says when the first stabilizes it will take on the shape of wherever it is installed pine under the same circumstances will take our moisture swell and warp completely out of its original shape so out of this situation comes what a believer that won't twist that won't warp sure when things go through life what do we do we always get worked up a little bit we get moved a little bit but we always come back to what exactly what we were in the first place we don't go in straight and come out crooked we're going straight and we come out straight in between there might be a little bit of bow but we'll always come out to what we were in the first place amen what it can handle the storms of life and when it's fully cured when it's mature it will always hold the shape that god made it to be amen then it says that there's also a myrtle tree that comes out of this so instead of thorns you get a fur tree and then it says a myrtle tree instead of a briar what do briars do one briar is not a problem but when you get a bunch of briars what they do they grow together and they intertwine and you'll get your skin and clothes ripped off if you try to go through briars without cutting them away what one won't do the job but they always grow in groups and they come up and they go over a structure like brother aaron was showing us a lot of times briars will do that they'll close over a pathway or they'll grow up along the house and you can't go into it anymore because the briars block your way and you have to burn them or cut them but he says instead of something like that he says out of that a myrtle tree grows and i had to look up a myrtle tree because we got lots of myrtle trees we got crepe myrtles here right but the myrtle tree in israel is something different and it has four key attributes one is that it has evergreen leaves that keep it fresh all year round doesn't ever die down the life never leaves it it's always able to produce something the second thing is that it has flowers that blossom every year and give a beautiful fragrance it's full of oil year-round that has healing properties and it always lives near a water course where it can easily survive we're talking about the growth of a believer now out of these situations amen so out of an environment where you could expect somebody to put up great barriers to block access to their life to their heart he says out of that grows this thing that is always producing life that has a sweet fragrance every year that is full of oil that can heal and that always stays close to the flowing water of the word of god it knows where it needs to stay to have life amen that what when nothing is happening the way we think when our expectations falter beneath the weight of circumstances we know that out of those things god brings forth a people of great strength people full of the holy ghost tied to that fresh flowing word of god that's keeping them clean that's growing them and maturing them every single day of their lives amen and we can look back on our lives and see that we can look back and see situations where out of that came something good amen the great separation that brother mark and sister maureen and brother bob and sister brenda in particular had to do brother gerald has spoken over the pulpit of the troubles he's faced with his families you know and different loved ones issues at work things that we face things at school and men are young people and i've been a part of it you get you get harassed and you get made fun of for these things and so many in other situations if you were bullied and you were a child of the world guess what that many times would turn you inward and make you resent the god that makes you do the things that you do and the parents that make you live and dress the way that you do but out of it comes what holy ghost-filled children that can stand on their own two feet out of it comes pillars of the church that can help support us as we grow and as the second generation the third generation and if the lord tarries the fourth generation to come through this church where the holy ghost is still moving where revival still happens where you've got people that can still praise god that they can still show forth to the world that there's still a light to be had amen sometimes we get into troubling god takes us out but what happens when somebody we loves gets into trouble that's often hardest isn't it we know who we are we know who we are we know where our place is we know what our condition is and so it's a lot harder a lot easier to trust but when somebody else gets out there that's a lot harder isn't it because i can't help them the way i can go to god i can go to god but i don't know where their heart is i don't know where their where their relationship with god is sometimes you look at and say there is none and oftentimes there isn't but when somebody like that goes away when a family member slips away when a church member slips away what do we do then they're going into a situation all you see is briars and thorns coming out of it isn't it so many times do we look at that do we lose hope and faith do we start confessing they can't come back god can never rearrange the situation or do we go to the scripture says his word cannot return to him void they're a part of his word so it can't return to him void amen is anything too hard for the lord sometimes we're trying to have the last word and you know why that is because we're trying to make it about us and it's not about us i've said it before when you we look at the example remember when joshua and he's standing on the edge of the jordan and he sees a man drawing with the sword he says are you for us or against us and he says neither no he says but what i'm a captain for the host of the lord i'm for the word is what he was saying i'm for the lord if you're with the lord then that's great but i'm not with you you got to be with me and when we make it about us what we're saying is god is with us no no no what the question is is are you with god then it's about god and it's not about you and then he's got a place to work but if you make it all about you what's he going to do he's got nothing to respond to but if you make it about the word now he can respond to that because his word can never return void we'll mess up time and time again i return void all the time but the word in me never returns void and then it always brings out what it's supposed to do even when i'm getting in its way even when i'm bringing up thorns and briars out of it still comes a fir tree out of it still comes up murderly man so what is it when we make it about us then nothing can happen but when we say god listen you've got this this is about your word this is about your promise whether it's about your children whether it's about your marriage whether it's about your business you called me you placed me you gave me these things and so i'm just putting them back into your hands you've got it we'll let you handle it amen i'll shut up lord and i'll let your word speak for me i love what uh we heard in in in the tape i think in three kinds of believers i think that's what it was where brother brown says you confess what the word says he says and that's what you're looking for confess what the word says don't confess your thoughts don't confess your preference confess what the word says and that's where you can hang your hat on you can hang your life on it amen it's not about us it's about the word of god not returning void and the question is are you the word or are you not and if you are then it can't come back to god without doing what it's supposed to amen what do you say to moses stand still moses said stand still and see the salvation of god praise the lord god told moses what to do i read quotes there where brother bram says he has no voice but yours no hands but yours no feet but yours but you've got to speak what the word speaks then you can be expectant amen we heard this last sunday moses was a believer can you say i'm a believer this morning watch what a believer did though he tried intellectually he had tried every scheme he could but it wouldn't work he tried to take israel out know that he was called to do it he tried the mathematical way he tried the military way he tried the educational way he tried every way but it wouldn't work and then he took god's way what happened he says there was a fire on a bush up there one day that wouldn't leave he won't leave he's just waiting for you to get what a view there's something there that's doing what it doesn't normally do there's a fire there there's a light there that doesn't burn out i want to go see what that is he says and from there the word spoke to him and said i am not i was or i will be i am and he is still the i am he is the word the eternal everlasting word so when moses has tried all those things and when he came to god what did he let go of his thoughts and his ambition and his purpose because moses was thinking this is about me i'm the deliverer what did god say i have heard the voices of my children i have come down to deliver them not you moses moses you're the tool but it's not about you it's about me coming down to deliver now moses gets a new purpose he gets a new ambition and it is only to do what god tells him to do and all of a sudden he is the deliverer he was all along but he couldn't do it in his own way but once he catches that i am all of a sudden now he's got his ambition his purpose and he's got faith to do it brother brad says an old man scraggly beard flowing down the front of his chest with an old stick where you going moses i'm going to deliver israel where's your math education experience yeah we left that in the desert what do you have a stick and thus saith the lord beautiful good luck with that moses and he did it and god brought them out with a mighty hand amen we heard this again i really enjoyed that three kinds of believers tape i took four pages of notes on it i think he says but just remember god is always on the scene see he's right there ready at any time i want to read the last word for our lives this morning i want to encourage you this morning jeremiah 29 4 it says thus saith the lord of hosts the god of israel unto all that are carried away captives whom i have caused to be carried away from jerusalem into babylon bilgi houses and dwell on them and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them where jerusalem no babylon takey wives and beget sons and daughters and take wives for your sons and give your daughters to husbands that they may bear sons and daughters that ye may be increased there and not diminished so many times have you heard people say i don't want to bring a child into this world it's too horrible it's too black it's too bleak it's too weird it's too strange it's too corrupt i hear all sorts of people saying that i even hear believers saying that that's not what the word says he says when you're in babylon he says increase because there's a promise for you amen he says and seek the peace of the city whether i have caused you to be carried away captives and pray unto the lord for it for in the peace thereof you shall have peace he didn't say seek peace for jerusalem he said seek peace for babylon he says you are where you are because i allowed it don't give up hope but pray for peace while you're there because you're going to need it for thus saith the lord of hosts we want thus saith the lord here it is the god of israel let not your prophets and your diviners that be in the midst of you deceive you neither hearken to your dreams which you caused to be dreamed for they prophesy falsely unto you in my name i have not sent them saith the lord what was it everybody's saying you're going to get out you're going to get out you're going to get out get ready to go we're getting ready to go getting ready to go he says no no that's not it he says for thus saith the lord that after 70 years will be accomplished at babylon everyone wants to be the prophet with good news and so that's what they give good news good news we're going to get out trump's going to get the second presidency how many prophets prophesied that down the states every single one of them wrong and yet we'll still give them credence not us but other people will prophesied completely incorrectly and yet we're still listening to them out there messed up why because they gave the people what they wanted to hear he says don't listen to people that give you what you want to hear listen to people that give you what the word says amen he says for thus saith the lord after 70 years be accomplished at babylon i will visit you and perform my good word toward you in causing you to return to this place amen there's a time and there's a season for god's good word to go into action and he says you've got to wait 70 years for this but when it says it's time it's time and nothing's going to stop it for i know the thoughts that i think towards you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end i love this scripture it says unexpected ends that means there's something you can be an expectation of and be sure of because what his word will not return unto him void amen the thought of god expressed is his word and it leans to a definitive result god doesn't hide his intentions that's what i love about god he sits there and he says there's good things coming you've got pain on this earth you're gonna have to dwell in laodicea for a while you're gonna have to put up with all of the junk that's going on you're gonna have to have it rubbed in your face and you're gonna have to get it rubbed in your nose and you're gonna have to be turning your head every time you walk or drive down the street or go through a mall but he says after a while he says what something's going to happen and it's take you out of it and it's going to bring you back to the place that you came from it's going to take you back to your garden of eden amen he says then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you listen they were praying to get out we're praying to get out aren't we but we ain't going until he says it's time to go there's a place and there's a time to find for it and then and when that trumpet sounds that final trumpet that last word goes that last one's in then what does he say time to go he says then you're going to call on me that's why i believe brother joe's read this quote where he says a young you know a young boy or a young girl should be able to raise their hands and say lord i'm coming home that's the fulfillment of this where they say lord i'm coming home why you're calling on him to take you because there's an unction now that's greater than anything because you know you're in the rapture season and then the holy spirit drops down and we'll read a quote about it a little bit later where that holy spirit drops down it's going to take us completely off of this i think i've got it might be in the next service amen he says and you shall seek me and find me praise the lord we've been seeking a long time and we found him and we found him and we found him but we're going to find more and more and more of him aren't we when ye shall search for me with all your heart when you've heeded the voice when everything that's shaken has shaken off and then when you've dedicated your life your thoughts your time your money your effort to one thing and that's seeking the will and purpose of god in your life he says that's when you're going to find me and i will be found of you saith the lord and i will turn away your captivity and i will gather you from all the nations and from all the places where i have driven you saith the lord and i will bring you again unto the place once i caused you to be carried away captive an angel drove us out of eden another one's gonna drive us back as we've read that quote before him and what's taking you captive in your life this morning what have you lost what have we lost we've lost loved ones we've lost health we've lost joy we've lost peace we've lost patience the gifts of the holy spirit the fruit of the holy spirit is available to every believer you got the holy ghost there's nothing that you can't have from love joy peace patience kindness goodness faith gentleness and self-control none of that you have to put up with but then there's the blessings the redemptive blessings amen the healing the deliverance and all these different things amen everything is available this morning remember we preached that sermon we talked about he said i could go free right everything is free for the believer this morning the doors of captivity have been opened and we're on our way back we just haven't gotten there yet but we're looking for everyone that needs to go back to join in the caravan aren't we to get tied in to get joined up to get made part of our part of the body amen i've got family so far on left field now you think how can they even come back worst of the worst the craziest or the craziest guess what i was crazy just in my head listen uh someone away from god is someone away from god it doesn't matter if they're a million miles or one mile you're still out of god right the arm of the lord is not so short that he can't bring them back what are we doing what's our confession what is the last word that we're speaking in our prayers when we go to god right are we repeating his word back to them are we repeating the situation back to him i think too many times in prayer i share too much of what the situation is rather than what the word says the situation could be amen god's looking for people that will say one thing lord i believe you and i'll rest on your word i look at saul you talk about too far that the lord can't help you saul was on the road to damascus the antichrist spirit on him to persecute the true church of god and he hasn't he has a a moment with the pillar of fire listen sometimes we're wanting our kids to get into church saul didn't get into church saul was on his way to the bar right saul was on his his way to to fornicate saul was on his way to to to go to some crazy left-wing thing or right thing thing right-wing thing for that matter right you don't have to be in church for the holy spirit to drop down and touch you i remember the story of philip roncalli i think it was it might have been somebody else and his sister's in in a meeting at brother tim pruitt's there and she's in there and everyone's come up to the altar and they're praying for the loved ones and and she's up there and she's praying for him and he's back home and he thinks the rapture has happened and he runs i believe in his pajamas to church and get saved wasn't in church when that started but what happened there were people calling on the name of the lord that were confessing the word for the salvation of his soul and he came back and he's never left since we don't have to get him in church we have to get them in the presence of god and all they need is one moment with a burning bush experience and they'll change their life forever whether or not they're in this church amen that's what we're looking for as we start to close i want to read this one quote brother braham says if the church would come back and make god's word their ultimate make god's word their tie post that would do it but they're trying they're tying to a man-made achievement and it's bound to fail he says well the bible said they would do it but there is going to be a bride that's been elected since the foundation of the world that's going to be tied to that thai post i can see eternity break come down into time since eden and when it did there come a line of blood all the way up unto calvary and from calvary tied with this line and goes to the typhos jesus he says and someday when he comes to claim his own everyone that's tied to that ultimate will be raised up into eternity everyone amen not where they are now everyone that's tied everyone that's got that seed gene of god inside of them they're going up he says why they have been in eternity all the time they were predestinated in turn in eternity they are part of god they were in his thinking at the beginning and when that big rope is pulled of the line of the blood that token i was speaking of when it comes up from the earth everyone that was included in that blood will be dropped right up into eternity again but the only way it'll be will be tied to that absolute jesus christ he says it's absolute not an achievement of man but god raised him up from the dead and he is the absolute and we know he's alive because he is here with us in the power of his resurrection doing the same thing he did when he was here on earth he says i'm tied to the ultimate that's the end of all strife i'm tied to it that's my life i was a sinner when christ saved me i'm at something and since that came into me it's been different and i'm tied to it everything that i am is tied right there and then god's separating his life and let me live in him and him and me them were tied it doesn't make any difference what others want to believe to the individual you are tied to that that's your ultimate that's the last word he says and then if he is the word then this must be the last word that must settle it whatever that says that's that scarlet thread that is christ and anything contrary to that i know nothing about it can you say this morning i'll know nothing about it i won't feed on it i won't look at it i won't confess it i won't talk about it i'll know nothing about it that's what we want to know is what the word says for i am tied to christ and christ is the word he says you get it now and the portion of his word that's allotted for this day his holy spirit is here to manifest that portion of word amen what does the last word bring he says it brings the end of all strife it's the end of all worrying it's the end of all wondering it's the end of all fighting it's the end of all struggling how many times did god yank david out of trouble how many times did saul had the complete mountain surrounded no way out and god comes and he sends a messenger says there's a battle here there's a problem here and saul has to run away david's pinned in a cave and god saves him time and time again what is it david didn't even have to fight david didn't even have to lift up a weapon against saul all his life and the one time he did he repented of it all he did was cut the hem of his garment the skirt of his garment the only time he did it was when he was goaded into it by somebody every other battle david didn't have to fight against his own people god kept taking them away and away and away he wouldn't get him to raise a sword against them how many times did he do the miraculous for israel they need water they need food they need shelter they need light whatever it is cloud by day a pillar of fire by night he brings quails he brings mana he brings water every time they needed it he was there for it what is this the end of struggling and strife that doesn't mean you're not going to battle we'll always have that till we take a rapture but the struggling so many times is because we think we're going to lose we think that it's our fighting that's going to make us win no we fight because there is somebody arrayed against us but the battle is the lord's not ours he's the one that's fighting amen remember where he we we the the quote was there in the three kinds of believers about david where he says that that david threw the rock but god directed it you're the hands and feet but it's god that brings the result it's god that does the work you might be the hands and feet but it's god that's giving the effect that we need in our lives amen peter's in prison they're having a prayer meeting over there and they're praying get prison get peter out of prison and what happens the angel of the lord comes in and he takes peter right out of prison like that goes to the door and wrote answers and she says who's there peter she runs up and says peter's ghost is at the door that's how quickly god answered prayer amen amen but it was a work of his not a work of peters they're just trusting and god makes a way because it wasn't peter's time to go struggling because we think it's up to us and struggling because we think our efforts make the difference we've got to fight resist the devil and he'll flee from you but the effect is the lord's it's not ours amen i can't make it happen and that's why i struggle so often is because i think i can make it happen no i'll fight to hold to the word and i'll let the word take care of the situation amen amen if we can all stand and the musicians come we have a part to play but the reason we make it is not of our own efforts it's because his word won't return to us void amen his word has gone forth he said he'll have a spotless bride he said there's going to be an overcomer in this age he said there's going to be people that will search them with all their heart and soul and strength amen amen that's why we're at the end of all strife it's because the word's gone out we can't lose you can't lose and guess what he can't lose a 1. he told the disciples he says i won't lose a single one that the father has given me so no matter where you're at where your loved ones are at where your co-workers are at where your neighbors are at what situation you're in it doesn't matter if the word has said it's going to come through and the word has said that he says my thoughts to you are for what good not of evil he wants to bring us to a place where his thoughts are going to achieve good but you got to get back to his word you got to stand under that umbrella so that you can be blessed by it because outside of that umbrella there's only judgment amen he wants us to draw closer to him amen amen let's bow our heads heavenly father lord you've given us a wonderful word for our day lord and we just read a quote where your prophet said that there's a word allotted and it's going to be manifested and lord we want to be manifested sons and daughters of god lord if there's anything we want lord it's to produce what the word says we would produce lord but it's not in our trying that's going to make it happen lord it's not in our doing that's going to make it happen lord but it's because your word said that it was going to happen that we can have a confidence and a trust that as we move forward lord the process is going to work amen and lord so we pray that we put our ourselves completely into your hands lord that we would let go of the steering wheel lord that we'd let go of the situations lord that we get rid of the strivings lord that we get out of the battles lord that we've got ourselves into lord and that we seek lord to find your will and your way in our lives each one lord that our purpose our faith our ambition lord will be what you've given us through your word for each one of us individually we pray lord we ask your grace for us each one this this afternoon lord remember that sister solas especially lord god and her husband i believe brother michael lord we pray your tremendous mercy and grace your healing touch heavenly father lord we've seen great miracles of healing in the
