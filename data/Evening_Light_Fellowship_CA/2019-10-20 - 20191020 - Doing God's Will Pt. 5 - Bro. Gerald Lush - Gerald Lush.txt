acceptable in his presence amen because it's in the heart praise the Lord turn with me to st. Mark's Gospel chapter three st. Mark's Gospel chapter three being prayers the Lord willing our brother Mark would minister on Wednesday night amen the grace of God be with us and also the Lord willing I was hoping to be able to try to finish these thoughts concerning the will of God and doing God a service but the majority today is not doing it according to his will that's the truth there's many doing God a service but not according to his will so brother there's going to going to be a few found doing the will of God according to the will of God a man by the grace of God and brothers so grace to us I pray and see it's it's getting to the place we know what's getting worse well he said if you didn't shorten time there'd be no flesh say well brother that means it's pretty bad spiritually it is so for the elects sake he was short in time so for your sake for my sake your shortened time thank God for that amen why because of the spirits and then that are influencing the people physically and religiously and spiritually upon the but they're so deceived a man so the grace of God be with us brother and I turn to this as I mentioned to our brother John and I know maybe it'll it's striking to to even our brother Joshua I guess or any any brother from Africa I said you know I said one time the probably God said there might be a dozen not ever come out of Africa and he was referring of course to the branch of the rapture and that would be the living Saints well well brother no no not gonna be that few is it oh yeah and I thought and some I think sister Betty said there's only a dozen out of Africa she said there won't be no one she said from the Western world and and I said yes I said that's true so it's getting that bad like if Jesus said to be no flesh saved how bad is it spiritually I'm deceiving is it sir brother and and even even to the message of the hour you know and oh my because again I've been thinking about it Lord how much longer much longer and the Lord showed me again within the last couple of days concerning another thought in the Word of God he says son he said for you it's for over fifty years but he said for me it's not very long it's only a few hours and then and I saw I said that's right Lord I said because one day one year with the Lord is one day as a thousand years a thousand years as one day and when it comes to with God we're looking at fifty years we look at a thousand years but God we look at one day a man and so we've gone for almost six days and again but the seventh seventh day which is again a seventh it's going to be the the be the millennial reign a man we're going to sit with him in his strong but again let's understand God's timing not ours a man for us we're in time we're subject to time and that's why that 50 odd years will seem like a long time but in the eyes of God it's not a man it's just for a few minutes I would say in in so let let's out let's be on our guard this be on our toes let's brother be instant in season out of season be spiritual amen if there's anything the Prophet is bringing out concerning doing God with a service without his will is having the anointing he said but it's not having the anointing where you ought to have and that's in your heart a man if you got it in your flesh but he said you don't have it in your heart a man let's make sure it's in our hearts let's make sure it's in ourselves because God is working on the end so where's the new creature the new crew not outside the new creatures inside a man the old this is the old creature born in sin a man is under the curse but God God made us new creatures in Christ were born again a man on the inside of the inside that's where the new nature is amen this is where God is is revealing his word this is where God is dealing with you dealing with me it's in our hearts and in our souls a man and then brother he to reflect out into our flesh and and is fighting your flesh a man sure you're fighting your flesh I know you are a man we're all fighting the flesh we're fighting this weakness of the flesh that weakness of the flesh but God has give us the strength we need to overcome a man help us to be more than conquerors in our Lord Jesus Christ amen so brother god help us and give us the grace we need in especially in this hour a man in this why this hour because it's more deceiving in this hour than any other age god help us amen let's believe make sure that when we're doing God a service do it according to his will a man oh but I got to the anointing that's right you can have the anointing but still it's in your flesh is it in your soul you got to come out and you got to live out of the soul there's too many living out of their flesh a man as they're proud of God said you're in the message but it's just a message in you amen that's the important thing there's a lot in the message a man around the world there's a lot in the message maybe even in Africa Amen a lot of the men message in the Western world but the message is not in depth definitely not I know that by their attitudes I know that by their motives and objectives amen amen as we went into the messages on all right yeah are you seeing it the way God sees that hearing it the way God hears a man a man that's in the soul but a lot of them are hearing it in their heads with their natural ears but not to hear of the soul amen god help us brother in the be in the spirit walk in the spirit live in the spirit amen sons and daughters of God walk in the spirit they live in the spirit amen and and they're really truly adopted a man not not outwardly inwardly a man I'm a son of God you're a son of God you're a daughter of God a man on the inside he meant by the grace of God God help us to get the revelation as we go a little further into the word amen in running my st. Mark's Gospel chapter three and verse 31 and to speak of the new relationship and it says there came then his brethren and his mother and standing without sent unto him calling him and the multitude sat about him and they said unto Him behold thy mother and thy brethren without seek thee and he answered them saying who is my mother or my brethren and he looked round about on them which sent about him and said Behold my mother and my brethren and brother we know that his natural family those that identified him they were they weren't really physically connected to him but but because they were born of Mary or someone that maybe others had Joseph might have had before he married Mary and so on but they were jealous a man they were certainly jealous of what Jesus was doing there and doing their and doing their but he wasn't doing her where they were and Annie and he rebuked them for their unbelief he reviewed them for their doubt and now he's rebuking their relationship or their claim and he looked around about on them which sat about him and said Behold my mother and my brethren for oh so ever shall do the will of God the same is my brother and my sister and mother a man so am i ministering to his brother his sister and his mother a man they that hear the word of God and the will of God and they that do the will of God Amen god bless his words you may be seated amen it's not doing the letter of the word it's doing the screen of the word so it's not you then it's God in you it is Christ in you it is his nature in you amen you're not doing that you're not doing certain things in your physical being because well well my mother did this my grandfather did is my grandmother and grandmot father would like that so I'm gonna do do what they would do I'm gonna do it the way that they would do it no no a man it's in your nature they cut because it's and you were born with it but as it is in the natural sodas in the spiritual you're born with a physical nature and you go ahead and live that but then God gives you the new birth and you're born with a spiritual nature a man a man and it's not the nature of mom and dad it's the nature of your heavenly Father it's the nature of your heavenly mother's the nature of your heavenly sister is the nature of your heavenly brother even our Lord Jesus Christ amen so now you know what why do you go after when your repent and you're born again on the inside in your soul well how did you you good and you live this way you live that way and they're all oh is the nature of my father a man my Heavenly Father amen because now you're going to do things that your natural father wouldn't do they're gonna do things that your natural mother wouldn't do you didn't get that nature from from her from him you got it from your heavenly Father amen praise the name of the Lord so what nature's got control of you while Nature has got control of me control now I'm not saying influencing you but of controlling you a man if you are born again the new nature takes control a man and it's there to control the old nature it's not that it's not going to break the old Nature has gone out of your soul the old nature is moving away from your spirit amen because the new nature is going forward to control the old nature in your flesh amen by the grace of Almighty God praise the Lord brother this is wonderful I pray God Amen that we've got the back they experience a man and we've got a new nature on the inside of the inside alleluiah they're the old nature was put out and the devil the devil oh yeah he was he was controlling us from the soul he was controlling our spirit is controlling our flesh a man but brother when we were born again and the Holy Ghost came in even he was kicked out a man he was no longer on the throne crisis on the throne of your heart a man a man it is Jesus now in controlling you're a new creature in Christ you've got a new power and new anointing you got a new nature a man it is the nature of God in you a man and then and without is it gonna change me it's going it's gonna reach out to your spirit a man and I read now there's not just your flesh brother it's got to come from the inside of the inside and most definitely a man there's tremendous republic god said you got the annoy me and you got the Holy Ghost in your flesh but you don't have it in your heart and issue you can grow this and do this and do that and say that I believe this and I believe that but he said it's in your head not in your heart it's in your physical being but not in your spiritual mean and annual word where are they going they're going to hell a man they're going to hell they're not going to make it in the glory that's why you've got to be born again by the grace of Almighty God amen so you got the new nature on the inside and what's he doing he's on the throne of your heart now he's on the throne of your soul now and he's the one that could that reigns over your life amen you're giving him control you're listening to him now amen and brother what does he do he'll go out and control your spirit a man bry praise the name of the Lord Alleluia and then he's going out to control their your flesh because the devil says seat as it were as why he said it's your mind yesterday was watchtowers your mind God's watchtowers your soul amen and the devil is in your mind working on the senses of your flesh and trying to get into your citta senses of your spirit to control the your soul a man by the old brother when he gets down to your spear he meets the Holy Spirit hallelujah not in your flesh but it's the Holy Spirit it is God in His Christ in you the hope it is Christ in me the hope of glory amen hallelujah so now the devil is fighting and fighting and then God by the Holy Ghost was in your heart and he and he's fighting a man with the word it is written it is written it is written a man praise the name is the word all brother don't go by your emotions and your feelings has got to be the word you could have emotions who could have Feeny but that's not going to help you you've got to have the word it's got to be based on the word and you come out and say oh it is written and the devil is coming down with us with it with his mind and he and the saint trying to get into the sense of your flesh the old man the old nature and brother than AE after a while there and may he make this God might let him go in a little further and little further but after a while hall he strikes eternal life hey say hey man and he strikes the Holy Ghost what's going on here Amen boy because when he was in there he was controlling everything but now there's another power another anointing in there Amen hallelujah and then the devil is a hundred percent unbelief and this is a hundred percent belief faith perfect perfect faith a man and any striking that when they they meet in your spirit oh yeah the father God said the enemy who work in your flesh and he's moving down to your spirit to try to get you to to do this and do that do that you know just to sin and sin and sin do they were just country to the Word of God contrary to the to the new birth a man but after a while he gets down so far he strikes the new birth hey mate and the Holy Ghost is there and the Holy Ghost comes back and says it is written see it is written see a man and he'll give you the victory and what does it do Satan moves back to your mind a man he moved back to your - the sense of your flesh a man but you're gonna believe it is written a man and yet anybody you'll stay there and they keep working on your flesh a man under under maybe after a while you'll get you a yo real recognize this weakness in you and that weakness in he's working on you God is working on your from the inside out the devil is working on there from the outside in oh yeah he'll work on it that finally is you got the victory over that so you start working on something else oh that's the truth he's not he's not gonna give up no no no until I will receive a glorified body like is glorified body like in like God's - Jesus glorious glorious body amen then the devil got no authority in our minds he got no authority in our flesh he got nothing hey man and he he knows his tiny short he knows his time is short because he knows why God is doing in your soul he do to our glory amen he knows his time is short that is this is not just he's not just dealing with the the revelation of justification sanctification or the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the gifts no he's dealing with the revelation of the resurrection and the rapture and that's why he knows his time he's short a man praise the Lord and the other agents eat up with this he dealt with that he dealt with this revelation but a man but now he knows he's getting into a greater and a greater revelation of God and it's the resurrection and the rapture that's what brother that's why he knows his time is short Oh resurrection rapture because he saw what happened in the Old Testament and at a climax with the resurrection and rapture of the Old Testament Saints through our Lord Jesus Christ the error for ministry and now he sees it in the Omega ministry praise the Lord hallelujah brother I pray God that we're going to see the word father in a greater way to know what the devil have seen us hey man we got a wreck if the Satan is recognizing that brother how much want we are to recognize it they were born again a mass was Satan to see that brother he and he knows that they're not just talking about justification and and they're going oh I'm justified unjustified Satan is still using their flesh cousin even our brother Martin Luther brother he went and he and he got the revelation of trust with the yeah I'm justified I'm justified in Joseph I thank God and he went on he's straight and he smoked a pipe yeah he would only do this when only there but he was but it was no clear knowing no condemnation no conviction because he was justified hey man he got a power over the devil's conviction Amen the day the devil tried to put him down and he was playing and God was lifting him up hey man that's right Satan is putting you down and with this putting you down with that any of hoosier of this accuser of that and along comes the Holy Spirit listen your point us to Jesus hey man you're you're more than a conqueror in the Lord Jesus Christ hey man he paid the price for your sin don't let the devil condemn you amen hey man our faith is in the finished work of Calvary he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities amen the chastisement of our peace was upon him hey man praise the Lord it's all it's all the finish work by the grace of God ain't man and God help us to believe it and he said with His stripes we are healed amen and brother dead oh yeah well I'm healed so I was sick but now I'm eel well as our sister Cardella here believing it with his stripes she was healed hey man and maybe her brother Chad and praying great grace to sister Betty with his stripes she was healed amen but brother God wants us to believe for a greater healing a man not just a changer not just a physical healing in our body

we all have we ought to be able to claim it now brother in this hour because we're going beyond Lutheran Wesley and the Pentecostals because now brother God was doing this God was doing that God did that to us God did that for us amen but then he brings us into an absolute physical change hey man he gave us a spiritual revelation that were justified by faith he gave us a spiritual revelation were sanctified by faith he gave us a spiritual revelation of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit but we were still experiencing old age hey man we're experiencing getting older getting older and getting older amen but then we could any all glory but what God has done and what God is doing no brother is challenging aging a man we're going away I'm justified thank you lord I'm sanctified yes my son amen I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and access to the gifts of the Spirit that's good my son but now I'm gonna take you where you don't want you won't need none of that hey man you're going beyond that revelation you're going beyond this revelation of that revelation you're going to get in you're gonna get into it in a dimension a man we're brothers sister it's not all thank God for this revelation thank God for that revelation it's just it's just it eternal understanding is an eternal knowledge a man is not something you got is something you are hey man there's no past there's no future it's all present hey man you're now looking to the future to think of a future what suture you get into heaven well it was suture don't know Oh what was the past don't know past well sure I don't know nothing but past I don't know any future it's just all now it's all present amen see that's like that's why Jesus was experiencing it when he was here a man in the Alpha ministry now the Omega ministry has given the bride that revelation amen so we're going beyond the past and future we're getting into present tense it's what God has done there's too many even around the message it's past tense what God did no know what has got what has God done what is God doing amen by the grace of God and that's why the devil knows his time is short because why he sees and knows what God is doing in the elect he sees that he knows what God is doing in the Bride of Christ he knows now that God did this God did that God did that and he was right there to challenge that faith the challenge what God was doing amen and that's why he made a denomination of it yo he made a denomination of this hell is that now that a man he got them he seemed a man not the elect but the Prophet aghast ER that third or fourth generation he said that's what that's what denominated Methodists denominated the Lutheran's denominated the Pentecostals amen and it's a third or fourth generation on this message that's they started in to make denominations amen oh I believe this I believe this I believe that amen brother you what you believe you live hey man it's not there's not basing your life on the past it's the present tense amen what it's not what God did it's what God is doing seats he's doing it in need he's turning in you amen praise the Lord the devil knows that hey man he knows what he's doing and now they're gone beyond justification what are they and into now Oh what about the Pentecost the baptism of the holy ghost a gift sister what are they into now they're gone beyond that Oh Satan comes down resurrection he came down with great wrath attacking Jesus they offer ministry all mine that temptation you talk about the Mount of temptation oh praise the Lord anybody but now he's come down again that was Jesus in the flesh there it's Jesus in flesh of his bright amen he knew what Jesus was gonna do then old brothers sister and that's why he's tempted Jesus tempting Jesus amen and he's tempting the bride with this tempting the bride with that and he said oh they go go through there that day that temptation how he tempted Jesus back there in the air of a ministry and he's tempting the bride in the Omega ministry oh he said listen he said he said just speak the word and and do this and do that but you got a brother Brown says you speak the word make sure it's the will of God see you can do God a service without his will but you got it can be done according to his will amen so the enemy is rare to get us to do this get us to do that oh yeah he tempted always so listen you don't have to worry about that he said I'll give you this I'll give you that I'll bless you with this and I'll bless you with that just come follow me oh yeah but God has promised he's gonna we're gonna narrow to all things and Jesus rebuked the devil and he knew he was gonna hear it all things he was good he was gonna be he was gonna be a king of kings and Lord of lords hey man and the devil was tempting in the goal this way but Jesus knew that he had to go the other way the sacrifice he had the sacrifice he had to do this he had to lay down his life and Amy and he rebuked the devil and he knew he's going to inherit it Satan wants us to go the easy way hey man he's telling us in our fresh that we don't have to take this stand we don't have to stay so separated Amen from family and friends and neighbors and all that listen not my real father time to be done hey man Jesus fought with it and fought with it and thought with it over here did the devil but brother he was fighting with this and fighting with that as he went on to do his ministry under finally he said not my will dying be done and brother de bride's gonna come to that great separation Jesus was coming to that separation Jesus was moving ahead of the 1st or 2nd pool of Israel of his ministry Amen so that there was fewer and fewer signs and wonders amen why is getting into the the climax as same with the bride we're moving away from signs and wonders and all that we're getting into the climax of the revealed word the climax whether going beyond justification sanctification going beyond the van Chisolm of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit brother they're still there's the prophecy they're on the shelf he's if you need them yeah but we're going now the devil is recognizing now what are we going into now what's the revelation what are we talking about what are we believing the resurrection and the rapture amen and he knows is time is short brother do we know our time is short amen do we know that we have come to the end of all things yeah by the grace of God amen that we are about to witness the change from time to return - hey man - brother listen I pray god I pray we believe the word more than we're believed in science I play we're believed in the word there's a lot of talk about the climate change a man and they want governments to get involved with this and get involved with that they want government to acknowledge climate change - and knowledge this and knowledge that sure what what are they gonna do they can't change it amen a lot of science we believe that it's a sign you know we're saying to them it's a sign that we're a in the end and then the earth is going to be destroyed the earth there's not gonna be livable anymore amen God is bringing us to that place cuz he said I'm gonna I'm gonna create a new heaven and a new earth hey man and the part of God sir what did what do you mean he's going to have a new heaven a new earth and he said as you're born again he said the earth is gonna be born again and the evidence gonna be born again a man and he said all sin is going to be gone and he said that's why he talked about it he said God is going to take the earth and he says gonna throw it into the Sun yeah and he said it'll burn amen this is of course this would be after the truth the Great Tribulation and so on or the tribulation and the millennial reign and he's gonna do that amen there's gonna burn it burn it why he's a sadist burned he said from the inside out hey man so he said there's absolutely nothing of sin remaining on the earth hey man and that's why then he starts with you on the inside so why cuz there's so there's no going to be no sin amen he starts on the inside not just the outside no then sin is still in sight no no he starts on the inside a man because we were born in sin and with that nature a man on the inside of the inside but he starts there and he changes it and he's changing you from yours your soul your spirit until finally change your body hallelujah hallelujah hey man no wonder the devil knows his time is short please understand he knows his time is short by looking at what God's doing in you and what God is doing sure you a man he knew that he knew what was going to happen 2,000 years ago by God was doing in Christ hey man and he watched Jesus he watched his ministry hey man he watched Jesus Spirit and Jesus attitude in what Jesus was doing hey man he knew yeah he was right there brother and he ain't no doubt he was he was glad he was the one of the those that rejoicing when Jesus laid down his life yeah but it struck him when the Jesus raised it up again there man praise the Lord and brother ye and the enemy is rejoicing because of all they are gone the denomination denomination that would dare with God did in Luther it's all denominated as roolewd and Wesley all denominated and in all the others is all denomination and many around the message are just like denominations they got denomination or spirits amen we need to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so we're hungry and like Jesus we're hungry and thirsty not my real father time be done a man is coming to that place rather you got to make the church you got made the decision amen the devil is there trying to get you to compromise oh yeah he wants you to compromise with family compromise his friends come right listen if they want to walk away that's up to them you won't walk away you don't have to know no they'll walk away but as long as you're taking your stand amen that's not all will because the brother God referred to it they in the end he said the bride there's gonna be friends of the bride hallelujah amen they're gonna be friends of the bride oh yeah because when the bride goes through this suffering and it's gonna endure this and endure that oh yeah I and not competed now you want you want the bride won't be killed but they said she'll stay here and our faith is gonna be tested oh yeah when when when they put the pressure upon the bride put the pressure up on the leg stop doing this stop preaching this don't do this and so on Amen the pressure is gonna be there amen oh yeah then there's gonna be those friends that be there to encourage you and to defend you oh yeah but then but are you going to still stay with it the truth still be believe for the rapture still believe for the resurrection amen yeah that after after you've tested the brightest brights faith is coming out brother Luther's faith came out why he stood there and they challenged him and they threatened about killing him and he said here I stand he said I could do no other he said god be with a man and God was with him amen and the Methodists the same thing Pentecost was the same thing here we stand we can do know others who were made fun of the Pentecostals all didn't they mock mock them but it was a great revival that went around the world amen now finally now God has gone into a brother a bride revival and what is the bribery Bible resurrection and rapturing day amen they had faith for that in their day now what are you a faithful what's what faith is God looking for in me well faith is God looking for you I'll tell you this brother hates resurrection and rap shrinking oh brother Lord I believe Luther I believe this one that when I believe the Pentecostal and all that yeah but what else do you believe well I believe you sent a prophet Lord you reveal the mystery yeah but what is the mystery doing for you is it in your flesh or is it in your heart if the mystery is in your heart I'll tell you what it's doing what has given you the faith that is giving you is rapturing thing the bubbler Gossard the third pole is giving the bride rapturing faith so what's God looking for in me and in you he took a rap repay ya brother I pray grace god help us like I said that were dead the Lord is not gonna turn around and go and find just like the disciples see what Jesus coming to the end of his ministry after all they saw all they heard not only that the anointing that Jesus gave them and they went out and healed the sick they went out they raised the dead they went out and did this signs and wonders they came back and gave her and gave their poor report to Jesus and now here's Jesus come to the end of his ministry and they're and they're sleepy there don't be where's their zeal where's your enthusiasm where's the revival spirit Oh probably God brings that out in these messages or a year he said always said I remember I not be like oh I might have a copy of that that paper that magazine that brother Brown refers to I don't doubt it all but I do have a copy of it and it was a paper that the all Full Gospel business mentor somebody used to put out back years ago and and they had dad it down did right at the top oh my pray for revival yeah brother Brown said oh I remember that I guess I I don't doubt at all but I got I still got that paper and probably God referenced it I said yeah I remember that and he said but he said no revivals over W Bible that they're looking for know should now we're in a bribery bite and what is the revival now now it was it now he said it's not that he said okay I'll get the exact words eventually but as he said it's not bad no no no now I said he said God God is finished now now it's this godless cross looking for this he-man do you believe this do you believe this he said so he said they've missed every Bible and they did amen they record they were going from that that person's second pull revival into the third pull revival all they they loved the first and second pull but they didn't like the third that was why it was that was based on the word a man the first and second pull revival that was me so strangely wonders Oh hallelujah praise the Lord Amen God is doing this God is doing that yeah but what about when God was saying this and saying that when God was revealing this mystery in this mystery in this mystery and God was pointing not just a natural healing of your body but this change of your body the resurrection and the rapture hallelujah how many are praising God and worshiping God thank you Lord for the revelation of the resurrection thank you for the revelation of the rapture Lord I feel I'm being pulled up Amen I'm on the way toward a carven coming home hey man praise the name of the Lord oh I pray God as I said that will that we've come to that place where Jesus said oh I'm no more in the world what Lord what do you say I'm no more in the world brother he was not going physically he's gonna base me hey man why caught under him not a man because brother he was closer to Eternity then he watched the time hey man after threads after three and a half years of ministry a man he knew he was approaching the third pull of his ministry and the third pull was at a time into eternity that's why he could say I have no more in the world a man and you're saying again Olu you hallelujah God give us this revelation brother in our hurts a man he said he said no man has ascended up only he that came down even the Son of man who is what they didn't understand he the son a man who is what do you mean Lord who is your here no he was there a man then what the it was more real to him there than here a man eternity was more real than time hey Mary right because time was passing away but eternity was getting closer and more real he was getting him more Melania he was getting more and more in contact with eternity than he was more cut out with the eternal things than those things in time he was living for eternity not living for time a man and he knew what he had to get back that's why he went to get so many and wept and cried and so on knowing what he had to endure for you now brothers sisters not understand that it wasn't just for he wasn't doing it for himself he was doing it for you he was doing it for me he was darling for all the elect of God he was doing it for all the sons and daughters of God I bore all of our see for all of us just thinking what he endured we think we we know what's a burden for me to do this burden for me to do that well why would the burden to Jesus bore for millions to get back he had to do this he paid the price for all of our sins and yet believers are not willing to suffer a little here a little there not really doing do her this now willing to endure that now willing to do without this and do without that no no I don't think the Lord wants me to do this I don't think that well but how many is gonna stop and say Lord not my will die and be done no they're gonna fight with God I'll tell God chain Oh God has changed change this change this so here change it but they'll go to hell they're condemning themselves they're judging themselves you know but I pray grace that we're like Jesus I am no more in the world I'll tell you that what brother if we're if we're really into the revelation and we're really into the word if we're really into what God is doing we're no more in the world amen we're more in contact with eternity and the resurrection and the rapture than we are with time amen and we're going to get more and more into fellowship with those that are gone on hey man those that are waiting on us there was dead in Christ oh my you're gonna you're gonna love them probably God said listen he said he believed he said that just before a person died naturally he said you're gonna start feeling for those that are going on oh yeah he says you you'll start to all you start thinking about them you can't get it we can't get it get it away from you your your thoughts your mind or whatever now tear this brother when the bride gets close to the rapture all you're gonna be thinking about is st. gana Oh soon be fellowshiping with sister coffee again mr. donford amen so we fellowship with aunt sadie praise the Lord she won't be 99 she be maybe 19 a man and as Nelson with this brothers his sister so on but how many I wonder a really living port I mean I really hungry for how many a thirsting for time II feel that that is it's it's getting closer well the devil has come down with great wrath he say - he's seeing it in somebody oh yeah he was he was there with Jesus to destroy Jesus and his ministry you know no wonder he made the disciples go to sleep yeah they weren't getting into the revelation but they would just as I said our brother George Smith brought it all out of them but the ones that God uses the Paul like I said Paul the one that create fight not course of like wait so yes I'm do some did but it killed Christians he killed Christians and he was the one that God used as the messenger of the age yeah he was on his way he was on his way the kid too quick to condemn the Christians and maybe to have some Christians kill and when all of a sudden he looked up and there was the pillar Fire Lord well he wasn't depending on your choice or mark my choice it was his choice hey may we look at the outside God looked at the heart what Lord you chose him yeah God must have seen something in his heart amen they got really appreciate from the foundation of the world amen and he chose Paul what messenger Lord he with me he killed Christians yeah but he was gonna lay down his life as Jesus laid down his well it got God's ways are not our ways hey man hi and again like I said would choose Peter God ed Jesus had more problems with Peters and he had with any of the disciples cuz Peter always questioned this and questioned that wanted to go this one about that don't do this don't do that yeah the other disciples never interfere not even Judas you don't hear anything about Judas and not only that look at the spirit and attitude Jesus and toward Jews when Judas came and betrayed him Oh Judas that devil get out of here no Jesus at a rate attitude or a spirit even when Judas went open and kissed him on the cheek and he says you'd betray you know the Son of God with a with a kiss so on and and he stopped deep Peter when they were resting on Peter grab that sword cut off one of the servants ears Jesus I put that sword up don't do that see see what your attitude you gotta be see what added to a gospel see the spirit that God's looking for you see the action and the reaction that God's looking for oh no wonder he says Strait is the gate narrow is the way and few there be that find it God help us by grace father sister miss what God's doing let us if Satan is recognizing his time is short but not knowing where he's going he's going to hell he be cast into the lake of fire amen and they're not eternal he shall have his time in the lake of fire brother and if he's recognizing that how much is the bride recognizing the resurrection in the rapture he's getting closer to his in but the bride should be getting closer to her eternity by the grace of God grace sorry turn with me to Hebrews 10 thank God for the word amen Hebrews chapter 10 again I thought I'd come out and just stick to some quotes in the book but the Lord had other quotes amen praise the Lord in Hebrews chapter 10 and verse 35 let's go to Thursday 34 4 he had compassion on me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that you have in heaven a better and an enduring substance a man see through the anointing and through the new birth your your feelings and everything emphasis is not on natural things it sounds spiritual you just well thank the Lord that's gonna pass away but I thank you for blessing me with it or I won't worship it I want Papa too much emphasis on it Lord I'll keep I'll keep focusing on the spiritual amen praise the Lord for in heaven you have it a better and an enduring substance cast

daughter of God amen praise the Lord now it's now God can use you now it's God speaking through you it's God acting and reacting through you a man you're reflecting Jesus hallelujah reflecting deity

God I pray God don't lose that revelation that have become more real that I'm a god and if you are a god brother you can't stay in time if you're a god well you could say what Jesus said no man has ascended up only he that came down even me and you who isn't it Jesus was there you and I are there amen because he came down to redeem those that were there in theophany form yeah your staff need right there now it's come to take you home amen is there in the earth theophany is there to convict you guide you to lead you but one day one day you're gonna drop this robe of flesh I'll drop and

have done the will of God after you've done the will of God let's get it in order after you've done the will of God you need patience that you might receive the promise amen praise the Lord God Tara's gonna take patience again as I said I when I'm in a we prayed the tape on Sunday last Sunday and I quoted that from the book there concerning tension and the Prophet God said the Christian life is a life of tension oh yeah he said because why you're lining up with this we're on a break do this you got stave with this stay with that no yes correct this correct that and so on tension and then that was Sunday by Sunday and then on a Monday I went into my as I said told her somebody here went to my brother's house in Paradise there and he put on a I think was connected his TV I guess to YouTube and and he put it brought up a Salvation Army service a service that he attended in CBS not far from here a service that he attended and it was on YouTube and they were singing and praising the Lord and worshiping and then the the clergy I don't know not sure of his name he got up to minister and well Wow I shall or I should we preach the same thing I preach for our are an if' but he was only here for a half hour so an area's ministry ministry on a scripture concerning what God said to be thankful for everything you see what he said you get that your areas ministering on it he said for all thing you know be thankful for all things and I thank the Lord for this thing that he said what we thank the Lord for be thankful and he said for what he said he for even he said the hard times he didn't use the word tension but he is using the other words that meant the same thing he said we think he said all the Christian life is a leg or gonna be easy this is easy that's easy no we said you're going to experience negative things you're going to experience positive things you're going to experience battles and and and and then and and victory but it's a victory comes after the battle yeah so he said just think he says to many he said think that the Christian life is an easy life the Christian life is always just all this and all good things and all good thing nothing negative nothing you know heard or don't know no fighting there's something like that but he said we're we're in a battle oh he was bringing it all out I said Lord bless you oh that was good he was landed he and laying it in so he said don't don't go away thinking he said it that is you become a Christian everything's gonna be everything's gonna be good for you and he said I don't have to worry with this I want to experience no more pressure I want to experience no more stress no more strain oh yes he said he said why you're yet in this body he says you're going to experience those things and he said it's all bringing out our faith and he said you have need of patience he said and he bring that he brought up this scripture to us well I believe and so on so I said Lord I said you're with him and he got the people to worship him he got him over on the altar he's a come on he said you do you want to acknowledge it do you want to ask the Lord for his help there's his strength he said come to the altar oh yeah so he said let's sing and he's saying and there were those that came to the altar and after a few minutes he went down to the altar his wife went down to the altar they knelt down and prayed and they come back up and worshiped again now I said praise the Lord hallelujah thank God and he said now see if you want to leave you can leave buddy see if you don't he said we're gonna still worship hey man and he kept leading the people in worship and nobody left yeah I said Lord God bless him maybe they're gonna be there outside the city not bright but outside the city god bless amen brother he was preaching what he knew to be the truth and what was the truth amen to God be the glory because requiring more of you and me brother you have need of patience he said we gotta have patience for this place for that he was bringing it all out amen I said god bless you because you know what for generations they preach Christianity and a Christian life as all wonderful you don't to worry with nothing you don't not thinking about this or fight this to fight that well brother if you become a Christian you become a soldier it's to fight fight the good fight of faith amen so brother yeah I'm neither patience God give you patience only ghost patience then after ye have done the will of God after you've done the will of God it says doing good brother the Prophet preached doing God a service without his will as I said he preached it July in 1965 in in his in his own church but I said Lord that's funny seem like I remember other things in that message and that's when I discovered that he preached it in November just a short time before the Lord took him off the scene he preached it in November in brother Jack Norris Church in Shreveport Louisiana and he said a lot more here and he brings out a lot more so I pray grace that we'll get into it eventually not today so don't worry yeah but you have need of patience well you say brother you you've trained us in patience for all these years amen so if you don't have patience that's not brother jor-el's fault hey man you can you can say yeah well he's a pastor all right because you got it you got to have patience and if he got that patience to people gotta have patience amen so he said after you have done the will of God he might receive the promise grace that were in the will of God doing the will of God by the grace of God oh brother people don't consider it God's will only in only and believing this believe in that believe in something I know is the will of God for your life the will of God for everyday living not my will father by thine be done it's not it's not just so why I believe this and I believe that no no it's like the Prophet said you're in the message but it's the message in you that's tremendous yeah so there are many that are in the message and they're doing God a service but not according to his will that is the absolute truth there's many a believer and brother I met many many many married over the years I would say I maybe had fellowship with hundreds and maybe thousands yeah in all that I admit in the last over 50 years and Horne and oh yeah many were doing God a service but not according to his will God had mercy let's make sure that what you're doing is the will of God even like I said even to even do your job and even to your your your marriage and your family and your children oh yeah let's be doing the will of God not my real father don't be done sir he said for yet a little while and he that shall come will come no verse 36 for ye have need of patience and after year after year I've done the will of God he might receive the promise but you got ad patience I've done the will so let's wait on God let's keep doing his will and wait on the Lord what he does when he does and how he does it that's up to him Lord is not my will time be done every man because we got our will we want this we want this way that way this time that time no Lord your will be done Lord just give me patience yeah me to patience a man for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him let's keep moving forward don't draw back in your stand for the truth no no don't draw back in your stand for the message don't draw back in your stand for the revelation of the resurrection of the rapture no no but we are not of them who draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul amen why because we've done the will of God and we've had patience Holy Ghost patience amen waiting for the fulfillment of the promise we believe it and we're just waiting for God to do it needs time do it his way not my will time be done a man Lord Grace that I'm not doing you a service without your will but grace that I'm doing a service according to your will yeah honor the anointing of the Holy Ghost and you're doing it in God's time and in God's Way by the grace of God with God's attitude and God's Spirit by the grace of God amen this is tremendous brother so I believe I believe is and for God to lay down the prophets heart just before he was called home and especially the lad like I said the last one that he preached it was just a few maybe three weeks before the Lord took him and it's amazing too that you got believers who don't believe in cadet in communion but the last message that he preached was communion and really he didn't preach it he was in Tucson and brother Greene had preached and what did he do brother Greene asked brother Branham to come up and speak because I believe they serve communion they had communion at the time and he asked brother brother come up and speak so he brother Brad came up and spoke for not a few minutes concerning communion and he was exhorting the believers take communion stay with community and yet disbelievers feel that I don't have to take it because we got the word so we just commune with him through the revelation of the word no as like I said as long as we're in this flesh we need to take me yeah exactly it's pointing us to the redemption that is in our Lord Jesus Christ amen turn with me to one more scripture first John chapter 2 first John chapter 2 familiar Scripture and let's begin to read from verse 15 love not the world if you love it you want to stay here but if you don't love the world you don't want to get it stay here that's right love the world neither the things that are in the world the things and people like the world they like the pattern of the world like the ways of the world not necessarily sinful things but they're just basically worldly you know the way the world lives and what the world does to entertain themselves and so on so he should love not the world neither the things that are in the world for if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him and there are many believers that love the world they're enjoying life you know they're do they like doing this they like doing that they like going here going there so on no no brother if you want to go anywhere you want to go home to glory you want to go to eternity more than you want to go anywhere else again nothing gates if you had to go somewhere to go but again you don't let that take Priam it's over your spiritual by the grace of God for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and when it comes to the lusting of the flesh it's not necessary sexual know you can lost after natural things no you can lust after a vehicle you can lust after a house you can lost after clothes oh yeah you can lost after the natural things of life but too often people apply it to the the sexual and these things oh no the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes the pride of life amazing the pride of life is not of the Father but is of the world it's what the world is putting the emphasis on amen they're living for this to live for there so but we're living for eternity I'll pass it away and the lusts thereof but he that doeth the will of God abideth forever hallelujah not my will father dying be done but let's be found doing the will of God doing God a service according to his will he that doeth the will of God abideth forever amen God's grace amen share with you a couple of quotes out of the message doing God asserted without his will that he ministered again again this was in the Jeffersonville July will get normally I thought I would finish it all today but we'll get the Lord willing to this on next somebody the Lord willing but in Jeffersonville heat then we finished with the couple of quotes I shared it with you before and brother family is of course I lightning David here and what David did to bring the Ark of the Covenant back to Israel and he said David consultant thousands captains of hundreds buddy city failed to ask the main resource that God always deals with the profit he failed to get it now he said his intention was good his motive was good his objective was good he said to bring a revival in the city and to bring the people back to God but he said he never consulted the way God told him to do it sir brother find the will of God for your life amen and even he all the people agreed and the priests and the king was right he said they needed the ark back in the city now he said they needed the presence of God they needed the revival but God had not promised to reveal the His Word in its season to the people's he never promised to reveal it to the King in the season and God doesn't change a bit he didn't promise to do that no matter how sincere and what God what good motives and good objectives and how people want those things and see the need of it there is a will of God to be carried out in these things you recognize the need well let's get it the way God wants us to get it and let's do it the way God wants us to do it he said my grace amen he saw what happened he said their religious emotions was great their intentions was great their crusade was great their singing was great their dancing was great he said their shouting was great he said their music was great and they had the Ark what's good the Ark without God he said it's just a wooden box couple tables of stone and he said that's like taking communion being baptized what good does it do to be baptized if you're not first repentant what you do you got to do it with the right attitude and the right spirit a repentant heart by the grace of God a man a man so we can experience all of these in our flesh and the emotions and the feelings in our flesh oh yeah and we can as I trust it was the Holy Ghost you know in our worship in the psalm service amen praise the name of the Lord but again there are others that do it and it's just flesh they're just caught up emotionally but I trust we're caught up by the holy ghost amen so that it's not you this singing is not you there's worse for me it's the Holy Ghost he's in control of you a man praise the name of the Lord so that's why the probably God's are you can have it in your flesh and he said but not in your soul amen so I trust our worship and our singing in our praise what is it it's coming out of our souls by the grace of God a man said like he said what goods they are or rather he said your intentions are good your emotions was great and he said the crusade was great singing was great dancing shouting music he says great but what good's the ark without God let's make sure that it's God motivating it on the inside of the inside make sure that we are repentant souls trusting the Lord amen he said don't miss this he said they failed to get it because they never had an consultant and by doing watch he said by going to the priest by going to the theologians by going to the military forces not even considering their God sent messenger of the hour Nathan they did it wrong they went and picked up the Ark and put it on a new cart put it up on the new cart he said or a new denomination to going to start up and not upon the God given ordained way to pack it it was supposed to be packed on the shoulders of the Levites but you see when you start wrong you keep going wrong you got to repent start again and do what's right see how serious it is oh my they've done a man has done it all the way down through why because God moves and then when God moves the devil move on see that's and brother we've been dealing with that right for right from the first church age God dealing with the first Church age God said but this thou has that eight thou eatest in deeds of the Nicolaitans which I also ate and the Nicolaitans was a spirit a denominational spirit that the enemy was bringing into the church in the first age and what was the Nicolaitans spirit conquer the laity but he would make a denomination just all just believe what what the well the priest was going to say just believe that whether or not it's the word believe it it's really me he turns it from the faith of a revival to that of a religion a man but the church the early church they stayed in in the spirit of the of the revival amen but the enemy came in with this religious spirit to make a denomination out of it a man he said I have somewhat against thee because thou has left thy first love a man and that spirit was was getting more and more influence in their lives a man and they were getting out of out of the leadership of the Holy Ghost into the leadership of the Hon Holy Ghost amen Satan was moving among them and it got worse and worse and worse until finally in the last age they put him out they put him out but he was on the outside knocking so he could tell us it with the individual in it do all I stand at the door knock and if any man will hear and open the door I'll come in a fellowship with him and he with me Amen brother the bride age and the bride revival but probably God and responding to what they were saying in that magazine praying for revival pray for revival he said brother they don't know the revival is over and now is to get into bright ready to going to go into the rapture yeah see they're not they don't didn't recognize the bride revival like the Pentecostal revival just people today looking for a revival like Luther Wesley panic Pentecost and like the early days of the of the this message no no he said now has changed oh yeah the Prophet said that yeah state he said they don't recognize the rebirth the bride revival amen god help us that we're not going to miss it brother listen what time are we living him what's the age what is the hour that we are living and he said it's not time for these things that they're talking about that's past he said judgment is on hand now and you can see it breaking you remember the rock up on the mountain it is judgment our issue to remember he said the revelation or the vision of the bride just keep her in step don't let her get out of step but he said notice influence sometimes great guys get together and he said you hear them say so and so great so and so don't never do that there's no great ones among us and he said there's only one great one and that's God and he said we are brothers and sisters and he said I don't care if you're a pastor of a church that's got five people in it he said that don't make you little praise the Lord amen he said that don't he said that don't make that's got five people on that don't make you little he said that makes you a brother and he said you're true to God's Word I don't care how he said you won't get little he said God don't have little children and big children he just as children and they're all the same thank God brother he said he said the pastor strips had to the pulpit he said err he's a pastor and it's God ministering to you through the minister to the pastor and you're being judged by the world but he said when he stepped on the pulpit he's your brother amen praise the Lord he said we're in the last days were standing near the judgment why he said they're trying to eat old manna that fell back yonder fifty years ago he said the Pentecostal church he said the Holiness Church is trying over two hundred years ago the Lutheran's about three or four hundred more hundred years ago he said they're trying to eat old mana but he said he said that stuff is stagnated it's contaminated he's to find out if David or any of the rest of them he said would only consult the bread of the hour he said but now he said it won't do them no good he said had done moved out they won't help a bit she's gone she's crossed that line about five years ago between repentance judgment and mercy if his five years ago she crossed the line around 1960 between mercy and judgment a man why because they turned down the messenger and the message amen so how God was moving to catch the bride and to give her a rapture in fate oh yeah like I said I've witnessed it but I've witnessed over the last 50 years fifty-five years and more because I remember go back into the into this 63 64 65 I don't remember a name with the Prophet then but like I said I was I was in Pentecost I was I was identified with the Salvation Army depending coughs the church I was baptized in Pentecost and so on and it was not until 66 that I came to the message and I heard about the Prophet that was in June or July of 1966 when we got out of the school in here and we would always go back to my hometown for summer holidays and I remember getting back there and I remember we were staying at the time in my grandfather lost his house and I remember going into the hallway I'm picking up the phone and had the old phone and the dial and I called sister Goldie on the phone and I said Lord bless your sister Goldie and I just want to let you know I've arrived and we'll will receive you see in the service that that brother burns a Scottish meeting and so on she said brother journal she said I got some good news I said you do yes she said she said I want to let you know she said God has sent a prophet that was in June or July of 66 I said what yes she said brother he said she said he's the messenger to the last Church age and she said it's brother William Branham oh I see well praise the Lord I said well brother she said it's good she said I got a book here she said I want you to read and it was the part of the church ages but was just allowed to see interchange I said thank you and I got the book and read it amen and it was just a few days later that brother Manuel came out and we had a cottage meeting and he played a tape believe it or not it had to do with the original sin and that would be a hard tape from to play for a lot of people but to me oh I said that's right I said that's the word I said thank you Lord a man now from there on of course we got more and more into the message and it was in July I believe that I got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ yeah to God be the glory brother and I've witnessed a lot since then there was there was a going up and then around 1968 dude was it going down yeah the devil got him yeah well God was blessing us but then Satan came into again it's just illegal aliens god help us oh yeah I witnessed a lot and I've had to bear witness to a lot and testify to a lot and preach to a lot and so on so brother God have mercy on us let's stay in the Holy Ghost the right spirit and the right attitude he said watch Easter Division the other night exactly the same bride came this side come this side and after that prostitutes passed by with their gowns on and a little old things just this way dancing by rock and roll and calling themselves the church and you say well we don't do that that's the way God sees you it ain't what you see yourself it's the way God sees you he said no man sees himself wrong amen so God help us to see ourselves the way God sees us and Laura and brother sister will have will be into a constant spirit of repentance amen forgive me Lord forgive me amen he said the word the evening message must carry evening results the evening message must so evening seeds not morning seeds evening seeds and he said evening evening time message will show evening time light and will show evening time results so is that what we're seeing in this church evening time results end time results amen now I'm like what Luther had or Wesley or the Pentecostals but this is the end time amen there was this profit that profit that profit but then they came the God property in Christ oh yeah and there and they saw the results of these ministry that God profit oh yeah it was different yeah they thought that he would come and he would he would died like oh maybe all the rest of the profits and all just wonderful what a wonderful ministry but no he got to the place where as a prophet in this hour he had the first poll he had a second poll then he stopped and the third poll wasn't exactly what they expected wasn't what they expected it was what Jesus expected the same thing in this hour the first pool the second poll and they wanted brother branham to continue on with the first and second the first and second and but the angel told him to stop using it stop using it he said because the people are leaning on a signpost but the signpost is pointing to that's like I said coming into st. John's Oh st. John's so many kilometres so you were to stop there no as I said Oh wonderful we're getting closer home when we when we lived out there we'll go to outside the city and we drive back in or we beat Oh st. John says good wonderful st. John said Oh soon be home praise the Lord wonderful Oh see don't stop at the signpost no it's encouraging you to keep moving on you'll soon be home until finally we say all were home thank the Lord oh we were glad after driving for so many hours we're glad so brother after doing what we've done there was a certain Luther signpost but you keep going there Wesley's Pentecostal and all others that God use they were signpost getting closer to the end and I finally st. John welcome to st. John's oh now welcome to the resurrection rapture praise the Lord how many really believe that we've come to the resurrection rapture it was arts expressed concern your revival I want to share those thoughts are some thoughts with you regarding what the Prophet said concerning revival don't get caught up with man's idea of revival what is God's idea of revival man's idea Wow Wow well well well God's ideas Lord revival yes my son is a revival amen well it's what God is doing inside not outside hey man God I'll share with you some quotes the prophet has mentioned concerning revival in time rebuy so it's even I'm seed and he said the beginning message showed that the beginning result made creation he made his son his own in his own image in the midday and in the evening time he makes a bride for it and it's done by his word how did he form the earth how did he speak it into existence by his word in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwell among us how will he take his bride by the word not by a new current not by some theologians idea but according to the word he identify the bride don't put one thing to it or take one thing from it he said leave it the way it is Easter the evening time a man he said he promised the opening of the seven seals and he showed what them churches had missed back there he said revelation 10 Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 and he said he would do it so let's not mix it up let's keep it right like that the word Amen let's do God a service according to his will and what is his will it's the revealed word for this hour for this age let's make sure your life is lining up with the word the word the message of the hour the resurrection the rapture lining up a man so you're they look at your oh you're Pentecostal know we're bright we're in time bright where we are Lutheran's we are Methodists we are Pentecostals and we are this and that but bring it together and why did what what does God see it's the bright that's looking for the rapture Luther was looking for justification the Pentecostals they're looking for more nineteen in their lives and and and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the gifts of the Spirit and that's what they got they're hung in and thirsty for what God wanted to do but now the prophet of God said the Lord sends the whole spirit ahead to create in the hearts of the people a hunger and thirst for what he wants to do and what does he want to do now it's the resurrection rapture so God by the word is creating a hunger and thirst for the resurrection rapture in our hearts amen God be with us Amen let's take Lord bless you thank you praise the name of the Lord again to remind you to get a copy of brother matches notes outside there's only a few copies out there and be enough for each family grace let's sing amen when we all get to heaven amen sing the wondrous love of Jesus sing his mercy and His grace in the mansion's bright and blessed he'll prepare for us a place a man onward to the prize before us as soon his beauty will behold soon the pearly gates will open and we shall tread the streets of gold amen let's sing it for the glory of God we'll turn to our brother Bob amen so being prayer for our brother mark on Wednesday amen then come in the spirit amen for God to reveal his word amen seeing the [Music] merci and is great if the plant is great [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] we shall check the streets of gold when we all get to her what a day of rejoicing that will be amen when we praise the Lord [Applause] we'll say [Music] [Applause] [Music] water Hey praise the Lord that will be when we see a man what a day is gonna be praise the Lord one brother said this would be to call this place we will ever be so it'll be pretty noisy up there they're pretty noisy and the other place -
