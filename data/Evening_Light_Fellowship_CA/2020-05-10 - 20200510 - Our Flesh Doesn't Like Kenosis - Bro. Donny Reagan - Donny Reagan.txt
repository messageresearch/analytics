again into my chain [Music] as I would [Music] never [Music] for a man who trusts for longing for it by the grace of God but God knows God sees our hearts amen praise the Lord so we pray the grace of his presence to continue with us through this service and again to express appreciation for sister Priscilla special water phone from the highest mountain to the lowest Valley the gross Amen so Lord bless us as we continue in the service and just to say that we'll be having the online sermon by a brother I mentioned just a moment but first I want to bring greetings to the Saints from our brother dawn snow he called a couple of days ago because a brother in two states that we're playing to come there and here in May and June called him and of course it's canceled because of what's going on and he can't come out of the states into Canada and he can't come from anywhere else in Canada to Newfoundland and so it's been canceled and right now I understand that the weekend he's ministering to somewhere in the southern United States our brother Glover so god bless him and brother Dom wanted to send his greetings to the Saints here as well amen so we had a wonderful time of fellowship on the phone so god bless brother Don and and the believers in Central and also sister Beverly called again yesterday and spoke to us for quite a while and sending her greetings to the Saints here and the grace of God be with us amen truly we pray grace to them grace to us and they're experiencing of course what we're experiencing shutdowns and we're not allowed to do this not allowed to do that and so on and I think what was there her son in might have a New Brunswick he did share some information with sister Beverly and he told her he said well he said the world will never be the same no so he's just not going to be different and he said listen and he said the generation if there's another generation rises up he said they won't be able to identify with the world we lived in they won't they won't know anything about it and that's the truth and of course we know that it's it is going to get worse amen so and but again when it comes to getting worse is to get us to look how by the grace of God to get us to press on to the spiritual press on to the eternal not to keep our focus on the natural no no just leave that and let's move on by the grace of God just committed into the hands of the Lord when it comes to the when it comes to those that are that are experiencing suffering yes and and mourning the loss of loved ones many many many that have died around the world but it's going to get worse and again also of course remembering those in New Brunswick and what what they're enduring there and just to consider that after they lost and we're the number that was murdered in New Bronson gets tremendous and we pray the grace of God to the families of those that are mourning their loss and I understand - I think it's Nova Scotia where a young child just three years old I think is missing they found it's they found the shoes of the child in water so they assumed somewhere the child's body would be there so we pray the grace of God to the family there's no doubt mourning the loss of that loved one and to many others as well so grace grace grace and brother and I pray grace to the bride all we need grace for them yep but my brother we need grace when we consider this the services and how we have them how we're loud to have them not allowed to have them and so on it is absolutely amazing and sister Beverly did highlight that she did witnessed some brother she don't know it was online and but he was and it was a believer and he was taking his stand he said regardless of what the government says he said I got to do what God says a man and so he said even if I got to go to jail he said I'll do what God wants me to do and so I pray God blessed that brother a man and give him a greater and a greater a man encouragement and a greater and greater yes a man not to be afraid and keep pressing on so the Lord blesses and also to remember again of course other ministry and brethren that are under the same condition as we are here they have only a very few in their church and especially it's hard on those that have maybe hundreds in a search and now they're ministering just to maybe a few a man just five maybe in some churches might be ten and that's it and I believe that this weekend I think would be ten allowed for us the Lord willing so we will commit that to the Lord as our brother being nor rod with minister for us but and to let you know that we will be listening to our brother Donnie Reagan this morning during the last sermon that he preached and I think this sermon is let's see brother Donnie oh yeah our flesh doesn't like kenosis now he's been preaching on this for a long long long time on the different different ideas of kenosis and what is Kenosha's kenosis is getting rid of your will and accepting god's will a man so he said the flesh don't like that because the flesh wants to do its will but by the power of power of God in our souls we want to get rid of our will and have the will of God I don't care what it is because he's in control amen so if we're born again we want the will of God in all circumstances and in all situations amen so God's grace to us as we go in and here shortly our brother Donnie Reagan and one reason is that for the last couple of days I've had some back pain and I don't know what the problem was or is and I still got it and it's been very very difficult so I said maybe I stood up standing to preach and I said I'll get brother Donnie to preach for us they man and of course our brother Donnie he's experiencing what we experienced he feels the way we feel when it comes to the services and so on so the grace of God with him as he ministers to us concerning our flesh doesn't like canosa's and as I said he'd been ministry on earth a long long long time I couldn't believe it was indeed the I lied to something a hundred and some loud sermons part 132 I think or something like that so god bless the people and again when you hear the word don't just say well that's nice that's good I agree with that yeah if you agree with apply it the thing of it is people are hearing the word but they're not applying it so what we got to do is apply the word Amen so God gives it to us to obey it God gives it to us to challenge us God gives it to us to do to put it in action in our lives too many are listening to it hearing it and that's it they get up they come in and hear it they get up and walk out and leave it yeah they leave the message behind basically just goes oh yeah I agree with the message huh yeah we're taking apply it to your everyday living amen by the grace of God so the grace of God be with us and and be with our again sister Jaya Beverly and brother Doug and understand that they have quite a bit of snow we were having rain there every snow and she told us all the snow that they still got and and they have received it's tremendous a lot of snow so god bless our brother Doug and our sister Beverly and the other believers in that area and especially sister in I know and I know it Edna Gail in the home and I understand brother is at George my brother Georgia in the home there as well so God's grace to them god help us brother as we get closer to closer to the end that will have more concern for one another and love one another that we don't want this one to miss it we don't want that one to miss it and we're cleaning the token for each other amen and for our family grace grace grace amen so I turn with me to Luke chapter 22 god bless our musicians it's good praise the Lord in Luke chapter 22 and beginning to read at verse 39 he said and he came out and went as he was walked to the Mount of Olives and his disciples also followed him and when he was at the place he said unto them pray that ye enter not into temptation a man Grace and the greatest temptation is to keep our will over the will of God and he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast and kneeled down and prayed saying father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done and concerning what the bride is experiencing a mad that we would pray lord if it be your will remove this cup if it be your will change these circumstances in this situation but again if we're a bride where there's anointing will seek the will of God not my will father don't be done we want to do this we want to do that but God maybe wants us to do something else so not my will father don't be done and this is what our brother Donnie premonition for so long regarding kenosis is emptying our own will and receiving God's will a man grace to us and it says he said in verse 42 father if thy will if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done a bed thank God for his will and there appeared an angel unto him from heaven strengthening him and being in it in an agony he prayed more earnestly god help us and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground amen and when he rose up from prayer and was come to his disciples he found them sleeping for sorrow and he said unto them why sleep ye rise and pray lest ye enter into temptation the temptation to seek your own will and not the will of God does temptation to do what we want to do but not what God wants us to do so I pray the grace of God that we are yield to his will will we be receptive to the will of God but empty our own will regardless of what the situation is regardless of what the circumstances is regardless of what the issues might be Lord your will be done I don't care what it is what it concerns amen just consider all that have paid the price for their stand for the gospel sixty-eight million lay down their lives what are we doing amen no gotta sacrifice they make all down for the aid and that's more than 68 million when you consider all the other ages so what sacrifice are we making for the gospel see what are we doing for Jesus a man they laid down their life they didn't live for themselves they're living for Jesus amen and they died for Jesus they praise the name of the Lord so god help us just yes not my will time be done sixty-eight million took the will of God 68 million laid down their lives amen grace or Jesus that will lay down our lives and we're going to make whatever sacrifice we need to make in this whole world for Jesus for the Gospels sake for the kingdom of God sake for the sake of the rapture for the sake of the resurrection we're going to sacrifice the foolishness of this world we want to get out of here into glory so I pray God by grace then he make us more and more and more conscious of the eternal and less of the temporal amen more conscious of eternity in less of time they may it brother Terry this as Joshua and Caleb were more conscious of the promised land that they were the wilderness he didn't Matt didn't make it ever something what was going on in the wilderness God blessed them their God did this God did that a man but they still wanted to get into the lane they couldn't forget it a man and as time went on they had a greater hunger and a greater thirst to Gideon praise the lame of the Lord why because he knew that God was going to bless them in that Lane and get brother we're going to be blessed in the resurrection blessed in the rapture praise the name of the Lord get out of this old time and get into eternity or just think are you hungry for it are you thirsty for it it's going to be such a different world a man that there's not gonna be any thoughts of sin no thoughts of unbelief there's not gonna be nothing dark of all light by the grace of God amen no hate all love just think because everything else is done away with everything else is gone so do I pray God that we really really want to go we want to get there a man it's all mine I pray that we're experiencing it in our souls a man the anointing the love the life the power praise the Lord the Fellowship in our souls by the grace of God so Lord blesses return to service to our brother Donny Reagan as he comes to minister came to minister in his own church on Wednesday this staying for a word of Prayer amen every father thank you for your word yes Jesus and thank you for calling us to your word thanking us we thank you Lord for giving us that on grunt thirst for the word a man and to keep putting the emphasis on the word of God putting the emphasis on the promise of God but the emphasis Lord on your wheel not our will but the aims is Lord on on eternity but the Amazon to glorified body Lord the resurrection the rapture for the glory of God Evren are that we need to get out of here it's this our father of an hour that we need to father experienced eternity it's now father oh my lord grace grace again we are we know that were warned to be on our guard were warned to be on our toes were warned because of our bad is going to be that if you didn't shorten time there'd be no flesh saved so the grace of God Lord I pray for the rapture of the bride father our goal a sealing awesome us the glory of God father that we're going to get with you in your throne amen sit with you and your throne worship you in your throne for the glory of God be with us Lord the few that are here and Lord the others that are in their homes father listening by way of the computers in the name of Jesus I pray Lord that deal oh my that the Holy Ghost should deal with them Nord I pray the Holy Ghost will reveal the word to them I pray that they'll have that hunger and thirst for the word a man and order they will apply it to their lives nor not just agreeing with the teachings but Lord is applying it to our souls our bodies our spirits Alleluia Lord yes Lord if we all come to that that decision not my will don't be done grace Jesus to our brothers and sisters young and all here yes Lord and many many around the world experiencing the same thing God have mercy Lord that will not lose our hunger and thirst for the word not lose our anger thirst for fellowship not lose our hunger thirst for the love of God and the Fellowship of the saints but nor will keep praying keep pressing on believing grace as I committed all of you and your hands Lord watch over us we pray and help us Lord please to be sincere in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen god bless you and you may be seated and to say that I wanted to I've mentioned before to administer on the anointing was at the end time it's such a tremendous revelation that I may have to take a few sermons on that for sure concerning the anointing ones at the end time to explain concerning the anointed ones brother Brownlee is explaining concerning false Christ's he says not false Christ he said is plural false Christ's and he said false prophets a man and we're going to will bring out by the grace of God the things that the prophet of God was highlighting and bringing out the things that struck him and to explain to you the reason that William Branham preached the anointed once at the end time oh yeah he felt little the Lord and he said there's a reason for it and he was explaining what he felt was the reason that we need to hear the message that we needed to hear it and we need to really pay attention and get the revelation of the anointed ones at the end time lest we be deceived grace to us so God blessed us and we go to hear our brother Donnie Reagan amen brother Matthew thank you Lord Jesus what a great privilege it is to be able to live for him I've been serving him for many many years of my life and I think I'm more amazed now than I was whenever I first felt his tug on my heart there's a little boy because he's dealt with so many failures faults shortcomings problems issues and things of my life and it seemed like they never end closer we get to the end of the way and the more you think in our minds that we would know more about God and what truly we do but yet knowledge alone does not prevent us from heaven mess-ups and how great he loves us in spite of all that we greet just in that and the name of the Lord Jesus and hopefully this is the last time we'll have service like this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 it's just not the same but how I've enjoyed these 10 brothers 11 whatever it's men from time to time it's coming - we just appreciate the Lord helping us Lord willin Sunday we'll start with our new program a through G's many of you already got the letters and so on and we're going to try to make this work I know we will by the grace of the Lord I know most of us don't like rules and regulations and do's and don'ts and haves and have-nots and cants and ken Ott's and all that sort of thing but in order to make this work we're going to need the cooperation to people because once we start having church we don't want to stop having it because somebody got sick so we're gonna try to do our best to be able to comply to these things and don't stop praying now just because we're all able to come back together Church pray this thing's leaves us and gets away from us don't come back again because we certainly don't want no resurgence of it I don't want to start being able to come back to church and people go back to work and all that and then we have to stop again so we will make do with it Lord willing we'll start back three times a week after Sunday we'll have Sunday and then Wednesday and then Saturday and send in we'll keep on going that way alphabetically until they say that we're able to phase it all back together full time and we're just looking forward to that time Matthew chapter 10 verse 37 if you'd like to read with me to noun in the scripture I want to speak to you tonight on our flesh doesn't like canosa's our flesh doesn't like enosis this is going to be one of them services that everybody's going to shout and I understand it may be hard for you to hold your peace and keep from shouting but if you get a little out I'll I'll understand that so I just trusted you know you try to enjoy the word as much as you can the words of the Lord Jesus he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me I wonder how many people those few words out there believe totally out of the kingdom of God because if religion crosses mama they're out religion crosses daddy they're out but a real believer will go with mama or without mama if necessary they are worthy of him now think of these words this is the only creator and only creation of the creator that is worthy but he's identifying a group of human beings that were born lost unworthy and he's saying there's a group of people on the earth that's going to be worthy of me listen to those words he that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of me he that loveth son or daughter more and me is not worthy of me and he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me now remember whenever the Lord Jesus mentions this in Matthew 10 he has as of yet not mention anything about him dying on a cross so when the disciples hear this they do not their minds don't automatically go to Jesus on a cross because he hasn't mentioned that yet he mentioned our cross before he mentioned his but when he heard when they heard this they were very familiar with the cross because the Romans had killed hundreds and hundreds and even thousands of their people so whenever he mentioned cross they didn't think about Jesus but they talked about all them people they passed by and saw them dying on the way so remember when we think about this and our minds most of us was then where Jesus and his death and all that that's not what they thought about because they had not heard this at all notice again in Matthew chapter 16 verse 24 then said Jesus unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny Who the hardest person in the world that there is to deny we can deny our lives our children our parents our friends our closest buddy we can deny them easier than we can deny ourself if any man will come after me now we're talking about Brian material now not the church you can see why the church world will never fit into this if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up not my cross but his cross and follow me mr. pray together Heavenly Father we are so blessed to hear these words tonight I am so thankful Lord Jesus when I read this or when I hear it read it is not something of some historical significance it is not that I hear you the greatest figure of all eternity saying such beautiful poetic words the Father it's something that I have experienced myself and for that I am so grateful Lord Jesus I pray that you would take your word tonight speak to us father help us to see that if we have experienced and are experiencing this work was in our hearts all God helped us to understand it is of such great significance that the token life is living out of us everyday for we know to live a selfish life is to die and to be separated but father when we are looking heaven in the face is when we live our life for others that does not mean of what others can do back for us it means if they hate us if they despise us you turn alive he is living and doing for others without any hope of repayment at all speak to us tonight father your great words of eternal life for they are awesome to us and will give you praise in the name of the Lord Jesus amen god bless you you may be seated god bless you st. chatter streaming tonight let me call your attention back to Matthew chapter 10 again verse 38 when Jesus says he that taketh not his cross and follow us after me is not worthy of me so to carry a cross is a figurative expression of denoting that which God by his sovereign decree gives each of us in our lives it's not that we actually make our own cross we don't sit down and contemplate and say well what could I do and what can I be able to bear for the calls of the Lord Jesus and would it be this or would it be a certain way that I would dress or certain places that I cannot go and God gives us a questionnaire and it's a multiple-choice and you pick you can pick a B or C or D it's not of our own making at all but it's actually that which the Lord out of his own sovereign grace knows what each of us needs to be able to deal with it simply consists in doing our duty but not doing our duty with an attitude but doing our duty with the attitude of submission and love and that God has actually helped us to conquer our own will from within and the the revelation of this whole thing it involves that it's not the power of God constantly constantly day in and day out just beating our flesh down and whipping us and God kicking us about and stomping us nope that's not it it's the Spirit of God so prevalent in our soul by the new birth that God from within us is helping us to submit everything that we are now remember we are born wrong were born between Satan and evil born contaminated even after the new birth we are left with this mark that is still in our spirit still in our human nature so cross bearing I remember this is pre Catholicism so there look in a total different way the cross backs did not come to sum a couple hundred years after that so when the disciples here it automatically in their mind they're thinking of the mem that they would see by walking by the way and they would put them as we would say the highway out here going from Johnson City to Elizabeth then they would not pick them over into place of shame a disgrace but they wanted them to be seen so everybody along would come through they would write their crime over the top of their head so they would see joy and robbed a bank joy yarns done this Donnie Reagan done that so they wanted you to know your crime was right above your head so remember what they wrote above his head Jesus of Nazareth King of the Jews this was his crime so and whenever they would go by it wasn't a stigma about it so the disciples you imagine as they begin to hear the Lord Jesus say you've got to take up your cross and follow me now the way that it was it was two members of the cross actually of course our insignia is like this more than likely it was not like that at all but it was two members that was more like this only had a little a very little bit that was right above it where they would nail your crime and the the man that was going to be crucified he would take the cross member this part right here this was the part that the Lord Jesus began to carry and he became weaker and weaker and we know that there was one according to the Gospel of John that was beckoned to help the Lord Jesus carry so the disciples when they hear these words they saw it since they were little boys so in their mind maybe their mind flashed back to seeing this man or maybe this old man or this young boy and they would see him as he would have his hands stretched out like this and they would have cords or ropes upon that and he would pack his so he was actually carrying the cross member or the top member like this and they would make him pack it for quite a ways the Lord Jesus was led down what was later called the Via Dolorosa the several steps of the cross which will mark today by churches and various things that you can walk through but in that day it was not a place of glamour there was no cathedrals ever no churches there so they would pick a public route that was very heavily traveled a trade route to the market to all the places you were spit upon you were a live tank you were ridiculed you but made fun of and the whole time you were carrying this cross member something like this now it was up and down steps it was through inclines it was through twists and turns in the road and the people along the way were more than welcome to ridicule you they were more than welcome to hit you they were more than welcome to run up and pull the beard out of your face to hawk spit and spit right in your face and kick you that was perfectly fine the Roman guards had no problem with that at all as a matter of fact the more pain that was inflicted the more shamed the more it served their purpose so remember when the disciples hear this they do not identify with something hanging around someone's neck on a gold or silver shape they do not identify with a symbol hanging outside of a church door but they identify with blood and pain and suffering and sorrow and humiliation and shame the lowest degradation that a person commands I remember a Roman citizen no matter how low that they stooped in life that they were given and spared this - it was so low no Roman citizen could ever be crucified because it was deemed the lowest of all deaths for anyone so when the Lord Jesus you're imagine now this 2,000 years of tradition now whenever you're hearing this for your first time so you don't identify as I said with a necklace around your neck or something hanging on your mirror in your automobile but what you see is these people that have been beat and spit upon and they would raise them up just high enough off the ground and the wild dogs would come and rip the meat from there the crows would come and pick their eyeballs out they've been known to hang on the cross for six to seven days and they would hang there and actually start mortification setting in their body and they would begin to sink and rot you imagine the Lord Jesus speaking a symbol to be able to identify following him now these disciples had in their mind that the Messiah was gonna come and he was going to be the son of David he was going to be a mighty Conqueror he was going to throw down the Romans and he was going to raise up his kingdom what did her cross have to do with the Lord Jesus you can see why the disciples they were so stumbled because he said Lord will you now restore to us the kingdom of Israel they did not understand they did not grasp the full the purpose of our Lord's Advent but they had it all run together that Psalms 2 and Psalms 84 and how they're 7 and all these Isaiah 35 in Zechariah 6 all these things the mighty conquer the serpent bruiser they did not understand that he come to first on aisle eight sin then he would come at us you're in his kingdom so when he says this these horrific images come into their mind you imagine them looking at one another and thinking across across has to do with the Lord Jesus what what does this mean what what the significance to it and when he says he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me it's not worthy of me now if you notice the word that the Lord Jesus uses there he does not say he that make us not his cross but he that taketh not so it's not up to us to make our own cross because God knows how we are if each of us would make our own cross instead of it being spread from tip to tip to our fingertip and said if it being were often rough-hewn Omar we would have its wick like this and it'd be so nice my be high-gloss Paulie and he'd be rough down that wouldn't be mold splinters on it would take it all and smooth it down and you know just make it really really lie and make it so easy and so that we'd all be able to make it right through but you see the Lord custom makes each of our cross and the last time I look none of us get high-gloss poly or lacquer that's right he's not making a piece of furniture he's not making something that's going to be set in a museum but it is something that will help us along our journey in life in order to make us as the people of God that will stand there that day as overcomers because if he pushes us through one end of the pipe and reaches in the middle of the pipe and jerks aside on the other sides and said blessed are they that overcome really we haven't done anything we just held our best from the end of the pipe to the other end of the pipe but God knows exactly what each of us need in order to make us those blessed overcomers that he so he's so designed figuratively in his mind of what a Christian wall will do never remember as I said they did not have a clue that he himself was also going to be first for taker of the cross for whatever reason the Lord Jesus is now trying discipleship and you see it's so hard preaching it is so difficult preaching and preaching that requirements are laid out that's what scatters many times the sheep from the goats and that's why we've had many many visitors over the years and probably will continue to do so and if they hear something about do's and don'ts and this and that ma they'll sit there and clap their hands and they love the music and they love the feeling and the church until the preacher gets up to preaching on something of course that they're doing or something that they enjoy dying and then they do never could do come back again why it is a test of discipleship now a test of discipleship is not those who believe Jesus died on the cross a test of discipleship it's not that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son a test of discipleship is not John 3:16 that Matthew 1038 a man a test of discipleship is not believing that there's a God a test of discipleship is not believing there is a heaven a test of discipleship is he that will not forsake father mother houses lands and even himself and take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me now notice this is why that there is such great designation between the bride and the church because the bride or the only ones on the earth that are worthy to match he to be his missing piece of his mystical body and they are worthy Allisyn they are actually worthy of him because he has made them worthy and they past not only believe in John 3:16 but they passed the very test of discipleship which helps them to crucify their greatest enemy which they love more than anybody else and that is themselves can you all say Amen you know looking at this course God will custom make each person's cross that it will have an element of affliction it will have an element of persecution it will have an element of glory mixed in that and it will have an element of suffering for some it will be suffering and shame and humiliation and if their feeling was the pride of life is very you know it's a very big thing to them that more than likely God will custom-fit their cross to where it will actually work against them and help humble that so God will it's not like that God makes one and then you get in line and yours is the same as the four thousand five hundred eighty two in front of you but each one of us will have a his cross or a her cross now I can pray for you and I can ask God to help you and you can pray for me but actually I cannot bear your cross and you cannot bear mine is that right Peter could not bury James cross and James could not bury his and shoot us you know here hears his own place of sycamore tree Judas was the one that chose to go that way and Judas went back to Hell where he come from and he took the thief on the cross with him Jesus took the other thief on the cross back where he come from so each of us have got a place to where we are I did five well now the Lord Jesus says again in Luke chapter 9 verse 23 and he said to them all If any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily so notice this is not something that happens one time at the moment or the instant of the new burst and then we do it then and it's done once and forever it's actually something that we do every day of our life and it may change from one day to another what the cross curtails it may be one day it may be affliction the next day it might be a persecution from without the next day it might be a persecution from within and God is the only one that can intertwine it all together now you can imagine us having many many hundreds of people that come here to church how that the complexity of this body is that while some are going through sickness in their body some are suffering with their families some are going to financial things others are going to other things in life and you might try to relate to this person and that person said well I really don't understand what you're going through because that's not really my battle and yeah you imagine that around the world that God has it so diversified that whether it's in Africa whether it's in China now most of us more than likely will never go through what some of our Chinese brothers have gone through and some of them even this very night in jail because having the soul made it available Chinese Bibles in this very night imprisoned because of standing for the gospel you know we know we don't believe anyway that most of us will ever go through that so it would be hard for us to bear that cross but I don't think that should put us to where that we're unconcerned for our brothers that are there is that right but yet the Lord Jesus knows how to make cause to her it will work on one person now another person may give to you their cross all you know I'll go through this and I'll go through that and you're sitting there listen and you're trying to give it a 10 of year and a heart that is touched by their burden and you're just thinking wow and you get done and you set that well brother god bless you god bless your sister I should be praying for you and then whenever you leave and you sing man hours that's all I had to go through Wow I wish that was my cross now you see what you're doing is you're measuring their cross most of the time by our strengths and by the great things that we have in our life and more than likely what they said never bothered you or it wouldn't affected you in that voice I said boy ours that's what I went through but if you would have told them what you went through they might have felt the exact same thing about what Google said wow I wish that was my burden but remember it's not us that picks what we go through either that'll for our brothers and sisters now let me just be honest with you as your pastor many of you that go through various things of life and you call Carol and I to pray for you or you send me an email or text or something like that our hearts hurt boy it's been so difficult going through this time different one's been in the hospital I've not been able to see nobody go talk to nobody and it's been very very hard but yet it's immortal I realize if there was much much of what I could do if it was left up to me I would lift many many of y'all's burdens off of you as a shepherd because I love you so much but you see my love loving you like that it's not to the deepest degree by which God loves you because I look at you now I feel sorry for you and a lot of what I'm feeling is the love of God but it is also human compassion remember human compassion is not doing the will of God and a lot of times we try to minister to one another through human compassion and then we misunderstand God because we judge and we said well if I'll tell one thing if I was God I'd heal that person why would God leave that on them because see you're judging it by human compassion and you're look I say that ain't funny right why all God would have to do is just speak and it would lift that burden from them but God sees this tremendous victory that's going to come to pass if that brother sister be faithful going through that trial and if you and I would lift it off of them that big testimony maybe ten people will get saved by them coming through a trial maybe 15 more people will get healed of cancer by hearing their testimony maybe 35 more people will get delivered of something else and you and I would have stopped that complete victory by our human compassion so it shows we cannot go by human compassion so what does God do then god custom makes every one of our crosses that will fit us exactly to the T now the bottom line of what God wants to look at is God wants to work on this element that's left inside of every one of us that has the capability the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life all of that sinners around that part left in our natural human makeup which is called selfishness praise God now from here on I imagine even the mass won't say man now when Adam was the image of God in him was willing to walk out with his wife with the image of God still in Adam he was willing to forfeit his position of being God on the earth the image of God was still in it but once the image of God left him then the selfishness entered him after his fall that he never had before find one degree of selfishness and Adam at all until he failed then after he fell that lathe that was which was in him it's like it was awakened somehow another two thought the permissive one of God and it awakened in him and you see this first exploit of selfishness and the man says whenever God come question him the woman that Dow gave us to be with me now he was willing to forfeit his god ship he was willing to forfeit his power to be able to move trees and speak to whatever more the wind he was willing to forfeit every bit of that with the godlike image inside of him what's the godlike image loved him what was there to rule in its place selfishness then when God comes down what is Adams first response selfishness so instead of him saying now God don't don't take her place it's my fault I shouldn't have done this I should have stopped her it's my fault totally you don't see him saying that at all but he blames God and he blames her the woman vow gave us to be women if you don't let me make another choice god I'd never married her in the first place that she's the only woman on the earth so I actually ain't my fault nohow it's your fault her fault now what was the difference the image of God left him and when people get out from under the impression of the image of God what do we see that's the most prevalent force in their life selfishness well praise God what causes so many marital problems selfishness what causes parent children problems many times selfishness what causes problems in the church most of the time selfishness a man mother Donny tracie brother Donnie Donnie well I can't wait to Sunday like it all them people saying hey man god bless your heart now the woman the woman truly was desiring to be like God and we know that's what Satan offered her but Adam it puts him at a total different spot the one of course tries to pass the book as we say right on down but notice what brother Graham says you're a person who lives their life for their self lives a selfish life we must live for others now this is why our flesh does not like canosa's because canosa's the full effect of canosa from the soul than the inside out constantly wants to bring this flesh subject to the dominating force that lives inside the soul now brother don't hear you saying we're not even to do anything for ourselves we don't know I'm not saying that at all God left within us the ability of self-preservation this is wife an automobile stops in front of you and 3/4 of a second you will respond by putting on your brake pedal it is an amazing that God makes you that fast and the lows no automobiles when God made man in the Garden of Eden we've been very very bad shape if God would have made our response 38 seconds long but I'll be dead tonight wouldn't it so God made that in us it's self-preservation you know your body if you're living if you're outside and the temperature starts to drop what will begin to get cold your fingertips are start getting cold as the cold moves closer your body will start cutting off the extremities that rival the terrible jaw it'll start cutting off your toes the blood will come on in closer closer and the heat will start coming right around your heart to protect the product organs and all inside what is that it's self-preservation is it wrong for us to feed ourselves of course not is it wrong for us to have hobbies and things out there that just we and ourselves enjoy doing no it's not until that becomes a primary saying that we want to do and whenever we do then we are actually asserting the very nature that we were given they trying to fall between the birds of Satan and Eve now I know I don't want to hear that but it's the truth so selfishness actually comes under the control of the Holy Ghost but instead of God annihilating it at the new birth he wants it to be that constant struggle that'll be there every day of our lives so we don't overcome it once we overcome it once every second or two or three praise the Lord well baby y'all don't but I'm just doing my me I guess now burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ and we've got to have a feeling for one another notice again he says so each day I want to live not from her cell if I live for myself I live a selfish life I want to live for others and give more strength to ham not to myself and to my own pleasure but for the benefit of others that will build the kingdom of God now once then selfishness and we said what I do to do things for others sure but selfishness is more than just doing things for others watch this and the word made first I recognize the other day a selfish spirit coming up in me oh my goodness this is Elijah y'all believe he had the Holy Ghost I recognize a selfish spirit notice he didn't say getting on me but he said coming up in me oh praise God now notice coming up in me of saying this man's wrong I'll to tell him about it oh my goodness well I thought that was standing for the word I thought that was uh huh see how easy selfishness gets intertwined with the work of God now watch how brother Ram senses she said I to tell him about it that's wrong God's the one to tell him about it that's not it's none of my business all my goodness so whenever we get involved and we want to take the place of God until this person in that person that person that person is wrong actually that's none of your business oh Jesus what is it selfishness all but it's my place to correct him what brother Branham identified that is being selfish I wonder how many of us have got selfish actually would probably do more good if we pray for him instead of trying to be their head or their leader now once this he says it's not about business it's my business to preach the gospel I love my enemies as Jesus Christ loved me when I was his enemy oh my that's right when I was unlovely he loved me to his bosom and anybody that's unlovely met me love them the same let the spirit that was in Christ being us amen I love him or love him oh ma now what's out then that selfishness can be able to enter work itself in the very work of God and convince us that it's godly seal it's godly says you talking about a mimic you talking about a devil trying to hide himself the devil of selfishness that puts on the face mask of integrity and stand for the word when it's really all about selfishness praise be to God notice again he said when a man's ever truly born of the Spirit of God from the crown of his to the end of his toenails he's been changed by the resurrection power of the Lord Jesus Christ and his own selfish ideas have faded away and God has got complete control of that man of a Lord Jesus Christ and practice the same buddy that is a powerpack gentleman right there I'm telling you what notice this ceremony and look at the title here he preached this now not in a 55 in Campbellsville this is where sister Natalie Cox actually got saved this particular night brother Charlie didn't give his heart to God but from this sermon the Lord started dealing with him and maybe a week or so after that's won by the Charlie had given his heart to the Lord you say by the random I'm no prostitute I don't know together mean sexually prostitution on a higher level you can prostitute your time how much time do you give to him prostitute your own selfish motives now what does the prostitute do cause a prostitute sells her body to someone else while the prophet of God use such a word or words that we would associate with filthy unclean living he wanted to drive home the point brother Darrell that we also can give our motives our objectives our ideas our goals and so on and let our goals our motives our objectives become a prostitute to the devil and the devil will take our time our motives our objective our so-called zeal and he will take that use that for his own pleasure oh praise be to God can't you see why our flesh don't like enosis hey my flesh don't like this preacher no more than you do I just like it twice I'm having to preach it and yet it worked at the same time but you know what it's the truth it is the truth in reading this I read this many years ago of course but going back the other day look at this I thought oh god help me help the church Lord the bride around the world that we don't prostitute our time and prostitute our knowledge when you look at all the avenues by which Satan would want to try to prosper how many brother Darrell that we know that prostitute their knowledge of the message and they give their knowledge of the message as a prostitute and Satan will project his own motive inside of their knowledge or prostitute their gift or prostitute their ability or their influence and Satan will use their influence oh god help us that we do not give our motives our time our emphasis nothing about us to the devil now notice he said prostitute your own motives going around saying well I belong to this church oh my goodness so you mean when a person is going around and pride and arrogance and identifying themselves in a certain group they are prostituting their identification I belong will you imagine whenever I'm seventh under I don't believe in preachers I'm tape only you're a prostitute well praise the Lord you're a prostitute God's got a powerful ministry not one God's got more than one preacher well praise the Lord I don't need nobody I listen to tapes you're a prostitute listen to tapes well glory to God then you friend every group around the message this is their attitude I'm better than you I'm more Revelator than you we got more miracles than you we got more people you're a prostitute you're prostituting the cloud you prostitute in the anointing you're a prostitute again but all my let's keep back what's gone it's given to us I don't want to prostitute my guilt a prostitute minority I wanted to be a virgin to the Lord Jesus so the Lord Jesus can fill me with his seed Oh a lot I'm better no you're not you can prostitute otherwise then sexually the Holy Spirit will speak to your heart and you'll say I want nothing to do that you blind Pharisee prostitute lord have mercy what's the matter with you commit adultery with the world that's what you're doing oh you say I belong to church and so cold and indifferent oh you say pretty prayers oh that fair same thing you pray and make every comma just perfect every period just perfect you pray so beautiful you can't talk to God like that you're listening to what you're saying and punctuating your prayer can you imagine a person giving their prayer as a prostitute so when they pray and they won't impress people in my they want to have all the nouns and the pronouns and all that sort of thing and whenever they do it even stain them they may be sent a rubber hammer but the pride gets involved in it you know what happened right ahead Satan took that prayer and had his pleasure with their prayer brothers we may not have to worry about Sonny having social distancing everybody may social distance at home well guess they'll be 10 or 12 gathered here Sonny huh my lord I'm running them off all they ever even get to come back listen piss your listen to what you're saying we're not supposed to be listening to her own prayer God's supposed to be listening to it but you're listening to your own prayer saying and punctuating your prayer oh god help you to turn loose wants and pray stop saying prayers stop saying you notice how what people are doing in their same prayers prostituting oh praise God listen Tish you talking about what a devastating thing that selfishness is and the mighty clunker brother Branham says this we will never conquer as long as were selfish God hates sin and he will not let it triumph over all notices in prison Apollo prisoner Oh God make us prisoners like that from our own selfish ambition and from our own judgements and our better way of thinking to be a prisoner of Jesus Christ what are you talking about take up your cross and follow me daily I think that was a great statement that I'm a prisoner to Jesus Christ burger 98 Oh tonight if we Branam tabernacle could always become prisoners listen to what now not drinking smoking dope marijuana to our own selfish being to your own ambition that we could completely surrender our self and be yoked to him no matter what the rest of the world thinks what the rest the world does were yoked with fetters of love we are prisoners and remember God don't want it to be a big chain on you and you're scared to death and you're terrified of God no God wants it to be fetters of love you could go sure sure you could go his love that the bride has for him and he has for her it's not fettered by gigantic long chain you know waiting five hundred pounds and the bride's trying to get away free trial I would if I could get this off my leg no she actually don't have anything on her leg she has it in her heart he don't have her all slammed in behind the sale somewhere and 32 padlocks on it in on 47 guards this one 32 that white no it's not that way at all the door is standing wide open the gate is open you want to go hallelujah this is the way he proves his love to the devil that's exactly right he ain't got her chained down no long chain but he's got her right there she is a prisoner of love over the devil says come around the Prophet said yeah you could if you wanted to but you don't want to know more you have become our love slave to Jesus Christ all my love this and their known and once he said many of you here not be Trinitarian preachers we don't want you to be angry with you said we love you if we did not believe that I'd never leave this church so I got down there and my knees and said God make me right I don't want that arrogant selfish spirit mixed up was mine now listen how he looks at arrogance and selfishness I want my spirit to be pure and clean so you can't be arrogant and selfish and pure and clean at the same time if you're pure and clean you won't be arrogant and selfish but if you're arrogant and selfish you're not pure and clean well praise the Lord you can mix it together you're not making a cake you're making a born-again experience I've never oh my I want my spirit to be pure and claim brotherly love holy and the Holy Spirit now if someone does anything wrong to me that's all right whoa and though I might have the right to get back at them I don't want that in my life no I want to have love I want to be ready to correct for the loved and was loved that absolutely answers out yonder for it ma now look at what Satan wants to do oh you know the complexity of the new birth to us as mortals imagine have must have been quite overwhelming for him as well because the picturesque view of the new birth never come into clarity really whenever the Lord Jesus even speaks to Nicodemus because he speaks him in parables and we don't have any direct place where the Lord ever actually mentioned the new birth directly through the apostles but yet John must have either been around been near Jesus told him later so when the new verse came over there Pentecost it must have been quite mysterious even to them and imagine they wondered in the heart now that this has come down and this great thing has touched our souls in our hearts what will we be will would be absolute little amateur gods upon the earth is there an element of our humanity left I wonder how long it took them to the day before they realize that the humanity will still there mix in with the deity you need they leave the upper room and they go down they start preaching so it must have been maybe hours that they were caught up into this and they begin to feel this supernatural phenomena and I wonder if they doubt in their minds Oh Lord we've been changed forever we'll never go back to being immortal again we'll never feel this way again but then the anointing begin to wear off and maybe somebody said one to another you know and they begin to kind of get aggravated and then they realize it stroked him oh my goodness we've got changed and we've got born again but the element of our humanity still remains in the mix so it is the mixture of what he was imagine it must have come back to their mind and then the contemplation of what God had done for them was mirrored from the first one of the new race because they would see him gone with a headache in another moment of time they seemed stopped a coffin and raised a boy from the dead and they in there they begin to see himself mirrored in there they would see them lay their hands on the sick and cast out devils and they would see themselves getting sick and they would see themselves having problems in their own flesh and troubles in their church it's alright now miss brother Bheema says this if you profess to be a Christian depart from sin and selfishness and tempers and live like Christ they're peaceful humble god bless life Ava I agree with that don't you amen notice again you see what pride and selfishness does it shuts you out from the kingdom of God now even when I talk about drinking and running around with somebody else's wife selfishness and pride shuts you out from the kingdom of God notices and images of Christ while I love this one here I remember it's only the sick that demands attention service just the sick they demand attention when you see a preacher and they are not only limited to a preacher but they are limited to every church member that wants attention I'm somebody just remember there's a spiritual sick person there needing attention now this is what he says they need they need the attention of the Spirit of God to give them something that'll take that attitude out of them and heal them from their selfishness God that sounds like a spanking to me now they think they need attention and here comes God with a big battle or a big whip he's gonna whoop up on you why because that's what you need now you you need attention more accolades appraised all my everybody just makeover you makeover you're making God sad I know what you need bend over my knee here son oh praise God one of the best signs I know that I've got I've still got scars and marks all over my spiritual body because of Benwick child of God but I'd rather be a whoops I love God than be a Bachelor of the devil and God let me live like the devil and do everything in the world and still annoy men let me scream and shout I'm glad my older ghosts won't let me do that on the inside of me that if I even step over that and feel like I took any glory anything away from him at all that something smarts me like a 10-ton truck I'm glad I can do that aren't you brother Darrell I'm glad that's inside of me that built-in something inside of me but no there's a line between what God wants to share with us and what belongs to him only hey man notice this Big Ideas big me and little you the Holy Ghost makes us all the same this is the communism that I believe the name Russia's communism its Holy Ghost communism whether you drive a Mercedes or a bicycle your brothers whether you dress in a tuxedo or whether you come to church in blue jeans and a yellow plaid shirt you can hook one another on the net you don't have that puffed up attitude well I'm in the top five category I didn't know we had a five here at the church that's all we was all on the top well praise God notice the Holy Ghost makes you all the same too much spiritual sickness anemic and the knee Mia's fought a blood problem a blood problem folks get just enough of the doubts of the blood of the Lord Jesus to forgive their sins but they're still anemic sin their tail and their puny and their weak my Bloods love oh I feel I faint oh that hard preacher Oh where's my sofa oh let me think let me think that those that are strong meets a prize go milord why they ain't got a blood problem they got good blood that's right the blood is rich and it ain't their blood it's the blood of the Lord Jesus or not pay or they're not weak and you try to stand up let's everybody praise the Lord praise the Lord I'm so weak I got a sat back down you're anemic you got a blood problem let's go to the course and get a good blood transfusion what do you say get a real good dose of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then you'll quit looking down your nose at everybody else and look down your nose of you and realize you are the biggest problem you've ever had and ever will have well too much spiritual sickness and nevis you know what I mean is it's someone that hasn't God anymore they walk funny don't pop see tipsy topsy all the time that's what's the matter with many of our church members today they are anemic they need a blood transfusion of Calvary that'll give them rich royal blood in the old fashion know where the Holy Ghost hewed out way of God that'll give them something to live for give them a confidence that will make them walk in the image of the Lord but they will put sickness and you like you say get out of my way Goliath you better get out of my I'm coming on but oh oh I'm not to pass out oh god here comes a truck oh oh oh set me down see me fail you need more blood I said you need more blood you might need a whoopin to stir up your simulation a little bit praise God to be a Christian well it's self-denial deny yourself take up your cross follow me daily today it's so soft and people call it what in the world for instance this is 1963 what would he say today 2020 if he thought they were soft at them oh my goodness people call themselves Christians well he used to mean death - confess Christ you have to depend on him daily forever saying you I'd need up again Christianity is self-denial take up your cross daily follow him down to the things of the world when all condemnation is gone now let me skip over here just a little bit to our brother Brad let's go to second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 17 let's just touch on this a little bit and pick it up in Orland sending look notice the difference now between selfishness and self about us which of course comes from Satan did not come from God notice this appalled said therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature all things are passed away and behold all things are become new and all things are of God who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ I love the meaning of this word it is to change or exchange as coins for others of equivalent value you see that's not the way we understand reconciliation we think reconciliation is we were a piece of trash junk rats on the garbage heap and God took us all some awesome pearl the great price this beautiful beautiful treasure is heaven and bought this piece of junk but that's not reconciliation at all even you brothers still looking at me funny but God actually took one coin which he made untouched with the dust of humanity glory and took that coin in the place of those other seeds which were represented in dust as well but they were actually of the same value to him praise be to God the one that he took this invaluable piece that was totally completely priceless and he bought this piece of junk with it and he's spending his whole time trying to modify this junk and change the show no that's not what he's doing at all that is not reconciliation how could you be reconciled to a friend you never had how could you and John Doe and Jim doe and Frank know and and you say I don't even know the doughboys be reconciled to them what did you know no I never know him in my life did you go to school them on no I never once go but I want to be reconciled with people the good you said well you're crazy forget it we preach reconciliation to God they say we're nuts but this is what the Bible he has reconciled us to himself by his human temple human anointed temple to hoover god anointed in a human body hukum gnosis himself so here was this coin upgrade by others the first attribute of the logos they come out of the eternal but when all these other attributes of wealth and they were the same value why they were the elect quality they were not opinion he was a silver dollar they were from the throne of God but they were lost out of friendship out of fellowship out of circulation remember when Jesus gives the three parables there in Luke of the man within hundred sheep and then the woman who lost the coin and then the prodigal son look at him all three of them dating with the elect he didn't have 99 sheep and one goat went out turned made that goat and changed him over and transformed him into a sheep it was a hundred sheep and went out Joe walked a reconciler bring that one sheep back and the woman that had them coins if they know what it was it was that headband around her you know someone before mother necklace and she lost that coin but remember the coin was hers first what was those parables ministry of reconciliation he come to get the church he come to get them and he offered them Grace and they were undeserving that's exactly right they were undeserving they were not of his she knows they were not his kind but the blood is his kind because he is the word the word so what did she do she takes the lamp and she goes to sleep in the house looking for what something she never had if she never had it how does she know what to look for but she took the broom and swept the house I love the Prophet said one day you'll be standing and all of a sudden [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] unless she knew exactly what that point was all but may I remind you that coin had an image on it an image and superscription on it the image of the issuing came of that day so it's a Roman Denari eye hallelujah speaking in tongues already a God it was lost but it was lost in the terms of election lost it was simply out of circulation glory be to God as she confined it it still has value and she can find it it still has buying power if she can find it and restore it back to his face it still has the same power that the rest of them had there was no loss this is reconciliation we were not a bunch of goats around and a bunch of weeds and somehow the Lord done something to us that was a new birth that ain't a new verse lost condition and the Holy Ghost coming inside that senior and quickly new to eternal life Lord God all things are of God who has reconciled us reconciled reconciled reconcile no I'm stuck I just want you to get it reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ they don't stop there but he says he has given to us the Ministry of reconciliation praise be to God we have been given the Ministry of reconciliation to do one brother Darrell go out there and find those other coins that are not in their place hey man maybe preach a lesson Tom preached predestination - oh my never eat something tom that will help them the real heart you never want to coach you never like that you always was a shape can't you see why the church world itself really don't understand or believe in reconciliation why because their preachers have preached to them don't preach to them their reconcile as they were a friend with God before their preaching to them truly the truth for who they are to hear that true I used to hear yes I did but I thank God I thank God one day I realized all them years of hearing that that wasn't really who I was they really who I was I thought that's who I was and it took me years to get that tradition out of me but now realize I've been reconciled to God I was a kind that was lost oh man so she sweeps the house and she sweeps the house and she finds a gravel and she takes this gravel over to this machine and she runs it to this machine no that's not repairable really well that's all preach the gospel that God finds all these people out there and there was lost and deserving to go to hell and you know they should go to hell and all that sort of thing and then God grabbed hold this gravel and this whole scrap he said this said another and God done some type of magical send another that's not reconciliation how do you [Music] so let's say I get in a tight spot I'll take this sin how's your microphone we're in a good microphone cost several hundred dollars I take the microphone I take the receiver over there I take it down to the pawn shop I say sir I made a little money for this all right let me look at it okay Sennheiser models so and so looks like you got an 835 on the directional microphone sm58 hyper-cardioid condenser on the top of it looks like it's reverting nice shape yes sir it is it looks like it works frequency adjustable frequency yes sir okay let's hook up right here in our analyst exec a customer an eight hundred ninety seven dollars something like that use market value say two three years old I'd say somewhere in five hundred dollars I'll give you $400 for it so I hate to part with it but all right now what I'm going to do I'm going to give you a ticket I'm gonna put the matching part of that ticket on the set this set is not actually for sale unless you miss your date and the date was so important that it had been even time it's named and identified after the visitor this one man up to a certain part of his Advent it was called BC but with his coming to the earth he changed from BC to AD so he came exactly the right time and he broke the Old Testament and the new and he come with all of these pockets full plumb full of these Redemption tickets praise God I didn't say one day going down to the world they told the disciples corn in town get some vittles it's about lunchtime and they've run out of food he said I must needs go through Samaria so he's out there saying bye well here comes this woman boy she had major major problems Jesus goes to talkin to her a little bit we know the story he goes to telling her and break encounter break endure so no to self he has her ticket in his pocket she don't even know she's worth a ticket looking at herself and the Prophet said she was thinking I don't know about this man I'm worth right now the Prophet said the reason she was in that shape was because of mom and daddy turned her out when she was young and she started living that kind of life and he said people talk about child delinquents he said a lot of it is parent delinquency and one thing he identified it was with people not whipping their kids when they need it they called it parent delinquency she thought she was worthless everybody else did as well hallelujah and he began to reveal the secret of a heart go get your house I'm gonna come here that's the truth you've had five on the one you're with now is not your husband so it reaches inside and he don't pull that John's ticket but he pulls out the woman at the well sir the Messiah come us he'll you tell us that these things I've that speak to the glories Geordie effect well hallelujah I got a gravel I got a gravel now come over again let me put you in the gravel change the Machine and let me run you over here and give you a good jerk and a shout and let me baptize you three times forward and three times backward and let me run you through all this and the Moche in shape he he didn't have to do none of that that woman took off a running as screaming at a Holland your imagine and she meeting the disciples and the disciples looking at him and looking at her and wondering what in the world was going on but you know what Jesus done Jesus gave heard that deposit and he put the crane check back inside of him and said praise God I got another one for your father he didn't have to run that old gravel because she wasn't no gravel she was a redeemable attribute and through the man Christ Jesus God had performed the Ministry of reconciliation this is why friend it's so important that we get ourselves out of the way this is what he wants to do through all of us maybe not to the same degree but he wants to let his life be live sir well shine through us and reconcile maybe another coin out there that you're working with the stairs place Peter gotta aim thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord Jesus hallelujah oh ma no wonder our flesh don't like your sister it's the last hold that Saint has on you it's the last hold he has on me to keep me from completely surrendering to God the people at CNN know my name they've called it before the people at ABC know my name the people at Fox know my name well it ain't ten people thats ever hindered me from going on with god so in reality they're not my enemies it's this oh boy right here Oh mother God if I could just kill it get away with it it's not that he wants you to take up your cross every day as soon as you get out of the bed of the morning whatever it is and remember you're Pro your cross can be multi-facet in the persecutions afflictions pain personal suffering being run down by people hurt having your reputation marred by Liars whatever more it may change from one day to the next one week to the next but it wants us to be able to patiently carry it as he did his have always carried it faithfully I have not now daresay I can speak for everyone that's visible here tonight and those that are invisible as well and say most of us have not either even the Lord Jesus when it come to facing this his humanity must feel this drawback because he knew I would he knew I would he knows how I am he knows every time he goes to leading me down sermons of this line right here our question I'll battle it I don't like preaching him I walked here left after service Sunday went home wet clothes on so I want to change my clothes Carol come in the closet where I said said don't you let the devil where are you out clothes what you preached because we need it iced I know it I know it but I still don't like it what is it part of my cross its whipping the people I love more than I love my own life I would die for you folks and then I have to turn around and whip you does that make sense well your parents had to do the same thing to your tune you would give your life for your children but you love them so much when they were wrong you corrected him that proved the extent of your love it was beyond human compassion let me just give you a little glimpse before we close there he was in the circle of eternity and he was the father actually but he must condon sin and become in the form of sonship so the Great Creator took on dust imagine when there was no cosmic light or no atomic dust or anything out there but yet he himself knew one day he would take on dust and become dust the Prophet said when he was born a baby that little toothless mouth that little toothless mouth when he opened that little toothless mouth and cried it was Jehovah like a baby he said he could have come a foamer tour man but he didn't want to come like a man he wanted to be born a baby so he would know how babies feel he grew up as an eight-year-old a nine year old a 10 year old as a teenager again the Prophet says we have him listen to it listen to it 12 2759 he said he wanted to come up and grow up as a teenager to face the tests and trials as a teenager and remember he faced those things as a teenager without the baptism of the Holy Ghost you said why would he do that because he wanted to be the high priest not only for Holy Ghost field but for those who are justified and sanctified aren't you glad he didn't wait to become your high priest just when you got the Holy Ghost he wanted to understand how babies would feel how children would feel how teenagers would feel praise God Satan can't relate to this friends this is why he totally missed it you imagined Satan and his demons and they hear sermons like this tonight which had been preached since the gospel has been preached for 2,000 years and he's still to this day he cannot process it it makes no sense to him the only thing he understands is rebellion and hatred he loves that sort of thing humility it's not in him what in him is pride and arrogance and puffed up and bragging on yourself and making yourself this and that are there stepping on whatever you have to step on to get to the top of the ladder but I'm so glad that's not who we are the ladder we're trying to get a top of is not Satan's ladder but Jacob's Ladder it anchored the Prophet said down on the earth and then it anchored up in heaven in the angels of God were ascending and descending up that ladder and later we know that ladder was called is Christ coming about our hits tonight I wonder how many of you that are present and those of you that have streamed the service and those of you that will archive it would you just say with me tonight Lord Jesus help me to take up my cross help me not to complain if you're like me probably it's not that you haven't bore your cross but you born it was complaints you've borne it with attitudes you've borne in with growling and all kinds of things that comes with it Oh Lord Jesus we ask you tonight for forgiveness Lord Father it's north and I'm asking for the first time in our life to take up my cross but lord I desire to take it up Lord with an adjustment in my attitude my hell look heavenly father help me Lord Jesus none of us and our human makeup we we want to be accepted we want to be loved we all of those things lord help us out pray to love you more than anything or anyone else in the world help me Lord Jesus you didn't tell me to deny my wife Lord you didn't say if any man will the nice children but he brought her right down repeated it over and over again in the four Gospels you must deny himself help us Lord Jesus I pray we love you too my father thank you for this word lord I thank you so much that we're going to get to start assembling together again Lord and we so look forward to it on Sunday father I pray that you'd help us through this time it's going to be a little different for still yet but help us to get through it Lord we would just pray for your mercy we realize Father that we're not dealing with just sales and that sort of thing under a microscope but we know this thing come from the fourth dimension it's a disease unlike anything as far as we know that man has ever dealt with before with the flu with the cold with many things people that are infected they have symptoms but this one Lord it is so well camouflaged that people can be asymptomatic Lord they can be spreading it from one to another to another and they don't even know that they're sick so it is truly showing us that Satan has found a way from that fourth dimension to be able to break into cells and into the human race in a higher way than what we have ever known before scientists microbiologists all these folks that are studying it they're finding out more and more and more about it Lord but we realize its origin we realize father it's demons so Lord God we pray bring healing to our nation father to our world I think about our brothers and sisters in the third world countries god they're suffering greatly I pray for them father for the sake of your elect Lord Jesus and Lord as we get back to work and get to come back to church and start to be able to go back to a normal sea of our lives father I pray that not be a resurgence of this thing Lord dear God may it leave us Granite Lord Jesus help us I pray father I know some of you children have actually succumbed to this and died Lord some of the message have actually died because of it some Lord just sharing some more today that have gotten sick one very very sick and then Lord another one in the same household Lord hardly any symptoms at all so it's it's a mystery it's an unusual thing how it affects us the Lord God it ain't no mystery to you nor do we believe the stripes that was laid upon your back covered this as well as into everything else Minister healing I pray to your children father we love you tonight Lord in the name of Jesus God bless you sinks see you Sunday morning as Joel ever praise the Lord you're Elvis amen my grace the wheels approach canosa's will empty our will and receive God's will amen that's what it is what it is and it's a greek word in the in description so god help us to do it brother we got to do that every time we hear the word just get rid of our wheel take God's will every every sir every temptation every trial amen God allows this God loves that just to see and you it'll bring out with your going and living in his will or living according to your own a man but it's most people today are living according to their own will you know the the will of their selfish will human will they controlled what they do how they do it when they do it where they do it I don't think and so on it's just serious human will oh well I should do this I should do that well what does God want you to do how does God want you to do it where does God want to do it when what what's the attitude God wants us to have what's the action or reaction that God wants to test see if we're born again we're going to reflect the nature of the one they're born were born by and it's God amen but there's too many that's really not born again they're religious but I born again if you're born again it's Christ in you if you're born again you got the nature of Christ you got the nature of God a man wonderful and well if you're if you're born again your reconciled this is absolutely amazing it's not just getting getting religious or I'm going to become a Christian home you got to be reconciled back to what you were a man so thank God for the for their greater revelation of reconciliation by the grace of God the scripture says it says for the love of christ constraineth us because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead a man and when we say all we're not referred to all the world but we're referring to all the seed of God the predestinated seed those whom he foreknew before the foundation of the world and it says that he died for all and that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto Him which died for them and rose again amen see Christians are living for Jesus and a living and again it's not now then but Christ living out through them by grace this is absolutely amazing wherefore in sport no we no man after the flesh yeh though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now in sport no we am no more a man not after the flesh no we're waiting to get into a glorified state by the grace of God born again by the grace of God not sinful flesh no no therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature before we were born again we lived after the flesh according to the flesh the will of the flesh and so on you know he's just doing what doing what human nature would give us to do but now we got divine only ghost nature amen therefore therefore if any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things grace to us grace old the old things are passed away oh my I trust by grace that the old nature has passed away and not not controlling us amen and it says behold all things are become new a man praise them all things become new you're a new creature in Christ grace grace grace and all things are of God who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ he's brought us back to himself and his nature and has given to us the Ministry of reconciliation praise the Lord you're gonna reflect that to family friends neighbors so on amen that you're absolutely different person to know that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and has committed unto us the word of reconciliation now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech you by us we pray you in Christ's stead be ye reconciled to God amen praise the Lord thank God for the Ministry of reconciliation by the Holy Ghost amen through our Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah just needed this quote he said referring to again this is the message that administered on and knoweth it not he said oh my brother sister every one of you conscious I know what that means he said just watch he says stay close to Christ and he said let me warn you as a minister of the gospel don't take any foolishness a man don't imagine anything stay right there until this inside of the inside is anchored to the word and that you're right in Christ because that's the only thing he said because we're in the most deceiving age that we ever lived in and it would deceive the very elect if possible he said because they have anointing and he says they can do anything like the rest of them but not stay with the word they can feel God since God after God's anointing and yet refuse his word oh yeah God allows this God allows that to bring out this to bring out that and so on what is anointing yes so let's make sure it's anointing is a man is bringing us more and more to eternal life amen not condemn us but save us for some of the anointing will condemn them amen because they won't stay with the word so he said it would deceive the very elect if possible because they have anointing and they can do anything like the rest of them and Lord willing we'll bring those things out in the message at ninety ones at the endtime tremendous it's serious it's absolutely serious gotta keep coming back to the word everything everything gotta be judged by the word a man he said clean up your lives pay your debts oh no man remember in the name of the Lord something is fixing to happen and he said are we coming here playing a game are we coming here meeting as a lodge he said Christ can't come on to the church is perfectly right he is waiting on us this coming line with the word stay in line with the word a man by the grace of God I believe he said we are at the end amen and we are so the grace of God be with us brother's sister that will deny self but acknowledge him by the grace of Almighty God it's always tremendous concerning the reconciliation of the seed of God back to God if you are reconciled your reconciled back to where you come from thank God the Lord bless you amen this thing I surrender all amen all to Jesus I surrender all to him I freely give I will ever love and trust him in his service presence daily live amen all to Jesus I surrender now I feel the sacred plane all the joy of my salvation glory glory to his name amen praise the name of the Lord grace grace grace they're singing for the
